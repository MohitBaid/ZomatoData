On Nabami , we visited this place . It is not spacious at all  but the food was terrific ! 

We ordered crispy fried chilli chicken(dry) , chicken veg soup and a combo consisting of chilli chicken and chicken rice. 

Although the quantity of rice was less , the quality was good and every item was fresh . 

Being affordable , the politeness of the staff impressed us . 

Looking forward to drop by again....☺

During pandal hopping in the gariahat area on Ashtami, we craved for some snacks . Previously for shopping I hopped in here 1-2 times.  Their sandwiches are good. This time​ , thankfully we got seats immediately inspite of the puja rush. We ordered dry chilly chicken and fresh lime soda. The chilly chicken was good in quantity,taste was fine but it was too oily. 
I loved their decor, doodles all over the wall. 
Good to have a sit and enjoy your foot when u come shopping.

Shopping at gariahat and starving ? Yes this is the place to quieten your hunger at reasonable price.
Located near the famous bedouin, this place is a kind of its own. Nice ambience and quick service along with good food quality make you visit this place more than one time. Ordered mixed rice and noodles combo with chicken (4pcs). Both were good I'm taste. But plain cold drink was much better than masala cold drink . Will visit soon.

Hello Food Lovers,

Just visit G.F. with my friend...
Yes, rated 5 but they deserve 4 rating...
I tried CHRISPY GARLIC CHICKEN with EGG CHOWMIN , CHICKEN was suggested by Golden Flavour, they claim it's their speciality .. 
◆Chicken dish was just awesome , those who people are reading my review suggest you must try this dish just mouth watering
CHOWMIN it's okay..
◆ CHRISPY GARLIC CHICKEN 5/5 
◆ CHOWMIN 3/5 - very disappointed with their CHOWMIN quantity , quality good  , quantity very poor still I'm hungry.... 

Best part is that they don't charge extra charge for vat , vat included....

Must visit and don't miss the opportunity of their chicken... Added picture...

Good place to quieten your hunger at cheap prices. I ordered a chicken club sandwich and chicken lollipop in tangy sauce. The sandwich was pretty ordinary but extremely delicious and healthy full of corns, vegetables, chicken, egg and cheese. The chicken lollipop were a winner cooked well. Tender, succulent with a tangy flavour and garnished with spring onions. Perhaps a bit less sauce would have made it perfect. Overall good place.

Located in a very good location for those who go accessories shopping in Gariahat. It's a small but lovely colourful nice and clean food joint. They also have combo meals which which we didn't try. We were very hungry and found that this is a 3.7 rating restaurant in Zomato so really wanted to give this place a visit. 

Food Ordered : Chicken Drumsticks, Mixed fried rice and Manchurian Chicken.

# drumsticks were pretty good and 6 pieces of drums were  nicely fried and served with a spicy sauce. Chicken pieces were well cooked and really yummy.
# Mixed Fried Rice was a total disaster. Rice was half cooked and the prawns were not at all fresh. The fried rice was very dry and we literally had to struggle to chew that properly.
# Same goes with the Manchurian Chicken also. Chicken pieces were hard and we couldn't eat all the 6 pieces of chicken they provided. 

It's really  disappointing to see a 3.7 rated restaurant in Zomato provides this kind of food to its customers.I am not taking about everybody, I'm just sharing my personal experience. 
Prices were moderate and acceptable. Staffs were decent and the service was fast.....

Shopping in gariahat and starving ? This is a great joint to refrain from dearth of happiness ! In a very convenient location on your way from gariahat towards rashbehari on the opposite foot of Spencer's , this pretty joint is located with ample amount of Seats and quirky interior !
So we actually went there for having momos , but momos were finished by then which was a disappointment . But we were referred to have their fish and chips and it arrived within 15 mins. The amount was humongous . 8 large pieces of fish with generous amount of French fries loaded on the top. The fish was very fresh and totally filling , though the taste was on the top notch , it couldn't be actually called fish and chips , it was more of an Indian version of it.
Their hospitality is appreciable and the price is also reasonable. Though the menu has been upgraded , but the items are inclusive of tax ! Definitely planning my next visit there to try their Chinese :p

Its a late review.. Last week we had visited this  outlet at gariahat.. A small but well managed restaurant with nice decor..we ordered chicken lollipop in tangy sauce as starter, veg fried rice and hot garlic chicken as main.. They took a little time to serve but they serve the yums... I mean the taste of food.. 😋  
Lollipop was perfectly fried, with tangy sauce it tastes just A1.. Fried rice was good and in the chicken side dish- hot garlic flavour was prominent, it was spicy...we enjoyed it too much. ... Must try.. 
Manu in zomato must be updated..

It's a hot summer afternoon today and after a tiring shopping in Gariahat market me and my friend decided to visit this place to fill our empty stomach. It is a small restaurant with colorful decor and nice sitting arrangements. This place is very easy to locate as it is situated just beside the main road. Our today's lunch includes,
*STARTER : Chicken lollipop in tangy sauce
*MAIN COURSE : Hot garlic Chicken
*STAPLE : Vegetable fried rice
The starter is served within 15 to 20 minutes. 6 pieces of chicken lollipops are served tossed in tangy sauce which is just finger licking. Perfectly crispy and spicy. Next coming to the main course the vegetable rice is good and hot garlic chicken is also yummy. All the items are very reasonably priced and inclusive of taxes.
P.S. The menu shown in Zomato must be updated.

Visited this place on 2/4/2017 evening with family. It was crowded.Sadly for lack of servers, so many people left the restaurant with anger.I was pushy, that is why we got our food and drinks between 20 minutes. 
Sweet Chili chicken-very testy, Fish and chips-oh! I can it that again and again, coffee was also good. 
One thing-
Improve your management skills people, because you guys know how to cook.

A little eatery located bang on opposite to 'Basanti Debi College' - a perfect place to stop at and gobble after a tiring shopping session.
Ambience : The interior has a lot of green,orange and yellow everywhere, giving the whole space a warm cozy feel.The staffs are very well behaved and informative.
Food : 1.Chicken Lollypop In Tangy Sauce - I'm not overrating this by an inch,but the 6 pieces of lollypop sautèd in minced garlic and the tangy sauce,is by far the best I've ever had.
2.Hong Kong Chicken Noodles - Well,it tasted good.But it was a bit overboiled,giving it more of a homemade chowmein feel,'cause the noodles strands kinda stuck to each other-not having a regular restaurant noodles feel.They should work on it.
3.Veg fried rice - Average.
4.Hot garlic chicken - 8 pieces of chicken in moderately spicy gravy with a dominating garlic flavour.A nice side dish.
This place is a hidden gem as the dishes excel in quality and quantity.Brownie points for not pinching the pocket hard.
Introduction of a wash basin is highly recommended,though they provide a hundred tissue papers to compensate that 😁
Do drop by and have a indo-chinese tummytastic time ✌

Is was bustling today, so obvious-Sunday. Except the manager, only one stuff was present for service today. 
People were leaving just because no one was talking their orders, food was taking way too long. After I assumed that if I don't push, we will be leaving hungry. It worked! 
Sweet chili chicken, fish n chips was fantastic. Even tea and coffee was quite good. 
This place can be the next big thing but firstly, servers need to improve their management skills. 
4 star from me for delicious food 😊

On of the best place in gariahut.....just opposite of basanti devi college...on ground floor....their behavior is very cordial.... Nice and cute graphics all around showing Bengali's food culture.... Nice small tables with nice cosy chairs....in this scorching hot weather their ac was properly functioning....it looks like a small cafe....but it is really a hidden gem of gariahut...after campari...

Now coming to food we ordered chicken fried mono,veg fried rice and chilli chicken...

Chicken momo was very good...better than wao mono...

Veg fried rice was good

Chilli chicken was also good ,contains 8 standard size soft tender and juicy chicken pieces...really enjoyed their Chinese....

They also have various combos ..to fit your pocket....

Last but not the least... There is no extra vat or service tax..this makes the place awsm....it was a nice experience...

Being extremely tired after shopping in gariahat, i was looking for a cafe or a place and not a restaurant where i can sit and rest for a while and munch on some food. This place caught my eyes suddenly and me n my husband went inside without even knowing its name.  

Location is a bit confusing. Its located on the right hand side footpath leading to gariahat, near to Bata. 

We ordered chicken drumsticks in tangy sauce. Served very quickly. 6 pieces were there. Tastes awesome. Yummm

Only drawback is it doesn't have wash basin. Instead they give you bowl with water.. which somehow I didn't like.

We all love to munch on something whether its chinese or mughlai or street food after completing shopping or giving(ourselves)a break from shopping. This particular food station is perfect and suitable for those shopaholic persons who are around gariahat and crave for some delicious yummy chinese cuisine. This particular joint is situated opposite Basanti Devi College. 

The place is quite spacious with lovely decorations. Coming to the food we had chicken lollipop in chili tangy sauce,chicken fried rice and dry chili chicken.

Chicken lollipop- yummy and delicious. The sauce was too delicious. The balance of the chili and tangyness was perfect. The chicken was cooked well. 

Dry chili chicken - yet another tasty dish. The chicken pieces were cooked beautifully;they were tender. Flavours were good. Overall a very good dish.

Chicken fried rice- this was good also. The rice was well cooked. The taste was also good. 

Each and every items was good. The service was slow. Needs to focus on the service.

Will definately visit this place again.

I went inside and wandered why I haven't noticed this place before. It's a small but very cute place with colourful decor.... Liked the ambience. Staffs were also very nice to us.. Even they serve combo platter at a reasonable price. Try out chicken drumsticks in tangy sauce.

This cosy little dinning place right in the middle of gariahat might not top every food enthusiast's 'to be visited' list. However, given its quirky interiors and amazing combo meals, it is much frequented by people who seek a break from their hectic shopping schedules. Having been there twice, I found the attending staff very polite and homely. The seating arrangements are decent and most importantly, one gets good food at very reasonable prices. We ordered a Chinese noodles combo and crispy chilly baby corn. The combo was regular, while the baby corn had just the right crunch and the right amount of spice. Overall, maybe not a place you would go gaga over, but it's value for money over here.@

After a tiring n busy afternoon in gariahat my friend n i decided to have tea.
But we had 3 requirements:
1. We wanted to sit somewhere n have tea.( so that we could chat n it was raining torrentially outside too)
2. Prices had to b reasonable 
3.the place should have been hygienic.
And while strolling on the streets of gariahat we finally spotted this place situated in the foot opp basanti devi college n it fulfilled all our requirements perfectly.
It is a small eatery with a very colorful n whacky interiors.
Air conditioned n serving good Chinese food (looking forward to try them) n beverages.the staffs r friendly n price is very reasonable.
So next time u r in gariahat tired shopping or strolling u know where to visit!!:)

It is a nice place to have food. Interior is popping. Great for friends gathering. I went there with my sister. We ordered chicken thukpa. We said to serve us light.   Best thing is they really served us light, not spicy & it was great in taste. Pricing is good in terms of quantity. Good place for   shopping and eating.  A small disappointment was we ordered momo at first, but it was not available. Otherwise great place for the people who r with small budget wants a place for adda or to say college  guys.

Nice place on busy Gariahat. Funky colourful interiors and decent seating arrangements. Staff is really polite. Food service is little slow but that's not much of a problem. Food is tasty. We tried the mixed gravy noodles and hot&sour soup. They ra out of momos when we reached. Getting place at peak hours can be little difficult.

When your pocket isn't full neither is your stomach, hop in here for a hearty meal. Located in Gariahat, a nodal zone, it records quite a number of footfalls per day. The staff is polite and more or less prompt. The food comes at a reasonable price. Do try out pepper fish and the chilli garlic rice. The decor is simple with walls designed by graffiti and chique lampshades. The seating however needs to be looked after. The tables need to be more spacious along with cushioned chairs. With rooms for improvement, it can be a big name in the growing food chain of the city.

This place is run by a cute girl. Very humble, very genuine, I must say. As I was looking at her she was attending all her guests with a smile. Now, coming to the food, its just as honest and genuine. The finger licking taste of the food is awesome. The staff is courteous and guided us through the menu. I ordered their club sandwich and it was very tasty and stomach filling. I loved their decor. I took parcel of mushroom tangy sauce and a chicken noodles. my daughter loved it very much. We are definitely coming back again to this gariahat joint.

This is my third time to this restaurant. I really come here for the staff, they are so courteous and help us in every way. When I come here I always leave happy by the way they treat and pamper us..the ambience is awesome and the food is delicious. Nice value for money.

But today when I went, i met the owner. She is so friendly and courteous. She insisted me on having pan fried chilli fish. (though I am not that fish person). But...OHH...MYY GOD!!. It was finger licking. I couldn't resist myself and ordered burnt garlic chicken noodles with chicken in tangy sauce. I am definitely going back to her restaurant again and again and again!!  Keep up the good work guys!  next time I will definitely get some photos..I was so much carried away by the taste and feel, I forgot to click.:-D

It amazed me to find so much potential in such a joint that looked so casual, bit laid back or rather tad too homely. The place which can still be termed as a ‘newly opened’ joint is one of the bright hidden gems that I have unearthed in the recent times. Not that there ain’t any area of improvement, there are loads but the age needs to be kept in mind before judging this place with the big daddies of the business; just as a piece of fact, acceleration is more precious than steady speed when it can be handled good. I was mighty pleased with this place since the food did all the talking here and the rest of the glittery paraphernalia (which gets more brownie points from many) took a backseat when the gastronomic deal was in progress. 

This is a joint that can be called a ‘shopaholic’s café’ primarily for its location. Its location is its boon as well as its curse (according to me) since very few people can spot it from the main road, its entrance is all covered up by the road-side stalls and hawker’s who are all messing up the place but in the same time providing the charm of good ol’ gariahat that we all know! So as I said earlier, this place literally is hidden and is truly a hidden gem of this area. It is located beside the Beduoin restaurant and opposite the Basanti Devi college near gariahat crossing. This place is primarily serving oriental cuisine along with few other quick bites and I was glad to receive the food tasting invitation that introduced me to this lovely joint sitting right in the epicenter of hustle and bustle of the Gariahat market. But when you are in there you are really cut-off from the mad city rush that’s creating all the turmoil outside, only thing – I would love the glass doors to have some frosted finish so that I don’t even have to get a sight of that mad rush or the nail-biting negotiations going on outside in that market.

The place has got ample space which is nicely utilized by placing several small tables with modest colorful chairs along with it. For large groups such tables can be brought together, so that won’t be an issue. Most, interesting thing that I noticed while I was there at this joint is – people simply walk in while they are in between some hectic shopping schedule for a breather, and that’s why I said the location is a boon to this place. There is ample space and you need not go for reservations. Except the flooring I kinda liked the interior, especially the wall decor which is very colorful and vibrant. You have wall graffiti that depicts urban folks dining at restaurants, also the wall has got the city skyline and overall the wall arts inject loads of life into this place. Next noteworthy object is the hanging colorful glass lights which when all lit up looks really wonderful, you can go on practicing some of your photography skills with these lights (as subject) for sure! 

Now let us come to the crux of the matter and yes, that’s the time when we discuss about the food. Though you get some quick bites here like sandwiches, fish n chips to go with some coffee or black tea, but the main cuisine that is being served here is Chinese. And that is Chinese with some great flavour and visible honesty, thus kinda justifying the name ‘Golden flavour’! Now let us check out the dishes which were tasted by me –

a) Aam Panna – I was served a glass of water and a glass of Aam Panna right after I reached this place. It was chilled and refreshing with beautiful green color, the perfect drink with heat-resistant properties that I was looking for after coming in from that blazing summer sun.

b) Chicken Lollipop – The chicken lollipop tried at this place was nice with that tangy sauce making it perfect for the admirers of this dish, it had good amount of chicken around the top giving that look of a lollipop. It was bit stuffed before frying it and tossing it with that sauce. You will surely like this bite sized finger food that is garnished with chopped spring onions. 

c) Fish n Chips – Well, the fish n chips served here is different from the conventional Fish n chips that you get in some continental joints, gastrobars or maybe at steakhouses where it’s served with the tartar sauce. Originally this dish was prepared in the 17th century in England. But here you’ll get a twisted version, so it’s better to be prepared for that twist. Here it is more like a homely Kolkata version of fish and chips. The fish you get is fresh Bhetki batter-fried with French fries served along. The fish does the trick, it is really fresh and awesome to taste. The chaat masala which is sprinkled on top can be avoided. I loved this twist since I am always open to new dishes or old dishes with some twist, I will again go for this for that awesome flavorful fresh Bhetki in there! 

d) Chicken Steamed Momo – The chicken steamed momos were perfect to be true, they were nice in size and the minced onion, garlic and chicken filling was just good enough to satiate your momo cravings. The red chilli paste or rather the sauce provided along with this was also one perfect companion to go with. The skin was moderately thin and has a nice oily texture to it that’s perfect. You may also opt for pan fried momos but I personally always go for the steamed ones and they worked well for me here, worth a try!

e) Pan Fried Chilli Fish – This was one of the dishes which I really loved and would again order for it when I’m back. It was tossed with bell pepper, onion, carrot, coriander, etc and the fish in there again did the trick. It was again fresh Bhetki with some amazing taste and aroma. Yes, this place serves some seriously awesome preparations of fish unlike many other joints. Do try this out.

f) Teriyaki Chicken – If you wanna go for some tangy dish with some pan fried chicken in there then you can go for this. Though Teriyaki has originally been a grilled preparation but these days we can find pan fried teriyaki chicken dishes as well. So since it’s not grilled you won’t get any smoky flavor but due to frying for long the outer skin is bit crunchy here which might suit the palate of many, though I would have liked it a bit more juicy and tender. But that thick soy based sauce did the trick again. And yes, this dish was served with freshly cut pineapple slices which went well with that tangy pan fried chicken.  

g) Red Pepper Fish – Since I found the fish sides to be very good at this place, I ordered for my third fish preparation of the afternoon, and again I was not disappointed. Infact this was of the same class again prepared with fresh Bhetki. The very well prepared flavorful fish went well with the noodles. The green, red and yellow bell peppers were tossed with the nicely cut pieces of Bhetki and sesame seeds were sprinkled on top making it look more appetizing. Worth a try! 

h) Egg Chicken Hakka Noodles – Oh boy I loved the simple honest comforting hakka noodles served here. It somehow reminded me of Yam Mein which has similar subtle taste and gives you the taste of old-school Chinese. The noodles were very well tossed with veggies, chicken and egg and had a lovely aroma and subtle flavor that acts as a perfect base for any side to go with. And yes, it was served in a bowl that had huge quantity packed in it, good enough for two persons. Worth a try!

In the end, all these were then washed down by some chilled soft drinks that kinda completed the food tasting session. And now if I talk about the service, then I would say it is effective and courteous, but bit more manpower with time will do good.  The place promises to serve good honest food and it exceeds my expectations in doing so, the ingredients used are remarkable and the final flavour will surely bring you back. Also the pricing is very reasonable and pocket pleasing. A perfect joint for the students for sure. I am sure they will keep improving and with time they will attract even more customers who are not very regular in this Gariahat area. Till then I wish the team well and wish them all the best for their future ventures.
                                          ...

I had gone shopping with my sisters and it was around 8 and we were famished and then we spotted this restaurant on our way back to Gariahaat More. We thought of trying it and it proved to be a wise decision. The food was served hot, fresh and it was light on the stomach. The staff was very courteous and their service was excellent. Love the cozy feel of the place.

The decor of the reastaurant was really pretty... Food had a good taste too.... But Iam very disappointed with their service... We had to wait for so long... They didn't even serve water, napkins nothing... We had to ask them for everything and then wait and wait... Moreover the cold drink was not cold either... Really disappointed!!!

With a warm and cozy decor, this restaurant is a welcoming hub for casual dining. My mother and I stopped over for some snacks to nibble on during a tiresome shopping spree. This place missed out on a point from a 5/5 due to the time they take to serve orders, however it is considerable as they'll utilize the time to cook food fresh and not dip a frozen or preserved material to customers. Recommended for all :)

It is typically a casual diner. Location is great, if you are shopping for long in gariahat market and got hungry, it is perfect for little snacking. The place is clean with colourful interior. Their dumplings i.e. momo are very good.  Price is okay as long as there are no taxes. But you have to remember it is a not very big place.  You eat early, leave early. Otherwise the place can be little less airy. Then, they have only one person waiting tables, service is little slow.

Me and my senior Tanwyee Ray had to meet up, and as usual Gariahat area is our favorite catch-up place, and after a search on for new cafes, she suggested Golden Flavour to be tried for the evening. I agreed, met up at Gariahat and then walked till the cafe. It is kind of easy-to-find located as it is located within the market place itself. I would say the cafe has really a good location, and it should try to take advantage of its location. 
At the entrance of the cafe, they had their special menu written on a white board with colorful pens. We entered. It was not a big place inside, however, could fit in 25-30 people at a time. We sat on the tables. The ambience was okay. The AC was not working properly most probably and the fans they had were in different directions making the atmosphere very hot and humid and uncomfortable. The decor, on the other hand, was really good. The interior is colorful, with colorful chairs, well decorated, the colors matching the theme, well-lit, decorative lamps etc. which gave it a good look overall and made it attractive. Service is too slow, as they had only one person taking orders from every table and also serving at the tables. The food menu that they had was very limited. There were hardly any options for drinks, be it hot or cold. The only things available in drinks were tea, coffee, and cold drinks. No iced teas, no frappes, nothing!! A big turn-off!
The food items in the menu were also nothing wow. It was pretty normal. We wanted to have Prawn chips but that was unavailable.
We finally placed an order for Pan Fried Chilli Fish and a chicken dish which was Pepper Chicken. I was feeling too sleepy, so we ordered two hot raw teas for us too. 
The food was good, well presentably served. The fish dish tasted really well. And I liked the tangy spicy taste of the chicken dish. 
The bill was pocket friendly enough as there were no taxes.
I would want to come back to the cafe once they fix their air conditioning issues. Otherwise its too hot to sit. They should include more items in the menu, they should include a variety of drinks in mocktails, mojitos, frappes, caffeinated drinks and iced teas to make it even better and make more options available to the customers. 
😊

The Restaurant is situated opposite to the Basanti Devi College. While shopping we found this place all of a sudden. Food is quiet good and affordable. We ordered the Pan fried Chicken Momo and Chicken-Chips.
The only disappointment was they don't have any washroom. I hope they include a washroom also. Would like to visit once again.

Suddenly found this place while we were in the middle of shopping at gariahat... The board placed outside with a section of the menu written on it caught our eyes... I wasn't as hungry as my friends were yet thought there's no harm in trying a new outlet... The decor was nice and fun.. We ordered 2 non veg combo meals n a separate plate of fried rice.. The food was tasty but the quantity of rice both in the combo meal and the separate plate disappointed me... Nevertheless, a nice joint and no doubt a treat for the shoppers... :)

Being a shopaholic Gariahut is one of my favourite place..last day I was feeling hungry during shopping and co-incidentally this place caught my eyes ( specially that white board,where they wrote their "Today's Special Combo" )..My friend Rash was also feeling hungry..So we (me, Pree and Rash)  just entered and ordered 
1. veg fried rice and chilli chicken (combo), 
2. veg noodles and chilli chicken (combo), 
3. veg fried rice..
This place was nicely decorated with cartoon wallpapers..I liked the ambience..I didn't like the quantity but I liked the taste of food..I think It's the perfect place for shoppers..I was in hurry so forgot to take snaps..

This is perfect halting point for shoppers in Gariahat. 
The omelette fondue was not a fondue at all, just toast with omelette. The fish and chips were more like fish nuggets, but tasty nevertheless. The chicken wings in tangy sauce were amazing to taste. 
So basically this is a pocket friendly place, done up in bright colours, serving decent food. And that's all you need in Gariahat. For fine dining, we have other places.

Very well cooked, delicious food at a very reasonable price. The ambiance provided is good and the location is also no doubt very prominent.  It is definitely a 'must try'. 
If they keep going like this, very soon they are going to be famous...
