It was the first time I had ordered cake from bakery world for my mom and dad anniversary and I must say it's was just fabulous. It was so yummy that every time I took the bite, i could feel the butter and delicious chocolate. It was so rich in flavour that I would recommend all the cake lovers to go and try it once. I think bakery world can compete with all the premiums cake shops in Kolkata. Long way to go Bakery world. All the best and I hope you will keep up the cake quality in future too and don't disheartened the customer.

We ordered a birthday cake from here. As chocolate rich and gooey the cake appeared, it was rather disappointing in taste. It felt slightly undercooked, I could almost feel the taste of the eggs. Presentation and packaging were lovely. But taste was heavily compromised.
Hopefully next time could be better.
