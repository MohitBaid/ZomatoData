This restaurant inside fort raichak has a very good ambience and view! You can get a very good view of Ganges ...but the food is just about average...though the desserts are quite good...overall a 2. 5 rating!

The looks of it uber-upscale, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the ganges. Yes! Amazing view accompanied with mediocre food. The only good thing on the menu, which was indeed really nice was the club sandwich. Ordered a pizza as well but to my dismay.

The ambiance is awesome. We have tried The Orient, but it was about to be closed. So we had to go to The Indian Quarter. Food was average. But we got a cockroach inside biryani. That was immediately removed and we were offered replacement free of cost. As we refused it humbly they offered some sandwiched to take away. We were also against it. So they offered drinks free of cost and apologized.
