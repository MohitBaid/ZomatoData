Situated near the Sitalamandir stop at Kestopur, this sweet shop is the best of its kind in the locality. Their Rosogolla, Rosomalai, Gulab jamun, Langcha, Pantua are good... Indigenous sweet preparations especially the ones made with kheer are also praiseworthy. Every morning they prepare hot Jilipis, Amittis and present them with freshly made samosas... The overall treat is good and worth the price...

It has the best sweet collection at kestopur. Quality is quite good. Not only sweets but paneer is also very fresh. Samosa is average. Curd is okay..
