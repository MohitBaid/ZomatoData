One of the best fast food centres in Kolkata. Situated beside Wow momo , this is actually a take away outlet. The menu is quite simple with combination of Indian , Chinese and Mughlai dishes. Chicken cutlet , Fish fry and Mughlai paratha are among my favourites. Reasonable price.

This is a small joint near Sulekha bridge, Jadavpur end and KPC. Neat cooking area which is almost like an open kitchen. The menu is simple and a combination of Indian, Chinese and Mughlai. Their fish fry is simply awesome, love their mutton noodles (thought quite an Indianiser vrsion) but will be fine with any Bengali. Most of the other snack items are also great. However, the Biryani needs a considerable improvement inters of the rice used and the fluffiness'.

Firstly its great to see this fast food corner assigned to zomato. Located to the left when coming down from Jadavpur, it stands between 8b and Shulekha Bus stand just beside Wow Momo. A very convenient spot to park your own conveyance while you order food.

Had parceled food innumerable times parking the car sideways. Chicken rolls, Chicken noodles, Mixed noodles we always enjoyed. Biriyani I did not find to be great though. It should be more juicy.

Price - Average.

Service - Prompt.

Staffs - Cordial. (They come and deliver at your car)

This is a well known fast food outlet in Jadavpur area and I have visited it quite a few number of times.I have tried their Chicken cutlet,Chicken Biryani and Egg chowmien.The cutlet was huge in size and filled with chicken with the right blend of spices.It was one of the best I had ever had! The chowmien was also good.The biryani was average though..and the chicken piece in it was extremely hard and I had to finish it off with difficulty. They serve complementary salad with the biryani.
Service is decent.Prices of the snacks items are somewhat on the higher side. As far the ambience is concerned,it's best to opt for a takeaway as there are a lot of flies flying around which won't let you eat in peace.And don't go there before 3.30pm as they do not have the food ready at that time.

Situated near KPC Medical College & beside the Wow Momo, Jadavpur this takeaway fast food counter serves different kinds of cutlets, rolls, chowmein & biriyani. 

All of those are average, but it's better than other roll centers in the vicinity of Jadavpur  so it's not a bad place for nullifying your hunger trying rolls or cutlets or anything! I didn't like the chicken biriyani here though.

My office colleagues and i once decided to stop by this crowded fast foot joint, located just beside the Jadavpur Bawarchi, for some rolls. Some of them had a simple egg roll, some had the chicken roll. I myself tried the egg chicken roll. And let me tell you, I've never had a better roll in this area. The flavor of the chicken tikka inside, with the crispiness of the paratha - it was truly Mamma Mia.  I am not a fan of rolls, but would definitely like to try out a Badshah roll on another occasion.

It's a really good snack outlet near my college.They also serve very good biriyani at low price.Half plate is enough for a hungry adult.I had it last yr in the winter.The rice had nice flavours and the meat was soft.They don't have proper sitting arrangement for dine-in..one can sit in chairs and stools kept on the footpath surrounding the outlet.It can get difficult during summers to have biriyani in the scorching outdoor heat.

I recently tried their chicken rolls during duty hrs on recommendation of my fellow mates in college(mostly hostelites) who said that Badshah snacks serves the best rolls in Jadavpur.The hype wasn't false at all.The roll was very big,filling was adequate with juicy smoky chicken cubes with capsicums and onions, seasoned to perfection with salt, pepper with a dash of lime.The paratha was crisp and not too oily.One of the best rolls I had..it's almost comparable with Nizam.Will surely drop by to try the other varieties of rolls and snacks from here.

A perfect place for having typical Bengali snacks like Cutlets. Located beside the KPC Medical College right on the main road in between 8B bus stand and Sulekha crossing, this is another busy place for takeaways. 

They dont have any proper place to sit and enjoy your food except some stools placed right on the road. Some of their items are really good like Fish Butter Fry, Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Kabiraji and Chicken Boti Kebab. Once i tried their Fish Finger which i found quite disappointing. They have started serving Chinese and Indian items but they are just okayish. Should be avoided. Be ready to wait after placing your order when there's a rush.

Located near KPC Medical College and in between 8B and Jadavpur, I was pretty disappointed seeing their sub-standard quality. Having heard so much about here, I was expecting something on the likes of Maloncho, but I guess the hype was indeed just a hype.

Had ordered for a Fish-Fry. Took some time to be delivered. Although the outside was crisp, the interior was rock hard with the fish fillet sticking to the coating. Needless to say, the fish was cold and hard too, and it was obvious, the material wasn't defrosted properly before thawing it on the oven.

Not coming here again. My local market in Salt Lake serves better snacks at equal price range.

This is a small restaurant serving good food with perfect pricing... You may say a bit cheaper also. Suitable to your pocket. quantity and taste regarding their prices is adequate. My preferance for their food will be chicken roll, chicken kebab fry, chicken cutlet, fish batter fry, and their mughlai   paratha... Yes this paratha item you must try, providing a balanced taste of spices to your mouth. Really liked it. But very poor quality seating arrangement.

This place is just outside KPC Medical College. It serves snacks at a prime location of Jadavpur. The place has gradually turned into the snacks point of SC Mullick road, Jadavpur.

This is not a hi-fi restaurant. It has 5-6 chair on road side. Also it serves a few main course items and combos. Everything tastes good but  is bit too oily. They have a Bengali Lunch counter at around 10 meter distance. I m almost a regular customer. Mostly I take chicken roll and very rarely chicken main course dish.
The chicken roll is better than other nearby snacks counters, they put a good quantity of chicken but very large pieces.

Was one of the most pocket friendly, and rather tiny foodhub in the jadavpur locality.

I remember, once when I was a kid and returning from a tuition; passing by the shop, I had this sudden urge to eat.... I went over to the shopkeeper and order the food. Finally, when it was time for delivery, I found out that I had enough money left only to pay for my food.
On noticing this, the proprietor actually gave me a rebate of 20 bucks, so that I can catch an auto back home!! And this was the first time I was ordering food from them..

After this, when ever I had a few extra bucks, I ordered food from here on the way back from my tuition...

I have tried all there dishes and all are very good... don't expect it to be like big budget restaurants standards.... today I tried there chicken chowmin after a long time... and delight for having the same taste as before.... gr8... nothing to say about deco and staffs.... but there service was pretty fast.... it has no competition with other nearby joint.... as they have a steady flow of customers.... recommended to very foodies...

Squeezed between two famed food joints Royal Lebanese and Wow Momos at Jadavpur 8B .Badshah Snacks is giving both its competitors a run for their money,while the competitor duo pass their time killing flies the busy kitchen at Badshah hustles to serve its hungry customers standing , sitting and waiting in their car's to grab a bite of their favourite snack.
    I visited this joint with a friend who introduced me to this place and we gorged on Crispy Fish Butter Fry & Chicken Cutlet which were made to perfection.The fish in the buttery fry was of great quality ,white ,soft,and with a thin crispy covering and the Chicken Cutlet was lovely ,rich and reeked of indian ground spices.The prices were also quite reasonable.The only disadvantage of this joint is inappropriate dine in facility,so better get your food packed.

It is just an ordinary fast food joint like any other. small in space , beside the road , not so hygienic and a little bit dirty.

But its in an area which is always crowded and so it gets many customers . It dosn't have dine in , so I always took a parcel from this place .

Now I haven't tasted many crunchy snacks from this place but what I have tasted is the veg rice and the chicken rice with chilly chicken.

The rice was the best in that price range , it was tasty and less oily than the rice served in most fast food centers. The chilly chicken was good , not so hot (i don't like too hot).

Apart from that I had the fish Kabiraji , it was just great . The price at this place is also not high

The fried rice is really nice and i like the chilli chicken. The people are friendly here like the normal food joints of Kolkata :)

Well this is a snacks place pretty close to where I live and hence been there quite a few times. 
Nothing special really, the place looks a tad dirty(which may be quite a turn off for few) too. However majority of the snacks are decent tasting. The food served is usually fresh and quick which is an advantage. 
Most of the rolls are decent, or should I say good. But beyond that it's not really the place to be. 
So if you are hungry and you live in Jadavpur and your budget is 50 Rs, then just come here and have an egg chicken roll. You'll like it.
