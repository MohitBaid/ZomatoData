Every food is too much oily. TASTE is also pathetic. I dont know who is the owner but their behaviour is so bad towards customer. I will recommend every one not to go there.

Ambiance is really really bad...they treat us like we don't pay for our food at all.
Been there for more than 20 times because there are no other food center at noon near joramandir.
But everytime their behavior towards customers is really bad.

I got take away parcels from this place with four packets of veg noodles , one plate each of chicken pakoras and chilli chicken and laccha paratha. The noodles were too oily but the taste of most of the dishes were upto the mark. Something i liked was the vada pao.

The food is okay for a roadside restaurant. Although a little unhygienic, the Chinese and Punjabi cuisines are worth eating. But the most disappointing thing about this restaurant is the behaviors of the owners and the workers. They behave as if they are Gods.

Want to eat veg curries and rotis?
Paneer items and other vegetable dishes are their forte.
Rotis, couple of curries with pickle, a convenient dinner plan within 100 bucks.

Terrible road side fast food centre. Eat at your risk if you don't want to get sick.

Most of  the food served is either few days left over or uncooked, veg curries have dead flies in it and never try biryani here, that is worst of all.
