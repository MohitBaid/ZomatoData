Great food quality. Pocket friendly. take away. Seats for 12 people maximum. Schezwan   gravy chow and chilli chicken are among the best of their items. Quantity is decent. They cook in front of us increasing reliability!

Fast food joint in bhawanipur which was very simple looking. Small restaurant with 2-3 tables to sit. Ambitious was above average but hospitality was good. Service was quick and presentation was average. Come to food they serve both north indian and Chinese cuisine which was surprisingly tastes very good as well healthy too. They also serve Chinese fast food like rools etc which were also tastes good. All dishes are pocket friendly. For this place i have to say place doesn't matter taste was. Must visit place. Recommended to all.

Well the area near Diamond Plaza mall is slowly turning into a food lovers paradise and Kasturi is just another addition to it. Went for a lunch on a Thursday afternoon and opted for classic Bengali main course like chingri maach er malai kari and sorse pomfret and I would say I didn't expect the food to be so tasty. Everything was fresh and hot and everything came to our table pretty fast. 
The only thing which lacks in this joint is the lack of decent service.. The attendants were grumpy and sleepy and they lacked any kind of interaction whatsoever. There were times when I was alone in the restaurant and none of the attendants were present in the dining area. 
The restaurant will do great in future solely because of the quality of food they serve and it would be an added advantage if they can take the service seriously. Because when one goes to eat out not only food but the quality of service also matters a lot.

They make some of the best Chicken and Muttons Rolls in the city, with their speciality being the "Laccha Paratha" for the wrap

Can't say the rest of the food is too authentic though.

One must try out the rolls here, for their amazing aste, and the special "Laccha Paratha" used to wrap it.

Rolls are pretty good :) 
Chinese is okayish.. 
Two plates of fried rice and chilly chicken @300 is a pretty good deal.. 
Sitting area is comfortable if not cozy very exquisitely decorated.
Service is fast and location is very convenient.

Located nearby "Purna cinema hall". It's is a simple joint, doesn't have any sort of week fabricated set up. Neither does it has any cozy decor. The ambience is also pretty basic, nothing to get you pampered. Having said that, they offer both north Indian and Chinese cuisines, as well as basic fast foods like rolls and all. I have been to this joint once and after tasting their food I was completely surprised. Considering their shabby and dull set up, I was really not expecting their dishes to be so exquisite and perfect. The quantities served was also abundant. The staffs were very courteous and helpful, the service was pretty smooth and the prices are not than reasonable. So if your criteria is to enjoy good quality food in reasonable price and if the ambience and decor doesn't matter to you then this is a perfect place for you.

While this not the best restaurant in the world, as a fast food joint it is definitely quite good. Obviously there is no atmosphere, but the staff are friendly and the quality of food redeems for all it's other faults. Something I could recommend here are the momos which are better than the momos I have had in some of the best restaurants in kolkata. Being pocket friendly as well it should attract more customers than it does.

This is your plain old neighborhood fast food joint masquerading as something bigger. Situated across the road from Purna Cinema Hall, this is a simple eatery which college students head to for fast food. There are a few seats which is a plus. Food is nothing to die for and in the case of more than one item, overpriced. The quality is average. However service is fast. I've never seen more than two customers standing. The egg rolls is the only thing I've ever had from there and I guess all I can say is that the egg was nicely fried.

Chakraborty Tip : There's a grand staircase with wood paneling on the sides...but it doesn't lead to anywhere. There are no seats upstairs. S don't ask.
