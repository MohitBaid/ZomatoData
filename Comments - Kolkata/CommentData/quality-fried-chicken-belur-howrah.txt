Since its location is in a Mall area, it is easier to locate this store. The price of the items are very much reasonable. You can get a Fried Leg Piece at a cost of Rs 40. 
They need to make their service more fast. 
I am almost regular to this place.

"pay for the food not the name" well that's their tagline. Chicken was soft and tender, very cheap prices the interior could use a bit of decoration and seating space.

Quality fried chicken in short qfc the well known place near rangoli mall...
U can compare its chicken drumstick to kfc but still with the cheapest rate its the best fried chicken in belur area... fried chicken leg, chicken wings, chickens popcorn,chicken breast piece... and the best cheese chicken burger... if the place could be big it would be the best place... changes need to be done are the seats...

Don't compare with KFC as they are serving pocket friendly items, but I liked their fried chicken, french fries, burgers. It is fresh and yummmy. Fill your stomach if you are super hungry as well. Must try it. I loved their fried chicken. Perfect crisp and juicy chicken. Quantity is also good.

Quality Fried Chicken, in short QFC.. üòâ
We went there yesterday evening.. We were pretty much satisfied with there quality of food..
We ordered,
#Crispy Fried Chicken Chest
#Crispy Fried Chicken Leg
#Chicken Burger
#Medium French Fries..
The food quality is really well..
The bun of burger is very soft, and the chicken is nicely tender and properly seasoned..
Crispy Fried Chicken is really good.. We didn't expect that much tasty chicken.. It's served with tomato sauce and spoon full mayonnaise..
And the French Fries were also good..
Only cons we have found are, they can serve some more mayonnaise and more lettuce with burgers..
And the ambience is quite okay, exactly like a street corner food stall..
And they have some seating arrangements too..
You can have exactly food like "KFC" in a very pocket friendly and tasty way..
Great experience..
A must visit place.. üëç
