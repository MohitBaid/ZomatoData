It's near to our home, and my mother orders sometime from here. The only time I ordered Chicken Biryani, it was a disaster. The rice got rotten for some reason we couldn't figure out, and we had to throw it away. Other than that incident, we were given fresh and good food.

Ordered Egg chicken chowmein and Biriyani through Zomato home delivery service.The Egg chicken chowmein was slightly better than roadside chowmein with minimum amount of chicken. Biriyani was less Oily which was good and it seems to be cooked in refined oil rather in vanaspati.

Ordered special mutton biryani through swiggy where they were supposed to give 2 pieces of mutton and 2 eggs with biryani rice. What we received was two shabby looking manhandled eggs which were already scrapped to half while shelling rotting and 2 unfortunate pieces of mutton which is not even sufficient for 1 person alone. The onion salad was also rotten. Not at all recomended for online ordering as you cannot see what you might get.

অল্প টাকায় স্বপনযাপন।

বর্তমান পৃথিবীতে মুদ্রাস্ফিতী আর নোটবন্দিতে.. পকেটের

হাল যখন বেহাল। কেও ভাবে না আমার.. আপনার কথা।

ব্লাড প্রেসার বাড়ে অথচ ডিএ বাড়ে না।

বছরের শুরুতে "গোল" ঠিক হয়.. অথচ "এ্যপ্রেশাল" এর সময়

সবি ভূগোল।

সেখানে একপ্লেট চিকেন বিরিয়ানি ৮০ টাকা। তেলহীন সুগন্ধি

একপ্লেট সুস্বাদু বিরিয়ানি । মাঝপাতে এক পিস নধর মাংসল

পিস। পাশবালিসের মত এলায়িত একটা আলু। আর ও ৬

টাকা দিলে একটা সাদা ধবধবে সুসিদ্ধ ডিম ও পেয়ে যাবেন।

সংগে একপ্লেট চিকেন কষা ও নিলাম । একটু তৈলাক্ত আর

দুপিস ষণ্ডামার্কা পিস। ঘন গ্রেভি.. একটু মশলাদার। গ্রেভি

ঢেলে.. বিরিয়ানির সাথে খাওয়া সাক্ষাৎ ঈশ্বরলাভ।

পরে রাধাবল্লভী ও টেস্ট করেছি.. কিন্তু ভাল লাগেনি।

তবে প্রত্যেক পদের অবাক করা কম দাম।

একশ টাকার মধ্যে বিভিন্ন থালি ও পেয়ে যাবেন.. পকেটে এ

একটুও চাপ না দিয়ে।

Ordered Lunch from this place today.Had veg fried rice and boneless chili chicken.Now,let's review it,quality wise the fried rice was average but fresh ingredients,quantity and price wise it was quite generous.The winner was the boneless chili chicken which was really awesome at such cheap price.What I really liked about them was their generosity clubbed with quality consciousness in feeding people.Looking forward to try their other items.

We ordered Mutton Biryani,boondi raita, chicken biryani, Mutton kassa, chicken vorta from here. Mutton biryani was very dry,boondi raita was sour I taste. Chicke vorta was lacking chicken pieces​ Nd only boiled egg tried to fill up the absence of chicken. We tried to find Mutton pieces in Mutton kassa also. Chicken biryani was average Nd quantity was less in comparison to price. Average experience I have.

Prompt service. Decent taste. Good quantity. Pocket friendly. Got nothing to complain about except a dead fly in my dish. Please take care about it the next time maybe?

Quantity and quality at a steal. That is all I can say. The Biryanis are absolutely non oily with two healthy chunks of meat and the option of adding an egg for a few extra bucks. The Kassas (both chicken and mutton) exceeded expectations. Packaging as is the norm these days, was good. The prices were unbelievably, unrealistically low. In today's world, where everything is inflated (the ingenuity too), this was a steal deal. Keep up the good work and I hope you outdo your rivals. Best of luck for the future...

Good service and reasonably priced home cooked food. The thali and the biriyani are really good with large portions served. Very few places have good homemade biriyani and this is a gem in the true sense. Food is light with less oil. Only disappointment was the roti they served. Tasted a bit stale.

So finally found a place at a short distance from my residence with quality food and affordable price. Outlet is quite messy and only available for take away orders. Order over the phone or online is chargeable extra 20% still a value for money. Have tried different combo meal and biriyanis here. Quality and quantity are too good in this price range. Will give it 5 ratings if they have dine in option.

Ordered Egg Chicken Chow and Egg Chops. Both the items were satisfactory in terms of taste, size and quantity at a very reasonable price. So it's a good option when your tummy is in need of low budget good food.

It's a value for money outlet but require a bit portion control, I had a thali today I.e mutton thali from there outlet via swiggy, now talking about the packaging it was greatly packed, no chances were there for spillage, portion was less though for a single pax also. 2items were missing from my plate if I go according to whatever mentioned over there on swiggy menu list. Taste of every food item was good enough, specially the mutton item, I've individually ordered for some gulab jamun and rasgulla, both were great. So thank you
