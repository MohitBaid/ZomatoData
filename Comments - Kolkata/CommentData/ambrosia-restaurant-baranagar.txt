Ordered chicken lollipop with bone and Ambrosia special hakka chowmin from Zomato. Chowmin had ample quantity for two people and tasted satisfactory. Both of the items needed a bit of more salt. Pricing is moderate.

A nice place in the busy baranagar area. I am a regular to this restaurant, maybe due to the lack of quality restaurant in the vicinity. Most of the times, food is fine. 
Chicken duck bungalow, Mixed fried rice in hot garlic sauce are recommended.

Don't go to this place. This place is horrible. The look and feel of this restaurant was much worse than expected. The staff service was not good at all. Any starter which we asked for was either not available or will take around 1hr (like Paneer Tikka and all the other tandoor starters). 
The starters which we ordered were not at all hot and it tasted nothing special. When it comes to main course, the naan and kulcha were dry and the paneer dishes weren't up to the mark when it comes to flavour. The only good thing was Dal Makhani which was above decent. The only good thing was the freshlime soda and ice cream .

I am only giving it 1star because there is no option to give it 0 star.

Almost two years ago I visited this place with my sister after watching a movie.I still remember that the place, situated in a quite area apart from the congested traffic of dunlop. The inside decors of Ambrosia was good. The place was almost empty when we visited,it was around 3.00 pm. The quality and taste of food was satisfying. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab as starter. In main course we had chinese. The waiters were good,and prompt to their service. Though the restaurant had no service tax.

Zomato is providing a great service but I really feel sorry to say that the delivery service of Ambrosia is horrible. I have ordered a full course menu through zomato. The order was not delivered on time. Not even that, the delivery boy was least interested to give us the update as why so late. When I called, the delivery boy constantly refused taking the call and there was no updates given. I didn't receive the order even after 3 hours of ordering the food. Really very frustating indeed and a situation of shame in front of my guests. Extremely poor service although the standard of food is good! Please upgrade your staffs Ambrosia.

I have been going to this place since I was 5 and hence it is very close to my heart. A very old yet great restaurant. I had tasted my life's first chilli chicken here and I am in love with Chinese food still today. It's not that the taste cannot be improved but the food here has its own tastes and I love it the way it is. The restaurant is small yet very cosy. The waiters give a very good service here.

Located about 4/5 mins walking distance from Dunlop crossing this is one of the oldest establishments in the area. I have been there quite a few times and have also taken takeaways. But had felt that the food was not upto the mark. I had given up going there.. Recently through zomato reviews i have come across a few favourable comments.. So i ordered a Ambrosia special hakka chowmien and paneer tikka.. The tikka looked very spicy but was not.. I felt it was a bit bland but came with salad and green chutney.. The chow was really tasty with ample chicken prawn and a poach on it.. It also had prawn papad with it and was delivered at least 15 mins before the stipulated 1 hour.. So i am encouraged to try out their other items.

This shows that at 6pm on 17th aug 2017 :since u could not manage this problem means u r now going to disorient system and moreover it was not in from to the floor level order boy also. After taking the order it was noticed. How horrible? So what we next??????

When the restaurant is nearby our area
It should have been free
Other leading restuarant have the free delivery option if you give a minimum order of 300
Food was really unacceptable
Karai paneer was way to bad 
And the shredded chicken bharta was also not of a good taste

The rice was nice in quantity and the quality of rice was fine too. The fish finger was of 8 pcs for one plate and it was good as well. The delivery time was too much - just these two items took 1 hour to reach our place.

In Dunlop area this is one of the best restaurant, where you can have both lunch and dinner with family/friends. Located just in the by-lanes of Gurudwara at Dunlop. The place is very small with a noisy atmosphere. Yesterday, I went for dinner and ordered for Chicken manchow soup, Egg fried rice and Hot n garlic chicken. I just loved their food and the staffs were very well behaved. Quantity and quality were up to the mark. But one thing I have noticed, the waiters were continuosly loitering near our table, which was little bit awkward from my side.

The place is cozy and small, yet neatly maintained.

Ok so last wk i hv been dere wd my friends nd ordred some food whch was mixed fried rice and black bean chicken, the khana was pretty good bt their staffs???? Oh myyy gosssshhhh ... #badddddddddd ... As the restaurnt was full at that tym so v seat the upper floor of that restrnt nd here lies the problm ws started, v said to dere staffs to switch on the fan again again as the Ac was not workng properly but dey avoid us nd pretndng lyk dey dnt knw d switch board... Ok so jus anyway this matter and lets cum to menu card... The menu/food price which are shown up in the zomato are not similar with the restaurnt menu/food price... Dere food price is totaly different and the prices are actuly high... Dey use a trick to pointing out dat all the taxes are including with the price... Now that my point is wen a person jus took a one item with in 200 den in dat case dere price is good with tax but if a person took 3 or 4 items den the way they charge the price with tax dats not gooooooddddd... Cos if a person took 1 plate of rice nd u have taken rs 195 from him including tax dats okk"!! But wen the customrs took 2-3 items and den u guys r taken high price including tax with each nd every plate den itssss nottttt ok dude!!! Generly in every restaurnt we  pay the norml price den dey add vAT nd taxes means 3items +1 Vat and S.taxes but here u added vat nd s.taxes with every singl item..dats mean 1item wid tax+1item wid +1item wid tax=3 items with 3 TAXES....goosssshhhhhhh pls try to ractify dis..

This is one of those cheap pocket friendly restaurant to order from once in a while..
First and foremost is the price of the items which are quite cheap compared to most of the restaurants..i had food many a times from this restaurant.. and the food is so-so.. altough some of the items are quite tasty..
If your a noodles lover you must try the mix sling chow which is spicy with a lot of prawn, chicken, mushroom and egg pieces.. the quantity is also really good.. 
If you are a rice lover you must try the spcl mix fried rice which is also very spicy and filled with prawn chicken and eggs.. 
As for starters one must try the humpty dumpty chicken which comprises of bonless chicken strips tossed in spicy sauce.. it has a very tangy nd hot taste..
As for the main course dishes most of them are moderately good with not such an exception.. we had tried the lemon honey chicken which was too sweet and lacked the lemon flavour .. also we order garlic prawn which was not very good as far as the flavour goes but the prawn pieces were good...
Overall ambrosia is good restaurant when you are low on cash, but as such not a restaurant to visit a second time..

The location may not be proper, away from the main road. But if you ask the local people, it won't be had to locate.

The interiors have been renovated since the last time I had visited. The ambiance is way better now. 

The staffs are extremely hospitable and helpful.

Now coming to food, we were very hungry, hence went straight to the main course. Ordered Mutton Pulao and Chicken Afghaani. Mutton pulao pieces were too small and the taste was medium. The side dish was yummy, especially the gravy. The size of the chicken pieces was deceptive, covered with layers of cornflour batter. I am still confused if that's how Afghaani chicken pieces are done.

I may come back to try the Chinese dishes someday.

I ordered for the first time from Ambrosia via Zomato on 24th April, 2017. The order consisted of Mixed Fried Rice and Schezwan Chicken. The price I must say is a bit high than its nearby competitors, but I must admit the taste more than makes up for it. The expected delivery time was 60mins but it reached in 45mins with very hot food given that my house is around 2-3 km away from it. Coming to the food, many times I have tasted fried rice which made my tongue very dry and required frequent drinking of water to moist it again, but this time for a change I experienced a very well cooked Fried Rice. The Schezwan Chicken was too spicy for me, but thats how it should be. But it tasted really well, the chickens were well cooked and the flavour was just awesome. All in all a very good experience. I am going with 4/5 ⭐, the one star deducted because there is always room for improvement.

Ordered food yesterday . Moderate food quality compared to pricing. Good packaging.Quick delivery. Need to have train delivery staff as they demand payment on delivery even on pre-paid orders. Had to argue for around 5 minutes with the guy to make him understand that the food is already paid for.

Visited yesterday to celebrate my birthday... It was a dinner arranged by my husband. TO MENTION THE PRIMARY THING FIRST:-
1. Let me inform it's no more in the GROUND FLOOR it has shifted to the FIRST FLOOR of the same building.
2.The PRICE RANGE we see in ZOMATO is old version the NEW PRICE LIST is added with the pictures I added.
Place is good with low lights, clean and well decorated. As it was a weekday night number of people were less. I could see hardly three to four people excluding us.
We ordered:-
1.Chicken kabab 3/5, (1plate=8pieces)
Felt it little hard.
2.Half Chicken Tandoori 4.5/5, (½ plate=2pieces)
Juicy, well grilled, balanced spices, finger licking.
3. Salad. (Satisfactory proportion)
4. Butter Tandoori Roti 2.5/5, (3-4 would be enough for two)
As they were served hot it was soft but till we reached the last one it cooled and became hard to tear)
5.Paneer Butter Masala 4/5, (1plate is ok for two, but as per price quantity could be a little better)
Gravy was awesome, less oily yet spicy to taste wonderful.
6.Chicken Reshmi Masala 3.5/5, (1plate is enough for two)
Tasted awesome but felt salt was little less overall a nice dish.
7.Chicken Butter Masala 4/5, (1plate is enough to serve two)
***The story is the gravy for both the paneer butter masala and chicken butter masala tasted same, I felt they cook the gravy for common use and just adds the paneer or chicken in a separate utensils as per order then reheat and serve. Taste wise it's good again.
And finally to wash it down we order:-
Masala Soda. ( Nice to taste, refreshing as well)
The bill was nearly around 1200/- to 1300/- as my husband paid it I am not sure about the exact amount...
*** WHAT I FELT UNPLEASING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS AS FOLLOWS:-
1. The service men were continuously revolving around our table which was a bit awkward as we wanted some privacy while eating.
2. They were continuously visiting our table and asking for the next order before we could finish one.
3. Keeping a keen eye on the customers which was so awkward that we couldn't even talk to each other and felt like finishing the food and going out.
4. While we entered the place we were unaware of the proportions they serve so we ordered little at a time as we didn't wanted to waste food. But it seems a huge funny thing for them as if we were moneyless.
Food was a good experience here....

Have eaten at this place a number of times now. The place has an Oriental décor even though it serves both Chinese and Mughlai cuisines. It's located near Dunlop Bridge and has a cozy, warm ambience. The food, whether Chinese or Mughlai, is quite impressive. Especially recommend the Afghani Kebab and the Chicken Pulao for their unique preparations. In Chinese, the Triple Schezhwan Fried Rice is a fantastic and wholesome dish. The starters, especially the Crispy Chilli Baby corn, are usually cooked to perfection.

This is located in a calm cozy area near Dunlop. If you go towards Dunlop Bata from main road you have to take second left lane from Bata store. Very low lighting and a cover of around 40 heads. It's a multucuisine restaurant but interior is totally a Cantonese interior. Waiters were quite prompt to take the orders. We had to wait for 15 minutes for a dish of lollypop. Meat was fresh and served hot with dips. In main course we had zeera rice and butter masala fish. Both were ok. Waiter did not understand the difference between green salad and normal salad. Need to upgrade.

A nice restaurant in chaotic dunlop crossing area. You have to go a little bit inside from the main road. 
Lot of dishes they are offering from Indian and chinese cuisines. Decor and lighting is simple. 
Ambience could have been better. Service is not so quick but not so lazy also. 
Coming to food, taste was good. We had;
chicken tikka kabab - 8 pieces of soft morsels of boneless chicken. Mildly spicy. The mint sauce was good compare to other restaurants.
Chicken 65 - chicken fried to crisp and served with curry leaves toppings.
Mix sezwan noodle - Enough portion for two person. Good amount of prawns and chicken can be found in the dish. Satisfied!
Garlic fish - traditional chinese dish with indian style. Liked the garlic flavored gravy which was good to go with the noodle. 
We enjoyed the food with coke and fresh lime soda.

Overall verdict - 3.5/5

Its a recommended restaurant in this locality. Try!

just worst. I went yesterday (7th January 2017). orderd Prawn Hakka Chowmin (Rs. 190/) and Garlic Fish ( Rs. 235/) and one Masala Kulcha ( Rs. 65/). Quantity is not up to the mark. Bad smell coming from the Prawn Chowmin. The Garlic Fish was not fresh. Masala Kulcha was cold. Behaviour of the staff  was not satisfying. The place is situated very near to DUNLOP GURUDWARA. Near by resturant is "ANIR". I am totally disappointed...

Fish fry is okay. Veg spring roll and pan fried chicken momo are good. Chicken hariyali and Chinese item like garlic fish is also good. Good Indian as well as Chinese food.

In this area, according to my opinion, this is one of the few restaurants where u can have lunch or dinner with family or friends. The ambiance is good. Service is good also. Ordered chicken tandoori, fried rice, chowmein, and some chicken dish (forgot the name😛). All the dishes tasted good.. especially the tandoori chicken.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Again visited. Ordered sweet lime soda, soup, reshmi kebab, malai kebab, chicken pulao, chicken prawn fried rice, sweet and sour fish and garlic prawn. Malai kebab was a bit sweet i did not like the outside cover of the kebab. But the kebab was yummy. The sweet lime soda was not that good but all the other preparations were very tasty.

Decent restaurant to have usual foods. Their special gravy noodles, chilli fish, momos and chicken roasts are good. In fact, I have ordered chicken roast for home delivery at least 10 times. It's damn tasty. Though, once I visited the restaurant with a friend on an occasion and ordered for roasts, but they refused it :'( may be because it takes some time to cook, and they were wanting their seats to be vacant asap. Staffs are cordial and friendly. Overall, a good restaurant to visit in Dunlop/Rathtala area.

We should not compare this restaurant with multinational Chinese restaurants. It's unique with its spread. 
Few parameters;
Quantity of food =good
Quality of food average = average
Milieu of restaurant = good
Service quality = poor

Areas of improvement:
First delivery+soothing Music

Additional;
Must start serving low alcohol content beer.
Mocktails at least.

Whole world z changing.. Ambrosia should also change.

I visit this restaurant often. Though it is situated in a noisy place like Dunlop, once you step into Ambrosia, you will notice that it's a quiet place. The ambience is good.
I always order Crispy Spicy Baby Corn as starter. Its finger likin' good 😉 and I can't ever stop wanting more. Paneer tikka is okay.
My Favourite in main course is Handi Paneer. It tastes delicious. Add Butter Naan or Stuffed Kulcha to your order with Handi Paneer, they're pretty satisfying too !

PS : I also love the tiny tortoise that they've kept in the aquarium. 😊

This restaurant is located close to my friend's house near Dunlop Bridge..Went there last night to have a casual dinner..The place is decently decorated and well maintained..nothing significant or extravagant in the ambience..soft slow bengali tunes playing in the background..comfortable seating arrangements..What impressed me at this place is the Service and Hospitality..Impeccable and can actually compete with any established names on this aspect..Apart from it I found the food to be pretty ordinary and commonplace..nothing to exclaim..The food is decent, conventional Indian and Chinese fares,but I found out that the pricing is a bit obnoxious,way to high given the locality being a middle-class one..Still I would prefer the Chinese over the Indian dishes as the portions are satisfactory and taste is near authentic Indo-Chinese..We ordered Crispy Fish, Prawn Pakoda, Mixed Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken..The Crispy Fish was the best of the lot.. juicy,succulent and fresh..The Pakoda and Fried Rice were pretty commonplace and taste ordinary..Hunan Chicken was good enough, balanced flavours,medium spiced and consists of shredded pieces of chicken..Overall its a good options for foodies in and around Dunlop region but cetrianly not recommended for any special meal..Our total cheque comes to Rs.1300/- approx (incl tax) for 4 people..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 2.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Ambrosia has been a saviour in many occasions. Sudden guests at home,  and a quick service from them, saved my day.  The ambience is very homely, and good.  Services of the staffs are also prompt.  The food quality is excellent. I must say,  it has never failed me in any occasion. Thank you. :-)

Ordered online, the food delivered was pretty warm and well packed. Ordered two egg chicken noodles and a schezwan fish. The quantity was quite satisfactory. Now coming on to the quality, the noodles was mildly thick, the taste was okay, a flavour rich of spring onions and oyester sauce, enough amount egg and chicken. The schezwan fish was the one I liked more.
The price is okay, but the tax levied was undesirable. Having said that, it's perhaps one of the better Chinese available in the northern fringes of the city!

Yesterday we had chicken tandoori and chicken tikya masala. It was yummy and authentic. And that to delivered at home. So you have a craving just go through the menu and call ambrosia, rest they will take care. But remember your bill should be more than 400 plus 30 for the person for who brings the warm food to your home.

It is one of the few places where they have bettered their game...very good food in both indian , desi and Chinese. .I was particularly surprised to find that the chicken in oyster sauce was actually very tasty ..The ambience is secluded and is ideal for people who want a little privacy and food at amicable prices. .try it on and let me know

From the outside it looks like an unimpressive little place so we were apprehensive going in. Once inside, we realised the place may be small but it's clean and cozy.
About the food... it's quite good actually. I've been here a number of times and always end up ordering Hong Kong Chicken among other dishes... it's that good! The last time we ate, we also ordered Schezwan Chicken, Chicken noodles, Mushroom Noodles, Butter naan and Malai Kofta. The quantity is good, and evn though the waiter will say that it is less and you need to order two plates... don't trust them. Over all, it's a good place to have a quick eat-out with friends... not a place for a fancy dining.

Just near to my house. I generally go there every month and I have been doing this since 15 years. :) Oh yes, 15 long years. They have maintained the same quality of their food all this while. Chicken Noodles, Manchurian, Chilly Chicken, Butter Chicken, Chicken Bharta, Butter Naan, Paneer Butter Masala and lots more. You name it and they will bring you the best they can. Nice atmosphere. All the people out there in Dunlop and Belghoria Area, are pretty much aware of their class. Bored with the daily meals at home, want to have a decent Chinese and North Indian food near Dunlop and Belghoria, Ambrosia is the only place. Pretty much within budget. Kudos!

If the idea is dining out with family, perhaps there is no better a place in and around Dunlop more. To start with there is a healthy ambience, quality vs quantity is finely balanced. Tried both mughlai and Chinese cuisine on separate occasions and wasn't disappointed. The food pleased my taste buds as well as my appetite. It is not actually a college hangout place, and is better suited as a luxury dining. The only demerit is its location, which makes it difficult for a person new to the place.
P.S.- Never go in afternoon, less customer and one too many people to provide service makes it quite uncomfortable 😜.

It was an awesome experience to have a dinner in ambrosia restaurant. It was a very hot day, I was with my brother..both of us were hungry and we found a bit difficult to find the place.
At last we found it. The cold environment of the restaurant becoming very much pleasurable to us. The dim light, beautiful decorations,comfortable chair..all of these are deserve admiration.
Now coming to the foods. We ordered mix korean rice and chicken malai kabab,chicken dak banglo,crispy fried fish...
These items are really awesome. Specifically the mix korean rice and crispy fried fish I really loved these items.
Quality as well as quantity both are good. Price is also reasonable.
I must visit this restaurant to taste the other food items in future...:-)

It was a 4.5/5 about 15 years ago. Now its a ghost of it's old self. It however is still one of the few restaurants that serve decent food. It has great and inexpensive Chinese food. As a local, my friends and I frequented this place and thoroughly loved it! It was the best Chinese restaurant in the whole Baranagar, Belghoria, Sodepur, Barrackpore, etc. Now not so much. The last time I went there was a few months ago and the service and the set up depressed me quite a bit. The food was okay at best. Price was okay too for the portion size. I do not recommend this place if you have a choice.Food 3/5, Service 1.5/5, Portion 3/5, Price 3/5, Location 2.5/5

Now this is my first review on zomato and what can be a better place other than this to write my first review. I am dining in ambrosia for last 15 years at least. I love this place for its chinese. I feel this can compete with any park street restaurant (might be a little exaggeration due to nostalgia but just a little). Chilly chicken & chopsuey is a must try. Service is very good except on sundays(due to heavy rush). Ambience also has improved a lot(I miss the old ambrosia still). So over all a big thumbs up for this value for money restaurant.

I was surprised with the fact that this restaurant charges tax.Upper hand goes to five rivers.:)

Poor Chinese. 
Ordered egg fried rice, veg noodles, chicken manchurian and a dry boneless chicken. The food was served hot, service was ok too. But coming to the food..it was very poor with respect to a Chinese meal. The best I found among the above mentioned 4 items was only boneless dry chilli chicken. Noodles was very bad and so do rice. They were cooked and over colored by extra soya sauce. Wish a better chinese cooking for the next time as I might have to visit again there being situated close to my office.

I have visited the restaurant 2 times and its near my place. The first time I went there, the food was okay types and that was a year before. Recently, me and my parents decided to visit it again and I am really sorry to say I had a very regretful experience . We had to share a table with another family and that's okay, but the food we ordered were just average , can't even rank them as good. The kebab we ordered had so much of smokey smell in it that we could not eat it full. Later, we ordered Chinese and wanted to get it packed as we couldn't finish it , and the waiter over there mixed our packing with that of the other family's packing. We had veg fried rice and a Chicken Manchurian the other family had chicken fried rice and chicken dry something, we after coming home saw the mishap, as it is not possible to check every little bit when u go to a restaurant for dinner and get your dinner packed, we had their food packed instead of ours, and seriously speaking they can not handle crowd and deal with the customers properly, I have been there two times and every time i saw they are kind of struggling dealing with customers at the time of rush, its a very regular restaurant with not so quality food but at high price, we were so disgusted that we complained the next day by calling them and they did not utter a word. Bitter experience , must say.

After that I was served veg polao instead of mutton polao. And how bad it was! Some low quality basmati rice floating over oil. Same quality with chicken afghani also. Also there was severe mismanagement between stuffs. The couple next to us were served cold foods. Won't go again there.

This place is not exactly the classy Chinese restaurant which you would expect however situated in almost a corner of Dunlop area is this absolute culinary paradise. It is an excellent place for eating Chinese if you are of the type who loves to gorge on food yet are not bothered with the dainty outlook of the restaurants. It is almost a small shack like thing however the items which they serve are absolutely mind blowing. My personal favourite of this place is the Fried rice and the Chilli chicken. It is very often we order food from this place and consume them. I would definitely love to eat from this place again and again and i always give this place a thumbs up!

This place is near to my home right at Dunlop. The spread is typical of a resturant serving Chinese and Indian food. Nothing fancy but the quality of food is good. Try the Special Mixed fried as they give an insane amount of add-ons to say mushrooms,prawns chicken and egg with the rice and cost is very pocket friendly. Also recommended is the Hong Kong Chicken and the Manchurian fish. The one dish I find fault with is  the Ginger Chivken. The dish lacks the heat and kick at the bavk of the pallette as is expected. Though cliched dishes ,this restaurant notches it up a bit with a few little twists. The portions per serving is good for two so no complaining there. Also the home delivery service is pretty effective and fast.

This was our favorite hunt for Chinese food in our college days. Still I believe they serve some best Chinese dishes like sing chow, american chopsuye, garlic prawn, Hakka noodles etc in that region. if one stays nearby give it a try at least once.

Been there a few days back... Parking is an issue in case of 4 wheelers... Ambience is so so... Prices and the service time are on the higher side and in case you are light on lunch and planning a heavy dinner, prices can shoot to 400 and above. Most importantly though, most of the delicacies are quite yummy, especially Chicken Afghani and the Chicken Mughlai...

Regular visiter of this particular restaurant in Dunlop area...n it never disappoints.. Whether its Indian or mughlai or Chinese cuisine..last month went for lunch n ordered chicken Manchurian , egg fried rice n chicken spring roll.. Although they take a lil more than normal time to serve but the waiting is worth as food they serve really tastes yum. Clearly the best outlet in this region. From ambience service standard n everything. Price bit on the higher side compared to other outlets in nearby area..but thy r superior than the rest in all deptts ....

The Description: its in Dunlop. Deep inside the road. I went there pretty long ago.. 

The Ambience: Just as i remember place a bit small and cosy.... dim lights with A.c

The Food: Remembering about the food so i had Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken... The Rice was nice and tasty. disappointed with the chilly chicken a bit. But overall Food was good.. 

The Conclusion: Ambrosia is a renowned franchise  thou many of it are not upto the mark..

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

I am a frequent foodie of this place,  just cause if its near my house.  The food is great,  but its feels like its been less quality than before,  service is ok though.  Been here many times with family. And with my friends too.  But prob is seems like there's menu is not much flexible.  Over the time many items quality and quantity both have shrank down to minimum.  Otherwise for the locality urs way better than any other.

We went there on a rainy  afternoon.So we had umbrellas with us.They asked us to put those outside the foodjoint. They did not even provide us a chair so we were compelled to put those on the ground. That was a bit annoying.

 Well, entering the restaurant , we sat and one came to ask us whether we wanted mineral water or regular, with the menu.

 We went for mixed fried rice ( Taste was good, but unshelled prawns made us unhappy. The black chords of back were not being removed of some prawns. So 3/5 ) and garlic chicken ( bland taste , gravy with small pieces of garlics, skin of some garlics were not even removed ! So 2/5 ).

Ambiance was cosy and neat.People were decent, though they brought our bill after 5-7 mins of asking while a few were roaming around at that time.They should be well organised.

Over-all,trying once is okay.

Food quality is good if you dine in. However if you parcel food for home they serve stale food or left over from previous day. Home delivery service is very bad due to poor quality of food..

Have been going there since my childhood days..Ambrosia at Baranagar has been in great business for more than  15 years.They provide quick and efficient service with amazing quality food.Its worth a visit.Their chinese delicacies stands out as it is extremely tasty.The mughlai section has a Indianised version of the dish Chicken 65,which is quite different and much appreciated!!

I have visited this place two times.. It is situated @ Dunlop, near Gurudwara. the ambiance of this place is very fine. The decoration of this place is eye relaxing. The service is very good and mainly those who are behind this servicing they are very polite. The quality of food is also good. You can have Indian as well as Chinese also.  When I had made the order some of the items were unavailable. A nice place to eat with your family and friend in this area.

Ambience is Ok. Food is ordinary if you judge by authentic Chinese culinary, but considering the locality it is decent. One dislike is its location. It is located inward from B.T.Road, you need to search and walk for 5 mins.

I had my dinner at Arsalan today, on my way back home i got a call from mom, She told me to bring a soup and chilli chicken on the way home. So i stopped over at Ambrosia and ordered a Hot & Sour Chicken Soup along with a Boneless Chilli Chicken.
The Order arrived in about 20 minutes, the staff was polite & courteous when i inquired about my order.

The feedback i got at home was, the Soup was great but the Chilli Chicken lacked in taste, the chicken was a little tough and gravy a lot runny. So i checked the chicken myself and found that it was indeed a little under cooked. Ambrosia is like a hit and a miss joint. There are a few items on the menu which are great and some just don't get better.

Started my day at Banana Leaf, then dinner at Arsalan but the last take away left me wanting for more...

Very tasty chicken at reasonable cost. Overall the taste was really nice and delivery was in time and decent packing.
Second time decided to visit the place rather than ordering food home and turned out to be a fair decision as the food was obviously good and so was the ambiance. 
Service too is nice and the cost is also decent, not so cheap but not too costly as well. 
One of the best food joints around Dunlop.

Though I have an unplanned visit this place earlier, but yesterday me & my wife made a planned visit there, & I must say We are really happy for our choice. Now I will review on  three points about the place.

Ambience: It pretty good, not to dark not to lit. Staffs are extremely cordial, best after Bar-Q Nations so far for me. Sitting arrangements though some mixed & match but OK.

Food: We have order TomYum soup, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Mixed Korean Rice & Garlic Chicken. Soup is really good but they have used little bit extra ginger in it than required (atleast to us), but use of lemon grass is absolute brilliant , so in my advise if you order this soup, which you should atleast once, ask them not to use ginger that much. Reshmi Kabab & Garlic Chicken are good, but noting to be excited. But the real star is Korean Rice. I am surely going to order this next time, its really amazing, should not miss. So overall food is really good. Oh I forgot to mention, we have ordered mix-cola which is not that good, it's so-so.

Price: The whole food cost us ~800 which is not that high considering quality of food.

Overall: Finally in a location like Dunlop, which is not close to Kolkata, its a good restaurant to go.

Location - It is located nearby to the mighty Dunlop Gurudwara. From the Gurudwara on your left, its just about 5-7 minutes walk. You will be able to see a big board saying "Ambrosia".

I have been a frequent visitor to this place since my school days. It has always been a wonderful experience here. The decor is decent with a famous aquarium, they possess a prized tortoise which is a huge attraction amongst the children and the adults alike. 

Today I paid a visit at Ambrosia for a lunch with family. We were 6 people. The servers greeted us nicely and helped us get a 8-seater table. We ordered 2 mixed fried rice, 1 chicken fried rice, 2 mixed hakka chow, 1 schezwan chicken, 1 chicken manchurian, 2 butter nuns and 1 chicken bharta(shredded).
The order was delivered at the table within 7-8 minutes of waiting. The rice was very nicely cooked with good proportions of chicken,prawn and eggs. The chow was also served hot and was yummy. On the side dishes the manchurian was prepared with adequate spices and also the chicken pieces were decent sized. On the other hand the schezwan tasted spicy and brought tears to my ma's eyes :D I favoured the nun , it was full of butter ( woww ) . The chicken bharta was also very nicely cooked with nicely shredded chicken and a half egg. It was topped by some butter as well :)

The bill was pocket friendly as well. It was just 1500/- :)

P.S. I would like to draw attention to the management that since I ordered North Indian dishes so I expected them to provide wash bowls which they didnt. This is one place where you guys should take care of. Otherwise you people are just lovely. A must recommended. 

Enjoy :)

One of the mostly visited restaurants I went with my family and friends.. Small and cozy place that serves tasty food in budget. For a small dine out plan Ambrosia is definitely a good solution to the locales here. Considering that no such great restaurants are there, Ambrosia caters the need of the customers really well. More than that the food they serve is really tasty and the quantity is good too. I have loved their Indian section always. The taste is well balanced.

Ambrosia...is the best restaurant in Dunlop area. They server very good quality of food from the beginning of time. I am a frequent visitor of this restaurant and they never disappoint me. Their service is well and foods are really tasty. The only hitch is service tax and vat is huge. So I prefer to take the parcel from them. They also offer home delivery of food.

Last time I ordered chicken fried rice, chilly chicken, chicken bhorta, chicken soup. Each items are good and tasty.

Located in an alley near the Dunlop crossing this restaurant is a decent place for dining in the locality.The place offers Indian and Chinese dishes mainly.The food is quite tasty.The Chinese dishes I found better than the Indian ones.The prices are quite reasonable but is slightly higher than the other eateries around the locality.The quantity of the food is also quite decent.The place can accommodate about 15 people.There is nothing special about the ambience.It has good air conditioning.The space inside is quite small and the tables are bit too close to each other.The service is quite slow.Overall if you are looking for a place to dine around the locality this is one of the few options you can try more because of the lack of good restaurants in the area than because of the quality of the place.

Eating food of this restaurant may be for more than 15 years. And since from the day 1, it's food quality and taste will easily beat any of the five star hotel restaurants. The location of the hotel is at very calm area, it's true but it's food is unmatched to anywhere else.

Ambrosia....near Dunlop area....is an infringement of the term what people would prefer to refer as eatery....the place is dark, clumsy and silent like hell....puts you in a confusion whether to eat here or just leave the place right on....people serve food like as if they are in a refugee camp...hovering around and looking for less communication....most of the food in the menu is either unavailable or will take eons to cook....I took , with lot of thinking...the most common rice with chilly chicken....after having greatest displeasure...and grievance....I decided to give...a negative recommendation....for the followers....and this review was only to express the same....thank you..

This is the fist resturant that I am rating 5.0. 

I have had at many restaurants both in Kolkata and Bangalore. I rate this as the best of the lot. Better than Veeks and Thomas, Ammi`s Biriyani and Bejing Bites of Bangalore and Peter Cat, Arsalan and Bar B Q from Kolkata.

Whats special about this place?? 

Ans : Its FOOD.

Really tasty and well prepared dishes you will get. The chinese is a tand out. Even though its Indian Chinese yet its too good. Go for the crispy baby corn and the soup. They are truly amazing. The noodles are also equally good. The lemon chicken and the manchurian is the way it has to be. 

In the indian section please do go for the pulao. Its authentic and super tasty. You can get a whiff of sweetness in the food. Every thing is made to perfection.

The only let down is the dessert. Else the best I have tasted.

Please go ahead and try it yourself :).
