This restora is like 5 years old or more and is very popular in belgharia. Its located beside (dunlop/rathtala) auto stand near belgharia station to be very precise. The ambiance is not good, so I prefer take away. Annapurna's food is very tasty no doubt, but it can be improved. In any occasion we order food from them. The staffs are very well behaved. Surprisingly, if you go there after 7pm to buy food, you have to stand in the queue. Keep it up.

Place: Just beside the Belgharia Railway Station. 

Ambience: Sitting capacity is for around 30 people, but actually majority people prefer to take away hone. 

Food: From Tandoor, Biriyani to selective Chineese, they have many items in thei menu. But for the thing it is much popular in the surrounding area is for their homely bengali items for meals. "Taste wise outstanding" - I shall not tell so, but if you're around belgharia station and finding a place to have bengali meal in reasonable cost but in a good way than the road side eateries then this place is definitely a perfect option for you.

Apt for a quick meal, as they have really fast service.A variety of options are available, mainly from Chinese and Indian cuisines. Both sitting and takeaway options are there. Location wise,it is at a very convenient place, very close to Belghoria Station. So if you land up in Belghoria station, and want to have a quick snack or a full meal, Annapurna Restaurant is one that can absolutely come to your rescue. Though there are other much better restaurants in Belghoria, but still Annapurna deserves a try.

This place is near the Belghoria Station auto stand. Expect basic shared seating and pocket friendly prices. Not for hygiene conscious people. Service is clumsy and slow.
We ordered for a plate of steamed chicken momo and half plate chicken tandoori. Momo unfortunately was not available. The chicken tandoori looked and tasted good. Though the chicken was not soft enough, the overall experience was decent.
If you are around and want a pocket friendly place Annapurna will satisfy you. But don't expect anything fancy. Will return to try more.

it is situated in belghoria station area... the place is very crowdy. and the hotel is very small. not a good ambience for hang out at all.. though I have rated 3.5 because their food quality is very good.. I tried their momo, special biriani, mixed fried rice, paneer butter masala and each item is good in taste.. so we buy their food and take it to home

This Hotel is very Pocket friendly snacking/dining place. The ambience is not good. Dont try to go there in this hot summer time, you'll be boiled inside. The food is quite good. Mixed chowmein, rumali roti and laccha parota is a must try here. In zomato it is given that u'll have to spend 300 for 2, but food is not that much expensive, For normal hangout it is cheaper than that. Service is also very quick. Forget to mention, try their rolls and chicken dishes too..

Well.. its 10 am tuesday.. was searching through zomato a cheaper restaurants & saw this 1.. as i have never been there so ranged to get the details of orders that can b placed.. for all those who r eager to place any order in early morning as said this by the owner, can not get anything else than chilli chicken or fired rice only if u r willing to order for 2 or 3 ppl.. other cousins r getting ready & wont even b ordered before 12 noon minimum.. so after hearing ao what i can guess is that if other cousins r yet to b made then how come they can deliver the order of chili chicken or fried rice so early..
Now as we all kno the pakoras of chilly chicken is the main part that took time to get prepared, rest can b easily done as its a fast process.. same as fried rice...
So that means somehow its proven that they keep the past days pakoras in fridge & cook those to make the cousin...
If u ppl r fresh lovers & u want some fresh thing to get delivered to u then u have to visit the restaurant after 2 pm then also j dont think the throw away the basi stuffs to serve u the fresh..

This is one of my favourite restaurants in Belgharia/Rathtala area. The foods they provide are cheap in price, but delicious in taste. The place is re-decorated recently. Now it looks awesome. I recommend people having their special mughlai paratha. It is very yummy. :)

One of the best food eataries around this area.Takeaway is the best option though. Good food with  good taste. The food served during lunch and dinner  also is worth mentioning other than normal items that are food in any food joint.

Though it is recently added in zomato..I'm an old customer of this restaurant..I want to say directly about it's foods..without discussing abt ambiance or decoration..becoz people come here only for it's good foods..the prices are also very much reasonable. I have tried many items of this restaurant..like kashmiri polau,chicken varta, chicken kasha,tandoori roti, paneer butter masala,chicken leg butter masala..etc..bt my favorites are kashmiri polau and chicken leg butter masala..these are really awesome..I request you to attain this restaurant at least once..

Dull interiors. I visited this place once after hearing of their naans and chicken preparations.  Food quality is good. They use lot of spices. Tap water served for drinking purposes. On my first visit, I started losing love for food.
