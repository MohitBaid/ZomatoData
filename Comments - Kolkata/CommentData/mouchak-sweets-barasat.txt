This shop used to be the best shop in the vicinity...
As the shop started getting popular, their services dropped, they give a damm about customer. 
Highly dissapointing.

Very bad... They don't give chatni with the samosas if u don't buy more than 4...rough behavior... 
Moreover the prices of sweets r too much...
