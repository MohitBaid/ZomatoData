Its about half an hour drive from the city. 5 mins from Shatragachi Station. The restaurant inside the hotel is very impressive. Classy decor and finger licking food. Had both lunch and dinner coz i stayed in the property for a day. Biriyani was nice. Quality of Continental food was amazing. In the evening i had buffet which was again very impressive. The breakfast buffet is also mentionable as they serve variety of juices, cold cuts, eggs to order and south Indian Cuisine.
Thank you management and keep up the good work.

Location of Lake Land Country Club is quite remote, but once you reach there, you won't complain.The place is nice for recreational purposes.There are several restaurants, one of them being Zodiac.
The ambiance of Zodiac is nice,elegant, and vibrant. We ordered Chinese. The food was good both in quality and quantity. 
The lady in Red Gown among the mocktails is worth a special mention.
We had a lovely time there. Will, definitely, love to go back there.

We had the buffet there. The starters were really scrumptious and yummy. Though I liked the veg part of the main course, the non veg part was not impressive. Desserts consisted of only Ice cream and Rabdi with jalebi. They have a decent collection of wine. Service was good. Staffs were really polite.  The ambience was calm and peaceful. Looked beautiful at night.

Good ambience with a peaceful surrounding. The chicken curry and the bhapa maach in mustard gravy was amazingly delicious. The overall food presentation and taste is good.

Good !!! About the food it is just good. About location? Huhhh ...it is on Kona Expressway....the resort is awesome, & the stay experience is also nice. I went there for a 2 day seminar cum lunch & dinner, since it was entirely sponsored by my office hence I only enjoyed.
Now come to the food, we got buffet meals...I dont know whther they have buffet or they arrange it for corporate sector. Anyway, the breakfast was good there are choice of meals...u can have tea or coffee along with breads with butter or luchi tarkari, or pancake with honey or south indian foods...anything, even fresh cut seasonal fruits, pulpy fruit juices along with Yogurt, lassi, dahi, desrts even methi sarbat also (OMG !!!).

The lunch & the dinner, well there were typicall indian dishes, cooked well but the taste was average, but the number of foods in lunch & dinner are a bit less rather than the breakfast.

Anyway since the resort is good to stay hence I like the food place anyhow :)   .

Went there with a coupon from a popular site for dinner with family. Initial glitches were there regarding the package but once that was sorted, it was a great experience. We were offered an upgrade to buffet which was initially not included in the package. However the buffet spread was good, specially the Bhapa Maach and Butter Chicken. The Naans were soft and the daal makhani tasted authentic. Extremely polite and helpful staff made our dinner a nice experience.
Highly recommended for an evening out :)

CLEAN AS u can get overlooking the swimming pool. Just besides the bar the restaurant  inside Fortune Panchwati is just great. Tasted everything from breakfast to dinner and overall rating is good. The menu mentioned here is also one which you will find in the room but the Chefs of Zodiac has different aces up his sleeve. The bengali pulao, FISH PATURI, CUTLET is also available on order and its better than those mentioned in the Menu. Breakfast is a combination of Indian and continental with alu parantha , sausages , ham, and sprouted vegetables on the platter. A person is always round the corner waiting for you the give him order either to cook a masala omlete or a plain omlette. South India Breakfast items like Dosa and sambar are also quite palatable. The lunch is a usually amix of Indian cusines whereas  Dinner are a combination of Indian and chinese Like manchurian, noodles, kala jamun . Breakfast will cost you around 400 inclusive of taxes but the menu is well laid out  and the experience is just right. At night its better to for the Chinese Items which are easily digestible. Overall a wonderful experience and looking for my next visit hopefully my zodiac sign will show me the way.

Visited Fortune Park Panchwati for a office party. We were charged rs3000 each. Being an ITC partner one expects quality and finesse. It was all amiss. Granted the location is secluded but its difficult to enjoy a location with bland breakfast. The poori sabji was bland. You can't go wrong with idli. You can with sambhar. And they did. Papaya and a few beans floating around was all we got. The lunch was justified just because the salad was good and the fish was edible. 100+ veg colleagues were left flabbergasted with the saltless daal, bland paneer and cold indian bread. They served choc ice cream with forks and spoons. Gosh..an ITC partner does not have a ice cream scoop for serving? The same items were reheated and served for dinner. Overall a horrible experience. Please avoid.

Though many people don't know about this place only because of the distant location but this place I must tell you is a very nice place. It gonna give you more than you expect, really. Place is no doubt very well. It deserves 5/5. Ambience is same. But fooding and serving, i wish i could give 10/5. Really. I am so overwhelmed by their hearty service. People are so nice here. You can go here with your family, friends or for a date. This place suits for all occasions. Food is no doubt very delicious. Continental they make very good. Please try the coffee here. Its a must. I never had such a super coffee anywhere. Coffee was the best. Overall it was a very nice experience with my loved ones. You guys didn't let me down. Thanks ?

The breakfast is decent- the Indian part is good, the continental breakfast is so-so. The spread wasn't all that great, and the bacon was a little under cooked.

The lunch was okay- the chicken was a little chewy and fish wasn't great. Overall, not-so-great.
