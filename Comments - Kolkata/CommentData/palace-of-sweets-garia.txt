Been here once or twice. 
Sometimes the sweets did turn out to be stale and sometimes they were fresh too. Taste one if you don't want to risk it.
Price wise it's okay, but if it's stale it's a waste of money. 
Avoid kheer sweets without tasting since they go bad very fast(not their fault) and you might get sick!

Extremely average taste of products. The shop seemed newly constructed. Dustbins are filthily kept open. Prices are at par with the best shops of the city like Balaram Mullick or Kamdhenu. Not a place which will be a place of choice for bengalis. Variety is there but not something to die for.

Good sweets and snacks for people around Baishnabghata Patuli Township area.  Though seems to be a bit costly with respect to the quality. Need to take care of that..
