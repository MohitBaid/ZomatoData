Another random try from Swiggy.I was craving for some grilled sandwiches really badly and this place came up on the suggestion.Ordered for an egg grilled sandwich and a chicken grilled sandwich.Both of them kind of had the same salad base filling of mayo,ketchup, cucumber,tomato and onion all chopped up,for one sandwich it was mixed with chicken and the other was egg.Not much fan of those mauo base salad sandwiches.Another thing which I hated was they use scrambled egg in sandwiches.No one uses scrambled egg for egg salad sandwiches.The sandwiches did not inpress me and for sure I am not going to give this another try.

Well, with an outlet or two opening every other day @ the posh Sector V Saltlake region, one will definitely look for a reason or two to visit Ritesh café.

But, fret not, you got not one or two – but several reasons to do so!

We might have heard of the Domino’s delivery promise of a 30 minutes or free – but we definitely have never heard of a “You don’t like, we replace it for free” promise from anyone – Have we?

And yes – this is what these guys really do! Their prime motive is to ensure that no customer leave their café unsatiated! You don’t often find the captain of an outlet so focussed on meeting customer preferences, especially, when they are offering products ranging to as low as 15 bucks.

Yes, you can definitely visit them for a typical fast-food meal – tasty maggi noodles / crispy grilled sandwiches / pastas – accompanied with hot and cold beverages.

I opted for their veg grill sandwich, which was superbly grilled and served along with some mustard and tomato sauces. It had decent onion, capsicum and other veg content along with cheese - was definitely high on taste as well as presentation, but what I admire most is the personal interaction by the owner – Ritesh! Let there be scores of customers at his café, and still, he give equal preferences to all the orders and all his customers!

In a nutshell, expect good food and great service at peanut prices at a location easily accessible - the Omega Building in Sector 5, Saltlake - nearby the RDB Cinemas.

Thy café is recommended for your noodle / sandwich / pasta lunch as well as the 4 baje waali bhookh (evening snacks).
