I dont know why its rating is so low on zomato. Consider this.. its the only place that i know of in kolkata that dsnt use any oil in their food. Their rolls are delicious. Their kebabs awesome. When you are a combination of a fitness freak and a foodie , you will be lucky to find such a place in your neighbourhood. Lets just say that i dont have to wait for my cheat day to visit this place. I discovered this place by chance and kept going back

The place has lovely food. Specially the rolls way different. The food they make is fresh. It's not at all very costly ... It's pocket friendly... good quality and quantity ... Way different from regular restaurants...

Ordered the chicken labadar tikka. The price is extremely reasonable considering quality and quantity . The tikka came with rice and salad.  The rice had a nice burnt garlic taste and the chicken was well cooked and moist . Would definitely visit this place again

A small joint situated near AE market. Small with few tables and chairs. Primarily an open restaurant.

FOOD:
They took a lot of time to prepare the food.
Kulcha was disappointing. The filling was absolutely dry. It was the nearly same filling that is used in "tepa kochuri". There were no veggies inside. The crust was too thick. It felt like i was eating a lump of atta.

Mushroom and Paneer was ok. Pieces were good enough. But the curry didn't taste very good.

Chicken reshmi masala was decent. Nothing special.

PRICE:
Prices of all the curry items are lower that other restaurants. But for bread items the price is same.

The thali seemed decent enough as i saw others having it. But the extra price for packaging is disappointing.

Gem of a place, you have to wait for the food for a liitle bit but its worth the wait. Seating available but better to go for takeaway. We went for Murgh Tandoori and Stuffed Murgh Malai Tangri both the items were just superb and splendid to say the least.
Overall a very good experience.

I have been there couple of times. Small place for eat and relax. It fits every common mans pocket. Taste n price go hand in hand. Food is good and well prepared. It's also healthy .Everyone need to visit and try.......

The tandoors are awesome. We generally pick up chicken tandoors from there and the smell in the car while we go back home make us already hungry. Difficult to resist for that 15mins drive. 
Chicken quality very good,soft and well cooked.

Just a suggestion to the resturant...if they can provide an option of some bread or garlic rice. Because many may not like garlic rice all time.. ☺

Extremely average food. Terribly disappointed. Was very excited to try their tandoori momo but it was an absolute disappointment. Other dishes like mutton musallam, chicken lababdar were too oily and too much color was added. Even their speciality, chicken cheese Reshmi kabab was pretty tough to chew.There are many other joints in salt lake which serve much much better food at the same or even lower price range. My advice to all the foodies: Don't even bother to try.

Two days in a row. The Tandoori here is way better than the competitors with the quality and prices combined. And, boy oh boy! do they serve an amazing platter.

Been here... Ordered chicken reshmi butter masala for parcel... Was okayish...because some of the chicken pieces were soft and juicy while the others were really fibrous...and one more thing that i found pretty ridiculous was that they charged Rs. 10 for a paltry plastic container while these days even cheap hotels provide them for free ...

Had an eye on this place for quite some time - at last decided on a takeaway veg lunch pack this afternoon. It was beyond expectations - full marks for variety, taste, quantity & packaging - all at a very reasonable price of Rs. 100. Definitely worth the money. Would advise them to throw in some pickles and a plastic spoon to complete this great offer. A must try place for takeaway lunch packs & am now looking forward to trying out their rolls n kababs.

Tot @ its best... the food is just perfect!! one needs to rate it at par with its price line... A perfect combination of good food accompanied with great taste. It fits every common mans pocket. Taste n price go hand in hand . A tandoor specialist that grills everything to perfection. My personal favr8s.. tandoori chicken..hariyali tikka..reshmi tikka ..grilled bhetki....Every item needs to be tried. Its healthy n hygenic. could not have asked for more. Every one needs to visit n try ...n i m sure just like me you will keep coming back.

I dine here or have a take away almost twice a week . Few things I like here :

1. Food is good ( not excellent ) . 

2. Price is very very reasonable .

3.Do have tandoori bhetki , Malai kabab and tandoori momo here . 

4.Veggies can have stuffed alu and infact you can try each and every item .

5. Each item (kababs & tandoor items) are served as a platter with buttered rice and salad making it a full meal.

What I didnt like is 

1. The restaurant is very small infact it is ideal for a take away .

2. Home delivery takes a lot of time .

3. Do not have tikka kabab, multani kabab,hariyali kabab .I found these preparations very dry not at all juicy ..

Happy Eating ...
