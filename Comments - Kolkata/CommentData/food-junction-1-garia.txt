I ordered food home from here on a lonely afternoon.
They provided me with basanti pulao and mutton kasha and salad. They have swift delivery system. Food was extremely delicious and cheap.
Will order from this place again.

For snacks, Food Junction is awesome and the best part is that almost every dish is within the budget. More than 4 types of pakora are available priced within 100 bucks! We often order evening snacks from Food Junction and we really enjoy it.

If you want your food to reach you on time please order from them a day before bcoz the resturant believes in reaching super late.

Cold food, extremely late delivery!
