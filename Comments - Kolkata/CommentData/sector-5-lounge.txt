Strategically placed at a brilliant location, just at the entrance of Sector V in Benfish IT Tower.

The ambience is just amazing and refreshing for a leisurely afternoon or evening after the daily office grind for get together.

Had been skeptical owing to it's moderate brand of mock-tails but frankly speaking we were taken by surprise. 
The drinks are moderately priced w.r.t similar Restaurants.

The variety of Non Vegetarian Starters they serve with the drinks do a world of good.

The ordered dishes were superbly done.
Kebabs with just perfect grilling. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity. Fish Tikka Masala and Palak Kadhai needs a special mention.

The service is good, perhaps a bit slow to some respects but overall can say the quality and taste of food offered was outstanding for the price tag. 
I had an amazing experience here. A treat to visit this place, always. Recommended !!

Lovely lounge in sector 5 , as goes with the name . Their food is awesome and their cocktails are worth to try out . This place has redefined the name of lounge cum restaurant . This place is right next hate to the lake lite restaurant . The decor and the ambience is very very good makes you feel alive . The music is also very good and the staff is courteous too . All in all a very good place to hangout and have fun with friends. Found this place from Zomato , and since they recommend it has to be good but it was amazing . Recommend to all my followers and friends

Interesting discovery near Benfish...This is a outlet next to the old Lakelite where we have spent many evenings this month. The ambience is one of a kind with innovative woodwork all over. Hookah is available as is a variety of drinks. Food is above average and its a good place to hangout when there is no room at the outlets around RDB. Pricing is easy on the pocket.
