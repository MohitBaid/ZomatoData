Have you seen this beauty?? And you want to know where to find it?? 
Ketchup kasundi near new alipore ccd. Tiny little shop , beautiful decore. Reasonable priced but cash only. 
Very healthy and tasty snacks available.
I really love this place and would recommend everyone personal to visit it once.

The newly opened joint is situated near ccd new alipore . They basically sell dessert and confectionery items along with vegetarian and non vegetarian quick bites . The entrance decor is pretty . I bought pastries from here when I was broke at the end of the month . The quantity is okayish in comparison to the pocket pinch . They need to work more on publicity as well as their menu . They also need to arrange sitting area for the customers who chooses to dine-in there .
