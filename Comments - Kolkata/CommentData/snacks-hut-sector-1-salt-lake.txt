This stall is a destination of tongue tickling sweet, sour and spicy chaats and there are many many varieties of it. I visit this Stall quite often for the samosa's and the mix sweet and sour chaat. I also find ladies impatiently placing orders for Chilla and this particular stall is too much in demand compare to the others in Saltlake swimming pool.
