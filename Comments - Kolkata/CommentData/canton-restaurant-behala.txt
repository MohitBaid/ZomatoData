This is i think very old chinese restaurant, located opposite of behala thana. Nothing great about ambience, just basic. 
We tried their chicken drumstick, which was okay.
Then we had mixed fired rice, canton special rice with sezwan chicken & chicken with tomato.
Quantity is enough for two people. But the prawns in the rice were not cooked well. Taste of of every dish is average. Price is affordable.

Okz finally reviewing canton behala. M a 30yr guy, since childhood m visiting this restaurant.. Its a vintage restaurant... Opinion about this restaurant is always mixed.. Sometimes they serve awesm food sometimes its average.. I have moved to bangalore n after many yrs visited canton.. Food was quite good.. I like the staff as well but tables and furnitures are very old n they need to retire.. No card payment option one more drawback.. Overall i like this restaurant.

The dimly lit Chinese restaurant didn't disappoint us at all. On a sultry Sunday afternoon with the end of the month drawing near we decided to drop in at Canton. We ordered 2 bowls of mixed chowmein and 1 bowl of schezwan chicken, quantity wise it was enough to feed three hungry appetites. Taste wise it was quite good. Service was prompt.

I love their decorations with Chinese lamps, showpieces and the place is a bit dark with dim lights appearing somewhat like a bar ..though it is not..
Food is too good ...specially Chinese choupsey is my favourite with crispy noodles, juicy chicken and prawn, perfectly cooked veggies and a poach on the top. It's a must try ... and they serve an adequate amount of food.. one plate is more than enough for two.
But.. the waiters are kind of rude and lack ideas about different dishes..so to ask them about how spicy a dish should be..or the amount of a particular dish ..and add specifications to it is worthless..

Probably the oldest chinese restaurant in behala. Used to visit this place veey frequently during my childhood. After decades of separation finally decided to visit.
The decor is more or less the same as it was 10 years ago. Its a bit dark for me, definitely needs more light.
We ordered singapore noodles,manchurian fish and american chopsuey.
The singapore noodles tasted good but it was really oily. The manchurian fish was the best of the lot.
The american chopsuey was a disaster. It was so hard and raw. Even after being immersed in gravy for more than 10mins the texture did not improve. This was by far the worst chopsuey I have ever had. Please never order this dish ever. Was a really disappointing experience. Not visiting unless I am well assured that they have improved the quality of their food.

Was passing by the road to Aminia when suddenly my friend showed me this one because he is fond of Chinese cuisine. I did a quick read on Zomato and dropped in. But then the atmosphere there in the afternoon wasn't really pleasing and i doubted their food. It took some time to serve the items. The baby corn was crisp and the sauce was in the right amount. When i tasted the fried rice, oh my god it was the BEST I had ever tasted. It was smokey and delicious. The canton chicken was finely cooked and the quantity could serve more than two people. We had to parcel it.

A beautiful restaurant serving awesome delicacies at really cheap prices.

Canton is one of those age old restaurants of Behala which used to serve the people of Behala before the Aminias and Hataris came into the area. Located in the opportunistic location of Behala Thana, opposite to the Bank of Baroda, Canton serves some of the best Chinese food. The rice and noodles tasted nice. We had Chilli Pork and Chilli Chicken to go with them and both tasted delicious. The decor and the ambience is not something over the moon but adds to the flavor of the Chinese restaurant that is Canton. One of my favorites in the Behala region.

Located near Behala Thana, this place has been my most frequented restaurant since childhood. I have always loved their food. Though the taste and quality has fallen in comparison to old times, it's still a good place to eat on a low budget.
Decorated with feng shui and low lights, it gives kind of a medieval ambiance.
The mixed hakka noodles are quite tasty and is served in ample amount. The crispy chicken is an ideal starter. The chicken lollipop is also pretty good. Their best dish however has to be the roast chili pork(dry). Well cooked and lip smacking. It's the one thing I make sure to order every time I visit this place. 
Service needs some improvement though.
Otherwise it's okay for a restaurant of this scale. Convenient and cheap. Good place for thw local people to eat on weekends.

Well. This place is located near Behala Thana. The place is a bit gloomy and service is not that great. They need to recruit more people for service. Nevertheless, the food is good. The Mixed Hakka Noodles and the Lemon Chicken was okayish. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn was a flop. Neither the taste of the babycorn was good, nor the quality. A lot of development is needed.

This is a small Chinese restaurant in Behala which is doing business for quite a few years now. You cannot expect high quality food or great ambiance here but its very reasonably priced, so its your place if you don't want to pinch your pocket.

Food: Food again is not high quality but extremely reasonable in terms of price.  I had a Chicken sweet corn soup,chicken chow mien ,Sweet n sour pork ,crispy chili baby corn and butterscotch ice cream and walked away with less than 600 in expense.

Service: Service is okay, nothing to brag about.

Ambiance: Restaurant is air conditioned and dimly liy, so it will be quiet place on a slow night. Its actually not bad I felt.

Verdict: Its acceptable for  occasional take away or dinner if you have less to spend. Do not look for quality food and I would avoid the fish as its best served fresh.

Probably the most suitable Chinese restaurant in behala. Can try out the variety dishes of pork out here, it's really good. They really excel in Chinese. The pieces of pork were soft & juicy. It is my favourite with Chopsuey.

I went to this joint a couple of times and was never disappointed. .This place was one of the first authentic chinese joints in and around behala.... Quality was used to be great back when there was old management than now.

Was astonished to see pork available in the menu on zomato & decided to order some. Opted for chilli pork takeaway. I asked to make it dry, but unfortunately when I opened the pack at my home it wasn't so.
Anyway the pieces were soft & juicy but not at par with other places.
Will update the review when I visit again.

My review for canton is strictly based on the point that it is one of the most oldest budget restaurant . When you are craving for some chinese and are low in budget you can try this joint and of course you have to be in behala . But keep this is mind that you have to be very careful in your orders since this is a budget restaurant and you will surely not be impressed by all the dishes. We had :-

1. Mixed fried rice 
2. Mixed Chow Foon.
3. Chicken with Lemon sauce.
4. Fish & hot garlic sauce .

They have got their basics right meaning that the fried rice was good in both quality and quantity. We had a bad order in Chicken in lemon sauce as it was very very sweet and we could hardly finish it but the quantity was really good. the biggest disappointment was the fish in hot garlic sauce . The fishes had a big ararot coating and it was horrible .The mefoon was average . It was not a bad experience but you have to careful in the orders. Meaning that coming to this restaurant you must order the basic items instead of experimenting.

The interior of this restaurant is full of Chinese decor. We went for dinner, and surprisingly it was empty.

Canton is a small chinese restaurant located in behala,  just after behala thana towards pathakpara.  It is a small chinese joint with moderate sitting arrangements.  Way bit stuffy.  Prices are very reasonable and also the food tastes good.  We ordered chicken hot n sour soup, mixed hakka noddles, and sweet garlic chicken.  Quantity was sufficient and budget friendly.  If you are hungry for chinese and dont wanna spend much bucks,  go through this restaurant. Staffs are good but not so professional. I wont mind visiting again. :)

Canton has been a favourite haunt for me over the years that i have spent in Calcutta.  i have never counted how many times i have been there with my girlfriend - who eventually became my wife later! We never even used to refer to their menu; we had most of their items at the back of our minds. 

We are great fans of Chinese food (the variety that is not forcibly Indianised) and Canton specialises in that. 

FOOD  --  for those who like cantonese (white and bland) food, Canton is the place to go to especially if you live around the behala / new alipore area. My personal favourites there are: 
gravy noodles - not all 'chinese' restaurants can make the 'gravy'  
dry chilli chicken - which doesnt have the gravy. i like it sauteed with the onions and bell peppers. 

STAFF  --  the staff there are very courteous and dont know wrong very often. weekends can get crowded around 9pm or so.

AMBIENCE  --  a no-frills ambience which fits families and romantic couples alike. it is largely quiet with dim lighting and some oriental decor which is not very loud. 

They are located bang on DH Rd. a few paces away from the behala police stn. on the flip side, parking can get difficult. you may have to park your vehicle a little distance away and walk it. 

I now live in bangalore but make it a point to visit canton every time I am in Calcutta.

This restaurant has been a favorite since my younger days not just due to the quality of food served but also the location & decoration. Went there yesterday after a couple of years and things didn't change much. They still serve delectable chinese dishes. Their fried rice is just too good. I don't quite like the noodles though, due to the oil quantity in it. The garlic noodles I ordered missed the garlic flavor. Mandarin fish was tasty too, just the outer layer was slightly hard. The chilly and garlic chicken is also awesome. Coming to the best part which overwhelmed me, the pork dishes. Pork lovers must try the roast pork chilli, it's absolutely delicious! It immediately became one of my favorite pork side dishes. Ensure that you have it with roast pork fried rice. I'm sure you'll love it!

Things they can improve on:

1. They are still on cash only mode. Cards acceptance is a must these days at any eating joint.

2. Have all their air-conditioners on when the temperature outside is 35*c during May, and not compromise on customer comfort in order to save electricity bill.

3. Get new plates, as the existing ones seem to have worn out.

I have been coming to this restaurant since I was a child & yes it has lost consistency but still has the best reasonably priced chinese(indian) food in kolkata with a quantity that can't match any other restaurant. It cooks in quite less oil. My dad loves the taste. they can't handle big orders.

This place serves authentic Chinese food. Visiting this place since I was a little boy. All their items are really good. The schewan rice , the  garlic chicken and chop suey are worth mentioning. All Chinese lovers do visit this place once. Good quality food that doesn't pinch your pocket a lot.

Situated in behala. Near behala police station this restaurant has a good ambience. According to the price portion size are good but doesn't have authentic taste of Chinese foods. Few items r really Delicious. Only if u add some nice desserts to your menu. And I don't why most of the time Porks are not available. Disappointing.

OK I'm gonna be honest..I'm absolutely surprised with the rating this place got. I would have agreed to this rating for this place 10yrs back but now I just can't.
Apart from the excellent location, this place doesn't have anything good. 
10yrs back, they prolly were the best Chinese food joint in behala but now its just downhill.
From serving overtly spicy, oily n less in quantity chinese food to the lacklustre upkeep of this place, this place shows it deterioration.

I visit this place when ever I am in Behala and i am particularly fond of this place. I love the Thai soup they serve and I am quite fond of the shrimps they serve in it. The meifoon is quite good though i haven't tried the pork varieties yet. The chilli chicken was good enough and i loved the chicken in hot garlic sauce. Service took a bit of time though not much and the ambience is ok for grabbing a quick bite. Looking forward to visiting again and trying out the pork here.

Canton has been in Behala for ages now. I remember visiting my 'Dida bari' at Behala and going to Canton for dinner at least once during my stay there. It was my Mamas who used to take us kids and treat us with Chinese food at Canton. As kids the very concept of chinese food for us was Chilly Chicken and Chowmein. That is what we used to order and before that chicken sweet corn soup was a must. Canton was one of the first restaurants to come up in this side of town which had a proper seating arrangement with a good ambiance and Air conditioning. As we grew up gradually the Mamas and Mashish got deleted from the list and it was only we cousins who used to frequent this place. We used to order food depending on the amount of pocket money we all had. If it was quite a lump sum amount we used to order starters like  chicken drumstick or chicken sixty five... else we satiated our hunger with the regular order of chilly chicken and chowmien. Have not visited it for many years but get to know about it from the younger generation of cousins who are regulars here. A frugal chinese meal in Behala... that is what Canton is all about.

But i have heard that the chilly pork tastes really good (haven't tried yet). The ambience is okayish. This one is for the forever broke guy who wants to have chinese platter at an affordable price.

 we were four taking the seat comfortably as it was 6.30 pm in the eve. the waiter was quick to notice us and took the order as soon as we settled down. 

Food: So about the food... we took Chicken chowmin with chilly chicken gravy.. They really make a good Chinese. it was really a Chinese i ate.. Chilly Chicken was well made to. 

QNQ & Prices: Quality is fine and the quantity as per Chinese resto was also alright. Prices are ok.

Perhaps the best place serving Chinese cuisine in Behala. Recommended for heavy dining as the amount provided is considerable. Price goes at par with the quality and amount of food served. Have recently included home delivery option in their bucket (within 5 km). The only limitation would perhaps be the dining area; it might barely accommodate 40-45 people at one time, that too at the cost of the place becoming too crowded. Service personnel and ambiance is satisfactory.

The only authentic Chinese Restuarant in Behala at par with restuarants like Kowloon (New Alipore). Serves all types of Chinese delicacies. I visit this eatery quite often. I have tasted schewan noodles, thai chicken , pork rice, mixed salad, shrimp curry, pork ribs, shredded pork, grilled chicken among many others. Though I am not quite a fan of chopsuey I liked their's. All in all quite a good restuarant. Price is bit steep considering its surrounding but food is simply delicious. They also offer home delivery system around 5kms which is a cherry on top!! Its often crowded due to lack of  ample space so its best to visit it during noon. Its not a place for a quick bite as the quantity of the above items are quite sumptuous so its recommended for heavy dining.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Behala. I have fond memories of visiting this place with my family on regular family occasions and Christmas outings.

They serve luscious variety of soups. The food is priced at extremely cheap rates.
The ambiance is exquisite. 
The only problem with the place is the size of it. Though its double storeyed, the interiors of it are extremely compact. 
Also, the lack of a bar adds to it.

Recommended for small group outings and takeaways.

Starting off with chicken schezwan chowmein it was hot , spicy & tasty!! :D Though it was chicken schezwan chowmein but it also contained pieces of prawn with scrambled eggs :D
Next comes canton special rice.. another hot & tasty dish ( less spicy ) :D It contained pieces of chicken , prawn ,  scrambled eggs and a big omlet :D ^_^
Lastly my favourite the chicken foo yong ^_^ :D in simple words the chicken omlet :D it was so tasty that i can't explain u!! :P

To all the chinese food lovers in behala do visit here once... you will love it!!! :D ^_^ 8|

Oh  yes   yet  another review   for  this place! This  time  tried   their   Thai  soup  ,  which  was   just  delicious    thin   ,  clear  soup   with   lots   of  herbs  ,  prawns  and  chicken  pieces....the   flavour  was  too  good  with  a   touch  of  tangy taste...   clearly   the  star  of   the  meal....can't   wait  to  try  it  again... other  than  the  soup  had  the  chili  fish   ,   chicken  sweet  and  sour and  fried  rice... the  chili  fish   was  nice  though  my  dad  felt  the   fish  was  not  too  fresh...  the  chicken   was  good  though   had  better  from   Canton and  the  fried rice  was   well  as  expected ...  the   service   was fine  , and   the     food  came   at   Rs.  400  ,  which  is  value  for  money   totally    as the  quantity  and  quality   were   quite  good! .5 added  for  the    soup  ,  which  surely  made  my   day!  :)


----- 05 Feb, 2014 -----

Tried   the rice  noodles  on  my  recent  visit...  nice   and   really   thin  it  was ok  but   I  feel  it could   have  been  much  better  in  taste!  The  chilly  chicken  was  usual  stuff... quite   nice . :) Didn't order  anything  else  on  that  visit....but  overall  okay !


----- 28 Nov, 2013 -----

So  this  is  the  place  I  usually  have  Chinese  food  from  ,  on  a  regular  day ...  the  ambiance  is  ok   and  the  seating  is  a  bit  cramped,  the  four  seating  table  is  actually  comfortable for  two . But  the  food  is  great  here  ,  The  Mixed  Fried  rice  ,  Chilli Chicken  ,  Chicken Sweet and sour  and  Chicken  Manchurian are  great  here! The service  is  alright  !  Tried  American  Chop Suey  for  the  first  time  here  and  the  experience  was  quite  good! Surely  shall  continue  having  food  from  here!

I recently visited Canton and was refreshed to see that the restaurant had picked up its standards a lot. There were 4 of us and we ordered mainly pork and chicken dishes. All the items had appreciable quantity and the taste was also very good. The service was prompt and the food delivery time commendable. The place was full in no time and even in the rush, the staff served us really well. We had more than 6-7 dishes in total and the final bill of 700 was a testament that the food here is really cheap. Worth a visit if you live in Behala or come to the vicinity.

Been there a lot many times and was satisfied every time. 
No, the decoration is not great but a restaurant is meant for eating and not visual pleasure. 
Will give 3/5 for the ambiance though. 
Staff are friendly and they do have good suggestions as well. 
They have a short and sweet menu and it possibly has almost all Chinese food a person can desire of. 
Food arrives pretty quick, 10 mins to be precise and is nice and hot. 
They have a freezer too in case you want a drink with your food. 
Very well prepared and quantity is satisfactory. 
Waiters are always looking to help you out and they never take a guest for granted. 
Seating capacity is about 30 with tables arranged in different formats. 
Since it is located right on the D.H road finding it is a cake walk. 
Have seen this restaurant running for about 14+ years now and I think it takes quite a lot to do that.
Do try the chicken with vegetables and the honey chicken. Forms a great combination with fried rice. If you're feeling tempted enough right now, probably you should turn the computer off, get dressed and head towards Canton. :P 

Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4.5/5
Price : Rs. 500 for two. No alcohol.
Visit again? : Yes. The simplicity of the place is addictive. ;)

When you enter a restaurant you need to feel comfortable enough to have a happy meal. Well, Canton a Chinese restaurant located in Behala is not really very central. Not only does it not have proper seating arrangements but there is no privacy; it's like you have stepped into a shoe. The place itself is in a deplorable condition as no one has the energy to clean it or fix it. It is entertaining when the waiters (who are not Chinese!) try to put on a Chinese accent.
Restaurants are supposed to serve food; well Canton serves food all right - at least it looks like food. There is no presentation; the menu itself is confusing as there is no division between the main course and the drinks or beverages. Although the Thai items are good, the soup is hot and made fresh - it's thick and I would say delicious. My meal should have ended here as the main course was an insult to my stomach. Though the quantity is very generous the food is tasteless. Most of the items have too much sugar in it. The noodles had sugar cubes in it, and when asked they replied this was the way the actual Chinese cook their meals. 
Coming to the ambience, there are no decorations as such apart from a few paper fans here and there. There are three Air conditioners but only one was allowed to run. It was hot and noisy and as the kitchen had a broken door the fumes were a guest too! On the whole if you want to spend a nice comfortable time eating a delicious meal with your family or some personal time alone - choose another restaurant as Canton is not the place! Not unless you live in a shoe...
