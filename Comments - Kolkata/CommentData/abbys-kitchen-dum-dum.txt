Ordered through swiggy crispy chicken and chicken reshmi kebab. For a small food counter the food here is quite tasty and they give ample chicken at a cheap price. A must visit place for a tasty and cheap evening snack.

A friend of mine lives in Motijheel and every time I visit him, we get snacks from here. We generally order Chilli chicken dry and chicken drumsticks . The chilli chicken is okay, but the drumsticks are quite good. But I feel they can be fried a little more to make things better.

Quite reasonable and located conveniently near dumdum . Their dry chilli chicken tastes great ,we also took chowmein and fried rice both were good .They have a small seating arrangment for people who want to eat there. Only prblm is that they take very long to prepare as because most of the time they are flooded with delivery orders. You can call and ask them to deliver in you reside near buy .
One thing i appreciate about this place is that its very neat and clean unlike other fast food joints.

Food is an obvious yes. Only problem l faced is they take much time to prepare it. Easy to locate in Dum Dum road. And yes no proper sitting arrangement else it is a good place to eat at reasonable price.

A very good start... 
It's a small take away managed by 2-3 people. However they have kept a wide variety of food items and have tried to keep the actual taste , be it aloo dum , momo or fried items . Recommendable

A good take away option. The chilli chicken dry was really tasty. We even ordered fried rice and noodles which were satisfactory. Chicken lollipop could have been better. Prices are reasonable.

They are located near motijheel Vodafone store. I had seen them while traveling to nagerbazar,and had tried their lollypop . The food was okay. Had asked for the drum stick , but they don't make it half though it's on the menu.The crust was thin but could have tasted better.

The place is a take away joint with the option to eat in front of the shop where they have kept a few chairs. Well i had order chicken manchurian and fried rice for take away. They had taken some time, but the food was not really upto my taste. The spices had not completely penetrated the rice , the rice quality could have been a little better. And the chicken though tender was not completely cooked. It could have done with a few more minutes of cooking. The price is average and not a big pinch on the pocket.

Another fast food joint on dum dum road. Located just between Vodafone store and Vinegar restaurant near motijheel bus stop, this place runs only on take away or stand n eat option. No place to seat apart from 4 plastic tools. We went this evening for some shopping and while feeling to have quick bites, this place came to our attention. Parked my car beside(here's a good part, u can always get a free parking space for any food joint on dumdum road) and ordered for 1 egg roll and 1 chicken roll. Price is very reasonable, egg roll is just 20 rupees and chicken roll comes for 40 rupees. I asked them to get the rolls as soon as possible as I was in a bit hurry but even though there was no other customer at that time, still they were fumbling on things. It was quite expected as they are not pro but the good thing was that they were trying to make things better.
Finally the rolls got ready and I put my first bite. Here is a catch - predominantly in most of the fast food centres, they use some prepared chicken pieces as stuffing for chicken roll but here it was a blatant exception. The entire stuffing was prepared separately with onions and capsicum and then put inside the roll. The outcome was genuinely nice - can be called "chilli chicken roll".
They have few other varieties as well in the menu and probably do home delivery too. Please do check the same if you wanna place an order with them. Overall, its definitely worth a place to try and most importantly to encourage them, we should drop in there!!üòÄüòÄ

Yes,it's basically a kitchen cum take away counter with 2-3 chairs over there,located near motijheel,beside Vodafone store, people might skip this small joint cause of the simplicity of the restaurant but believe me they make one of the best Chinese foods in the area,the quantity is good & most of the items are pocket friendly, overall a good place for Chinese lovers ‚ù§
