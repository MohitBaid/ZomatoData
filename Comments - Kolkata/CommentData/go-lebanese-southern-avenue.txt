The third restaurant on our list for the food marathon. The one and only Shawarma point: Go Lebanese. There has been no change in the looks of this outlet. A place with list of memories. The same old sauce and not the slightest drop in the taste of food.
Ambience: none
Chicken Shawarma: 4/5
Staff: 4/5
Cost: INR 130

The pioneer of the Shawarma as a street food in Kolkata. The food is good and lip smacking. Unless you have no issues to stand or sit on a stool by the roadside to dig into a sumptuous Shawarma, you should definitely give it a try. Must try items: the Shawarma wrap, the Grilled Chicken, the Sheesh Toil, Shawarma Salad.

This was my first time visiting any Lebanese restaurant. So I don't have any previous experience to compare the quality of the food. I am giving this review only depending on my tastebuds !!
The food quality was good for me. We ordered chicken shwarma wrap, mutton kabab wrap, chicken shwarma salad and honey boney chicken. I liked every item except the shwarma salad. I highly recommend the honey boney chicken. It was my personal favourite. Also this place is quite pocket friendly. Although they do not have good seating arrangements but the food is definitely worth the visit.

Love their hummus and pita bread and falafel wrap. It's filling. A coke with it really goes well. You can take away/ eat it in your car/ home delivery. There's no seating space.

Tried the much recommended shwarma wrap and found it actually worth all that praise. The only drawback is that this place lacks any kind of sitting area. Otherwise the food quality is simply amazing

Titbit place!! Nice place to give ur hunger a bit relief. Quality of food was good. Not a large space. Pocket friendly, nd a good one to chitchat over a few items. I love lebanese food but this place is not the best in town. They can improve a lot

This place used to offer the best Shawarma in town. It was our everyday hangout place back in 2012-2014. If I were to given a review back then I would have rated 5 for this place. Visited Go Lebanese  a month back while my visit to Kolkata. Was a little dissapointed to see the degradation of their service and well as their quality of food. I hope they start making the customers happy by making strides with the quality and service.

It is extremely sad and shocking to see people appreciate something which is a pathetic attempt on mocking something which is so awesome. Honestly Kolkata! You guys need to be aware of authenticity.
I have stayed a considerable amount of time in the middle East.......shawarma and shavoy grill or what you call as rotisserie chicken were my staple food and very close to me . Every joint makes it similiar more or less. In India Mumbai, pune and Bangalore do a very decent job getting very close to the taste.
But kolkata .....man this is shameful .....if ever an Arab asks u for a shawarma ....please don't give him what you guys serve.....he will literally feel like burning  down your shop.
To start with the shape of the shawarma is wrong.  The toum you use is sweetened garlic mayo.....original has very distinctive garlic flavour with no sweetness. Please no capsicum ....cabbage.....its frenchfries, onion....pickled salad . The marination of the chicken is wrong! 
Your grill chicken is so damn dry. The spices are bland !
Please serve honest food....when you use the authentic name....make an effort to serve authentic taste too. It's not that bad and definitely better than what you make now.

Last week on a sunday afternoon was hungry AF so ordered this through swiggy. They took 1.5hours to deliver this. The food was cold and stale. Most probably it was leftover from last night. The staffs were bloody rude. They asked me to personally visit them and return the food. I complained on swiggy and they refunded me the money. Horrible experience.
