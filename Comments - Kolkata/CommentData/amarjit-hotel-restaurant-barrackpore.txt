i think this is 1 of those restaurants which matches with the ambience of a village .something villagers can easily afford , those who dont stay in barrackpore just visited here or stay here just for some study or work issues, its not at all recommended to them . food is unhiegenic & space is very less.

It's a cheap pocket friendly eatery, combined of North Indians Chinese and daily lunch and dinner hotel, No ambience, unhygienic, Food is good as par as the price is concerned..

Amarjit Hotel & Restaurant -
Located near at barrackpore station..this place is something which shouldn't be called as a hotel or a restaurant.
It is a small tiny food outlet which has some seating arrangements..even calling it as a dhaba would not justify it.
Coming to the food they serve Chinese and Indian and none of them are worth of spending for or trying. Quality of the food is very low.
Price is very cheap and the place is bit unhygienic.. service is slow.
So it's up to the people who still decides to go over there.

Not a restaurant, just a simple hotel with low varites of items but nice and well pocket friendly. Not recomended for meat cravers.. just for snacks.

This place is located in a prime location just outside Barrackpore station. It's not a Hi fi restaurant, more visited by regular office workers of nearby offices. Though some of the dishes are really good like butter chicken and special tarka, most of the food here is ordinary. Don't have high expectations but a good place for change from home food.
