Awesome ambience and very good food. Service is also very nice.
Live screen and music add a different flavour to this place. Pocket pinch is also not too much . 
Just the location is remote to some extent otherwise this is an awesome place.

Going there is a strict no no. While food quality is good, they are cheating Customers by watering down the drinks to a massive extent and posing it as an offer for Rs.51/30ml . Also refused to provide TCS discount stating lame excuses. Staff is also rude.

Good food and very good staff, always smiling and ready to give you that extra bit of service. The Honey and Mustard fish is a must try, which can be served to kids also. Getting a Bar Tender and a DJ will make this place a top class eatery in New Town area.

If you are looking for a party spot on the weekends and want to get booze at extremely cheap prices (only kingfisher pint beer at rs. 55 each) then this is your ultimate party place with your friends. But the offer is only available on the weekends and to corporates. Make sure to call beforehand to knw if the offer is available or not. The food is good. We tried Fish Tikka, Finger Fries, Fish Finger and Mushroom Saute. Food is not extraordinary. But you don't need extraordinary with cheap booze and friends. So definitely try this place out. Don't Drink and Drive and trust me at this rate U'll definitely drink a lot. Cheers!!!!

A new restaurant cum bar at Newtown serving indian and chinese. Headed for a quick lunch over pegs of vodka , ordered for a Chilli mustard fish and chicken Cantonese noodles. The fish was flaky and fresh but tad high on salt , noodles tasted decent enough. Staff requires a lot of training to suggest and serve , introducing set meals or happy hour deals should do good for pulling the crowd , else there are better places around to booze and dine at even more budget rates.

Very nice ambiance. Perfect for weekend mood. Service was really good. On the food aide, I'd like to remain silent since I sat for few mugs of beer and just had fish finger and salt and pepper chicken with it. Lot more to taste.

Beer@55/- offer is real with no hidden T&C. They provide 330 ml (pint) of Kingfisher Premium. Just carry your corporate ID card with and show it to the waiter before your first order.
Then sit back and enjoy your super chilled beer along with sports and music.
For the smokers, there is a dedicated smoking-area. I would advise carry cigarette with you because, they charge Rs 240/- for a pack of Gold Flake king size.
Now coming to the ambiance, it is super cool. There are two screens, one with football and other with cricket. So, pick your table accordingly. And also there is music. The lights are perfectly illuminated in accordance with the mood. 
Now, the only reason, I gave 4.5 is because of food. They need to work on the food quality.
Cheers.

It is in Eden court near to our office in Ecospace. Went there with my Colleagues. The interior is quite nice with a nice Bar counter. Adequate lighting and big glass windows. We ordered variety of food mostly chinese and north indian. Both veg and non veg. I had ordered a chiken fried rice and Garlic chicken . The starters were good. The quality and quantity of food was adequate. Good place to go for lunch from office in and around Rajat hat.

For all New Towners who have always missed having a good lounge in the area, this is a must visit place. Except Country Roads, New Town had no pub where you make a plan with willingness and not out of being optionless.

Hep interior, very good service, good food and not too expensive booze. Best thing is that unlike other pubs, this place is not cramped up. We were a grp of 8 and were given sofa seating. Coming to food, here is what we ordered

# Honey Mustard Fish - 5/5
# Salt & Pepper Fish - 5/5
# Mutton Bhuna - 4/5
# Murg ke Shokay - 4.5/5 (Portion size cud be better)
# Chilli Prawn - 4/5
# Mix Fried Rice - 5/5
# Chilli Garlic Noodles - 5/5
# Fish in oyster sause - 4/5

Everything we ordered tasted good. Fish preprations were the winners. The portion size was not great but not bad. The waiters have Led name tags which is really cool. Its good when u can call them by name and not say 'Oh hello' or yell Excuse me in the air till a waiter turns and looks at you..

Best part, we showed our company ID card and got 10% discount on the food. One suggestion is to add more Cocktails to the menu.

Recommended - Definitely

Good ambience,  however location is not very good... The staffs are well mannered and very cordial.. The liquor menu is very affordable,and not overpriced.. Chilled beer coupled with dry chicken was a bliss.. The staff even gave us sliced onion and garlic as per request...
Food is good and tasty..however the quantity of fried rice was a bit below the mark.. Overall a good place to hang out with friends for a casual drink party...  There is also a smoking area which is nice...

Well no funny business on the said offer. Have attached the bill to clear it out.

Small joint, Average food and Cheap booze. If this is what you need then this is what you will get.

Malai kebab and American Corn is must try.

This place being far filters out unwanted crowd and ambience, so no unnecessary drama .

This is a new pub...which is very near from Ecospace business park..situated in Tata Eden court campus... pretty neat...staffs are quite prompt.... alcohol is really cheap...I don't know about other days...but I got kingfisher premium pint @ 55 rs...food price is little on the higher side...I guess that's how they balance it...food is ok ok....I would not say that...it's a great place..but definitely a good choice for people who work in & around the area..

Located in the centraus mall, not a very happening area, but when u enter the place it gives a good ambience, not big in size but can be a place to be visited with frnds.. They had an offer of beer@55 but the waiter asked for my id card and then I came to know offer was only for corporates (a turndown )
Coming to food I ordered Paneer kesaria tikka, Paneer Manchurian and a veg Hakka noodles. Both the paneer items were good the paneer was very soft and the gravy of the Manchurian was also good, the noodles good in taste but they can work out on the quantity though
Overall this place can be given a try, but the area in which it's located is a dull one so don't expect anything

I will call them nothing less than a FRAUD. Trying to draw the attention of the city crowd by belching out a pint of beer @ 55, they indecently cover up the hitch in the path - this offer is applicable on corporate members, only. When confronted on the sheer absence of the necessary clause in all promotional exercises conducted across social media, the staff smartly passed on the blame to the management, who were to be found nowhere. 
To add to our dismay, on placing an order for two servings of alcohol (30 ml/each) straight out of the menu, the concerned person at the bar doubled it up on his own without any prior consultation with the consumer and suavely added the extra bit to the bill. He had no response to offer, nothing even close to an apology, when cross-examined.

Beer @55/- on weekends was everywhere on FB and that viral post is what introduced me to this place. I was sure there would be some catch to the offer – First Beer for 55/- or an entry charge but surprisingly there was nothing. Literally nothing!! You walk in and if you are lucky enough to get a place, you can drink gallons of Beer at only 55 bucks a bottle. Unrealistic and Fantastic ;p 

Location ----- Located next to Tata Eden Court building, in what seemed to be a new Mall, since 90% shops were unoccupied. I used Google map to reach the place since I had not heard of the Mall before. Parking is free. 

Ambiance and Service ----- Decor was simply Beautiful. Did not expect a place serving Beer @55/- to be an upscale place. We had to wait arnd 15 mins to get seating. They have comfortable Sofas for big grps and regular table chair seating. Smoking zone is a plus in rainy season. A big projector screen, good for seeing a live match. Service was a tad slow bcoz the place was packed to the neck but the staff was very courteous. This guy named Bijoy served us and he was very sweet. 

Now coming to Food: 

Usually lounges there days have only appetizers and finger food but they had a good variety in Main Course also (Indian & Chinese). We were a big grp and we ordered a lotttt of food: 

✓ Chicken and Fish Salt and Pepper: Excellent. A new flavor to Salt and Pepper preparation. I actually called the Chef to tell him it was really good.. 
✓ Murg Ke Sholey: Smokey Charcoal flavor tikkas with melt-in-the-mouth texture..
✓ Mutton Bhuna : Good.. 
✓ Peanut Masala n F.Fries : Standard 
✓ Fish Begum Bahar (Mains): The Fish was really Fresh and gravy was tasty.. 
✓ Paneer Methi Malai (Mains): An authe@ntic North Indian dish. Quite well made. 
✓ Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce : Okiesh
✓ Chicken Fried Rice : Winning dish of the main course. So full of flavour. Must try for those who love Chinese 
✓ Chillie Garlic Noodles : Good

With the kind of Food they serve and the Ambiance and service, I absolutely will go back, with or without the Beer Offer. Definitely not missing the Beer Festivals 😂😉

Recommend - A BIG YES

Got to know about this place just few days back when  saw a post in facebook of the recent offers it had of  offering beer at 55inr AI.. and within seconds shared the post with one of ny good friend.. and without wasting much of a time we took a decision of visiting this place for sure on the saturday night. Located near the eden court in the rajarhat new town area.. there isnt much of hustle and bustle in the surroundings as it was a saturday night abd that too in an office area.. we went in and  we were told to wait for 5 10 mins to get a table.. finaly we got a table and whereever u move ur eyes around that night it was just beer and beer on each and evrry table. It was a great sight really.. the ambience was pleasant with background music being played .. it has live sports screening too.. we were attended by a service personel named Rakesh, he waa just excellent in his job.. after so long i have seen somebody in this industry being so generpus in his work with that calm attitude in such a peak hour.. we ordered for beers one by one.. and in food we decided to stick with the corn salt and pepper, a regular masala peanut to munch on and a portion of pan tossed veg manchurian.. the food was excellent in taste we both felt.  It could have been less oily somewhere i felt.. but full marks for the food.. the menu doesnt just emphasis on fingure and fast food.. it also has a main course menu  due to which starter options are not so huge.. it was somewhere disappointing to not find something realted to pasta or some sandwiches to much on the menu.. we were late to reach so not much of beer we could consume as the stock got over too.. we were told by Rakesh that they had sold more than 500 bottles since 1 p.m and they are soldout for the day.. we realy enjyed our time there.. u get ur value fpr money for food but it would be great if more of starter varieties could be introdcued in the menu though..surely a next time visit.. .

It's not bad, it's not unique either. It tastes more like mall food. Everyone knows you don't fare good if your food ain't excellent. Recommendation: YES

Latest addition to the happening New Town/Rajarhat area is the "On The ROCKZ" Sports bar and restaurant. Located in the ground floor of the new Centrus Mall of Tata Eden Court, it is located close to the office premises of Eco Space, TCS Gitanjali Park, DLF2 and Unitech.

We visited this place for dinner on Sunday. As we entered, i was amazed by the well decorated and lovely ambience, and yes, one large and one medium tv screen on two ends showing sporting events. Itz quite spacious inside including the bar area.

Coming to the food, we had ordered the honey mustard fish as starter which was just awesome! Then we had the paneer kulcha, butter and garlic nan alongwith chicken patiala, all of which tasted quite good. Since it is new, for the moment there is not much options for mocktails. We had the mango jalgeera one and it tasted well.
We didn't go fr drinks, but many options were available.

Lastly the serving members were well mannered and quite good. Liked the idea that each of their individual names shining in red light in their shirt pockets.

So, a must visit place for all the food lovers. And on a day having good sports events on tv, one will definitely enjoy the environment here.

Enjoy!!!!! :-)

This one is a Newbie in New Town area and a lot of friends have been talking about it so I finally decided to check it out last weekend.
New Town as area has a serious lack of good lounges and party places so this place comes as a breath of fresh air to all New Towners. 

Location and Parking:

______________

Located in a new mall which I had not heard of before - "Centrus", on the footstep of Tata Eden Court building. The place is a tad deserted but if you have your personal vehicle or are able to afford a cab ride in and out, then you can visit. For getting public transport you will have to walk till Eco Space circle. This was one of the downside to the place. Parking however is free and there is ample space. 

Ambiance and Service:

_____________________________

Very Chic and B'ful. Cool quotes on the entrance wall. They have Sofas (you need to be a group of 6 or more to get a sofa seating) and table chairs. Smoking zone available. They also have a separate grp dining area for 12 to 14 ppl which I have booked for an office party next week. A biggggg projector screen is also there for live sports screening. Service was quick and staff was very courteous. They also have LED name display on thr shirts which was unique.

Now coming to food:

____________________________________

They serve Indian and Chinese cuisine. The menu could have more options but taste of all dishes we ordered was great. May be lesser items help them in maintaining the food quality.

✓ Fish Salt and Pepper: Winning dish from the order. Made with Basa, crunchy on the outside and very soft inside.  
✓ Murg Ke Sholey : Smokey Charcoal flavor tikkas with melt-in-the-mouth texture. Must try for chicken lovers or North Indian people who like kebabs.
✓ Mutton Bhuna : I dont prefer mutton so skipped it, got a good feedback from those who had it
✓ Crispy Chilli Babycorn : Ordered
by vegetarian in the group, decent in taste.
✓ Fish Begum Bahar (Mains): The gravy as well as the fish was good. Bengali frnds will like it. 
✓ Murg Butter Masala (Mains): Being a north indian this is a must have on my plate. Quite well made.

✓ Dal Makhni : Winning dish of the main course. You do not get this kind of dal makhani in any restaurant in Kolkata. This Dal is one of the reasons for me to fall in love with their food.
✓ Chillie Garlic Noodles : Took a parcel for my family and it was also good in taste.
✓ Dessert : They do not have many options in Desert but the day we went there was 'Shahi Tukra' as Chef's special and it was deliciousssss

Price Range:

____________________________________

I wouldn't call this place pocket friendly but wouldn't call it expensive too. For the taste and quality I will best term is as "Value for Money". For me it was money well spent. Definitely going back for trying more dishes for their menu.

by vegetarian in the group, decent in taste.
✓ Fish Begum Bahar (Mains): The gravy as well as the fish was good. Bengali frnds will like it. 
✓ Murg Butter Masala (Mains): Being a north indian this is a must have on my plate. Quite well made.

✓ Dal Makhni : Winning dish of the main course. You do not get this kind of dal makhani in any restaurant in Kolkata. This Dal is one of the reasons for me to fall in love with their food.
✓ Chillie Garlic Noodles : Took a parcel for my family and it was also good in taste.
✓ Dessert : They do not have many options in Desert but the day we went there was 'Shahi Tukra' as Chef's special and it was deliciousssss

Price Range:

I wouldn't call this place pocket friendly but wouldn't call it expensive too. For the taste and quality I will best term is as "Value for Money". For me it was money well spent. Definitely going back for trying more dishes for their menu.

We have visited the place on a weekday, we were the first one to arrive on the day and had the full place for ourselves. The place is quite remote (near to Rajarhat ecospace)The space and decor are good, has a contemporary look. On a day of sports it would be very nice to have it on the nice and big projector screen. It started, well but there was a power cut for more than an hour (after this period the generator kicked in). while we were sweating profusely (you can understand the situation after few drinks and in a totally closed ambiance) to my dismay, the manager was so unapologetic and was giving excuses like they can not do anything as the generator is in control of the mall authority  (yes it is a part of a mall, although seems like no other shop is open other than the bar) and the generator is out of fuel!!!  As it seemed it was our fault, and the manager looked very unhappy that we were complaining and asking the status again and again. Price wise it is reasonable (compared to the ambiance, but off course if you are not living/working in Rajarhat, Newtown  there is no point visiting such a remote place). The only food we tasted was chicken Drumstick which was only okay (too spicy, and could easily be compared to any roadside fastfood restaurant).

Just adjacent to my office, this place is simply a treasure! It's a pub in Eden Court so you cannot expect too many visitors. Still I was surprised to find this place remarkably crowded on a weekday afternoon. Then realised that it's just next to a few big offices in Rajarhat!

Firstly, the food they serve is infused with rich taste. Quantity is fair. Each and every dish has a unique taste. I had tried Salt n Pepper Fish, Fish Fingers and  Drums of Heaven. They all satisfied my taste bud in some way or the other.

The service is good! I really like the guys who serve you there. They are damn professional and gentle. All got their names highlighted with neon lights on their uniform! This is new to me!!

About the booze! Well nothing special to mention expect the 55 bucks offer. It's a great deal guys. Do avail it if you are willing to gulp down gallons o beer at pocket friendly price. One Pint o Kingfisher Lager will be just Rs. 55!

I do visit frequently!

Have been to this place 3 times now, can happily say that this probably is the best lounge bar in Newtown area. Ambience, food, service - everything is top notch!

The ambience is quite good.. And the service was prompt. However I feel that the menu must be enlarged that is more variety of drinks as well as food items can be added. Keep up the good work!!

New hangout place at Rajarhat. This is next to ecospace and well located in the Tata Eden court mall. The place has good ambience . They are now promoting Kingfisher beer pint just for ₹55 on selected days . The service is good so is the food.
We have tried American pepper salt and chili paneer.
Both of the dish was mind blowing.

A really great place with an equally beautiful and awesome interior. The ambiance is really great. They have a smoking room and also a separate Private Dining Area. Really loved the place. Located just near Eco Space. Also they are running a great offer called Pintastic Weekday where they are offering Beer at just 55. Definitely visit!!

The new kid in town, located at the ground floor of the centrus mall(not central) which is just few mins away from the Ecospace island. Yesterday afternoon, four of us school buddies went over there to enjoy the  "beergasm" - Kingfisher pint at 55/- and no tax, no VAT and no GST.....In starters we had mutton bhuna, chicken thai pai and Fish salt n pepper. The chef is from the restaurant Addiction which is in axis mall - so We could had that same taste.
The interior decoration is awesome, a giant screen is there to enjoy ur favourite match. They have a dedicated smoking zone as well. The waitors are very courteous and always at your service. All of them have digital nameplate on their dress. Parking available, and don't forget to carry your own cigerettes coz no shop is around.

Now when I just started to write the review, the most shocking things is the rating this place have. It's 3.3 , and trust me it just not justify the great food( tastey food)they offer.

Location:
______________
it's between ecospace and unitech. In the Eden court building. For the office people here, it's a new block adding some alternative to have in this area. And for sure a relief.

Ambiance and decorations:
_____________________________
Nothing special about it. Quiet simple, calm atmosphere. As the place as of now is not a known one. It's quite less crowded and soothing.

Now coming to food and beverage:
____________________________________

They have a very limited range of menu. but taste is superb. We tried their Indian items only.

Starters:
_________
✓ Fish salt and pepper: this one is just superb. It's of basa fish. But taste is superb. We even ordered it twice.
✓ Saute prawn bell :8 pieces of prwan, saute with veggies. Very nice.

Main courses:
_________________

✓ Butter nun: nothing special. Good one.
✓ plain nun: nothing special.
✓ Chilly cheese nun: this one is owssum.
✓ Dal makhani : this one is great in taste. Superb.
✓ Dabba Ghost: bone less mutton in gravy. This tastes superb.
✓ chicken Patiala: shredded chicken in semi gravy with egg wrap. Excellent one.

Beverages:
_____________
Last but not the least 4 fresh lime soda. Quite good.

So, as I mentioned new block for the office people in the Rajarhat area. The hospitality is good also.

All that cost 2513 for 4 people.

But wait wait, hold on, they have the corporate discount also, 20%. So, the cost is like 2106 INR.

In short: owssum food, owsum experience. Hope to visit again.

To all , specially the office people around there, give it a visit :)

Catchy name and catchy place it is...
On The Rockz is a new gem in the crown of Kolkata..
During a day visit for work at Kolkata my client suggested that we grab a bit at this new place and apparently had heard of this place through some pamphlets being distributed.
Jittery at first we entered this place inside a mall and below is what I found:
New place and has very fancy interiors. Its definitely a fine dine place one can visit with both family and friends...
Comfortable sofa seating and well spaced out tables makes for relaxed ambience where one can enjoy a peaceful n private meal...Smokers can hav their time at the smoking area..A well stocked bar can fulfil ur wish of any drink thats needed...
The place has a large projector screen so u can catch some live sporting action over couple of chilled beers and drinks and some mouth watering food.
Im very fond of both Indian n Chinese and for me this was a treat...For the food we had ---
1. Fish salt n pepper - shud b made their signature dish, one of the best ive had till date...Kol cant go wrong with Fish...
2 Crispy Chilli Babycorn - yummy as well.
3. Chicken Tikka - soft n juicy with the authentic tikka flavor, one cant go wrong...
4. Chilli Garlic Noodles - veggie friends enjoyd this
5. Mutton bhuna - flavorful and tummyful...must have..
6. Fish begum bahar - hearty portion of this yummy dish made a perfect main course.
7. Dal makhani - has to be thr on my table and they did justice to this...
Quick service and friendly staff with LED glowing name tags make for a good experience...
No place for desserts at all...phewww!!
Their price to quantity ratio is quite good...
I thought the Chinese menu could be more elaborate but for a new place im sure they have more up their sleeves...
All in all they have been very thoughful and smart in accomodating most of the things that a restaurant should have...
Cheers Team On The Rockz!

The first time I came across this restaurant was through a pamphlet being distributed outside my office gate.
Location :
Just few minutes to the right of Ecospace Rajarhat. It's on the ground floor of this mall I forgot the name of. The area around it is very under developed, so if u have your own transport then it's better.
Ambience :
The corporate sector people are mainly targeted here. They are offering 20% off on alcohol and food now as corporate discount. The ceiling is decorated with creative bulbs and they have huge screen on the other side. They also have a smoking zone and a private dining place.
Food : We tried different variations of fish, chicken and mutton. The best of them were Masala Kulcha and Mutton Dabba Gol. Simply amazing 😍
Drinks : We tried Mojito and Cosmopolitan​. While the mojito was okish but the Cosmopolitan sucked big-time.
Service : Fast as flash. They have digital naming tags on them btw. Only thing is they messed up our bill a little..they charged us for 3breezers instead of 2. I think we can overlook this incident once.

Overall the best place for lunch if you're near Unitech , New town or Ecospace area.

On my first night in Kolkata, we went to On the Rockz after work. It is situated at a very convenient location, close to the IT Parks in Rajerhat. The place was lively even on a Monday night, and was filled with working professionals unwinding after a stressful day. The interiors were chic and modern and quite different from the other pubs. They played good music, and we were enjoying the IPL match on the huge projector screen. The Chinese food was delicious, and the staff were warm and hospitable. They also had LED name cards, which is the first of its kind that I have seen. 
It is the perfect place to hang out with friends and colleagues  if one needs to head out after work or loosen up on a Friday or Saturday night.

I just dropped into this place for a working lunch and was pleasantly surprised to have discovered a place like this in this area in kolkata.. Plush interior, delicious food and a warm hospitality of the owners.. the suggestions made by them were awesome, all that we ate was excellent.. crispy chilli babycorn, Fish in Salt Pepper (as per my nonveggie friend), dal makahni stole the show..however, a better selection on desserts would have really nailed it.. overall, a great place in this vicinity and absolute value for money! In fact, i also saw a huge projector screen, which would make this an ideal place to watch special screenings with great food!
