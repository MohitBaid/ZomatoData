Waiters are not much professional..  Ambience good..  Coming to food..  All Indian dishes have same gravy taste and all Chinese have same gravy taste.  So it's the same thing as we have ordered Chili fish and hot garlic chicken is same taste..  But the pineapple and cheese starter was amazing

It was on durga puja 2016
When it was midnight and we were searching for a good restro cum bar..then Su swagatam comes in our way.
1st- no parking available. Okay we managed to park outside.
Just in the hope to get good food.
The moment we entered the whole place was full of drunk hooligans..shouting at their peak..it felt more like a fish market.
2nd- we ordered 4chicken biryani.
 And 4 beers and 2peg of scoth whisky.
To be frank, after having the biryani i missed the street biryani near my place that costs only 60/-
It was so gross that we were forced to leave the biryani there.
And coming to alcohol..to much overpriced.
I dont get it how this type of place is still running in the city.
I wish zomato had negative ratings üòêü§î

One of the pocket friendly joints in south kolkata.
The place has plenty of fishes and birds to cheer up your mood.
Tandoori chicken is a must try here.
The place has a cossy atmosphere which is very good.

I wish I could give here Zero star rating. I have given 1 only for the location. We went there in a fine day for dinner with friends & families. We have ordered  bloody berry for the ladies. It was completely shits. The other foods also were not at all eatable. The staffs are unable to manage. They took almost 1 hour to serve 5 bloody berries. The staffs even were not listening to customers. Overall a very bad experience. Not at all recommedable .

Situated just beside CESC office opposite of G'hat P'loons one of worst food that we came across in recent past. Not only the food was aweful even the Bloody Mary that we ordered was thrown away by all the ladies of our group after one sip only. The dishes were served extremely late and the staffs seemed reluctant to clear the empty plates also.

Its that kind of a place you can certainly not visit with your family or your date. The ambiance is not good at all. Although they have a separate seating for families, but you have to walk through the bar after the main entrance and the place is shabby. Drinks are pretty much of the same price as compared to other places. Quality of food is nothing more than average.

This place is a very average hangout serving average food. You can get your drinks here and the mood is casual and relaxed, if you want to go "out with the boys!" Kind of has a run down feeling, and prices of Booz are too high!
They need a re- think on their identity and brand image, or a dramatic price reduction!

Not worth the time and money. Its pretty expensive compared to the quality of food. Alcohol is almost the same price as a good restaurant. Shady ambience and bad mocktails. The food was not extraordinary. Its mostly occupied by college students or old gentlemen. If you plan for a nice and quiet evening then Su Swagatam is definitely not the place to be.

A bar basically, located between Gariahat and ballygunge crossing, this place is just plain bad. If you want a drink at a cheap price then visit this place but don't go there solely to eat. I have visited this place a couple of times to grab a drink. It has 3 sections. One is an open air sort of a thing which is the family section (or so they call it) inside there's an air conditioned section which is mainly for alcohol. If you go there, do not expect a fantastic ambiance because you are going to be disappointed beyond words. The crowd mostly comprises of pot bellied middle aged men and young lads who are trying to get the taste of alcohol with a limited amount of money in their pockets. The washroom is a terror. Try to avoid using it if not absolutely unavoidable as the stink and the possible germs there could make you fall sick. The staff do their own thing, unaffected by the guests and their requirements. So, yeah that's such swagatam for you.

An age old bar cum restaurant which still now provides the relatively lost tradition of bar singers in the heart of South Kolkata, Su Swagatam is a place I have seen everyday since my school days but never dared to enter till I got my office just in a walking distance from it. Huge seating space separated for families, casual drinkers and bar enthusiasts. Service is really never their strong point, waiters and managers all are more keen on getting tips than providing a service on time, but the regulars really don't go there for the service. The attraction is cheap booze and lip smacking finger foods. And quite obviously I never ever tried any of their main courses to be honest. A bottle of beer and mostly the Masala peanuts , chicken pakora, chilli chicken are the automatic choices we have. If you really don't care about a fine dining experience and want to have some " bawali" with old pals this place provides a beautiful pocket friendly alternative.

This is a place frequented by middle aged paunchy men or groups of young adults, all looking for a drinking hole. Went to this place for a quick lunch with some people from office. They have a non-ac  seating area as well as two air conditioned enclosures. 

I had their Chilli Fish, Mixed Friend Rice and a hot red chicken gravy and a Masala Coke to wash it down. The fish was cooked well, the coating thin, even and crunchy, while the rice was loaded with shrimps. The chicken too was juicy though the gravy had too many Bell peppers. 

Though this is not the kind of place I would go to very often, I have to agree that the food was pretty good.

This used to be one of the favourite place for the South Kolkata people about 7-8 years back looking for a bar having cheap booze. 
My visit this time was after along gap. Though visually nothing much has changed except some extra tables and a television. I generally prefer the open area when i am not with someone from the opposite gender. I very well remember the Chicken Tandoori used to be fantastic here. This time though i ordered for a portion of Fish Tikka and it was very disappointing. The quantity was absolute rubbish. Only 4 pieces. Even the quantity was horrible. The fish tasted as if it was kept in the freezer for a long time. Even the tandoor was not proper with some burnt portion. The Onion Pakora was handsome in terms of quantity but again very oily. Its better to avoid items such as this. 
Service was on the slower side. Even the prices are now a bit steep. At these price there are far better places to visit to be honest.

Quite an average place. Good if you are looking for cheap drinks and food and have enough time to kill win friends. It is spacious so they won't chase you away. Don't go looking for exceptional food and you won't be disappointed. The pan fried fish is quite good however. Most other items taste quite average. 
The ambience is also nothing too laudable. Good if you are low on cash and wanna hang or somewhere with friends and share a few drinks.

This is a dance bar and a prostitution racket garbed under a restaurant and a bar operating. It's frequented by local goons and political hooligans. I got harassed by one such guy when I was drinking with my friend.

When I complained to the manager, he said there was nothing he could do. We had had 3 beers and had already paid for 2, and the payment for the third was pending. I refused to pay unless the concerned person was asked to leave. I was told that was impossible. The gates were shut and the money was literally extorted from me, before I was shoved and pushed out by a very aggressive staff.¬†

Never ever going back again. Also, filed a police complaint at the
Gariahat police station, but they seemed tied up with this, and reluctant to take action.

10 years ago, when I first visited this place, I was happy that a standard family bar cum restaurant had come up in Gariahat area. It was a sprawling place, beautifully decorated, with nice staff, and the family room was separated. Live band was there where we could enjoy retro Bollywood songs. I still remember how I asked for a particular difficult cocktail which the boys prepared after going through a book. Cute. 
Come to the present. A friend of mine wanted to spend sometime in a bar in Gariahat area, and without thinking, I recommended this place to him. It was exactly 10 years later that I set my foot here. And I was appalled to see its deterioration. The once beautiful decorations are long gone. The paints have been peeled, giving it a shabby look. We were made to sit in the family room, and.... Well, I have no word to describe it. There were rodents running freely on the floor. A group of rough looking boys were sitting in the corner, not drinking, but gossiping away. One of them even changed his shirt in full public view. Later on I came to realise that they were the musicians to the live band, which apparently still goes on.
Most of the brand of alcohol was not available, so my friend settled for kingfisher beer and kept on blaming me for my choice of restaurants, while I tried to convince him that this was a far better place 10 years ago. After seeing the rodents, we did not place any order for food, but quickly wrapped up and left the place. While going out through the general room we found that it was packed with people who just go there for a drink, not caring for the other points of a restaurant.
All said and done, the only good point that I can give is the good behaviour of the staff, barring the purported musicians. They were apologetic, and tried to make us feel comfortable but in vain. 
Shan't go there again unless I get better reviews about it in Zomato indicating that the place has change for better.

An average bar cum restaurant with huge sitting capacity. Have been here several times in various occasions. There are some scattered differently sized rooms which are AC or non-AC. There is one room where music is performed; but never visited that room as I do not prefer loud music while eating and drinking. Quality of food is good;  not upset stomach. Price-quantity ratio is reasonable. I found the ambiance neither to be disturbing or loud nor to be of superclass. The washroom can be kept cleaner I believe. The guests seem to be from a wide range of economical class but never experienced any sort of offensive behaviour from anybody. Drinks are served with care. Staffs are well behaved and helpful. I have only ordered various starters and soups sometimes but there is only one dish they serve for which I can visit the place again and again. The dish names 'Pataya Chicken'. This has been a must order for me whenever I had visited this place. Nugget sized chickens marinated with spices and fried. Completely dry, a bit spicy and unforgettably tasty. Goes extremely well with a peg of rum or whisky or vodka. As a whole, good experience but would not recommend for family.

However the interior inspite of being quite large lacks proper maintainance. The staffs are okayish. Food we orderd were mixed fried rice,garlic chicken,butter naan n paneer butter masala. Quantity was sufficient. The experience was not good enough for paying a second visit.

writing this review late. I went here during puja ¬†like every year bt this time i had a horrible experience!!! After a horrible experience in bluzz in the evening we had to go for dinner. The waiter asked us to wait as they were cleaning the table.suddenly a  diff group sat in our place. We asked the waiter to talk to them. The waiter didn‚Äôt bother to listen to us and told us to take a different place. After sitting idle in a table for around half an hour i literally had to go and talk to the waiter and had to ask him to take our order.. still no response. after 10 min he came and we ordered 2 beers, 1 antiquity blue, tandoori roti and 2 chicken items( dont reember the name). After around 20 min he came and told us that chicken dishes r not available.I asked for kebabs.he told kebabs r available.I ordered 2 chicken tandoori and reshmi kabab.In the mean time they gave us "hot" beers and without asking us anything they opened the bottle!!...antiquity was there but there was no ice bucket and also they didnt bother to ask!After about half an hour they served us cold kebabs!.we cancelled the order, gave the bill and came out of that place after having hot beers and antiquity blue w/o ice...also they didnt serve us water even after we asked.their gave us the excuse that there were so many customers that they couldnt handle!! if you cant handle customers they why the F*** do you invite them!! This was my last time there.
There are many places which ¬†are far better than this!.dont visit!.
I onli gave 2.0 remembering my last experinces which were better than this!

I recently visited the place on 3rd October, 2014. The food is good and ingredients used are very fresh. ¬†Though they prepare a different menu for the puja days, which is quite frustrating for regular visitors like me; but the staffs are well-mannered. ¬†There is also live performances by local artists , which adds glitz and glamour to the dine-in experience.

The most horrible experience going to a pub ever. Waiters tend to push in extra alchohol after a few rounds. Secondly, insult you just because of the table getting a bit loud. They expect a table of 10 people to have pin drop silence(mixed group of ladies and men). Thirdly, absolutely disgusting behaviour from the senior staff! In all a place you would never want to go again.

A very very average place which is best avoided.I have visited twice.The first time was during Durga Pujo and the second time was just to give it a fair chance.Both the times I have been very disappointed.

The only good thing about the place is the location.It is situated in the Gariahat main road very near to the Ballygunj Phari crossing.The place is quite spacious and  has three sections one open air one family restaurant and one bar.

I had heard that the place serves alcohol at cheap rates.It is true but not during festive occasions like Durga pujo during which they have a different and limited menu which is worthless and at the same time expensive.The food is very very average.The quality of the fish in the fish finger is not good.It was smelly.The chowmein and chinese side dishes are tasteless.

The service is slow to say the least.The crowd consists of people looking for cheap alcohol and is naturally not the best.

The closed bar is better I have heard but I have not had the chance of being there and actually I do not fancy it either.

It stands proudly on the Gariahat main road, but a little hard to notice, because does not look like a regular restaurant or bar at all. It is actually the ground floor of a building.Area-wise its large, and is divided into 3 parts, not sure what they mean thought. The food is quite average, and the crowd not that great. These are working class people who come to get drunk mainly. It is all about the cheap booze. But the most interesting bit is the closed bar at the end which has live music. It was flanked by two huge bouncers who initially did not want to let me in. At last with much coaxing I got in and bought myself a mocktail. There was a live band. I heard they have bar dancers too, but I was not allowed to stay for long, as it was pretty sleazy. In the evening, aging  bar dancers were singing devotional songs and I've never witnessed anything funnier! So if you are bored, and looking for some cheap fun, this may just be the place for you. But if you are a woman, make sure you are accompanied by a male friend or partner.

It was puja time when I first enter the premises of this diner. It was a bit of rush there, not easy to find place then. Sitting order is divided in three segments which I noticed. The narrow course right after the entrance is primarily dedicated to bar and dining space too, then there was an open space where you can enjoy your meal. After that there is a close area which is cozy and dim lighted, very sedative to your eyeballs. 

On my first visit I had Biryani which was not attractive to taste again. But later on they have omitted this dish from their menu. I have visited there for couple of times after my work. I have tried their vegan food such as Paneer Butter Masala, which I found quiet flavorful. Their Pulao platter is not pleasing, I had Veg Pulao, but I was disappointed. 
Among the non veg course I had Shredded Chilly Chicken, which I must say was loaded with a way too much chilly. But I finished the dish because it was appealing to my taste buds. 

Their service is variable, one of the times they are very sloth with their service. Milieu of this food joint is very fancy and eye pleasing. Over all it‚Äôs an average one I suggest.

moderate basic a.c. bar good enough for having a bottle of chilled beer alone.

It's really heard to say, I didn't like this place at all. Service ambiance and mainly food quality were very poor. They didn't even clean plates and glasses properly. Food quality is below average. "chicken tandoori" wasn't properly cooked and I found their "Mixed Noodles" was below average than street food. They serve alcohol but most of the beers weren't available. They need to take care about every thing to establish this place as a nice bar cum restaurant.My recommendation is : please do try avoid this place.
