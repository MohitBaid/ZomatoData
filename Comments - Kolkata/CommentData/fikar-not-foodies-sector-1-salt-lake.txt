The taste of the food is not nice and I think a place in Kolkata as such is expected to perform higher standards in terms of food rather than providing below par food in terms of quality and taste. The gravy is so generic and distasteful that it even caused stomach issues later on. It's very unhealthy and unhygienic to the core from what I felt. So I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. It's high time they level up their standard.

I just ordered dinner from here last night through zomato. The food was decent. I ordered two chicken noodles combos, which included chicken chowmein, chicken Manchurian, kimchi salad, fried potato wedges in a chinese kind of sauce, crispy noodles. 200 ml soft drink. The chicken chowmein was slightly less in quantity but tasty. The manchurian gravy was decent, but the chicken pieces were a bit hard. The kimchi salad and the potato wedges starter were quite tasty too. The crispy noodles, tasted more like some bhelpuri with onions and a sweet sauce, but I ate it bcoz I was hungry, and I love street food. 

Now coming to the service, that's some issue surely. They took about extra 15 minutes to deliver, which is still okay I guess. But they just didn't send the soft drinks. I was too hungry to delay eating and quarrel with someone over the phone for it. Also zomato provided a complimentary dessert, i.e., two gulab jamuns (shown worth Rs.50 in the site). The delivery person forgot to get that, and gave me Rs.20 cash, saying he was supposed to buy 2 gulab jamuns with that money. And guess what, I was hungry and didn't know how to react, so I just took the money.

I don't know how is it having Ratings of 3 on Zomato. I wish there was a negative rating. Ordered Veg Pulao, Kadai Paneer and Lassi via Zomato and trust me, this was the worst food I ever had. The rice was simply Raw in Pulao, the Paneer used were totally stale and Lassi was simply Water with added Sugar. I eventually had to throw it away. Moreover, they also delivered the food quite late.
Do not waste your Money!

Well, another hungry day and another experimentation with an outlet never ever visited earlier!

Wanted something not so light, but not so heavy also delivered to my doorstep and Zomato delivery flagged them for me ‚Äì the Fikar Not Foodies!

I ordered a mere 1 plate veg pulao and got it delivered timely. It was disappointing to see that they did not adhere to my instructions on the Zomato app of using minimal oil & also not to use dry fruits! The fork, spoon and even my fingers became damn wet with oil, once I started gorging!

However, food quality was fine and taste was good, full marks for their food presentation ‚Äì Man! The pulao did look a damsel! You don‚Äôt find too many restaurants preparing pulaos with so much of homely spices like elaichi, dal chini, tez patta etc. And you don‚Äôt also find restaurants using such optimum quantum of varied vegetables in their preparations!

Overall, a decent experience ‚Äì might consider a re-visit! Can‚Äôt comment on their ambience and service as this was an office delivery, prices are however reasonable!

My order Number through swiggy was 1077861065. I haven't tasted such disgraceful food in recent times. Ordered Mutton Biriyani Combo - Rice tasted crap, chicken wasn't cooked well and nothing good about the mutton. And have also ordered chicken fried rice combo - Rice was average, chicken was again crap and the associated combinations just didn't work. They don't know how to pack for delivery as the whole chilli chicken spilled. Strongly advised not to order food from them.

Ordered the swiggy combo from fikar not foodies. I had the Non Veg Combo. It had chicken chowmein, chicken manchurian, chilly crispy potato, crispy noodles and kimchi salad. The chowmein was average. The kind of chow you get from a roadside stall. The manchurian didn't please me either. The crispy noodles had too much chilly sauce and was pathetic. But the crispy potatoes were good. But a bit too spicy. The single plus point is the price tag.. all these came for 199 rupees only.

It's a really small joint near CA island, Salt Lake. A 24 seater with polite, gentle, courteous staff. The food is decent, the price is considerate. Really liked their Chicken Dragon Rolls, the chicken hakka noodles is a tad bit too dry so pairing it up with a side dish (gravy) will be good.

Salt lake has been a place I used to dread due to the dearth of places to hog. Finally on the way to CC1 , I did locate FNF and it has been on my wishlist ever since. An invitation from a place where you wish to drop in definitely maked you elated. Fikar Not Foodies is a restaurant serving authentic Chinese, Tibetan and the fact it serves oriental cuisine made me even more hungry.

Location : It is situated near the CA island. For people who do not have hint about saltlake, it is between City Center Salt Lake Petrol Pump Island and CA Island. From PNB, take a right turn next island is CA Island. From there turn left. FNF would fall on your right.

Decor and Ambience: This is a small joint nearly 24 seaters , having a simplistic decor. Some quotes on the philosophers of life, coloured bottles, coloured graffitis on the wall gave it whole new gleaming look. it was more of a present-day cafe look.

Staffs: The staffs are amazingly courteous. Service time being accurate. They are well read as in they exactly know what is their USP. The chef , whom we personally met, is an amazing man. And the best part of team FNF is that they are open to suggestions which is extremely important for a joint to evolve.

Food: And thus began our journey , the foodward way.

Starters-

1. Chicken Sui Mai- The most awaited dish, Mouth watering chicken filling stuffed in a blanket of wonton and steamed. Served with a special sauce with attractive garnishing. I felt the need of change of the sauce served. The sui mai would have tasted better if served a bit hotter.
                                          ...

Small food joint located near cc1 close to the CA island in Salt Lake...serves tasty food at pocket friendly price....we've ordered lat mei chicken and chicken lolipop for the starters....chicken lolipop was yummy nd crispy taste wise bt had a bit more of the batter...bt we loved the taste of lat mei kai...for the main course we had egg chicken noodles and burnt garlic fried rice with kung pai chicken...all were good enough but the noodle was superb.
The staffs were really cordial..and provided us with complimentary fresh soda lime...which was fine taste wise bt would have preferred something more cold...

Situated near City Center, right next to CA island, this place serves quite a few lip smacking dishes. We tried the Lat me Kai chicken and the Chicken lollipop as starters, followed by Burn Garlic Fried rice, egg chicken noodles and Kung Pao Chicken. The lollipop was quite good. Although there was a lot of batter, it was crispy and fried to perfection. The Lat me Kai chicken were square chicken pieces fried in a batter and cooked in a hot and sweet gravy. Although the chicken was fried till it was a little too hard, the gravy tasted really good. It is supposed to be spicy, but we asked them to tone down the spices and we immensely enjoyed the resultant gravy. The main courses were all good. The noodles were light on the spices and easy on the palate and a runaway hit with our group. I really liked the fried rice myself. The amounts of both the rice and the noodles were quite large and big enough for three people each. The Kung Pao chicken had 8 pieces and was also very nice. The only slight disappointment was the fresh lime soda, which was fine taste-wise, but a little warm. However we got a complimentary lime soda for no apparent reason, so no complaints there!
The restaurant is tiny with a seating arrangement for about 20 people. The waiter and the manager were both very nice and the service was pretty good. The place is really pocket friendly too- the bill for the five of us, after stuffing ourselves full, was only 925 rupees.

One of the newest additions in Sector 1,Salt Lake,is this outlet with a very¬†modern yet catchy name.It is located near City Centre 1 and can be reached¬†either by walking down from CC1 towards Balle Balle Dhaba or by taking an¬†auto from CC1 to Ultadanga.The outlet will fall on your left if you choose the¬†aforementioned route.

We were invited as part of team Panchphoron for food tasting.The restaurant¬†has an overall average seating capacity and also has an outside take-away¬†counter.We were introduced to the owners who are quite young and have done a¬†commendable job in coming a long way from owning a roadside food stall to an¬†AC restaurant!Considering the location,the prices are not too high.

Stone's throw away from my place! The place might not look appealing from the outside but nothing much to impress inside as well! Extremely crammed up, but if they focus only on home deliveries then they should do well!
The food is okay ish.. Tried the usual chinese dishes!
            
On a second attempt, tried their home delivery. The chicken dumpling, ordered after seeing renowned reviews was a horrible choice. 5 meager chicken balls rolled about in the box with no taste, and a huge chunk of money paid for, extremely disappointing. The fried chicken was still bearable but high on salt, as a result of which my entire taste palette went for a toss. Think twice even thrice before ordering. I suggest, order only the known chinese dishes, they make them still better.

There has always been a dearth of decent eateries in and around Salt Lake Sector-I. Having my residence at a close proximity to City Centre-I, our only decent option were two restaurants at Kwality. While one had long lost its charm, the other one sadly shifted to Salt Lake Sector-II for reasons best known to them. While this particular area flourished with the introduction of a mall, the restaurants located here were all posh, and made it difficult for middle income residents nearby to enjoy sumptuous meal at a cheap and affordable price.

Then came Fikar Not Foodies, a decent sized eatery, located very close to CA Island. If you are coming from Salt Lake Gate Number 1, take a right turn from PNB Island, go straight till CA Island and then turn left. Walk for 2 minutes and the restaurant should fall to your right. For those coming from City Center, come straight from Bhikharam Island to the Petrol Pump Island. Take a left turn and keep walking for a good 8-10 minutes. The next island in front of you would be CA Island and this restaurant would fall on your left.

The restaurant looked quite elegant from outside. Yes, that is the word I would use. For a small sized eatery, it has maintained high class ambiance and the hygiene factor has been surprisingly adhered to. The bright glowboard put at the top is hard to miss. While there is a bright crystal glass door to your left, the right portion in the front seems to house a tawa. With a fire extinguisher hung outside, it clearly shows that they are giving safety a paramount importance. A couple of chairs placed outside, probably for visitors to wait for their take-away order, you are bound to get impressed by their neat and clean thinking even before you step inside the main restaurant.

While you enter, you see a mundane white wall to your left, but then the color has been beautifully transformed into something lively with abrupt paintings and graffiti of various items relating to food, including cutlery, bowls, glasses, vegetables, fruits and others. The bright yellow colored wall to your front perfectly complements and balances the white color, while another portion inside the room speaks out volumes about several inspirational and motivational quotes to cheer your lousy and depressed mind. This place can accommodate probably 25 people at the most, which includes 4 set of tables and a couple of chairs surrounding each of them and a separate portion housing 3-4 individual chairs, something you may have seen at KFC set up for loners.

I was here with a group of acclaimed and renowned bloggers for a food tasting event representing ‚ÄòPanchphoron‚Äô. The owner had carefully carved out for us a set menu and hence saved us the time of digging into the menu and spend some precious time behind it. Following were the dishes/drink/deserts we were offered:

Starters:

1) Chicken Sui Mai: Soft and flavorful bits of chicken put together, wrapped in a wonton and steamed to perfection. Garnished with ball peppers, this one almost melt in my mouth. I somehow felt that the chicken lacked a bit of flavor and a slight notch-up would have had made wonders. Served with a delightful Szechuan dip, it was a perfect accompaniment to the Sui-Mai.

2) Garlic Stuffed Mushroom: If you are a staunch non-veggie and for some reason you cannot have the same on a particular day, ‚ÄòFikar Not‚Äô! This dish is an ideal partner on your sad days and won‚Äôt let you feel gloomy. The mushrooms inside packed a punch, the batter was just about right, the garlic content wasn‚Äôt overpowering; there is hardly anything I could find wrong about this dish. Garnished beautifully, the visual pleasure was equally comforting and soothing as the taste was.

3) Lat Me Kai Chicken: A popular starter, this had thin shreds of chicken, coated in a batter and fried till crispy and golden brown. The batter lacked juice, and hence inspite of the decent sprinkling of sesame seeds and a wonderful presentation, this dish failed to impress me. My first presumption was that the portions would be juicier, but unfortunately it was not. Expecting a better dish the next time I would probably drop in.

4) Crystal Prawn: Golden Fried Prawns reincarnated with a different name. The marination was almost negligible, and this had mostly decent sized prawns coated in a batter and fried till light brown. The portions weren‚Äôt heavily fried and hence were devoid of any excess oil. A perfect starter, if you prefer something simple, yet flavorful. Accompanied again with the Szechuan dip, this was probably my favorite starter among all!

5) Chicken Dumpling: Bits and pieces of chicken put together to form a dumpling and then coated in flour alongwith long grains of rice and steamed to perfection. Quite a unique concept and a varied alternative to the regular Momo, the very appearance of these dumplings looked innovating and commendable. The garnishing could have been better, as the carrots had basically dried up and not only did they look common across all the dishes, but also took out the visual appeal from the dish.

Main Course:

6) Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles: Not too overpowering with garlic, I felt that the heat portion was missing. The noodles were beautifully steamed though and hence did not look like the horrible noodles served at the road side. I quite liked the blending of the vegetables along with crispy look at the top. This dish needs to be a bit more fresh as dryness had settled in giving it almost a bland taste. Suggested to have this with a side dish and not as a single item.

7) FnF Special Fried Rice: Mixed Fried Rice, regarded as a special item here. Comprising of meat, vegetable and the perfect blend of spices, we could not enjoy this dish due to the excess addition of star anise. Perhaps a rare mistake, this dish was just a perfect excuse to have a Rice as a whole without having any side dish without it. Ample amount of meat and vegetable, including mushroom, which is a rare item found anywhere when it comes to Mixed Fried Rice.

8) Kung Pao Chicken: Stir Fried Chicken, tossed in the right amount of spices and accompanied with chilli peppers, peanuts and vegetables. The gravy was thick, yet had an aromatic and flavorful taste. The chicken portions were quite soft and was a perfect excuse to have with the Fried Rice.

9) Fish in Oyster Sauce: Oyster Sauce happens to be one of the major reasons why people are so inclined towards Thai Food. Sliced fish, coated in a thin batter, fried to perfection and then cooked in oyster sauce. One hardly needs to describe the taste for this sauce as this happens to be one of the most favorite ingredients around.

Deserts:

10) Darshan with Vanilla Ice Cream: Supposed to be a popular desert, this was a let down. The fried noodles weren‚Äôt sweet and the melting Vanilla Ice Creams made the texture soggy. The honey content was almost nil and it seemed the person who prepared this had little knowledge of how this desert is supposed to be made!	

This place has just started few months back and has a potential to grow into something a lot bigger than it is as of this moment. The menu is just set right with abundant choices to pamper you with. The ambiance is classy, the service is fast, the hygiene is well maintained. The only let down are a couple of dishes, which I believe can certainly be worked upon. I would not advise anyone to come here if they are looking for world class food, but if you are looking for something simple in an affordable range so as not to burn a hole in your pocket, this is the place you should drop by.

Fikar not Foodies is a small restaurant near CA island, Salt Lake. Quite easy to reach from CC1, recently attended a bloggers' meet cum food tasting session here as part of PanchPhoron. The restaurant looks not so much of a looker from outside. A bright glosign has the name on it, beside it is the kitchen & takeaway counter. The outlet itself seats around 24 people.
As we entered the outlet, we were introduced to the owner. A young guy he explained us how he used to run a small roadside stall, & from there he has upgraded that to a proper eatery. Pretty commendable job. Considering the fact that the prices are quite pocket friendly for a outlet near City Centre.
The Chef had prepared a set food menu for us along with some mocktails & dessert. Without further ado, we dug into the dishes.

Mocktails:
Passion Fruit Punch / Lemonade / Masala Cold Drinks
The passion fruit punch was the best among the three, a bit sweet. The whole mix whipped to a creamy blend. The syrup content in the lemonade was a bit on the lower side. The masala coke was okay.

Starters:

Chicken Sui Mai:
A popular dumpling item, this one was quite good. The wrap was a bit chewy though, a softer version would be no doubt appreciated much more. Served along with a schezwan dip, I preferred to have the sui mai on its own though.

Crystal Prawn:
The item is generally known by the name of 'Golden Fried Prawn' . This one was good too. In fact the best among the lot. The outer coating thin & crispy. While the prawn inside juicy & flavourful. However the accompanying schezwan sauce could be replaced with the more popular honey chilli dip.

Garlic Stuffed Mushroom:
Button Mushrooms stuffed with a mix & cooked in a garlic sauce. Another great starter for sure. The garlic wasn't overpowering in smell yet giving it the distinct taste to the dish.

Chicken Dumpling:
This wasn't the regular momo, or anything remotely resembling it. The actual name for the dish is supposed to be 'Steamed Pearl Balls'. Chicken Meat Balls coated in long grained rice & steamed to perfection. This one again was a good choice for a starter. However the accompanying sauce by now started feeling too monotonous for all the dishes.

Lat Me Kai Chicken:
Chinese Crispy fried chicken , these shreds of chicken were thinly coated & cooked in a hot n sour sauce with ample amount of sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The chicken was a bit dry, though overall the dish was crispy & tasty like anything.

Main Course:

Kung Pao Chicken:
A very popular stir fried chicken dish made with peanuts, veggies & bell peppers. The gravy was dark, & quite aromatic the taste being a superb mix of salty, sweet, sour & hot at the same time. The chicken pieces were soft & succulent. The dish is a perfect one to go with the relatively plain rice dishes.

Fish in Oyster Sauce:
A popular dish, this one had some problem. The fish seemed to be somehow stinking. And it was not the oyster sauce, cause the gravy tasted fine. But couldn't have the fish at all. May be it was a stale fish, may be they had goofed up something. Whatever it may be, this dish was a let down.

Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles:
Decently prepared noodles. In fact considering the price it was rather good. The dish is dry, really dry so remember to team it up with a side dish with ample amount of sauce.

FnF Special Rice:
This fried rice, tagged as special, had all the ingredients imaginable in it. Chicken, egg, prawn, mushroom, you name it the rice has it. However this dish again had some problem in it. It excessively smelled of star anise. The cook could not find any plausible explanation for this though. So although the dish looked quite good, could not really be enjoyed .

Desserts:

Fried Date Pan Cake:
Although pancakes are usually regarded as a breakfast items. A twist in the preparing can lead to this stunning dessert. However the pan cakes were not as sweet it needed to be, a little extra syrup in the filling or drizzling a little more honey would have helped

Darshan with vanilla ice cream:
This one too was a let down. The hugely popular, so chinese-ey , yet not actually Chinese dessert found in any restaurant was prepared really bad. The flat noodles weren't sweet at all. Quite soggy , & the vanilla ice cream scoops too melted to be enjoyed properly. Surely this dish needs n urgent makeover.

Overall it was a mixed experience. The starters were quite good. In fact perfect for a evening snack. But half the main course had problems in it, & failed badly in the desserts section. Also the accompanying dip/sauce can do with some variations.However I am not writing this restaurant off, as it's a small outlet, & quite an experimental endeavour for them. More importantly the prices are quite pocket friendly to ask for a decent feedback. Hopefully they will rectify their mistakes & be ready with better quality next time & truely say 'fikar not foodies' we have got all ends covered.
Till then
Happy Eating
Cheers

I ordered a couple of Chicken thukpas today. The good point is from the first look I could see that there was no oil floating over the thukpa soup. I tasted it and found it to be good. Perhaps it would have been better if you can make it a little spicy but that is not a point to take so much seriously. Your delivery was sharp on time. Looking forward to order some of the more dishes from your food joint. Cheers!!!

I was looking for some Thai soup and this place came up on Swiggy.I ordered a non veg Thai soup and Chicken lat me kai.The chicken dish was wonderful, perfect soft chicken in a tangy sweet sauce.But the soup ruined it.I absolutely hated the flavour, the chicken pieces were stringy and it had a strong turmeric smell.Chinese takeaways even serve better thai soup.So when a place is tagged in Thai food, this bad thai soup is not expected.

I ate here twice, the ambience is cosy, the food tasty and the staff very polite and helpful. Good Chinese joints are needed in salt lake so that one can sit at home and order delicious Chinese, FNF provides just that. I hope to enjoy more lipsmacking dishes from here.

Ordered the Non Veg Noodles Combo (1. Chicken Noodles, 2. Chilli Chicken, 3. Crispy Noodles, 4. Crispy Potato, 5. Kimchee Salad) for home delivery. The food exceeded my expectations. So much quantity of food at price below 200/- was actually a surprise. In terms of quality, I must say the crispy potato was a stand-out. Had the chicken noodles were a tad warmer, I would have given it a 5-rating. Would recommend this eatery for a budget dinner.

If there is any one who takes this review seriously then this is for them to know that this restaurant has provided the worst service ive ever experienced. We ordered at 8:15 and had to wait for more than 2 hours to receive our order.. if you cant deliver,then please inform your customers prior to making them wait indefinitely. My guests had to leave without eating food from your restaurant. I cant decide whom it insults more,you or me?
Maybe you know the answer.

This place is situated quite near to city centre. Decided to give it a visit this evening. Tried their dragon rolls which were quite good but their chilli garlic noodles were highly disappointing. Wanted to try their stuffed mushroom but it wasnt availble. Staff is nice and courteous. Quantity of the dishes is okay.

Visited this place today this is a new place opened¬† with a small food joint in sector 1 area fully vacant restaurant not a single customers were their staffs were friendly but not trained properly they need a vast change in service and smartness in dealing with customers.
The food quality is so so they welcome with some sought of choupsy which in my language i will say bhujiya¬† üòù ordered Singapore Veg Fried Rice which was very good in tastes but was not served hot as Chili Panner which was also good in taste but was bit spicy 
Don't expect much but overall food quality was good will say if they make some improvements in some parts then this¬† restaurant will be good hangout place for family & friends in coming days

A nice and quaint place situated at the heart of Salt Lake. Reasonably priced,the restaurant serves a good variety of Chinese, Tibetan and Thai dishes. Personal favourites include the pan fried momo, the hakka noodles, the hunan chicken and the black bean chicken. 

The staff is very polite and cooperative. The interiors are well lit and the over all package would definitely want to make you visit multiple times.

One of the third class restaurant I have ever seen 
The staff was so bad and rude 
They don't know how to talk with customers 
And the food quality is so so 
Price is ok but not worth of my money 

We ordered hot Soups its ok but crispy chicken was very less in quantity  and taste is similar to street food 

Don't visit to this restaurant

Visited this place recently. They have opened their gate very recently. Its a small food joint in sector1 area. Don't expect much but overall food quality was good. We had ordered thai rice with fish garlic. Taste was good and upto the mark. As a starter we had staffed mushroom with pepper. We went there on a weekday and only customers they had were we. But hopefully they'll keep up with competition around. Staffs were friendly but not yet trained properly. Wish them all the best.
