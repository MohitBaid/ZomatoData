Now where do I really begin with....Fatty Bao is a very popular name among the Japanese cuisine lovers in most of the other Metropolitans of the Country. Well, to Simplify let's start with the decor , the place had neat, crisp Japanese decor , Japanese lanterns, few paintings and a lit up bar...simple and classy. Now the food, and Oh my food! The food is FANTASTIC! Right from their specialty Bao , to the Sushi to the Ramen bowl..Each and every dish is phenomenal. The taste is class apart. If you are there definitely try the Bao and do get a customised bowl of Ramen. The sushi is great as well, but only if you are a sushi lover or you know how sushi is supposed to taste, but for the people who are absolutely new to Japanese cuisine the Bao and Ramen are a must try!! Overall love the place!! So so very glad that it is finally here in Kolkata after getting all of it's share of Popularity in Mumbai , Bangalore and Delhi...!

Amazing addition to the Culinary scenery of Kolkata, heard mixed reviews of The Fatty Bao, but I must admit they are all wrong & in accurate. I had tried 6 dishes & I must say leaving one all other were fantastic. Found the green curry to be slightly salty & chicken a bit raw. Otherwise Prawn dimsum, chicken sambal bao to the Cocoa Caramel dessert, all were amazing. Decor is very tasteful. It can be slightly expensive if you order imported spirits with dinner. But must go for everyone

The Fatty Bao is here and I just can't keep calm! After wooing Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi, The Fatty Bao has finally opened it's 7th outlet in Kolkata, on the 8th floor at Fort Knox. 

The place is gorgeous to say the least. With a live sized window and a beautiful view of the Kolkata skyline, this restaurant is sure to win hearts. The interior is done up in pop colours and exudes vibrancy. The seating arrangement is well placed, but frankly, I loved the high tables near the huge window. You could enjoy your meal with a breathtaking view of the Kolkata sky! A special mention should be made of the row of lanterns which adds to the splendour of The Fatty Bao.

I was thrilled when I was invited here for a food tasting event! The place left me awestruck with its beautiful ambience and lovely food. Let's start talking food now!


| Bottled Cocktails |

This is a very unique concept where you could actually mix your own cocktails. I loved The Passion Mule which had white rum, mango and passion fruit. Another cocktail worth trying is The Elixir with bourbon whiskey, maple syrup, apple and pear. 


| Sushi |

• Rainbow Sushi - This was veg sushi and I couldn't believe how good this tasted. Was simply blown!

• Crab Meat and Tobiko Sushi - If you're a sushi lover like me, you just can't give this a miss. It was stuffed with crabmeat and tasted heavenly!


| Baos |

• Char Siu Pork Bao - This was my favourite!!! The baos were soft and the pork stuffing was juicy and succulent. The baos were stuffed with pork belly imported from Sri Lanka, BBQ sauce, green apple kimchi and scallions. This item is a must have! 

• Shengjian Bao - This was a closed Bao, different from the earlier one. This too tasted fantastic. It was stuffed with bacon and egg and was served with three different kinds of dips. 


| Appetizer |

• Thai Spicy Beef Salad - This beef salad was a treat to my taste buds. Loaded with beef keema, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, bird's eye chilli and this fresh herbs, this salad tasted amazing. 

• The Duck Nachos - This dish had five spice shredded roast duck, hoisin mayonnaise, crispy duck skin and tofu cheese sauce. The nachos were crispy and the roast duck topping on the nachos tasted out of the world. Strongly recommended! 

• The Fatty Bao PB&J - This was the stunner of the afternoon, which happens to be the best seller here! Twice cooked imported pork belly was first slow braised and then crisped with miso mustard jam. This is the best Pork belly you can find in the whole city, hands down! The outer skin was crispy while deep inside it was soft and juicy. The sweet jam was a perfect accompaniment with the pork belly.


| Main Course |

• Chasu Ramen - Finally we have a place in Kolkata that serves authentic Ramen. The Chasu Ramen tasted just perfect. The broth was slow cooked with pork stock, bacon and soy tare. If you're looking for the best soupy noodles in town, here it is! 


| Dessert |

• Cocoa Caramel -  This dish had milk chocolate cream, hazelnut praline crisp, flourless chocolate cake, toasted meringue, salted caramel gel and salted caramel ice cream. Honestly, this was one of the best desserts had by me.

• The Zen Forest - If you want art on your plate, this is it! Created with a number of components like yuzu parfait, black sesame sponge, green tea moss, beetroot and black pepper sorbet, sesame nougatine, Valrhona chocolate twigs and microgreens, this dish was such a beauty. This dish had a blend of various flavours which was quite amazing! 


With this we ended our lunch at The Fatty Bao! It definitely is a must visit place for all Pan Asian gluttons like me. This restaurant has beautiful ambience, impeccable service and brilliant food - enough to win hearts!

Great Food
Great Ambience
Great Staff

We ordered
Crab Dimsums
Shaking Beef - great starter for drinks
Chicken Shambol Bao
Char sue Bao
Chasu Ramen

Taste was at par with other Fatty bao Bangalore and Mumbai but the only thing is that amount is less compared to them. Shaking Beef amount was less and the amount of ramen in Chasu was also less but pork was sufficient though.
But will surely visit again. The staff is really helpful and ever smiling.
Keep up the good work.

The Food, The Ambience, The Music, The Seating, The Washroom ( :D )....I simply could not find fault with this place. We had the Char Siu Bao, Basil Noodles, Chongin Chicken as mains. Dessert was a yummy Japanese cheesecake. The place is Pan Asian with authentic Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese cuisine. It has good options for vegetarians too as one in our group was a veggie who went ga ga over the veg fare. I would rate this as a restaurant where you can go back again and again...I am going back definitely :D

I had gone with my friend for lunch. Kitchen shuts down at 3 for staff lunch and I reached at 3:15. They still took me in and served me the most delicious Pork Bao with Seafood Pad Thai and 3 Bowls Chicken, food was delicious and hot and not that expensive. We had a great time also the decor is worth a look around. Great ambiance with friendly waiters. Really had a great time!

Situated at fort nox, 8th floor, The Fatty Bao is Pan Asian restaurant. Their unique item is the baozi. U can choose from both vegetarian and non vegetarian variants. We tried the broths as well: chasu (pork and bacon) and fatty pho (chicken); both were delicious and filling. Their desserts were sounding appetising; however as we were only two of us we could only try the coco caramel. A perfect blend of bitter and sweet. I must try.

Ordered char siu bao as well as the pb&j. The bao tasted out of the world, with the pork being very tender and juicy. After that the pb&j didn't seem as much appealing. For drinks, we ordered a red wine sangria and sake followed by a bora bora. I really loved the sangria. But the quantity of sake they provided really disappointed my boyfriend.

I'd done Fatty Bao at Mumbai last year but our visit last night to the Cal restaurant was absolutely delightful ! I can only have superlatives on my mind for the place. Super delicious food combined with excellent service will surely win anyone over. I'd tried the Via Malaysia ramen bowl... lip smacking! Raring to go again :) Kudos to all who run the place!

Asian Food, Bao, Camac Street, cocktails, Delhi, Fatty Bao, Kolkata, Ramen, Restaurant, Review, Romantic. One of our favorite places opens up in my home town Kolkata. The Fatty Bao is a part of the Olive group, that has some of the most popular restaurants. This is Fatty’s seventh outpost in India, after Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai, and the space it opened up in is a prime location and offers an enviable view. The food and beverage teams draw inspiration from Asia’s diverse culinary repertoire and Executive Chef Prashanth menu is both inspired and unique. In Fatty Bao Kolkata, there are various new and creative additions to the menu like Robatayaki skewers, new bottled cocktails, and some interesting small plates. As a Fatty regular, I love the uniformity across their outlets, and some of the familiar dishes like ramens, dim sums, sushi are on the menu here as well.

From the inception it has opened, I was waiting to come here. I had come a day before as well but couldn't get a table and the worst part being the non availability of reserving a table via call. In fact, the next day I had to come at 6:30 just to reserve a table for 7 but it was on first cum first serve basis so I reached at 7 sharp and was amazed to see reservations being taken in the register! So, we settled for the high table, fortunately the management woman was kind enough to give us that one. The place is wow, there's no doubt about that! Authentic Buddhist, Japanese and Chinese feel with paintings on the wall, paper lights and the big glass window with wooden bars and flooring! One of the servers actually taught us the method of eating with chopsticks. The music was super. Coming to the food here's what we had ordered for:
Drinks:
1. Peach fizzler.
2. Sakura Sakura.
Starters:
1. Rainbow rolls- sushi.
2. Mushroom and bell pepper Bao.
3. Crystal dumpling- dimsums.
Main course:
1. Veg and chilly garlic noodles.
2. Vegetable greens.
Well, I've had amazing authentic Asian food in Republic of Noodles( Hyderabad) and even Ping's Orient- Calcutta, I was a bit disappointed since Fatty Bao has been a rage with Calcutta goers. It lacks option in noodles as far as vegetarianism is concerned, also the Bao wasn't of my choice, I've had finest dumplings in other joints but have to admit, the rainbow roll sushi was my favourite. First time actually that I liked something of Japanese cuisine. Will actually be coming for the Fatty Hill dessert, though.

Went there with a friend who had already been to the Bangalore outlet. According to him, the ambience and decoration of the Kolkata outlet is much better. Moving on to the food, it was the first time I was having bao, so we ordered the "beef bulgogi", and "char siu bao". Both were delicious , but we found that the pork one (char siu) was a bit overly spiced. Then we shared the "crab meat and tobiko sushi". While it was very good, it is to be noted that like most other places, this place also serves the American sushi rolls and not the authentic Japanese preparation. Then we ordered "pork, cabbage and scallion gyōza", followed by "shaking beef" which were just average. For main course we had "the fatty bao pb&j" and "tantanmen" ramen, and both of them were pretty good. Didn't have the opportunity to try out any dessert but will try some other time. The was something around 3600. I would like to conclude by saying that the restaurant is indeed expensive, but if pocket pinch is not a factor, then you'll surely enjoy your food there.

For starters, the location of The Fatty Bao is great. Easy to locate and having adequate parking, your visit is great right from the start. The restaurant is on the 8th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street and has a view of Victoria Memorial and the St. Paul's Cathedral. The decor inside is fun and quirky, especially enjoyed the paper lanterns and the tableware.
The menu is extensive and the service staff was quite prompt in answering our questions. The food isn't your usual Asian fare, and the menu boasts of trendy Asian food with generous portions. The "Fatty Bao PB&J" which was twice cooked pork belly, was an instant hit, as were the prawn and sesame toasties. The "Shaking Beef" left us shaking from the amazing flavours. The tempura fish bao was slightly on the bland side but enjoyable nonetheless. For main course the Jungle Beef Curry was absolutely delicious with robust flavours of lemongrass, Kaffir lime and galangal.
To add to it all, the service was prompt. Ending the meal with some chamomile tea rounded off a rather perfect meal.
Will definitely be revisiting as once is not enough to do justice to the great menu!

The ambience is very fun and cosy too with the Victoria in the horizon... the menu is elaborate and makes you think before you order which is in a good way .... quirky and innovative the food comes to your table quickly. Each item on your table will have a difference in flavour and will not be a step brother of Kolkata chilli chicken that you get in most of the Asian joints claiming to be different ! The raw materials are fresh hence the food is tastier ! Loved their junglee beef curry, Shaking beef and pork belly ! Will want to go back to try more of what is on their menu !

Situated on the 8th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street (the same building as Monkey Bar) it is fairly decent sized but you never seem to find a table right away here without a booking. An indication of how successful this establishment has been. The interiors are well decorated and there are a decent number of tables. There’s even seating at the bar.

Serving Asian and Sushi this restaurant is not for all. One needs to have developed a taste when it comes to Asian Cuisine as well as for Sushi. I ordered two types of Sushi, the SPICY MUSHROOMS, ICEBERG LETTUCE AND TANUKI Sushi rolls (8 pieces) and the ASPARAGUS TEMPURA, CREAM CHEESE AND SESAME Sushi Rolls (8 pieces). Both were great, delicious. I wouldn’t have minded a second order of the same. 

Then I tried the MUSHROOM AND BELL PEPPER BAO. I have to admit that before trying it I was skeptical but this dish breached the limits of my expectations. Though the first bite felt weird, a bit sweet it all went uphill from there on.

In the ‘small plates’, I tried the KIMCHI FRIES and FATTY LOTUS ROOT. The Kimchi Fries was very okayish, you can easily give it a pass. But on the other hand, the Fatty Lotus Root was delicious. It was lip smacking delicious and I ended ordering another portion at the end. 

I didn’t enjoy the SICHUAN DRY STIR FRIED LONG GREEN BEANS at all. I may not be a big fan when it comes to greens but I can confidently say that this dish was just not up to the standard. The VEGETABLE AND GARLIC NOODLES were decent, another dish that you can give a pass. The GARLIC FRIED RICE tasted good, it would be a great combination with a gravy dish, and filling as well.

For deserts I tried the FATTY HILL and COCOA CARAMEL. Both these dishes were amazing. Mouth watering, Lip Smacking, delicious, I just don’t have enough words to describe how good they were. The objective of eating dessert is to end your meal on a high, on a good note. These two desserts did more than that. Both were gone in a matter of a few minutes. No matter what you may try at this restaurant in appetizers and mains, but for dessert I would definitely recommend these two dishes. A perfect ending to my meal.
Overall, a good experience. The interiors, the food and the service all were good. A place which one can go on regular basis.

P.S. the lifts are slow and small. During hectic hours it can be a pain to go up and down but then that's really no criteria to judge the restaurant.

I love Asian and sushi so I had to go check this newly hyped place. To be honest I went with low expectations as I was quite disappointed with the last highly hyped-‘pings’. I walked in a little late afternoon and was actually shocked to see the place buzzing with people and absolutely packed(ofcourse it’s the festive season, but I didn’t bother to consider that). I waited at the bar for my friends and a table. The waiting area at the bar is very comfortable unlike many others. Frankly I wouldn’t have minded sitting at the bar throughout with the girls. Anyway so we started off the some sangria and beer which was as it’s supposed to be. In starters we started off with the green mango and papaya salad which was really good. Both Crystal dumpling and asparagus tempura cream cheese and sesame were delicious. The khimchi fries were a let down. The mushroom and bell pepper bao was yummy. Via Malaysia was ok.We ended the course with coco caramel which didn’t only look amazing but in taste too. Super impressed and would definitely go back for more

Fresh new addition to the Asian cuisine scene. Loved the interesting blend of flavors that gave regular Asian food a whole new twist. Loved the char siu bao, with its wonderful green apple kimchi addition giving it a refreshing and tangy twist. Really enjoyed the dancing prawns and the lamb massaman curry. The fatty hill was a perfect finish to a sumptuous meal.

I was moderately disappointed by The Fatty Bao, especially after all the good things I have been hearing about the place. Also the fact that they are run by the owners of The Monkey Bar, a place I absolutely adore, made expectations even higher. 

The good part : the decor is on point. We arrived at little past seven and the place with its Asian graffiti and hanging ceiling lights made for a unique ambiance. The service was prompt and professional. 

First up were the 'Dancing Prawns' and their signature 'The fatty bao PB&J'. The prawns were very soft, like really, really melt in the mouth kind. Now while that can be a good thing for some, I like my prawns slightly crunchy. The pork belly was great though! They apparently import their pork from Sri Lanka and no wonder it was one of the best I've had in the city. The name PB&J is obviously a word play (Peanut Butter and Jelly = Pork Belly and Jelly) and I was interested in seeing what the jelly was. The miso mustard jelly however was way too sparse to be appreciated and for me that was kind of a missed opportunity to make this dish even better.

We opted for the 'Roast duck and kimchi fried rice' along with the Malaysian Chicken Capitan curry for our mains. The fired rice was peppered with ample slices of roasted duck (duh!) and scrambled eggs and was my favorite dish of the evening. Again a minor nitpick : while there were plenty of cabbage slices in the rice, I am a little skeptical about whether it was 'kimchi' (a traditional Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables, mainly cabbage) or not as they tasted like stir fried. The chicken capitan curry was thick and creamy, with generous pieces of chicken, peanuts and friend onions. 

For our dessert, we went for the most unique one on their menu : 'The Zen Forest'. Unfortunately while the dish looks like a million bucks and some of the individual components work really well, together it does not come across as a cohesive item. The centerpiece of the dessert is a beetroot and black pepper sorbet that tastes pretty bland. The three cubes of yuza parfait are unique though. Made from yuzu (a Japanese citrus fruit) juice, the parfaits were a great combination of tangy and savory. The green tea moss and Valrohna (a popular French chocolate brand) twigs were unique unto intself but did not add much to the dish. 

The Fatty Bao is just starting off and they have ample scope as well as time for improvement : they have a very distinctive menu that brings something new to the food scene in Kolkata and it'd be a shame if they did not.

The Fatty Bao comes to Kolkata and it was always on my wish list ever since I dined at their Bangalore outlet. Ambience and decor is as lovely as it gets. Staff were very courteous and friendly and took great care of my Asian fine dining experience. 
My favorite - 1) The Fatty Bao PB&J- The tastiest pork belly I have ever tried. Highly recommended. 
2)Sakura Sakura - A cool and refreshing mocktail to die for. Another thumbs up. 
Although didn't quite like the Chicken Bao. 
Definitely a must visit for Asian dining lovers.

Such an utterly disappointing lunch today, being Christmas Eve Lunch! I took my family given that I'm from Bombay and have been to the Bangalore outlet in Indira Nagar. Both outlets are so fabulous in Bombay and Bangalore so suffice to say to say the Kolkata edition disappointed from the time I entered. The Decor was a sad bored effort along with the food (given that I know the Menu inside out). The chicken bao was Just about decent, Presentation was atrocious. The "dancing prawns" served in  a city like Calcutta which is probably the most food friendly city in the county, is was what you'd get in a local street food joint. But! the piece de resistance was the smoked BBQ spare Ribs priced at Rs. 500/- plus tax was 1 pc of three skinny ribs joined together with NO meat. I was so disgusted that I insisted on leaving the minute we finished the unpalatable food. I am so so shocked at this complete rip off and most importantly tarnishing the brand name in a foodie city like Calcutta. It's Obvious that the Calcutta Franchisee owners think the patrons are total idiots in the City.. Ill exposed unsophisticated. And to all future patrons of this Place.. word to the wise, this isn't the true Fatty Bao Chain. It's complete hog wash. Shame on the management for duping its customers in the third week of its launch. This chain's Days will be numbered if preventive measures are not taken. Sad.

The hype around this place probably was the reason of my disappointment. First of all, this place really doesn't have much to offer for vegetarians! With limited veg options we tried two of the dim sums, the bao and the main course which again was quite limited because of no choice in curry. The highlight of the meal was the jasmin rice with spinach and mushrooms. The drinks too were very average!

Hoping for some new additions in the menu soon!

Disappointing is the word which comes to my mind when I remember the food served here. Fatty Bao in Bangalore is one of my all time favorite restaurants and I swear by their food. Alas Fatty Bao Kolkata did not live up to my expectations and I actually felt sad after eating the food there. Things that went wrong - COLD food and that too all the menu items ordered, undercooked wild mushroom & truffle oil dimsum, too salty char siu bao, fatty lotus root which was hard and there were no snow peas to be found, could not identify nori (seaweed) in chasu ramen with chewy pork and a very thin broth, lastly a long waiting time for getting the bill! Now, things that went well - to make up for the lack of food quality, we were offered cocoa caramel dessert on the house which was beautiful both presentation and tastewise. The salted caramel icecream and the flourless chocolate cake in it were amazing. The cake has the texture of silken tofu and was more like pudding and went perfectly well with the salted icecream. The restaurant staff were polite and offered to replace the food items, but frankly my patience had run out. The ambience of the restaurant was nice and we were requested to visit the place again for a better experience but I doubt that happening anytime soon. I wish the food had lived up to the fatty bao standards since one thing can go wrong but not all the ordered items. The 2.5/5 I have given is owing to the dessert, ambience and courteousness of the staff. The other 2.5 is lost due to poor food.

This place recently opened up on the 8th floor of Fort Knox building, Camac Street, at a walking distance fromt the Camac St. Pantaloons. I visited last night and to my surprise, I was asked if I had made reservations earlier. We hadn't, but they managed to get us a table anyway. Soon, it was jam-packed with people. It has been  continuously featured on Instagram food pages which I believe has resulted in the mad rush. The decor is lovely. Yellow hues and paper lanterns. We tried :
1. Their signature Chinese chorizo bacon and egg bao. It's quite similar to Tai Paos available in certain momo shops around Jadavpur. Only way better. 
2. Curried flat noodle with seafood
3. Roasted duck and kimchi fried rice
4. Asparagus and bacon fried rice
5. Lamb masamman curry
I loved the kimchi rice and the flat noodles. The curry had a subtle flavour of coconut milk. The meat was soft. The quantity decently suited the five of us. I only wished they had a few more curry items. Definitely visiting again.

In all its glory, this one of a kind, chic Asian gastro Bar finally waddles into the dining scene of Kolkata after creating waves in other metro cities. But let me tell you why Fatty Bao Kolkata is different than all the other outlets : the Izakaya style dining which is basically a concept drawn from Japanese gastrobars meant for sharing variety of small plates of food in a large group so as to bring about an informal fun eating experience. Located on the 8th floor of the Fort Knox Building, the place is beautifully lit up with a view adding to its charm even more. The ambience is brimming with fresh flavours and soft music which compliments their exotic dishes quite well. Here's all that I laid my hands on and filled my tummy with :

>> Dancing Prawns (4.5/5) : The perfect blend of Thai spices made this a melt-in-the-mouth kind. Prawns were stir fried to the right proportion and the sautéed veggies were of perfect texture, not too soft; not too raw.
>> Pok Pok Chicken (5/5) : As I'm always on the lookout for overtly spicy dishes in any and every place, this particular starter managed to grab my attention. Crunchy chicken wings, coated in spicy sauce is just what I was looking for.
>> BBQ chorizo Bao (4/5) : Baos are a must have here, so I thought of ordering something unusual : baos which are closed, appears like a dimsum; only the outer layer is much thicker and chewy just how a Bao should be. Inside there's bbq flavoured chicken bites with some veggies, which tasted mildly spicy; more on the sweeter side.

Feeling thirsty already? Well, then Fatty Bao has some of the finest cocktails up their sleeves :

>> Bora Bora (5/5) : This signature drink is not to be missed! The silken smooth taste punched with coconut water will soothe the taste buds for good. The cocktail is based on Vodka, gin and a hint of passion fruit makes it all the more likeable.

>> Passion Mule (5/5) : A bottled cocktail based on white rum, ginger ale, mango and passion fruit. First of it's kind in the city, this particular type of cocktail needs a DIY where other ingredients are to be mixed along with the pouring from the bottle itself.

Now, the star dish :

>> Zen forest (5/5) : One of the classic desserts at Fatty Bao, in this the ingredients are deconstructed and plated in a way that the whole appearance resembles that of a forest. Consisting of exotic ingredients like yuzu parfait, sesame nougatine, green tea moss and chocolate twigs; this is surely a must have here. Taste it to believe it!

With that, I ended my food journey here only to come back soonest. TFB should definitely be your next stop if you still haven't visited! Experience foodgasm in its truest sense 💖

Amazing food and ambiance. Definitely going again. We are vegetarians so the order was mostly a repeat. The open baos are really good. We tried the eggplant and mushroom ones. The truffle dimsums were on the repeat too. 
The glass noodle salad was very refreshing and perfectly made. We were so full till the time we ordered dessert. But ended up eating 3 of those! Beautiful presentation of the desserts. And worth every bite! This was the highlight of our meal.

A new place where we went out of curiosity. The overall ambiance is quite nice. the service is excellent. 
What we ordered: Spicy salmon with cream cheese and cucumber sushi, prawn and garlic chive dim-sum, ghost chicken salad, thai spicy beef salad, duck nachos, the fatty bao PB&J, wasabi prawns, roast duck and kimchi fried rice, cocoa caramel.
Cocktails: Passion Mule, the Elixir, Cool-ade, Mandalay Bay, Fatty Sour..

The food was well  balanced. We specially asked if the 'beef' they are serving is buffalo meat and their reply was in the negative. The thai salad was actually very good. The nachos served were crisp and not soggy. The shredded duck topping on the nachos was spot on. The PB&J is their signature dish and it is highly recommended.

The bottled cocktails are to be had with care. They are quite strong and the customer is cautioned about it which I found nice. They are not miserly about the serving of alcohol in their cocktails..

Ambience: good. i do not care much about this part if the food is good.
Service: excellent
Quality: Good
Quantity : excellent
Pocket pinch: 7000 for three.

overall, Highly recommended.

The opening of Fatty Bao in Kolkata was something long awaited. Asian food has really been doing great deals around the city and this new outlet has just justified that statement. Let's get down to the real deal.
Ambiance -5/5. I found the lighting quite impressive and gave it a vibrant feeling to the entire place.
Food - 5/5.
Service- 5/5.
The Fatty Bao PB&J was simply awesome...
And the Desserts were heavenly...
Keep up the good work.

I always believe that an all-round dining experience stems from how the service is, how the ambiance is, definitely the food is key, but also how you are treated and taken care of during the course of the meal is a matter of great importance. And can I just say that the Fatty Bao ticked all these aspects and gave me one helluva meal. I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I will definitely go back for more, more, more and then some more as well! I know the pricing is a problem for most people - especially students on a budget. Although you can stick to a budget and eat here by ordering minimal (and trust me, even that is worth it, if you don't have a large appetite), you won't do justice to the place if you don't go in big. Getting straight to the food! 

1) Beef salad - I am a healthy eater which is why this protein-packed salad caught my eye right away. I have had many salads because I simply love them and can I just say this was one of the best.  Each bite kept me wanting to go back for more. There was such a perfect balance of spices and taste and so many more veggies than the normal lettuce and greens. The eye fillet was perfectly cooked - I loved every bit and would go back simply for this!
2) Spicy cottage cheese bao - These were really yum. I didn't even feel the need for any meat because the cottage cheese was flavoured with a perfect balance sweet and spicy. The dips are great too!
3) Char Sui Pork Bao - I LOVE pork (proteins in general) and this slow cooked pork belly stole my heart in more ways than one!
4) Chicken and basil fried rice - I was quite full at this point, so I didn't order an accompaniment with the fried rice - and it didn't need one. A plate is portioned for two so it was quite filling and the hit of basil was great. 
5) Cocoa caramel - I hate chocolate desserts most of the time simply because they are too sweet but oh boy cocoa caramel stole my heart. It was just the right amount of sweet, silky smooth mouse, amazing praline, amazingly thin shards of dark chocolate rice Krispies. The salted caramel ice cream on its own is way too salty but once eaten with everything else, is a treat! LOVED IT!
Also, the presentation of the dishes was great - especially the salad and dessert! MUST TRY GASTRO-PUB!!

Finally managed to grab dinner at this newest eatery (opened on 4th Dec) in town - yet another brand that any foodie like me must have been waiting for..

#Ambience: Beautifully done in keeping with thier genre of food served - predominantly Japanese.. It literally feels like a slice of Japan right in the heart of Kolkata.. Aesthetic decor and authentic to the core..

#Service: Top notch to say the least.. Everyone right from the person who opened the door, one who took orders, everyone who served us, bar manager and cafe manager who came up to us and enquired about the food and our comfort - the warmth, the cheerful spirit and thier hospitality really took the dining experience to an other level altogether especially keeping in mind that all these happened inspite of the fact that it was packed to capacity.. Kudos to the entire team..

And now the most important part of all - #FOOD: We started off with something that this chain is most well known for - the #Bao..

#CHARSIU - Imported pork belly from SriLanka, BBQ sauce, green apple Kimchi & Scallion.. Your visit to this chain is incomplete if you are not having this signature dish - the bread is super soft and that combination of pork belly & bbq sauce is simply out of the world.. 

#BEEFBULGOGI - this one is served with Karashi Mayo, cabbage slaw and onion jam.. Any beef lover's delight is how this Bao can be described best.. Try it to feel the feeling..

#THEFATTYBAOPBNJ - Twice cooked imported #porkbelly - slow braised and then crisped to order with miso  mustard jam.. The pork belly simply melts in your mouth without wasting a single second leaving your taste buds with a different high altogether - it is bound to give you a #porkgasm instantly.. This is pure ecstasy - move aside #VintageAsia at #JwMarriot - even your #caramelisedporkbelly falls flat infront of this heavenly dish and guess what - your pocket pinch is one third of Marriot in this case.. I can safely declare this place and particularly this dish as the best place in town to gorge on pork belly undoubtedly.. Taste this one and you will be left craving for more.. 

Time for the #desserts finally -

#FATTYHILL: Mint centred chocolate pyramid garnished with almond praline, rice crisps & Vanilla bean icecream.. To be honest, didn't like the so called signature dessert that much - the vanilla bean icecream tasted great and the rice crisps seemed to be an innovative addition lookwise but didn't add much to the overall taste.. The mint in the centre killed the feel of the chocolate for me..

#COCOACARAMEL - Milk chocolate cream, hazelnut praline crisp, flourless chocolate cake, toasted meringue, salted caramel gel & icecream.. Now, that's what i term as ending on a high.. This one was a 🏆 both on the look and taste front.. The 🍫 cream coupled with the 🍫 cake will give you an instant high irrespective of whether you are a chocoholic or not.. 

Pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side but trust me - it's worth every penny.. Something that i feel they can improve upon is probably the quantity of food served.. Rest everything is at it's very best.. Can't wait to go back again sometime soon.. 

Verdict: A #BIGTHUMBSUP from my end..

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..

The Fatty Bao finally opened it's doors to Kolkata this month. Having visited their Bangalore outlet, I had really high hopes and I was certainly not disappointed when I visited the Kolkata outlet on an invitation. 
The much famed PB&J was on point, and so were the dumplings. But my favourite was the Char Sui Ramen Bowl. 

The desserts were plated beautifully, and tasted equally good. 😘

Will surely visit again very soon!

Food, ambience, view and service are excellent! The Char Siu and the PBJ are signature items that are a must have on your table. Sushi's are also good especially the salmon one and the prawn tempura one. Do try their Ramen bowls too. Pretty delicious. We tried only one dessert and it was fabulous - the choco with salted caramel icecream. Never tasted an ice-cream that wasn't sweet.

One of the premium Asian food chain of restaurants that are popping up in cities around India finally makes landfall in Kolkata and is very aesthetically well done space. The decor with it's lanterns and patterned walls will transport you to a Chinese/Japanese street.
The menu is not too fast and so you don't get too confused with your choices

What we ordered:

Cool-Ade : though the barman took a while to serve my drink but it was worth the wait. Exactly what I was looking for. Loved the way it was served too,very fancy.

Asparagus & Cream Cheese Sushi : they were just okay. The wasabi and the ginger didn't have the kick,it was just lineball

Kimchi Fries : good stuff. Very fresh,great to order for the vegetarians

Grilled Chicken Bao: The chicken was tender and the Bao was tasty but it lacked the spice and some maybe some mayo

Prawn on Sesame toast : *STAR DISH* Enjoyed this one. So different from everything. Very light and the prawns on toast was a beautiful combination with the dipping soy

Tantanmen: *STAR DISH*  that supremely tasteful broth. Wow,some talent from the chef on this dish. 

Coco Caramel : stand out dessert. The salted caramel ice cream was just right. Loved the toasted meringue. Would have loved more of the meringue on the cake

Service was on point and the damage seemed reasonable on the wallet.

We somehow to mange to score some seats at fatty bao kolkata on the last minute , the new asian joint in fort knox. The ambience is very modern look with the chinese lamps and view of the city.

As for the food we ordered the asparagus tempura& cream cheese sushi which was crunchy goodness,
Kimchi fries was something different and nice to taste,
The grilled samble chicken bao was very good and a must try (if you like chicken otherwise try the charsui bao), prawn & sesame toast was very good and a-must try. And for the mains we ordered the veg fried rice which was good , veg in spicy chinese garlic sauce to go with the rice, veg garlic noodles also good and tantanmen ramen which is basically chicken baed ramen was very good and a must try.

Lastly for the dessert cocoa caramel a must try dessert.

Special shout out to miss shiny at fattybao kolkata who was helping us place the order and also suggesting some great stuff , thank you .

Located on the 8th Floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street, The Fatty Bao finally opens it's door for the people of Kolkata. I and a friend of mine were present on the opening day on 4th of December , and was welcomed on a warm note.  The restuarant boasts of Asian Cuisine .

WHAT I ORDERED : 

1. FRIED FISH BAO : The tempura Bhetki with siracha mayonnaise and pickled cucumber , blended inside a bao ,tasted quite good. Wont say it was the best , but good . 

2.PRAWN & GARLIC CHIVE : Basically prawn dimsums, well these tasted quite good , so you can actually order one of these dishes. 

3.EXOTIC MUSHROOM  RAMEN : Well, I was very dissapointed with the Ramen. Though it says mushroom ramen, the signs of mushroom in it was kinda negligible. I would request the management ,if you are saying mushroom ramen, then the quantity of Ramen in it should be given appropriately for the amount you charge. Not worth it . 

4.FIZZY PEACHED ICE TEA : Well , It was another okayish mocktail for me. Not that worth the price they charge . 

5. SAKURA SAKURA : Well ,hands down to the best mocktail I've had in the recent times. Grape juice concentrate was blended quite well. Do order. Must try . 

6.BEEF BULLGOGI : Karashi mayo, cabbage slaw and onion jam with beef mixed together inside the bao. It tasted quite well . Do order 

7.JAPANESE CHEESECAKE : This is a star dessert from this place. Served with vanilla bean icecream and sour cherries ,the cheesecake was pillowy soft and tasted amazing. Do try.Must order 

We were also given a extra gesture item because we went on its opening day. I would say to improve the quality of food Fatty bao serves,because it was not worth 2800INR . The ambience is top notch ,staff was courteous,and overall It was a mixed experience.

It was pretty much a tick off the wish list after long enough to come to fatty bao, which finally came to Calcutta. 
We went to lunch on a Sunday afternoon and forgot to make reservations. But we were asked to wait upstairs at The Monkey Bar for a table for two at The Fatty Bao. They called us within 15 minutes which was superb. 

We started with the kimchi fries (although they came later) - crisp but also stir fried fries in kimchi sauce and generous cheese on top- very garlicky. Perfect. 

Then we got the Fatty Pho Ramen - again, dominated by flavours of garlic, ginger and kaffir lime, the broth was refreshing for winter lunch, the noodle and egg was perfect, the chicken could have been a little more fragrant but on a whole, a great choice. 

We got two plates of sushi uramaki - the crabmeat and taboki (flying fish roe/one kind of caviar) which as usual popped in my mouth. The rice and nori was perfect, but I wish the wasabi would much much stronger. The salmon, cream cheese and cucumber uramaki had a different texture because of the raw fish and it was worth it. 

For dessert, we got just one Zen Forest. Our server asked us not to get two since it would be heavy (great service). The Zen Forest is something that explodes in your mouth. All the elements come together to leave a very unusual, fruity taste which were not used to, and that’s the best part. It was yuzu parfait, microgreens, a beetroot sorbet (all of this is so unexpectedly amazing)!

For drinks, we got the cranberry cooler and the Sakura Sakura. I thought both of them could a little more stronger. They smelt great but tasted a little understated. But I think it grew on me. Later we got watermelon juice which was fresh as hell. 

The view would be amazing but we got a corner table on the inside. Service is lovely. 

Definitely going to come back and so excited to have them in the city!

I was very excited to try this place.. the fatty bao recently opened its doors in kolkata and with some good promotional activities, its attracted a good amount of crowd. I went there for dinner on Sunday and had to wait for 30 mins for a table. 
It was worthwhile :) 
We got the high chair table beside the French windows overlooking the kolkata skyline. 
The fatty bao has a completely different vibe and ambience during the day time and night time. That's because during the day, it's poured with natural sunlight, being on the 8th floor of Fortknox building. The view is very pleasing. 
The night ambience is enhanced by the hanging lanterns. Very Asian. The decor is totally Asian/oriental with glimpses of Japan. The lighting was just perfect for dinner- not too loud, yet not too dim. 

I like the happy faces of the staff. It's always pleasing to be greeted with smiling faces. They were friendly and courteous and very warm. The service was sans complain. 

I was craving to try the wild mushroom dimsums but unfortunately it was not available :( 

What we ordered- 
Water chestnut dimsums- was served in a bamboo box.. I have had better dimsums than these but it was not bad. 
Fried Eggplant bao- the presentation was atttactive and the bao was super soft. This dish was delicious. 
Mylasian soupy ramen bowl- this was a mix of Thai red curry and khowswey. There was a nice Thai flavour and it was very filling. Totally satiated my taste buds. 

For dessert we ordered cocoa caramel. It tasted even better than it looked. The caramel icecream was yummy. Would totally recommend this dessert. 

Overall it was a great experience! Can't wait to visit again and try the wild mushroom dimsum and more... !! 

Thank you :)

This place is located where Venom used to be, Opposite Little Italy.  The moment you enter its the rustic Japanese decor which catches your eyes. It’s very different fro what’s we see.

We ordered Rainbow Sushi and cottage cheese & spring onions buns both of which were excellent. 
For mains we ordered a stir fried broccoli & exotic Mushroom Ramen. 
I have to specially mansion Mushroom Ramen. It’s a must must try for everyone. It’s one of the best dishes you will try and the Mushroom stock is to die for.

The only downside is their bar is not yet opened, so we ordered cranberry mocktail which was bad.

Overall excellent food , excellent service and averagely priced.

Recently opened at Camac Street, The Fatty Bao is the newest addition to Asian Restaurants in Kolkata. 
Starting off with Ambience, the place has a nice resemblance to what it's food is based on, Asia, with pictures and decorations relating to the same. It's vivid and beautiful, especially at night when the hanging lanterns light up to give a spectacular view. It's situated on the 8th floor so the outside view is quite nice as well. 
Overall, the environment is beautiful upon which adds the professionalism of the staff who attend, help and guide you through your necessities and doubts immediately. The responses are friendly and quite helpful in my opinion which is always a great thing.

Coming to the main part, we ordered 
1. Starters - Char Siu Bao
                       Thai Green Curry Paste Grilled Chicken
2. Maincourse - Asparagus and Bacon Fried Rice
                              Lotus Root in Thai Green Curry
3. Dessert - Cocoa Caramel
We also were provided a small complimentary dish for visiting them on their first opening day. 
The food were delicious and an absolutely delightful treat ! The Rice we ordered sufficed two of us though we had Starters before that. Everything was well cooked, in reasonable quantity if not immense and they tasted lovely, each of 'em ! I was really looking forward to this place after hearing such great words from people who've tried it outside Kolkata and I was certainly not disappointed at all !
Overall, this is definitely a recommendation for everyone who love Asian food or who hasn't tries it yet ! We had a lovely experience here and I'm sure you'll have it as well !

Food - 4.5/5
Ambience - 4.5/5
Service - 5/5

Char Siu Bao and Cocoa Caramel are must tries if you haven't tried them yet !

So basically my visit to fatty bao was due since my Bangalore visit. To start off, definitely go for their char sui bao, it is crazy and the pork belly just melts into your mouth.
Wild mushrooms and truffle oil dimsums are a blast of flavour and beholds the delicious pungent flavour of truffle.
Chinese chorizo literally tastes like  our bengali delicacy “mangshor chop”.
Loved the roast duck and khimchi fried rice. And i just overdosed on their fish and chilli oil.
Kudos to your great service and good food.
A must visit for someone who loves to eat and cherishes the oriental flavours ❤️

Ambience- The place looks really attractive with painted walls and lanterns hanging from the roof. Music can be worked on a bit. Would love some oriental music to go with the theme.Seats are comfy with some high seated ones located near the huge glass windows overlooking the Victoria memorial.

Hospitality- the staff are very well mannered and helping. 

Menu- menu is not a vast one with limited options and yes the price is a bit high.

Food- we had crab and salmon roll sushis. For beverages we had the Geisha tea. For dessert we had the Zen Forest.
Sushis- the sushis taste really great and seems custom made to match Indian taste buds. It has some added Thai spices contrary to the traditional Japanese sushis. Even the wasabi they serve with the sushi is not that strong.So if anyone is trying sushi for the first time, this is the place for you.
Tea- for me the tea tasted really bland, but then again I'm not a big fan of white teas or Chinese teas.
Dessert- The Zen Forest is a must try there. It just tastes foodgasmic. It was definitely the highlight of the day.

Overall a really good experience. Kudos to you guys for giving that subtle twist to your sushis. Will definitely recommend this place to all. Will be glad to come back to try more of their desserts.

Finally, the long wait is over and The Fatty Bao comes to Calcutta! We went there yesterday and the overall experience was pretty good! 

Firstly, the decor is lovely! There is a bit of Japan in everything! Lanterns, graffiti, the famous salt and pepper shakers of fatty bao ( adorable ladies with upturned bowl of ramen on heads ) floors and lighting. The table setting is also good, with brightly colored plates and chopsticks. Try not to compare it with The Monkey Bar, both are quite different in terms of cuisines. Also, the view is not as lovely as Monkey Bar's but the interiors are tastefully done. They are yet to recieve their bar licence, so hop in for some piping hot Japanese food.

We ordered The wild mushroom and truffle oil dimsum, and the vegetarian pan seared closed baos. The dumsums looked amazing! Glossy purple, soft, garnished with edamame and served in a bamboo basket along with a separate tray with 4 sauces. Tastewise, quite different from the regular dimsums. We learnt that it contains 5-6 types of mushrooms. Make sure to try the dimsums with the sauces/dips if you love spices.

Now, we tried something with truffle oil for the very first time so we would want to mention that not everyone would love its aroma and flavor. Truffle oil is quite pungent, musky and different.

The pan seared baos are really cute. We at home use our appam pans a lot so ordered this item. It was a little chewy, could have been softer. Also, the cottage cheese peices were a little stiff. Tasted good but needs improvement.

What deserves special mention is the absolutely amazing service by The Fatty Bao team! The Japanese are known for their sweetness and this place certainly deserves 10 out of 5 for being so warm. We were given a royal treatment by the staff. We write the names of our server in our reviews only if he/she is a gem. Our server, Mr. Manaranjan deserves a huge shoutout. The very charming manager came to our table to chat and to give a detailed explanation of the place and the food.
This place would always be remembered for the excellent service.

Our pocket pinch-

Wild mushrooms and truffle oil dimsums- INR 395
Pan seared baos with cottage cheese (veg)- INR 225
Taxes- INR 35
Service charge- INR 62

The first thing that stands out is the view. Get a window seat - high chairs - look at the Victoria memorial and enjoy some Asian fusion ! 
The food itself is built to please. Soft bao’s, clever toppings and some pretty decent proteins await you at the Fatty Bao. I did find the char siu bao to be a tad bit too saucy, would have liked to see the pork stand out a little, loved the green apple though. 
The stand out for me was desert. Zen forest was truly a surprise. Perfect citrusy yuzu parfait, soft matcha sponge and an earthy beetroot sorbet. A great desert that challenges your palette while still managing to feel wholesome. 
The ambiance is great, nice looking dining room. The music could always be a little less powerful.
Go for the bao’s, stay for the desert.

Asian cuisine has always been my comfort food, so when I found out The Fatty Bao will open its doors in Kolkata, I made sure I reserved a spot for myself & my family on the opening day itself.

We walked in just after 12:30 on December 4th and chose to sit on the high-seats. The view from the 8th floor of the Fort Knox is spectacular - one can easily spot the Victoria Memorial and St. Paul's Cathedral in the distance.

The ambience is lovely as well - decorated with hanging lights and a few appropriately graffitied walls, The Fatty Bao pulls of the 'Izakaya' concept pretty well.

We were served by Mr. Manoranjan, and I must mention I was thoroughly impressed with his suggestions regarding the menu - I suppose all the servers are well-versed with the dishes available and it showed - definitely a feather in the management's cap.

Coming to food, we chose a variety of dishes from different nooks of Asia.

Green Mango & Papaya Salad - Salads are the simplest of dishes, yet at times restaurants fail to satiate the taste buds. That wasn't the case today, as we were served a cool, refreshing bowl of green mango & papaya, with a dash of chilli & honey. Some might find it to be a bit on the spicier side, but we loved it.

Shengjian Bao with Bacon & Egg - Instead of open baos (which are pretty common in Kolkata), we decided to try these closed baos stuffed with chinese chorizo, bacon & egg, and served alongside three dips. Having originated in Shanghai, Shengjian baos are a variation of dumplings. The dough was soft and the filling moist - just like you want your baos to be.

Tantanamen - A spicy Japanese ramen with chicken & pork broth, the noodles came with a boiled egg, shredded chicken and crispy pork pieces. Rich in flavours, the ramen provided me a comfy, fuzzy feeling on the winter afternoon. Definitely the best dish of the day. Recommended.

Chicken Kapitan Curry with Steamed Rice - Malaysian delicacy with small, succulent pieces of chicken in a lemongrass-infused creamy curry with just the right amount of coconut aroma - enriching but not overwhelming. Our server suggested us to pair this with simple white steamed rice and it made for a delightful combination.

Sweet Lime Soda - My mom ordered some fresh lime soda, as their drinks cabinet is pretty dry right now (The Fatty Bao are yet to receive their alcohol license).

Zen Forest - The dessert and its presentation was the highlight of the day. It consisted of black sponge cake and parfait with a dollop of beetroot sorbet, chocolate twigs and white sesame crunch. Not only did the dessert look like it walked out of a Masterchef kitchen, it tasted equally good. While the sponge cake and the parfait formed the base of this dish, the sesame seeds provided the necessary crunch. The beetroot sorbet added the punch to the dish while the basil leaves provided some freshness. Delectable!

We had a great time and it was a perfect lunch. While the food was exquisite, the service was warm and impeccable. Also, the portions are good and one dish will easily suffice two.

Regarding the pricing of the dishes, the prices are in keeping with the upscale nature of the restaurant with the salads and baos starting around 250, while the small plates, noodles and curries start around 300-350. The ramens are priced from 400 onwards, while all desserts come at 320. Keeping in mind the portions and the taste of the food served, it is complete value for money.

Gastropubs are still not a common feature in Kolkata and The Fatty Bao is a welcome addition to Kolkata's food scene.

Fun Fact : I think we were the first customer at the restaurant, something I realized after taking a look at the bill when we got home.
