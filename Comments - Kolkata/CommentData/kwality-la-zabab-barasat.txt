Quantity is too small.
The quality is the worst.
They charged so much for each and every food item and yet their food quantity and quality is so bad.
We ordered a chilly chicken and the chicken's size is so small that hardly anyone can eat.
Even they charged 5rs. Extra for the mineral water which is offensive nowadays

Went there with my bro on a weekend evening after a movie at Jaya .
We prefered to have snacks so we order chicken tandoori . It was too dry and little burnt the taste was ok compared to price . The waiters here are useless , they are too lazy to work . Even the manager was useless as well  & the best part of this restaurant is that they have no toilet . üòÅ .

Been here for dinner once and the food was worst . Who the fuck puts cherry and cashew ll on chicken dishes.? Well this restaurant puts. And the quantity is very low, they bring tandoori roti from the adjoining roadside hut selling rotis(@2.5/-) and sell (@8/-) During puja they double amlost every items price.h

The restaurant is famous for the rolls, but I didnt find anything special in it, maybe for its location, its on proper location at Barasat. I have experience of having full course meals there, must say they prepare good foods but in festival times (Durga puja & Diwali) I got bad foods served by them.
However, today I have ordered a gravy chicken chowmin, & they served with good quality & the price is ok, but the delivery was around ¬†minutes late, which should not be happen. The food was good.

Earlier, this restuarant served quality food, but as days are passing by, its quality is really degrading! Sad but true to the core!  Recently the dining area has also been taken off. This restuarant has become an epitome of adverse effects. Still, some of the food items are trully praiseworthy.

Was once a good restaurant, but with time, the goodness faded away. Everything is now wrong with this restaurant. From food quality to waiters. The adjacent lazawab fast food centre is a better option for dishes like hakka noodles etc etc

My neighbourhood restaurant. Dined here several times. Food is decent and very pocket friendly prices. Tax is included in the menu prices. They make decent rolls as well. They can, however, improve their interiors. Also their biriyani was horrible.

Worst service ever! 1st of all they are servicing food after 40 minutes delay! Not having online payment in this digital era! Having pay tm but as owner is not in the place they make me wait for 20 mins to get confirmation from owner whether money has been reached or not! Ridiculous ! Never ever go there again

Don't know why this restaurant got such poor rating, my college was in barasat so we hit that junction uncountable number of times. They are famous for their roll. So try roll only specially chicken roll. Don't try Biriyani :p we suffered ;-)

Visited this place recently with my mother and grandmother after watching a movie at jaya multiplex barasat. The staffs are very arrogant. We had ordered mixed haka chow, hot and sour chicken, butter naan and chicken butter masala. The chow was not cooked well and the hot and sour chicken was nothing but a thick cornflour gravy in a God knows what sauce! We could not eat that. Naan was more or less okay. But again the butter masala was not at all good. Poor quality, bad taste, arrogant staffs. What else do you need to spoil your day after a good movie time with family??

Best thing about this restaurant is its roll counter. It has wide range of roll types.  Rest all foods are not that up to the mark. As per price it can be tasted.
One negative thing is staffs are reluctant to respond on customers order.

La: Zabab was our destination for every weekend once during school days. The delicious and varity kind off Rools was famous that time. But I feel very sorry for that now the quality is not up to mark. It's become very oily and tasteless. Price is okey but quality must improve. Staff are not professional at all. 

I give 3 out of 5 because of my old memories. Cheers

went there last Saturday and tried to eat Mix-Chow, it's awful seems it was make for other which has served because it was served very quickly and it was not hot while serving. Main problem was there was dust-sand type feeling and found hair in it.
Cant eat.

Me and my friends were looking for a cheap food outlet one day and someone mentioned this restaurant. To our surprise, we found a clean and neat interior. The egg-roll of this place is really famous among the local people; so we decided to try something new. We ordered Hakka noodles as well as sweet corn soup. The food was decent enough, but not really that 'great'. Still, we usually go there when low on cash. I'll recommend the dish Chicken Mughlai Paratha (if you are not that health conscious). But beware of their bland Biriyani. Other dishes are just 'ok' 'ok'. Nothing great.

No doubt , the best quick bite in Barasat area. It also has a restaurant attached, but that is not very promising. What I mam about to mention are rolls or you can say Kathi rolls.¬†
I never tasted better rolls in entire kolkata than this place.¬†
Enough said!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rolls are their main attraction. Evenings at the counter never fail to be crowded. Food quality is also good, especially the north Indian dishes. However chinese dishes, mainly rice and noodles could be fresh and better. Did once have the experience of being served stale rice and noodles evidently taken out of the freezer and served warm. Dining service is quite upto the mark. Overall, Quality La-Zabab still remains a place I can rely upon, atleast for takeaway food.

The rolls are the highlight of this place. During my school days, this place had always been my pick for having the rolls. The location of this place is just near Dak Bungalow and thus, is very easily accessible. The chicken rolls are really very tasty. One may also try out the tandoori chicken there.

La-zabab is renowned for its roll. They do serves variety (which is rare in barasat) of quality veg- non veg rolls. Went there several times, and enjoyed the super tasty rolls thoroughly.
Coming to their restaurant/ main course diner part... Their ambience is not so good. Feels cozy time to time. Hospitality, they tried hard but u will feel sorry for the waiters. Now, the food part, its almost compensating those glitches. I found their biriyani less spicey, not overly scented, consists no dalda (vanaspati), only oil. Two pieces of mutton/ chicken come in their regular priced biriyani. I also had Chicken handi and chicken kadhai, which I found tasty. Pieces were not that much tinder, but enjoyed it. And thumbs up for their frequent cherry garnishing. One thing La-zabab really need to improve is their starter part. Honestly, they don't know how to prepare a kebab. Ordered tanduri chicken too, regretted severely. They Totally burnt that piece.
Anyway, la-zabab is an almost decent diner and a fantastic place for rolls. Sometimes somebody can try La-zabab out for home delivery.

I've had noodles, Chinese chicken dishes, kebabs and many stuffs here. But the only thing that sticks to my taste buds from here are their rolls! And my favorite is the chicken and veg rolls. The service may seem slow owing to the huge rush of the customers, especially at the evenings. The inner sitting ambience is old and suffocating. So the delivery option is highly preferable. Anyway, their rolls are a must try!

There is a take-away counter just outside of it..and the chicken roll is just awesome. I strongly recommend the restaurant..must try!!

A very small restaurant near Dak Bungalow More (Barasat)¬† & very easy to miss. But they are among the most delicious food provider in this area. And this place is pocket friendly also. Of course the ambiance is not so good ( By that I don't mean unhygienic. This place is very clean, just that it doesn't have stylish interior decoration like many restaurants in Kolkata)¬† & you cannot expect very efficient service is such outskirts of Kolkata. But the food they serve is one of the best I have had in this city (considering the price they charge for it). Both Indian & Chinese cuisines are available & tastes good. (They do not have Chinese starters) They also have a Take-Away counter outside for Roll & other fast-food (which are also amazing). Though the restaurant has been recently added to Zomato, it is quite old (11 years or more). A must-try if you are near Barasat area. (BTW this region doesn't have many good restaurants)

Ambience: 2.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Value For Money: 5/5
