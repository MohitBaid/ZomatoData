Nice little restaurant, unique items, awesome taste, friendly atmosphere. We ordered chilly pork, devil's crab and meat loaf. Everything was spot on, specially the meat loaf. I want it to be open more often. A must try, but before going I will suggest everyone to contact them if it is open or not.

Being a true foodie I have always been open to all cuisines of the world.. needless to say that continental food is on top of my list..
I wanted to visit this place for quite sometime but couldn't make it as the restaurant is temporarily closed..however finally the restaurant was opened specially for 3days from 23dec to 25dec..
Hence I visited here fr two consecutive days i.e on 24dec and 25dec

Location: goin west is located at James long Sarani Bata colony,walking distance from Behala chowrasta and quite easy to find.

Ambience: a very soothing decor with soothing music,gives you a homely feeling..it has got an open kitchen and hence you know that they are serving you everything fresh and in a clean kitchen
The only bad thing is that this place is kinda small and can accomodate around 20 people at a go.

Foods ordered:
Devil's crab -crab meat searved in egg white ..this dish is just amazing and beats any crab meat starters across the city..the flavours are very prominent and simply lipsmacking

Chilli pork- one of their signature dish as per reviews ..this is one of the better chilli pork I have tasted if not the best. A generous portion of pig meat,sausage and fat tossed in sauce..really amazing in taste

Pork meat loaf- this is just the best ..meatloaf is something u usually don't get everywhere and this restaurant just nailed it..it melts in your mouth and the flavours are just world class

Mermaid- this is basically baked fish served with rice and like all the other items tastes amazing

Pulled pork wrap- its a must try ..and I loved it the most probably after the devil's crab..

Double pork cheese burger with grilled apples- the burger is just amazing and grilled apples and pork creates a divine harmony in your mouth..if you are burger fan ,this is the thing to order

The place is heaven for pork lovers like me ...and one must simply make a sure visit once it's opened..lovely food and a very soothing ambience ..perfcet for pocket friendly dates..

Quantity-one of the very few places who gives you good quantity that too without compromising with the quality.

Pocket pinch- really pocket friendly .
For example - 2 devil's crab-6pieces each,two chilli pork and two meatloaf costed only 1300bucks..does it get any better. And trust me it was more than enough for 3 people

Really looking forward to visit it once it's reopened

We had an awesome Christmas eve dinner at Goin West. It's a small quaint continental and American joint located on James Long Sarani, Behala. Although located on the road, the entrance is easy to miss.
Pros:
1)Ambience: An old world and slightly quaint charm created with photos from old English movies, Oktoberfest, Chaplin or Beatles adorning the wall. A warm vibe surrounds the place. Open kitchen that lets you know that your food is fresh and cooked in a clean place.
2)Food: We tried devilled crab, pulled pork wraps, chilly pork, a baked fish dish and meat loaf. The food was awesome. Except for chilly pork (which was not as hot as I would like my chilly dish to be) I loved every other dish to the bits. The meat loaf was a hearty portion, good ratio of pork meat and fat and nicely cooked with barbecue sauce. The devilled crab was a heavenly experience and you could never stop at having one. The pulled pork wrap was nicely seasoned, melt in the mouth pork wrapped in a melt in the mouth thin flat bread. The fish was elevated to another level altogether by adding those smoked ham bits and sliced eggs. Very clever cooking in my opinion. Portions are good. 
3) Price: Incredible pricing. You are getting bit hearty meals essentially at the price of a good quality fast food. For me, chuck KFC or MacDonald. Dig into Goin West food. Pocket friendly, hearty and more nutritious at the same time.
Cons: Sitting capacity is just about 20 people.

I had wanted to visit this place for a long time, since it's rare that a continental café garnering good reviews opens up in a place like Behala. 
Its located on James Long Sarani, near Janakalyan. The entrance to it is very dingy and shady, but once you step in, the ambience is quite cozy. The walls have posters of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and Hollywood movies. The place however has a very limited seating capacity. 
Coming to the food, we had gone on Ashtami evening and apparently for the Puja week, they had removed their usual menu and had another special one. This was a downer as I really wanted to try some of their signature dishes. We ended up ordering CHICKEN A LA CREME and SPAGHETTI ALFREDO. 
The former was a bowl of flavoured buttery rice accompanied by a really delicious creamy, cheesy sauce. The chicken pieces in the sauce, however were hard and undercooked.  The white sauce in the spaghetti was under-seasoned and the problem with chicken pieces persisted. 
The quantities are really value for money, but the food didn't match up to the expectations I had built up from reading reviews. 
P. S. - The prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes.

This is small restaurant located on James long sarani, near janakalyan, and it's bit difficult to locate, Google map doesn't help. It's opposite a park, near coffee den. The path to the restaurant is bit clumsy. But the restaurant seems okayish, by looks and ambience. The food was served in no time. 
We ordered chicken strips and potato wedges and chello kebab
Both of the items were delicious and the chicken used was fresh and succulent. The quantity and quality won my heart, and two items were enough for two people. All the rating is for the food. The staff behavior was good. 
If you haven't visited this place, then I would recommend you to visit this place for at least once, you won't regret that much f you're a foodie.
But if you're looking for great ambience then this place may disappoint you a bit.

Lovely little place on James Long Sarani, very close to Behala Chowrasta. I fell in love with the ambience of the place and they have a very good taste in music. The food was above average. They took a lot of time to prepare it so that’s a con. Overall, this place gives a very nice, pleasant feel.

This joint had been in my wish list for a long time and finally got a chance to dig in here on Navami. The outlet itself is quite tricky to find. If you enter James Long Sarani through the Janakalyan connector and walk towards chowrasta for 3-4 minutes, it'll fall on your left.

The entrance is dingy, so is the seating area. There's something called small and cozy, but that's not the case here. The ambience looks shady and seats are very few in number (read two tables of 4 and two diner stools of 4). But I already knew that and went there solely for the food that this joint is so well-known for.

Coming to the staff, there's only two. But given the size of the outlet, it's okay. The staff is courteous and polite, and know well about what they're serving. Though they take a long time to bring in the food, I'm not complaining because they prepare it fresh, which is definitely a plus.

The first thing that struck me is that even if you reserve your seat beforehand, you may not get a table. We were three people and we didn't though another group of three which came afterwards, did. It's weird, but provided the seat crunch, it can be overlooked.

Now coming to the food- since it was during the pujas, they had removed their earlier menu and a new menu was up which didn't contain most of their vouched-for dishes. So we ordered the Pot Roasted Pork with grilled potatoes, Chicken a la creme and Spaghetti Alfredo.
POT ROASTED PORK: It was served with a side of garlic bread. The traditional Italian bread was not used to make the garlic bread, they gave us one slice of the plain white bread cut into halves. Though it was delicious but not what's expected. The pork was over-cooked and had hardened. But the sauce and the potatoes were on point.
CHICKEN A LA CREME: This came with a side of garlic bread (the same as above) and a bowl of flavoured buttery rice, which was delicious but the portion was too small for one person. The chicken pieces were large and chunky, hardened due to over-cooking. On top of that, the sauce lacked seasoning. I've tasted this dish in a lot of other restaurants, so it's better to give it a miss here.
SPAGHETTI ALFREDO (CHICKEN): The white sauce here was under-seasoned as well, guess they used the same sauce? The amount was adequate for one person. But the long Spaghetti strands were broken, which is a big no-no for me; though it was cooked perfectly.

The final bill of around ₹750 included no extra taxes; and it shouldn't, because it was a handmade one. Maybe it was because of the Puja rush, or because it was late that night, but the joint failed to cut the mustard for me. Although that's no excuse for any restaurant, but I'm willing to give it a second try as I missed the dishes I wanted to have.
Overall, it's an affordable place serving European cuisine and can be given a try if ambience is put aside.

Was on my wishlist for quite sometime! And, finally yesterday I made it to the one and only continental restaurant in Behala area. This place is small anf the decoration is off bit. Inspired by New York cafe style. The owner, Shyantan, was very sweet to suggest some great dishes off the menu. So we ordered Honey Pork with meatballs, veggies, mash potatoes and poach, sweet and salt lime soda, The mermaid- fish baked with chicken, prawn and egg! It's served with toast and herb rice. The food was Awesome, absolutely lip smacking!!

Coming to the food

We ordered Bbq peper fish dumplings which we simply loved, a spaghetti Mariana, a perfect dish for people who love spicy and tangy items. And the Mojito. We loved it all. I will go there again and also recommend you people to go there. Argha Chakraborty

Discovering little places that are made with love & care reestablishes my love for Calcutta. Goin West, Behala’s only continental joint is a very fine example of such places that become dear to me at a first glance.

We reached Goin West almost 2.30 hours after our scheduled table time (blame that on the people who decided to make Chothurthi the new soptomi). We did end up reaching Goin West (took an auto from Tollygunge metro to James long and walked the next 600 meters till we found the place opposite of a children’s park) at about 10.20PM.

The place is on the first floor, done up in red and yellow and decorated with square framed photographs and graphics trying to bring up the western pop culture from years gone by. We had already pre ordered some of our orders in advance and wasted no time in demanding them to be served on the table asap.

Now here is why I liked Goin West so much. Even though we reached well past our reserved time and were 3 people more than what we had mentioned, Sayantan, the owner & head chef, took us in with a smile and accommodated us perfectly. In the hospitality industry, this is what elevates a good place to a great place. This place, a very personal affair being nurtured by Sayantan, is able to do that seamlessly.

We had pre ordered Assorted Basket of Fries (We found Chicken, Prawns, Onion Rings, French Fries and Potato Wedges in it, lovingly batter fried), Devilled Crab Meat with Cheese & Eggs, Poached Fish Quenelles, The Mermaid (Fish, ham, eggs & prawns, all baked in cheese), Braised Mutton & Bacon wrapped Chicken Roulade. But we were famished and even after devouring all of the above, we craved more and ordered a plate of Spaghetti with Meatballs and two plates of Honey Glazed Roast Pork (I think!).
The Assorted Fries and the Devilled Crabmeat Eggs were stellar. One bite and all of us wanted way way more of them. Gorged through them. The Fish Quenelle was something I did not like as much as I did the other dishes, but this might be due to the reason that this a dish that needs time to be cooked and needs to be served right after it is poached. Our late entry might have dampened this one’s true potential. The Mermaid again was something very warm and hearty. A lot of feel good with this one. Then came the Braised Mutton and the Bacon Wrapped Chicken Roulades. Both were beautifully plated and tasted heavenly. We literally jumped at the mutton. Forgot we were pretending to be civilized people and ate like the truly hungry souls we are. Another thing to mention, all the dishes, were more than ample quantity wise & I am not even considering the sides.

We were divided about the Honey Glazed Pork, some of us liked it and some of us thought it was spicy in a very aromatic kinda way that hampered the taste of the pork to come out evenly. I didn’t personally try the Spaghetti because by then we were full. My friend, who did taste it, mentioned that the Spaghetti was good but the meatballs do have a scope of improvement.

All of these 9 dishes cost a total of 2640 rs (only! & no GST). It was practically a steal considering the amount of food we ate & the meat we got. I managed to click only one photograph this night. The rest of the time, we were blissfully busy eating.

Amazing continental food. We tried the bacon wrapped prawns and Honey Roasted pork (chef's special). Loved both the dishes! Both were intelligent recipes with sincere ingredients, and a homely touch. Most importantly we were full after finishing them, but we never felt bloated, which is a foremost sign of honest ingredients being used. Thank you Sayantan for being a wonderful host and a chef!!!

It's a challenge to find the hidden entrance to this little yet cosy diner. Good vibes all over the place. You can get a nice view of the busy streets.

The fries are not too bad but a definite improvement in dipping is necessary. You can give  the barbecued chicken wings a miss as they are too sweet and the gravy is not very palatable. 

The chicken ala king burger looked promising but the patty does not hold and lacks any punch at all. The sauces are not that good. The only saving grace was the coleslaw which was great!! The buns are soggy and not a well rounded dish.

But having said that I would give the other dishes a try and good job on the ambience.

A small place.. but full of charm..
If you are planning to have quality continental food at a pocket friendly budget, this is absolutely the perfect place for you.
The entire place is well decorated, the decors included the theme of TV show F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
Once you are in, you will get a feel like.. nothing matters other than good food and good friends.. 😊

We were 4, and in the appetizers we ordered for the Basket of Fries that contains crispy and tasty fries of chicken, prawn, fish with a super coating along with french fries, potato wedges and onion rings. A single one was sufficient to be shared by 4. Toasted garlic bread was served in addition.

In the main course, we ordered for 2 Chicken Stroganoffs and 2 Mutton Lasagna.
Stroganoffs were served with herb rice and taste was good.
Mutton Lasagna was excellent. It contained spicy mutton keema and cheese sheets in layers with a number of add ons in the dish that enhanced the taste. If you are not badly hungry, it can even be shared by 2.
Staffs are less in number but service is too good. Even if you suggest to incorporate any changes in there recipes, they will go ahead with that.
The most important point is, it is unquestionably cost effective. All that we ordered summed up to about 1300 only, and we were extremely full.
Though no negatives can be plotted on this place, still a suggestion, as the place can accommodate very less no of people, it's better to make a prior booking to have your seat confirmed.

But if want quality food at affordable price you must visit this place. Never hesitate to ask the attendants over there regarding the food before ordering. It will be better if you ask them to recommend as per your preference. 
Am sure that you will re-visit the place once you go there.

Goin west is just the same as the name suggests! What a menu it offers! We ordered chicken wings in BBQ sauce, Penne Alfredo and grilled chicken steak. The chicken wings in BBQ sauce tasted sweet and tangy. The dip served along with it was great. It controlled the flavours well. Penne Alfredo was delicious. The quantity was really good and it was really cheesy. The grilled chicken steak was also great and what a blend of flavours! 
The ambience was really good. The service was awesome! The waiters suggested well. The price is really nominal keeping in mind the quality and quantity of food. A good place to hang out with friends for sure!

Goin West is a nice place for a "weekday date" 😊
Small but cute... 
Its kinda homely atmosphere.
 The posters on the wall, the small bike models etc look overall amazing.
Now coming to the food.. it is a nice place to try new things. In short a continental foodie's paradise.
As I'm only fish and chick person.. i had limited options..
We started with the Basket of fries. It was nothing amazing, but still quite enjoyable (note - it is not healthy at all as all items are deep fried in oil)
It had lot of chicken,french fries,onion rings.. but just 3 or 4 shrimps. 😢
The next item which we had was grilled chicken steak.
It was really nicely prepared. Tasty yet healthy.
Didn't expect the herb rice to be so yummy.
You can surely try this item.. it won't let u down.. 😊
Finally the best part.. 
The horrible mocktail.. indeed a mockery..!!
It smelt like Sensodyne. 😢
Overall it was a nice experience.
The people are very caring and courteous..!!

The place is located just near Jonokolyan more, the decore is okayish! The most favorite part for me was the F.R.I.E.N.D.S frame. The service is good and food was better.We ordered Chicken Ala king Burger and Chello kebab as we went there for dinner. CHICKEN ALA KING BURGER is a must have if you go there,I must say.The dip served with it is a perfect como of spice and cream that makes the burger more tasty! The plating was also very innovative. The chelo kebab did'nt have the mutton patty(as they have mentioned)and was replaced by chicken sausages.The Chicken was cooked in mustard sause that was a eye catcher but I was a bit disappointed with the rice served with it, other wise it's good and quantity wise is perfect.The pocket pinch and quantity will surely make you happy!!
Quantity-5/5

I visited this place very recently after seeing all the good reviews in Zomato. The food was good.
We ordered BBQ chicken wings,chicken parmigiano,chicken steak and crepe Suzette.The chicken wings were delicious and the dip with it was awesome.Chicken parmigiano was average,the pasta they serve with it was not tasty.Chicken steak was good,the chicken was soft and the mashed potato with the sauce tasted right.But the sunny side up was not Sunny but I don't blame them as the house was full that day and there were only two people preparing the food.Crepe Suzette was nice.The vanilla ice cream was balancing the sourness of the orange sauce.The place is really small and it can accommodate max 16 person at a time.The chairs were also very small,it would be difficult for a healthy person to sit on it. I would definitely go back for the yummy chicken wings and the dip.

One of the very few places around the region serving continental food, and a good one. You might not want to go in a group of more than 4 though as the place is not so big with 2 tables and 3 wall tables. But all this is compensated by the vibrant atmosphere and good ambience of the place. 
We went in a grouo of 4 and ordered Chicken strip and potato wedges and basket of fries for appetizers (recommendation: Don't order both) along with fish salad. For main course we had Chicken stroganoff, Grilled Chicken Steak and Apple Glazed Pork Chops ( They didn't had Pork Schnitzels at the time).
You may have to wait some time for the food, but its worth the wait. You are not charged extra for tax. The staffs are always at their best, Good service. 👌

Went for dinner tonight with a group of friends. The space is small,I mean if u go in a group of more than 4,you might face problem. But we managed. We ordered a basket of fries as starters. It was really good and came with a dip on the side. For main course we ordered chicken salad,spaghetti with meat balls,chicken stroganoff,and 3 plates of grilled chicken steak. The foods were really good and was sufficient for all of us. Though the service was a bit slow,the taste of the food overpowered it.. So we didn't bother .😊

Visited this place quite some months back, didn't notice the timing before visiting, so do notice it opens at 5pm. The sitting area is small and is very casual.. But the ambience is so relaxed that you will instantly get the vibe.. Ordered basket of fries (served with a mayo dip which tasted yum hence no wonder that they charge 10inr extra for another round of the dip) which is a mixed bag of chicken, prawn, onion ring n potato fries  although fish was also mentioned we didn't get any in the basket.. The much appreciated grilled fish in lemon butter sauce lived upto the expectation, n the fresh lime soda was having just the perfect amount of ingredients it needed.. So I can conclude taste wise n quality wise Goin West proved itself to b above average.. Now the cons I felt, service needs to b quicker n more professional.. Timing can b a constraint if you target customers beyond behala.. Opening it a bit earlier will help a lot like us..

Today we finally visit this place.  One of the first continental and American retro in this area . Ambience was small and well maintained. Vibrant colored wall with nice classic decorations and good music. 
We ordered classic grilled chicken steak and penne alferdo. Both items are really good in taste. Quantity was huge ; enough for two people. Staffs are very friendly and great service. I really like it. 
Over all good experience. Definitely value for money.  They do not charged of extra tax. Highly recommended 👍👍👍👍

A hard to find restaurant on James Long Sarani, near Janakalyan...

FOOD: Well, the food is awesome. If u want to try Continental dishes, this is the place u should definitely come to. With an array of continental dishes including pizzas, pastas, lasagna, schnitzels etc, this place also boasts of tasty chelo kebab and soups. The portion sizes are enough to fill 2 normal people with a single plate. Visited this place twice and had their Chello Kebab, Chicken Pizza, Chicken Permigiano and Chicken Stroganoff. Each and every item was delicious in their own ways. Satisfied the palate and made us hungry for more. 

AMBIANCE: The place is short of space but cozy. Only a couple of 4seater table available. But is very clean and well maintained. The walls are decorated with posters of Beatles, F.R.I.E.N.D.S and old CDs and movies. Books are kept to keep u company while u wait. Lighting is good and the sound of the outside street doesn't reach ur ears during the food fest. Bathroom is not exactly available.

SERVICE: Everyone is very friendly over here and attentive to ur choices and preferences. However, since the food is cooked after an order is placed, hence takes some time to serve the food. (This ensures the freshness of the food though, so can't complain). Card is readily accepted. And the best part is, the food prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes. Hence the pocket pinch is minimal. Dinner for 4 people can be easily wrapped up within 1000 bucks.

OVERALL: Will definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants to taste mouth watering continental dishes in Behala. I will be returning to this place again and again to try their appetizers more. And I hope they expand soon and renovate the washroom. They really deserve a larger place to compliment the quality food they are offering.

In short, one of the hidden gems in kolkata n definitely the best of its kind in behala! Looking for some italian, continental and american flavours, dont wanna travel far, and would be interested in tasting the same without hitting much on your pocket? Here's Goin West for you... Delighted by its decor, prompt service and the food quality n quantity. We tried chicken wings and mushroom chicken risotto. The basket was full of barbeque wings and taste was simply irresistible. Earlier we placed an order for pizza but unfortunately we were late. So had to alter n place an order for risotto. But it tasted yum! Looking forward to my next visit soon! And hoping to visit a bit early this time so that we dont miss on anything... Highly recommended visit guys...!

This is a great place to dine if you are in a decent budget. They have continentals which serves one's hungry tummy with complete delight.I ordered a thin crusted pizza which tasted yummy and different. Don't really remember the name of the soup that I ordered but it carried a creamy taste which was really nice for my taste buds.The restaurant is on the first floor, so you'll have to take a few tiny steps up the basement. Overall, a good restaurant with cool decor.The space is small though.

This restaurant is very close to my heart and also close to my home as well :) Very small joint but serves really nice Continental & American food. 
This was my 2nd visit and i tried very simple dishes. 
1)Fiery Cheese Toast - Very simple, it had lot of chillies on nicely melted cheese on toast 
 2)Mushroom & Pork Risotto - Very creamy and very meaty 
3)Apple glazed Pork Chop (Platter) accompanied by Sunny Side Up - Won't comment, just try it if you are a pork lover :)
Overall view - Its a place which won't give you a fine dining amibiance but the food will.

A nice little place off the roads of james long..if you want a place tranquil in essence,for two or three, along with good food, neat and crisp mocktails with affordable prices and last but not the least, good ol' rock n roll to tickle your nostalgia...this is your place...
I visited here a couple of times with my wife...n would love to visit it more often..the food is not heavy on the stomach but is essentially lip smacking good..we have already tried chelo kebab, fish Neapolitan, chicken salads, fish in lemon sauce and butter each having a distinct taste and originality..mocktails specially the orange is thoroughly refreshing..ambience is not at all gaudy, but care has been taken in the position of the lights, the photoframes, colour combination of the walls to echo the mood..The guys are also very friendly n jolly...altogether a nice warm place to sit, relax and enjoy your evenings..

(P.S. care needs to be taken on the entrance ..as it is very easy to overlook, will be a shame indeed if the culinary and overall efforts get wasted because of it!!)

Goin West is a newly opened hidden jewel in Behala serving lip smacking continental dishes.

Fish Nepolitan:  Fillets of Basa, pan seared, topped with napolitana sauce loaded with cheese was served with herb rice and French fries. Fish was well cooked, mixture of napolitana sauce and cheese makes it a lipsmacking dish, and combined with the herb rice it tastes heavenly.

Chicken BBQ Wings: 
Fried wings tossed with BBQ sauce and honey served Kong with mayo dip. It has a hint of sweetness from the honey and complimented the BBQ sauce really well inserted of overpowering it.

Baked Fish in White sauce:
This was not mentioned in menu card but was suggested by the owner. Baked basa in white sauce  served with garlic bread toast and herb rice. This dish didn't hit the high notes as the others and was little below expectation. All over thougg this dish is nice.

Chicken Parmigiano:
This one was served with fried crumb chicken breast topped with minced sauce and cheese served along with white sauce pasta. The chicken breast was delicious and tasted incredible with cheese. The pasta though was not good.

Chicken Strips and Potato Wedges:
Chicken strips and potato wedges, served with mayo dips. Chicken was well cooked and coated with a little spice which gave it an unique taste.

Going west is a small eatery on James Long Sarini near Chowrasta. It is on 1st floor but the way to it really made me feel that I am in some dungeon. 

Pretty small place but well decorated. I would strongly suggest to have bigger chair for people who are blessed with decent derriere(No puns intended). 30-40 mins of struggle to make yourself comfortable will literally give you pain in a**. 

Please consider this and have better chairs. 

Regarding Food, We had Mushroom Croquettes. It was decent but hardly had Mushroom. I would love to see more of mushroom rather than other fillings. It was a bit oily too. 

Herb Fried Fish was quite good. I really liked it, but this too was a bit oily. 

Better way would be to soak the oil and then present the dish. 

Overall, It was a decent experience with funny side of struggle  to find chair. 

I give it 3/5.

Went on evening of 22.01.2017 with my wife. Ordered bacon wrapped prawn as starter. 6 pieces. I will not say superb but will say excellent. In main course ordered chicken steak and apple glazed pork chops. They gave 2 slice of bread as compliment. The rice with chicken steak was of no taste. So I will say the chicken steak was not up to the mark. But the pork dish was absolutely heavenly. Both of us just kept the chicken plate aside and competed with each other to finish the pork. I must say this is one of the finest dish I ever ate. In dessert, we took two in-house cocktail having orange and watermelon flavour. Their taste are in accordance to their price. Finally, the ambience (dim light with light music) and location of the restaurant will add up with the quality of food in making this one of the best restaurant of Behala.

A very small but brightly decorated place situated on James Long. Tried their chicken roast. At first the chicken they served was undercooked. On informing them they changed it immediately and apologized a thousand times for that. Coming to the food, it was very delicious. The chicken was oozing with butter. It was served with veggies and herbed rice. Quantity could have been a little more. Overall it was a pleasant experience.

I would love to escape to this juicy paradise once again.

It’s definitely an add-on when a Chef believes and practices personalized hospitality, and not just create magic with fire and wok. That’s what happened with me. Until today, I never experienced a Chef take down my order. I am talking about a personable owner who would fondly handle orders and special requests, swiftly and chivalrously, customizing and balancing health benefits to what you order. 

The protein rich Pork Platter was tailored to my pallet needs, also considering that all I want is pure substance. I opened my eyes to a gastronomical wonder; unexpectedly tender, juicy yet meaty, balanced with exceptional lip-smacking wedges of carbs and fresh veggies tossed n sprinkled with rosemary from the kitchen garden.

Though, I would love to be selfish and keep GoinWest all to myself, this art of Chef Sayantan and his crew is too good to stay hidden for long. There’s no doubt GoinWest surely is heading quickly to become the hottest reservation in town. 
I would love to escape to this juicy paradise once again.

P.S - if you are fond of smaller portions; this isn’t the place for you.

Goin West is a jewel in Behala serving some lip-smacking continental dishes.

After seeing regular great reviews I and my friends decided to try out this place. On a fine chilly evening we went there. The place is small but cozy. The walls have been painted by bright red and yellow colors. Decorations are also nicely done.
Coming into the food, we ordered basket of fries for starters which contains fries of chicken,shrimps, fish,onion rings and French fries...it was heavenly and we all enjoyed every bit of it.
Now for main course we ordered Grilled chicken steak, mutton lasagna, chelo kebab and double  cheese mutton patty...chicken steak came with a big chunk of chicken breasts,herb rice, fried egg and some veggies. The chicken was superb, herb rice was also great but the veggies could have been better especially the beans could have been tender. The lasagna was served with garlic bread, the topmost part was cheesy and creamy while the bottom was spicy and tangy. The double cheese mutton patty looked oh-so good with cheese almost dripping down. It was also delicious however it has room for further improvement. Last but not the least was the chelo kebab. Everything of it tasted good except the mutton patty which could have been better. 
Overall it was a quite good experience for usand is surely a must visit restaurant in Behala. Kudos to the owner for taking this bold step...

So I planned to visit Goin West. As the name suggests it's mostly contain continental dishes. Cozy place with limited sitting. Nice classic decor. We ordered wings with BBQ sauce, Chicken Steak and Sloppy Burger. We had In house kicktail and Sweet lime soda..
For me ..getting such food was a dream when we were kids. I m glad that this type of restro are opening. I like everything.. Definitely value for money...All the best guys.. 
Everytime I will visit my home I will surely come over n treat my taste buds.

The entryway of this restaurent is very narrow and dismal...but don't let that form a bad impression! Inside the ambience is quite good with dimmed lights and nice background music. A much required Continental place in Behala, the best thing is that they don't even charge for their services. We had Spaghetti in Meatballs and Shepherd's Pie, with Crepe Suzette for dessert. Quality and proportions were adequate. Overall a nice little joint in Behala Chowrasta, would be happy to visit again.

I was looking for options on a Saturday evening as me and my wife explore new restaurants every weekend. So we checked out this new restaurant on Zomato and we stopped by. My wife was pretty hesitant on getting inside after seeing the shabby entrance, but guess again, we were blown away by their authentic continental cuisine! The place is extremely cozy and could hardly accommodate 8 people. It's not for everyone as u won't find spicy red indie dishes out here. People who doesn't like continental or Italian cuisine would find it bland. But for the rest, take my word, this little joint will not disappoint u!

First of all, this was a much needed place in Behala region. This was one of the most awaited place that I have tried during my winter holidays. They have a narrow entry which takes you to first floor where the restaurant is actually located. They have very small place but the decoration of the place is amazing. We ordered Basket of Fries for starters and for the main course Double Cheese Mutton Kickass Burger, Mutton Lasagna, Chelo Kebab and Grilled Chicken. The waiting time was normal only like other restaurants. First hands down to the starter, the Basket of Fries was amazing every one enjoyed it the most, especially the prawn fries. The burger had double patty of mutton and it was very good, The chiken kebabs of the Chelo were very good but the mutton wasn't that great. The grilled chicken was amazing. The lasagna was good. The best part is that being a continental restaurant it wasn't costly at all. I would like to see more continental joints coming up at Behala.

This place has an excellent decoration.. Great ambience, low lights.
They serve slightly modified western food, but compared to the price food quality is mediocre.
The menu has a lot of variety. Would like to visit again to try something new.

People those who live in behala and tired of eating the same North Indian and Chinese stuffs must try this place. Goin West is one of the best Continental restaurant in Behala. Its a small restaurant with a seating capacity around 15. The place is small but the ambiance is wonderful and charming. But the chairs are not so comfortable.

Now coming to the food, at first we ordered Basket of fries, Mutton Lasagna, Grilled Chicken, Double cheese Mutton Burger and a Chelow Kebab. Starting with the basket of fries. All the items above was planned but this one was a random choice and it turned to be the best for us. The Basket of fries contains crispy chicken, prawns, French fries, onion fries. This starter is a value for money and I recommend everyone to try this.

I went with my friends so I ordered the Chelow kebab. The presentation of the chelow kebab was awesome. The chicken kebabs were delicious. The herb rice was nice. Everything in that chelow was nice except the mutton patty which was an average one. I took a bite from every item and all of them were good. 

We ordered 5 different items, we thought that they would take time but they served all the items within 25-30 mins. Compared to other big restaurant they took less time which is a positive point for me. The staffs were very polite and cordial. 

The last thing that I want to mention that they do not charge any kind of tax. So overall it was a fabulous experience for me. So a 4 from me.

Had a good experience at Goin West. The cheeseburger was fantastic, so were the appetizers. Downside was the lemonade which was too sweet.

The ambience inside is good, with the effort invested quite apparent. You may find the entrance shady, but the food makes up for it.

The only American and continental food joint in and around Behala, located on the first floor of a flat on James Long. Difficult to locate with out the signage of the restraunt.
Read a lot of exelatering reviews about this restraunt, thus decided to drop by as one live not very far from here.
Order for Cheesy Croquettes with Mushroom and in main course ordered for Shepherd's Pie and Garlic Bread to go with it.Surprisingly , I was served the Shepherd's Pie before the ordered croquettes.It is not a fine dining restraunt, rather the decor and ambience is more of a pub,thus laid back but still to manupulate the course of menu is not done. Shepherd Pie had a strong taste of Tomato sauce (not ketchup) with finely made mashed potatoes, though the meaty taste was missing.Because of the sauce it was very palatable and accompanied with Garlic Bread in winter was good.Garlic bread was crisp and the Garlic butter spread on it was well made as the flavour was present though not over powering other tastes.
Now Cheesy Croquettes with mushroom served with Mayonise was soft and creamy, though the proportion of Mushroom was miniscule. The Accompaning Mayonise was very well made and just perfect.Portion size of my ordered dishes were good enough for two.I must say that the presentation of food is very nice and the lighting of the restraunt complements that.Menu prices are inclusive of tax.
It was not an experience that had dazzled and delighted the taste buds , it was not at all a disappointing experience.

Amazing place to be. Ambience is good. They play some really nice classic rock. But what makes its more appealing is the food that it serves. Italian/ American cuisines at very reasonable price. Food tastes amazing and the service is quite good. It's a good hangout joint that will also successful stimulate your tastebuds. The only hindside is the seating capacity and the washroom. But that's all secondary as compared to the food they serve ...

The first thing that you notice when you enter the restaurant is the decor. It is a period piece and takes you back a few decades, with the quaint little black and white photographs against brightly colored walls. The staff is friendly. It is quite obvious that Sayantan, the proprietor cum head chef is not sparing any efforts in making the dining experience pleasurable. 

We started with the basket of fries. It was an assortment of french fries, onion rings and finger fries of chicken and prawns, dipped in a light batter. It was crisp and not oily. We had chicken stroganoff, pork schnitzels and fish napolitan for main course. It was authentic continental fare, with mellow flavors. What made my day was the crepe, which was nice and smooth and had the right degree of tangy orange flavor.

I would highly recommend this restaurant.

A really really small place. I have had their wings before and today i had the shepherd's pie. Honestly speaking, I was hoping for something more creamy and less spicy but I guess that's my bad because I have never had this pie before and may be that's how it is.

Located near janakalyan, near shakher bajar. Don't be fooled by the dingy entrance or the tiny resturant in itself. Your mind and taste buds will get blown away when you actually taste the food. Ordered the 'basket of fries' and the 'chicken steak'. Honestly, the best chicken steak I have tasted in a long long time. And in comparison with quite a few big names of the city in this business. The basket of fries platter was a revelation too. Comprising of chicken strips, prawns and potato wedges which were actually fresh n not frozen (many big resturants serve frozen fried food  nowadays). Really really tasty. However, the place is really tiny with less than adequate seating arrangement. Hoping they will expand soon, owing to the awsome food they serve.

Goin West is a relatively new restaurant in Behala. Situated on James Long Sarani between Behala Chowrasta and Janakalyan, this outlet is not too big on size and there is every chance you might miss it until and unless you are actually looking for it. The actual restuarant is on the second floor. The ambiance is nice. Nicely framed photos decked up along the wall. The seating arrangement is also quite good. If you dont get a seat on one of the two tables, you can still have your food on the smaller tables lined up beside the windows. Its pretty neat actually, considering the lack of space. Coming to the food now. We were looking for a refreshment in the evening, and we ordered Chicken Wings- BBQ Style, and Basket of Fries. The food is good. The Chicken Wings might have been better off with some boneless pieces but that doesnot undermine the taste it carried. Basket of Fries is a collection of fries of chicken, fish and shrimps. The quantity was good, especially for the Basket of Fries. And at Rs. 440/-, it was pretty reasonable. They dont have card payment as of yet, but I am sure they would manage that soon. On the whole, a good experience.

The chicken wings was tangy with perfect combination of french fries and a mayo dip. 
Coming to fish, I'm not very fond of one but I really liked the way it was cooked with cheese. The herb rice complimented the dish. 
Overall a nice experience, would love to visit soon. :)

A very small continental joint located at James Long. Sarani. The interior decor is according to the current rage, where the poster of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and other American T.V series adorn the place. We ordered Black Current Cocktail, Pork Chops and Chicken Tetrazzini . The cocktail was good, pork chops dipped in BBQ sauce was delicious but to our disappointment, the Tetrazzini with excessive amount of white sauce was quiet bald and uncomfortable to consume and the quantity of Chicken was just minimum. The service was decent. The chef himself came down to enquire about the food quality, which was a commendable gesture.

I saw the rating of this restaurant and was so overwhelmed. It has a rating above 4 and it's at Behala Chowrasta, just 5 minutes' walk from my place. I searched for it's menu in zomato and became happier. Menu listed some awesomely thinkable food, for example Shepherd's pie. So, I made up my mind. I had to visit this place in one of the weekends. As thought, we visited this place on a Sunday night. It seemed to be a house turned restaurant. First floor of a house had been turned into Going West. Sitting arrangement was cozy though there are hardly 15 seats. Fortunately or unfortunately, when we visited the place, there was no other customer. We should have received the signal by then. But, it was too late to change the decision. We ordered Shepherd's pie and Fish Napolitan.
The dishes looked good. But then, we always have been taught not to go with the looks. How it became true!
First, Shepherd's pie was served with two bread toast and then the Fish Napolitan.
Shephard's Pie can be remarked as good if you taste one spoon of it. After that it was so sour that it will force you to vomit. First time, I ate one Chinese Shepherd's pie and that to be way too sour. "Never have it here". how can it have a 4+ rating! Perhaps, my day was bad.
Then the worst one : Fish Napolitan. It was served with herbed rice rather cajun spiced rice where the smell of the spice was over powering. French fries in it were good and crispy. The Fish was Basa. A tangy and strange kind of sauce was poured over the Fish where we did not get the taste of the fish. The sauce was again had an overpowering Chinese touch. In one word: Distasteful.
We wasted our hard earned money there. I am really astonished and for that I am writing the same thing thrice: How can 'Going West' get 4+ rating in Zomato?

A very good alternative to Park Street if you carve for international cuisine.  An almost a boutique type restaurant with great selection of foods.
The Chelo Kebab was quiet aromatic and flavorful although was a bit salty for my taste.
Apple Glazed Pork chops was a sweet n sour delicacy, balanced by the savoriness of rosemary, which I loved the most.
For the dessert, the Crepe Suzette was really appealing and tangy as it was served with orange jelly, which almost resembled Grand Marnier. It helped us from feeling too full at the end. 
Will definitely come back to try all the others.

Goin West seemed like a flower in the desert which the Behala area is. I was not impressed with the food or the options though. Definitely not a place for vegetarians.

We ordered the minestrone soup which was excellent. The croquette was very oily and instead of mushroom it was 95% potato and tasteless. The veg au gratin was even worse, in fact felt it was not edible so had to send it back. Chelo kebabs were much better but still a bit oily. 

I would rather not come back.

Goin West is the new continental eating hub in my locality and Today was my first visit. Its a small flat-turned-restaurant and there's very little space. The persons were good. 

Coming to the food, we'd ordered Buffalo style chicken wings which tasted awesome and was perfectly cooked. The grilled chicken salad was really tasty and I would like to have it again. The spaghetti with meatballs was good but the quantity of chilli was too much. Then the shepherd's pie was too good. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and would like to try more dishes.

P.S- they do not charge VAT and pocket pinch is worth it.

Went there a couple of months back after reading the reviews and the experience did not disappoint. The entrance may put you off, but once you are actually inside you'll love the ambience. Posters of F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Bob Marley, Charles Chaplin adore the wall with cocktail party music being played in the background makes it pretty cool. We had a Shepherd's pie,  Apple glazed Pork Chops and Chicken Parmigiano. The pie and chops were heavenly but the Parmigiano, which came recommended didn't strike the right taste buds.
 A special mention goes to the  owner, who is charming and friendly and sat down to talk with us and took note of our requests. Kudos for having a Continental outlet in the Biriyani and Chilli Chicken loving Culinary tastes of the people of Behala. Keep up the good work and plan to visit again!

The first time I visited this place I really liked it.
The shepherds pie and grilled chicken was pretty good. But then yesterday when I went there again I had a hell lot of different experience.

We ordered bbq chicken wings which was a bit sweetish. Then we ordered pork ribs glazed in apple sauce.. But even that was too sweet. We were so digusted thought of ordering something spicy. The chef guessed as to something was wrong so he suggested spaghetti in meat balls and said would make it spicy. But again the spaghetti had a wierd sweet taste although the meatballs were good.
The chef then came up and asked whether it was spicy or not and said with a grin in his face "Should I give you some chilli flakes now?".
There was just no need of this insult. The quality of food and behavior has deteriorated like hell.

Would recommend all the pizza lovers to visit this joint try out the thin crust pizza loaded with chunks and chunks of mixed meats, which hardly i have experienced in other pizza joints with just a piece of meat in each slice. The pork sausage on bed of smashed potatoe, the fresh prawn wrapped with bacons and the pork ribs tossed in apple sauce cooked in western style are my favourites from the menu.Not only food, i appreciate the classy colorful wall - brick red and yellow with little potraits... One suggestion, if you can start a bit early around mid afternoon at least for home delivery.

Firstly loved the Basket of fries.. it had everything.. that is a meal on it's own.. equally liked the Chicken Parmigiano and the next day had the Buffalo wings and the Spaghetti in meat balls and then Hot Brownie with ice cream.. it is amazing how all these dishes were perfect!!! Special mention should given to the Honey Mustard dip.. it was heavenly...
Each day I am craving to go back to that place... Thank you so much for giving us this great experience... You Sir are making us really really happy!!!!

The words ‘Continental’ and ‘Behala’ seemed light years away even couple of years back; I can say so with this much conviction since I was born and brought up in Behala, and I know this part of city so well, its pulse and its traits. To be very true, the place had a sorry culinary scenario, which is best if not discussed. I won’t say the present state has improved drastically but atleast it wont drive you antsy these days when you are dying to have some oriental or continental food sitting right there in Behala. The young local brigade is surely making their best efforts to improve the situation and offer more varieties of cafes and casual dining joints. Maybe it will take some time to clear this mess and to develop the taste buds of the localites; but still, there should be a starting point, some pioneer to get the ball rolling. And surely ‘Goin West’ is the pioneer when it comes to serving authentic continental food right there in Behala. Still this is a young venture and is basically a family run business. The owner, Sayantan, employee of an IT firm loves his job as well as his restaurant and so you can only get to meet him during the weekends. What I loved best about the place is its service and hospitality, and the point that really concerned me is its setup and the alley and stairs that gets you to this eatery. Since it’s basically 1st floor of a home turned into a restaurant, so obviously it lacks that glittery, classy, elegant and professional feel of a restaurant to it, and since I was not aware of this setup, so that was quite a setback as well as turn-off for me. But I must appreciate the effort and hard work that has been put to transform the interiors of that 1st floor room where people can sit and dine. The red and yellow neatly framed photographs and quotes will surely catch your eyeballs. The furnitures are nicely picked though I feel the seating arrangements should be improved, they should be more comfortable to enable people to spend more time there! And yes, I really loved the tracks which were being played, tried to Shazam them all but maybe our gang was tad too noisy that night!

Amazing, mouth-watering, lip-smacking, finger-licking good food. I decided to bring in my birthday with some good food but what I was home_delivered was a little taste of heaven. I am a big foodie and have been to many restaurants but trust me when I tell u that this place is a hidden gem when it comes to awesome food. I had ordered grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, bacon wrapped prawn, chicken rouler, and prawn kabab. I would suggest each one of u to definitely try these items. It is more than worth it. Kudos to the chef and the owners. Great job guys.keep it up.

Goin West is a virtual mirage amidst the bare continental serving forefront of Behala. A place where North India cuisine reigns , Going West is a drastic newness introduced in the palate of people of Behala. Location: The restaurant is located at James Long Sarani. If one is coming from Chowrasta then one should board off at Janakalyan stoppage. A walk down James Long, you will surely locate it on the right side.
            

Ambience and Decor : This is a small little joint, situated at the mezzanine of an old house. The decor draws its inspiration from European cafés. A red theme restro which speaks volumes about food and friendship by the posters in the wall. The small little wall motifs and the lampshades gives an old Europe feeling. The best part however is the English classics of Clapton, Hendrix which is sheerly a bliss and sets up an apt ambience.

Staffs : A young, promising chef, Mr. Sayantan and his experimentation made this a grand success in the bylanes of Behala. His wife lends him all the support, to make his dream come true. His team of chefs are extremely talented. Great set of hospitable , welcoming people. 

Food: Going West is a typical Continental joint, serving the best of diverse European cuisine. the menu appears to be quite diverse.

They serve authentic western food... maybe occasionally modified a bit to suit the Indian palate. A homely ambience. Reasonable price. Overall, very impressive!

Had noticed this place across the road while riding my bike with my fiance. Decided to try it out on the way back. Entrance is abit narrow but once you reach inside, the deco is good with great old school rock and country music playing ! The menu was interesting with a various options, I tried the apple glazed pork. It was good and quantity wise was filling for 2 people. Would recommend or suggest if they could start serving Beef ( if allowed )as well, as stake always tastes better if its beef..overall is nice place if you want to try something different apart from the regular chinese or biryani !

Small place. Low lights, nice wall arts. Food is not up to the mark, and late delivery. Pasta tastes just bland. This place is just not up to the mark. According to the price there are many great cafes at Behala.

So we found this Italian/American cuisine restaurant in Behala. Judging from the pictures and reviews on zomato, the place seemed like a must visit.
So the first turn off was the entrance. It was shady and dingy and gives a terrible impression. The restaurant itself is not so. Well decorated, with pop culture posters and dim lighting. The tables were exceptionally lovely, especially the ones at the side. The place is small and not too suitable for large groups. They had old rock music playing which was a big plus point from my side.
Now coming to the food, we ordered Penne Alfredo, Mutton Lasagna and Grilled Chicken Steak.
They all smelled delicious and the presentation was fine. But the food was not as delicious as we had expected. They were well made with a proper blend of salts and spices but they had a bland flavour to it that just didn't strike your taste buds. The pasta was standard, a little low on the cheese but it was alright, with the proportion of chicken being a little on the lower side. I mainly had the lasagna, which I would consider a disaster. The taste was bland and it wasn't even baked properly. The whole thing was gooey and liquid-y and the sheets weren't intact. The portion of mutton was a lot but the flavours didn't do the trick at all. The portion of the steak was really small and it tasted mediocre. The meat could have been a little softer.
The staff is courteous and the food is not high priced. There food wasn't too bad, but it isn't a place I'd be too keen on visiting again.

Very nice environment with lovely music and sports channel in t.v. Well decorate western style. Nice service with awesome teasty dishes. The prices is very reasonable.
Enterence is very small and not so attractive but other all mind blowing. 
As a chef, I suggest those people who really like western food and to those also who wants some change.

Mouthwatering Continental Affair at Goin West, Behala!

Till late, the locality of Behala did not see any upspringing of Continental or Chinese Restaurants and were mostly defined by the local street side shops, or some age old restaurants dominating the area since long. However, with time, Behala has really grown into a modern and well developed locality with more and more eating places coming up one after the other. Keeping in tandom, with the other popular areas like Park Street, Esplanade, Salt Lake, Jadavpur, Hatibagan and so on, some of the popular brands have put up their chains in and around Behala. Some new names have come up as well, mostly by budding entrepreneurs, who keeps a good taste and passion in food and related business and wants to do something to nurture the same, apart or beside their regular professional life.

One such restaurant, Goin West, is one of the latest additions in the map of gastronomical ventures in this locality. Situated near Janakalyan, which falls somewhat between Behala Chowrasta and James Long-Shakher Bajar Crossing, this is located bang opposite to the park at Sakher Bazar. A clear landmark would be the sweet shop right on the footpath which can be seen easily through the naked eyes. A small sized outlet, carved out of probably a 1 BHK Flat, this place offers some lipsmacking Continental delicacies, which was otherwise not to be found in this place even an year before. The entrance to the flat is narrow and the stairs are steep. Once you climb up the stairs, you would see that the height between the floor and the door is quite small as well, but once you actually step inside the actual restaurant, you would be floored and impressed by the lovely decorations all around.

Even though the place is very tiny and small, the owner has kept no stones unturned to make this place look like a wonderland. Lovely quirky posters hung up the wall all across the place, some cute and sweet looking showpieces and the dim light reflecting from the glowing bulbs, would seem to transport you into a different place altogether. Coming to the space, this place can house at the most 15-16 heads at the most. The main inconvenience is the sitting options, which are painstakingly small. For someone like me with a fat butt, the inconvenience factor is high, but then the place is so small, accommodating large sized tools and chairs is virtually impossible.

If the entrance and sitting options has their own problem, the same is surpassed and overlooked by the hospitality one would receive from this place. Not to mention, the high quality of food this place dishes out. I had been to this place earlier on my way, and I was badly disappointed with most of the dishes I had opted for. However, it was mostly my mistake, which I realized later on, as I had selected wrong options as take-away. The place has developed a lot after my visit, and has worked very well to overcome its shortcomings. Team #panchphoron was invited over for a brief food tasting session, and following are the dishes, which we were offered:

1) STARTERS

a) EARLY SUNRISE

Sparkling pulpy orange on the rocks, drizzled with grenadine, to set the mood. Fizzy and refreshing, this was the perfect drink to quench our thirsty souls. The tanginess was just alright, and the sweetness component too complimented its counterpart pretty well. To be opted for when served chilled.

b) CHEESE AND MUSHROOM CROQUETTES WITH SALSA

Potato croquettes filled with mozzarella and minced mushroom, crumb fried and served with spicy salsa. More like the traditional ‘Alur Chop’ served by your mother, this one had mashed potato which was mixed with spices and masala, tossed with mozzarella and minced mushrooms, and then given a cyrindrical shape, dipped into eggwhite and breadcrumbs and fried golden till perfection. Served with a spicy salsa, this is one starter which should be opted by everyone.

c) POACHED FISH QUENELLES

Basa dumplings poached in flavored stock, pan seared and served with chilly mayo dip. Honestly, this was one dish which could not impress most of us. Being a poached fish into the flavored stock, the mixture as such lacked any flavor or taste. The chili mayo dip appeared bland as well, and failed to uplift or complement the poached fish.

d) BBQ CHICKEN WINGS

Fried chicken wings in homemade BBQ sauce till a sticky consistency. Shifting from the traditional method of purchasing readymade BBQ sauce from the supermarket, the restaurant manufactures and produces its own version of BBQ Sauce. Tangy, sweet and crispy, a lil’ bit more of the BBQ sauce could have done wonders to the overall flavor. The Chicken Wings otherwise was very crispy, and made us lick our hands after having a portion each.

MAIN COURSE

e) FARMHOUSE MOUSSAKA

Layered veggies and cream cheese sauce, baked….a Greek classic. A vegetarian version of standard Lasagne, this one had fresh vegetable kept in layers, along with cream cheese sauce. The dish was then baked to perfection, creating a seamless harmony of vegetables and cheese. If the vegetable version would be so nice, who would prefer having a proper Chicken Lasagne!

f) CHICKEN CASSEROLE

Hearty chicken thigh and drumstick slow cooked with carrots, mushroom and pearl onions and gravy. A soul food for a precise definition, the sauce was super rich and filled with flavors. The chicken portions were unbelievably soft, and came out easily with a slight prick of the knife. A pepper sauce based gravy perhaps, this was one dish, which really set the mood up for the evening.

g) PORK SCHNITZELS

German classic, lean pork bread crumbed & fried served with fries and dips. A well executed dish, this one had lean pork portions, which was dipped in egg white and bread crumbs, and then fried to perfection. The pork portion was all meat, and hence we had no unnecessary problem in dealing with the fat content. The schnitzels was super crispy, and went well with the freshly made fries and the tasty dips.

h) LASAGNA

Lasagna sheets layered between cheesy sauce and minced mutton, topped with grated cheese and baked in the oven. A typical Italian dish, this one had lasagna sheets, which was put in layers between minced mutton and cheesy sauce. This dish was topped with grated cheese and then baked to perfection. The cheesy sauce was super rich, and along with the cheese, which sedimented after being baked to perfection, impressed our tastebuds. The mutton was prepared well and was something I would have had liked to have, even without the cheese.

DESSERT

i) CREPE SUZETTE

Vanilla flavored pancakes flambéed and drizzled with orange sauce and topped with ice-cream. No proper meal ends without something sweet. For us, it was a crepe. The pancakes were flavored with vanilla and drizzled with orange sauce, and was topped with ice cream to let the coldness of the ice cream intertwingle with the hot, crispy and sugar-enriched crepe.

The place still has a lot of untapped potential. The place is relatively new and should work on its shortcomings to make Goin West a preferred Continental destination on any given day. The owner is really passionate about this place and makes sure, that he listens to every complain attentively and works upon the same to rectify it and not to repeat the same thing again. New dishes are worked out every given day, and with this continuous thirst for innovation and advancement, am sure ‘Goin West’ is one name, which would really make its mark as a standalone restaurant.

American, Italian and Continental cuisine under the same shade at Behala. Yes, Goin' West is that cozy place which welcomes you with the classics by the Beatles , Bob Marley , Andy Williams and many more. With an innovative interior memories can be created here with a plateful Shepherd's Pie or Chicken Stroganoff. Your pocket will not pinch leaving your stomach smile. With finger licking wholesome goodness I spent one of the most delicious evening with my family. Keep serving happiness , "Goin' West"..

Small and tidy place within nicely done interior.toys and photographs adorn the cheerful yellow wall along with a bookshelf full of must reads.we ordered chicken parmigiano which consisted of crunchy chicken breast covered with mince sauce and cheese along with tangy pasta. It was yummy.the small pieces of minced mutton along with chicken filling and cheese presented a superb flavour.the saucy pasta supplemented the taste.totally worth the price.

Well this is my utmost pleasure reviewing a place that I absolutely loved. It was a lazy drizzling Sunday evening and few of my friends decided to meet up for a quick bite and lots of adda. While searching zomato frantically this little cafe caught my eye and so we decided to give it a try. I was a bit skeptical at first as this kind of continental cafe was new in the area. It is located at the James long crossing of Janakalyan. It is a very small place with two tables of four and some bar stools. We were very warmly welcomed and was escorted to our seats. As soon as I sat down the walls with photo frames snatched my attention away. It had most of the things I loved be it the characters from FRIENDS, or the news of the titanic tragedy or the famous quotes or the food facts. It seemed that those two little red walls told tales of the bygone years. The owner Mr. Shyantan was very cordial and welcoming. He personally came over and suggested few dishes. Now coming to the food.
1. BBQ chicken wings - Beautifully prepared with that tangy flavoured BBQ sauce. The chicken were very tender and we'll cooked. I also loved the presentation.

2. Cocktail sausages with French fries - Again a beautifully prepared dish. The minced meat in the sausages were very tasty. The homemade mayonnaise dip notched up the taste buds a bit more.

3. Legendary fish and chips- this was the only dish that dissappointed me. It was kind of butter fish fry. The fish seemed a little dry and there was no taste as such. We had to force it down with the mayonnaise. Mr. Sayantan please work on this dish to make it better.

4. French fries - well just plain and simple French fries with dips.

5. Bacon fry - well not a big fan of bacon but one of my friend loves these so had to order. I have no idea how these should taste so not commenting on it. But as my friend liked it so no complaints I guess.

6. Shepherds pie - last but definitely not the least. Our food extravaganza ended with a bang. I just loved every bit of it. This has to be my favourite out of all the dishes I had. Yummy minced mutton with mashed potato on top and perfectly baked. I had dreams of this dish maybe for a week after. I am definitely visiting again to try out the different pies.

7. Sweet lime soda - good and refreshing

Overall a very enjoyable experience trying out the various dishes. Mr Sayantan was very kind and warm. He told us how challenging it was to open this restaurant as it was kind of unique in this area.
I would like to see some more variety of dishes. And please add some dishes involving eggs. I give my best wishes to Mr. Sayantan and would love to see this cafe get bigger in the future.

How far would you go in search of something different to eat in Kolkata at 8 pm ? What if i say i live in Rajarhat but went to Behala which is extreme opposite just to try out some Continental food speciality  ,that sounds very food exploring for sure ,doesn’t it ? Yes i have done that and why not as now Behala has its own new charm of  a restaurant called GOIN WEST which is in James long sarani or you may find it easy to locate if you are at Janakalyan stop and then you may walk down the street for a few min’s untill you spot a blue led light and black /yellow display outside in bold letter’s written GOIN WEST then surely know that you successfully arrived your destination  .

Here is my first review on Zomato after our 5th visit to the newly established Continental restaurant in Behala (James Long Sarani) -- "Goin West"... where we kept "Goin" for weeks... ;)  

Certainly, a place where you can have faith in the quality and the striking taste of food..as each time we stepped in, the meal was equally tempting and appetizing (like the previous time) or even better... :)  

Once you enter inside you will realize that the owner had utilized the small place very efficiently and effectively. The interior has been really furnished and enhanced with simple but eye catching materials which you will surely admire,  and its quite amazing. Simple and graceful!! (y) 
The entrance wont excite you but you can ignore that because I am sure if the owner would have got a chance to decorate and design the exterior then that would have been as appreciable as the interior too!! 

Now lets come to the prime and the dominant segment..We tried many items including their special and signature dishes..all were just classic and spectacular. Items like :-  
Cheese and chicken croquettes  --  It was full-flavoured,
Scotch Egg  --  Ummmmm...Delectable!!,
Bbq chicken wings  --  Very tempting, juicy & spicy....,
Chilli meat and wafers  --  Piquant..sharp taste & appetizing,
French fries  -- Perfect!!,
Homemade mayonnaise  --  Served with almost every dishes....a Delicious homemade item,
Sloppy joe  --  A toothsome morsel....,
Legendary fish and chips  --  Appealing!!,
Fish in parsley sauce  --  Yummy & finger-licking,
Chicken parmigiana  --  A luscious dish...,
Apple glazed pork chops  --  Palatable!!!,
Chelo kebab  --  Appetizing!!,
Mixed grills  --  A succulent meal...,
Fettuccini in meatballs  --  So tasty that one wants more...,
Lasagne  --  A must have mouth-watering scrumptious dish......,
Shepherd's pie  --  Flavorous!!,
Fresh lime soda  --  Not so refreshing..Could have been better,,
Warm brownie with vanilla ice-cream  --  A scrummy treat....,

Its simply very impressive the way their dishes are decorated and served..and that is why I have uploaded few pictures (kindly excuse me for the poor quality)..Also, would like to add their great hospitality and the soothing music which keeps playing in the background..... 

I would like to conclude by saying that I really loved the place and loved visiting there...and although everything is directed well, keeping in mind that the place is small, we would appreciate and cherish more if the chairs could have been a bit more big with a mid rise backrest which makes it more
comfortable and with a few types of imported beers would  make it supercalifragilisticexpialidocious...and then I can rate 5.5/5 or 6.0/5 if there is an option to do so... :D 

Keep running the great place and we will keep recommending and keep visiting..Cheers!!! :D :) (Y)

Amidst the North Indian and Chinese restaurants in Behala, Goin West is one of its kind and is indeed a hidden gem. Who could have imagined that a restaurant specializing in Continental could ever open up in Behala, which is strictly restricted to the same old age North Indian and Chinese. In that case, the owners Sayantan and Chandrani need a huge round of applause for doing this risky and commendable job, thereby changing the palette of the residents of Behala. The luring reviews and ratings that this place gets has always urged me to give this a visit and this happened when Panchphoron was invited over a food tasting session at Goin West.

This isn’t the first time I am writing about the recent bloom of eateries in Behala, nor would it be that last time. The recent years have seen an exponential growth in the no. of restaurants & cafes along James Long Sarani. Which is good, going by the fact even a couple of years back the road used to be a dimly lit mess apart from a few nothing. However majority of the restaurants serve either fast foods, Mughlai, Chinese or a mix of the above. Thankfully few restaurants opened up serving authentic Bengali dishes. Still the area lacked an outlet which would serve some decent continental delicacies.
                                                                ...

After going through the reviews and ratings, me and my brother finally went there..! 
We were expecting alot from this place but it lead to nothing but disappointment..
Okay so we ordered Apple glazed pork chops.. Me and my brother didn't liked it much as it had a lot of pork fat in it which was really very disgusting..
Then we ordered carnivorous pizza which was good apparently.. We liked it actually..
Now coming to the service part I must admit that service was a bit slow..
Ambience was pretty good..!
            
Overall I had a okay okay types experience..! :)

" 3 things are needed for a good life :good friends, good food & good music ".

Such a beautiful statement . A saying that goes well with us the "bangalis" . I mean that's what we are all about right .. adda .. gaan .. a nice company and some mouth watering delicacies. And with the splurge of new restaurants coming up now and then , we hardly require a "bahana" to go , explore and eat . But if you find a place which serves you the motto that you live by , you end up having an experience unlike anything, and thereafter you are left with a good memory . A very nice young guy Sayantan has come up with a gem of a place which believes in the idea that i am talking about . I had earlier heard a lot about this restaurant and after a string of plans getting cancelled i and my foodie buddy finally managed to go there one sunday evening.

* Location : - The restaurant is located on James Long Sarani. If you are coming from Chowrasta then go to Janakalyan stoppage and then enter it .Go ahead along the road which will lead you straight to James Long, take left and then you will come across this restaurant after just a few footsteps .

* Ambience : - It does not have a huge space . It will be advisable to go in small groups . They have two 4 sitters and they rest are like a horizontal seating where you seat beside your partner in a row. Although size is a crunch i liked the idea of sitting in a row close to your partner especially if you are going as a couple. But a group more than 4 can be a tad uncomfortable to seat.

* Food : - Who cares about ambience if you are served with yummy food. I mean that should be the USP of every restaurant . And since this is the first fully continental restaurant in Behala i was really hopeful and excited about the experience  . And by god they did not let us down . We were not in the mood of trying starters so we went ahead with the following items in the main course :-

*****************************************************************************************************************
1. Shepherds Pie ( 4 / 5 ) :-  This was my first time with this delicacy. Its not a new item served in this city but somehow i had never managed to have it . But i am glad that it was my first time here . I could clearly feel the minced mutton among the cheese and garlic . Every spoonful was of a meaty delight in your mouth. The dish is good enough for 2 people . 2 garlic bread pieces are served and it complements well with the dish . I am certain it will be a hit here .

2. Apple glazed pork chops ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Heard so much about this dish, an absolute delight for pork lovers. There are  some dishes that are cooked with so much heart and soul that it becomes a legend ,and this is so much like that dish. There are enough pork pieces cooked so brilliantly with the "oh so tasty" apple sauce. This is the first time i have experienced the  combo of these 2: pork and apple sauce. Something to savour, On the top of that the mashed potato in this dish is by far the best i have ever had.  The pork , sauce and the mashed potato did wonders and it was an instant hit to me. On the top of that, the dish has 2 pieces of sausage and salami each which were totally out of the world. It was clear that a lot of effort had gone out to prepare and package the dish. Something i have always craved for in even bigger and famed restaurants but got very few . For every pork lovers out there, this is a dish that you should bookmark .

3. Grilled Fish in Lemon butter sauce ( 5 / 5 ) :-  A dish not new to the people of this city . Almost every continental outlets serve "grilled fish " with a variety of sauces but lemon butter sauce being the most common on all of them. After having 2 heavier dishes we thought of ordering a light one . I have had this dish before but this has to be the best among all of them . Everybody serves basa fish in this dish and everywhere it is almost the same but not here . The basa here is bought everyday from the renowed Behala Bajar fish market by the owner himself.  He does not use frozen fish and that is the reason why the fish fillets are so damn tasty here. For an instance it did not seem like basa to me. I do not seem to recall any other good grilled fish ever. I herbed rice that comes with it was perfect and it complimented the fish well . I cannot seem to forget the fish still now . I will request everyone to try the grilled fish here at least once to know how it is different or should i say better than  the others .

As you can clearly see from the ratings that it started from a 4 and gradually increased to 5 in 3 dishes . When you have an experience like this you are bound to take a good impression and "goin west" gave us a memorable treat that evening. Even after all these we ordered "sweet lime soda' which in my opinion was one of the best i have ever had.  It was a tad sweeter to my liking and i was enjoying to the every last sip.

*****************************************************************************************************************

* Service : - The average time in between the dishes was more than 10 minutes . But since all the dishes were done with a lot of heart , we were in no mood of taking the time as a factor . The owner himself tends to take the orders from everyone and has the habit of helping you with selecting the items . He is very amiable and his passion towards food with somehow let you choose the appropriate dish of your choice. The staff is very well behaved and polite other than that.

**** A very very important point to note is that they do not charge any taxes. All the items in the menu are inclusive of taxes . After such a good dinner this is just the "icing on the cake ".

Following are the points to summarize from the experience :-

1. Small and cosy , appropriate for couple outings.
2. Continental fare for behala people, rather good food.
3. Excellent pork items.
4. Grilled fish to die for .
5. No taxes .

This restaurant has all the ingredients to be in the "hidden gems" category of Zomato. This is a very coveted and widely popular list . I donot recall any restaurants from Behala to be a part of this list . But i wholeheartedly wish  that this eatery features in that list someday . It is still now the one with the highest rating in this part of the city and if they keep on doing the good work that they are doing,i am sure one day that dream will become a reality .

To the non-behala people who are reading this review, i urge them to come to behala and try out at this restaurant . And as for the behala people if you are a foodie and have not still tried out here , you are missing out on something really wonderful and yummy. I wish the wonderful owner "all the very best " and surely i will go back again for trying the dishes with the "white sauce ". Till then enjoy the good life .

been there with my brother on his birthday  well its a very small place to have food with but yes the way they have utilized such a short place its commendable ...if you are planning to go with a large gang make sure there are seats or u might have to return or wait 
coming to the ambiance its dimly lit but the way they have tried to decorate is good coming to food we ordered main courses like chello kebab-whih was ok ok as you ant expect a dish at such a price but it could have been better as the veggies of kebab were not fully cooked so it could have been better 
we ordered apple glazed pork chops which was good to taste not too sweet and soft as well i loved the dish 
after these we ordered crepe Suzette with orange sauce whih was tooo sweet for my taste buds though it looked awesome but was too sweet to have it 
ok the staff was great as well
to sum up its has a good future :)

Perceiving by the entrance,didn't expect much  when I walked into this small joint located at James long sarani. But I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and the warm hospitality of the staff. The ambience seemed pretty comfortable and considering the fact that it has opened not even a year ago the menu also needs a few additions. But most importantly after a hearty meal I walked out with a full tummy and a smile of content. It was worth it!

Goin West is a bold experiment for a place like Behala and man, I'm glad this has come out so well. A big fan of Big Chill, Delhi myself, I found the menu of Goin West comfortably continental and highly gratifying. Tired of Biryani and Dominos, Goin West proved to be an infusion of fresh new varieties for me. 

Done up nice and smug, one feels at home at this resto, specially peeking over the ledge while sipping on some soda. It was tough on first sight to choose what to eat, but my instincts guided me to pork chops, penne in alfredo and bacon wrapped prawns, topped with some soda. Decided and ordered, food came in a decent time till I was left with the soda and yearning for something to munch on. Digging in, the pork came out to be perfect as the chef intelligently chopped it before hand, saving me of all the struggle and handpicking. Next, the pasta was thick and superb, while the prawns were melt in mouth. My bad that I couldn't possibly eat more. 

I'm already planning my visit for sure on my next trip to Calcutta. Knowing Sayantan, an old buddy, I'm glad to have finally visited Goin West -  a labour of his love for food, kitchens and entrepreneurship! Truckloads of Respect for his spirit!  

For the love of food, do visit! Till then let the pictures titillate you :)

This is the new star kid in the block i.e behalas food scene, so it got my attention for quite sometime. The concept of running an exclusive "continental" food joint in a locality where only Indian Chinese and substandard biryani thrives is quite a bold step in itself. Kudos to the gentleman for having such big ****** for starting this exclusive "continental" food joint.
But from now everything starts going downhill!!
Three of us visited this place last Saturday evening.
Location: right on James long road on the opposite to the Samar chowdhury park. Parking is a bit difficult as its a towing zone!

Ambience: its just a room on the 1st floor of an apartment converted to an eating joint. Provided with small desks n chairs, hanging light on the table and good collection of music playing on the background. Paper cuttings laminated and used as wall hangings seemed clichéd to me. Anyways, I'm one of the firm believers that ambience n appearance doesn't deter the taste of the food. So I won't rate it based on comfort n ambience.

Service: helpful owner, helped us to locate the restaurant easily . The waiter though has knowledge about the dishes isn't helpful in suggesting the dishes.

Food: we ordered, chilli meat and chicken wings buffalo style as entrées. Both came along quickly.

Chilli meat: mutton mince/keema, prepared with  "bolognese" sauce served in a bowl with American style flavoured chips on the wooden plank. The sauce was soured a bit more than usual which took away the identity of the dish. It was okayish. Rating: 2.5/5

Chicken wings buffalo style: 6 pieces of juicy chicken wings well marinated and cooked in applesauce was served with a sweetened mayonnaise dip, which really lacked the touch of imagination. The applesauce gave the wings a perfect sweet n sour balanced taste. However, the sweet mayo dip tilted the balance in favour of sweetness of the dish, eventually ruining the flavour of the dish. Rating 3.2/5

For main course we ordered a spaghetti bolognese and mixed grill, right after we ordered the entrées. Herein, was the duty of the waiter to warn us that dishes we were ordering were becoming repetitive! We weren't warned about the chilli meat to be the same flavoured mutton mince to be used for spaghetti bolognese. However, on the plus we were given a fair warning that mixed grill would take ages to prepare.

Spaghetti bolognese: in came the dish, with minimal spaghetti and excess of mutton mince! No one around the table seemed to enjoy it after the chilli meat. Also the bolognese sauce was too much soured. Rating: 2/5

Mixed grill: I was really by then, apprehensive about my choice of order. It did take lot of time to prepare and arrived at last but the taste wasn't worth the wait! It consisted of 2 hearty pieces of chicken steak, 1  thin slice of fish steak, 1 mutton patty, few pieces of pork ribs, salamis, sausages served with mashed potatoes, little bit of flavoured rice, garlic bread , French fries and an egg poach. I could understand why this dish took so long! However, as a piece of suggestion, if there is this kind of dish in the menu, well, the cook/chef should be well prepared to prepare it. The main setback about the dish was that, it took so long to prepare, that most of the dish became cold, thereby reducing the taste by margin.
The chicken steak marinated by brown sauce was difficult to cut into, the fish steak was tender but again it was soured a bit more, the mutton patty was dry, the garlic bread was hard. But the worst was the pork ribs glazed by applesauce. It tasted nice, but was undercooked, thereby making the meat on the bones very chewy!! Overall the dish clearly dashed my expectations. Rating 2.5/5

So to sum up, we had even though not huge but fair amount of expectations from this place due to its steady rating in zomato and trust me we were let down badly. I would hope that my choice of food was bad or it was their one of those bad day performances and hope best for them!!
Anyways, experiment over for me, lesson learned!! I'm back to those Indian Chinese and substandard biryani places that dominates the food scene of my place.
Overall rating: 2.8/5 rounded off to 3.0.
Ps The host is nice and food is very cheap. Though the quantity is less, it is ok as per the price tag. 500bux for 2ppl.

Small but very comfy and well decorated place.. The location of this place is quite accessible..
I went there with reference from Zomato and it was a really a worthwhile experience. They served a homemade mayonnaise which was really unique and very delicious. I found it a little too sweet for my taste but my acquaintances found it perfect. And the plating was just purely a delight.. 
Coming to the food..
1. BBQ Chicken Wings: This I had found reference from almost all reviews around here and it was faaantastic.. The BBQ sauce was the perfect texture and perfectly balanced.

2. Chicken Stroganoff: One word: Wow!! The rich gravy with mushrooms and cheese was adequately complemented with the herb rice which was again top notch. This is a must try!! Would be back hungry for this again..

3. Apple Grazed Pork Chops: Another great dish but the mashed potato was a little bland. The fat had been rendered well and the meat was cooked just a tad less than perfection. The flavour of the glaze was very nice and the bone was quite juicy. Another must try for meat craving people.

4. Grilled Chicken: This was unfortunately a let down. The mash lacked salt and the gravy was okay-ish, though the chicken was very succulent.

5. Crêpe Suzette with Orange Sauce: The crêpes were very tender and the orange sauce was quite nice though I couldn't figure out whether is was packaged or homemade. They could have been a little more generous with the ice cream though. 

Overall a very very very good experience especially because there are almost no restaurants in the area who serve this kind of food. Though a little advise would be to increase the portions a little. We being meat lovers would really have enjoyed a few spoonfuls more. Great job though.. The concept, the decor, the wall hangings create an ambience worthy of enjoying a hearty meal with family or friends.. And the staff very extremely courteous and keen on taking notes on improving their services and quality. Keep up the good work.. And expect me sneak around soon with a empty stomach and high expectations about other foods in the menu!! 
Kudos!!

An extremely small place with good food. Prices are quite reasonable considering the quality and quantity. The entrance is a bit confusing, yet we found our way in. We ordered a sloppy Joe burger and a chelo kebab. 
The burger came shortly, but the chelo kebab took forever, almost literally. A case not just with our table, but with all the other tables.

Their kitchen is probably understaffed.
Also, some dishes are more complicated and they take time. They should plan their menu/staff accordingly.

Located just a few clicks from janakalyan james long crossing if you are travelling towards chowrasta from shakherbazar. Located on the first floor of the building.
A very small restaurant but its food quality certainly makes you forget that point. Food ia really delicious and quantity is good too. Nicely decorated and comfy environment. Their prices won't even pinch your pocket.
 Each and every staff behaves nicely. A place definitely worth a revisit.

If this place would have been any bigger, I certainly would have given them a higher rating.

Recently they have introduced their new and elaborate menu and I must say those new ones are yummy too...

The rave reviews in Zomato made sure I give this a visit, and it's only a few minutes walk from my home! 
I decided to give this one a try on my Birthday, that's right, I celebrated by 21st here. I called them in the afternoon and kinda threatened them to be as good as the reviews read :P . They were better, actually. :)
I went in to see the super interesting red yellow ( yes yes, the KEB stink :P) decor and the beautiful posters of Chaplin and FRIENDS and such.. 
I went in, made reference to the phone call, and had the Chef out, talking to us, helping us choose from the menu and talking us through about the concept of the restaurant. My favourite cuisine is Continental, and I take no nonsense when it comes to that. I told him, I have high expectations, and they were met. 
We started with Cheese and Mushroom Croquettes, BBQ Chicken Wings, Farmhouse Augratin, Chicken Stroganoff, Apple Glazed Pork Chops and Grilled Chicken.
The Cheese & Mushroom Croquettes were a special request for my Aunt, who only has vegetarian food. He was more than happy to make it for her.  They were lighlty fried and not at all oily. Gooey centre and ample amount of cheese, this is a sure win.
I knew I had to order the BBQ Chicken Wings from the reviews. Well marinated, slow cooked, super moist fries with the brilliant tangy taste. This one made me go "oh my dear God". I'd have liked it a little hotter. The butter sauce or dip they serve it with elevates the dish to another level. This is a must order and a sure shot winner. 
The APPLE GLAZED PORK was my choice. It was a generous amount, cooked to great consistency and a lovely glaze coated it. I was very happy with this one. Moreover the fat of the pork was properly rendered, which made me very happy. I'll go back for this one.
The FARMHOUSE AUGRATIN was a all round cheesy experience. But they should add more veggies to make this one interesting. 
STROGANOFF CHICKEN  was an all round typical continental dish. The creamy, gooey chicken with white sauce was a favourite round the table. The rice served along with it, had a distinct flavour which added to the dish. The use of Mushroom in the dish was very clever. 
GRILLED CHICKEN I'd recommend this one for a light flavoursome dinner. The light, fresh lemon based grill left the chicken succulent and was complemented by a creamy smooth potato base. This is what continental food is all about. 
The only negative was I went in to find out, one has to order the Chicken ala Kiev and Scotch Eggs 2hrs beforehand in order to eat 'em. That's really not done. And one tip I could give them is to increase the amount of Vegetarian items for them godly people :D!
This small food joint at Janakalyan shows a lot of promise and is already on my favourite list. A big thank you to GW from someone who's forever disappointed in Behala.

Goin west goes by it's name!! Well, if you are hungry  n bit low on cash, just head to this new cafe types retro which is just perfect for friends to hang out and have great food. I have heard many reviews about this restro. So, yesterday visited this place. The things that will attract you :  Ambience n food. What else do u need? Lol. 
We ordered cheese n chkn something(appetisers) which was okay types. But I loved the cocktail mesh. I don't remember the name exactly. Actually I ordered cocktail sausages, but it was over by then, so the manager told us to try this one as it has the same ingredients. In main course we ordered chkn stroganoff which did not disappoint us at all. It was well cooked. I would love to taste carnivorous pizza the next day I visit there! Items are short and crisp bt yes u do have choices. Bob Marley and poets of the fall running  at the background.And the main thing is it is pocket friendly. One suggestion from this music lover : play some Beatles and scorpions too. ;)
The only thing which they can improve is on :
Space and a bit fast delivery. That's it. Overall it was a lovely experience and that too in Behala!!

Goin West !! Gone West !! Enjoyed West !! A small eat house as i like it. Was in my wishlist for sometime now and  finally made it last Saturday. This is a place operating from the 19th of December,2015. So a restaurant not even a year old. Coming to the ambience and decor its crunch but neat and clean with good frames all around and some great old country rock numbers playing in the background keeping the theme in mind. Ordered Fish in Parsley Sauce and Grilled Chicken Salad in Thousand Island Dressing. The salad was good and healthy but I think the chicken could have been a bit more tender. The Fish comes with rice and bread and its Parsley Sauce all the way. It was great. Loved every bit of it. Will surely get back soon to try a few other dishes which are already pre-planned. Service is quick and the only staff i saw was helpful and polite. Well done Sayantan. You were really a good host. Thanks.

Hearty honest food, cooked with passion, served with love.
Don't dare judge this place by the outer facade, it's a hidden gem by all means and true to its nature, can be hard to locate, aside the big yellow signboard.
The space inside is quite small, yet felt quite homely & cozy due to the space utilizing furniture and warm color & light setting.
The chef personally attends each table asking for feedback and was very humble and respectful of our amateur opinions on his dishes, considering (as we later got to know while speaking) he has spent a good amount of time studying and working as a chef abroad.
The dishes are totally unique to Behala, with a good number of well done, classic/timeless pork dishes. Side note: if you are ok with pork and haven't had their cocktail sausages...its a CRIME!! Its prepared in a typical Anglo style, lightly spiced, cooked to perfection, served with barbecue sauce.
There's also a number of all-time favorites like ala-kiev, stroganoff, lasagna, chello kabab, etc.
Have tried out most of them by now, and I am impressed. (Peter Cat, Mocambo, you are never getting a penny out from me anymore.)
And there's reason why the food tastes so good, all of the items are made in the restaurant, from scratch, that includes the sauces and the sausage stuffing. And you can tell that the chef isn't doing this just to make money. He is passionate about the food and takes it very personally. He even offered to cook us anything we could ask him as long as he had the ingredients in the house (and with a little advance notice 😀)
Overall, I wish them all the best, they're making all the right strides with the limited resources at hand and I really appreciate that.

This restaurant should definitely be included in "hidden gem" section. It is a small but vibrant place serving continental dishes, which is one of its first kind in Behala food scenario. We ordered chili meat and wafers as starter. Both the presentation and taste were superb. For main course we ordered fish in parsley sauce and sticky bar-b-q pork ribs. Both tasted too good. the fish actually melted in mouth. As dessert, we tried crepe suzette which again got full marks both in presentation and taste category. Overall, it was a nice experience and we will definitely go back again.

With the rapid increase of food joints in the city and particularly in the Southern Part of Kolkata ,the competition of restaurants has become tough. But when you have your own USP that can attract customers you don't need to worry much. Same is the case with Goin West. This food joint serves European and American cuisine , which I can say is one of the rare food joints to serve this cuisine in Behala. Went to this place after reading some good reviews of my foodie friends and I was not disappointed at all. This place impressed me with its food and the service.

Location: Located in James Long Sarani just near to Janakalyan and beside Coffee Den, this place can be a treasure hunt for you if you are not attentive to find the restaurant board.

Ambience: A small quirky place with bright red and yellow walls. Photo frames of various personalities and events of west. I loved the window side sitting where you get a view of the road while dining. The lampshade with beer bottles and the colourful Bob Marley poster was going good with the interior. Along with the decor they have collection of some quality pop music. As i entered the place I was happy to hear one of my favourite songs " Hotel California" which cheered up my mood. So brownie points for that.

Food: Coming on to the most important part which is the food. I was impressed overall. As i went in the evening I was not much hungry so I couldn't try much. This is what I had:

#BBQ Chicken Wings: Well the very famous BBQ Chicken Wings was well made and tickled my taste buds. The crispy chicken with the barbeque sauce was going well. They give you two different dips (home made mayonnaise) which are really good to have with the chicken. One thing which I felt was that the sauce was lil more sweet than what it should have been. But overall a very good
dish to try out.

#Chicken Stroganoff : This looked good and tasted better. The Chicken was very well cooked with the sauce and mushroom and tasted amazing. It was served with herb rice and garlic bread. I was impressed with the quantity as well.

Service & Hospitality: The staffs here are very friendly and cheerful. They do their job perfectly. They are attentive and always there to help you. A good sign for a restaurant.

Last Words:
Well, you doesn't need a big place to make delicious food but you definitely need big heart and great hands. And this place has both. A great place to have specially in Behala where you would rarely find good continental stuffs. The owner of the place Mr.

Okay, I went to check out this place for two reasons - one - the great reviews on Zomato and two - because there are not too many places around here which serves food like this. I did order quite a few things just to see how it all tasted. 

First came my main course - fish n chips. I am not a very big fan of fish. But, I ordered it to see how fresh it was. And the fish was fresh, perfectly cooked, served with an awesome jalapeno mayo dip and crispy fries. 

Then came the dessert. I had ordered the Crepe Suzette with Orange Juice. I don't like desserts at all. But boy was I surprised! The juice added a certain tanginess to the dessert and with the vanilla ice cream, the whole dish just made perfect sense. I could just go back there for this dessert. 
I took home the Shepherd's Pie. And it was equally yummy. I loved the taste of the sauce and it immediately lifted the dish. 

The ambiance was good. A small n trendy place with some great food and very friendly staff. All in all, a great experience and I am definitely going back there.

The location is little dodgy which makes the place more adventurous. You can't sit comfortably though & that makes it super adventurous. No complaints about wall hangings and background music.

Food- the only good thing about this place. Cheap,old country style. If you don't try their shepherds pie and mixed grill platter you're a nincompoop!

Was planning to visit this restaurant from the very beggining but atlast got the time. Went there some few days back and I ordered for only pork chops with apple glazed sauce. It was good i wont say bad but not excellent because it was not properly cooked as agreed by the cook too when I called him. Sitting arrangement is not at all comfortable which you can find very good  in Steak Factory in New Alipore. I had to complete my dinner by sitting on a small tool which was very much annoying for me.. Western music was not playing in the very beginning when i requested then they played the same. Last but not the least there is no washroom inside the restaurant.U have to go upstairs to find the same which was not expected. The behaviour of the staffs were courteous. Overall its an OK type restaurant to me. I would rather prefer Steak Factory Where I can have quality continental cuisine.

The place is a welcome change, a continental food lover's delight in the largely traditional neighborhood of Behala, when it comes to food joints. I went with my family with the primary aim of trying a bit of most things. The food is very good, special mention of the Lasagne and Grilled Fish in Lemon butter sauce. It's a small place, seating for 12-13 people, with a pretty decent ambience. Something to work upon - though not bad, I have had better Risotto and Brownie.

Like they say good things come in small packages, so does this small little place called Goin West. Located on James Long Sarani, between Chowrasta and Janakalyan. As the name suggests, they serve conti food. A much needed continental restro in Behala.

Small space, but effectively utilized and neatly decorated. Cool pictures on the wall. Caters to a small numbers of people at a time due to space crunch. Slightly loud western music playing inside the restaurant. Prices are very reasonable. Food was really good. Had a nice time there last Saturday.

Liked the Salads (Chicken and Fish). Basa tasted great. Tried Shepherd's Pie for the first time and I loved it. Would love if they could add some more meat content to the Mixed Grills.

Area of improvement: In restaurant service. I had to ask everytime to get my glass of water refilled.

Ambiance: 3.5
Service: 3.5

Update : Hunger pangs found its way again to Goin West and this time chicken stroganoff,BBQ chicken wings and sweet fresh lime soda contributed to two very happy and full tummies.BBQ chicken was finger licking good(literally) doused generously with the amazing BBQ sauce and accompanied by made from the scratch mayonnaise. Stroganoff with herb rice and garlic bread was delicious and filling for the two of us. Sweet fresh lime soda acted as a palate cleanser between the dishes. All this goodness for 380 was a darn good deal. This time we even got to meet the chef who explained to us why the mayonnaise tasted so good(generous amounts of egg white). Summed up in a line 'This is food for the soul'.So definitely coming back for more😃

I only had the mutton lasagna at this place which was really awesome.Since this place is near to my home I'm intending to try out other items slowly but steadily. 😁 The interior decor is classy but the place only seats about 14-15 people but the available space is very well managed. The portions and the price are appropriate(my boyfriend and I were moderately full from just the lasagna and the complimentary bread).The staff are very friendly and helpful and the owner is very involved in this venture as he was personally asking us all if the food was ok.Only suggestion would be if they could tie up with swiggy that would be great for when the laziness hits. 😃

A first of its type continental joint in Behala. Ordered the STICKY BBQ PORK RIBS which was unfortunately not available. So had to settle with BANGERS AND MASH & LEGENDARY FISH AND CHIPS. First came the BANGERS AND MASH which had its unique presentation & equally good taste. Next came the LEGENDARY FISH AND CHIPS which was equally good with its dip of mayonnaise but the fish could have been cooked a little more. Its a small joint but the ambience is catchy. With a little more work this place can turn out to be a gem in Behala. Will definitely go back to try their other dishes especially the STICKY BBQ PORK RIBS. Strongly recommended for all the foodies out there.

It used to be one of my favourite places to eat in kolkata!  But visited them again for their special menu in durga puja.... i think due to the rush, they could not handle it.... hence the flavours werent that good this time.... or maybe they were just understaffed or too much waiting list or some other reason....
I hope they can work on it and bring their old finesse back!
Not to do them injustice, because this was just one bad experience in a few very good ones,
Pls read my old review....
The food amazing and the staff super cordial. we had hot buffalo wing, fish salad chicken ala kiev (they make their own mayonnaise!!!) And grilled fish with herbed rice.... each and every thing was yummmmm and the experience was amazing! and added bonus is the ambience and music!

Behala Chowrasta is a very busy area when it comes to travelling or reaching some destination. No space to move ahead, all that heat and humidity is bound to make to gibberish and grumpy until you find a knight in shining armour around the corner. Located bang opposite to Samar Ray Choudhury Park on James Long Sarani, the place won't be very hard to find.  As you pass through the gate and climb the narrow stairs, realising that the place might feel a lill cramped or perhaps the ambience a tad too dull, you are greeted by the smiling host which is the best refreshment. With hunger in our stomach we took the seats and focused on what to dine. The seats were a bit small for both us pitty husband & wife but perfect for my kid. This needs immediate action buoy. Ordered BBQ Chicken Wings, Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce, Grilled Chicken, Spaghetti Ala Bolognaise, Penne in Cheesy Alfredo Sauce and Fresh Lime Soda. Preparations takes a bit of time, thanks to their aim of not serving precooked food (no puns intended) and we are absolutely ok with this approach. It was pretty late in the evening so the tables were lone. But this wait was worthy when we finally saw the wooden plank coming right towards us. Obviously being carried by someone.Chomping through the Chicken wings, you realise that it hits the spot almost perfectly and a must try if you are here. The perfect blend of well cooked flesh and sauces. Umm so good!!!! Coming to the grilled fish, the sauce was a bit bitter may be due to overcooking of the lime. But then you take a slice from the fish and find it absolutely fresh, juicy and most of all tender. Perhaps a lill more attention on the consistency would have gone miles but nevertheless a decent preparation minus the initial feeling. Post that our Spaghetti comes in. You take in the aroma and imbibe the experience and start to hog. Couple of bites later you realise that your plate was empty. We needed a bit more of the quantity. But ordering another plate would have been too much. May be by inflating the prices a bit you may look at increasing the quantity by another 25%. The grilled chicken was well cooked and the herbed rice was just cooked to perfection. Uff what a smell. It actually acts as an appetizer and you look forward to push your limits. My son was very happy with the penne in alfredo sauce and to our surprise he had tried all the food we had ordered which he seldom does. The soda was a bit flat and so were we. Over all the place is more than a decent pick with limited variety of menu serving enough things to tingle your imagination. This approach is good as adding too many items in the menu just lightens your specializations. Just a few things to improve like the seats and the quantity, otherwise ALL IS WELL... A visit to this place is a must if you are in the vicinity. A beer would be highly appreciated along with their culinary spread. Cheers to my long time inspiration and brother Sayantan. We are proud of you.

Though a very small place but very neatly done up 
Could never imagine it would serve some great continental items at such reasonable prices and that too in Behala 
Though we tried a few items only so far namely chicken in thousand island sauce cheese chicken crouquets  loaded potatoes (non veg) and grilled chicken with herb rice All were yummy 
Will look forward to go there soon to try other dishes too and the deserts
Wish keep it up and maintain the standard and quality being served now
I was surprised that the proprietor himself oversees and helps cooking dishes and takes feedback from customers which is quite rare

I heard about this from 2-3 friends of mind and read a lot about it in zomato but inspite of leaving within 5mnts distance i cudnt make the time for it...now first thing first the decor;they have utilised the space so well and has done a really quircky and edgy interior...the bright red color immidiately pops up your mind and the small frames and the lighting really makes the mood!Now lets come to the menu they have made a supper tempting menu but for that reason u can totttalllyyy get confused as to wat to order and what not to...and now that we have summed up our order after a long war its Chicken and Cheese Croquettes, Penne Pasta in alfredo sauce and last but not the least Lemon Chicken in Butter Sauce...The croquettes were crispy from outside and cheesy and gooeyy from inside...mammamia it was melting in my mouth and the mayo sauce was just finger licking..now the pasta it was creamyyy properly spiced and with loads of chicken and bell peppers and mushrooms but the show stopper was The Fish Omggg guys every one should try it atleast for once and breads that tgy served accompanying the dishes were so flavourful and buttery and toasty ummm...loved it...and lastly the behaviour the owner cum the chef of this place is an utter gentleman with immense talent...their service their behaviour was just on point...too good..they even replaced our cold food warmed it though it was our fault...everyone in kolkata should atleast one time go and visit this place and lastly the price its like that quotient which helped this place to raise its bar and stand out amidst of thousands of this kinda places...already planning for next visit😉

A much needed continental joint in Behala, hats off for this one bold move. Interacted with Sayantan (the owner/founder), he is knowledgeable and passionate, two most essential features required in this industry. The chelo kebab was mindblowing, so was the apple glazed pork chops. I'm sure this is the first of my innumerable visits to come, if the same quality prevails. Usually these kind of joints are common in the US, great to see such concepts evolving here. Gallant effort, wish you all the best!!

The name itself grabbed my attention.
Location- It is located on James Long Sarani, just opposite to Samar RoyChowdhury Park. 

Ambience- The ambience was quite nice. It can accomodate 15-16 people. 

Food- We had ordered Fish in lemon honey sauce and lasagne. The fish was really good. One must surely try it. But the Lasagne was a bad choice. It was filled with cheese and mutton. Though the cheesy part was good but we couldn't have the mutton. It was stinking. So that was the bad part.

Being a resident of Behala...it took me by surprise to find such a gem of a restaurant so close to my place...size doesn't matter...nor does the brand name.....the food is all that matters here and it's outstanding....to say the least...I was never too fond of continental...but now I am a self confessed fan..please try their shepherds pie..it's yummy. I had rissotto, chilly meat n wafers, shepherds pie and brownie with icecream... All of them tasted excellent...the place is small but nicely done....the garnishing was good too..its strongly recommended to all foodies.

A FIRST OF ITS KIND OF FOOD JOINT IN BEHALA,SERVING A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL DISHES WHICH ARE FIRST IN BEHALA.
THE PLACE IS SMALL BUT WELL LAID OUT,COULD HAVE WORKED SOMETHING ON THE STAIRCASE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE.
NOW THE FOOD WHAT WE ORDERED AND HOW IT WAS
GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD IN THOUSAND ISLAND- A WELL MIXED SALAD WITH SUMPTUOUS QUANTITY OF GRILLED CHICKEN AND PASTA.MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS WHEN IT IS NAMED THOUSAND ISLAND THERE MUST BE SOME ADDITION OF TOMATO KETCHUP.
CHILLY MEAT AND WAFERS- GOOD CONCEPT AND VERY NICELY COOKED MINCED MEAT.
GRILLED FISH IN LEMON BUTTER-JUST AWESOME
PORK CHOPS IN APPLE SAUCE-BOTH PREPARATION AND PORTION SIZE WAS GOOD.
PENNE IN ALFREDO SAUCE-WELL PREPARED PASTA ,BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER KEEPING IN MIND THE FOOD STANDARD OF THE RESTAURANT.
WE HAD ALL THESE WITH SOFT DRINKS FOR MERELY RS.1000.TRULY UNBELIEVABLE.
WISH TO VISIT AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR A GOOD INTERNATIONAL MEAL SO NEAR MY HOUSE.

Goin west is an awesome place to chill out with friends for some delicious Conti & Italian dishes..
Although the facade is not fascinating but after you enter the place you will realize that the owner had efficiently utilized the small place with great decor. Simple and neat!

Had tried a few delicacies..Mutton lasagne was out of the box and a mouth watering dish, and would definitely not forget to mention the Mixed Grills which was quite impressive. Now the Apple glazed pork chops and the chelo kabab was upto the mark along with fresh lime soda!!

However going west has a few field to make it all the more great experience..
Even though everything is managed well, the chairs could have been a bit more comfy and also the fresh lime soda could have been more refreshing..

Okay, so that's all I needed to express about Goin West.
Keep up the great move (y) :)

Walk towards chowrasta from Janakalyan and James long crossing you will get this place. It's located at the 1st floor of the adjacent building of hot chips. To start with a nice cozy place which can accommodate approximately 14 to 16 people at once. Not much on the menu but whatever is there it's crisp and compact. Food is good (but the fish and chips could have been better) and their presentation is excellent. Pocket pinch is low and I am looking forward to visit this place again.

Located at James long sarani, near Samar Roy Chowdhury Park, this place can easily be claimed as a hidden gem for its awesome delicacies. The space inside is small and congested, but that's the only con of this place. The interior decor will simply leave you in a state of wonder, for the innovation that is applied. The photos, the signage used in the wall, the lights, the tables & chairs, and yes, the ultimate showstopper- The central ceiling light made with beer bottle, together exudes a completely different and innovative charm that anybody will love to experience.
And with very limited service staffs, the restaurant provides prompt service and every service person comes with a smiling face. And the best part, the owner himself takes part actively in the internal operations starting  from kitchen to serving the guests, along with his service team. Mr. Sayantan Bose, a charming young man with an elegant personality is the director of this restaurant, and his friendliness with guests is something that is worth learning. "So if you, are reading this Mr. Bose, please take a bow. You are just doing an amazing job."
Coming to food, its excellent, and finger licking delicious. Even there is an application of innovative thought in serving the food also-over a wooden plank. 
And if you're a meat lover, this place is heaven for you. Should strongly recommend all the foodies out there.

The usp of this restaurant is 'food, food and food'. When you have a food lover cum certified chef who is a bengali, you know , you cant be wrong in choosing the place...my personal favourite - Shepherd's pie but if i have to wear a critics hat, i am sure, i will be most confused man to do that job...each and every dish has a personal touch ...the ambience, music and the serving is definitely unique which needs mentioning.. the price? Visit to believe the cut in your pocket...you are full in less than what you pay your OLA driver...

James Long Sarani had coffee places, Chinese restaurants as well as restaurants that serve Bengali and North Indian cuisines. Goin West adds a new flavour here by introducing Continental, American and Italian Cuisines at a very affordable price. But if one is expecting the food to be equivalent in taste and quality to what is served in other lavish Continental Restaurants you won't be entertained. The restaurant can accommodate up to 12 people possibly and had Bob Marley and Poets of the Fall playing in the background. It's small, quirky and pocket friendly and will surely be a hit among the school and college students. So, if you are around Behala and bored of eating the same old Biriyani, Chilli Chicken and Rolls, give this place a try. :)

"Goin west " -- A newly established resto in Behala for mouth watering Continental, American & Italian dishes. A place where people can be rest assured about the quality and the majestic taste of the food. The food was tempting & appetizing, especially the Fish in parsley sauce, Chelo kebab & certainly Mutton lasagna. 

Now, the entrance might not and maybe just won't attract people towards the resto but once you step inside your thoughts will change in a second as the place has been really embellished with simple, but eye catching materials and you will surely admire the interior and its quite awe-inspiring.

Also, I must add that after being there I felt like hospitality and generosity is a tradition of that place.Hence, I would finish ( after a long explanation :P ) by saying that I really loved being there and would also recommend people to visit there and would visit again myself with my companions.

The food is pretty good but the place is way too small. The chef can't manage a large party sadly. We were 5 not too large a party and he could only send in one dish at a time. I guess it'll be better for ordering in. We had 5 main courses among the party but still went home hungry. The food that we had was pretty good though.

A small Precise menu but every single item hits your tastebuds precisely. 
The only downer is the small shantytown entrance, otherwise the hosts are very warm as the bbq chicken wings, we had for starters. The marination of bbq sauce was pinpoint cent percent. Next we ordered The Stroganoff preparation of Chicken, with a full complement of Herb rice and toast to go with the house choice mayonnaise, which itself deserves acclaim on its own. 

Heading to previous Reviewers advice i tok the Pork  chops, which didnt disappoint one bit. 

 All in all the price to quality ratio is UNBELIEVABLE.

Continental comes to Behala!!

A breath of fresh air is what Goin West has added to Behala's fast evolving restro scene. A nice name and amber lights, this is what had initially drawn me to this tiny eatery on the second floor of a shop, bang at the Janakalyan Crossing.
But oh boy! I was in for a "meaty" surprise! Sayantan the owner took two minutes to make me feel at home, and promised me that he would fight tooth and nail if need be, but never ever remove pork items from the menu. An ambitious claim but nevertheless one that I want to be true. And then, well his chef and the food spoke for itself.

Location: Convenient. Parking might be a bit of an issue, nothing major.

Space: A huge letdown. Very very tiny. But still the owner has done a decent job in lining up cute tables and chairs, a bit of space issue comes to notice, yes, but then who cares, it's the food that matters.

Ambience and Staff: Amber lighting to small travel pics, retro English songs to a miniature motorcycle, the ambience is just brilliant. Very well mannered staff. Harry is being missed though. Enjoying your food while old man Harry talking with you about lamb chops and prime cuts was well, sheer pleasure.

Menu: Oh boy! U name continental, they have it. Fish chicken mutton pork lamb. The answer is always yes. Sheppard's pie to sausages, they have it all. Scotch eggs are available on pre order.

Food: The winner they say, takes it all. Goin west just doesn't impress with their food, they inspire. Have tasted 7dishes from their menu as of yet. The Sloppy Joe burger, Fish in parsley sauce and Mix meat platter wins hands down! Go guys get a bite. And yes, you can thank me later. :)

Here's wishing Goin West a lot of success in the days to come. Ignore the name Goin West. Don't go to any other direction. Head straight South and into Goin west. Trust me. Continental breathes here! Cheers! :)

Honestly, am slightly disappointed. After going through the reviews here in Zomato, I had a lot of expectations. But the overall experience wasn't that good for me. This little small, cute and quirky cafe is located at the first floor or a building and is situated exactly opposite to the children park at Jana Kalyan. Finding the building is pretty easy owing to the signboard which has been put up in front of the same.

The gate leads to a narrow lane and then some really steep stairs to the first floor. As soon as you push hard the stiff door, you enter into a small and lively atmosphere. The cafe has been designed quite elegantly. There is a shortage of space as is evident once you enter here but the owner has been successful in making good use of the space. The color combination of the wall is nice and really catches your eyes. Matching the walls, the photo frames too manages to strike your attention. Some really wonderful pictures and cheeky quotes.

The cafe was vacant when I entered but gradually two other groups followed me. To mention here, the small chairs, no matter how sweet they might look is a real pain to sit upon for long hours. I asked for the menu card and decided to go for a Sweet Lime Soda (Fresh) and Pork Chops. The soda was the first to arrive. Not mentioning the incomplete drink which was made the first time, even when it came back 'completed' the soda didn't taste good. The lemon had gone sour and the drink wasn't mixed well. Although the quantity was sufficient in comparison to the price, the drink was prepared by an inexperienced hand rather than a professional.

Next to come was the pork chops. Beautifully decorated, three wonderful chops of pork, put upon a bed of mash. The decoration was wonderful and the food was presented extremely well. However, I felt the size of the wooden block, upon which the chops were served was way too large in comparison to chops and hence the chops may just look way smaller in size. Coming to the pork, they were a complete disaster. The chops themselves had the right amount of ingredients but the meat was way way too hard to be handled by simple knife and fork. I had to give up my cutlery and dirty my hands to dig in to the chops. Not only me, the group which was sitting next to me had also asked for chops and they too couldn't manage themselves with the quality of meat which was served to them. The entire dish, no matter wonderfully it was done, no matter how tasty the mash was, everything got spoiled due to the over-cooking of the meat.

In the meantime I had ordered for some items to be packed up. This was again a scenario for disappointment. It took nearly an hour to prepare three simple dishes. Even though they had 3-4 other dishes to be prepared to cater to some other people, if the cooks are not able to handle such little orders in a short time, they would really struggle if some day the cafe runs full!

The take-away order comprised of the following:

BBQ Chicken Wings:- Extremely soggy, little hint of BBQ Sauce. As if everything had faded away into this air. Even if the sauce was there, it didn't pack a punch. Had to keep the dish away.

Cheese & Chicken Croquettes: Very Very less of Cheese and Chicken and way more of Potato filling. More to the ratio of 1:50, if I may say. It was more like a traditional 'Alur Bora' with a different shape and size and little hint of some small chicken pieces. 

Cocktail Sausages & Fries:- Small piece of sausages, again tossed in some sauce, unknown to my knowledge. It had a slightly sour taste and lacked the tangy flavor which is must for BBQ Sauce.

I appreciate the recent endeavour to kickstart a Continental venture in a locality which sees less of such projects. However, owing to the size and location constraints, I am not sure if trying to venture into fine dining and classy presentations is what the area needs right now. Instead, I would be more interested to come here again and again, if the quantity served exceeds the price charged for the same. Also, the quality needs to be notched, way up and above!

I have seen multiple dishes served in front of my to other guests. All of them were wonderfully presented but none of them appeared to me to be sufficient enough to feed a hungry appetite. Also, considering the fact that I have had succulent pork elsewhere earlier this week at a comparable price range, the entire saga of mine was more disappointing than I would have had liked it to be happier!

First and foremost thanks to zomato for helping me find out such a classy restaurant nearby my college and made my sudden plan for a dinner accomplished. It was a great experience having true European and American dishes.

Review:
Pros- food was remarkable specially the item Bangers and Smash and Pork Ribs.Service and delivery was good, relaxing music, ambience was pretty cool.
Cons: Sitting arrangements should be modified, the chairs were not comfortable to sit for a longer period of time. Should come up with mocktails and few more desserts.

Really happy to find out this little eatery with American/Conti cuisine in Behala serving good food and at the same time pocket friendly. One will not be impressed with the entrance of this place but once you step inside the restaurant you wont be that disappointed. Though a very small place, but they have tried there best to create a nice and suave ambiance with bright paints and nice wall hangings.

Coming to food..we ordered BBQ Chicken Wings, Chicken Stroganoff and Grilled Chicken with herbed rice with mashed potato...The food was delicious...crispy chicken wings, nicely grilled chicken and even the flavor of the herbed rice was good. The quantity served was perfect. Will surely visit again to try out the other preparations.

Visited the place on a sunday evening to chill out with friends . Upon entering the restuarant i was quite impressed , the space had beautifully utilised , although its not spacious but it feels very comfortable.We ordered Chicken parmigiana , mutton lasagne and mixed grill platter and no sooner the food arrived i understood this was going to be great .Mutton lasagne was the best i have ever had , it was just melting in my mouth it was over in minutes . The mixed grill platter was impressive and chicken parmigiana was a delight , i never thought i would get such quality food ever in that neighbourhood.
Cheers to them , your running a great place keep it up.

First of all I wanna thank Sayantan for being so nice and courteous .. probably that's the reason his foods tasted so heavenly. Just ordered a few items for my friends and he was kind enough to deliver them at my place in person. Ordered two portions of pork chops; chicken wings in Buffalo style and cocktail sausage with french fries. The chops were moist and juicy (preferred the tangy spicy barbecue sauce) with the right amount of fat and the creamy mashed potato on top it tasted so good that my friends cursed him for being the reason of gaining weight. The chicken wings were overly tender, almost mushy, spicy but not hot and tasted good .. however missed the crispiness, maybe it was over saturated with the red sauce used, however it was equally tasty. Sorry couldn't say anything about the cocktail sausages since it flew off before I could lay my hands on them. Also we were surprised to find that the home made dips can be so tasty and flavorful. To infer, I can say Goin west is well worthy of our bellies, American food of the highest order and thanks for serving the swine population in Behala. Wish you success and excellence... Highly recommended.

It has been quite sometime that I honestly wanted to pen down my thoughts on my visit to " Goin West". Here goes....!! We were a group of 6 and in lieu of celebrating my brother's birthday we chose to visit this awesome place that was on my mind for sometime now.

The decor is really nice and cozy, created with utmost passion keeping in mind the comfort for a couple or chaos for friends gathering. It has quite a few Trump cards up it's sleeve..like light bulbs amidst a cluster of Tuborg bottles ( it's just for decor people...do not get ideas that liquor is available too ;) ) or be it small bar stools to give the look of a traditional yet funky restaurant. Brightly lit to the point that it doesn't hurt your eyes in a combination of yellow and red paint, two colors that stimulate hunger! Very well thought I must say.

We ordered (for 6):
Cheese and Chicken Croquettes - 2 portions
Shepherd's Pie - 2 portions
Fish n Chips - 2 portions
Apple Glazed Pork and Chicken Strogonauff - 1 portion each.

We ate like there was no tomorrow. Each item was just out of the pot,smoking hot and equally salivating. When we bite into the "Croquettes" u get the creamyness of the cheese wrapped in minced chicken in every bite. Duely accompanied with tomato ketchup and mustard mayonnaise sauce. The upper crust was flaky and fried to perfection. 

Next in line was Shepherd's Pie and mind it yanna rascallas it's MUTTON. You would hardly find a Calcutta based restaurant giving away mutton Shepherd's pie, it's mostly chicken that you get all around. It was served and was meant to turn you into a glutton. It was that amazing.

The star of the show was the " Strogonauff " and the succulent Pork. They were like a movie starring SRK and Salman. The glaze of Apple sauce and the combo of pork was too good to be true but it was worth it nonetheless. 

Last but not the least, the fish n chips- fried to perfection and battered to glory. Accompanied by French fries and ketchup with a dash of lemon on top...perfecto!

I don't know about the rest...I am definitely coming back Mr.Bose!

~~A delightful addition to the evolving diaspora of restaurants in Behala.~~Located on JL Sarani, opposite the children's park at Janakalyan. The eatery is on the second floor of the building, look up and you cannot miss the glow sign.Don't be deceived by the shabby entrance, the interiors are more welcoming. ~~Goin West brings the party home for continental food lovers in Behala. It packs quite a diverse menu with and absolute blessing for the Pork lovers who were deprived in Behala for so long.The decor gives pub themed at-home feeling carrying good taste in music. ~~Had the Sticky BBQ Pork Ribs, Apple glazed Pork Chops, and Warm Brownie with Vanilla Ice-Cream.The Pork Ribs are lean pork meat soaked in the savory BBQ sauce. Tasty.Fresh lime soda and the Brownie with Ice-Cream meets your standard expectations.The Pork Chops are to DIE FOR. Any classic swine lover digs the fat on his meat and GW does not compromise one damn bit on that. The fatty pork meat partnered with the sweet apple sauce is a total delight to your taste buds. I had it twice and the second time they even customized the chops with BBQ sauce on our request. ~~PORK LOVERS in Kolkata must try this place out. A little chat with the friendly owner is an add-on. :)~~A few suggestions.Some essentials are needed in the cutlery. The struggle with Pork Chops without a knife is incomprehensible.Good food takes good time. Prompt service in time is desired but, never compromise in the required finishing.Add more Bacon in the menu. :D~~All the best for this lovely venture. Will keep visiting and recommending.See you soon.PS: Sorry for a late review. :P

An exclusive conti joint in Behala is something exciting. Apart from many teething issues, the service is on the sloppy side. Even a mismatch with menu wasn't replaced and full value was charged.  Food was good. The overall experience was somewhat below average.

It is my 3rd outing at this joint...Today on the auspicious day of Naboborsho I decided to start the new year on a high..Well what do I say! I am overwhelmed..I was treated like a King..The owner Sayantan Da being there was the icing on the cake..I was spoilt for choices..Coming to the food..
Chicken Parmisiano - Amazingly delectable..sides on the dish like Spaghetti and Salad were too good..The hero of the dish that fillet of chicken stuffed and fried..the cheese and minced meat..Oshadharon !!

Shepherd's Pie - Too good..Minced meat..mashed potato..baked cheese..garlic bread..Waah!

Grilled Chicken Salad - Great..Ma loved it..And Me too..

Ginger Mojito was nice too.. Also try their pizzas,mixed grill and other delectables..

Hope in this new year Goin West blossoms even more...Wish u all the success..Thank You Sayantan Da..I will be back soon :) 

Visited yet again yesterday...a place home away from homr...Had their special pujo menu...Devilled crab in eggs..Por roasted Pork,The star of the show "Mermaid" and Jack Daniels Chocolate Brownie...All of it was splendidly prepped and served...Sayantan Da being there always helps...Thank you and have a Great Pujo and year ahead :)

Wonderful ambience n delicious food. The place is really cozy n i along with my relatives spent a lovely evening there on my birthday. For what's on offer it's surprisingly very light on the pocket... Although am not from in or around behala, I don't mind traveling the distance to visit again. Thumbs up to the initiative from me n my taste buds.

Having found a continental restaurant in Behala Chowrasta, I wanted to dine here ever since I had seen this place. Finally, we visited Goin West on Valentine's Day and Yes! They really made us feel special with the awesome food, games and gifts!
To begin with we had Barbq Chicken Wings which were crispy and tasty. For the mains, we had Apple Glazed Pork Chops and Chelo Kabab. Both the dishes were sumptuous and delicious.
Thank you for the awesome time that we spent here! We loved it and would like to visit AGAIN!

The restaurant is located in a small cosy place which immediately on entering gives off a wonderful friendly vibe.. The staffs who are also co-owners greet you immediately and make you very comfortable.. The food is prepared really well and the owner being involved with it adds a personal touch to it all.. And to top it all the food they serve is really well plated and way easy on the pocket.. I would 100% recommend this place to one and all.. You'll be missing out big time if you don't pay this place a visit..

A loved the food, service, decor and the small cards on every table..the orange flavoured crepe is a must try...and the cocktail pork sausages was mouth watering. It is a small place but beautifully utilized...hats off to come up with such a new idea.

A new western restaurant in the locality, I was all excited, plus a good review(the few that were available at zomato), took me to this place. This is a place with shady entrance, small sitting area with small uncomfortable chairs, but a good looking menu and ambience. The ordered food had smelly cheese, pizza had stale breads with thick crust and the brownie was more of a chocolate pastry from mio amore or Kathleen. A complete disappointment.

Before writing anything about this restaurant I humbly want to salute the owner who dreamt about it and went a step forward to achieve it. Now coming to the ambience I would say its a small place accommodating 16 guests but the decor is really catchy with yellow walls and paintings & shelves hanging around. Really gives a warm feeling. The menu is card surely an eye catcher. Opening a purely continental restaurant in this area surely needs a lot of guts specially when people can only think of Indianised Chinese and biryani when they want to eat out. The presentation of each and every item they serve is wonderful. We ordered chicken n cheese croquettes  and buffaloed chicken wings for starters. Just a little complain about the croquettes. It contained more of potato than chicken n cheese however, the chicken wings were just  perfect. For mains we ordered parsley fish which was just awesome, apple glazed pork chops were just delicious, barbequed pork ribs were too good, shepherds pie tasted heavenly and chelo kebab which was commendable and fresh lime soda which was OK. The homemade mustard mayo & barbeque mayo were actually finger-licking good. I only have one complain. All the dishes contained too much mashed potato ( though tasted good) but a small suggestion is that..instead of mashed potatoes mashed peas or boiled n sautés veggies could be added in some of the dishes. Overall it's a great experience and I am surely going back to taste the mixed grill which was not available that day. All the best :)

The only thing this food joint  lacks is sufficient space.A continental hub like this should have a much bigger dining with plenty of seats.It is perfectly designed and decorated,there's no complain about it.The food is delicious.The hospitality and service is overwhelming.The prices are too cheap unlike any other continental restaurants,which is a big plus point in accordance to its location.Given that the price,taste,quality and service is maintained or updated in due course of time,this place then has a future to compete with any other restaurants in its vicinity or even in the city..

The moment we entered into the restaurant, it gave us a soothing ambiance. The walls are well decorated with nice colour and pictures. Nice Dining Table, cute chairs.. nice hanging lights. Awesome music inside. So I loved it. Now comes to the food,  Grilled Fish 5 Star. Chicken wings with the white house made sauce 5 star. Garlic bread must to have if anyone visits. Overall Great Job Goin West!!!!!

I came here for a 31st night dinner with my wife and friends after reading the amazing reviews on Zomato. As soon as you come in you are greeted with attentive well groomed staff. With 16 covers the restaurant isn't huge, but it's warm and cosy inside, and you aren't rushed out. In fact we stayed for 2 hours nattering and eating and didn't feel under pressure to leave at all. 

A small but interesting menu with music softly playing in the background. We enjoyed a delicious meal in this very cosy restaurant which consisted of really well cooked  hot wings in Buffalo style followed by fish in parsley sauce, amazing apple glazed Pork chops,  sticky BBQ pork ribs, shepherd's pie and fresh lime. 

Starters & mains were superb. 
Fresh lime, and here's my issue, were not fizzy. But the cooking, flavours and hand crafted sauces  were exquisite. 

Overall an massive YES
We will be back.

To celebrate the Christmas Eve nothing would have been a better place than Goin West. The ambience is subtle and romantic. The hospitality is mind blowing. Food is awesome. All in all Goin West is the first and the only conti joint in south Kolkata. I can easily avoid the long queue of park street restaurants and have my favourite dishes. Thank you Goin West.

My Bae is here.
The journey of a guy opening what we do not expect in Behala is Goin West in other words. Want me to be a little simple? Well the 'Edo goli's' of Behala clearly deserved a continental and European delight like this. We ordered Apple glazed Pork chops,Fish in parsley sauce,Chicken strogonoff,A penne in cheese sauce another starter in pork served with fries. They are pro's in pork dishes. I am a fish lover I loved the basa soft and tender💙
My taste buds shall always put continental and Chinese before Indian and mughlai. I don't have to travel to some mall or park street anymore for these food. It's just minute's away.
And Dear owner that complimentary smoked bacon was amazing.

Spent a very good evening during Christmas at Going West with family. The ambience of the joint literally charmed me. Special mention goes to the hospitality of the owners and the lady who gave us a warm reception..
An ideal place for enjoying your leisure and food as well. We had lip smacking continental dishes which probably is going to make waves in south Kolkata. 
One must try and experience the Italian & European dishes as well having 5star quality with reasonable price tags.

The development on J L Sarani, has put a step forward through this initiative. The continental main course has completely overwhelmed me . The polite gesture of the chef cum owner, and the hospitable service needs a special mention.
We dined on the Apple glazed pork chops and the Sticky BBQ pork ribs. The fat on the pork chops and the preparation was indeed lip smacking. The herb rice served along is good and new to me.
The  Sticky BBQ Pork ribs was delicious, however, a little fat on the ribs could have added more delight for us.
We ended with Brownie with ice cream which too was really nice.
With a complete new decor and a pub-like menu display, this place is really amazing.

I grew up watching the western flicks so the name Goin' West caught my attention and made me curious. So, I decided to visit this newly opened restaurant sans my cowboy hat. On entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is very well decorated with nice photo frames on the wall (really liked the Rocky Balboa one). What caught my attention was the big black board which had the menu inscribed on it in yellow color. The red and yellow colors on the walls give the place a vibrant look. Also, the sitting arrangement is nicely done and they play some really good music. 

Now coming to the best part. THE FOOD IS AWESOME. We ordered for the Cheese and Chicken Croquettes and Apple glazed pork chops. Both the dishes were lip smacking good. The wooden trays on which they serve the food were really a very unique thing and the homemade mayonnaise tasted great. I simply loved it.  Mr. Chef, hats off. You nailed it. The staffs at the restaurant are very cordial. In short, we had a fantastic experience. We will again visit this place pretty soon and gorge on the excellent food items. 

Mr. Chef, Merry Christmas. My best wishes are with you. Cheers to good food...cheers to life.

Continental Food in Behala! 
Goin West is something which Behala has not seen before and its a pleasant change from the regular Indian, Chinese and Mughlai food that we get here. 

Let not the location fool you, for when you enter Goin West, it won't feel like Behala anymore! The interiors have been creatively put together with bright red and yellow walls lined with pop culture images. The rock and pop music along with the whole setup makes the ambiance very westernized.

I was specially pleased with the over sized wood frame menu which as impressive as it was to read,  was also very out of the box to look at as well!

We ordered Chicken and Cheese Croquettes, Apple glazed pork chops and soft drinks.

The Chicken and Cheese Croquettes were good, void of any grease and pleasant to taste. Although a little more cheese is always welcome! Their homemade mayo dips, like honey mustard, tartar and barbecue , are fresh and fantastic! What I really loved about this dish was the way it was presented, on an all wooden plank!

I don't eat red meat, but going by my partner's expressions, the Apple glazed Pork Chops hit a home run. He said the dish was exactly the way he liked it, soft, tender meat with just the right amount of sweetness.

The mashed potatoes served with both the dishes were delicious and in just about the right quantity too. I usually end up wasting more than half of mashed potatoes at other continental restaurants because they always serve too much. 

The pricing is very affordable and the service is efficient and courteous. We also struck up a conversation with the owner who seemed very passionate about his new beginning. 

Over the last couple of years, Behala has slowly turned into an 'eat street' with a number new places which have opened up on the James Long Sarani stretch, and we are very glad for Goin West as we can now boast of continental food being available here. Now I wont have to go all the way to Quest mall or Park street for an Ala Kiev, Stroganoff or Fish and Chips. I could just walk to Goin West!
 
I feel (and hope) the food, ambiance and the total concept of Goin West is here to stay in Behala. We are looking forward to go back soon.

If you are looking for some pure European food on a chilled evening in Kolkata, you must visit this newly opened restaurant "Goin West". Fortunately I was there on the opening day eve.
The ambiance is cozy with good sitting arrangements, nice decoration, light soothing music, smiling faced people around you who will help you to select what should you try out from the menu,
Now coming to the food., we tried Cheese and Chicken Croquettes & Apple glazed pork chops (as suggested by them), and both items were awesome. 
I am really looking forward to visit there again to try out some more amazing foods.
And like to wish Goin West all the very best for the coming days
Carry on your good job!!

Delighted to be a part of the opening night at GOIN WEST! I found myself at an extraordinary position of being the first guest at this new restaurant. And thus I feel somewhat vaguely responsible to set the ball in motion hopefully in a direction that will not only benefit this new joint to get better but also encourage the foodies to make an informed decision.
Let's break this down:
Cuisine - Western, hardcore. Master chef, who is also the owner, knows his job. When you savour the food you'll know he didn't get his hotel management degree from Bihar. *sorry, I love Biharis otherwise*

Food - if you order Scotch Egg for starters you won't go wrong. Minced meat and bacon wrapped egg with an array of dips might just make your eyes pop out! 
Wife ordered Apple Glazed Pork Ribs, she has a thing with pigs. She finds them irresistible though deep down she loves me. The pork had the perfect pink, the kind of pink that makes your eyes close as you chew. 
I went with Fish in Parsley Sauce, and it took me less than 5mins to lap it up! Soft basha with seasoned rice. And some garlic bread on the side.
We were full, but then she says not ordering dessert is a sin. Just one Crepes in Orange Sauce. And it was almost gone before the second spoon arrived. She thought it's an Instagram material! I liked the fact it wasn't too sweet and the presence of orange zest made it authentic!

Decor - red and yellow. The owner chose the colour to make it bright. I however read an article somewhere that says, yellow and red are colours that tickles the hunger hormones in humans, a reason why big food chains like McDonald's, Burger King etc. go with those colours. He made a bright choice indeed!
It's a relatively small joint. Not more than 20 people can fit at one point, so go early. The walls have plenty to look at. It would be nice to sit facing the windows with an ocean view, but can't blame them for not digging up Behala. 

Cost - approx 800 for two people. Point is, the variety you get at this budget is very limited and this is perhaps their USP. It would be perfect for couples living on pocket money. 

Honestly there's plenty to improve, and I've had the opportunity to share some of my "pearls of wisdom" directly with the owner, who also happens to be my friend.
I firmly believe that words of encouragement to  any new entrepreneur does have a larger impact on overall improvement. "Nothing is permanent in this wicked world" not even a good review.
I plan to return to see if they're GOIN GREAT... I certainly hope they do.
Good luck to the businessman and Best Wishes to a friend who's living out his dream.
