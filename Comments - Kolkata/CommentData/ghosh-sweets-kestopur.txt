Excellent quality sweets at great price. Very delicious. I am especially fond of Rabri and doi. Sandesh is also very good. May add baked rosogolla and mihidana to their menu.

It is one of the best sweet shops in keshtopur. For people living in saltlake and baguiati too, this sweet shop will be the best one for them as their is hardly any sweet shop which can compete with it. The variety of sweets is enormous. The quality is just awesome. Some of the best sweets available here are ROSOGOLLA, KOMOLABHOG, KALAKAND, CHOM CHOM. The best spicy snack here is KOCHURI and RADHABALLABHI. The curry given with these items is just lip smacking. NIMKI is also available here which is tasty. The price here is also quite reasonable compared to some costly sweet shops like Haldirams or Bhikharam. In one word this sweet shop is just AWESOME.
