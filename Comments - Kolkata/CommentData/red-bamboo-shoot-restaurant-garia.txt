Situated near garia haater-bazar more, on boral main road. Its a humble south asian restaurant. Medium spaced with simple decor. Their food is quite indo chinese taste wise. We ordered creamy tom yum chicken soup, barbeque chicken, authentic chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken and kiwi soda mocktail. Quantity wise good but i found the foods were quite overpowered with gravies & sauces. Unlike authentic chinese the foods were a bit spiced. Even the kiwi mocktail was overly sweet. Apart from that its a reasonably priced and staff's are all well mannered. Its a good food joint in this locality.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to other people. Went there multiple times. Food was tasty,¬† waiters behaved nicely.¬† We tried the chicken wonton fry, RBS special fried rice and chicken kung pao. It's hard to find the fault with any of these dishes.¬†¬†
The only negative I was to say is that I wish there were larger parking space.

This restaurant is located close to my home.I ordered Mixed meifoon, Crab curry, Burnt Garlic Mixed rice and Chilly chicken. Overall the quantity was good but the meifoon and rice was under salted and tasted dull. The crab on the other hand was worth a try. Chicken was also good.
Negative Points - The rice and chowmein was some what tasteless.

Spacious, well located.
Well behaved staff.
Food quality and quantity is okay type.

Negative Points:

1) I was there with my nephew who is 4years old and we got a decent place to sit but the table was too high for him and we were looking for a high chair, one of the waiter got one for us, but another one told "hey that is not for this kid, it is for baby only". So we had to adjust by making him stand while eating the food.

2) I got a wire in the noodles that I ordered. The guy who came to clear the leftovers and dishes, I told him, he promptly said "why u didn't tell me, we could have redo that item for u!" That was indeed a good gesture but I would have preferred if I got the noodles wire free in the first go only.

One of my favorite restaurant. Have been here multiple times and tried mocktail, golden fried prawn, noodles, Cantonese chicken etc. Today my mom brought mix meifoon and one chicken item (sorry dnt know the name of this dish it could be Kung pao chicken I guess) from this restaurant. Come to the first dish mixed meifoon it was taste normal like any other small restaurant nothing special but the chicken item was excellent well prepared, soft with tender meat (10 pieces). Overall oke üëç looking for better next time. Happy Diwali üòÄ

Both the rice and kung pao chicken was delicious, devil chicken was quite good also. Serving time is slightly more than usual. Otherwise a good experience. Happy fooding‚ò∫!

We ordered chicken hot and sour soup , Chicken Celary Wine and Schezwan Maifoon Chicken
Soup was thick and spicy , it was a tasty refreshing dish üëå
Then coming to Chicken Celary Wine , it was too good , the quantity and quality both was up to the mark . We took less spicy dish as Schezwan Maifoon was too spicy .
Only problem was with Maifoon , as it was under salted !
Overall it is a budget friendly restaurant .

I am not going to say about food as the food was kind of average but about there dishonesty behavior.  after I asked for the bill I found three extra drinks that we did not order was added in me bill and on that the calculation of GST. Fortunately I carefully looked and notify that to the manager. realize there fault but didn't lose the dishonesty and just cut down the 3 Mocktail cost. but Calculated GST of 18% on that same previous amount.  after I got angry and i asked for a new fresh bill they finally provide me that correct bill though the look of the manager was ridiculous like I am leaving without pay. This kind of disgusting incident need to be highlighted among  people and restaurant need to be punished. I will never go there again.

Red Bamboo Shoot has very good food which is worth the money. However when we try to order certain dishes like Pan fried Momos which is one of the best snacking we had, we couldn't order it online through Zomato and which sometimes varies from the menu. This is probably a business decision as the minimum delivered food though Zomato is Rs 99 while ordering through their own lines the minimum delivery food is Rs 350 which becomes bit difficult to order in times when we are only snacking and do not require dinner services. I think if RBS can look into it, then they will earn many more followers who want quick snack for little money rather than heavy dinner.

Red Bamboo Shoot is a great place to grab some Chinese and Thai delicacy. I often visit this outlet for dinner during my weekends. Not only do they serve great quality food at reasonable cost but also take care of hospitality proficiently. I would definitely recommend everyone I know to try the Chicken Manchow Soup and Shreded Crab. It has a beautiful ambience for you to hover your stuff with utmost satisfaction. The best part is that they do not allow large crowd onside to ensure optimum customer satisfaction. Get you meal at the Red Bamboo Shoot soon.

How come this restaurant is operating with such awfully lousy taste of food....and they claim it Chinese????  crime.... we had ordered one mixed hakka chowmein, one mixed fried rice, one kungpaw chicken and one chilli butter garlic fish... after eating the food, both me and my wife want to puke... this is disgrace at most.

I ordered for dinner around 7.45 today from this restaurant,firstly I was really impressed to check their progress on app as they were showing estimated time 60mins and app tracker showed quick progress and it showed they are out for delivery on time but then time passed and there was no sign of the delivery boy, meanwhile  zomato support kept asking whether I have received my order and after knowing that it's not delivered they contacted the restaurant and informed that the food is on it's way. Surprisingly  30mins after scheduled time when I called up the restaurant they informed at first that they haven't got the order and later they informed that they got the order but haven't start preparing as they are in a rush! I was angry and impatient however the restaurant stuffs convinced me that they are trying their best to send it asap. Interestingly this shitty ZOMATO SERVICE kept lying that the food is on it's way!
I finally got the delivery around 9.45 and as this was my first main course order ,I was pretty impressed with the food quality. Very tasty Chinese food served steaming hot. Loved all the dishes specially Garlic pepper chicken. Would have given better rating if I wasn't harrassed like this ,zomato is partly responsible for annoying me with their false updates. Keep up the good work Red bamboo shoot and do let us know in time whenever  you are going to be late to deliver,just keep your customer updated with the truth.

There are only few restaurants who serves great Chinese food ; and this eatery is definitely one of them. Everything, the food, the ambiance, the staffs, the service......all was great. We ordered crispy conjee lamb, Devils chichen, burnt chilli garlic meifoon (mixed), and in drinks coke shikanji and blue lagoon.

I loved their mixed burnt chilli garlic meifoon. It was mind-blowing. The chickn, prawn in the noodles was soft and succulent. Portion size was also very good.
Conjee crispy lamb was also very tasty. I liked every thing about this restaurant.
I am giving this restaurant extra +.5 rating because of the staffs. They are very friendly and courteous. And the service was excellent.

And we will definitely visit this restaurant again to try their other dishes.

Food- Worth the money spent. One of the few places with good Thai dishes. 
Service- Didn't expect such a wonderful behaviour from everyone. They were literally waiting for me to finish one of my dishes to come and serve me the next one, which was already kept on the table beside my plate.

If you‚Äôre a true fan of Chinese cuisine and like to eat spicy dishes then you just can‚Äôt ignore Chinese dishes like me. side by side I do like to eat Thai dishes, not only that super spicy appetizer as well as I do like to eat authentic Thai Green Curry.there are few restaurants in Calcutta which serve both Chinese & Thai dishes, ‚ÄúRed Bamboo Shoot‚Äù is one of them. located in Garia, walking distance from Kavi Nazrul Metro Station. from the outside I thought may be it was a small place, but after entering there I was totally shocked. quite big enough space which can accommodate around 40-45 people at a time. nice cozy sofas along with chair & table. here not only lip-smacking foods but you can find delicious beverages especially the non-alcoholic drinks. right now they have three outlets in Calcutta including this one, another one is located in near Kasba and the other one is in Picnic Garden.

I had ordered chicken fried rice, chicken hot harlic and drums of heaven. The order was delivered on time. The fried rice and hot garlic chicken was pleasant to eat, nothing extraordinary though. Then came the drums of heaven , with the first bite i could feel i am eating something very chewy. When i spit it out, it was a flabby piece of chicken skin. I mean i knew restaurants don't give the whole chicken in drumsticks but it was just chicken skin and flour with micromini pieces of chicken. If this is the quality here then i would never recommend people to eat from here and not to trust the zomato ratings.

Garia now ¬†has an all new destination to boast for serving delicious Chinese and Thai cuisine- Red Bamboo Shoot restaurant. Red, corresponding with fire, symbolizes good fortune, joy and good luck in the Chinese culture and bamboo being one of the fastest growing species in the Asian region has justified the name of this restaurant to the utmost as within a short span of time it has evidently become quite a popular Chinese joint. Well that having said let‚Äôs come to the most intriguing part- food; team Panchphoron was invited by the management of this place for lunch and we tried

‚ÄòRed Bamboo Shoot‚Äô is a popular destination for those who love Chinese and Thai cuisine. They have three outlets around kolkata and Recently ‚ÄòTeam Panchphoron‚Äô¬†is invited for an event and also to try out some of their recommended dishes for their Garia outlet which is one of the premier restaurants in that area. This place is relatively big compared to the other two outlets and nicely decorated as well with colourful lights and nice interior. They really do have some mouth watering dishes in their menu which you should definitely try. Some of their Recommended Dishes are : Spicy Seafood Soup, Steam Wanton Chicken, Pan Fried Fish, Prawn Pepper Salt, Five Spicy Chicken, Chicken Three Flavour Hakka Noodles, Chicken Burnt Chilly Garlic Rice, Chicken Green Curry, Hunan Chicken, Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce, Crispy fry Milk Cake, Banana Troffie.

Went for a dinner with family on last week. It was a pleasant experience. This was my 2nd visit here. We ordered Cronje crispy chicken, Dry chilli chicken and Singapore meifoon noodles. All the items served on time tasted‚Äã really good and were of sufficient quantity. We finally finished with mocktails and icecream that were also nice. The behaviour of staffs were also very nice. Also liked the two salads they served at beginning.

Would like to visit here again.

You would hardly guess that a proper restaurant exists behind the small one-door facade that is the Garia outlet of Red Bamboo Shoot. Recently dropped in here with my parents who had a sudden craving for Chinese. Happy to say that we had a very satisfactory experience!

We ordered Chicken Manchow Soup, Chilli Butter Garlic Fish, Prawns in Chilli Oyster Sauce, Hot Garlic Chicken and Egg Hakka Noodles. The soup was quite nice, but the garlic fish starter could have been better. The prawn and chicken side-dishes were very good, well-cooked and succulent. All the food portions are quite generous and prices are pretty reasonable. Ambience of the place was also quite nice, with muted lighting and thoughtful table arrangements. But the biggest clincher was the service. The staff was very well-behaved and courteous, and also provided good suggestions regarding what to order.

Overall, a great place to satiate your Chinese cravings; would definitely visit again in order to try out some of the other dishes.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The ambience is nice and the service was good too. We tried out Chicken Hakka noodles, Chicken fried rice, Schezwan chicken and Chilli Fish.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 
The food wasn't disappointing by any means though it did leave some space for something even better to be desired for.

FINAL VERDICT- I would say that neither am I disappointed by this place nor am I thrilled, but yeah its worth giving a try.

This newly opened food joint mainly serves Chinese & Thai delicacies. They have home delivery, dine in & take away facilities. This is one of the rarest gem in Kolkata which serves authentic Chinese dishes at a pocket friendly price, food here is less spicy, msg (monosodium glutamate) free and reasonable. 

Staffs & Service - Staffs are well behaved and service is prompt.Thank you Special for Mr. Sajal Biswas He will take care about our service .we will be coming again.

This is an amazing place to have chineese food in Garia side. I had food for the second time today & couldn't stop myself from sharing my overwhelming experience. We ordered Egg Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Dunken Chilli Fish, Pepper Garlic Chicken, Szn Chicken Meifoon. Every otem was Perfect to the T. Dunken chilli fish is a sweet item which synced very well with the spicy meifoon. Chickens were melting in my mouth. I have had not such amazing chicken quality even in Park street or Tangra - the Chinese hubs of Kolkata. Quantity is so much that 1 plate is enough for 2 Adults.

Look and feel wise the restaurant is good. The stuffs are also very courteous. Location wise it is easy to find as it is just beside the main road, a 3 min walk from Garia Sitala Mandir. I went there with one of my friend. We ordered one soda sikanji and masala thumps up. Both the drinks were good in taste. For starter we ordered crispy chili chicken fry which was awesome and went very good with the drinks. We also had mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Manchurian. Fried was nice quality and quantity wise. But the chicken manchurian was not that good. It was ok. At last we had a chocolate ice cream which was like normal ice cream nothing special in taste.

If you have guests at your place and you want to order food for them, please don't rely on these guys. Here's what happened in exact chronology:-
At 9.26 we made an order. They assured us they would send us by 45mins. We mentioned we have guests waiting. 
At 10 they telephone us to ask which sauce to put in the noodles( yes I am not kidding). When we questioned about the time they would take to deliver the order, they assured us (for the second time) it would take another 7 to 10mins more.
At 10.30 we called them up (now pretty enraged) saying that we don't want the order anymore because they are taking too much time. The person concerned instead stated the order cannot be cancelled. And that their runner has left already. 
When it was 11.07pm, we were outright angry. We had already ordered take away from another restaurant, which had arrived but not this food. After making three calls, they finally received our call stating that the runner would be there "anytime now". We were at our wits end and we were compelled to say that we do not care if the runner arrives or not, we are not paying a single dime for their food, for our guests were now about to leave, we had already fed them with the food we ordered way later from elsewhere which had arrived too- so the entire purpose was lost behind accepting their food and that we wouldn't. 
I'm not complaining about their food quality because we never got a chance to taste it, but service is an integral part of the food cosmos and their service was completely unacceptable. 
So Red Bamboo Shoot, here is the stinker that we assured you, we would notify zomato about. Please buck up!

After a alot of scrutiny I finally decided to drop by. Last night's dinner with my parents was nothing less that amazing! üòÅ

We ordered Drumkin chili fish for starters, medium spicy , light fried , melts in your mouth!
For main course we ordered Mixed meinfoon, Mixed burnt chili garlic noodles(must try this), kung pao chicken and Losou prawn( This was just too good! üòçüòç )

We even had dessert‚Äã .. Todays special- Mango with vanilla ice cream and Darshan with vanilla..
The desserts were ok-ok.. not too bad not too good.

Ambience & Service - 10/10 .. no complaints regd. that whatsoever. Do try this place out.

P.s- Sorry i forgot to click pics of the meinfoon & noodles üòÖüòÖ

Located right opposite Garia Crematorium, this restaurant is a gem serving yummy dishes. We went to this place on a weekday to have dinner. Though there were quite a few people, the staffs attended each of them with patience and courtesy explaining how their ordered dish would taste. While taking the order, they also informed that the prices in the menu were excluding taxes and vat, service tax etc. would be charged extra.

We ordered RBS Special Non-veg Fried Rice and Lamb in Schezwan Sauce. Both the items were extremely tasty and the quantity of food was also impressive. The ambience was nice with a dim light setting. But there is some space related issue for parking!

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: Rs. 600 for two (apprx.)

So... Finally dropped in! And it was absolutely worth it. I dropped in with a friend and we ordered Konjee crispy lamb, chicken sumai, Shezwan mixed meifoon, Kung pao chicken and cold drinks.
All of the dishes were absolutely perfect. The Konjee crispy lamb was pure bliss and so were the other items. Service was quite impressive and staffs were extremely courteous. I also ordered drums of heaven for home and it was equally lip-smacking... So far it's one of best drums of heaven I've tasted. It was perfect! 
I'm in love with this eatery and would love to come back again. The ambience impressed me a lot. Every food enthusiast especially Chinese and Thai food lovers shouldn't give it a miss üëç

Horrible Restaurant. I don't know why people have given such ratings. We ordered food based on the rating for our office party. We spend 12K for that day but all the food we have to throw in garbage. Nobody was able to eat a single plate.

The reason being that
1) No flavours in any of the dishes as being Chinese.
2) Cost is relatively high if you are thinking about casual dining for a group.
3) Spicy being full of chilly.

We ordered Chicken Suimai, Drums of Heaven, Cantonese Mixed Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Lamb in Oyster Sauce, Prawn Schezwan Sauce, Devil's Chicken. All these foods were wastage of money.

Please try some other buffet restaurant Mainland China or Haka etc. for authentic Chinese food instead of this place.

Now talking about the food. Yes,they do add MSG (or ajinamoto as you call it) in the food. So, if you do not want it just inform the waiter and you will be served accordingly. 
Ordered chicken fried rice, schezwan chicken and kung pao chicken. Both the dishes of chicken were equally flavourful but the rice. It contained nearly unboiled veggies in it.

People having cravings for Chinese and even their desire to eat seat food , then this is a place atleast you should try once.
Starting from schezwan garlic noodle,BarBque chicken with black sauce,Dimsum, momo etc everything is made with delight taste and i am sure even you will like it.

Review is based on home delivery!! Good things first....barbeque chicken as starters was too good to miss!! It was spicy and crispy and wow!! But the issue is ....this is where the good things end. The main course of mixed friedrice, fish chilli wine and devils chicken were ok without being spectacular!! We definitely liked the items but it wasnt so delicious which will compel us to reorder again!! Quantity was great.....and  price was resonable overall...

This review is based on the food we ordered from this Red bamboo shoot restaurant last week. The delivery was prompt and before the estimated time. Food pricing is reasonable.  Residing  a couple of buildings away from Chowman Patuli, we generally order food from it but this time decided to go for Red bamboo shoot for a change.  And believe me we were in for great surprise in terms of food quality and taste. 
Drums of heaven and pan fried price were very good. 
So was the hakka noodles.  
Mixed American chopsuey was crisp and tangy, with loads of vegetables, chicken and prawn.  
What stood out most, was their konjee crispy lamp: this place is a heaven for lamb connoisseurs.  Absolutely brilliant.  
Would like to visit their outlet and taste their other delicacies.

Food served was fresh and hot. Good food.
Quantity was enough.
Konjee crispy lamb was just mind blowing.
Don't know anything about their delivery service yet I saw 2 delivery bike s at the gate.
In short,better service would make me rated 5 stars.
Price is on the HIGHER side.

You enter the place with a warm welcome and you get the first glimpse of their amazing service.Food is good,nothing spectacular though. Quantity for the price is humongous. I wasn't able to finish a single plate of noodles, that clearly gives an idea to all those who happen to know me. a single plate is enough for two.

Highly recomended.

I wasn't able to finish a single plate of noodles, that clearly gives an idea to all those who happen to know me. a single plate is enough for two.

Highly recomended.

Cheers!

It was my first choice for its good food,its amount same time its resonable price.Recently last few ordes made me to think otherwise.The RBS special mixed fried rice was really superb.Recently the quality was average,amount also gone down n the cost has increased around 23-24%.I like 2 know why I have 2 pay for a sevice charge in case of take away.

Yesterday we ordered Pan fried noodles along with cantonese noodles,rice noodles and Tshing hoi chicken through zomato. This restaurant was our favourite in the locality but i must say that was very disappointed with the food served. The pan fried gravy was pathetic it was like soya sauce jelly served with the noodles, cantonese was tastleless and so was rice noodles. Dont know whether there has been any change in the cooking staff but it was surprising to see the standards have fallen to such extent. Sorry to rate this restaurant so low, but hopeful that i would need to change it later.
It was a good gesture from the management to follow up last week and to provide us with the same dishes in order to check the food quality again. And this time the food tasted way better than last time, specially the pan fried noodles. I am glad that the management did take a look at the quality of food served and have changed the rating.

Super quality and super quantity.
Dine in place is huge and well furnished and well decorated.
Coming to food,think twice about the quantity before ordering.The quantity is huge.
And quality is also great.
Chinese lovers,must try once.
Price is moderate.

Must try - hot chilly basil fish, BBQ chicken, fish in oyster sauce. Didn't like the szchewan chicken fried rice though. But overall, one of the best restaurants in this vicinity.

Visited for the first time and had some lovely dishes except one. We ordered virgin mojito, bar-b-q chicken, chicken dimsum for starters and in main course we had mixed rice noodles with lamb in chilly oyster sauce. Every preparation was nice except the lamb. It wasn't cooked well. There was a stinky smell in it which I didn't like. I would definitely give them another 0.5 if that particular preparation would meet my expectation. Another good thing was they also offered a 30% discount in total billing amount for their 'Happy Hour' (3pm to 6pm)

Its nice !! Never imagined Garia can have a nice place such as this, and the place still manages to stay in business. I have seen franchises coming and going. People here are mostly allergic to quality food it seems.

Anyways, the one thing I am finicky about while having a Mixed Hakka Noodle is the prawn. Seldom do I see restaurants using good quality prawn (shrimp rather) in the noodles. This place however makes an exception, the prawn is well cooked ,properly cleaned. The chefs do have a generous indulgence when it comes to the shredded chicken and fried egg in the noodles. They put in plenty !!! And more chicken is always better.

The Burnt Chilli Garlic Hakka Noodle wasn't half as bad either. Well cooked with an extravagant amount of shredded chicken, eggs and prawn and here also no compromises with the quality. 

I sincerely hope the people here take a shot with this place , they are not going to be disappointed!!

Great to see good reviews and ordered being like my neighbour restaurant. It's good to listen to what your customer want as part of hospitality. I did not order Momo and restaurant was rude stating cannot give Momo chutney as you dint order Momo. I asked for it because you gave a sweet syrup sauce BBQ extra sweet bean lamb and almost puked as I was drinking. Road side noodles are far better than your meifoon that was made with raw prawns. Finally, delivery boy ask if I paid, when it was paid online showing paid on bill too. This restaurant should be shut down. Girls would love it too sweet for their sweetness.

I have ordered food from here and is really impressed. Their stir fried chicken with basil in the thai section is a sure winner among starters. slightly crispy yet juicy chicken pieces tossed in sauce with the mild taste of basil! Amazing it is. The quantity of the main course is also good. Their chicken or fish side dishes are not uncomfortably spicy and the tastes decent. Amount of each dishes is also pretty good. And the best part of the home delivery service (which is pretty fast) is that if you tell them they bring the card swapping machine! Now what more can u ask for in today's demonetised market :D

Only 5 minutes away from my home, this is a place for total Lamb-Ecstasy!!!!

Out of nowhere, it came to us to visit this chinese-cum-thai eatery, and our buds were fulfilled to their expectations...

We ordered Five Spice Chicken, Stir fried Chicken with Basil and BBQ Sweet Bean Lamb in starters.. Both the chicken were average and the quality of chicken wasn't upto the mark...
But the Lamb did tickle me with a unique taste of coriander.. I haven't had coriander in lamb dishes before and it was way beyond average!!

In the mains we had Chilly Garlic meifoon with Losou Lamb... Meifoon was okayish but again the Lamb startled me... Slices cooked in a red curry with unique flavours... really good!

Service does require a special mention, as it was quite exceptional!!!!

Found out this place, which at that time had above 4 star and was quite impressed by the reviews and pictures. So we thought to give this outlet a try during puja. As soon as we entered, ambience and decor impressed us. At the beginning, staffs were nice and well mannered. We ordered chicken fried rice and garlic pepper chicken. When the food arrived we just wanted to throw the food and run away. The rice is not cooked properly and the chicken was too bad. The gravy provided had spices not mixed well and peppers are not grinded. We told beforehand we want a dish which is spicy and gravy and they assured about the dish but neither it had much gravy nor spicy. So when we told them to make it gravy and spicy they started talking among themselves showing irritation which was quite audible. Then when the dish arrived after making changes, the waiter who served put ta dish with a irritated gesture and this time what came was disaster with too much peppercorns and also the dish got burnt. There was no senior staff or manager available to whom we can complain. I didn't even wanted to give any service tips and as my friend told we gave. During pujo,quality deteriorates but never expected this will be the result. Till now I never experienced such disaster.

But came to the main part the food is not good as you expect. The quantity is good. We havemany thing, but the horrible experience is the lamb in Oyster sauce. The sauce is too much that the whole dish tastes soury. Expert that nothing to say. Otherwise it's ok. You can definitely have a good time there and pocket friendly too.

Staffs were very polite and helpful with full information of their speciality items. They suggested us according to their speciality n all those food were really very tasty with good quantity. Only fried ice Cream with chocolate sauce was not that sweet to be served as a dessert. This is a pocket friendly restaurant with nice ambiance n good staffs.

Decor is quite simple..a very basic one. Yet I love this place for it's fantastic delicacy :)

Fried rice tested fake and had a odourly smell. It was unsatisfactory as a whole.

This place serves very tasty food at pocket friendly prices. The list price on the menu card is all inclusive of taxes. Thus I found their pricing 20% less than comparable restaurants. It is quite spacious and the seating arrangement is good. The staff are not street smart but very courteous and polite and are very attentive to their guests.
My favourite dishes here are their burnt garlic spring onion fried rice, pan fried fish in oyster sauce, chilli garlic chicken, and garlic butter fish. The staff are candid and accepted that they use frozen basha fillet for all fish items.
I will definitely revisit the place and hope they live up to customer's expectations.

If you like surprises then this is the place for you. Ordered Bar-b-q chicken and Five Spices Chicken, of course while keeping our fingers crossed. The food arrived, we took the first bite from the dishes, uncrossed our fingers and touched them to our foreheads to salute the one in the kitchen. Well it tasted almost gourmet... Come on..the meat was tender and succulent, you could tell the flavours, you could even feel the different spices they were cooked in. That is pretty awesome to me. What I felt was you could blindly order anything from the menu and not be dissapointed.

 And pocket pinch? Just 400 bucks. Do visit people.

I have been to Garia Area to meet my college professor and help him in a task. On my way back, I met with my friend and decided to have some food. Though it was not yet the usual evening food time, I thought to spend the time in the restaurant itself.
It took little more than expected to find its location but nevertheless, it was worth it. Upon entering we were welcomed by low lit area and blue-reddish decor. Getting ourselves seated, we found the young waiter at our disposal who immediately asked for the type of water and we opted for tap water. He handed over the menu and stood at safe distance in anticipation of the order. I requested him to go as I will order after few minutes, which he instantly obeyed.
We ordered for a Barbecue Chicken and two soft drinks and later followed it up my Chicken Steamed Momo and drinks. Upon having a bite of Barbecue, I was vehemently amazed at the taste and it just made me happier. I quietly finished it up and wished for more but my hunger was quenched. The order for Momo was made at a later stage and we were not disturbed at all which gave us ample privacy to continue our discussion. Finally after ordering for Momo, I headed to find the soup made quiet articulately and I liked it despite not liking Momo.
I would like to make a special mention about the hospitality of the staffs - manager as well as the waiter who took too much care of us and was continuously looking out if we required any assistance. They get full marks for their job.
The price was the food was "extremely reasonable" and it was quoted on the Menu along with the taxes which was a feather in the cap.
Overall, I thoroughly cherished the visit which tend to be a memorable.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Well, definitely you should give it a go or you are sure to miss a splendid memory.

Qs) Why have I rated them 5 stars?
Ans) In order to not give them "stars", I need to find a reason for not doing ¬†the same, which I could not find. In other words, I was too satisfied and hardly found any shortcomings and hence this rating.

It took little more than expected to find its location but nevertheless, it was worth it. Upon entering we were welcomed by low lit area and blue-reddish decor. Getting ourselves seated, we found the young waiter at our disposal who immediately asked for the type of water and we opted for tap water. He handed over the menu and stood at safe distance in anticipation of the order. I requested him to go as I will order after few minutes, which he instantly obeyed.
We ordered for a Barbecue Chicken and two soft drinks and later followed it up my Chicken Steamed Momo and drinks. Upon having a bite of Barbecue, I was vehemently amazed at the taste and it just made me happier. I quietly finished it up and wished for more but my hunger was quenched. The order for Momo was made at a later stage and we were not disturbed at all which gave us ample privacy to continue our discussion. Finally after ordering for Momo, I headed to find the soup made quiet articulately and I liked it despite not liking Momo.
I would like to make a special mention about the hospitality of the staffs - manager as well as the waiter who took too much care of us and was continuously looking out if we required any assistance. They get full marks for their job.
The price was the food was "extremely reasonable" and it was quoted on the Menu along with the taxes which was a feather in the cap.
Overall, I thoroughly cherished the visit which tend to be a memorable.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Well, definitely you should give it a go or you are sure to miss a splendid memory.

Qs) Why have I rated them 5 stars?
Ans) In order to not give them "stars", I need to find a reason for not doing ¬†the same, which I could not find. In other words, I was too satisfied and hardly found any shortcomings and hence this rating.

Orders food through Swiggy, delivered wrong food. And did not bother to take responsibility. Had to pay for something which I never got. Feeling cheated

The ambience was truely fine. Had a different vibe. Food was really good. Spacious for groups of 6 to 8 people. The location of the restaurant may rise sone eyebrows but once tried everything clarifies. Would easily recommend as a very good option near Garia area who are seeking for Thai & Chinese.

I think the place is just over hyped. We were very hungry and was going through nearby places section available in Zomato. We found out a place called reg bamboo shoot with good reviews. Seeing the reviews , we ordered a burnt garlic Spanish onion rice and a barbeque chicken. There rice was not that good. The chicken was okay. But the overall food got stuck in our throat as they were both very dry. We applied lots of vinegar on our rice to bring some taste to it. The waiter was good. Like really nice staff. :) The d√©cor is cool. Especially the blue lights. The rates are considerably moderate. :) And the best thing about this place is the rates are tax inclusive.

Have been to this restaurant for dinner on Saturday. Quite spacious and clean. Kids were drawn to the huge aquarium inside. Kid friendly staff and great hospitality. We ordered Singapore noodles, Cantonese noodles, conjee crispy chicken for starters and chicken in malaka sauce. Conjee crispy chicken was a delicious starter I had in a long time. Noodles were good and huge in quantity. Can be easily shared by two. Chicken in malaka sauce tasted totally different. I didn't like it much for the taste of clove but my husband liked it. Coming again for sure.

Very flavorful food at reasonable prices. Will recommend their barbeque chicken, which is heavenly. Crispy chili babycorn and crispy fry chili chicken are also excellent. For the price, quantity is more than good. However, I would recommend to them to go easy on the oil. It can almost overpower the taste and feel of the dishes sometimes, which is a shame, considering the dishes are otherwise spot on in flavor and deliciousness.

The food was good but I believe if u can use less thick noodles it would taste better. Overall its good value for ur money. The quality they provided was more than enough for four people.

I ordered two vegetarian dishes Pad Thai Noodles and Thai Veg Curry for vegetarian guests at home. This was my first order. My friends had already eaten two spoonfuls of the noodles and then they discovered some CHICKEN pieces. It shows that they don't cook with care. I doubt their hygiene standards inside the kitchen. This was such a humiliating experience for me in front of guests.

A bit far away from my home, but managed to come one day with the help of Zomato and Ola. The first thing which I disliked about this place is the location. The food I ordered for dine-in and take-away had quite a contrast. The parcel order lacked taste and I really regretted of not having a complete meal in the restaurant. The service too was slow for some reason. Wouldn't want to visit again, atleast for this outlet.

Truly, it's a hidden gem. This is the newest outlet of the joint. Being a Chinese cuisine lover, how I wanted a decent restaurant in this locality. And it came out beyond my expectation! We went there on Shasthi night. It was full packed. Their service is very fast and cordial. Food was very good. The ambience was soothing. The lights were dim. The price was on a higher side. Because it was a Puja menu, whose price was of course higher than the regular menu. They also have home delivery option in my locality. So, I'm looking forward to order soon. Have fun. Bon appetite.

Wanted to visit this place for quite a long time and actually managed it on the Shasti afternoon. I want to give them a rating of 4, but not giving it because of the fact that, they had raised the prices for pujo occasion. 
Located on the Boral main road, this place can be a bit tricky for someone, who is not regular around Garia. If you take the road, just opposite to Shitala Mandir, it falls on the left hand side after few minutes of walk.
The ambience here is really nice and spacious. It took them a while to attend us, which is understandable during Pujo. We wanted to order something spicy with mixed fried rice and they recommend devil's chicken. Their service was good and food was really nice. Fried rice was a bit different and we liked it very much. Chicken preparation was cooked nicely and it was spicy.
Price was surely on the higher side, as mentioned earlier,  they had raised the prices because of pujo. Overall it a great place to have lovely food. Will surely be there again.

Had ordered Devils chicken and Stir fried Babycorn from here in the influence of past zomato reviews.The stir fried Babycorn tasted nice.Devils chicken could have been less oily and less spicy! Nevertheless taste was good and hope to order more from here since it is quite a cost effective restaurant.

Red Bamboo Shoot has become like our go-to-place every time we feel like we need some pampering in terms of eating good food. If you don't keep an eye for it there is a good chance that you might not be able to spot the entrance but once you get inside, the grandeur of the place blows your mind out.Food is so reasonably priced that you all you want to do is just eat!We had ordered for meat ball soup, prawn pan fried noodles and chicken Jhad Thai. Jhad Thai was the star of the day. Other preparations were also delicious and quantity is bountiful but the amazing use of lemon flavor and star anise in Jhad Thai was outstanding. We had to finish the meal with 'masala soda'. Had to because the quantity and the food is so delicious, you just can't stop eating. Prompt service and a great staff!! If in Garia, this place must be checked out!

Dropped by this restaurant with my mother and 2 relatives during pandal hopping in the area.We ordered 2 plates of noodles(chicken hakka noodles and burnt chilli garlic noodles),crispy fried chilli chicken & Kung pao chicken.

Food was fantastic.The crispy fried chilli chicken was crispy and spicy..loved by all of us.The chicken pieces weren't overcooked..hence it was soft within the perfect crunch outside.
The noodles were perfectly cooked and not oily.I loved the burnt chilli garlic noodles a lot because of the hint of spice in it.Kung pao chicken was a perfect accompaniment to it with its flavour profile of sweet and spicy gravy and roasted cashews in it.The chicken pieces here too was very soft.

The quantity was huge..only these dishes were too much for 4 hungry adults.Quality and taste wasn't compromised at all. Service was prompt too.Price is pocket friendly which is a plus.The only thing they can change is that giving it a more soothing and bright light instead of the blue LEDs.Place looks a bit dark inside due to it.Making it soothingly lit up will go better with the soulful oriental cuisine.

It's near to my home so I prefer home delivery. They recently hiked their pricechart but still u won't mind paying bit extra also. Also try the chilli garlic butter fish in starters.

Amazing place. Pocket friendly. The space is huge and very well lit. After a long long time, Garia has a proper Chinese restaurant. The others were hits and misses. Hats off to Mr. Shankar Rai. Not only he and the other people working there are efficient, but are very friendly too. They help to choose from the menu and are patient. And boy, they are super generous. The amount of food they put per plate is huuge. And my mother is a fan of their mixed fried rice. Chinese food lovers of Garia and beyond, do give this place a visit. It will be worth your time.

Well 4.1 rating by Zomato drew me to this restaurant.Yesterday ie on 16.09.16 at around 9:45 p.m we ordered for parcel.There was Tom Yam chk soup, Cantonese Chk & Phad Thai chk. Food was good but I would like to point out certain important facts:
1)The soup tasted good but it was reddish yellow in colour normally Tom Yam Soup is transparent and clear.
2) Cantonese Chk was good.
3) The most DISAPPOINTING one we got veg Phad Thai instead of Chicken.It has mushroom, baby corn & everything but not chicken.Though we were charged with the chk Phad Thai rate.
One should be more careful while sending parcels & home deliveries because these customers will come back with their families & friends.
Hence please don't take people who take parcels for granted and pack whatever you want.Be more careful.

It is a very good dinner experience...red bamboo shoot is near boral road garia...it is the main branch...the food is too tasty... including the desert..
We have tried many things and also visited many times..

Coming back to the food we have tried losou lamb, chicken gravy noddles, red bamboo shoot special fried rice, pan fried chicken, hot and sour soup, chicken in celery wine, lat me kai chicken, burnt garlic fried rice, devil fish and tutti fruity..

All the chicken and lamb dishes are very good..they are well cooked...the chicken and lamb melts in the mouth...but the fish dishes are not good...it smells a lot though they use Basa...

The staffs takes good care of the customers...the price is not high it is affordable... overall it is a good restaurant

It was a very good dinner experience with my family. Loved a lot. I heard a lot about this restaurant and finally went there on 21st Aug. Ordered Bar-B-Q chicken in starter which is awesome in taste. The chicken is very soft and juicy. In main course we had Mixed Singapore meifoon, Crab meat in chilly oyster sauce, Kung pao prawn. All the items are delicious. Last we ordered tutti futti , Masala thums up. The balance of masala, sour is perfect. Overall liked a lot and want to visit every month. Added the snaps

Came across Red Bamboo Shoot on Zomato while browsing through a nearby place for Oriental lunch. Noticed that this place has good reviews and wanted to give it a try. So reached here this afternoon with high expectations and a hungry stomach.
Location & Ambience - The location is slightly tricky for those who are not acquainted with the roads in & around Garia. But it is not very difficult to find out as it is located right on Boral main road. The entrance is not very uplifting, but once you're inside, there is plenty of space and well-arranged seating provisions which are very comfortable. The cliche oriental decorations adorn the wall and a soft instrumental was playing which was soon switched to something way funkier. That ¬†was a bit out of place. (Rating: 3/5)
Staff & Service - Extremely happy with their cordiality and service! The attendant knew the menu well and had proper suggestions on being asked. Very jovial and interactive staff who took the effort to enquire more than once if everything is as per our liking. Hospitality was really impressive. Full marks here. (Rating: 5/5)
Food - Amazing!! It's a shame that a restaurant which such amazing food is tucked away behind a small entrance in a less-travelled road. We took Conjee Crispy Lamb, Burnt Garlic & Spring Onion Fried Rice (Mixed) and Fish in Chili Black Bean Sauce along with Soda Shikanji & Masala Thums up. Lamb tasted excellent except some strips of the meat were quite chewy. The Fish ¬†was delicious with generous portions of fish chunks in a perfect black bean sauce! The rice was something new for me and was absolutely delectable! The tastes complimented each other well and the burnt garlic rice is something I will definitely go back here for. The proportions for their dishes are quite a lot and easily more than enough for 2 people. ¬†(Rating 4/5)
Value for Money - Definitely worth every penny spent. It is extremely cost effective and with a bill of only INR 680 for all this - it's quite a steal. Costlier restaurants fail to provide such mouth-watering delicacies. Both in terms of quantity & quality, Red Bamboo Shoot is a Must Try!! Kudos to the entire team for providing an excellent gastronomic journey. Definitely going back soon with hopes of finding nothing negative at all. (4.5/5)

Well, as many people described on this forum, I too, would have faced issues locating the restaurant. ¬†But lucky me, I ordered online.

Coming to the food and its quality, I had almost given up my search for a good Restaurant in Garia area. Even the ones with somewhat high ratings, disappointed me with the food quality. But today, suddenly, I found Red Bamboo Shoot. And when food was delivered, I was surprised seeing the quantity. We as Indians are always after having quality food at lower price & here the quantity was sufficient.

With quantity, there was very little compromise on the quality. Though the use of oil felt excess at times, and the dish became too slippery inside the ¬†mouth, but even then, the taste was generally good. After a long time, I ate chilli chicken that was on the higher side of spiciness.

Overall, the restaurant is good, both in quality and quantity and is good for a full stomach afternoon lunch or a appetising ¬†dinner.

If you want to go for a real fine dine in Garia then it is a really tough job for you. The old fashioned restaurants are there but not modern and their menu lists are not also unique. Red Bamboo Shoot is a perfect fine dine near Garia Hater More(not Gariahat).
Mr. Shankar Rai an ex Taj Bengal hotel chef made this restro with the speciality in chinese and thai food. So you can expect mouth watering 5 star dishes from them.
Ambience of the restaurant is really good, prices are very much affordable, varity of dishes and sufficient amount will must give 4 out of 5 to them.
I will give .5 extra for their must try bevarages.

Came across Red Bamboo Shoot on Zomato while browsing through a nearby place for Oriental lunch. Noticed that this place has good reviews and wanted to give it a try. So reached here this afternoon with high expectations and a hungry stomach.
Location & Ambience - The location is slightly tricky for those who are not acquainted with the roads in & around Garia. But it is not very difficult to find out as it is located right on Boral main road. The entrance is not very uplifting, but once you're inside, there is plenty of space and well-arranged seating provisions which are very comfortable. The cliche oriental decorations adorn the wall and a soft instrumental was playing which was soon switched to something way funkier. That ¬†was a bit out of place. (Rating: 3/5)
Staff & Service - Extremely happy with their cordiality and service! The attendant knew the menu well and had proper suggestions on being asked. Very jovial and interactive staff who took the effort to enquire more than once if everything is as per our liking. Hospitality was really impressive. Full marks here. (Rating: 5/5)
Food - Amazing!! It's a shame that a restaurant which such amazing food is tucked away behind a small entrance in a less-travelled road. We took Conjee Crispy Lamb, Burnt Garlic & Spring Onion Fried Rice (Mixed) and Fish in Chili Black Bean Sauce along with Soda Shikanji & Masala Thums up. Lamb tasted excellent except some strips of the meat were quite chewy. The Fish ¬†was delicious with generous portions of fish chunks in a perfect black bean sauce! The rice was something new for me and was absolutely delectable! The tastes complimented each other well and the burnt garlic rice is something I will definitely go back here for. The proportions for their dishes are quite a lot and easily more than enough for 2 people. ¬†(Rating 4/5)

If you want to have a fine dining experience with your friends or family this place is a must try. Food are awesome, prices are reasonable and service is excellent. I have become a frequenter here as my family loves both the food and the ambience. The best part is, they use authentic ingredients and spices. Recently opened mocktail counter serves lovely varieties. Do not order much in one go, their servings are, in some cases, even good for three. Try Thai here...

Only issue you face here is to locate this restaurant. Located in a dingy road and is not perfect place for fine dining experience. The food is very very tasty but only issue is the location of this place otherwise ambiance is okay too. Good option to have home delivery from here if you are staying near by. Quanity wise also they serve loads of amount and at a reasonable price

This is first of its kind restaurant in Garia , with good Indian Chinese food.Ambience is good and service is great. They prepare great Monchow soup, have a wide range of chicken and fish starters and main course.

The place is very near to our home and I have been there multiple time. You should try this place if you are a Indian Chinese food freak. Not the best in the town but definitely you will get good food here.

Good restaurants in Garia are rare to find. Being amazed by such a high rating in zomato, I decided to check this place out and reveal its glory. Went there yesterday to have lunch, the place was quite easy to locate, a few minutes walk from Kavi Nazrul metro station ( thanks to google map though :p ). The place might not give you a great impression from outside, but once you step inside it's a huge spacious place to dine out with your friends and family. There's nothing much to share about their decor, it was neat and simple.
Now let me share my food experience. They offer both Chinese and Thai cuisines. The food we ordered :
#Chicken Tom Yum soup - I absolutely loved the Thai soup. The soup had distinct hot and sour flavour, with fragrant spices and herbs and huge chunks of chicken and mushrooms. Highly Recommended for spicy food lovers.
#Three flavour mixed hakka noodles - Nicely cooked, palatable.
#Fish Kaeng Phed - This is a traditional Bangkok fish red hot curry dish. The curry was quite rich with distinct flavours of coconut and butter. The fish was soft but not a melt in mouth experience. The chef did total justice to the curry. But the dish went bland with the noodle. The staffs should have recommended us to order rice with the curry.
The prices were very reasonable and the quantity was also great. The staffs were nice and attentive. Moreover a good experience and will surely visit again.

Proper restaurants are developing in garia with the increase in demand of fine dining restaurants, red bamboo shoot is another such example of a fine dining restaurant specialised in asian cuisine. The prices here are very reasonable and the quantity is lump sum.
This is a dicey location for non localites, after coming down to garia shitala mandir we take the opposite road entering into the haat area and we go straight untill theres a turn on left which we take and after a few meters we finally get to the restaurant.
We ordered conjee crispy chicken for starter, in mains we had three flavored veg hakka chow, schezwan chicken rice and garlic pepper fish.
The quantity was enough for four of us, coming to the taste noodles was good with flavor seasme oil, smoky flavor and enough veggies. Only thing went wrong was too much oil. The rice was perfectly cooked, also well flavored with schezwan sauce. The fish was basa and the gravy was very tasty with mild flavors of garlic pepper.
The servers very prompt and suggestive, well behaved too. The menu needs to be improved as there are n number of spelling mistakes(which was a bit funny). And they really tried hard to put up an asian theme, but the music was not at all adding on to their hard work unfortunately.
Except these few flaws, it totally deserves the rating for an impeccable food offering and making us happy.

Certainly one of the best places to visit if you are looking for a Chinese cuisine. Located just a few steps inside the road that leads to Boral from Garia. The external appearance might give you a wrong impression about this place. This place is huge. Their menu gives you a fair bit of an idea about the secret to their tasty food as it consists the details about who the chef is. Shankar Rai,who happens to be a chef at 5 star hotels for more than 14 years, is the one who will be preparing the items you order. He might aswel be the owner of this restaurant chain which is popping up it's branches here and there very quickly. The decor is soothing with occasional appearances of bamboo works. The two things here that are sure to impress you are the food they serve and the hospitality received. I have never seen or experienced such hospitality in food joints such as this. These two aforementioned things are surely going to leave a mark in your minds. The items we had ordered were Bar-B-Q Chicken,Conjee Crispy Lamb,Burnt Garlic and Spring Onion Egg Fried Rice,Schezwan Chicken,Mountain Dew,Soda Shikanji. The Bar-B-Q chicken was extremely tasty. It was made extremely spicy as per our requests which had us teardrops rolling down our cheeks. The Conjee Crispy Lamb was the best I had in this city. Soft,crispy and delicious,this dish is sure to make you understand why this place is so highly rated. The fried rice was excellent too. The quantity provided was enormous and it might make 2 people struggle with 1 dish. Hence,order wisely. The Schezwan Chicken was very good too. The gravy and the chicken tasted amazing. The mountain dew was served in a nicely decorated glass. The shikanji was served in a nice container. The presentation of both the drinks is evident in the pictures I am attaching with my review. The drinks acted like a cooler for our stomach full of spicy food. I would love to visit here again and again and I would also recommend this restaurant to all of you reading it. It is one of it's own kind.

Amazing! That's the best word to describe my experience here! Red Bamboo shoot is a Chinese restaurant that is owned by Shankar Rai who has worked as a chef for around 14years in 5 star hotels! I Was quite amazed by the zomato rating of this place hence decided to drop by for lunch today and I do not regret my decision at all!A lovely place if one is on a budget! Quantity of food served is hugeeeeee! Like 1 rice dish is enough for about 3 people with moderate appetite! Yes that's how huge it is! Starters and side dish too come in ample quantity... quality of food too is good! And the service is the best I have ever received from any restaurant! I haven't come across any restaurant ( no matter how top notch it may be) where food is served with so much love and so much care of customers is taken!
Coming to what all I tried today -

1. Bar-B-Q Chicken (INR 170):
10 pieces of boneless chicken at the hottest and tastiest possible concoction...a devine dish for spice lovers! I would not recommend this for the ones who do not prefer spicy dishes as this dish is sure to set one crying!

2.Conjee Crispy Lamb (INR 220): The BEST conjee Crispy Lamb I ever tried! A MUST try! Crispy ,tasty ,somewhat sweet and moderately spicy! Every single taste bud of mine got excited at the very taste of it! Superb is the word for it!!

3.Burnt Garlic and Spring Onion Egg Fried Rice(INR 140): Taken at the waiter's recommendation this is The best fried rice I have ever had in my life! It is just so tasty and flavourful that I could easily have it by itself without a side dish at all! Quantity served is hugeeeeee...

4. Schezwan Chicken (INR 170): this dish too was taken at the waiter's recommendation -Not at all a disappointment- the Chicken sumptuous -soft tasty and juicy-the gravy was loaded with flavours- loved this dish to the bits!

5.Soda Shikanji(INR 50): This drink was ordered only to combat the chilly burn we got in our mouth after trying the above mentioned dishes and I am glad we could taste yet another great item from their menu leaving hardly any doubt if anything in the menu could disappoint us. I loved the cute jar this drink came in!

6.Mountain dew(INR 30): Though it's a packaged soft drink I loved the way they served the drink! It somehow made it seem so much more refreshing!

Overall this restaurant has a great potential to go long way into one of the best food joints in the city! I am utterly impressed with the effort this restaurant has put in- to not only give the best quantity quality and taste given the budget but also the service! I will strongly recommend this place to everyone!

Both the food and the ambience is good. Some people may get misguided by the direction which is spotted with google map, as a hint its opposite to Mitali shangha. The price is reasonable and the quality, taste & quantity is very good! The service is also commendable!            
So some of the items which is worth a try, the panfried momo, I bet its tastier and cheaper than what you will find in 'Wow momo', the starters are also very good like crispy baby corn, the shakes, singapore noodles, chilly butter garlic fish (awesome), shredded chicken red green pepper. Really nice experience so far!

Okay, this is a gem of a restaurant and deserves the rating it has over here on zomato. Visited this restaurant today and I was totally blown away by the fact how good it was. This certainly deserves to be on the hidden gems list. Except for the location everything is just awe-inspiring.

The entrance itself is quite small. But the dining area is very spacious. Dimly lit, soft music, great ambience and spectacular food. I mean what else do you need from a restaurant?
We ordered barbeque chicken and lak-me-kai as entr√©e and both were spectacular dishes. In main course we ordered Losou Lamb, devil's chicken, burnt chilli garlic mixed noodles, and red bamboo rice. Chicken was especially wonderful and other dishes were also good.

It's not often that you visit a restaurant that brings a huge smile on your face. This is exactly what this restaurant did to me. Do not miss this one. Cheers:)

After I had a good experience at their counter in the Chinese Food Festival at CC1, I went along and ordered home delivery from this specific outlet in Garia. The order was confirmed within seconds and the food reached us within 30 minutes flat. That is down right impressive, right there. The food was packed well, which definitely sealed all the steam and aroma inside, keeping the food hot and fresh.

I ordered their Chilli butter garlic prawn and Golden fried prawns. The golden fried prawns are just not the right dish to opt for, when you are getting food delivered, as it tends to get soggy. The case was no different this time, tough it did not lose the crispness altogether, it was definitely compromised upon by the steam inside the container. Can't blame the restaurant for this. The prawn was buttery and soft inside, so a big thumbs up there. The Chilli butter garlic fish managed to bowl me over a second time and i think this is going to become a one of my patent orders here. 

For the main course, we settled for the basic mixed hakka noodles and gravy chilli chicken. Both were well prepared. While the noodles was over laden with proteins, the chilli chicken was soft and succulent. The pieces were decently sized and gravy had the right amount of spice to it. Looking forward to drop in at the restaurant itself.

A beautifully done, tiny restaurant with an extremely cosy ambience. We ordered Three Flavour Noodles and the RBS Special Rice, and Hunan Chicken and Manchurian Chicken to go with it. The items were okay-ish, could have been a bit spicy. But the place surely deserves brownie points for the courteous service of the staff and of course, the decor too.

We ordered from Red Bamboo Shoot through Zomato online delivery. They delivered within 40minutes and their courtesy over phone seemed to be very nice. We ordered chicken momo, fried rice, chicken lak-me-kai, chicken soup and one more chicken item. The food was too good and hot. Their packaging was also appreciative. Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of our food,as we were all busy in eating. The momos were stuffed with sufficient chicken, the soup was awesome and not too watery, I loved the chicken lak-me-kai,it was supper yummy as a
starter. Definitely ordering from here very soon. Next time I want to try Thai and lamb items.

If you very much spiritual n you r in Garia Samshan thinking about etarnity,spirit,life n death just beside Garia Samshan boundary n by chance you look at the outlets gate or sign board n if the door widely open then the smell coming out ¬†will just make you a prithibir manush petuk manush n you go through blindly. Yes this the fact about their food bt not about the price tag n quantity as in this zone within a kilometer you can find at least ¬†200 named n unnamed eating house so there is tough competition.
Decorum with food presentation is ¬†really good n it can be say regarding their quality also.
Now price n quantity cant satisfy me pls think about that as their is many option that area.Oh one thing more there is no pork ------------- eta ekebare jata you may not compromise with price n qualty bt pls introduce the Pork.

Since it is very near to my home, I have tried their food more than once either through take away or home delivery, but unfortunately I have never sat there to dine in the restaurant. But I was just surprised with the quality of food they serve. Typical Chinese and Thai foods which are very close to authentic. And yes, we really enjoy the taste of their food to the core of our hearts. Monfan rice and Meifoon rice noodles are really yummy although burnt garlic and spring onion fried rice could be better. Among the main courses, Kung pao chicken is very good. Other preparations of chicken/fish/lamb/prawns like schezwan/greenchilly/chilly oyster/devil sauces are equally good. In the Thai preparation Kaeng Kiew Yan is a must try. The best part of the outlet are the staffs, who are well educated about the recipes and can suggest the best dishes as per your palate.

I ordered for prawn chow chow rice.  Ambience ok, hospitality was real good, interior was hot and humid, very unpleasant during summer evening. Now the food was disappointing, prawns were like chewing gums served straight from defreezer.  I am scared repeating my visit as I do not want the money going to drains. And real problem is these guys dont want to own up the problem and starts giving excuses. Not recommended.

This place will take you Heaven!!!
Pun intended.
Ask me why it's a pun, because it's situated just opposite to the Garia crematorium.
But that doesn't mean a bummer.
Once you step inside you'll see a nice, spacious interior and with food so good and cheap you'll love this place after all.
The waiters are really courteous,, a tad bit more I must say. They even come each time ¬†when they see the plates empty and ask whether they should serve the food from the bowl. Some may find this to be uncomfortable. But after seeing so much of don't care attitude by waiters at other hot-shot restaurants, this feels like a nice change.
Coming to the food, NO PORK SERVED - now that's a big bummer.
But everything I ordered from the menu was really really good.
Special mentions to the Chilly Mustard Fish, Chili baby corn, lemon honey chicken - they are really lipsmackingly delicious.Now as the icing on the cake, the prices in the menu are inclusive of tax, so your pocket stays really happy too.
In Garia? look no further, this is the check-box you need to check if you're looking for Chinese restaurants!!

Located in Boral, near to Kavi Nazrul metro station and opposite to the Garia crematory ground this particular outlet is nice and cosy. Cosy yet spacious, this one has low lights and a very nice decoration with bamboo just at the entry, also a mentionable aquarium. 

Me with my 2 friends went there on 26th Mat'16. We reached at around 8:00PM so it was near about empty.¬†

We ordered ¬†Bar-B-Q Chicken & Chilly Butter Garlic Fish along with Chicken Burnt Garlic Lemon Soup for starters. The Bar-B-Q chicken tasted awesome. One of the best Bar-B-Q chicken I have ever tested. 10-12 cube pieces along with Bar-b-Q sauce. The Soup was good but too much of coriander leaves were in it. The butter Garlic fish was a thumbs-down. It wasn't spicey, too much crunchy on the outer, lacked the flavour of butter, the onion was not properly saut√©. However, the pieces were big and total 8 in numbers. Hope they will do the needful to make it a hit.

In the main course, we had Steam Rice & Hot Green Bamboo Shoot Curry (we're looking for Hot Red Curry, but they were out of it). It tasted heavenly. With coconut milk and aroma king leaves with 10-12 small pieces of Chicken. With that curry one can eat one entire bowl of rice. Coming to that, the quantity of the rice was great. Enough for 2-3 people. Also, it's fine rice. It has it's own aroma.¬†

We finished this dinner with Darshan with Vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce. 4 scoops ¬†of vanilla ice-cream with darshan was a perfect choice to end the meal.
Huge portion and well made dessert what makes you happy after a delicious dinner.

Will definitely visit them next time for their Chinese menu. till then, happy eating! :)

Two of us went there one Sunday night, just to try out some new place near home. The small entrance must not scare you away. The place is neat and spacious with ample distance between the tables( rare now a days). The staff gives a jovial welcome. The menu is decently extensive and the prices are very reasonable. We ordered fire chicken for starters which was a stick item. It was beautifully peppered with sesame seeds and was just yummy. 8 pieces was just too much for 2 people. For the main course we ordered devil's chicken and burnt coriander rice, both were delicious. The quantity was pretty good and we were happily stuffed. Ps- no taxes!!!! So happy gorging.

We ordered in food from this place on a rainy afternoon through Zomato Order...What impressed me the most about them was their packaging...it came in plastic lids wrapped in cellophane....which made the containers air tight...

Coming to food,we ordered:-

Chicken Lak me Kai-No the traditional Lat Me Kai that one would normally expect,it tasted more like pepper chicken because of the capsicums...Nevertheless,a good starter...

Mixed fried Rice,Chicken Hakka Noodles-Both were good...they were not very oily but tasted pretty well..The quantity is huge(Almost good enough for 3 people)...

Chicken in Celery Wine-This tasted a lot like Hunnan Chicken,had a little taste of wine...but the dish overall was quite impressive...

Finally I have found a Chinese restaurant around my place I can frequently order from!!!

Opted to try red bamboo shoot with the view of tasting some new chinese flavoured dishes. So hence i got my food home delivered. Credit goes to their service since they delivered my order in 40mins only so kudos to them on that part. Well my order consisted of the followng:-

1. Chilli mustard fish= 8 pieces of smokey fish wok tossed in light mustard & chilli along with carrots,tomato & another vegetable(dont know its name). This item is just outstanding!! Once u eat a piece of it you would just savour its taste. Highly recommended.

2. Devil chicken= Diced chicken made in mild tomatoe gravy which a bit too sweet for my liking. Well overall the quantity was very generous.

3. Egg friedrice= normal egg friedrice but very high in quantity. Could be shared easily by 2 people.

4. Burnt chilli garlic chicken friedrice= Good spicy friedrice which tasted great. Quantity on the higher side as well.

Overall i liked their brand of food & all the items on the menu are inclusive of taxes which makes it pocket friendly. Cannot wait to try it again.

Sudden evening get together with childhood buddies and all of us were craving good Chinese. Zomato to the rescue. Two of us went to the restro to get the food packed instead of taking home delivery. The guys were very courteous and even pulled up chairs for us and offered us water before we settled on the order.We chose steamed momos, barbecue chicken, lat me kai, mixed noodles and crispy chicken. Each and every item was delicious and devoured with much gusto.The momos were too good with generous chicken stuffing and the outer coating was very soft. Loved it. Moreover it came with actual chicken soup.not the watered down nonsense which many restaurants serve.Place serves some of the best Chinese.. Period. Be there again real soon.

Easy on the purse - prices less than standard tariff, no other taxes added to the bill (only menu prices)

In summary, excellent food and more than worth the money.
Don't get fooled by the exterior of the restaurant. Also, it's much better than Chowman and Hatari in the Garia area. So, probably the best option for home delivery.

Another well known Chinese restaurant in Garia and yes! it's quite good. Very friendly and courteous staffs. Good food in terms of taste and quantity wise sufficient. We have tried chicken hot and sour soup, pan fried momo and steamed momo. Soup was quite good in taste.Both the momos are stuffed with heavy fillings. The soup they have served with steam momo was really tasty. I never had such tasty soup with momo. We had ordered Slice chicken chilly oyster and schezwan chicken for our home and their packaging was really good. Pieces of chicken were really soft and the amount of gravy was sufficient.

Food: I liked the foods we ordered, except the soup which was covered in broth of egg white, It was the first item (and as they say " First impression .....") but then came the BBQ Chicken in starter and we got settled down. They used leg pieces of chicken (boneless) in all their chicken dishes, which is always recommended but seldom followed by the restaurants, and the burnt flavor of the BBQs was just what required. Quantity wise also very impressive. One plate main course item can be easily shared by 3 people. ¬†¬†

Ambience: The ambiance is good, kids accompanying can enjoy the food along with the free space available inside. This place is real big. We thought a Jumbo size FHD TV inside would have better the ambiance. ¬†

Service: The waiters are very soft spoken and informative, but there are scope for improvements, like - the waiter kept on starring at us while we were dining and and we did not enjoy the attention that much. ¬† ¬†

Price: The price are reasonable for us belonging to the middle class income group. I liked that the price in the menu card are all inclusive of taxes.¬†

You will not regret after paying the bill.

Awesome atmosphere with an excellent manner from the attendants is the key factor. The food quality is quite good (though our food was li'le bit salty).
* Plus Point :- 1. The behaviour of attendant/waiter. They care strongly about you. Even they serve at plate a little part of food for consume and every time you end your food they are ready to come and serve again. Always they notice about your problem.
2. The atmosphere is just awesome.
3. Price of food is enough value for money. Sufficient quantity with the price.
* Minus Point :- 1. They should take more care for cooking.
2. No personal parking space.

I was little surprised. I tried many foods for years but this little restaurant surprises me. Very well decorated, presentations ar quite nice. I recommend it for couples. They know how to serve. Even if you order one ice cream and you are two in number the will divide it when served. I order chowmin, lemon and honey chicken and darshan with ice cream. All are amazing. Really tasty.

Have gotten food delivered from Red Bamboo Shoot Restaurant twice and I was completely bowled over both times. Serving authentic Chinese and Thai delicacies, it's a nice break from your regular boring fried rice-chilli chicken-manchurian fare. The food tastes super amazing and wonderfully unique and extremely well cooked, the portions are more than great and the prices on the menu are very decent and are inclusive of taxes! The Bar-B-Q Chicken is out of the world and also the Chilli Mustard Fish, Steam Fish in Hunan Sauce, Devil's Chicken ( only if you like super spicy food) and the Burnt Garlic Mixed Fried Rice are very much recommended. 
They have a lengthy menu and each and every item on it is available and the delivery time is real quick. The person who took the order was very cordial and helpful too. Would have to visit to find out about the ambience. 
My Mom is not a big fan of Chinese food but even she loved it to bits. üëçüèª

We had ordered 2 mixed meifoon, 2 mixed fried rice, steamed fish in hunan sauce, devil's chicken & lamb in oyster sauce. The home delivery service was good and the guy was polite but most importantly food was great in large quantity. They have exceeded my expectations.  Money's worth :)

Honestly I was a bit skeptical about this restaurant. Therefore, all though ¬†this outlet is at a stone through distance from my home, I kept a bit conservative and ordered online. Egg fried rice, Sliced Chicken with Steamed Onion and Fresh Chilly and Coriander Chicken, nothing Fancy. The First hit was by the delivery person, I don't remember if ¬†I ever have had such hospitality from a delivery person. Second hit was by the packing of foods, looks nice and literally spill proof. Final and lethal strike came from the food. I was just blown away, the quality and quantity was in harmony. I really did not have such nice Chinese in a long time, the so called big shots in the field kept me disappointing. The food here was mild yet bursting with flavors, chicken was so juicy it just melted in mouth. I am literally dripping even now. This restaurant has made into my top 5 list now.

Last week on 6th of November I visited this outlet with a friend. None of us were hungry so thought of having some snacks. We ordered Chicken steamed momo and BBQ chicken . Firstly the restaurant was completely empty. It was quite spacious. So I can't comment about the ambience . The waiters were friendly and prompt. Secondly coming to the food. I loved their chicken momo's soup. It was very filling and yum. The BBQ chicken had the right amount of spice and flavours. 
All in all I was quite pleased with the service. Looking forward to the next dineout experience.

Its a good newly opened restaurant. The ambience is good with nice furnishings and a lot of space. Good music to give u a Chinese feel. Food test is also great atleast as of now. And service is also attentive. As far as p@rice is concern it a mid range Chinese restaurant and thats worth paying as the test is good and quantity served is also quite enough. Overall its a nice place and is worth visiting.

Ordered a chicken thupka for takeaway on 18th evening. When reached home , I saw that it was veg. When I called them up , they told me that they had delivered chicken thupka, as if I was lying. They didn't even apologize .  I have been ordering food from them for past 2 years. I am appalled by their behaviour. I will rather order from HATARI/CHOWMAN in GARIA.

Great taste and authentic Chinese cuisine, quantity is also abundant and yes must say it is pocket friendly. Delivery speed amazed me and an additional 0.5 stars for quick delivery. Haven't visited the restaurant yet so skipping the part of dine in experience. But definitely worth ordering if you want to relish some mouth watering Chinese and Thai cuisine.

In a sentence .... It's mind blowing ! I had very average expectation from this restaurant... But after having my lunch here , dated 24,Nov 2015, I am just blown away ! The food is excellent but the service is even better ! The way the staff spoke to us and behaved I can bet u can't get such service even from a five star hotel ! This restaurant is going to be in favourite list now ! Coming to my order --- I ordered oyster chilly chicken , burnt garlic mixed fried rice and barbecue chicken. All the dishes tasted great. Location wise it's a little confusing . It's near Kavi najrul metro station.

Red Bamboo. You just lost one of your biggest customers in Garia because of your extremely pathetic service. I don't know if the manager goes through these reviews or not but I hope he goes through this.
We have ordered for at least 25 days in the last 30 days and we have ignored small mistakes here and there. But recently they sent me a completely wrong item and when I called them to give the feedback and asked for a replacement this guy called RADHESHYAM says he cannot replace it, which was so unexpected from a restaurant we have been literally ordering daily.
Till date I was becoming a regular with Red Bamboo from Chowman. But now I think I will get back to Chowman again.
Your management should realise that people prefer good behaviour and service even if it as the cost of 10% more money. And hence, I would rather pay 10% more to Chowman than go through this shitty service.
P.S- Red Bamboo you just missed a big order of 50 people for the pujas from our end.

Decent food. But the management of the restaurant doesn't seem to encourage ordering through the Zomato app. They've also stopped accepting online payments since the last one year but it was enabled in the app, due to some miscommunication between the restaurant and Zomato. Hope it has been updated.

I took home delivery from this place, so I have no idea about its ambience. Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Meifoon, Barbeque Chicken and Schezwan lamb. I must say I am really surprised of how good the food tasted. I was really apprehensive about how it would be, considering that location of restaurant is not that posh. Really good Chinese food. Almost at par with Chowman and better than Hatari, all these being in Garia for those people who would like to home deliver.

This restaurant understands that different ingredients of oriental cuisine to be used as per requirements unlike so called "chinese restaurants" which do not go beyond 'chilli chicken' and 'chicken munchurian!' and both in same sauce :p
I tried their lemon coriander chicken, 3 sauce veg, garlic pepper chicken, veg fried rice, burnt chilli hakka noodles and found all dishes beyond my expectations from a restaurant of that locality. I strongly recommend my friends for their food.Their price point is also quite reasonable and affordable.

   I have been fan of this restuarnt since the first time I tasted their momos.I just love their Chicken Steam Momos and the soup that they serve with momos.Apart from this I like Mixed Fried Rice,Barbecue Chicken,Pan Fried Fish,etc.The list is endless.

Have always heard about this place frm some friends staying at kasba for their quality n quantity f food n i must say after having their dishes.. no doubt every buck spent here is worth it. :) atleast to me its best chinese resturant in garia area till nw. The nly problem is that locating it for those who dont belong to the locality can be quite a hassle

I am changing this review. Since last¬†month I ordered twice.¬†first order was of American chopsuey¬†¬†which was horrible that makes u feel like puking.¬†Right now¬†the vat along with service tax that is being added is pretty high. Today I orderd mixed fried rice and devils chicken. chicken¬†dish was way too salty and mixed fired rice lacked the quantity of prawn n chicken they used to¬† provide before. BILL was 400 and I had to pay 480..pretty high. the quality has depreciated hence I feel its better people order from¬†many other similar restaurant with affordable price in the¬†area.

So this is the second time I went here. So this is the new restaurant in the area. It is situated right on the main road but it is very sad to tell you that it does not have a parking space. No parking space even for a motorcycle forget alone the car. It is situated right on boral main road 5 minutes walking distance from the nearest metro kavi nazrul. 
Coming to the cuisines .... It serve only thai and chinese foods. I would love to see indian foods in the menu.
Coming to the ambience its relatively dimly lit. Some bamboo shoots are there in the place to go with the name and yes it is the new type of decoration. Furnitures are of simple steel type and yes they have placed some sofa out there for comfort looking people. Seating capacity at full strength is approx around 20 to 25 . When I went in the evening it was quite crowded but it was sad to see very very less number of waiters out there maybe due to the restaurant is relatively new.
Coming to the food now I ordered only chinese as I didn't want to take risk ordering thai cuisine. Maybe next time I would like to try the thai cuisine. The super my ordered was decent in tastebut voluminous in amount. Yeah starters r tasty  and they were well decorated too. Bbq chicken and  drums of heaven were the best. 
Coming to the main course I ordered mixed fried rice and seczwan chicken. The amount of rice that was in one plate is quite sufficient to feed 3 people easily though they lack in taste. Schezwan chicken was better. There meaning shows quite a variety of chicken items out there but I am yet to try them. As it is quite near to my home I will go there frequently and I will post my update after I try their items one by one. 
They also have some good variety of mocktails In the menu but I didn't try them rather I go for the ice cream which I thought safe. 
Since this is relatively a new restaurant airtel miles to go both in food  and taste. I would really love to watch out for this restaurant in the near future that how it improves or deteriorate. 
Regarding price its average. Behaviour of the staffs are good but they need to increased their staff strength. Order delivery was quite speedy one and yes they do provide home delivery also. 
With this I conclude my review for now but definitely in near future I will update it.
