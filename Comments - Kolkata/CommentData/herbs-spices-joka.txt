This place was the rescuer when no other restaurants we're accepting orders during festive season. This place was like a hit and a miss but we hit near the sweet spot.  We ordered mixed fried rice , Kung Pao chicken , fish Tikka  and drums of heaven. The mixed fried rice was good enough including the excellent quantity provided. It contained prawns , chicken, an omelette layer on top. Kung Pao chicken was sweet in taste but it could have been a bit better. Fish tikka was the star of the meal. The fish meat was tender and was very good in taste. Drums of heaven had very less chicken and more gram flour ( besan ) layer.
The service was very good as the promised food was delivered without any need to interfere.
All in whole, it is difficult to judge which cuisine to go for at this restaurant but Indian cuisine might be a better option here rather than going for Chinese.....

I live in Genexx Valley and the restaurant is located inside the complex, so we mostly get the food delivered itself. The ambience is okay enough for a family outing though. 
Their Mixed Veg is the go-to item whenever my mother isn't in the mood to cook, and it's pretty tasty. The Chinese fare here is quite good; can't say the same about North Indian, which is usually a tad too rich or oily for my liking.

This place is inside the genexx valley complex,the decor of this place is really good compared to many restaurants around. Unfortunately the food quality doesn't stay consistently well,the Indian cuisine that is the tandoor and kebab items has always been bad,that give tandoori chickens absolutely burnt even after requesting to keep it soft and juicy,I'm sure they do not know how to prepare it,kebab pieces for e.g take chicken reshmi kebab,a person will be shocked seeing the size of the chicken pieces,it's so small!
Coming to the Chinese food,it tasted good ,note,it's past tense,it tasted good,but recently it has become very ugly. I loved ordering hot garlic chicken and also hot garlic rice,now it comes with only a bright red color without any taste or flavour, when I eat it simply gives a feeling that I'll fall ill. The chilly chicken and mostly every item has lost it's taste and quality, and most disappointing thing is that they use stale ,rot chicken for the Chinese cuisine,they think adding strong vinegar will manage the smell, but it doesn't at all.
We are residents of genexx and have been regular customers of their restaurant,if they are giving us this quality of product I doubt they'll give any better to customers from outside. Please be sure that this is an honest review and it's intended to help others. Also,if you are ordering online be very strict to instruct and check items when it's delivered they do give less and wrong items often .

I live in Genexx Valley only so this place is like the homely option for me. I love their Chinese food. The kebab items are tasty too. Only the Indian food doesn't taste very good. Their gravies cannot be differentiated, be it a chicken item or a pander item. They taste quite alike. They have many special offers on special occasions. A goop option on Sundays when you don't like cooking.

Herbs & Spices has become way worse. I had ordered so many times before but their last few deliveries have been very disappointing. My last order was dal makhani and naan. Naan wasn't fluffy at all. And the beans in the dal weren't soaked well and gave a bitter taste. 

It's like the management isn't even trying to get better.

2)Nice ambience
3)Can order modified cookings according to needs (less spicy/less oily/...)

Cons
1)Few dishes lack ingredients/flavors (eg. Kashmiri polao lacks cherry/apple; Tandoori roti is not properly made)
2)Herbs & Spices: Found no Herbs' item in the menu

In a nutshell: Good food at an affordable price

I am writing this review out of compulsion. I had to voice my experience to the people who are planning to go or order online from this restaurant. I had ordered online twice from this place and was utterly disappointed on both occasions. First time it was floating in oil fried momos which was devoid of any sauce or ketchup. On complaining, I got an assurance that it won't be repeated. But guess what, they repeated it. And these overpriced momos with all things being okay are not worth it anyways.

I went there with my friends on new year eve. It is the most pathetic restaurant I have been to. Food was very bad, everything tasted bad from starters to main course. We didn't have courage to order desserts. Talking about service it was also very disappointing, worst I have ever seen. He brought food late and brought one starter after the main course. We asked for extra onions, he brought that in his bare hands. We had to repeat our order multiple times to make him understand. It's better to eat at home rather than coming to this place and waste your time and money.

I am permanent customer of herbs & spices because I live at Genexx valley. In the past 30 days their behaviour and food quality become very bad...today I ordered one butter naan, one keema masala, one kashmiri pulao...when the delivery boy came I noticed the oil float out from keema all over the pulao it gives a bad smell and lastly when I saw the bill the keema costs 220 but their menu card shows its 200...why? They should be transparent through the business policy.....last one word very disappointing at all.

In the past two months I have been implicitly disappointed by their service and that's why I had to take down my earlier review where I rated them at 4.5. Food taste has come down to unacceptable levels‚Äã. I ordered chicken momos and they tasted horrible, stale. Their tandoori items have deteriorated. The kababs are always hard or a little on the sweeter side (reshmi kabab).Spring roll was underfried. I like their service staff and ambience but I seriously wonder what has happened to their food.

This review is totally based on their food items in the last couple of months. I seriously hope they consider my complaint.

We ordered a home delivery from this place for some light refreshments at home. It was Crispy Chicken and Veg Pakora. We had orderd online through ZOmato and though it was showed that it will be delivered by 8:01PM, we received no call or any communication from their side whatsoever. After 8:15PM, we thought it was better to call them up ourselves, at which point we were informed that the delivery was in transit. After around 10mins, the delivery person called and we finally received the delivery at around 9PM- way delayed. Coming to the food, it was again not good. The Crsipy Chicken was not much tasty.  Veg Pakora was about okay. So the entire episode did leave a sour taste.@

Tried their Home delivery service twice by now via Zomato Order. Loved their Tandoori Aloo paratha. Non-Oily and nicely cooked, I am a fan of their Aloo Paratha. If they also provide Dahi with it as an accompaniment, it would be heavenly. We also tried Chole Masala and its decent too.¬†
Only complaint I have for them is their Delivery Time. Both times, they were late by atleast 15 mins than their estimated time, which is already 60mins. They need to improve on that.

Been there for a good number of times. The quality of food is sort of moderate, but I prefer home delivery rather than having the food right there. This is because they take quite a good amount of time to serve you your order. Moreover, half of the time they do not have the food I order or want to order, and they keep providing alternatives, which I absolutely dislike. More or less, the quality of food is pretty nice, and it's a - good place to go with your pals. They are pretty polite, and provide good service other than the cases I've already mentioned before. :)

A homly place to have a quite dinner or lunch with family....rates are fare enough and quality of platter not bad for a small scale resedential complex focused restuarant. The tandoori and mughal dishes are worth a try . The chinese cuisines are nothing to brag about.The place can be rented for small parties and they have hoke delivery services too. I would not advise this as a special day out place but a place worth going to when you need a place close to your home for casual dinning. Tje ambience is good and is properly manintained. Situated at the extreme end if the city , the place makes quite some buisness fro@mt he local customers.

So i would like to suggest that do not ask for home delivery as because they are a bit lazy to deliver the food on time.
Coming to the food ----- the quality was good and the quantity with respect to their prices was also OKAY.Overall the food was delicious and the taste was fine.THUMBS UPüëç

A year ago, I could say this was the only decent restaurant near Joka. It is located in gennex valley and serves good food at reasonable prices. Mostly I order for delivery and have been satisfied with the food. But once I went for the dine in, the waiter was really in a hurry. I agree it was post 9 but he came to ask if we want an extra Nan after we had just started eating our meal, and when we said yes, he came in 10 seconds with the cooked Nan. That was a real then off.I would have given more rating.if I had never been a dine in customer.

i am literally stunned :O by the food of herbs & spices !!! i never thought that it would be so much awesome :O ok now lets starts the review!!!

i ordered today 1 plate Chicken Methi Malai and 3 Butter Roti's for lunch :v ^____^ <3

starting off with Chicken Methi Malai uffff what an item it was!! ^______^ <3 thick tasty yummy buttery gravy with pieces of chicken ^_______^ it's kind of butter masala type but it's not :D the surprising factor is the methi saag :D i from childhood knew that methi saag tastes pretty bad almost like karela :v but today i started loving methi saag :v believe me after having 1 plate of this dish you will want to have more plates of it :D 5 out of 5 for this though chicken could be a tad softer!

My father-in-law took us to eat here few days before 2015 was to end. We were there at around 9 PM and opted for the last stretch of sofa seats which could have been a bit taller. For starters we ordered veg manchow soup, baby corn chili, chicken tikka kebab and fish tikka kebab. The fish kebabs arrived very late - maybe they forgot. For the main course we ordered chicken hyderabadi, chicken do pyaza, mushroom masala, paneer handi masala do pyaza, tandoori roti and butter naan. The starter items were pretty good and we lapped it up in no time. The main-course items were also good but had generous use of peas which kind of acted as a taste equalizer :P We had our stomachs full but were pretty content with the quantity and the quality. One can visit the place if one is nearby. Pretty good for the price.

Whenever it is my birthday celebration, or any other occasion like family get-together, it is incomplete without "Herbs & Spices". Located at "Genexx valley" complex at Joka, this restaurant is just a few kilometers away from my place, which is pretty popular for serving delicious food that makes people to opt for this restaurant again and again. And needless to mention that I'm one such person who is extremely satisfied with the quality of food and service they deliver. The ambience and interiors are genuinely nice, and they provide home delivery also(up to a certain distance obviously).
A genuine place to check in for lunch/dinner. And if you want to delight your guests with some mouth watering treats in a party or get-together, you can easily opt for this restaurant without thinking twice.

This was a long time back. Being one of the good places near campus, many of us end up ordering from here many a times. We had ordered in food for a small party of 10 people. At that time, we were not sure about the portions being served but once we got realized that they do serve quite large servings. The taste or the food is unique and you could differentiate one from the other. Regarding their services, it took a long time to deliver the order and once they reached campus with the order, they realized they had missed out on one of them. Though must say, they have a good repository of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, along with various kinds of breads and rice. 

Good for a quick order! But ensure that the order is small to prevent the mistakes.

If you are looking for a good start to your meal then this restaurant awaits you.  With the amazing and balanced ingredients the starters here will lure you to have more and more of them. The item which tops the chart is SPICY BABY CORN.  And the main course will leave you with an instinct to come back soon!  :)

We had been to herbs and spices a couple of times before, and experienced good food. But the third time we went, it was a terrible experience.

The quality of food everything was seriously substandard. First, we ordered manchow soup and paneer tikka kabab (as other items we preferred weren't available). The manchow soup was overly spicy while the kabab was seriously dry. Little did we know that these two were the best dishes we were gonna have that day. We ordered Dal Tadka, and a paneer dish along with rotis and naan. Our dal Tadka resembled dal makhani, as they have a separate dish on their menu called yellow dal Tadka. But they graciously exchanged it. What we got in return was unmashed yellow dal, and very very dry. Also the paneer dish was tasteless. But when we asked, they offered to spice it up. How? By adding more chillies and oil. The rotis were decent. Just ate the rotis with minimum amount of curries and left. And within a couple of hours, all of us had upset stomachs.

So if you are going there, do so at your own risk.

After visiting this place, I actually learnt something. If you are visiting a place after reading the reviews on zomato and then see a couple of user reviews also check how many good restaurants that user has visited. From now on this has become very important for me.

Friday evening after office I decided to go to this place as this is near to my place and located inside Gennex valley. Pretty large seating area but poorly managed. You will notice 2 waiters roaming around and one busy with taking orders. The ambiance of this place being dull. I still had the courage to order something as I had read that the Chinese of this place is great and will not disappoint. 

From the starters I ordered Fried pepper chicken, chicken sweet corn soup. The soup was OK, but the fried pepper chicken was awful On the main course, chicken hakka noddles was full of oil, the Herbs and spices fired rice was something which was difficult to swallow. Schezwan chicken was was pure red in color with hard chunk of chicken meat balls.

Forgot to mention took sharp 40 minutes for them from taking the order to delivery. So take some time with you when you are visiting this place.

I seriously do not know how people have given a 5 rating to this place. There is nothing for which this can receive a 5 rating

A clean and cozy restaurant in Joka. All the 3.0 rating is only for the taste of food. The amount of Chinese food is enormous and enough for three adults. We have ordered Crispy Chicken and Fish pepper salt in starters. Crispy Chicken was not so good. Fish pepper was so so. In main course, we loved the Gravy mixed Noodles. It was a big plate for three of us and was tasty as well. The mixed fried was good too. As a side dish, Sweet and sour fish was Manchurian Chicken was good. I would recommend this restaurant for those who live around Joka looking for a change in taste and bang for the buck.
