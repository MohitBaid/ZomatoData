I was visiting the city and had asked my friends where we can go for good music, food and it should have a microbrewery and Grid was the answer. Besides all of that, the ambiance was really great, it was hard to believe I was still in Kolkata. The place gets packed pretty fast, we had to go early just to get a table and it was worth it.¬†

The ambiance: It was really well made, a blend of steampunk and industrial design, lots of pipes and beams, the place is divided into different sections but didn‚Äôt move around much to see them. 

The Drinks: Besides having a great variety of drinks it did offer four beers from its microbrewery craft range, you can call for a tasting of them, I stuck with caldera, a light, mild tasting one. I hope they get a cider crafted soon. 

The Food: It was yummy, in fact, the ladies in our group came just for dinner, not the music or the drinks. We were a big group and must have ordered over ten dishes, not even one of them was disappointing, all were either good or great. 

The Shisha: Really good, although didn‚Äôt last long, ran out of juice in 30 minutes.

The Music: Loved it, the day I was there, they were mostly playing old hits, by which I mean the songs I use to hear in my school and college days, 90‚Äôs hits, was wondering if the otherwise younger crowd even know of the bands and their music. 

The place to be, only flip side one can‚Äôt talk across the table as the music is loud, got to speak right into the ears to make conversation.

The place has been built nicely with a Gridlock look. The music systems are perfectly placed and of the latest standards. The variety of alcohol served is one of the best I have seen so far. The food in the buffet for a private party is also great. Generally the standards are too low for private parties because people ignore food in these parties but The Grid maintained it at the highest standards. The dessert was amazing. I give thumbs up to everything, from services to food to alcohol and to the ambience and feel as well. Great job, keep it up.

Great place! Great service! Ordered 2 starters which were very very good (Pan Tossed Mushrooms and Crispies) Not the best beers I have had but if it‚Äôs craft, it‚Äôs good! Ordered their Naan roll which was ok. Over all a great place. Vrindawan served with a smile which makes the place even better! Cheers.

Finally a proper brewery in the city. Beautifully done, the place has a calm and composed vibe to it. Even though it's a bit hard to locate the place, it's definitely worth all the hassle. The seating includes both comfy sofas as well as high chairs. Coming to food, as we were in a hurry, couldn't get our hands on all that Grid has to offer. But I made sure to check out their signature brewed beers with an all time favorite fish starter. Amongst the four kinds of Beer - tombolo, piedmont, estuary & caldera, I liked the first and the last the most. The hint of coffee made the Tombolo beer quite strong to taste, while caldera was a smooth and mild one. The Dry Chilli Fish complimented the beers really well. Looking forward to visit soonest and try all the awesome things that are up their sleeves. :)

Back in town after a decade and never imagined the city has grown so immensely. Although the place was short of space due to the excessive Ingres of public but that‚Äôs what you get on a 25 night. Chicken n mix box along with pizza made my tummy full and served as a pretty delicate appetiser. You name it they have it, kamakazi..b52... all shooters n shots made my tipsy and never could I forget to mention the draft beer that they made us taste. Damn nailed it ... Music was a bit loud but the tracks needs improvement n improvisation. Smoking room is congested as it is. Cheers to the night !! ü§®

Kolkata's one of the most happening microbreweries. This place has been on my list for long and trust me I was not disappointed. Great decor, right from the time you step in you know you are going to have a fun time. The lego bar , high seated chairs, awesome music are just an immaculate blend for a perfect time. Absolutely enjoyed the 90s music ka tadka' , food was not bad and their service is pretty commendable. 
Would like go back to this place again !

This boast of being the best and they are right on their part. It serves the best craft beer in town with great quality of food. And Guptaji‚Äôs Toast is a sinful dessert. They also have introduced nitro coffee. Plus ambience is right up to the mark. Service is a bit slow but it‚Äôs okay coz it‚Äôs always too busy. A great quality of crowd is what one can expect from this place and it‚Äôs a plus point they maintain profile for their guests. All together a big thumbs up for you guys.

It is good place for parties. Awesome music. Food is excellent we ordered grid box, test is good but they must be provide us 4 different types of starter but unfortunately we got 3 of varieties 1 item is repeated. But rest of items are fabulous. We tried there beer which is incredible. But over crowded place people are crazy they don't even bother to seat they standing there drinking, dancing totally different types of experience,  once you ordered they will asked to gave your debit or credit cards as there are tremendous crowd they asked it for there accountability which is quite normal. Overall nice experience

The Grid is one of my personal favourites to hangout.
First reason being it is very close to my house and secondly because of the fantastic ambience it provides.
The crowd over there is good but the only problem i found there evrytym i visit is the seating arrangements...i mean half of the place is already reserved all the time.
Having said that, i still love to go to the place because of the food and the hookah...

Been here more than a couple of times, a great atmosphere which just infects you, the place is beautiful with a certain artistic mastery in how the space has been utilised. The place is known for its brewed beers which I frankly find a little too overhyped, I‚Äôm a fan of stout beers and the beer just did not feel stout enough. Probably the hype was cos it was the the only brewery in Kolkata at that point in time, with many more set to come in Kolkata to give this place a run for the money. Food doesn‚Äôt disappoint here though, always have been surprised by the quality and quantity of food. 
People with a distaste of loud music please beware.
Best time in Kolkata was spent here, hope to visit here soon.

If you want the best beer in Kolkata, GO TO THE GRID. I went there last night and had two large 550 ml of brewed beer, Caldera and Estauy. Actually I had Caldera, the yellowish coloured with a mildly citrus taste, and my friend had Estuary, a dark pink coloured with sweet taste.
In food we order lemon chicken and it was one of best I had in some time. 
The ambience is very classy with Lego decoration at the bar tenders table. 
Seats are decent, also not very cosy or private üòÇ
Music is okyish...
Overall the place is must for beer lovers.

A microbrewery in a city that only believed in Kalyani Black Lebel, London Pilsner and Dansberg beer seemed a far flung concept to me. But a visit to The Grid kinda' changed that idea for me I suppose. Well done up place, with a part of it carved out of a real metal shipping container. Vibe is fantastic, music fabulous, although way too loud and thumping for my liking. Unlike any microbrewery this place is certainly not where u can have a conversation, that's for sure. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Food I can't comment, but the only thing we took, kasundi fish fingers were awesome. Unfortunately there are only 4 types of craft beer, out of which the Heffe and American IPA is quite disappointing. But the Belgium wheat and the stout is fantastic and one of the best I have had anywhere in India. Mature, rich and bursting with flavors. Go here if u wanna party, not to have a chit chat. And yes, this is kinda the new party place in Kolkata I believe, with no place to even stand on a Saturday evening, and I am talking of just 9-9.30pm types!! :)

My very 1st visit ever with my spouse on Sat 12th Aug '17. It was just 2 days after my birthday and being a Saturday I was looking forward to an evening of supposed good beer and food. But I walked out within 10 mins. 

Being a Saturday, the place was crowded. We informed at the entrace to the two ladies that we do not mind standing at the bar counter but there was hardly any space. No issues here as we were willing to come some other day.

But the lady herself asked us to go upstairs without even guiding us. We first went to what was a smoking area but came away. Then someone inside directed us to another area which turned out to be a pvt area. When I explained to the service guy there, he very arrogantly told me that we could not sit there. I don't know how I tolerated his tone and controlled myself. This tonto probably thought he owned the club.

We decided to walk out then. At the entrance, though, the ladies were polite, they were quite nonchalant. So what if two people walked out. There were enough people inside who were giving business.

We drove to Country Roads subsequently, another microbrewery. Though, at quite a distance, over there we had a good evening with good beer and food. 

And yes, the difference in service between the two establishments was palpable. I have already been to that place 5 more times since.

Subsequently, I have been reading several feedbacks about their stupid and inverted policies of how the crowd profile should be. Well, it‚Äôs their pub and their rules but I feel people running a pub or for that matter any establishment that sells vice are the least qualified to preach morals.

Regulations such as stags not allowed on weekends; ratio of girls to boys should be same; an air of subtle nonchalance and disinterest if you are just a couple, where they couldn‚Äôt care less if you walk out, only add to the cynicsm that there are other options in the city (existing and coming up), and well, there are.

Suits them. Suits others.

This is the second time I am going out to grid and both the times I was turned down- first time that the kitchen is closing and the second time stating that there is a private party going on.

Given you are present on apps like zomato, you can simply leave a disclaimer to ask customers to call you before they take that effort of making the trip to your restaurant. Or another intelligent thing would be to leave a ribbon on zomato and other food apps that you are booked for today and cannot accommodate customers.

I am deeply disappointed. I was never turned down with such reasons in Calcutta before. It totally takes away the second thought one would want to give otherwise.

If there's a place you want to find yourself in Kolkata to party 'The GRID' is your destination. Architecturally aesthetic with pleasant and efficient staff this is a place that takes you off The GRID and transports you to another dimension. The food has a touch of class and is well complimented with the range of beers available. Step through these doors and let the music take control.

I have visited The Grid mostly on Fridays. Has always been jam-packed.

The ambience, music, food and beer is pretty decent. The pub has the right spirit to compete at the international level. Really happy to discover this pub at Calcutta.

I visit this water hole to gulp a few glasses of Caldera and Tombola.

Had been to these place a few times now... Not easy to locate from a car in normal traffic.. Just at the backside of the Mahindra Car Showroom.. 
This place is kinda the most trending one in the city at this point of time.

Pros:- In-house brewed beers are good to the palate.. Undoubtedly, the best in the city... Choices of other Spirits and Wines are also praiseworthy.. Food is delectable.. Amritsari Aloo was bliss to the taste buds (Advisable to have with beer - namely Caldera or Piedmont).. Other gem of the crown was the Crispies and Wedges.. Service is pretty fast than expected.. 

Cons:- Firstly the location.. As said earlier, thanks to the Mahindra Car Showroom. Ask your cab to drop you off at Mahindra. The place is pretty spacious but then they have this peculiar rules of "No instant Seating" even if the house is almost empty. Let me elaborate, once you enter this place you'll be asked to stand by the bar.. When you ask for seats they tell you all the seats are reserved even when you see 80% of them vacant and even no guest turn up to claim those 'reserved seats' till they close.. If you are smart enough to convince a service boy, they cn get you seats for sure.. And lastly and most importantly, the establishment claims it to be a "Cafe - Brewery - Kitchen" and not a Pub/Nightclub but yet they regulate this irrational & illogical "No stags" rules sometimes... I know this because I was treated differently on various occasion.. One time I visited with some FIFA delegates (all men), they allowed us.. My friends from FIFA liked the food and beers so they planned to go to the same place couple of days later.. This time they stopped us and said "No stags allowed"... It was the most embarrassing thing that happened.. Can you guys please be specific with your club rules?
I have mixed emotions with this place..

Had been hearing a lot about this micro brewery, finally I could make it. It's a pretty cool place with nice ambience & good service. It does pinch your pocket a little but the music is really one of the best in town! So if you want to chill with your group along with good booze & food this is the place to be! Did not much liked the idea of standing tables, few bar stools would have helped I guess! Oh I should mention their mutton wraps.. it's delicious!!

A great place to go out with friends and have the bestest of brewed beer along with some lipsmacking food.
The place is beautifully lit, decor is really nice, the view of the beer brewing machine area adds zing to the place.
I had went to this place on my birthday, all of the staff were so friendly, they took care of the surprise my partner brought for me that day. They presented their own cake with candles, wished me and made my birthday really special.
Now coming to the food, we had ordered the Non veg box which was so filling and the dips were so nice, brewed beer was great, shisha had dense smoke, and fresh lime soda was great and it is mandate for me to wherever I go, so yasss!

This is one of the most forgettable experiences for all the wrong reasons. I have been living and working in Bangalore, which is known for its microbreweries adorning the city streets, and having the relaxed vibe that pubs cannot quite give you. From the time I moved back here (Kolkata) I have been looking for some that would come close. I had visited a few which weren't serving the greatest beer and always wanted to know what's the best microbrewery Kolkata has to offer. And then of course I was told that 'The GRID' is the best that the city has to offer. So on a typical Friday evening, keen to check out this place, I got a few of my colleagues and fellow beer lovers to accompany me, after work. We tried reserving a table on dineout, got an sms confirmation, booked a cab, and headed straight to the place, and everything was perfect till we reached the reception. This was when we were greeted with the worst customer service one would expect from a place that is in the hospitality industry. On telling the person at the reception that we booked a table, we were ridiculed and told that they don't accept any online reservations, suggestively implying we were lying. And that wasn't all, we were told in the same dismissive style that stags cannot be allowed entry into the brewery and we should leave immediately. The amazingly irrational way in which a microbrewery can claim to close itself to a certain demographic is detestable, and the dismissive and utterly hostile way in which they greet potential customers is tremendously disappointing. And to think that all of this happened in a city I have grown up in and have come back to after staying in every other city for sustained periods of time is  deeply disappointing as well. I can only hope that better sense prevails for the management of 'The Grid'  that is in the business of hospitality and customer service.

A worst experience ever that was never expected. U people spoiled my precious bday that comes once in a year. I told on call that I want to cut a cake on my Bday at Grid. They told to come without reservation. After coming they told wait for 3 hours till your bday gets over. How can you people be so cruel minded ? You could have made a prior reservation when I said that cake cutting might need a reservation. I will never suggest people to go to grid. Totally mind and day spoilers.

The food, ambience and service is great. We went there with friends to hangout. I am rating it 4.5 instead of 5 just because of its music. Its music is too loud so if you are planning to hangout with friends you need to shout and talk. Maybe others like this loud music but we did not. We had ordered the Non veg platter which was over priced but the good quality was superb. Never have i eaten so soft and juicy sausages. But the prawn papad served was not good. The pizza here is thin crust one but its delicious. We loved it. Though i am not a beer lover but i found it to be good here. The best part is you get to taste the 4 kinds of beer and then order your drink.The staff is efficient and graceful. So overall, we had a nice time. Highly recommended place to be if you are reading my review.

After a number of visits I am happy to say that this place has rapidly become one of my favorites in town to hang out and/or take people out. With fun desserts, good hookahs, great cocktails and a lavish sunday brunch, it has made its mark as a star player in Kolkata's food scene. I generally get the non-veg appetizer platter, the Guptaji Ka Toast, the Bombay Gymkhana chow, or the rather incredible pizzas they serve here. Also, the Tombolo (stout) from their microbrewery is quite nice and the only one I find gulpable out of a tap.

The Grid is a total winner ! Right from the ambience to the quirky grid structure of the place , it ticks off all boxes. Service is very prompt and unlike most city pubs , the food is pretty spectacular --- Especially the pizzas and the chicken wings. Love this place :)

P.S : Try the dark beer here. You won't regret it

The atmosphere and the vibe of the place is great! The staff is also super friendly and helpful. Also, if you're the one for a good crowd, this place is your call. 
The decor is amazing of the GRID. Really innovative and amazing. 
Coming to the food, it's not that cheap so keep that in mind. I didn't order a lot of stuff. We had Yorkshire Pudding which was bomb. Really good! However, the 'flake' shakes were a total disappointment. I really didn't like the concept of putting too much crushed flavoured cornflakes in your shake and then even garnishing with the same.
I'll visit this place again, and try other food. Overall a good experience.

Recently I visited this place. This is like any other posh pub. But the gripping factor is it's music and ambience. The service and food plating was very well done. The price is a bit in the higher end but it is worth the money.

Visited yesterday with my boyfriend.The ambience is top notch.There is the beer garden,cafe and restaurant section.However we had to seat in the restro section as the beer garden was closed.Then they gave us the four menu cards that is Breweries,Kitchen,Lego Bar and Smoke.We were confused what to order from the breweries section.They provided us four samples which are available in this section.These are all made in the breweries section and belongs to international level.Then we ordered chicken kebabs and then grilled chicken.Tastes yummy.We tasted three different flavors of beer.Then we ordered beer chicken served with herb rice and then finally mudcake which was served with icecream and this is just heaven‚ù§Overall a nice place to hangout and booze‚ù§

Loved the ambience, you step in to a beer brewing station.:-)
You can choose your ambience. I say that as I like you can enter into a lounge, further into a cafe, or a high-end restaurant, or a classy funky bar.
The waiters are dressed according to the theme. The interiors are beautiful and worth adoring. 
Coming to the food, the beer is the best here. I liked the chilli guava juice. The green noodles was delicious (a must try). And the tandoori platter was a repeat order.. It's really filling.  Per head 700-800

Visited the Restaurant on a weekday, it was tough to find because if you miss one road sign of their's, then you would miss the whole building. The ambience was quite okay-ish, have seen better at Monkey Bar. It's dark everywhere, have to see where you put your foot. The service was a bit disarrayed, as the guy who was serving us was vanishing in seconds, and they lacked efficiency once the place filled up. You might have to look around (a lot) for the waiter. Now, they have their own brewery. Even gave us samples to check out their taste. The beers were nice. Had Caldera (which had a fruity punch to it) and Piedmont(a refreshing after taste). For food we ordered some munchies. It was really good. They quite understand the balance of flavours and it was appetizing. 
Overall, an okay-ish experience. A bit on the expensive side but it's worth it. Hop on for a date or a quick hangout with friends if you want to have a sober evening, if you know what I mean.

Coming to the most integral part food; we tried Chilli Chicken, babycorn, chicken tikka naan roll, penne alfredo & chicken crispers along with hazelnut iced coffee & mississipi mud brownie. All the food items were top notch specially the chicken ones & the pasta along with the dessert. 
Their service is commendable & fast. Definitely recommended and hope to be back here (time and again).

Okay, so I heard a lot about this place a lot from my friends and decided to visit this place with my girl.
It is located opposite the Porsche showroom.
As soon as I entered this place it blew my mind. The decoration of this place is something I‚Äôve never seen. The space is huge and I personally loved the decoration with the pipes and the bar counter.
The staffs are pretty friendly and when we entered the place we were escorted to our table. They are very friendly and efficient.
We ordered the Grid Box Non Vegetarian, Shisha and Cold drinks.
The food was absolutely amazing. The kababs were delicious. The presentation of the food was very unique.
The ambience is very soothing.
This place is a must must visit.

The ambience here is definitely one of the most unique ones in the city. We went here to celebrate a birthday party and the sweetest thing about them is they served us a generous portion of chocolate cake to be cut as complementary.Apart from that we had ordered thin crust pizza which was really good,the mixed fries basket and mushroom salt n pepper. For drinks we had chosen from their options for beer and also had order 2 cocktails-one which was a quite strong one and the other creamy and sweet. Overall the experience here was good but just that we found this place a lil over the budget for our pocket.

Very few pubs in kolkata these days redefining the city's pub culture and taking it to the next level slowly which the city needs,and grid is one of them.Spread over a huge space and two different floors this place has got it all it need to wow you as soon as yoy step in.The house beers are a must and the best in the city.Great food and great sheesha as well,great place for the sheesha lovers.The decis is very classy yet very sassy at the same time providing you the typical pub feel along with a artsy touch in everything,the bar is quite widespread as well and you could take a drink sitting in the bar. Loved it to the core.

Went to The Grid yesterday - the last day of their October Beer Fest. Had an ale and a stout with bratwurst.¬† Would recommend strongly to beer fanciers as and when the next festival comes up, or otherwise also, for its very special fare, and for the Sunday brunch.The place has a very distinctive atmosphere with its unique grid lay-out and different levels. The staff is helpful, and there is an atmosphere of cheer and goodwill mainly due to effective lighting, not the gloomy atmosphere favoured by some watering holes. As a micro brewery offering good beer, great food and music, Kolkatans can add it to their list. Many would not know about this tucked away asset, not being on the beaten path.¬† As an oldie I did not feel alien in this younger crowd place, so seniors dont feel shy about sampling the fare - recommended for a week-day visit for seniors, and for the young I'm sure night time rocks.

One has to make a choice between quality food,simple yet reagle decor,innovative sitting patterns and normal restaurants .
This is exactly where you find yourself with one option .....THE GRID.
A an awesome place to hang out with friends .
Its costly and I say its worth it .
The quality is top notch in every sense.
The freshly brewed beer is smooth and tastes so cool.
I tried out candela and tombolo both of which are excellent and unique in terms of taste.
The food is costly but one needs to pay for good right.
So I say out loud to all those people whose doesnt mind paying more to taste quality at its best ...try GRID

We chose ‚ÄúThe Grid‚Äù to be the venue for our Navami lunch (it‚Äôs Durga Puja in Kolkata). Oh boy!! we took a great call. Located near Tapsia More (next to Ganges Ford showroom), The Grid sports a great ambiance, very new for Kolkata ‚Äî haven‚Äôt seen anything quite like it. I was all excited to try out their brewed beer ‚Äî I went with ‚ÄúCaldera‚Äù as it had a nice after essence. For food we had ordered a corn kebab platter (super awesome), pasts (great), and a pizza (good). Finally we ended the grand lunch with the house special Apple Therapy ‚Äî its an apple pie served with Nolen Gur Ice-cream. All in all a great afternoon lunch. Plan to be back soon with group of friends!!

...another time with friends and heading to the Grid yesterday, Panchami afternoon(25/9/17)..
1. Ambience: quite different and innovative....high stools r comfortable too...loved it.
2. Food :...was quite ordinary...they don't have Oyster sauce as reported to me. Served crispy chilli baby corn (ordered) as Manchurian baby corn. Asked for different taste for chicken dish next like Oyster sauce based but except sauy sauce or Manchurian flavour.......then they said they have no Oyster sauce but- will make it a good dish ( 'valo kore baniye debe' )...at this high price point I can't think of such amateurish attitude.
The chicken dish served was greasy, highly spicy roadside kind of lollypops (asked for less spicy, and mind it- asked for WINGS!!!!).....
3. Service:  service was okayish....service boys have no clue regarding food or signature dish. So my experience is... don't pay price for such less volume- high price- inauthentic food.
4. Beer: ....coming to the crafted beer part...their Caldera was good that day- good body, taste and was kicky.
5. Disturbing part is hookah smoke, if you don't like smoke you still have to take that inside your lungs. No separate zone for that.
conclusive part.....so if you have some extra unaccounted bucks, go there for spending ..we had to shelve out 2700/- for 5 *550 ml beers and two side dishes for two persons only... so....you can guess the pricing..!
...and if you are a connoisseur of food, never try Grid for that purpose.
Thanks for reading..

The Pub offers a great ambience alone with its vast menu in food and drinks but what bigs me down to return is that it doesn‚Äôt take reservations on weekends. Yes, it is very normal to not take reservations due to high inflow of customers but when I went to ‚ÄòThe Grid‚Äô; I noticed that half the tables were reserved.

This has not just happened to me but to many others. On asking for a clarification as to why the tables are booked, the concerned executive says that we only take reservations from the MD‚Äôs reference. So half of the place is booked by the people who know the MD. To get into a place you have to suck up to people and get reservations.

The story changes every single time. Sometimes it‚Äôs for some VIP‚Äôs and sometimes it‚Äôs for a group so big that half of the pub is booked. Apparently the group has many factions within themselves because tables are booked all over the place and not at one spot.

By providing such ‚Äòsplendid hospitality‚Äô; ‚ÄòThe Grid‚Äô disappoints the ambience and menu it has to offer.

Okay, this is my third review of The Grid and I'll touch on the pros and cons (good and bad) of my experiences.
The head Manager scores big points with me because he remembered my name when he saw me in a crowded sea of people.@ It was a Friday night and he came up to me and had my table ready to go. Big points...

The food for me is the highlight of my Grid experience. There are some Asian dishes but mostly it's Indian. Yes there is Veg and Non Veg dishes to please everyone. I haven't been disappointed yet by the food and they seem to have that down to a science of good presentation with a layering of complex flavors that keep you wanting more.

The atmosphere is inviting and draws you in to explore the different sides and levels of the establishment.  I've been here a lot and I seem to find something new about it that surprises me each time. 

The staff are great and if you feel like you haven't seen your server in a while, any of the Grid Crew walking around are there to help. It's never been a problem for great service from what I've found. All the staff want you to have a good memorable experience. 

The valet is cool and if I had a car here I'd be loving their service. The valet guys are all very helpful and when I'm getting my Ola or Uber they have helped me with talking to my driver on where to pick me up. Great job Valet! Be sure to tip them!!! 

Okay so one gripe and I don't know if this is going to go away. I hope it does but it's a major distraction to the rest of the experience I've had and it's the MUSIC... I went this last time on a Friday and as promised the music would be better but there seriously needs to be a company policy change with this. Yes the music was slightly better than playing old 80's music before 9pm. Yes there was some more recent music with in the last 5 years played but its seriously a major let down. 
I'm not sure who is giving you advice on what to play but they should be fired! Seriously Grid management there are tons better DJ's around with amazing talent who would keep a really great vibe going without being over the top, if you are overly concerned about being conservative. 
You have all the elements of an amazing 5 star experience but sadly leave me wanting to go somewhere else for better music.

Trying to figure out a cool place for Shisha, I ended up landing here (suggested by a friend) and I totally loved it. The place is chilled out with quite nice crowd around. They have their own brewery and serve few of the best beers in town. The food was decent but the desert was mind blowing. It has a quite interesting and cheesy name and is called as Emotional Atyachaar. It was sinful and an overdose of chocolate with waffles, chocolate ice-cream, chocolate syrup, cookies, cream, Oreos and fererro-rochers but, too good to die for. Loved every bit of this place

This place is like almost on top of my list every weekend when I want to go out. I have never been someone who is fond of alcohol per say but your Caldera has changed my mind as well as my taste buds.. Kudos to you for that.. And the ambience is so different and yet so cool.. I mean attention has been paid to smallest of details and which is a very good thing. 
Now let's come to the food.. I don't know where to even begin with, mushrooms or garlic bread or the casserole.. I mean all are to die for.. I can eat yaha ka khana even after my stomach is full.. It's like so so delicious.. And now the desserts.. Full marks for presentation,  taste and variety.. 
And amazing place to chill with friends and also to enjoy food...

Had heard a lot about it so we planned to make our friendship day special and planned to try it out on 6th August. we were 5 of them 2 girls n 3 guys and when we reached their there was a long waiting list and the guy told u'll have to wait for 1 hr at least ,we knew their would be a rush since it was friendship day. We waited for n hour and went inside to check how long do we need to wait more and in the mean time the guy staff was replaced by a girl and she said you need to wait for 30-40 mins more, we were ok with it and waited for our turn and when it came after another 1 hour the girl refused us entry saying only 2 guys can enter since we have only 2 girls and sent us back. It was a total waste of time n have never been humiliated that much ,we had clarified the guy that we are 5, 2 girls and 3 guys and he was ok with it, such kind of man handling is not expected in places were we love paying heavily to get good service

Visited this place on a Saturday evening and expected to be Jam packed. The food was good and fresh. The quantity of the food can definitely be increased considered the pricing. We ordered Nachos (Sadly they use cornitos and I was expecting fresh made nachos) was very average but Paneer tikka,chilly Paneer,Pan fried mushrooms were amazing. They did not serve non alcoholic beverages which was completely wrong. The waiter himself told that they will not be able to process it. The ambience was good playing music of all kinds to suit everyone. Felt the place is understaffed as ordering food itself takes about 15 mins.However found the place to be good. Will definitely try again !

One word WOW!!!

Ambiance: Best in Kolkata no doubt about that! I have been other best breweries in India and I can say only one brewery comes close to them and that's grid. I was awestruck with their ambiance.. soft music and dim light and beautiful lego bar infront.. 

Food: We ordered Osborne beer among the different choice available. It was fruity once you take it but later on it was bit bitter when you swallow which was mentioned in the menu. We also ordered fish starer don't remember the exact name but it was yummy and quantity was also its good. The cold coffee we ordered had an awesome coffee flavour. Only let down was hookah. Seriously I was disappointed lot with the hookah... no flavour and smoke was also not dense.. also it got finished within an hour. At the price of 550 + 140 tax for hookah it was really not worthy.


Service: Service was fantastic. They dint accept reservation over the phone call or over the app booking. The declined mentioning sold out for the day. But when i arrived the place was not full easily entered inside when i arrived. Receptionist was nice to take us inside and make us seat in a comfortable high table. Also, drinks and food arrived within mins after ordering. Staffs were always available around.

Do not miss it!! I have been to all high end pub lounge in kolkata and it's the best without any doubt.. Price is okay only considering the ambiance and service you get.

Its the best place in that grid of the map for sure. Love fresh beer? Go Grid (I love Tombolo, the beer ;) ). Love amazing crowd? Go Grid. Love great Hookahs? Go Grid (best hookah makers may be). Love good music? Go Grid. Love a good spacious interior? Go Grid, Moderately costly. Amazing smoking room. On weekends, stags stay away, men with women go gaga ;) :D cheers!!!

This place is Wow!!!
Anyone wanst to party in Kolkata, this is the place to be. Forget Park street and its crowded pubs and disco's, The Grid is an amazing place to chill, grab drinks and some truly tasty food. The beer from this microbrewery is at best - OK, cause it seems its not given enough time to ferment properly. At least it gives a kick.
The staff is majorly cooperative, place is refined and ambience is super fun. You can't help but tap your feet to the DJ.
I have been frequenting this place and the crowd is really good. Do try the Smoked Tennessee cocktail.
A big thumbs up to this place full of life.

Perhaps the best brewery in town in terms of beer, ambience , crowd and service. The only challenge one might find on a weekend is to find a table. The price is on a higher side.

Entry was barred to couples, which was good for crowd control.. we went there at 8pm and it was house full. We were able to squeeze in and find a table to gather ourselves after being lost inside.. we started the evening with tequila shots and then took a bottle of J&B, followed by sangria and baileys . Service was slow because of excess crowd.

I had a great time at The Grid. Met a friend of mine after 2years and what a great venue to go to !!!! Absolutely loved it, great decor, simply electrifying ambiance !!!! The way we were welcomed and greeted by the staff was really warm. Good music, food quantity was really enough and sufficient to suffice two foodie !!! Food was tasty and well served. Also the in house beer was really fresh, served chilled, and frothy- all the symbols of a good quality beer !!! Would recommend the Mango drink to all, its awweeesomeeee !!!!! There was a mango drink..forgot the name though but it was fresh...spicy and cold !!!!!! Overall the food quality and quantity was really worth the money you spend for !! The place has managed to pull very good crowd who otherwise would like to loiter in the south typically...!!!! Recommend everyone to go to this place for sure !!!!

A place listed in my queue from long time.

"The Grid"

So me and my friend gave a try on Friday afternoon.

I tried to book a table prior, but they didn't take the reservation, nor informed that no stags are allowed on weekends after 7pm.

Their pub & Their rule

Anyway.. atlast after some heated argument (preferably in english) we entered.

We had to stand by the bar, (one and half hour), because we are the 8th and 9th person in waiting queue of 7 people. So they only have seats to the women accompanying any man. Two men with middle-class attitude, who will bother to give a seat in a over crowded bar or pub.

Coming to the part of food. Starting price of veg items 250 and non veg 350 and goes upto 600/700

We ordeded a lego cocktail, nice decorated glass, served with Jagger.
Home crafted beer, nice and song flavoured.
Big Island iced tea is good, but it can be better.

No bartender are aware, what is the signature cocktails of the place.

As starters we ordered Vietnamese road side style Chili Fish and Two plates of Hostel Style Chicken Pakora served with Chili Mayo, Tartar and Mustard Sause.

This place has long been on my list. Visited on 15th August with a group of friends. The music, the ambience, the food everything is excellent. We ordered 4 items from starter and main course (can't recall the name right now ), 1 mocktail ( some lychee mojito I guess and it was a good suggestion ), 2 redbulls, 1 coke , 1 dessert and hookah. The pork item from main course was delicious. Served with rice ,the portion was good. Also liked grilled fish with mashed potato. But the winner is the dessert "Guptaji Toast". It was Delicious with capital D and the portion was huge enough to be shared by 5 - 6 people. Pricing I found quite reasonable won't burn a hole in purse. 0.5 is deducted for 2 reasons : one is I so wanted to try out that Japanese pork item from starter section which was not available and the other reason is the music was loud so at times it was very difficult to understand what the other person was saying. Loved this place. Looking forward to visit again.

This place was on my list from very long and I wasn't disappointed at all. 
Situated on the topsia road just behind the mahindra showroom, this place has it all!! 
Decor- Right from the entrance you ll know that you are gonna have a good time!!! 
the Lego-Bar is top notch, high seated chairs and dim lights and foot tapping music. Just the blend for a perfect Saturday night . 
They have 2 seating arrangements, one at the ground and another on the 1st floor which is mostly a smoking zone and a lil more private.  

Food- So we ordered the Paneer tikka for starters which so soft and well marinated. Loved it. Next we ordered for the Oven fresh garlic bread with cheese and that was good too. (I wanna have some more while I write this). And lastly we ordered the Juhu Beach noodles which were basically the spiciest noodles I have had. Chilli Garlic noodles made in green chilly sauce and topped with green chillies. (Fire in mouth) and I loved it. It was super! 

Drinks- We ordered for kamikaze shots and it was great followed by LIT and Tequila Sunrise. 
Love the drinks. 

The sheesha was super as well. Ordered for brain freezer and definitely had a great time. 

I will specially mention Tapan, he was serving us and he was very cordial . He even suggested us the drinks and food and was at constant service. 

Grid, can't wait to come back!!!!

One of the best gastropub in the city. This place attracts a huge crowd . Although they don't offer exotic food but the ambience is too good. It is quite spacious.

It was a great first visit at the GRID. Went here with friends, and couldn't stop admiring the design and ambiance of the place. Especially the Grid pipes located on the ceilings were giving the place the extra zing... Now coming to the food, we started off with some craft beers and a fish appetizer. Fish was amazing, beer was heavenly. Another dish prefered was the Chicken steak, which was a bit chewy. Overall experience was worth going a second time.

Located at back side of the ojas building, this place has an amazing ambience with crazy music on the run. My close friends and I went for some hogging and they did not disappoint us at all!

Cheese Garlic bread- A must have. If you want to order just one item, then this is it!

Coriander Noodles- These are green noodles that taste amazing though it has negative reviews as well.

We had two more items, one was a potato based wrap which tasted amazing, while one other dish with a spinach dish which i did not find to be that great.

A must try place though!

Dear management,
Kudos to the wonderful place and the even more wonderful music.
Just one glitch though, you have a very rude and nasty woman standing at the door, she pointed her fingers at our faces and spoke as rudely as one could be. She seemed very proud of the fact that she could stop people from entering and behave like such an unprofessional woman. This is the service industry if you have such "people" at the door it makes you guys look bad. Other than that its an amazing place. My friends and i would really appreciate it if you could look into that woman's behaviour and ask her to keep her attitude at home.
Thanks

On my many recent visits to Calcutta,Grid has been elusive to me since generally you do not get a table here but being a Monday we got it quite easily although it was pretty packed. We thought it wouldn't be too loud but it was. But also its expected out of a bar/restaurant.

What we ordered:

-Corn Kebabs : very good dish. Its succulent and has crunchy bits on top.

-Nachos : i liked the loaded veggies but a little more cheese would be great

-Margharita Pizza : very disappointing 

-Chicken Kebab : average

-Whiskey Sour : pretty well made

The service was good but they went wrong since they got the entire order in a go in like 10 minutes of us getting there. We couldn't even order our second drinks. So a bar should know to pace out the service so people sit and order more. Prices were very nominal.

BEST PLACE IN TOWN! Finally Kolkata has a place where the drinks are fabulous, the food is scrumptious and the desserts are breath taking. This is by far one of the best places I've visited in town. The ambience is great and the music is good too. Their brewery provides a great choice of beers the best being caldera and osborn. The best items on the menu are the juhu gymkhana noodles, philadelphia cheese steaks, naan rolls, bombay sandwich and Emotional Atyachar. Amazing place to be visited by everyone. A must MUST try.

Caldera is normal, but if u wanna try something different try Tambola. Came here at 3pm on a weekday so crowd was less. DJ starts at 7 pm. There is a place you can book for private parties.

The grid is one party spot for any group.
Isn't necessarily for a selective age group.
Located next to vishwakarma building, my experience here was quite a refreshing one.
The set up is beautifully done. With bulbs, lanterns, artificial greenery and the theme of everything as a grid was attractive. The bar counter had several Lego characters and blocks made.
Coming to the service, it was quick. From placing the order to receiving them to even reaching out to them was not at all a tedious task.
The ambience was good with light music and sober lighting.
Coming to food, I had some really crazy food.
Juhu Gymkhana noodles- a must try. A little spicy but well cooked and excellent quantity.
Mitthibai college sandwich- a little variation of vada paw as a sandwich but drool worthy specially because of the cheese.
Mediterranean pizza- nothing different from what was expected but lived upto the mark.
Oven baked garlic bread- The sour dip served with the Garlic bread was a catch. It stood out for me.
Beer- I had ordered Celadre if I'm not wrong (sorry for the spelling though). My only issue was with the service of this. A lot of my food was already done with by the time I received it.
The hookah- I had ordered a gum supari. It was smooth and well made
The coffee tasters were average.
Overall, an amazing experience.
Presentation was good.
Beer could have arrived faster.
To end on a sweet note, the mudpie was amazing.

The front desk was a bit unwelcoming but that was the only negative. The manager Mr. Suman made every effort to ensure that we had an amazing experience. Sarfaraz, the bartender concocted custom drinks to suit our tastes. The music is spot on - a great mix and the perfect volume - background to conversation, instead of being obnoxiously loud. If discouraged by the reception by the hostess, enter forth without worry about the service inside.

The GRID is an amazing hangout, sitting in a more or less uncomfortable area of the city. But once you walk in, you'd think you were in one of the busiest streets of Kolkata! Sitting in the middle of nowhere, it isn't even visible from the main road. But it is totally worth stepping into. Whether it is a Saturday night or a Sunday afternoon.
They brew a very good selection of beers, the "Piedmont" being my favourite. The Bacon Pizza is an absolute hit! Their service is quite impressive, and one of their best policies is that they never stop you at the gate. While the downside could be an awkward point where you are just standing in the middle of a huge crowd, know that the crowd is only there because of how awesome the place is!
One of my favorite joints in the city.

Visited this place one week back with a freind. The best part about this place is the interior decor, the arrangement of the bar with the Lego toys and the courtesy of the staff. The interiors of the place gives a under construction building like feeling. It's another speciality is the micro brewery which offers 4 varieties of beers. First we went for the testers and then decided to go with the "piedmont American blonde beer". Others among the drinks menu included regular cocktails which which wear nicely prepared. We opted for the tried and tested long Island Iced tea. There is a separate dedicated seating for smokers which is rarely found in pubs and restaurants in Kolkata. As far as value for money is concerned the place is worth every penny and I was very satisfied with the visit.

Ambience :
This brewery truly justifies its name where everything is designed and placed in a grid style. Ambience is good with big screens projecting birthday wishes and other stuff which is quite interesting. There is a place for private party as well. Overall this proves to be a happening place in the city.
Food & drinks :
We had special grid box for non-vegetarians, barish wala fish fry, chicken pakora,cosmopolitan, chili mango and Litchi mojito with gulkand. Drinks were good enough to please your tastebud but the food didn't taste that great.
Service:
Disappointed with the service. We had been to the place on a day where there was private party booking. We had to wait nearly one and a half hour at the bar before getting a table. They could have easily managed to give us a table from among the booked area which had empty tables with a request of vacating the table when needed. We were made to wait unnecessarily because of their mismanagement. Later on we were provided a table on the same basis which they could have done way earlier. The people managing the table allotment were not courteous with the service. So I would recommend to book a table before going.
Cost :
Obviously not very budget friendly but definitely worth going because of the look and feel of this trendy cafe brewery.

Finally I got a chance to visit this place after a long wait and really its a pretty nice experience. THE GRID has a perfect ambience of a pub and the place is wide spread. The music is nice and most importantly perfect decibel for a pub. They know that its a Pub not a Disc, which made me love this place more. The food is nice, the brewed beer is nice...service and the behaviour of the people is so nice,..ambience is also good. So, I am rating this place 4.5 only because the Jager bomb was not properly made. Anyway visit this place if you have not yet. I will be in touch with THE GRID for sure. :)

After hearing a lot lot about The Grid, i paid a visit last week. And the decor/ambiance was very energetic. I loved the place   and location of the place (Topsia) was also good.
First of all, it has a parking place which is very important for a car owner.
As you enter, the place is well lit and decorated.
Talking about Service, it was nice and pretty fast.
Coming to food, i must say it has tonnes of options in menu.
Food was nice and nothing special.
All together a great place with great ambiance.

Micro brewery as a concept is still catching up with the people of Kolkata and this place seems to be name worth mentioning. A German, 2 American and 1 UK is what they have in their beer menu apart from a wide variety of other drinks. The bar is well done with Lego pieces all around. The decor is modern but done  up in a way that gives u a garage kinda feeling. Super spacious with ample seating options. And yes for all the smokers around it has a dedicated seating for you which seldom happens. Food quality is good and quantity is even better and service is super quick. 

Having returned to the city after a decade was pleasantly surprised with the place as well as the crowd. I would still rate it as a not very expensive place, probably coz of my experience with similar places in Mumbai. 

And I am surely back again.

I was planning to visit this place since long and at last I managed to visit last weekend. Location is the only part I would say that did not attract me. It is in the ground floor of the ojas banquets. At 6pm we were on waiting and that's the craze of this place, and rightly so the place has its own charm starting from the decor to the menu and even the outfit of the waiters would make you feel something very unique about this restaurant. The food has its own uniqueness, we ordered Tony's egg noodles and believe me it is delicious. We also ordered oven baked garlic bread which was decent but the lotus stem fry was not that tasty. They serve crafts beer from Germany, US and UK and they even allow the guest to taste it before serving. Overall it's a must visit place but yes if you are planning to drop in on a weekend then make sure you reach little early or else you guys have to stand and help yourselves.

The place is amazing and the interiors is a work of art.. the brewery serves good beer the staff is well behaved and courteous.. the Ambience the space the crowd no wonder it has made name and game in quick time.. apart from drinks the sides they serve are also lip smacking and some are finger licking stuff.. my recommendation in drinks would be hogback, cadera, big island iced tea, smoky Tennessee.. and in food it would be keema ghotala, nachos, kirans fried prawn, chili fish and Chicken tikka

The Grid deserves all the hype it has stirred in the last few months. This place carries a queer charm that separates it from other pubs in the city. Ironically, the grid lines untangle and unwinds you.
Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon which was a transition period when the lunch buffet was about to get over and the evening was setting in. The transcendence, that we experienced, from a decent and more sophisticated lunch setup to an out and out dim-lighted foot-tapping peppy environment was pumping life. Not just the ambience but the food was amazing too. Lego bar, brewery and kitchen, nothing disappoints you.
We tried one variety of fresh beer, being a novice, I can't comment much, but it was mild and crisp.
The cocktails, Mexican chocolate and the classic LIT was great. Lychee mojito was so flavorful and refreshing too.
We tried the shisha, Napa Valley, with the fused flavours of pan and fruit, was great.
For the food we tried Crispy Lotus stems, Pan tossed mushrooms, Egg noodles and Naan rolls served with kasundi. The food items, undoubtedly, were very good. 
The desserts were simply sumptuous and sinful.
For people who crave for good food and drinks, would love this place, and with an ambience full of life, this place is a total rocker.
The courteous staff and smooth service adds up to the already happy experience. Highly recommended.

The Grid is the best thing that has happened to "The City of Joy"  in recent times. I fell in love with the decor the moment I entered the place. I loved the beer. Fruity and light. The hookah was also good. Service and food commendable. 

A must visit place for everyone who wants to have a nice time.

We had heard a lot about this pub "The Grid" in topsia, so many good reviews & people going gaga over their craft beers. We are currently based in Dubai and visiting our hometown for a couple of days. We visited this place on a Wednesday evening and the experience was extremely disappointing. The staff is so rude and in dire need of some behavioural training (most basic: how to treat a guest). Though the club was pretty much full but there were some empty tables. When we approached the lady at the reception she told us there are no empty tables but we could get in and find some bar stool. We complied and after a few minutes one of their staff told us to go up to the reception. Now this lady at the reception is extremely rude, disrespectful & has zero courtesy. When we explained that we were asked to get in & find some bar stools she called my husband "LIAR", which was very unprofessional. We have been to all the happening pubs in Kolkata & Dubai as well as in different parts of the globe from Maldives, Malaysia, Georgia, Srilanka to different parts of Europe. This is the WORST PUB we have ever been to. The thumb rule of any business in hospitality sector is to treat your guests with respect & dignity which this so called happening pub is definitely lacking. They should not let people in if the pub is full & they are unable to provide tables. Instead of calling their guests LIARS actually they should not lie about the tables being full when in reality the tables are actually empty. Moreover they should abstain from using insulting & derogatory comments with their guests. Neither we will revisit nor we will recommend this place to anybody ever. And I will make sure I bad mouth this place as far as my network goes.

We heard a great deal about the new micro brewery in Kolkata and we wanted to visit the place. We are visiting Kolkata after sometime and we are based out of Dubai. I must say, I had the 'WORST' service experience here. We visited the place around 9 PM on a Wednesday night and found the place to be quite full. We were told at the gate 'THAT NO TABLES ARE AVAILABLE, BUT WE CAN FIND A BAR STOOL.' This was told to us by the front desk lady, arrogant, rude and extremely hostile, I will come to her later.

Once we entered the pub, we found a place within 3-4 mins where we sat and gave our order.  We waited for atleast 15-20 minutes for the order to come and then a person in suit approached us and asked us to accompany him to the front desk. They asked us to leave the table as other guests were in queue. When we asked the gentleman about why were we allowed to sit there for 15-20 mins at the first place and why did they accept the order, he did not have any answer and the front desk lady even called us 'Liars!'.

I have been to pubs all over the world from New York, Las Vegas, Miami to Singapore, Dubai etc. and all over India, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Bangalore, Hyderabad etc. I have never heard of such a bizarre system, where you are called 'Liar' and asked to leave an occupied table and the food & drinks being taken away. The front desk lady, and the guy in suit were 

1. Unprofessional with zero courtesy

2. There was no decency shown with respect to the fact that two women (along with us) were asked to get up and leave the table. 

3. They were bunch of immature and inexperienced folks with no knowledge of hospitality.

And I was also told that I can go ahead and write a review as 'The GRID' is THE place and people of Calcutta will come here no matter what as they have no other place to go. In short they don't care about social media, branding, hospitality or their 'guest' whom they see as mere cash paying customers at a liquor/water hole.

Excellent place! Have been visiting since it has opened and never been disappointed..brewed beers are fab and so are all the innovative cocktails they come up with. Saturday night is always booked here for me and so are the brunches! Brunches are probably the best in Kolkata for the variety they offer. Hookah is fab too. I need to always order a hookah when I'm here. Most flavours are available and service is prompt! Kudos to the entire team!

I had been waiting since a long time before I could visit this place and was surely not dissappointed. On a fine sunday evening, I visited the place along with my friends and found the ambience quite lively and innovative. Good music accompanied by good food was just that we wanted. However, we couldn't get a table as the place was packed. We ordered a Junos Pizza which was a thin crust pizza with enerous amount of toppings along with cocktails. I would definitely want to give this place a second visit.

Topsia is not exactly known for being a leader in the bar movement for The Grid is definitely a surprising addition to the neighborhood. The theme is influenced by shipping containers and the place has a vibe cool enough to make you forget you are in Calcutta. They have a pretty extensive drink menu with a number of craft beers and signature cocktails. The food menu is more what you'd expect for a bar with an interesting list of multi cuisine starters but a lack of exciting mains. Also, be aware that much of the food menu is unavailable except at meal times.

I tried their stout which I initially loved because I was taken aback by the very availability of craft beer in Calcutta but on second thought the beer tasted a little watery and could have been much smoother. I also got the vegetarian grid box appetizer which had chili fried baby corn, spring rolls, and onion pakoras all of which tasted fine but not particularly great.¬†

Special mention: The free and easy to use breathalyzer located outside the bar. It might be gimmicky but it seems like The Grid is actually trying to condemn drunk driving and find patrons alternatives such as an Uber booking desk. Super commendable and I hope other bars in Kolkata follow suit.

The front of house staff at The Grid needs to CALM down and also be much more familiar with their¬†offerings. The hostess got into a tizzy about a number of irrelevant things such as under 21s not being allowed in after 6 (it was only 5 PM at the time and I was with my clearly middle-aged parents but she was still extremely flustered till I found some id) and offering us a table on the condition we vacate by 7:30 telling us the place was really full (again it was 5 PM and only a handful of other tables were occupied). Calling them to make a reservation for Sunday brunch was a similar ordeal dealing with a different equally flustered and confused staff member.

Innovative craft beers. A couple of them were a bit sweet and fruity for my liking, but full marks for innovation, many of them weren't like anything I've ever tasted at breweries before.¬†The ambience is knockout. Perfectly laid out underground feel with futuristic touch (the home display over the bar counter looks like a hologram!) with some serious "back-in-the-day" music and lit perfectly. Food was ample and well laid out. A couple of options from the menu weren't available which was a bummer. Rue the lack of photos taken.

Had always been hearing a lot about this place in a not so lively locality like Topsia, so decided to walk-in one day. The following are my observations and experiences in "The GRID".
The entrance to the restaurant is very well crafted and after walking in, the decor and ambience are spectacular. Pretty well-designed interiors which give it a semi-urban look. A very lively ambience with pretty loud music which doesn't favour much talking, but only enjoying. ¬†
Now coming to the food, the quality and quantity of the dishes were absolutely amazing.¬†
Service is pretty slow, but I guess that's because they need to attend to quite a lot of people. Otherwise, its one of the most recommended place for casual dining with friends or larger groups.

The food and ambience is great but I don't know why people haven't mentioned about their home brewed beer yet. Kolkata really needed such a place having its own microbrewery. They offer a choice of four brews from a light refreshing to fruity to a fulsome dark stout. Pricing is very decent and a 550ml pint costs around 300 bucks. 

The place is hard to locate at first. Landmark is Mahindra Showroom. Definitely worth a revisit!

Modern and trippy ‚Äì The GRID

Recently I had been hearing a lot about this new place in town, The GRID. So inevitably I had to be there on a weekend evening. I must admit I had a really tough time locating the place, but with a little bit of help from Google maps I was finally there. First impression! I felt as if the whole of Kolkata was there. There was a waiting for a minimum 30 mins, so we requested a place at the bar, without a stool that too.

The Space: After I entered, the place kind of messes up with your eyes, it is huge, has a big brewery indoors separated from the main space though, there is an upper and a lower deck, there are these intersecting grids, so altogether at one go it is a lot to take in but in a ‚Äògood way‚Äô. The look is very modern and urban, even the washroom is simple yet modern. They even have a section for the DJ on a upper deck which makes it way cooler. The music is super a mix of old 80‚Äôs classics, EDM and pop, trippy and absolutely what is required with some hookah and tipsy drinks.

Food and Drinks: As I mentioned we found a corner spot at the bar and after 10 mins could manage to find a high chair to sit, we ordered at the bar itself, we started with shisha (hookah) and cocktails, I ordered for Long Island Ice tea, Beer from the brewery was definitely a must try. For food we started off with loaded Nachos. Th drinks were pretty cool, so was the shisha and nachos, it was plate full of loaded chicken nachos. After almost 30 mins we finally found a table for ourselves. Next we ordered pork and prawns and a non-veg platter, I must admit their take on the continental food is way better than the chinese, we all know there is enough yummy chinese food in Kolkata, so maybe this is not where you should have it, so for the other cuisines. Although I have not tried yet, but they offer buffets too.

Watch-out for:  I must add, watchout for the fact that they when we ordered at the bar either you pay then and there or you need to deposit your card at the counter. Now this is something I did not like. I have been to a lot of places but parting away with my card did not seem too cool to me. But I guess rules are rules!

Be early or expect a waiting time on weekends.

Pocket Pinch: Well we all know drinking outside is an expensive affair. Be ready to shell out anything above Rs 2500 for a couple having food and drinks.

I must add though that I am super happy that such a chic place is finally here in town!

I have been to Grid couple of times and have had amazing times. This was the first time I was at the bar with 3 cousins. We again had an amazing time but at the end Sarfaraz, the bar tender overbilled us for 10 more beers. The bill said - 22 large pints with other food. It is impossible to share 22 large pints with 4 people and still be so sober.  We had12 pints and we were billed for 22 pints. I had given my card for first order at the bar and then asked for bill at the end. It had 10 more pints. We had to fight for more than 1 hour to get it cleared but they kept it delaying for no reason.

I finally got it cleared for a bill less which has 10 less pints. Even after having a great time we were super pissed off. NEVER EVER GIVE YOUR CARD TO BAR TENDERS AT GRID at the start. Just pay instantly and get it cleared every time you order.

Why 3..Because they dont give you table even when the restaurant is half empty. We went there at 8pm and were told that there is no available table but we can wait at the Lego Bar...hmm good strategy to make you stand eat and pay the bill while the other half of the restaurant is empty and all the while we were there ( couple of hours) no one occupied them..The waiters and bar tenders were really nice people. After a long time got great brew in Kolkata..and the food is sumptuous too. But come on...what type of restaurant makes you stand@ even when there are tables empty..

Located opposite to the Porshe showroom on the Science City Park Circus connector, The Grid is not too difficult to spot. The entry however is a bit tricky and u have to take the left side road all the way. Once inside the place transforms you, you feel like you have entered a very happening basement kind of a place. The decor is fabulously done and you instantly take a liking to the place. We went after office on a Thursday night and yet we had to wait for 15-20mins to get a table. We loitered at the bar and had a taste of some of their beers. Once seated we ordered ourselves the Non Veg platter and Pizza alongwith some cocktails and a beer. I won't say the service was prompt but it wasn't too shabby either taking into account that they were serving a capacity crowd. The food was surprisingly good for a pour House. We also had a hookah. Then we ordered some Pork and Prawns. The prawns were good, however the pork was just delicious(you have to try that,it comes on the backside of their "kitchen" menu) and it got polished off the plate in no time. And yes, the music was a mood setter as they were belting all the chart topping slightly older songs, the songs we have grown up with, absolutely loved it.
I loved the place and would look forward to visiting them again and again.

This place has some of the beer in the city. The 'nolen gurer' beer is quite a novel invention. I liked the food though the amount can be worked on. The decor of the place is quite interesting, the blocks all over, the beer breweries in the background and the bar design all make for a wholesome dronking experience. We got a couple of chef's special drinks one with cocnut and vodka which was really nice.

The GRID was amazing- the decor, ambience, the vibe this place gives - everything is just brilliant. We had gone for the Sunday brunch and if you are looking for a lazy brunch destination this is not the place. Even on a Sunday afternoon it was super packed, we barely managed to get a place in the smoking area. However, the super vibrant atmosphere, great music, great crowd doesn't disappoint you. The spread was a tad bit limited, but then again it's pretty cheap too, so pretty good for the money. The food was good, not amazing as such, the staff extremely helpful and polite. Am yet to go here on a Friday night but I have only heard amazing things bout this place. Good crowd, good vibes - this is the highlight of this place and on those lines it is one of the best places I have ever been in Kolkata. Will definitely be back again.

Great ambience, thanks to the decor, the music, and a lively crowd. The only disadvantage is it's always packed to the brim, so finding a table is challenging. Enjoyed the caldera beer. The pork sausages were tasty, and my friends enjoyed the veg platter, particularly the fried baby corn. Overall, a good choice if you are looking to be at a hip joint and enjoy some good beer and hookah.

The food here was good. Full marks for the decor. Prompt n courteous staff

But what irked me the most was this place doesn't make you feel welcome. Nope. Nada. None at all. 
We were a group of four who went there to celebrate my jiju's birthday. We were made to wait for 15-20 minutes n when we entered inside, we found so many empty tables. On enquiring about it, we were told those tables are reserved. Well, there wasn't any "reserved" tag on the table. Moreover, we spent more than an hour over there. N all that time, those tables remained empty
Will visit next time but only for the delicious food

I must mention that despite the rush, their service did impress me. When it comes to food I tried the Babycorn Agarwal and Pork Sausages which were really very tasty and cooked to perfection. Their beers are a must try.

I strongly recommend this place and will definitely visit again.

I have been to this place multiple times and everytime I enter this place I get new vibes..Staff is so much courteous and they make sure that you have the best experience over here..Sheesha is totally out of this world must try Royal Paan which is a mix of different flavours.. With brewery now up and running ppl are enjoying it to the core..

So I'll tell you what impressed me the most both the times I visited this place. It was the service. I mean there are a lot of places dishing out good food, but these guys go that extra step in making sure that you don't have regrets about coming here. Waiters are friendly and provide you with useful suggestions. The chef personally came out when we weren't too happy with something. They change what you don't like, no questions asked. This pork which we had ordered was taken from the belly which wasn't explained in the menu. The chef came out, politely explained that to us, said a sorry, suggested another item and that was it. And what we got after that was amazing. I mean that is how you endear your establishment to people. A cocktail didn't work for us and it was changed. And all this on a ridiculously crowded Monday. The food is really good. Perhaps certain things could improve. The non veg sharing platter could certain do with a more even quantity. Had four pieces of fish and three of chicken. Got a bit confusing. I mean I would probably have a few more things on it altogether. Just seemed meh. Just not enough to call it a sharing platter. Two can't share it equally and neither can four. Rest was really good. The quality of fish is exceptional. The pork sausages were brilliantly cooked. Also the beer. Finally a place which serves good beer in Kolkata. The stout is my favorite here and it's almost as good as you would get it in Doolally, which is my absolute favorite anywhere. I was actually so impressed that I ended up applying for an internship in their kitchen. That was the fun bit!

The best place to hang out in Kolkata if you are looking for a classy ambience that doesn't completely burn out your wallet.

The food is delicious.
The signature beers come in four varieties and sufficient quantity for the price. There's something to suit every beer lover.
The staff is friendly and courteous.
The ambience and interior is fabulous.
The location is very convenient -right on topsia more in the Haute Street building beside The Tiffin.

If there was one fault, it would be that the place tends to get very overcrowded in the evenings despite the commendable efforts of the staff and managers to control the rush.

Did it last Friday, so had to do it this Friday as well ! Believe me, if somebody had blindfolded me and taken me around for 3-4 hours, I wouldn't have believed this was in Kolkata. GRID is the amalgamation of everything good in this country. It has the pub culture of Bangalore, the brews of Sector 29 Gurgaon, the music from Goa, the crowd of GK II, and the upmarket feel of a Mumbai gastropub !
Place is very well put together with excellent ambient lighting and very friendly, competent staff.
I have become a fan of their Piedmont brew with crumb fried fish!
Also good are Bhindibazar Chicken, Babycorn Agarwal and Jamaican Jerked Chicken Pizza.
And the best part is that it is only a 20 mins drive from Salt Lake !!

Dont see any reason to rate the place below 5. Beautiful interiors, mouth watering food and good music. The service can improve a tad but then place is mostly jam packed and the service staff is always running arnd.

We ordered a grilled chicken and a pizza followed by mud pie and another chocolate dessert i cannot recall the name of. The grilled chicken was soft, served with a side mashed potatoes and was the ace dish. Pizza was good and the desserts were to die for. I am definitely coming back..and soon :)

When you thik about craft beer in kolkata, The GRID is the name. Visited many times and every time they satisfied with their pleasent & fast service. They have awesome varieties of beer.The interior of the club will blow your mind. Food is quite nice,specially chicken preparatio. Music is up to date. They also have very good place for private parties.overall the place will boost your mood.
Would suggest everyone just try once, and you will visit again & again.

1st off all not easy to find, if you are not aware of the location then you may end up landing in a Mahendra showroom!!
Well, GRID is situated at the backside of the Mahendra showroom.
I am going to recommend it for the microbrewery Option, as well as they serve hookahs. They have smartly decorated the place. You are bound to feel that some constructions are going inside because of the interior and obviously for the dress code.
And a big round of applause for the artists for all the brilliant art works‚Äã. 
At first they will provide all kinds of beer from the microbrewery for tasting purpose. Once you decide they will serve the beer according to your choice. Apart from beer I tried a fish and a chicken preparation which was good. Some of my friends also tried pork which was very spicy but tasted good with beer. Lastly I ordered a mocktail named Litchi Gulkand that was the show stopper. I must admit that the mocktail stole all the limelight.
Service was quick and prompt. Price is little on higher side but satisfying.

We went here on a Tuesday afternoon. We ordered craft beer, grid crispies, baarish Wala fish fries and spaghetti aglio e olio. 

The craft beer is very good. You certainly won't get a taste like it in most other places and it's worth coming to grid for. We ordered two full pints of the Stout and it lived up to it's billing. 

The starters here are awesome too. I would definitely recommend the grid crispies to anyone who visits this place. The dippings they come with are awesome, and form the perfect combination. 
The baarish Wala fish fries were very well made. I especially liked the kashundi dip. The fries themselves tasted very good. 
The spaghetti was a bit too intense but the taste was good. 
The decor is simple yet leaves an impression on you. The music too creates a nice setting but isn't loud enough to interrupt a friendly conversation. The service was prompt and friendly as well. 
Would definitely recommend this place for a nice meal over a mug of beer.

The service is very poor ! They keep accepting people as they walk in but are not able to provide any service ! My beer came after an hour of waiting and repeatedly asking them but their staff and managers are not capable enough to handle it well ! My worst experience in any brewery till today ! They had shortage of beer mugs to even serve. My advice don't accept people if you cannot provide service and give importance to people who walk in !

Having a lot of expectations, we visited this place, and we were left quite disappointed.
The menu was absurd and made no sense; moreover there wasn't any other options for beer available except brewed, which was a disappointment too! 
Bad food, bad beer, definitely not worth it.

Extremely well decked up and perfect usage of space to include all necessaries. However, with the progress of the hour, the place begins to get really crammed up and that's not exactly a desirable. My personal opinion is to maintain a head count to ensure a good time for people.
However, that done, the food and alcohol are extremely well made. Service of the staff, who have this amazing uniform, is also at par. Making drinks to your personal taste becomes easier because of the flexibility of the staff and that is the biggest plus.

Been here many times and has been one of my favourite place until yesterday when we made booking of 10 people and 3 of them didn't get a chair ·π≠o sit... one of the captain did accommodate with 2 chairs but later when we asked the other server to help us with one more chair as we had a booking of ten people... he replied us rudely and said there are no more chairs and you have to stand till the end of your meal.
Our whole good  experience at this place turned into a negative one as how can be expect the guests to be not seated.
The management seriously needs to check on these kind of experiences otherwise it will create a bad name for itself.

Regards
Rahul

My first time in Kolkata. Heard good things about this place. I tried phoning up to simply ask do they have bookings or not and if not how long must one expect to wait. This Rude lady refused to let me speak and was not at all being helpful. How unprofessional are you're staff and have they been trained to have some basic mannerisms? Such people should be fired since they just ruin you're brand and reputation. Anyway you just lost business of 10 people and we had a 1.5L budget for tonight for a celebration tonight. You're loss

We were in Kolkata for a weekend and we fell in love with this place so much so that we went there back to back once for clubbing and then for brunch the following day! The Grid is a microbrewery and being a Saturday night, the place was completely PACKED! Forget about getting a table, we couldn't get our drinks despite standing at the bar for about half and hour. The drinks did finally come and the beer tasted just so good! Ambience and music of the whole place was really good and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The following day we went there for a family brunch and trust me it was worth every money spent. Such an elaborate spread and that too with alcohol included :-D. The spread had everything starting from eggs, cold cuts, main course and ending with chocolate fountain and other delectable desserts.

There are very few outlets giving the experience like the Grid does. The music is upto date and the food is also quite delectable. The awesome variety of beer is to die for and so is the eclectic variety of the food available there. Another must try are sheesha and the deserts. A must try for all young peeps and those young at heart. I am sure to #jointhegrid

Date of Visit: 14/05/17

This place has been on my fiance and my must-visit list for a while but unfortunately, it turned out to be disappointing. We faced a bad experience right from the reservation phase. My fiance had reserved for the Sunday brunch through Dineout but apparently, all reservations made through Dineout are put on the waiting list irrespective of the availability and I got to know this only after calling them up for a confirmation. So, why to keep a reservation option at Dineout?
Next, when I called them up directly for a reservation for 7th May, a lady picked up and she took all my details and mobile number and informed me that she will give me a call in about an hour or so and let me know whether they have a free table. I have still not received THAT call! Even if you don't have a table free, you're supposed to call the customer up and let them know! Pathetic customer service. So, after not getting a call for another 2-3 days, I called them up again. Some other lady picked up this time and apparently, my details were not taken for reservation when I called up last time!! Anyway, since my fiance really wanted to visit this place, I didn't get into an argument and just asked whether I could get a reservation for 14th May and finally this is how I struggled through to get a reservation.¬†

Well, this wasn't the end of our misery. Since, I reserved the table for 12pm and they informed me that the waiting period is only 10 minutes so we reached 15 minutes early. We were gladly waiting outside and then the security by mistake let us in before time. I even inquired whether it's open. He said yes, so we entered. Then I told a person from the management that we have a reservation at 12. He said we open at 12 and just walked away. We were left standing there. Then my fiance asked another person from management that are we supposed to just stand here, he said "Yes" in a very rude and blunt way. My fiance was shocked at this response and asked again that are we supposed to just stand here. Only then did he tell us to wait in the lobby. While waiting in the lobby, we see the security coming back and locking the entrance door again. ¬†I understand that there must have been some internal miscommunication but they take out all the irritation on their guests. Way to go!

Decor/Ambiance: I loved the decor. They have put in a lot of effort to make it look like a grid! Even though, I loved the selection of songs played by the DJ, the music was too loud for a brunch. People are supposed to be having a conversation at a brunch but unless you scream at the top your voice, the person sitting opposite to you won't be able to hear anything. Also, the temperatures inside weren't comfortable at all. ¬†Our table was right under an AC and we were literally freezing. Even after they increased the temperature of the AC above us, it didn't work out much and it was still very cold. I had a bad headache after coming out.¬†

Servers/Service: Although I had a problem with the management for their conduct, I was very happy with the service offered by one of the servers called Shubhankar. He deserves a special mention because he was so friendly and helpful. He guided us through the whole Sunday Brunch process. For some reason, the live milkshake counter was closed but since I wanted to try out a milkshake, he actually took the order and brought it for me. :D

Food: They offer 4 different kinds of beer for tasting - Caldera, Osborn, Piedmont, Tombolo and offer the repeat of any one of the beers whichever you ask them to. Coming to the food, the starters were really good. I loved the chicken, felafel salad and chicken cold cuts. The main course was average. Nothing made me go wow. The desserts were good. Unfortunately, I couldn't try out the ice-cream sundae because I was uncomfortable with the room temperature.¬†

Overall Feedback: I feel this place is overrated. Moreover, I don't think I would like to go back to a place where the guest isn't welcomed properly.

One of the first decent breweries in Kolkata. The space is huge capable of accommodating a large number of people. Food is good. Quantity is generous. Weekends are crowded.

I honestly think that there should be a separate place for hookah takers because it's a family friendly place and you see kids there almost all the time and I really don't like the fact that I'm sitting in the same room as a five year old and having hookah. It probably isn't a big deal but it sounds terrible to me.
The food and drinks were up to the mark, but the hookah was S H I T but unlike most places, I actually enjoyed the music here.
Also, I really like the fact that they have such a detailed menu.

So my very first visit to grid was when it just opened, there was no tap beer and we found the drinks and service very average. Cut to 2 months back, when we decided to give it a second shot. And boy has this place tranaformed. The service is excellent and sharp, the cocktails potent, the beer especially the Caldera so fresh and the Mla hostel chicken pakoda succulent and spicy all at the same time. Have been going there every weekend for the last 2 months and the place is gorgeous with a lovely energetic vibe. Truly one of the few places in the city which makes you go wow, not just because of the decor but also because of the energetic and motivated service team and management.

Big thumbs up.

It is located in topsia hautee street building has a really great vibe, they have also started with a microbrewery and serve 4 type of beer currently. The servers know their menu in and out and will recommend you their best dishes have visited on a numerous occasions and never was i disappointed. Really love their grid box, paneer rolls, pizzas. Tried their cocktail as well which was made perfectly the place is huge probably the biggest in town. During weekends the place will be very crowded and you will not get a table to sit but it's all worth it. This place is changing the nightlife structure in Kolkata, and they have been very consistent in their preparations. 
Great job by the management.

Went with my friends after recommendations. It was a full throttle day with their amazing ambience and music. The Caldera brewed beer was good to taste and the fish was amazing. Little on the higher pricing but the quantity they serve was good. If they can maintain this standard then they should become the best destinations. Super experience.

Finally a microbrewery in Kolkata that's worthy of being called a "Microbrewery". Add on to that, it's got one of the best interiors and designs. Minimal lights and awesome layouts. Ayaz Basrai, the guy behind the top notch interiors. The place also sports a shipping container design. It's got a rare combination of microbrewery with hookah. That itself is a huge footfall magnet. The craft beer is served in 4 different flavours. Estuary being my favourite. The attendants offer you to try the beer first before ordering which is a standard in every brewery. The food is good, whatever little we tried. The grid box is my favourite which is worth trying.   They don't have a dance floor but you have the entire floor space to spin and sway. Been here twice on Saturdays and this place gives you a high. The footfall is crazy on Saturdays and there is every chance you won't get a table if you walk in anytime past 9. It's a beer drinkers best buddy. In a nutshell, it's a must for everyone.

Loved the freshly brewed beers and the food. 
Little dissapointed with dessert. One waffle dish and guptaji toast..Not upto the mark. Except that all was good. Good portions. Moderately priced. And the menu naming convention was interesting!!
Will recommend and also will visit again.

Went for Sunday brunch. It is located on the topsia road. It is recommended to make a reservation for the same before going as this place can get full even on a sunday afternoon. Brunch comes with two option - with Alcohol and without Alcohol. If you are going for with alcohol option, then you can repeat order any one type of drink i.e. between brewed beer or red/white wine or any one cocktail.¬† They are currently offering four types of brewed beer. My personal fav was Caldera and Estuary. Overall feel of the place, service, and music all are excellent. However brunch was a tad disappointing specially the main course for Veg. Pizza could have been better as well. Hopefully they will work on the food department a bit more and hence deducting 0.5 for the same.

Went there on a Sunday evening to a full house. After waiting for around 20 mins at the bar counter we were provided a table. The ambience , music and the large screen all make up for a very nice and warm experience. The sheesah was very good . We hard ordered for a softer base and kiwi sheeshah was indeed good. On the food menu the punjabi style chilli chicken was lim smacking and is sure to be loved by the hot and spicy lovers. The prawn curry with rice had a South Indian Touch. Nice. On to the drinks, I had the rocket fuel which looked like a the Pepsi blue or a the kerosene. Nice and smooth. 
The davidoff Cool water is another non alcoholic beverage that is really refreshing.

Only minus is the type of alcohol that they give . When you are charging a this heavy for cocktails you better give some premium whiskeys of the level of anitiqyity or eqv. Blenders pride on a cocktail was a tad disappointing.

Overall highly recommended.

One of the hottest pubs in Kolkata right now, and it comes with its own brewery too!

The ambience is excellent - the theme of an underlit power grid, with pipes, lego blocks and the behind the bar glass wall doubling up as a screen. 

Music is amazing! Not foo many pubs in Kolkata play Pink Floyd and Guns n Roses and Iron Maiden... The last time we went there, we had to stand at the bar the whole time because the place was filled to the brim - and we were completely content with just standing and drinking and moving to the beat, such is the charm of the place.

The craft beer is one of the best I have had on Kolkata - try the Belgian and the Scottish! The finger food is ultimate - the Baarish wallah Chakna and the Bengali style Fish Finger in Kashundi was too good. They do have an elaborate bar menu, but a lot of items are not available, so that's my only issue with the place. 

Just got to say, I'm proud my city has such a place to hang out!!

One of the most happening dens in town, The Grid is definitely worth a visit, be it for brunch, evening hang out or a night-out. The food is delectable; the Chocolate milkshake topped with chocoflakes (I can't recall its name on the  menu) being my fave, I always order one at least. 

The interiors is unique, in keeping with the nomenclature, and the visual display is quite impressive. Also, the ambience is great, turning more lively by the hour. You're sure to have a fabulous time.

Had been hearing loads about this place. So got a chance to visit this place. Once you enter the place, you'll truly be bowled over by the decor. There was live screening of the match going on. Behind one can see the brewery pots. Lighting was truly impeccable. Opted for the smoking zone. Managed to get a table pretty soon. Guess Lady Luck was in our favor. But had no clue would be in for such a big disappointment when we called the server to place our order. So I'm unable to eat anything spicy so asked the server that if there's anything suitable on the menu for me. The instant reply was a big and blunt NO!!! Finally settled for a Chicken Salad with Pineapple (don't remember the name as printed on the menu) and French Fries. The food was decent. Tried the beer samples which were good. But we finally settled for a whiskey and a shooter.

Overall, nice place. Would definitely like to visit again, ONLY IF THE SERVERS DON'T COME ACROSS AS RUDE AND BLUNT.

We all have heard about The Grid but many of you are a bit confused about it's exact location. Also,  since the menu card is not made public, people often hesitate to try out this place as they are quite skeptical about the kind of food and drinks this place serves.
It is situated behind the Mahindra Showroom in Topsia.

We ordered a bbq chicken pizza and a chicken wings. The food quality is extremely good and the food presentation is really impressive. 

Well you guys must know that The Grid has a specific food time slot. We went there around 3 and they only had drinks and nibbles available at that time. Then on special request Grid got us our bbq chicken pizza fresh out of the oven and we were blown away it. Along with that we ordered Sangrias and Manhattan. The vermouth used in the Manhattan was a standout.

The place didn't have a large selection of beer , which was disheartening. The prices of alcohol are pretty inconsistent . Also, some areas may make you feel detached from the rest of the place . You literally feel ' Off the grid 

Complaining about taxes has never been productive, so all I can say that it was worth it and was ideal for a very special day .

Sunday meals should always be special right? With family, friends, laughter, good food and happiness?¬†That is what¬†Gaurav Karnani, director of The Grid thinks as well and that is the reason why he came up with the concept of¬†the¬†Sunday Brunch. The idea is to engage families and provide them with a¬†place where they can have fun.

1st time i entered this place.. I was like WOW! What a good job on interiors! The thematic concept of grids executed so well! I specially love the lego bar table, the screen on the brewery facade. 
Fantastic music n buzzing crowd sets the ambience just right... Drinks n cocktails are nice n reasonabaly priced anh the service is good. 
A special cheer goes to the chef for creating such innovative n delicious fusion food!.. The green corriander noodles, cheese n corn kebabs, spicy nachos  with the dips are super! 
The only thing not nice was the freshly brewd beers.. Could have done better, otherwise this place is a 5/5!

Unorthodox and funky decor with good music and nice seating.
IMO they have the best microbrewary in town.
You dont have to ask for testers it will come to ur table.
Caldra german brew is the best with a light fruity flavor and golfen hue.belgian de garde is a bit hvy and bitter but leaves a nice after taste.

On the food side we had barishwala fish fry which was good and bhetki , our nxt item was pork sausage
The sausage was mind blwoing with a wood grilled flavor but the dish was too hot for my taste
Carbon nachos should be ordered only if u r a grp of 4-6 ppl 
The portion sizes are good.
Guptajis toast on dessert is overared.
Overall food is okayish but the beer is superb.
Service is nice
Management pls take note on the food front and you have a winner!

The newest and hottest brewery in town is The Grid. The place is bustling with fantastic DJing, beautiful crowd and of course their best stocked Lego bar and the huge brewery. The brewery is not only extremely particular how they are producing their beers but even how they are serving and maintaining correct serving temperature. Each beer has also option of particular glass in which they serve. Notable thing is like few other brewery in town their fresh brew doesn't run out of stock even during peak hours.

Estuary Berry Witbier has colour of pale pinkish to red. This Belgian beer is fruity in taste, refreshing and mild and very popular among ladies.Caldera Hefeweizen is a German beer with pale golden straw colour. This spicy yet fruity with light finish.Osborn Indian Pale Ale is strongest beer among the lot but smooth enough. Another with origination from UK, this brown colour drink is intensely aromatic and crisp. Will have a feel of bitterness too. Tombolo Stout is a dark beer tastes like creamy smooth coffee finish. Originated at UK, it has an interesting taste but it‚Äôs neither bitter nor strong. It‚Äôs my all time favorite.

Now, one must not think that the management focuses only on drinks buy not on food. The menu is extensive and whatever item we picked tasted amazing and stands out from the crowd.We had Bhatia‚Äôs Punjabi Style Chili Chicken, this is not just another chili chicken dish we can have in Chinatown but this is zingy and perfectly combos with hard liquor or beer.¬†
Also opted for The Grid Box non-veg platter which had Prawn Chips along with Drums of Hell, Barishwala Fish Fry and Bhindibazar Chicken Tikka. Drums of Hell is so crispy and meaty with spicy chili sauce goes so well with chilled beer. Bhindibazar Chicken Tikka has the flavor of India but with creamy finish. Barishwala Fish Fry was excellent too with spicy mustard sauce.

The last surprise of the day was Guptaji‚Äôs Toast. Don‚Äôt go by the name but this sinful desert with bread slices drenched in chocolate syrup, stuffed with gems and shaving of white chocolate as topping.

With so many pubs cropping out from everywhere very less proportion is actually something to talk about. The Grid is a must visit for all party animals out here but don‚Äôt think about the cost. Quality comes with a price. Service is immaculate with prompt valet service.

Saturday nights are Satur-YAY at this place.
I would suggest to try the Blue Lagoon hookah (very smokey & very light)¬†
Mocktail- Pomegranate Ice Tea
Veg Dish- Lasagne
Non-Veg- The Grid box is crazy

The DJ is simply superb and gets the mood going, exactly knows how to pull the crowd from the tables to the floor. Love this place P.S- This place deserves a special mention of allowing entry even when its full. They do not kill the party mood of the peeps. Much love to you'll

And, recently last week, I discovered The Grid to be one of the fun places and thus added it up to my weekend go-to list.

I am back after a really long time. This time it was my and my friend's joint treat. 
Food- In the starters we had Barishwala Fish Fry , Kairi Paneer Skew and Tandoori aloo. ( Name of the dish was bit different). Fish fry was very filling and crispy .  Tandoori aloo was tasty , specially the filling. Paneer Skew was soft and  nicely flavoured.
In the main course, we had Veg steak (for our vegetarian friend) , Grilled Chicken with heart attack sauce and Fish batter fry in Tartar sauce with chips. Veg steak was nice as the Paneer-cheese combo was surprisingly wonderful. But my favourite was the Grilled chicken , the sauce was sweetish source itu tinge of chilli and the chicken pieces were soft , fresh and succulent. The fish and chips were also nice. 
Desserts- We ordered the famous Guptaji's toast which was AWESOME . It is basically baked bread toast filled with gems, nutella and banana topped with nuts . It is one of the very few desserts that I found both innovative and delicious at the same time. They also gave us  complimentary dessert , the choco mud pie with vanilla ice cream as they accidentally spilled drinks on one of my friend. The mud pie was oozing hot liquid chocolate which perfectly matched with the creamy, cold vanilla ice cream.
Ambience - The decor was very nice and innovative. There are various sitting arrangements along in different sections.
Service- The service was bit clumsy. They were repeatedly serving wrong dishes and they were too much time. But they atleast apologized. 
So overall the experience was nice.

Five of us dined there last night. Firstly - superbly conceptualised Lounge-Bar with a resident Deejay, well done up place and very classy. Better to call ahead and book a table and be there on time. The Micro-Brewery churns out Beers unlike anything you get in bottles. They have a large variety of snacks - Some lovely ones in Pork and more or less a huge variety. We had a Bhatia Chilli Chicken and a Japanese style chiili pork for starters. Main course was a Pakistani Kabab platter and an Alsacian Pizza. Fantastic service, wonderful ambience - we recommend it as a must visit destination. Total Pocket Pinch Rs 4300 with liquor - but then we did not eat much.

Even though me and my friends love this place and the beer from what I hear is fantastic, I am compelled to rate this place poorly purely based on how bad their service is. After being denied the menu, the waiter refused to take an order because he simply assumed that we didn't have a table. I understand crowded places and the pressure that the servers are under on a Saturday night but 45 mins just to get a menu and to get someone to take the order is ridiculous.

This place is one of the best bars in the city and easily the best brewery. They have a full bar and an extensive food menu, though I know nothing of either. I am there for the beer.¬†

As of now they have four beers on tap, a wheat, a Belgian ale, an IPA and an oatmeal stout on nitro. They also had a porter the other day, but that kicked with my pour. Lucky me! The beers are pretty good, and I liked the stout the most. Koushika, the brew master, is very knowledgeable and passionate. It is heartening to see him strive to make good beer despite the ridiculous logistical issues he has to deal with. He has ambitious plans for this place and I wish him all the best in his endeavors.

The music is progressive and gets louder as people get drunk. The service is excellent and Prakash the bartender is very efficient and attentive. I not only recommend but also encourage people to visit this place and help develop craft brewing in Kolkata.

PS: In addition to being a brewery it‚Äôs also somewhat of a fine dining venue. Dress appropriately!!

Yesterday i landed in a hooka bar , GRID , jam packed at 8 pm on Monday . Calcuttans sure have evolved . A city which used to sleep at ten pm is jiving and drinking, and smoking hooka .Both genders equally enjoying the fun. The music was a bit too loud for me otherwise it was good ambience . Now no one can call Calcutta boring .It has its only brewery attracting the young and old alike .I normally donot have beer but loved the mild beer with a fruity smoky flavor .. I was pleasantly suprised by the floor manager who offered me help to climb stairs as the seating below was full . She then visited our table often to ensure we were not in any discomfort as it was a smoking zone and the smell was quite over powering .A very good PR person .

The portions of starter was good for three .¬†

I am writing this post after multiple visits to The Grid and its fast become a favorite place to hang out not just because of the ambiance and vibe but the delicious food served up by Chef Chiranjib Chatterjee and his Team. The brainchild of Gourav and Ritika Karnani spread across 10,000 square feet and designed by Ayaz Basrai it has an eclectic vibe that I really enjoy. The Lego freak in me loves the Lego Bar and with the Brewery ready to serve its Beer from 25th February onwards I suggest you drop by sooner rather than later and experience the fun yourself.

In the awe for becoming a happening place in Kolkata, few entrepreneurs have started to walk an extra mile which finally yielded in coming out with some innovations. 
"Microbrewry" - this is no more an hoask to party people these days. Country Roads, if I am not mistaken was the first one in the city to bring this brewing beer and they were followed by the other places. The Grid is located just opposite to the "Porsche" showroom while you are travelling from science city towards park circus. They have got vallet parking and thus u get the feel that u are about to enter a pub of premium clas. Excellent interior with cascaded 1st floor. The ground floor is for non smokers, and in the 1st floor you can have your beer with smoke. Price is a bit on higher side but once in a while easily affordable. Nice music with Led screens and music on demand. Very nice crowd specially on weekends.

A sudden plan on a lazy Sunday evening and we found ourselves 'joining' The Grid. First and foremost the decor really struck me as uber cool and funky. The beer vats in the background and the construction site theme really made a positive impression. And the legos brought back many memories.
It was early evening so finding seats didn't turn out to be much of a challenge. We were offered the sampler. After sipping the samplers, I decided to start with the Piedmont (the American style blonde). The fruity citrus-y aroma really welcome your taste buds and its easy to keep sipping. Next up I ordered a glass of the Caldera (the German style cloudy wheat beer). This one was really nice and fragrant and had multiple notes hitting the olfactory nerves. Again easy to keep sipping owing to its light and refreshing body. I enjoyed this more than the Piedmont. Next I ordered a glass of the British style porter (can't recall the name Grid calls it by). This one as expected had a heavier body, perhaps the heaviest of them all. This one was my personal favourite. I really enjoyed the slightly sweet chocolate-y and caramel-y mouthfeel ending with Christmas dried fruits. The mistake I made was that I ordered the porter before the India Pale Ale. I felt the porter would have been ideal to end the evening with but I wanted to try the IPA too. The IPA had a light body compared to the porter and I found it again a bit fruity and slightly bitter. As I mentioned, my personal favourite was the porter.
The nacho crisps were not bad but the spicy pork sausages too be honest weren't that great. But then again this place for me is about the beers and not the food. The service was okay and it wasn't that expensive. Towards the later part of the evening it got too loud to talk but the music was good so not much to complain about. Unlike Beer Republic they don't charge an entry fee and their ambiance, atmosphere and the BEERS are much better. Definitely recommended.

p.s.- the photographs didn't come out very well due to the low lighting.

We, the fully functioning, working adults of the world, are so caught up in the world of duties and responsibilities that we have no time. Forget about¬†standing and staring, we don‚Äôt have a moment to spare even for ourselves; I speak from experience. Every once in a while, perhaps while stuck in the traffic, or when the known face of a long-lost friend appears in my Facebook feed, I think of the missed trip, or the cancelled dinner plan with them. Meanwhile, they miss me, too, and feel guilty, too. Sundays are all I have, but the truth is, we all feel too tired or lazy to devote an entire Sunday to others, selfish as it might sound. So, why not a brunch with friends? The GRID Sunday Brunch is a great way to start your Sunday ‚Äì by catching up with friends, without a worry in the world!

Best place to sit and drink in kolkata.
Music : Awesome
Ambience : Awesome
Drinks : Awesome

Bonus point : the best smoking room in the city.
I should better describe it as a smoking floor rather than a room.

This is easily the best bar in Kolkata. Although it's a little less known to people, the service provided is in no way to be undermined. 

Full points on the ambience. Just the right amount of lights. The Grid boxes all around really theme the place up well.
They serve 4 brewed beers, namely, Caldera,Osborn, Estuary and Hogback. You are allowed to have free samples of these. My choice? Hogback was the best of the lot. 

I also tried their Old-fashioned which was a little strong for my taste and needed a little syrup. 

Now coming to the USP of this place: The service. No matter how top notch a bar is, how much revenue it earns, customer satisfaction is strongly dependent on the service provided. They provide the best. Very very courteous and helpful. Bappa, the gentleman serving me and my friends, was very helpful in suggesting what was good in the menu. We were also allowed very courteously to switch from a standing table to a proper table when it was vacated. Full marks, really.

The only downside to this place is the quantity of food they serve. We had ordered the Non veg Grid Box which costs Rs. 600(taxes exclusive) . It was not sufficient for a platter. So, a recommendation here would be to suggest how many people a dish can  serve in the menu.

Other than that, do try and join The Grid.

Heard a lot about this place and now in total love with this place..Everything and anything about the place is just perfect..You can't find any flaws..be it location, ambience,service, food, music etc etc..Coriander Chow  is their signature dish which also delivers according to the reputation. Naan rolls also make your taste buds go weak. asking for more..Overall a must visit and undoubtedly one of the finest ones in the city

Absolutely amazing place to dine in. Fell in love just when I entered the dimly lit Cafe brewery Kitchen located in Topsia. Was there on a friend's treat so can't enlighten how it feels on pocket but the food is so tasty!
Be it noodles, pasta or babycorn each one of the dish it offers leaves you mesmerized with its taste. 
A must go place. One of the places I would love to Visit again and again.

I had the best pub experience of my 4 year Kolkata stay here. This place is goals.

Located on the main road, it is very convenient to find. The interiors are amazing, with Lego pieces, indoor tree decorations and a see through brewing station. There are several levels, for smoking, non smoking areas and the seating areas are very elegantly designed.

We had ordered abut 5 cocktails, Cosmopolitan, Sex on the beach, LIIT, Vodkatini and a Screw Driver. Everything was good and with reasonable quantity. We also had a small BP but it tasted not-so-special compared to the cocktails. For food we had ordered platter, Barish ka khaana and fish fingers. IT ALL TASTED SO GOOD :')

We had to shift our seats to order the hookah, but it was not a big problem. The hookah wasn't very strong,  it could have been a bit cooler too. The staff was very friendly and overall t was pretty good experience for 3200 bucks :D

Went to grid on 14th Feb.
Well ambiance and food was up to the mark.
We ordered Bombay chicken wings with blue cheese,mithibai college sandwich , van wale chowmin.
In drinks we ordered sangria and club poison.
Both drinks and food was good .
Quantity of food is also standard.
They take cover charges of 1000 rupees per head.
You have to redeem this amount same day.
As it was valentines day, they said it was full booked.However they managed to get us two seats.
In case of seating arrangement ,they have many sections.We got a table for two near the bar.
It was little congested as other customer and waiters were running all around us.
Though the taste of food and drink managed to distract us from overloading crowd.
Lastly music was also very apt .
Though i would like to mention three points to the authorities.
1.Please upload the menu in zomato.
2.Its mentioned that booking is not allowed.But we got to know that entire restaurants was booked.
3.If there is buffet available , please let us know the price and menu.¬†
At that time you guys said table booking is not allowed for weekend.Please clarify if we can book in weekdays.

Also cover charges are a reason i have to think of a big party there.

Great place to hang out with friends or go for a drink or two.
The decor is like sections in form of square grids and all the seating different .

The music on saturday is great .

The food is good and the place does not take reservation so be there a little early ,  if you want a table or wait at the bar.

We ordered the veg grid box which was good for munchies to go with the drinks, try the chicken chilly was good and the pizza are also good.

Go for the cocktails , friends tried the whisky sour is very good .

Tried the in house craft beer , it was good for kolkata standards but compared to other craft beer places its nothing special .

Avoid going on a saturday , its packed and getting a table is a tough job.

The Valentine's Day dinner date was made even better by Grid, the coolest new place in town and it's food, drinks, service and ambiance was topped only by the company.¬†
¬†
Must try dishes include the feta cheese and watermelon salad ( a colorful, playful dish that makes a combo as weird as watermelon and feta cheese work to perfection) , the stir fried mushroom in white wine ( my personal favorite dish of the night and probably one of the best mushroom preparations I've had), the chicken wings (with fries, veggies and a stinky blue cheese dip). The usual brownie and ice cream dessert too was plated uniquely in a skillet and the molten marshmallows added a new texture to the usual.¬†

¬†Make no mistakes, I am coming back soon..!

I visited this place yesterday on Valentine's day as I was looking for something different than the normal dine in restaurants. I was really impressed with the dec√≤r and ambience. More over the food was just as good as it could have been. The bengali style fried prawns in the Grid box were awesome. But wat I liked best was Warm Chocolate Mud Pie (dont remember the exact name). The presentation of the desert was cool but the taste was just superb. One of the best deserts I have had in recent past. Would love to visit this place again.

The GRID - finally got to go to this place which is located in Topsia in the same complex as Ojas banquet. Went there on a Saturday night and the place was buzzing with people. This place has a fantastic ambience and superb music. We ordered some cocktails along with feta crumbled marinated water melons, killer corn patties with cream cheese. The water melon with the feta cheese was so fresh and juicy that is just melted in our mouth. For main course we ordered crispy potato Rosti and quesadillas. Rosti was again one of the best we had in town. Quesadillas were good too. For dessert we had ordered chocolate mud pie. DJ was awesome and they play really good numbers. Main highlights are lighting service, courteous attendants and stimulating ambience. Little overpriced but worth it.

Sunday Buffet Launch at a Global Eatery @ Grid ‚Äì Cafe Brewery Kitchen..!

Do you often find yourself cribbing about Kolkata being a dead city vis-a-vis other metros? Are you tired of hearing your friends boasting about their food trails abroad? Now proudly boast about Kolkata‚Äôs cafe brewery kitchen all concocted together as GRID.¬† It preaches neo gastronomy, mixology and parties know a new location.
            

The Grid has been a very important addition in the foodmap of Kolkata for two basic reasons- the location and the scale. Topsia has only acted as a perimeter for China Town when it has been food around Topsia and the 10000 sq feet area is one of its kind in Kolkata. Enter The Grid which promises to combine the swag of a brewery, the luxury of fine dining and the liveliness of a caf√©.
                                                                ...

I don't know what was it that night -  the place or the company,  but it made it all a night to remember Of fun,  good music,  good food and great service. 
Suggested by a few friends in Kolkata,  we went here on a Saturday and truth be told I myself would recommend this place amongst others for a night of fun. 
The drinks are amazing, the bartenders quick even though the place is jam packed. 
You need to navigate yourself around to find a place to seat. But that's OK becausethe staff will still find u and serve u without any bill hassle. 
Loved the food and music. All praises.

Have been to the place on my last visit to Kolkata . It was nice to see how the place has been done up. While I have seen similar places in Mumbai, this is not steep and probably one of cooler bars in the city. Food was good and they also serve Sheesha. ¬†If you are in Kolkata and want to chill with friends on a Friday or Saturday night...this could be the place!

It's my second time to "The Grid" on Saturday Jan 29, 2017. First and foremost, I found it deceiving since it describes itself as an "inhouse brewery" but doesn't serve any; further the choice of beer was very limited and even the stock. We had 5 Bira whites and thereafter, they had none. Further, the beer pricing was high - Bira White - Rs500/pint & Bira Blonde - Rs.400/pint

However, the food was Ok, cocktails were good. The staffs were extremely cordial. One of the deserts we ordered turned out to be "not fresh" and therefore, the server got us a different dessert on the house (chocolate fondue) and it was really awesome.

Overall a decent experience but could have been much better

To sum it up, when you are all praises about a place, the review in itself becomes short, crisp and self explanatory!

P.S. - they could probably go a little bit easier on the prices. However, having said so, every penny would be worth spending in this place.

I did my booking for 8 people through Zomato which is an excellent feature. Service was great. Food was even better. Ambience was very different but in a nice kind of way. We only had vegetarian dishes. The Killer Corn Kebab, cheesy garlic bread are the top 2 dishes I would recommend. But then again, try everything. All the dishes were yummy.

The GREED!

This place has its own statistics of success - the x and y axis synchronize harmoniously - the x being hunger and the y being the food!
The decor is metallic & punk.
The service is good, beginning with a warm welcome, and attention all through. They complimented not only with chips and lollipops for my daughter but also provided a whole glass of juice for her. Mini was simply spellbound and impressed.
Coming to food - the three main courses ordered for had distinct flavours and different taste and in penty proportions - the chicken sprinkled spaghetti for my daughter, grilled chicken for myself and Irany Pulav fir my rice craving hubby.

Finally off the checklist. The first thing that comes to mind when you enter this glamorous pub is the way they have planned their entire setup. So well distributed and segmented.Next come the interiors.One of its kind and well executed. Thank you Bunny for being such a great guide. The place has its own brewery with around 12 home-made beers, of which 4 are being served now. We tried Tombola, which is worth a year long subscription!!! Food and drinks are perfect taste,quality,quantity and price wise. Definitely deserves multiple visits. Thank You Bunny once again. Cheers.

I chose a very busy evening to drop in at THE GRID. It was Christmas eve and the crowd was on its peak. Inspite of having several reasons to disappoint, THE GRID did not. The service was on point and we could not complain. Apart from an array of drinks, we tried the GRID box which is great as a sharing platter with some bold favours and variety, mutton PIZZA which was okay but certainly not the best, arrabbiata penne pasta was really good. Overall, this place has really good service and a very modern interior. I would definitely visit this place again.

A weekend date night but started with a big diss appointment - hookah was not served! But it was not the fault of the restaurant but a ban across the city. A bit dejected, we ordered a mithibai college sandwich and a fish muniar. Must say that both the dishes were extremely good. We were unable to finish both the dishes and had to get them packed. A special mention about the decor. The place is extremely well done in terms of the seating, the lights and even the tiny things like the cutlery, tissues, glasses and the like. The bar has been decorated with lego pieces which looked wonderful! The staff were extremely prompt and served with a smile! Will definitions back again and will hopefully get hookah served.

Great ambience with attractive seating zones. Do explore the whole place first before choosing your table as you might miss the best seating area. ¬†For a Teetotaler, Lychee Gulkand Mojito is suggested in mocktails. The food is delicious and will definitely satisfy your taste buds. Suggested chicken dishes: Chili Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Grilled Chicken for chicken lovers.¬†

However, the only downside is the limited choice on the menu.

We were there at the afternoon of 25th December 2016. Unlike any other place this was very spacious and ambiance was superb.

There was only buffet available on that day so we opted for Unlimited mocktails with non veg items.

Mango chilli mocktails and Watermelon mojito was very good. The chilli mango mocktail was served on a marble jar type glass. Which I liked a lot.

From the starters I liked the Fried Fish and Bombay reshmi kebab of chicken.. 
Chicken pizza was lame.

There was plenty of Main courses there... All was good. Loved the Chicken in mushroom sauce from the menu.

Writing this review to appreciate the excellent service by our server Mr. Bunny last night. He served each of us beers at three different temperatures - extremely chilled, cold and mildly cold.  

He was very attentive and cleared the table when it was getting crowded. And getting the right condiments with each dish. 

The food was served in good portion sizes and each dish was served hot. The restaurant had good music and had a great fun vibe. They even served a complimentary dessert for the birthday! 

Had a great time. Looking forward to the next trip and will then also upload a detailed review on the food and drinks. üòä

I happened to walk into this place pretty much by chance, when I was around Science City, looking for a new place to eat. This is more of a party and shisha place, with a totally breathtaking interior and a very limited food menu. 

The ambiance is too good to be described in words. The projection play at the bar counter, and dim yellow lights with an amazing decor, segregated into various sections and varying between the two floors are the highlights of this place. 

Since am neither an alcoholic nor a sheesha person, I do not know if it's justified for me to write a review for the place. I had ordered a mocktail (uploading the menu here could have helped me write the name) and Lasagne. While the mocktail was pretty refreshing, the Lasagne was quite mediocre. The thing that irritated me quite a bit was the staffs almost constantly looking at us, which is pretty impolite. Other than that, this place totally qualifies as a happening pub.

Gone are the days of naming restaurants according to the cuisine they serve. Funky names are definitely in and I had no idea what to expect of The Grid. It was an enjoyable experience, with a couple of obvious areas of improvement. 

Large, aesthetically done and not terribly heavy on the pocket, this brewpub is a good place to spend a relaxed few hours. The service is very courteous, which adds immense value. 

We ordered: 

Beverages: The selection of international beer was  limited. The Heineken was great but what I wanted and didn't get was Tuborg. 

The Grid Box: Assorted starters including Fish fingers, Chicken tikka, Sweet chilly prawn - great stuff. The mustard sauce accompanying the fish fingers was superlative! 

BBQ chicken pizza - Outstanding enough for us to order a second round üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

Chicken wings: Good 

Keema Pao: I found the keema a bit too smooth. The almost p√¢t√© like consistency didn't quite work for me and taste was average for someone who comes from the land of keema pav.

Desserts: Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate is clearly a great idea for a large percentage of the human population but I don't like chocolate! The only other option was something with paan ice-cream which was not desirable. They did not have any other ice cream, not even the standard vanilla. The kids enjoyed the chocolate desserts and I felt very deprived, unable to satiate my sweet tooth üòìüòìüòìüòì

Kolkata in the year 2016 was in a transition phase from people dancing in the clubs slowly it was changing into people chilling at pubs.

The Grid is a gift to kolkata's pubbing scene. Located in the same building as ojas banquets makes it very easy for people to locate it. This place is special in every possible way right from the moment you reach you have a valet who parks your car. A very hospitable hosstess who looks after the PR also greets you and guides you to your table.
A very well done interiors with spaced out covers is a big tick in the box.

Service personnel are knowledgeable and will give you the right insights about any food/beverage.
Coming to the food we ordered-
1) The grid nonveg platter
2)grilled chicken
3)Fish meuniere
4)Guptaji toast

We ordered for a sheesha (vanilla rasna combo) it was just fantabulous. My friend wanted to try their freshly made beer but the brewery was not operational. That is the only thing which takes 0.5 points away.

The platter had fish ,chicken and prawn and is very filling. The grilled chicken had a wonderful sauce all over it making it taste awesome. Fish muniere was equally good. What stole the show was the GUPTAJI TOAST. If i have to term it in one word how i felt "ORGASMIC". It is a must try here.

The owners have made their own enclosure also which looks rugged and amazing "THE CAGE". Another classic addition to this place is the ASYLUM which is literally hidden from the eyes of people yet exists right there in the upper deck. This room is all white in nature padded with white high quality rexin/leather in the walls. Old school chairs makes it look killer. More of a sit down option which caters to 12 pax. I was lucky to have got a sneak peek of it.

Lipsmaking food , lovely ambience and brisk service with being reasonably priced are the highlights of this place. This is a place i would love to go back always!!kuddos team THE GRID!

Excellent decor & ambience. The interiors are very well thought out. 

Both Chili paneer & Stuffed potato starters were top notch. Great shisha but pretty average drinks. Service had a slow start but got better with the evening.

Overall, quite a pleasant surprise.

I had visited the place with my sister and my friends and only one word can describe this place , ie; amazing 
The food is outstanding as well as the drinks and hookah. It's main attraction is it's warehouse concept interior. Amazing hospitality of the staffs. Amazing greeting from the lady at the gate , Sneha Mitra. 
Our server was Abhijit. This guy has a lot of knowledge regarding the food they are serving.
A bit costly but a must visit.

Located near vishkarma building in Topsia Crossing.
Firstly the ambience was overwhelming as soon as i entered this place, secondly the staffs were courteous enough to help us out with the orders and special dishes of this place. 
Coming to my favourite, the hookah was not at all good inspite of the fact that the staff changed it 4 times but still the hookah was set wrong.
Food was okay but must say that less in quantity as compared to price.
Price is a very high so was not expecting this from a newly opened cafe.

Can surely improve if they work on some grey areas.

Thank You

Now coming to food pizza was a good thin crust pizza and hakka chowmin was good. Their nachos were average and tandoori aloo was really sweet.

Well this is the first time I'm writing a review on Zomato...So here it goes..
Pro's
1. Pretty big place-The biggest pub in town
2. Great space management-well thought sitting arrangement 
3. Staff has a cool uniform-unlike the conventional, boring shirt-pant look
3. Amazing interiors-You would fall in love with it at first look
4. Music- DJ is great. Music is awesome and those loud and groovy music would set the mood.
5. V.Imp-Food is fresh, hot.
7. Sanitation- Toilets are clean and big.¬† The concept is amazing and unique which I've not seen anywhere till now.
8. Valley Parking Service available
9. Location- on this main road in Topsia.
¬†
Now...Unfortunately coming to the areas which need work (humnnn)

Cons:
1. Staff- Staff is humble, however, are irresponsible and do not have a clue about the food or how to guide customer in an around the place-Don't serve water, or change plates (Common serving etiquettes). You have to ask them repeatedly to get this done. 
2. Price-Very Expensive. So, if they cannot reduce the price, then they should work on the quantity.
3. Hookah Stations: We wanted to have hookah. Unfortunately there is not sufficient sitting arrangement made for this, there were however, tables where you can stand and have it but, I do not think this would help much. 

Overall, the experience was Decent.

This is right next to my house and has become my most favourite! I mean I don't really like revisiting places too often unless they are terrific... but this has got it all. The food is awesome! I've tried their naan roll, chicken burger, chicken sandwich, pasta, noodles sangria and martini  The staff is nice. . Ambience is killer... THEY DON'T CHARGE SERVICE FEE! Isn't that great? And, mind you, there's China town next to my house and that's a lot of good Chinese and thai food. ..but I'd choose this over that anyday!

The Grid is a perfect place where u can get d taste of a modern day pub n cafe in kolkata. The ambience n decor is awesome . As soon as you enter u'll be asked if u r planning to have a hookah , then u will be seated upstairs from where you can get a helicopter view of the whole place below. I personally felt the hookah is a bit light here. Coming to food we ordered Bombay chicken wings (which was so so. Was not much special in taste but well furnished it was) and Irany berry chicken palav (which was somewhat like biriyani with some added taste n flavour which made it taste awesome. Try this its really gonna tickle ur taste buds!! ) Now cocktails. This place pioneers in cocktails in d city and they taste soo well !! We took Sex on the beach (which was vodka+ canberry + bla bla dont remember) and Honey apple singh which was heavenly refreshing!! Its their signature cocktail and was suggested by the waiter. Oh yes! The staffs here are so much helpful n courteous! They help u choose ur menu , serve it and later comes to ask if it tastes good. Well dats all. Now comes the bill. DO NOT even think that u will have the bill nethng around the approximate amount listed here in zomato. Its actually Rs2000 approximately for two. For us it was Rs 2498. 
P.S. I forgot to click the honey apple singh while I was lost in it :P

I must say, it will give 5 star nightclubs a run for their money. Location is the key. Interiors reflect on two things - taste and money spent. Intelligent space management. Food is extremely well presented and fresh in texture and taste. Drinks menu is elaborate. Valet parking available. Music is good. Overall , two years of packed crowd i foresee.

A very good looking place with great drinks. I had a kairi flavored mojito as well as a virgin pina colada-like mocktail. Both were knock-your-socks-off good. The food didn't keep up with that great start unfortunately. Cheese jalapeno poppers, a chana chaat platter, topped nachos, barbecue wings, we ordered plenty of starters (a menu uploaded here would refresh my memory). But everything was just about average. The service was also quite trying. This is however, still a great looking place for a fancy night out.

Be it the home cooked food or experience of having food somewhere outside, food is something I love to discuss, I love to write about and naturally I cherish the food adda. This post of mine is about a blogger‚Äôs meet followed by family dine out at the Grid. Now there are certain perks for being a food blogger.¬†We often get invitations to sample food in different joints and naturally have the first-hand idea to choose a food joint for the further visit. ¬†Sometimes people ask me to refer food joints and I try to guide them based on my preferences, my experience at any particular joint. However, One more thing I am often being asked, how to be a review blogger and how to get free food! Well, the coin has another side you see! Now that is what I found difficult as I have a set budget each month that I spent for dine out to spend quality time with the family and friends and I don‚Äôt consider myself as a review blogger but what I write is solely about my experience of the having the F&B at any particular joint. I got an invitation to sample food at the Grid ¬†where I was invited to sample food along with the fellow bloggers and upon satisfied with the entire experience I have decided to revisit the place with a personal group! I, though, was a bit skeptical while going there with the family (& friends) as I already had experience of having average food upon going to a food joint as a normal habitu√© after a blogger‚Äôs meet. Fortunately, The Grid had not at all turned me down. I got the same taste, same quality, same portion size and same service while visiting the place next time. That probably is the sign of a good and stable F&B place who are maintaining their services.

Went to this much hyped place for the second time and couldn't resist writing the review this time.  Good things first - baked fish in lemon sauce is brilliant so is their chocolate Bailey dessert. Average - sangria. Terrible - worst LIIT ever. Service is a complete let down. Empty tables and front desk says waiting for an hour. Everything takes 30 mins. And water was almost not served till billing. Extremely loud music. So if you have conversation in mind this place should be avoided. Overall not going there again

Went to this place on last weekend... it's another cool place in Kolkata to hang out. Ambiance was good. Interior design was quite Innovative, it looks like some factory and all waiters were also wearing that type of cloth. Food was tasty but quantity was a bout less. Booze was as usual classic cocktails and normal regular white or red wine. I liked it and would like to suggest everyone to visit.

regarding service - bit slow but somehow managable.

No wonder this place enjoys such high ratings on  Zomato. Excellent ambience and great food. Amazing cocktails as well.

The prices may seem high but for the kind of food and drinks üçπ served its at par.

The Creamy Veg is a dish which should be on a must try list.

The only thing which they need to improve on is service. Sometimes it gets difficult to catch the attention of the waiters.

It‚Äôs now an established fact that we, Kolkattans love to eat or rather live to eat and these restauranteurs know it very well. Probably, that‚Äôs the reason, nowadays, we see a good number of restaurants, some pretty posh, opening up. But, among all the glitz and glamour, many forget the basic of the food business as to what really really establishes a restaurant. If we take the classic cases, which is even valid today, it‚Äôs solely the food and good portion size- secondly the service. And if these factors are taken into consideration, rest hardly matters. So, when we were invited to sample the menu in The Grid, we were slightly skeptic about the offering. Though we‚Äôve heard good about the joint, but still deception is the keyword these days.

The address is in Topsia area, beside the Skoda showroom. Now, surprisingly, this shad looking building is slowly turning into the hub for some of the city‚Äôs finest food joints and banquets. Parking space was aplenty and valet parking was available, so no problem.

¬†
I reached a little late and as usual, my good friends there have started. Now, in any new place, I always ask for server‚Äôs advice and this was no exception. For cocktail, I was asked for my choice of spirit and accordingly was served The Jamaican Skull (a rum and Bailey‚Äôs Irish Cream based cocktail)- the presentation was mind blowing. The glass was brilliant and the accompaniment was a nolen gurer sondesh (yes, I‚Äôm not joking).

As the side dish, we were served the Bombay Gymkhana Noodles (strong coriander flavored and my favorite and the watermelon salad). Frankly, the salad was overpowered by the noodles (or was it my not-so-strong-affection for fruits) but both were pretty good.

Another beer based cocktail followed with their house-special fiery Dry Chilly chicken (I was heavily recommended for this) and spicy chicken wings. The chilly chicken was damn good and so was the wings. But, the next item took us for a surprise and it was Pork Samosa. Small Samosas fulled with dry pork lean meat and trust me, this dish is to die for- definitely recommended.

For the main course, we were served the mildly spiced (thankfully) Baked Kolkata Bekti (one of the showstoppers of the day) and the Keema Scotch Egg. Both were lightly spiced and soothed our palate- much needed.

We were full, but Supreeta insisted us for their specialty dessert ‚ÄúGuptaji Ka Toast‚Äù, which we found out is the cousin of Shahi Tukra who fall in love with chocolate and seriously. It was super heavy and one portion can easily, like easily be shared among 3 persons. The dessert which followed (Sadly, I forgot the name) was two types of choocolate and oreo, and frankly, I can;t describe it, but it was good. For reference, you can show this pic to the server or Chef Chiranjib and he‚Äôll be glad to help you, I can promise.

And frankly a meal like this, can‚Äôt go wrong with good friends, so overall it was a nice evening. But, word of caution, here, the portion sizes are pretty heavy and mostly all the dishes are, thankfully, value for money. So, the place is definitely recommended for your weekend. A prior reservation is definitely recommended.

First thing first , i really don't have a clue why the management of The Grid has not yet uploaded their menu here in zomato. There is no harm doing it , infact it will really be helpful to many who are calculative in spending or treating , i guess mostly we all are. So i would put a humble request to you to stop showing your reluctance towards this matter and like other popular pubs and fine dine places , do upload your menu with prices in the designated section of zomato ( as it is not a stock exchange bar where prices fluctuate) and allow guests from a wider range of economic background to visit your joint including those who sets a budget before spending ; as the cost for two mentioned here is no where close to a standard meal.

And since its not yet done , in this review i will firstly discuss the pricing as far as i remember. The cocktails starts from Rs 300 to 350 , 450 and up. Domestic drinks like bacardi white rum , Smirnoff vodka are priced from Rs 200 for small pegs. Coming to food non veg starters are priced around Rs 290 and pizzas pastas and non veg maincourses mostly above Rs 500. Taxation is shown in the bill attached.

The decor is wonderfully done in grid or matrix concept , music system and sectioned seating arrangements all make the place very lively and enjoyable. The high stool tables on the ground floor was all occupied on a weekday evening , so we took a normal table for four upstairs which allows smoking as well. A big plus!
Coming to the food , what ever we had was excellent in terms of quality and taste. Portions were okay.

JUHU GYMKHANA CORIANDER NOODLES : stir fried spicy noodles with vegetables tossed in spicy green chutney and served with crunchy garlic flakes. Loved it. Sumptuous and Value for money (Rs 240)

BHINDIBAZAR CHICKEN TIKKA : tandoor grilled chicken morsels served with chutney and onion salad. Six sizeable portions amazingly done. Recommended ( Rs 290)

GRILLED FISH MEUNIERE : classic grilled fish (three fillet of bhetki) with lemon butter sauce and vegetables and french fries. Extremely well done but tad overpriced at Rs 560

GRID RICH CHOCOLATE MONTE CARLO : Rich chocolate cake , hazlenuts , cheese cake chunks layered with chocolate icecream. Nice stuff for chocolate freaks easily sharable by 3 people at Rs 240

Two vodka cocktails SEX ON THE BEACH and KAIPIROZKA , the former mixed wonderfully and recommended (Rs 300 each)

Two large pegs of bacardi white rum (Rs 400 each) and a bacardi orange breezer ( Rs 200)

The service needs a lot of improvement. There was a great delay in serving food and clearing our cheque. It was my sister's birthday i personally requested the staff to write a birthday message over the dessert and surprise her; what came was a plastic tag on the chocolate montecarlo. Infact The staff came back to ask what exactly is to be written in front of her , Seemed stupid actually . Not a place to expect special arrangements on occasions like birthdays.

Slightly overrated but guess because we went on a weekday. The food was good, very good indeed. The fish and chips and the lasagna was good. Cocktail too was good. However the place was not that lively but the seating was good though.

The food was amazing. The garlic bread was so soft and served more than 3 easily. The service was fast. The grilled fish was amazing and cooked perfectly. We had ordered the monte carlo and they gave us their baileys dessert for free which they claimed was their best dessert and we totally agreed right after the first bite. It's not even expensive and totally worth every penny and minute. We're definitely gonna go back üíØ

One of my favourite places in the city! Be it the F & B menu, hospitality, ambiance or music - The Grid wins hands down. Guptaji toast is awesome, but do try Wicked after Dark - as the name suggests it is as sinful as it can get. This place deserves a visit at least twice a week - if not everyday!

Cheers to the team!

Visited their food stall at The Farmer's Market held at Taj Bengal today. The stall was managed well by three people. Service was very good and the staff was very well behaved,egging us on to try their food. The items we tried were crispy vegetable fingers, Bombay chicken wings with crumbled blue cheese, chicken berry pulao and Gupta ji toast. The veg fingers were crispy and tasty. The chicken wings were simply amazing! The blue cheese however was not good at all. The berry pulao tasted alright,I think it needs more berries in it. Gupta ji toast is actually a small grilled chocolate sandwich. The toast is covered in chocolate sauce and icing sugar and served hot to you. It's a very delectable dessert. We all took second helpings of this!! I am definitely going to visit the restaurant which is situated at Topsia with my friends.

Read till the end: This place is awesome..love the ambience and the hospitality of the staff but but but... I noticed they are not nice to the woman of our own country. The manager is soo rude.. I was comfortable there but he wouldn't allow woman to have a seat which is unused at some other table. Now that is rude.. we as countrymen would want our ppl to feel good.
Note : would love to be here everytime i want to party but avoid coz he showed disrespect to the woman of our country. I would like to mention the woman he dealt wrongly with, was not my associate or friend. And he did it atleast thrice in front of me with other woman. This did hurt me. The owner can call me anytime and I would love to tell him/her in details about this. Ps : I was served by the staff in a very friendly way and would want to thank the owners for such a pleasant experience otherwise.

If you choose to be a pub rather than a lounge then u need to keep the music at a volume where people could hear each other across the table.
The DJ was good as well, enjoyed the music.

Been there yesterday,such an amazing place with good food,ambience,music and service.They have an amazing bar.Its quite a huge place.Be it dining or drinking it's very much comfortable place.They serves hookah too and have a separate smoking amazing.Well it was difficult to find the place will suggest to give a big board so that people can easily find it.
Totally different themed and got to know why is it planned so.The grids are eye catching and the interior is well decorated.What I liked about the place since earlier before the pub/restaurant was built,there used to be a factory which got closed and later on rebuilt into restaurant cum pub.So they gave it a factory themed with grids and the waiters wear what workers used to wear.So a very different concept of thinking which is mind blowing‚ù§
So a must visit to all.Well they serve good food too.
Pastas and mocktails are yumilicious .
Grid box is a different item added into the menu.
Overall nice place ‚ô•

Thanks to Grid Team to give this city such a great place. The master mind of this place has taken the art into next level of innovation n perfection. The Graphics on the glass screen, the wakiest glassware for the Cocktails are something where people will taste innovation , every corner of the Grid is unique, it has multiple levels which all gives different experience..
I  am sure Grid is coming up with more surprises for us.
The Grid is the must visit place in Kolkata..

Newly open place at topsia .located at ground floor. It was Friday night and the outlet was totally packed.I was with my friend and we got the table after 30 minutes. The manager at the entrance door helped us to get a table inside . The entrance door was big with a huge signage. 

The ambience and the interiors inside was mind blowing. I can say world class . It's a big place and they have board room. Banquet for small get together. Restaurant .Pub and a seperate hookah zone. So I can say this place can cater 500 people approx in there seperate section. 

Music was really too good . Great job done by DJ Harish ,one of the best music in kolkata .
Coming to food part. Being vegetarian I ordered there veg pizza and veg kebab and paneer roll. The pizza was thin crust and perfect Crispy . Kebab platter and paneer roll was mouth watering. My friend ordered gandhraj fish , green chilli chicken. The presentation of food was out of world . Chef of the grid has really done great job. I guess he is one of the best chef in kolkata . 

Service  I found staffs were well groomed ,very attentive ,polite and friendly with Guest. There service was excellent . They suggested to take LIIT and they has suggested one Mocktail to us I forgot the name. The cocktail and Mocktail both were good and the presentation was different. Bar display was with full of almost all type of alcohol. Lots of people were taking hookah at hooka zone but we did not try .

Although it's little expensive then any other pub in kolkata but it's full value for money. Overall a perfect place to go with your friends and family . Great job done by The Grid management team. I strongly recommend this place .

After using this outlet quite a no. Of times, we had a very bad experience the other day. They have a nice ambience, decent service ,  good food & are prices on the higher side, but still I don't understand why do they need to pour less qty in the measured drinks. We had ordered quite a no. Of rounds of drinks & from the first round served to us we were asking for the measurer to be given & their courteous staff were unable to trace the measurer for us & after the 5th reminder they had to get the measurer to us & nothing surprised us as all the measurers had atleast 10ml less poured & all they had to say was it just happend for the first time & they were very sorry & ...... Finally to my utmost surprise they even had the courage to charge us for the full amount even for the drinks they had not served. 

Would suggest ppl to be a bit careful & use the outlet cautiously.

The best place i have visited by far in Kolkata! It clearly defines what a lounge looks like and it stands out when compared to all the lounges in Kolkata. From ambience to food to service to everything-PERFECT! This could be a chain that could give chills to the leading bar chains in Mumbai. And i havent given you guys a perfect rating because i didnt get to taste your freshly brewed beers! Other than that just want to wish you guys best of luck! Cheers

the interiors is very good.its reasonable too.but the food is not that great and cocktails are average.The place has different levels if you are looking for private party.It has a dance floor too.It has areas to hold big and small private parties.we went on a Saturday and the crowd was huge. the melon salad was good and was something like cafe mezzuna.The chicken starter which they tried to make is similar like chilli chicken was not good.and the pasta in pesto cream sauce was average.great place to party for youngsters.As I had heard a lot about the place I was a bit disappointed otherwise its ok.should try once for the interiors and beer.

Thanks & Regards

So finally my review about The Grid

The worst part about the place is, the feeling of disappointment when you step out to find yourself in Kolkata.

The ambience was surely different as we sat under the raw ceiling with dim lights,amidst the yellow poles and the undone walls. 
Being quite unsure abt the food, we still had to order a variety of veg dishes n cocktails as we were six of us.

We chose to order their signature Cocktails like White wine sangria,
Smoky tennesse, Aam kheera crimson n Tiki cocktail.
Grid Box kept us nibbling with our drinks n hukka till the starters arrived. 
The Moroccan Salad n Feta Cheese Roll kept us on going with our chit chats, in no time our main course dishes were served.
Coriander noodles,Herb rice n Paprika & the platters both Mezze n Indian  filled us to the brim.
The taste n quality of food n cocktails combined with excellent service are worth applauding!
Could not have asked for more..

On enquiring about "The Grid" , we were delightedly spellbound to know that it is a Brand born in Kolkata itself.
Hats off to the maker for fulfilling n rewarding Kolkata. 
We, Kolkatians feel gratified of "the place that is ours".
Wish to see The Grid travel multicities and make us feel proud !
Awaiting for the several beers to flow....

I went here on a weekday evening for a friend's birthday celebration. The service is pretty fast but they took really long to serve a few things like a Cosmopolitan and a Monte Carlo. But several things like a Rosti could use improvement. Many food items were ordered along with three to four rounds of drinks for the 7 of us, three hukkahs and a few dessert items. The bill was around 10k. The place is very well built and designed. Very spacious with many levels and an awesome full service bar with nifty Lego models and full length LED screen on top where they could even display a birthday greeting for your friend. They have a brewery behind the bar separated by a glass screen but when we asked what beers they serve they only said Heineken and Corona. 
Good waiters and well spoken staff are serving the place. They had valet too. 

All in all they are a very good place and Calcutta needs more places like these. Good job guys.

On a recent trip to the city of joy we arrived at Grid ( a new hot spot about which everyone is talking about)and we were not disappointed at all.loved everything ..the decor,the music(though very loud)and the vibe of course.We tried van wala noodles with chicken,mezze platter,garlic naan mutton rolls and pizzas.The mezze was the best i had in times and the naan roll was unique and very soft.The place is over packed and pricing is pocket friendly.We tried gupta toast,again very unusual and yumm..the best part was the mud pie with a brandy centred and soft..superb..Grid you will see us next time and soon..

WOW!!! This is what i exclaimed on entering this place. It took us a while to get a place as it was crowded on a Saturday evening. Without wasting time we thought of taking a tour of the restaurant which was spread over different floors and segments. The bar counter was huge and the LED srceens were something very new to Kolkata bars. AFter standing for sometime on the ground floor we got a space at the mezzanine floor which was also a smoking area. Everything from the ash trays to the water bottles were very stylish and quirky. The casual uniform of the waiters was again pretty interesting. I loved the music which was being played. They played everything from One Direction to George Michael and Michael Jackson. My husband and friends ordered for alcohol while i stuck onto ¬†a virgin mohito. The mohito was a usual one. Coming to food we ordered for bombay chicken wings initially. Loved the taste but did not like the white yogurt sauce along with it. The combination did not work for us. Then we ordered for a non veg Grid Box platter which had prawn chicken rashmi kababs, stuffed fish fingers. The presentation was really impressive. But there is much room for improvement when it comes to the quality and taste of the food. The kababs were mouth watering but the fish items were average and oily. The waiters were very busy as it was a full house and we had to wait for quite sometime before we could clear our payment. Its a great new place to hang around. I would rather visit the Grid than visiting any other discs in Park Street area. Lovely ambiance combined with good music and service makes it an excellent hang out. Coming to the price point... Well its not exuberantly priced compared to the ambiance.

The GRID - replicating it's name; this microbrewery is bifurcated into different grids/sections.

The interiors are nicely done which jazz up the place. Like the Lego blocks which give the Bar a picturesque effect or the plant vines which give the Beer Garden a perfect look! A monochrome effect at the top level for the closed door seating!

Global Food with Local flavors!

For Appetizers Killer Corn Cream Cheese & Green Onion Tikki had a perfect blend of flavors.

Mocktails were a lil disappointing - Be it
Davidoff Cool Water or the Lychee Gulkand Mojito. But in case you are an Ice tea person you would absolutely love the Elderflower Hibiscus Icetea - it's refreshing and will appeal to your taste buds.

Dessert: Baileys Irish Cream Mudpie, at the first look one will be charmed by the presentation but trust me it tastes equally good.

But I do have complaints with the person taking the order for not recommending to me the in-house special Guptaji‚Äôs Chocolate Toast, a friend later recommended me.

Should visit this quirky place in town, a table reservation suggested though!

Absolutely loved the experience here. The decor is fantastic. Its quite spacious and has various seating areas on different levels so its not cramped up at all unlike most pubs. The other thing i loved was the service. Very friendly and took great care also gave my friends (birthday girls) a beautiful chocolate cake. I tried two pizza's and i particularly liked Fungi more. The mix sauce pasta was great! We could customise the dish as well. So that's a plus.  A big thumbs up.  Since i went in the afternoon i am not sure of the ambiance for a good nightlife and thus 4.5 . Looking forward to visiting The Grid again.

Choose this happening place for the buzz it has created not only on zomato but also the social media. Went there on a Monday evening and the place had decent rush.

Coming to the ambience looks good and beautiful. Created a nice grid like structure....several private dining areas for bulk booking....separate smoking room....huge bar counter with big LED screens.

Coming to the food. Very average.
#bohri style mutton- was tasty
#barush wala chakhna- average
# karnal dhaba paneer- was very hard and lacked taste and flavour
#bombay chicken wings- good
#bhindibazar chicken-average

# hookhas were good.

Service was ok. Since some items they forgot to serve....there was delay in service. So it was little disappointing but the staff kept a smile on his face and apologised. Also since it was my birthday....they flashed the same on the LED screens above the bar counter so it was nice.

Loud music but good.

I happening place with everything happening around you , from interiors to music to crowd to food everything is happening.  Let's go step by step,
The ambience was great , the high bar with Lego design , the giant projectors , the private seating areas , every bit is brilliantly done .the place gives you energetic vibes the moment you enter.  The food was really great I must say . Normally the food is average at lounges and bars but this place is exceptional.  We had 4 season pizzas ( amazing crust ) tandoori platter which came along with nan and black dal ( a must try ) paneer wrap again very well prepared . The presentation of food matched equally with its taste . The service was very prompt I must say , the staff was very courteous and friendly . The serving time was also fast , I have nothing to complain about . The hookah was good , I would not say it was the best but was good enough . One the whole a very good experience would love to try other things on the menu

THE Place. As anyone who has been there can tell you, its THE Place. A place too good for Kolkata. Going there was an excellent idea specially when the monotony of other places had bored the shit out of us. So we took the plunge, and it yielded a great result. Though we only heard good things about the place from our friends & associates, the place still managed to outmatch our expectations.

Neatly designed & made with precision, the interiors blew us, I mean not quite literally, but it did blew us. The steward that served us was very well behaved, something which is quite unusual these days. The presentation of the food was also intriguing (the portions we ordered), and to top it all of, food was really toothsome - a cherry on top !

All in all, it is a Must Visit if you can dig a little deep in your pockets. Yes, that might be a hitch for some of us, but the place is worth it, after all it sets you in an ecstatic mood.

This place is soo damn amazing.  Absolutely stunning and different interior.  One will feel like he is in Hard Rock type of pub!  Ample seating nd different level of seating made the ambience amazing.  Superfast service,  i still dnt understand why ppl were saying tht the service is slow.  There were no cover charges.  Price is also quite sufficient.  They dont charge service tax!  Food quality and quantity is amazing.  Courteous staff.  All in all amazing.  Just that they can work up on their menu.  A lot of improvement can be done in cass of including items in their menu.  The price is quite decent.  You can check the bill!

Great place to hang out with friends. Ambience is good. I don't like LIT served at many places, may b because the mix is not good. But I loved the LIT they serve. Food was also nice. Music & hookah sets the mood right.

Been eyeing this place for a while now and finally decided to catch up with a few friends here. The food absolutely stole my heart. The kebabs, the garlic bread were amazing. But what stole the show was the fish fingers, delicious!!!! Was a little disappointed that they still have not been able to start the brewery but that gives lot more reasons to come back and try new things here...

The place is amazing! The place has a great ambience ,good music and a great place to hangout with friends. Now let's talk about the drinks and food we had ordered. We had ordered long island iced tea,martini,cosmopolitan and mojito for drinks and marghareita pizza and nachos for food. The long island iced tea and the martini were very strong,the cosmopolitan was a really light and good drink ,the mojito was a light refreshing drink,the pizza was a thin crusted pizza(I thought it was really dry and chewy too) and the nachos were the highlight of the day(a complete must order). Overall the service was really quick,the ambience and the interior was beautiful.

The most happening place in town! ¬†You will fall in love for sure. The overall ambiance - Good music, great lighting, amazing seating arrangements and the stunning decor!¬†

We ordered a Barbecue Chicken Pizza, Gandharaj fish, Schezwan spiced fish & Green Chilli Chicken. Each of these dishes tasted good. Also, we ordered Cosmopolitan and few other cocktails & shots which were perfect.

Service is great. Price: Little on the higher side.

Absolutely Recommended!

P.S. Management is reluctant to show the menu with prices on Zomato! I fail to understand why! Makes it easier for common people to decide the budget and have an overall idea about the bill.

Cover charge at The Grid?? Well pujas in kolkata are the main revenue earning time .1000 each person as cover charge was not too high though. I must add I had one of the best experience here. Too good music..very nostalgic.feet tapping .old classic numbers . Very good staff prompt and alert. Service was very quick (even though it was like a full restaurant ). Quality of food and drink  a 4.8 out of 5. Had yum montecarlo. Must visit place with good crowd and ambience .

One of most unique decor and I must say that it impressed. The place delivers what it wants to, a place for drinks, Hokkah, music and fast food for friends. 
The amritsari aloo along with the four seasons pizza were impressive and so were the spicy coriander noodles. The crispies didn't disappoint either and for those with a taste for Thai; the Thai green currey is worth trying. The Virgini Mojito along with the cold coffee (delivered very late) too were respectable. A must visit!

The Place looked fantastic.  The decor was so good and the inside was so well furnished. And the food was as good as the place. Ordered chilli chicken and grilled chicken. The mashed potato was the best i had ever had. Mocktails were nice. But with such good quality of food would have been more ecstatic if there was more variety in chicken dishes. Butbi loved the place. Will come again.

A brewery in the making. This is what Calcutta needs.
Visited this place on a Thursday. It was almost full.

Music was picking up, but for that point of time.it could have been better.
 
The ambience and the atmosphere was amazing.

Coming to the food, we ordered garlic bread, sex on the beach and their special naan rolls.
Food was good but there was nothing great about it.

Shisha was decent.

Overall, good but not a great experience.

Location: It is in the Buildings just opposite to the Porsche Showroom in Tangra. You wont be able to see it from main Road. Drive a few meters down the apartments, you are going to see the Main Entrance. Don't Worry, in the Main Road there is a Direction Board for "The Grid". Not very tough to find. 

Ambiance: The solid Door opens to the Reservation Desk, which again opens to the Energetic, Bustling, New Brewery of Town. They have taken the concept of "The Grid", literally to make a chic, urban decor.  It somehow reminds me of the decor of "Toit" in Bangalore. But "the Grid" is more eye-catching and flattering. The Main Restaurant have 4 types of accommodations: 1) The High Tools with High Chairs, 2) The Standing Tables, 3) The low table-chair arrangements and 4) The Couches. Just a level up, there are few more sitting arrangements, which I think is more for families. Overlooking the main restaurant, a floor up,  there is a Private Party Area and Smoking Zones. The Bar is located at a side. Behind it are the Brewery Cylinders. The Light is absolutely adequate. Enough to read the menu and at the same time giving illusion of private place. The DJ area is above. Songs, played were peppy and High, mostly from 90's English pop bands. (Rating 5/5)

Drinks: We are high Cocktail guys and love to experiment with our drinks. So, we asked our Drinks Order Taker to suggest, about their specialty. The reply came was" If you want to try anything new, you need to come between Monday to Thursday. Fri-Sun, due to rush, they stick to their menus." I think that's very logical and checked the cocktail Menu, which had only Classical Cocktails listed. So I tried a "Long Island Iced Tea", a "Cava" style Cocktail, I hove forgotten the name, which is basically a White wine Sangria and "Kamikaze" Shooter. As far as the Cocktail Recipe goes, they were perfect. The White Wine sangria is properly sugared. The alcohol content in The long Island iced Tea was good (Not sugary, which many other restaurants make, for mass appealing. In fact it was slight pungent and bitter, which I liked). The Kamikaze was also ok. Presentation of Cocktails, was  not fancy, but ok. Long Island was served on a Pisner Glass, rather than a Regular Highball one, which is fine for me. The White Wine sangria glass was perfect Wine glass, My Wife's cosmopolitan was also served in proper Cocktail Glass. So, the only hole was the menu, as I already mentioned. Seriously Guys, only 3 shooters in  menu? 1 star deducted for the Cocktail and shooter menu. Other than Cocktails, they had good liquor listing. The price is slightly high. (Rating 4/5)

Food:  Properly priced and good in proportion, in reference to these type of establishments. The names were quite fancy, but the food taste wise was quite familiar. We had some veg cheese rolls, which was quite good taste wise. There was some chicken and tangy sauce preparation, again I had forgotten the name, which was suggested by our order taker. It was very common. Almost every restaurants use to keep this dish. I didn't like it.  We had some Nun Rolls, which was ok. To end we had some mudpie style dessert, named like: " Evil and Dark" or something like that., which can easily be shared by 4 person. As a chocolate love, I absolutely enjoyed it. Base was brownie, properly toasted and got presented on a frying pan. The center had some marshmallows, with molten chocolates. it came accompanied with Orio Biscuits. All food was presented well, and each of the dishes can be shared easily by 2-4 people.  (Rating 4/5)

Service: Needs huge improvements here. We came there at 8:00 p.m and asked the reservation desk to get us a sitting arrange, while we are managing with a standing table. We left at 11:00 p.m.and by this 3 hours, the reservation desk failed to get us a seat. We saw groups coming much later, getting seats. We followed up with Reservation desk and  the order takers, quite a no of times and the only reply, which came was "We are Trying" from the reservation Desk and "The reservation Desk manages this" from the Order Takers. At last, when we were leaving, the order taker, was soo embarrassed, he said: "May be the groups, who are coming late and getting a seat had already reserved a table". Sorry Brother!! we are not going to buy this. We already tried with reserving a table and the answer was: " It is First Come First Serve basis and No Reservation Taken." My impression over this is: May be the Reservation Desk work more for guests, who had previously well built rapport with them. I don't see that's something bad, because, after all your regular customers are the ones, who would be returning than some Experimental Restaurant Hoppers. But, please build up a good co ordination with the Order Keepers. The people, who are sticking only over a Shisha or a pint of Beer, can manage with a standing table, But guys on cocktail or more serious hard drinks needs one seating arrangement. This type of information from order takers, will help you guys to judge over your decision of seating arrangements more. May be it was a rush day or something, but on the service palate, it was not enjoyable. So only 1, for providing us the standing table for 3 hours.(Rating 1/5)

Suggestions: ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†1) Improve on Coctail/Shooter Menu¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 2) Reservation desk needs to stick to their First Come First Serve Policy.

Food/Drinks Suggested: The Chocolate and Marshmallow dessert, if you are a chocolate lover like me.

P.S: They also serve shishas, but we hadn't tried any. Am not a Beer lover, and we hadnot tried any Beer there. A sin, I know, while visiting a Brewery. I found mentioning they Serve Draught Beer. Not able to check and validate the same. But, from a Brewery, I would expect more than just Draught Beer. They must have different styles of Beer, like "Toit" in Bangalore have.

Overall rating: (3.5/5)

After 2 years when I came to Kolkata... this is the must-visit place that everyone recommended. Honestly apart from the interiors of the place which def. is fabulous, I didn't like it very much coz of very poor service. Mixing orders, forgetting orders, misbehaving with my guest (which they later apologised for)... there were loads of things that went south. Shisha was good and food was garnished well but our mood was already spoilt enough to comment on taste.

Expected better service from a place that had sucha buzz in town.

Kolkata is on a roll. Being a food lover, I can bet with open hands kolkata is embracing a new trend ' GASTROPUBS ' they are opening at least one or two in a month, within this year. 
The Grid is the latest addition to it. The Ambience, the interiors, the concept everything is wow! I am lost of words for all the lovely type of places I am getting to visit in Kolkata itself. 
The food and drinks menu are all mouthwatering and I can bet my money that you will never say you did not enjoy the place. Coz on a Monday evening I went down to the place & I had nothing to complain. Just go for it. Loved it.

Starting with the ambience of the place I would like to give a shoutout to whoever was the face behind the interiors. Totally unique and out of the box *wink wink* , loved the vibes of the place. The food was Amazing as well which adds The Grid on my visit again list. We ordered the sirarcha chilli chicken and the bhindibazaar kebab as appetisers and the BBQ chicken and margarita pizza with a chicken lasagna which was really creamy and decadent. Definitely a great place to hang out at.

Having heard a lot about the place, we decided to visit on a Sunday night. And I was very pleasantly surprised to find it bubbling with energy, loud music, people dancing, which until now I thought was a very rate site in Kolkata! I guess we were just in need of such places. Very very well done, great music. We tried the Bombay sandwich, which was absolutely fantastic. And the sangria was like an actual cocktail, not the sugar syrups that are served elsewhere! All in all a great experience.

Bang opposite to the Porsche showroom at Topsia. The Grid has one of the finest interiors and is extremely well organized to begin with. Their brewery is going to start off soon which will attract a huge crowd in the near future I'm guessing. The cocktails weren't very great esp. the LIIT, the finger-food was lip smacking with not enough quantity and a tad bit over priced. You should visit atleast once for the amazing ambience.

The place is beyond awsome.

The music was good, the interior awsome, and the staffs were very well-behaved and perfectly trained.

Coming to the food.

We ordered the stuffed musroom, the noodles and the amritsari alloo.

They were perfectly cooked and had great taste especially the noodles ( i m a fan now). 

The hookah was however horrible especially when you are charging over 600 INR for it. Had to request repeatedly for smoke check yet there was hardly any improvement and thats the reason for a 4 pt rating.

The restaurant however is not that expensive as it is talked about. 

We ordered a Black and White wisky, a vodka with orange juice, a hookah, and the food i just mentioned above and the bill amount was 2250 which i believe was to the par considering the kind of awsome ambiance it had.

Moreover the restaurant took no service charge as compared to other places which charges upto 10% service charge on your bill amount. So didn't mind leaving a healthy tip behind.

Would love to visit again with friends and family and would recommend others to do the same. Just don't disappoint with the hookah again.üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä

We visited the place for lunch on Sunday 11/09/2016. First, the Pros - a) Amazing interiors b) Great music and ambience .

Unfortunately it stops there only. Cons - 

¬†a) Extremely overpriced. We ordered the NOn Veg basket that barely contained a few pieces of chicken kebabs and fish fingers. prawn wafers are a rip off as they prawn scented papads and not containing any real prawn. All this for 550rs +taxes. Also fingers were highly salted even though they were crisp. 

b) The spaghetti ala aglio with chicken was a disappointment with an overpowering smell of basil and heavy dose of salt. With the restaurant barely 25 % full on a sunday there was no excuse for such a mess.

c) They had no beer except Corona which was disappointing considering they advertise themselves as a microbrewery. Also wait staff while being polite, needs to be trained as they had no clue about items on the menu. 

Bottomline: For a pocket pinch for 1200 bucks minus alcohol, the city has much better options. Go there if you must to experience the decors, but I don't think it is up to the mark as far as food is concerned.

This is such a fun place! Went there on a wednesday night and the place was literally buzzing! The vibe and ambience is fantastic, decor is fun, food is good, staff is friendly and the service is super fast! The only negative instance we faced was with the senior staff. We had a reservation for 8.30 and when we reached at 8.40 our table was not ready. Fair enough. But we had to shift twice after that to finally get the table assigned to us. Now that table was literally for 4 people at the max and we were 6 of us and the lady Stewart just refused to understand the table would be uncomfortable for us. Finally after alot of arguing she gave us another table. So it started a bit rocky but in the end it was a super fun night. Also, desserts arent that great - can totally avoid those extra calories there! 

I don't remember the names of all the dishes but we had the juhu noodles, egg kejriwal, one alu tikki sort, a sautted mushrooms, the moroccon veges, watermelon salad - all were yumm! U can avoid the mushroom balls and the naan rolls. Enjoy! :)

The ambience and feel of this place is really good. We ordered for blue lagoon sheesha - the smoke was good but the flavour was average. We ordered for nan rolls - which was good but the mixed sauce pasta was below average. Also we had gone at 4 pm and we had very limited vegetarian options to eat. Overall is an okay-ish place.

Very good ambiance. I went on a thursday and the place for vibrant, lively, and upbeat. Good music, yet at a volume where you can have a converstaion. Attentive servers, good selection of items with a variety of selections taht ahs something for everyone. Service was very quick. Quality of ingredients and the preparation of items is fantastic. Definitely recommend this place. Mind=blown.

This is the most psychedelic experience in Calcutta when it comes to chilling at a lounge. The space is huge with multiple themed locations and tables - all coupled with fine cocktails, terrific Service, decent food and a sensational Hookah! 

Great stuff!

Located just below ojas banquet. Place was on my wishlist since it had been opened. It is beautifully made, I was wonderstruck with the interiors. Ambience was soothing. Place was huge, divided into many sections. We had ordered Burger with potatoes wedges, enchiladas,  Virgin Mojito,  choco flake shake, and a mocktail. The day when I had visited was a dry day, so missed their cocktails. Will surely visit again. 
Recommended 
Cheers!!

It's located near Ojas banquets. 
The ambience is great. The feel inside is very cool. Spacious and nice place. Choice of music is nice too. 
Tables are mostly you can stand. Maybe they can increase number of chairs in case want to accommodate more people. 
Interesting options on the menu. Food is good. 
Stuffed mini nan rolls and pasta are good.

The Grid is Kolkatas new hot spot which seems to be doing great. The ambience of this place is brilliant. I've been here 5-6 times. As great as the place is, the service is that bad. The waiters and managers here treat you like theyre doing you a favour. We ordered 4 drinks and 2 items to eat , which on a Friday at 7 pm was given to us in 1 hour.
The Lotus Stem in Green Chilli Sauce, The Noodles in Green Chilli Sauce is great.
Personally I didn't like the Feta Cheese Rolls.

Beer is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. They charge more than 350 for a single Bira Blonde.

It would be great place IF they could improve their service. I don't think I'll be going there for a while. Not at least they only take in the number of people they can serve properly.

A very sudden decision to go to The Grid. Proved to be a wonderful afternoon and I'm definitely coming back! 
Amazing ambience, wonderful music. Food quantity is great! 
We ordered- 
Amritsari Bhatti ke aloo which was good. 
Feta cheese rolls were good too! 
The Greek mezze was my favourite. Lovely presentation and super filling. The dips were good and loved the olive prep on the side. 
We didn't have the space to eat more but with a name like Guptaji's chocolate toast, we had to order that one. And it was huge! Six pieces of chocolate toast garnished with delicious nuts. Must try! 
Loved the place.

Location-Topsia,near ford showroom.

This place was on my checklist since it opened.We went there last week and was wonderstruck by the interiors of this cafe.It was so beautifully made that you will fall in love with this place.The ambiance is also very soothing.And the service is quite on average side.Now coming to foodstuffs-the sheesha they serve was second-rate but other item were good,especially the cocktail which was coffee flavoured and the "naan roll" with dip.But this place is extremely over priced especially the sheesha which was Rs650+tax.

Food-3.5/5
Service-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

*Should visit this place once only to have a look over their interiors.

Invited by my nephew who has a DJ residency there, I went without much expectation but was happily surprised by both the ambience and the music. It's a multi level space with both s bar and a lounge area. The interiors are funky and so is the seating! The food was a bit blah and the drinks not as chilled as I would have liked but the service was top notch and attentive. The best part was the booming sound system that evoked memories of a night club but without a real dance floor we were left literally shaking our legs while sitting! For great tunes and a chance to catch up with friends and family over drinks this is a must do and a real welcome addition to the Calcutta (yeah it will always be a Calcutta!) hip scene...

After a long time putting 5 on Zomato . Its goonna be city s best pub in coming days. Amazing innovative decor, soothing lights, good music, well dressed and extremely well behaved staffs , reasonable pocket friendly and what not !! And Irish house gonna get tough competition from it . Making it my bookmark for my future visit undoubtably. Worth visit there. Just a small drawback is its location but that can be overlooked because everything cant be perfect.

With positive reviews about the place, this had been on my checklist for quite long. Finally!
This place is more like what Calcutta needs.
Starting with the food to the cocktails to the ambience and not to forget, the music.
Thumps up for the effort!

Might pinch your pocket a little more than expected.
P.S. The service is more towards the slower side.

Must visit. Cheers! üçæ

I am quiet amazed with the new places that are opening in Kolkata offlate.Each place is soo soo different and adds some liveliness to this city with its uniqueness.The craziest place to chill in Kolkata is The Grid undoubtedly .It is one of my favourites and I would love to visit it sooner and sooner!

It is well said that What Socials is to Mumbaikars, The grid is to Kolkatans....Whatta vibrant place to chill at with friendss....The ambience is just superb specially the lego figurines and ceiling lights.The entire section is divided into sections and that's what makes it look like a Grid .The place is huge divided into different sections.

We got a small cool section in the corner from where we could see what all is happening around.I would'nt post the pictures of the ambience as I would want each of you all to have a look at this place and feel the vibrance.

The music is insane and the food is delicious too.The menu is quiet interesting.It has food dishes named quiet interestingly.

 Coming on to food, we ordered for Cispy chilli babycorn and tokyo chickpeas which was really good in taste.

Tokyo chickpea was the   inhouse speciality and was cooked quiet well.

We then ordered for Pizzas and lebanese platter.The pizzas were okayish and the platter was simply great.
The platter was quiet foodsome  and the dips were simply wow...The Falafels were really crisp and delicious.It is must must try for the lebanese food lovers...

The deserts also looked yummy but we could'nt order for more as we were quiet full with the main course dishes and appetizers.

I am surely visiting this place for the deserts and I am gona review it soonnn..

A wonderful place to go with friends.....amazing! Simply amazing! Food should be leveled up several notched further up! Non veg was better than veg. It was perfectly priced and the portions were also good.
I would surely recommended going there for a casual night or even a party.
They should also open up a dance floor! That will just be the icing on the cake!

I heard about The Grid from a friend. I very eager to visit this place after my friends told me that it was an awesome place. Very Nice Interiors. Very courteous staff. Its Totally Different from any other place in Kolkata. But I think it had a very little, very minute resemblence to The Great Booze Story only when i looked up to the Pipes. Apart from this it is a total badass. Nice Ambience. Nice Food. Nice CockTails. One More thing Here many of the Staff is from Afraa in CC1 and The Great Booze Story. All are very Nice and Helpful. Loved the Place. Waiting for the Brewery To Start its Magic.

I've been to The Grid Twice. I must applaud the owner for creating such a huge and beautiful place in Kolkata. It's huge, that decor is amazing so is the crowd but the service kills the feel. My first experience wasn't as bad but I went again last week and was extremely disappointed. Firstly the music was SO LOUD that we could not speak to each other at all! It's a pub not a night club. Even the waiter couldn't take our order properly. And this was 8pm. The microbrewery hasn't started yet and the only beer they keep is Corona or Bira at extremely expensive rates. We ordered for 3 dishes, 4 drinks and one hookah. The lotus stems were horrible, almost as if it was cooked the previous night. The pizzas were ok ok. The crepe never came so can't tell you about that. The staff who took our order didn't note down anything and so nothing was being served to us. Only 3 of the 4 drinks came after 45mins of placing he order and constant reminder. The hookah always choking from the start. We cancelled our orders and left the place becuase the experience was so bad.

We entered this place and loved the ambience and the music. I must say a lot of effort has been put in the interior of the place. There were staff running around here and there to serve the guests. One table was attended by at least 2-3 different waiters. This created a lot of confusion. One person took the order, some other person brought the food, and a third person was available for reorder. Now comes the amazingly bad part.
We decided to order our food. We ordered for two dishes - some rice and spinach baked dish (vegetarian) and "Grid earth burger" (vegetarian). I pointed the names of the dishes on the menu card to the person taking the order, because if I tried telling him verbally, it could have caused confusion as the music was loud and he barely could listen to what I was saying. Eventually he brought the food. The rice and spinach dish was very good and tasty. The burger was well served with fries and ketchup. When I took my first bite of the burger, I fell something fishy. The cutlet/patty that was inside the burger did not give me a familiar "vegetarian" feeling. My wife had a look and asked the waiter (some fourth person) what exactly he has served us. He looked at the burger and with a bright wide smile on his face, he replied "chicken burger". I felt devastated. I am a pure vegetarian since birth and this incident kinda shook me a little. I was about to blast the waiter left right and centre, but I kept my composure and asked him to get the manager. It took more than ten mins for the manager to arrive at our table. When he came I narrated him the entire incident. He started looking for the waiter who took the order, later he looked for the waiter who delivered the order and he spoke to the person who informed us that the burger we are having is actually chicken burger. Everyone was talking to each other with no eventual outcome. They apologised and I had no other option but to leave the place immediately. I paid for my food and left. Overall a horrible experience.

The GRID could be Kolkata's answer to The Social, even if with with an overpriced menu. The fire tanks was one of the first things that caught my eye- it surely makes for the best things at their outlet. Next, of course comes the Lego counters that's a refreshing change as well! The ambience over...

Visited this place this weekend , and as expected the placed was packed ! Had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table but the over all experience was quite good ! The food although not exceptional ,was above average! We ordered for Thai curry and four seasons pizza to accompany our drinks ! The interiors are quite nice giving you a typical young rustic feel. Area of improvisation includes the confused staff. Need to work on better trained personnel ,considering the place caters to big crowds ! However , I would definitely visit again :)

Amazingly done up place..fab work on the interiors, crafted intricately....ambience, music is  good..very different from what we generally find in kolkata..the food prepared and served is great too..just lagging behind is the time taken to serve anything except drinks at counter..be it a hookah or any dish ordered..by the time it reaches the table the smoking hot feel of food is gone..also if u ask for a spoon/water from some other guy apart from the one serving at your table you get nothing!

I love the place, ambience, food n the overall vibe that surrounds it. Located at  Tapsia, on the very busy road towards the park circus, it has ample parking in its premises and surprisingly parking has never been an issue here when you would think that it would be.

The ambience is great and they have given it a Industry type feel in the middle of the city with many plants and trees and rustic floor

Coming to food and drinks. One can order a pint or two if you are a couple,. It is a full serving bar and most of the renowned brands of scotch, whisky, vodka etc. are available. The mocktail and cocktail selection is pretty elaborate and good. In the starters section, my favorite is their thin crust yummy pizzas & amazing chicken tikka which they call in a different name, for vegetarian's feta roll and a plate of stuffed mushrooms are the best.

In main course, I liked the grilled chicken, pasta & of course the Rosti (the best in recent times).We were served a pastry complimentary for the birthday boy and ordered mud pie which we again reordered and enjoyed.Staffs are well behaved and this is a must visit place when you are in Kolkata.

My ratings are.

Food-4.5/5

Service-4/5

Overall-5/5

Just beside Winning Streak in topsia more, The GRID is more like a small pub type establishment. We were greeted by a very beautiful girl at the reception table and we could already hear the music from outside. She took us in and mind you, the interior decoration is just pretty. I like the ceiling, i like the smoking room, i like how they took the concept of the grid. We couldn't get a table for 4, so we waited for around 5mins inside while the servers ran here and there. Finally we got a table near to the washroom. Anyway, I would like to point out that I am hugely disappointed by their super slow service. We waited for at least 20 minutes for the food, drink and hookah menu all together. Not to mention, it is highly overpriced. We ordered a pizza worth about rs 490, 3 shakes and one four seasons Shiraz. The bill came around rs 1700. Was it worth it? No. We instead went somewhere else to eat, drink and smoke hookah. Not recommended for college students unless you are loaded and ready to throw into the air. The pizza, i did not find anything special. I am a culinary student and a future chef from a certified culinary college so when I think there's a huge room for chances in pizza and shakes, i mean it. But I loved the crowd. I loved the ambience. I loved the music. However, I did not like the service. I did not like the food. Would I still go there in the future? I don't know. Let's see.

The Grid, firstly, amazing ambience, really loved the interior and the place. Wasn't hard to find or reach. Good crowd found and everything really cool with the place. But, when you reach there, the service is too poor. They would attend you as soon as you call for them, but no idea when are they going to bring what asked for. We got a glass of water 20 mins after we asked for it. The hookah was too bad, we had to send it back right after the first puff, and it got worse after the coal change. We had to wait longer when we asked for the feedback form, and in the end, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY. 
Would love to visit the place again for the super cool ambience they made, but such service and hookah, would make me think again.

Located in topsia , this place is a newly opened restaurant. The interiors are pretty with dim lights and grids everywhere. The bar counter is interesting as there is a display of Lego figurines. There is a separate smoking room , an area for shisha and another for dining. We went here mainly for drinks and had whiskey sour , whiskey cobbler , tequila , big island ice tea , old fashion and Long Island ice tea. There were all good , like how they are supposed to taste and were presented well. For the food we ordered the firecracker chicken pizza , the chicken tikka ( bhindibazar ) and the rishikesh something. They were really , really delicious. Places like these tend to ignore the food and concentrate mainly on drinks. But this place is an exception. The food was lovely , the pizza , giving a really good spinach flavour to it , the chicken tikka , juicy and succulent and the rishikesh thing was crispy and cheesy. It's a lovely place to hang out and is love to come back here again !

This is in the same premises as my office at Topsia. The ambience is so different, it just surprises you everywhere you look. The unitanks, the Lego-inspired bar-front, the stools, the slightly higher deck and the mezzanine, everything is so nicely thought-out and well-spaced. The attention to detail is praise-worthy.

The food again, is very good. I went with my colleagues and we had the usual mojitos and lemonades in the beginning. The starters were all very good too. We ordered the fish box, the chicken and bacon box, a crispy chicken dish, Apollo fish(lip-smacking), the Bhindi Bazaar Chicken Tikka and some other ones. And also the Juicy Lucy burger, though not as juicy as the one you get at Delhi Heights, Gurgaon, was still one of the best burgers I've had in Kolkata yet. The peri-peri burgers were good too, I guess.

For dessert, we had the chocolate mudpie. It's unbelievably good. The quality of the chocolate, the waffle, the vanilla scoop, this one will make you wanna take the chef home. I'm going there again as soon as the microbrewery opens.

Highly recommended.

Name : The GRID
Location : Ojas Banquet building ( Opp. Porsche showroom) in Topsia
ate of Visit : 17/07/2016 ( Sunday )

The place opened up amidst huge hype in the market and the below review will tell if it's at all worth the hype.

Ambiance - Amazing . It is definitely the new benchmark in Kolkata for pubs/microbrewerries (Microbrewrry hasn't started yet but they say it should start soon , they are awaiting brewing license).
The grid like pattern across the roof , ¬†the old school lighting are all amazing. Special mention to a couple of sections - (i) The Beer Garden which had an elevated seating and vines. (ii) ¬†The Lego toys placed in the bar section. It was amazingly cute.

Service - ¬†Very good. We received food post 18 mins of ordering. ¬†Also we were informed each time a dish/bill was expected a ¬†bit late.
Special mention to our tender ROHAN ¬†who did a good job and made sure we had a good time.

Food/Beverage - The items we had
(i) Barbeque cottage cheese ¬†roll - It was heavenly. The filling to flour ratio was spot on, the taste was good. It was very spicy - just how we like it. It was served with a mustard with yoghurt infused dip and potato chips.
(Beware people who do not like spicy food as it bites a punch in the spicy/chilly space)

(ii) Corn Cream Cheese & Green Onion Tikki- It was good. Provided with a mustard dip. The tikki crumbled very easily and was very balanced out in taste. This proved to be a wonderful neutralizer post the spicy roll.

(iii) Reshapatti Panner - Was like a panner tikka but had a filling inside which was very flavoursome. provided with a green chutney, salad and tikka had fried bell peppers capsicum, onion and pineapple.
This too was a bit spicy but delicious.

Now to the drinks :

(iv) Chilli Mango - Spicy mango drinks with loads of spicy. It was presented wonderfully in a heavy marble kalash and served with spiced up lemon and chilly.¬†
This drink really packed a punch and is a very strong recommendation. The only downside would be that the quantity was very less.

(v) Hazlenut Ice Coffee - Not much to say here. It was good, not divine like the chilli mango.

We were so full that we couldn't order dessert. Would definitely try them next time and update the review.

Would have given this place a perfect 5 but the 0.5 deduction was for less quantity in the mocktail and tissues not present on the table (which we were provided on request by an ever smiling ROHAN.)
Forgot to take pic of Reshampatti Panner .

P.S. This place also serves non veg and alcohol.

Ok so I went there on the opening day and was quite amazed by the ambience but considering it was the opening night I thought it would have been much happening but sorry to say not like that. Also the service today was not that great but anyways I am sure with days to pass by it would definitely be better.  We just had two starters and some drinks and the stsrters proved to be OK. So finally as a whole on the basis of 1st day visit I would give it 3.5 out of 5. Hope it gives me a better experience the next time I go there.

The Grid, Kolkata's newest microbrewery, bar & kitchen opens its door today. a huge space with some astonishing decor & ample different sections to chill out with your friends & colleagues alike. In house DJs churning out groovy music, & the bar counter serving some finest in house brewed beers. I particularly liked the concept of using scaffolding to separate the various areas & usage of Lego bricks in the decorations. Also noteworthy are the sunken seating & lounge sections. Impressive & a must visit place. A sneak peak into the ambience & food, detailed blog post to follow soon.
