The kiosk is small and easy to miss, located on the first floor of CC2. We ordered chicken nuggets,  chicken garlic fries and fish fry.  The service was prompt and the hosts were quite helpful. The quality of food was decent. However I did feel the prices were a bit on the higher side. The quantity supplied was quite less for the price.

** Location = City Centre 2 Rajarhat.

** Brief = A very small outlet serving veg and non veg snacks.

** Ambiance = It is basically a kiosk, so nothing much of ambiance. But servers are friendly.

** Things Tried = Chicken Lollipop - decent in taste, nothing to be fascinated of.
Also tried their french fries and fountain coke.

** Overall = Low priced snacks and overall okayish as a kiosk.

It is just an outlet and thus no question of any ambiance. But however, I must admit that these guys are doing pretty much decent job by offering french fries, nuggets and popcorn chicken at a low price.

Please note that this is a limited review. I only bought a fountain thumps up from this place and if it was possible.... They got it wrong... The thumps smelled and tasted funny and I think their machine is not working and is unable to mix the powder... Be careful.... The service was very friendly which was a saving grace

Itz a long time passed away I went to city centre 2. But I remember if I am not wrong, corn & fries is beside the ATM counters at the backside, a small kiosk serves fresh n hot french fries which I really had, and I believe that it is good enough as per their charge...

For the past year I have always been having some snacks here at this small food-joint whenever I'm visiting CityCentre2. Since most of the items like Cheese corn nuggets, Aloo Tikki, Cheese Fingers, Chicken nuggets, Chicken sausages are taken out of refrigerator and fried (right in front of you) it takes roughly 5-7 minutes for the food to reach you. My favorites are Cheese corn nuggets, Aloo Tikki and Chicken sausages. You can always have soft drinks or tea along with this. The biggest con - You will not get any place to sit here and have your food at this joint, also I fill the quantity served is less considering the price. But overall - A good place to grab a quick bite!
