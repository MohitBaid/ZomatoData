This eatery springs a surprise with the options they offer in their menu. Fried chicken and burger from a roadside stall is a first for me and they are astonishingly good in taste! Rest are as usual: rolls, chowmein, friedrice, etc. Very economical on your budget I would say, especially those fried chicken and burgers. I am becoming a regular visitor here! 😆

I had ordered 35 plates of chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian. They packed old chicken which was so bad that, people couldn't eat. The smell was intolerable, forget eating it. The shop is also not clean, the hygiene very poor. Please don't eat or order if your health is important.

Very much unprofessional in delivering order. They are just making a bad record for Zomato. They always late in delivery and sometimes don't get surprise if you get a call from them at the last moment by saying that they can't deliver the order.

I hope Zomato will take action against this.

I don't know may be my colleague and I were one of the first customers. We only ordered chicken popcorn and they gave good popcorn and great quantity at a very good price. Then we shared with others, we started ordering regularly then suddenly they increased their price and lessened the quantity. We simply stopped ordering from them. The point is if you charge a premium I will simply go and buy from KFC. Why from you.

Sometimes class is too high priced and with friends you need a small budget and some street food to make a day count .
So I tried this place few days back and well works for me .A chocken lover never says no to Amir fast food .
Its like a mini kfc with awesomw street set up .
I loved it so go out and taste some fast food .Sometimes its more than just healt its the taste that counts .

Used to order regularly from this place as it's near me and food was affordable yet tasty.
 They have recently increased prices quite steeply, almost by 20-30%.
Their Chinese has become too greasy.
Most items aren't available all the time.
It's a road side place, hygiene isn't their priority.
Food quality has degraded.

Terrible. Pathetic. Disgusting.I dont have any other word to describe our horrendous experience at this road side food joint near GD island. We ordered Crispy fried chicken, french (so called) fries and crispy chicken burger. Well, an alur chop is less oily than their fried chicken. It also smelt of bad oil. Big failure!!! The french fries were equally disgusting and so was the burger. The mayo inside tasted like curd!!! Like seriously!!! The bread was also of very poor quality. And I literally dont know what sauce they use... it had the appearance of hot schezwan with the taste of honey mustard... YUCK!!! Lastly, every thing in and around the place was dirty and stingy. Even the menu card was sticky. We felt pukish after having the food. Never going back there again!!!!

This quaint little shop at the corner of gd island, salt lake has gained popularity over the years as 'the cheaper cousin of kfc'. 
Well to be precise, it does look like kfc but tastes nothing like it. But the price difference is a draw and the charm of sitting at roadside places and savour such dishes was quite interesting to this calcutta boy who grew up on streetfood. 
The outer skin and crust of their chicken is much thicker than other fried chicken available in the market. And the chicken pieces are however juicy. Personally i would prefer their popcorn chicken ( yesthat too sounds like a ripoff)

However the thing that caught my attention was the spicy chicken.. regular fried chicken dipped in an irresistible extremely hot sauce.
Ill definitely be going back for some more spicy chicken

The quality of the food has degraded somehow these days but I assure they have one of the best crispy chicken burgers.

I never felt the need to write a review or comment regarding something. But tonight I felt so. I ordered the chicken burger meal from here through Zomato at 6.13pm. After a lot of effort from the Zomato guys I got my order at 7.30 pm, for a burger I had to wait for 1 hour 17 mins. 
Then the meal had a beverage included. I didn't get it. I complained the owner and he said zomato will provide that. Lol. Then the most funny part. The food was horrible. No chicken in a chicken burger. 
I paid Rs.165 for this. I am ashamed I wasted my money on such frauds. Never ever order or eat here. Don't encourage this. It's a humble request.

Having read the popular reviews, I ordered the chicken burger meal ( chicken burger + french fries). First of all, delivery took more than an hour  that too after i registered a complaint with Zomato. 
Now coming to the food experience, right from the packaging to the food was more or less a disaster. The chicken burger was not up to the mark. The so called "french fries" weren't so french after-all....the potato slices were sticking to each other and smelled of cheap oil.

Their food is decent for the price. I remember how excited me and my friends were when we saw the amount of the french fries they gave for the mentioned price. Their chicken burger is worth a try. Their plus point is being pocket friendly and the negative points include poor seating arrangements and indifference towards customers. I've tried the home delivery option, that's a better idea if one wants to try Amir's.

Gariboon ka KFC should be the name of this outlet. Great mouth watering snacks in the most pocket friendly prices. The fried chickens are great, well balanced in terms of flavour and and should be adored by bengali taste buds. The chicken pop corn, burgers are equally good. And honestly, great sides if you have booze house party ;). A must visit for all, and you will decide for yourself regarding whether to make a next visit or not.

A small place right on the corner of GD island. We ordered french fries, popcorn chicken(spicy) and chicken noodle. The only thing i didn't like was, they took a loooong time to serve, but the food was overall good. Their so called "french fries" were just potatoes fried in a chickpea flour(besan) batter, but they were crispy and good. The popcorn chicken was really good( not as good as KFC's 😅, but quite comparable). The chicken noodles were not like the "Chinese chicken noodles" but they weren't bad either. The french fries are recommendable, do try their innovative version of "potato bhajis" just for 40 bucks!

After having food from the well-known and usual eating joints, our taste buds got monotonous and seemed to detect no taste. To refresh the food buds I felt a need to try something else, and hence opted to order from, “Amir Fast Food”.

Going through the menu of Zomato, it hardly took me five minutes to chalk out my items which totalled for 1000 bucks. I ordered for a couple of Chicken Family Meal, Chicken Popcorn of the spicy tinge, 3 Chicken Spicy Burger, one Chicken Cheese and a Veg Cheese Burger, ultimately following by 3 plates of French Fries. The estimated times was shown 45 minutes but the delivery was made after more than an hour. The meal though was heavy did not seem to burn the pocket.

The guy who delivered the items hardly seemed 18 years of age, was shy but extremely polite and too jolly for complaining about the restaurant’s fault. The food was delivered hot which was only positive thing about the order today. 

The food was packed very improperly without even segregating the veg items from the non-veg ones, whereas there were no marking for the items’ name. I was too startled to find that there were no tissues or ketchups provided along with the food which is such a disgrace.

Disappointed with the whole outcome of my adventure, I unpacked the items to curb my hunger. I started with the Veg Burger, which I found tasty, whereas, the Chicken Burger not up to the mark, but, still eatable enough. The Chicken Popcorn was sweet despite selecting the spicy one and while eating it, I felt that the chicken was not fresh. The Chicken Family Combo has two types of chicken in it – the crunchy chicken as well as the wings felt well enough, but, the spicy chicken was pathetic. On opening the French Fries, I have had a mini heart attack looking at the blunder I made adding this to the cart in multiples of three. The fries provided in the name of French Fries does not resemble it at all and simply looked like chips slicing along the length and masala added to it. The whole experience turned into a misadventure that no force can overcome.

A visit not recommended.

The very first experience is not a very pleasant one. Ordered rolls and French fries. The order was delivered with a delay of 20 mins from the scheduled time while the distance of my house from the eatery is barely 1 Km. Coming to the food, it was delivered Cold. The roll was still OK but the French fries were cold enough to throw off. This is not expected from the eatery which I have visited a number of times before. I think they have to fine tune their delivery process along with keeping the quality of food intact. Taste wise it was fine. But the delay and the cold part made it pretty bad.
Advice: Please speed up the delivery part ad take care that the quality remains intact as if just taken out of the oven. Please note, other eateries successfully do that stuff.

Visited once again last week. Had chicken popcorn and chicken skewered. Equally bad experience. Below average food quality and medium of cooking. Suffered from hyper acidity. No going back to this joint ever. Thumbs down team.

Amir's is a joint that has gained fast popularity. There is always a mini crowd outside this joint. They have limited chairs laid on the footpath. They do not score much on the hygiene but with such joints there really is not much of an option!
Try their fried chicken, popcorn chicken. Crisp menu with just the basic chicken dishes to score on. The fried chicken can be offered to guests visiting home! Good delivery option in Salt Lake.

Browsing through Zomato for nearby restaurants, came across this place. Went straight to the reviews and was quite surprised that almost everyone had good things to say about this roadside stall in Salt Lake,let alone compare it with KFC. Fried Chicken for me is synonymous with KFC and nothing ever has come close yet. :P
Anyway so while checking out the menu, I just happened to place the order purely by chance. Ordered noodles and chilli chicken. Wasn't disappointed with the noodles. However, the chilli chicken needs a lot of work. They delivered pretty quickly within 20 minutes. Prices are reasonable.

A takeout lunch of egg chicken fried rice and hot and delicious chili paneer made for a good meal to kickstart a busy afternoon on a bleak cloudy start of the week, ridding me of my Monday blues. Already a favored haunt for young students, couples, friends, this grub hub can also be a good choice for officegoers who can grab a quick bite before heading to work, for hungry pedestrians, people fond of street food, and of course the locals and residents of Salt Lake.

Ordered Egg chicken gravy chow & gravy honkong chicken. The main course was good but the side dish was not as per expectations. It was too spicy too. However overall I would say that it wasn't bad. Quantity was pretty satisfying.

Amir is a popular take away joint tucked away at a corner near GD island. I have picked up food few times from Amir and the experience was just fine. I always order their Spicy Chicken Popcorn which is in fact better than what is available at KFC. However their babycorn is not that good. I would suggest to stick to the basic chicken items. Pricing is very affordable

This is located on one corner of Saltlake GD Island One day we decided to try out their chicken popcorn. Order two plates of Chicken Popcorn. Each plate had 15 -16 pcs of good enough sized popcorn which costs us 180 Rs. It was really worth it. The pieces were really munchy and tasted awesome as they were mixed with some tangy masala. 
I will definitely try out their other dishes in future.

This tiny eatery is located next to HA block community hall , near GD island . The place has three tables outside with a few chairs , just right for a bunch of friends to hang around for a quick bite . The restaurant has everything from chowmein to burgers to chicken wings , but I'd suggest availing the take away option as they serve faster in that case . Otherwise , if you order in , try going for the fried stuff . I once ordered an egg roll that took 45 minutes to arrive , so beware ! They serve noodles pretty fast too . My favourite here are the chicken pops , which cost a hundred bucks and taste good . The French fries are good too , at a pocket friendly price ! The chicken and cheese burger is awesome ! The chicken boneless strips are great too ! The location and prices are the USP of this small fast food joint that is popular with the young crowd . The fried food here is amazing and great value for money !

Came across this joint by chance. They serve KFC and NYPFC type of Fried Chicken Items and other such items.
To be honest I found the items much better than KFC & NYPFC joints , chicken was much more tender , the fry coating was not hard to chew . Ambience is not that great and the seating area is out in the open with plastic chairs and tables.
We went for Family Meal and Boneless Chicken Strips.
Overall a good experience.

As a college student or school student when you are short on cash but still want to have good food with a sumptuous quantity, there is no better place than Amir's. This place has been a rescuer every time we had a party which was pretty often. The french fries, its not like any french fry I have had before, and the pop corn chicken and that yum spicy popcorn chicken is a must. If you are still hungry after that you can always go for the burger meal, and if you like a bit of spice in your life, change the normal chicken with the spicy one. Even now, this is our fall back place. If we can't think of any other place,we go to Amir's which is pretty often as well. You can also try the noodles, although that isn't close to being one of my favorites but as I said as a college student,short on cash, it is very fulfilling that also for a mere 30bucks. The prices may have changed slightly from the last time I had food there.

Best order in if you live within saltlake, else you can sit outside like so many other people do.

Snack’em up!

This is a typical road side food establishment in Kolkata, right near the GD Island. The seating arrangement is on the pavement which is a negative.

Our visit’s objective was an evening snack, so we had rolls. Egg Chicken rolls. They rolled it up really well, with the right mix of tomato and chilli sauces. The Chicken Kebabs were also well cooked. I look forward to more snacks here if in that area.

Service was just okay.

It's amazing how such a small takeaway joint can almost match the mighty KFC when it comes to items like Crispy Chicken, Boneless Chicken Strips or the burgers. These items here are simply delicious. But on the flip side the more common chinese gravy dishes here are not upto the mark at all. Atleast I didn't like the way the Chicken Manchurian tasted. 
So I would say this one's a place where you should go and buy some top quality snacks to munch upon. Let the gravy dishes be.

When i ordered frm Amir for the first tym the food was very good..fried chicken,french fries n pop corn chicken were lovely..but dnt know why nowadays when we order the food quality is detoriating day by day..one thing i dnt like amir's food is they use to much chaat masala ..also the spicy pop corn chicken they serve is too sour n hot..one has to repeatedly inform them prior order to decrease the chaat masala n chilly n the food accordingly..the french fries they make is good but sometimes they use rotten potatoes too which makes the fries worse frequently..otherwise its ok for evening snacks..

Lets correct myself by calling it a restaurant, its basically a takeaway joint wid grumbling counter persons and tables on footpath. The restaurant offers quality chicken burgers, frenchfries to die for.

Have taken delivery at multiple times from this restaurant and never been disappointed. Pukka value for money...

Amir is mainly a roadside takeaway counter for fast foods. It is located at GD island, Sector 3, Salt Lake, It is nearby my current office location, so I go there 2-3 times a week normally..

They have a wide rand of items starting from KFC type of items like Burger, Chicken Fry, Finger chips etc, then Chinese items like Fried rice, Chili chicken, Manchurian etc. Also they server Steamed & Fried Momo, all types of rolls.

Food quality is awesome. Serving time is bare minimum though they prepare every item freshly after taking the order. Also they provide home delivery facility. 

Cost of food items are very reasonable. And if you compare the price of KFC type of items, it is almost 50% comparing to that of KFC, while the food quality is almost the same.

The only downside of Amir is that if you want to have food there, the only option is to use their 2-3 roadside tables which are not at all up to the mark.

A small joint just beside GD island. Quite unhygienic though with flies all around but the food makes up to that.Heard a lot from friends about this and thus decided to give it a try.
We had a delivery of 4pc fried chicken,one spicy popcorn and 2 french fries.The total bill was Rs. 300.So the place is really cheap.
Coming to the food,the french fries are really tasty,more like alu pakoras,but really crispy(and oily) and spicy.The spicy popcorn has a coating of hot sauce over them which reduces the crunch but it was tasty.I did not find the fried chicken much appealing as the taste was bland,but the pieces were quite big.
Hope to try the burgers soon.

A roadside outlet located near GD Island serving KFC styled crunchy burgers and fresh fries has been a talking topic among many residents in Salt Lake. However, I was not too appeased by their food nor by their service.

Coming to the location first, this is is situated on the lines of Arambagh, Shiraz, VIP Sweets at the end of the line nearby the round island. It is more of a shabby appearance like Benfish. Do not expect much of hygiene or clean atmosphere. 

I had ordered for Chicken Burger, Chicken and Cheese Burger, French Fries and a Strawberry Shake. The burgers were nothing great but was just edible. The portions of Chicken was pretty less and more like a thin strip. The burgers had salad in them which were in no way fresh. The Cheese burger had no contribution of cheese within it. Overall, I felt a Chicken Roll in Shiraz would have made me more satisfying than the soggy and tasteless burger.

The Strawberry shake had overpowering Strawberry and was more sour than it was on the sweeter side. The only decent thing about the entire meal were the Fries. Crunch and Crispy, they seemed to have been fried with Red Chilies to give them the crunch appearance. 

Honestly, I had had better burgers within the same price range. Will not suggest this to anyone.

Its a street side shop which attempts a desi twist to American fast food with quite unexpected results. The food quality is ok and tastes are actually quite acceptable. They have a pair of garden tables with chair sets kept on the kerb for those who want to catch a quick bite. I've seen techies come over from sector V on their bikes to hang out. You'll always find a couple of people hanging out here at all times. It may not be top notch, but it surely has quite some fan following of its own.

There's no place to sit but you can always order if you stay nearby. One of the fast food centers that serves both Indian and American preparations like burgers, fried chicken etc and it never disappoints. A must try I'd say.

A quick cheap fast food home delivery option in salt lake area. Me and my friends had a house party and we ordered chicken pop corn, French fries and chicken chowmein from Amir. The popcorn is close to KFC popcorn.. But much much cheaper.. The French fries was decent... I think it got a bit over fried. Chow mein was average. But 3 plates of popcorn chicken, 2 plates of French fries and 3 packets of chowmein costs only 432..

Tucked away on the corner of GD island, Salt Lake. This joint I first saw back in summer last year. I remember when walking past it and smelling some amazing sweet schezuan flavours. That got me interested. I went there alone to try the fried chicken, to test the waters out first. I was pleasantly surprised with the food. The pieces of chicken were huge. The spicy chicken is amazing. Lip-smakingly good if i don't say so myself. Very moderately priced, this will definitely give KFC a run for its money. The french fries are batter coated and fried till crisp, and 30 bucks. My only complain against this store is......where was joints like this when I was growing up. Sigh.

Pure, unadulterated joy all the way. Went to Amir's, hearing insane praises about it from my friends. And boy! They were so right. It is a small road side shop with a sitting capacity of 15 at max. We were a group of 6 and we ordered the following:1) 2 plates of spicy french fries.2) 2 Plates of spicy chicken popcorn.3) 1 Spicy family meal.4) A Chicken burger.5)1 Plate normal chicken popcorn.6)Veg hot and sour soup.7) Two cold drinks.It was a delight. The french fries are out of this word. They give a plateful, enough for two people, and the fries are crisp. juicy and the accompanying sauce is really nice. Never have I thought that I would be having cravings for French Fries, but once you taste them, it is bound to happen. The spicy chicken popcorn is a universal favourite. It will beat the ones that we get in KFC by a large margin. It's delicious and bang on bucks as they give loads of it.  The chicken burger is exactly like that of KFC, except it is cheaper and more fulfilling. Trust me. If served in a KFC box, even the most ardent KFC fan will have a tough time deciding if it's a KFC original.The soup was ok, a bit too spicy for my friend's tastes apparently. Since I did not taste it, I can't vouch for it, but the quantity was satisfactory. The Spicy meal contained a burger, french fries and two delicious jumbo pieces of chicken all at a whopping amount of Rs 160. The quality and taste was consistent throughout.

All in all:Ambience: One shouldn't get too greedy.Food: 5/5Service time: 10 minutesPricing: Out of this world.

The place surely can give KFC a stiff competition with its crispy chicken, chicken popcorn n chicken burger !
The other dishes like the rolls, noodles and manchurian are nothing extra ordinare. Located at the corner of the road, the sitting arrangement is on the footpath. The ambience is road side with the honking of car horns the only music. Good for take away though.

This one definitely gives KFC a run for its money!

Walk by to see a dozen chairs laid out around a couple of tables, all on the pavement, and the little Amir Fast Food Centre in front of it. Don't go by the look of it, for its menu includes almost all the ones you can have in KFC.
The veg burger is tasty with a home-made feel (having cucumber and onion in it). Popcorn chicken was great. Better with some ketchup. Although I felt a little more spice would have been nice, the huge size of each piece had blown me away!
The crispy chicken followed suit - BIG portions and superb taste.
Friend's Fries - as they call it - were bigger and different from the french fries we are accustomed to. Such was the quantity they gave, I could not finish it alone!
Maybe some day it will redefine fried chicken, and people won't need to compare it with the the big names in town.
Kudos to the owners!

Wow! Such a surprise. A small shop. The local street side roll shop it seemed but when I saw the menu, with its KFC like menu, I thought let's give it a try without expecting much. But I struck luck. Bingo! The burger was great... Pricing is awesome, its so cheap its unbelievable. Will try their Indian soon.... Must visit. Only downside no AC and u have to sit under a tree! That could be an upside too. Right?

This is one of those places which deserves a ton of reviews for one simple reason - FLAVORFUL AND AFFORDABLE FOOD!

Lets put aside those unnecessarily snobby aspirations and sit on on one of the centre's simple, hardy plastic chairs while we wait, only for a short while, before our plates of delicious, flavor-packed chicken arrive, with just the right tinge of spice. Pocket-friendly and oh so delicious, one would easily miss this little place if not for a few dedicated foodies who know their (dead) bird and will go to great lengths to acquire a tasty leg or thigh to chew on. Rishi and Rahul are responsible for this discovery, and shall be duly thanked with plates of delicious chicken popcorn, huge pieces of fried chicken, and a few bottles of ice cold thums up to wash it all down.

Momos are also available here at a decent price, and for those who want cheap but spicy Chinese food, look no further.

Also, a significant part of the menu is akin to a direct challenge to global giant KFC... sorry big boys, but Amir's chicken is way better in terms of taste, quantity, and quality than your overpriced and inconsistent offerings will ever be. Indeed the "meal" combos which are so frequently spotted at KFC/McDonalds, have been replicated here at literally half the price, minus those annoying taxes as well. So yes, the burgers, super delicious fries (they are specially coated, not plain), and fizzy drink are all available, and yes vegetarian foodies, there are some meals for you as well. 

Pricewise, a meal for two could cost as little as INR 200 to 500 depending on your appetite. My meal for one consisted of 2 giant bits of chicken and came to INR 100! 

I do not see a pitfall of sitting outdoors and stuffing my face with some truly delicious bird meat; never mind the pretentious AC's and decadent but pointless (since you can't eat it) decor which often adorns a number of restaurants which seem to offer nothing beyond "pretty interiors" and little or nothing when it comes to their culinary offerings. 

HELL YEAH Amir's Chicken! I am on Team AFC for good.

You get your fried chicken and your chicken popcorn, and it is pretty damn good. Offers outstanding value for what you get and is definitely worth whatever you pay for it. Nice and crispy on the outside, and succulent inside, and happiness inducing overall.
