Yesterday we had ordered a few items for dinner at home from this small joint. We had ordered Chicken Pakora and Crispy Baby Corn for starters; for main course we had ordered Egg Chicken Hakka Noodles, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Boneless Chilly Chicken and Hot Garlic Fish. The quantity of all the items was quite decent, all the items were very reasonably priced and tasted very good. Will reorder from here very soon in future.

The food is good here with not so high price. But you won't like the location. You have to wait a bit. I hope they will look into it. Otherwise it's good.

Awesome food a must visit. Must have the roll they are yammy. Chicken combo is also pretty tasty. Paratha was the best of all. You can sit and have your food.

Yes,  you heard it right ! Melting point can easily bring smile to your hard heating hunger in very pocket friendly prices. Finding this place is easy, as it is located bang on Greek Church Row, Kalighat, a few metres from Greek Orthdox Church. Fastfood joints can flatter to deceive, as some of the fabled places have turned out to be utterly disappointing !  But this was not the case here ! A very recently opened venture from Mr. Aveek Chatterjee. A small joint mainly looking forward to provide take away service though few chairs are available to have your food here only ! So we went in here not knowing what to expect. Service is quick. Food is readied within minutes.

Located very conveniently in the street between the Orthodox Greek Church and the Kalighat Tram Depot, The Melting Point is fresh, inviting and very pocket-freindly. Located steps away from the famed WoodStock 1969, this eatery can grow convincingly if they work well on their ambience and quality. The combos on offer are amazing, fulfilling and very affordable.
