Located on top of the Roxy Cinema at Chowringhee, the USP of this place has always been the live music while the patrons sip into alcohol. The prices are pretty decent here and doesn't hurt you much. The service is a bit of an issue but the waiters are pretty much helpful. Never liked the food here much. More of a 'Chalta-Hai' option!

Te be specific, it's feel like you are in mid of 80's. I liked the ambience, food is medium quality , price is not too high, the staff are friendly and helpful . But toilet is not good .

On the rocks bar, placed on the top of Roxy Cinema of Chowrangee, Kolkata. It has three seperate places to sit and enjoy live songs (most of them are old of 1960-1980s) as band performs. Drinks are not cheap any more, however the servicemen are very helpful. The ambience is of old Kolkata - nothing fancy. I would rather avoid it for too loud music.

on  the  rocks  bar  is  on top  of  the  erstwhile roxy  cinema  on  chowringee lane  .  the  bar  has  live  music to  entertain  it's  customers  .  drinks  are cheap but could  be cheaper , considering the ambience  ,  which  is  zilch to  be  precise  . we had  two  60  ml pegs of  havana  club  rum  &  two  650  ml  tuborg  beers   ,  &  the  bill came  at  a  neat  560  rs  which was  cheap  considering  havana  club  rum  cost  us  rs  100  /  60  ml  peg  &  tuborg  @ rs  140  /  650 ml  bottle  .  overall my verdict  is  a  so so  place  which  is  only  worth  going  if  the  other  bars  nearby  are  full  .  and  oh  yes  they  did  not  give  us  the  food  menu  ....  which left  us  so  agitated  that  we left  without  ordering any  food .  2.5 from my side  only because of cheap drinks
