It is so bad. Honestly a big no-no. Bought chicken biriyani for my family and the entire pack was stale. It smelled stale and we couldn't have it. On this reason itself food license could get cancelled but well nothing would happen in this case. But if you're reading this do not buy their biriyani! Feel so bad that I wasted my money..
