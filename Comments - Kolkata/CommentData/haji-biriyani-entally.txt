রাস্তার পাশ দিয়ে যেতে যেতে খিদে পেলে অতীব সস্তায় খাবার দোকান । কিন্তু বসার জায়গা নেই । চিকেন বিরিয়ানি খেয়েছিলাম । মাঝারি মান । পরিবেশন দ্রুত ।

Haji Biriyani is a roadside eatery located at Entally, mainly serves Biriyani & Chaap.

Shabby ambience.

Quick service.

Tried Chicken Biriyani , which was sufficient quantity wise , and was pretty nice , well cooked along with tender meat pieces but was oily which is not good health wise.

Pocket pinch is low.

its a road side biryani shop with no sitting arrangement located near entally market. Take away is the only option. Tried mutton biryani. Taste was good , cooked well, mutton was soft not chewy but too much oily.  Not good for health. Very cheap.

Loved the famous biryani they had to offer me. I loved it because it was not that spicy but it had real good taste. Nice place for non-Veg lovers. Place is not that good as its locality but the food is really good.

Perhaps the ideal outlet to have Biryani at a economical price, maintaining a decent quality and quantity. Although, the price quotient has increased in the recent days, the popularity still remains untouched. A perfect destination, when hunger pans, the only downside here is the oilyness of the Biryani and Chaap. If you aren't health conscious, and can do without some extra drops of oil this is the place to be at.

An usual cheap Biriyani destination when you want to have Biriyani at a low cost. Tried mutton Biriyani from here which turned out to taste good if I consider the price. Though I liked the taste but had very little only as it was full of oil and didn't quite give a full hygienic feeling which can be ignored if you want to.

Haji brand is serving good biryani all over the town through their many stores. The biryani is satisfactory at Rs.70 and it do taste good.
If you are Biryani lover and have biryani 1-2 time a week then this is for you. The Chicken biryani at Rs.70 and Mutton biryani at Rs.90 is one of the best thing you can find below 100 bucks.
The biryani rice is of good quality and they also serves a good quantity with a big Chicken piece (bigger then the one any Arsalan provides).
The only issue is the presence of too much oil.
Still Haji serves wonderful biryani.
They also makes Chicken chap and Mutton chap at Rs.40 and Rs.60 respectively.
Take the combination of Alu Biryani(the one without Chicken piece) and Chicken Chap it makes a good pair.

Well if you are really hungry and no other alternative , then go for it. The Chicken Biryani and Chicken Chap were okayish but had too much oil in it.
