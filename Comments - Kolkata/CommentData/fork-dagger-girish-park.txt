Went to this place on a birthday treat. The ambience which I found here was wonderful. It is a calm place with soothing music playing. 
We ordered some lassania and noodles with was quite sumptuous.
The best part of all is that the place is financially very reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area.

If you are visiting this place for North Indian food then it would be the best you can get in this area. The ambience of this place is also good and staffs are well mannered. But if you are ordering food at home then be careful about the menu. Once I ordered Chinese platter they provided stale Chinese bhel and the other food items in the platter was also tasteless. It was a waste of money. Only this is the reason I m rating it 3.5 otherwise it would have given it 4.5.

I have visited this place second time ( first experience was good) along with 5 other family members.
we have ordered cheese barrel, zucchini fritters, paneer angare, veg jhalfarezi, corn surprise and breads.we have also ordered a Mexican pizza.

Now comes on serving part : They don't have bread plate option as they don't have space on their table ( as mentioned by  a waiter). They served with pickle,green chillies, lemon and onions (which looks like dipped in vinegar but it's not). Fritters was decent  along with tomato sauce. paneer angare was without salt and quality of paneer was not good ( after complaining, they have come with a portion of fresh  paneer vegetable). Corn surprise was not at all surprised us. It was not good in taste. Veg jhalfarezi was good in taste. Mexican pizza ( INR 250) was sweet and made on readymade pizza base which you can get on any road side pizza counter, extremely over priced.
serving- poor,food quality- poor
Overall experience poor, not worth it !! 
No worth to money,over priced food

First thing to mention, this is a total tax free restaurant. We paid exactly the amount written in menu which is a big thumbs up!!
This restaurant located near Girish Park metro has got a very nice and soothing interior. It's quite spacious and comfortable for hang outs. The silent ambience is also great for planning a date.


The staffs are really welcoming and has a very decent behaviour. Their behavior is another plus point of this restaurant. It's kind of a homely atmosphere.

Now let's come to the foods. I should firstly say that I visited this restaurant during Durga Puja, so food quality might be a bit better in normal days.
My order was 1. Nachos and Cheese, 2. Schezwan fried rice, 3. Manchurian baby corn
Nachos were great with there cheesy and spicy dips. I tried nachos in restaurant for the first time and totally fell in love with it.
The rice was spicy and tasty and the baby corn dish had a nice Manchurian flavour. Although, the quality could have been better. The baby corn wasn't fresh I guess. That might be due to Puja times. Also they gave nice and standard quantity.
One drawback is that I didn't get the menu shown up here. The menu they provide has less dishes. There should be more options of dishes as it is totally veg.

Overall it's a very cost friendly restaurant. They give great service without any kind of service tax. Food quality would probably be better in normal days. Otherwise it's a great wow for me.

Recently visited the restaurant during durga puja (mahanavami). We were 4 people all excited to try this place. But it turned out exactly the opposite of what we had expected. The decor was posh with vibrant colour contrasts. That's the only thing which I liked.

The food: less quantity served. A typical north indian dinner consisting of starters followed by kulcha, 2 vegetarian dishes and rice was not sufficient to satisfy starving customers as we were.
 The service was pathetic, we sat there for 1 and a half hour while we completed are meal .
The price of the dishes were unacceptable as to what they served.  I mean who serves a sabzi for 250rs when it finishes within four spoonfuls.
After this I am in no mood to talk about the taste. Maybe this was due to puja rush.
Visit if you want to.

Located at Girish Park Crossing, this relatively new family diner is too good for vegans . The ambience is nice and interiors are attractive . 
Most of the dishes we had were perfect . The Crispy Babycorn was one of the best I've had . The Dahi Ke Kebabs were soft and succulent - a treat for a vegan . 
Coming to the main course , The Paneer Lababdar and Dal Makhani were brilliant . The breads were soft . Sweets were average . 

Service is prompt . Well trained staff . 
The place is slightly overpriced but the Thalis here are extremely affordable and filling . 

Another visit on the cards :)

The servic is good - we were 8 of us.. Loud music was being played inside ! We took our seats in the Formal wala place, ie, straight to the 3D background..
We had :
 - white pasta (not upto the mark)
 - noodles (it was ok)
 - schezwan noodles (good)
 - red pasta (good)
 - crostini (cheeeesssssyyyy)
 
The quantity served by them is good. I found it a bit expensive !

I had ordered Dal makhani, Kadhai Paneer, Masala Kulcha and Garlic Naan.
I got it home delivered.
The taste was overall pleasing but excessive use of oil in both dal and subzi. Both breads were soft as compared to other restaurants.
There were big chunks of tomatoes and capsicum in Kadhai paneer which could have been small.

This is the first time I'm reviewing something on zomato and it really took some amazing level of mediocrity and disgust for that to happen.

I ordered spaghetti aglio olio from this place - and to my surprise I was delivered a box of oil and cheese with some very undercooked but massively cheese laden pasta. I guess the first thought when I saw it was - this is what a month in the toilet and another month in the hospital looks like. I am appalled that people can serve a box of cholesterol in the name of pasta and even make it sound right. 

By the way - the photo attached is the outcome of me filtering and funnelling the pasta out so what you see is probably half of the oil and cheese and what you feel is probably 1% of my disgust. 

Hope this helps - I enjoyed my first review unlike the food which is unfortunately lying in the bottom of my trash can  :)

This is a relatively new vegetarian restaurant right at the girish park crossing. I have a been to this place a fair number of times now and i have had a pleasant enough experience each time.
They offer Asian and North Indian cuisine and both are worth trying. The exotic vegetables and the schezwan noodles are a good combination to go for. The schezwan noodles pack a huge ( and I mean Huge ) punch so if you aren't used to the spice I suggest you stay away.
From the Indian menu, I suggest you skip the paneer and try the hara bhara kabab. That kabab isn't like any other I have ever tried. The biryani is also a good option.
They serve nice mocktails as well. I love 'blind love'.
Fork & Dagger offers great food and service and definitely one that is better than others at a similar price point. So I suggest you give it a try!

Tried their chinese thali which is sufficient in quantity for two adults. Quality is good and their packing is very good as well. A liitle costly place but the thali costs Rs.203 only which is quite reasonable. Order was delivered before time. Cant give 5 points since I dont like veg.üòúüòú

Well, I visited this place on 09.02.17 to had dinner.. This place is too cool & the service is very fast.. It was my friend's b'day.. so I asked them whether cutting cake is allowed or not.. The staff said yes.. And the surprising part was that then the manager came and he said that they will provide the cake stand for us.. And we have to cut the cake.. over their selfie 3D wall.. That was soooo amazed.. They took the cake from us and then take us towards that 3D wall.. Another surprise awaiting was that there were several balloons has been kept on the floor.. That was a super cool surprise for my friend.. Above my expectation level.. Then they came with the cake and through the cutting session they played b'day songs and nice songs for the occasion.. The entire staff made my friend's b'day much memorable than I expected.. The staff's behaviour was too good.. They're well- trained.. Sooooo a big thankiew for making it happen.. Coming back to the food.. Though I'm a non-veg and my friend is a pure veg.. For his b'day I decided to visit this place as it's near from my home , As I don't like to visit veg restaurant but very often visit to veg restaurants.. The food was really good.. Soooo yummm.. Suprised with the quantities of the food , they served much more..The food we ordered was..
Moctail-
Virgin Mojito : Refreshing..
Soup-
Manchow : It was good..
Starter-
Crispy babycorn : Tooooooo yummm..
Noodles-
Schzewan hakka chow : Delicious
Rice-
Schzewan fried rice : Mouth watering , tooo spicy and well cooked..
Main course-
Veg Manchurian gravy : tastes good
Broccoli, mushroom & babycorn in ginger coriander sauce : It's tastes delicious... try only if you love to eat the dishes of coriander..
Dessert-
Banana apple toffee : One of the best dessert.. tooo yum served with vanilla ice cream..
Sooo I love the place , the food , everything.. & I'll love to visit this place again & again.. It's a super cool place to dine out with your friends , families & your loved ones.. please do visit..

Visited this place on 14.02.2017 for a quick lunch. Location is very nice and we got a nice seat by the window overseeing the city scape...As someone pointed out correctly in a review ...the price list is full of spelling errors ...which didn't encourage us to try any exotic or unconventional dish. We thought it would be a good idea to order good old yellow dal and garlic naan/masala kulcha.  Little did I know that even this would turn out to be a risky misadventure! The dal that was served was not of good consistency or texture ...definitely not good enough to qualify as dal fry and to top it all,it was over seasoned with salt. Initially we tried masking the excess salt by squeezing lemon juice but it was so salty that the lime juice could not balance the taste ...we decided to order for something else ...and called for the waiter. The restaurant plays such loud crass music that the waiters are not able to hear the guests...and nd when they do, they attend you with a strange smug attitude. I causally mentioned about the excessive salt in the food and the waiter opted to change the dish ...however, we had already ordered a chana masala as we were hungry and didn't want to wait too long lest the breads get cold. The waiter then chose to take a spoonful of the daal on a plate for the chef to taste ...and much to our chagrin and surprise, he returned few minutes later, only to inform that the chef has declared that the food is perfectly cooked with adequate seasoning! !! I was horrified by the approach and behaviour of the staff and the total lack of courtesy and sensitivity!  
Fork and Dagger ...ample tool for murder ...though I guess they don't even need a dagger ...they can kill you with their over salty food! Disaster in short !!

Date of Visit ‚Äì 25/12/2016

Location ‚Äì Conviniently located on the 1st floor at 219, Chitranjan Avenue near Girish Park metro station. Parking is an issue here. Need to park car between ganesh talkies and girish park.

Ambiance ‚Äì The interiors are good with seating arrangements comprising of both sofas and chairs. Also there was a 3D selfie zone for selfie lovers.

Service ‚Äì I felt that the staff who served us was well trained. I always  faced an issue at many restaurant that people who is taking the order doesn‚Äôt know the items well of the menu. The person who took our order knew each items of the menu well, also was good at making mocktails himself. Highly impressed.

Food & Description ‚ÄìAfter watching movie at city centre saltlake was looking for a pure vegetarian restaurant as my parents prefers strictly pure vegetarian restaurant. Suddenly this new place came to my mind. But it was late for lunch. So called up this place, they were ready to take the booking at 3.30pm. We went there, the restaurant was half full. We well greeted and shown our table. Food we ordered with description  :

Cream of Mushroom Soup ‚Äì The soup was creamy, fresh and served hot. I liked the small pieces of mushroom coming in my mouth. 

Minestrone Soup ‚Äì The soup was tasty with vegetables and herbs. 

Mushroom Babycorn in Bangkok Sauce ‚Äì This starter was something different. It had a greenish look and a little tangy flavour. But I liked the different flavour as was tired of trying same style of crispy chilli babycorn everywhere.

Sizzling Tandoori Platter ‚Äì This platter consisted of paneer tikka, dahi ke kabaab, aloo kabaab & Harabhara Kabaab. Paneer in paneer tikka was little hard.Well marinated though. Dahi ke kabaab was just about average. Aloo kabaab was excellent, soft and tasty. Harabhara kabaab too was very tasty.

Chinese Platter ‚Äì Reasonably priced at Rs180/- per plate consists of Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Veg Fried Rice,  Veg Manchurian, Chilli Paneer & Chinese Salad (Bhel). Crispy chilli babycorn was good. In Chilli garlic noodles, chilli flavour dominated the garlic flavour. Veg fried rice was average. Dnt like veg Manchurian & chilli paneer. Chinese salad was excellent. 

Kadhai Paneer ‚Äì It was good with loads of vegetables.

Dal Makhani ‚Äì It was very good. Nice balance of creaminess and flavour of dal.

Breads ‚Äì Masala kulcha & Garlic Nan both were excellent.

Butter Basil Rice with Veg Paparika ‚Äì One of the best dish tasted here. Excellent flavours of the gravy of veg paparika. Butter basil rice tasted amazing. Just veg paparika had loads of paneer which i dnt liked it. 

Overall the experience was good. Pure vegetarian place serving multi cuisine dishes is a ultimate desire for pure vegetarian people in Kolkata. Although I was satisfied with the service but was not fully satisfied with the taste.Its a new outlet and I am sure taste will improve with time.

So this one had to pass my scanner because after ages I could see a restaurant budding in my locality and it gives me a weird pleasure to write about this one.
Centrally located area and a remarkably spacious one. Interiors are decent, nothing flashy, nothing extra. Just minimal. Multi cuisine as it says, On asking the person who attended us he specified indian cuisine as their speciality. Since we weren't in the mood to hog in some indian food so we ordered some continental dishes. The menu had too many typo errors so understanding the names was a slight pain.
We tried funghi assortiti, which says corn spinach marinated mushrooms in a bed of spinach and coated with cheese, tasted good, but too much spinach can't be eaten as starters. 
Nachos with cheese were a real disappointment, as we were served cheese flavoured readymade tortilla chips with grated cheese. Too shabby. Though the salsa and cheese dip were good. 
Risotto pomodoro, cooked in tomato cheese and wine, was a relief after the nasty nachos. 
We called for two mocktails, fruit punch and virgin blue lagoon. Needs improvement.
We ended our meal with a bangkok custard, which was fried cigars of banana rolled in wonton sheets, served with custard filled with roasted peanuts and cashews, topped with black sesame seeds, and cholote sauce, which I did not like at all, maybe because I do not like that roasted peanut flavour in my custard. Also the plating of the dessert was not appropriate. Experimentation went wrong for us.
All in all not much of a disappointment. A lot of scope to improve. Extra score for encouragement and since the place was almost full, I assume their indian food is worth trying.

Considering the occasion, pretty good. After seeing queues outside other places, we decided to come here. There was rush which was understandable.

The food was good. Great ambience. They may be preoccupied with customers, but what I liked is that the seating is very spacious so you wouldn't feel the chaos and noise from other tables (unlike other restaurants on days like this.) 
All in all a good experience. Much better than what it could be at other places.

1st Jan 2017 visited with my family and it was a great place with good food quality but the service was very slow...The thing which disappointed me a lot was that inspite of telling the waiter 10 times to give me Paneer Chhatapata without onion in parcel they gave me Onion paneer chatapata.at the time of ordering for parcel they told that it can be prepared without onion and they will make it and will give it to me..But they didn't so and the parcel didn't contained pickles too
I tried calling on the given no but nobody picked up the phone.As a result my family member didn't eat that sabji and my money got wasted

Okay! So I rated this place a strong 4.
Located in the girish park area near the metro for us localities this is an upgrade for which we can proudly say it's a decent restaurant to be compared with the likes of the one's in park street. Now as you can see in the photo section this place has a nice ambience. The interior is good plus there is a 3d photo section. Overall by the looks of it I would say yes this restaurant has what it takes to be in par with those fancy ones.
But then what about food?
Food is important.
Now I haven't tasted too many dishes but I could say that they are again in par with those fancy ones. Food is good. But shakes and drinks, well I am not so sure about that. We did not like them. But then again i as a localite would visit this place more rather than fill the pockets of those in the park street area.
P.s. they are not charging tax on food as of now so that's also a plus but the bill is not going to be light as the pricing is also at par with the semi-elite group.
So check out the menu given here to see if it fits your budget.

It's good but the quantity they serve is not worth the price. Though the food is tasty, but quantity served is too less. Also the waiters there are not quite trained in how to serve food properly.

Hope I could give a review in a negative number.
Poorest of all,dont judge by the outlook...we 3 stones in the dal makhani.Quantity served is also very less. 
The best part is that when I called for the manager he was missing. For sure I am not visiting this place again after today's instance.

Amazing food and super amazing ambience. Located at the heart of kolkata. It has become an attraction for all the Pure-Veg foodies. Space management has been done nicely, kids can be seen running around. I ordered Veg Paprika, Risotto with Spinach and Chimi Chancua. The food quality is superior than most of the nearby restaurants. Next time will visit with my parents. Thanks.

Confucius says: "If the food is really good, unleash the superlatives". I found even superlatives to be good considering the location in which it is situated and price that I paid for purchasing the coupon. I purchased a Chinese lunch coupon from Little Deals. The food is amazing especially manchow soup and crispy babycorn. The 3D picture zone just adds a beauty to this restaurant. From Food to the service, everything was great. Must visit place. :)

Situated right beside girish park metro, this is a new veg restaurant. The restaurant is on the first floor, relatively deserted. The ambience is quite nice, the staff is really courteous though a little inexperienced. Coming to the food, we had Indian cuisine for dinner, every dish we ordered was amazing in taste. There's a 3D selfie zone as well to click pics. Overall a nice place, would definitely recommend to all.

Situated in a prominent position near Girish park metro, this place deserves more people than I saw on a Tuesday night. With suave interiors and exceptionally well-mannered staff, I was impressed much more than I had anticipated. 

We ordered fresh lime soda, stuffed aloo (delicious and has gravy too unlike the dry traditional dish), Dahi ke kebab (a little too sour in my opinion) and Lazeez-e-tandoor (a platter than includes all the kebabs on the menu) and all of these were just wonderful delicacies. The time to serve was a little high but considering that they cook everything from scratch and they have a great 3D selfie zone and crossword puzzles for you to spend time with, it's not really a con. I've been informed that they have separate chefs for different cuisines so looking forward to experiencing the Chinese and Italian stuff too.

The areas of improvement in my opinion:
1. Include non-veg and liquor(though the staff told me that the owner is strictly against this, but I still hope)
2. Some soft music could do wonders to the ambience.

Undoubtedly looking forward to several more visits.

As name suggest it's a family restaurant with a dedicated 3D photo Zone for young selfie lovers. Ambience of this very nice with cool music plays in background. Talking about food I ordered paneer corn capsicum masala which I like it very much and quite different from regular paneer variety. I would recommend to try risotto if you want to try different dish. Photo can give you idea abt serving quantity.

Well this was my 2nd Veg restaurant in Girish Park area .No doubt Restaurant is good ,service is also nice ,ambience also and food was not upto the mark for which I was looking for ..I am not saying that the food was bad but it was not upto my expectation .
I ordered Jalapeno Poppins which was made of paneer stuffing and some spices stuffed in Capsicum which was again rolled with a thick crunchy crust ...
NB : Crust was crunchy and stuffing was also tasty only Capsicum was bit raw .
Overall its a good restaurant in Girish Park for Veggie lovers ...
At last but not the least ,I found the fork but where was the Dagger ??üòú
Thank u

Easy to locate being just above Kotak bank at Girish park crossing. Amazing ambience, classy yet fun decor, very spacious with good music. The place isn't noisy at all as tables are placed cleverly and with sufficient spacing. Staff is very humble and courteous too. 
Coming to the food, the continental cuisine is their speciality and I agree after trying a few dishes. Lots of mocktails and a few but nice desserts. They have a diverse menu for every palate. A must try. Thumbs up!

Great Food and a soothing ambience. A must visit place with friends or family. The 1st dish that I ordered 'Pepprica' topped the delicacies of my Menu. The 3D photo booth section is what attracts the most. The customer service provided was also really good even during the rush hours of Durga Puja. Loved the experience.

Happy GPian!

Newly opened veg restaurant in girish park. They're not properly opened yet. Still need many updates to done. Ambience was good. Hospitality was also nice. D√©cor was really impressive. It was beautifully designed and decorated. Unique lightning, beautiful tablets & chairs which were perfectly arranged. Different sections for couples/singles and groups. They also have charging point near each table. Presentation was beautiful. Service was very slow. Staff was friendly and helpful. AC is not properly working and they  have few more technical and manufacturing defects too on which they're working. Price was totally reasonable in comparison which taste, quality and quantity. Regular menu is not set yet it will come soon. Currently they have puja special menu in which they have mocktails, starters and main course. We tried fruit punch in mocktail which is basically a mix fruit juice with vanilla ice cream. It was refreshing and tastes good but i suggest them to make it less sweeter then it tastes perfect. We also wanted to try some soda based drink but due to shortage on ice we couldn't do it. In food we tried Ricotto in spinach which was heavenly delicious. Perfectly made Arborio Rice Ricotto with boiled spinach and cheese, cream & butter tastes so cheesy, creamy and very tasty. Food and beverages were fantastic. Need improvement in service and technical things but they surely do it because they just opened.
A must try place but after few days. Let them settled.
Recommended to all.

I visited this place on sunday evening for dinner with my family on dashmi.We had a very bad experience . The service was pathetic d grade..it was chaotic all the time so much of noise as if you are in machhi market. The worst part was they didnt have even a proper electric line for this place , had to sit there without ac. Food was average. There were more family members of the restaurant roaming around then proper waiter.
