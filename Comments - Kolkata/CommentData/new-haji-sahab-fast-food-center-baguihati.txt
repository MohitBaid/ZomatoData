Chicken roll they served was quite good. This place scrores zero for ambience. But the food here is kinda OK. And the price is quite low so you can visit this place if you are unable to find a good restaurant or if you're broke.

Once it was good.. But its getting worse day by day.. I guess changing the chef backfired..

Quality of rolls are deteriorating day by day. once it was the best fast food centre in the area but not now. Tutur kitchen has far better service than this.
