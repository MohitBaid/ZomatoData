I am a regular customer of theirs, and their tadka and rumali rotis are out of this world.
Only thing is that their owner gets worked up sometimes and thus talks rudely.
Accepts cash and paytm.

Are you hungry? is it 1 am in the morning? Just bring yourself to this joint. They are still open and serving. Just try the Rumali Roti, Chicken Bharta , Paneer Butter Masala, or even a simple Egg Tarka. One thing guaranteed no mater how late it is you will find it here. Even in the afternoon they serve good Bengali Daily lunch(mach-bhat). For your daily need this is A+

The Paneer butter Masala is great here so us the Dal tadka. This is actually one of the very few places in Calcutta where I've gotten authentic North Indian Dal. And the food here is quite inexpensive. 

But do not plan to sit and eat here, hidden away on the at the corner of Garia main road and boral Road - a few cranky tables and chairs makes up all the ambience there is !!!

The best thing I had was the Roomali Roti with the kaali dal.....otherwise the food quality was pretty average...The dining area is not so clean....thus take away is a better option for this QSR

The only Punjabi dhaba in Garia, but there are other resturants in Garia who serves better Punjabi dishes. Maybe the only place to find good parathas.

Located well on main road near sitala mandir Garia. Looks perfectly like street food stall except few plastic chairs and tables. Food quality is below par. They use poor quality ingredients. Taste is below average. The people who visit there is not becoz of its taste instead of its location and price. Still I think price is on higher side compared to quality of food. Biryanis taste like any roadside stalls. Yes u can always find chapatis being made hot there and most office returners favorite. Overall this place is for only emergency situation when u failed to find any decent place to eat. Never suggested for planned outing or dinner. This place is horrible in ambience behavior and too much traffic noise to eat. 
But in emergency and at nights its a lifesaver.
