A small joint near hazra and a pocket friendly one to stop by...Ideal to meet your minor cravings. The place though a bit clumsy has a cute decorum and u can choose between a small range of books available there to relax urself. The choco avalanche is a must there..and the food is really good..
Service can be improved a bit.

In love with the place... best place to hangout with friends...
Tried chicken pasta in cheese sauce and tomato cheese, chicken grilled sandwich and chocolate avalanche.. 
cheese sauce was cool but not tomato cheese..!!
Sandwich was also good ..!! It was served with potato chips too !!
Chocolate avalanche was GREAT.. its was super chocolaty and the quantity was too much for a single person..!!

Amazing food. 
I had cheese paratha which can't be described by words but one has to eat to actually experience this delicacy. 
The best part was chocolate avalanche. 
Overall it was a good experience.

A nice place to hang out with your mates.. I had heard a lot about it and now i know why this is famous for after-college hangouts.. Delicious food, good service and the nice ambience makes it worthwhile.. I had ordered chocolate avalanche, cheese parantha and chicken grilled with olives and capsicum pizza.. Chocolate avalanche made my day even better.. I highly recommend this place..

A cute place to hang out with friends. The food is affordable and its best place to hang out with friends. I tried the pasta ,pizza , chocolate shake , greenapple soda, chocolate avalanche amd pancakes from here. The pizza is thin crust and cheesy but the chicken on the pizza tasted kind of odd, the pancakes were really nice and chocolaty, the green apple soda tasted some what like appyfizz and the pasta and chocolate shake were okayish. The chocolate avalanche is tasty and really filling.

Finally made to this small cafe near hazra more was on my wishlist for quite a few time this morning . The ambience was good with hanging lamps from a glass rooftop and some new year and christmas decor. The place was not at all crowded but people came in now and then. Good for youngsters and students for good food and a place to sit back and chat . 

Coming to the food , we ordered : Hand-beaten coffee , Grilled chicken olive capsicum pizza and Chocolate avalanche. The coffee was good and frothy. The pizza was a disaster. The Chocolate avalanche was mind blowing! A bowl full of vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownie , chocolate chips , chocolate sticks and chocolate sauce dripping on top, did live upto what I heard of. A must try for those who haven't yet.
There were only two staff catering to the visitors needs but food was served within a short time . 
P.s: they offer books to read if you want while sipping your coffee!

The best part was Chocolate avalanche undoubtedly. Rest was pretty decent considering the ambiance, pocket crunch and for a quick crunch it is really a nice place to hang out with your pals. We also had mushroom crepe with mustard sauce, even that was yummy. However the chicken pasta was totally a disappoint.

Bon Appetit is a nostalgia for me! When I was doing my honours in Asutosh, it was a frequent place for us to visit. A couple of days ago I visited it once again.
The place is much good and they're cooperative. Foods are also good. It's pocket-friendly as well.  Food is tasty.

The food was delicious so this is a plus point which might ignore the facility for AC.

Chocolate Avalanche- Boss, naam hi kaafi hai !

Went there around 3-4 years back for the first time with my first gf. Absolutely LOVED it.

Went back again sometime back. This time on another date. And MAN, I fell in love again! ;) Come on, they make the avalanche so heavenly, it just blows you. It gives you goosebumps. The warm brownies inside and the rich flow of chocolate, ice cream and everything- I am dropping it right here. I am going back again! tomorrow? or day after tomorrow?

Bon appetit is young by nature mainly predominated by young college going girls and boys . it has got a chirpy atmosphere . food is quite nice and quantity they serve is appreciable according to the rates . I especially like their thin crust pizza, chocolate avalanche ( its an emotion ! ) ,pancakes and chocolate shake. However I would want the owner to make the place a bit more airy / air conditoned (if possible )since it becomes claustrophobic at times . otherwise a nice place for hangouts in the entire hazra area .

A cute little beautifully decorated cafe. We went there a day before christmas so it was bit overcrowded. We ordered coffee , tea, midnight cookie shake, nachos with salsa and cheese dip(chicken), chicken pasta, spaghetti meatballs, chocolate avalanche. The dessert was delish. Never thought something so good could be made out of nachos. The shake is a must-try. Everything tasted good and underrated. Overall a wonderful experience.

Who came up with the design of this place?...  Like who thought "lets make a restaurant where the table moves! " Not only that,  none of the tables have any tissue paper or water bottles.  Cramped up place with uncomfortable seating arrangements.  All in all not a fun experience... Rather not an experience at all,  never recommending it to anyone,  not even an enemy.

Chocolate avalanche, the one and only best item of this place, has lost its integrity. To begin with, the place is untidy, it is not as clean as before. Secondly , the container in which they provide chocolate avalanche has also been changed. Now they provide in a cheap small container. The quantity of avalanche is reduced. Less choco chips and choco sticks are provided with the item. Also the chocolate soup is in limited amount. Finally, a tissue paper is not even provided with the food items. Very sorry state of affairs at this place now.

I went with a friend who had been pestering us about the well known "Chocolate Avalanche". First off, they've done a commendable job of utilizing the small space in which this Cafe is housed. Still, our gang of 7 had to wait quite a bit on a weekday afternoon. But the wait was worth it. I ordered myself spaghetti with meatballs and the aforementioned avalanche. The spaghetti was a satisfying snack. But the real deal was the dessert. That was the biggest overdose of chocolate I've ever had in my life. Definitely recommended. Overall a good place for small groups, specially students and youngsters.

Sky roof book-cafe, quite different and trendy with swings as tables and seating. Posters of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe hang by the bookshelves from which you can borrow books and read by while your food arrives. Cheap but Non AC so will be problematic in summer. The Salsa on the Nachos was not good. Tastes a lot like store brought ones with ketchup. The Brownie shake was ok. The most famous Chocolate Avalanche was good too sweet to eat a full bowl alone. The cheesecake was perfect combo of sweet and salt. Pocket friendly.

This place is one of the best place for students. Such a cosy ambience, good music, better service, and BEST FOOOOOODDDD!!!! üíü

We ordered -
Chicken Pasta, With Red Sauce. And, their famous "Chocolate Avalanche". And, I LOVED it. The pasta was sweet-spicy-salty-tangy. And was mouth watering. And, the Avalanche will give you real happiness. It is made of, brownie, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and choco chips. It tastes damn good. We had it two times. üíü

The cafe is pocket friendly, and the decoration is amazing as well. They should extend their place as, the place is small and so many people come there to have great time. It is remains full, everyday-everytime. 

A thumbs up, from my side. And the staffs, are quite friendly, and their service is pretty fast. Would suggest everyone out there, who want great food, in small pocket pinch.

This is a beautiful cafe tucked into a corner in Hazra. Extremely student friendly which basically stands for pocket friendly. I would recommend Choco Avalanche. Because I loved it. The pasta wasn't all that great but it wasn't bad either. The decor is extremely aesthetic. However, they need to use mosquito repellent and they need to get better songs on board or not play music at all. The vibe of the place gets murdered by the songs that keep playing.

This is one of the most pocket friendly hangouts, serving delicious food, with a really cute and quirky decor. The tables are actually giant flat swings and the stools are shaped like dices. The place however is a bit cramped and could really do with an AC. 

Coming to the service it's quite slow. We ordered the following items:
1)Chicken pasta in Cheese sauce- really creamy and delicious with ample shredded chicken 
2)Spaghetti with meatballs- The meatballs were soft and juicy and the highlight of the dish. However the marinara sauce was a tad too overpowering for my taste
3)Chicken Cheese pancake- This came slathered in cheese sauce with a side of chips. Really heavy and filling! 
4)Blueberry Cheesecake-This for me was the best part of the meal. It was light, fresh, and the blueberry compote provided the perfect acidity. 
5)Choco Avalanche - This is supposed to be the star attraction of this joint. It's basically a brownie with ice cream, doused in chocolate sauce & choco chips, with a chocolate cigar. It was delicious for sure, but I personally preferred the cheesecake. 

Despite ordering such a hoard of items, the bill came up to only Rs 650.

One of the best budget friendly places in Hazra area. Taste is very average. Portions are just enough for one person. Not a very family friendly place but then you don't visit such places for ambience.  You just can't sit and eat there in peace, too much of shouting around you. Chairs are pretty small. We had to sit on ludo dice stool and the table was too small for the food items to accommodate. Food quality below average. Ordered mixed sauce pasta, choco avalanche and cheese paratha (served with pickle and curd). Cheese paratha was fine and the choco avalanche is excellent and better than their salt lake branch. Pasta was nothing impressive. Prices are dirt cheap. It's really a pocket friendly cafe. The person who was taking the orders was full of attitude. Most of the items were not available which we wanted to order. It's a very loud crowd out here. Ambience 0/5. Food 2.5/5. 
They charge 5 percent gst only. Parking is available for both 2/4 wheelers. It's good for a one time visit. Thanks!

Have visited this place thrice so far. The place is tiny and tends to get pretty crowded sometimes. But it's still great for hanging out with friends....and it's pocket friendlier (with good food). So far I've tried the following-

Blueberry Ice Tea- It was good but a tad bit too sweet for me. I remember not liking any of the ice tea the first time I visited because it was just so sweet without much of the flavour.

Cold Coffee- This was good. 

Midnight Cookie Shake- This is the best beverage I had at this place so far. 

Cheese Paratha- Had it each time I visited. The paratha oozes out cheese and is yummy. Its served with yogurt and mixed pickle with slices of onion marinated in the same pickle juice/masala.

White Sauce Pasta- This is really good too.

Mixed Sauce Pasta- It's nice but I prefer the white one simply because the white sauce is so good.

Nachos with Cheese Dip and Salsa- It was ok. The salsa was the generic store bought stuff. Same with the nachos. It was nothing special.

Chocolate Avalanche- This is yummy for sure. But you do get equally yummy, if not better, brownie and ice cream at quite a few places here.

So I visited this place today with my friend. Location wise it's quite uncomfortable but reachable. The place is small and cozy. It's just perfect. The sitting arrangements is like fairy tale. üíñ The swing made table is quite appreciable and the lights added a feather to the cap. üíõ Perfect Winter special dating place.
Now the hospitality. That they totally suck it. There was only 1 person who was making food and serving it. We had to help ourselves there. üò∂ But never mind.
Now the Food. We ordered 1.Midnight Shake, 2. Chicken Sausage jalapeno and 3. Chocolate Avalanche.
1. Midnight Shake: They suggested and yeah it is highly recommended. It's like Oreo Shake but with cookies and cream.
2. Chicken Sausage jalapeno Pizza: They burnt it. Not a place for Pizzas tbh.
3. Chocolate Avalanche: Now this is my favourite. And is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It's basically vanilla ice-cream with brownie, choco chips and chocolate roll served with chocolate syrup. üíõ And it just melted üíô
Keep it up. üíõ
P.S. One of the best places for photography.

Bon apetit is quite a renowned place amongst the students & those who like a funky chilled out place to have gossip with some light food. So based on the rave reviews from fellow zomato reviewers & few acquaintances i decided to visit this place with my friend but what turned out ultimately was a sheer disappointment.

This place is located in the lane opposite of sujata bhavan near hazra more. Smaller in size the place is vibrant with its lightning & the hustle bustle of the crowd. It can get a bit difficult to find a place specially in the evening & one might have to wait it out to get their seats. They have self order service but they will serve your food at your table once prepared. One negative point i would like to point out is their cleanliness. We had a cake box & water bottles lying beneath our table with scattered food scraps lying around the sitting areas which was certainly a big turn off.

Anyways coming to the food, we tried the following:-

1. Green apple iced tea - This was taken by my friend so cannot comment upon this.

2. Ultimate hot chocolate - Contrary to its name, it was an ultimate fail in the name of hot chocolate. A glass of hot chocolate was served with chipped cream & chocolate sprinkles on top. The whipped cream was good but the hot chocolate was too runny due to overdose of water into the chocolate mix. Highly disappointed with this.

3. Cheese stuffed omlette - Bread toast were served along with cheese stuffed omlette with chips. The omlette according to us had too much cheese comparatively which was not gooey in nature. Perhaps usage of cheese slices led to the downfall of the dish. Average dish to be honest.

4. Penne pasta in white sauce with chicken - The penne pasta was nicely prepared with ample shredded chicken. The pasta had enough cheese which any cheese lover would love but the seasoning was lacking which led to an imbalance taste of the dish.

5. Chocolate avalanche - This is considered to be a signature of this place. The quantity of the dish was certainly good. Basically this is a resemblance of brownie with ice cream with extra additions of chocolate chips,chocolate wafer stick & chocolate cream as its base with brownie being at room temperature. The dessert tasted good but it lacked the wow factor as hyped by many. The brownie could be better though.

So all in all all the dishes tasted average at best. Although it will continue to be a hit amongst the college goers due to its low prices but food quality could so so better in my opinion. They charge separate GST to their bill with the per head cost hitting us about Rs 244 per head.

With its quaint ambience, chequered floor, see-through roofing and an odd mixture of quirky and antique interior decoration, it has conquered the fancy of the entire college-goer community. The fresh vibe and laid back atmosphere are it's main attraction. 
I ordered a pasta in cheese sauce and cold coffee with cream. The pasta was cooked beautifully. The cheese sauce was so yummy. The thick and creamy dish is more than enough for one person. This caf√© serves a great food in affordable prices. The cold coffee was rightly chilled and sweetened. Overall the food was excellent. The service was good too. 
The main drawbacks of this caf√© are - small and congested seating arrangement and no washroom facility.

Had been to this place with a friend of mine to try their chocolate avalanche. It was seriously good. The warm brownie and the cold ice cream with chocolate sauce and choco chips is a heavenly combination one could ask for. Loved it totally. Being a dessert lover, this was sheer happiness for me. Will come again.

Certainly a great place to hangout. This place serves delicious food and can serve different food items. The place abounds in snacks and fast food. One of the genuine reason for a high footfall. The food quality is high but time taken for the serving is a little high and this annoys a little.
I ordered a thin crust pizza which was provided without cheese. This was annoying and we noticed at the end when the last crust was left. However, the management took the fault and provided a fresh pizza with cheese. The fault was there but they accepted which shows the customers mean to them.

Been there just yesterday for my sister's birthday,and soon I realised that I had made a big mistake. They are out of number of veggies as common as bell pepper, which is apparently used in major food items they have on menu, which means they are serving compensated food.  1st of all they don't have the manners to serve a guest with water when they arrive and they didn't serve it or the napkins ever even after I told them twice. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs, egg hawaiian salad,  spicy tuna sandwich, cafe latte & mango shake.  1st comes the spaghetti with meatballs, where we had to decide whether spaghetti was given at all or is it the leftover, yes thats the amount they provide as given in the pic attached. It was more oily than any mughlai dish put together where I can see oil getting purely seperated and collecting at one side of the plate. Meatballs were just a lump of gramflour. Totally disappointed.  The salad was spicy, no bell pepper ofcourse, no lettuce, no sweet corn.. All I got was few capsicum, little bit of egg bits, little gherkin, lots of onion and big chunks of chilli ladden with very spicy masala and lot of whipped cream or i dnt know what that was..  Totally disappointed again and who gives big chunks of chilli in salad??  Well as for the sandwich I was told there is no bell pepper so I had to switch from tuna to grilled chicken sandwich as they suggested as I dare not experiment anything else after what I had to chomp already as I was super hungry. But then the sandwich was full of mashed egg yolk with mustard and mayonnaise and I could not find chicken anywhere. I won't complain on this cuz although it was not what I ordered but tasted nice. The cafe latte was good. So was mango shake. Most annoying thing that happened is while the waiter was serving my salad and sandwich they took away my platter of spaghetti with meatballs without even asking once, while it had a meatball and spaghetti in it..  We were gulping our drinks so could not speak at the moment cuz the waiter rushed out with it. Later I complained to which they didn't even care to say a sorry. Well the ambience was nice.  And to the management of BON APPETITE : If you are reading this, let me tell you.. I don't need a complimentary meal or anything to make me feel good , just cook right and employee professional waiters. You people can do wonderful if you really work on the few drawbacks you have. Would love to visit again in may be 6mnths cuz of the experience I had. Hope to get a better service.

Pocket friendly place to hangout with friends for the innovative decor. Maybe a small place but definitely cozy. Ordered mixed pasta with extra corn garlic maggi, corn crepe, cheese paratha. All of them were lip smacking, specially the paratha.
 Green apple soda and mango shake were good.
 But the dessert chocolate avlanche is a signature dish. Brownie with rich chocolate sauce n waffles is just  yum yum. 
 N all this within Rs. 900. Worth enough.

The best joint that i have visited in recent times.. tucked away in a narrow bylane near hazra more, this place is a paradise for food lovers. Tried the chicken sausage and jalapenos thin crust pizza, cheese paratha, iced tea, blueberry cheesecake and chocolate avalanche. All of which were fantastic. The chocolate avalanche however was the show stealer. This is an ideal place that one can visit without worrying about burning a hole in the pocket. A must visit.

A non-AC joint(hectic in summer) serving some delicious pasta and I must say even if you don't have a sweet tooth, Choco Avalanche is a worthy try.. interior is quite attractive.. specially the swing tables and the dice shaped stools..
Nothing to mention about the service as you are not even served with a glass of water.. It's like you go to the counter, place your order, pay the bill and they will be kind enough to serve the dishes you ordered that's it..
overall a pocket friendly cafe with some delicious food items to offer and a place to hangout.. thumbs up to that.üëç

I had been to Bon appetit on a Sunday evening. The place is quite small with many people cramped in it. The seating arrangement is quite bad. The chairs and tables are probably meant for children. Coming to the food. We had ordered Hawaiian Chicken salad, spicy chicken salad, a drink with mint and chocolate avalanche. The Hawaiian salad was extremely salty and had an extra flavour of cinnamon which we did not like. The spicy salad was a little better yet nothing great. Only chocolate was very good. On the whole, it was quite a disappointment for us.

It is located quite close to Jatin Das Park. A cozy place with cute decor. Though it can't accommodate a lot many customers at a time since the place is really small. It's a very pocket friendly cafe. Definitely a great place to hangout with your friends or partner.
I have been there a couple of times and my experience is very nice.

I ordered their signatures Choco Avalanche and Blueberry Cheese Cake, both were damn delicious. The first one is highly recommended for every chocolate lovers.
I also had the Spaghetti with Meat Balls which was a turn off due to it's extremely tangy flavour. Will love to go back again and again to this place.

A quaint little cafe serving delicious & pocket friendly food with some unusual interiors. It bags a special place under student hangouts and inspite of being non-AC cafe they have a great footfall each day. I'd give the credits to the food. From sandwiches to pizzas to pastas, they have it all. Don't miss out on desserts if you have a sweet tooth. They're one the greatest attraction here, especially the Chocolate Avalanche.

Since we went for a small evening snack, we ordered very little this time. But each dish extremely delicious.
The Blueberry Cheesecake is something you shouldn't miss at all. The flavours are really gonna do magic in your mouth. Along with that we ordered for Chocolate Pancake and Nutella Pancakes. The chocolate pancake was loaded with chocolate sauce, and if you're a big chocolate fan this is definitely your dish. The nutella pancake was absolutely delish, served with some whipped cream topped with cinnamon.
Had tried few of their savoury items in my previous visits,and their pasta deserves a special mention. Each and every food on the menu is cooked to perfection.

The best part is the food is really inexpensive and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and fills your stomach with a tasty meal.

It's apt for a hang outs for a small group of 4-5 as the store isn't very spacious and has limited seating. Only the service is really slow apart from that no complaints at all.

For every student this is a must visit and enjoy some perfectly pocket friendly food & some great time with your buddies!

Visited this place again and this time ordered Cheese paratha,lime soda,again chocolate avalanche,midnight shake,Three Pepper and Grilled Chicken With Olive and Capsicum.
As usual every dish ordered tasted amazing.

A budget friendly Cafe with good food... The decor is certainly very cozy and charming... Those swings replacing the chairs and tables were pretty unique... We ordered zesty chicken on toast, mixed pasta and nachos... All of the items were tasty to its core... Although the raw mango soda was not upto the mark, the chocolate shake was delicious... The chocolate avalanche should get a special compliment... It was one of the best among the lot... Nothing to say about the service because there was not much to serve... You have to order in the counter itself, pay the bill and wait at your table for the delicacies... One problem that I felt was the inadequacy of the water... Generally we are served with water as soon as we enter a restaurant but this one had a different setup where you have to fetch the water in a plastic glass from the adjoining aquaguard kind of a thing... That was pretty problematic as we had to go in turns to bring our water... Otherwise it was a great experience out there.

One of the most happening cafe of the town right now. From the ambience to the food to the price, this place absolutely rocks in all fronts. The choco avalanche of Bon Appetit has become a cult on its won. And particularly the hanging chairs around the tables that helps u to swing while sipping at our favourite mocktail or while grabbing a bite of your chicken filled sandwich will definitely make you visit this place again and again. The pastas are also equally mouth watering. Self service. Payment is made before the food arrives and parking place is available. Ideal for college goers and youngsters as well as for people like us who are really old, but still young at heart..!!! ;)

BA is a great way to see how simplicity can truly upset opulence when it comes to sharing a meal with friends.

There's no air-conditioning to be had here, or waiters coming over to swankily laid tables to ask you if you'd prefer normal water or polar ice melted glacial water from the frozen plains of Greenland. Here, you walk in, place your order, take a seat amidst a ruddy, cosy little room and wait. The cafe feels like the establishments of old- you simply sit there and have a good time talking to your friends while the food arrives. Oh, and some of the seats are swings.

When the food does arrive, it's delicious and rich and tastes like a million bucks. Get the pizza, at 110, and watch the incredible amounts of cheese stretch and stretch into strands as you try to pull a slice away from the plate. Or get some juicy corn to while the time away before the main course, along with a blueberry iced tea that actually has tiny pieces of the fruit in it.

But of course Bon Appetit is famed for it's desserts, and my word is it ever deserved. The Happy Jars, at 70 bucks each, are a variety of desserts in little take away plastic containers. The sinful chocolate mousse is to die for; the red velvet and cream cheese is somehow even better.

So in conclusion, go ahead and give this a shot. It's earned its name and popularity.

Favorite- spaghetti and meatballs. Oreo shake.
The paratha ,each type is out of the world. They are served with pickle and curd. And you couldn't have enough.
The pizza is also great.
And the chocolate pancake is a must have
Though their most famous is chocolate avalanche. I love everything.

Went there for some goodies while was in Hazra. It was the month of July. So the absence of AC was annoying. However, the small cafe is decorated in an innovative way.
We took our seats and were waiting for staff to come bt even after 15-20 mins none came up. Then I called one of them but only to be informed that the order should be placed on counter.
We ordered a Grilled Chicken Capsicum Pizza and a Chocolate Avalanche. Both were tasty. The Avalanche was delectable. Just great. The pizza had ample amount of chicken. The crust was thin.

Conclusion: Definitely a student friendly cafe with diverse dishes. One should give it a try. Rs 450/- for two can be enough.

The quality of foods were awesome. Parathas were superb. It's a must have. The sandwiches nd pizzas we're too good. Rightly baked. Soft nd cheesy.. Although we were almost full before we could indulge our sweet tooth. But I must say having the choco avalanche at the end was the best way to end a superb feast.

It is definitely the most affordable food joint in Kolkata! Hence its one of student faves. Their Chocolate Avalanche is a MUST MUST try. Its seriously heaven on earth. Also, for the cheese lovers, make sure you try their cheese paratha which is again 'food-gasmic'. This place is always filled and sometimes even has waiting queues. It would be really amazing if they install just one AC...coz their food is really amazing..and relishing the food becomes a bit difficult when the weather is very hot. All in all, a must try place, especially for students!

It is a delayed review. It has been some time I have visited this place. But it still reminds me of its cool ambience and quality food. 

This place is located at near JD Park metro station. You might find some difficulty locating this retro. So it is better you switch on your GPS ;)
So coming to the ambience of the restro. It is cozy, have a few swings. Yes, you heard it right swings. You can actually sit one of these swings and enjoy your food. Apart from these, they have normal chairs setting with a twist of swings as tables. Yes, you can eat your food on swings. Cool, is not it? It is a perfect hangout place. 

The place really impressed me with its prices. It is pocket friendly. Despite its reasonable prices, we will welcomed with good quality food. 
We have tried their white sauce chicken and for dessert, we we had chocolate avalanche. The pasta was cheesy enough to make you happy. Glueyness was just perfect, not runny or solidify. And talking about quantity, it was more than enough for two people. After having that big bowl of pasta, we were full. Then chocolate makes its entry. It was an eye pleasing dish - hot brownie, swirling ice cream, crunchy chocolate chips and crispy chocolate wafer. A party was going on in my mouth. And the quantity was good enough to give sugar rush. 

In my opinion, people who want to eat good food at reasonable price, should visit this place. It will give you a heart warming experience

We had expected the place to be of quite high a standard after seeing the rating and review. Sadly it didn't live to one bit of our expectation. I would have possibly given a 0 star. The ambience is totally disgusting. It's like a rented old playschool for kids. No AC nothing. The food is even worse. The pasta consists more of sauce than the pasta shells. Eating pasta was like finding sea shells in the sea. The pizza was acceptable but still not quite good as other retailers. The food portions are also quite small. If pricing is the case then I suggest they increase the prices and serve better quality food.My overall experience was the worst I have ever had. We had to go out to eat somewhere else again after eating here.

We ordered Chicken Pasta(I forgot the exact name),Grilled Chicken Olive Capsicum and Chocolate Avalanche‚ô°.

AMBIANCE: They set the shop in the ground floor of a building.No AC.But beautifully decorated with artificial grapes,hanging tables,dice shaped tools etc.

SERVICE: Very slow!

FOOD
‚òÜChocolate Avalanche -Filled with lots of choco chips,chocolate syrup,wafers,based on brownie and vanilla ice cream.It's simply melt your heart.Highly recommended.‚ô°

‚òÜGrilled Chicken Olive Capsicum -Thin crust,but taste good.

‚òÜChicken pasta-Simply yummy.One dish is perfect for two.

BON APPETIT !!‚ô°

I frequent this place very much but everytime they are out of the thing I order 1stüòë. Wouldn't call it a coincidence. The food is not that good either but it's cheap and that's one of the main reasons for my frequenting this place. The ambience is unique and lively. Service definitely needs to improve.

Well decorated interiors with black and white checkbox flooring! 
Good food and good service!
Small cafe at a prime location. But would have been better if you put a sign ,opposite sujata sadan.

Food tasted here:
Chocolate Avalanche: brownie with choco chips and scoops of vanilla ice cream. Good enough for 2 people. But the serving bowl was not good enough!

Blueberry Cheesecake: Try this out guys! Soft Cheesecake with blueberry sauce.

I am addicted to this place. I have breakfast a d evening snack cravings from this place every day and the fact that it is so near my house makes it even harder to resist.
Let me put it bluntly, they know their food. One would not expect such a high quality and diverse menu from this tiny and modest cafe but they do surprise you pleasantly.
My last visit here was on Navami morning with my partner, as we both had had a late night and needed a 'pick-me-up' for breakfast.
I ordered the Earl Grey tea and he ordered caf√© mocha. We then shared a corn on toast and chicken coleslaw sandwich.
The beverages were extremely refreshing. The tea was of high quality and the coffee was made strong but sweet.
The corn on toast was delicious. It was ooey, gooey, cheesy goodness.
The sandwich was also freshly made and tasted good.
I picked up a mocha muffin for home and I highly recommend this item from their menu to every foodie own the world. It was moist with an abundance of slivered almonds and the heady aroma of coffee.

I've been to this outlet of Bon Apetit twice. It's a very cramped up place with hardly any room. Service is dissatisfactory, and the food is average at best. The items are overpriced. Add to it that they don't serve water. The absence of an air conditioner only makes matters worse.¬†Frankly, the salt lake outlet is much better than this.

We ordered a cheese paratha(as good as always),
Chicken meat balls with spaghetti had too much sauce . The chicken salami pizza is not one should try.It isn't bad but this is not a place for pizzas.
Th strawberry sundae (with white chocolate chips) was mouth watering.

It is a small eatery located in a lane opposite to Sujata Sadan. I have been here a couple of times and i like the sweet informal ambience it has. Cool for a casual meet ups. Since it has no air conditioner, crowd can make it a little stuffy.
For food I had:
Chicken pasta with tomato and cheese sauce. We added extra corn to it and it tasted good.
Spaghetti with meat balls is too tangy so I don't enjoy it much. 
Chicken olive pizza is good.
Also, their sandwiches are decent but mostly I look for their sweet items.

Small place but filling, reasonable and good food.

You can't go in with a huge group of people as it is a quaint but quirkily done cafe. Small groups would work fine.

Coming to the food - the food is good. Absolutely good and "paisa vasool". The dishes apart from the pizza are all ENOUGH to fill one hungry being completely. Or even two in fact.

What we ordered :

Chicken Pasta with tomato cheese mixed sauce
Grilled chicken olive capsicum thin crust pizza
BBQ mushroom crepe with mustard creme sauce
Chicken, corn crepe with tangy tomato sauce, blueberry cheesecake, spaghetti, chocolate pancakes and nutella and cinnamon pancakes.

All the above dishes were super generously slathered in cheese. Just the way it should be.

No complaint about any of the dishes. Food is lovely. In budget. Just service is slow. Would love it if the food came faster.

This is one of the ultimate college student's hangout zone.

It is a not-so-fancy restaurant but it is surely a gem in terms of food and taste. It has a small space where you can sit and chill out during end of the month (when we all have empty pockets :) ). We had ordered chicken club sandwich, spaghetti pasta, spicy chicken salad, Nachos with Dip and blueberry cheese cake. Taste and quantity wise all the items were Yummilicious and finger licking. Cheese cake were too tasty. Even though the place was quite small but still it was not clean and tables were also had flies roaming around. The only disappointing part was cleanliness, else food were NICE. #BonApetit Pals.. <3

Bon Appetite is a very nice place with good food that also in affordable price. The setup of the cafe is also very good...Chocolate Avalanche that i had there was very tasty...it was vanilla icecream topped with loads of chocolate chips and chocolate sause. The quantity was pretty satisfying and filling as well...one more dish i had there was this nachos with cheese dip(chicken) well i was not quite satisfied with this because it tasted more like a paprichat...there was basically no dip but the cheese was spread over those nachos and out of 5 i would give it a 2. But otherwise Bon Appetite is a nice place to hangout with friends and folks that also at such an affordable price

Coming to the food, we had two 8" pizzasüçï - one is tangy chicken meatball and the other chicken seekh onion pizza, now both f them were soo soft to even hold have a proper grip, had to roll them just like dosas to eat. Not sure if this is how pizzas usually are made but definitely not a fan of those soft types. Then went to have Tiramisu üç® and Chocolate avalanche, both f them tasted very goodüòãüòã,i will go to this place again for having these not for pizzas!

One negative point is the place is too small even if you get a place to seat to chairs or stools are too small to be comfortable. Before GST the tax was included but now the are applying the tax on the total bill.

The joint may be small but big dhamakas are waiting for you inside.
We had their chicken spaghetti with meat ball and chocolate avalanche . The spaghetti dish was good, with some hot & spicy sauce. The desert part, chocolate avalanche was just mouth watering, I think I will visit this place again for this dish

Now about the joint, it is clean, some of the seats and tables are hanging from roof, the interior was good, we went in day so can't say about lighting, but observed some fancy lighting. Service was good. Again they offer some books, which you can enjoy while waiting for food ( you may have to wait for the food a bit). They have a nice variety of food and beverages.

Starting with the ambience, we are getting a totally different environment just like swinging chairs and uncommon ceiling decorations. We had 'Chicken cheese pasta', 'Chocolate Avalanche' and 'Spaghetti with chicken meatballs'. The main part kicked in when the Chocolate Avalanche came by, it was so adorable that it took time for me to jump in. I am ensuring every chocolate lover to try this for once to fell in love again with the chocolates. Apart from that the chicken pasta dipped in melted hot cheese will burst in your mouth. The chicken meatballs were so delicious. In few words, A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE.

I have lost count of how many times we've been here. The variety of food and taste.
I love the Chocolate Avalanche and the Red velvet jar.
The blueberry cheesecake tasted really bad though.
We've tried the Mushroom egg parcel crepe. It was creamy n yummy. The tangy chicken meatball pizza wasn't such a delight.
Other items that we've tried include Rose soda, Mint Chocochip exotic shake, Chocolate explosion, Cheese parantha, Pita pockets, spaghetti with meatballs.
I loved the Nutella and Cinnamon cream pancake.
(Might be missing some items)
The major downside of the cafe is the lack of AC. If it weren't for that I would visit it every time possible. Service is fine. Ambience quaint.

There is no air-conditioning, and the place is super cramped and also noisy.
But food is mind-blowing and rather cheap.
So are the drinks.
The service is good too though a bit slow. Also, you need to place the order at the counter and pay before your food is served.
I highly recommend:
#Cheese Paratha
#Any pasta and pizza
#Cold coffee with ice cream
# Chicket pockets (forgot the exact name)

2.grilled chicken sandwich- had 2 big pieces of sandwich stuffed with chicken kasundi and oregano,mayo mayb..it had chicken in every bite..but the sandwich was tooo spicy coz of its too much kasundi..it was served with plate full of potato chips..
3.handmade coffee - full of cream and yummy latte coffee..
Ambience-
As it is an open cafe it had few fans..flies all over the area..but the cafe was well decorated the tables were in the form of swing and the tools in the form of dice..the flooring was completely made in chess pattern..
They added 12% gst with the bill and it came out to be pocket friendly enough..lil slow service but worth visiting ‚úåÔ∏è

This is a small cafe inside a bylane of Hazra, very near to Jatin Das Park metro station. I was skeptical about this place because it's so small, but the food and the ambience was prettt good. 

I went with a friend of mine and we ordered two Cafe Mocha. The chocolaty blend of coffee was very enchanting. 

After that we ordered the famous Chocolate Avalanche, and yes it's worth every penny! A pretty chocolate brownie with lots of chocolate chips in a vanilla ice cream along with chocolate sauce. It is mouth watering simply! 

I loved this place and would love to go there again. The ambience and decorations are also nice, despite being a cozy small place.

The ambience is very nice. Minimalistic decor and pretty pocket friendly food.  Surely coming here again! It is a very calm and cozy place. Though the place is small and I do not think the place can accommodate more than 35(approx) people yet the service, food and ambience is great according to my taste. Although it is not an air conditioned caf√© yet it is very airy and comfortable.

Although the interiors seems drab and mismatch to any form of interior classification per se, the food more than makes up for the gaffe. Have been there many times. The must haves being 'Chocolate Avalanche', 'Corn Jalape√±os Sandwich ' and various paranthas (different variety on a different day). Service and waiting time are the areas to be looked in to. Easy for the pocket eatery is located at the Heart of the City - Hazra. :)

This place has an eccentric decor which is really eye-catching, especially the ceiling decor and the swinging tables. 
The two shakes, midnight cookie and black forest shake that we ordered were really good. A must try if you come here for some cool treat. However , the apple pie wasn't really great. Did not like it to be honest , leading to which my rating is 3.0. 
The other drawback that I felt was that it's not air-conditioned and not exactly much aerated either.
Not a great place to hit and chill on sulky summer days.

Ypu name this place and the first item that pops up in your mind is Chocolate Avalanche! No doubt one of the best deserts I had in years but there is something I found a little too much and that is the sweetness of the chocolate sauce. No doubt when tasted in singularity the sweetness is fine, when one mixes it with other dishes then its sweetness becomes too much. Had it been a bit more bitter it would have fitted perfectly.

I was in a haste last evening and was at Hazra. I was hungry as well and found Bon Appetit nearby. 'Twas a small place but beautiful decorated. At places swings are placed to replace tables. The ambience was nice overall. After going through the menu I thought of having thin crust pizza, which was of 8 inch. I asked them about any signature dish or any but they don't have such. So I asked for the best from the pizza menu and they suggested Tangy Chicken Meatball Pizza. The Pizza was nice, chessy and topped with chunky meatball, which were heavy compared to the base. I was enough satisfied with the food and overall I'm giving this a 4 out of 5.
P.s.- Prices in the menu are not including GST.

It is a small cozy pocket friendly restraunt. You might not get the comfort of an airconditionered restraunt but the sitting arrangements are quite unique with oscillating tables and dice shaped stools. 

The food including the deserts are quite satisfying. The spicey chicken salad and the pastas satiates your taste buds completely. The sandwiches are equally good where u get chicken in its each and every bite but only it could have been a little more thick in its size. 
Coming to the desserts section, the chocolate avalanche is a must try. It is pretty heavy and is offered in a good quantity. 

However it's a little difficult to locate the place being in a small bylane. Another drawback of this place is its cramped accomodating area. The ambience and service of the place is appreciable. Overall a good place for friendly hangouts.üòçü§ìüòç

Heard a lot about it and mostly good things. May be that is the reason i had great expectations from it. But i was disappointed. First of all the place is too cosy. Some of the tables r too small. What is even worse is the service. Twice we were served a item which we didnt order . Pizza was horrible really horrible. Pasta too was not that great which I heard it would be. The only good thing about bon apetit what i found is chocolate avalanche. You must try this if you come here. Another good thng is that it is pocket friendly.

This is a small place in Hazra and had been on my bucket list for quite sometime. The ambience is fine and so is the service. The food is what truly makes this place special. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We tried out Cheese Paratha, Chicken pasta and Chocolate avalanche. The cheese paratha was delectable and every bite was oozing with cheese. Pasta was average. The true star though was the chocolate avalanche. The brownie, the chocolate, the ice cream, it was absolutely lip smacking.

FINAL VERDICT- This is a nice place to hangout with friends and have quality food. The Chocolate Avalanche is a must try.

Almost the whole city knows that the specialty of Bon Appetit is their Choco Avalanche-that was what we tried out. It was pretty overwhelming.
We also tried out Pasta and their Sphagetti with Chicken Nuggets, which was okay much (good enough quantity).
Price could be a little more reasonable.
All in all, not a bad experience.

Having a really homely feeling, this cafe is located in a secluded corner of the street. A little hard to find,but most definitely worth the visit. A day out with friends, and this proved to be the perfect place for us. Lime soda, chicken pasta, and Mexican corn salad were on our list. And they were absolutely yummy. The ambience is wonderful and the decorations are so different from what I'd seen in other places. The little dice chairs and small tables really add to the unique atmosphere of this place, including the hanging tables. Definitely worth the visit and looking forward to visiting again.

It's a perfect place to hangout with friends. I absolutely adore the decoration. It gets very hot in there during summer, so would love to see a makeover of this place which will include air conditioning. 

Coming to the food. I ordered Chicken cheese pasta which is no doubt loaded with cheese. And you can actually feel the shredded chicken in your mouth with each and every bite you take. Then I ordered Spicy chicken pita pocket. It's a new thing I tried. And no need to say that I loved it. It's spicy but not too much. It is full of bell peppers with a little bit tangy flavoured mayonnaise sauce and full of chicken. Lastly I ordered one Chocolate Avalanche. It is by far the best desert I've had in a long long time. I would recommend all of you to try it. It's absolutely delicious and I love how they garnish the ice cream with a brownie and chocolate chips and a bowl of chocolate sauce. 
Summing it up. This place will keep it up to you and the best part is that you will get delicious food at a pocket friendly price!

Have gone to this cafe several times as it is near my college and is located in Hazra. The prices here is quite cheap and very affordable. A variety of dishes are offered which are quite nice. The only drawback is that this is a non ac cafe and as it is quite small it gets a bit suffocating especially during the sultry summer. However the chocolate avalanche of here is a must try and is too good to resist. A good place to visit with your friends which would not cause a hole in your pocket :P

Go check out all the flavours,  you would keep coming back.
I also loved their simple sandwiches and a corn salad.

Highly disappointed! I went there with my friend few days back. Ordered Chicken Cheese pasta where there was not a tiny piece of chicken, only pasta dipped in saucy cheese which doesn't taste too great. Then comes tangy chicken meatballs pizza which tasted flat. After The Parathe Wali, Gali Bon Appetit wasn't what we expected. Giving 3 ratings was just for Chocolate Avalanche. It came to rescue. Perfect proportion of chocolate sauce and choco chips on walnut brownie based with a scoop of vanilla  ice cream.

Had been there on a Saturday afternoon with one of my friends. The cafe is not just situated by the road it is a bit inside in a bylane and we located it easily through Google map.
It is a very cosy, small cafe. While entering you can see the open kitchen and then the main cafe is situated. The place was over crowded and we have to wait a bit long.
The main cafe is beautifully decorated with many pictures on the walls and swings were present as tables and a bamboo swing was there where one can sit and eat. The floor is checkboard type and the seating places resembled that of dices. We have ordered for Achari Aloo paratha, Thin crust chicken seekh onion and tomato pizza, Chocolate avalanche and Red velvet in a bottle.

1)The Achari aloo paratha was tasty and buttery and the stuffing was good.

2) Chicken seekh onion and tomato pizza( I personally don't like thin crust pizzas still gave it a try. The pizza did not taste good. The chicken pieces were a bit smelly and chewy felt kind of stale. The tomatoes were cut too large.)

3) Chocolate Avalanche( This was too good to be true. I would go back to this place again and again for this item. Two scoops of ice cream and brownie with chocolate sauce and choco chips and tasted heavenly.)

4) Red Velvet cake in a bottle( It was okayish not much worth mentioning. Though the way they presented it in a small bottle is cute and ample amount of butter was present and it tasted a bit salty yet sweet. The cake was fresh with vanilla chips)

Some suggestions of mine- I personally don't like it that while visiting a cafe one has to face the kitchen first. So, If somehow this can be changed then it's good. The waiting place is a just a lane heading towards the main cafe and people waiting happen to get collided with one another. So, it would be good if the space of the cafe is increased.
A really good place to visit during winters or on a cool windy day but in summer it is a bit suffocating and clumsy as no ACs are present.
Otherwise a good place to hangout with your friends.

The food was great.I and my friends ordered the pasta with cheesy sauce,the crepe with creamy herb chicken and spaghetti with meatballs.
Of the spaghetti and meatballs,the meatballs were really tasty but the spaghetti was not...It was bland.

The crepe was great,though a little bit thicker than I have had,at other places and really really creamy.Probably was a bad idea to dig into it right after the cheesy cheesy pasta.As a standalone it tastes great.They served it with chips.

The pasta was the best one.It was perfect.Yum.

We had a kiwi shake,which tasted okay.We also tried, everyone's favourite Chocolate avalanche,one whole bowl split three ways which was delishhh.so chocolaty!
The chocolate explosion is another hot favourite (picture lostüòñ) but it's quite small.Visually disappointing but gastronomically pleasing.

The ambience was nice.The decor was great for photos.üòçIt has already become a favourite spot for all our college friends.

The food came up soon,didn't make us wait much.
The only thing we disliked was the SELF-SERVICE.We had to get up and get plastic glasses and fill them up ourselves, everytime we needed a drink of water.It was a summer afternoon and there was no ac,too.That was annoying.

The  brownie with ice cream and chocolate syrup just wow. I just wanna have it again and again. Lot of options of food they have. Every1 Should definitely go for it.

One of my favourite places to visit in this city. The nachos never disappoints. For those who like drinks on the sweeter side can try their vanilla ice tea. I'm a fan of the crepes they have to offer. Pasta is however average. Do not forget to try their chocolate avalanche. This place might be a little uncomfortable in terms of seating arrangement but is worth a try.

Now coming to the food we ordered cheese paratha, tangy meatball pizza, schzwan chicken maggi, kadai chkn maggi and last but not the least the most amazing and heavenly chocolate avalanche. All the items xcept the maggi were superb. The maggi was total waste of money. Pocket pinch is low surely going back.

There are hanging tables in there though we occupied a corner table with a hanging seat.
We ordered for :
‚Ä¢ a chilli and salami pizza priced at 130 rupees. One bite into it and I felt I ate a biscuit.
‚Ä¢ we ordered several shakes as it was hot.
One mango shake, one midnight cookie shake and one chocolate shake. Every shake was priced approximately 80 rupees each. Pretty good and fresh.
‚Ä¢ The signature dish : Choco avalanche and it was a bit of heaven in a dish for chocolate lovers with wafers and ice cream and choco chips and brownie and what not ! Mouth smacking !! MUST TRY ! priced @ INR 130/- approx.

Our bill was close to 500 rupees.
Service was satisfactory. Cosy little cafe in the heart of Kolkata that you need to try out with your squad.Also perfect for a date. ‚ù§

Its a small, cozy place located in one of the lanes of Hazra. While its been decorated well and the food is decent too considering the offerings at such low price, what might really not be apt is to visit it during summers, never, if its an hot summer afternoon. Since its a cozy place, it gets a little conjusted sometimes, and with no ac, the situation only becomes worse. Again because of the price at which they offer food and a place to sit, I shouldn't complain. May be during winters it may feel a little better. Though in my opinion they should consider increasing the prices a little more and fit an ac to the place, considering the pathetic summers in Kolkata.

A bit difficult to locate but google maps helped us out. It is a rather small place with not so comfortable seating. You have to order and pay first, and then get served.
However, the food is really nice and hardly makes a dent in your pockets.
The four of us ordered, earl grey tea and cold coffee with icecream for drinks. Then we went for the grilled chicken sandwich, sinful mushroom and cheese egg crepe parcel, chicken nachos with cheese dip and salsa and cheese paratha. We also had the nutella and cinnamon pancake and chocolate avalanche for dessert. We ate a lot but it was just around 250 per person.
The cheese paratha, nachos, the sandwich and the chocolate avalanche for dessert were the best. The egg crepe parcel didn't really suit our palates and the pancake was doughy and really disappointing.
I also recently tried their chicken white sauce penne pasta. Verdict- quantity wise lots but not very appealing.
However, the 4.0 rating is mainly for the other dishes I loved and the prices!

This used to be a good place but god knows what happened. Last time I visited was 5years ago, food and drinks was good. This time, we ordered a lot of things. The BBQ crepe with mustard cream sauce was good but I don't know why they serve chips with it. Same with tuna salad, again served with chips. The spaghetti with chicken meatball was good but a bit oily. The drinks were horrible though, the iced tea taste like cough medicine. The service was bad too. Some tables were dirty and were not cleaned up. One of the chair had cake fallen on them. Flies come to our food to sit on. I guess it's good for school and college going students but I don't know how it got 4.1 ratings. Not worth it tbh.

Heard a lot of this place from friends so one evening planned to visit it... Had ordered cheese patha which was very cheesy ;-)nice to hv.. my friend had ordered sandwich and he resisted me to grab a bite from his one.. as he was in no mood to share it.. but he said it was good.. so sandwiches out there are good.. we ended up with chocolate avalanche i had my own .. didn't take a chance to share it with my friend... And yes it was too good.. if u are a chocolate lover u will love it... Let's now move on to ambience and feel .. i found the place to be small .. in summers u need to choose a cool day to visit it as it lacks AC.. seating arrangement is good... Hanging chairs and tables... Nice place to hangout with friends... Location a bit hard to find for the new birds to this place... Overall a good experience will love visit it again and again

The decor is eye catching. The seats/ swings are a nice touch. We hung out for almost two hours and weren't nagged by the staff to leave as soon as we had finished our food. The ambience and the food both make it a great place to chill with friends. 
Now coming to the food, the chocolate avalanche was so good that we had two. The spaghetti with chicken meatballs (4 balls) was great too, I had half expected the meatballs to be more floury than meaty, but I was glad to be proved wrong. The chicken mixed pasta was creamy and well made. It was the presentation of the waiwai bhel that made me laugh. Maybe they'd run out of portion sized plates for the bhel or something like that.

It was so near my college that I turned into a frequent visitor.  A small cozy cafe in the  backyard of an apartment, tastefully lit and decorated.  Choco avalanche is something heavenly. Padta in tomato sauce, aloo paratha, pan cakes, spaghetti with meat balls, nachos...etc etc...I liked them all.

Went there yesterday.. Heard a lot abt this place.. But was displeased by the place completely. 
First of all there was no ac at the place. Place was suffocating. I would not advise anyone to go there  at this summer. 
Then there was self service drama.. Asked for water and replied sir self service hain then when I went for water, it was at room temperature hence we can term it as hot.. 
Ordered choco avalanche and cheese paratha.. Both of the food were amazing. But we were not able to complete both due to the suffocating room and hot weather. 
Food was tasting great though I would advise you to wait and go to the place during winter or spring.. Place is a complete no go for this climate due to no ac reason.

This was my first visit and the food was a bit let down. We had ordered Chicken club sandwich Mexicana, Spaghetti with chicken Meatballs, Cheese paratha, Mango Milkshake, Strawberry Smoothie and Choco Avalanche. Sandwich was dry and the chicken pieces was invisible. Spaghetti was bit too tangy and spicy for my taste. Cheese paratha was nice stuffed with gooey cheese an absolute delight for cheese lovers. About the drinks , Mango milkshake was the best out of what we had ordered, strawberry smoothie was a thick yoghurt based drink which i liked but the artificial flavour of strawberry was overpowering. Choco avalance needs no introduction it's a pleasurable treat to end the meal.

Small place, poor service, not too great of choice in the menu, and nothing too special about the ones that are there...the only thing good about this place would be the way they have done the interior...I have tried Chocolate Avalanche (dessert), a pasta, Hawaiian Chicken Salad (with surplus of olive oil between bites) and the Valentine's Week special Strawberry in a jar (back in February)... nothing was worth it.

2 stars only for the decor.

P.S. On asking to clean the tables (for the fourth time), the personnel just wiped the remnants of the previous meal on to the floor right next to where we were sitting, and abracadabra, clean tables!

Its my favourite go to place when I am broke but want to have good food. Its extremely pocket friendly. Been here numerous times with friends. Its a great place to hang out with friends. Though the place is small, its very cosy and decor is very interesting! You can sit here as long as you want, chat with friends or read books or do your own work and nobody will really disturb you. 
The famous choco avalanche is my all time favourite. All the goodness in the world is combined in one bowl- brownies, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, choco chips and wafer straw. I have tried their cheese parantha, chicken pita pockets, pancakes, crepes, chicken nachos, tangy chicken meatball pizza, tiramisu and green apple soda. Nothing has disappointed me so far except their nachos. I cannot wait to go back again and again! I can never get enough of their food. 
This place is true gem and everyone should visit it at least once in their lifetime.

Food - Italian food and desserts available. Food is good to taste according to the price. I tried spaghetti with meatballs which is a bit spicy and is full of pepper. "Anti-pepper" people may dislike it. I am one of them! üòõ In mocktails rose soda and lichi sparkle were good. Rose soda is an intense flavoured one. And the Bon appetit special and a must have is the chocolate avalanche. The dessert is a bit heavy but is heaven to dessert lovers! 

Ambience - Good place to hangout with friends. Funky decor is a cherry on the cake. The hanging tables are something different. Though a non-ac restaurant, the open roof and decor pull the heat away from you.

Service - Its kind of a self service here. The order had to be placed at the counter and payment has to be done immediately. The food will be served at your table but for any idea extra service and wantings self-service is te best one.

Rates - Cheap food and good taste. What else is needed!

Foid is really awesome.
We tried 

Chicken grilled sandwich :4/5
Veg pizza. 5/5.... really a whole new level of taste.
White sauce pasta: 3.5/5
Choco Avalanche.5/5

Services are a bit slow as only 2 people are there.
But wait is totally worth it.
I have heard cheese paratha here is really awesome although it wasn't available on that day.

Pizza and choco avalanche should be on the list of must try .

Bon appetit is located near jatin das park. Just follow the map and there you are. 
I have had a number of dishes over here. Pastas, salads and chocolate avalanche.  
All the dishes I have tasted so far were amazing especially the chocolate avalanche. It is the best. Chicken Hawaiian salad was too good. 
This place is nicely decorated with interesting sitting arrangements. This place is very cute and I absolutely love it. :)

Had come here one evening with my sisters to catch up. It is a hub for college students. The one negative point is that it isn't air conditioned and therefore is a little uneasy for the summer. But that is made up with their food. It is a self help kind of restraunt where you have to order at the counter. But they bring the food to you. The chairs were a little uncomfortable but their tables were actually swings which was something different that I saw.
Coming to the food, we ordered an olive corn capsicum pizza, nachos and cheese pasta which was was all fine. But the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of their chocolate avalanche. It is just heavenly. If you come here this is the one thing you must have without fail. It will literally bring a smile to your face.
Prices are ‚Äãreasonable but they do make you wait for quite sometime before they serve you.

I went there yesrerday for some evening snack. The place is very small. But seating arrangements and the interior is beautiful. I didnt had much time to notice the whole place as I went there alone and was feeling a bit awkward because of few reasons (will not mention it here).

I ordered for Chicken Cheese Pasta which was horrible. I didn't like it. I ordered Cold Coffee with Icecream. And Chocolate Avalanche.

Cold Coffee was okayish. But the Chocolate Avalanche stole my heart. People should visit this place only for this obe item Chocolate Avalanche. Its awesome.

Going to visit soon tomorrow most probably to tey out other dishes and Chocolate Avalanche of course Yes!

The food was literally amazing...the chicken coleslaw sandwich was good...and the nachos with chicken and salsa and mayo was yummy....
We ordered two drinks... Watermelon and blueberry iced tea... Although I was looking for ice inside...i found some blueberries... Not a bad deal actually... Nd they tasted good too... 
Chocolate avalanche is pending next time... 
This place is worth a visit... 
P. S: bon appetit is located near paramount nursing home... There is a lane right beside d nursing home... From dr go straight... At d end turn right.... Thn go straight again...take the first lane on your left.... Nd you will find d cafe...

This outlet is located opposite ¬†Sujata Sadan,Hazra.It might be a little hard to find but totally worth it due to is reasonable pocket pinch and the quantity of food served.It is an all time students favourite outlet.
The place itself is small as it is a refurbished garage.The tables are swings hanging from the ceiling which is pretty cool and the decor is refreshing.
Coming to the food we ordered :
Mint soda which was plain bad.They used some syrup i guess which did not taste like mint at all.
Spicy chicken salad which was a great hit.They served it with some chips and the quantity was enough considering the price.This dish changed my perception of salads for good :)¬†
Spicy chicken stuffed pita pockets which was also very tasty and nicely served.
The star of the however was Chocolate Avalanche.It was absolute heavenly.The brownie with the hot sauce was perfectly complemented by the cold vanilla ice cream.The chocolate chips and the choco sticks provided an interesting texture to the dish and better still it was enough for 2 :)¬†
So if you are planning to visit dont give the Chocolate Avalanche a miss. :)¬†
Planning to try out a few of the other dishes next time.

This place is a bit whacky to start with , the hanging tables and a cottage like ambience sets this place apart from all. The food here is exceptional , the Cheese Paratha , Chocolate Avalanche taking the top slots among the many dishes you'll come again for. The only factor that bothers is that this place is a bit too clumsy , though not too much and the fact that it's not air conditioned makes it's a bit challenging to visit during the hot summers.

This place just happend to be on the go, without much expectation. Placed at the back of an alley along with a small space gives you the feeling of a concept cafe that is still being experimented. 

The interior has been creatively designed with proper usage of the small space. All those complains(if any) regarding the output gets nullified when you happen to spend some time and munch through some food. Masala tea @40 and a mustard based mushroom dish along with pasta and noodles at rates that barely hits your pocket, yet tickles your taste bud. A small waiting point eventually turned out to be a great hanging spot. 

A must try for all students who craves for food yet are short on their pocket money.

Bon appetit has been there in my wishlist since 2012 when I saw a picture of Chocolate avalanche in one of my friend's facebook profile. So this has to be in the list of my order. Along with it we ordered Ultimate Hot Chocolate served with whipped cream, Chicken cheese pan cake and chicken nachos with cheese and salsa dip. As many of the items were cheesy so it didn't take much time to fulfil our appetit. All the items were toooo good and I loved the Chocolate avalanche. But the only thing I disliked about this outlet is the space inside the outlet is too short and It was Non-AC. So this is the reason why I gave one point less (4/5).

   The decoration is good. Being it a small tiny place it is one of my favourites. Talking about the service provided, it is great. No faults!!

Coming to food its average. Taste good as per the price. Pocket friendly restaurant . I had chocolate shake and chicken sausage jalape√±o pizza and it was good. Overall it was nice.

One of my favourite places. I have been here numerous times. Great food. The chocolate avalanche is the best thing one can order. The pasta is great. The cheese paratha is also very good. In fact the whole menu is very good. Cozy environment and good ambience. The decor is very pretty.

Had the penne pasta, grilled chicken sandwich and chocolate avalanche. All of them were delicious.

P.S. the only downside...No air conditioning

Bon Appetit is a li'l garage turned into a cafe tucked in the lane just opposite to Sujata Sadan,Hazra.
We have been there zillions of times and this caf√® always surprised us with quality delicasies.
They offer a decent variety of thin crust pizzas,sandwiches,shakes,parathas and desserts.
Take it as a suggestion,don't forget to order a 'chocolate avalanche' - a bowl full of freshly baked gooey brownie,vanilla ice cream,loaded with chocolate chips and sauce and two chocosticks.
All the items are reasonably priced.

A little but well decorated joint tucked in the lanes of Hazra. Bit difficult to locate it. The place is bit small and have fewer seats and table available than the number of people crazy for it. So most of the time, especially in evening you will find queues outside the place and you will soon realize the reason once you taste the food here.

We ordered Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Cheese Stuffed Omlet, Chicken Seekh Onion Pizza (forgot to click pic), Litchi Sparkle and Green Apple Soda and last but not the least Chocolate Avalanche.

Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the thin crust pizza was good, actually the sandwich was better than most of the other well known cafe out there. But the cheese stuffed omlet, that was something different. It was full of cheese, was served with two slices of butter toast and some potato chips. The amount of cheese they put inside it made it look and taste mouthwatering delicious.

And then came the king of the show, chocolate avalanche, boy oh boy, just one word to describe it - HEAVENLY. Have read a lot of good things about Chocolate Avalanche of this place, and now I know the reason why it is so famous. It was a great experience and looking forward to visit this place.

And I will advice anyone reading this review to visit this place once for that heavenly Chocolate Avalanche if not for anything else.

Food - 4.5/5
Ambience - 4/5
Service - self
Location - 5/5

This place is a cafe which is made out of a supposedly garage ! The staff here is very friendly and this place has a self service system ! The seating here is unique with a small swing in between to keep food and eat on ! Also it has a very good small swing to sit upon which is like an antique made of cane wood ! It is always swarmed by college and high school people because it's vicinity to many tuitions and the famous Ashutosh College ! 

Prices here are reasonable and the quality of food is really good ! All sandwiches, different types of Maggi and pastas are really good and each is unique. The sauces as the dips will make you lick your fingers 
.@The mushroom dishes here are a must try along with the recommended dessert chocolate Avalanche ! 

Toast with mushrooms on top and nachos are also good enough and worth a try ! The drinks and shakes are also worth a mention.

The only thing I didn't find upto the mark was muffins ! But being a fast food joint it's service time is really fast and also the place is regularly serviced by Swiggy people . This place closes quite early compared to others.

Pocket pinch being Maximum of 400 for 2 this is a must try place for every one who crosses Hazra and one should not miss this place !

A crunched up place in the lanes of hazra road.  pretty popular amongst the young crowd.  their food is okayish. Could have done more improvement on their seating part.  now comng to the food...we ordered the chicken sheekh onion tomato pizza.  it was really dry and not upto the mark.  then We ordered the chicken grilled sandwich which was really good.  also we had ordered the green apple soda and the litchi sparkle soda. For dessert we had choco sundae fudge which was good.

The place is beautiful and well decorated. The roof is semi-transparent, beautifully decorated with grapevines. The seats are like a dice and the floor is like a chess board. Two of the dinings are hanging tables. This place is really cool also having lots of good nobles to be read.

Yesterday I went there for the first time, I ordered 1 chicken pasta with tomato sauce and mushroom, 1 cappuccino, 1 chocolate shake, 1pizza and finally a blueberry cheesecake. The cheesecake was not only delicious but it was a treat to the eyes as well..I'll try to post a pic of it... Everything about this place is awesome except the fact that the service was a little bit slow.. n that may b because of the reason that they prepare the food instantly... Otherwise it was a very good experience for me n my friend. I would recommend other youngsters like me to check in to this place. Thank you

went to this small place on 13th feb . it is little difficult to find . right opposite to sujata sadan in hazra there is a small lane . you just need to walk straight and you will see this small joint on your right side . the place is nicely decorated with different sitting arrangements . i personally didnt feel comfortable to sit there . nevertheless you have to stand and go to the counter to order your food and they will serve it to you on our table. chocolate avalanche is all we had on that day . the dessert was good enough to get a 4 point out of 5. vat charges are extra and no service charge .

Bon Appetit was one of those names which I always wanted to visit. Finally came that day I reached the place at around 4:30 pm and found there was not a single empty table. In about 15 mins we got a table for 3 of us.

1. The place was tiny, congested and extremely noisy. The songs they put on thier player were very high in volume. Tables were very low, a very uncomfortable seating arrangements except two hanging tables and their adjacent chairs. Those hanging tables were pretty cool. They don't have A.C. but fans. So it feels quite uneasy in summer because of its over crowded state. Walls and its decoration was simple and decent.

2. On the first place we ordered a Chicken Pasta with Tomato Cheese. Honestly they took almost half an hour to serve that. When we went to ask them for it, their reply came in a very unpleasant way which was not at all expected. They do not even bother to keep tissues with their food services. We had to take it from outside counter.

3. We ordered three of their items- Chicken Pasta with Tomato Cheese, Chicken Pasta with Cheese and Choco Avalanche. As I stated before, the first one took long time to get served. But it was worth waiting for. Covered with spicy chilli flakes and with its cheesy taste, we loved it like anything. The second one ain't take time to come, it was good with Cheese but we found the first one better. Sorry Guys !!! & lastly their Dessert part was Soul soothing- Choco Avalanche. Heaven comes with it. Heavily covered with choco chips, that course was worth going to the place. It is a must try of their cafeteria.

4. Their menu provides a variety of foods. & their price is very very pocket friendly. In a very reasonable price range, they serve good quality and quantity too. If they handle their visitors in a more friendly way, then it would be more enjoyable for our next visit.

Been to both the hazra and salt lake outlets.

Good affordable grub.

The cheese parantha

The thin crust pizzas

The nachos

And the chocolate avalanche remains favourites.

Only complaint would be that the place is non-AC and tend to serve warm water during summers.
The hazra outlet should keep water bottles instead of miniscule flimsy plastic use and throw glasses, requiring one to make several trips to the entrance of the cafe for drinking. The process becomes super difficult when the cafe is full and cramped.

A small caf√© in the bylanes of Hazra,spotted it at first go.
The place was a little cosy, and nicely decorated, swings instead of table, and without AC.
Too noisy, and absolutely not suitable for a date as you wont be able to hear what the other person has to say.
Good place to hangout with friends, but again not for large group.
Food wasn't something extraordinary but it is least expected considering the low prices.

This is a pretty place with swing tables.But the place is tiny and less spacious. 
The price of the food is pocket friendly and the portions are also satisfactory.
They charge 14.5% tax on food.
We had thin crust chicken salami pizza,mustard mayo mushroom crepe,Chicken spaghetti in cheese sauce,green apple soda,and red velvet in a jar.
The spaghetti was the best item.
We did not like the red velvet jar cake.
Other wise everything else was fine.
The service is prompt.
Its a nice place for hangout and remains crowded most of the times.

The price is very reasonable. It has a huge a wide range of food, starting from cakes to pizzas. The CHOCO AVALANCHE here has always been a saviour to m chocolate cravings. I've been to this place many times and it has never failed to meet my expectations.

A great place for college goers. I visited the Hazra branch quite a few times . I won't suggest it for a heavy lunch venue but definitely for light snacks and some amazing desserts.
¬†I always prefer to have their Cheese Paratha,Chicken Cheese Omlet which they serve with bread toast and chips and their thin crust pizzas are love.
I must say, once you visit this place PLEASE do try out their THE CHOCO AVALANCE,this one is pure bliss for your taste buds. And also go for their Nutella Chocochips Pancake .
I have also tried their apple pie but didn't like it much.
Recently they have added taxes to their menu which obviously broke my heart but still this place is worth your visit.
Once you enter you will fall for their amazing decor with little hanging tables from the ceiling.

I must say, once you visit this place PLEASE do try out their Thin Crust Meat Ball Pizza, Spaghetti with Meat Balls, Mixed Sauce Pasta, Chocolate Pancake and obviously THE CHOCO AVALANCE. 
For those who haven't yet visited this place, HURRY! This cafe won't let you down. And I love their decor.

This place is a bit hard to find but their food is worth all your troubles.
Their ambiance is quite good with swings and hangings cute tables and decorated in a pretty different fashion. However if it was air conditioned it would have been great as it's almost a necessity in summer at least after you have walked for some time in the scorching heat.
Their service is a bit slow and you have to remind them a few times to make it quicker. 
Their food is great.
Their pastas in mixed sauce is quite good, their salads are satisfying as well. Their pizzas are quite good with oodles of cheese making your day. 
However their chocolate avalanche is a pure delicacy and a treat to your taste buds. If you have a sweet tooth then it's a must try even if you skip the main course. Their hot chocolate in winter is just for your gloomy Monday blues.
Recommended place.

Bon Appetit is a simple restaurant with a brilliant menu. Why simple? Well, you dont have to spend a fortune here, every dish is pretty economical. The menu will give you a nostalgic feeling about your childhood. Now, the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. The menu is simply amazing, a wide variety of eclectic dishes. Good distribution of both veg and nonveg food. 

2. The price will not cut a deep hole in anyone's pocket. And the quantity of a dish is more than enough for a person.

3. The service is really fast and prompt. No unnecessary waiting.

4. The decor is great. I really liked the idea of using big wooden swings as tables.

5. Food is served piping hot. 

6. I had chicken maggie: it was delicious and just awesome. Also I took chicken omelette, it had a brilliantly seasoned good and heavy filling. The omelette came with two pieces of buttered toast and potato chips.

7. Food is made fresh, not microwaved.

Cons

1. Nothing as such, but the chicken filling in the chicken omelette was a bit chewy. It was really difficult to pulverise properly in your mouth.

2. I also took a green apple soda, it was extremely sweet and less fuzzy.

Overall it was a great experience, but Bon Appetit please look into the matter of chewy chicken filling and too sweet green apple soda. Otherwise you are doing a brilliant job. Keep it up.

This is a small place hidden in the lanes of Hazra. Limted seating and menu options with a decent ambiance. The food is nothing extra-ordinary but a good hang out joint for friends over a cup of tea or coffee. Well behaved, courteous stuff but can do a little better with their service time. The food was decent apart from the Wai Wai which was particularly not very pleasing. The best thing about the place is the small sing they have inside the cafe which definitely is the best seating option.

I Zomato-d this hidden little place, turned out to be quite popular. Located in the bylanes of Hazra, this place is frequented mostly by neighborhood college goers. The place is a little crunched up but, they have made optimum utilisation of the available space by replacing the old fashioned tables with swings. It's innovative except for the fact that it actually swings a little when you try to eat. 
Our order comprised of one Spaghetti with Chicken Meatball, one Chicken Penne Pasta and two Chocolate Pancakes. The service is a little slow but, I didn't mind much as I was catching up with my friend after a year so the slow service was benefitting for me. Other than that, the pancakes are bathed in chocolate (if you like it that way) - it was yummy for me. 
A good little place for casual hangouts. Bon Appetit!

This place has a lot of memories for me as my sons used to go to the playschool located in this building once upon a time. The playing area of that playschool is the cafe now. They have retained the tables and chairs and boxes and I could recognise some of the furniture. The place is cosily decorated and pretty decent. We started off with a miss as pizzas were not available. However the cheese paratha and sandwiches that we had were tasty. Loved the handbeaten coffee and hope to be back for more

A short distance from hazra crossing this place does not boast of a spacious surrounding but it more than makes up for it in food. The cheese pasta was satisfactory with the right amount of cheese and herbs, the thin crust chicken seekh onion tomato pizza was okay as was the spaghetti and meatballs but the highlight of my experience was the chocolate avalanche. Hot brownie with cold vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, choco chips, wafers will make any person's mouth water and for a foodie like me, it was a little piece of heaven.

Well a long time back had a bad experience with this branch with oil pouring out of every dish they serve and had stopped visiting this outlet, but this visit changed that mindset. Cheese partha was yummy as expected, Nachos was equally good. Ordered a corn cheese crepe which was so-so types.

The next was apple pie which was horrible as hell, had to litteraly throw it, we even failed to see any apple in that apple pie. This was followed by choco avalange which was as usual utter delicious, thus ending our visit on a higher note.

Bon Appetit is a tiny light food restaurant which is beautifully decorated from inside. The ambience is so nice that you would like to have a photoshoot there as well. The signature dishes will include chicken and cheese pan cake, pasta and the most favourite choco avalanche. I have had choco avalanche million number of times at Bon App. It's the best place to spend some quality time with your friends or your partner. The quantity is more than enough and at a very reasonable rate. You will be left licking your fingers after you're done with your food. It's a self help food joint and the service at the counter is good. I will give full marks to the presentation of the food items, its taste and the ambience.

One of my most loved cafeterias! The decor and ambiance is awesome! But space is limited and you have to often wait for more than 30 minutes in the evening to get a seat. I've tried chicken club sandwitches mexicana and their signature dish choco avalanche! Quality and taste are both good! The sandwitches are served with potato chips!

A pretty cafe tucked in a by-lane near hazra crossing is worth a visit considering those tasty foods within that budget ! I went on Christmas with one of my friend and somehow managed to get a place very easily. One will definitely love the ambience there. We ordered white sauce chicken cheese pasta and chocolate avalanche.  The pasta was truly a delight. Probably the best pasta I have ever tasted . It was perfectly creamy , loaded with cheese with succulent chunks of chicken . Next was their signature dish chocolate avalanche which was again amazing . The brownies within it were perfectly made and chocolate simply overloaded the bowl. It was heaven for any dessert lover. And all these were well within our budget.  Definitely a must go.

A perfect cafe when you are on a budget but want to enjoy good food. Specially suitable for school and college goers for often visits from college. That too when it is situated in such a great area like Hazra. Within apporoximately 400 rupees, we ordered for a Chicken Jalapeno Pizza, and 3 cups of Chocolate Explosion. I loved the pizza since i prefer thin crust pizza. So not a place for people who do not like thin crust pizza. And the dessert was great. The dessert was quite heavy. Interior is very cute. But the problem is there is no air conditioner. We went in november and we were sweating. Do not know what happens in summer. Sitting area is too small. And tables are too close to each other. Service is slow. But i liked the food. It was good. So the 4 goes for the food and cute interior specially the swing tables and those grapes and artificial plants hanging from top.

In hazra area, it is one of the highest rated cafe. But when visited the place I was disappointed. Only baby chairs are available for sitting. How can a 6ft. guy can accommodate in that small chair! They serve in cheap plastic plates! I have ordered veg nachos, gender honey tea, black coffee. Only decent edible item was ginger honey tea.  They don't accept cards or paytm for payment! Pay only by cash. If you are clostrophobic don't even think of this place.

I was tempted to give it a 3.5 but gave it a 4 . I have my reasons . So read on. A classic hangout place for youngsters who are low on cash but high on adda. But it catches the eye of all generations for its food, friendly uber cool ambience and amicable staff. The staff at both the locations are genuinely nice ppl, And food too is from the heart. No false pretensions here. Been to both the locations and enjoyed every time. I am always drawn by their wai wai ( cheese , mushroom , Schezwan ) ,  cold coffee, aloo paratha, thai chilly paratha ,  sandwiches and their mushroom on toast. 
Recently tried their babycorn crepe in pesto cream sauce , sauce was delish but found babycorn undercooked, hand blend coffee was good one time and disappointing the other time. Whimsical are we! But exotic shakes are homely and nice! My personal favorite is the mint cookie one!Their is so much variety that there is always something that will catch your eye with very little pinch on your wallet.
You gotta eat here and hangout with your friends!

Wai wai and mushrooms on toast , parathas and  their tea/cold coffee is a must try!

Walking distance from Jatin Das Park metro.
The place can host around 15 people at a time, so not very large. It's seating area is like a courtyard with faux grapevines, lanterns, and some wall-fans. Not extremely comfortable for sultry afternoons.
Also, the seats are very low, and the tables are swings. One movement causes it to wiggle, which can be a problem.
This place has more staff than their Salt Lake outlet, but still they took longer to serve in comparison. But we didn't mind as we had time to kill.
We ordered a chicken jalape√±o pizza. It was pizza bread with some tomato reduction, chicken sausage toppings and jalape√±os. It was not cheesy, which is a major drawback. And was quite difficult to chew. It had a thin crust but was more like a bread stick than pizza in terms of texture.
Not satisfied with the pizza. Will try something else next time. Prices are okay but feels high when compared to the food we ate.
PS: based on their Salt Lake outlet, recommended: Choco Avalanche. That's amazing.

It was a Monday afternoon, my friend and I were searching for a place to have some lip-smacking food alongside having a chit-chat. It was then when my friend forcefully took me to this place.
Firstly if you are visiting this place for the first time then you are sure to get lost if you don't use navigation. On reaching the place you realise that it's a small cafe run at the ground floor of a residential building. The sitting place is as big as a house-room with a slight fancy seating arrangement. 
We had ordered a Cheese Paratha, a spicy paneer creme crepe, a Jaljeera soda and a Choco Avalanche. The total bill was just 400rs. Keeping the price aside, the food was as delicious as any other over rated cafe. 
A few things to keep in mind for the next time you visit - 
1. It's works on a prepaid system, where you'll have to place your order at the counter by paying the amount. Don't worry the food would then be served at your table. 
2. Don't forget to collect a few tissues at the time of placing the order as you won't be provided with any at the time of serving. 
3. This isn't a place to visit in the summers as there isn't any air-condition facility at the cafe. 

All in all, if you are willing to spend some time with friends or your better half and are looking for great food at pocket friendly prices, away from the hookah smoke in the bright day light, then this is the place for you to be.

Not as good as the reviews are. Not awful either. Manageable. Had the Schezwan chicken maggi. Average. Nothing special. Seats were horrible, just small cubes to sit on. Tables are hanging from the roof, and so they swing, very risky if you have hot coffee. Overall a very average experience.

Want to spend a good time with your loved and dearest one's then Bon Appetit is just the right place for you.

Ideal ambiance for the youth to chill and choose from an array of delicious and lip smacking items on the menu.

I ordered :- 

(1) Chicken Jalape√±o Pizza 

(2) Mango Iced Tea 

(3) Cold Coffee with Icecream 

(4) Chocolate Avalanche

Just about the other day when me and my bestie were bored and we're willing to try something different. 

What better than going out on a food hunt spree.A lucky day for us,as it brought us to Bon Appetit.

The "Chicken Jalape√±o Pizza" was amazingly put together with just the right thinness for a delicious crust and was loaded with cheese.Every bite of the pizza is capable of taking you on a lovely tour of France with it's deliciousness and perfect balance of flavours.Topped with chicken sausages,black olives,jalape√±o;this pizza is one to make you fall in love with.

The "Mango Iced Tea" is a relief in the tacky and sweaty summer season as it filled with the flavour of green and tangy mangoes and also has a dash of sweetness to it.The sweet and sour flavour of this refreshing drink is bound to make you wink and giggle as the flavours are itself joyous.So sip as much as you can of it because it surely is the drink of your dreams.

The Cold Coffee with Icecream is absolutely bliss.The base decor with chocolate syrup adds to it's taste even more and the coffee is very well balanced with right amount of milk and coffee powder.The icecream on top definitely makes it more yummy and is sure something you would like to share with your lover from the same glass.

Now,the star of the evening was the massive and mighty "Chocolate Avalanche".Loaded with chocolate and icecream,it was food heaven;actually dessert heaven.Filled with a rich and hot chocolaty and nutty brownie based with vanilla icecream topped with almonds,walnuts,chocolate chips,chocolate syrup,chocolate wafers and even more chocolate.This is something one must must must try.

Prior warning though you just cannot share the Chocolate  Avalanche wih anyone it is so frigging tasty!!If you are a chocolate lover then this my friend is your dream dessert,trust me!!

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

The joint is too small. The seating arrangement is funky, or plain weird. Location is odd. Service is nothing special. But.....this is a very special outlet, a priceless one. And when I say priceless, I mean it.... The prices are really less, and the foods are really good. The chicken club sandwich mexicana that I tried came in good quantity with proper fillings and good taste. The same thing can be said about their pasta. And I loved the nachos.....great. I am not fond of desserts, but but chocolate avalanche was really good (though too sweet to my taste.....told ya, don't like dessert).
Lastly, if you're planning to visit this outlet and now browsing through their menu on zomato, going crazy on what you should order, think no more, have their egg crepe parcel, any of the three (though if I were you, I would've gone with sinful mushroom and cheese). The egg crepes are their best offering according to me.
Happy meal....

Its just one a minute away from my place.Bon appetit has always been my go to joint.But recently the food quality has degraded so much.I ordered my all time favourite Choco avalanche, the brownie was so so hard , the ice cream was too melted , it's nothing like before.Even the place itself is sometimes quite dirty. Can't really suggest this place to people anymore.

This food joint is a big hit among students. Ideal for sudden plans & hangouts. Its a bit difficult to find as located in a bylane of hazra. Not much spacious but ambience is very nice with a funky decor!
Have tried almost all of their dishes from pastas to nachos but my favourites are - Cheese paratha, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Spaghetti with Chicken Meat balls (lip smacking for spice lovers). On my last visit, tried their famous Chocolate Avalanche for the first time - it just won my heart, a bowl with a heavenly feeling :p and is highly recommended!!
The only problem is that service is a bit slow and I think, according to the demand of this place they should increase the number of sitting arrangements.

A perfect joint. The cafe is very easy to find and the food qualities are quite decent compared to its pocket-friendly prices. Anyone going must try out "Chocolate Avalanche", i think they are best at it and one of my best chocolate delicacies i ever had as i'm not so fond of chocolates. Apart from these every other item is damn tasty be it parantha or pasta or sandwich, everything tastes so so good. The guys rock. \m/.
Only problem is if you visit during summer it will be bit problematic cause there is no A.C. or any such thing so the place usually heats up during those days.

This place has got quite a reputation and invariably my expectation level was high. Was craving for some pancakes. So ordered in pancakes with honey and butter. I specifically asked them to pack the honey and butter separately as I don't like too much honey with the pancakes. Nevertheless they couldn't care less. The pancakes came immersed in honey. Now while some people may love it, it was just incredibly sweet for my taste and I couldn't eat after a few bites. Not to mention the pancakes weren't soft and fluffy as you would like. I had also ordered Sinful chocolate mousse in a jar, but since they didn't have it they changed it to chocolate and rum. Not too happy with that either. It was just full of raisins and dates. Too sweet again. Couldn't finish that either. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. Will have to give this place another try, but nothing sweet this time.

Ordered home delivery from this outlet and was extremely disappointed. In today's world when packaging is done in so many unique ways to see that food delivery to the customer reaches properly and satisfactorily , we got the pizzas all messed up and pieces on top of others. # Not  acceptable. 
How does one go wrong with pizza delivery but they did??. Then the crepes we ordered....the less said about it ....they put the chips on top. Result....soggy chips. Bad # lousy packaging.
That said the taste was good. But I'm never ever going to ask for delivery from this outlet.

Been there today with my girlfriend.  The place is near Hazra crossing. The ambience is pretty good & Food is amazing. We tried Choco Avalanche & Black Forest in Jar.  I would recommend Choco Avalanche to all Ice cream lovers,  its a must have item. Only issue with the place is they don't accept cards. Pretty much satisfied withb the food joint. Would like to visit again soon.

This outlet is pretty stylish and modern. Food is good as expected. It doesn't have an air conditioner and thus becomes extremely stuffy and suffocating in summer. Otherwise it's worth a visit during the winter Season.

Pros-The ambience is nice. The food quality is good and the prices are quote cheaper.
A perfect place for youngsters to hang out.
Cons- The place is very small to accommodate a lot of people. If it would have been a bit more spacious then this place is paradise.

This is a very close to my heart place. The food served here is hands down amazing , tasty, cheap, and versatile.
All along that I have visited and kept on visiting here I have tried a lot of items , like -

*Hand beaten coffee - being a coffee lover I cannot say no to this cup of frothy and creamy perfection.

*Cold coffee - a colder version of the above, an all time yes in the summers.

*spaghetti/penne in white/cheese/mixed sauce with chicken- yes I have tasted all these preparations. And they make real yum pastas. Perfect boiled and smooth pasta (not at all sticky) . The sauces are runny yet consistent and has a good texture. Shredded chicken and veggies, all comes together to a great preparation.

*cheese paratha - whatever be the "paratha of the day" I'll always order a cheesew paratha. This is the ultimate innovation to parathas. The best and tastiest and effective one. Stuffed into a large pizza size paratha is gooey spiced up cheese. Every bite make you want more.

*chocolate pancakes - my another favourite dish. The pancakes are moderately thick and soft. The chocolate syrup is dense but runny and comes together wonderfully. The combo can never disappoint a soul.

*loaded nachos - crisp tortilla chips with overloads of olives and mayonnaise and ranch dressing. I felt the dressing was ott. A little less could be perfectly done with.

* nutella walnut brownie - a chewy yet gooey yet crisp on the outer. An ultimate brownie you could expect. The nutella keeps its texture anyhow..and come on a little load of chocolate didn't harm anyone. Has it?

*jalapeno and chicken pizza with olives and mushrooms - toppings are as amazing as it sounds. The only "umm okay" part is they use readymade pizza breads. They taste good as long as it is warm. Then the pizzabread hardens as we know.

I'll never stop coming here. Ever. :D

Well the first dish I tasted was chocoavalanche! The name justifies the dish! It's so damn good. A must try if you go there. I went today and ordered it again with my other friends and they loved it!

Place is small, both in Saltlake and Hazra, but if you are a food lover, then you will love this place. Haven't tried cheese paratha or Choco pancake but will go there again to feel it's taste.

I had been planning to go to his place for quite some time. Pujo seemed like the perfect excuse and there we were. The interiors are quirky and cute. But it's pretty uncomfortable without any air-condition. Especially if it's a full house.
We had chocolate avalanche. My oh my!! It was worth every penny. Such a happy dessert, made with the right amount of everything nice ‚ò∫
This is now my go to place for the avalanche.

One of the most pocket friendly places to go in the city, Bon Appetite is very popular among the youth for its mouth watering taste and pocket friendly prices. Cheese lovers are requested to stay away from this place else u'll get addicted to it, be it the hot cheese paratha which is loaded with cheese and butter or cheese maggi....u simply cant leave this place with having either of the two. Drinks however on the flipside are average but the food certainly makes up for it.
The decor is simple and small tables and chairs on one side and hanging swing tables on the other. The only shortcoming for me again would b the lack of air conditioning especially during summers.
Cheers to the entire team of Bon App...keep delighting us guysüëç

A small dine-in cafe with nice ambiance and interiors. Can accommodate a maximum of 25 people. This place might get a bit hard to locate, considering the route you take.
Service was Decent.

Heads:5
Order: 3x Chocolate Avalanche (Rs 115 each) 

This item is available in almost every cafe with different names. It's vanilla ice cream with warm brownie , topped with chocolate syrup and choco chips. Wherever you try this, if good quality stuff is used, always makes a Magnificent combination. The mixture of vanilla ice cream with delicious warm/hot brownie would always win the heart of your tastebuds, considering you have a soft side for desserts. 

One bowl can be shared by two easily, else you might feel a bit uneasy consuming it alone unless you're special but the pocket pinch without sharing might prick you. 

There's no hygiene matters but make sure you don't fiddle much with the glass tables.

This hazra outlet, being near to my University, is frequently visited by me and my friends for a quick-bite. This is a cute and tiny eatery and is very pocket-friendly. ¬†The thin crust pizzas are delicious, the tangy meatball being my all-time-favourite. The sandwiches and wraps are pretty tasty. They make some superb pancakes. The brownies , mousses and sundaes are yummy. The chocolate avalanche deserves a special mention. But I would have been happier if they served the brownie hot with the ice-cream as they serve in their Salt-Lake outlet. This is a nice place to hangout with friends.

One of your best College-kids friendly space in the city with filling food. 

Pros : 

1) Incredibly cosy ambience 
2) Nothing costs above 145rs
3) Impressively vast menu 
4) Good portions of food per serving
5) They'll serve your gang one plate of food with 10 spoons without judging you at all 
6) Pretty balanced collection of books suited for (nearly) everyone

About the food, it tastes pretty good if you're not being picky. As in, the meatballs in your pizza or pasta are springy frozen chicken but placed in quite a delicious sauce and your cheesecake would be a unpleasant gelatinous cottage cheese thing but with a pleasant blueberry flavour and some rather good biscuit or cookie dough crust. 

The pizzas are thin crust and cheesy at the best. 
The salads would amply satisfy your hungry adolescent stomachs. (tested and verified fact)
Lastly, the chocolate avalanche... looks like simple and DIY at home stuff but let me assure you, tastes seriously like heaven, a tad too sweet heaven. 

I would definitely go back.

P.s. I do love the decor a lot but the tables are literally 'swings' ! *facepalm*

Yesterday visited there and expected a lot as I searched in zomato and the reviews were quite influencing but disappointed a little.
Location : not so bad 4/5
Decoration: 5/5
Sitting arrangements : cool but that 'jhula' thing is not appropriate as if you try to get a drink or any other food item , you may not feel comfortable. 
Menu: 5/5 ...they got a wide range of menu to confuse you, what to try what to not.
Food : 3.5/5 
            First we ordered sodas of green apple and ginger fizz : 4/5 
            Then ordered nachos with cheese dip and salsa with chicken  : salsa doesn't impressed as wished. 3/5
Then comes penne chicken pasta : 5/5 this impressed me.
Thn thin crust pizza with meatballs and tomato cheese sauce : again the sauce was not that much tasty, garlic taste dominated there but the meatballs were tasty . 3.5/5
Then at the end walnut date muffins: tastes good but didn't found a single bit of walnut in it. 4/5
Servicing: 3.5/5  you have to give your order at the counter they won't come but they serve.
Most disappointing thing is that they don't have any wash basin to wash you hand and they don't offer you water in table, you have to  go to the entrance, there they have a water jar from there you have to take plastic use and throw glass and fetch water and also wash there only. 
Expected a lot .

Such a beautiful tiny cute gem over here! May be a small eatery but they serve no simple caf√© items. Their uniquely gathered menu which is a fusion of italian and Mexican, will insist you to visit again and again. 
Tucked away in a small lane very close to hazra crossing. Take the first left from hazra crossing to be more precise or second right from the hazra more bata footpath. Or you can trust the google map, as there is no such prominent landmark. Its a non ac cafe, certainly not a good option when your day is tedious. But nobody will bother the ac trouble, cosiness of the cafe, unwelcoming service of stuffs. These things are negligible when you are literally captivated by the tranquility. This place itself is ravishing enough.

 * delectable thin crust Chicken meatball pizza
* Black Forrest shake was enticing regardless of the amount of cream and partially melted dark chocolate. 
*The best part was chocolate avalanche, the most acclaimed and hymned desert of bon apetit. Vanilla ice crm loaded with thick chocolate sauce and mouth melting brownie, choco chips and wafer. 
I prefer quality over quantity.
Thumbs up for the quirky theme, serene ambience, delicious food and inexpensive price. 
Witnessed millions of mesmerising moments.
Revisiting in a month (or a week) (:

This is the second time I came here with my friends. It's a perfect hangout for college goers, extremely pocket friendly with amazing snacks. I love the uniqueness of having swings as tables. The decorI nice. Only negative point is the place is a bit small , and in hot weather like today, without ac that is some problem.
But as soon as the food starts arriving, you can forget everything.
Three of us had sodas with 3 different flavours as freshners . The mint wasn't that good , but the mango and green apple was good.
Then came the Mexican corn salad and it  is an amazing sweet corn salad
after that we had the lichi flavoured sundae . It was good but I loved the blueberry flavoured more the previous day.
And I can never come out of there without having the chocolate alvanche. It's heaven recreated .

Probably one of the best and student friendly cafes in city, Bon Appetit offers best pancakes in city. We ordered chocolate pancakes and believe me it was so yummy. Apart from that we ordered pasta penne with mixed sauce, beans on toast and olive corn pizza. Pasta was very good and best thing was that it was not that much spicy. Beans on toast was ok. Pizza was too good. Waiting to come here again and try other items .

My first encounter with this place happened last year . The first thing i didn't like that i have to pay for the food at first. So even anyone have to order anything while they are eating or finished eating, they have to go again at the cash counter , order & pay and then u can have food again. Most of the people here come with friends and in mid of chatting anyone have to go for order , it was kind of disgusting in my opinion. Though food was great. After hearing lot about chocolate avalanche , wanted to give it a try. Ordered a avalanche with extra choco stick and chicken ¬†nachos. Chicken nachos was pretty good in my liking. There wasn't any dip . Though the sauce they used was good, and chicken was very little in amount, but after looking at the price i won't judge. But i lost my words after taking a spoon of chocolate avalanche in mouth. It was sooo delicious . Hats off to bon appetit for making this awesome ice cream in this price. There was two scoop of vanilla ice cream, one chocolate brownie, lots of choco chips, choco sauce, two choco sticks, (but ordered two more extra which costs me 15 rs i guess). Overall experience was great, but nowadays they add some extra taxes, it started few months ago.

A very unique set of choices. Generally outlets of such scale don't provide such a unique menu, but Bon Appetit has taken the risk and is working quite well for them. A mixture of Italian, Mexican and some finger food, this place provides tasty food, in good quantity, at low prices.

We had Nachos with cheese. I never knew nachos could be served with shredded chicken. It was tasty, quite tasty. Spicy Chicken Salad, then. Served with a few potato chips, the salad was a dense cold mixture of corn, some vergies and shredded chicken. It was delicious too. Finally ice cream, Blueberry Relish, served with a signifcant of cashew. Nothing out of the ordinary. This is a popular student hangout, because of its tasty food and friendly prices. Will visit again.

This place is amazing. When I was in Kolkata, we used to be regulars here. They offer a wide variety of quick bites and drinks. Aam Panna is my favorite drink and their cheese paratha, Maggi, waiwai and pasta is delightfully tasty. The ambience is great with seats that look like dice and tables that resemble a swing. A good place to spend an evening with friends.

A popular hangout joint in Hazra. The chocolate avalanche they offer is really good. Pita pockets are worth a try. Other foods like nachos, pastas, pizzas etc are just fine. I used to visit this place only because there weren't any good cafes nearby. This joint is so obviously overrated. Previously the joint was really cheap but with time prices shot up. And with so many new quirky cafes opening up in the city Bon Appetit must provide us with a reason to visit them.

You might be the biggest food critique and have the greatest knowledge on restaurants, yet there are few places that you don‚Äôt judge based on their size, decor or how comfortable the seats are, how strong the AC was, or how your food was presented. Bon Appetit is one of those places. It‚Äôs a small eatery/cafe tucked away in a small lane in Hazra serving simple food, clever enough to lure your taste buds into visiting again.

It is small place hard to locate situated in a gali. This place is a friends hanging out zone. Food is awesome though a bit expensive. Had the chicken seekh onion tomato pizza. It was delicious full of molten cheese. It was thin crust and crispy. Just loved it. Next we had smoked chicken grilled mustard sandwich. It comes with potato chips. Good for snacking. It was quite good. And finally the dessert was showsstopper. It had brownie full of choco chips and molten chocolate underneath was vanilla and chocolate ice-cream. The dessert was heavenly. It is a must have. The decor is good. I loved the idea of swinging tables and little cute wooden chairs. Overall had a great experience.

Located near the hazra crossing, this is a nice small place to have small bites.
Ordered the chicken thin crusted pizza, mint soda, nachos, cold coffee with ice cream, lime soda, pizza in mixed sauce and pizza in cheese sauce.
The mint soda tasted like a Colgate toothpaste drink. That was really pathetic.
Their pizza was fine, but a little more moistness was required.
The sodas were really nice. Loved the lime soda. Very refreshing.
The pasta in mixed sauce was a really nice.
The pasta in cheese sauce was amazing.
They spread a lot of salsa spread over the nachos and after a point of time it becomes soggy.
They have average quality food and can be improved in many ways. The staff was nice and the seatings were a bit uncomfortable.

Our group of 4 had come here for lunch, after listening to some spectacular recommendations. At a first glance, this place is situated in a residential area, but close to Hazra crossing and Jatin Das Park Metro Station. It's a quaint little place, and when we visited, it was empty. But oh, don't let that say anything about it's quality of service and food! The overall ambiance is homely. And its adorable! The tables are swings (YES they move but NO you can't sit on them, there's a separate swing for that!), and the chairs are little but comfortable, and they also have stools that look like dice! The decor also includes false grapevines and creepers hanging along the ceiling. It's beautiful! ¬†The staff was very friendly, and they took our order with smiles on their faces. We had ordered one Chicken Penne Pasta with white sauce, one Chicken Penne Pasta with mixed sauce, and 2 plates of spaghetti and meat balls.
When the food arrived, it looked delectable. But when we actually took the first bite- Oh we had died and gone to a heaven of cheesy, creamy deliciousness! When I say the Pastas are a must-have, I mean YES THEY ARE. I swear, this is the best place for having pasta, in the entirety of Kolkata. The spaghetti and meat-balls were really good too, mainly the meat-balls rather than the spaghetti. But we fell in love with the pastas.
We had ordered 2 Chocolate Avalanche for desserts (1 shared by 2), and when they served it- it looked like all my chocolaty desires had been combined and served in a bowl. It was- basically, a large sized brownie, loaded with chocolate chips, along with a yet another large scoop of vanilla ice-cream, topped with hot chocolate sauce, and garnished with two chocolate wafer sticks. Again, ONE OF THE BEST BROWNIES in Kolkata.
I rate this place 5/5 and I would 100% recommend this place for people who don't like crowded places, for pasta lovers and chocolate lovers. Do try the dishes mentioned, and I promise you won't regret it!

Would definitely visit again, as soon as I can!

Photos attached for reference. And yes, sorry, there are no pictures of the mixed sauce pasta and the spaghetti and meatballs. Honestly, we were a group of hungry and tired college students, what do you expect?

It was the occasion of a friend's birthday treat and we, 14 people, dropped in into this small cute cafe located very close to the Hazra Crossing.. They were kind enough to adjust the tables and the dice-like seating chairs to accommodate all the hungry souls.. I could only remember the thing i ordered that is the mixed sauce chicken pasta among so many other orders.. It was very tasty.. But the show stealer was the Choco Avalanche..  It was yummy to the power infinity...  Gooey chocolate brownie with generous amount of cream, vanilla ice crean, chocolate sauce and choco chips... Felt like I was transported to the chocolate factory of Willy Wonka where everything was made of chocolate...

 Will definitely visit again to try other stuffs and ofcourse the Choco-Avalanche..üòá

Location: AD-34, Sector-1, Salt Lake, Kolkata. West bengal-700064

Ambience: Cosy environment. Small place yet well decorated. Nice arrangements. Electric designed caf√©. A place with extremely reasonable price. Nice choice for a hangout with no no more than 5 friends.

Food: I mainly went there for a dessert session. So directly jumped into that section where I had A Blueberry Cheesecake. Its a sweet dressed containing of 2 layers. The main and the thickest layer consists of fresh cheese. And the bottom crust was of crushed cookies,topped with whipped cream and blueberry along with some flavoured sauce. Blueberry lovers like me must try it once. Then came, Chocolate Avalanche. It is a sweet dessert which contains not only two scoops of vanilla ice cream, there's also a dallop of chocolate mousse and a gooey chocolate eggless brownie doused in chocolate sauce. These wafers don't contain eggs either. So go ahead and delve into chocolate paradise. :) 
I was satisfied with my  savoury desserts here. ‚ò∫

Fantastic little place for a small hang-out with some close friends. And really good food and lots of laughter on a rainy day just went hand-in-glove. We went today and it was first visit. First of all the grape vines hanging from above(even if artificial), the hanging chair and those hanging tables were new and exciting decor! The food my friend and I ordered were Choco milkshake with ice cream, The exotic Black Forest shake and two Chicken and cheese pancakes. The pancakes were wholesome. They were perfect little round pancakes with cute food arts. Soft and drowned in white sauce I fell in love with the pancakes. A must-have. The shakes were good. A bit too sweet though. Overall it's a lovely place located in a lovely neighbourhood.

I have stopped by this place only twice so far, but have heard some real good things from my friends from the Ashutosh College.

Have tried their Pita Pockets and loved them.Tried thin crust pizzas the first time in my life and my heart went out to them!
The Chicken nachos with cheese dip and salsa are to die for.

And, well, dessert, I leave that to you to ponder on .... ;)

I was eyeing this place for long solely due to the adorable choco avalanche! I used to give so much 'nawjor' to the pictures of choco avalanche that were uploaded on Zomato! Finally, today I managed some time to visit the cafe. Location is a bit tricky! Trust google map blindly! My friend is a regular there so I didn't have problems locating the cafe.  

Well, it's a petite cafe with a quirky decor! It isn't strange if one feels claustrophobic but that's pardonable! 

The food! Oh boy! It's finger licking good. Spaghetti with meatball was a must courtesy, the number of thumbs up the dish has received in zomato! Well, it was spicy and filling. The meatballs were round and prominent and gelled well with the spaghetti. The sauce was hot and was enticing to my taste buds! Next came chicken pasta in white sauce. Personally, I like red sauce but this too was a delight. It was cheesy, creamy and flavourful! The quality of penne pasta was top class. Then came chicken sausage jalape√±o pizza! The thin crust was crispy and crumbly! I personally did not like the generous amount of tomato sauce that was applied on the crust. They could have served the sauce separately. But the generous amount of cheese and chicken pieces won me over. I was not disappointed at all. Then came chocolate avalanche! Ah! Vanilla ice cream, chocolate brownie, chocolate sauce, choco chips, chocolate sauce! It was luxurious and devilishly good! Total was some 664. The food satisfied 4 hungry souls. I would say it's pretty cheap. Overall I had a gala time there. Will frequent the place from now on! ;) I totally recommend this one.

The food was good, no doubt. Decor was okayish. But it had no air conditioning and was way too noisy. The staff behaviour wasn't too good or too bad either. Service was on the average side. The caf√© is extremely small but we didn't face much problems as we went for an early breakfast.
Loved the chicken sheekh onion tomato pizza inspite of not being a pizza enthusiast.
The pancakes with nutella were average again. But the cold coffee with ice cream was nice. And the best part of my meal was the chocolate avalanche! Absolute delish and a must! Overall, pocket friendly and absolute yum and quality food. However, they should really consider air conditioning as they don't even have a real roof!

This is another place that I have long been waiting to go to. On a rainy Sunday afternoon, I decided to head to this place for lunch. I must say that finding the place is a bit difficult. Particularly if you're in a car. I was walking and still got lost for a while! Perhaps it was just my poor navigation skills!

Anyways moving on to the important part which is the restaurant and the food itself, I must start by mentioning that it's a very tiny and cute looking place. I placed my umbrella on the holder and entered the tiny room which at best can only hold 20 people. So as I made myself comfortable in the tiny die shaped chair, I had a look at the menu though I had already decided what I was going to have, so with a quick glance I placed an order for the Black Forest Shake, Non veg mixed sauce Pasta and their highly acclaimed Chocolate Avalanche.

The Black Forest Shake was amazing! One of the best that I have ever had! I loved the tiny slice of cake and the rich chocolate flavour!

The mixed sauce pasta was next! It looked kinda less on quantity but I was definitely wrong about that! It was really heavy but also delicious. There was a lot of cheese and it was quite indulgent!

Finally came the Chocolate Avalanche! It was heavenly! Lovely chocolate brownie with rich chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. I loved it a lot and the quantity was a lot! Towards the end, I found the whole dish a bit too sweet but it was still enjoyable!

As a whole I had a wonderful experience with the food and it seems like a wonderful place to relax with friends or just sit with a good book.
A must try for all! Not for a formal gathering but perfect for a casual friendly meal!

Happy Dining!!

Swings, books, pizza, pastas, pita pockets, sandwiches. What else do you need to have a good old adda with your friends??? To end it all, CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE!!!. The service time is a bit long but the food is absolutely worth the wait.

I love this place. The interior space is very limited but the manner in which it has been decorated gives you a very cosy and comfortable feeling. The food is awesome and very pocket friendly. Chocolate avalanche is one of my and many others' favorites as well. You can try almost anything on the menu and you wont be disappointed.¬†
If you have not been to this place, please do. You wont regret.

This is one of the best cafes I've been to, in both Kolkata and Mumbai. The chocolate avalanche is a classic dish, and the taste simply remains in my mouth even after three years. Other dishes are equally good, like the sandwiches, pies and pancakes. The hot bowl of Maggi matched the mood on monsoon evenings. The ambience is simply great, especially with the swings and checkerboard floor. The first time we went here about 4-5 years back, we felt like we entered a French cafe. The cafe is really special for me, as it was always our favourite destinations on weekends. Now, after moving to Mumbai, this is one of the places I miss the most. I'm waiting to get back here soon, to try out the new additions to the menu.

Well, to be honest, this is a really well decorated cool little cafe. If only there was air conditioning, it'd have been a lot cooler(pun intended). A couple of months ago, two of my friends gave me a surprise b'day party at this place. The people here were generous enough to let us celebrate my birthday here all with a cake and candles. We ordered a plate of pasta and two chocolate Sundae. Word of caution: The quantity in the Sundae was too much for me handle alone and I am a big guy. I recommend you order just one cup for two people. It's genuinely a cozy little place and is also 'okay' on the pocket. Looking forward to giving this place another go pretty soon.

I've been visiting this little caf√© since time immemorial. Definitely one of my favourite places to savour Chocolate Avalanche on a rainy evening. The interior exudes a very cutesy vibe and is perfect for the gen-Y!

However, last week when my friend and I were in dire need of food, Swiggy came to our rescue and we ordered food from here. Needless to say our tummies were extremely happy with the good food at our disposal. 

Being a pure veg, my friend ordered :
‚Ä¢ Nachos - this was a completely DIY dish. I loved the way they had packed every little item in zip lock pouches. The tortilla chips, the olives, the jalapenos, the sour cream and salsa sauce - everything was packed very nicely. 
‚Ä¢ Cheese paratha - the paratha priced at 90 is a bit on the higher side, but with all that cheese oozing out of it, it can melt anybody's heart! Loved how they provided the mango pickle, also in a zip lock pouch.
‚Ä¢ Mixed sauce pasta - the stunner of the evening! The penne pasta was deliciously prepared and I was left licking the container! I swear, it was that great!

Pocket pinch - Around 450! Totally worth it. Such good food can transform any boring evening into a deliciously lipsmacking one!

I had heard a lot about this cafe; the dice shaped seating, the cute interiors, the attractive pricing and the delicious food.

I wasn't able to visit the cafe so decided to call for a home delivery.

I ordered: 

Mushroom pizza
tomato cheese Mix sauce penne pasta
Nutella Cinnamon  cream pancakes
Fudgy Chocolate net crepes

The menu prices are easy on the pocket . I was unsure about quantity till my food arrived, but I was quite impressed once it did.

The pizza had 4 big slices with loads of Mushroom, and taste wise it gets full marks too.

The penne pasta in mix sauce was al dente, I just loved the creamy mixed sauce and the flavour wants me to call for some more soon.

The nutella pancakes were small pancake roundels topped with a gooey chocolate sauce topped with a dollop of cream finished with a sprinkle of cinnamon. I liked this one though I'm not a cinnamon lover.

The chocolate crepes were mind blowing
Soft crepes filled with crushed brownie chocolate sauce oozing out, as well as drizzled beautifully on it. With dark chocolate chips for the crunch factor in every bite. The presentation even in parcel for this dish was amazing.

My home delivery experience has been great.
Looking forward to visiting the cafe soon.

This afternoon(12.8.16) the 5 of us went to this cafe after college. The place is near Hazra tucked away in one of its by-lanes. If you coming from Rashbihari, turn right. This cafe will be the second lane on the right. It's near Jatin Das Park metro station. Google maps will help you locate it. It was a cozy little cafe. 5-6tables were there. We spotted some books on a shelf near the doorway which being a book lover did impress me a lot. So did those swings hanging from the ceiling serving as tables. The grapevine type decorations on the ceiling was very innovative and Beautiful. There were a range of items to choose from. After much contemplation we ordered Chicken mixed pasta, Veg mixed pasta, Mixed nuts brownie, Strawberry Sundae, Mango Sundae(since the blueberry one was not available) and of course Choco Avalanche. The service was a bit slow considering the place was empty enough. The Pasta was served piping hot. The taste was delicious. The amount of chicken was ample enough. The Veg pasta was good too. The Mango Sundae was better in taste than Strawberry Sundae. The Strawberry Sundae tasted a tad too sweet for me. But the hero of the show had to be the Choco Avalanche. To say that it was absolutely heavenly would be an understatement. The chocolate brownie topped in vanilla and chocolate sauce with the Choco chips...the whole thing was just too good to be expressed in words. And the portion is too big for one person. My suggestion would be share it. Our bill was 905 bucks including 14.5tax which was pocket friendly if not dirt cheap. The only problem I noticed that they don't provide water with the dishes which can be rectified easily. All in all it was a satisfying outing for my friends and me. Hoping to come back soon.

This place is a little hard to locate, being tucked inside a lane deep into Hazra.
The interior is quirky, and quite pretty, although a little small. Sitting was a bit of a problem for tall people like us. Our knees kept banging on the table. :P

There were three of us. We took a chicken sausage jalapeno 8" thin crust pizza. It was standard, the way it's supposed to taste. Basically, nothing exceptional.

Then we decided to take a choco avalanche each. Warning: this is a very bad decision.
We were full about halfway through! We were really struggling to finish it, and finally had to let some go to waste. It was delicious though, which made it even sadder.

It was a good experience overall. Will be going there again with an empty stomach just for the avalanche. :D

The cheese penne pasta I had was pretty good! The coffee was a delight, being a deviation from the boring machine made ones. Prices looked a bit higher since the place is non-ac.
Scope of Improvement: 1. Would love to have a better false wall with graphiti.
2. Some magazines or books to read for occasional single visitors.

Bon appetit is located at Hazra. The cafe is very well decorated. I loved the interior decorations. The behavior of the staff were cordial. However,  coming back to food we ordered meatball pizza. The taste of the pizza was amazing, however they took a lot of time in serving the dish. One minus point about the place is that it is non-ac. However it's cool inside. Waiting to try out their brownie.

The ambiance is quite good .They have set the shop in a small room in the ground floor of a building and the decorations are good enough.We tried all the different pizzas and they were good.I liked the chicken seekh pizza the most.Among the desserts,of which we tried almost,chocolate avalanche is the best and we really hated rum ball(that was the worst). Other than that,it is a great place.Obviously it deserves multiple visits !! <3

Swings, small chairs, dices and swinging tables make up this small eatery at Hazra. The place is never quiet and packed most of the time. The interesting fact is their take on most dishes that would make anyone think hey wait what! No matter how many times you go there you wont get tired of visiting this place and if you're taking you're girl along make sure you order 2 chocolate avalanches cause in all probability she wont be sharing her dessert with you. This is one of those places where their calorie intake meter stops working. The chocolate avalanche is basically a steaming hot brownie with scoops of ice cream and chocolate chips. It is orgasmic in the truest of senses. The ''Melt in your mouth'' term is an understatement for this dish. The hot steamy gooey brownie goes perfectly with the ice cream and chocolate chips. Also a must try would be their Cheese paratha with liquid cheese oozing out inside your mouth when you chew it. Served with curd and pickled onions, it is heavenly. Besides these, the Hawaiian Chicken Salad is worth mentioning.

A visit to Bon Appetit was long due.
Finally yesterday I reached the place at around 4:45pm and found there was not a single empty table. 
The place was extremely noisy, we were waiting in the area opposite to the kitchen/billing counter.
An observation: I saw a staff sneezed covering his  nose with his hands. Then without washing his hands, he straightaway touched a pizza and put in on the plate!

Anyway, finally we got an empty table. I ordered a walnut brownie and got a muffin. On raising the concern, the staff said that both muffin and brownie were the same thing! When I protested, another staff came and told me that their brownies look like muffins, but they taste like brownies!!! 
I was extremely irritated and went to the counter to complain. The 3rd staff, after arguing for sometime, finally admitted the mistake and then I got a real brownie.
Hence, Service : 1/5.

The interior is cute. Space is less and little congested but well docorated. There is no AC, we were sweating profusely but nevertheless, it was fun being there. Decor/Ambiance: 3/5.

We had brownies, ¬†Creamy corn and cheese egg crepe parcel, Pizza and chocolate avalanche. Brownie was great (thankfully...after so much hassle), the crepe was average, pizza was good and chocolate avalanche was decent.
Food gets 3.5/5.

Price: The popularity of this place is mainly for the absolutely reasonable, rather cheap prices! Very pocket friendly. 5/5

Portion: Enough for 2! 5/5

I have visited this caf√© so many times in the last one year that I've lost count. This is indeed a very pretty place for with some real nice food at a not so high budget. I've had their pasta, salads, nachos, pizza, flavoured iced tea, blueberry cheesecake, and of course the chocolate avalanche. I really love their chicken pasta with mixed sauce. It's so full of cheese and absolutely yummy! The flavoured iced teas taste more like syrup and I'm not very fond of them but you can really sip on one in between the overwhelming taste of chocolate of the choco avalanche. One of my favourite hangout places in the town!

Yes, this place is so popular that it is perennially crowded with youngsters and college-goers so there's never room to sit. And why wouldn't it be? It serves yummy food at affordable pocket-friendly prices. I have been here twice and ordered in once and all three times i have really enjoyed the food. Special mention of the Corn salad and Mixed Sauce Chicken Penne Pasta which is gooey and spicy at the same time. I recall their shakes being pretty fabulous too. So...a big thumbs up to this cafe!

Went there twice with my boyfriend and both times it was a nice date. So this place will  always be special for me. Coming to the ambience the place is small but we'll maintained with a topiary of creeping vines and hanging pots overhead. The hanging  tables and wicker swing seat adds a very romantic touch to the otherwise funky chessboard style seating. But the place has no air conditioning which can be a bother during summers but the wide range of iced teas can help with that. We had the green apple iced tea which was refreshing and delicious. Chocolate avalanche is the bestseller of this place and it's a well deserved title because of generous amounts of gooey chocolate, choco sprinkles, ice cream and warm brownie. We also had the pasta with red sauce which was not so good.

I visited this place twice. First in the March 2015, and then in June 2016.This cute little place is situated in the lanes of hazra beside Paramount Nursing Home. Checkers tiles, cute lamps hanging, swinging tables and chairs. But the place is too small. And there's no AC..so yes going there during summer might be a mistake. Coming to the food, we ordered Chocolate Avalanche, chicken cheese pasta, chicken nachos, cheese paratha, iced tea, rum balls. All the food items were delicious but my personal favourite was cheese paratha‚ô• It was yummy.  But yes in 2015 this place was tax free but now they do charge for taxes. But its still a pocket friendly place.

I've been to the hazra branch, quite near my place.
The decor and music lift up the spirit.
Food is both splendid and fulfilling.
Easy on pockets.
Space is an issue, feels cramped up when full!

This was my first visit to Bon Appetit. Small place,but so nicely decorated..staff service is very good. We had one cheese paratha,it tasted heavenly. Loaded with melted cheese,and served with two dips. Next we ordered Choclate avalanche.. oh my god.! It looked so yummy,and tasted delicious. I just love chocolates, so I found this desert like just made for me. .üòäüòä amazing experience, visiting again soon. üòá

It was an awesome experience. I have been here several time. The food is like yuumm! I keep on drooling :D Try the Pizza and deserts. The interior is quite well. My favourite is the hanging table. ¬†I wish this place to be bit big. In the summer time it feels to bit clumsy and noisy.

A small hidden place near Jatin Das Park metro, its more of a hangout hub! Try out the cheese paratha. It is splendid. The pastas were pretty nice as well. Never order sodas here as they suck. The ambience is okayish, being a bit clumpsy and a summer afternoon visit might be painful(needless to say, no air conditioning).

Located in one of the lanes of Jatin Das Park, it is quite confusing at times to locate the place. It's a tiny cafe with a nice interior and ambience. The food is excellent. The cheese paratha is spectacular filled with molten cheese. The meatball pizza is also tasty. And not to forget the best of the lot, the chocolate avalanche. The service is decent. The price is also pocket friendly. The only disadvantages are the small chairs and there's no AC.

You will never get enough of it.All the food items are below 200 rupees and less so you happy in every way!I find the only let down to be their tiny space and no air conditioners.Apart from this everything here is good.Please go with your friends to make the most out of it.

Our college(Jogamaya Devi college) is quite close to this cute little cafe and thanks to the cafe timings, we can go there for breakfast because ours is a morning college. The food tastes awesome and the price is reasonable too. They didn't use to charge any taxes but recently they are doing so. Nevermind, we are a big fan of the pasta, crepe, pancake and choco avalanche to name a few. The decor is perfect for youngsters like us for clicking pictures. Overall it is a big thumbs up!

BON APPETIT : A STUDENT'S PARADISE

Location: Just a few minutes walk from Hazra Crossing. Its better to take help of your Zomato map as its situated in the by lanes of Hazra. 

Bon Appetit is one of those places where you would love to spent time with your friends with a very reasonable price tag on every food item. I planned to visit this place as I have heard a lot about this place from my friends. As soon as I entered the place it started creating a good impression. You enter from a small door with cash and kitchen on your right and you again enter the sitting area. I loved the sitting area with everything so beautifully designed. The quirky interior was something which was attractive. The ceiling was decorated with grapevines. I loved the different kinds of elements used to make the sitting arrangements. From dice shape chairs to swings you would get everything there. Another unique thing which I loved was the swings used to make tables. I liked the lights as well. It was bright and not like the dim and dark cafes which is trending nowadays. The things which I disliked was the forceful sitting arrangements in that small place and the place does not have an A.C. which is very important in a climate of this city.

Coming on to the food we ordered these things:

#Mango and Mint Mojito: This drink was not what its name suggests. The drink had basil instead of mint. It was not thick what it should have been and it lacked presentation.

#Raw Mango Iced Tea: Well, somehow I liked this but it was not at all what I expected. There was no tea flavour in it. I could only get the flavour of Raw Mango Syrup in it.

#Chicken Penne Pasta in White Sauce : The pasta tasted really good for a while but didn't taste good at the end as too much of white sauce was spoiling the taste bad.

#Pizza with Grilled Chicken, Olive and Capsicum: The best was saved for the last and I was really impressed with the quality of the pizza at that price. A definite go to option.

Last Words:
A very good place if you want to have adda session with your friends without spending much on food. If you want luxury and comfort or high end stuffs you can ignore this place.

A 3.5/5 is what I would give to this place

Bon Appetit is a tiny restaurant located couple of lanes from Hazra crossing. The interiors are very quirky. The ceiling has a grape vine design which is very appealing. The tables are hung from the ceiling without any support from the ground. The chairs are rather dice shaped cubes, might be a bit uncomfortable. The seating space is limited to about 15 people at a time.

The food is also excellent given the remoteness of the place. The Cheese Paratha is spectacular and completely filled with molten cheese. The Olive Corn Capsicum pizza is also amazing and has very thin crust. The Chocolate Avalanche is a outstanding and definitely a dessert you can develop a craving for.

The service was a bit slow, even though the caf√© was empty at that time. The prices are pitch perfect and the food is thus total value for money.

Here's the place that wouldn't burn your pockets or your friends', making you sated enough.
The way they indulge mayonnaise over pancakes, the sips and the old woody swings would keep you homely.

The quintessential cafe for today's youth; especially college goers who do not always have a lot of money to spend. Quirky interiors, with swinging tables & chairs, checkered furniture, stoned walls , posters and strategically placed mirrors; give the place modish vibe. The place is cheap and serves yummyilicious food. I have been to this cafe on numerous occasions it generally stays cramped with customers. Though the place is small, they make it up with their fast service and mind blowing food.

Must Try: Spaghetti with Chicken Meatball, Grilled Chicken Sandwich,¬† Hawaiian Chicken Salad, Chocolate Avalanche

A very small but a beautifully decorated like an indoor grape vine and the hanging tables and dice shaped stools,all adds up to the charm of the place, at nights with the antique look lanterns lit up and all the lights the ¬†place looks even more gorgeous . located in Hazra ,a little difficult to find though! But the food is absolutely divine. Almost every dish delights your taste-buds. Especially the chicken pasta was exquisite, then comes the chicken salad - a little spicy though but luscious (a big no for those who cannot have spicy food), omelet with stuffed chicken, spices, Mayo and cheese was totally enticing. We ordered a pizza too - not a place for pizzas.
Desserts - chocolate avalanche.. Delicious
Drinks - go for mock tails.
Must visit! :)

The very first thing that I noticed when I went in was the chairs in which we used to sit when we studied in Infant Class. They looked cute. I also loved the swings which they use as tables. Novel concept, no doubt. I also loved the false grape vines hanging.
But then,the space is cramped.  The chairs meant for infants become the cause of pain on the back of the adult. It is very difficult to sit comfortably without being nudged at by the guest from the other table.
And there is no AC.  Maybe this is the reason that the food here is cheap. But oh, in such a humid season and in such a crowded place, the heart craves for AC.
Anyway, I took plain cold coffee and tuna with mango salad.
And I loved them both. The cold coffee was wonderful to taste. It cooled me immediately. The tuna sala was also good - spicy with the juicy mango pieces gratifying the tongue. The staff is also well behaved. The food came a bit late, but it is natural, seeing it is so crowded. The price is also pocket friendly.

I can't help but feeling disappointed. Among the reasons the place is full of flies, no one waits the tables and you have to place your orders at the counter, they don't accept cards and many items on the menu are unavailable. That quite a lot of let downs and plenty enough to make me not want to come back. The food is ok, especially the mango crumble jar. However I will have to say that the decor idea is really nice with the wines and hanging tables and chair. It could have potential if better managed.

This outlet of Bon App√©tit has made a great impact despite being devoid of an air conditioner. From the menu to the swinging tables to its pretty decor, this place has managed to swoon youngsters over. It's not only a utopia for endless conversations but the offerings come at a fairly reasonable price, which is why the crowd is mostly composed of college students. 
Surely coming back again to indulge in the other options of a diverse menu.

Bon Apetit is located in a narrow stretch of lane in Hazra, extremely close to the metro station. It is one of such places where you would come out with the craving of returning back. It might not be air conditioned, it might not be a fine dining restaurant but it shouldn't be that way as well.

It like a teenager's summer afternoon and crockeries seem like child's play. Where the swinging table reminds you of long left abandoned garden and the swinging chair one's favourite seat. I always sit there and it's fun.

Usually I keep ordering the same dishes with a very close friend of mine who hates cheese.üôÑ It's our favourite gossip zone. I like their Chicken Hawaiian Salad which has chilli thing but yet not spicy. Along with it I always opt for Chocolate avalanche or any other chocolate dessert to compliment sweet taste along with spicy. They make beautiful pancakes and pastas too. I have tried their Chicken sausage jalape√±o pizza which was more or less okay.

They do not charge any vat. You pay what you see. 

Visiting this place is bliss!üòã

You might be the biggest food critique and have the greatest knowledge on restaurants, yet there are few places that you don't judge based on their size, decor or how comfortable the seats are, how strong the AC was, or how your food was presented. Bon Appetit is one of those places.

Its a small eatery/cafe tucked away in a small lane in Hazra serving simple food, clever enough to lure your taste buds into visiting again. What do you get here? You get some simple pasta dishes, you get some lovely pancakes topped with creamy sauces, you get some tasty shakes, stuffed parathas and then there is the Chocolate Avalanche. Everything that the guilty calorie digger in you craves for.

The food does not taste "Fine Dining" sorts, most importantly it was not meant to taste that way. It was meant to comfort your most indulgent cravings for hot, cheesy, saucy and spicy taste and textures and that is exactly what it produces. I particularly love the pasta in tomato & cheese sauce, spaghetti with meat balls, the parathas and the Avalanche.

The chocolate avalanche is without a doubt the most highly grossing item on offer. You will surely see, at least one of these on every table. The brownie is soft, the vanilla ice cream is not bitey, but soft and a bit melting, and most noticeably the hot and thick fudge that binds everything together. One spoon in your mouth and it will bring you a child like joy, and with a clueless-ly happy smile on your face you will be geared to tuck into that glorious bowl of sweetness again.

If if you have not been there yet, you should.

I had first been to Bon Appetit three years ago at a foodies' monthly group meet. There was a specific menu made for us which contained almost all the speciality items starting from nachos to meatball spaghetti and chocolate avalanche. I remember having ordered a litchi flavored soda for myself and later swoon over the strawberry iced tea ordered by someone else. The iced tea was much better than the soda. Personally, nachos don't get me salivating at their thought but the ones made here are pretty good with loads of cream and toppings. We had the paneer arabiatta on toast and I loved how the biscuit like little toasts were perfectly done with the perfect thickness and crunch. The double mushroom pizza was too lovable and spaghetti with meatballs were just fine, nothing great for me. 

Coming back to my recent visit a few days back, my verdict still remains the same for this pocket friendly food joint. We had a blood orange iced tea, creamy veggie blast pita pockets, chicken sausage and jalape√±o pizza and a rum chocolate pudding in a jar.
The iced tea had too much of the orange concentrate in it which gradually got balanced out as the ice cubes melted. 
The pita pockets were nicely done with a lot of filling made from fresh julienned vegetables and a white cream sauce. There was a pesto like mustard based dip on the side which tasted good. However, the chips were mostly broken ones found at the bottom of a packet and they stank of some bad quality oil. 
The pizza was a real charmer with a perfect thin crust, ample toppings and generous amount of cheese. Having a 8-inch pizza for 130 bucks is anything but a bad deal. There was a fair share of tanginess from the fresh jalape√±os and the overall taste was yum. 
I wanted a Tiramisu for dessert but those were unavailable, so ordered for the rum chocolate pudding and it didn't disappoint us at all. A moderately sized plastic jar is filled to the brim with a combination of light chocolate mousse, darker chocolate cake like pudding, whipped cream and bits of plum, raisins, almonds and cashew nuts. The hint of rum was quite subtle and I believe the fruits and nuts were soaked in the alcohol as they retained some of the pungent flavors of dark rum. 

The service is not commendable at all. They don't clean the tables until someone has to walk up to them and ask for it. Most of the tables didn't have the napkin stand and they did not bother to replenish the stock. Also, I found their attitude to be a bit arrogant while placing the orders. 
Overall, this place will always remain a crowd puller due to the good food at affordable prices but I hope the cleanliness is looked after more seriously.

This place is a common haunt. It's a five minute walk from my college. Pretty cheap. Well, it's not air-conditioned and thus no vat. Food is really good, well most of them. But a must have is their spaghetti with meat balls. Warms your heart, fills your tummy. And if you love garlic as I do, well it's recommended! Al dente spaghetti, sauce has a perfect balance of garlic and oregano. You might find it slightly tangy at first, like a friend of mine did, but trust me, you'll love the aftertaste. Meatballs are solid balls of chicken, perfectly cooked. It'll have you coming back for more. All their pastas are pretty good, and from what I've heard, so are their other savoury dishes. 
Choco avalanche is a chocolate lover's dream come true. But do not try to devour it all alone. The sweetness gets to you. And my satiation point is pretty low when it comes to sweet stuff. But it is a dessert to be shared.
Please do not try their tiramisu. Coffee is overpowering, neither does the cream go well. A very unhappy marriage. And don't go for their drinks, more soda than flavour.
You may try the blueberry cheesecake. All those of my friends who have tried it have come back with a smiling face and a happy tummy.
But you do get your money's worth. And barring a few of the dishes, I'd definitely recommend this place.

If you have a lot of catching up to do with your ladies this is the place for you. It is cozy and cheerful place with amazing food. 

Food : 1. Spaghetti with chicken meatball - cheesy and yumm. 
2. Grilled chicken olive capsicum pasta - Got burned so didn't like it.
3. Chocolate sundae - Simply waow. 

Service : Due to very less number of staff members the service is slow. 
Overall it's a nice place and i'm going back again.

The pocket friendly gem of Hazra; Bon Appetite  will fulfil all your short cravings for yummy food.. Located just in the small lane just opposite of the mutton shop in hazra. This joint is small but the food will overcome all its shortcomings. Firstly, the interior is unique (though non-ac), and intact. Ordered Spaghetti with meat ball, mixed sauce chicken pasta, and the main attraction the Choco Avalanche.. Pocket punch is relatively low. Even the cheese paratha, cheese pasta, egg wrap is also good. Visited a lot of times, and will visit again.

One of my favourite places for desserts. Such a small place is transformed into such a pretty place with little creativity. The ambiance is good with 90% of them being youngsters.

I LIKE THEIR: Cold coffee with ice cream and strawberry shake, spaghetti with chicken meatballs, chicken nachos with dips, egg crepe parcels, mushroom/corn-cheese maggi. They have good desserts in affordable prices. Chocolate explosion is my favourite. Their Tiramisu is also good. I just don't like the milk chocolate chips they use in their chocolate avalanche, otherwise it's good.

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: Pizza (very regular pizza like the ones you get in Mio Amore or Sugarr & Spice, except the fact that you have extra toppings here), stuffed pita pocket (bread crumbs were falling off indicating the bread was stale), the pasta in only tomato sauce tasted a bit sour so I'd recommend mixed sauce. The chocolate shake, ultimate hot chocolate (which tastes EXACTLY like Bournvita/Hershey's syrup in hot milk) and spicy chicken salad was ok-ok! Chocolate mousse and dark chocolate slice was regular. The blueberry cheesecake really looked great but I was disappointed on tasting it.

This is one of those places i use to visit with my people on a regular basis. This place has got such a nice decor and proper use of small space for sitting arrangement. Even when all the tables are occupied you won't be feeling congested. Coming to the food: Choco Avalanche and Cheese paratha. The best combination that this small joint provides.And the best part you will never be disappointed by the taste. It keeps om getting better day by day. The shakes are also very good. Visit this place for some awesome food without shaking your wallets much.

This place is located close to the hazra more. Its a small petite cafe. The ambiance is very casual and its a hotspot for youngsters. I tried out a sandwich (forgot the name). It was yum. They have a really nice desert menu. Overall well priced for what they serve. Only crunch is the seating arrangement, its a tad bit crowded.

Have order couple of times via swiggy.. Kindly put hot and cold food in separate packets as the heat melts the dessert.
That being said, an absolute value for money.. The garlic mushroom pizza is so so good and apt serving for one. The mix sauce pasta is a bit sweet but very tasty, tomato sauce arabiatta is spicy and nice.
Chocolate avalanche:deadly ! Must must have
Tiramisu was good too. 
Apple pie was hard and and blue berry cheesecake was disappointing. But I really enjoyed the savouries especially the pizza.. Yumm!

The menu looks great for a college rendezvous or a cosy date.Black Forest at 65, comes in a plastic glass with an innovative presentation. The Chicken Club Sandwich is a filler, served with fresh coleslaw and juicy juliennes of chicken and wafers on the side. Liked tge lichi sparkle and penne with white sauce. For desserts, the Avalanche did happen with the Chocolate and Vanilla ice cream melting over a slice of brownie.
Thumbs up to this beautiful decorated place.

This is a pretty little place cheerfully decked up with lamps and cute furniture. The fact that it isn't air-conditioned adds to its appeal. We went to Bon Appetit a couple of days ago for breakfast, and had a pleasant meal there. We ordered a Chicken crepe with mustard sauce, nutella and cinnamon cream pancakes, a Black Forest shake and a Midnight cookie shake. Everything was lip-smacking and very filling too. The pricing was reasonable too. My only grievance lies in the service, which certainly fell short of my expectations. We had to ask for everything- tissue paper, water, and even cutlery. The Salt Lake branch always has oregano/chilli flakes/ salt and pepper ready on the table, which was glaringly absent here.¬†
All in all, aside from the callous service we received, we had a good time here.
Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 2.5/5

This place was in my wish list for a long time and I visited this place during my German classes time. It was a bit hard to find but what a cute place. Although the swing tables are a bit scary to keep foods on and the place is quite small.
Customers park their cars outside and eat outside only if the waiting is long. So that does give an indication how the food is. Cheap good food. 
I loved the strawberry ice tea. Really liked the idea that they colour coordinate the glasses to ones order. The nachos were loaded and cheesy. Need I say more? :-)
The sandwiches were grilled to perfection. The quantity is really good. Couldn't try the chocolate avalanche though. Have to start with desserts on the next visit.

Visited 2nd time n decided not to go again. This place is sober only. Decor is good. Bt need some maintenances. Food is very average in taste and in service. Price is high in comparison to d quality of d food. Won't recommend especially to love birds in summer as dey won't b able to chatter in peace coz it gets vry hot inside nd there's no AC. Big groups r also not recommended as dey wont b able sit together coz dey dont hav dat provision.

A really nice place to hang around with your friends. Some might face difficulty locating this place but it's very easy.
From the hazra crossing take the road connecting to ballugaunge phari. Walk on your right hand side for 2-3 min, you will find small narrow Lane leading to this beautiful joint.

I have visited this place many times and today I thought of giving a review.

The ambiance is nice , well decorated.
Service is good and they will help you with your choices.

Today afternoon I visited this place with a friend of mine.
We had-

1. Mexican club sandwich.
It's very good. The filling is awesome the flavours will burst out the moment you have your first bite. Help yourself with some tissues üòéüòã hahaha !

2. Chicken cheese pasta.
Pasta and cheese is truely heaven. Nothing to mention about it. Superlike.

3. For the dessert we had my all time favourite
Chocolate avalanche.
The moment you see it u wanna dive into it.
Highly recommended.

My first try on italian food..bon appetit has always been there in my wishlist..>>location:near hazra axis bank...>>ambience:it was well decorated with hanging tables n swings.but the only drawback of this place is its not air conditioned which makes it very hot to sit and enjoy your food in a relaxed mood...>>serving time:can't remember the exact timing but it was not much....>>food:Though the quality was awesome but quantity wise it should have been more.we tried 3dishes there...‚óèspaghetti with meatball:it was total yum.quantity was enough only for 1 person.boiled spaghetti served with spicy juicy meatball on top of it....‚óèdouble mushroom pizza:may be we have ordered the wrong one..meatball pizza could have been a better choice.this totally disappointed us.the crust was chewy,hard n the toppings was also not at all tasty.pls don't order this item while visiting this place....‚óèchocolate avalanche:what else would i say about their signature dessert.brownie served with ice cream and chocolate sauce along with choco chips.it was fingerlicking good...would like to try more dishes second time...
===========================================
on my 2nd visit i hv ordered
>>chicken seekh onion pizza-it was good with ebough amount of cheese and seekh
>>spaghetti with meatball-described above
>>chocolate rum pudding-must try dessert.layers of chocolate..icecream...cashewnuts raisins almond
but now they charge tax üòëüòïüò°
still will recommend
but its too humid
best to visit in winter‚õÑ
============================================

It's a good place for hanging out. Good ambience, pocket friendly and good food. Their only problem is they have no air conditioning inside. And as the roof is made of glass it becomes unbearable during the scorching heat.
I love their quirky decoration, the swinging tables, low chairs and dining set ups, and also the swing located in a corner. We have had chicken meatball spaghetti, nachos with chicken, chicken sausage with jalapenos pizza with add on mushrooms. The pizza was a bit spicy but its tangy base made it tasteful. For desserts, we had the classic of Bon Appetit, the great Choco Avalanche. I think that the Choco Avalanche is too heavy. As we shared it among four, it was okay. The taste is like being next to heaven. The food is perfectly priced according to the taste and quality. Still I think they can look over the quantity served once more.
If you're looking for a hanging out point with your friends, come here. You can snuggle up easily and have your own time. You will love it. Happy Dining! :)

I for one love going to Bon Appetit. It's so well done up, but I only wish it was air conditioned. Everything is very affordable and pocket friendly and that is one of the main reasons why students from the vicinity come and chill here for a number of hours. The decor is rather original and very vibrant. If you are confused about what to try out, opt for the pasta, nachos or even the salad. The desserts are very filling too and not to  mention delicious.

Ordered- chicken salad and choco sundae
cost- 350 around
ambience- 6/10 ( Dude plz get some AC. The place was horribly hot ! and the steam from the kitchen was coming inside the sitting area)
taste- for the sundae i will give 9/10 and for the salad it will be 7/10. ( the salad was full of pickles which is not to be digested by those who hate spicy things)

In such a hot day, we went to the place to get some air. It was much hotter than the outside we realized later.

Most of the seats were booked by college students.
**We wanted to have choco fudge sundae but the man at the counter said that it is not available actually they said that dish was just a ¬†printing mistake on their menu card.
Self service is the only option here.
***I left my phone at the table while leaving! One of the boy at the counter called me to get my phone back! thanks to that guy!

It is my first time here as a solution to early evening appetite... I.e. 23/04/16..

Was taken here by a frnd... N it dint let me down with the cozy homly atmosphere... N interior decors..
Only concern is... Too small a plc to be too famous.. N no washroom.

We took cheese paratha n chocolate avalanche..
They were absolute treat to my taste buds (although paratha cant b considered as a French cuisine)...
Looked a bit over-priced.

N they seriously need an AC to be installed!
It was real hottttt inside !

But as far as food is concerned.. No complaints !

Bon Appetit is a favourite of many students . The interior is so cute and it's a good place to be in on a lazy day. The prices are student-friendly and the food is okay-ish if you ask me. Nothing too fancy.

My favourite has to be the lime soda and the green apple soda.

You can choose from a variety of food and beverages which is really good.

However , I visited Bon Appetit recently again and I kinda feel that the place has become very clumsy.

It lacks proper space to walk through.

Overall, it's a good and pocket-friendly cafe so definitely give it a try!

Except for the ALU paratha which had too much achar rest of the food was great. The mango shake was really full of mango and not ice...

Tucked away in the bylanes of Hazra this little cafe is a nice place to hang out with your friends and enjoy some delicious food at the same time. Their thin crust pizzas and rich chocolate desserts have drawn me back to the cafe twice. This place is pocket friendly which is an added advantage for students like me! 
I would, however, advise the management to change the music. Their music system stays tuned in to some FM radio station and it's not a nice experience to have loud bollywood music interrupt your conversations.
But do give this place a try :)

My friends took me to this place, they swear by the food there. It's a tiny caf√©, not air conditioned, unfortunately, and cramped for space. The food here is cheap enough, compared to the prices at other such caf√©s. We ordered spaghetti with chicken meatballs, two thin crust pizzas- chicken sausage jalape√±o and chilli chicken salami, and two desserts- chocolate explosion and apple pie. I really enjoyed the spaghetti with meatballs and the pizzas, especially the sausage one. The chocolate explosion was really good, however none of us liked the apple pie. I'll have to go back there once more for the chocolate avalanche and the blueberry cheesecake.

Bon appetite is a complete student hangout. The indoor decoration is very different and it immediately catches one's eye. The tables are replaced by broad wooden swings that hang from the cieling.
The food is quite good too, all d desserts being the highlights of this place. The chocolate avalanche is to die for. Other items that stand out are the nachos, the cheese paratha, and the red sauce pasta. 
The service is quite fast and the servers are very friendly too. There are many interesting books too kept in a bookshelf near the entrance which serves to kill time too.
The only complain I have about this place is that this is open air and is not air conditioned which makes it very difficult to sit during the summer and monsoon season.

Not sure if you can relate, but the ceiling does look like that of the Herbology department of Hogwarts. All they need is a Pomona Sprout.

Eating at Bon Appetite, reminded me of James Joyce‚Äô Araby, since the disillusionment of the boy going to the fair after much anticipation, was not any less than mine, after having had this place on my bucket list for ages. 

The Hawaiian salad was a bit salty for my taste, and the Nachos weren‚Äôt great either (after the brilliant ones I had at its sister concern, Pranah). 

The Chocolate Avalanche was chocolate sauce + brownie + ice-cream, in very good quantities making it VFM, but that apart, shouldn‚Äôt brownie, ice cream and chocolate sauce combo be just like this ? The brownie was pretty rich, but the chocolate sauce was ordinary, and nothing like my favorite-est chocolate sauce in the world from Corner House Bangalore, whose Death By Chocolate, I swear by. 

However, I quite liked the two drinks I ordered - an orange iced tea and a mango smoothie. 

The place is chilled out, and a good option to hang out, otherwise, though finding it might take a while through the by-lanes behind Paramount Hospital.

Learnt about this place a couple a years back. I usually opt for d sandwiches ( chicken grilled ,club mexicana or the chckn chettinad). The pastas r equally good especially spaghetti with meat balls . The prices are cheap and affordable. And they dont charge any VAT or services taxes. Bt since its non aircondtioned so this place is a bit uncomfortble during the summer months. But nonetheless its a nice place to hang around with with your friends and have some lovely food. PS: Dont Miss the Chocolate Avalanche ;). It's their speciality :)

Interiors have not changed a bit.
I ordered for a Plain Maggi, a Cheese Paratha and a Cold Coffee with Ice Cream. I know I missed out on the Chocolate Avalanche but that can be attacked on a later date. Maggi was not good at all, the Cheese Paratha was as amazing as always. Cold Coffee was good. 
There's scope for improvement.

It was long impending review on Bon Appetit!! even the name makes me hungry. Beautiful decor, enchanting portraits of Audrey Hepburn, Elvis Presley & Merlin Monroe, the very Italian style interior gives the feel. They serve amazing Italian, french & Mexican cuisines. I along with my two other nut-case buddies went to try some new kind of food instead we ended up ordering Chicken Pan cakes, Nachos salad, Chocolate fondue, Strawberry cheese cake, balck forest pudding, Mexican rice my goodness what not!!! we loved each and every items we ordered except the shredded chicken, it smelled a bit. Moderate pricing makes it affordable for students. What I personally didn't like is their no card acceptance, limited amount of Napkins, 1 set of salt and pepper, 1 set of sauce bottle. Rest I am yet to try their Chocolate Avalancha :D If you are reading my review then You Must go to this.... Hasta-la-vista!! PS: pictures are for my blog yet i shared here.

It's a teeny tiny place, but oh my god it's so good! I just loved the decor ‚ù§Ô∏è
We had the Black Forest shake, which was really really great. I was disappointed with the fresh lime soda that we'd ordered though ‚òπÔ∏è. We also ordered an omelette, I don't remember which but it was awesome! And all of this for just ‚Çπ250! Really great. üòÅ

For the age group of 15 through 25, Bon appetit is a definite hit for its tasty, reasonably priced food, the menu designed to cater to the palate of teens and college-goers looking for a filling meal without emptying their pockets completely. It's a campus hit.
The food is variable in quality, ranging from good one day to so-so the next. The interiors are cramped but have a funky, messy but charming feel about them.
The cheese paratha is quite the item, as are the thin crust pizzas(jalapeno and mushroom, yummy), the cheese and corn maggi, the chicken and cheese on toast, Mexican corn salad, or the pastas. You name it.
Breakfast, lunch, or just snacks, Bon Appetit has got your back.

Came here for an evening snack. Ordered a chocolate avalanche and spicy chicken. Spicy chicken wasnt spicy and inspite they said that it should be served cold, I would have preferred it hot. 
But chocolate avalanche!!! It proved why the place is worth a visit. For all chocolate lovers this platter - a mix of vanilla icecream, cocolate pastry, chocolate chips and sauce is worth a taste.
Ambience good. But location inside the lane is quite tricky to remember.

Very small place. Very small. Feels like a burrow. Mixed experiences here. The cold coffee and chocolate avalanche very great ( since they were, as such, not prepared in the caf√© itself ). The only thing we had that was made there was the spaghetti with chicken balls. And well, I'll just say that I found a strand of hair in my food. Maybe that was why it tasted a lot like the name of the dish literally sounds. Spaghetti with chicken .... Anyways. Only if you want desserts would I recommend this place.

An excellent cafe for youngsters. Decor is hip and cool. The swings and the board games just add more to the nonchalant and carefree theme of the restaurant. 
--------
We ordered a number of items from the menu and we were quite full before we had even completed half of our respective orders. We had ordered macaroni salad, black forest shake, midnight cookie shake, corn olive and capsicum pizza and chocolate avalanche.
-------
The quantity was upto the mark and the taste was just too good. The cheese the chocolate...everything was how I like it.
Do give this place a visit if you are looking for pocket friendly soul food. And if you have a sweet tooth there's nothing like their sinful desserts.

Good things comes in small packages !! A tiny restaurant yet soo much to offer! üòä  On a Monday afternoon celebrating my birthday i hopped into this oh-so-a tiny french house with checkered floor and swinging chairs and tables add ons with vines and old black and white pics on the walls, the whole ambience gives you a somewhat old school home feeling! 
  Food looks and definitely tastes good!! We ordered a pasta, a shake, a soda, a pizza !! All of them were smoking hot and were drooling in taste!!! The rates are very affordable i must say... way too pocket friendly!! 
Service is really fast and staffs were really polite! Whatever we order came to us within minutes... Oh btw... Its self service!!! 
Suggestions:: You people can increase the quantity in food!! Its a lil too less for a good appetite person!! 
Bonus:: They have stacked in books and really awesome games... for the people! Its totally awesome!!! üòé
SHOWSTOPPER: Chocolate Avalanch√® !! Its a total drooling one piece thing! A must try!!! 
 Bon Appetite is really worthy of its name! 
Do i need to say....? Of Course will visit it again!!! üòâ

Had a lovely experience at this place. The first thing to be complemented is the d√©cor, I like the imagination they put behind the decoration . I will say the place is small for a cafe and not ideal if you're going with a big group. That's the only drawback of the place. Ordered a Pasta penne with red & white sauce a mushroom & garlic pizza ( which was pleasantly delicious, but the size was small ) a sweet and salt lime soda and a ginger fizz. The pasta could've been a bit better if they added a bit more salt but then I guess that's how I would like it. We found a dead ant inside the fresh lime and they instantly changed it for us so I'll give them a 5 on service . it was a very trivial issue but they dealt with it with total professionalism .. Kudos to them for that. The staff was very friendly . seats could have been a bit more comfy ... They're a bit too small for my liking.

A bit crammed up for space and a tad warm thanks to the lack of air conditioning, this small cafe distanced at a few minutes walk from the Jatin Das Park metro stoppage is a delightful joint for college goers who do not care much for ambiance and are more interested in chatting for an hour or so while gorging on surprisingly tasty junk food. And cheap. Tasty and cheap, two words that aren't always synonymous and therein lies the strength of this place.
So bon appetit, I guess.

Last Saturday evening, my missus n I were feeling the hunger pangs and as a result we ended up at this place. 
Locating this place is a bit tricky, it won't help much even if I try to describe the exact route to this place. It is in the near vicinity of Hazra more.
The evening was sultry, walking upto this joint, we both could hear loud and joyous chorus of people inside. This place is a courtyard of a house converted to a cafe. 
Ambience was casual, loud and careless. The speakers of stereo blaring the numbers playing on the local FM , the chitter chatter, shouting and laughing of fellow "underaged" foodies above the top of their voices made the ambience annoying for "out of date" people like us.
Anyhow, it is a cafe and we are kolkatans, can't complain much on this front, loud being our birthright!!
The decoration is surely the plus point of this place. However, the "swing" tables, though quirky isn't comfortable to eat on. The space is cramped , vertically challenged chairs, tables and dice stools along with the rooftop hanging decoration , warm lights combined with chirpy and loud ambience, makes it a unique place to eat cum hang out!!
Ambience cum interiors: 2.5/5
The servers are attentive , quick and have decent knowledge about the dishes. I ordered a plate of spaghetti with meatballs , chettinad chicken grilled sandwich and a cold coffee for us , at the counter. The food arrived in no time.
Service: 3.5/5
 The spaghetti was served in half C looking dish. Comeon guys, what happened to classic old plates?!! Please serve the food in proper plates, especially the spaghetti. It's impossible to eat the spaghetti without spilling it on the table in that half C looking dish!
Spaghetti with meatballs: the food itself was okay. Though it looked a bit appalling with all that red tomato ish sauce on the top at first  but it tasted OK, in fact I must say the taste grew on me.  It was too much saucy on the top, but then mixing it with spaghetti and meatballs, it tasted fine in the end.
Rating: 3.5/5
Chettinad chicken sandwich: it tasted nice...spicy chettinad chicken in sandwich form was fine. Along with potato chips n red chilli sauce, I must say it was nice.
Rating: 3.5/5
Cold coffee: I don't drink coffee, it was for my missus and she didn't complain. So I guess it was fine too.
After all this 1st round, I ordered a plate of wai wai Thai curry.
Wai wai Thai curry: I shouldn't have ordered it. Personally I don't like coconut based dishes and forgot Thai curry does have a tinge of coconut flavour to it. Won't rate it.. As it was my mistake to order.
The quantity of all the dishes that we ordered , for people like me, who always pride in eating much, were less. However, considering the price tag, I think it's OK.
Overall, I surely am a bit disappointed about this place, I didn't expect a fine dinning, however, what I expected this place to be wasn't served at least  in the dishes. Or like my previous experiences, I didn't order their within speciality dishes.
Should I come again the next time? I think, I'll pass.
PS it'll cost 500bux for 2ppl.

Up until 1-2 years ago I'd have given this place a higher rating, but the quality of the place has dipped a bit recently. The food is still good, however it's gets too congested. Moreover the portions served seems to be reduced. The ambience is good, but it gets really hot here except for the few winter months, especially when it's crowded. I'd still recommend that one should go here (for the awesome chocolate avalanche alone), but best be avoided on a humid day.

Unlike others, I didn't face any difficulty in locating this caf√© at all. Start from Hazra 4 point crossing, take that road which leads you to ballygunge phari. Keep right while walking and this cafe is situated in the by lanes. Ask anyone,if u find it hard to find, Calcuttans are helpful,trust me.
Anyway, the place is small though the decor is very very impressive, No Air conditioning though.
Food is good. Very much pocket friendly. Cool place to hang out.
I don't review a eatery unless I go there at least twice or unless I have tasted quite a chunk of the menu. Same goes with this one. I have attached a few photos which I could find. Follow me for genuine reviews of places I've visited more than once. A lot of reviews coming up. Cheers!

Locating this place can be very difficult at first, but once you manage to zero in on this one, you'll get pocket friendly food,drinks and desserts. We had a kiwi drink,nachos and choco avalanche.The choco avalanche was blissful and for the price it is worth it.The nachos were well made.Overall a nice place for your evening Adda provided that you can locate this place.

Previously I have given 4.5.. This my favorite place for spending some time with my friends.
Good food.. Friendly staff... Very much pocket friendly..
I always order cold coffee and chocolate avalanche... Spaghetti with chicken meat balls is also very good..

But for the first time bon appetite disappointed me.
Last Saturday evening I was there..the cafe was packed up.... So it was a bit hot and humid... I can understand you can't expect AC with this much pocket friendly pricing... But during summer it will be a problem... Increase the number of fan or improve the ventilation system. Or else I think it will be a problem.

Coming to the food..
This time I tried midnight cookies shake,instead of cold coffee.. It was good... 4/5
We ordered corn capsicum olive pizza... Last time it was tasteless but this time it was good. 4/5
Now chocolate avalanche.... I don't what was wrong with the staff... They took more than 20min to serve one avalanche..and the size of the mud cake was too small... They tried to make up with giving extra amount of ice cream.. You should control your portion sizes.. If you are not having a product, then just tell the guests that you can't serve.. I think That will be better. 3.5/5

One of my favorite place in the city...  but now the outlet is disappointing me.
At first I gave it 4.5, then 3.5, now I'm giving 3.
Every time I used to order cold coffee, spaghetti with chicken meatballs, and chocolate avalanche. 
But this time me and my friends wanted to try something new...
Khush soda: tasteless and the soda was flat. 1/5
Green apple ice tea and passion fruit ice tea: these two were  average. But I will suggest to put some garnish. 3/5
Club sandwich: the bread tasted bitter as it was totally burnt..the filling was good but the bread was horrible. 1/5
Jalape√±o and cheese crepes: it was good. 4/5
Spaghetti with chicken meatballs: 4.5/5
Chocolate avalanche: excellent as always!! 5/5

#the new staffs are not efficient enough... They don't know anything about the dishes. Please give them proper training.

Great place to chill out, enjoy a pizza, or some mood lifting pancakes. The Nutella pancake is just so decadent and comforting that it is difficult to describe the feel good factor that it generates. The paranthas are soft and very filling. This is one place that I visit and pick take outs from with equal ease. ¬†Definitely see myself visiting again, and again.

Talking about the decor, I simply love it, from chairs to tables to the ceiling every thing is unique. Coming to the food, they serve a cheese parantha to die for. But sadly they don't accept cards!

Their chocolate avalanche tastes like heaven.. cheese paratha and the chicken cheese pancake are a must try for cheese lovers.
Tried the chicken corn and cheese crepe with tangy tomato sauce from the v-day special menu.it was good.
Best part, unlike a year or two ago, this place is now open on all days. Thumbs up for that!
Service and quality of food has deteriorated over the years though!
The chicken salami pizza was awful. The salami smelt horrible.

In simpler words, perfect place for a friends' hangout. Nice ambience(seats are very few though).Pocket friendly foods. We ordered chicken cheese pasta, chocolate shake and lemon honey tea.
I am giving that pasta a full 10 on 10. I can bet it tasted better than that from MacD or Dominos. Shake was as it should be. Tea was a bit on down side. Lemon part was too much and the serving should have a stirrer at least.
Overall experience: fantastic.
P.S.- i won't recommend a family visit. The place is for young people and thrives with them all the time. So, expect noise and a bit chaos there.

A nice cafe to go to with your friends for some snacks and gossip. Can get a bit too warm during summers though. Nice decor and ambience, but could have been bigger because it gets a bit congested during peak hours.
Food is nice, but slightly overpriced for certain items. Serving is usually swift, but dishes like pancakes take a little more time.

The best dishes from my experience would be:
Pancakes with chocolate sauce, chicken penne pasta/chicken spaghetti with cheese sauce (this sauce is heaven for cheese lovers), chocolate avalanche, chicken sheekh onion tomato pizza, cold coffee with ice cream.

Not very well located , however the ambiance is cozy and attractive. 3 of us went for a hangout. The Nachos we ordered were bit salty side , however the Cheese Paratha was amazing , so was the Avalanche. Does not pinch your pocket much. Crowd is mostly college goers. Coffee is average . However this zone is not bad . The only bad part is it closed by 9 PM. , which should have been extended by now , considering the crowd.

Located in Hazra,is a small cafe that has increasingly raised its standards.Try the chicken pasta to which I added mushroom toppings.It tastes really good.The chicken mexicana sandwich is heavenly..the choco avalanche is to die for!
However,small and compact it is and its hanging tables are an irritation.The chairs are too small.Otherwise,they serve good food!

One of the coolest places in Hazra where one can hop in to grab a bite. Totally Italian decor ...making the ambience look outdoor type! They offer one of the best authentic white sauce penne pastas of the town...pizza is equally good...specially that tangy meatball pizza ... Chocolate avalanche is one of the special items here...which looks and tastes amazing... Drinks are also good... And this quick bites place is quite pocket friendly...

Been goin to their salt lake outlet since college time...hazra outlet is newer place compared to that...their chocolate avalanche and chilly cheese sandwich are the top items for me....its very very very good...the sandwich is too cheesy.... And the avalanche is full of chocolate sauce, chocolate brownie, choco chips, choco sticks and ice cream, all this make the chocolate avalanche :)
Their menu is very promising....

I have been here many a times; droped in after a long time today and certainly the place has changed quiet a lot. The place was more well decoreded and more organised previously. Today i droped in to have little desert started with a chocolate avalanche which was just mind blowing like always; so was quiet happy to know that i appearence might have changed but the product is still the same :). 
All was good expect the ending dish - Blueberry Chese Cake, dnt wana explain the experience at all, just wana say me and my friend couldn't (didn't wana) finish a single slice of cake :/

I had visited the sector 1 outlet of bon appetit and came across this one in hazra. The place is smaller compared to the salt lake one with less sitting arrangements. But the food is way beyond awesome. We ordered mixed sauce pasta and cheese parantha. The pasta was yumm and the cheese parantha was good too but it happened to be quite oily. We had chocolate avalanche for dessert it is the best they can offer. Trust me. I will definitely visit the place again. :)

Cramped place. Interior decor could have been much better. The tables swings nd like why? It doesn't save space, why keep a table like that? Trying to be unique shouldn't mean it turns out useless n annoying. The other chairs r too small fr a grown up to sit comfortably. The food is good. The sandwitch, the choco avalanche n all tasted brilliant. Nice place for a hangout though it can get really loud.

Words fail me when I try to describe how amazing this place is. Pretty hard to find . Its located in one of those easy to miss lanes near Hazra crossing. I love the decor. The cute swing tables and the one swing chair. Self service mostly. The whip up your orders pretty fast. Drinks are usually a disaster here though. I love the nachos, mushroom on toast , the pastas and the salads. Decent quantity. Very reasonable price. And oh, the choco avalanche is to die for. A must try for everybody. The chocolate sauce dripping over the brownie and the vanilla icecream <3

The place is nicely decorated with the swing sets as tables, the place setting is a mess and so is the service.

Hi foodies!

So this has been a long time coming! I've been frequenting this place since my BSc First Year days at Asutosh and I've only got around to reviewing it in my Final Year! God I'll miss this place. :')

=Ambience=
This joint is featured in "Student Hangouts" and rightly so! Even in the summers when the lack of air-conditioning may bother you, the laid-back atmosphere makes up for it. For a person visiting the first time, the space may seem cramped, but when you visit with your friends, it hardly makes a difference. They play music (recent hits) through a small 2.1 speaker and that's sufficient to drown out the others' voices but not your friends'.¬†
The only irritation you'll feel sometimes are the awkward small cube chairs but other seating arrangements are available (do take dibs on the swinging seat)

=Food=
So we have tried lots of items here over the years. If you want any info on any specific item, do drop a comment on this review and I'll get back to you. :)
Today we ordered:
1) Chilli Garlic Wai Wai: Well, it tastes exactly like it sounds. It's a hit item cos they make it so well. It's spicy, but you'll keep wanting more.

2) Corn Cheese Maggi: So this is the alternative for all the folks who can't have spicy food. This has ample amounts of cheese.

3) Cheese Chicken Pasta: Chicken chunks could be increased a little, otherwise it's okay. However, they do NOT skimp on the cheese. :D Try it with the Mushroom add-on, tastes way better.

4) Chocolate Avalanche: So this is the fan-favourite. Gets scooped up within minutes of arriving on the table. I remember times when we ordered JUST this dessert and nothing else. I've no idea how they make it so well; yum alert.¬†

Cons:¬†
As a loyal customer who loves this place, I seldom find any faults here. But still a few bugs remain:
> Quantity has decreased in the two years I've been coming here. But considering their super-friendly prices, it CAN be ignored.
> Some orders take way too much time.
> Staff could be a little more informed and extrovert in suggesting new items.
> Could include more variety and new items on menu.

=Endnote=
Whether you're a student or not, you just cannot ignore this place, more so cos this place redefines value for money. Do drop in.

Literally, Bon App√©tit. ;)

A friend brought me here on a slow Tuesday evening. It's situated in a tiny little alley and it's fascinating how the entire look of the place changes once you bend along the road and chance upon this place. It's tiny, without any air conditioning, so it's a little harsh during Kolkata's summers. Nevertheless, the food takes away that snobbish complaint. No one is going to come to take your order. You must go to their counter, order your food and pay for it right then. We had the chicken penne pasta in tomato and cheese sauce, the chicken and cheese pancake and then the egg pizza which is a pleasant deviation from what pizza usually is. The pasta was absolutely mind blowing and the mixed sauce is better than the tomato or cheese sauce alone, I highly recommend it. The pancakes, however I found a little too cheesy. But the egg pizza was so refreshing! The base was an excellently made omelette, and the toppings of capsicum, tomato, onions and cheese were baked to perfection. You can't eat it like a normal pizza where you slice out the pieces and take it in your hand before devouring it. Instead, you have to use a knife and fork to cut the pieces up. Basically, you eat it like a normal omelette. For dessert, I ordered a plate of chocolate pancakes and my friend took the chocolate avalanche. Pancakes were perfect with the hot chocolate sauce and the whipped cream on the side but the star of the show was the avalanche. Dollops of vanilla ice cream on a piece of warm brownie which didn't have walnuts, much to my joy, immersed in chocolate sauce, topped with chocolate sauce, sprinkled with dark chocolate chips and garnished with wafer sticks. Absolutely sumptuous. I expected it to be too sweet for me to stand it, but it was just perfect. The bitter chocolate was actually authentic bitter chocolate, not the cheap rip-offs and the brownie was wondrous. We had over eaten by a gross margin and had to sit there for half an hour before we could stand on our feet. The ambience definitely helped. We were at a table which was swinging. It made me a little impatient how it would start swinging the minute i touched it! The place is quaintly decorated, however and it's very soothing. Service is a little slow but overall, we had a lovely experience.
If you visit, the chocolate avalanche is a must. It's a MUST.

We spent around 20 mins to find this place and after going there we grab a table and the place were kind of hangout zone of nearby colleges of Hazra. Sitting arrangements were little bit cozy. There were only 4 staff including cook.. We ordered Chicken pasta with mixed sauce, chocolate rum pudding and chicken Hawaiian salad. 
Hawaiian salad was just look like shawarma and taste like the same or even worse. Quantity is not sufficient for one people, on the plate they fullfill 60% of salad and 40% of potato chip. 
Mixed pasta was actually good for 1.5 people in terms of quantity, they put lot of tomato flavor on that dish and taste was very average. And last but not the least was the pudding, that was not a pudding, it was simply a mousse with flavor of rum.

Bon apetite is love. Located at the Hazra Road, this small but pretty cafe is a hub for the GenY. Good food and affordable price make this joint a must-go. The hanging chairs and beautiful ceiling are amongst the good things you will find here. If you are more into air conditioned joints, Bon Appetit may disappoint you but trust me when I say you'll love whatever they serve you. I love the green apple soda from here. The pizzas are beautiful too. My personal fav is the chicken sausage and jalapeno pizza. The pastas are gourmet stuff here. But what will win you is the famous chocolate avalanche which made Bon Appetit a prominent name in the priority list of foodies. Vanilla ice cream with brownie slices, choco sauce and loaded with choc chips make this dessert irrestible. This is what you must have when you hit the joint. Eat your heart out because everything is rightly priced. Hit the place if you have not yet. Worth of a 100 visits. :)

Ppl, my experience is still making me feel sick. Last time I went there was yesterday. Choco avanlanche being the best desert they make was so bad that I asked them to change and even the second one was so bad that all of us were feeling sick. And no one could touch. It wasn't just extremely sweet but really waste of money. The size of the cheese paratha has been reduced to a mini size and I don't know why. The place is degrading and I suggest don't waste ur money.

From the 4 point Hazra crossing, if you take the road towards Madox Square and while, on that road, you take a short detour on the right, you'll come across a garage cafe. Once you step into that cafe, you won't want to come out.
That was my 1st sensation when I visited Bon Apetit for the very 1st time. It's situated in the bylanes of Kolkata keeping it away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The 1st thing to fall in love with, in Bon Apetit is the seating arrangements. There are benches in the form of swings and a swing set itself, with artificial grape vine ceiling and the city radio playing it's wide assortment of songs.
Coming to the food, now, if you go over there expecting a full course meal, then fair warning, you will be disappointed. Bon apetit is famous for the various snack type Italian dishes it serves. Having said that, not all the food served over here is up to the mark. For instance, you're better off having a thin crust pizza from a Dominos or a Pizza Hut outlet rather than from here. However, a majority of the dishes served here are top notch. The pasta, the nachos, the chocolate avalanche are just a few of the most scrumptious food items served over here.
The staff is also very warm. Other than being a bit pricey, it is really difficult to point out a flaw to one of the best yet most unconventional cafes in Kolkata. If you ever find yourself in Hazra, then do visit this place. You won't be disappointed!! Happy Dining!

It's in a small place in the lanes Kolkata is so famous for. But the food is average. We had chicken coleslaw sandwich , mixed sauce pasta , Mexican salad and the mushroom and garlic pizza. The food was good , like homemade food only and you could say that you've had better. The Mexican salad was more like a Russian salad because it was bland while Mexican food is supposed to be spicy , the mixed sauce pasta could have been better. We tried the chocolate avalanche in the end which was basically brownies with ice cream and chocolate sauce. And a lot of chocolate chips. That was average tasting too. Like you would get in any other place. The HAZRA outlet has limited seating , and the ambience is also pretty okay.

Looking for a budget place for snacks or just to hang out? This should be your stop if you are in the neighborhood. 

A small and cozy place with a very basic menu in place but brilliant taste, whatsoever. The place is pretty famous among college students and you might have to wait for a bit to get a table. 

The only drawback of this place is that it's a very small place, not bigger than a room. 

A good place to visit anyway!

A small joint serving different sandwiches, salads, drinks nd desserts. Have visited a few times before also though reviewing now. Had ordered Cheese paratha, chicken dipped nuggets, chicken corn salad first. Best of them was cheese paratha hands down. Served hot with curd nd pickle, paratha with cheese inside tastes heavenly. The nuggets and the salad was good too. Then for deserts, had ordered Blueberry Cheese cake, Chocolate Avalanche and Chocolate Explosion. Man they were tasty. All these great food came at very low price so no worries about getting a hole in your pocket. They don't charge service tax too. A must visit. Thumbs up.

I used to visit Bon Appetit at least once every week, since it started. It was GREAT initially, but with time, they've increased the prices (doesn't matter because it's still cheap). What's disappointing is that they have reduced the quantity and they are compromising with the quality too. Sometimes the pasta is salt less or too salty (yes, they are going to replace it if you complain), the grilled chicken sandwich isn't amazing anymore, the cheese paratha is way too oily and so on. These days it remains crowded almost always. It'd be great if they could expand the place, try making the food better, like it used to be.

Really good for hanging out with friends. Although the caf√© is located in a garage so you should limit the number of people to a maximum of 4. Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken cheese pasta, Chicken spaghetti with meatballs, Chilli salami pizza, Chicken and jalapeno pizza, Chicken with olives and tomato pizza. The food was quite tasty especially the pizzas and the pasta. The sodas were a real disappointment. They really need to work on them! But the best dish by far was the dessert, the Chocolate Avalanche. Yum yum. I could totally eat 2-3 bowls of this fantabulous dessert. The price is extremely reasonable. This caf√© is a must-try! Ting! :-)

Visited this place on Ashtami. A bit small on the space section. But they make up for that in the decorum. Truly an indie joint like this can set the mood any day. The prices are very reasonable. The mocha coffee was yummilicious. The wai wai was fun. The pasta was oh so good. Sandwiches were okayish. More options needed in that front. Overall a place that deserves many many visits.

Very few joints succeed in creating the perfect student experience with all the requisites and the clich√©s, but the petit Bon Appetit is one of the winners. With its focus on d√©cor where glass garden restaurants meet casual student joints, the aesthetic is a big part of the place's appeal. As u enter through a narrow corridor, you pass the counter where you'll have to place ur order as well some books and magazines for perusal which was a very nice touch for a restaurant trying to be a hangout place. Even with its loud bollywood music, the ambience promises to be casual as well as romantic while the food is remarkably cheap without vat or service charges and not entirely unagreeable.   Maintaining the mood, the food is served a bit too casually and there are spice and sauce for the common use. But too much care on dining would have surely marred the joint's mood.

It's a small cozy joint in Hazra, to begin with once inside it can be a bit claustrophobic especially in a rush hour even though there is partially no roof. The food is decent can be better although it wasn't that bad especially the pizzas had a thin crust and were quite simple which I appreciate whereas the beverages have a room for improvement as they were not up to the mark. As far as the pricing goes considering the locality it's quite fair and sensible.  Overall a decent experience but as I said there is room for improvement.

This cafe is located in a lane near hazra crossing. This is a small place but very popular. But u need to find it with the help of google maps. We were already full so we ordered only the chocolate avalanche and it was delicious. Yummy. Service is prompt and the ambience is good too. Nice place for hangout wid frnds

i really dont know what gone wrong there.maybe i have ordered the wrong food. chicken meatball spagetti.god the meat balls are packed preserved ones and the sauce is from the readymade pastas packet. aftr that i have tried wai wai bhel which is quite good n then pizza wd double mushrom n ginger n again the bread is packeges preserved ones. so if anyone is going for adda then its a gud place in prime location but dont try this items if u r not found of packaged food.

This has been one of my all time favorite cafes.. Cute and cosy, and serves amazing Cheese Parathas, Pastas, Sandwiches, Pizzas and Wai wais.. Great option for catchingup and a quick bite. Yesterday visited this place after ages and felt so awesome. Had Chicken Penne Pasta in Mixed Tomato and Cheese Sauce with Green Tea. Pasta was really well-made and quite filling. The interiors is also very appealing and the place though lil old is very neat n well maintained. Must visit.

The interior design of this cafe was so refreshing that it made me visit the place twice within a short period . The first visit was a memorable one so it prompted me to visit the place on the very next month. The choco avalanche was the most awesome thing I had had in my recent times. I'd definitely recommend to visit the place. The foods are affordable and absolutely worth the price. The sitting arrangements are quite unique and pretty cool as well. :)

If a cute cafe experience is your idea of eating out then this is just the place ! The cafe is located within a kilometer of Jatin das park metro station , and is inside a quiet lane where you barely notice the entrance . Walking inside , towards your right , you find the open kitchen that gives you a hint of what to expect inside , with its pans lined with cheese and buckets of molten chocolate lying around . The interior of this cafe has a wall designed with pebbles and a ceiling decorated with creepers and hanging grapes ! The tables are small with tiny plastic  cubes as chairs , that give the place a cute and homely look . The menu here is interesting , especially desserts ; however , we were told that on that particular day , chicken products were out of stock , and we had to wait for an hour or more if we wanted them . So we opted for vegetarian options instead . The red sauce pasta tasted tangy and had a tomato base . The cheese and corn pita pocket tasted average , and the egg pita pocket tasted great, with a gooey cheesey center that might leave you with cheese on your dress ;) My ultimate fav here remains the blueberry cheesecake , which is served with a dash of blueberry sauce and lime and fresh cream  toppings. The place also has a swing seat and another swing table . So just walk in , and you'll be left happy and full in no time !

located off the hazra road in a bylane, it stands to surprise you. bon appetit has a very little place to offer you a seat so do not go with a large group of friends. Well it did not have A.C then,which may ¬†trouble you during a summer visit. seating arrangement and decor though quirky and innovative.. it didn't please me initially. Had ordered grilled chicken sandwich and chocolate avalanche. Both lived upto my expectation. ¬†chocolate avalanche is a must try from this cafe.@alka gupta

The penn√© with tomato cheese sauce was just perfect. The pizza could have been better, not a big fan of thin crust myself. Overall a nice experience.

This is a very cute cafe which is open air..with grape vines nd hanging lanterns. There are swings for tables and books nd board games to engross urself with while waiting for ur food. Basically its a nice place for hanging out and is a haven for cheese nd chocolate lovers. However as m NT a fan of cheese items..i chose chicken pasta in red sauce. Its really tasty nd spicy. Chocolate avalanche is a must try. Chocolate cake wid choco chips nd strawberry sticks and vanilla ice cream wid molten hot chocolate..its a sure delight to d taste buds!!

We had a pineapple smoothie..it was sweet ND sour..tasty!

Tried der sandwiches sum other day..paneer arabiatta and chettinad sandwiches were yummilitious!! The chicken Hawaiian salad is really tasty. The choco explosion wid ice cream is a wonderful desert alternative if one is tired of d avalanche! Looking forward to trying their Oder yummy sandwiches nd deserts.

The only negative pt is that there is no ac.

A quiet little joint on the roads of Hazra, the place is well designed and has a swing for a table which I found quite innovative but also quite useless as the drinks spill. It was interesting nonetheless.
Coming to the food.
The chicken coleslaw sandwich turned out to be pretty tasty. The chicken pasta, both white sauce and red sauce turned out to be a treat. The sauces were well done and there was ample asking if cheese and meat. The spaghetti with meatballs could do a bit of work. They could improve on that. The blue berry iced tea turned out to be a disaster.
The quantity is not that great but it isn't less either. It's filling, and if we consider the price, it is really very cheap.
It's a good place to hang out with friends, to grab a quick lunch or an evening snack.

Came to know about this place from a food blog ranking the best caf√©s but I was not so keen then. Afterwards I had been hearing gossips here and there regarding the food of this place and how it was quite a place to hangout. It was then when I looked up this caf√© on zomato and instantly was impressed by the menu - quite reasonable, which is quite efficient for college students to hangout frequently. We had been planning a visit to Bon Appetit since a few weeks actually but everytime it managed to get cancelled. But finally I had managed to fulfill this quest today itself and was very impressed. The place is unique with an ambience so casual yet elegent ; and the food is delicious, specially the collection of 'thin crust' pizzas they serve. Moreover the choco avalanche is just to die for - both by looks and taste! Quite a cool place hangout and is definitely worth a visit.

Came to know about this place last year when I came here along with friends. A place slightly difficult to find if you aren't accompanied by someone who is already acquainted with the place, once you find it, it's definitely worth it. The decor is on point and you are welcomed with Spongebob's goofy grin..Hepburn's graceful smile and so much more. Small place, well maintained. One wall, filled with mirrors on vintage frames..that is a pretty attractive to my eyes. The food is absolutely amazing, but somehow, I'll be biased towards the Salt-Lake branch when it comes to the taste. The chocolate avalanche is the most talked about treasure of this place and it indeed is worth all the praise. Even though the last time I visited, the quality seemed to have deteriorated slightly and the quantity has been lessened too. I didn't have the "choco-gasm", like I used to previously. The chocolate sauce was less in quantity and the brownies weren't as warm.
The pizzas are pretty great. Nachos, waiwai bhel, pasta in white sauce, Spaghetti with meatballs, cold coffee.. These are the best of what I have tried out here. Even though I am not a big fan of Spaghetti, the one i tried here is better than I have had in any other place.
The place could use a few more fans. The seat on the right hand corner when you enter the place can get really stuffy.
Overall a pretty place, will definitely keep visiting.

For me Bon Appetit is equal to Choco Avalanche. Nothing else. I could visit this place 'n'th times for a bowl of avalanche. 2 pieces of brownies with two scoop of vanilla ice creams and hot chocolate sauce and lots and lots of chocolate chips - nothing is more heavenly than this. If you haven't tried this yet, go and grab your bowl.

Though I liked their spaghetti with meatball and cheese paratha and thin curst pizzas, Choco-avalanche oveshadowed every other items.

Queer and quiet, Bon Appetit remains one of the best places to go on a date or to hangout with friends.
Swinging chairs...tables, translucent rooftop,  that looks damn awesome in the rains and a framed zomato user's choice certificate, this place got it all :D
Chocolate avalanche being the specialty
And pizzas being the downside.
The food here would appeal to a sweet tooth (like me)
But few can beat the ambience of this place.

This joint is located near to my college. The crowd is mostly the teens and I bet this hangout spot is one of the the favorites to most of the students of my college.
Ambiance - The space is not at all big and this is the major downfall of this joint. It is not air-conditioned too.

Food - Good as compared to the prices. The must try is their Chocolate Avalanche. This dessert will make you visit this joint many a times, henceforth. :)

Pocket-pinch - Reasonable.

This joint will not disappoint you. :)

Pocket friendly,charming and unusual these 3 basically sums up everything about Bon appetit.
Went there on a Saturday afternoon. The first thing I would like to emphasize that this is exactly how a cafe should be. Small place utilized intelligently. All decked up in bright colors with books neatly stacked on the shelves, the swinging jhula,the paintings---10/5 for ambiance. Only disappointing fact was that there's no ac which is a big letdown.
Food- we were 3 ppl and so ordered the following-
1 chicken nachos
1 cheese paratha
1 spaghetti with chicken meatballs
1 grilled chicken olive capsicum pizza
2 chocolate avalanche and extra chips and choco sticks.
Be warned. They serve huge quantities of food unlike a cafe where u pay lumb sumb amount for finger food. Another plus point. Every item appeared to be of unexpected quantity. Me= gluttony personified when it comes to food. Having said that it was very very surprising when we could not finish everything off. Nachos were tasty but contained way too much cheese. N me not being a fan of cheese did not like it much. My friend went gaga over cheese paratha and swore to come back for it. Pizza was of thin crust and contained lots of veggies as well as ample chunks of chicken. Spaghetti was very very tasty and spicy. Meatballs cooked to perfection in a spicy and tangy tomato curry. But I recommend not to order any items containing cheese if you r ordering cheese paratha. N somewhat too much of cheese with its sour taste may cause you to loose your appetite so that you end up finding not enough place left for the covetted chocolate avalanche. This was exactly what happened with us. I accept that i should not have ordered multiple items with cheese but on the contrary its expected that the waiter is going to help which he did not. .5 deducted.Now avalanche there's nothing to say about this one. Absolutely superb. Tasted even better with the extra chocolate chips and the sticks.

Altogether a nice experience which would have been even better had I made the right choices in ordering the dishes. Ultimate place for chatting with a bunch of friends without burning a hole in your pocket. Keep up the good worküòÄ

It is located at  Hazra. Opposite of bhojohari manna bengali cuisine restaurant.  Positive point is awesome preparation of different types of pasta, wai wai, shakes, sandwich etc. Ambience was also good with students zone or adda zone type atmosphere. Taste of cheese wai wai and chocolate rum pudding was delicious. Negative point is very little space and they don't have any debit or credit options only cash facility is there. But overall it's good hanging out place for lover and college and school students.

Service: The staff is really efficient and polite.

Food: I have had almost everything that they have on their menu and I have loved them all! Their beverages, pizzas, pasta, pita pockets, sandwiches , cheese parathas and desserts, they are all great!

Cost: The food is reasonably priced, justifying its popularity among the students!

Small wonder!
Finding this place was lyk finding a needle in a haystack. No doubt that asking the ppl nearby is a better option than using a map.
But once u enter u feel a nice vibe welcoming u. A little congested though, it has sm interesting decors. Swings used as tables are nowhere to b found except here. Had a fun tym playing with it üòú Another nice thing was that inspite of having no ACs and the weather being warm outside it was cool inside.
Coming to the food, we ordered Penne in tomato sauce, corn salsa stuffed pita and capsicum olive pizza. The pasta sauce was awesome. Pita had a generous filling of corn and tasted good. Pizza was average. In the end came the masterstroke- choco avalanche. Just beautiful to luk and hav. The six of us had to fight each other to get a bite of this delight!
All in all a nice satisfactory discovery for me. Would recommend them to improve service.

Location: left from Jatin das park crossing if coming from Exide . then take the 2nd right. Quite in the interiors. ------------------- Ambience: Not that great. No AC. Quite hot. I personally would not prefer having pasta while perspiring in this humidity. Else lovely interiors considering the space.-------





 FOOD: Ordered a red sauce pasta with extra Corn topping, Capsicum-Olive-Corn Pizza and their signature Chocolate Avalanche.--------

Pasta: Quite Good. I do not like their presentation. They just serve the dish raw. A bit of garnishing won't hurt. Taste was really good. Just the right amount of gravy and spice. ---------

Capsicum-Olive-Corn Pizza: BAD is the word. Very blunt and a flat taste. It actually had no taste at all. I seriously would not recommend the Pizza. Too much of Corn. Simply tasteless.

---------

Chocolate Avalanche: This is THEIR signature dessert. FABULOUS is the word. Lovely combination of hazelnut brownie with hot chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream and nuts and cho-cho. It actually leaves you foodgasming. #MustTry. 
-------

Overall: 3.2/5

Food: we ordered Pasta..Chicken and Cheese Pancake..veg pockets.. and Chocolate Avalanche

Now the pasta was..sort of..ok..but the chicken and cheese pancake was very tasty..but.what made me drool was Chocolate Avalanche..if you ever visit this restaurant do try it out.And ond more thing is..all the dishes are served with mayo and potato chips.yum!

Nice ambience, but they should remove a table or two to make the place breathe a little. We had ordered ginger fizz  and a sky blue coloured soft drink whose name i cannot recollect. It tasted like Benadryl syrup. :| Chicken sausage and jalapeno pizza was pretty tasty,especially the thin crust of the pizza. Well made. Then there was this wai wai bhel which was a waste of money because they simply serve u wai wai with some sweet and sour ingredients. The best part was the desert- chocolate avalanche which overshadowed all the disappointments. It was heavenly! :P <3

Cost effective and innovative dishes. Hazra outlet is a little cramped and sweaty because it is non-AC, but food is very tasty and quantity is just fine. Must try here is the Midnight Cookie exotic shake if you've got a sweet tooth. Special thumbs up to the Chocolate Avalanche, paradise for chocolate lovers.
Pita pockets and the Spaghetti with MeatBall are the top scorers on my savouries list!

The place is very small and ambience is more or less good. The foods are really very delicious specially their desserts. Only one thing I didn't like there that they does not provide any extra plate if wanted. If u eat something in share u have to eat from the same plate with different spoon. That's kind a little bit irritating. I am giving it a 4 star only because of the food cause the foods are really very very delicious

The first thing to notice about this place is its ambience. As food is concerned, I have to give it a 4.5 ‚ù§

I had been waiting for a place where I would get really nice pasta and voila, here it is.

The chicken pasta with tomato and cheese mix sauce is everything I had been waiting for. Spaghetti with chicken meatballs is a little heavy with a strong smell of the meat. Some may like it, some not. Cheese paratha is equally good. And at last the famous Chocolate Avalanche. It was heavenly. Just the right amount of chocolate and vanilla. A perfect balance. 

Lovely ambience, awesome food, cheap price. What else do we need?

Good food, goes easy on the pocket and if you're a college kid, looking for a nice place to take your date to, this is it. The place is quite well set up and has a good ambience, also a nice place to treat your friends to, a good place to hangout and have your long hours of meaningless "adda".

Visited the place today with my bestie. Gps helped me out to find the exact location. A great place to hangout with a bunch of friends(but not a very large group because it is a small cafe). Pocket-friendly too. No hidden taxes(a sigh of relief). No a.c. but the supplied fans are good enough. Very creative interiors...a cute and innovative cafe ..with hanging tables and chairs shaped like dice :D Had heard a lot about the chocolate avalanche...and yes it is delicious. Egg and cheese sandwich was okay. Surely visiting it again and trying out the pasta and shakes next time.

Bon Appetit's been an attraction since I saw the pictures and heard good reviews about it. A garage turned into a Petit breakfast and fingerfood outlet, the decor is cute and pretty. Don't however try it during hot humid weather since the place has no ac. So coming to the food, the menu is not extensive neither expensive. We had ordered for two breakfast platters, comprising omlette, bacon, sandwich, coffee and a pancake for Rs.250. The shock came with the way it was served. A platter is usually expected to be served when all its components are ready. Being served at bon appetit reminded me of my college canteen and all other canteens I've been to, where plates of food come thudding on your table. About the taste, it wasn't extraordinary. And the greatest turn off is the way it is served, half your appetite goes! Good for a hangout zone but not if you're in the mood for an elaborate breakfast.

We ordered one grilled chicken pizza,one chicken sausage pizza and a chocolate avalanche.... The avalanche was awesome to eat and the pizzas were also tasty... For information I must state that one pizza serves one. The price is also pocket friendly for a student. Overall it is a great place for foodies. 
P.S. they serve the original thin bread pizza like in Italy. Very few places in Kolkata serve such thin bread pizza

Bon appetite truly 'wishes you to enjoy your food' with your friends.. 

Location: A bit hard to locate as it is not on the main road. If you go from Tollygunge side, you have to take a right turn 
at Hazra more crossing. A walk for 2-3 mins with the help of google map and you are there.  

Ambiance: The first thing that will come to your sight is cutely and innovatively decorated place. The ceiling is done up with artificial grapevine. The hanging tables, the mirror, the chess board like floor, the cane swing chair ~ altogether make the ambiance a refreshing one. 4.5/5 

Service: You need to order your food at the order and cash counter and at the time of ordering, you need to pay the cash. 'No cards accepted' is a let down for the people who don't carry much money. We had to wait for 20 mins to have our orders on our table. They sure need to improve on service. 3/5 

Food: We had ordered for green mango soda, mango shake, grilled chicken cheese sandwich, grilled egg cheese sandwich and chocolate avalanche. 
The beverages were pretty average. The grilled sandwiches were good in taste. the filling with chicken/egg and cheese tasted perfect. They come with potato chips, which go well with the sandwiches. 
Undoubtedly, the Showstopper was Chocolate Avalanche. Portion were huge and it was so sinfully delicious that I can swear by the name of it. 4/5

Overall, a decent cafe and a perfect hangout spot to have chitchat with your friends over some relishing refreshment.

Bon appetit is a good and reasonable place to hang out with friends. The ambience is very soothing. The crepe there is amazing and the chocolate avalanche  is to die for . But recently they've been making it too sweet and the quality has deteriorated.
 
Recently I stopped by this place for some refreshments. And I had a horrible experience.
The staff was totally uncooperative. They refused to give us a 500 rupees change.

The chicken Pita pocket was okayish but the chicken filling came straightaway from the fridge. It was so cold and stale. 
The service was very poor. I hope bon appetit checks on their staff next time and serve us fresh food when I visit again.

I wanted to visit this cute joint ever since I saw pictures of this place on my friend's fb page. Finally got the chance today, I went there with my boyfriend Soham for our evening snacking!

Firstly the ambience:

It is an old garrage transformed into a cute and tiny decorated place near Hazra crossing. Once you walk through the corridor, you find yourself amidst grape vine ceiling, small lanterns hanging, swinging tables with tiny chairs or dice shaped stools and a bamboo swing in the corner. You might feel that you are suddenly transported in the awkwardly small world of liliputs! One suggestion to the staff- please try to keep the place neat and tidy..

Now for the service and food:

We ordered Chicken salami pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, lime soda & cold coffee with ice cream.

The service was quick but they got on my wrong foot in the very begining when they served us lime soda in a broken glass. Boy, was that messy. They cleaned it up and served us in a proper glass the second time. The serving bowls and plates are of poor quality and pretty dirty.

The grilled sandwich was yummy with the perfect amount of chicken and cheese oozing out of it. The cold coffee was okayish and bit too strong for my taste. The lime soda was fine and as it should be, (although served in a tiny glass).

But my experience at this joint got really bad when we were served the pizza. It was the worst kind I had anywhere in my life- I suggest my friends not to order this. We had to leave behind most of it.

Finally my judgement:

I wont prefer going there unless they improve their standards!

It's a small and a cozy place. A place where one can relax in evenings with a book and some pasta. Visited this place along with my friends last week and it was worth each and every penny, and each and every hardship which we had to face finding a cab to get to this place. 
Coming to the point we ordered cheese parathas, pasta, nachos and chocolate avalanche.. Cheese parathas were the best and the star for the evening. Chocolate avalanche was good but having stayed in Mumbai for 4 years, I have had better desserts.. Over all amazing evening and over stuffed stomachs..

The place is small..and since i visited it on a Sunday evening, i had to wait for 15mins to get a sit. But after i had the food, it came to my mind that its worth the wait. Mexican corn salad- tasted yummy (for non spice lovers). Spaghetti meat balls with cheese tomato sauce and extra mushroom was a hit. Spicy, not too much tangy and the mushroom had a smoky flavour to it. For a drink i had a kiwi shake which was very refreshing and for a dessert i had a chocolate brownie with ice cream. The amount which i mentioned serves for 2 easily with a pocket friendly price. Adding to that its a great hangout for friends.

Bon appetit is a common place for most college and school students. Amazing italian dishes are available here. Though its non-ac but still the environment is good enough. Food is awesome. Cheesy corn crepe is amazing. I bet your saliva wil drip when you see the cheese popping out of the crepe. All samdwiches are tasty and you can try them all. Beverages are nothing extra ordinary. Starting from omlet to pasta all tastes amazing. They keep special parthas at everyday menu. Pizzas are not so good. You should definitely try choco avalanche over here. 90% people go there just to have it. Hot brownie with chilled icecream, with generous amount of choco chips and choco sauce and choco sticks. Each and evedy food item is very heavy. If you take two dishes its sufficient for two people. Cost is genuine. 
The hazra outlet is way better than the salt lake outlet. 
Overall a good place to visit.

Have been there for quite a number of times for a great chit-chatting session with friends and for the food that they serve. I like the chicken coleslaw sandwich and the chili and chicken salami pizza that they serve.¬†
For people, who has a sweet tooth, they can take brownie to complete their meal.

This is a small place in hazra which serves really yum food. I visited this place with with my friend and i was impressed with the restaurant. 

 This place doesnt offer more than 7-8 tables but it has got a very good vibe to it. We orderd raw mango and green apple iced tea which was ok. Thn we tried the double mushroom pizza and one corn jalapeno sandwich and a grilled chicken sandwich. The pizza was just too good , very tasty . Now the veg sandwich was good but somehow i found that the chickn sandwich had a bit too much salt and mayo for my liking. Last we took the blueberry cheese cake which was amazing . Very soft very spongy and melt in the mouth consistency of the cake..
The  price is not much either.all of it cost around 500/- so quite pocket friendly.
The usp of this place is the young crowd. An ideal place to hangout with your buddies without burning a hole in your pocket. 
But had the interior been air conditioned or the fans a bit more strategically placed it would have been bettr because it was very hot inside. Overall nice place ..

It's a good place to hang out with friends. Very nicely decorated, even though there is a space limitation. The pasta is quite good, but I won't personally recommend the Tuna Chicken Salad, since too much olives often leaves behind a sour taste. The Chocolate Explosion is undoubtedly the most sought after dish of the place. Overall, easy on the pockets.

Went to this little cafe on an impromptu Chocolate odyssey. It's off the main road tucked in between non descript houses of the locality. So walking in, the open sky swing seats theme was a pleasant surprise. I have been to the sector 1 branch of theirs, but prefer this cozy nook any day. Settle down with a book from their shelves and tuck into their meatball pizza or spaghetti. The sauce is zingy, the Crust is baked to a perfection and compliments the spice soaked meat. Top it off with their signature chocolate avalanche. The wafers stand out like two soldiers guarding the hidden delight. The ice cream is chocolate and vanilla, standard stuff but the star is the chocolate brownie. You will finish off a bowl in no time. Bon appetit is ideal to satisfy your eating out craving especially if you are pressed for money.

The trademark of the restaurant  is however it's chocolate avalanche  and itz cheese paratha.. They are just deliciously delicious.. I hope I made my point clear... A must go kinda Cafe recommend  to students  mostly..

Didn't get the chance to try everything out yet. Small backyard with uncomfortable seating. Nicely decorated to maintain a snazzy look. The spaghetti with meatballs was simply delicious, though my friend complained about his being a little high on garlic.. I loved mine. We had a pizza which was cheezilicious .. My grand mistake was sharing the dessert , a chocolate avalanche , coz we fought till the last smudge of the chocolaty bliss was gone from the bowl.

Simply love coming back here to try out innovative foods that may seem common but we've never really gone ahead and tried it as an actual option! In my latest visit, the Choco Mint Shake was an instant hit with my taste buds.. Amazingly yummy! The Egg Hawaiian salad was delicious (you can opt for the chicken one too, am not such a big chicken fan, duh). Though I'd not prefer the overdose of jalape√±o.
The decor is great, suited perfectly for the college goers and the casual people who want to grab a bite. Perhaps that could tone down the blaring radio that keeps blabbering all the ads incessantly!

Situated very close to my place, bon appetit has truly justified it's name. I love the decor and ambience though its a very small place but that's insignificant when it comes to the food items it serves. Pasta,   sandwiches, paratha, salad.. You name it.. They'll cook for you... But If I have the best among the lot. It would be Choco Avalanche. PERIOD!!!!

Amazing place for good food.. like every one who reviewed, i would also recommend Choco avalanche to all.. cheese corn maggi was another fav but you need to wait till the ban on maggi is gone.. pasta is also worth trying! A very nice ambience but NO Air Conditioner.. a major set back as the place isn't very open and it gets suffocating after sometime.. friendly staff and food items are reasonably priced!

Its a nice hang-out eatery with friends in the lanes of Hazra. Best item: Choco Avalanche, its mind-blowing. Pastas and sandwiches are also fine in quality. Well decorated place. A serious negative of this place is: it lacks Air Conditioning. You might have to sweat a lot while eating the delicacies, as its a small place.

Well well well,one of the most pocket friendly cafes in South Kolkata for good quality food is Bon Appetite.Though its difficult to figure this place out in the very first go,being located in a secluded area but the hard work is worth the wait :P
The ambience is nice along with some quality food.My personal favourites are Nachos,Cheese Paratha,Pasta(the quality has degraded over some time though) and ofcourse the Chocolate Avalanche which is a must have and is a tongue and eye pleaser in all respects,the symbol of happiness actually :P.The drinks are satisfactory but the pan cakes are a bit undercooked and tender.The service is good and the staff is amiable.Overall,it is an amazing budget place but I would recommend people to visit it anytime apart from summers as it is not air conditioned and the scorching heat and humidity makes it uncomfortable due to its small seating capacity.

One of the most pocket friendly places to have food. The food variety is vast. And ambience is quite good given the small area of the dining place. Service is pretty good and the good quality is well maintained. The choco avalanche is pretty awesome though

The place is just perfect for a low budget friend's birthday bash.The ambience is good but not an aww-strucking or exciting one.
The place is never overcrowded,so u need not to burn out of hunger.
The cafe is not air conditioned but as it is located down a low lane,the atmosphere around is pleasant.
It is best known for its cheese paratha, mix sauce pasta and nachoes.it's chocolate avalanche,OMG,it makes count of your every single penny spent,a single bite will make you fall in love with it.
The place is also easy to reach as is only at a 7 minutes walking distance from the jatindas park metro station.
Pros-A place with delicious food and perfect for low budget treat.
Easy to reach.
And a perfect chocolate avalanche treat.
Cons-the place appears to be a bit messed up,cleanliness is not upto the mark..

Bon Appetit never ever disappoints me. Every time I have been there, I've tried something new from the menu (along with Choco Avalanche most of the time), and I enjoyed their preparations every time. I have been to all the three outlets (mostly Hazra as I stay there), have tried at least 1-2 items from each category except the pan cakes (will try that next time).
The seating arrangement is a bit small, but the food makes you forget everything.
My favorites are Nachos, Cheese Paratha, Pita pockets and of course Chocolate Avalanche, which is a masterpiece.

Bon Apetit is a small cafe near Hazra crossing.

I have been to this cafe several times. And likely to visit many more times. Although it does not have a huge seating capacity, and you have to wait to get a seat inside, the best thing about it is the food. Too good! Too awesome!

I've had Chocolate Shake, Chocolate Avalanche, Grilled Chicken Olive Capsicum Pizza, Chilli and Chicken Salami Pizza, Chicken Sausage Jalapeno Pizza.

The chocolate shake was nothing great. The pizzas were okay, keeping the price in mind, i don't complain. However, the salami pizza tasted bad, because the chicken tasted bad.¬†
I saved the best for the last- Choco Avalanche! It is really an avalanche of happiness. It tastes heavenly, and is one of the best desserts I've ever had.

After meeting up with a friend,we decided to have some continental.So we ended up going to Bon Appetit,on his suggestion.I instantly fell in love with the place.Small and cozy with lovely paintings and beautiful decor,this place gives off a warm vibe that will instantly make you feel like you found the perfect adda zone. We ordered Spaghetti with meatballs.As soon as it arrived we dug in and within seconds I heard an "yum" escape from my mouth.The spaghetti comes with a hint of butter and meatballs were perfectly cooked except for the gravy which had a hint of oregano,and since I don't like the flavor of it, I didn't like it much.
P.S : Its pocket friendly

It is a nice cozy place to hangout with friends. The ambiance is not so good but the interior decoration was amazing, the unique think of this cafe is there table which is a swing. But this cafe has no air conditioning so it is very hot inside. The staffs are nice and their behavior was good. The foods are average nothing special about that, but there dessert especially the choco avalanche was outstanding everyone should try this one. Overall it is a nice, very pocket friendly cafe.

An amazing budget place for good quality and tasty food. I was very disappointed with the place as it was infested with bees and flies and the inability of the management to control it. Not only does it hinder the ambience, it also possesses major health risks for which I gave it a point lesser than I intended to.

The Food was tantalizing though and very very cheap for the quality of food they delivered. The grilled chicken pizza was flavorful. The Nachos were crunchy and the bean saucy was tangy. The chocolate AVALANCHE WAS AMAZING. A must try for people with a sweet tooth. The spaghetti with meatballs was average and lacked a hint of sweetness which would have made it perfect.

A friend in college was morose and wanted chocolate to cheer herself up, so I took her up here. And in the process, the rest of the gang chipped in too, and we went to Bon Appetit. 
The decor is quirky but comfortable, peppy but had touches of good old times along the walls. My friend was in love with the kholna, and I was amused by the hangings from the green roof. The ac would be a nice touch, but its perfectly fine without it. 
We didn't waste any time and ordered on... The Wai Wai bhel fof a friend who wasn't too hungry, A chicken club sandwich for a particularly hungry friend, a chicken chettinad sandwich because I wanted to eat light but tasty, and an Avalanche for her, because she was actually lured by its picture to come here. 
It didn't take more than 20 minutes for the food to come, and the Wai Wai bhel was up first. It was tasty, according to my friend, and was generous too.
The chicken club sandwich was big enough to shut the hunger out of my otherwise bottomlessly hungry friend. It was generous with the chicken and egg, though I wish they used thousand island dressing instead of straight up mayo. Also, a generous hand on the veggies could've relieved the palate fatigue my friend was facing. 
My chettinad sandwich was perfect. Tangy tasty yum. Absolute winner there.
The avalanche was good enough to make my friend's morose mood go away, and with ample amount of cake, brownie, wafers and icecream with chocolate sauce, it was indulgence at its best. And we all fought for it, that good it was! 
Our price for all the hoggage and fun was no more than 500,  and the waiters let us stay and talk for a while before we left...such sweet people üòä 
A hidden wonder, that's what you are, Bon Appetit! ‚ù§

And have gone back again and again and again. :')

They have turned this little space inside a small lane into one quirky adda-zone with the swings,the dice chairs,swinging tables,etc which is commendable. 
I find this place beautiful in its own weird way. :)

Located inside a small lane , Bon appetit has some wonderful collections of caf√© cuisine . 
To be specific about the location , reach HAZRA (Jatin Das Park) , walk towards ballygunge phari , walk straight after another crossing (with auto stands) , then take a right turn through a narrow lane . The lane has a few workshops at the entrance . 


Ambience & decor is good , would be better if they add some music & AC :P 

Nevermind , the food is fantastic . 

On our platter , 
 Black Forest Exotic Shake : [ 4.5 / 5 ] a black forest cake over a chocolate milk shake tastes wow 

Pasta with white sauce :  [ 4/5 ] good 

Spicy Chicken Salad : [4.5/5 ] mouth watering , recommended ! 

**Chocolate Avalanche : [5/5] the rating speaks *_* 

A caf√© with awesome food to hang out & pocket friendly .

So finally, I get to cross this off my wishlist. Bon Appetit, you beauty! :D
The place might be a little tricky to find, so better use Google Maps. A small corridor directs us to the room which is OH- SO- MARVELOUSLY decorated. Grapevines and European- style chandeliers hang from the fake ceiling. The funky seating comprises of dice chairs, hanging tables (loved the concept ) and rope seats. We really, really wanted the rope seat but that was already occupied. So we settled down on one of the hanging tables instead.
Our order was a Chicken Cheese Spaghetti Pasta and a Double Mushroom Garlic Pizza. Later we added a Chocolate Avalanche to it. The service was a little slow. We noticed people who came after us being served before.
The Pasta was served first. I found it a teensy bit bland but nothing a sprinkle of salt and pepper couldn't manage. Also, I did always have a taste for food being on the spicier side so this could be excused. Putting that aside, loved it. Next came the pizza. A small, thin-crust pizza laden with cheese, mushrooms and having that distinct smell and taste of garlic that I love so much. Our meal ended with the avalanche. Beating two near-perfect dish, this was the dish of the day. A bowl of hot brownie, with chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, chocolate chips and chocolate sticks. Heaven in a bowl! I swear, had I not been in a public place, I would have started licking the bowl. It is very heavy though, and unless you're famished, I suggest you share it with another person.
Two cons of this place would be that it has no AC and no washroom. But other than that, I'm in love. :D

First things first the location. Why you turn a garage into a caf√©? Itna paisa bacha k kya karoge? That too in such a sleek lane. Then the ambience was really stuffy. An AC could have been life saver. The food was great no doubt and in a very reasonable price. Appreciate it.

Bon Apetit is a small cafe in one of the lanes in Hazra. The location is very confusing. Without google maps, finding this place would have been difficult. But the rest made me a fan of this place !

The ambience is unique and awesome. There is a small room with a limited seating capacity but it is wonderfully decorated. One wall is covered with stone pebbles, one wall has tiles of red and white with a blue border, one wall has pictures and mirrors, one wall has a set of lights, the floor is like a chessboard and the ceiling is in the form of a grapevine. The seating arrangement was even more amazing. Some chairs were less like chairs and more in the form of a ludo dice. We actually sat on chairs which had a hanging table. Really unique! A hangout doesn't require a better ambience than this.

We ordered for a blueberry cheesecake and a chocolate avalanche. The prices are extremely less and they dont charge any additional service tax. Our order was served in a few mins.

First came the cheese cake. Well a large sized cheesecake covered with blueberry sauce and topped with cream. Tasty it was ! Even i found it tastier than the cheesecake i had at chillis.

Next came the avalanche. The presentation itself made my friend mad as she is a chocolate lover. Actually its a brownie with chocolate sauce and nuts. Its taste was heavenly. I have not tasted such a yummy dessert ever. It was so very chocolaty !!

Since we were already full before coming to this cafe, so were unable to have the pizza here. Im coming here very soon to taste there savoury items and the chocolate avalanche is a must !! ;

Located in Hazra, Bon Appetit is a small cafe set up in a garage. It's a cutely decorated cafe that serves delicious food at reasonable prices. However, it gets a bit stuffy in there due to the lack of proper air conditioning.
Coming to the food....we had grilled chicken pizza with olives and capsicum and choco avalanche. The pizza did not live up to my expectations. It looked delicious but didn't taste so. But the choco avalanche was amazing.

Though I've visited the saltlake outlet of Bon Appetit innumerable times, this was my first visit to their hazra outlet. 
Bon Appetit, tucked into a small lane in Hazra Road, is not too easy to locate.
The hazra outlet like the saltlake one, is small and cozy. 
My friend and I ordered a portion of chicken pasta in mixed sauce and a portion of their best seller , chocolate avalanche.  
Their quick and efficient staff got us our food which tasted excellent ! The mixed sauce had a great tangy flavour while the chocolate avalanche was super chocolate and super duper tasty ^___^ 
Also their pocket friendly pricing is the reason why the place is always busy and will continue to do well. 
However there are a few drawbacks of this place :
1. No washroom 
2. No tissues on the table
3. A hell lot of mosquitoes 

However if u ignore the above points, then this place is an amazing hangout spot that serves serious good food at even better prices. A must visit :)

My second visit to this place and I can't wait to go to this place again..repeated spaghetti with meatballs and meatball pizza this time too and the craving is still there..amazing food at pocket friendly price. Tried egg crepe, the zesty chicken and tomato one, and wondered why did I not have it before. For beverages, I had strawberry iced tea which was pretty good and had a sip of ginger fizz soda which I liked surprisingly despite not being a soda fan..for the desserts, again the chocolate avalanche - the best ice cream and brownie I've had in Kolkata till date..next time I would like to try something new but along with this one! :D

I couldn't find any 'outstanding' thing about this cafe. The ambience is good. The foods are extremely ordinary. I tried cheese paratha, nachos with cheese and chocolate avalanche. I don't know why people keep on saying that these are their specialities. Both cheese paratha and nachos are so ordinary that one can even make it at home easily. But yes, I loved their chocolate avalanche. And yes of course, this place is pocket friendly, suitable for students like us. However the overall experience was not bad.

Place: hazra , 5 mint walking 4m JD park metro st. Its lil hard to tell exact location kindly keep ur smart phn with u n on ur gps. Coz this place is really twisted old kolkata typ.
Parking : yes available
Service : 2.5/ 5
Food Taste : 4/5
Price : very pocket friendly

A cute little cafe, reasonably priced food, perfect for hangouts with friends,specially when your budget is not very high. The food is above average, but that's quite alright considering the low prices. But the service is very slow. I had to wait for about 20minutes for the paneer arabitta sandwich and 10 to 15mint more for chicken sandwich. The ambience is awesome but nonAC . Overall, its an ideal place for adda and dates for the youngsters. Do try lemon honey tea i loved it there. Its a self service cafe.
1 thing i personally didn't like is no washroom. Its a very bad thing for a cafe or for any hangout place like this. There was no tissues on the table u hv to go to counter n get it . No water on table , thts also self service.
Food is awsm but it is nt at all a ideal cafe. For tym pass n siting gossiping is fun here. On winter n rainy day only .

First of all you need either gps or uber to find this cafe. Lol l if u arent a regular visitor. Heard a lot about it so i made my first visit here today. It was not hard for me to find out and it didnt turn my expectations down. You cant expect a high end cafe restro type, but this is a college hangout place type. Small place. But very cleverly decorated to accommodate 8 tables. Tables and interior are nicely decorated. It doesn't make you feel like you are in a clumsy place. But no washroom. Thats a big turn down factor for it. No tissues in the table (you have to ask for it). Food range is wide and amazing and taste is mind blowing. Superb sandwiches. Rates are not too pocket pinching. Overall a nice timepass place to hangout. Nice foods and teas.

This is a tiny place located in one of the alleys of Hazra, it's a bit difficult to find but thanks to GPS, we made it. It is quite homey and rather charming but if you are expecting something huge and fancy, this is not it. The whole decor with its little chairs n tables and a large swing makes it a very beautiful place..¬†
The food here is affordable and they have an assortment of dishes in good proportions. We had ordered nachos, club sandwich, pasta and the choco avalanche...all of them were yummy. The pasta seemed totally home-made and the chocolate avalanche was something else...delicious,dripping with chocolate.¬†
Overall,it's a lovely, cozy place for a casual hangouts for teens and college-goers but this isn't a place for large gatherings, I'm afraid. The service is a bit slow but one should definitely check out this place especially if he/she is on a tight budget. Oh and the AC is also a factor but since we visited during the winter, it didn't bother me much at that time.

Place is too small for even a medium size gathering. Decor is good but it starts feeling like I am sitting in a small room with a bunch of people. Its a bit hard to locate this place & had to rely on my trusty gps to reach here. I am not rating it 2.5 becuse of its food, which was the only thing I liked here.

Decided to head here with a few friends. 
Since we've head alot about. 
Lets get the point 
The negative points 
Poor Service ( Very Slow )
The decor of the place isn't to well balanced with the theme. 
Serving Plates and cups (plastic cups and plates )
Poor table arrangement (Crammed
 up) 

Positive points 
The food is good. 
Love the dessert Chocolate Avalanche. 
Pizzas are well made along with pasta .

Overall place is average and cheap.

This small little eating joint is a bit hard to locate as it is situated in an alley off the main road, but gps served us just fine and we found it.
There is no ac and that is how they serve food at quite economic rates. 
The chicken pasta was excellent. 
You will have an option of white and red sauce.
I prefered the white sauce. :)
 The mint soda tasted like a cough syrup according to my friend I tagged along with me and I totally second her.
The chocolate avalanche as everyone suggested already was a blessing covered in chocolate. 
Must visit for good food priced reasonably.

Located just inside an alley near the busy Hazra crossing, Bon Appetit is a don't-miss-out restaurant. Friendly to your pocket and heavenly to your taste buds, what more anyone needs. Awesome ambiance. Ordered cheese paratha, chocolate avalanche and mango smoothie. They should seriously change the name of cheese paratha to cheese burst paratha. It tastes so good that at one point of time you would feel guilty of having cheese. And chocolate avalanche was just a treat to have. This is something which can't be described, but only be experienced. Won't think twice to come back here.

After planning for a looooong time, I finally ended up here today with my friends! It's a perfect hangout joint.. I'd give it a 10/10 on ambiance. The decor, very elegantly done and has a ethnic-chic appeal.¬†
Coming to the food, we ordered Nachos with Cheese dip and Chicken, which was quite crunchy and tangy. This was followed by Penne Chicken with Tomato Cheese sauce, which was creamy and well cooked! Will give it a thumps up. The Chili and Chicken Salami Pizza was cheesy :P good, but nothing exquisite. The big let down was the Lemon Iced Tea. And then came the Chocolate Avalanche...it was a bowl of chocolaty goodness!¬†
The ambiance and food are in favour of the joint, but the big let-down is absence of Restrooms and on a very hot afternoon, AC!¬†
Still the cute little space manages a place in your heart, and it is pocket friendly! Overall, #ThumpsUp #WillVisitAgain #LovedIt!

This is one of my favourite joints.. So when one of my friends came here from mumbai i had to take him here cause for me its a house of amazing things.. But sadly i was disappointed.. I being a fan of nachos had ordered nachos but it was nothing out of blue.. Just a normal plate of cornitos with salsa n cheese dip... I would give it a 2 out of 5.. Later we ordered mix sauce pasta which was my personal fav of bon app.. But again it was disappointing the flavour was very bland.. Giving it 1 out of 5..Really needs improvement as the other branch pasta is amazing.. Last was the mouth matering chocolate avalanche.. Which is basically the signature dish of bon appetite.. It is brownies with chocolate sauce, choco chips, chocolate sticks and ice cream.. Chocolate lovers its a heaven for all...  Here it gets 4.5 out of 5 ..
One thing that i would like to praise is their customer service.. We had given the money for chocolate avalanche but forgot to take the change and we had also left our camera bag there.. When i went back to get the camera bag the waiter itself returned the change without being asked... Really impressed by their service.. Which makes them deserving of the 3.5 out of 5 .. Overall they should improve the other dishes so that the rating goes up..

Finding the place for the firs time can be a little difficult..But went there many times... ¬†The best thing about Bon Appetite is that it is pocket friendly.. best for college students =)¬†
the place is small but The interiors are really nice.. ¬†It's a good place for hanging out... But due to shortage of space,sometimes hard to get a table... ¬†this place is non-air conditioned¬†so its not ideal for summer.. When it comes to food go for Choco Avalanche..Its one of the best dessert ¬†iv eva ate.. after this dessert i will recommend Cheese Chicken Pancake.. Its just awesome, specially for Cheese lovers, ¬† Pizzas are worth trying u can also try spaghettis with meat balls..Overall a good place to chill at a low budget. and pure bliss to the food lovers .! If u r thinking about giving treat to ur friends GO FOR THIS CAFE ! =D

Last afternoon, I went there with my college friends. I have been there numerous times, probably five or six times. My friends had heard lots of praises about the place from me, so they wanted to visit this place badly and I volunteered to be the guide for the day. 

We reached there around 3pm, we made ourselves comfortable in one corner. We ordered a chicken grilled sandwich, a chicken sausage jellapeno pizza and four chocolate avalanches. Chocolate avalanche is the main attraction here at Bon Appetit. Bon Appetit is very popular among students, the food here is very cheap as well as tasty. The small and cozy interiors are very well decorated with photographs and lights. 

It is a perfect place for you if you are up for an adda with your friends. These small joints are giving the coffee houses a run for their money. The food here is excellent, specially the chocolate avalanche. The combination of brownie, vanilla ice cream, choco chips and choco sticks - pure bliss ! 

Finally, I want to thank one of my friends who took me there for the first time, an year ago. Since then I have been there several times and each and everytime I had ordered chocolate avalanche. Now you know how good it is ? Please give it  a try. 

Positives - cheap and affordable, tasty food
Negatives - no AC, less number of tables and so you may have to wait outside

Food - 4/5
Ambience - 3/5
Service - 3/5

Well French people have always been my favorite. They eat, work, and eat. They talk food, sleep food, dream food.
And now Bon Appetit. A small French corner amidst the bustling city. This really small place has 6-7 tables, one swing and an awesome ambience.
The red and yellow with matte black table and chairs with grape-vine hanging on the ceiling really takes you away somewhere in Paris.
My friend and I frequently visit this French corner for some really scrumptious food.
Chocolate Avalanche, thin crust pizza with meatballs, spaghetti with meatballs, Tuna Sandwich and pancakes with Hot Chocolate Sauce.
The only difficulty in a hot city like Kolkata, is that this place lacks Air conditioning. So it gets really uncomfortable in Summer.

Recently, the Food has been a disaster. Few days ago i had ordered a white sauce spaghetti, it turned out to be really sticky and was tasteless.
The prices have increased recently,  even though the quality has degraded.
If anyone wants to spend some tym over shakes - Bon appetit - GOOD
But, over snacks - (Please try the roadside dhabas).

On a hot summer afternoon, while I was already sure to visit Hatari and indulge in the chinese delicacy, suddenly I changed my mind and wanted to visit Bon Apepetit for a change. I have seen the good ratings of this place in Zomato, and was quite curious to try it. Located at a by-lane beside Paramount Nursing Home (2 mins from Hazra crossing), the outside of the place is decorated with hanging flower pots.. and it looks nice. The interiors are really cool, with hanging tables, obsolete dice shaped tools, and some paintings. The only thing I felt lacking is an AC, specially in a hot summery Kolkata you surely need it. I ordered for mango smoothie, Spaghetti with meat balls, and black forest pudding. All of them were bingo on the taste! The water happens to be a self service from a water jar inside. Waiters do not involve in the scene much, and you can chat and relax enjoying the food for some good time. Light on the pocket, and No Tax. Would like to revisit again and try more dishes.

Have been to this place several times. It's a favourite for students. The place is quite small but very pretty. it has swinging tables and chairs which look like dices. It also has one swinging chair. The only con being no air conditioning :(. Now coming to the food part. The food is simply top-notch. The non-veg pizzas are pretty good. The pastas are delicious and the quantity is  sufficient for two people. The cheese parathas which they serve with curd is my personal favourite. The nachos are also decent. They have a good range of desserts as well. chocolate avalanche which is a must for all chocolate lovers can be a delight when those choco cravings strike one.I did not really like the Apple pie though from the dessert section though. The tiramisu is also nice. This place is a great hangout.

It feels like a long awaited task to review one of my favorite and most-visited cafes in the city.
After wonderful experiences at the Salt Lake outlet, I began to visit this outlet, mostly because of its distance from college.

‚òÖ LOCATION : It may be a little tricky : get down at Hazra crossing, take the road going towards Ballygunge (beside Bata), and then the second turn to the right. A little lane leads to the cafe. A better idea would be to follow Google Maps.

‚òÖ AMBIANCE : The little corridor leads to a square room with little tables hung from the ceiling through chains and cute little seats which are in the form of dice. At a corner hangs a alluring hanging chair. From the ceiling hangs many lights and fancy items, with photographs and mirrors along the walls. The tables cannot accommodate more than 4-5 people, so it is better to avoid visiting in large groups.

Although there is no air-conditioning facility, the fans make the place comfortable enough. Well, this is valid as long as there is electricity - I wish they install an inverter soon!

‚òÖ FOOD : Almost everything here is worth giving a try, starting from the Wai Wai Bhel to the lip smacking Cheese Paratha, from their pizzas and sandwiches to the tastebud-arousing overdose of chocolate in Chocolate Avalanche and Brownie + Icecream. In my previous visit, I went for the Spaghetti with Chicken Meatballs based on the acclaim it received at Zomato. It was filling and tasted good, albeit being too tangy for my liking.
Awesome food. Quick service.

‚òÖ PRICES : Extremely pocketfriendly prices with sufficient quantities make this a favorite haunt for young people. A great meal for two should be within ‚Çπ350.

Happy eating! :)

The place is very uncomfortable... With swings for tables and dices for chairs .. Some chairs reminded me of the upper infant chairs at my school.
There is no ac. And since kolkata isnt blessed with amazing weather it can get very uncomfortable. Moreover the flies can be a menance

The food is nice . But not all the stuff taste good . The chocolate avalanche which we ordered made me hate chocolate for a week.. There was just too much chocolate and no refinement.. The pizza was too tangy for my taste.. The crepe was ok cause i have had better ... The black forest sundae drink was good. But the plain sponge cake that they gave on top seemed really sweet to look but difficult to have.

The best thing about Bon Appetit is that it is pocket friendly, you do not have to think twice before visiting.
With its varieties of beverages, appetizers and mains Bon will spoil you for choices and will leave you planning your next visit. The place is small but you'd probably find a place most of the times.

Recommended: Spaghetti with meatballs if you're lunching . The chocolate avalanche is a MUST for the sweet tooths out there.
Thumbs up: The decor and comfortable cafe atmosphere will have you hooked. Good place to go if you're on a casual date or taking your friend out for a treat.

P.S. : There's a corner swing seat and I'm pretty sure everybody who visits secretly feels bad when that place is already occupied.

Its a small place so u might have to wait in line to get in..u can pick up a magazine or a one of the books kept there while u eat or wait...service isn't too slow. We had veg pasta with mixed sauce and spaghetti with meatballs.both were tasty..the must have dish here is definitely the chocolate avalanche...its just a bowl of rich chocolate and ice cream filled goodness in ur mouth...it usually takes two to finish one bowl. The pizzas and cheese paratha here is brilliant too. The paratha is served with curd and pickled onions and is enough for 2-3 people. The blueberry cheesecake is also good here :)

I visited this place on the back of a recommendation by a fellow foodie and for which I am thankful to her. Located in the groundfloor of an apartment building in one of the streets near Hazra , this place gets you by surprise. Looks like any other restaurant from the outside, this eatery has a niche of its own. Small ( read extra small) chairs and swing tables, this place is full of it. The ceiling has a very vineyard kind of decorations , with grapes and vines hanging down from the ceiling. Well thats all for the decorations and stuff. Now to the food. Penne Pasta , Chicken Nachos, Spaghetti with meat balls are the absolute standouts of the menu. However Chicken nachos is in a whole different league. Olives, Jalape√±os, mayonnaise, pasta sauce, chicken and cheese sauce makes it an absolute crowd favourite. In deserts Chocolate avalanche is the start and end of it. A bowl full of chocolate sauce with scoops of vanilla icecream, a brownie and whole lots of chocolate chips makes it a chocolate paradise. The muffins especially the blue berry muffins are really good. A must visit for all food lovers.
Note for the tall people : though the sitting makes it really difficult for you guys , the food can more than make uo for it.

The food is above average, but that's quite alright considering the low prices. But the service is very slow. I had to wait for about 20minutes for the  Mushroom pizza and 20 more for the Chocolate Avalanche. The ambience is awesome. Overall, its an ideal place for adda and dates for the youngsters.

This quaint little cafe round the corner really surprised us today... Great decor, even better food... What more can a girl want? 

The spaghetti with meatballs was a tangy, spicy treat. The chicken-stuffed pita pockets were no less either. But the hero of the day was pancakes with cheese and chicken. I swear I would have licked the delicious sauce off the plate if I had been alone!

The chocolate avalanche deserves a special mention for being so... Well... Should I say sinful? Please don't miss it... That's all I can suggest.

The ambience is lovely, with the swing chairs, mirrored walls and grapevine-adorned ceilings. Amazing that these guys managed to do so much in such little space.  Good job!!

In short, highly recommended for long chat sessions with friends :)

My, overexcited roommate took me there, I seriously didn't expect it to be in such small place. I had no clue, that those dark and lonely lanes would open up into something so majestically cute and adorable. Yeah,when I entered into that house,those coffee mugs literally gave a glimpse of its interior, the interior however is very small, and the place is kinda packed, but due to fast delivery people had there stuffs early and were leaving, so didn't have to wait ( as it was Sunday evening, so can't crib even) , service is excellent. The food justified the rates, I liked the cheese corn toast,chocolate avalanche, however the nachos disappointed me, alot!  It was served cold, I expected it to served with cheese not cream.... May be it's supposed to served like that, but seriously that didn't taste good at all. So had to leave it like that, however the place didn't burn hole in my pocket, and we were totally full so can't crib even!  ;-)   awesome interiors, good food, nice ambience, nice utilisation of place!  I am gonna be a frequent customer there now!  ;-) :-D

After hearing a lot of good things about Bon apetite, I finally ended up visiting the Hazra outlet on a rainy Sunday afternoon. I wouldn't recommend this place for hot, sultry afternoons as there is no A.C. The interior is small with cramped seating arrangement for about 20 heads and uniquely designed with swings as tables!
The chicken coleslaw sandwich was rather ordinary especially because it came with stale chips. The chicken tangy meat pizza was wonderful and a great deal of you're a fan of the thin crust. At 130 bucks for an 8" pizza, it's quite a steal. However, the dessert really disappointed me. I had ordered blueberry cheesecake because chocolate is too mainstream and didn't like the taste one bit. It had a weird salty taste and didn't seem fresh. I understand that cheesecakes aren't exactly sweet, but come on! There are better ways to make it. Especially after the wonderful chocolate avalanche I had at the Salt Lake outlet, it was a real let down.
If you're in the neighbourhood and need a place to hang out with friends, this would be a perfect place. Do visit if only for the choco avalanche and the pizza!

One of my all time favourite for pocket friendly good food. Apart from the food what really takes me back to this place is the decor. Very diffrently done(not for the ones who cannot survive without ACs) as this place is non-ac. However, that doesn't stop people from visiting this place as it is always crowded with college students. Lip-smacking pasta in reasonable price. Chocolate avalanche is to die for. Though it's a lil' difficult here on a hot sultry afternoon, but, a really nice place to chill!¬†
Where is it located?: Exactly the lane opposite to Sujata Sadan at Hazra.

I along with my friends went there a day back...the place is a small one though we liked the decor. We had ordered cold coffee with ice cream, Green apple soda,Grilled chicken sandwich, Hawaiian chickten salad, cheese parathe and Mexican corn salad..We really did like the food. But one negative thing is it doesn't have any washroom..and no air conditioner which is a bit problematic in this humid weather of Kolkata.
Look into the matter..otherwise good.keep up the good work.

Great place, Great food, Great ambiance, what else could you ask for and more over it is extremely reasonable. I really love the decor of this place, but the place is rather small. Menu has a lot of variety to it from coolers to desserts with decent amount of options to choose from.

We ordered a chicken jalapeno pizza and pasta in white sauce. Both were equally delicious. I especially in love with the pizza of this place. Flavor full and fresh.

I have to say its a must try restaurant for couples and friends(college or school going).
I personally want to try every single dish from this apart from maggi/wai wai. The dessert especially the choco avalanche looks absolutely mouth watering.

This place receives a wholehearted recommendation from my side.

Yes, they do mark this place in the "pocket friendly" section of Zomato and it surely is. Great place for hanging out with food and drinks that are pretty much reasonable.

We had a chicken chilli pizza, chicken mexicana sandwich and a chicken pasta with mushrooms and I couldn't have a single complaint with any of the three. We even had a couple of flavoured ice teas and they weren't bad as well.

A thumps up to this place as well.

The entrance focuses on the self-service
counter. The swing tables hanging from metal chains, framed mirror reflections on the wall, light installations and faux grape
vines hanging from the wooden beamed ceiling enhances the ambience. Friendly, warm and courteous service and cosy setting sets the mood. The menu looks great for a college rendezvous or a cosy date. Hot and cold beverages, sodas and shakes and exotic shakes like Black Forest. You could try the Chicken Club Sandwich,
Mushroom on Toast, Tomato Cheese Chicken Pasta, Corn Salsa Pita Pocket. For dessert, the Black Forest Pudding, Tiramisu, house-speciality Chocolate Avalanche, Chocolate Fondue or the Honey Butter Pancakes are there. Enjoy!?

The Pros :
* Nice young and upbeat decor
* Adequate Snack-time menu to spend those addas with friends
* Pretty cheap pricing
* The staff are friendly

The Cons :
* Space isn't ample, sometimes looks cluttered
* It's partially open air, thus the lack of an AC on warm days is felt
* Self service , which is not really a con since i have seen waiters toppling over tables cramped together in too small a space, trying to clear them in an empty restaurant
* Water has to be drunk in minuscule thin plastic glasses from a water dispenser kept at the entrance

This is a good place to hang out for students low on a budget.

Food quality is decent. Tried nachos, midnight cookie and cold coffee with ice cream. Average taste and quality.

Service is decent as well. They didn't take much time to bring the food and they were also quick to respond to customers' requests.

With beautiful interiors the ambience of the place is very good. It has a perfect caf√© culture where you can spend hours. There is also a small shelf placed near the entrance from where you can pick a book and spend your evening reading!

What didn't work for me is the fact that the place is too crunched. It is practically an average sized room with tables and chairs placed strategically. But it becomes difficult to settle down. Secondly, it has no AC! A small place with no AC doesn't work in Calcutta during summer. It was uncomfortable in that regard.

I liked the ambience but it is recommended only on a winter day.

It was one odd hot sultry afternoon and iced tea was just needed. Being at hazra, my friend and I decided to try out this place for the first time. I turned on my Google Map and went round and around, not being able to locate it. I then called up the cafe and they directed me. We were thirsty and somehow managed to find the place. Its located in the lane beside paramount nursing home and quite a task to locate for first timers.
Upon entering the cafe, i instantly loved the look and feel of the place. It had less seating arrangements but so cozy and so homely. We first ordered green apple iced tea and lime soda. Our order came in less than 10minutes. As we sat sipping our drinks, we realised how hungry we were and decided to go for food. I wanted to eat everything on the menu. LOL! After much dilemmas, we decided to order chicken nachos with cheese dip and salsa and chicken chettinad sandwich. They didnt have chettined, so we settled for grilled chicken sandwich. We waited 15 minutes and then came our nachos. We were so hungry, we ordered a egg and cheese spanish omlette. The place started to fill up and the guy forgot our sandwich it seemed. Customers came and went, we had to wait. We reminded once and he seemed to remember it suddenly. We had to remind again and then came our sandwich. After 10minutes came our omlette. I dont know if this lag in service is normal since it was my first time.
Now coming to the food and drinks:
I loved the iced tea. It was so refreshing after the sun. I sipped it down as fast as i could.
The lime soda didnt at all taste like lime soda. I even doubt it was lime soda. It tasted nowhere near lime, just soda.
The chicken nachos with cheese dip and salsa was yummy and finger licking good. I loved the olives in the toppings. I would have ordered another plate, had i not ordered the others already. Definitely going back for this.
The grilled chicken sandwich was nice. It had a little too much of mustard sauce in it but thats fine for people like me who love mustard sauce. It came with chips.
The egg and cheese spanish omlette was just the usual. Oh-so-good! It came with chips and two slices of buttered brown bread. The cheese was oozing out from all sides and was so tempting. My second favorite now, after the nachos.
Sadly i couldnt try out the famed chocolate avalanche and cheese parantha. Surely in my next visit.
I loved the decor of the place. And the door with the bulbs. Though when the bulbs were switched on, the place became hotter. I loved the wall hangings and the ceiling hangings. It gets crowded in the evenings and its then that the service gets slow i think. But, anyways I SIMPLY LOVED THE PLACE minus the service lag. Reasonably priced. Highly recommended! Cheerie!

Bon appetit...One of the most trending eateries nowadays...went there for a evening brunch..the place was located close to paramount nursing home..when I invaded the place the ambience didn't seem so good due to lack of ac specially in this scorching summer afternoons which is a minus point as well as the service of the stuffs which is also quite late and lastly the locals..A bit rowdy sometimes I felt. Although the food was good...the grilled chicken pizza with capsicum and olives & the mint teas but the blueberry cheesecake failed to impress...which was ok..but the prices were quite reasonable.So being an avid foodie myself I would avoid going to this place because of the lack of ac which is a must in this scorching heat as well as for the service which should definitely be improved laterally.

The Chocolate Avalanche is definitely worth trying. But a few things to remember here: go with an empty stomach if you want to have that, because you'll NEED to have something savoury after having the Avalanche, and the quantity of it isn't small. The Veg Nacho isn't bad. Ginger Fizz and Green Apple soda is also recommended.

Now about the directions to this place, which is the biggest reason some people haven't been here. If you are coming to Hazra crossing from Kalighat, take the road to your right, from Bata, now take the first right into a narrow street, then the first left onto an even narrower street, then another first left onto a narrower still street, if you have followed my directions properly, Bon Appetit is on your right at the the end of this street. Happy hunting and eating. :)

Bon Appetit, by now, is a legendary landmark for Kolkata's foodie, perenially hungry (and cash-strapped) student population. And indeed, having been there many times over the last one and a half years or so, I can well attest to the excellent quality of the food, the beautiful decor and the cheap prices.

Dishes to have: - Egg Burst pita pocket, cheese chicken pasta in white sauce, passion fruit iced tea, Hawaiian egg/chicken salad, creamy corn and cheese egg crepe parcel, corn cheese wai wai, the cheese paranthas, blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate avalanche.

The lack of an AC is a problem in the sweltering Kolkata summers though, but it's wonderfully cosy in winter. The book selection in the little library is shit though. They should get some better stuff.

Bon Appetit is a cute little place tucked away near Hazra. Needed to use Maps to track it down but was worth the effort. The only problem was the lack of air conditioning. The interiors have swings and low tools to sit around on. The food is priced for college going youngsters and the offerings on the menu are tailor made for the age group of 15-25. The hand beaten coffee was a good bet but the vanilla iced tea wasnt so good. The Hawaiian chicken salad was a bit too sour and the grilled chicken pizza a tad bit too dry. The mango smoothie and cold coffee were good orders as well. Over all we enjoyed the place, what with the hanging grapes and quirky coffee mugs and the decent food scene. The service is slightly slow and you have have to pay for your food before they serve it but overall a good hangout place for friends and couples.

Never judge a book by its cover ------ the saying comes true with ¬†Bon Apetite. Its a true delight for sure.

Located very close to the Hazra crossing, this is a very small cafe with a seating arrangement for about 20 people. The unique thing with the seating is the swing chair that is located at one corner of the sitting area. You get this seat and you have the feel of being in a small, luxury garden. Also, a couple of tables come in the swinging form that will be surely liked if you are the 'adda' person.¬†

The decor is simple but different. The overall appearance is like a small green house decorated with plants and small, lantern like lights. Quite soothing.¬†

Coming to the food, we ordered spaghetti with meatballs, spicy chicken salad and the so famous chocolate avalanche. I liked the salad the best amongst the dishes and as for the chocolate avalanche; it was a real delight. Oh-so tasty and much more that yummyyy! Justifies the popularity it has. The sauce of the meatball dish was good too!

The prices are very reasonable. The above order summed upto only Rs 400 and compared to the food, it is really too good. The service was fast too.

The only issue that you may have is that it doesnt accept cards. But this can surely be overlooked for the good food that they offer. Willing to visit again very soon.

I have visited their saltlake branch quite a few times but atlast got the chance to visit the hazra one...
The first thing that caught my attention was their black & white floor which gave the place a very vibrant look...
The entry area is prettily decorated with books mugs and photo frames which gives a very young funky homely feel to the place...
The main sitting area although small and little humid yet has a very homely cosy feel... The ceiling and walls nicely decorated... Instead of the same old tables chair there we have swings and dices which I found to be very innovative...
We had ordered their famous Chocolate Avalanche which needless to say was extremely delicious...
Also Chilly Wai Wai which was tasty too although the quantity was little to less...
Nonetheless this is a great place for a quick grab and also if u want to sit and chat for hours... The price rate is extremely suitable for school, college students and youngsters...

If you live in the southern part of the city and haven't been here, it's a crime! Bon Appetit is a small corner shack in Hazra, but as the saying goes, big things come in small packages, so it is! I simply adore their club sandwich and hand beaten coffee. A lotta guys eat ice creams and shakes there so I'm assuming that's great too! I love their swing seats, the transparent roof and those decorative grape vines :-)
Best time to go is for breakfast!

After a lot of Zomatoing and looking around, finally found the place. It's in a tricky lane a bit hard to spot. But is a delight once its found.

There are a lot of pictures on Zomato so you can know how it looks, and yes its pretty small. But it's really amazing how they utilized and managed the decoration.
Though being non-ac is a turn-off especially in summer. But the day I visited was fortunately not that hot.
Though the decoration is beautiful, the furniture is pretty small, especially the tables. The seating isn't very comfortable honestly. Space is an issue. And they should have drinking water available.

But the food really makes up for it, despite their slow service and the fact that its pretty pocket-friendly This is similar to the BTW! of Park Street.

Now coming to the food, we ordered Caf√© Mocha, Tangy chicken meatball pizza,
Hawaiian chicken salad and their famous Choco Avalanche.

Caf√© mocha was fine, nothing much to say about it.
Hawaiian chicken salad was a bit enough cold and tangy and spicy for my liking.

Tangy chicken meatball pizza was really thin and crust was too crispy, something I'm not much used to.

Choco avalanche (with egg) was just amazing ! Unless absolutely starving or a foodie, one can't finish this 'heaven in a bowl' alone. This is the main reason why people love this place. This one thing is what will keep me going back there like it does for other people.

It saved my day which was ruined by Sabir's rezala and kolkata's rising mercury level! Choco avalanche... the ultimate love of every chocolate lover.. We were too full to try anything else but the choco avalanche... I want to rate it a 100 .. the perfect combination of choco chips,chocolate sauce,brownie, vanilla icecream, chocolate icecream and wafers.. it is enough for two.. and the decor here is nice. Although it can get a bit crowdy as ppl sit in the adjacent tables but the swing as a table is really a nice concept. Personally, I do not like songs being played in the background in eating places and here the radio was blaring out loud but for choco avalanche saat khoon maaf!

After hearing much about this place went there with a friend to check out thoroughly. By thoroughly I mean to taste different courses. Beginning with nachos- which were really nice. That's gonna pull me back to this joint for sure. 
Then came the sandwich, a chicken club sandwich, which was merely okayish. Nothing great. 
Then the dessert- apparently they are famous for it- the chocolate avalanche. 
It is indeed a choco lovers' heavenly food but I found it rather too sweet. Maybe my time was an exception. 
Coming to the ambience and stuff, it's a small cafe with comfy seating arrangements. Love the swing tables. Overall a good place to chill at a low budget. Will be going again. No doubt! Cheers!

Without any doubt, bon App√©tit is one of the best caf√©s in kolkata. The price they take for the food they offer, is very reasonable. I went to this joint recently after almost a year. 
We ordered, pita pocket, chicken nachos and spaghetti with meatballs, pancakes and a mint cooler. 
Pita pocket and chicken nachos were really delicious, and the sauce they offered with the pita pocket was, as if, made for chips to dip-in and eat. 
The spaghetti and the sauce was fine but, the meat balls tasted like processed- packaged meatballs found in the market which i don't like much. 
Lastly, never order the mint cooler, it's awful.  It tastes like liquid bubble gum.

Good place but difficult to find. Ambiance is good for hangout, and this place got swinging chairs and tabels(girls love this place ). Food is good. Quantity is good! I tried five pepper tuna salad, which was not impressive. Tuna was not fresh and salad tasted like any other shawarma salads!  My gf tried out the choco avalanche. It was good though. It was getting late so we cudnt try out pizzas.. Next time we will.

This Bon Apetite looks even better than the one in saltlake though space is limited. What new to talk about Bon. Their innovative menu and delicious food always beckons a foodie to their shop. Am glad, this caters to the south kolkata people. Their Pastas and spaghetti's are to savor and their cheese cake and chocolate avalanche is to die for. Well, I wouldn't refrain from mentioning that the rise in price of all items is a bit too steep whereas the quantity remains the same(a bit less when it comes to some dishes).¬†
P.S> Rahul, if you are reading my review, I would wish for a larger place for Bon sometime sooner :) and hey, give the foodies two spoonfuls more :) :)

Super pocket and taste bud friendly!
Ideal place for friendly hang outs..just love the swing tables!Food is delicious..my personal pick is the mixed chicken pasta..there is a perfect blend of the two flavours..tomato and cheese.The spaghetti with chicken meatball is spoon licking.Among the parathas the chilli garlic paneer paratha and chatpata lasun mirch paratha is purely blissful!And to finish off the sinful chocolate avalanche is a must have!! Its the best of the kind!
However in my recent visit i found their quantities have reduced noticeably.Also their chicken maggi did not taste as good.Still shall count this place among personal favourites.

Though a bit congested, this place served the best Parathas. I went there along with my cousin. I was on a diet and hence was prepared not to eat anything. 
Cheese Paratha looked so amazing that I couldn't resist myself. Happened to have the nachos and Chocolate avalanche too. I loved the food and moreover it was reasonably priced too. :D

A cozy, little cafe that will charm you with its ambience but the service and the food, definitely needs improvement. Specifically, the thin crust pizza. It's far from the real thing. But if you're in for hanging out with buddies over cups of coffee and a book to read, this is the best option you have. The only thing needed: Improvement in service.

I visited this place with my friends after a lot of recommendation.

The place has a very nice sporty decor but a little cramped in terms of space ,the food comes a little late because of less no. of staffs but that really adds up if you are having a blast chatting up with your friends.¬†
Now lets talk about the food...
The food is really awesome and comes at a great pocket friendly range.

"Jaljeera" and"Iced Tea" are the light welcome drinks that can soothe your appetite.
Unlike many other place the Iced Tea here has a proper tea flavour.

But if you like it hot then you can go for the "Jasmine Tea" for its refreshing flavour.

There are a lot of must have items on the menu
"Spaghetti with meat balls" is quite good but also oily and spicy.
"Chicken Nachos" is the winner in terms of flavour,its really awesome.(must have)
"Chicken Cole saw" is another awesome experience if you like mayo very much.
The "Grilled Chicken Sandwich" is very good.
"Spicy chicken Pita Pocket" is another great experience.

and at last the winner of the day is "Choco Avalanche" with its heavenly taste.(must have)

The final verdict is that this is a awesome place to hangout and also have great food with your friends without being concerned about the wallet.

Wanted to visit this place from a long time! Had heard a lot about it.Went there two times in the last 2 weeks.The food is just amazing.Have tried  a variety of dishes over my two visits like Pete poket,coleslaw sandwich,grilled chicken sandwich,chicken pancake,choco avalanche,green apple soda,mojito,pasta,spegatthi,blueberry cheese cake.all the dishes were delicious & the price was very much reasonable,rather very much pocket friendly.Didn't like their blueberry cheese cake though! the place is small with a decent ambince.It also has a shelf of good books for nerds like me.A very homely place,you can sit here for hours together.A great place to hangout.Highly recommended to all foodies.

You may wonder that if there is hardly any place for ideal breakfasts. But think again here is a place which is simply gorgeous with its gourmet meal. Bon app√©tit is a popular place which pleases its people with all sorts‚Äô of breakfast meals. Surely a restaurant which can perfectly bid adieu to the age old dull practice of having tea and some cookies or biscuits in the early morning. The grilled egg and cheese sandwich, pancakes, masala tea, exotic shakes, pastas, all are simply yummy and enough to make the whole day charming and energetic. The menu of the restaurant is enough to make everyone drool; my still I have my personal selection. Masala tea is to top the list, hot tea laced with their specialized secret masalas rejuvenates the entire body and mind. Caf√© mocha is something is also on the favourite list. Also honey lemon tea scores quite good on the taste buds. During the scorching heat iced tea is my thing which keeps me cool and smooth for the whole day, so I go with their several variants such as strawberry, vanilla, orange, watermelon, lemon. I simply can‚Äôt do without raw mango. Also exotic shakes are on the list of my preference. With that smoothies are truly soothing during summers so quite often I go there whenever there is a craving for mango smoothie or strawberry smoothie or pineapple smoothie. We all are familiar with our very own home made omelets, try their masala Spanish omelet, chicken Spanish omelet etc. to satisfy your sweet buds there is plenty options like muffins, puddings, dark chocolates, apple pie, blue berry cheese cakes, chocolate mousse and many more. When it comes to their pancakes I prefer their pea nut butter and strawberry.

After visiting the Saltlake outlet a number of times, me and my girl gang decided to hit the place today. As it is located in a bylane, this outlet is not that noisy as the Saltlake one but too cramped with little legroom for tall people though the ambience here is much better. As this is the Valentines week, we decided to try some stuff from the special valentines menu. Our pick were a Salami Sandwich and an Iranian Keema Kebab along with Mushroom and Cheese crepe from the usual menu. The items arrived one after the other and I must say they are much faster here than Saltlake. First we were served the sandwiches with plain potato chips. The sandwiches were nothing too impressive to talk about. And, I think its high time they stop serving sandwiches and crepes with chips and come up with some better idea. Then came the keema pav served with pickled onions, lemon and green chilly. The pav was perfect. It smelled as if it was freshly prepared. The bread was very soft, fluffy, bouncy and not sweet, meeting every characteristics of a perfect pav bread. The place where the dish lacked is the keema. Though it tasted fantastic, it was streaming with oil. The crepe was heavenly. It was so soft it melted in our mouth. The filling used tasted almost similar to their Mushroom on toasts, only better. But my friend said that they have almost halfed the quantity they used to serve before. I also noticed the same has been done to the popular Chocolate Avalanche. This is really dissapointing. We ended our little evening meal with a Chocolate Rum Pudding. It was perfect but again the quantity served was too little for 60 bucks giving us heavy hearts at the end of the day.

What worked:
Well decorated, intimate place, although a bit cramped. 
Food- We had a chicken pasta in cheese sauce which was absolutely delicious, so much so that I scraped off every last bit of the sauce from the plate. We also had a chicken salami pizza which had a lovely crisp thin crust and was loaded with cheese, although the tomato sauce I found a bit too sweet.
Prices- good food at very good prices.

What didn't work:
Leg space- more cramped than a budget airline, tall people will have a hard time relaxing.
The music- bad radio station, turned up loud playing mind numbing bollywood music ruins the intimate ambiance. Some cafes play internet radio these days and that's a much better option. There was also a lot of noise, with a loud brawl breaking out next door.
Service- everything arrived one by one, first the pasta, then one person's coffee, the another person's coffee, then the pizza, then my milk shake (after 2 reminders). 
The milk shake- I ordered a black forest shake expecting something exotic, instead I get a glass of chocolate milk shake (probably had some cherry bits in it, but barely perceptible) with a tasteless piece of a cake like object on top. Such a disappointment.
Nothing but chicken- I like my ham sandwiches and bacon is always a welcome addition to pasta. Some options would be good.

I still want to try the desserts, they look very nice.

Yes it deserves a 5 point ! Heard a lot about this cafe and hence today I made it a point to visit this place. It was a bit difficult to locate as it's located inside a bylane in Hazra very near to Paramount nursing home. Well I was awestruck by its interior & decor. It is small and cosy place decorated like a grape vine. The best part is the hanging tables. Now coming to food, it's totally awesome. We ordered for chicken pasta in cheese sauce, chocolate moose and chocolate sundae. Chicken pasta was soooo yummy and cheesy... pure bliss ! The chocolate moose & sundae were heavenly. Price is pretty reasonable. Am totally in love with the place.

this has been an old favourite of mine,with their impeccable service & quality of food has cut out a niche for itself over a period of time. 

The staff is very well trained & extremely helpful.

The quality of food has retained its old charm from the very fast day with new additions which are delightfully awesome.

I ordered my old favourite ultimate hot chocolate & chicken sausage jalapeno pizza. The hot chocolate is a must have with whipped cream topped up,once you mix the two,it sizzles up your taste buds ,also it balances out the tangy taste of the pizza. The thing crust pizza which a lovely cheese layer with chicken bits is a real delight on your taste buds.

Another two must have is the chocolate avalanche & chicken club sandwich mexicana.

Take a bow tean Bon,for all the awesome memories and food....looking forward to more epic moments at Bon

This is one of the best cafes I have been to. The food is incredibly tasty, and it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. The chairs are a bit small, so for somebody who is tall, the seating can be a bit of a problem. The ambiance is quite cute. During Christmas they had really decorated the place nicely. But the best part about the place is their food. Purely awesome. Some of the standout dishes are spaghetti with chicken meat balls, Hawaiian salad and the chocolate avalanche. The midnight cookie shake is also minblowingly awesome. ¬†The only drawback being that the place doesn't have a washroom. All in all a lovely cafe to hang out with your friends, and a definite yes to another visit.

My Second visit to this place. Ambiance: No doubt a balanced one. Well decorated. The problem lies during the summer season since it is not air- conditioned. Moreover the target customers are college goers. In my opinion the sitting arrangement, drinking water facility, bowls and plates need to be a bit more refined to attract young office going brigade. Food: Salads are very good. Yesterday ordered a Chicken Nacho but to my disappointment, the amount of chicken in the dish was very minimal. It seemed a veg dish. Taste was good. No doubt the epitome of this place is CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE - especially the one with the brownie. Rich in chocolate. The brownie has a crunchy feel to it. Amazing. 1 bowl is sufficient for two.¬†Price: ¬†Moderate.

The place isn't air conditioned but that doesn't spoil it's ambience... In fact it makes this place cheap as compared to the rest. The rest of the food tastes good too, especially their pasta.

I am a die heart fan of this place and i always love introducing my friends too, to this place. Although it has not a huge sitting arrangement, but the food covers it up. Chocolate avalanche is the best thing that this place can make. It's heavenly. And i don't know which other thing should i specifically mention about because almost the entire menu is worth the regular visit. But yes, to mention a few, i would suggest people to go for spaghetti with meat balls, chicken pasta, the sandwiches, pizzas, umm...i mean the whole menu is tasty. Just go for anything. And the staff..very cordial, well mannered and caring.

When I entered the place, they had me on the very first instance for the book-shelf. Being an avid reader myself, I loved how they want their visitors to spend their time happily. The interiors were chic & very unique. It was warm and cosy. Coming to the food, I personally feel that the desserts were far more better than the savoury dishes. Chocolate avalanche was a winner!

There are cafes which can easily make your mornings more charming and smiling with their amazing breakfast offerings. Such is Hazra Road‚Äôs Bon Appetite, so next time you yield at your mom for the usual tea and biscuits think again, as this place may make you bring your entire family and have a nice breakfast together that too at reasonable price. I love their masala tea, ginger honey tea, English breakfast tea, caf√© mocha etc they have a varied collection of teas. Sometimes I prefer their shakes like strawberry or chocolate, and mango during summer. Among exotic shakes I often pick up black forest. Some of my friends have tried apple pie and midnight cookie which are equally yummy. I can do without my favourite sandwiches in breakfast so grilled chicken sandwich or spicy tuna olive sandwich or corn on toast is my pick. Sometimes salads go very well with the whole meal so I order their spicy chicken salads. Sometimes a achari aloo paratha or chana dal paratha make the whole day. It is difficult it keep myself away from sweets, and their apple pie or dry fruit muffin or chocolate rum pudding anything is excellent at the end.

I was eager to visit this place after reading positives reviews in zomato‚Ä¶as i am a great cheese and dessert lover this place turns out to be my favourite‚Ä¶though the outlet is small but i liked the decor‚Ä¶me and my friend occupied the swing table‚Ä¶and i loved it‚Ä¶coming to food‚Ä¶we ordered
1.chicken meatball pizza- really nice and good amount of cheese on it
2.chicken grilled sandwich- served with potato chips
3.cafe mocha-was nice,chocolaty
4.veg nachos-i didnt liked it that much
5.choco avalance-must try, i loved it

GOOD THING-after the first sip of cafe mocha i found a piece of plastic in it,after complaining they replaced it without any hesitation n arguement‚Ä¶

BAD THING- the chicken sandwich came after the choco avalanche though it was ordered before the dessert‚Ä¶after having the delightful dessert we ate the cold sandwich which was pathetic‚Ä¶i didnt expected this‚Ä¶hope next time i dont have to face this again‚Ä¶will visit soon‚Ä¶:-)

When a bestie visits town after a long time, it calls for long hours of gossip, figuring out life altogether over good quality of food in affordable prices. And, Bon Appetit provides just that.¬†
Keeping the garden theme in mind, they turned a small place into a beautiful joint quite intelligently. The hangling tables and swings attracted our attention. Grabbing one such table, we decided to dive into the wide variety of food they had to offer. Three hungry souls decided upon spaghetti meatballs, thin crust pizza with onions and tomato, chocolate avalanche and a raw mango soda to go with it. The food was delicious. Quantity sufficient. Very affordable prices. The chocolate avalanche was the best thing, though. For a chocolate lover, less is more makes no sense, the more the better. Generous amount of ice cream, brownie ¬†and chocolate sauce, we were on cloud 9.¬†
Cannot wait to go back again and indulge. :)

They have some of the best chocolate dishes around, and at really good prices. You get bang for your buck. Service is friendly and I frequent the place, so they know me by name. I usually go there after school. It's tucked into this cozy little alley. The place is quite clean and can often be crowded.I didn't really like the chicken pizza, but it was okay. I'm a woman of simple tastes (sometimes!) and my favorite is the chocolate avalanche. I always order it and they often pack it for me to go, since I often run out of time eating.¬†PS-Will add photos when I remember to take some before eating.

Thronged by young people mostly school-college students the place is always buzzing with young-adults, so I would like to call it a high spirited place.To fit in a pleasant 'garden' themed joyful decor in such a small space is really a commendable job. The glass ceiling uses natural light to pour in during the daytime,the dangling floral decoration, the 'swing' styled seats and tables are reason enough why you would like hanging around here..It is a cool hangout place where you can catch up with buddies but not fit for a fine family dining or an "official" date! The price-range is on the cheaper side so affordability to visit here is not a big deal! Our orders included Veg Pasta with tomato sauce and Pancake with chocolate sauce. The pasta was good..I liked it. The quantity sufficient for a single person. The pancake was in fact more than enough to feed a single dessert starved mouth. The spread of the chocolate sauce was generous..Nothing to complain about! So if you are planning a budget hangout with friends to a quirky place where only space is an issue..Bon Apetit will be a good choice.
P.S: Pardon me...The pasta is already half eaten when I remembered I need to post this picture in Zomato!

After a lot of searching we finally reached this outlet. Colourfully decorated with the hanging lampshades and hanging grapes, you will feel that you are in a garden. But the place is quite small, hardly 30 people can enter there simultaneously.
A pocket friendly cafe and the foods were well cooked. Heard from lots of people about their chocolate avalanche, so we ordered the same with their cheese paratha. The paratha is well cooked and served with onion achar and curd; now for the avalanche I must say it is the must having desert for all visitors.
Their services is not up to the mark, rather I must say they need to improve a lot in servicing. When I went for giving the order, after hearing a part of my order they attend a phone call (for any home delivery case I guess!) and made me stand for quite a few minutes. Again you have to wait for at least 10 mins to get tissue paper or extra spoon in spite of asking for it repeatedly!!

After lots of planning which never was concluded ultimately I decided to give my mum a breakfast treat and headed to Bon Appetit . Its a dainty little joint very colourfully decorated keeping in mind that near by school students frequently daunt there. As I was in a bit of hurry I ordered two Chicken Coleslaw Sandwich, one Chicken Hawaiian Salad, two rum puddings and one black forest pudding and took them as a take away. But all my expectations where drowned in bad oily broth. The Chicken Coleslaw didn't have any cabbage which is like the primary ingredient for coleslaw. But the sandwich was the best part of the whole meal. Disaster is what they call Chicken Hawaiian Salad. YOU DO NOT GIVE PICKLED CUCUMBER OR JALAPE√ëOS IN HAWAIIAN SALAD. There was meagre amount of pineapple a spice which they added was giving it an instant noodle kinda taste. And where the heck is the pineapple.......chicken was blackish and disgusting. The desserts where OK but for me it was not up to the mark. Over all not worth second visit.

After reading and hearing many good reviews about this place I decided to visit them for breakfast with much eagerness. Unfortunately it failed miserably. I would call this place "street food in a cafe setting". We ordered an omelette, one sandwich, one pancake and one pheta coffee. The omelette was alright and so was the sandwich... Nothing much to rave about. The pancake was pathetic, it appears that people writing reviews here have either not eaten a pancake here or never one at this place. I took one bite and left the whole plate as it is. The person working at the joint is obviously a low wage worker who neither know how to deal with such a situation nor is interested. I told him the pancake was pathetic and undercooked, he seemed disinterested. The coffee was pathetic also but I has about half of it anyway. I paid for the entire order, wasn't offered any discount whatsoever. Will not go back, I wud rather eat on the streets.

I guess this is my favourite place in Kolkata! Such a cute and cosy place, apt for hanging out with friends. The food out here is amaziiiiingggg and that too at great prices!! So lets start with my favourite item out here... the pizzas!! The chicken sausage and jalape√±o pizza is phenomenal. The perfect crust... the perfect stickiness of the cheese and the fresh toppings make it a must have. Then comes the spaghetti with meat balls!! Delicious!! The hot chocolate with icecream, hand beaten coffee and the nutella pancakes make me go mmmmmm every time i have them!! The chicken salad and the nachos are pretty good too specially the dips served with them.¬†
This is the place where I can go every time say with a wide smile on my lips..." where indulgence is bliss"!!!!¬†
Happy hogging guys!!! :)

I go to college in North Kolkata yet whenever college gets over early, I somehow end up at this caf√©,  travelling all the way to Hazra. Get an idea of what the caf√© means to me? :P Everything over here, right from the Spaghetti with chicken meatballs, the thin crust pizzas, the pastas to the desserts, are swoonworthy! But yeah if you're looking for some authentic Italian type pasta, don't expect that here. But I do love the pastas! :D
PS : the chocolate avalanche. Nuff said!

Now,this review has been long overdue! I have been having food from Bon Appetit for quite a while now and even more so after they started home delivery.Before I start with my review,I must congratulate Rahul Arora for successfully setting up such a wonderful place.For those who do not know Rahul,he is extremely passionate and particular about food and his passion runs through his cafe.

I have sampled almost all of the items on the menu and have been satisfied each time.The Spaghetti with meat balls is my favourite here.It is uncomplicated yet brilliant.The juicy and succulent meat balls on top of the rich sauce and spaghetti is absolutely perfect.The pizzas are all thin crust and with generous amounts of topping.The Double mushroom pizza and the Chicken sausage pizza are personal favourites.The Paneer arrrabiatta on toast and the Mushroom on toast are a delight for paneer and mushroom lovers.The Pasta here might not be the most authentic one you will ever have but it does taste brilliant and the white sauce is simply superb.The Hawaiin salad is also very nice and refreshing.The Nachos with cheese and salsa dip are one of the best you will have anywhere.

Last day,I tried the egg crepe and the cheese mushroom pan cake from here for the first time.I was excited about these two and they were tasty no doubt but the pan cakes were a tad too thick I felt and while having the egg crepe I actually got a couple of pieces of the egg shell in my mouth.That was a little unpleasant but it must have been a one off incicdent I would like to think.The sandwiches are aptly named Gluttons paradise! Among the desserts,the Choco avalanche is simply brilliant, so much so that I tend to order it each time and miss out on tasting the other desserts!It is another of the must haves here.

The location of the place is a bit tricky in one of the alleys near Hazra crossing.The place is a relatively small one but nicely and tastefully decorated.It makes for a perfect place for some good old "adda" with friends.There is no air conditioning and that is one of the negatives of the place according to a few.But for me the quality of the food and the very reasonable and affordable prices more than make up for the lack of an ac.It is quite a popular place and can get crowded at times.The service can be a little slow during peak hours.The staff are very well behaved and polite.I like the system here in which you pay at the counter where you order.Although my place is quite near but its still worth mentioning that they are very punctual when it comes to home delivery.

They had a interesting and innovative pujo menu which I could not try out much because I was extremely busy.But I managed to try the Kosha mangsho pizza during a quick visit and it was exquisite.But I dont think they are running the special menu any more and I regret missing out on them.

Overall Bon Appetit is a wonderful place with great quality food and at very reasonable prices which has become quite close to my heart.

Though it was a bit tricky to figure out the exact location of this outlet, but when I finally did it the experience from the very first step I took into this joint, it was worth it. This outlet is though quite small as far as the space is concerned but the architectural integrity that has been used diligently in order to sketch out the layout, the sitting arrangement etc; is worth appraising. At the entrance, just beside the cash counter/reception you will get to see the open and busy kitchen. After placing your order when you enter the sitting arena, you get to see an innovative and exquisite interior setup, which completely overshadows the lack of space. The decor is a complete piece of elegance, the hanging tables, dice shaped cushions, swing etc; suffice the sitting criteria. The false ceiling elegantly decorated with artificial plants, flowers, climbers etc; adds an ecological quotient to the environment. The bright yet soothing lights, the paintings, the black&white chequred tiles; everything complements each other. Now coming to their offerings: ranging from variety of sandwiches, pastas, spaghettis, pancakes, pastries, sundaes, smoothies, shakes, coffee/tea etc; and the prices are unbeleiveably reasonable (makes you feel like a king with the limited pocket money in your wallet). A far as the taste of their offerings are concerned, my experience has been pretty good. But their "spaghetti with chicken meat balls" was around average, the meat balls were "mint" but the spices & condiments used were not at all properly blended and it was sedimented at the bottom, though the overall taste was quite succumbing and the meat balls was fabulous so I didn't mind. Having said that, I must also mention their mouth watering "chocolate avalanche" generously loaded with chocolate icing, was complete divine. Overall a marvelous place to indulge into your continental cravings and have a great time with your companion or even alone. Dishes generously loaded with cheese and chocolates in such rock bottom prices made this joint one of the most sought after in town.

I love this place! ! Best for an intimate winter evening escape. The decor is that of a garden with swings as your table. Their chocolate avalanche is the best and always try this out. So is their chicken cheese pancakes and thin crust pizzas. Their spaghetti meatballs ain't that good and neither the pasta. Sweet dishes are very decent.
I recently revisited here and tried out the olive corn thin crust pizza. It was delicious with mounds of mozzarella cheese! !! And had my all time favourite choco avalanche and chicken cheese pancakes. ......

Yum yum everything!
This is a tiny little place, in a tiny little street off hazra road that is very hard to find :-P
The interiors are charming, they successfully manage to create the laidback atmosphere of sitting and chatting in someone's backyard in some cool, slightly wintry, exotic locale. (Kolkata however, not being sufficient cool, makes you sweat and wish there was air conditioning. But then, the spell works. You don't want to leave.)
This is a great place to sit and chat over food for hours. I'd been there  only by daylight, sadly, and I can't wait to see the magic it works by night.
Despite the name that wishes you a good meal, all this can make you forget you're there for food. But the food is part of the charm. It's delicious, quantities are great, and there's something to cater to everybody's tastes. The drinks are cool, but could have been much better of they were bigger and colder- one does tend to get rather thirsty. Pricing, too, is moderate.

I really do not have any word to describe this phenomenal place. My sister took me over there. I just cant get enough of their cheese parantha, chocolate pancake with whipped cream by the side and chocolate avalanche. I was really surprised at the costs of the dishes. Though, I have to complain a tad bit about their "self-service" thing, but then again at this unbelievable price, when you get all the chocolates and cheese, you cant really complain about anything.

Well I do not know what adjectives would really be correct for bon appetit.  Should I say? Phenomenal? I am just running short of words. The last time I visited I just had the chocolate avalanche and kosha mangsho pizza,as they were just shutting down then. But last week I did visit bon appetit again. Since it was my veg day, I was crazily searching for options when bon appetit struck my brain gong. Rushed it. I love the decor. The black and white alternate check floors with dice shaped sitting tools. Mirros with lights striving out of the mid way. The tables are like swings. And of course my favourite seat, I sat on the cane swing. Luckily I grabbed the seat. Gave me a feeling that I was in a grapevine. Well whats bad that it is  self service. And it is sad for lady bums like me. So order in for a masala chai, a green apple iced tea n a lemon iced tea. The lemon iced tea was moderate but phenomenal was green apple iced tea. Loved it solely. Then ofcourse ordered for a thin crust pizza . Mushroom a d jalape√±os.  Oh my god. It was hot and yum. I could not stop asking for more and more. I wish the pizza did not end. N for the first time I found thin crust pizzas tasty like never. Then came in the cheese n mushroom pancake. It was delicious to epitome. All I could do is keep shut and eat it. This is highly recommended. And the last boom of kolkata.  The chocolate avalanche.  Its one of its kind. I would rate it amongst the top five desserts of kolkata definitely. Its hot n cold. Choco filled. Chocolate dripping all over the brownie and the chocolate roll stick wafers add to the taste along with the choco chips. The chocolate avalanche will definitely call me back and it is extremely pocket friendly. You should rush as soon as possible.

I was here with my friend after a hearty lunch from a restaurant close by and was actually suggested by her. The first thing to awe about this place is the pretty, charming ¬†and adorable interiors which makes you feel really cheerful. The other thing to notice is the swinging tables, by which we took our place. Amazingly wonderful it was!! We got us a Passion Fruit Iced Tea for myself and a Mango Shake for her. The drinks were refreshing. Mine however was a bit on the sweeter side. We then ordered the Fudge Slice and the Chocolate Avalanche for desserts. The fudge slice ¬†seemed very dry and I had a hard time finishing that and diminutive chocolate sauce smeared over it didn't help either. The Chocolate Avalanche on the other hand was a bliss. It was full of chocolate chips and was literally swimming with the essence of vanilla and the chocolate sauce. It was moist which just melts in your mouth, but is actually pretty heavy for a desert. Enjoyable though this place is. A visit is definitely recommended. A time well spent. Looking forward to another visit soon.

This has been my second visit to Bon App√©tit out of a sudden whim from my girlfriend to have their Chocolate Avalanche which to my opinion is phenomenal. We had tasted their Spaghetti with Meat Balls, Chicken and Cheese Pancake, Chocolate Pancake, Chicken Pasta, Thin Crust Pizza. The pancakes were good, pizza was awesome but their spaghetti which was highly recommended by fellow zomatians was a bit of a let down due to its over-the-kitchen indian masala styled spicy nature. The location is pretty interior and without Google Maps we would have been lost both times and the interiors pretty interesting owning to its garden approach with a swing. Must try this place for its pocket friendliness and its Chocolate Avalanche.

Two reasons I love the place: simple and tasty menu + easy on my pockets. The place has a very easy decor which makes you comfortable and so you end up eating more than you want. No big words in the menu. They just call it what it is. 'Mushrooms on toast'. I know what I am expecting and the taste is brilliant. Good quantity at that price. Also my personal favourite is the 'chocolate avalanche!' They have changed it a little bit as compared to before and have started using vanilla ice cream and what a good decision! Other stuff that I recommend would be eggs and toast, cheese maggi, pasta. Did not personally like the drinks available. But who cares! I ate too much anyway. Overall a nice place for youngsters with affordable prices, a safe menu and tasty food.

I went to Bon Appetit few weeks back. Me and my fiance had to call up Bon Appetit 3-4 times to find out the exact location as they couldn't explain us the exact location. Anyway, after looking for this place for over an hour we finally found the place. After reading the Zomato review i wanted to visit this joint for quiet a long time. 

It is a very small joint, with lovely decor. Black and white checked floor tiles, tables are made of wooden swings, sitting arrangements were also quiet nice and comfortable. the Interior is very beautiful. the decor makes you feel as if you are in vineyard. 

i had ordered : ¬†

Cold Coffee,¬†
Raw Mango Iced Tea,¬†
Chili and Chicken Salami Pizza,¬†
Zesty Chicken and Tomato Egg Crepe Parcels and¬†
Dark chocolate Slice.

The food experience was good. Nothing very special. Quantity wise it was very good but quality wise i did not think it was appropriate (based on my views). it is absolutely pocket friendly and that is the reason it mainly attracts youngsters and college goers.

But i had to face few problems at this place.
1. I had a hard time looking for this place.
2. The servers were not communicative.
3. ¬†They were busy chatting and fighting with each other rather than taking our orders.¬†
4. The service was too slow. Even I had to ask for the bill thrice. 

I hope to have a good time in my next visit.

Bon Appetite !!

There is something about this place that makes me keep coming back. Perhaps the vibe...the decor...the food...the prices! I have had pretty long history with this cafe. Having tried out both the outlets, I must say it is one of the best places for coffee and long conversations. They serve some of the best comfort food in town. There is definitely something for everyone on the menu that instantly can uplift the mood. Indolent winters are best spent here with a mug of hot mocha, meatball pizza and fuzzy socks :)

A reasonable joint with a great and innovative d√©cor. The most attracting thing , according to me, is the seating arrangement which includes¬†hanging tables, small chairs and¬†a swing. You can sit there and enjoy reading the various books which are kept in the shelf there for the customers. The food is sober.¬†The speciality¬†of the place is the "Chocolate Avalanche" and the "Cheese Paratha".¬†The chocolate avalanche is heavenly with too much of chocolate and same with the Cheese Paratha-overflowing with cheese. If need to be described in two words, Bon Appetit is TASTY and REASONABLE.

The reason my rating Is so low coz of the staff there. They have no courtesy towards customers, busy chatting n fighting within themselves ,everytime u need sumthin u.need to.go n call them , it's really sad great places like this has such staff who.don't even know the dishes they are selling if asked them what is put in any particular dish 
U cld try the crepes n.the pizza there the chilli n.salami pizza was quite.nice

I visited this sweet little cafe for the first time on my friend's birthday party. The pretty decor and the chubby ambiance makes you forget about it being non air-conditioning.  And of course the food!
The Pasta, Chicken Club Sandwich Mexicana, Chicken Salami Pizza, Olive Corn Capsicum Pizza, Mushrooms on Toast, Nachos with Cheese and Salsa Dip makes you go Yumm! Last but not the least, comes the Chocolate Avalanche as cherry on the cake as a quintessential sum up!
Every time I hit Bon Appetit, I make sure not to miss this hot and cold Chocolate-Vanilla preparation. Melts your heart. And wins it. :)

So this was on my wishlist for a very long time, and today we finally had a chance to visit the place. A bit hard to find, but if you ask anyone near the Bhojohori Manna outlet in Hazra, you'll find it. Word of caution, do not visit it in a hot summer day, you'll regret it. Even in the cool evening atmosphere of November and a lot of fans, it was a bit hot due to the crowd. Well now about the food. The sum of our order was, Chicken Sausage Jalapeno Pizza, Cheese Paratha, ¬†Chicken Club Sandwich, Midnight Cookie Shake, Green Apple Soda,¬†and Chocolate Avalanche. The Cheese Paratha arrived with the shake, was finished off, and there was still no sign of the pizza. ¬†Forty-five minutes and two inquiries later, they said that the first pizza they made was dropped accidentally and they had to make a second one; hence the late. However, even if we¬†overlook that, rest of the food was mediocre at best. Chicken Club Sandwich had pieces of bones, which is unforgivable. Cheese Paratha did not have much cheese in it and turned tasteless after it cooled down a bit. The Chocolate Avalanche, which I was looking forward to very much, had an annoying amount of vanilla ice cream, not a flavor I am particularly fond of, and not the abundance of chocolate which I was expecting from the photos. Just a little chocolate sauce and choco chips with a couple wafers. The place seemed to be flooded with college goers seeking a place to chat and take selfies over a cup of tea or a plate of noodles. The servers were courteous, but that did not make up for the delay or the quality of food. If you just need a place to sit and talk, food being secondary; you'll like this place. But if you're a genuine foodie, you probably should skip this one.

Been there thrice in three months.It's such a feel-good place,that I have even gone there alone on a lazy Sunday morning!The ambience is excellent mostly,with cozy sitting arrangements and mags and books to read.Once,they put on some loud Bolly music,which,frankly,doesn't go with the place.Being situated in a bylane,it's very peaceful.The food is terrific,going by whatever I have tried.The blueberry cheesecake gets better every time I go there!The thin crust pizzas are just perfect.The apple pie was also quite good.The loudest yays are reserved for the Chicken Salad and you guessed it right-the Chocolate Avalanche!The latter is one of the best ever brownie with ice-creams I've ever had!

My 4th visit to this place now,and I must say it was an equally delightful one.A tiny place, bt so much quirk n freshness with its dice stools, swings, mirrors! And the best part, the oh-so-affordable menu ! So much offered at such low prices- a heaven's den for those who still rely on pocketmoney.Every bit of the menu is worth mentioning.The sodas to begin with, refreshing and available in a variety of flavors, the Ginger mint being my personal preference.The tuna salad, chicken nachos, cheese paratha, n mushroom toasts are a must try for first timers. But I reached the heights of foodgasm on the gem I discovered last monday, and its paradise on eartj for cheese droolers - the egg crepe parcel with corn and cheese!wow!I still have that creamy aftertaste lingering in my mouth.^_^
Not to ignore,the desserts, insane stuff! The perfect way to end such a food journey!The duo topping my list include the Chocolate avalanche and the blueberry cheesecake.! The cheesecake is probably the best I had in kolkata till now,considering the gigantic portions that are served!
Bon appetite, its the perfect name for one of the leading eateries in kolkata now.
I would Definitely, definitely keep coming back to this place. For you, a thousand times over .(:

One has to labor through some lanes to reach Bon-Appetit but the walk will be worth it. This is "THE" College going kid's Snacks Mecca. The interiors are quite chic. The food gives the place its Chutzpah.¬†
I had ordered Spaghetti with Chicken meatballs and Chicken Nachos which came in fulsome proportions and an unbelievable amount of cheese to boot. ¬†The taste was spectacular and eventually ordered a Choco-Avalanche. This dessert kicks one into a high of chocolate goodness and gooeyness . The order had sufficed my appetite for snack as well as dinner.¬†
And no story is a good story if it doesn't have a good ending. The bill was kind on my pocket. I intend to come back here again.¬†

P.S.- Recommended for a casual , finger food-immersed Date.

Bon Appetit is a place I frequent. It serves amazing food at a very minimal cost. the best part? NO tax. :DMy favourites are the white sauce pasta, cheese paratha and choco avalanche.¬†
The ambience is nice and cosy. Its the kind of place that makes you feel comfortable. Though the place is a little small, on a busy day feels cramped up.The collection of books that adorns the entrance is great! The lanterns and grapes hanging from the ceiling and the mirrors on the walls make this amazing place even better. To conclude, there is no better place to have a filling lunch at less than 200 rupees. I would go back on any given day. :D

At last after so many days of planning and cancelling we ended up in Bon Appetit for lunch with my gf... We were very much excited about this place cause we have heard about this place from many people. The 1st thing i noticed while entering was a collection of books some of them were good, mostly for show....but the main sitting area was well decorated and ambiance was a wow!!! Dice shaped sits..swing tables to have your food on them...false grape vines on the top. Altogether gives you an awesome ambience. After five minutes of research on the menu we ended up ordering Chicken penne pasta in tomato cheese mixed sauce,
Five pepper tuna  salad and Black Forest pudding as a desert. The food was really good. Served fresh and hot. A bit of delay though in between serving each dish which i specially found annoying. Salad was great, liked that a lot. It was a colorful dish. Desert was good too. Looking forward to visit again

I visited this place 3 times in the span of a week, I think that quite summarises my review. The locality was in need of a cafe for quite sometime, and it seems like the angels had heard. The place is small and the location was little off-track but the place is so amazingly done, I am sure it will catch your eyes on the first visit itself. The rules are similar to CCD, you make the payment first and then they serve you nicely and politely. On my three visits I had their Chocolate Avalanche on 2 occasions and I would personally recommend this desert, but one thing this desert is absolutely for more than one person. I have tried their Hawaiian Chicken Salad which was so fresh and so nicely done, then their Cheese and Mushroom Pancake. I had always assumed pancakes to have a sweet touch but this one didn't and yet it was so delicious with the flow y cheese and the perfectly done mushrooms. Their Cold Coffee was decent and the Thin Crust Pizza was nice too and remember all these dishes on visiting 3 times. I really do not have a single bad thing to say about this place as of now (*glad*).

Visted the joint few days back. Firstly finding the place was a headache. The joint is on the same small concept of adda joint types & the ambience here is better than what they offer in salt lake outlet. Had high hope on food quality as comparing to the salt lake outlet but it was pretty average. Had ordered 2 3 things & 1 of them was Nachos which was unbelievable cold as just severed directly taken out of refrigerator. HAVE NEVER ATE A CHILLED NACHOS. Need to work upon maintaining the quality same as other outlet.

Its a one time visit as of now.

A wonderful place to hang out :) the decor is very nice and gives an outdoor feel..
For starters we had wai wai bhel, nachos and chilli cheese sandwich.. All of them were equally good :)
Then we had pizzas and the taste was commendable :)
The white sauce pasta tasted good but it lacked seasoning and the red sauce one was just okay. 
The lime soda was awful with no taste at all (reason why I gave a 4.5 and not a 5) 
Chocolate avalanche made up for everything.. It was delicious.. I am not a huge dessert fan but it just made me crave for more. 
The staff were cordial and service was just okay.. 
Ac z should be installed because I would want and love to visit this place during the summers :)

Heard a lot about this place so finally decided to hop in with a friend.Loved the ambiance..perfect for a hangout with friends. Ordered a green apple iced tea, mango lassi and a chocolate avalanche (with egg). Must say the chocolate avalanche was extremely good ¬†*drool-worthy-dessert* , though the iced tea was very normal, not that great. But the best part, all this is absolutely affordable and not at all pocket pinching bill :) and also very cordial service .
On the whole, nice place to hangout with friend but they should install ac's as in summers it would become quite a mess.¬†
Do try people :)

Came here on a nice afternoon for an after college snackfest. I was really impressed by the menu, the variety & assortment of dishes (not to mention Super Pocket Friendly!!) . We went for Spaghetti with Meat Balls, Grilled Chicken Sandwich & Chocolate Avalanche. My experience was overall really satisfactory with a bit of a letdown (coming to it in a minute)...
The place is tucked away in a quiet road a little off the busy Hazra Road, for which i am not complaining at all..¬†
The decor is nice, specially with the hanging tables & all, but the seating arrangement can be improved, as according to me, i prefer that my tables to be wider than my forearm & my seats to be ¬†higher than what was there.. just a thought...¬†Coming to the food.. I ¬†must say the food was really awesome! The spicy spaghetti ¬†was perfectly cooked with some tasty meatballs thrown in..

¬†BUT i think they used way too much oil in the preparation (yes, the taste could have been achieved with lesser oil)... This particular dish was way too oily for my liking & it is my advice to try to keep things healthy as well as tasty.
The sandwich served with chips.. It was fully up to the mark& full of really tasty ¬†chicken! finally the Chocolate Avalanche (

As we entered the dine-in room of the food joint, a certification for 'Zomato viewers' choice' or something alike showed up there on a wall...
It is worth it !!!
The first thing that deserves a huge appreciation is the vibrant and very skillfully put up decor. I hardly imagined of a hanging dining table until I visited here.
The marketing strategy is awesome there. They keep some books for your reading purpose to kill your boredom. 
We ordered a Hawaiian Egg Salad, a cold Coffee and a Chocolate Rum Pudding...
To be very honest- the word 'Delicacy' got a very new meaning there.
The waiters are very efficient and the best part is, in-spite of putting up different types of exotic dishes, which I thought might be very time consuming and difficult to prepare,didn't take a long time. The service was prompt and they serve foods in simple dishes unlike other cafes.
Though the place is a bit difficult to spot, but once you visit it, it will leave a prolonged essence in your tongue which will make you visit there frequently.
The best part is the price chart. They have a really cute, humble and down-to-earth price chart which makes it a very frequent hangout spot...

well first things first, the directions to this place is horrible. To commoners please take a left from the park beside Raj and then the right!

I really don't dig most of the coffee shops, one for the torrid hookah fumes, ¬†the other over-priced (read sub-standard food). ¬†Well this was a shock. No hookah?!? Whoa!¬†

The food was simple good food, made with a zeal to fed and not sell. The kinds you pretend with yourselves with at most coffee shops across the city, and yes i have been to nearly all.¬†

Try the veggie nachos -scrumptious, the pizza- oh! so crisp, or the cheesilicuous cheese paratha..

The coffee though was sad. It was more of a milk-sake!

an the ambiance, its designed to e welcoming.

Just a perfect pick me up place!

Love the decor! The crowd not so much. Food is good. Staff is courteous. Food quality decent. We received a chocolate avalanche with a really cold brownie, but they promptly replaced it with an out of the oven soft hot one after we complained of the cold one. Prices are all correctly put. BUT, the size of the place makes it a heat chamber on summer days, so an AC has to be installed urgently. Overall.. A very good hangout spot with your group.

Having heard from many zomato users,i finally checked it out with my elder sister.
The place is decorated well.A lovely large framed print if Victoria Memorial takes centrestage.There are lots of other decorations and the high glass roof lets in lots of natural light.
Coming to the food,I,had d wonderful opportunity to taste a varied number if foods.
We had chicken sausage jalepeno pizza, chilly and chicken salami pizza,chicken nachos with dip and salsa,sphagetti with chicken meatballs and cheese paratha.
All were equally good except the pizzas which I felt was a letdown as the crust was thick and little amount of cheese was there.
Among the desserts we tried the Chocolate avalanche. Which was mind-blowing awesome.
Hoping to visit again to try out the remaining dishes.

Really good. This is a tiny cafe but they do serve quality food. On Mahasaptami we had a breakfast of grilled sandwiches, a pancake with cream, green mango flavoured ice tea ( which was awesome) and sausages for just Rs.200 per head. The place might not look very attractive from outside but give it a try. After one visit I am inclined to go there again.

1.0 ¬†for outstanding decor
1.0 for the variety of food (Specially Nachos)
1.0 for the ambiance out of the box idea¬†
1.0 for the desert ( Chocolate Avalanche- A must have)
The place is located a bit inside from the main road but worth visiting.
Already visited twice in a month.
Two suggestions would be to- add air conditioners and include more variety of food.

On my first visit itself I fell in love with this place. Tucked around a corner of hazra road. I wouldn't have found this place if my friend hadn't known of it. We ordered a veg pasta and a chicken pasta with white sauce. The food was served after quite sometime. But it was totally worth the wait. The quantity was sumptuous and tasted heavenly. The seating arrangements were quite unique. The swings and the swinging tables were fun. Most importantly our pockets were happy. Great place!

This quaint little place just blew me away. I'd been waiting for a chance to go to Bon Appetit since ages, and when I finally found a reason to go there (friend's birthday), I was more that excited. At first, it was a bit difficult trying to locate the cafe since it's almost hidden somewhere in one of the many confusing lanes near Hazra, but when I finally found it, I didnt mind. starting from the entry which had a nice, vintage decor, to the small passage decorated with mirrors, a bookshelf,and some stools, to the dining area with quirky hanging tables, low seats and a lights installation, the cafe was wonderfully decorated and gave a good, fun vibe. Food - from the generously stuffed cheese paratha to the white sauce and red sauce pasta, and to my favourite chocolate avalanche, was heavenly and delicious. This is one place which combines everything - food, decor, and music, and gives you a good time with your friends, without burning a hole in your pocket.

And yes the dream came true after months....little bit tricky to locate but after you enter the place you will definitely feel that you are sitting inside a garden area...you can see swing table n swing chairs,mini chairs,and chairs in the form of dice...grapes are hanging and so on...they have fans instead of A.C. but I personally don't think it creates as such problem...but definitely d place has space cruch...me and my mate knew that we have to go to the front desk n order d food...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As we were very much hungry we did not wasted a minute,almost ran to order those sumptuous food...the staff suggested to try out the durga puja specials so we ordered Kosha Mangso Pizza form there and Chicken Club Sandwich Mexicana,Spaghetti With Chicken Meatball and Chocolate Avalanche...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The food took a long time to come but you can surely wait for those yummy delights...now coming to the food Sphagetti with Chicken Meatballs felt like heavenly..the meatballs were so juicy...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Next arrived the pujo special Kosha Mangso Pizza...such a thin crust and crispy and the most important thing is all the mangso were melting in our mouth....
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Thn came the Chicken Club Sandwich Mexicana...the sandwich was served with potato chips...it was properly grilled n so so soooooooo tempting..grilled at its best with 4 layers...the coleslaw was crisp n delicious...veggies were fresh n crunchy...properly fried egg n lastly the shredded chicken layer in mayo.....
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Finally the showstopper was none other than Chocolate Avalanche...one can choice it with or without egg...I personally love chocolate a lot so Chocolate Avalanche is to die for...oozing out chocolate from everywhere...with brownie, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, hot chocolate, cinnamon sticks...it gave us foodgasm,chocolate explosion all over the mouth and much more..I was so full that i couldn't even walk down the streets properly.. :p
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The only problem which I found that they do not serve water to your table...you have to walk to the filter and have water...we were there for almost 2hours and we have to walk to the filter and refill our glasses for 4 to 5 times..which the staffs might somewhat look into...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They have also got numerous magazines...and one thing which I liked the most is you don't need to rush...because you can sit,gossip,enjoy your food and have fun for as many hours as you wish....
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall it was a marvellous experience during the Pre-Puja session... :) :) :) :) :)

I have heard so much about Bon Appetit,wih a great lot of people asking me to visit this cafe. Well recently I understood Why! :)

My first reaction was: "God, this place is so small and clumsy" Though the place is pretty small the decor gives me a very garden-ish green house feel with checked floors and a high glass ceiling. I wouldn't deny that though the interiors were quiet different, I still seemed to like it. Frankly everything else was forgotten and seemed petty once I tasted the food. It was SPOT ON!

For starters we ordered Chicken nachos (one snack I'm gonna keep coming back for) which was indeed a generous portion of finger licking delight. For main course we had chicken spaghetti with meat ball, chicken and mushroom pasta in white sauce and a chicken sheekh pizza. I would recommend all pizza lovers who are fond of thin crusts to please try the pizzas on the menu because I'm sure you'll be in for a treat. My personal favourite would be the spaghetti with meat balls, it was simply delicious and I remember packing a portion of the same so that I could eat It again the following day :p I loved it how each dish had distinct flavours with a right balance of spices making me feel satisfied yet light at the same time.

We finished with the Chocolate Avalanche which all my friends suggested was a must have and I'm so glad I listened! It's a sinful Chocolate dessert, which trust me, doesn't make gluttony appear like a sin at all! 

It was sumptuous and filling meal. I would defintely be coming back for more and I hope you do too :)

Have heard of this place from the Zomato crowd for long before I finally managed a visit, all thanks to the gracious host himself. In fact now two visits old, I must say I enjoy sitting here and eating.

The place is done up rather quaintly. A lovely large framed print of the Victoria Memorial takes centrestage. There are lots of other knickknacks, and the very high glass roof lets in a lot of natural light. I am amazed how they manage to keep the ceiling decorations dust free. The seating is comfortable, though someone of my girth prefers higher seats.

I have had the wonderful opportunity to taste a wide variety of food on offer. A range of pizzas, pastas, sodas, pita pockets and desserts. What makes their offerings all the more special is the pocket friendly prices.

On my last visit a few days ago, I had the opportunity to taste some of the specialities planned for the Puja season. The Kasha mangsho Pizza, Chicken with Corriander leaf Pizza and the veg pizza with Poppy seeds were exceptional. So was the very unique Pita pocket with tuna stuffing. Please go try them out.

My only grouse is the lack of air-conditioning for the humid days.

As the name says... Bon Appetit!

This place is utter Piece of shit..
A cafe or restaurant should know how to treat the customers well.
With a note of 500 which just had a mark of a red pen ink, they behaved as if I gave them a fake note or torn not.. such pathetic customer treatment that they don't bother if the customers r walking out. Dumb people working and owning the shop. I never knew o would hate this place for their behavior. So much of drama.. I gave that not to a well-known restaurant and they said no1 should have any issues with just a line of red pen ink. 
People should never visit such places where they can't respect their customers. It's just not about food, it's mainly about how warmly u welcome ur customers. And these idiots don't have any clue about it.. dumbasses!!!

Visited this branch months back with my two sisters. Considering the salt lake branch, bon appetit had set a quite high bar in my books, however the hazra joint was pretty disappointing for me. It was little difficult locating the place at first but that's not a concern. The decor of the place is quite appealing to the eyes, I found it more attractive than the salt lake branch, and that's the only thing nicer about this branch. Anyway, they have a pretty good collection of ¬†books, so there are quite a lot of options for those who like to have a good read along with their food.¬†
The swinging tables might seem visually appealing but i found it pretty uncomfortable, and the place was quite cramped and congested. Now coming to the food, my chocolate shake was pretty nice. I don't remember the other two drinks though. We ordered a white sauce pasta, ¬†nachos and mushroom on toast. The pasta was just okay and it had no vegetables in it, I guess one needs to ask for that while ordering. The nachos weren't that good either, and there was very little quantity of mushrooms on "mushrooms on toast". That being said...the overall experience was a let down. Maybe it was just a bad day so I would like to visit it once again if I get a chance because I certainly believe that first experience isn't always the last experience.
However, my sister mentioned that the egg and cheese sandwich was really good.
Hoping for a better experience for my next time! :)

This place was trully a food lovers delight... Been here quite a number of times, and each time on my way I have had quite a few catastrophes, be it me falling terribly sick and passing out, or an accident on the road, or heavy cats and dogs downpour. No matter how jinxed my visit at Bon appetit is, it can never daunt my everlasting enthusiasm for Italian food and pcket friendly desserts. Today I was there with a couple of friends, and we decided to try out my all time favourite, Sphagetti with chicken meat ball, again :P This time we decided to try out a thin crust 8" pizza, pertaining to such awesome reviews on Zomato. We decided on the grilled chicken olive capsicum pizza with added mushrooms, not too fancy. NExt we decided to be quite gluttonish and ordered for Spicy chicken Stuffed Pita Pocket (2 pcs) :D . By the end of the service, we were full.. and i had too gulp down two pieces of the pizza as my friends had quite given up.¬†

Next came the dessert lovers delight. Being a diehard loyal lover of cheesecake, I just had to go for the Blueberry Cheese Cake. and I was not dissapointed in the least. The flavours were creamy and sweet, and the same time quite refreshing with the blueberry flavoured cream. Next came the Chocolate Avalanche, which was a sinful delight :) We dug into our bowls and devoured it quietly, without wasting a second to spare a word.

I'll surely be coming back to Bon with my buddies, if not for anything, then for the Sphagetti with meatballs, cheesecake and choco avalanche :D

So, had planned to go to the lebanese restaurant at Hazra called Lebneh . After discovering our collective misfortune that the restaurant is no longer functional, we were at the rescue of Zomato and Google map. Their collaborative efforts pointed us to Bon appetit nearby. We entered and marvelled at the pretty interiors. We were complaining about how hot it was , but it all went away once we tasted the Chocolate Avalanche.  This bowl of unadulterated chocolate goodness was finished off under a minute. It was that good.
For the ambience I ll give 6/10 (lacks a.c)
For chocolate avalanche a 7/10. 
Would definitely like to go and try the other dishes. But the Chocolate avalanche. .. FTW ‚ù§

Just recovered from the delightful shocking experience from Bon Appetit.! I am overwhelmed by the food quality and price . We ordered a delivery of 2 Cheese paratha,1 Vegetable cold slaw,1 Club sandwitch mexicana,and 1 blueberry cheese cake.Guys ! When the food arrived I was so stunned by the huge pile of food before me.....and just to think we were planning for a lassi in the evening since me n my colleague thought the amount of food will not be enough, as we are both foodies. 
The Cheese paratha was yummmmmmm.......absolutely soft with cheese filled stuffing. as was the sanswitches,they were too good....We are so filled up that we have decided to have the cold slaw and cake afterwards......Thanks guys...we are absolutely Tummy Happy :)....

Well what can i say about this place. You definitely do not need to wish 'bon appetit'(enjoy your meal) when you are here because you sure as hell will. I am a devotee of the choco avalanche they serve and ofcourse i cannot miss the blackforest shake. If chocolate is your religion then this place is a temple you cannot miss to offer your prayers to. I am not a very big fan of their food because i never placed an order for the same though i have had cheese spanish omlet and it was quite decent.

I got to know about it from Facebook. And so after a long way after shopping, I finally reached there (drenching in the rain). Though the spot is located a bit off the main road (Come to the Jatin Das metro station and then a short and straightforward walk of 5 minutes) but trust me the experience is salutary.

‚Ä¢	Ambience - A typical sweet coffee shop to hang out daily with friends and family and chit chat. The place is kinda small n applied garden theme. I like that there are some cradle types of table over there, and so many square glasses (look like painting/ canvas) are added a different kind of look. 

‚Ä¢	Service- Please serve water and clean the table asap. Because its looks really dirty like this way...

‚Ä¢	Food ‚Äì It will cost near about 300/400 if you want your tummy full along with dessert. Maximum time to dish out food near about 10-20 mints.

I tried the Cheese penne pasta and obviously Chocolate avalanche. Pasta was tasty, creamy, less spicy and Ok but OMG you should arrive here once to have Chocolate avalanche. Lots of Choco chips, liquid chocolate and ice cream just make it sinfully nice. Thin crust pizza is not at all pizza,but more than a paratha and lots of sauce so beware of it, you think you are really gonna enjoy it. But yah we can call it Paratha Pizza. In Early 90's there was an ad of some tomato ketchup. From that time, in house Paratha pizza got the fame!¬†

¬†Negatives-¬†
1) The problem is, you have to pay for the food at the 1st. 2) No credit/ debit card is accepted here.3) No AC or BATHROOM!¬†
4) Need some improvement in the area of hygiene.

‚Ä¢	Overall, a good experience. I want to come here again, for the rest of the dishes. I will give 3.5/ 5

An ideal place to hangout and give adda with your buddies.....what a lovely ambiance....and what awesome desserts they provide. Had a nice experience when I had visited it during Christmas last year.¬† But there is a bit of space crunch, considering that a lot of people visit it. We were a group of 5 and had to wait for seats for around 15minutes. But the service was good and friendly.

I was looking for some good and cheap home delivered food..zomato rated this one as pocket friendly..called them up and asked them if they will deliver the food in new alipore..never expected them to say yes since they are located in hazra!! Ordered one chicken nachos and one tangy chicken ball pizza both of which had a good feedback..they told me approx delivery time is half an hr. I waited in anticipation..after 1 hr i called them up and was told that my food is out for delivery. Atlast i got my food after 1.5 hr. Now coming to the food part..the nachos were tasty and crunchy..both the salsa sauce and the cheese dip was enough as dip..but the portion of the chicken in the nachos could be improved... The pizza base was pretty thin unlike the dominos or pizza hut pizza which we generally have. But whatever.. It was simply yummy!! I dnt know how can they provide such quality and quantity food at such a moderate price. Package came in a good hard boxes with neat design. They took 50 bucks extra as long distance delivery charge which was pretty ok by me! Loved the food. Can improve on the timing of delivery.. Definitely will order more in future..

It was a delight for people of city when BON APPETIT came to the south of Kolkata by opening its outlet in Hazra. Though the place is located a bit off the main road but the ambiance has been nicely done and is in fact better than the Salt Lake outlet by some extent. The food definitely is almost of the same quality but this place will take some time to make consumers feel like home like it used to be in Salt Lake.

I love the food. First few times I just had the nachos and the chocolate avalanche but recently I tried their pasta and the paneer arrabiata and they are awesome too. We ordered a bunch of stuff which we couldn't finish and the bill was just 400. Considering they don't cut corner in using ingredients poke cheese, I am surprised how they make money on this. I took half a point on my rating for the lack of air conditioning. Calcutta is unpleasantly warm for 7-8 months and an AC helps the dining experience a lot for me.

Bon Apettit situated near Hazra more Crossing at South Kolkata. It‚Äôs a small place with few sitting arrangements made inside of it. But the place is beautiful to spend some quality times with your friends or dear ones. It got nice decorations and themes, you will also find hanging tables there. So overall, ambience was good.



Coming to the food, We ordered Black Coffee, Jasmine Tea, Chicken Sausage Jalapeno Pizza (8‚Äù Thin Crust). Pizza  was delicious and It was thin and I like the topping Chef Rahul Arora made. I wont say its awesome, but its definitely something different. I will suggest to try their pizzas.



Food quality and quantity was nice and price was justified for the food they are serving.


Visit them, if you want to spend some times with you dear ones.

A good place to hangout with your loved one or friends. Though the place is small, the decorations are wonderful. The pizzas are yummy. Had a bit problem with the order of food. Must visit for spending your leisure time. I recon the other Bon Appetite's are better. Service quality really dissapointed me big time. I had to pay extra for their mistake. They were at-least generous enough to say a Sorry.

This has been on my wishlist for quite sometime, but could never manage to visit the place. I have known the owner for sometime and thats why I always wanted to wee what he cooks up in his kitchen that earns him such tabs reviews.
The first thing that struck me was the ambience. Its a small place but very beautifully done. The hanging fruits and the greenery give it a distinct charm. The hanging tables are kind of innovative. All in all, the place is tastefully done and shows proper utilisation of space.
Now coming to the food. I ordered for a lemon ice tea and a tangy pizza with chicken meatball. The ice tea was ok, a bit more lemony to my liking. I infact, like my ice tea a bit sweet. It wasn't bad though.
Coming to the pizza, it was delicious. It was really thin and the topping was just perfect. Infact, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the number of meat balls wasnt meagre and had a generous helping of the cheese and the meatballs. It's one of the unique preparations with meatballs. I would again order for it. I'm sure every meat lover would love this pizza.
Feeling quite satisfied with the pizza, I ordered for a nachos with chicken. I was being a glutton I know, but couldn't help. The nachos reminded me of my favourite American snack, nachos with cheesy dip. The nachos were really crunchy and the sauce was spicy and tangy. I loved it, though I could only have a mouthful and did a carry out.
The staff were really helpful and courteous. I wish the management all the best and I would visit you soon.

There are some places which you never wanna visit again! While there are other you can't afford to miss if given another chance! 
Thankfully the experience @ Bon Appetit is of the latter category! 
The Ambience, The Decor, The Service, The Food!!! You are gonna love it ol! 
Although  Situated @ one of the least known places, its presence can be highly felt by its sheer CLASS! 
I n my friend had Choco Avalanche, Cheese sauce pasta n Soda based drink- Mint! 
Bad parts first- The drink was Awwwwfulll
Now sumthng btr- The pasta was simply amazing! Dipping with cheese, it was one of the best i have had in Days! 
Best part- Choco Avalanche! -The regulars bt the best! -As always
Some cons- 
1. No A.C- Its really uncomfortable during afternoons! 
2. Weird location- For the first timers, its gonna be a hell-u-va task finding it! 
3. Space crunch- but that is usually superceded by its AMAZING decor
For All those still unaware of this place or in doubts about visiting it! 
My view- Go for it! For You're gonna be a Regular SOON. :)

An amazing cafe located near hazra, it is a perfect example of making a small place into such a spacious one. The decor is very charming with swings etc. The food is simply awesome with all the small treats they have to offer. Be it nachos or corn sandwich or parantha of the day. The most special of its treat being chocolate avalanche and chocolate pancakes. Yummmm. The prices are affordable. Rating 3.5

after loong cravings to visit this place...I actually managed to drop by with my bestie..on one fine Friday evening...
although we had to search down this place,being confused with the directions...when we finally stepped in,the place seemed like a different world altogether...
One cannot leave this place without being impressed with the decor...the whole idea of assembling the decor is so unique,it simply stands out...it kind of works as an assurance,that you've come to the right place,and you won't leave with a grumpy face..
We went for Spaghetti with Chicken Meatballs,Lemon Ice Tea and the Avalanche with Brownie..
i would not complain of the service being slow..cause i could rest assured that my meal was being prepared with care and also a la Minute...
the spaghetti was just lovely with the perfect amount of seasonings...and the meatballs too were quite tender..
the Lemon Ice Tea..seemed a perfect choice to go with the spaghetti...
and finally when the much craved Avalanche arrived on our swing like table...i could see the person sitting next to me drooling already,a spoon in his hand :P

the perfect input of choco chips,Hershey's syrup and ice cream,plus a warm brownie...I'm sure,i was in heaven for a few moments...but yes,after a while the brownie started tasting a bit tooo sweet,for me at least.......
the experience was definitely worth cherishing...a wonderful place serving delightful food,and that too in close vicinity to my college(GRINCH LIKE GRIN :D)
I will be back soon :)

well,i kept my word,
¬†when i dropped by on panchami this time with my college mates...i was compelled to fall in love with this place all over again...that Blueberry iced tea(out of this planet)...Thin Crust chicken seekh kabab Pizza...and ofcourse Penne in Cheese tomato sauce alongwith shredded chicken...loved each of the dishes to the last morsel

Visited this place yesterday... the first impression was that the place is like really stuffed up and small in size... We got seats and placed our first order as hot chocolate....... Well, the service is not exceptional but yes quite friendly......Hot chocolate was amazing..... and we took a place with the swing as a table. Then we ordered chettinad sandwich and a grilled chicken pizza.... ¬†it was crisp and delicious.... we had a good time sitting and jaberring all the time.... one thing which i dint like was the litchi sparkle... that certainly wasnt good... and yes, mocha muffin is quite good..... Overall rating is good... and a very comfortable place to hang out with your loved ones... Give it a try :)

level has degraded. Quantity has reduced. Quality has deteriorated. Not going back again. They served us cold hard brownie in avalanche. In asking they denied.¬†

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was loooong ago when I got introduced to this place via Zomato.. And now it is my frequent visiting place.. I love to go there anytime even after eating out at some other place :P .. It is only because of their food and the ambiance.. Though their seating arrangement is not enough nice but the ambiance is so nice and comfortable that I like spending time there..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reasons, I have given a 3.5 rating it, are its service time n non-a.c seating arrangement. Its service time was unexpectedly long.My friend got so angry because just for one cheese cake n pizza he was not ready to wait 45 mins long.

Impatient he became calm after eating the food as it was so delicious.

We had blueberry cheese cake, pizza with salami n chocolate avalanche.

blueberry cheese cake : It was my friend's choice n i's thankful to him to choose it.that enormous cheesecake had made my day.fabulous. 4/5

pizza with salami : loved it. tangy taste, thin crust . ohoo. lovely. believe me, i'm salivating right now thinking about that pizza.
5/5

chocolate avalanche : I's so full having those aforesaid items so i took very little of it n it was delicious.hot brownie n cold vanilla ice cream with a load of chocolate chips n sauce. 4.5/5

Ambiance : nice n sweet.only let down was the non a.c part.but still okay. :(

Service : please serve water.....! n makeit fast...!

pocket pinch : very less.

Nice experience.....! Going again for pizza with sausage n lots more...!

Planning for a day out with your friends?? don't want to roam here & there?? Wanna have a chat with your amigos?? & u love good food in a pocket friendly price?? Well yeah this is the place you are looking for. We planned for a hangout after a long time & one of my friends suggested this place. It was a bit difficult to locate this place in ¬†Hazra but once you get there you have to love this place. well decorated place though i agree it'z not that spacious. But who cares when u got a place to sit and have a laugh with you pals :). The decors are really very cool and once those lights goes on the place looks more majestic. We went there around 3 pm, but ordered about one n a half hours later. What i mean to say is that there is no rush!!!! You can chat,laugh,fight(obviously the friendly ones :P) & then order when the hunger strikes ;)
.Now lets come to the food. The food they serve is equally attractive. The quantity and quality is way better than the price tag & that's why this is popular among the college students. & as you have read almost in all reviews CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE is a must try :)

Oh I have been wanting to visit Bon Appetit for sooooooooooooooo long. It always used to be either too hot or too rainy days. However today I visited this amazing place. It was easy to locate, all thanks to the reviews that I read for the exact location. The exact end to the lane right opposite to Sujata Sadan houses Bon Appetit. There are boards for direction.

We visited here at around 2 and the place was all empty. Thank God because it's a small place and I really wanted that swing table. We took the middle table/swing because that got a lot of air from both the fans (little calculations to enjoy at a non ac place during summer :P).  The other tables with four dice tools looked a little too small for four people. However, I was quite happy with my place. It was airy and big enough for two people. I also noticed this wall with lights, I wonder if they light them in the evening. It would look very pretty :)
Later I saw there is a space behind that wall that keeps nit grits of the eating joint. Good job done with space issues in style!

Now the food. It was a tough cal since initially I wanted to order everything on the menu :D
We eventually ordered strawberry float, lime soda, egg coleslaw, chicken nachos, pizza with chicken sausage and jalapenos and THE chocolate avalanche. We were two people. And we over ordered, which we realised during ordering but I could not give to so many things that I wanted to try! 

The strawberry float was bad. Very bad! VERY VERY bad. I absolutely disliked it. It tasted like some medicine. Disappointing. I did not taste the lime soda but A said it was okay-ish. The egg coleslaw which was served with chips tasted very good! I totally forgot the extremely bad taste of the float while eating this. The nachos were perfectly crispy and the chicken shreds were good. I did not exactly like the salsa dip but the cheese, as always was perfect. The pizza was the best item I had today. It had a good crust, perfect amount of cheese and sausage and whatever it is that is supposed to be on and in pizza. 5 on 5! We had a real tough time finishing the pizza! We were THAT full. Last cheery on the cake was the chocolate avalanche! I would not say that the brownie inside was the best that I've had, but the ice cream-chocolate sauce combo and the wafers and the over chocolate overdose was just too delightful!

I have probably gained myself 2 extra kilos today. However, I was pleased with the experience. The prices on the menu card are inclusive of all taxes. Yay! I just wish they served water to us and everyone as well. That is one bit I did not like about this place. I mean yes there are many places that don‚Äôt serve water these days, unless ordered separately. I still wish they served us water today. Otherwise. A MUST visit for the place and price. I will HAVE to visit soon to try the items that I missed today!

Bon Appetite is a very cosy cafe which gives you excellent options for snacking over good old adda and at friendly prices.
I had the good fortune to try out almost the entire menu over adda this Sunday.
The salads are tasty, the ice teas refreshing, pizzas thin crust cheesy and delicious and the pastas heavenly. To top it all you have an out of the world dessert in the chocolate avalanche.
The Hawaiian chicken salad, the chicken sausage pizza , the spaghetti with meatballs and the avalanche are dishes that stand out.
An absolute gem of a place. Must visit.

A cute, nicely decorated, "home-like" place, Bon Appetit, the Hazra outlet is not just pocket friendly, but also serves really delicious food. Be it breakfast, be it snacks, be it lunch even, this place won't give you much to complain about both quality and quantity. Had a good experience, and looking forward to visit it again and again.
P.S. - Shop remains closed on Mondays. I went on a Monday and had to return back.

So this very LAZY Sunday evening my besti her guy and me decided to have a look at this much talked about food joint.. first off we spent an odd 120 buck in the cab from Tollygunge to Hazra the reason being that we could not locate the place, but once we caught sign of the little sign board we followed the arrows and tadda.. we reached destination "it" . The place is cute and they have the best space management that i have seen in a long time a little garage (probably) made into a chique eatery.. it is very very nice place... a little off for the hot sticky days but otherwise  a complete hit .
Coming to the FOOD... so i went with this real panicky person (my besti's guy) who eats only at Punjabi dhabas and has no mercy when it comes to bad food..and he left the place happy and deciding on a SECOND visit.. we ordered the chicken Nachos meat ball pizza tunna salad and the chocolate avalanche .... and paid 480 bucks :)
1. The nachos were the perfect.. well presented and they did not hold back on the amount of sauces they use
2. The meat ball pizza.. the Punjabi food fan was dead and  the pizza lover was born- need i say more ??
3.Tunna salad.. was good! could have been better a little too much of bell pepper usage.. :P
4.Chocolate Avalanche , well true to all the praises sung about this beaut , it surprised and awed us... one was defiantly not enough even though we were full.. that is not their fault though we are gluttons !!

The reason why i gave 4 was a few minor setbacks 
1.Too Hot- no airconditoning
2.Hard to locate 
3. Too Small 
4.No card policy- who carries cash all the time !!

The reason they EARNED this good feedback
1.cute place
2.awesome food 
3. affordable
4. wholesome
5.good abience
6. polite staff
7.Smart Service system 
8.Fresh Food
9.ALL things THEY served were either good or not on our TABLE.. 


A must visit  for all that love food and Loads of it.. :)

so i remember that it was our last day of our exams, and bon appetit was our destination . it took  time to find the place but then iwe finally found the place. the place is beautifully decorated.  we ordered green apple soda which was basically recommended by the shop owner. and it was tasty enough.  then  we ordered chicken pasta with mixed sauuce which was very tasty and last but not the least choco avalanche , amazing that was. though the place is a bit stuffy  but then amazing foods they serve covers everything.

This place was recommended to me by some of my friends but this small  is definitely overrated. This cafe is hard to locate and is characterized with average service, some items are really good like the choco avalanche and chicken nachos. The prices are quite reasonable here and this is a good place to hang out with your girl. If the place is crowded then you might have to wait for a  seat as is a bit less spacious. If you are less on budget then you can vissit this place.

Its a very small place with limited seating the main drawback is they dont have AC in the sitting area.... when this place is full it becomes conjusted as the area is so small that chairs and tables have to be small making it unpleasant for long sitting...it is very very pocket friendly the quantity of food is also nice the desserts are amazing service is fast and attractive overall when you dont want to spend and the want to have decent food/desserts this is an apt place for you

'sweet' is the word that best defines the place, it's ambiance, it's food and all in true sense. 'Bon appetit' can certainly boast of its sinful chocolaty desserts -  the plethora of chocolate sauce rolling and chocolate chips over major chocolate items. & yes you need to be there with empty stomach and a good appetite, else you won't be able to do with your chocolate avalanche - the dark chocolate coated hot nutty brownie inside floating over the sea of vanilla - a bit too much to fill your stomach & satisfy the taste bud. the other items are naturally yummy specially those from the department of 'other sweet temptations' , the regular shakes & teas - which they offer in a wide range of varieties. while i was there with my friends we ordered for 2 pair of  pita pocket - chicken spicy & egg, 1 tuna olive sandwich, 1 black forest pudding and 1 chocolate avalanche ( the later being the most popular). the avalanche itself was very heavy - more than enough for 1 person. the pita pocket and the black forest pudding deserves a high five, but the tuna olive sandwich was rather Indianized than being authentic. ( though tasty). the next time we went we ordered for cold coffees which seemed very much sugary and we could not have black forest pudding ( as it fell short) unfortunately enough most of the times we went later, they failed to serve the rare items and ran out of stock.  
the most remarkable factor about this coffee-shop is its low price, and every item here is rather cheap. the decor is a treat to the eyes, - the ceiling adorned with hanging grapes and other colorful stuffs and yes the swing which serves as a center table is pretty interesting ( as to me it takes me back to my childhood fantasy) there's a corner swing also and book shelves on the narrow passage - all of which together make it a good place to chill out.  but then the service is too slow and a few of the staffs were quite of a dump kind.

Well I visited Bon Appetit for the first time yesterday. It was a rainy afternoon & the place is quite tricky to locate. Well finally we reached & found ourselves a place to sit.
I didn't know one had to place the order at the counter & make the payment upfront, so we wasted 10 mins sitting until a guy came to clean the table.

We ordered Chicken Nachos, Tangy Chicken meatball pizza & chocolate avalanche.

Chicken Nachos & Pizza were quite good but not the greatest. We found hair in the Nachos but didn't make a fuss about it.

Chocolate Avalanche: Had heard about it before, Bon Appetit is famous for it. Tasted it & found it to be heavenly. Would visit Bon again & again mainly because of Avalanche.

The place looks quite classy but there were quite a lot of fly humming around our food. Would give it a visit again soon & try with the other dishes. Actual rating would be 3.7

So a sudden visit to this place for an evening chit-chat not only impressed me but also my stomach. It was Saturday and the weekend crowd made us wait a bit before we were allotted our seats. The place is small and overcrowded but it really doesn't matter when you have some good food laid in front of you. We ordered Chicken cheese pasta, Chili and chicken salami pizza, chocolate moose and chocolate avalanche. We had to wait quite long before the food was served but it was quite obvious by the way people were pouring in. I must say the food was exceptionally good. I found myself lost somewhere while having the pasta n pizza. They tasted so genuine that i was really planning to get another plate.  But thankfully the chocolate moose and avalanche arrived and once again I was lost in the whirlwind of chocolate. The brownie was so tasty and having it with ice cream was like a treat to the taste buds. The price is very reasonable and I m surely coming back for more. Cheers....

I can call myself a regular customer of the one at Salt lake, but this was the first time I visited the Hazra outlet. The ambience, I must say is better than the Salt lake outlet, the food and the menu is the same. Without wasting much time, we made the order. 

1. Thin Crust Pizza with tangy Chicken meat balls. The quantity was huge compared the price which was very impressive. Abundant cheese and a number of meatballs cooked to perfection made this pizza a complete favourite. The crust can at times be a little hard because its crunchy, but I liked in nonetheless. 

2. We ordered a Chicken Club Sandwich Mexicana huge again was huge with chicken mince and egg in between. It was juicy and fresh and filling. Again quite impressive. 

And finally, it has become almost a ritual to end the feast here with the god of all deserts...

3. Chocolate Avalanche: There is a reason why its called that, its because it precisely is an avalanche with an overdose of chocolate coming from all possible sides. It is beautiful., the chocolate overload. And honestly speaking, chocolate is good. An overload of chocolate, what more can you possibly crave for?

The Two outlets of Bon apetit,display Funk, food and youth in their styling and atmosphere. The Salt Lake one,i was quite a regular too. But The Hazra one is better in some aspects. First of all, Space. The Hazra outlet is way more spacious and spread than the saltlake outlet. It has more breathing space, instead of the Crowded feel of the saltlake one. Secondly, The Drinks. The variety and overall quality of the drinks, are indeed better than the saltlake one. Now, the cons. The Food of Saltlake,maybe less in numbers, is still more delicious than this outlet. maybe it was the dish i ordered as such, but i would stick to my opinion as of such. Second, the seating. Majority of the seats are way below your knee height, So tall persons, beware. 

Overall, this is a good hangout spot for the college kids, or recently promoted school kids, but for general hangout or foodie's paradise, i suggest better options

A place which does offer some nice food  lacks proper seating space. Service provided by them is not really something worth a mention. By the way, reaching the outlet is also like a challenging task. Its congested...its hot...Non AC...unhunh...doesn't work for me and for many, most probably. Wouldn't really recommend for "catching up"...there are better outlets.

Location: Hazra 

Came to know about it from its former outlet at saltlake. 
This one's also a small place, similarly opened up in a garage, but not to go on the plot of opening.
But, has a very different interior from the former one. The grapevine style ceiling,the old European style lighting, the swing-style & low height tables along with a combination of chairs and fibre dice stools for seating give this place an ambiance which is a near-reflection of the western country style caf√©s.

About the Fooding, being to the point:

- Cheese Paratha: A treat to the taste buds. 
- Chocolate Avalanche: Just the same as always! 
This dessert can take you on a roller coaster. 
Highly recommended!! 
- Nachos: Crisp tortilla chips topped with cheese, salsa and black olives. Delicious.

The Staff out here seems efficient and well-informed who serve at a moderate speed.

Pocket friendly prices. 

Overall a great experience!!¬† 
Recommended. :-)

Well finding the palce would have been tricky had it not been for the directions provided by earlier patrons. The cheese paratha is awesome, the chocolate avalanche is amazing. They need to go easy on the chocolate sauce though. The dessert bowl was drowning in it. The only downside is they just can't manage crowds. Service sucks. Also the cold coffee with icecream that I ordered was lukewarm. A big big putoff. Also it had no icecream. They added it later as an after thought. However the cold coffee was still warm. Also they had no clue as to who had ordered the cheese paratha. Other than this it's a really good place. Really recommend it to everyone.

A good hangout joint for youngsters with good option of food. The bad side about Bon Appetit is that it doesnt have an AC so in summers its really uncomfortable for the visitors. Secondly I wasnt too impressed with the seating. The place is too small and the chairs and tables are smaller still. Its fairly uncomfortable. Some tables are in the form of swings hanging from the beams above. Nice innovation I would say but no one likes your table swinging away as you eat. So an innovation I feel which doesnt go well. 

The Crepes are really tasty so something that I will surely recommend to everyone visiting Bon Appetit. But something I didnt like at all is the Thai Curry Maggi. Very salty and not tasty at all. I am sure the simpler versions of Maggi would be much tastier. Sandwiches are also good so you can go ahead with that.

Okay. To start with, the location is a little tricky. Thanks to Poorna Banerjee for the detailed instructions about reaching the place. We loved the decor right away. The spouse chose the thin crust pizza and I immediately took a few bites. We loved it. I opted for parathas and was very happy about what was served. For desserts we opted for the day's special, and it immediately made me plan in my head about ordering some cake from this place later. And I did, later during Christmas. The annual ritual of fruit cake baking seemed very interesting to me since the first time I heard of it -- and when I tasted them I went head over heels.

BON APPETIT, HAZRA
Located near my college, much speculation has been made about the actual location of this joint. They have a Bon app√©tit in Salt Lake so why will the people of South Kolkata be deprived of some good food. 
Firstly, brace yourselves for an adventure in order to find this place, tucked in a small corner of a lane near hazra, but the food is worth the wait , the d√©cor is old school and nice no A.C  though, it‚Äôs a bit difficult for people to accommodate themselves as the space is less.  I am not a big fan of small tools which are uncomfortable to sit, coming to what they had to offer you can get the menu from anywhere but not the true review. We ordered ( on our first visit ) Strawberry sundae, raw mango soda and their fabled ‚Äú Chocolate Avalanche‚Äù the kitchen is small and you can see them prepare and assemble the food, the food came in quick time, the raw mango soda was pure bliss, which could not be said for the watermelon or the litchi soda  , the strawberry sundae was nice but my expectations were pinned on the Choco avalanche  which was the last to arrive like a KNIGHT in CHOCOLATE ARMOUR : 
The labor of the day , stress of family, girlfrnd problems or whatever you may be facing , take a spoonful of this chocolaty concoction and MY OH MY! U l forget everything loaded with scoops of ice cream ,chocolate chips and a brownie with oodles of warm chocolate sauce poured generously, this fails to disappoint on each and every count , the nachos are good too with portions being enormous , A word of advice the Chocolate explosion with ice cream might scream awesomeness but it‚Äôs not ( KEEP AWAY).
VERDICT: Pocket friendly, good food, can be difficult to find but worth it. 
DIRECTIONS : When you take an auto to reach Hazra , get down and ask anyone about ‚ÄúSUJATA SADAN‚Äù, it a building with a red name hoarding , just opposite to that will be a narrow lane keep walking on it and here you are.

I had been to their salt lake outlet previously but since that was a treat from a cousin, I couldn't order dishes of my choice. So since then I had planned on visiting it again to try out some of the things I found to be interesting on the menu and since I had not been to the hazra outlet, thought of giving it a go a few days back! It was a hot summer day and the absence of air conditioning did sting a bit! Getting over that fact, the overall decor and ambience was really good, I specially liked the swings being used as tables! The system of paying up front at the counter is a bit of a pain though. We ordered chicken stuffed pita pockets, chicken nachos and cheese paratha. Food came fairly quickly, 1st the pita pockets and nachos and a little while later the cheese paratha! The way of presentation was good and so was the food itself! I specially liked the white sauce which came with the pita pockets! However in case of the nachos, I think they use cornitos nacho chips, the seasoning on the nacho chips didn't quite go well with the overall taste of the nacho preparation. Using unseasoned nacho chips would be a better choice in this case. The cheese paratha came with pickle and curd dip but it didn't need any of it cause it was so tasty itself! One word of advise here though to anyone ordering cheese paratha, go on licking ur fingers clean of the cheese as u eat cause once it cools down, its really a nuisance to try and wash it off, specially since they dont have a washbasin, and no tissues wont be of much help! I had to in fact take water in a glass and go wash my hands outside!

So all in all, good decor, good food and a nice place to go hang out with friends! Am definitely going back, you should too! :)

May 3rd,2014.
The day when Bon Appetite came up with its another set of innovative dishes on the ocassion of its Birthday!!
I couldnot resist myself from the menus displayed by Mr Rahul Arora on the FB page and visited my The Favourite Bon Appetite on 3rd May itself.This time I was accompanied by a friend from Bangalore.

What we saw!!
A redesigned menu card.Quite impressive.Increased rates :( :(
Many new items as promised.

What we ordered!!
Chicken Chettinad Sandwich(new)
Sphagetti with Chicken Meatballs(new)
Grilled Chciken and olive pizza(new)
Tuna salad(new)
Chicken Pasta(Parcel)
My favourite The Chocolate Avalanche.

What we experienced::

Coming to the new entries.

Chciken Chettinad Sandwich is really unique with that typical chettinad taste.Spicy.My south Indian friend really loved it...!!!

Sphagetti with meat balls:Looks really good.The meatballs  gravy was spicy and rich which went well with the plain sphagetti.

I loved the pizza.lots of  olive and grilled chicken and thin crust.

Tuna Salad

I was really apprehensive that this might smell fishy!! :) ;) I mean this might ahve that typical smell which I dont like but the kitchen guys assured me it will be good so I ordered.They didnt have required amount of capsicum but I confirmed that it wont be a  problem.The salad didnt disappoint us!!

Nothing to talk about pasta and avalanche.My favourites. <3 <3

P.S:This is to Rahul.Avalanche is no more a 100 bucks miracle!!! :( :(

Located in a confusing by-lane near hajra , BON APPETIT impressed me with its smart interior ideas and CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE  ! Though the ‚Äúswingy‚Äù tables lack practicality they sure grab you eyes instantly. I have to say that quality, presentation are very average though portions are good . Mostly thronged by young crowd this place goes easy on your pocket providing the ideal backdrop for  a quick bite and sip ! P.S.  not your place if you cant thrive outside ac

Ok at last I had been to this place after a long wait... firstly lookwise this place is really unique... hanging tables,lighting,interior decor all are quite appreciating... bt there is a serious problem regarding the inner space.. it is really not spacious to accommodate a big group of people... although the place is a non ac one but I personally didn't feel any problem as it was quite airy... after getting our table we ordered for cold coffee with ice cream,green apple shake,mexican corn salad,chicken cheese omlette,chilli garlic wai wai... food was yummy and the quantity was really good.. at last we dug into Chocolate Avalanche... wow man! It felt like fountain of happiness in my mouth... chocolate brownie with loads of chocolate sauce and vanilla icecream made me go crazy... it was superb!!! Quantity was huge...so plz try this one... at last I would like to make a comment on their service... they should improve their quality of service... overall it was a nice visit... had a happy day at Bon Appetit.

The other day when I was writing a review for food station, I thought of Bon Appetit. Sadly, there was no Bon Appetit when I was a student, it opened much later. So the fun of going to a teeny-weeny, non-AC, somewhat-inexpensive-difficult-to-locate-cafe-with-great-food, is somewhat dimmed to the mature sensibility. However I would try to be objective in this review. Well the decor is off-beat, open ceiling, suspended seats and what not, the book collection a bit kitschy but cute. The open kitchen a tad unappealing (tip: it can work wonders if the staff is bit friendlier), yet OK.
The non-AC bit takes a toll on you, winters may be pleasant I assume. The crowd mainly consists of college and school kids from the neighborhood. The food however makes up for all of it. It is cheap and innovative. I tried the sandwich which was decent, and the mushroom on toast was quite impressive. The tea and coffee is just about OK, but one cannot really complain, because it is great value for money. A good hangout zone for youngsters!

I wonder how zomato doesnt mention that its a non AC cafe. Its an xtremely small place with very uncomfortable seating arrangements. You can't even strech your legs properly. The waiters are unable to reach the tables because of the small interiors and you have to strech out your hands in order to get your ordered food. Terrible during the summer,too suffocating and yes location is odd too

However the good part is the food. We ordered for rose and mint soda both were refreshing.. The chili cheese sandwich is stuffed wid mozerella cheese oozing out with each bite. Cheese parantha is awesome and unique idea of food must say. Did not come across such a snack before. Finally the big blast of chocolate.. Chocolate avalanche was a 10 on 10.

The pricing is quiet cheap mainly because of the college crowd hanging out at the cafe but the management should think about the space and an AC.

Bon Apetit - Where Indulgence is Bliss :D

**Location -> The location is a bit tricky one though :D Thanks to the GPS I located it last Monday only, but unfortunately they remain closed on that day. Today had no problems in reaching there. Walking through the lane of the Hajra More Auto stand,the one from where the autos from Ballygunje fari drops you, then taking the first left and then again taking the first left you find the Bon Apetit :)

**Ambience/Decor -> They dont have a large space, but they have done splendidly well with what they have. Though its open aired(no AC mind you) , but the decor satisfies the lack of the cooling machine. Swinging tables,dice tools as seats and the special food they provide fethches them great points from me :)

**Brief -> Had been thinking for a while to check out this outlet, today got the time and I pounced on the opportunity. With my DSLR in my bag and having TB as my partner(as most of the times) had a great time there. :)

**Things Ordered -> I reached there at about 2 PM today, with the scorching heat sucking away water from my body, we instantly opted for a Rose Soda and a Cold Coffee with Ice Cream to get our mind going :P
As the rosy soda and Cold Coffee cooled us, we ordered Chicken Pasta in mixed sauce,Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the worth remembering Choco Avalanche.We reordered the Rose soda and Fresh Lime Soda :)

*Rose Soda* was served instantly and felt like an oasis in the desert after coming from the heat.
*Cold Coffee with Ice cream* tasted nice to me, though the Coffee content was a bit high which made it taste a bit bitter, may be because I tried the sweet Rose Soda first.
*Chicken Pasta(mixed sauce)* , initially I ordered tomato sauce pasta,but the man in the counter suggested to try their mixed one , and I must thank him for his great suggestion. The pasta was charmingly delicious and had adequate chunks of chicken. It filled us entirely.
*Grilled Chicken Sandwich* it was served with potato chips and it was very keenly prepared as well, with adequate chicken fillings inside the bread pieces. I liked it alot.
*Fresh Lime Soda* was also pretty nice and quenched our thirst :P

****Chocolate Avalanche**** this was indeed the Man Of the Match, the looks, the taste,the ice cream, the chocolate sauce , every single part of it was worth remembering. Its indescrib-able(mind my use of words). Its heavenly, one must taste this to decide about this. Its unique and it surely steals the show for them.
It felt like "Main thehra raha, zameen chalne lagi
Dhadka yeh dil, saans thamne lagi".. Seriously no other words could define it , atleast not in my vocabulary !!
A reccomendation to all the lovers reading this, do take your love there and make him/her taste choco avalanche, your love will increase by 200% :D

**Purse Check -> They have a menu card which shows prices inclusive of taxes.Its a prepaid system, which is quite common these days. Its very very much pocket friendly.
The total bill was Rs.490/-( including taxes)
and the striking choco avalanche was only Rs.100/-, would you believe that !!

**Overall -> An awesome place to hangout with friends and taste great food at a very purse-loving price :D
The service was quick and friendly. A lively place during the evening I'm sure :)
A definite reccomendation from me. :)

today after the classes decided to hit here as we had tried earlier this week bt it remains closed on monday:p..so me and my friends with Ak went here..the place is a small one with 6 to 7 tables yet a very innovative one and got the chair with the swing to sit...reallly had an awesome time here..and was amazed by the food which was real good..#rahul arora sir did an outstanding work..:)

we ordered for rose soda..and cold coffee with ice cream ..in the main course ordered for chicken pasta with mixed sauce which was tooooo delicious..and grilled chicken sandwich which was perfect...and the most mind blasting part is the choco avalanche..it was just "awesomee", out of this world..well i think all adjectivez will fall short for describing it...aaahh!heavenly..

the management people were very polite and cordial..And the most amazing thing is that the foos being so good it was very pocket friendly our bill came around rs.530..which was too economical..i found it to be the most reasonable cafe in south kolkata..and will be visiting it soon again.

The place is a bit cramped... reminiscent of the college days eatery joints. This place attracts a lot of college-going traffic, looking for a quick bite. the price is reasonable. However it does not come in the category of a fine-dining restaurant.
Ordered a takeaway: The pasta in white sauce was bland. Just some pasta boiled in white sauce and served without any garnishing. The veg sandwich was not upto the mark. And when I asked for sauce sachets along with my takeaway, they said they do not give them, which was a surprise.

This cafe tries it's best to make up for the cramped space with innovative decor. The tables are like swings as are some of the chairs. The food is of great quality. It is the haunt of couples and friends and definitely is frequented by the youth. The pasta and chocolate avalanche are too die for. It makes the best brownie I have ever had. If you are in for treating yourself or your loved ones this is the go to place.

I went there last sunday with my friends. The ambience is great with an open roof and the decor is amazing. But there is no air conditioning available which is quite disappointing and troublesome in kolkata's summer. The chocolate sundae is great as well as the cold coffee. We were highly dissapointed with the black forest pudding as it had nothing but oodles of whipped cream in it. The much-hyped chocolate avalanche on the other hand is something to die for. But I must warn you,you cannot eat it all on your own as the portion is enormous. Even attempting is dangerous.

A little difficult to find, but once found you can't forget the awesome food. Talking of the cafe, its basically a garage cafe and quite small in size. You have hanging tables which will would always keep you on tenterhooks to avoid coffee spills. But overall its quite compact. The place is non air conditioned. Now coming to the food its just heaven. We ordered coffee, pizza and chocolate avalanche. I must recommend all three. Being a pizza fan I in fact liked it more than a dominos pizza. The chocolate avalanche is a must try and you would observe what a 100 rupee note can buy you. Very much  recommended. Bon Appetite!!!!!

This is the sort of place you'd like to drop in for a while if you live in the area or happen to be in the vicinity. It's fitting for a little date with your friends. The seats are cozy albeit a little tiny. There is a single swinging chair that everyone if they've ever been little will want to grab. They should have more of those. 

The milkshakes are all quite good and reasonably priced too. As someone who is friends with a number of eggetarians, I was quite pleased with the 'egg-zo-tique' section of their menu.  The sandwiches and crepes, are passably good. A special mention is owed to their mushroom on toast. Barring the tiramisu, everything sweet on the menu is quite good especally the chocolate avalanche. There are not too many places serving good apple pie that is affordable to a student, Bon Appetit is one of them. 

Service is prompt. Also, this place smells like a cafe should-- of chocolate, coffee and baked goods. The staff have a separate section to themselves. I like the fact that they aren't overtly eager to serve you or ask for your opinion and just let you be for the most.

A little comfort place within the hustle and bustle. that is what i call this wonder of a place named Bon Appetit. Every time I visit this place become like a little kid fighting for that swing seat.(they should have more of that). anyways coming back to the food which makes it stand true to the title. Bon Appetit. having tried almost the whole menu i wonder which ones to mention. the sheer joy of nachos or the amazing salads, pizzas, pastas or the paradise that resides in each desert. the nachos and the topping, best thing that can even spice up a dull boring conversation. One thing i never miss is the spicy chicken salad. Oh Boy! its the perfect pleasure that the taste buds can indulge in. thin crust pizzas and the chicken paratha is worth mention too. 

For deserts, 'Name is Avalanche, Choco Avalanche'. The best thing created. you have to taste it to actually understand it. 

The decor, your own private garden tea party. Nothing beats that. cozy and comfortable. 
Great concept, great food plus light on pocket equals food lover's paradise... Charmant!!

Where does one start -  the unnecessarily loud jarring music in the morning, the slow service, the terrible omelettes, stale cakes?

We wanted to get some brunch on a  Sunday and were starving. Realizing that our orders could take a while we ordered a piece of walnut cake which was on the counter so we could begin eating something as we waited for the rest of the food. However we were made to wait 30 minutes, in spite of reminding them 3 times, all because they decided that a slice of walnut cake needed to be rewarmed, cut into small cubes each with a toothpick on it. A very sweet gesture for some I am sure but not after you've repeatedly told them to just hand out the cake.

The omelettes when they arrived, were swimming in oil and had chunks of hard boiled eggs in them. Nauseating comes to mind.

We didn't hang around to try the pancakes we had ordered and left. The staff were very sweet but so misguided and inefficient.

Unless you're 15 and looking for a place to get some cold coffee on a clandestine date, I would not frequent this establishment.

Tucked away in the bylanes of Hazra, It can be a little difficult to locate it. A little ahead of the Khalsa hotel in a lane on the left is where you spot Bon Appetit. This one certainly has a better interior than the one at Salt Lake. It has black and white checked flooring, an open roof and quite innovative dining concept. They've used the broad wooden swing as dining table and low black stools to go with it. On the other corner they the super comfy canvas swing and also dice themed stools with usual glass tables. 

The frame depicting Victoria Memorial on wall quite provides the place an aesthetic appeal.

As about food, I visit this place only for its CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE. 
If you suffer from chronic chocolate craving, this can be your ultimate saviour. 
It has vanilla ice cream, chocolate sticks (i hope your mouth isnt already watering ;) ) generous helping of chocolate sauce, warm brownie & Chocolate chips. :) While the normal one costs 100/- its eggless variant is priced at 145/- 

PS. They dont take orders at the table. You have to go and place your order. 
One suggestion - Play some good music to kill the monoronous feel.

So, my second visit to this particular outlet was much much much better than my previous one. 

The place was jam packed when we arrived. The particular table with the swing seemed to be in high demand. As soon as it got empty, someone or the other moved their. 

Anyway, as usual the place is congested and the seating isn't comfortable :P , the food this time was a revelation. 
We ordered for a mixed sauce pasta with corn and capsicum and the chocolate avalanche. 
One bite of the pasta and it became my favorite again. Yum is all I can say!
I literally licked off my bowl and then came the chocolate avalanche. Even though im not a desert person, this was... Uh, I don't think I need to go into the details for this ;) !
However one small complaint- we found some paper in the avalanche and let's hope this doesn't happen the next time. 

I am really keen on trying out their pizzas, Maggis & sandwiches. 
& this time, I'm sure I'll be coming back more often here :D



----- 07 Jun, 2013 -----

A put down when compared to the salt lake outlet 

The pizza is just cheese :/ and the location not desirable too. 
The interiors are nice but one expects an AC in this sultry weather. 

The waiters ain't interested in what's going on.. And didnt understand the concept of the swing type table .. Don't know why no one had complaints with that.. It keeps on moving and it's really difficult -_-

The place is congested too :3 you cannot really walk around if there are a lot of crowd.

Bon Appetit - A much much much better experience than the previous visit.
-------------
Brief:
I had visited with my brother on a fine evening as he wanted to eat good pasta. I thought Bon Appetit won't disappoint me this time. I am happy to say that this visit was much better than the last time. As soon as i entered, the properly dressed staffs with a lovely red colour cap cordially inviting you to Bon Appetit. As i gave my order of a Red Sauce Chicken pasta, i immediately went inside to look at the ambience. I found a lot of changes in the ambience. The above decorations of flowers and plants were superb and i must give all the credits to Mr. Rahul Arora. :) The diced chairs to sit along with the hanging tables on the different sides did increase the seating capacity along with the whole ambience. Not just that, the left lights while entering the place did make it somewhat unique in it's own way. :)
-------------
Food:

I had just had the Red Sauce chicken pasta with extra mushrooms inside (My brother eats it and i am not a big fan of mushroom). What i noticed about the pasta was that it was over cooked. However, the red sauce, chicken and the mushrooms were perfect. It somehow tasted really superb so it all makes up. 
-------------
Suggestions:

1) Lovely done interiors. However, the stepping floors should be cleaned on intervals.I 
2) Penne Pasta was over cooked. Don't know why this happened with me. 
3) The diced shaped seats were a good concept. However, it was little cramped for me to sit as all are just cluttured up.
-------------
Summary:

1) Food presentation 4/5
2) Food quality 4/5
3) Food quantity 4/5
4) Value for Money 4.5/5
5) Hospitality 3.5/5
6) Ambience 4.5/5
-------------
Conclusion:-

I don't know but this time i must say, my perceptions did change about this place. Would love to try out more dishes. :) Bon Appetit. :) I would love to visit the salt lake one as i am yet to visit it. Location help anyone? ;)


----- 04 Mar, 2014 -----

Bon appetit is a pay first and den get food later cafe. It has two branches as on now- one in salt lake and one in hazra. 
Place is decently decorated. 
Coming to the pros and cons

Pros :- 
1) Food is okay
2) ambience is very nice- a different concept totally 
3) staffs are polite
4) is decently decorated outside

Cons :- 
1) very small place. Hardly 4-5 tables to sit
2) food lacks quality 
3) I don't like this idea of first pay then eat concept. 
4) infrastructure of the place should be improved

Decent place to go with a friend or two. :)

A cosy fast food joint, with an artistic ambiance that serves amazing food at very cheap prices. 

Tried: Cheese Paratha, Veg Pasta in mixed sauce, Chocolate Avalanche

Loved: ALL

Special Mention: Cheese Paratha. It is the paratha equivalent for Domino's cheese burst pizza. Also, I'd go so far as to say that it is better than the pizza variant I talked about. Must try!

The chocolate avalanche is superb. A fresh take on the brownie ice cream combo. Tastes original, not like an effort to mimic the ice cream brownie variants available all around.

The pasta was great. But don't compare it to authentic Italian joints.

Service: 8/10
Ambiance: fit for brunches, and outings with friends. Couples would love it. Family groups would however not fit in quite well.

I will never question the food quality here but your staff needs to learn to how to cater to customers. The other day your cafe as usual was full. I entered, the guy at the cash counter told me that I would have to wait. A few minutes later two girls enter. To my utter dismal I find this same guy offering them seats even after seeing that I had been waiting.  Being a very regular customer I wouldn't expect such a treatment but after that day I honestly wouldn't want to visit again.

All praises for the valentines day menu from my end...
A fear of results coming out and spoiling my mood (which I hope it does not, fingers crossed) I forced a couple friend(note not a couple of friends :p, thus improper usage of the language on purpose ) to join me on my visit to bon appetit for the new menu.... Driven by my lust for spaghetti bolognaise I forced them along and three orders went in first....My spaghetti, My friend Sumit's attempt at crostini and Srijata's attempt at the chicken salami pizza.....
In order of arrival, chicken crostini was marvelous, a true beauty because the bread bit was too crunchy to be spoilt by the chicken mayo bell pepper combination on top... A marvel as the flavors were distinctly separate and was awesome....
My special spaghetti bolognaise came next.... Another marvel the sauce was awesome though both me and Sumit felt the portions of wine could be increased....Rahul explains the reason otherwise and since it is his caf√© I will let him reply to it separately...His suggestion was have the sauce without the spaghetti..... all in all a super hit...for that price it is awesome....AWE-FREAKING-SOME....The sauce the spaghetti and the perfect hint of oregano(if I am not wrong)....PAGLA
Chicken Salami pizza made us wait the most and probably ended up fastest....Have it I cannot explain how good it was...I believe Rahul has cameras installed so maybe if he checks he will be able to catch our reaction...IT was of surprise and delight...Am stunned....The cheese was awesome am not sure if it is the same one which goes into their other pizzas but this time it went so well with the sauce.....Yummy and the salamis were so so good and the basil was so prominent in taste am stunned......
Finally they wanted to leave as Srijata happened to be getting late but I was not ready to allow them to leave before we have tried out two cupcakes....
Srijata ordered cinnamon apple white cupcake(mini) and I ordered the strawberry cream one being the strawberry lover I am....Now Srijata's cupcake was first dug into literally since we shared the mini cupcakes between 3 people each...It was pretty good but when I dug into mine it overshadowed the one she had ordered by miles and that is a real appreciation as since I love strawberry cream I am very particular about it being perfect so all praises really.... I being the hyangla I am started licking the cupcake liners...Two girls gaped at me and started laughing from an opposite table...To hell with you I thought...If you have not licked the linrs in cupcakes or the ice cream covers over cup or cone ice creams...You have never loved it...And love it I did.....
Was leaving but stopped ordered another mini strawberry cupcake for the roads.....
Am going to make another visit if everything goes according to plan....to try out the rice bowl and the keema do piazza pizza....and the other 2 cupcakes also....If my marks don't come out better still if they are good...Lets pray for the latter one now
Rahul GRAND SALUTE!!!!!!
I plan to go back as soon as possible for the rice bowl and the keema do piyaza pizza but lets see what fate holds in store.....



----- 10 Jun, 2013 -----

Mr. Rahul clearly on my last review you had misunderstood parts of my claim but since I did not have a reason to reply back via another review I did not write back. This place happens to be one of my personal favourite as I had already told and I kept on visiting it and did not go for the pasta any more till day before yesterday and I mean the 8th of June. 

Now firstly I would like to clarify few of my points in my last review the comparison to C.C.D  was meant to compare brand names and the fact that an outlet which takes around 50 lakhs just for the machinery and training and brand name. For something like that if they can give food at that range then why not Bon Apetite was my question. I by no means meant they are better or that their quality is even at comparable terms. FYI I do not even have sandwiches anymore at CCD while at one time used to love their Garlic Chicken Sandwich. Nowadays it feels like a baker and confectioner shop food to me. It is just that I felt it could have been kept cheaper and a proof of that can be Kafe Bindaas or Cafela again a point to note is that am not comparing quality out here.

When you said you were trying to revive the cafe culture I had to ask you does your food actually go in sync with the cafe culture of Kolkata in coffee house dilkhush cabin or is it in the same range nor at all the decor so it is two different things you are comparing and definitely the ac is more comfortable in this weather especially with your ceiling not totally enclosed and has an asbestos sheet or fibre glass( I do not know what and you need to simply understand that those tend to get warm faster. Even if it does not maybe you could have closed walls on all sides at least. Your new chairs are no good an option either because its backrest does not support my big frame :P. Maybe you could have either increased the space somehow or reduced the seats and brought in better chairs as I clearly do not have a problem in sitting in your saltlake outlet.

Of all things did not like the pasta again. It was very sticky and I for once do not understand why you of everyone else would allow your staff to serve us chicken pasta filled with bones. The bones were a menace and the chicken was shredded and cut into long pieces. I thought and also felt diced chicken pieces are better without bones. I still have a picture just in case you do not believe me but the clarity of the pic is  not good enough. If you still want it please reply back with your e mail id and I will send a pic of both the bill and the number of bones we found in your pasta. I feel chicken pasta should not have bones but then it is your personal choice.
However it can never stop me from visiting because yes you do serve awesomely yummy food and a nice decor. Had the seating been more comfortable I would still love it. However as always liked the mango shake though I felt the spicy chicken salad could have had more quantity in it. Maybe you can use some weight or something to standardize the quantity if you already do not have such means of standardizing the quantity. Oh and after seeing a previous review I remembered I too did not like the ice tea and am sorry I did not no matter how many you sell its my choice as you put it in your last reply.

Also the swinging tables are nice for a change but cumbersome especially when am hungry and want to gulp down the food and the table keeps moving. Though had there been some more space it would have been easier I guess not sure about that though but less chairs could surely help.



----- 14 Mar, 2013 -----

Firstly the negatives, that is why, I rated this truly awesome place as 3.5 and not more.
From a regular at Bon Appetit in Salt Lake near 4 No. Tank to Hazra...The decor is similar. However one must have expected the owner to have come up with a more spacious cafe at it's next outlet(looking, hoping and praying I get one, on their next outlet, if they come up with any.)
The seats are too small for big foodies like us and only recently have they come up with a few backrest chairs, but even then, the seats are too small and so not comfortable. The place definitely needs an A.C. which is again something they did not learn and change and from their previous outlet.
In food I did not like their Chicken Pizza or the Pasta nor the Chicken Hawaiian  Salad which had too much olives and Jalapeno(if I am not wrong) make it more sour than wanted.The pizza and the Pasta were just fine nothing good to mention. I have had better at cheaper rates.
The sandwiches are pretty good but at a bit high price....Nowadays even C.C.D has come up with sandwiches at cheaper rates. 
The positives now...An awesome place to hangout with friends(I still want better chairs with backrest) good cozy feel, nice decor as expected and the fact that it has good books to read while you are there is a bonus just in case you are bored and wanted to drop by a cafe and spend some time by yourself. The staff are very amiable and friendly and they know there food well(something both the outlets have offered). 
It is like your very own "rock-er adda" at a bit more decorated but of course costly setting. The feel is that comfortable. The swing is a good addition too.
The food which is very important are pretty good if you know what to order...The eggs used to be very good did not have it at this outlet though. The mushroom dishes are my favorites but then I felt maybe they have a bit too much cheese in everything. They could maybe come up with a few less fatty food items along with it. I love there wai wai, parathas and the pancakes in every flavour. The only thing yet to be tried out are the fondue and pita which are just next on my list.
Try nearly anything from the sweet temptation they are all very good but my favourite is still the blueberry cheesecake....though I have forgotten the avalanche and the chocolate fondue but I am yet to try out any Sundae. I am a bit skeptical about trying the tiramisu too so I left it out.
In all a definitely good place to visit and if they make the seating arrangement a bit more comfortable I will continue visiting this place . Its been nearly 3-4 times in the last one month.

The first thing which comes to my mind about BON APPETIT is the pizza. I loves their pizzas and can easily say that it is lot better than Domino's or Pizza Hut's. Then comes the pastas,salads, pita pocket and other food. All your food items are just YUMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. 
The Brownie is awesome, BON APPETIT makes the best brownie, that also eggless. Everybody should try that once and the chocolate avalange.
I have been going to this place for about a year, and always find the food to be freshly made and tasty.
The waiters, chefs and all others working are very polite and always welcome you with a smile. Especially , SURO, who deserves a special mention as he customizes the dishes to my taste, accordingly and manages the crowd well and is always polite and smiling.
The decor of the cafe is cute, specially the swinging tables.
The only problem, now a days I have to wait for tables to get empty :(

KUDOS, to the management of BON APPETIT and RAHUL.

I recently tried out the Valentine's week special menu at Bon Appetit, and had to go back for more. My eyes were on the Chicken Mushroom Quiche, Chicken Rice Bowl and the Three Pepper and Babycorn Pizza. I was also tempted into ordering the Keema Do Pyaaza pizza. The chicken mushroom quiche was packed with tender bites of chicken and mushrooms. 

The rice bowl had basmati rice at the bottom, topped with salsa, cheese sauce, chicken bites,  refried beans and covered with crushed nachos. I loved the beans and the dish was very filling and satisfying. The three-pepper babycorn pizza was spicy and had a thin, crunchy crust. It was a bit too spicy for my friend. The Keema do Pyaaza came with a lot of keema and cheese on it, which I liked a lot too.

For desserts, I wanted the chocolate caramel crunch cupcake. It was very chocolate-y, for the lack of a better word, with chocolate sauce and butterscotch bits in it which adds to the crunch factor.



----- 04 Nov, 2012 -----

Love this place. The decor is really relaxed and laid back, the coffee is well-made, and there are specials virtually every Sunday. The food is really fresh and tasty, especially the Mushrooms on Toast and the Chicken Club sandwiches. I also adore the iced teas served here.

Not my cup of tea!

Had a revolting pasta here. My friend ordered a hot chocolate which she could not finish. The hand beaten coffee I had was okay. The ambience is tacky. Drinking water is self-service! Bollywood numbers playing. This place is not worth visiting. Kind of flummoxed by the rave ratings on Zomato.

" Bon Appetit - A Place where I was satisfied with a good appetite. "
As I walked into Bon Appetit, the first thing that caught my attention was the decor. It is the most interesting decor I have seen in Calcutta. The unique thing about the decor is that all the 4 walls surrounding it are coloured differently. From the light bulbs on one side ; to the mustard colour wall with interesting pictures; from the bright red and white tiles on one side to the stones and pebbles on one of the sides, the place is contrasting with a varied range of colours which was a first for me. The corridor leading to it is also laden with chairs which houses magazines and books. Interesting concept. 
Next, the place has some swings serving as tables and dice shaped chairs with the quintessential black and white adding the sober touch to the colours surrounding it. Lets come straight to the food now.
The Tomato cheese mixed Pasta was nice in its taste. The Nachos with cheese and Salsa Dip was delectable and kudos to the Salsa dip which perfectly complemented the crispy nachos. The Mushroom Wai Wai was very well made and made me wanting more. Finally, the Olive Corn Capsicum Pizza was cheesy and lip-smacking. I thoroughly enjoyed the food with a Lemon Ice Tea which was subtle in its taste and light.
The best part about the place apart from the price was its service. It was lightening quick. The waiters were nice and polite and the little boy that served us always said "Thank You" with a sweet smile. A Big Thumbs up for its service. So here is my Overall Food Quotient.
Price - 9/10,
Service - 10/10
Food - 8/10
Ambience - 7.5/10.
So one should definitely visit this place for its exemplary service and good food. Looking forward to visit the place again and will surely have the variety of desserts next time as well.

Okay I had been passing the Saltlake outlet quite frequently and had visited that one 2-3 times. Although I liked the food served there I was not a fan of the decor and ambiance. The place is mostly frequented by teenagers and the furniture is worn out (tables are skewed and shaking). But this is a different story altogether!!! The seating arrangement is quite unique and quirky with swings serving as tables. The chairs are low and make you huddle on the table which is a perfect posture for adda!!! the food is very reasonably price and portions are generous (this goes for both the outlets). for less than 200 bucks you can have your tummy full and your mood brightened. Their cheese stuff is just muuuuaaaaah!!! the cheese paratha is at the same time filling and satisfying. The grilled cheese sandwich is the perfect comfort food. They have taken maggi and wai wai to different culinary level. I love all the preparations of Maggi. Milkshakes are thick but on the sweeter side. The hand beaten coffee is fun too. 
Overall, I love this outlet and wished that we had it 10 yrs age when we were going to Asutosh so that our off periods would have been heavenly!!!

I had been to the Salt Lake outlet of this cafe and had loved it. Hence decided to check out this one for desserts after having had lunch nearby. The decor was just as good....gives a homely feel. Absolutely adorable ! We sat at one of the swinging tables....it was fun, to say the least. We ordered a Passion Fruit Iced Tea and a Mango Shake. The drinks were nice and refreshing....served in cute glasses. Maybe a tad bit on the sweeter side. We had ordered the Fudge Slice and the Chocolate Avalanche for desserts. The fudge did not wow me at all....it seemed very dry and just a spoonful of chocolate sauce poured on top of it didn't help much. What did impress was the Chocolate Avalanche....just as good as I remembered ! The cake, the chocolate and vanilla ice cream, doused in chocolate sauce is simply yummy....n yes, the Chocolate chips ! It's a heavy dessert....perfect for a chocolate lover like myself.
Overall, a great place to hangout. 4 stars from me. :)

My second visit to Bon Appetit was a thousand times better than the last one. There was no room for complaint about service delays as it was rather quick.

This time I had an Egg Cheese Sandwich which simply blew me away. Cheesy(no pun intended),tasty and filled with the heavenly taste of poached eggs folded in oregano and paprika... Too yummy for words! The chips along with it and two sandwiches ensure you have a happy tummy.

I also had a taste of the Apple Pie, which was disappointing, I thought as it was too cinnamon-y and had too much of raisins(something which I don't like).

The perfect place for a date or some me-time. Suit yourself.

Long live Bon Appetit. Long live inexpensive yet delicious food. Ciao.

----- 09 Oct, 2013 -----

There's no AC,but the small fans make up for it. The food tastes insanely good and is in generous portions. Service is really slow but I guess,it depends on the items ordered.I had to wait for close to an hour for one 8 inch pizza,but desserts and pasta are brought pretty fast.¬†

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich tastes heavenly. The shredded chicken bits are larger than just "bits" and there's enough mayo flavored with oregano and black pepper, to drip at each bite. Coupled with the potato chips, it makes for some really tasty lunch.¬†

Next up was the dessert. Chocolate Avalanche. I found it a bit too chocolaty and the brownies tasted a bit stale to me. There was too much chocolate, as evident from the name, but it kinda tasted like Bourn Vita.

Myself a self confessed foodie with an obsession for comfort food creamy coffees, mayo loaded sandwich, i really found my bliss of solitude in this nook off the Hazra Road. The chequer board tiles decor can be called a combination of Neo Classical (with hanging vines for a classical feel) with funk elements Marilyn Monroe and Elvis frames thrown in for a surprise twist, it really stimulates the mind to unwind and relax. Really find the decor of the place so good than the drab ol' seatings of CCD & Barista z. Using a swing as table was really something i didnt ever think of. The use of polished framed steel as mirrors added an element of warping and fun distortion. 

Coming to food, we found ourselves gorging on grilled chicken sandwich coupled with hand beaten coffee and Honey Lemon tea. a good start indeed. The sandwich contained just the perfect blend of honey mustard, mayo and grilled chicken enveloped in brown bread. Next on the table was Chicken Seekh Onion Tomato pizza, the thin crust variant. The thin crust baked bread  perfect compliment to then smooth texture of the oodles of cheeze, slightly charred tomatoes, black olives. In an ambiance like this and soothing comfort on the pallette as well as the pocket (no VAT, Service Tax charge), interesting conversations can start and many a hearts can melt. Just like what we had next in front of us, chocolate fondue, molten gooey chocolate, thick and strong, and walnut cake and dark chocolate cake for dipping. 

Awesome, that would be a cliche word to describe the experience. Innovative, conversation starter food and decor and never to forget the smiling cheerful attitude of the staff which makes one immediately feel a nice warm comfort as we had the last evening.

I fail to understand why people in Kolkata of all cities are complaining about finding it hard to locate the HAZRA outlet.. for God's sake just take a LEFT TURN FROM PARAMOUNT HOSPITAL [and use precious Google maps if you are truly that clueless] and walk down straight. There is a cigarette shop up ahead, take a left after it, if you are clueless, use your eyes and note the "Sign" that clearly has "Bon Appetit" written on it. walk down straight and take the first left... Voila! You have found the cafe. In this era of smartphones, i am surprised that one is this incapable of following basic directions, LOL. 

The food is excellent as always and the new range of pizzas are out of this world. This is due to the fact that every aspect of the pizza has been made fresh by the cafe. There is no thick-store bought crust and no store-bought base. I would recommend all the pizzas. The price is reasonable and will appeal to those on a budget. 

In terms of snacks, a customer can easily request additions or omissions of various aspects of the sandwiches and pastas on offer. The cafe owner himself is approachable and will recommend items if one is confused. I am personally very fond of the cheesy cheese toast, which is indeed, the cheesiest one i have ever eaten. The pancakes are light and the drinks, especially the thick chocolate shake make a great treat for when you have those sugar cravings which need to be satiated immediately. 

For those who whine about needing air-conditioning, please visit an establishment which will make you "pay" for it. Bon Appetit is for people who appreciate food and have limited spending power. I would rather starve than visit an overpriced air-conditioned establishment that serves cardboard flavored food. Comparing Bon Appetit to ccd is just rubbish. So please, don't embarrass yourselves.

We could not find this place at first. But then one friend directed us. We saw tiny direction board and followed it and reached. We were happy to see the cosy cafe which was very nice decorated. Ordered the chicken sandwich and the pizza with chicken and capsicum. Both were super our tongues were singing with the taste. We also ordered coffee and it was yummy.

Firstly, I'd like to congratulate Rahul Arora for successfully establishing such a beautiful cafe. The interiors are all nicely done up. There's a narrow lane which opens up into the cafe. It is decorated with books, and mugs, pictures etc. Pretty.
I remember going to Bon Appetit (Salt Lake) in my school days. That branch is comparatively smaller. And this is very very pretty! :D

The inside of the cafe is beautiful. We had gone there for a shoot and the staff were very very helpful. We needed different shots for the and they very patiently were helping us out. Didnt even complain once :P
Hospitality is great.

So, we were a hungry bunch of 8 and we quickly ordered coffee mocha, egg n cheese sandwich, mushrooom pasta, corn n cheese crepe, chocolate explosion and chocolate mousse.

The mocha was delicious. Just. The chocolate vermicelli on top tasted so good.

The egg n cheese sandwich was absolutely delicious and filling. I love the fact that these people are cheeeeesy! :D

But, the show stealer was the crepe. Delicately made and topped with oodles of cheese, the crepe was lipsmacking!
The pasta was slightly tomato-ish and tangy. Big penne pasta to the rescue of the grumbling tummy. It was very good.

And the desserts were completely out of this world. They were just sinful. Mmm.
The best chocolate mousse I have ever tasted.

For a quick or a HUGE bite at a pocket friendly price, Bon Appetit at your service.
I'm so definitely going back for more.

Happy  eating guys, Cheers!
Bon Appetit! :)

I had long awaited the opening of an outlet of Bon Appetit down south, after I visited the Salt lake outlet. It was not the same overwhelming experience.

I have visited the place around 3-4 times but I must say that the only thing that appeals to me is the set-up. The seats are a tad uncomfortable and a little small for the average built man.

Coming to the food, the taste lacks quite a lot. The food is bland. Except for the Stuffed Pita Pocket & Cheese Maggi, I cannot recollect another notable dish. The Salt Lake outlet had some super Nachos, Cheese Paratha & Cheese Pasta but the Hazra outlet disappoints in this regard.

The salads, shakes and sodas taste just fine.

The all-time legendary Chocolate Avalanche was the biggest disappointment. The mousse has been reduced to nothing. All that I found in the dish was Vanilla ice-cream, chocolate sauce & choco-chips. Not only once, it was so on all occasions.

Overall, the management could seek to improve on some lines. I wish to have the same experience as that of the Salt Lake outlet.

I had wanted to visit this cafe for a long time now. But everytime I ask my friend who knows the place, to take me there for lunch on a weekend she looks at me and says in a calm voice that I will never get a seat on a weekend afternoon. Then last Friday I got a  leave. The moment I found out about it I told her that we are going to Bon Apetit and nowhere else. One of my other friends also joined us and three of us ended up in the lane beside Hazra Crossing at around 3 p.m. 

The entrance is tiny and a narrow passage leads to a funky chic little paradise. The brick wall on the right, the light installed huge black door on the left , and the checkerboard floor gives a rock chic vibe to the place. The grapes and vines that adorn the open ceiling, the lanterns that hang from amidst the vines adds a softer more feminine touch to the place. Also the place has a swing inside it. How cool is that !! But yes, one thing that I must say is that this place would get rather hot in the summer. Maybe adding some indigenous innovative ways of keeping the place cool might help.

Now coming to the food. For starters we ordered the tacos. They were okay, not bad, but not exceptional. I had requested the servers to put in extra spicy salsa which probably they misinterpreted and gave us extra cheese sauce. My friends ordered the chicken paratha and corn and spinach sandwich while I ordered the chicken sausage and jalapeno pizza. The chicken paratha was served with curd and pickled onions. The warm paratha wrapped around the pickled onions and dipped in the cold curd is my definition of a perfect bite. I was a little curious as to why my strictly non-veg friend have ordered the veg sandwich. One bite and I knew why. It was very very good. But my pizza was the star of the show. Thin crunchy crust with adequate amount of cheese and tomato sauce topped with generous amount of chicken sausages and jalapenos.  Just writing the description is making me salivate. It is how I like my food. Simple, uncomplicated, flavourful and delicious. We washed our food off with the zangy ginger fizz.

Special mention to the book rack stacked with some of my favorite books near the entrance.

I am deducting 0.5 points because I feel that the servers could be a bit more attentive.

Went to this place with my mom for a girls' day out and it was a great experience! Firstly, the decor was unique and nothing we had ever seen before..A quaint swing was there in a corner..very inviting. The food was really good. We ordered the chicken club and grilled chicken sandwiches and we were SHOCKED by the size! My first bite could hardly put the whole thing in my mouth, with a thick layer of creamy coleslaw and a second layer of tasty chicken in the club sandwich. Along with that, I ordered the Midnight cookie shake, which was absolutely delicious. Thick cold and chunks of chocolate cookie in every sip. The staff were very friendly and helpful. If there had to be ONE suggestion, I wish they would stock cold mineral water bottles. But otherwise, just a perfect place for a quick bite or even a lazy catching up session with friends and close family.

Located in a galli on hazra road bon appetit the cafe is the second outlet from the franchisee.I happened to visit this place only last week and was deeply dissapointed in the mixed sauce pasta.Cold and tasteless and filled with onions we decided to not complete the dish.And i would also say the quality of food has gone down.I am pretty sure the chocolate avalache i was served had bits of britannia cake and not brownie as earlier was served in this dessert!Shocked and disappointed.Also amazed to see an 11 yr old kid working as a waiter here ,waiting tables and cleaning the mess.I used to love bon appetit.Seriously disappointed!

a cosy itsy-bitsy cafe situated 2min walk from hazra or j.d metro inside a small typical old kolkata galli. it is picturesquely decorated inside a "dalan of an old house. its contemporary skillful design provides sufficient place for 10 tables( 2 of them are hanging).
the menu includes italian and mexican dishes besides regular tea coffee sodas and shakes. all of them are cut priced with chicken pastas 130 a plate. though m not a chocolate freak but i fell in love with its chocolate avalanche. its warm yet cold with salving chocolate.i would recommend this item to everyone,its a must try even for the foodies who are not fond of sweets.
 they have few amiable staffs who can properly guide you through the menu. i will give them 0.5 less from 5 only because its a non a.c.

Being one of the very first customers to visit Bon Appetit and a regular ever since, I feel happy to be writing a review for My cafe ! 

For me, what sets the place apart is the genuine passion with which Bon Appetit has been built.. Rahul Arora, the owner of the cafe is first and foremost a great chef and true foodie at heart and a business owner second. He still likes to spend more time COOKING rather than thinking of new ways to squeeze more profit out of his cafes ! Unlike most other cafes which are just commercial establishments, Bon Appetit actually has a heart and a soul.       

Its a cozy, charming little place with quirky bohemian interiors a relaxed and personal atmosphere, an eclectic mix of dishes on offer, delicious food with generous portions and yet it remains inexpensive while not compromising on quality. The staff is friendly and cordial and accommodates your specific tastes and preferences while preparing the dishes. 

If you are looking for a place to spend some time with your friends in a relaxed yet fun and vibrant place, while having something interesting, tasty and different from the usual to eat and drink (and a lot of variety so that you always have something different to try every time you go), friendly bunch of people to serve you make you feel at home at prices that don't burn a hole in your pocket,  Bon Appetit is the place to come !

i find the decor of this tiny place  amazingly cute and colourful ! perfect for young couples, students  and off course friends! i say 'students' coz the prices are very reasonable as per the quantity of food,moreover all prices are inclusive of taxes.yes i admit the swinging tables are bit different and rather makes eating difficult,but altogether gives a unique look! it lacks a.c. but the overall decoration including the colourful walls, various hanging lamps, wall hanging photographs,checkered floor and the ground glass roof makes for it.
chocolate avalanche at 100 bucks is must have here.
its basicaly  almost double sized  chocolate brownie served with scoops of vanilla icecream,topped with flooding amount of chocolate sauce and choco chips. heaven for chocaholics! its too much for one,can be shared by 2 or even three persons.much reasonable when compared to the regular ccd n barista temptations.
today i ordered pancake with mushroom and cheese sauce. it was disastrous. it was too cheesy,and something was wrong with it.the chips with it were very oily.both of us struggled to consume half of it just for sake of the money we already paid, but could not help much. this item is definitely not my recommendation.
nevertheless i love avalanche,do try it !

But the things which I ordered really disappointed me... speacially the garlic bread.. the breads were stiff , cheese was not melting in mouth. Chicken pasta was also very very ordinary!!!!!!!! pita pockets with corn salsa was worse... the corns were not tender, the gravy tasted near tomato ketchup!!!

The first that comes to my mind regarding this cafe is it's extremely uncomfortable seating. And the swinging tables are extremely impractical as having food on such a contraption is a hassle. The food (I ordered a plate of nachos and a brownie) and quite good but a bit overpriced. Bon Appetit has a friendly staff and reasonably tasty food- But it lacks the WOW factor. That being said, lt is definitely worth visiting at least once.

I visited this place after reading some good reviews on Zomato. I have mixed feelings about this place. The interiors are decent enough, but the seating is a bit uncomfortable. The swinging tables look nice, but are extremely annoying if you're actually looking to eat something. 

I ordered a chicken and tomato crepe and an ice tea. Both were decent, nothing great.
I personally liked Bon Appetit more than the CCD's and the Barista's of the city. However, there's no one single thing about the place which I can pick out as really special.

The interiors are interesting and really cosy. I tried the chicken pita pocket and garlic bread with cheese fondue. The fondue was overpriced but the food was pretty decent. The chicken stuffing in the pita pocket was overflowing in a good, generous serving kind of way. Cold coffee with icecream tasted decent though I have a feeling they use Nescafe instant coffee. Service was on the shoddy side but not unpleasant. They were courteous. You do have to pay first at the time of ordering which for a small place like this seems unnecessary. People complain about the small size of the cafe but I think that's part of the uniqueness about this place. It's kinda open like a patio-alfresco-garden type cafe and not airconditioned, but is well shaded and we were pretty comfortable on a fairly warm and humid day. Do go with your partner or in a small group for an adda. Don't be mad if it's already full when you reach.

First things first: the decoration of the cafe is wow!

The people running the establishment is very helpful and gives correct suggestions.

About the food: it is good. But quantity (I believe) should be a bit more. I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and found it to be very tasty. Washed it down with Ginger Fizz Soda. The soda, however, can be prepared better.

Then again, the cafe has a certain attraction and hits all the right buttons..

Even though the place isn't air conditioned but one definitely doesn't feel warm. The staff is friendly, food is mind blowing. Mix sauce pasta,  chilli cheese sandwich chocolate avalanche, cheese paratha are a few amazing delicacies to be named. Nonetheless the list is huge. I have been here with friends and family and everyone has always left with a smile on their face. With very reasonable rates and decent ambience one should definitely try this cafe.

One thing which i don't like about the place is its chairs which are too small,one cannot sit and relax. I ordered cheese fondue and corn salad with green tea ,the cheese fondue was yum and the green tea was refreshing.I wished the place was less congested.Over all a good experience will be visiting again :)

5 Stars for the food...everything on the menu is great.Mushroom on toast..Pasta..spicy chkn pita...nachos..Chkn cheese s/w..Cheese paratha..Choco avalanche..everything was brilliant and above expectation.

However what was lacking was the service in the seating area. It was as if it is a purely take away place and the staff have got nothing to do with the area inside.
Providing cutlery or hand tissues are the most basic as well as water which should be provided inside at the eating area.Sodas like green apple and melon were bland.

Just a feedback,though we will keep coming back for the food,because that is supreme.

Dropped in to Bon Appetit, Hazra with a couple of friends after finding so many positive reviews online. First off, yes it is tucked away in a bylane and may be difficult to find for the first time. However, once inside I was pleasantly surprised by the offbeat funky interiors. Very very thoughtful. However the seating was extremely uncomfortable and the humid summer days make it even more so, due to the lack of AC.

It does seem that the majority of the crowd is comprised of school and college students, so putting up an AC may not be feasible at the current rates.

Coming to the food - We ordered a Chicken Pasta in white sauce, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Chocolate Avalanche and a Blueberry Iced Tea.

The Pasta was delicious, and the sole reason was the quality white sauce put into it. But alas, we were left searching for chicken pieces in the dish. There was hardly any, and were more like some remains, and not pieces. Only chink in the otherwise decent pasta.

The grilled chicken sandwich was good too, however there was no dip/ketchup accompanying on the table with it.

The Blueberry Iced Tea left me wondering why is it called Iced Tea at all? It was more like blueberry flavored water with a couple of small ice cubes thrown in. Bland and pathetic I say! 

The Chocolate Avalanche was another disappointment. It took forever to come, but the wait wasnt worth it. The avalanche was very basic, not even the proper avalanche. Probably the first time I didnt like a scoop of vanilla icecream! It tasted very artificial and mediocre. We really do not know what took so much time to come up with this ghastly desert. 

Guests are not even offered a simple glass of water. When asked for some, we were handed over water in two used Pepsi pet bottles!!!! Yuck!!! This is absolutely not acceptable.

Guys, you have a nice little cafe, and I am sure you have the potential to work out some of these basic flaws. Small little things go a long way to build up trust and loyalty!

To begin with, the place is a little difficult to find - however, the owner was very helpful in directing us to the cafe. FYI, this is bang behind Paramount Hospital on Hazra.

The interiors are nice and cozy - though it needs much better maintenance (most of the tables were dirty and the floor littered with napkins). It was pleasant when I made a visit in March, but I guess it would be quite stuffy in the Kolkata summers without air-conditioning.

The menu was interesting enough and kudos to the owners for keeping the prices reasonable. I ordered a black coffee and a pasta. I was not happy to see hair strands in the pasta. What really irked me was the fact that the staff was super unhelpful. I had asked the server to leave room for milk in the coffee, which he did not. The staff rectified this by providing me with a teaspoon to take out the extra coffee into an absurd little plate (picture attached)! When I pointed out the problem at hand, they asked me to deal with the issue myself. Shocking behavior!

Given the laid-back atmosphere, I would like to frequent Bon Appetit quite frequently, but the untrained staff do not provide for a pleasant experience.

In two words if I had to describe this place I would say simply brilliant. Everyone in their review wrote it is very difficult to locate the place if you are going for the first time so I took up the challenge of reaching the place without any difficulty. Well let me tell you if you follow the map and the detailed directions given by Zomato you will never get lost. It is very accurate and easy to follow. The place looks quite attractive and the interiors are very innovative and stylish I must admit. The swinging chairs are quite cool. The pricing is very decent and you can visit this place frequently. 
I loved the simple cold coffee, mexican corn salad and the chocolate sundae is delicious and mouth watering. I am sure the other dishes are equally tasty and scrumptious. 
I would rate this place 4 and would visit this place again and again with my friends and family to have a relaxing and enjoyable meal.

BON APPETIT is a neat cafe nestled at a lane at Hazra. It enjoys the privilege of being centrally located and yet is away from the hustle and bustle of the main road.
 
I have been visiting the cafe for about six months now. The staff is friendly , food is lip smacking and prices are reasonable.

A wide variety  of food and beverages are served . Those visiting the Cafe on Sundays (like me) , enjoy the Sunday special menu.

My favourite is the Wai Wai/ Maggie made in a variety of different ways, ranging from the Thai style to Indian Spicy.

Yes , and not to forget the innovative and quirky ambience , quite a refreshing change from the drab look of several other cafes .

Overall it gives this city a great hang out joint !

what makes BON APPETIT so special that it stands out amongst so many cafe's in the city. Besides the food , which in itself is a gastronomical delight , with perfect taste and flavours, but it is the essence of the place that reflects in it's courteous and prompt staff , the decor , the ambience , all of which create a perfect blend for you to enjoy those precious fun moments with your friends , lover or family.

Awright so here we go, Bon Appetit is the kinda place where you can relax, feed not only your tummy but your soul. The place has got the qualities like HABIT FORMING kinda, once you are there, ate, and man you wont be able to go anywhere else; I can bet my last penny on that. I LOVE THE FOOOOD and drinks too, and the owner, the decor, the ambiance. Guys you wont find any place other than Bon Appetit to unwind and be relaxed; chit-chat, eat-drink, and be merry. Starting from paranthas to cakes to mousse to my fav green apple soda, the menu goes on like vroooommmm,...go there and satiate your soul.  Bon Appetit all the way (y)

If a quirky, charming cafe is what you are looking for, look no further. Bon App (as I shall fondly call it henceforth) is tiny, but never cramped for space. I had heard the best things about Bon Appetit, Salt Lake from my friends for the longest time and was not disappointed when I took a long over due trip to its Hazra outlet which remains tons more convenient, location-wise. It's a short walk from Jatin Das Park Metro station, inside a twisting, quiet alley - a welcome break from the bustling city outside. 
There is a swing - an actual cane swing hanging from the ceiling in a corner! Add to that hanging tables, vintage checkered floor, quaint lanterns hanging from the ceiling - I was sold! It's always nice to come across a place that pays attention to detail. Even better, if they give you the option to flip through their relatively wide variety of books, comics and magazines (Very Grateful for the Archies!) as you wait for your food to arrive. Oh and did I mention Pop Art on the walls?  
Now, about the food on offer:
Nachos: The best I've had in the longest time. Slathered with generous amounts of cheese, salsa, jalapenos and black olives(!), it has managed to become a staple; I order it every time I come here.

Sandwiches: Chicken coleslaw is wonderful, and sneakily filling. Steer clear if you want to overindulge in the dessert section (which you will, inevitably). I liked that they did not forget to add crisps on the side. 

Pasta Salad: I loved the Hawaiian Chicken, but would have liked a little less Mayo, and a little more pineapple, but otherwise, quite nice. Macaroni is standard but I found myself eyeing their condiments wistfully(chilli flakes, oregano).  

Shakes: The exotic shakes are good. Very rich, very filling but totally worth it. The Black Forest is creamy, served with whipped cream, thinly sliced cake and a cherry on top. Mint Chocolate Chip is rather unpredictable because the consistency and amounts of cream and chocolate chips varied quite a bit the two times I tried it. Malt Mania is your usual cold coffee, but with (you guessed it), extra whipped cream. 

Dessert: *drumroll* Blueberry cheesecake was creamy, luscious, tart and sweet in equal parts - everything that a good cheesecake should be. The portion sizes (think big!) were a bonus. Apple Pie, while it promisingly smelled of cinnamon and was served with cream on the side, was hard and cold and required massive amounts of effort to cut through. Nutella pancakes are gorgeous! So fluffy and light, served warm with cinnamon cream, it was a meal by itself. And finally, Chocolate avalanche! Brownie+Hot Chocolate fudge+ multiple scoops of ice cream+chocolate sticks - it was gloriously sinful and sent expectations through the roof! 

Prices are extremely affordable and the ambiance chilled out. The smell of freshly baked goods don't hurt either. My friend and I both thought a breakfast option could do wonders for this place, same with a larger seating area to accommodate bigger crowds, as I completely intend to bring a larger group here in the near future. I personally took three trips to Bon App in one week. Keep up the good work! You guys have made me a loyalist.

BON APPETIT - THE CAFE, is one of our favorite joints.. at times my friends & I spend hours there just trying out most of the amazingly delicious dishes... one of my favorite dishes is the Chicken Egg Crepe Parcel ... it looks like a simple dish but oozes out with cheese... yumm.. the mushroom dishes are to die for as well.. and above all they ALL are reasonably priced... A perfect place to unwind & hog wth a close group of friends!!

Very small place but a great endeavour from the entrepreneur :)

Saw this place often and decided to drop in one fine day. Small place but nice decor. Would have liked better seating but what the heck! goes with the theme of the place i guess.

Being a hard core non veg, i loved the eggsotic omlette- not overcooked, just about right. The chicken club sandwich was fresh and bang for the buck. At such prices couldnt complain!

Although, word on the street is that the place came up after shutting down a thriving montessori play school in the same premises. On the way out, i did notice some remnants of that school-- the drawings on the exterior walls! 
Sad, In this world commerce always triumphs education!

But hey.. the place is great for a quiet pick me upper!! give it a try.

Bon Appetit is one place that I have been visiting for the last three years...their first outlet in Salt Lake was one of the few real cafes in the city. With a lip smacking menu and a quirky yet soothing decor, Bon Appetit has been a treat in more ways than one and their second outlet at Hazra too is as eye catching .  

I have tried the Hawaiian Chicken salad which is quite yum.. not too much of a fan of the pizza though (we tried the chicken pizza), the egg and cheese grilled sandwich is also quite tasty as is the fruit compote pancake. 

The chocolate avalanche is one of the best items on the menu..and so filling that three of us could not finish it..
Cheese lovers alert: Do try their cheese paratha and their Chilli Cheese sandwich ( Its Drool worthy!)

Very difficult to spot if you are a first timer. Me and my friend went round and round around Hazra before finally getting out of the car and hunting it down. It would help if there was a visible signboard outside the lane.

As we go in, I am pleasantly surprised as its a small but well put up place, nicely decorated with good decor although they could do with better seating arrangement. We took a seat and settled for a light snack that consisted of a Cheese Fondue and their speciality Chocolate Avalanche.

Was left a tad disappointed with the fondue as it was bread sprinkled with oregano with a white sauce dip. Had expected better. However all disappointment was laid to rest upon the arrival of the Avalanche!! Sinfully deliciously chocolaty!! It steals the show.

I am surely visiting again to savour other dishes from this place but would request the owner to look into the fondue thing. 

I really liked the ambiance and its easy on the pocket as well which is a big plus.

4 stars from me for Bon Appetit..

This review is especially for the Valentine Special Menu of Bon Appetite Cafe ( Hazra Outlet ) . I had dropped in on the eve of Valentine with the sole purpose of sampling the new delights Rahul Arora had conjured up ! The Red Velvet Strawberry Cupcake and the Orange and Chocolate Ganache Cupcake were both very nice. I personally really enjoyed the Orange and Ganache flavour. We tried out the Rocky Road , Orange Flavour and Rum Fruit handmade chocolates and they were very good. Rahul  has also introduced two new pancakes the Strawberry with Peanut Butter and the Nutella with Cinnamon Cream both of which are super so please do go and sample them  ! His edible rose lollypops are a work of art and look surprisingly real. We also ended up eating the super tasty Cheese Paratha (which I love) and the Macaroni and Cheese Pancake which were absolutely yummy and spot on as always. Rahul is a true foodie who delights in feeding people and the value for money his cafe offers is perhaps amongst the best in the city. I love Bon Appetite !!!

----- 12 Nov, 2012 -----

I am glad that I fianally managed to go to Bon Appetit ! Rahul Arora is a genuine foodie and his passsion shows in his Cafe. Really great food at very economical prices .... we started with the Mushroom Maggi and a Cheese Egg Sandwich both of which were really nice. I loved the Orange Ice Tea that I had as well ....but the icing on the cake was the Cheese Paratha .... it was just super .... prepared fresh with cheese bursting out as soon as you cut into it ... just wonderful and quite the Mother of all Parathas ! Did not have room for dessert sadly but intend to be back very soon.... Rahul ... Kudos ... and the best part is that by keeping it affordable you have created a lovely cozy hangout for the youngsters ... the place has a great vibe and I highly recomend it to all the genuine food lovers of Kolkata : )

I can assure you that you'll love the ambience there. Red, black and white tiles adorn the place and you actually have swings where you relax while you eat, with a sunroof! Perfect getaway for a couple on the streets of Calcutta. You are served quickly on colourful melamine dishes by a cheerful staff. The only rider is the location - but once you've been there, you'll want to come back.

The pasta is not exceptional, while the Club Sandwiches are pretty. The Nachos is also tasty; but the Egg-zotique items were surprisingly good. The show-stealer is the Chocolate Avalanche - I can never have enough of it. There are a lot of varieties of Iced Tea available on the menu, and I haven't seen as many listed in other cafes. The Hazra outlet could do with a little more seating space, though!

Verdict: Fun place to hang out with friends, cozy, warm, good food at affordable prices. Great going!

Little difficult to find place the first time but im sure you can manage. 

Once there, your handed over the menu and you dont know what to have and what not to... everything looks inviting.

Well finally we settled for the mixed sauce pasta, corn pita pockets, nachos, mushroom on toast, ice tea and chocolate avalanche. Everything was nice and i had no complains about any of it. Its very conveniently priced and thats a big plus. 
 
Have visited the salt lake branch frequently too and i like both places equally.

I had a very recent to Bon Appetit with my friends. I had a great time there and i have fallen in love with its ambiance. The checkered floor is simply eye-catching and also the sitting arrangement. 

I ordered Chicken Pasta and Club Sandwich Mexicana which were mind-blowing. Steamed corn was also not bad. Extra Chocolate Stick is very tasty.

Staffs are friendly and i am going to visit there again surely. I would rate 4.0 for BON APPETIT. 

:D

Bon Appetit.. It is located in Hazra near Basusree Cinema Hall.. It is a little difficult to spot, if you are going for the first time, but if you have a GPS enabled phone or the map given on Zomato, you should not face any inconvenience. 

It is a small little cafe with nicely done up interiors with predominant shades of red and black. A few tables are hooked to the ceiling like a swing. I like ! :D There are also frames on the wall and food is served in colorful melamine cutlery. 
But the seats - especially the square ones, are not very comfortable to sit on, but never mind, because the food makes up for it. ;)

I first went about two months ago and since then I have been here several times.. Mainly because of its Chocolate Avalanche - The fudge sauce is Sinfully YUM - but it is very heavy for one person to finish it off. The Tiramisu too, is a delight. The iced teas are good too in which there's a huge variety, I don't think I've seen so many flavors in Iced tea at any cafe in Calcutta at least. I personally like the Blood Orange, Vanilla and Green Apple flavors.
Among savory items, I liked the Mexican Nachos. For the first time I went, I had ordered a Chili Garlic Wai Wai - That was Really Bad and the Sandwiches were just about edible.

My suggestion to the Mr. Rahul Arora is to add more variety and taste in the Savory Section than just Sandwiches and Noodles especially for Vegetarians.
Try adding more Mexican items like Empanadas & Quesadillas and some Mediterranean options as there are hardly any Delis or Bistros in Calcutta serving them.
And I know you can do it, cause you're doing great at the Desserts section :D
Keep serving good Value For Money food - That is BIG Plus, trust me ;)

Three and a half stars from me :)

Have been here twice in a span of 5 days.This place rocks man.It has nice ambiance.Its situated in a cosy bylane of south kolkata. Although the size of the cafe is small as compared to the one in saltlake but i like the decor the lighting....and now the food. ONLY & ONLY CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE come to my mind when i think of this place.....its not just great its awesome.Please anyone visiting this place you must try the chocolate avalanche. Other things which ive tried is veg mixed sauce pasta,chilly chese sandwich,rumcakes,wai wai,cole slaw & nachos.Except for chilly chese sandwich and cole slaw rest were all good.
AND ONE WARNING.....THERE IS A LADY WHO SIT AT THE CASH COUNTER AND TAKES THE ORDER,,,,PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO HER SUGGESTIONS GIVEN AS FOR WHAT YOU SHOULD TRY,,,,FOR BOTH MY VISITS SHE TOLD ME TO TRY WAIWAI WITH CHILLY GARLIC,RUMCAKES,CHILLY CHEESE SANDWHICH ALL SUCKED BIG TIME.THE WORST WAS WAIWAI WITH GARLIC AND RED CHILLIES OMG IT WAS HORRRIBLE. SO USE YOUR SENSES AND ORDER WISELY.
ON PRICING PART- I FELT ITS CHEAP AND FAR BETTER THAN ANY CCD OR BARISTA.

Whenever i plan for a date, it is Bon Appetite right away !.. the owner knows how to transform ordinary food to something extraordinary like cheese mushroom maggi. And i love the hot chocolate and jaljeera in the summers. i simply love love love the roadside cafe feel of the eatery and the ambiance is simply great. soft radio playing in the background to books packed shelves; innovative wall decor to world famous chefs' pic on another. in simple words the place is one of my most favorite in the city though i haven't been to the Hazra outlet yet, I will definitely try that out too, but yes the one in salt lake is my first choice for a hot cuppa on a winter eve. Kudos Rahul Arora, wish you loads of success ahead.

Excellent place for yummy, value for money food. The service is fast and friendly. Menu is big enough to not bore you after a few visits. Though items like Chocolate Avalanche will force you to order it every time you visit. Other items I liked were Egg Pizza, Mushroom on Toast and Spicy Chicken Pita Pockets. Also if you want to taste good coffee without paying hundreds this should be the place for you. The decor is bright and interesting and for a change they have a hanging table and chair. Not sure though if they will be comfortable enough while eating. Only negative is the place is small.

The place is a little tough to find, tucked away in one of the numerous lanes and gullies branching off Hazra road. Also the menu, especially the non-veg fare fails to really excite or innovate, sticking to the tried and tested - should I say, staid? - egg and chicken with cheese, corn and mushrooms, for the most part.

That being said, the fare is quite uniformly tasty. The apple pie was wonderfully executed; the Tiramisu lacked authenticity, being more gooey chocolatey than cheese and coffee, but tasted nice nevertheless. Mexican cuisine being normally dominated by meat, it did not occur to us that the Club Sandwich Mexicana could turn out to be a veg sandwich (but in hindsight, we should have checked and confirmed before ordering). All the same, the taste of the sandwich did go quite a long way in helping us overcome this initial disappointment - and that is saying quite a lot, coming from hard core carnivores like us.

Overall, a nice little place to grab a bite. I am not sure if I will visit again, but definitely worth a try once if one is in the vicinity.

Frequenting this place since the past two months and it never seems to fail to surprise me. Be it in the expansive range of iced teas or to offering Kolkata's best tiramisu, this is THE best quick-bite place in town. Homely environment, impeccable service and sunday specials add the little zing to this quaint cafe. Looking for a tucked away evening? This is the place to be.

a wonderful small eatery in the hazra area perfect for all age groups with a mini library and swings doubling up as service table.. its a nice concept of pay-take-eat rather than take-eat-pay.. garlic maggie and nachos are a must try here ..
