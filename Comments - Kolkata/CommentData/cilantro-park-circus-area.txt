Evening time means hungry time, I ordered their Chinese combo meal through delivery service it was an veg chinese platter. Packaging was nice and so the food really tasted good , the Manchurian was little spicy thought I liked it as well as the noodles , they had not compromise with the quality but did with the quantity they should provide little more quantity but never the less the food tasted good.

I have ordered online a few times.It's a multi cuisine restaurant and Chinese food is really good. Their Stuffed Mushroom Garlic Pepper is an extra ordinary dish I have ever had before, really it's too yummy. Also tried Chicken with Chilly Garlic Butter sauce. It's another gem. Always good delivery on time and very well behaved delivery person. Overall a completely satisfying experience. Looking forward to more dishes.

I'd give Cilantro a perfect, Nadia Comaneci style, 10!

It's a petite, well done up place near The Conclave.
The owners, chefs, managers, and staff are all adept at their roles, and adaptable as well as sociable.

The petite manager stands tall with her attentiveness and her knowledgibility. Her staff is also well trained. They are very happy to discuss the menu and advise on options.

There's soft instrumental music. Service is quick.

As soon as your order arrives you know, from the presentation itself, that the chefs love their jobs. Digging-in only confirms this. Everything I've had (over two visits) is flavoursome and well balanced.

The combo meals come in very convenient trays, the portions are exactly right for a working lunch/ dinner.
My Rogan Josh and Rice Como made promise that order it again, another time.

The Manchow Soup is light, and is mildly spicy. Perfect to pique the appetite for the main course.

The Egg Wrap Fried Rice was a wonderful new addition to my repertoire as a foodie.

There's free parking. The complimentary wi-fi is robust. The establishment takes a special pride in its health and hygiene standards.

They deliver to a 15km radius. But I'd even come here out of my way, for the friendly ambience.

A nicely decorated restaurant near beckbagan. We went there for some casual eating before work. We took 2 egg-fried rice/hot garlic chicken combo priced Rs.110 each (total-283 for two including gst) which was nice & really tasty. Totally vfm.
Next we had Monte Carlo priced at Rs.170( after inclusion of tax it becane 200) which I think really overpriced as per its quantity & quality also.
Staffs were very friendly & well mannered. Service is good too & so does the ambience.

Chinese cuisine has always been my favourite. I found "Cilantro" is a multicuisine restaurant, located in Park Circus.We opted for online order and ordered Veg Singapore Rice Noodles and got my order within 45 minutes. The food was hot when it reached my place. It was Veg Singapore Rice Noodles and was well cooked .... all vegetables was well cooked along with chilli paste chutney u'll get actual taste of the noodles and the taste was sweet and spicy but in noodles oil was little extra ...quantity is good enough no doubt....overall good experience.

Ordered a Chinese Combo via Swiggy (couldn't see it in Zomato online order section)

The quality of the food was really good, just that the quantity of the side dishes were low. 

So I will say that either their price is slightly high, or their quantity (at least in this combo), was low.

Small restaurant serving chinese and indian cuisine located at park circus near 8th day cafe , the interiors are basic and clean. We had a CHICKEN MANCHOW SOUP ,  LAT ME KAI , CANTONESE SOFT NOODLES , TSING HOI CHICKEN and DARSAAN WITH ICECREAM. The portions were so huge that we got our main courses packed , which were the best part of the meal. The soup and starter needs a lot of improvement. The lady at our service was very efficient in her job , taking our dining experience from average to good. I would rate a 3.5 for food and an extra .5 for the service.

This a tiny restaurant and as you park your car outside you get to see how suddenly there are so many similar tiny cafes and restaurants that have cropped up in the area. But what I guess makes this baby restaurant do well is the outstanding food. 

In an hour that was there I mostly noticed they do a lot of home delivery stuff through Zomato and swiggy and that's what keeps their kitchen busy.

Called for a cheese broccoli dimsum(steamed) and was totally blown away at the first bite. The lasting lemon grass taste was just too mesmerising and worth mentioning. 

Tried the Indian food and was more than happy with the taste, normally you don't go wrong in such places with the Indian, but with the dimsum as precursor, I presume Chinese would be equally good too. 

We also got to taste the frozen chocolate MonteCarlo. Though the bowl and presentation of it wasn't attractive as it is in most places, nevertheless it didn't compromise on taste and being chocolaty. 

I gave that extra half rating for the personalised service of the lady at service. She manages the show single handedly from order to service to clean up to billing with a smile all the time making guests feel home. 

Quite impressed! Further addition would be after i taste their Chinese.

A much needed destination in Park Circus area. Good quality Chinese at pocket friendly prices. Not much of ambience, but a neat and nice place to enjoy the food.

We tried Mixed Burnt Ginger Rice and Taichin Chicken. The food arrived shortly. The rice was well cooked, fluffy and full of chicken, shrimps and veggies. The side dish was, however, not according to our taste. It was salty and a bit sour. However, we appreciate their service and cooperation when they tried to rectify the dish. Brownie points for that.
Finally, the bill was less than what we expected.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

If you are longing for some yummy and masaledaar food with much pocket pinch; then look no further and try out this newly opened restaurant Cilantro!
The interiors are done in a very minimalistic way and the place is quite small with almost around 8- 10 medium sized tables...
But, but, do not just go by the decor; the food here is totally finger licking!
We visted here for a casual lunch and wanted to stick to basic Indian food; although they have a variety of dishes from different cuisine,  both vegetarian and non vegetarian! 

So for starters we ordered the Crispy Chilli Mushroom- It was just yummy and perfectly spiced! The flavours were spot on and they served it along with a tangy garlic sauce, which was tasty!
Next for our main course- We ordered Dal Makhni, Paneer Tikka Lababdar , Masala kulcha and Butter tandoori roti!

Paneer Tikka Lababdar is one of their speciality and full of rich, succulent , North Indian flavours! A must try out there!

The value for money is amazing!  The prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes and you pay exactly what you see!
The food is rich in flavour and light too, will not make you feel like you have eaten a lot of calories!  
The staff here is very cordial and prompt!
A must visit for foodies and one can go here with both family and friends! :)

The kebabs and the north indian cuisine that i tried were both appetizing and rich in quality. There were only two of us and the quantity was pretty good for just two people. ¬†In all i would recommend everyone to come and checkout this place.

It was my first time at Cilantro and I was not sure about whether I should be going in or not. I had read a lot of reviews for the same and saw their ad in the Hulchul magazine . I finally decided to check it out for myself. ‚ÄòChicken Reshmi Kebab' and 'Prawn Schezwan Fried Rice' was what I had ordered and it was just perfectly cooked, I enjoyed every bite of it. Chicken Manchow  was one of the best soups I had ever tasted. So I would definitely recommend all my friends to visit Cilantro whenever possible to enjoy the scrumptious food and excellent service that they provide! And I will also visit Cilantro whenever I can.

Cilantro is a vegetarian restaurant at Park Circus area.

Ambience is fine , with moderate sitting arrangements and simple decor.

Amicable staffs.

Pocket pinch is moderate .

Tried lemon coriander soup, Cheese Broccoli Dimsum, chilli garlic noodles and chocolate Monte Carlo.

Lemon coriander soup was generously filled with veggies, tangy and appetising .
Cheese Brocolli Dimsum was soft with nice aroma of cheese and generous fillings.
Chilli garlic noodles was tangy and hot.
Chocolate Monte Carlo was heavenly . U can't miss it.

Overall a pleasurable experience .

Cilantro is a newly opened pure veg restaurant which serves North Indian, Chinese, Continental and Burmese delicacies at a reasonable price.

Ambience is fine and simple. Spacing is moderate.

Staffs were well mannered. It's best to see the owner and his family were looking at the proceedings from beginning to end.

I was invited by PanchPhoron at Cilantro on 28/12/2016 as a part of food tasting which was indeed a delightful and pleasurable experience.

We tasted the following items -
1) Lemon coriander soup - This soup was too good, appetising, aromatic with a lot of healthy veggies. It literally aroused the fire of the gut for aiding better digestion.

2) Cheese Broccoli Dimsum with peanut & mustard sauce- This dish was also delectable, Dimsum were soft with generous fillings , healthy , aromatic and a must try.
Though serving of a Chinese preparation with mustard sauce was innovating but I liked it with peanut sauce more.

3) Steamed Wantons chilly soya- Again a wonderful dish, soft and gooey and healthy .

4) Stuffed mushroom garlic pepper - This was yummy too, tangy and mouth watering .

5) Garlic fried rice - Again a nice one, with garlicky flavour.

6) Chilly garlic noodles - It's bit spicy, tangy and it lifted the taste buds.

7) Veg beancurd- a healthy dish , which was ok . I didn't liked it much.

8) Stir fried Chinese Veg, fine treasure veg in cilantro sauce- I liked both one , cooked well, healthy but nothing to rave about.

9) Lastly, it was time for desserts . We were served by 2 desserts , Cheese cake in blueberry sauce which had a sour taste but highly enjoyable and Chocolate Monte Carlo , which was terrific . It is a precious gem which one can't afford to miss. Chocolate Monte Carlo is a must must try.

Cilantro is a newly opened gem , which every food lovers must visit .

Thank you Cilantro for your warm welcome , Wish you guys all the best. Thank you PanchPhoron for giving me the opportunity to visit this wonderful place.üòÉüòÑ

Date of Visit ‚Äì 30/11/2016

Location ‚Äì  It is located near park circus, just opposite of the 8th day.

Event ‚Äì Get together of Facebook foodie group ‚ÄòGood Vegetarian Food of Calcutta‚Äô.

¬†

Ambiance ‚Äì The interiors are simple. Seating capacity is limited to about 24 seater.

Service ‚Äì I felt staffs were not that well trained. But it was compensated by the presence of owner looking after the proceedings himself. Serving time for dishes were great. 

Food & Description ‚Äì It was an occasion of Get together of Facebook foodie group ‚ÄòGood Vegetarian Food of Calcutta‚Äô and we were delightfully invited by Cilantro, a new pure vegetarian restaurant. The owner himself was there to look after the proceedings which makes the fooding experience more special. The owner had open ears to hear our suggestions and had a smiling face all long. Coming to food :

Veg Manchow Soup : The soup was served hot. It was spicy and tasty. Correct amount of veggies and the noodles very perfectly fried to feel the crunchiness in the soup.

Paneer Tikka : Paneer tikka was serves with two types of dips and salads. Paneer was soft and well marinated.

Crispy Chilli Babycorn : Babycorn was crispy and tasty and it was served with a dip. First time I saw crispy chilli babycorn being served with a dip. 

Steamed Cheese & Brocolli Dimsums : The dimsums were soft, tasty and perfectly steamed. It was served with 2 dips. I liked the peanut butter dip.  

Pan Fried Tofu : Pan fried tofu with exotic vegetables was the star of the show. It a must try dish here. Perfectly cooked and very delicious.

Pan Friend Noodles with Exotic Veggies : Taste was good but peas in a Chinese dish spoiled it.

Chilli Garlic Noodles : It was spicy but the spiciness was over powering the garlic flavour. Still I liked it.

Diced Potato Corn in Hot Garlic Sauce : It was just awesome. Amazing flavour. A must try dish.

Veg Coin Manchurian : The Manchurian was crunchy but was little overcooked.

Darsan with Ice cream : Average dish but was served with two in one ice cream. Darsan is best served with vanilla ice cream.

Overall the experience was good. Few things went wrong. But best part was owner was ready to take the review positively. I am sure they will improve with time.

Cilantro, a pure veg restaturant, situated in park circus opposite of the 8th day. Home like ambience with soothing instrumental music. 
Started with sweet corn soup and wanton clear soup. Both are a must try with a little tingy touch in clear soup perfect for winters.
For starters we ordered Baby corn and veg dimsum. Baby corn was spicy as name suggested and dimsums with peanut chutney and mustard sauce was a balanced combination.
For main course we ordered Navratni kofta and pindi channa. Kofta was soft and channa could have been a little more spicy. 
The breads were soft and eggless. 

Dessert is a must try. Specially Monte Carlo and Cheese cake. Loved it to core. 

Would surely recommend to others and a second visit for sure.

A total let down food , staff service and the lady who was taking the order at the farmer's market in taj . Ordered a mushroom starter worth ‚Çπ200 . Was served a cold one without any hesitance by them . It was cold , not fresh , mushroom quality has gone bad since it seemed that it has been cooked and kept aside for a long time . On complaining they reheated the same in a wok without any apology from their side . How could they have the audacity to serve such a stale and cold food?A total disastrous food . Not worth a penny also .

Went to Cilantro a pure veg resturant with all cusines, though continental appears in the menu card but yet to start. The kebab platters was good specially the Hariyali kebab. Sweet Corn and Manchow soup was served hot and tastes was near to perfection. North Indian ¬†Food which we ordered was Dal Makhani , Palak Corn and Paneer Butter Masala and the breads. Paneer Butter Masala was just like the ones we eat at home. Palak Corn was good in taste and Dal Makhani was Ok nothing great. The breads were also eggless and good. The desserts we had was Monte Carlo, SizzlingBrownie with Icecream and Cheese Cake Blueberry flavoured. The cake and Montecarlo was exceptionally good but was dissapointed with Sizzling Brownie as there was no sizzliing in it and the brownies was very dry. Also the Ice cream served with it was 2in1 which i saw for the first time. Brownies go only with Vanilla. ¬†Another dissapointment was the seating capacity of 20 was cramped into a place for may be 12/14 seats.

We went there with kids as half wanted to eat Indian and half Chinese....
The menu has our all time favorites....from paneer tikka to crispy baby corn...it also has some specials like spinach cheese spring roll and broccoli cheese dimsum both of which were delicious...
Seeing the food so reasonably priced we decided to go for it and ordered about 12 starters between 6 of us....
Each and every one was delicious...
The dahi ke kebab reminded me of the Zaranj taste which is my benchmark for this dish....
The pepper mushroom garlic soup was awesome....the food was also very fresh ...
I can't remember even one dish that wasn't upto the mark... obviously having devoured on this spread there wasn't much room to eat the main course...which shall beckon another visit soon..
Overall a cosy casual place with delicious favorites and reasonable price so MUST GO....

I loved this place. The food was amazing and their presentation was really good. I was very happy to see that it is a pure veg restaurant. Everyone should try this place out.

Cilantro, a pure veg restaturant, situated in park circus opposite of the 8th day. Home like ambience with soothing instrumental music. 
Started with sweet corn soup and wanton clear soup. Both are a must try with a little tingy touch in clear soup perfect for winters.
For starters we ordered Baby corn and veg dimsum. Baby corn was spicy as name suggested and dimsums with peanut chutney and mustard sauce was a balanced combination.
For main course we ordered Navratni kofta and pindi channa. Kofta was soft and channa could have been a little more spicy. 
The breads were soft and eggless. 

Dessert is a must try. Specially Monte Carlo and Cheese cake. Loved it to core. 

Would surely recommend to others and a second visit for sure.

A total let down food , staff service and the lady who was taking the order at the farmer's market in taj . Ordered a mushroom starter worth ‚Çπ200 . Was served a cold one without any hesitance by them . It was cold , not fresh , mushroom quality has gone bad since it seemed that it has been cooked and kept aside for a long time . On complaining they reheated the same in a wok without any apology from their side . How could they have the audacity to serve such a stale and cold food?A total disastrous food . Not worth a penny also .

Went to Cilantro a pure veg resturant with all cusines, though continental appears in the menu card but yet to start. The kebab platters was good specially the Hariyali kebab. Sweet Corn and Manchow soup was served hot and tastes was near to perfection. North Indian ¬†Food which we ordered was Dal Makhani , Palak Corn and Paneer Butter Masala and the breads. Paneer Butter Masala was just like the ones we eat at home. Palak Corn was good in taste and Dal Makhani was Ok nothing great. The breads were also eggless and good. The desserts we had was Monte Carlo, SizzlingBrownie with Icecream and Cheese Cake Blueberry flavoured. The cake and Montecarlo was exceptionally good but was dissapointed with Sizzling Brownie as there was no sizzliing in it and the brownies was very dry. Also the Ice cream served with it was 2in1 which i saw for the first time. Brownies go only with Vanilla. ¬†Another dissapointment was the seating capacity of 20 was cramped into a place for may be 12/14 seats.

We went there with kids as half wanted to eat Indian and half Chinese....
The menu has our all time favorites....from paneer tikka to crispy baby corn...it also has some specials like spinach cheese spring roll and broccoli cheese dimsum both of which were delicious...
Seeing the food so reasonably priced we decided to go for it and ordered about 12 starters between 6 of us....
Each and every one was delicious...
The dahi ke kebab reminded me of the Zaranj taste which is my benchmark for this dish....
The pepper mushroom garlic soup was awesome....the food was also very fresh ...
I can't remember even one dish that wasn't upto the mark... obviously having devoured on this spread there wasn't much room to eat the main course...which shall beckon another visit soon..
Overall a cosy casual place with delicious favorites and reasonable price so MUST GO....

Good Food. Good Taste. Good Presentation...

I went with my family. I was really amazed as the owner Shri. Rajesh Bagariaji attend us personally. 
He is a very humble men and is really caring.

The staffs are really good, soft spoken. Food preparation was good. 
Don't miss the quantity as it's more then enough for two people.

Coming to the rates... It's reasonable and is also attractive.
We wish all the very best to the entire team of Cilantro.
Will keep on visiting.
