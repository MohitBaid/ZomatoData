I had ordered this truffle cake and trust me, i would never go anywhere else to order my cakes. The cake was delicious. It had crunchy praline inside and it tasted a little butter with dark chocolate. Loved the cakes. Uppercrustkolkata.com

The coffee here is absolutely amazing. I would still want a little more options in the bites available here. Brownie points for brownie and also a total veg zone. Ambience plus sitting arrangements are a great bonus.

It's a cherry on the cake..
A place like this on a place where people go for a lot of shopping is an refreshment. Specifically for students it's a place where they could hangout without a pinch on there pocket.

One of the better outlets of Upper Crust, and specifically one of the popular outlets, when it comes to economically priced confectionery stores, this place sees huge demand and high patronage due to the quality they maintain. The patties is quite good here, but the USP of this place are certainly the pastries. Fresh and flavorful, they certainly are the stealer!

The best confectionary in that area, it provides you with a huge variety of snacks and pastries which can be enjoyed with friends and families. Me and my family prefers cakes during birthdays, anniversaries or any other occasion only from this branch of upper crust even though we stay in salt lake coz they provide FRESH and EGGLESS  desserts which are yummy beyond words! <3

While running a shopping marathon around Kalakar street I saw this upper crust, rushed in there for some desserts :) I had the pineapple pudding which was nice, a fruit slice which was decent and a chocolate pastry which was so so again.

Residing nearby the place, this place serves our needs whenever we've requirements of quality cakes for birthdays in our hostel. I crave for their eggless stuff, particularly the chocolate ones, either simply chocolate cakes or Black Forrest. Overall a good place that needs only to expand its premises.

Residing opposite to this place, i prefer upper crust for all my confectionary needs. I crave for their eggless cakes because it's always fresh and economical. In other desserts the fruit cup and chocolate mousse are my favourites. For the snacks i love the paneer pizza a lot. They also sell chocolates and other  packaged eatables.

Very popular cake restaurant of bara bazar. If they increase there space then it maybe the cool hangout place. Tried variety of cakes and snacks here and always satisfied. There is no complaint regarding taste and quality. Loved it.

Received some items from this outlet as Rakhi gifts, namely - 

(i) Veg Burger - Nice and Big, but stuffing could have been better

(ii) Chana Kulcha - Nice and Big

(iii) Patties - Tasty

(iv) Hot Dog - Nice

Prices are reasonable and quantity is good.

Cheers !
