The place brings bundles of joy through the various sweet teeth that comes to us in form of beautiful icecreams. The sundaes are the best. The banana sundae, tutti fruity, black forest are wonderful. Hope to visit this place again and again.

The Indian Hobby Center has become Rollick now! This place has been my go to ice cream parlor ever since I was a child. Recently, l visited this place with my friends and we weren't disappointed. The place had been renovated a while back so seating wasn't a problem.
We ordered the Chocolate overload and crunchy caramel with butterscotch sundae! It was excellent loved every bit of it. It was made to perfection. The place is pocket friendly and is a must visit for ice cream cravings! Recommended!

Also, the place is quite spacious and has adequate amout of seating arrangements. And, the service is fast as wellüëçüèª.

A great place for ice cream lovers .Tried their ice cream tacos & it was very good . I mostly try their As You Like It which give me the option to choose two of my favourite scoops with two top ups & thereby I can explore the synergy of different flavours each time. Today had Blind Love & Choco Mania as my preferred flavours & it turned out to be pretty good . Absolutely love their Bonbons which have been my companion since childhood .The best thing about Rollick is the PRICE , at their prices the offerings are great value for money .

This is probably, the 'Best' (trust me when I use the word) ice cream parlour in town. The sundaes are so deliciously yummy. And even the price is also very reasonable. The sitting area is very cute and cosy. It is a good place, where you can spend your time with your close ones and have loads of talks.

Also, the staffs are efficient and friendly. I liked their happy face, when they were talking to us. :)

This place is known as Indian Hobby Centre.. It is situated on park street just opposite the park.
No matter what it is and will always be my favorite dessert place.. I have a target to try everything on the menu..
Ambience - its neither a very big nor a very small place.. Best place to go with friends and have your gossip session.. Or go with your bae to have a cute and beautiful time..

Desserts -
1- Blue Lagoon- they served it with vanilla ice cream and it is great in taste..though blue lagoon is very much common still u should try it here.
2- Orange Rush- Typical orange flavor more like a fanta or mirinda still i love it.. U can try this if u want little tangy and little sweet
3- Strawberry - it is pretty pink mocktail.. Served with ice cream.. Great in taste
4- Lemon- typical 7-up type of taste but they made it little different i dont know how but i loved it..
These mocktails are priced only 80 including taxes.
Now comes the ice cream shakes
Brownie ice cream shake- it is little bitter because of its dark chocolate and dark chocolate brownies but i loved it because its not very sweet nd ur taste buds will get a difference..
I wanted to try other shakes too but shakes were not available whenever i wanted to try.shakes are priced 110
Icecream -
1- Rollick Special Ice Cream Sandwich - oh my god.. If u are in love with Brownie and also icecream u should try this.. It is one of their signature dish. They served it with chocolate Brownie and vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate fudge and chico chips on top.. Once u try this u will forget every other dessert places..
2- Brownie Duet- Simple two scoops of vanilla ice cream with one Brownie.. Simple but great
3- Banana Split- one scoop strawberry one scoop vanilla one scoop chocolate ice cream with pineapple sauce strawberry sauce and chocolate sauce with two banana on both side.. Personally i didn't like it but my friend's loved it.. I am not a fan of pineapple so didn't like it.
4- Chocolate Explosion - Another signature dish of them.. Two scoops vanilla ice cream with Brownie and a choco bar with chocolate sauce and chico chips.. It looks great and tastes heavenly.. If u r in love with chocolates like me then u must try it.
5- Black Current Twist- two scoops of black current ice cream with same sauce..little tangy personally didn't like it because i don't like black current
6- Twinkling Stars - simple yet tasty
7- Chunky Chocolate - great great great.. It is the new edition on their menu and must have..

Soon will try the others üòÅüòÅ

It's a heaven for Ice Cream Lovers. Super Affordable and Super Yummy ice creams. They are at the heart of the city in Park Street for years now and still keeping on their promise on bringing a smile to people's faces.
Unique and delicious sundaes are worth trying. Even they have some pretty good floats those who want a light refreshing drink and a popsicle to indulge on.
What we had:
1. The Brownie Duet
2. Oreo Overload Taco
3. Orange Rush Float
The best part about them is they try to add something innovative and new to their menu every month.

This place gives you a great variety of ice cream option to choose from.
They have a great way of decorating the ice creams in a beautiful way that makes it look more attractive amd mouth watering.
The pocket pinch is a bit high , but the quantity and quality with match it up.

Recommended menu:
1. Ferrero rocher ice cream
2. Chocolate shake
3. Brownie sandwitch

One of the best ice cream parlours in the city , absolutely love their newly introduced ice cream tacos , personal preference for fruit burst. The rollick special scoops of black current ice cream and the lime cooler float can never go wrong in any season. Chocolate sundaes need more variations , tried out their Chocolate Explosion , recommended as their best chocolate and brownie based creation , but nothing worth mentioning.

This place, located inside the India Hobby Center is one of happy memories among the old Kolkata dwellers. They serve generous scoops of good ice cream with delightful toppings and sauces. The variety of ice creams is also very interesting. The milk shakes are also good. And everything is reasonably priced. The ambience is calm and good. 
This November, they introduced Ice cream Tacos for the month and it was one never before experience. Totally hoping for these to be continued as a permanent item!

One of the vintage ice cream parlour of Kolkata providing with some mouth-watering sundaes and shakes. Also recently they've come up with ice cream tacos which is a must try.

The banana split and the black forest sundae are my personal favourites. Also the tutti frutti is a must. If you're ever craving for sundaes this is the place you need to be. You're bound to love it! I've pretty much lost count of the number of times I've been here. Recently tried the chocolate overload ice cream Taco and that absolutely left me wanting for more of it. 

The prices are extremely reasonable going by the quantity and quality they serve. The service is good as well. Great place to head on to for an ice-cream date or maybe for a catching with a small group of pals.

One of the oldest ice-cream parlour in town, it has undergone much transformation. The quality however remains the same. Cookie Monster & Black Forest Sundae are my favourites here. Personally, I was quite sceptic about trying the Banana Split but it turned out to be nice. Single flavour ice creams they serve here are great too. The service is pretty quick and brownie points for such low prices.

This place is my personal favourite when it comes to ice cream and sundaes. This review is based on my recent visit here. I was quite tempted to try the new ice cream tacos launched by them. 

I tried the Orange Float. I found it quite quirky as there was an orange popsicle in my drink, which no other place in the city serves. The drink was indeed refreshing and thirst quenching. 

Moving on, I tried the Chunky Chocolate Taco. Freshly baked waffle taco was first filled with crumbled biscuits and chocolate sauce. Some nuts were spread over it. Then two scoops of chocolate ice cream were placed within the taco. Some brownie was also added inside. This was finally topped with Rollick's ice cream cake, nuts and whipped cream. Coming to the taste, this was heavenly and tasted out of the world. This is definitely a chocolate lovers paradise. This whole ice cream taco is priced at INR 200.

The service was fast and efficient. I loved watching the taco prepared in front of my eyes. This concept has been introduced for the first time in Calcutta. Rollick has also launched two more flavours - Oreo Overload and Fruit Blast. I was quite full to try them but would definitely plan to try these on my next visit.

Deadly sinful.Also they need to work on their service. Should be more quick.Highly recommended for everyone .

Their Black Forest Sundae is the best in town. Another favourite is the Ferrero Rocher Sundae. 

Besides the sundaes their shakes are also lovely and are really nice and thick and creamy. Coffee Cream and Slurpy Strawberry is my favourite.

There are a lot of options for single scoops as well, ranging from the basic flavours to fancy ones like cookie crumble.

Amazing place
Not much in terms of ambience
But cozy enough when the ac is working
The ice-creams and sundaes are perfect and worth it
Staff are polite and the prices are inclusive of tax
Went here thrice after three bad days
Left smiling every time
Definitely recommended
Edit -Been a little disappointed after my latest visit. the favourite Tutti Fruity ice cream hai been reduced in quantity and even the cone it is usually served with wasn't there.
On inquiring about it the "new" staff member wasn't very pleasant to talk to.
The usual smile was replaced with a frown.
Rollicks will surely lose regulars like us if this trend continues.

Used to go there when it was still called India Hobby Centre. It was a good place to spend those lazy weekends gossiping with the best of buds. Now renamed Rollick, it still retains the charm of those days. Trying anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed and you would leave with a smile on your place.

The only thing thats good about this place is the ambience. I am surprised a place which serves such a mediocre taste has high ratings. 

Chocolate Brownie Shake: Well the first thing you expect from a shake is for it to be damn cold. To my disappointed, this shake from Rollick was warm. There was very little evidence of a brownie or an icecream. It was just milk, blended with some chocolate syrup.

Black Forest Sundae: They served it in a glass and at Rs.160, you‚Äôd expect it to be overloaded with icecream. However what we got was an half empty glass with 3 ultra small scoops of icecream, 2 crunched mini brownies. Checkout the pics for yourself. 

Don‚Äôt be fooled by them by visiting this place. You can better spend your money on something else. Try frollz, its nearby and its awesome.

Now renamed as Rollick (India's Hobby Center) been to this number of times one of my favorite places to stop by for ice creams. The place has a pretty comfortable seating arrangement, staffs are polite

A cool place to be with friends and family it‚Äôs one of the finest place to hangout which deserves multiple visits the prices are inclusive of tax it is pocket friendly as well

Been to this place numerous times. I like the interior. They got lots of options in the menu. Prices are inclusive of tax. Not much ambience but it's undoubtedly a good place to spend as much time as you want. Staffs are well acquainted and polite and the service is prompt. Tried Ferrero Rocher Sundae and it was quite mouthwatering. Definitely a good place to visit if you are into desserts.

Ice cream is my all-time favourite item. I never say no to an ice-cream. And having rollick's ice cream is really awesome and heavenly.. We ordered,
* Chocolate Overload..
* Mango Crunch..
* Hot Chocolate Fudge..
Chocolate Overloaded is mind blowing.. It's a must try one.. And rest of the two items are also very impressive..
A thumbs up for them.. üëç

Ordered for a nolen gurer ice cream family pack. What came was a shock! I was expecting a pack like they have at Amul's or Kwality Walls but I was served 5 scoops. Just five scoops. And the taste? It didn't taste what it should taste like..at all! I have had better nolen gurer ice creams. I have tasted Rollick's ice creams since my childhood and this is definitely not what I had expected. Firstly I felt like cheated on this "family pack" misleading thing.. even if I ignore that, the ice cream itself was a huge turnoff!

We ordered the chocolate bliss from the amazingly sounding menu. The place looks really catchy. The sitting arrangements are really cool. You have really cool music going on in the background and the kind of sundaes they make are coolest. The place becomes a bit chaotic when it completely fills up. A really good place for hanging out. And really affordable too.

Just opposite trincas, while coming towards rabindra sadan metro station is located this amazing age old ice cream parlour. Have been going since childhood, and yet it doesn't leave a chance to surprise. 
They offer amazing sundaes, based on whichever flavour you'd like, also smoothies and shakes. 

My personal favourite has to be the brownie ice cream sandwich - this is a devil for chocoholics and dessert tooth people. And the black forest sundae. 
Also tutie fruity is one of a kind. 

Go there for a date or to chill. This place is all up to give you a great time!

This place is sheer love. This wing of Rollick is located in the busy streets of Park Street. A 5minutes walk from the Metro Station towards India's Hobby Centre. I scream, You scream, we call scream for Ice cream is exactly what this place serves! This place is surely a delight for all the people having a sweet tooth! Serves a huge variety of ice cream and shakes. Chocolate Overloaded with toppings, Twinkling Stars, Ferrero Rocher Sundae and their signature sundae, Rollick Ice cream are my favourite!
This place will not surely loot you like other ice cream parlours. Has a quirky seating arrangement!
A very pocket friendly place with generous staffs!

Rollick is better known as India's Hobby Centre, that being it's old name. This is a very old and very popular ice cream parlour situated at Park Street. Inspite of that,my first visit here was only last month.
Had the Ice Cream Sandwich, Chocolate Overload Sundae, Black Current Twist Sundae and a Caramel and Chocolate sundae whose name I don't remember. Everything was marvellous!! My favourite was the chocolate overload sundae. The caramel one was amazing too. Me and my friends were fighting to get our spoons in quick enough to grab some before it disappears into our stomach. Lovely ambience and spacious interiors. Would love to visit it again and again for their great sundaes.

India's Hobby Center, which has now been renamed as Rollick, has been a part of my childhood memories. This age-old ice-cream parlour of the city is situated at the Park Street-Russel Street crossing. The place offers a wide-range of sundaes. Me and my friends had ordered for five different sundaes, The Brownie Duet, Tutty Fruity, Black Forest Sundae, Chunky Kit Kat and The Fruit trifle Sundae. 
The Brownie Duet was a combination of hot brownie, cold vanilla ice-cream, cherry with an abundance of chocolate chips, The Fruit trifle Sundae is made of strawberry jelly, cream, cake, vanilla ice-cream and fruits. The Chunky Kit Kat has the predominance of chocolate and a good crunchy texture, unlike the saccharine Tutty Fruity and The Fruit Trifle. Every sundae caters to different tastes and preferences.

This is one of the oldest ice cream parlours in the city. This place was earlier known as the India's Hobby Centre. Now renamed as Rollick, they have revamped the place in a new avatar introducing very interesting sundaes and ice creams. 
Ever since the time of India's Hobby Centre, this place has been serving ice creams from the brand Rollick.  Now they are running by the same brand name. 
During the Summer Coolers Walk conducted by Foodzpah in the month of May, the walk was terminated at this ice cream parlour. We had ordered four varieties of sundaes. It is unfortunate that I cannot recall the exact names of all of them. But I must say that the ice creams were very good. Sundaes were made with the perfect balance of fruits, nuts, sauces and jams. We had - 
Brownie Ice Cream Sandwich
Black Currant Twist
Chocolate Overload
Caramel Sundae (this is not the exact name).
All of these were good. Specially the chocolate overload. I would definitely recommend to try out this place as it is an old favourite. Happy Dining! :)

After hearing a lot of good things about this ice cream parlour we decided to drop in. It is a cozy place and the interiors are well decorated and very neat. 

Coming to the ice creams, we ordered an ice cream sandwich and a cookie monster sundae. Both tasted really good. The ice cream sandwich was two pieces of chocolate cake cut in the shape of sandwich bread with scoops of vanilla ice cream between them and garnished with hot chocolate and cashew nuts. The cookie monster Sunday was scoops of chocolate ice cream along with cookie crumbs and choco chips with whipped cream and a cherry on top. This place is heaven for all the ice cream lovers. I highly recommend this!

Visited this outlet after a long time. Yes its an ancient ice cream parlour, with a renovation. They now have a new management, and the old school looks have gone missing, so has its signature serves.
The new one is also cool enough, but i did miss the old ambience.
I doubt if anything from the old menu still exists, as all the names on the menu card is all new.
Still a very cozy outlet, good enough to spend time with your partner.

Now coming to the ice creams... üòã For a person like me for whom what you serve equally matters as how you serve it, i must say that their presentation is marvellous. Nd the quality which they provide is also quiet good (expected though, given that it's rollick).

Looking forward to numerous more visits in the future to this place to COOL OFF... üòé

Previously named indian hobby centre and now also it's known by this name only but now it has changed to "Rollicks" ice-cream franchise.

Ambiance-The place is nicely decorated with orange and white table chairs.This is the place where you can talk and spend time with your loved once,A well suitable outlet for casual meeting over a cup of ice-cream.But i would like to mention one point too the place needs to be a bit tidy than it is.On my 4-5 visit i have noticed this carefully sometimes it's okay but if you're hygiene concerned than it might disappoint you a little.

Service-There is on floor service(self-service) the staffs are decent and very polite.As it is a small outlet there is nothing much to say about the service,I think they serve pretty well on time 1 extra point for staffs.

Ice-cream/Sundaes-The best you can get in the price bracket of 120-250.The sundaes are really sweet and damn appetizing.Nicely serve with hot sizzling brownies.

What should you order-Rollicks ice cream sandwich,Black forest sundae,The brownie duet(Previously known as Duet of love) and trutty frutty.

To conclude,It's a must visit if you're a ice cream lover and you won't be dissapointed with the sundaes they serve at a relatively cheaper price as compared to other.

Being an ice cream lover, Rollick is a place which comes to my mind first. 
Right in the heart of the city, this place is very easy to locate and they serve some very interesting sundae ice cream... My favourite flavour is daab malai and cotton candy.. even the choco mint is yum. 
But guys, if you come here don't forget to try out the ice cream sandwich.. it's the best :)

This tiny treasure place will make you happy anytime. I‚Äôm a frequent visitor here. Their Brownie Duet is amazing.  Black Current Twist and Chocolate Overload come second. Just love it.  They have a few tables so a little less on quantity of people that can be seated.  Dessert is everyone‚Äôs weakness so would definitely recommend to try their different types of shakes and sundaes.  Price is reasonable and the staff too is courteous, always giving a quick service.

The black forest sundae is my favourite here. It has 3 scoops of ice cream, ie chocolate and vanilla, brownies, cherries, chocolate sauce and wafer rolls. 
Try this place for a good dessert. :)

This ice cream parlour is probably the first one in Calcutta but let that fact not get to you because it has stood the test of time by constantly renewing its ice cream experiences. Went here with family after a heavy dinner and still managed to have 3 sundaes and 2 scoops of ice cream amongst 4 people, yes, that's how tasty it all was.

The chocolate sauce was good, the ice creams were tasty and the fruit ingredients were fresh. Not too heavy on the pocket either, got to visit this place more often! Definitely recommend to all foodies!

Well when winter knocks the door you always have a place for hot chocolate.So let me tell you ,you will get one of the best hot chocolate here.
Some of you like me also prefer the chillness in your tummy in this shivering winter to add extra fun to your life.Then I must say plz do try mint and choco chip with chocolate sauce icecrm(Rs.150) and if you want to melt the chocolate in your mouth with add on vanilla go for chocolate fudge ice cream with extra nuts (Rs.80).Absolute piece to heart for...and if you are a die hard fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S here you will get your banana split.

The good part is cards are accepted now. I had what they call "chocolate overload" @Inr 150. Not worth d price. All it had was chocolate ice cream, broken chocolate biscuits, chocolate sauce, whipped cream n a cherry. I can make better than this !!

A very nice dessert parlour ¬†at a prime location of the city. Good thing is, they take orders till 11:30 pm. ¬†Had the almond scoop. The ice cream was really rich and the cone was appreciably crunchy. Also tried he "twinkling stars". It had a scoop of vanilla and chocolate ice cream each, topped with chocolate sauce and a generous amount of choco chips. It was a very filling and wonderful dessert! The seating arrangement is also very comfortable. The service is very quick . Would love to visit them again.

It is the same restaurant once called as India's hobby centre now renamed as Rollick. Interior is good. 
We ordered : Choco brownie and Twinkling stars. 
Twinkling stars was just good with two scoops of chocolate ice cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Nothing excellent. Couldn't find a trace of hot chocolate fudge. 
Choco brownie was a chocolate shake with chocolate ice cream and a small piece of brownie which was very hard to find. Lacked the required sweetness. Didn't really like it.
Staffs were decent and the prices were reasonable........

When i discuss about Rollicks, it is one of the oldest ice cream company which was charming the city of joy with it‚Äôs beautiful lip smacking ice creams specially the cup ones(plain white and two in one) which the kids used to enjoy back then at Rs. 10. However, it is fading away in oblivion when newer¬†ice cream shops such as Pabrais, Mamamia, Gelato, Swirls, and some more have taken over the niche which was enjoyed by Rollicks back then in much larger scale.

I scanned the menu & decided on Ice cream sandwich and Choco blast. They came within 7-8 mins. It was a treat to watch and eat it both. The ice cream sandwich was excellent in quality & quantity. Enjoyed eating here, will definitely try out more delicious ince creams in their menu.

After a great meal at 'Arsalan' on our 4th Anniversary, we were looking for a good place to have some dessert. We initially decided to go to Cream and Fudged but when our eyes fell on this place, we went in. This ice-cream parlour has been in the heart of Park Street for a long time. Earlier the decor was a bit shabby. Now, they have revamped their store and it looks great. On seeing the menu,we could not decide as what to order. We were spoilt for choices. Finally, we decided to go for one Black Forest Sundae and one  Brownie duet. The Black Forest Sundae was a rich combination of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, brownie chunks, cherries and hot chocolate sauce. It was served in a big glass. This item was sinfully delicious and we loved it. The Brownie duet was served in a bowl and it was prepared with vanilla ice cream, warm chocolate brownie, hot fudge and chocolate chips. This item was delectable. We took additional chocolate chips toppings and it made the two ice-creams even more delicious. One con-they should serve the ice-cream to the table as carrying two to three glasses at a time can be problematic for us. In a nutshell, it was a sweet ending to our day and we will definitely come back again.

A nice ice cream parlor, impressive, d happy ambience and comfy seating arrangement is surely an add on......
D staff were cordial. On my visit today I found them cheerfully answering d loads of queries of a group of college goers who were totally puzzled abt what to order.
I happily settled for their famed and signature sundae I.e ice cream sandwich...
D chocolate fudge was warm and gooey....
D two layers of chocolate cakes in which d layer of vanilla ice cream was cozily sandwiched was very soft... d nuts did justice to d dish

I would definitely visit d place to try my hands on their icy surprises!!!

Location: Russel street. Just enter the road opposite to The Park and you'll find this ice cream parlour to your right.

It was fairly empty when I went there after having lunch at Russel dhaba!
 
I ordered a large twinkling stars (‚Çπ100).

It was basically a mix of one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of choco chip ice creams, loaded with chocolate sauce and topped with Choco chips and a cherry.

Well, you can't go wrong with this combination right? However, I am not quite a fond of Rollick's ice creams. I've tasted much creamier and yummier ice creams before. But for the price, whatever they are offering is good( quantity wise).

Also, no added tax. What yoi see on the menu is what you pay!

Tried their banana split and it was awesome :D

Indian hobby center re-branded itself with rollick brand. A clean and spick and span outlet. Looks very nice. Earlier it was too smelly and musty but not anymore. Post dinner walked in to have some dessert here. Ordered a coffee caramel sundae and 2 scoops of choco chip ice cream on a waffle cone. The sundae was really delicious and loved it every bit. They have variety of flavours now in their kitty. After having few bites I found a hair in the waffle cone and on notifying them they did not charge for it at all..had the daab malai and strawberry scoops. The daab flavour had this coconut flavour which I liked. The strawberry one was good as well.
All the best to the management.

India's Hobby Centre is now just Rollick - revamped and all shiny instead of the earlier old school decor. I liked the old place quite a bit, and even though the prices have been hiked up reasonably, it still more or less the old menu.

Now that's what I love is that the desserts here are old-school - simple ice-cream-syrup-waffle combinations, at times with fresh or canned fruits. Nothing dramatic like a flambe, and nothing complicated like a pavlova or a parfait - this is where eating is un-complicated and simple. 

While leaving I quietly pointed  at the counter that it is illegal to not serve regular drinking water at an eatery and force a customer to buy bottled water. The lady at the counter, probably the owner, thanked me for bringing into her notice and said she would look into it. I am hoping they would be complaint.

This place is great...awesome... it has done some recent renovations and it's better than ever now!! U get such great ice creams here... they have a huge variety and they serve you well!! Once you step in you will definitely end up with a stomach full of different ice creams, having a great time too...even if you don't plan to! Great destination for dessert lovers and to hangout with friends and family!!!

This ice cream parlour is one of my favourite. 
It is situated at the junction of Russell Street and Park Street at India's Hobby Centre. 
They serve varieties of ice creams,shakes, and sundaes. Seasonal mango sundae is something which you must try. Another great combo is choco orange. Recently they renovated with nice, cozy and colourful set up.

If there's one place that makes you feel like a child in a candy store AND makes you feel like there is only joy in the world, it's Rollick at India Hobby Centre!!! Do visit this place and try the delectable sundaes, ice creams and floats...oh and they have sandwiches too. We tried the tutti fruti sundae (for old times sake!), nolen gur, tender coconut, mint chocolate, all in their crunchy chocolate waffle cones. This landmark ice cream destination is a must visit for those who like all things sweet!

This is my favourite place for ice cream and desserts. I love the new fresh look and am so happy they have retained some of their old specials on the menu too. We drop in after work for a nice hot sandwich and cold coffee - where else in Calcutta do you get these at such good prices! Must visit.

Glass found in ice cream. Shameful and dangerous. I am surprised this can be allowed. I cut my tongue, not sure if I already had a piece of glass and the service guy offers me just to change the ice cream.

..And the award for the best sundaes in town goes to Rollick!! :) It's a cosy little place on the crossing of Russel Street & Park Street. You feel refreshed as you enter this beautifully done place with lovely colour combination and cute little seating area. From sundaes to shakes to floats to scoops..there is variety to choose from!!¬†

Besides, going there for the love of ice creams. I believe this is an ideal place for desserts once you are done with lunch/dinner anywhere in Park Street.

I have already revisited this place and you should visit it too if you still haven‚Äôt!!

Personal favourite: Rollick Ice cream Sandwich!! Must try!! :)

So happy to see Rollick back at Hobby Centre! Visited their new parlour over the weekend. The decor is fun and cheerful! We ordered Mango Sunday and Banana Split - both were yummmnyy! The staff are well trained and service is quick and efficient. It's great to have a new dessert option back on Park Street and highly recommend everyone to visit.

Well it was earlier known as The India's Hobby Centre... which recently underwent metarmorphosis and is known as Rollick. It remains the same with its coziness and cordial staff. Some of their sundaes went missing from their present chart.
But it serves really good variety of sundaes at reasonable rate.

Its a cute little place on Russell Street, right across THE PARK, Park Street. Very easy to locate. The decors are extremely cheerful, vibrant and colourful
The Sundaes are a speciality here and are a real treat for the child in you. A must visit for every Ice cream lover in the city. My favorite would be Ferror Rocher Sundae, a real treat to the taste buds and that too at a very affordable price point. Been there with my family and now its one of my dads favorite hangouts post dinner.
