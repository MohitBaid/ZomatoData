This is a heaven for all those street food junkies out there.There is nothing much to say about this place that hasn't been said earlier.The place serves the best Chaats in town.I have had their Dahi Vada, Dahi Phuchka and the Tikia Chaat.All of these were great to have, but I must specially mention the Tikia Chaat of theirs.It is The best.Every time I visit them, I have to have it.Intend on tasting their rest of the spread soon.It's a great little place to have wonderful lip-smacking street-food at such affordable rates.Do give them a visit.

This hangout near Hedua will give you a typical flavour of street foods of North Kolkata. This outlet has earned its place in several newspapers and has been in a top ranked place concerning street foods. There are so many Chaat options from which one can choose from. The staff here is amazing and very friendly. Mixed Chaat is one the best dishes here.

Value for money, hygienic,friendly and tasty chaats. Must try the singhara chaat and dahi puchka. The best part is the location near to the sweet lane of old kolkata

Tucked away along the alley of the footpath bordering the Bethune College, this stall makes its presence felt. Though it is nothing but merely a roadside stall, it have had a reputation of being served the people over decades.
Once, me along with a childhood friend of mine, went there and ordered some stuffs. We both feasted upon the chaats which tasted rather fine. The guy taking the order was probably the son, definitely not the one who started the food stall years ago. My friend also took some some which was packed nicely.
The guy taking the order rarely spoke and paid attention to his work. The order gets served at a decent pace.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) If you are a chaat lover, you should definitely give it a go.

Qs) Why have I rated it 4 stars?
Ans) Being just a roadside stall, it required a good amount of zeal to continue in this dynamic environment. Hence, it should get all the credits. Again, there are various ways where it needs to improve too, thus earning  only 4 stars.

Situated adjacent to bethune college, at the ramdulal street crossing. Serving chats for many years. Their chats are different, I have never had chats like this. I had khasta kochuri chat. They smashed the kochuri and added ghughni. The taste was good. All over a good experience.

If you are a chat lover you must definitely visit this place. Its near to Bethun College, a small roadside store. But their quality is brilliant. Any chat you take is just fantastic with perfect mixture of sweet and sour. Quantity is decent and the prices are very low.
I have their their Mixed chat and Papri chat. Both tasted extremely well.

This is an old street side stall serving some delicious chats. I love their ghugni, which they use as the base of all the chats. The tikia, and the singara are both delicious. Due to changing times they now serve the chats with curd on top like most places, but if you want to have their real taste ask them not to add the curd on top, so that you can relish the actual taste of the ghugni chats.

Situated at a stone throw distance from my college.. They offer some decent chats at an affordable price.. Generally crowded by the college students.. It serve good papri chats. It is a bit different from the usual papri chats.. It is more of a fusion of dahi vada and papri chat..

Situated just opposite to Boikuntho Book House at Ramdulal Bus stop (Hedua Park), Hedua Chat is one of the old and well known quick bite famous chat counter among the teenagers.
As a student of Scottish Church Collage, I am very frequent to this chat stall. It open at noon and whole day you can see many students, young person came to this counter and have their chat acc to their taste.
They served various types of Chat like Tikka Chat, papri Chat, Singara Chat, Doi Bara etc. The price of all Chat is between Rs.30-45.
 Among all of them Singara chat is my personal favorite. Served with two smashed singara, googhni and well chopped onion make this chat my all-time favorite chat.
It is an open stall, you can rise question about the hygiene level. But believe me, an open Chat Centre with some good quality food is more important than this all kinda question. Try it.

A small road side trolley..but variety is good. Tried the khasta kachori chaat but was a bit disappointed as there was no curd..being an ardent chaat lover was expecting something better..but the dish only contained kachori, ghugni, sweet chutney, bhujia, coriander leaves & onion.

Ah!!! So many childhood memories associated with this place.. The person who singlehandedly prepares the delicacies is one gem. A guy who customizes the dishes according to the customers need is hard to find in any street side stall. This place offers delicious chaat at affordable prices. Go for the famous ghugni. It's totally worth it.

This is one of the oldest & most popular streetfood kiosk of this region. One has to eat under the khulla asmaan and they hardly hv any seating arrangements. It remains crowded mostly due to the quality and quantity, at such an affordable price. They serve mouthwatering chaats of which my faves r papri-chaat & mixed-chaat. My only complain about them is they don't keep tissues with them which they should.

As it is located at a minute's distance from my house it was one of my favorite street food stall from childhood.Dahi vada,khasta kachori chat are the must tryout here. Over the years they have maintained the same taste which is quite a good achievement.

Excellent. I ordered Tikia Chat. The taste of Pototo Tikia was very good. It was fresh and soft and hygenic too. The Tikia Chat comprises of Potato Tikia, Ghugni motor, Imli chatni and various masala and green chilli. The price was resonable (Rs.35/ for Full plate). The quantity was enough. The quality was good. The only drawback was the sitting arrangement. Only Two benches were there. Otherwise, everything was fine. Better to choice the take away options.

Yes it was the favorable chat center from decade. If being a traveler foodie you still not be here then I'm sorry it's a same. Go and try once then you always been here. It's really one of the best chat outlet of kolkata. From tikiya chat to spl. Puchka you get all here in pocket friendly price. The taste very delicious from decades and no change at all. All time favorite place.

Calcutta is famous for its street food. From Phuchka to Roll to Alu Kabli, you will find them at every corner and every true blue Calcuttan will have their own list of favourite vendors. But when you find a street food stall in business for 70+ years, you know instantly that they must be special. With the 4th generation now into business, Hedua Chat is a name the locals vouch for when it comes to ghugni chaat.
                                                                ...

This stall is located opposite the hedua swimming pool and along the Bethune College wall, on the flank opposite nalin Chandra das and sons Sweet shop. Their samosa chaat is nothing like the ones I've had elsewhere. It's absolutely yummy. It comes with chana and onion toppings that make it oh so heavenly ! Their dahi phuchka is different as it comes with a layer of extra chutney and bhujiya . The  khasta kachori chaat is also worth a try as it's a chaat I've never seen being served elsewhere.There's a bench at the back of the stall where one can sit and enjoy their plateful of chaat ! Happy chaating ! :)
