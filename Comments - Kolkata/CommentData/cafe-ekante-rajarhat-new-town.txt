This cafe is the hot gossip in town. I went there today around 8pm, but the only speciality​ I have found was ambiance. There is a enough parking space for cafe ekante, if you drive straight 2mins, crossing gate no. 1. We had fish fry, basanti polao and ekanter kosha mangsho. The foods were very delicious but the quantity were low and the floors were dirty too. The only awestrucking was ambiance, which we completely enjoyed.

Location - Inside Eco Park ( In the Eco Island )
Date - 22th December
Parking - Available

I visited Eco park with one my friend to spend some quality times there.
The weather was very good and we were too much Hungry cause we didn't eat Much from the morning..
So we decided to eat here cause i heard a lot about this place.. 
To reach this restaurant you have to take a boat , they directly take you to the eco island where the restaurant is situated..

First of all the location was absolutely stunning. The boat theme restaurant and the view was very romantic, highly recommend for couples or a romantic date.
Now coming to the food :-
1) Cox Bazaar Special Murgh Tikka (4.5/5)
2) Tandoori Rotis and Naan(4/5)
3) Sahi Murg (5/5)

Every dish was Superb in taste, simply delicious i can say..
But their service was pathetic af that Pissed me off.
And staff was lazy
For these particular two reasons i give this restaurant 3.5star .
Otherwise from food to interiors to location everything was top notch..

Overall it was a decent experience..

I have no complaints on their food. The food is delicious but you'll be fooled if you take ice cream. It's over priced. 
The worst thing is that the lady who runs the confectionery at the lake side is the most irritating person you'll ever come across. She is rude, grumpy and is ready to send you back home. She lies that the tables are full and it would take hours to get a seat whereas after we went, we got a seat instantly. It's a great place to go out for dates. The complimentary boat ride is the cherry on the cake.

I wanted to visit this place since I came to know about this restaurant in Eco park!Those who wish to visit this restaurant need to take a boat ride(free of cost) from the boat stand near gate 2 of ecopark. 
We entered the house boat shaped restaurant. It was only for chinese cuisine. There were other restaurants as well which served other cuisine. 
Ambience :5 ON 5
Food:average(ordered a babycorn starter it was good and Singaporean egg noodles)

Cafe Ekante was on my wishlist since its inception,and little did I imagine that I'd  get a chance to visit this outlet to celebrate my 24th birthday,that too with my Bff;yeah I am one lucky soul!Everything about this visit was beautiful.No,Birthday Blues ain't clouding my judgement here! It was a quaint,sunny,early December morning,and the moment I stepped out of the boat onto the Eco Island,I instinctively knew,it was gonna get better.We first entered the chinese section,but since Mughlai was on our mind,we shifted to the north Indian/Bangali joint.Got our name enrolled into the waiting list and after waiting  at the parlour for about 25mins,we were ushered into the dining space.A pretty packed weekend it was. Wasn't quite an "Ekante" brunching experience.Now,coming to the food,we decided to have Indian Bread instead of the customary "Bhaat" preparations,like bheto Bangalis.For starters we ordered Dhaka Famous Gilafi Seekh Kebab,comes in a platter of 4 pieces tossed in a tangy spicy(read very hot) dressing of very desi masalas,and roasted veggies alongside and salad.For main course we ordered Masala Kulcha and a preparation of mutton which goes by the name of RaRa Mutton,a rich gravy with four pieces of mutton.For dessert we went for Baked Roshogolla,which comes in a bowl of two. 
All the quantities were sufficient for two.The staff was courteous enough to ask after us from time to time.The food was served in the order which we had suggested..The food was not mind blowing,but it was standard,rather satisfactorily good.If you add up the ambience,the service,the food and if you're there at the right time,the beautiful sunset experience as viewed from the beautiful Eco Island,I'm sure you'd rate higher than 5 on Zomato's rating scale.This place is an experience on its own.One of Kolkata's must visit eating experiences.

Visited the place  twice for lunch.Ambience is awesome. It is sheer good luck for city dwellers like us to get a chance to reenergise and refresh ourselves   spending a Sunday noon in this soothing location.The use of Sheetalpati( a type of woven mat made of  dried palm leaves) and Taalpatar Haatpakha( handmade fans made of  palm leaves and decorated with frills of cloth ) : the two very commonplace stuff attached with the midday lunch  and dinner time  of the traditional bengali  household of pre 90s evoke nostalgia .
There are plenty of options to explore the delicious and varied delicacies of Bengal .In both of our visit we opted for traditional full course Bengali menu having mocha r ghonto( curry made of  banana flower), Pabda r jhal( Pabda fish in tomato and onion gravy)shorshe die Parshe ( Parshe  fish in mustard sauce)Daab Chingri(Prawn in coconut cream)and last but not the least kasha mangso( needs no explanation).As appetisers chingrir cutlets are  fantastic .We were looking for mouralar jhal (Indian anchovy in mustard sauce).But It was not available.The crab dish was not available also in our second visit.  Staffs are helpful and the service is prompt.(Though the  outside view is so beautiful that you won’t mind to wait even).It was raining heavily on the day of our second visit and the wind and rain was creating huge turmoils in the water of the vast lake.From inside we were feeling to be in a ship stuck in the midst of a roaring ocean where the waves were crashing with each other. Everything outside was blurred. Never before did we even dream of such an amazing dining experience sitting in Kolkata.
Coming to the taste we didn’t find it at all the food that we enjoy even in our special days.They were so spicy and oily that they were lacking their originality.The use of sweetness  in every dish was bringing almost similar flavour in all the dishes and this is quintessentially opposite of Bengali cuisine. It would have been better to present dishes with their originality.To make them more like typical restaurant dishes, their fine intricacies have been lost .We went there  for the second time mostly because of the location and we enjoyed it to the brim.

If you are looking for a romantic gateway with your loved ones, then this is surely the place in Rajarhat area. Located inside Eco Park, you have to take the boat the reach the place. I went on a breezy and drizzling evening and I just loved the vibe there. 

It is so picturesque and serene that you would definitely do not want to leave this place very soon. Food is also good and so the service. I would definitely like to go again and enjoy my day.

Went to the Cafe in the evening rather Sunday evening and it was quite filled up !

Well the experience to reach the cafe by a boat was quite nice..

Cummin to the food we ordered Kurkure Murgi , Bhetki Cutlet and Cappuccino  ,

All the food items were well prepared 5/5 for that ..

.5 points cut down because even after asking them quite a lot of times to serve the cappuccino first they served it after our food was almost over !

Would definitely give it more visits..

What should I mention first. The good one or the bad part. Ambiance is not doubt mind refreshing, romantic, food was also good but the worst part is with the timing. This Sunday I visited this place with my husband. When I called them near about 1. 15 pm the lady told no problem pls come and she didn't suggested for any table booking. When I reached there near about 2 pm the small outlet of cafe ekante boat spot informed us that it will take 2 hours waiting time. I called the reception the lady then informed me  they are closing the lunch order. So this very disappointing, confusing and misleading behavior on the part of the management. Becoz after entering eco Park options are very limited. So while we have to wait there I ordered from the small counter one fish fry for 90 rs which was good. Atleast we reached the restaurant and had our lunch at 4.30 pm. Enough of their kindness that atleast they served us with lunch. Now again contradictional situation the waiter who came with the menu card told us to order within 5 mins which actually I wanted to place the order 2 hours before. I was so hungry that I was not in a situation to reply him back so I am writing here. Whatever they didn't even bother to fill the glass when its empty I was watching that the waiter was watching every table but didn't took the pain. Now coming to food I ordered 
Cox bajar kabab - gondhoraj (good but spicy, chicken was very soft), dakbanglo murgi - (I am glad having two pcs of leg out of four, one small potato and half egg), rice - plenty for two. 
Will visit again may be nxt tym the house boat one. My suggestion to them that they should increase their time for lunch becoz on Sunday 1 to 4 pm is not enough.

A restaurant on a boat anchored by an island in a huge lake and there is a ferry service from the bank of the lake to take the guests there...can it get more romantic than this?Cafe Ekante hits it out of the park in terms of ambiance.But that doesn't mean the food is of any less.The Chinese & Thai dishes are really stimulating & tasty.But I feel they must increase the number of staffs to meet need of every table.Moreover you are running out of fish preparations & mocktails in a Sunday evening is definitely uncool.Deducted half marks for that.Though we have to wait for quite a period of time to acquire our assigned table as it was not cleaned(lack of staffs,of course!) but surprisingly the service is reasonably fast & two waiters were responsive & courteous,well as much they can in that packed house!The ferry service to the island is also haphazard as it took us almost 30 minutes to sail.There is a road at the backside connecting the island with the land but that shouldn't be the preferred mode of communication of this amazing place,isn't it?Overall an unique place with some quality food but there is a huge room of improvement in terms of management.

How difficult it is to choose between Chinese and Indian dishes in a Restaurant?

Well, if you have been in my place you would have to debate between Chinese dishes in a houseboat with glass walls and sky-roof and a glass cottage beside a huge lake with dimply lit lawns and amazing pathway .Cafe Ekante at Eco Park offers you everything.

   I was here for the 1st time and I was perfectly bowled over by witnessing the panoramic view of the café located in an island. We came by car through the empty winding streets of Eco park besides the lake .We parked our car in the parking bay and travelled through the wooden bridge over the lake filled with exotic fishes .This place can also be reached through a boat from the Eco park end which we plan to utilize the next time we are here.

   The wooden bridges, the walkways and the cottages in the island are all illuminated after sunset providing you a breathtaking view. It may be for you to believe that such a place exists in Kolkata. The place is ideal if you are planning to escape your dull mundane work like to reach a lovely place by a short drive.

                 We decided to fill our insatiable appetite through with Gondhoraj chilled Sarbat, fish cutlets and Gondhoraj Kebabs which were delicious to live up to its name of being a premium restaurant .The beverages were quite nice .We began our main course from Luchi,Dal makhani .The luchi were all brought directly from the tawa and were hot and delightful.The Dal Makhani was average as it appeared water was added to it to increase its quantity .(We became so engrossed with food that we forgot to click pictures of the dishes.)Then we had Mutton Murg Masala with peas pulao which was yummy to make up for the Dal .At last we ended with Firni which is a classic Bengali desert. (But be prepare yourself to not find a few items available there from the menu card).

                                    I will strongly recommend this place to everyone who have never been there for a wonderful experience.

The place is a piece of heaven. Since it was cloudy accompanied with a little drizzle it was highly romantic if in pair or highly nostalgic if single. Staff is courteous, food is average. Some are out of the world,while some lacked seasoning. But the surrounding and ambience forces you u come back for more. 
We had fish fries,very fresh,thin crispy covering but lacked seasoning. Luchi,dhoka paneerrer dalna outstanding,rice good,daab chingri  again lacjed seasoning,not wowing. Aam pora shorbot tangy n fresh,baked rosogolla yummy malaisome but the winner was NOLEN GURER ICECREAM!!!!!! My expression ohhhhh..... It was more of khir loved it...
The walk down the bridge,little island,lake,boat styled chinese restaurant,cotrages around,lush green spread.....the lights in the evening....the best...

Cafe Ekante, located inside the sprawling Eco island offers unadulterated tranquility and panoramic view of the Rajarhat area. Eco park which is itself located on the outskirts of the city, the place is ideal for people looking for a short drive and avoid the rush of regular restaurants. 

But the visit should be planned keeping in mind the weather. It might get uncomfortable on a sunny and sultry summer day. Best time to visit would be during monsoons and winter. The waterside looks stunningly beautiful in the evening as all the walkways are illuminated after sunset. 

Now coming to the food. My friends and I went on a breezy Saturday during sunset for high tea. We were seated inside with a table with full view of the lake. Our order comprised of Masala chai, Cafe Latte, two portions of Chicken Pakoda and one portion of fish fry. 

The snacks were served within 5 minutes but the tea and coffee required couple of reminders before it arrived on the table. The chicken pakodas were very very well made with solid chicken filling inside and crispy & crunchy coating. The fish fry was served hot and crispy but the fish was a bit smelly which was disappointing. The beverages tasted average. 

I have heard from my friends that their bengali cuisine is top notch and I shall be back to try it out soon. I strongly recommend the place for its amazing ambiance and lakeside view.

If one has to compile a list of 3 restaurants in Kolkata with best view. I think this place will be one of them. How often do you find a houseboat in a lake that serves excellent food? How often do we find an island restaurents that also has a huge roof to floor glass facade that provides excellent view of the big lake all in aircon comfort. Not many....

This is a premium restaurent and serves excellent food. I suggest you come from gate number 1 in eco park and take a boat to reach here - although one can come in car also and take the wooden bridge from car park to reach here.

We ordered gondhoraj chicken tikka, bhetki paturi, tangda fish curry, aloo bhaja and rice. Chicken tikka was nothing exceptional, but superb indeed due to fragrance of gondhoraj lemon. Bhetki paturi was exceptional made from fillet of a fresh and big bhetki. Aloo bhaja portion was enough for 3 people and came with a twist of crispy curry leaves in it. Tangda fish curry was cooked in a bit north indian style - deep fried fish in a rich and thick creamy buttery curry. Would have enjoyed the extra large tangda in a pure bangali machher jhol cooked in mustard oil. Ordered tender coconut ice cream for dessert.

I recommend this place for almost all occasions - date, anniversary, business lunch, friends meet, family outing, anything. Be prepared to find that some items in the menu might not be available.

Okay if you are upto the eco park then try to pay a visit this place.. If u r not interested in food plz go for for a breathtaking view of this place. It's on a separated island in the middle of the water body of the park. They'll offer a ferry which is free of cost to visit the resturant but eating out is compulsory once if u r there.. 
Coming to the resturant food is upto the average though we didn't had choice to try out those fusion dishes. Still it won't make ur saliva to come out as the foods r finely on ur table. The decorations of this place is soothing with the pictures of famous bong peoples including cm😜 and some artistic ones.Talking about service it's not up to the mark. Definitely they need to improve it if they are interested in promoting their ratings. Ambiance wise it's a perfect place to have a quality time with your friends or loved one. Inspite of everything if u r a true lover of nature i'll definitely recommend u to pay visit this place.. The waterside view of the resturant with a cappuccino is a real bliss...

While you come to this place, you get the finest resort feel. It seems you are in a really expensive place. The island stands aloof from the lake, much larger in size, and is joined only by a small foot-bridge. You can walk around, sit about, and have a wonderful time looking at the wonderful lights of New Tow at night and the beautiful gardens all around at day - without even coming for the food (Just pay a Rs. 50 parking fee and you are done).

However, the problem comes with the food. 

I had gone there with relatives for a family occasion. It was a large group - 19 in all. I could not find a mobile charger, and nor could the staff help me find one - a major irritant right in the beginning. Then came the food. We had ordered some rice, tandoor roti, mutton something, butter chicken, dal makhni, chana dal and a few other items. Without going in the details of how each item was, I can tell that none was authentic. And was not tasty at all. For all the finery evident, and all the million dollar ambience outside, the quality and taste of food just killed it.

I would go there again. With hopes of a wonderful time. But with no hopes of fine dining. I can spare one wasted item. I cannot spare five six items and the opinion of a large gathering. 

Sorry folks. You need to buck up. This wonderful place deserves better!

Ain't pretermit this moment. However, wanna repeat this moment again to caress the lovely feel of it.

Having your dinner date on boat, what would you ask more than that? Nevertheless before it got started we waited near the shore as the outlet counter briefed us that card wasn't accepted there. Nonetheless they corrected it later and we were successfully able to cross the lake - they didn't charge for the boat if you would welcome yourself to be the customer of the restaurer. 
They provide you with three options for the place to dine in: first a big hall with beautiful adjoining; second a beguiling lawn, and then there's​ more exquisite colossal boat: which you espouse by default. 

Now let's come to food. We started with topsey batter fried with a hint of asafoetida, then for main course we chose Ekante's special platter which is a combination of poached egg, kasundi murgi, mutton boti, butter rice with cheesy fish steak. And it ended with a Bengali dessert - Nalen gurer ice cream.

Piquant it was. Whosoever haven't visited yet, must visit with your partners. Trust me it will be lovely.

The lunch time of this restaurant is 1-4p.m.  We reached ecopark at 2.30p.m. Bt after some time heavy rain came n the boat service was stopped for some time approx 1hour... My hubby called the restaurant n request to provide the lunch for us after 4p.m. n they agreed... We ordered sada bhaat, mug mohan, ekante pathar mangsho, masala kulcha n firni.. All tastes delicious 😋 😋 😋 😋.. Good job.

Who would have believed that Kolkata hosts such a beautiful place amidst a lake! Until now, I had only heard rumours on this beauty.
Cafe ekante can be reached via eco park gate 2 and then you take the boat ride or you take your car to the back side via the park lot area..If you're here with friends, you surely want to take your date on your second visit!
Coming to the food..I tasted the best mutton kosha in years with luchi at this place. Although the starters (chicken roast and fish kebab) were a bit dull, the mutton made up for it.
Must visit place :)

Visited this place few months back. It's in the Eco Park. The place is just awesome. One can seat outside of the restaurant which I personally recommend for the winter time. We had chicken reshmi kabab & their famous Nolen-gurer Ice-cream. Which was just awesome in taste..out-of-the-world.😍😍

A beautiful place with natural scenic ambience and good food if not the best, the Bengali fair is quiet interesting, though the continental part can be improved. Service could be more attentive, but the atmosphere is so soothing that it takes care of the rest. I would like to thank the tourism department to come up with a different outlet which is away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The only thing going for this place is the road that leads to it. And the boat that ferries you away from it. What lies in between those moments is an assault on the culinary senses of a person. We ordered two fish starters, kabuli naan, ekaante special mangsho, nolen gurer ice cream and drinks. One of the fish starters had this distinct annoying smell we relate to a fish market. The other one was edible. Kabuli naan erodes your faith from the entire universe of naans. If special mangsho tastes so ordinary, you can guess what standards they follow while preparing the dishes. Most of the reviews of this place point out that the food falls short of expectations. I wonder what stops the management from taking the feedback seriously and amending what is so apparently wrong with this place. Also, the service could be improved upon. The waiters are mechanical. These days their job description doesn't merely include the task of carrying plates from the kitchen to tables. One expects them to be hospitable and intuitive, two qualities that were uniformly missing in all the waiters.

Having a beautiful backdrop of the lake, Ekante had the potential to be a front-runner in the restaurant business but it miserably failed. It flounders to cash in on its attractive surroundings. The interior is quite plain. The pictures on the walls have an ill-placed Cafe Ekante logo embossed on them. Food was disheartening. The food of a regular Bengali household is better than theirs. We ordered aam-pora sorbet, fish fry, bhetki paturi, luchi, kabuli naan, ekanter kosha chicken and nolen gurer ice-cream. Fish fry was the only good thing. Bhetki paturi had a foul smell (and two fish-bones!), luchi was thick and hard, kabuli naan was a disaster, ekanter kosha chicken was ordinary and nolen gurer ice-cream was quite disappointing. Even the presentation of the dishes was tasteless. There is a lot to improve upon the service too. Price was quite high compared to the quality of the food they serve. A really distressing experience.

A very average affair. The food is not exceptional but is served with a lot of love. The sona moog dal was awesome though. Didn't quite like the pabda macher jhal as the taste of the shorshe pabda could be felt in this one as well. The chutney was a bit watery. The USP of the restaurant is not the food but the ambience as it is inside Eco park and bang beside the lake. It looks more beautiful in the evening. All in all a good place to visit once. There are way better bengali restaurants in the city. By the way, it might pinch your pocket a bit. It cost us 2400 for three people.

Being from the city of Kolkata, I feel sorry to give the restaurant such a poor rating, but can't help it either. The reason being : firstly, the staff there looked very disinterested in their work. Had to wait for long at the reception to get an empty table, while we could see lot of empty tables lying already ....only problem was that there was no proper co-ordination between the restaurant boys and the front office staff. Next, the waiter who took our order, came back after sometime to state that one of the items was not available. While taking the reorder, he didn't wait and left midway our conversation. Then somebody else had to be called again to take the remaining order. Again a long wait to get the food served. The waiter who was placing the crockery on the table, slipped spoons on the floor. Plates were placed so far from the persons, that we had to pull them in front of us. Meanwhile, we could see staff loitering lazily here and there, talking loudly among themselves and even one of them licking his hand after having his own food in the adjacent manager's room. Overall a very careless approach with very little supervision. Finally, the taste of food was not so good compared to the prices, particularly the "Daber Sarbat" and "Prawn Cutlets" tasted awfully bad. Only the "Fish Fry" among them was the saving grace which can be boasted of as a good snacks option here among the little choices given. Sincerely hope management will be more careful to give proper look into the affairs of the restaurant and will run it more efficiently, which is visited by a number of guests who are from outside the state and will carry an image of bengali hospitality from here.

Perfect ambiance, nice place, they will take you on a boat to the restaurant. Ambiance wise 5/5.
Coming to food. The Bengali dish is what we have ordered on that day.
Two combo, one cafe ekanta special and one mutton dish. Lanka chicken , Nun and Chitol Fish. 
Bill was around 2500.
Now regarding ekanta special combo... the fish was smelly and we find a small insect in the plate.
Though this was informed to the manager and he assured us to take the necessary action in this.

Apart from ekanta special, all other food was good, taste was fine and is not that spicy.

This place was beautifully lit up and ambience very romantic with a slight evening breeze of February month. We were seated in a glass door restaurant overlooking the lake, missed the open air but it was pleasant indoors which had photos framed of famous personalities eating bengali cuisine like Mamata Banerjee, Manna Dey etc plus bengali pharaphernelia like hand fan. Ordered a bhetki fillet crumb-fried for a starter which was served quickly, best part of the fillet was not much of a thick coating and batter, well marinated fish, just pure fish fillet. Ordered a murg pulao, ekante special platter and daab chingri for main course. Well murg pulao had chunks of boneless chicken but ws a bit sweet. Platter was lovely and all inclusive, couldnt hav asked for more on a plate. Fish cheese roll was yummm as extra cheese, chicken kasundi ws good tooo, went well with plain rice and pulao, mutton boti ws soft juicy well cooked meat. The daab chingri was very creamy and good size prawns, not very sweet  though and quite good quantity than most city restaurants. Dessert was hot baked rassogulla, again very creamy rassogulla and fabulous baked flavour. In all, tummy full and great food, a bit expensive but this ambience is worth it. Have to still try their oriental cuisine served on a floating boat themed restaurant.

First going to this place is very interesting,they provide you a free boat ride to reach this resurant. The ambience,the surroundings,the ambience,the decor...everything is beautiful and attractive. Coming to the food we orderes Daspuri Chicken Tikka which was spicy and delicious. I just loved it. For main course we ordered two platters; one with rice,vegetables and bhetki fillet stuffed with prawns- I found it innovative and it tasted good. The second platter contained mutton kosha,mutton keema chop and paratha- all tasted well. For deserts we ordered Nolen Gur er Ice-cream which was simply great. Food is a bit overpriced. Service is good. Food should be a imrproved a little.

So we went to this place after reading much reviews on zomato. Extremely small and everything is just so crammed up here!! You can see the lake if and only if you get a table by the glass walls of the restaurant. If you're seated inside, then its like any other average restaurant, nothing extraordinary. Next comes the food, which is again so normal, but yes the price is exorbitant. We ordered citrus lassi for 2 people (not in a mood to order anything else basically!) and paid 190 bucks for that. The tumblers were nothing great to look at also (paise to buss aise hi phoonk diye hum!). The thing which was served is lassi with a dash of lemon juice for that tang. Does it really cost you so much guys? Next awful thing is their pathetic service, so so so laid back and unprofessional. 
Will I come back again here? Never ever!
Recommendations? NO! you can go only if you have black bucks (money) :P Not for people like me :D

The location of Cafe Ekante is beautiful. The surrounding is so calm and serene. Authentic Bengali Cuisine is served here. So, this is a great place to visit with your family because the pocket pinch is on the higher side. 
For beverage and starter I had Chilled  Gondoraj Leboor Shorbot (quite refreshing and appetizing), Gulnar Jalpari (i.e. prawn tandoor) the size of the prawns were relatively small and the taste was also satisfactory, Vetkir Molayami Tikka (I really liked the kebabs). 
For main course I decided to opt for platters i.e Bangla Fusion -
1. Fillet of Betki stuffed with shrimps and cooked in double boiler and served with Herbed Rice and Veggies-
The fish was tender and the flavours and spices were exuding out of it pefectly. The veggies were also correctly boiled. Taste wise it's great.
2. Steamed Hilsa with mustard sauce served with fried fish roe, steamed rice and fiery chilli - I loved the fried fish roe, and they had served us good quality fish. They had also provided us with roasted papad.
For both the platter I felt that it was more that sufficient of a single person.
Then we had taken chutney which was too good, and bhaja papad.
Finally to satisfy my sweet tooth I had ordered for Nolen Gur Ice Cream, the aroma of nolen gur was absolutely amazing.
This restaurant is pretty amazing, most importantly the food is commendable.
A Highly recommended bengali restaurant.

If you are looking for a restaurant with a view then nothing beats this place. However, prepare yourself for mediocre food and service. Getting to this island-restaurant is fun. You either have to take a ferry that plies customers for free from the Cake Ekante kiosk to the island or cross a wooden bridge to get to Cafe Ekante. Both the ways are immensely fun. Go for the experience not for the food.

Cafe ekante is the cafe kiosk adjoining the Eco park.it can be reached either via car thru Gate no 1 or by a ferry from eco park gate 2.
The service is a bit slow. There is a good combination of Bengali fusion foods.The ambience is super for romantic evenings with a great view of nature.
We had Ekante special platter of butter rice,chicken ,mutton and fish.The mutton was soft and the chicken was 2 pieces however it was a bit spicy.However in spite of saying cheese fish,the amount of cheese was considerably low.Also we had Chicken steam and Bhetki fillet in shrimp.we finished off with garlic naan and navaratan korma and boleni gur ice cream.
The cost was moderate and the amount maybe slightly less compared to the cost.
Overall a good dining experience if u r looking for a dineout at eco park.

Now, as far as food is concerned, it is moderate but not being too junk. However, the best of all being only the Daab Ice Cream (green coconut flavored ice cream)...its so...so good...so all 👍 for this ice cream...the rest I leave upon you to try....

We reached late and were hungry enough to eat the chairs and tables by the time we were ushered in to the dining room after a wait of more than 45 minutes. The view was good, with the water outside the dining room lapping at the shore with the arrival and passage of every boat. The dining room, not very spacious and tables rather close to each other was tastefully decorated with interesting wall hangings and photographs. Those failed to make up for the waiting for the food. The service was s-l-o-o-o-o-w! It did pick up later since we were at the fag end of the lunch service.
When you are so hungry, yet the food doesn't seem to be that good, you know there is something wrong. The kababs were mediocre, the pulao wasn't enticing, the makhmali paneer, sugandhi bhetki and Thakurbarir kosha mangsho were all insipid and sweet. So much so, that we didn't want sweets afterwards. The only thing that was more than mediocre was the bill. The prices, compared with the quality, was rather on the higher side.
The so called seclusion was not evident during our visit because it was a holiday and the dining room, the nearby boat-house restaurant and the grounds were all chock-full.

Been to the Bengali food serving restaurant of Ekante earlier. Exorbitant pricing, not at all close to authentic Bengal taste. 
Poor parathas, pathetic baked Rasogolla. Though a green chicken was impressive. And Basanti pulao was fine. 
Over all, baring the ambience, it wasn't worth the bill. 

Yesterday been to the Chinese food serving restaurant, one on the floating boat. Again, 5/5 for the ambience. Food again priced bit high but good quality. Lamb dish was fantastic, chicken was good.
But no mocktails or sweet dish options much either for a fine done restaurant, is a let down.

Over all, it's a beautiful spot if you coming to relax around the scenic beauty around. Not ideal if having sumptuous food is your objective.

A gem of a restaurant located in the middle of a lake; I loved being here on my penultimate day in Kolkata. It has a nice ambiance, dimly lit, quiet with just the wind outside making the softest whisper. It was lovely dining here. Ambiance, therefore, gets a complete 5 from me.

Coming to food, it is very good. This is what we ordered: assorted oil fries (amish; good), Bekti filet marinated in mustard sauce wrapped in burnt leaf (loved this), and Bhapa sandesh and Nolen gurer ice cream (just delicious) and I thought the food was priced reasonably (give a thought to its mesmerizing location). So, food and value for money gets a 4 each.

Finally, the staff and service are good. They'll cater to your needs and assist you in any way with your food requirements. They get another 4.

 They have a wide variety of foods especially Bengali items. Quality and taste are okay but not outstanding. Prices are high in comparison to the taste.

However the best part of the experience is the location and the beauty surrounding it. Would strongly recommend for a  lunch with family on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

We did really enjoy the kabab, Navratan korma and vetki masala but the quantity is not sufficient for two foodie. This is a wonderful place for couples.

It's a proper mess to reach place.. We walked near about 30 minutes to reach and then waited for 1hour and 45minutes. Still they could'nt arrange a table for 5 people.  The staff members were behaving like they don't even care about this matter..  I never expect this sort of attitude from any service provider.
As we were already late we had to leave. And no matter about the quality of food, where service is such a mess we don't look forward to visit the place again

Top of the class place in our city of joy.


The boat ride is free if you go to the restaurant. 

If you are not going on a sunday afternoon then in general seats are available.

The place is cool.

The foods are indian and continental both.

There is open air dinning also available which also fascinating. 

While coming back keep the bill intact because the boat back to the eco park will ask for the bill.


You can also roam aroud the place as well which also has a small bridge with spectacular views of the eco park.

Worth a visit.

The ambience is all which makes it a must visit... It's located in an island in the eco park lake and you get a free boat pick up and drop if you want to have something here... The restaurant is boat shaped with proper view of the lake... Food and service were average... We had momos and lat me Kai... Both were okayish... But overall can visit this place for a different experience!

This place has its points only for the ambience and nothing else. The food is prepared poorly and is served cold. The average waiting time from order to delivery of food is over 45 mins if you want fish. This is not even close to being authentic Bengali food and the fusions that they have tried doesn't gel. The staff are listless and disinterested and the in-house decor is in poor taste.

This place has beautiful ambience,staffs are fairly well behaved,friendly,cost of food is over shooting,but quality wise it is terrific terrible.
I visited this place today and ordered the following items(comments under,item wise)
Lassi:fairly good
Banana leaf chop:fairly good,not spicy or has any different taste.homemade recipe is better than their 
Coconut prawn:fairly good,but it will not leave any satisfactory effect on your taste buds.
Basmati pulao: good,quantity is also sufficient for two.
Chicken dungbaglow: a TERRIFIC TERRIBLE TASTE..NO TASTE.

OVERALL THE RECIPES ARE JUST SO PLAIN...I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT GO BACK AGAIN....!!!!!

Cafe Ekante situated across the Eco Park lake is a large, well maintained and beautiful place.
We had a small meal at the houseboat. It's really picturesque out there. 
We had a fillet of fish with stuffed shrimp. The taste was OK but the accompanying rice was cold, which was a downside.
Go here for the beauty of the place. Food is OK but that is not the main USP here.

I visited this restaurant on a Friday to avoid waiting. And it worked, no waiting at all. The fastest way to reach the restaurant is via complimentary boat ride provided by the restaurant and you'll enjoy it. Or you can take the toy train (₹100/person) and walk for 5 min to reach the restaurant.

For starter I ordered-
• Crunchy Chicken Fillet served with Thousand Island Dressing: It was tasty but I believe they served it with Tartar Sauce instead!

For Main Course:
• Sada Bhat: Quality of rice was good
• Chingri Pulao: Good as per feedback
• Duck Bunglow Murgi: Taste was okay, not impressive, tasted sweet which I didn't like
• Ekanter Kasha Mangsho: A let down, tasted very sweet and bland, don't try if you love spicy mutton

For Desserts:
• Nolen Gurer Ice Cream: It is the only food that was really impressive. Must try, it's really really awesome! Next time I'll visit to have this ice cream only.

Ambience: 3/5
Food: 2/5
Cost: 2/5
Hospitality: 3/5

Overall, average experience. Staffs are cordial and the portions are sufficient.

The reason to visit this place:
• Boat Ride
• Ambience
• Nolen Gurer Ice Cream

Overhyped place. A strict no for vegetarians. The ambience though good being on the eco Park island gives some amazing view but the food is complete let down. We found only two staff in service even on a Sunday afternoon, made us to wait even for placing an order. They also suggest you to change your order according to their convenience. Sitting on the outer side of the boat also brings them inconvenience as they will forcefully request you to sit in the inner AC hall. Coming to food it is a total let down. No taste or presentation for even small items like club sandwich and baby corn chat. The cucumber mojito was also avoidable. Spoils your mood.

We had visited this place in a group. The surrounding ambience is good, with the great view of lake and greenery all around. However, coming to food, it was a bit disappointing. Pulao had the rices hard and pretty much tasteless. Mutton was good, but bhetki paturi didn't have bhetki in it!! The fried fish was okay, but u can get better versions anywhere else. Only good thing was nolen gurer ice cream, although a bit high on the sweet.

Oh yes, be ready to shell out approx 750-850 per head (ie, 1500-1700 for two - zomato has it wrongly stated as 800 for two) if u take starters to dessert, which seemed to be on a high side considering the food quality.

A bit over hyped place for its ambiance being on island of eco park. However it's ambiance is also over hyped, there is nothing to see at that place. However unique was only the boat ride to the place from eco park. Coming to food which is a total let down. Except nolen gurer ice cream we dint like any of the other items we ordered. We ordered chicken with thousand island dressing and topse mach bhaja for starters. There was no thousand island sauce with chicken, topse mach bhaja was a disaster, my mom cooks better topse mach bhaja than this. In mains orders some items from the fusion food section. Do not try fusion food here. It is total loss of money. None of them tasted good. The laccha paratha with mutton kosha and ilish bhapa with rice and fish roe were below average.
Having such a disastrous experience it burns a big hole in our pocket.

Lovely restaurant . Situated in an island between  a waterbody . This resort cum restaurant has two restaurants . One is a floating houseboat offering beautiful views of the lake and offers fusion and continental food. We had food at the restaurant offering north Indian and bengali food. The food was so good. We had basanti pulao with mutton kosha and chicken dakbungalow. Tasty and so good. The tangri kebab was also super good in starters. We finally ended with nolen gur er ice cream. A must visit place!

I have given Rating on the basis of its location and ambience only. I ordered starters fish with Batter, chicken and was very much disappointed as i felt those were not fresh. Chicken starter was actually cold and on complaining they heated it in microwave maybe but it tasted terrible. We then asked manager to give us the best fresh items they hv and he recommended Chicken Dakbunglow  and bhapa Ilish.. Bhapa Ilish dint hv salt and chicken dint hv any good taste. I had to eat rice and sweet dal to fulfil my appetite. It was a great disappointment . They however served good nolen gur Ice cream. 
I aint visiting there ever.

First of all it's a beautiful place,u have to take a boat ride to go to this island where this restaurant is situated at Eco Park and the boat ride is free if u grab a bite at that restaurant. we went there at the evening just for quick bite,the boat restro was not ready at that time yet. nice place,good service, we ordered luchi,alurdum,polao and chicken kosha,everything tasted nice,but the best part was the view of the setting sun,you will definitely forget ur at Kolkata,its a beautiful, calm place,loved it,will go there again.

I'm a little scandalized that a Bengali place in a spanking brand new part of Kolkata, does not know or chooses not to know what exactly a luchi is.

We visited this place in search for evening snacks on a Sunday evening around 6pm. Thanks to the limited seating (10 tables around) that this place has, we had a waiting time of almost half an hour. Once inside, I was a bit disenchanted by the ambience. Nothing to write home about. The houseboat option may have been better but it was a slightly hot day, so we chose to sit inside.

We ordered luchi and kosha maangsho. Each plate of luchi had 4 pieces and ko and behold, we were served mini bhatoore in the name of luchi! I won't say they tasted bad, but I am still scratching my head over why a Bengali place would not serve authentic luchis. The maangsho was pretty good however.

We then ordered the nolen gurer (new gud) ice cream - going by the reviews on Zomato. So good this was! Definitely don't miss this!

Overall, an okay place with average-ish food. 

Tip- Come post sunset and sit outside near the lake.

Had a very bad experience here. They take a lot of time to give the food. Also the person sitting on the counter was not professional at all. His way of talking was not tolerable. Despite giving the order an hour back, they denied that the order was not placed! The person who took the order completely denied.
Would suggest others not to come here as there are plenty of other places where u will get quality bengali cuisines.

This place is a must visit - more so for the ambience than the food. Having said that, the food does taste good, but it is not extraordinary. We went there during Durga Puja for a family lunch, and we weren't disappointed. There is something here for everyone. The place was nicely decorated for Durga Puja and the dhakis just added to that special feel. We were seated right beside the glass wall so we had quite a view. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Daab Chingri, plain rice, and Bhuna khichdi platter. The platter came with a big bowl of khichdi with a side of mutton bhuna. The mutton was really tender and well cooked. The platter also had traditional Bengali sides of chutney, papad, and sandesh. As for the Daab Chingri, it was my favourite of the lot (as am a little biased towards seafood!) For dessert, we had baked rasgulla and Nalen gurer icecream. The icecream was nothing special but they baked the rasgulla to order (hence we got an amazing plate of piping hot, and creamy rasgullas!!)
Overall, the food could have been better but the ambience stole the show! Would definitely go back for that.

My family and I visited Ekante cottage situated in eco park, to have a small vacation. We arrived there in the morning and later in the noon, we were hungry. So we dropped down to cafe ekante. It is situated in the same room with the receptionist. Once entering, it is covered with glass so it is see through. However, i gave a very low rating due to the following reasons that i have observed:
• The floor is very messy, and so is the table. We were seated on a table where both the table and chairs were dirty with rice grains and all that.
• We placed the order and it took us a little less than half an hour to get our food. Hence, slow service. 
• We ordered for three chicken thali, and 2 mutton thali. The server actually confused which one is what and gave us the wrong thali. Please train the servers properly.
• When we were done eating, we were not given finger bowl for a long time. We had to ask for one, then they gave us. Same with tissue papers.
• I hated the ambiance. Some kid was crying, very crowded and messy. Hated it.

Maybe i was there during the busy hours but still its not any reason to be this messy. I expected better.

The restaurant is placed on the lake side of Eco Park and you can go there by boat from Eco Park or just drive ahead by taking left prior to the parking lot before entrance of Eco Park. The setting of the place is actually great with soothing view in evening. Good ambience around.

There are two restaurants, one with Bengali Cuisine (Open Air) and anothed serving only Continental (AC). We opted to sit out and to our surprise there were only 5-6 listings for North Indian Cuisine. We ordered, but the food served turned to be a disaster and actually had to force the food down. Good that we didn't over order. Sitting indoors is a better option as stray dogs also roam around easily. A big NO if you are going for North Indian Cuisine.

Overall, I'm not going back for food but would definitely go back for the view around and give a try to their Continental House Boat Restaurant.

A lake side cafe located admist such beautiful landscape is sure to take ones breath away . One can reach there by car taking the road towards back side of eco park , or directly via boat from the eco park cafe ekante jetty near gate 2. The set up is fairly nice keeping bengal as a theme for interiors. We visited in the best time of evening so could enjoy the falling colours as well as the lightings later at night time , both was picturesque and the melodious old instrumentals continuously played in that entire space made it all very mesmerizing.
Since the maincourse menu was not available , We settled for two cups of Cafe Latte and assorted non veg fries including egg devil, mutton chop, fish cutlet and prawn cutlet one each. The cutlets were decently sized, tasted average and the coffee was fairly good too.
Overall i would say its a must visit spot for spending a quite evening for couples, friends and family , the scenic beauty is sure to uplift your mood and sooth your soul.

Bored with the usual lounges or cafés and looking for some inspiration away from the hustle and bustle of the city- look no further beyond Café Ekante.. the ideal destination for a calm and peaceful evening amidst the  serenity of nature.. This place scores a home run when it comes to ambiance.. a perfect spot for a romantic outing with your special ones.. the restaurant is situated in the Eco island and you need to take a boat ride to reach the Café from the shores.. there is a boathouse, and a floating café as well along with this one..

This place is basically owned by the State Government, hence they specialize is authentic Bengali cuisine, even the interiors exude rural bengal through its decor.. however service is a sore point which is quite understandable and servers were too inexperienced to handle a capacity crowd.. Since we went in the evening, so basically sampled two starters and that’s it:
Prawn Cutlet: Two cutlets made from minced tiger prawns, deep fried and served with mustard.. honestly speaking you hardly feel the prawns and mostly the cutlets are filled up with onion stuffing..
Gondhoraj Murgi Tikka: Chicken Tikka Kebab flavored with gondhoraj lime.. actually loved the marination which is different from the usual tikka kebab.. not too spicy and a simple, authentic touch.. however the chicken morsels were too stiff and needed a bit more cooking time in the tandoor..

Along with the starters we had couple of Green Teas to wrap up a perfect soothing evening.. Costs are surprisingly on the higher side even though you expect more economical pricing in a government backed restaurant.. Our total cheque was Rs. 650/- (all incl.).. However I will surely go back, this time to dine in the houseboat or may be spend some quality time in the beautifully decorated pristine cottages..

Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 2.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Café ekante is situated in Eco park but on the other side of the lake. They take you there on a boat and even bring you back on that same boat or you can even go by foot on a bridge. The ambience of this place is amazing. It is very secluded and romantic.This place is perfect for romantic dinners.We had orderded luchi,cholar dal, bhetki paturi and kosha mangsho. The mutton and the fish were excellent. The mutton was tender with no fibre at all. The luchi was fluffy and quite large in size. We had a beautiful lunch in the lap of nature. The staff is very amiable and the service is pretty good. An excellent place to unwind.:)

Great great ambience, beauty of this place is incomparable. Situated in the middle of Eco-park island and can be reached either by taking a boat from Eco-park or by a back side rode followed by a 10 minute walk over a wooden bridge constructed over the Eco-park lake. Visited this place for 3 times and have tasted over 8-9 different cuisines.The food quality and taste was not upto the mark at all . Cost of the food compared with the quality and the taste delivered, simply says, cost is made out of its ambience. Apart from this, if any one wants to spend some time in a beautiful ambience this is a must visit place for them.

It was a wonderful experience to visit this cafe on the eco park island.They have free ferry service to the restaurant.You need to visit this place just for the ambience.

Food ordered : Pomfret Stuffed with Shrimps and Fried, Topshe Fry and Prawn Cutlet.

The cutlets were nicely shaped in the form of fish,tasted like deep fried balls of prawns and potatoes.
Topshe fry was nicely done.The fish was fresh and well cooked.
Star of the show was the Pomfret stuffed with shrimps.It was spicy,deep fried with well coated batter and tasted delicious.

Staffs were well-behaved and efficient.Service was excellent too.
The food was a bit over prized but quality was good......

It was a wonderful experience to visit this cafe on the eco park island. The travel by boat, the sitting arrangements beside the lake and charming atmosphere, all were addictive and had us mesmerized especially if you are accompanied by your special one. But and there is a but to this extremely beautiful cafe which is the food. The sole reason why one would pay a visit to this place which is far away from the city is to have good food. And here my friends the cafe falls flat. The food was not good at all. The assorted fries were cold and were super spicy. The godhoraj drink was equally bad and had no flavour or smell of the lemon. This was unexpected. Maybe I have not tried the other items but the morning shows the day. And I hope the quality of the food improves, otherwise the experience would not have a lasting impression if you are coming out without a happy tummy.

A wonderful, wonderful experience! It isn't just the food or the ambience that does the trick. It is the combination that is so perfect.
We had ordered a variety of Indian and Continental dishes, and were not disappointed with anything - quality and quantity both exceeded expectations.
For dessert, the Nolen Gurer Ice-cream is to die for. By contrast, the baked rasogolla was really not that good. (That cost them the 0.5 I deducted!)
The service is excellent too - well-behaved, prompt and efficient. Something that you don't generally associate with the State Government!
All in all, if you haven't been here already, you really should, because if you don't, you are certainly missing out.

Prokriti tirtho - where the din and bustle of the city doesn't reach and such a peaceful arena, cafe ekante is really a place to have food ekante. Went for a family lunch on a rainy sunday afternoon. Though quite a deep inside but it's worth travelling. Ambience is fine though the background nature wins the heart. Very good bengali food and they serve quite fast. Psoto bora and thakurbarir kosha mutton must try. I liked the khejur amsatto chutney pretty different and tasty too. All-over a super place.

Last weekend, on Sunday, we had been there for Bengali Lunch. Their service is degrading day by day. This is my fifth time I was having food in this restaurants. First I came here about 1 and half years ago when this just opened. At that time their service and food quality was far better than what it is now. Their stuffs don’t know much about the menu and seem stumbling when you ask for any menu. Not professional at all. 

Food prices are very high now and quality is below average. We ordered two items from their Bangla Fusion Menu. One is “Steamed Hilsa with Mustard Sauce served with Fried Fish Roe, Fiery rice and Fiery Chilli ". Another one is " Fillet of Betki stuffed with Shrimp and cooked in Double Boilerand Served with Herbed Rice and veggies" . First one was not worthy at all to try. Second one was okay. We were 6 people and the bill was 3500 RS. The food was not worthy to this price at any way.
Only good thing about this Restaurant is the location, ambience and the view. So I won’t recommend this Restaurant but only for snacks/Chop and Tea which we tried before few times and those were good (don’t know how these are now).

Pathetic .. location is good , have so many cafes. But service and system are awful. Didn't get Tea/coffee @ sunday evening 6;30 pm .. ordered Chilled sharbat of gandharaj .. but they served just cold lemon water. Even you wont get snacks for evening as well. Its Pathetic.

Great ambience ...the location of ekante is the major factor that one wants to go there again and again. It's even more thrilling if you take a jetty to cross the lake and then land up to ekante rather than directly going to ekante bt car.the jetty service is free. ..so a boat ride is a bonus. The food price is a bit over prized but quality is good

I went there on a humid day, and really had to wait for the boat to come and take us..
Even though the timing was correct, the restaurent delayed to open..

The ambience and the decor is more likely to be show case of bangali ghor.

Coming to food, I ordered Polao
, Steamed Bhetki Served with pickled chilly and herbed cheese 

and Kacha lonka diye murgi.

Food was good, liked the fusion of bhetki with cheese and pickle however the chicken was ordinary and polao was very less in amount.

Price is not considerable to the quality they serve.

However while returning I enjoyed being on boat as the view of the newtown city was awsome from the lake

It was a beautiful evening, along with a uniquely beautiful friend, I spent good 15mins in locating the place. To my surprise, eco Park seems well managed so far, with small hoardings referring to the road to take. Ohh btw it was raining. Can it get better than that? I zoomed my car on the road which takes you to the eco cottages. I quickly parked the car and headed to the only route available to the cottages. Passing the tiny cottages, and maneuvering the surroundings with gleeful eyes, I was in awe of the place already. Passing a restaurant, our eyes got stuck at the houseboat attractively placed on the lake. The view was spectacular. You don't get to see views like that in Kolkata. We were seated on the edge out of the houseboat. Yes it wasn't Air conditioned. We quickly ordered two of the top veg. starters available on the menu with a cucumber mojito. Too many virgins has gone down the throat before this one. The service was slow, but I got no complains as the views, breeze were an ideal setting. 

Our orders in order. 1. Mushroom & Corn Tikka - was the standout of the two starters we had ordered. Never a Tikka with mushroom tasted so good. 2. Mushroom Cheese Toast with Potato Wedges & Dip - Potato Wedges tasted just as all the potato Wedges, but the dip was yum. The mushroom cheese toast wasn't upto the mark. 

Overall, the experience was real and beautiful. I would like to see more of vegetarian starters on the menu and more options of mocktails.

You have to be there to believe what all the hype is about, and deservingly so! The atmosphere wins half the battle. A beautiful view of the lakes, away from the hustle and bustle of the city and a nice serene environment to have a lazy lunch with close ones! We tried the kababs 'bhetki machher molayemi tikka' and the 'daspurir lonkar chicken tikka' both of which were fantastic. Soft and succulent and well flavoured. However, transport to this place is a bit of a hassle if you're not taking your own car. Otherwise it is quite the place to be.

Amid the hustle and bustle of everyday life,if you are looking for some relaxation then Cafe Ekanta is the place ....it has got the most perfect ambience one can ask for !! The food was nothing extraordinary but good, though the achari fish kababs stands out !!! the staffs are very friendly ...hence,the place is soo good that you will forget about all the shortcomings ...

Cafe Ekante, as the name suggests gives you the surreal experience of solitude amidst a breathtaking natural view. Located inside the Eco Park premises at Rajarhat, it's a lovely place to visit with your family and  friends. Coming to the food at the cafe, they serve Bengali cuisine mostly with an option of Bengali fusion food as well. I went there with my friends on a weekday afternoon, and we got to savor some amazing fare. 

Starting with the starters-- we ordered BHETKI PATURI and EKANTE SPECIAL ACHARI FISH TIKKA. Th fish tikka was succulent and just melted in the mouth, and tasted superb. The paturi was delicious with just the right amount of mustard sauce, wrapped in the customary banana leaf.

For the main course, we had ordered GOSHT BIRIYANI, BHUNA GOSHT, LUCHI, NARKEL DIYE CHHOLAR DAAL and  KACHALONGA DHONEPATA DIYE MURGI. The Biriyani and Gosht were good, nothing out of the ordinary. The Luchi kind of tasted like an overdose of dalda, but the chholar daal and the dhonepata murgi made up for it, as they tasted delicious.

Now, for the hero of the meal, the DESSERTS.. Yummilicious is the word. We had BHAPA SONDESH, BAKED ROSOGOLLA, NOLEN GUR er ICECREAM, LAL DOI and PHIRNI. All of these, especially the Baked Rosogolla were just heavenly.

Service -- 4/5
Food -- 4/5
Location & Ambience -- 4.5/5
Pocket Pinch -- 3.5/5

Overall, a nice place to spend some quality time with your loved ones. Do visit.

When you feel lost in the hurly burly of the city, and you need to let your hair loose, you feel like walking away, even if for a few hour, to some place nice and quiet. Some place where you can feel lost, yet a place where you can find yourself. A place where you can reinvent yourself. Cafe Ekante, as the name might already give away, will give you just that.
                                                                ...

Ordered bhaja muger daal,jhur jhure alu bhaja, sada bhaat,topsey fried, chingri malaikari. I must say what worst decision I took coming to this restaurant. The muger daal was pathetic,being a prawn lover I always prefer prawn while eating out.Believe me the prawn malaikari was so bad to taste,prawn was almost under cooked and the curry didn't at all blend with the prawn,the topsey dish somehow tasted stale might be because the fish was not fresh. I will never suggest my near ones to go here. Ambience alone cannot satisfy good food lovers. It was a pain reaching the destination on this rainy day.

First thing that catches one's attention is the beauty of the place. Very aesthetically pleasing landscape & decor. The 'by-the-lake" cafe is what the usp is. We had their special buffet of the day comprising of topse fry, mutton kosha,beguni,basanti pulao,luchi,cholar dal,chingri diye potol,doi,misti(aam rabri roll). Everything was served piping hot. The topse fry was DELICIOUS! And so was the cholar dal & potol chingri. The gravy of the potol chingri was actually so awesome..2nd best to my mom!! The mutton kosha was a bit disappointment, the gravy tasted nothing like bong mutton kosha,if i want to have mutton from mughlai cuisine,i would order that and not mutton kosha specially in a restaurant which specializes in bengali food.Overall, quality of food-wise,its good but not awesome. The aam rabri roll was also excellent!! Given the fact that this is restaurant serving bengali food right in the heart of bengal, i felt the prices are a bit steep.May be,they charge you for the ambiance!! The service was excellent. Staff was very courteous & inquired about the food!! Brownie points for that!! In a nutshell,will go back for sure & try out more from thier menu!!

Cafe Ekante(Meaning Isolated) is an amazing place situated inside Eco Park. This cafe just stands out with the rich experience it provides and it has taken a level up when compared to its ambiance and food.

It has 6 outlets (All inside Eco Park) - all provides you an unique Dining pleasure. Options like Lake side Open Cafe, House Boat Cafe, Island Style Cafe etc. The Ferry ride which will lead you House Boat and Island Style cafe will outweigh your bill.

Tried Bhetki Fillet Marinated in Mustard sauce wrapped in burnt leaf and Prawn Cutlet with Packaged drinking water. I will be interested to try Main course with Desserts. Food Quality and Quantity - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Ambiance - 5/5

Value for Money - 5/5

Lovely ambience! Lovely food!!
I have been here earlier also.Big fan of this place.
Starting from the entry you feel yourself to be in a serene world.Its like you are away from all the chaos .A walk on that wooden plank is mesmerising with the lake view and cottages all around and the light music is like icing on the cake.
Coming to the café..there are two cafés
One is café on the boat having north Indian menu with their signature dishes of course and various mocktails.As the menu is limited which i found.
And the other one is having pure Bengali cuisine which we dint try.
We have been to the café on the boat which is basically designed as a boat only with all the yellow lights.They have waiting couches outside and two to three tables for sitting outside and enjoying the view.we preferred sitting inside as it was little hot outside.
It is little crowded on weekends.so we had to wait a bit for our turn.
The manager was hospitable and greeted us with a smile and helped to manage a table for us.so coming to the food
We ordered moctails first.As it's a season of mangoes we order mango delight and cucumber mojito.Loved it's taste..but the mango one was over sweetened.but the mojito was just perfect and very refreshing.
Then we ordered a chicken dish..I don't remember its name exactly..But it was really good more like chicken lolipops .They served it with a sause basically a chilli sauce.perfect blend of all the ingredients.
The chicken was fresh and perfectly cooked.
But we found the service little slow as there was only one waiter running here and there.We were feeling pity for that guy as everybody was yelling at him only..they must have atleast 3waiters in that café as people are really liking this concept and getting attracted to this place.
Finally we ordered nolen gurer ice cream in the dessert.It was delicious.
And The prices are reasonable enough!!
Overall experience was good!!😃😃😃

I went to the bengali restaurant of cafe ekante.  There are excellent bengali preparations available on the menu. We ordered gondhoraj lebu sorbot. It was very soothing and tasty. Then we ordered kebab, moroger polau and kasha chicken. For desserts we had natun gurer ice cream.  Each and every dish was very tasty. The man who took orders was very courteous. The location of the place is divine. We took a boat ride from  eco park to the cafe.  The ride is free provided you buy food from the cafe. The polau quantity was a little less for two people sharing a plate. But the quality and taste supersedes that shortcoming. Do try the natun gurer ice cream. Its heavenly and quite like the one I had at bhojohori manna.

The cool breeze and the picturesque surrounding nailed it, and made my day. The food was great and felt greater because I had food from Bengali cuisine after a while. The hospitality is great and the pocket pinch totally worth the ambience, food and hospitality.

Picturesque venue. Beautiful decor. The ambience is soothing and calm. Go there if you wish to take great outdoor pictures. But for the food its a thumbs down from my side. You get far better authentic Bengali cuisine all over the city in half it's price. It is so overpriced and the quality and the quantity both are unsatisfactory.  

Started with posto vada which was merely okayish. The fried topsey batter was better. We then had prawn cutlet which was just above average. The marinated bekti fillet wrapped in banana leaves somehow did not taste the way it should have tasted. Okayish again. 
The Basanti polao we had was I felt the only dish that I kinda liked. Along with the polao we took one doi rui which again was just average. 
For drinks we got coke, lassi and a fresh lime juice. 
Very average food extremely overpriced.

The ambience itself deserve 5 star. Located on the island in Eco Park, there is a free boat ride to the restaurant. The cool soothing breeze, well maintained property just filled the heart before we started filling up our tummy. Eu de Cologne soaked chilled refreshment towel was nice touch. Our menu was very sleek... Tandoori Roti, Thakurbarir Panthar Mangsho (special discount was there today)and Chingri Polau. All were prepared very delicately. Please don't expect tongue biting taste as the target group of the restaurants are not the regular urban people, but the business class ones. Hospitality was satisfactory. In one word, it worth a visit.

There are 2 restaurants inside Eco Park and this one serves just Bengali food. You need to visit this place just for the ambience. Service was good as well but the food quality was not very good and hence a lower rating. In terms of ambience, there is no other restaurant in Kolkata which offers anything close to what this place does. Just chill and relax and really ignore the food.

Good fun way to reach here !! You go into Eco Park Rajarhat and you get a boat straight away to take you to the mid of the lake where you get to find the beautiful Cafe Ekante. Beautiful place for a romantic evening. The decor is good and soothing and thus was the food. I ordered a Cappuccino and a Purbhora Paneer Kebab. The service is a bit slow. The food came in around 25mins. The Paneer was soft but the stuffing in it was nothing much special. The price is a bit on the higher side but the taste will suffice it. over all a good experience.

The food is not at all good. All the starters are fried in the same batter, very disappointing. The ambience is extraordinary and so is the resort but sadly the food will not please you at all. Although it's a pure Bengali restaurant but still needs to improve a lot. The customers may visit this resort just for the ambience but not for the food.

This place, new to Kolkata is a great escape from hot summers day. The ranking is only for the ambience. The food is not really great. rashid miya's boti kebab is good. The bhetki paturi though, had overdone the chilly and mustard. The fusion food is ok. The prawn with jaggery and fennel is good, but the rice helping is too much for the small quantity of the dish. The service lets the whole place down. The guy serving our table was sulky and did not follow instructions. He served mutton on my mom's plate though she is a vegetarian and even after we told him not to. Thankfully the person who replaced him was very helpful and nice. Overall, this place is good for its ambience and few dishes, but that's about it.

The restaurant across the lake, Café Ekante, serves only Bengali food to the hungry souls like yours truly. Before reaching this place, you have to be ferried across the lake to Eco Island and on your ferry ride back, you must not forget to carry the cheque with you. The last time I visited, there was no extra charge for the to and fro ferry rides – however, it is possible that the same is included in the service charge. *cough*

Since my friend and I are quite the appreciators of well-prepared fish items, we decided to try a plate of Prawn Cutlet. The cutlets, which were nicely shaped in the form of fishes, tasted a lot like deep fried balls of prawns and potatoes.
Encouraged by the taste and the serving style of our appetizer, we ordered the Steamed Bekti Fish in Pickled Chilli and Herbed Cheese. The fish was burritoed inside a leaf and served with chutney and onion rings. It tasted of pickle in places and cheese in others. I prefer boneless fishes and I feel that bekti was quite the right choice. It was soft, tasty and nicely integrated with the ingredients. 

We owe our last order largely to our server for his wonderful recommendation of Nolen Gur Ice-cream, made of date palms and jaggery. The flavour was new to my taste buds and it tasted incredibly good – totally irreplaceable by other flavours (besides chocolate, c’mon!). 

Overall, I must convey that the food is not cheap here, but the experience is worth being cherished. The location is fantastic during sunset, and the ambiance is quite pleasant, though not exquisite.

How did this even cross the 3 rating mark?

I have seen beautiful pictures of the place from one of my friends and had made up my mind to visit the place. Where in Kolkata do you get a chance of having food almost on an island ?
A boatride in eco park took us to this place and the feeling was great and different. The ride was free from the restro and you would have to consume food there. The place had an AC restro and outside sitting arrangements. We had to wait for some time till our name was called up from the list of guests. We ordered for fried chicken fillets which was good. Seeing the pricing in the menu you will hope at least decent food, if not something wow. Then came basanti polao and chicken kasha. The polao was the worst I have ever tasted and I can even cook a little better than it after some cooking sessions. The chicken kasha was again damn average and you can taste similar food in different Street stalls in Kolkata. The chicken was less flesh and more bones too.
The waiters are dressed in ethnic attire and are polite but not well trained.
While coming back on the boat, our fellow passengers were regretful that they could not taste food as by the time they arrived there was a long waiting list. I laughed and told them so lucky you are.
The only plus point in visiting the place is the location. On a sunset afternoon, when the cool breeze hugs you by the lake water, that feeling is good.

Place, ambience, decor simply heavenly. HOWEVER the food quality is a total dud. 
Big turn off is the segregation of Bengali cuisine from the Mediterranean cuisine areas... If brilliance is the word for the houseboat restaurant, pathetic would be the word for the food they serve. 
In short suggest people to visit place,  get a cup of tea /coffee and pen down a few thoughts sitting on the benches by the lake... That would indeed be surreal

The setting of Cafe Ekante is it's USP. Right across the lake from Eco Park with the glittering lights on the Rajarhat Expressway and the buildings beyond visible from the cafe make for a beautiful experience.
Not to be outdone is the quality of food served, making an outing there to remember.
We had 
Prawn cutlets which were so so, 
Fillet of bhetki marinated with french mustard and crumb fried which was perfect,
Jhurjhure alu bhaja with dal and white rice and
Gondhoraj Mutton which was fantastic.
Definitely worth going back to try more preparations.

It's just Awesome.When u stay at Ekante Cottagea u will enjoy the best.

I Checked in at Afternoon and hit Cafe Ekante. The ambiance was just Awesome.It was well decorated with Jamini Roy Painting with some collage of Hookahs and a majestic Guitar.

At first I ordered Gilafi Kabab. At that time the staffs insist me to have Tangri Kabab. Which is a bit different from usual tangri kabab.I also tried the Masala Tea. Both were Awesome.

During the Dinner I tried Gilafi Kabab.It's a type of Sheek kabab but really great.In main course I tried Special Non Veg platter. It consist of Butter Rice with Egg Poach, Fish Butter Kabab,Mustard Chicken and Mutton Currey with Papad and Salad. It is more than suffice for a person. I complete my dinner with Nolen Gurer Icecream. All the foods were just too good.

Next day a Giant breakfast was awaiting. It was a complimentary breakfast buffet.

There was bread toast with butter or jelly. As well as there was boiled egg, upma, luchi aludom,Chicken Sausage, Boiled beans,potato fry,omelet , cornflakes with milks and so many things with tea,coffee  fruit juice and fresh fruits and Salads..

So I will insist all of the foodies to stay at Ekante Cottagea and enjoy the fullest of Cafe Ekantea..

A must visit for the ones who love scenic beauty around while eating their favorite food.
I loved this place for the beauty it offers around while dining.
Best part is that it is in Ecopark itself, so you can visit the park, do some activities here and head towards the Café Ekante for dinner.
This place is surrounded by lake. It has tasty fish dishes, I loved the seafood they are offering here :)
Would definitely visit again :)

wonderful ambiance and very courteous team. but very poor food quality. I ordered for pulao and dukbaglo murgi along with sona muger daal and jhuri aloo bhaja. The  dukbanglo chicken was just boiled chicken dippen in a very ordinary chicken jhol. Anyone who had dukbanglo chicken from Bhojo Hari Manna will be surprised to taste this food. 

Either you improve your recipe or just name it "Pati Murgir Jhol" 

Will never visit again.

Visited this place for lunch...wonderful ambience & views...in fact, that's the only good thing about this place....had ordered for prawn cutlets, pomfret stuffed with shrimp n shallow fried, basanti pulao & mutton kasha... the pulao is very dry & doesn't taste as it should...the pomfret preparation & the prawn cutlets were okayish...but they badly messed up with the mutton kasha. When they brought it the first time, I told the waiter that it didn't look or taste like mutton kasha. He apologized & said that it was someone else's order which was served to me by mistake & took away the dish... after a while, he brought it back with 1 piece mutton less...when I brought that to his notice, he again took it back & got back to us after some time with another plate of mutton kasha which nowhere tasted like it should...the gravy was undercooked & we could taste of the raw masala....As it was so bad, we returned the dish & ordered for prawn masala...thankfully, that was better & the prawns were fresh... It was not at all a pleasant experience & I would not like to visit that place again

Awesome ambience, amidst all waters around, reminded me of our cottages in havelock islands. But if you are going for a dining plan, make sure you cover yourself well as the mosquitoes there are never in a mood for mercy 😆😆
However, we had some snacks there & the food was good too. Try the masala tea, that was wow for me!
Definitely a go for everyone!

A blissful experience. A must visit for couples as well as families holidaying or lazing about Eco park on weekends.
For hunger calls and for romantic endeavours a must visit there.
Starting from the ferry ride (free) that takes you to the restaurant located on an artificial island to the food , ambience , service .. everything is perfect.
A must have is their bhetki paturi , the yellow rice , daakbunglow chicken and ofcourse the nolen gurer ice cream !
Would love to come back again and again here whenever i am around
Also , this should be featured in the romantic collection !

Went there a couple of days back. 
I measure all restaurants on the 'value for money' or 'bang for the buck' they provide. On that scale this one scores poorly. The 'gondho' was missing from the 'Gondhoraj Lebur Shorbot' and the Ekante Special Achari Fish Tikka has a long way to go to catch up with the likes of Sigree Global Grill or  Barbeque Nation. I mention these places, because price wise they are the same. I can only recommend this place to lovelorn couples who would be more interested in gazing at each other's eyes or gaze together at the Eco Park Lake, and won't be too interested in what's passing through their mouth. At 60 % of the listed price, this place would become value for money for everyone, couple or otherwise .

This is limited to their small outlet writhing the eco park and not on the main restaurant. The place was neat and the service was nice and there were nice deck chairs to sit and enjoy. The place also arranges sunset cruises for an hour everyday around 4 30 and served a lot of snacks ... Including non veg savouries and tea.. A welcome drink etc... At 300 it's a good offer with the water ride thrown in.

Located in d eco park , rajarhat d place is a bit tough to locate. One should enter by d Eco park gate no 1 to reach to d cafe. Its much easier for u to access if u have ur own car. D restaurant offers picturesque view and d most romantic ambience u can ask for. We went there on valentine's day.d restaurant was full. Bt surprisingly we wait for just 5-6min.d waiter was very courteous and he served us food like a pro. We ordered chatpata pander tikka, cox bazar murgi tikka ,butter naan , chicken butter masala and 2cokes. D food was awesome. D butter masala was a bit sweet. D price was moderate. Over all a happy experience.
P.s. we were so engaged in eating that we forgot to click pics of butter naan and chicken butter masala :p :p

One new destination of Bengali food.. The best thing.. Ambince.. What can be needed when u get a restaurant in an island...
Coming to food.. We have tried.. Prwan cutlet, sona mug dal ( taste is just superb), cox bazar mutton, posto bora, dhaniya chichen ( owsum in one word).. With dal we have tried posto bora also.. This is a restaurant where u can get fusion type of kebab.. Nothing exception in kebab.. But the taste is very good and very well cooked..last but not the least the desert.. Nolen gurer icecrm.. What I can say .. Heavenly...
Now the overall experience is quite good.. But do keep a note it is not at all pocket friendly.. We went there with a group of 5 people and it was 700 rs per head..
But yes u should visit this once.. Going to a restaurant by a feri ( boat) is itself an experience.. Is not it? :)

Amidst a big lake in one of the extensive parks of the city lies Cafe Ekante.....a nice place for some Bengali food. The to and fro ferry service from one side of Eco Park to the opposite Cafe Ekante also makes it worth visiting. The restaurant has a rich Bengal feel and the decor is done commensurate to its taste. The menu is limited but the presentation is good. You can expect a good lunch or dinner but there's not much variety in appetizers. Only kebabs were available to go with coffee/tea. Basically no "ta" with your "cha". However, a good place to spend some peaceful time.

Located in an extremely attractive location. The interior is nice, if not great, with well behaving staff. The only thing which I disliked was the waiting time! I had to wait for 40-50 mins before I could satisfy my hunger!!! This needs to be improved.
Coming to the food . Thakurbarir patha mangsho stole the show. Satisfied my taste buds with its awesome taste and the mutton was properly cooked.. Sona moong dal was okayish!
Paneer kali mirch was horrible! The gravy was sweet,as opposed to what we were told by the waiter.
My only conclusion is that : If you ever come here,try just the bengali dishes!

I visited this place on January 24, 2016. So, apologies for writing so late. Anyway, I shall cut to the chase:

I did not take the boat ride, I took my car straight up to the 'ekanté' compound and crossed the bridge and I let my intuition guide me to the 'café'. There should be proper signage for people taking this route, I must say. The staff seemed disoriented and confused, what with the Sunday lunch crowd at 1.30 pm; I was told my wife and I would have to wait for 45 minutes. I popped in and found an empty table for two. On reporting this to the desk, we were let in promptly as we were the only couple waiting. Once inside, I liked the LOCATION, but NOT the general aura. The tables seemed to be too close together for (my) comfort. The view is unique, no doubt.
We ordered Fried Chicken Fillet with TI dressing which blew my mind. They were crisp and hot tasted fabulous with the dip. Next up was Luchi and Prawn Pulao with Kancha Lanka Diye Murgi. The Luchis were good but the Murgi was disappointing. The pieces were warm outside but cold inside, which I pointed out, and the dish was reheated for us. The Prawn Pulao was enjoyable, the prawns fresh and of mid-size, but almost half of them had not been properly deveined. Lastly, the only desert they had was Nole Gurer Ice Cream. I wanted to have Baked Rosogollas, but was out of luck.
Overall, the whole experience needs improvement. I did enjoy myself, but I could have enjoyed a lot more if the staff were a bit more efficient, friendly and if the food had been prepared with a little more care. I'll definitely visit again but will expect better memories.
My advice to the Café Ekanté Team - You can do a lot better, if you try just a little harder. Buck Up!

A very nice attempt to build up a restaurant in the middle of vast Ecopark and also providing convenience for enjoying a good bengali meal with lots of variety and innovations ...i managed to visit the place a couple of days back and satiate my hunger pangs ....we ordered a veg platter which was filled with herbs and flavours ...very impressive and some prawn pulao n ekante  special kosha mangsho for my non-vegetarian friends.... The prawn pulao was quite well though nothing extravagant but the mutton preparation was a total let down ...all it had was just bones without even little adherence of meat in it....very disappointed with this ....they should really be careful while serving the meat portions

Situated in the middle of the main lake inside eco park, the restaurant perhaps has the most attractive outside view in the town. Decor is extremely delicate. Although the combination of framed are less imaginative and has no co-relation. 

Coming to the food.. I must say a bit disappointed. Being a ghoti, I am used to sweeter tastes. But this restaurant has an extreme affinity to sugar. Almost everything we ordered was sweet in taste. The fish fry was nice. But the hilsa combo and the daab chingri was a bit disappointing. 
Having said that, to appreciate the effort of our state govt and enjoy the location, one must visit this place at least once!

The ambiance of this place is great,the boat ride they offer is good(provided ,you are able to show the bill). The area of the restaurant is small thus they can accommodate quite less amount of people,leading to long queues ,and in order to return via boat you have to get a bill.The small cafe at the jetty also serves food but that turns out to be a bit costly. the food inside the cafe was tasty but quite less in quantity.the best thing i liked there was the nalen gurer ice cream. the decor was impressive.
* if you are planing to have lunch then be ready to wait at the jetty from around 11 
* after i guess 4:30 pm they don't sever tandoor so if you want to order ,plz do ordr it at once

The place is nicely located and the surrounding is just mesmerising. With an entire view of eco park this restaurant provides you with an extraordinary experience. But the problem starts with the behavior of the staff, they are highly unorganized , rude with I don't care type attitude. Getting a table can really be a pain and you need to remind them again and again as they don't allot you by their register, they maintain it but whome they allow in is as per their discretion. We were 3 people and had to wait for 1.5 hours to get a table. The food is OK OK and nothing extraordinary so won't comment much on it but the behavior is really disgusting.

Huge waiting time even though the restaurant was empty. Then we had to ask them to provide us plates as they had forgotten to put the plates. 
Coming to the food, the sheekh kabab was bland. The bhetki paturi was little on the harder side. The moong dal was ordinary. The aloo bhaja was nice n crispy. The mutton curry was good but they gave us one piece of chicken in the mutton gravy. Can you imagine this from a so called fine dining restaurant?
Finally the nolen gurer ice cream saved the day for us as it was so yummy.one star for that

Its strange why this place's overall rating is above 3.5.....only thing good here is the ambience. Except that everything is bad. I gave it 2.5 only because of the ambience and free boat ride.

We visited here when we came in a get together in eco park. We ordered Basanti pulao,chingri pulao and Thakur barir pathar mangso . In pulao there was not any fragrance that comes naturally from Basanti pulao. Thakur barir pathar mangso too was very badly cooked.

Overall summary of foods:-
1) Quantity is less
2) Price is very high compared to foods.
3)All dishes were cooked badly and tasted bad.
4) Have to wait for a long time after ordering.

And one thing to mention that the quality of foods are great...they only need to change the chef.

One miniscule scoop of ice cream 170 rupees including tax... same "nolen gur" ice cream in delhi's saket mall is 90 rupees. It will burn holes in the pocket of middle class. Just a good ambience and good food and smiling waiters does not justify such rubbish price.... totally rubbish and bogus..i am totally pissed off, i am feeling cheated...
1 star just for the pricing..... so much greed is not good... one day the consequence will come dont worry...it cant continue for long..

Its worth visiting once only for the beauty of nature. But honestly the food is overpriced. We ordered two chicken starters of 6 pieces each and lemon sherbat (which was a cheat) and it costed up 640 bucks with tax. This same food I believe when is left over is used in One-hour boat ride costing Rs 300 per head. Chicken was stinking. Wont be visiting twice.

However the interiors are quite nice. View is superb in the evening.

every time i visit this place only one thing comes to my mind.... which one is better? NOLEN GURER ICE CREAM or the great ambience? the food is too good but a little on the expensive side. but the overall experience will make up  for that. the lush green surrounding, the clear azure, the open water body, and the lights (at night) will steal your heart. the cafe is situated in the eco island at eco park. the boat ride (free ride given by the cafe) is indeed pleasurable, but during peak hours the boat is overcrowded. during weekends and holidays the cafe gets crowded. minimum waiting time is 15-30 minutes. the island is well lit up with plenty of sitting arrangements and it even has a small tree house where you can stand and enjoy the view. the cafe is well decorated and their service is pretty decent. no matter how many times i go, i find it to be new every time. i have visited the place 5-6 times and i'm looking forward to visit it again and again :) 

PS: they have changed the lighting of the cafe. the previous lighting pattern which they had,i found it more attractive and unique.(the one with "jhuri"upside down). they have also introduced kababs. loved them. and i'm eagerly waiting for their outdoor sitting facility to open.looks too fascinating and alluring.

Visited this place yesterday with family. Boat ride from eco park and the overall ambience is excellent. Everyone enjoyed. Specially the cottages around the isalnd are well located. Ambience wise it deserve to get 4.5 rating. Inside the cafe again ambience is really good. Its like a big glass house, one can see the vast water body outside. Specially in night the view outside is spectacular. Now food is overpriced compare to any top class restaurant in kolkata. Quantity is pathetic..i'll give it not more than 3 rating. Now the biggest disappointment was quality of the food. Chicken was half cooked. Once you get the food you can understand its run by a semi govt body not fully private. Except 1 or 2 dishes all r waste of money. Staff behavior was good though. Now the horrible part was coming out of the restaurant at night. Main eco park was closed at 7.30pm and our car was parked in car parking area. So around 9.15pm when we landed from the cafe to main eco park security asked us to leave eco park from another gate to to main road and walk towards the car parking. Now this is very irritating and very risky at night walking on empty road with family members. Before this part i was thinking to give them atleast 3.5 rating but only due to this pathetic management i'll give them 2.5. I reconend to visit cafe only in the evening for snacks items mainly as food is not worthy spending money.

Well well well...waited for a long time to visit this place...!!! A boat ride to get to the restaurant and an amazing ambience in the middle of the lake are the only cherishable takeaways from this place. Visited this place on 10th jan. I ordered bhetki paturi,chingri pulao and doi mach. All the three dishes tasted below par compared to the bengali cuisine restros like sholo ana bangali,bhojohori manna,oh calcutta etc. The food is not worth the money...only the ambience is.

Though the location is very unique and so is the ambience. The food is a disgrace to bengoli cuisine. 

Being a non bengoli I can say I could cook better Hilsa fry and make better chicken curry than the cook. And imagine the price is way to expensive looking at the quantity and quality of food.

For eg. Imagine charging for a 2inch width one piece hilsha Rs.239+ taxes.

‘Cafe Ekante’ is relatively a new place & located in a fabulous surrounding.A quite & peaceful place away from the hustle & bustle of the city.
You definitely need a car or a bike to visit this place. The stretch between the car parking and cafe there is a bridge which you have to cross & it is an amazing walk (quiet and serene).Before you arrive at the cafe you will see cottages all around the lake & if you are planning for a weekend outing you must visit this place.

We started with “Sheek Kebab” & “Gondhoraj Lebur Sorbat” & it was OK.For Main course, we ordered all time favorite “Murg Butter Masala” & “Kali Mirch Ka Murga” with Roti & Naan, taste was good however the quantity was insufficient, mainly gravy was too less & unlike how we get at other places.

Since I visited Kolkata from Bangalore the price seemed very reasonable to me.All in all it is a good place to visit.ENJOY!!!!

If you are in Eco park and crave for a quiet sit down meal overlooking the serene lake then Cafe Ekante is your place! What makes this place unique from the rest is that it is located in the eco island hence, you have to take a ferry ride all the way to this eatery which enhances the gastronomic experience. The ferry service is free as it is provided by the Cafe Ekante management. 

The place exudes a minimalistic Bengali decor with prop like the traditional haat-pakhha dominating the design template. The place is quite small and does not entertain table reservation. Our menu comprised of coffee, prawn cutlet, Bengali fusion meal of Herbed rice, broccoli, cauliflower and potato curry, and chilled gondhhoraj serbet. The bengali fusion item remained the undisputed winner with the amalgamation of condiments and spices in the herbed rice adding an off beat taste and when melded with the daal and the vegetable curry it produced a quiet a pleasant taste. 
A bit disappointed with the gondhhoraj serbet though.

However, savouring a wholesome food overlooking the lake makes you forget the shortcomings.
Must visit for all 😊

Bad experience.. Dead Mosquitoes in the rice, priced premium, small portion of food, taste not bad rather OK. Ordered combo food but didn't serve a fish fry as mentioned in combo... Checked the menu pointed out that they have missed out something then they got the fish fry. No tissue paper on table... Had to call waiters and wait for their service for everything like water, finger bowl...LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST LONG WAITING PERIOD... Will not recommend this place...

‘Cafe Ekante’ is relatively a new place & located in a fabulous surrounding.A quite & peaceful place away from the hustle & bustle of the city.
You definitely need a car or a bike to visit this place. The stretch between the car parking and cafe there is a bridge which you have to cross & it is an amazing walk (quiet and serene).Before you arrive at the cafe you will see cottages all around the lake & if you are planning for a weekend outing you must visit this place.

We started with “Sheek Kebab” & “Gondhoraj Lebur Sorbat” & it was OK.For Main course, we ordered all time favorite “Murg Butter Masala” & “Kali Mirch Ka Murga” with Roti & Naan, taste was good however the quantity was insufficient, mainly gravy was too less & unlike how we get at other places.

Since I visited Kolkata from Bangalore the price seemed very reasonable to me.All in all it is a good place to visit.ENJOY!!!!

I visited this place during Durga puja. This place made me happy with the foods and more happy with the location and ambience.Staffs were hospitable. We ordered Trikon parota , Thakur barir kosha mangsho, Chicken Duckbunglow, chingri r polao, Paturi etc.. Food was good.. But the nolen gurer ice cream was just out of the world.. All well that ends well.. Single bite of it made my visit a golden gift.

If you are in Eco park and crave for a quiet sit down meal overlooking the serene lake then Cafe Ekante is your place! What makes this place unique from the rest is that it is located in the eco island hence, you have to take a ferry ride all the way to this eatery which enhances the gastronomic experience. The ferry service is free as it is provided by the Cafe Ekante management. 

The place exudes a minimalistic Bengali decor with prop like the traditional haat-pakhha dominating the design template. The place is quite small and does not entertain table reservation.

Worth mentioning the location of the restaurant, surrounded by water body, even u can enjoy the view of the same from inside while having food.. Reach there by free boat service or by car from back side of eco Park,  both r unique, walking through wooden bridge (back side) is quite interesting,  but but but... the taste & preparation is far below compare to any bengali restaurant, not at all authentic. It's only good for a cup of tea or coffee while enjoying the view of water body.. Very very disappointing as per the menu description & taste,  also priced on higher side...

the zomato reviews couldn't have been more fair about this place.Cafe ekante is a place to savor the ambiance,the food not so much.Their free ferry service is a very novel experience,and eating on a small island is a novelty in itself.ekante has tried to fuse bengali traditional food with world cuisine,and the main items maybe a success,but the starters aren't.consulting the waiter,most starters sounded like regular chop-cutlet with "kashundi".we still ordered prawn cutlet,which didn't maintain any deceiving appearances,and along with it,citrus lassi,gondhoraj lebur shorbot and nolen gurer icecream.the cutlet and lebur shorbat were just as expected,but the lassi and icecream were superb.It was 4 when we were done,and the ferry took very long to return from the ecopark mainland.Also,it's better to carry the restaurant bill with you till the ferry,where they sometimes check it before carrying you ashore.A gatepass,if you will.

I visited this place 3,4 times .... Location of this place is the main usp ...... The ambience is also very decent ..... They serve bengali cousin with a little western twist but somehow i don't find any unique thing in their food , presentation and taste as well .... In the menu it sounds interesting & different but in reality it is not  ..... Price is in the higher side according to quality & quantity .... As example daab chingri costs 450+tax .... But seriously they served 4 very small badly smelled prawn ....so if u r going out for a day r visiting echo park specially then for once u can try this place out but for food lover and regular visitors i don't think this is good option.....

Wow an experience to cherish. It was a Sunday morning and we were in the quest of deciding how to make the day special. Came accross this wonderful little gem on zomato and got our car running for the destination. We entered from gate no. one parked our car and the first glancé of the huze stretch of water and lush greens all around mesmerised us. The walk to the restaurant through the bridge with water around was simply intoxicating. We odered for fishfry ,prawn cutlets & gondhoraj lebur sarbat which were simply great but the only feedback here could be the size of the prawn in prawn cutlet. The fish was fresh which charmed every bite of the  fry. In main course we ordered for rice, aloo bhaja, bhaja sonamuger dal, morog polao, mutton kosha,  chicken dukbangla. From morog polao expectation was more otherwise food was good. But the little surprise came when we ordered nalengurer icecream. Once we finished one each our already filled stomach asked for a repeat. We controlled ourselves and we came out for a walk outside which was again an experience to remember. It was a pinch in the pocket with so much of added tax along with the bill. A small feedback to make the place more affordable to people would definitely help.

The management is pathetic. No communication between the staff. They made us wait for half an hour to give us a table and then when they invited us to the table they sent us back as some other attendant gave the table to some other customers. Never expected such bad service. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

The best thing about this place is its location. It is located on an island inside Ecopark, Rajarhat. Once you are inside this café, their glass walls give you a feeling of sitting in the middle of a waterbody.

Okay, now coming to their food and its quality. We ordered 3 cups of coffee, 1 cup of tea and 1 Chilled Gondhoraj Lebur Sorbat in drinks. Coffee and tea were good but Chilled Gondhoraj Lebur Sorbat was below average. We did not get the aroma of Gondhoraj lebu in the Sorbat. 

Then in the snacks, we ordered 2 plates of each “Fillet of bhetki marinated with French mustard and crumb fried” and “Steamed bhetki served with pickled chilli and herbed cheese.”.  Yes the name sounds bit weird and different but the first one is nothing but fish fry served with onion salad and mustard sauce whereas the second one is bhetki paturi with pickle and cheese added on top. Out of these two, fish fry was better as it tasted awesome and was cooked proportionately. Only bhetki paturi would have been better as with cheese and pickle it did not go well. We also ordered one plate of “Baby potato Tossed with cumin and tomato salsa”. This is nothing but potato balls served with jhuri-jhuri alu bhaja. This also tastes good.

All these 10 dishes including the drinks cost us Rs.1542 so if you consider the price it is bit on the higher side.

Their hospitality is worth mentioning as the waiter came and asked for the feedback personally after we were done with the food.

The interior was good but could have been better had the walls being painted with some theme instead of using few wall hangings like hookahs, old Bengali movie poster frames etc.

The location is breath-taking and the marks is purely based on that! 'coz food-wise this place would have been average. Also without a car this cafe is a little bit inconvenient. But as a goodwill gesture they have started a boat service to ferry people from eco-park provided they will be dining at this cafe!

Now, coming to the food we had Prawn Cutlet, Fish Fry, Duckbunglow and Trikon Paratha and a pitcher of Pepsi. I wish the paratha were a little more softer. Staffs were courteous enough. This one is a must visit, you will remember the experience.

An awesome picturesque view... in the middle of a lake...  it is in an island where we reached by boat. for those who want to eat in the restaurant, the ferry service is free of cost.

★ LOCATION : (2/5) It is located in ECO PARK rajarhat.

★ AMBIANCE :(4/5)  visit is worthy coz it is just an island. water in evry side. too romantic place.

the decoration inside cafe is also nice. with some guitar, hookah, old pictures,and furnitures of cane gave the feel of bangaliana.

★ FOOD :(2.5/5) : we ordered 2 gondhoraj lebur sorbot, 2 betki fish fry, 1 nolen gur er ice cream. sorbot was normaly tasted like home made lebur sorbot. fish fry is very thin fillet of fish with mustard sauce marination. tasted OK but my dad makes better fish fry at home :(  the nolen gurer ice cream was nice, but in bhojohori manna the taste is better and also the quantity.

★ PRICES :(2/5)  The prices are high. the items here are too much over priced.  total cost was 715. 
★ SERVICE : (2.5/5) waiters are friendly. 

one thing i noticed...i found a cooked fish smell as soon as i entered.. and it lingered all the time, which i didnt like at all. they shud use some air freshener.

overall its worth a one time visit for all who love nature.

Away from city's hustle bustle, a peaceful place to enjoy Bengali cuisine. The food is good, but is not something extraordinary. The man made beauty of the place will add an extra flavor to your cuisine, as you enjoy eating your food, facing the lake.

Well this is the unique cafe, coz it serves multicuisine dishes and not just coffee. It should be renamed as Ekante Restaurant or something. The unique thing abiur this place is its location, middle of a lake. The food taste and quality is managable but quantity served in the price being charged is unappropriate. Service is good and ambience is good which leaves you with overall good experience.

It was my first visit to Café Ekante with my partner 4 cuisine! Given the look of an island, ambiance is something to crave for.  
They are offering free boat ride to reach there. 

Got to have 

1 - Gondhoraaj lebur sherbet - Which was very good & refreshing. 

2- Dumpling of poppy seed & coconut – Could hav been better
3 - Bekti Fillet Marinated in Mustard Sauce wrapped in Burnt Leaf- the Betki was superb. 
A must try.
4 - Crunchy Chicken Fillet Serve with Thousand Island dressing- Average. 

We had to finish off our plates widout a dip. All fyn a bit overpriced thou. Cordially managed. Looking frwrd to a 2nd visit soon.

This restaurant deserves a 5 for the ambiance.
Located on the artificial island in middle of eco park, this offers an unparalleled view of the park. More thrilling is the boat ride you have to take to reach the place.
The ambience inside the cafe matches the surroundings. With jamini ray paintings & giant palm-leaf fans the place sets the right mood for a authentic Bengali eatery.
However I think they overdid it by including miss bannerjee's pic along with the legends.

Coming to the food, we ordered Prawn Cutlet,Fillet of Bekti marinated with French Mustard & Crumb fried, Crunchy chicken fillet served with thousand island dressing & Darjeeling tea.
The prawn cutlet was average to good, no complaint there.
The second item is just fish fry & nothing else. Although the fish seemed fresh & juicy, nothing was extraordinary to name it in such a way!
The third item was CHICKEN NUGGETS! why would one name it in such a misleading way? Name deceiving, taste so so.
The Darjeeling tea was a disappointment as well. Had better tea at other places.
Not only the the food average & overpriced, the service was disappointing as well.
After we were seated  they didn't serve any water.
They didn't serve kasundi with the fries. We had to ask for it.
Also they took very long to serve the tea, we actually had to remind them twice.
They have a very nice packaging in eco friendly paper bags for take-aways.

So basically you can visit the place for the ambiance, stroll around the restaurant, but don't have very high expectations from the food.

To escape from the Durga Puja crowd we planned to visit Eco Park. After reaching this place we were really surprised by the calmness and serenity. Its so picturesque and beautiful that for a moment I got lost in a trance whether is this really Kolkata. This place has both accommodation & dining facilities along with boating facilities in their infinite lake
. In food we started with Dumpling of Poppy Seed & Coconut (Posto Vada) 4 pieces which was okay, Topsey Batter Fried 4 pieces which was crunchy and Prawn Cutlet 2 pieces which was good. Followed by Bekti Fillet Marinated in Mustard Sauce Wrapped in Burnt Leaf (Pathuri Wrapped in Banana Leaf) which tasted okay but the fish was not soft as it should be. Then came Basonti Pulao which is light and good. With that we had Doi Rui which was okay. In drinks we had Coca Cola, Fresh Lime Juice and Lassi. Monetary wise it is slightly heavy on your pockets. But I suggest if not for the food at least for the sheer beauty of the place it's worth a visit.

visited this place with friends. this place has a great ambience - situated in the middle of the lake with a generous view of the water body. the interior is nicely decorated too. coming to the food - we tried crumb fried bhetki, shrimp stuffed pomfret and prawn cutlet for starters. the pomfret was quite interesting and nicely done. the other two items were good but nothing extra ordinary. in main course we went for the shrimp stuffed bhetki platter which was really good.  the servers were helpful and efficient. the only complain i have for this place is its pretty expensive for the food it serves - the premium to be paid for the ambience is a bit high to justify the 'taste per rupee' factor.
note- the adjacent parking area has a flat 50 inr fee.

We went just to have a different experience. We had just a Darjeeling tea and Soft Drinks. Tea was not up to the mark I'll say, and of course, compared to the quality, over-priced! But the free boat ride along with the ambience turned it to a perfect romantic evening! 
PS: They should arrange something outside the closed restaurant! With a so nice water body beside, they should use the place to attract more people by letting them have their food beside the lake. Who wants to miss such a dining place!

If you want to lose yourself from the chaos of the city without a weekend getaway, this is the place to be.Located in the island amidst the lake in Eco Park, Rajarhat, do drop by if you need your share of the calm this place has to offer.

You can take a free boat ride to this cafe (keep the receipt) or drive in and then walk over a bridge from the other side of the park. The ratings entirely for the location and the ambience, only note-worthy food being the amazing fish fries. they serve a variety of snacks and some options of beverages, but judging by the ambience they would be mere formalities. My advice, don't fall for the enticing fusion menu, stick to the basics and the food is good enough. Had an amazing bhetki fillet fish fry, kind of huge too for the price, unlike the kind you will find in the city. Did not try the main course, but judging by the food, shouldnt be a problem.Slightly pricey, for the quality offered.
Great place for a good hearty adda session with friends and family,over a bunch of snacks and tea/coffee, the ambience scoring over the food. do drop by for an enchanting evening experience.

It was an unplanned visit to Cafe Ekante last week during Puja days. I have gone to Eco Park with my family guests from Delhi on a picnic. Later in the evening when we were planning for the dinner we decided to give a try to Cafe Ekante. Instead of food the main reason was to see the beautiful island. We were not having much expectation with the food as we all were vegetarians and Cafe Ekante is famous for Non-Ven Bengali food.

We reached Cafe Ekante in a complimentary boat ride from the park. Due to Durga Puja celebrations island was decorated beautifully with lot of lights. For around 30 minutes we roamed on the island and it was very good experience.

Now coming to food, we were helped by Master Chef in selecting the veg items. We ordered Jhur Jhurey Aloo Bhaja, Narkol Diye Choler Dal, Makhmali Panner, Aloo Dum and Parathas. We ordered very little quantity in the beginning as we were not sure about the taste. But we were surprised by the delicious food and repeated the items 2-3 times.

We enjoyed both the food and ambiance a lot in Cafe Ekante. It is very different experience and best location for special occasions.

My middling rating is because I had an average experience with the food here. The ambience of course is better than ordinary...
Here's what I thought:
1. Great locale (a view of the water body and the new cityscape - romantic huh?)
2. Good 'bong' food - not authentic or innovative, nevertheless enjoyable!
3. Will not burn a hole in your pocket (dining includes free to and fro boat ride, 2 free movie tickets against a bill above 1000 blah blah...cost is around 400 per person).
4. Service is quick, decor is nice!
5. Quantity is modest (25% increase will create great value for money...lol)
Overall a nice place, away from the madding crowd!

This cafe is located in Eco Park but is not amongst the general chaos of Eco Park. It is located on the other side of the lake and there is a boar service which takes you and brings you back from the other side of the cafe. The overall experience is quite good as I found it little different from the other cafes.
Coming to the food, I don't like the food that much although we did not order much. We ordered fish fry from starters, platter in the main course and gandhoraj lebu sharbat. All the preparation were pretty normal considering the price point.
One point of caution - keep the bill of else they don't give you a ride back in the boat.

The café is situated on the other side of the Eco Park, called Eco Island. They primarily serve Bengali cuisine with some special fusion options. We tried rice, dal, aloo bhaja, Mochar ghanto, Daab Chingri and Kacha Lanka Murgi. The food was mildly spiced, and had a distinct West Bengal flavor unlike most Bengali restaurants in town. Overall staffs are friendly, warm and trained. Food though little expensive.

Guys you have to increase the portion size ..you need to have oh Calcutta as your bench mark. Will be difficult to get repeat footfalls if food lovers don't get satiated at the table... the ambience may not be sufficient enough ... 3 for food and 5 for ambience

It was the time when Puja had not set in properly in Kolkata. We had planned a day out with my friends at Eco Park. While roaming around, we got up in a boat with seating arrangements and came to know that this sails down at the centre of the water body where the Ekante cottages are located. Those who are non residents can come over and they have to eat something. So we decided to go. The journey was wonderful. The garden with chairs is a really nice place to sip in coffee, but they said that they serve food only inside. Hence we sat down there. We ordered Gandharaj Lebu'r Sharbat, Citrous Lassi and a Cappuccino. The sherbet was good, the lassi was okay. So was the coffee. It's a little bit pricey compared to its quality and taste. Three sherbet, one lassi and a coffee costed us 390 bucks. Taste wasn't great. Still brownie points for the ambience, decor and the concept of travelling by a boat to reach the cafe. You can visit once for such an unique experience. Happy Dining! :)

You definitely need a car or a bike to visit this place.... going to eco park wont be that difficult but from park to cafe its a long distance...so walking would be a bit tiring...
Between car parking and cafe there is a bridge which you have to cross... its just an amazing walk...so quiet and serene...you can spend your time there itself...
Before the cafe you will see some cottages... if you are planning for a weekend outing you must visit this...
We did not order much stuffs since we had only come for snacks... to begin with, I ordered masala tea...had come directly after taking a long nap...so tea was very important... it was very very good... Next we had prawn bhaja, chicken fries (exactly dont remember the names from menu card)...complete bengali touch...do have it with chillie sauce.... For mains I took prawn stuffed promfet fish...it is a much try...something unique and absolutely amazing.... the value for money is quite standard.. you wont find it very expensive... this place is worth visiting atleast once

If you want a leisure drive followed with bengali food with a picturesque backdrop then this food joint is a must visit place.
Situated in the midst of the lake,one can easily take a boat ride from ecopark to avail the cafe,or if you have personal car you can drive till the cafe.let's come to the food.
I had ghol in bengali style,chingri cutlet,basanti polau,chicken duckbanglow & mutton platter.taste needs to be uplifted.duckbanglow should contain a piece of egg. Foods were full of keora jol which should be used less in quantity.ghol should be in a sufficient quantity.

Had a lot more expectations from this place but Café Ekante turned me down completely. I will give 5 out of 5 for its ambience but will rate 1 out of 5 for the quality of the food. We ordered 1 cup of cappuccino 1 coke and 1 plate of chicken wings which contains 6 pcs of wings. I found out one Hair in one of these pieces which was really disgusting. Although when I complained about that they changed the plate completely without any arguments but this type of quality of the food is absolutely not expected from this type of places. I will suggest please visit this place just for the wonderful ambience and just have a cup of tea or coffee.

Lovely pace, great location, situated middle of a lake.
Very nice place to spend good time.

Pros-

Great quality Bengali food items.
Warm behaviour from management.
Nice concept of Bengali platter named as fusion in their menu.
Taste is awesome which ever items we placed.

Cons-
Price is on the higher side.
Please change the utensils, design is not impressive. Almost all the glasses, plates already broken at their edge.

Food ordered-
Vetki paturi ( they named it in a very fancy way ), rice, mug dal, potoler dolma, chicken kasundi, nolen gurer icecream.

Every item was very delicious. No place to find any improvement area.

Overall -
A must visit for bengali food lovers.

Location - one of the best.
Cafe Ekante - one of the worst.
As evident, the location is simply amazing. Very enjoyable on a breezy evening. The entire Eco Park crowd is left behind and you 'sail' to the island. Boat ride is free but you need have at least tea at the cafe. The cafe is moderately sized. Ironically you will see Mamata Banerjee's pic amongst other Bengal legends. Anyways, you can wait at the cafe waiting area or head to the porch outside. The porch is amazing. The open stretch of water infront. A fine breeze. Open sky. Ofcourse this is dependent on weather. Visited with my wife

You will feel you are out of Kolkata when you will visit this place. You need to cross a little bridge . Their tiny cottages around surrounded by water body. Words cannot describe its environment. 
But food seriously needs to be improved with more menus being added into! Its not value for money.

Eco Park the sought after destination in City of Joy now brings to all gastronomists of Bengali cuisine Café Ekanté at Eco Island. Maybe one of its kind, at least first in Kolkata a restaurant on an island. The surrounding and view truly depicts solitude. Panorama of a hundred acre huge lake, green virgin island while tasting a fine selection of the best cuisine of Bengal. If you coming by car then can drive through gate no.1 to reach parking zone at the entrance of the island. Flat parking fee of INR 50 irrespective of how many hours you are halting. If not travelling by car then can take ferry ride to island from inside Eco Park.

Lucky to get a corner table during peak hour evening snacking time. Please be prepared for waiting at plush lounge section due to its popularity. We picked up our two most favourite snacking option from the menu Prawn Cutlet and Fish Fry.

Prawn Cutlet comes in 2 pieces, stuffed with one or two prawns with shell. The shell further spoiled the taste of the cutlet and filling was not cooked properly. 
Fish Fry one medium thin sliced bhetki fillet coated with bread crumb and claimed to be marinated with fresh mustard. Taste was average but fish was fresh. Both of these dishes at Koshe Kosha or Oh! Calcutta are miles ahead with taste and quality.

Price was too expensive costed us INR 388 inclusive all just for 2 starters considering it a government establishment. They only charge you service tax. Cards are accepted here too. Servers are extremely polite and decent, fluent in English. 

To enjoy the view best to go during monsoon day time to enjoy the 360 degree canvas through glass walls. Its a romantic corner, melting pot and one of the talked about happening place in city. I raise my toast to the brains behind this unique international concept. The taste and quality of food is something to be reviewed. Brownie points for ambiance, concept, decor and service.

Go to it solely for the view. The place is located on an island in the middle of a lake. A free boat service takes people too and fro. Beautiful ambiance. Enjoy gorgeous views of eco park. Staff very cordial. Food is average. But the view is truly a view to die for. 5 on 5 only for the view. The best view of eco park. Note: Their are only a hand full of tables. So best visited on weekday's.

Cafe Ekante !
A straight drive from gate no. 1 , the guards will guide you too.
In case , you don't have a car, you can get a shikara from eco park to reach.

Coming to the point -
Food - 3/5
Ambience - 5/5

Makes your mind and soul peaceful.
Ekante cottages and perfect for holidaying in Kolkata.
Or I'll tell you in WB ,  better than any sea beach !

Coming to the food -
We went at evening so grabbed some really light meal.

We ordered :-
1 - Gondhoraaj lebur shorbot - Which was totally plane lime juice just a bit scented. I'll prefer coke over it.
2- Chicken wings in tangy sauce - The chicken was smelly probably not fresh, i complained so they changed that immediately, and the fresh plate was amazing. Totally crispy and tangy.
3 - Narkol diye cholar daal and loochi - It was nothing extraordinary, yet you can have if your mother doesn't cook it at home haha !

Ps - Perfect for dinner dates and family outings with the best ambience in town.

Unfortunately the menu over here is obsolete, so we had a mini heart attack when we saw the elevation in price. (Afterall, we were all students and pocket pinch did matter) Anyways,I've uploaded the new menu. Most of the names are 'sholoana bangaliyana'. Overall nice place, good ambience, the island has a mesmerizing beauty. We had ordered tangy cottage cheese rolled in whole wheat pancake and crispy baby corn & noodles tossed in tangy sauce.

I've been there in an Evening soon after watching Cafe Ekante launch on some Bengali News Channel.. 
Small cosy restaurant But Ambiance outside it is just beautiful...  We ordered -
1. Fish Chop [ 4/5 ] - 2pcs of fish chop good size.. Tasted well with Rai (Mustard Sauce)
2. Moglai Paratha [ 3/5 ] - moglai was bit average , not that crispy. filling inside was just Masala n few pcs of peanuts. No chicken or mutton Kima feeling..
3. Coffee - [ 4/5 ]

On 4th Nov 2015 we visited Cafe Ekante for some snacks but we found they have changed and introduced new menu which consist more of Main than Eve Snacks.. So we ordered a  Achari Fish Paturi with a pc of cheese on top.. [4/5] and coffee.. We ordered Nolen Gur Ice cream( there specialty) but it was not available..

13th Dec 2015, Sunday  afternoon me and my family visited Ekante once again, But there's huge rush when we managed to got a table it was almost 3:45pm..  We all wr so hungry,we hurriedly ordered Topse Fry (4/5), Prawn Polao (3.5/5), Ekante Spl Mutton (3/5),Luchi, Cholar dal and Niramish Aloor Dam in white greavy( 5/5) (splly ordered for Veg Member with us.) Aloor Dam was excellent white creamy cheesy greavy... Rest of the foods were good but price they r now charging are bit higher as compare to its taste n quality..  We also asked for Nolen Gur Ice cream ,but it was unavailable again..

I heard about this place many time and finally I decided to visit there today, this place is located on the middle of the Eco Park. 
They are offering free boat ride to reach there.
This Place is very good, waiters Are very well behaved and polite. We took 2 cup of Cappuccino and 1 plate of Chicken Fillet Fry.
Which cost 411 in total amount. Quality is fine but quantity need some improvement. Overall nice and will try some otherdish in future.

Honestly i never heard of this place but my friends surprised me with thus unique place at kolkata.  Its a hidden gem in d  city for bongs. It a bengali restaurant where u cn get all kind of bengali food n snacks coffee. Bout this place it has best environment for a romantic dinr Or for any occasion . Its just mindblowing place . Price very less affordable for evry 1. I visited this place today it self. Around 4.30pm  For snacking . 
Comes to food orderd mustered steam fish with pickle  and vetki fry . And 2 coffee.  Taste was good but they use a lots of muster in fish which made its taste lil odd. Over all its ok . Best thing of this restaurant is its location, environment, its nature, its beauty.  Food quality needed to improve more thn m sure lots of ppl will cum n enjoy a lot with its beauty

Heard a lot about this place so finally paid a visit. That was indeed a heavenly experience. 
Talking about how to reach the cafe, there are two options. You can go through eco park. You have to take a boat which will make you cross the lake and reach the cafe. Or if you have car, you can take the Gate No. 1 entrance of eco park and drive directly to the eco island.
Now you walk through the bridge passing by the eco cottages to Cafe Ekante.
Talking about the experience till now, is purely heavenly. Mark my word, this will make your perfect date. ;)
Ambience of the cafe is very nice. The location being on lake side, make your experience totally out of the world. The total bengali decorations, and the old school bengali songs playing in the background adds flavour to your experience. 
Foods served here are authentic bengali. And totally fresh. Tastes great. You can walk around the lake side balcony or in the garden with your coffee or chai and enjoy the time. 
Cafe Ekante is an awesome concept. It gives you privacy, luxary and quality time to be spent with your loved ones and family. This place is perfect for dates or a family get together. Total thumbs up.

Few Suggestions to the management. the cafe should serve some continental items too. Atleast a sandwich.

I have only heard very highly of this place, located inside the eco-park. So one fine day I decided to drop in for dinner and experience the beauty of this place. We had a car so there was no point to take the jetty to reach this island . One can drop the jetty idea if you want to take a walking tour of this place. It is an absolute delight and mesmerizing. Once you start walking down the bridge to reach the place esp.in the evening , you are surrounded by water and its beauty is heightened by the additions of lights and little cottages inside the area. You can book these cottages even for 4500/- . So to all those lovely couples who want to celebrate their anniversary, bday or just celebrate your love story you could book a place here for a romantic gateaway. 

Now coming to the café- well its not a typical café but more of a restaurant. The ambiance inside and outside both are really nice, serene and traditional Bengali.  One side of the restaurant overlooks the river and they have really cute little sitting arrangements outside.  The staffs are courteous but I thought they did not have much idea about their newly added fusion dishes. But overall ok.

Food wise I have to say I am highly disappointed. I am Bengali and most of their dishes are those we get in our own kitchens so there was absolutely no innovation or creation nor did they taste very delightful. If I am craving Bengali dish I think I will blindly head for 6 Ballygunge Place any given day.

We ordered “daabchingri” which was awfully sweet. The chef has no idea of its real taste. My cook cooks better I felt. Then we went for ‘koshamangsho and luchis” which was nice. The gravy of the muttons was yum but so little that we had to eat very miserly with the luchis. I know kosha means less gravy but when you have luchis you would prefer a bit more than what was provided. Lastly we ordered the  “Kachalankadiye Chicken”. Honestly I ordered it thinking it will be super hot and yum but good lord it was bland and I don’t know where they got the chillies because it had no spice. We ate because we ordered it and dint want to waste. My boyfriend is a hard core chicken lover and even he did not want to eat this item. I have never had such bad Bengali chicken item in any bong outlets. So a big shout out to the Ekante Chef- kindly reconsider your recipe.  Lastly we went for mishit doi and nolengurer ice cream and they both rocked so our end was definitely on a sweet note.

Over all superb ambiance of the whole set up but food was a let down. However prices are super pocket friendly. Usually with a set up like this you expect a hole in the pocket but it wasn’t the case here. However the place closes at 9pm, typical café like timing but if you are offering dinner you need to hike the time.

I am adding their new fusion menu for those who want to taste something different.

I thought of the movie Enter the Dragon, the scene where Bruce Lee sets out on the boat to the island to fight - when I was on boat from the exclusive jetty. It was just too goo, the ride, the waves, the scenes all around. And the soft landing on to the lush green island and then to a spotless glass air conditioned Old Kolkata ambiance, with Jamini Roy paintings, Sepia Photos, sital pati table cloth and a large hookah.
An out of the world experience.
And the food - starting from Potoler Dolma to Nalen Gurer Ice Cream : was just amazing.

10 on 10 for the ambience and décor. This has to be one of the best sites for dating with open air and a lake around. I wasn't aware if this till a couple of moths back when I bumped into it after some of my friends suggested a visit for a get together.

The services is quite decent and so is the menu items. This place is best enjoyed in monsoons which makes this beautiful place more charming.

=========================================================================================================

It was a nice breezy summer evening, me and my friend decided to go on a bike ride and also have some food...I said lets go to the newly opened Cafe Ekante in rajarhat Eco Park. I had read about this cafe in newspapers and it looked interesting. So we were on our way and reached Eco Park by 5.30 pm and being a Sunday there was less traffic and was feeling nice to ride on empty stretches of newtown. I Had read  one needs to enter ecopark and take a boat ride till the island where the cafe is situated...we did the same....entered eco park took a long walk clicking pics till the boat jetty only to be told that the boat service is temporarily unavailable it will start after two hours. The person at the jetty said if have your own vehicle then no need to worry just leave to parking lot and take the lane which runs beside the lake and you will reach the cafe. So we took our bike and followed the instructions and where the tarmac road ends there is a very small parking lot with a guard sitting. After seeing the view me and my friend looked at each other and said thank god the boat service was stopped and we landed at such a beautiful picturesque location. There is a long jetty type structure which starts from the parking lot and runs across the lake till the island. The sun was setting, the light was perfect and i wish i had a DSLR. It was extremely romantic place and perfect for a date :)

After clicking loads of pictures and selfies we landed on the island it was kind of deserted but well lit. We walked towards the cafe and had to wait for 10 mins as all the tables were occupied. After a while we were given a nice table near the large glass windows overlooking the lake. And now it was time for the main business Food.

We ordered Amer Chop, Narkol Diye Cholar Daal with Loochi, Moghlaai Parotha and two cold drinks.

The food arrived very quickly... first tasted the Amer chop...it was basically an aloo chop with slices of kachaa aam mixed with the filling. I liked the concept but it was too sour due to the aam...if they can reduce the sourness slightly then it will be perfect. Narkol Diye Chola daal was very simple with less spices and the daal pieces were slightly mashed...i like the opposite with more garam masala and intact daal pieces, still it was light & nice...the loochi was average. I was informed that moghlaai parotha is only served till 7 Pm and it was already 7.30 still the staff said he will try and get one for me and he was back in 5 mins with a plate of moghlaai parotha with a smile :) It was very hot served with potatoes and little salad. Now you cant compare this moghlai parotha with the ones you get in you locality at paaraar fastfood corner but it was still nice and light but i feel there should have been more stuffing inside it. By this time i was almost full and it was 8.30 pm time to leave.

The total bill was Rs 327/-

yes the prices are bit on the higher side but im okay with it.

The service is nice and warm, the staffs are helpful and courteous and serve you with a smile.

Overall a sunday evening well spent....Im visiting this place again.

What followed was a nice easy breezy ride back home :)
