Loved the food... Authentic... Call from swiggy... That burn feeling you get after having sambar is not there in their food... Their masala uttapam is a must try without fail... The idlis are big and soft at the same time... Have ordered many times already...

Ordered in via Swiggy.Had their Pav Bhaji. There were two pieces in a plate. The pavs were okay,but the bhaji was oily and a little bit spicy.

Very very tasty food. I have ordered mini idli and Vada. Idli is very very soft and the taste is superb. I love the taste of the chutney. And the quantity is also very good. In a nutshell, very good food at very reasonable rate.

I ordered home delivery from this outlet. Very good food. Very tasty. Also very cheap and well packed. The food was homely, not very spicy. Reasonable price.

The size of idly is quite big. The quality of chatney and sambhar is super. And for all Jain people the sambhar is Jain. I would  strongly recommend .

Good south Indian food at pocket friendly prices. Service is reasonably quick. Location excellent. My kids are very fussy about idly but they really liked the idly from here. A good find for us.
