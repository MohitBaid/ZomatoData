One of the oldest place in the area... Serving some decent pocket friendly fast foods... That's it...  Staffs are rude and disrespectful... The place is shabby and unhygienic... We tried their mutton tikka roll... It tasted good... Although they are using vanaspati for cooking... making the whole thing pretty unhealthy...

Visited this small restaurant very often during my college days with my friends. We mainly tasted their rolls but never tasted other things. They didn't allow to sit inside if you are ordering a roll. We tried their chicken tikia rolls for several times. It was quite easy on pocket. Nothing great about the taste and quality.

A quaint and kind of shabby looking place on the very busy Hazra crossing,  very close to Jatin Das Park Metro station,  this eatery is in 2 parts,  a place with seating facility and the take away counter.  

The funny thing about this place is that they don't allow you to sit inside and have a roll,  so you can't order one even if you want to if  you are sitting inside. 
They say its because there are two different owners but sadly to us customers,  we are there at a place which shares the same name so its a bit difficult to see logic. 

The food is good,  they have a variety of rolls on offer.  Was pleased to see tikka roll and fish roll a part of the menu.  But could only taste the Egg tikka and the Egg chicken as the fish roll would be taking some time to be served and I was in a hurry.  

All in all a good place if you are looking for budget and I mean a shoestring budget chinese restaurant.  The rolls are ok ok.  Nothing to boast about.  Good for on the go meals.
