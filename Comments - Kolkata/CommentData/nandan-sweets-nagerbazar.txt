Biggest surprise when I found this shop in Zomato. A very famous local shop of my area selling sweets for a decade now.

Located at near the dum dum park post office area.
They make fresh sweets and very tasty indeed. Also you get kachori and cholar dal as breakfast here which is purely blissful in taste. They make one of those best samosa rather to say bangali singara. Do try it.. Cheers
