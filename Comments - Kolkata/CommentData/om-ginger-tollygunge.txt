Ordered through Swiggy and moreover this is only a takeaway / delivery outlet so will only talk about food..
Chicken Pakora
Veg Pakora
--- The coating was thick but overall it was okay.
Fish Fry - This was also okay. Nothing to highlight exclusively
Fish Finger - This was best of the lot with perfectly cooked fish fillet and the coating.
