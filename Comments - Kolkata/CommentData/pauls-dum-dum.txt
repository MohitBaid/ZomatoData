Had food (biriyani on one occasion and mughlai paratha on another occasion) here during the pujas. The food here is nothing to brag about. Just average without much pocket pinch.

Had food only once and found very awful. Chicken fingers were very hard. God knows how many days old it was. Rolls are also equally bad. Had taken liver curry from there a few pieces and exorbitantly priced. Tests pretty bad as well.

Their food is very low on quality. You might even find something not cooked well. Ingredients don't seem to be fresh. Being located at such a prime location, they could be so much more better. I have tried their chicken lollypopsfish fries and rolls but nothing impressed me!

I travel a lot through nagerbazar and hence had tried this food joint which is very near the bazaar at nagerbazar.The food was just pathetic. I had the spring roll and it had hardly any filling and the taste was so bad. I had also taken the chap , which again turned out to be really bad, and not at all chap like.Never trying again.

It's situated just opposite the goruhata more. The food is just bad. I had taken away the chicken chap once, it was pathetic. Had eaten the chicken lollypop and it was full of beans and there was hardly any chicken. Won't ever try again.

I had tried their chicken lollypop and fish fry. The lollypop had too much besan  and very less chicken and the fish fry also had a very thick crust compared to the fish. I understand at that price i shouldn't be expecting much, but too thick a crust makes it taste worser. They are mainly dependent on take aways . And they have a display counter in front which i believe does more damage than good as the food looked stale and not at all worth a try.

Food is really bad. Less stuffing more besan on the food. Cheap food but at times there are conditions of ordering min two..then it kind of pinches..given the food..easy to find though..

Finally! A place with a Indian surname! :D
'Paul' or ''Paul's" is suave and crispy with a good faÃ§ade and fast service. Being a place just on the roadside I expected some kind of sitting arrangement but alas! All I had was the comfort of plastic chair's on the footpath that to admist the hustle and bustle of commuters!
One word. Light. Food.
If you want to take a break from the traditional style of greasy as well as deep fried rolls ( which goes the same for Biryani) you won't be disappointed. The 'paratha' here is not-so-oily. Chicken tikkas are small but ample. The packaging is extremely good.
It's clean (which I think is scarcely found in a roadside place!) fair prices. Fast service.
Bon appetite seÃ±or & seÃ±orita! :D

Small place on DumDum road just next to Goruhata more and opposite Arenguho road, this place is not hard to find and also to ignore i suppose. Ordered a Mughlai Paratha as i didn't have it for a long time and i still regret it. They gave badaam in it and in such huge quantities. It sucked. No dining area, roadside and you can see the kitchen, it doesn't give you good vibes. 

So if you can, please avoid.

Absolutely pathetic food. Excessive oily and tasteless. Doesn't know anything about cuisines. Only a few items like fish fry, egg devil and chicken lollypop ar ok and eatable. Also the chicken tikka and reshmi kebabs are of moderate quality.
