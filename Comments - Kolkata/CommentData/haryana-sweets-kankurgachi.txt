The club kachori with the aloo sabzi served here is just mouth-watering. And if you have hot jalebi then it acts as an icing on the cake!!! The gulab jamun and samossa is also a must try!

Visited this outlet after going through some good reviews & recommendation in Zomato . It's a small outlet near Kankurgachi Pantaloons . If one approaches Phoolbagan from Kankurgachi Island the shop will be on his left hand side ( opposite side of  Pantaloons ). People of different ages were waiting for their turn to have their food . Waiting time was short as the staffs are efficient & prompt in serving . Seating is not available but people were using the base of the trees to sit & chat among themselves . I chose the takeaway option & ordered Club Kachouri , Rabri & Kalakand . The Kachouri is no doubt good though the sabji is on the spicier side ( tastewise very good ) . 4 Kachouris for Rs 20 /- is reasonably priced . Rabri & Kalakand is good too .

Haryana stands amongst the two most sought-after non-bengali stand-alone "Singara-Kochuri-Jilipi" joints in and around Kankurgachi (the other being Nasta in its namesake Nasta-gali).
With seasoned appetizing food and courteous employees, one would find this place jam packed during the peak hours. The adjacent famed 'chai-wale-bhaiya' and the relatively contemporary Dominos' outlet doesn't aid in thinning the congregated assemblage either! However, what's a typical Sunday morning without queuing up for such mouth-watering deep-fried delicacies!?üòã

Second Hub of morning breakfast in kankurgachi.(First being Nasta). Be it kalakand, kachori, samosa or jalebi,this place wont disappoint you in any of them. 
Pocket pinch is reasonable.
Ask them to give to a samosa-sabji. If you like mixing things up, this will surely fill that craving of yours.

A famous sweet shop at Kankurgachi which most of the times remains crowded.

No points for ambience but service is good.

Tried their samosa & jalebi. Both were nice and fresh . Pocket pinch is reasonable too.

Haryana Sweets , the whole city is aware of this place. One of place to have Kachuri and Chats in Kolkata in pocket friendly prices. This place is almost open all day long. Whether you go early morning at 7 or late night 10 The place is always crowded. Though its a normal place to have sweets and snacks but the quality of food is like no one can ever doubt so is the taste of the food. it is actually very cheap and value for money. the place becomes so crowded at times the road gets blocked due to non availability of parking. They also serve Samosa Gulab Jamun Lassi and lots of types of snacks and sweets. Dahi Bada and Kalakand is one of the best in city I guess. It's good to see that they are carrying their goodwill almost for 3rd generation now !!

Review: Hariyana sweets

This review will focus on various aspects of this fast-food joint.

Location - 4.5/5
Located on the stretch of C. I. T. Road connecting Kankurgachchi & Phoolbagan crossings, near the Kankurgachchi Pantaloons, and just beside the Dominos outlet, this little shop is easily visible from the road. Easily accessible by public surface transport, this place is fairly easy to spot.

Facilities - 3.5/5
Though don't have any dedicated parking spot, finding a parking spot within a walkable distance is fairly easy, even during weekends. You can eat standing there, or takeaway the food. No by phone order or online order facility is available.

Ambience - 2.5/5
You will literally have to eat standing in the narrow part of the shop, or on footpath. There is a washbasin that you can use, and nothing more. You won't even find any place to sit while eating here.

Food - 5/5
The best part about this joint - pure ghee-fried kachaudi, Jalebi, Gulabjamun & other sweets and amazing taste of the Rabdi are guaranteed to take your tastebuds to a joyride. Not really costly compared to what you experience from these freshly fried and freshly made delicacies. When you leave this little Madwadi shop with a riot of taste on your tongue, don't forget to bag a few "bhujia" packets for attractive prices, and pack some of the tasty treat for your near and dear one.

Service - 4/5
This shop is busy enough to attend to all your requests unless you order everything at once for the takeaway orders, and you may find a queue of 50 people before you waiting there for the same thing, but don't worry these people are fast enough so you won't have to wait too long. For eating on the spot they gladly comply to whatever you can eat, without much delay.

Overall - 4/5
This joint excels in the food quality, thats too for an awesome price. Just indulge yourself in all you can eat, still for a big foodie like me finds it hard to spend Rs. 150 in this shop. But, it is always better to takeaway the food to enjoy at your own place than having there (though that gives different sweet feeling by itself).

I would rate high for this outlet since I have been having kachori sabzi, samosas, jalebi and lassi of this place since childhood and it's still almost has the same delicious taste. Just love the kachori sabzi especially in the morning! Do give it a try and it won't disappoint u at all! U would need to stand and eat but I think for kachori sabzi that much can be compromised.:)

A landmark of Kankurgachi for its samosas, kachoris and lassi is Haryana Sweets.

It can be very easily located and is visible from the main road. Kankurgachi Pantaloons is a nearby landmark on the opposite footpath.

It is basically a take-away centre with a bustling and busy counter.

We purchased Samosas today.¬† The Samosa were medium in size and were pretty stuffed with potatoes. The filling of the Samosos were toothsome and steaming and the crust was crispy. They are serve with a sweet and hot chutney which always acts as a bonus.

The dearth of reviews for this place is due to the fact that it‚Äôs empanelment on Zomato was unduly delayed. Otherwise, it is one of the oldest and most popular outlets of this area. Have been visiting this shop, now for more than 25 years and have seen 2-3 generations of its owners! The outlet is pretty small and conveniently situated nearby Pantaloons, Kankurgachi. No seating arrangements are possible due to dearth of space and people enjoy their food merely standing outside the shop or while sitting in their cars. Also, a major chunk of customers opt for takeaways.

We ordered samosas and jalebis for takeaway. Quantity served is not great and size of their stuff is pretty ordinary. Samosas tasted fine but jalebis lacked the desired crispiness! Also, I strongly feel that food quality should be better. Prices are not high, but much better stuff is served by the nearby outlets like Bhikharam and Nasta.

Have bought their numerous other items in the past ‚Äì like club kachori, khasta kachori, imarti, kalakand etc. Their kachoris are nice but the sabji is often too hot and spices used are somewhat of an inferior quality. Kalakand is nice and fresh. Imarti used to be their USP until it was discontinued a few years back.

Nothing much to comment on the ambience either. Service is more or less okay.

Despite several drawbacks, this place does enjoy it‚Äôs share of customers!

Damn !! Foodies of Zomato ! How is this place not yet rated/ reviewed ! This is one small but very famous shop and the crowd here is phenomenal. Today I went there to get my share of kachori and saw that there was a queue of minimum 15 ppl to be served. 
They serve very tasty and hot hot kachoris with a yummy aloo sabji. Apart from that, the jalebis are also very tasty ! Best part is that the food is fresh all the time !

This place serves one of the best kachoris you can't resist this and will end up eating two plates of it. Apart from kachoris, the lassi is great too.
Despite being soo crowded almost at all time the service is really good and doesn't pinches your pocket much.

I am very surprised and Shocked to see that this place has not been reviewed till now. Its such an old Sweet shop at the Kakurgachi region. Always crowded with people for theit variery of sweets and other food stuffs.
Still its always be a great feeling to be the first reviewer of any place.
The first thing about this place to my mind is the Cost of the food stuffs.
Went there day before yesterday. Tried the Hing Kachori as well as the Dahi Vada.

1. Hing Kachori - Hing Kachori was tasty. It was served hot but the price of one plate really turned me off. Rs.20/- for two pieces i think they are charging too much, where as sharmas and guptas are charging Rs.20/- for four pieces.

2. Dahi Vada - Dahi vada was very good. One piece of vada added with lots of curd and the sweet chutney made the things more sweeter.

Being so reputed at this area they hold a Monopoly. The sweets are yet to be tasted.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place,
