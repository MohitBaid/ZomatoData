This girl's baking is amazing!! I have tried it twice. Once i ordered a cake for my boss's birthday, everyone at ofc just loved the melt in the mouth cake. I ordered some cupcakes the second time for a get together at a cousin's place n they so fresh, n soft n awesome. The price is a bit on the higher side, but it's value for money.

I ordered a chocolate cake last week, the cake looked elegant, tasted great and ¬†was delivered on time.
They have a range of cakes to choose from with lots of innovative designs.¬†

Look forward to ordering from you again.
