The review is based on a deliverydelivery time- 1 hour late even after 1 hour of waiting time.food quality - tasted so -so , have had betterfood quantity , satisfactory , but for the amount of money, i could have had more food. hotdogs are just merely subwiches with paneer and 5 day old (brown ) lettuce . However the double patty veg burger was good . The patties were crunchy but very very thin .  Almost like wafers.
Verdict- there are better food joints nearby . Spend your money at your risk.

Well felt like having a pizza but quickly. Did not have the patience to wait for even 30 mins as was starving. As this place is only 200 meters from my place thought the delivery would be quick. Well ordered a Vada Pav which was well made but very spicy. it was properly grilled and Patty was appropriate. Than had Cheese Garlic Bread, which was ok 5 pieces were served. Finally the pizza had a Mexican Green Wave Pizza, well made pizza topped with Onions, Crisp Capsicum, Tomatoes, Jalapenos and Red Paprika with Extra Cheese. The pizza was worth the price. Overall good quality food at affordable pricing. Would try their other food items very soon. The only drawback is even though it's situated at a mere distance​ of 200 meters from my house it took them approx 55 mins to deliver the food.

Your all food items are best😍😍. I am your regular customer, your rate is also low from which I can eat a heavy meal. Your shakes are 😍, any food item without your shake is empty.

Cafeteria Club House is a small place but with seating space. The person who manages it is really friendly and approachable.I have tried almost all of their menu items like Cheesy Vadapav, Burger, Pizza, White Sauce Pasta, Garlic Bread and I would definitely recommend the Burger, White Sauce Pasta, and Garlic Bread. The Garlic Bread 🍞 is really lip-smacking!
