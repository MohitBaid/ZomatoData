Not up-to the mark as you can understand the quality of items if the price is so cheap..  Not at all tasty..  For people who cannot afford good food..  Plz visit there

I just couldn't believe I would find this one on zomato as well. It's basically a takeaway joint. I loved the food here. It's quite cheap and good to the pocket. Most menus are not available though. The staff behavior is also not that great too. The bonus is the price. So do try it because its got really good things at great prices.
