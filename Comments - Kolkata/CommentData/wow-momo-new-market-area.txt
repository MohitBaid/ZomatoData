What can i say about *wow momo* ... The name says it all, very popular momo joint in kolkata for sure.. they have more than 50 joint only in kolkata.. I'm the one of their fan customer...

I'm always satisfied with their food and services.
Since a long time i wanted to try their Sizzlers.
So Today Finally me and one of my friend hit the wow momo again and ordered 1 plate of chicken Sizzler momo...
Oh !! My God... this was Heavenly üòç Good..
#Pure_Bliss For sure

The quantity was enough for two people..
They served 3pcs streamed momo and 3pcs fried momo and in the base you have two options to choose , one is noodle and other one is Rice..
So we go for noodles and along with they served spicy curry and two types of sauces..
It was simply Delicious üíü
We enjoyed every single bit of it...

Service was fast
Staffs were friendly..

HIGHLY RECOMMEND !! To Everyone üòã

* I tried this Sizzler in Manisquare Wow Momo Joint , But in Zomato they didn't have that Manisquare wow momo page , so that i shared my views and experience in this page *

I believe your experience will be the same in almost every wow Momo joint. üòÄ

Must try them at least once.. bye and cheers!!

This place is located in the building of new empire cinema hall. Since the place is always crowded it is hard to get a sit. I tried their chicken baked Momo. Six pieces of Momo with noodles and lost of red sauce covered with cheese. I think the amount of red sauce was bit too much and overpowering the Momo itself.

Always a treat whenever we visited new market area. This place gives the momos steamed at the perfect measure and the stuffings are also intact. The thukpa that we had ordered in the Wow! Super meal was one of the tastiest I have tried. Do go for the pan fried ones. It's a great place for filling up after hops of shopping.

Came here several times. There is a baked Momo which I just love. Enjoyed so many times but then I went last time and my experience was not that good. There was no Chocolate momo, no Cold drinks, any many dishes not available. I had to settle for Schezwan Momo and Mojito and Momo burger. Nothing special. Let me tell you, never try that Momo burger and Mojito, it is horrible. The Mojito is waste of money, better get a bottle of cold water which would actually taste better than Mojito. Other than that, I do like this place and hope it improves.
Want to go there again.

Visit this outlet few days ago with one of my friend. The outlet situated at the ground floor of New Empire Building. The outlet remain crowded throughout the day, due to its location

Ordered one WOW! Super meal pack which included one chicken Mo-burg, four pieces of chicken steam momo, one non veg thukpa and Pepsi.

Momo ‚Äì Well steamed and the chicken filling inside was tightly packed and was in good quantity. Served with two types of sauce. Love it.

Mo-Burg ‚Äì Two bun with Chicken mono inside. Lots of mayonnaise was there inside the burger, which tastes awesome. The size was pretty decent.

Thukpa ‚Äì Probably the best thukpa ever tasted from a Wow Momo outlet. The soup was pretty dense and lots of chicken pieces were there. The noodles were well steamed and well cooked.

Overall a good dining experiences.

One evening, three of us went to this outlet for some snacks after a busy day shopping. It is located inside the eating area of the New Empire movie hall, along with Dominos, KFC and Scoop. It's an open area, though air-conditioned, with a seating arrangement of around 12-14 people.

Coming to food, we ordered a Wow! Value meal and a plate of fried momo.
WOW! VALUE MEAL (CHICKEN) : This consisted of a plate of Steamed Chicken Momo, a bowl of Thupka and coke. Now, one plate of momo contains 5 pieces. But the one in the value meal will have only 4 pieces. And that's not even mentioned, so the logic behind it is all Greek! And all Wow! momo comes sans the soup, which is a downside in itself.
The Thupka was on point. Though I personally would've preferred a bit more seasoning, but it was just as it should taste.
SCHEZWAN PAN-FRIED MOMO: It was not too oily, and tasted exactly like any schezwan dish should. But the filling was rather less. It was served with Tomato sauce and Dhaniya chutney.

The bill amounted to over ‚Çπ350, which is sightly on the higher side provided the amount they give. Overall, it's good for a one-time taste as there are tons of momo outlets out there which serve affordable and good quality momos.

This outlet at New Market, Lighthouse building, @has basically re-defined the word "spicy", to my utter dismay. I had ordered for 2 plates of chicken steamed Momos. But when they said that it was not available and that I can go for steamed chicken cheese or schezwan momos, I decided to try the latter. But never once in my wildest dreams did I realize that it would be so steamy, so hot, so spicy, that it would help us remember the names of our forefathers!!!!  We all have an idea of how spicy a schezwan dish can be, but trust me, this was totally out of the blue. On requesting that they change the untouched plate, out of the 2 plates that we ordered, they blankly refused, stating that it is obvious that a schezwan dish would be spicy. As if we don't know the amount of spice that the said dish carries. Anyways,  folks,  please be careful before ordering such a dish. Else,  best of luck!!!

Located in the New Market area beside scoop, Wow! Momo serves good Momo's in reasonable price. Only few seating arrangements were there.
Personally I am not a fan of Momo. But still I tried their Momo's and they didn't disappoint me at all.

Food Ordered :-

1)Chicken Cheese Pan Fried Momo In Schezwan Sauce (3.5/5): They served 5 big pieces of Momo. Each Momo contains good amount of chicken but no cheese was there.
The schezwan sauce was also good. It tasted good but didn't find any cheese in it.

2)Chocolate Momo (4.5/5): it is a Steam Momo filled with chocolate brownie and served with chocolate sauce and some chocolates. It tasted really awesome. Highly Recommended for Desserts!!

Service (5/5) :- Service was really fast. They served my order within 10 minutes.

Ambience (4/5) :- Nice Ambience. As it is in the New Market Area always crowded.

Price :- Moderate.

Overall :- (4/5)

Cheers!!

My atm card was inside my purse which was having quite some good amount of money as well.however i am very pleased that he returned me my purse intact.

Ohh!!Momo's literally  in love with them,from birth,I guess. And to put rest to that craving,visited WOW! MOMO and indulged into some great momo's-

CHICHEN SCHEZWAN MOMO-  it's for the spicy lovers. Superb momos stuffed with quite a generous amount of chicken. Served with green and red sauce.

CHICKEN PAN FRIED MOMO IN SCHEZWAN SAUCE - the momo are perfectly pan fried and are tossed in schezwan sauce and overall gives a great taste.

It is my favourite place to drop in after shopping in New Market. I love everything here except the chocolate momos, which do not work for me. You just HAVE to try their chicken cheese fried momo and chicken pan fried momos!! I am in love with Wow Momo. The schezuan momos are too hot for me though. 
Getting a place to sit here is quite an issue, since it is not that big. The service is good. It will take around 10-15 minutes for the food to arrive. Overall, I love this place.

This eatery is the heaven for momos. Maybe they are the best momo-makers of the city too. The taste of the momos matches rightly with my taste buds. Their steamed chicken momos are delectable. Also,the filling is not at all bad. It consists of good amount of chicken. But the best part of them is pan fried momos. Many people complain about their chocolate momos,but to me it's nothing but a sinful delight!

It's name resembles : it's only momos.

It's our regular venture when we r in kolkata, as a Chinese lover as well as fond of momo from mycollege days.

It's a good outlet serving Tibetan and chinese dishes and having outlet all over the India.Whenever we(me n my wife) get chance, we are trying different dishes from them.

I like all steamed momos (rather prefer steams over the fried one, as in fried you did not get original flavors of momos), Thukpa, and they newest venture named "Burger Momo" (one time you can try).

We will visit again and again...

Any visit to the New Market Area brags for a trip along the Lighthouse area which would result in trying either KFC, Domino's or Scoop. But, however, there are times when I have had entered Barista and Wow Momo.

Being located at such a prime spot, it is a hot shot place for Momo lovers. Since, I am not much fond if this North East dish, I do not prefer visiting it, unless of course, someone in the group forces. In one of those rare days, I happened to be at this place.

In the corridors of Lighthouse (Humayun Building) is this place standing upright without any enclosure but few seating arrangements. People visiting here generally is seen packing away food in a takeaway style, or, may be, that was a special day. Entering the horizons of Wow Momo, I pestered my friend to order who went forward with an order of a Non Veg Momo.

The staffs here are always seen preoccupied, partly due to the presence of customers all the time and partly because of their boredom with the work. The services, in my view, are slow enough. But, the saddest part of this place is that the staffs can never be seen smiling,.

The food, ie, the momo was okayish, but, the soup isn't good at all. Well yeah, you can say that since I do not like eating momo I am criticising, but, my dear, I am fond of soup which was not good at all. (Hint- Try the soup of Chicken Momo at Red Bamboo Shoot). Even the friend with whom I visited said that the quality is slowly deteriorating, hinting at the soup.

A visit not much recommended.

The staff members are friendly and can help us with their suggestions if we're confused about what to eat. 
I had tried Momo Augratin and Tandoori Momo. Both of them tasted really well and we're one of a kind. 
Tandoori momos left my taste buds tantalized. 
A  must try for every Momo lover.

Any day orders Mushroom fried momo, Chicken cheese fried momo and Chicken pan fried in schezwan sauce, and the soup it comes with it just fantastic.

Want to eat momos? Go to wow! Momo. The food is just awesome. I have had their chicken augratin, chicken tandoori momo, chicken cheese momo, corn cheese momo. All were yumm. Tandoori momo are a must try. The augratin was not that tasty as compared to the other dishes.

After shopping, pretty convenient place to stop by for a quick bite or pack your favorite momo home! On this occasion I tried their Veg MoBurg, delicious fried momo made into a patty. It's quite spicy so be careful or ask them not to add too much schezwan sauce.

Honestly, i hadn't expected a fast food joint could satiate my craving for pan fried momos but oh my...

Also i am high on The Big Bang Theory, so ignore my way of speech and unending craving for chinese and pizzas.

Baked chicken momo augratin is the best thing to eat from Wow Momo. Chicken cheese pan fried momos pretty spicy but tasty. Moburg is fine. If you want to grab a quick bite this place is fine.

This is one of the most crowded outlet of wow! Momo. Service is slow because its always crowded. Place is small.  However the momos are always upto the mark no matter however crowded it is. They never compromise with the quality. So a perfect place for post shopping hunger.

Ordered chicken momos and they have a upgradation to one Pepsi and a chicken momo burger at just add on of 75.

Apart from momos everything about this outlet is disgusting. The staff members lack professionalism. We were having a 2000 rupee note and requested them to take our order of 700 bucks and give us the change. They simple made a face and said that they don't have any cash as it is only 1PM. I mean what the hell? If that would have been an issue they could have said it politely. We almost requested them for 3-4times. Then a man over there was watching us for a long time and asked us to come down to him and then gave us the change of the sum. Worst experience.

This place is always busy serving someone or the other. The small shop will never let you go home without a  smile. The Pan fried ones are just too delicious to ignore. They make the most remarkable thukpa in this area as well. 
Though you must consider yourself lucky if you manage to getta seat but never mind 70% o the customers just don't complain as soon as they taste the Juicy dumplings.

First of all, I dont like their momos much. 
Secondly, the quantity is less as compared to the price. Then you have tax. 
I feel other momo joints like denzong or tibetian delights are much much better than wow momo. 
This is just a fancy place.

Recommended item are their Chicken Fried Cheese Momo . The whole place is so filled with that tasty aroma around you. 

I found the staff quite upbeat, so Kudos to that! 

Also, u really have to be quite quick if you want to grab a seat and table or even any one if that because that's how full the outlet is.

Tried their momo combos along with chicken thukpa, chocolate Momo and tandoori Momo. Chicken pan fried momo in schezwan sauce is always in my wish list whenever I visit wow!momo. This outlet has small sitting area where one can enjoy every bites of her momos. üòã

Wow ! Momo....Remains Wow in name only. The momos do not make you go wow at all. In fact they now seem to be interested in expanding and proliferating all over .....But their quality is abyssal. Their momos are just awful in most of their outlets, my experiences have been mostly disastrous and this outlet in the New Empire building was also very substandard. Not expected when you are paying so much. They have hiked up their prices but haven't bothered to improve their quality and taste. The staff at one time used to be good, now they aren't bothered.  This place is always crowded and noisy...So ambience too isn't good. But that is understandable being in the busy new market shopping area . But bad quality isn't understandable. 
My veg steamed Momo was underdone and I got a raw taste!

It is definately the best place to try momo of different kind. I tried tandoori chicken momo, burger momo, chocolate momo, chicken cheese momo in various occasions which were awesome . Their Thupka was good too. The sauce they serve along with momo is tangy and good too.
Sitting arrangement is not there , so one have to be prepared to stand and eat in a crowdy surrounding. Price is reasonable as per the quality, taste and variety.

After a long time we Bichra Hua Friends mate at New Market for quick shopping & hangout. Just like the shopping we decided to have a quick bite too at Wow! Momo. 

Last time my Wow! Momo experience was quite good at Avani, so this time I tried their left over menu items in this New Market outlate.

Located at New Empire building ground, just opposite to KFC & Scoop its an open dine Momo counter. Where someone can't expect comfort due to its all season crowd & non AC environment. I mean there is AC but probably that don't work at all.

We ordered 2 Chicken Pan Fried Momos in Schewan sauce. Thanks to Nearbuy we also got another plate of Pan Fried Momo in Tomato Garlic sauce. Their service was fast as always but...

Pan Fried Momo : Their momos are always fully stuffed with mashed chicken. These were same too but pan fried sauce just made it pathetic to enjoy. Both the sauce schewan & tomato garlic was excessive tangy & over spicy. Both the sauces tasted almost same, just hot & tangy. No flavour no taste was found. Excessive onion pieces were used. This time their Momos weren't so worthy & that disappointed me a lot.

There's a ton of options in New Market area to have a quick bite. Don't go over crowd here, as most of them are just running towards the brand name. Definitely I will not recommend this place.

My first exp with wow momo was this outlet when it was newly opened. Yes it's a review of an old exp.
Wow momo being a new concept , I sceptically 
Ordered veg steamed momo and a chicken pan fried momo .
But the food was awsome. 
Veg momo was grt
I loved the pan fried momo, hot, spicey and tangy . Just lovely. 
I only complain that they don't give soup with the momo :-(
Which is a wee lil downer .

I'm a big fan of Momos. Any Momo does it for me! From street side stalls to Specialty Restaurants..

When this outlet first opened, they did not have any seating arrangements. Now they have removed Cream & Fudge and extended Wow! Momo's area.
Their Momos are my all-time-favourite. From normal steamed to Pan Fried.

The only drawback now is that they charge extra tax for your orders, which previously they wouldn't. :(

Food :

We took the value meal - Chicken Steamed Momo + Chicken Thukpa + Pepsi

Chicken Momo - Really they make tasty Momo .The filling was very nice and the layer of the Momo was very thin and adequate filling .Only I found it a tad on the oily side 3.5/5

Chicken Thukpa - Lovely - quite bland as thukpa should be - the noodles used is worth mention - soup tasted nice - chicken chunks should have been a bit more 3.5/5

And my reason of reviewing a Momo joint is because of a sober experience that i had today . These days the momo outlets and especially wow momo themselves have taken the experimentation with the momos to a whole new level. Some of the dishes have not retained the originality of the momo, but the good thing is they donot taste bad.

¬∞ Location :- This come of age momo house is located at the maybe the hottest location of the city I.e in the heart of New Market . More prominently known as the New Empire building or Humayun Palace . 

¬∞ Food :- I would highly recommend the following items :- 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Classic chicken steamed momo ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- They do the basics right and the 6 pieces that are served have generous fillings of chicken . The size can improve a lot considering the price they charge , something to inspire from Momo Re . Other than its basic and good and just the one to fulfill your appetite .

2. Fried chicken schewzan momo ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- The most ordered item . Also the superstar of this joint . You will see hundreds of people ordering this . The reason is pretty simple , it's the spiciest thing available from here . There are 5 momos with quite a big filling of chicken , and the chicken is coated in chillis which make the mould really spicy . Infact they are not really momo , they can be called fried spicy meatballs . And they are yummy . The only complaint I have is that they have not retained the momo part in it . It has been made like more of a meatball. But if you like spicy momos, this is perfect for you .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬∞ Seating & Service ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- This is more of a mid sized kiosk . They have enhanced the seating recently . But I really loved the tables where you can rest your food and just have it while standing . If you are with your dear one it would be a decent new experience . Service is really really fast . Waiting time is approximately 6 to 7 mintues . 

So, if you are in new market and wanna grab the quickest of snack   trust me this is your best option . They are fast, the food is not extraordinary but will still fulfill you .

Startups are the order of the day. While we hear about the startups from Bangalore and Delhi almost on a daily basis, we don't really hear Kolkata doing much in this department. Wow momo is one successful startup from Kolkata. 
Strangely enough, I have always had bad experience with food in new market area. This one was no different. Ordered schezwan momos. Such a horrific experience. The momos weren't fresh. The chicken was stale and tasted disgusting, it had probably gone bad. Surprisingly though they refused to even change the order.

Located just opposite to KFC in the New market area, this is a small outlet and good staff. The quality of the momos is nevertheless unappealing and they charge extra VAT and service tax. Not quite satisfied.

I just had a take away from wow momos and the chicken momos were stale.
They were smelling and in bad distasteful
Such wilful callousness is not expected from a good brand name. I am strongly going to recommend my friends and family against visiting any wow momo chains because as it seems like, this food chain has no consideration for people's health
Disgusting staff and cheap antics.
Shame on you.

Whenever I think about having quality momo at a good price, this is the place I head for. I love their fast service and variety of momos. They offer something for everyone. I absolutely love their fried schezwan chicken momo, fried chicken and cheese momo and the fish momo. Though I prefer to have the fried momos but the steamed ones are equally tasty. And their portions are good too. Comparatively easy on the pocket and hugely satisfying.

The best part is ¬†the experiment these guyz are doing with momo. I mean its worthy.Tandoori momo is a good innovation,so is momo burger though au gratine is little behind in the rat race i feel.Chocolate momo is a treat to dessert lovers.My personal favorite is the fish fried one. Thukpa & wow softy is just average products.Yes they are highly priced but that is justified considering the quality & brand value they have gained in the recent past. Bon apetit.

They have recently re-vamped the whole place and added many items to the menu. I've been here quite a few times and also checked out their other outlets. Their new tandoori momos and the fried chicken cheese momo are to die for. Didn't like the Baked Augratin much, and the sizzler was okayish.Also loved the mo-burgs and the chocolate momo would be a special treat for the those with a sweet-tooth.
            

And the fact that they're so cheap, is an added bonus.
            

One should also visit their AJC Bose Road outlet, the view from the floor above on a rainy, melancholy afternoon, with your loved one and some music, ¬†would be dreamy. :)

Wow Momo doesn't need any recognition because of the popularity it has got over the years. The momos here are of great quality and they provide you with some great variety too.
This outlet of wow momo is one of the most crowded outlets among all the outlets. Always filled with customers. The reason is its location. Located in the buiding of New Empire in New Market Area, this place has to be filled.
The quality of food is same as other outlets. But the service is an issue. It needs to be improved. They take a long time to serve what you have ordered.
Overall a decent place if you want to have momos in New Market Area.

Kolkata is famous for its street food . Wow momo has introduced a new horizon to the momo lovers. I use to visit this joint every time i go to new market area . Before i tasted wow momo i used to have steamed momos . But here i first tried d pan fried momo .. the were delicious. What i like about them is their experimentation with momos. Their inventions like moburg, tandur momos, fried momos with various stuffings like chicken with capsicum ,cheese, corn etc are blockbusters. U can have thukpas also if u are full . Recently i tried baked momo augratin.. they provide great quantity and equally tasty. And last but not the least the desert CHOCOLATE MOMO. None can step out of the place without tasting it . They provide meals also . So being a foodie my journey to wow momo joints still continues.

Momos has been an integral part of kolkata's culture and wowo momo brings in some amount of homogeneity. Being primarily a street food there was always a an issue with the cleanliness and quality. Wow momo has been able to overcome that issue to bring momos to kolkatans in a new way; though they are slightly overpriced.

Have been to this outlet only for once. Tried the pan fried prawn momos. Oh my God! That was so delicious. Yummy, saucy and juicy to the fullest. Then thought of trying the chocolate momos once again as I didn't like it the first time when ordered from my residence outlet. Still it wasn't good. The cover was thick which I don't like at all. But the prawn momos were too good.

Have you tried the Chicken Baked Augratin here? It is simply awesome! Don't forget to take the large portion if you are accompanied with someone. The dish contains Pan Fried Momo's at the bottom most level followed by a layer of Haka Noodles. At the top is a mixture of Egg and Cheese which when reaches your mouth will just melt giving you a taste which will surely relish your senses. I cant wait to have it again..This Wow Momo outlet is good enough but i was not really happy with their service.

Location : new market area, just in front of box office of new empire cinema hall

Service : self service

Food ordered : 
Momo au gratin veg
Pepsi

Description : momo au gratin is a new item added to the menu at wow momo. It contains 3 pan fried veg momo and veg noodles and topped up with lots of cheese and baked. Taste was average. Hakka noodles doesn't go with au gratin. It is too dry to be called as gratin.
Having said that I like their minds a lot , specifically pan fried momo. I like wow momo for bringing the legacy of momos in Kolkata.

I was a momo lover and still I am but this Wow momo has made me fall in love newly with the momos. I have been to this outlet several times and always I found this place with full of people as the location is New market area, just the opposite of KFC. No seats or just 2 round tables to stand and have was common to see always. But this time I saw it in a different look. Very well managed in that small space. The yellow colour long table where without pushing each other u can stand and keep your food and enjoy the hot momos or u can sit and eat in that small sponge seat. After u pay the bill of your orders they will collect the receipt to prepare and after finishing they will call out the name of the dish. Just go and take it and start enjoying your food.
The steamed Chicken momo; thukpa, spring onion and corn momo are always been my favourite. The tangy and spicy schzewan sauce is too good here.
So for me coming back here is very common and easy too.

Wow Momo has taken this Tibetan delight to another level. I mean who could have thought that momos can be available in tandoori style! Their tandoori momo is excellent. Not to forget the Italian style Baked Momo Augratin....amazing! The concept itself is worth appreciating. Of course their cheese chicken momos, steamed momo and momo in schezwan sauce is good but if you are a foodie who likes to check out experimental menu...try out tandoori momo, augratin and chocolate momos. Yummylicious!!!!!

As the name suggests, the momos are really ... Well...wow! They are juicy,succulent, moist, overflowing with flavourful stuffing. They always serve fresh dumplings which justifies the waiting time. I love the prawn stuffing as well as the chicken and capsicum one.
The thukpa is really out of the world. Definitely recommend that for all healthy eaters. 
Only thing is that the seating arrangement is a little uncomfortable. Moreover, you'll struggle to find a place in the evenings when it's usually really crowded. They really should open up a proper restaurant.

Its almost amazing to see, how the once vacant New Empire Cinemas has turned into a food lover's paradise and amalgamation point of some of the popular names in Kolkata cuisine history books. Wow Momo, too, here is no exception and forms a part of this group of food outlets and remains super busy throughout the day to dish out delicious Momos.

Due to the large volume of order they partake with, the Momos here are fresh. I have had Chicken Momos and Chicken-Cheese Momos. Both of which were fresh and had sufficient feeling. The staffs here are supercool and prompt with their service. However, the rush here can be a little bit concerning, but that is nothing you can help with.

Wow Momo has never managed to wow me. I have tried different momo from this place. There isn't anything particularly mind-blowing about the dumplings of this eatery. I tried thukpa from here for the first time. If that's how thukpa tastes everywhere else, I think I wouldn't like to try it again. I'd rather have the instant noodle-soup available in the market, because the taste is same. I also tried the chocolate momos. Again, nothing remarkable. Located in a crowded area, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the lively ambience. It's often hard to find a place to sit here, though, and you might end up eating while standing.

The staff working in ds counter are very amiable. Once i got a 1 piece of momo in my plate which was almost smashed and informed them. Immediately they provided me wid a fresh piece without any hesistation. Ask them for the sauces once or twice n you vl get it widout ny smirk :)

I am rewriting my review about this outlet of wow momo for a serious reason. Last month when I went there and ordered my favourite chicken schezwan steamed momo and they served me a completely rotten one. I parcelled the food so couldn't return it. Next time when I again visited this restaurant (almost a week ago) and ordered chicken schezwan steamed momo again they again served me a rotten one. And that time I told them directly in front of other customers and trust me they were not shocked and they replaced it with a fresh one within 3 mins. I am repetiting it, yes within 3 mins. So? What is your say wow momo authority? Not expected from you guys. Never ever going to visit. Very very disappointed that you served me rotten momo intentionally. Shame on you. Even roadside momos are safer and cheaper than wow momo's momo. Am I paying 90/100 rs for a plate of rotten one? You are charging more but quality is poorer than the others. Is this the way of doing fair business?

Wow! Momo for some reason has never impressed me. I have tried their chicken steam momos, Prawn momos and ice creams. I won't stay that the momos aren't good. I, for one, have had better momos at Darjeeling and the chicken momo here is no way near that. It's okay but then it's kind of expensive too for the serving. I have definitely had 30 rupees momo tasting better as well. 
There prawn momos were also disappointing. I didn't like the taste of it. 
Moreover, when I asked for ice cream, they took 5 minutes to decipher what to do and then put the tuti fruti in the chocolate ice cream and chocolate chips in the strawberry one. When I asked, they just said sorry. 
So all in all everything was just okay and hence the 'okay' rating.

Visited the place few days before. I was such disappointed. First there were not enough seating facility. They keep you waiting. The AC was not working. They charge you 20%+ tax for such disgusting service with not even a fan above your head. Steamed momos were not even available.
I ordered chicken pan fried momos which was good. But the fried veg momos was so oily i had to literally dry it up in the tissue paper.

Wow momo has been one of the best place to have momos anywhere. The taste and quality of momos are unmatched. I like the schezuan momo and steamed chicken momos.

nice place to go...the staff is very polite and ambiance is nice. i had ordered fried momo which was just awesome ..would like to have it over and over again.. the chicken stuffed was delicious and the quantity was also nice ..i also had ice cream which had a gr8 taste but it was too flowy .they should improve this. apart from this, i would say very nice momos at reasonable ¬†price.

Its a small food joint inside new empire. Wow momo is a chain of fast food restaurants, they have their restaurant all over Kolkata providing tasty momos.

This one doesn't have much of a seating arrangement. But still one can enjoy the delicious Momos(steamed or fried).

Pan fried momo in schezuwan sauce is the go to dish here. I've tried their steamed momos and the chocolate momo, but they're not that great. With so many outlets opening up , it's quite easy to walk into anyone , every place has the same ' momo-ey ' feel :)

Ground floor of new empire is the location of the this joint. Not a big place and the seating arrangement is very limited and you will barely get a free seat out here.¬†

Ordered steam momo and Thupka. You will not have a difference in taste in any of their outlets, the momo being on a bit spicy side where as the Thupka is really nice. If you are hungry and just want to simply kill it with no other expectation simply go with thupka, serves the purpose.¬†

I am yet to try out some of the other dishes in their menu, will do it in the near future.

Tries this little joint of wow mom at new empire.luckily they had launched a new dish called baked chicken augratin on that day only. I dint wait a second to grab a bite of it and eventually I was all praises about it. Previously I had tried pan fried chicken momo in schezwan sauce and chocolate momo . But I would highly recommend baked augratin for those who love cheese and cream. 
To talk about the dish, its very similar to chicken lasagne except for the fact that they give pan fried chicken momos instead of shredded chicken. The momos are covered on top with noodles and then garnished with loads of cheese which on baking becomes a treat. And then you take a bite in mouth, the cheese melts at once which makes you feel like heaven. Well up next for me is to try the tandoori momo .till then do visit wow momo for this one

being the utter big fan of Wow! Momo, this time ACTUALY i m highly dissappointed with their new invention in momos... i.e., Tandoori Momos! I hav always been hooked on steam momos no matter in which outlet m i eating (be on road side stalls). Genuinely wanted to try out some tandoori momos along with the mo-burger...and both of them turned out to be disastrous in taste. I m feeling sorry 4 me as well as this outlet...coz i nva thot i wud start hating this plc so much aftr a dish! 
i was soooo hungry and i got myself deliverered with these momos...but the Veg Tandoori momos (soo high on price i.e., 156/-) and Mo-Burger (48/- inclusive tax) ... has given a horrible experience.
the momos has become so hard that it literally hurt my tongue while eating. the way they packet the sauce along with it...was tremendous..i mean seriously? they just messed up all the chutney and the onions all together! yukk! and the mo-burger- Filled with tooo much of BLAND tasting veggies inside and so less amount of mayo! i wud say...tht a road side vada paav wud hav tasted wayyyyy bttr dan tht!
all in all - a horrible experience with Wow! Momos this time :/

Recommend- Chicken momo burger,pan fried cheese chicken momo
the thukpa,veg mo burger,chicken stream momo,shezwan momo ,chocolate momo-all are tastey here.
Must visit for momo lovers,fitness freaks and hygiene freaks
I will personally recommend the big bazar food court for Wow momo

Well, they just make momo's... Not the authentic one's though...for authentic momo's u need to visit places like denzong kitchen n all...anyways...I will surely give credit wow! momo for completly changing the concept of momo in Calcutta.... Before wow! Momo came, All we knew was momo's are either steam or fried momos with very less option of veg chicken pork mutton....but now if u ever happened to visit any wow! outlet, just check their menu...its damn impressive.... They've possibilly made all kinda of momo and they r still experimenting and coming up with new stuff all the time....that's quiet impressive... No wonder they shot into limelight in such a short span....the food is quiet decent over here...nothing to over exaggerate about...I find them lil too over priced though and they add tax over the printed rates and that's too extra :-/....
This particular esplanade outlet was a tiny one and recently they revamped it and now the place looks fab...I particularly like their cheesy chicken momo...its really good.... And then last day I tried their new item called "baked momo augratin", it had 3pcs of pan fried momo at base covered with noodles on the top and then the whole thing was coated with cheese.... A kind of dish it was... I really liked it... I just feel that the price of items shud be tax included...that's all....

Great way to beat hunger when you are starving after shopping at new market area is to have amazing momos at Wow!Momo.

With so many good adjacent options, This place got overlooked a number of times. And Finally we nailed it today. They are really great in Momos. We tried the Chicken Cheese Momo, Momo Burger and the Chococlate Momo. I just loved the Chocolate Momo. Infact after having my food, I ordered another 6 pieces of Chocolate Momo for my home.

Excellent at what they do, Wow Momo makes 'wow-like' momos. This particular outlet is located at Esplanade under the edifice of New Empire. It's an easy location to spot.

I have been here quite a few times. Being a Bengali, I earnestly like to pick a thing or two from Esplanade, and in the process get myself famished. It was under these circumstances that I happened to come across this one so walked in to try it out.

The outlet is dinky. We ordered, and no guesses for this one, Momos of quite a few types! We just wanted to taste or rather savour the diversity in Momos as we are hot on Momos. They were so saucy, hot and thickened with the dollops of different assorted sauces and spices. We did ordered the un-tangy ones too, and yet they didn't taste bland or 'just boiled'.

I was really delighted with having served with such wonderful variations. I would really like to emphasize all of you to make an effort to go there and thus not deprive yourself from something so good, especially if you happen to be as much a Momos lover as I am if not more.

The food is definitely inexpensive here. You will have quite a few plates of wholesome and toothsome Momos in exchange of little expenditure over them. So do not shy away if you literally live off your piggy bank.

However a word of caution. The place as mentioned above is really small, a cubby-hole. Hence the seating arrangements in not really up to the mark. Also the place is all the time flocked with customers. So don't be surprised (or discouraged) if you realize that you have to stand in a queue!

The puja shopping has started and so is the food cravings at new market area. New market offers great range of food joints within every price range. This was my first eating experience at wow momo. 
Food- me amd my friend ordered pan fried  panner momo amd pan fried chicken momo. From the looks the food looked delicious. When it comes to the taste it was totally delicious. Each plate contains five pieces of momos. The schezwan sauce was delicious.  It was fulfilling.  
Location - this food joint is located at the ground floor of new empire hall. Though there are various other food joints around like KFC , spoon but wow momo grabs a great amount of foodies.

Sitting area is a great disadvantage here. They offer only two tables and hardly four chairs. Impossible to find seat when crowded. I strongly believe that every food joint should offer water free of cost.  
Price - The total cost was 223. Of course it was high compared to other outside momo joints but if you can compare the quality it was worth it.

New market will always remain the hub of kolkata food lovers given the number of eateries that this place has. Pooja shopping and no eating at this area. Sounds incomplete. Had pan fried momo and moburg ftom this outlet. Was so hungry literally jumped into it.

Located just at the ground floor of new empire hall this place is surely a boon for those hogging at hogg market and doing all the shopping and window shopping too ! Lol. 

Couldn't find any taste difference just this place is always so crowded, very difficult to find a place to seat even for one person. 

Sorry couldn't click as was too busy eating. Lol. The next time sure.

I simply love their momo and the varieties of the tibetan dish the food chain serves. The first thing that comes to mind after giving a bite is that the momo is heavy. It is filled with right amount of chicken and despite being heavy the walls of the momos remain intact. I love the pan fried momo and the chicken cheese steam or friend momo. Will try out the prawn and capsicum momo later.

I am not questioning the quality of wow momo here but this outlet is too cramped. Hardly 5-6 people can seat here. Forget ur momo if u have reached minutes after the show has ended in New Empire. U won't even be able to stand there rest aside enjoying ur momo.

Strictly for people who want to taste great momos. Not for street momo lovers. The hygine is strictly maintained with good taste and great service. It would be better if more sitting arrangements are made. Momos are just yummy. Try some spicy pan fried momos.

not a great one... the momos are ok. But you will get better momo than this at Rabindra sadan, street momo shop. The thing I dont like about wow momo is that, they dont serve soup with momo.

This is the best outlet of Wow! Momo.
I go there a lot of times.
Staffs are good. Location also. Food was fresh. But there is not enough seat availability. Although u do not need to seat for Momo.
I specially love the Chicken Cheese Momo.
I would love to go there again.

Recently , we were passing from bungalow road and  we ran into  this very colourful , vibrant looking small outlet in Kamla nagar serving hot dumplings in various versions , even a momo burger !! . So decided to stop and try hoping them to be a more hygienic and a better version of street momos . Wow ! Momo has a newly opened outlet near Delhi university ,bungalow road . Tried pan fried momos here which were basically veggie momos that were  fried and then mixed in schezwan sauce . Did not love it as I like my dumplings steamed as opposed to fried and schezwan sauce was quite hot , (can't handle spicey food well) . But momos by themselves were good . Secondly this kind of serving is messy to eat ,as in how to eat  this stuff w/o proper cutlery,plastic folks don't work here  . So pan fried stuff did not fare very well with me personally (just a personal preference ) but the momos were by themselves were well prepared . If you are someone who likes heat and saucy ketchupy stuff then am sure , you'll enjoy these . I'll try steamed dumplings next time .

Definitely not the best momo outlet in the city but they serve pretty yummy stuff. Their chocolate momos deserve a special mention. Not only is the concept unique, they serve it with a chocolate filling and lots of liquid chocolate on top and also chocolate crumbs spread all over. If you're a chocolate lover you will definitely love it!Apart from this, their fried momos are also quite good. I didn't like the steamed momos much though. Only thing is they should provide better cutlery.

Located at a very Busy Place in Kolkata , especially peak times during Special Festivals....  Very Common place for most of the people here, so one must come here and try out the Momos.... I had tried Cheese CHICKEN Steam Momo...... it's very very Tasty.....
Only thing they need improvement is that must increase the seating facility ....as it is a busy shopping place and people looks for a place to seat and dine properly...

Last time I had momo was at Pelling, Sikkim in December 2014. It tasted so divine that when I returned Kolkata, I stopped eating momo.   After hearing some suggestions I decided finally to give Wow Momo a try. I was sceptical that the "divine taste" would be lost. Today, after 6 months, Wow Momo proved me wrong. Thanks Wow Momo.

The only reason I didn't visit Wow! Momo or infact, any other major momo franchise before, is because of the presence of Denzong Kitchen near my college. But after a lot of persuasion from friends, I decided to finally see what the fuss was all about. I chose this branch as it was nearest to my french classes.
Ambiance is nothing special, it's a tiny kiosk inside the New Empire Cinema where you order the food, pay up front, take the food and take seat in one of the chairs. There's also a tall table in case you wanna stand and eat.
Our order was a Chicken Szechuan Fried Momo and a Chicken Pan Fried Momo in Szechuan Sauce. Service was commendably fast. The food was, well, all right. I liked how the skin remained crispy even after it was soaked in sauce. But the filling is where it failed to deliver. The chicken was dry and not very fresh. The sauce was quite good but had a weird aftertaste.
So, I'm not entirely satisfied 'cause I expected a lot more from such a renowned joint. But I'll surely visit it again and try the quirky dishes like the MoBurg and the Chocolate Momo.

After you are done with all your shopping in New Market, time to just sit (if you are lucky, else stand) and enjoy the momo. With so many joints around, one thing I have always found missing is the consistency. However, this place is probably one where the quality of momo is found to be quite consistent and good. Although I am not sure if I can say the same thing about the other outlets that they have in the city. The veggie momo is good but someone please tell me what the chocolate momo taste like?????

Wow momo has to be my favourite momo joint in the city. Be it their south city outlet, or their kasba or jadavpur outlet, the momos they serve are probably the best I have had. I would highly recommend their pan fried chicken momo in schezwan sauce - it's my absolute favourite - blows my mind every single time! The place is pocket friendly and service is usually fast, unless there's a huge crowd ahead of you.

Being a big fan of Momo Plaza, at last i decided to try Wow! Momo. This outlet situated inside of New Empire Cinema at New Market. Space of the dining area is very small, they had 1 standing table n 4 chairs. 

First time i tried Chicken Pan Fried momo here, and it was awesome.

Service is fast and the total bill came 100 rupees.

Recommended for momo lovers :)

It's always a delight to grab a bite at any of the Wow Momo outlets. They fed me well at Axis Mall, at Salt Lake and now at New Market. Heard that this one is their first stall so it was kind of a privilege I'd say to have my share from here. The momos are as usual fantastic and you don't feel a pinch while paying. It's so pocket friendly and the quality is so good, at time found to a restaurant and wasting time ordering food seems useless. I'd always rate this brand as one of the finest in town. They make my favorite pan fried momos the best way I'd want it. Seriously guys, keep up the good work.

Nice and small place for such tasty food. I love momo, so wow momo has helped me to get nice momos wherever I have been. But day by day the size of their momo is reducing, but the price is increasing. If you are staying in a place where you don't have any other option it will help you a lot. But in a place like Kolkata or Delhi where you have endless option you can avoid this place and try the road side outlets. They are cheap and tastes better.

One word WOW! I like spicy food and to my best guess every item here is spicy as I only ordered the Steam Momo & MoBurg. The Moburg was awesome It was spicy as well had a decent flavor of chilli and sour with lots of chicken. Momo was hot and spicy too. Delivery time was good too. However there is very limited sitting arrangements and only one table. Price is reasonable, well mostly.

Wow! Momo....yeah, truly wow!
I ordered chicken steamed momo, pan fried chicken momo in schezwan sauce and chocolate momos.
Momos taste delicious and are fresh. The schezwan sauce is tangy and spicy just the way i like, steamed momos are about average and the chocolate momos, goodness! These are sinfully chocolatey! Chocolate momo might not sound good and is mysterious but trust me its fab.
The only problem is lack of space. Its too crowded during the peak hours and you CANNOT get a seat. Standing and eating hot momos is a tough thing to do for sure.
Sorry guys i was too indulged in gulping them so couldn't click pics. I'll surely upload some the next time i visit Wow! momo. :)
Happy Eating!

Wow momo definitely does justice to its name! Wowwww :) The steamed momos are soft and juicy while the fried ones are crunchy. My latest try was the moburg(momo+burger), although the red sauce was too red to be natural,the large amount of chicken in the momos inside the burger earned the brownie points! I will definitely go there again to try thukpa and pan fried momo in scezwan sauce about which I have heard a lot. The only bad part about wow momo is its almost a take away joint, 4-5 chairs and a standing table is all that it has.. but we will manage if you promise to make those awesome momos forever :* N.B.  I wish they provided soup with the momo :( infact what is momo without the soup..

Wow momo is one of the very known food joint in kolkata. This one is just beside the dominos, new market area.  Well, as the name suggests, the momos r really wow. We also ordered thukppa but it has nothing special in it. Though it tastes good but it is like soopy noodles. But i liked the soup. The price is reasonable. So it deserves a 4 star!

Wow momo is one of the most popular momo junction in the city. This one is very busiest one. Tried steamed chicken momo. It was delicious and the green and red chatni made it more tasty..

We have placed an order for our corporate employees, 86 no
of boxes of different item combinations of veg and non-veg momos of 4 pcs in each box. It was
discussed and confirmed by¬†the manager and the payment was accordingly made.¬†¬†

The delivery was made and accordingly the distribution was
also made to the invitees/colleagues. To our utter shock we found that instead of 4 pcs of items in each box,
¬†2 pcs were delivered. This was totally a loss of face to all the
invitees.¬†¬†

On calling up the respective outlet, they have agreed to
refund the value of undelivered quantity.¬†¬†

It is quite uncomfortable from the incidence ¬†that due
to ‚Äúmistake‚Äù of WOW Momo, we had to face this disgraceful event in our
organisation.

We ordered a chicken steamed momo for 75 bugs and it was smelling,on making the counter staff aware about it he didn't utter a word and replaced 3 pieces with a new one as if he knew they were not good or were a day old stock ,so at last would like to say please improve the taste as it is not the same taste as it was before,the sauces were good,especially the green one

pan fried momos r really nice. i prefer the shezwan sauce. steamed momos are okayish.¬†love their chicken mo-burg (burger) the mayo and the chutney they use in it is just lip smacking! :P¬†i even tried the thukpa one, it was good but not so great!

-their  pan fried momos are a delight!
-less sitting area.
-slow service (but can be ignored)
-awesome taste.
-pocket friendly.
-normal fried momos(without gravy) are not that good.

The momos here are nothing great. First of all, the outer coating is very thick which shouldn't be the case and the chicken filling is way too less. I mean for a chicken Pan fried momo you charge 95rs and this is what you give. Wow momo was my favourite for momos, but now I think the price is ever increasing while the size of the momos are shrinking. I don't know if I am the only one complaining, but I think there are many other food joints in Kolkata that serve better momo.

Oh my god.. I haven't yet reviewed this. This is the first wow momo in kolkata. This is where it all . The whole awesomelicious momo journey. I m a major steamed food fan. N momos got a new dimension after wow momo came into existence. After tibetian delite. It is wow momo for momos. No place to sit here. But the food compensates it all. The excellent chicken momo in garlic sauce n also schezwan sauce. My first fish momo tale started off here. My first chocolate momo. Oh my god. This place is goddamn nostalgic for me. Thanx wow momo for this lovely momolicious journey.

Momos are awesome as we know :) The best I ever has was in Gangtok, which is kind of obvious. The second best is undoubtedly WoW Momo. ¬†Been there don't know how any times. Have tried almost every thing there but my favorite , pan fried in tomato garlic sauce. Just try it here, you get the best it can get. Though the place is surrounded by all other junk giants but makes no difference to this small outlet of WoW Momo. Must say they simply justify their name by their taste :)

My most favourite one : Chicken Fried Momo .. but their chocolate momo is just a must taste one. Its different and tastes great.
Little too much sweet, but really nice. Even chicken pan fried momo is a yumm number. For food I will give 4.5/5 .
Then comes the ambience. Its along with the movie hall New Empire. So if you unfortunately visit there at movie time, then its a mess . suffocating crowd. Only 4 chairs to sit,otherwise you can stand and eat at the tables placed. Little clumsy environment, because of everything in one place - movie hall,ice cream parlor , KFC , Dominos.
Please ignore the environment anyway and enjoy the delicious momo platter :)

Happy eating ! :)

The place is located on the front of new market, and 3 mins walk from the ESPLANADE metro. Not all of the momos are good enough. I suggest you to try the pan Fried momos. The tomato garlic choice is the best i tasted here while fish one is the worst. The place is really uncomfortable, while it is not air conditioned. You get lot of noise, and a dusty view from the place. But the good 3.5 points are for the really different approach. The chocolate flavors are good choice for kids. The few good momos they make are really deserve 5 upon 5.

I was extremely hungry and was craving for momo's when i came across this place. After having a quick look at the menu i asked for their opinion on the best momos they had to offer and they told me about the pan fried ones, so i decided to order them and thankfully was not disappointed.

The crust of the momo was nice and crisp and they had put a generous amount of their own sauce across the momo's which was pretty tasty but very spicy. The filling was pretty good too and there was a generous amount of chicken in it. 

All in all, given the choice i would definitely choose momo's from carts in darjeeling and delhi but i think this particular outlet of 'wow momo!' managed to live up to its city wide reputation of being one of the most popular momo chains in the city and there is honestly not much to complain about the momo's. However i think the excessive sauce kind of overpowers the dish and i would prefer to eat the momo's without any of the sauce.

I have generally been to MOMO plaza for tasting the pan fired momos, and they are simply awesome in that. However, as on an evening I was trying out the food options in new market area, I found this tucked inside the new empire area. They have 2-3 tables and some chairs and doe snot offer a great place to sit and enjoy. However, their pan fired chicken momos were excellent- juicy with sauce, soft, tasty and YUM. Their service time is also good, and customers are in good numbers here. Give it a try! I plan to try their Mo-Burg next time.

Visited this place last year to try their momos and other dishes. Being a reputed chain they are expected not to disappoint and though this joint did not disappoint me, I guess the quality could be better, there is an scope of improvement.
A nice place however to go with friends for evening snacks or can try other dishes as well.
Overall it's better than just good.

Location: New market. 

I dropped by this outlet of wow momo while on shopping rounds at new market. 

Since, wasn't quite hungry, just ordered for a plate of panfried momo. 
The panfried momos were good to taste along with the sauce it was tossed in, just a bit oily. 
The oil that was put while tossing was visible, which shouldn't have been the case. 
Have had better ones at other outlets of wow momo. 

Prices are pocket friendly. 
Quick service considering the crowd rush at new market. 

A good experience. Could have been better.

Yes the momos are good I personally like the CHICKEN MOMO very much but has anyone thought of the hygiene of this particular outlet. Last Saturday when I was there just around 3 pm the momos were delivered to the outlet I was left awestruck. The trays were kept just beside the a dustbin. You think its a lie! Have a look at the photo.

Have been to this place ample number of times.. After loads of shopping wanted to grab a bite on momos.. The place is always full of people.. You have to sneak in and make place while you are about to order.. Coming to the food review had tried the paneer momo along with corn pan fried momo and plain veg steamed momo.. The momo were not that great.. Other outles like the south city ones serve better in terms of taste .. Street stalls serve better momo in new market compared to this place in a mere 20 buck.. Hope they improve the food quality soon...

Wow momo is a chain serving hot and piping momos in the city.Their most popular outlet i think is the new market one,forever crowded.You have to fist fight and often expression fight (read frowns) with people to let you in and if you lucky you ll find a place to sit ;p 
I have tasted all of their veg preparations including the veg,paneer,,corn and spring,mushrooms and corn cheese and my favourites are the veg,mushroom and corn and spring.The rest i feel are frantic attempts to innovate,but they dont like up to their expectations.Somehow i dont like the idea of a momo stuffed with paneer :/ I absolutely love the veg,and mushroom and the corn and spring is also very good.The portions are good and filling for 1(1 plate for 1 person should suffice)the momo sauce isnt very fiery and the additional green one is good too.The veg pan fried momo in schezwan sauce is lip smacking.Their tomato garlic sauce dosent dissapoint either(but i like momo plaza for that better) .The thupka is also decent. Oh and i dont like the chocolate momos :/ ( i have had chocolate puchkas, chocolate pastas before and they tasted okay,but chocolate momos umm i dont fancy them ) 

Overall wow!momo does wow you with their offerings.Must try place if youre a momo lover.

I regularly visit this outlet every time I go to shopping with my parents.We always opt for the steamed momos,specially Chicken Capsicum.They Serve Momos hot and fresh with two great chutneys.Recently I tasted their pan fried Chicken momo in tomato and garlic sauce and it made my day.It was so tasty that it made me think what was I doing all these years with steamed momos.The chocolate momo they serve is good but quite overrated too.

On a fine friday evening ,me and my friend M visited WOW! Momo with 2 Groupon deals ,so that we get to explore few of their momos ..Placed at the heart of Esplanade area underneath the New Empire Building ,in front of  KFC, this place always remains crowded.So we had to wait for a while to get a seat and also because they barely have enough space .. 

Feeling blessed by the Groupon deals we went on ordering Chicken pan fried momo in schezwan sauce, fish fried momo,corn and cheese fried momo,pan fried prawn momo in tomato garlic sauce and finally 2 chocolate momos...All the dishes were served with chutneys and sauce as required and had 5-6 pieces each... 
Chicken pan fried momo in schezwan sauce: Pan fried momos served in some sort of dry gravy which tasted the same as in schezwan dishes in chinese restros, but tasted nice enough to satisfy us.. It was a bit chilly (though its obvious for  schezwzn dishes ) due to which we had hard times..Its never easy to gulp these when the surrounding temperature readings are nearly 40 degree celcius..At that very moment chocolate momos came to the rescue and we rushed on to give a bite..:D
Fish fried momo : This ,in fact did not trouble us and being a dry dish ,it tasted great with the condiments.. It's a must try if you happen to visit WOW momo.At no time we finished this and were craving for more..
Corn and cheese fried momo: Fried momos having enough portions of corn and cheese to please ,this is a well-recommended vegetarian dish..The taste improves even more with the chilly sauce provided...
Pan fried prawn momo in tomato garlic sauce: Unlike the schzewan sauce, the gravy  was a bit sweeter in this case. Had enough puddings which had the flavour of prawn but if you look taste-wise,according to me, schezwan sauce was better than this one ..This  part depends on your taste buds..:)
Chocolate Momo: This generally seemed to be the blessing in disguise which rescued us from the hot and chilly momos.. Its something we tried for the first time ..This is actually a steamed momo topped with shredded chocolates , chocolate corn flakes and finally garnished with chocolate sauce.. All is good ,even it tasted heavenly but only when grab a bite along with all the toppings .. Deep inside its only the steamed dough. So after taking few bites the toppings were almost gone with the dough still remaining.. So we didn't like it that much but still its a good new idea.. Maybe they need to work on making it better and i feel adding some chocolate sauce at the beginning to the dough will make the dough chocolaty(Just an idea though :D)..
Anyway we did find us looting them with the groupon deals.. :D :D Just paid Rs 205 for the whole meal for the two of us..Had a great time there and will visit again for the fried momos ,which may be frequented by Groupon.. :D

The most widespread momo outlet in kolkata with over 10 outlets across the city. You must not miss this place if you are a momo lover.
Ambience 7/10
The outlet is in the common area in front of kfc New Empire with very few seats. You may not like to sit and eat there,but who does? Carry your plate of momos and do some window shopping!
Food Presentation 8/10
You get the steamed and fried momos with a green sauce and a red sauce. The pan fried momos look appetizing.
Food Quality 9/10
You'll certainly fall in love with their pan fried momos any variant. It's spicy tangy and filled with minced chicken or vegetables. The mushroom fried momos are also crisp and tasty. The chocolate momos are good,though some may not like the concept of chocolate inside a momo.
Food Quantity 8/10
They give you 5 momos per plate. Suit yourself.
Cost Effectiveness 7/10
Not as cheap as we're used to having from local shops,but the pan fried is a must try,and this outlet time and again comes up with offers on that!
Overall 39/50

As I  was  near the Esplanade area ,  wanted to   visit the  New  Empire and   came   across  this   Wow  Momo  outlet...earlier   had  tasted their   momos at   the  Avani  Riverside  Mall  outlet and had  thought  it  was  average   that  time... So  this   time  thought  would   give  this  place  another  try... On  entering , the  place  a  small  part  of  the complex  with   a  kiosk  and  some  chairs for  the  customers  ... I  ordered  Chicken  steamed  momo , Prawn  Pan fried  momo  and  Chocolate  Momo  platter  to  be  parceled... 
Coming  to  the  taste... The  steam  momo tasted  nice  along  with  the delicious  chili  and   green  chutneys ...  Tasted  Pan  Fried  Prawn  momo   for the  first  time  and  it  was  an instant  hit! The delicious  taste  of  the  sauce mingled with  the   prawns  to  create a  great  taste!   Last but  not  the  least  ,  the  chocolate  momo  along  with  the  chocolate  sauce and   chunks  of  chocolate   was   just pure  heaven! The  momo filled up  with chocolate  brownie  was  great ,  not  too  hard  like the  Avani Mall  outlet ,  but  just  perfect! Would say   value  for  money  ,   given  the  great  taste   and  the  service was   fast  and the  food   was  foiled  and  remained  hot  for   quite  some  time!  I  would  say  ,  go  for  it  guys! :)

Are you at New Market for shopping or for movie in New Empire and your plans of having a munch in KFC is cancelled because  its full. Dont worry try this Wow Momo outlet !

Its just beside KFC(or actually opposite to it in the same building). Their momos are real wow.
Not only the steamed ones but the Schezwan fried or the pan fried momos are real JHAAL and crispy :D
I havent yet tried their mushroom momo, but heard its tasty as well. Someone plz do let me know about it.

The main server has been the same guy for last one year and a half. He is quick,smart and very helpful :)
The main USP of theirs is the Chocolate Momo they serve. Its just so yummy that I have no words for it.
Do try the Chocolate Momo, its worth remembering :)

Wow Momo keep rocking :D

The outlet is small.But it's still pretty airy,which ensures that discomfort is minimal. They could do with increasing the number of seats,though. However,this is where all the negativity ends. Because the food here at Wow Momo really is a treat for the taste buds. Ive tried almost all the fare they have to offer. My special favorite is their Fried Fish Momo. I had initially been skeptical regarding this item,but after trying it out,there's really no looking back . I also like the fried Paneer momo. The shredded capsicum and paneer stuffing is a gastronomic delight. To be honest,one wouldn't expect this sort of effort go into a momo. But that's exactly what Wow Momo does. Hence all the ' much-deserved ' adjectives. The pan fried chicken momos are wonderful as well. But this is a fairly common item,available ubiquitously in the city.Hence I generally focus on the more innovative items on the menu. Thukpa is pretty ordinary , though. An interesting item I tried recently here is the Chocolate momo. I hadn't expected anything of this sort. It gets full points for quirky application,and the chocolate syrup and sprinkles are great. The main thing however confuses the senses,though,mainly because its such a new approach. Its almost like a warm Tibetan version of a brownie. A fun try for the adventurous hidden in us all. Prices are all pretty decent,with per plate costs ranging from around 60-100 rupees on an average. Great snacks,at great prices. Bon appetit .

This was one of the first few outlets this chain had opened and in those initial days i was very disappointed with their quality and food  but my faith is reassured again as they are now making much better momos and especially the veg ones. The sector 5 outlet and the city center outlet reassured me that  quality is being provided . Had the momo here especially like the sauce they serve in the pan fried momos ... even the steamed chicken are way better than before.

I have visited this place a while ago, as me and my friend was on run to grab a movie. It is not a convenient place to rest if you are planning to. They have very small place with only three or four chairs to sit on. The ambiance is nothing to talk about. 

On my first visit I had Chicken pan fried momos in schezwan sauce, which was enriched with soy garlic and varied spices with a touch of green spring onion. The mushy chicken inside the dumplings were flavorful too. I had tried their Chicken Thukpa which I experienced lack in flavors, I thought I was gobbling a hot water boil veggies and chicken. I had savored their simple stream Chicken Momo, which was tender and chunky chicken in it was quiet nice. 

Their service is good; at least they try to be quicker. Now they are installing outlets in different places to reach more people.

Every time I am near a ‚ÄòWow! Momo‚Äô outlet, I never miss to order a plateful of momos. Momos are my all time favourites when it comes to enjoy quick snack. I have eaten all kinds of momos in ‚ÄòWow! Momo‚Äô outlet but my favourite is their chocolate momos. Don't miss the Chocolate Momo whenever you give a visit there. Dipped in chocolate sauce and topped by shredded chocolate makes it more delicious and yummy. There are only 4 ‚Äì 5 chairs kept for customers, so musical chair game is always on. ‚ÄòWow! Momo‚Äô is pocket friendly and worth giving a visit.

Even though Kolkatians go for the Street side momos, but one must try momos @ WOW! Momo.... They are just AWESOME. You may try any momo from  the menu, you will not be disappointed with the quality and quantity of the food. The stuffing of the momos are sumptuous. I found their menu list to be very innovative. My favourite and a must try is Chicken Capsicum Momo and Szechuan chicken. Just love them.  Must try!!!

I am a big fan of momo and as a result I troed their doshes at Avani and at New Empire.Too simple and predictable..Nothing special.There are several places where you will get better momp at that price..

Pros : 
- Food quality is good
- Service is good
- The place is clean and hygienic 
- Ambience is average

Cons :
- Overpriced, if you are considering to eat momos at Rs. 60-70 a plate
- Place is too small
- No place to eat, if it gets crowded
- Food quantity is not worth the price

Conclusion :
If you want to shell out money for overpriced momos, then it's yours, otherwise there are better places in New Market area to have momos of similar quality at a lesser price

Recently went to New Market, and since I was on a run ordered a Szechuan chicken steamed momo and a mushroom fried momo for myself and a friend, with the deal that we would share. The Mushroom momos were not bad, although it was overly salty. The chicken momos had a thick skin and did not taste very fresh. I have had the Szechuan momos before and I think the meat was not too fresh this time. I quit after eating one, and ordered a cola to wash the taste off my mouth. The cola came without any bubbles, and when I said that, they defended that this was fountain coke and supposed to be that way. What rot!

The Pan-fried Momos (Fish or Chicken varieties) of Wow Momo is the best they offer; a little spicy but very tasty.
Steamed and Fried Momos and Thupkas are also on offer. Good for a quick bite, but very little space; so do not expect a place to sit, since the outlet is in a very crowded and popular area.
I hope the taste remains as good as earlier.

I like momo, not everybody does. Let me begin by saying that this place has pretty much nothing to offer to those who don't. Especially considering its location at the heart of a very busy area that is peppered with numerous food stalls selling a plethora of food of widely varying prices, this joint is to be visited only if you specifically want momo. I have never tried their thukpa, which is the only other thing on the menu and i think it will be hard to find someone who has. This place is not air-conditioned and doesn't have enough tables. Even if you do manage to get a table that you don't have to share with another group, you won't get a chair to sit on. Ordering  thukpa would thus be rather inconvenient unless you want to sweat it out with a bowl of soup in your hand.

The prices are somewhere between cheap and expensive. The basic boiled and pan fried chicken and veg momo are relatively cheap but no better than those I've had at many road-side stalls. Their coconut and green chutney though are quite nice, as is their spicy red one. The pan fried momo with tomato and garlic is good, but more expensive. The Schezwan sauce will burn your tongue and you will remember it. The one time that I asked for fish momo, they weren't available which was quite disappointing because they are not very easy to come by . I was hoping they would be the one special thing about this place. The chocolate momo was as good as most chocolate dumplings are. While it is a clever addition, it isn't extraordinary. 
 
This place is located in one of the cheaper areas in the city. Moreover it is located in the same building as one of the oldest and one of the cheaper movie halls in the city. I am assuming that most people visit it on days that they do not want to spend too much, like I do. The better dishes are on the expensive side and the regular momo is neither cheap enough nor extraordinary, especially to someone who has had momo at too many stalls to be easily impressed. The temptation of all the food in and around this area also hinders subsequent visits. Even as a momo loyalist, I can't say this place stands out.

WOW goes for this place so called as WOW! MOMO. Their stuffing whether it be chicken, fish or prawns is awesome. One plate of momo would never be short for any person. The sizes are also relatively big. The schezwan momo tasted quite spicy but was brilliant. What I found interesting is that generally if you visit any average chinese restaurants you tend to get a feel that the prawns used are not fresh cause they generally use packet shrimps. But this was not in the case of this place as I found their prawn momos to be tastier and quite innovative than their chicken momos. This might be because I never had tasted prawn momos before in this city. In one single momo you could find 5 to 6 pieces of prawn which really made my day. Again the quality of fish which is used in their fish momos are also quite fresh and the taste had proved that.Thumbs UP..Cheers!!!

Been to the sector v ,avani and new empire outlets.Momos are my favourites and wow! Momosone of the joints which i recommend for good momos.They have wide range in both fried and steam.Pan fried momos are really tasty,maily the schezwan one.
The one item which i love most is their Chocolate Momo .

Do visit for tasty,healthy ,pocket friendly momos.

Only thing is that their joints are really small without decent seating arrangements.Good for take aways!!..

Just one visit to Humayun place and i am ready with three reviews. First coming to wow momo, i have already tried their outlet in sealdah big bazaar and loved it,so i had great expectations from this place and they lived up to it. There was an offer going on chicken pan fried momos in szechuan sauce and that delighted me all the more. The momos were spicy tangy and soft! We also chose a chicken capsicum momo and my vegetarian friend chose the mushroom momo. Both of them were very very good. The only problem here is the crowd and dearth of tables. otherwise highly recommended.

Every time I am near a Wow! Momo outlet, I make it a point to drop in and order a plateful of momos. Among a variety of healthy and wholesome eating options, momos are my favourite. Soft and succulent, momos can satisfy my hungry gut at any hour of the day. Momos are flour dumplings. And we all know plain flour doesn't taste good. But momos taste delicious because of boiled stuffing and spicy accompaniments. The stuffing is seasoned with rare herbs to taste awesome. Wow! Momo, unlike maximum momo outlets in Kolkata, has a wide array of options listed on the menu card. 
 
I eat to my heart's content lip-smacking steamed chicken momo (plain), chicken capsicum momo or chicken schezwan momo whenever I visit a Wow! Momo outlet. Generously filled with mince meat stuffing and served with spicy chilly sauce and pudina chutney, the above varieties are awesome. At times, I also settle for the pan fried ones of the same variety, which are served steaming hot with the same types of sauces and chutneys. Those who prefer fish over chicken may order some fish momos (steamed or fried) or prawn momos (steamed/ fried) here.  Wow! Momo has quite a number of options for the vegetarians. If you are strict veggie you can opt for mushroom momos (fried/steamed), paneer momos (fried/steamed) or corn spring onion momos (fried/steamed), offered at reasonable rates.

You can also enjoy your 'momo bites' (only pan fried momos) with schezwan and tomato garlic sauces. The crunchy momos along with the spicy- tangy sauces taste delicious! The newest addition to their menu is yummy chocolate momos. Dripped in chocolate sauce, the momos look so appetizing and succulent! At any Wow! Momo outlet cleanliness factor is always taken care of. Never will you encounter their service staff without gloves or caps while preparing or serving your momos. 

So, it's time to visit your nearby Wow! Momo outlet now! With total 13 Wow! Momo outlets in Kolkata, you are sure to find one near your place. Just a grab a bite now!

This like all the other branches serves very good quality momos and thukpas. I have stopped eating at most other places as i have been disappointed with the quality but Wow Momo is a brand that i can be assured of consistent quality whichever branch i go to. Their fried momo,steamed momo and the other innovations are very good and of good hygienic quality. The pan fried momo though is a bit spicy.Price is just right and service is at par with other branded fast food chains .

If you're catching a New Empire movie, or are basically in the area for shopping or anything random, hop in for some treats here. It's just a food stand basically, with a few chairs in front to make things convenient. I'd say go for the pan fried momos here......they're just the right amount of spicy!
They have a few other dumplings and Chinese items to try, but it's the momos I found worth it.

Every time when I go to New Empire cinema for a movie or in city mart for shopping I can't resist myself to go there.One of the best(probably the best) place for momo lovers.Chicken pan fried momo with Schezwan Sauce is really the best.You may try their new chocolate momo, it is simply wow!!The only problem is they serve no soups(as I don't like soups personally soo much it is not a problem for me).The place is very tiny also and you are very lucky if you manage a seat.

I  usually visit this place whenever I come to shop in new market area. There  is Dominos, KFC, The Cream and Fudge Factory and Barista Lavazza surrounding this small joint of wow momos, so, many people may overlook it! The space is quite small. They usually serve steam, fried, pan fried momos and thupkas. They sell Chocolate Momos too. There are 5-6chairs kept in a row and  two tall tables. Apart from eating momos, you may find some people here competing to sit and eat (as the chairs are less). Service is very slow. You need to enquire three to four times at the counter about your order before you finally get it. There are only three people managing everything, from preparing the momos to serving, making bills etc. The Chicken Pan Fried Momo in Schezwan Sauce is worth trying here, the Chocolate Momo also comes in the list. If you are done with your shopping and not in a hurry, Wow Momo is worth trying here
