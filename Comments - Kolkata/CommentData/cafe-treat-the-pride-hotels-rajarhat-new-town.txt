This restaurant had an impressive decor, courteous decor and amazing food.
They served an amazing variety of menus with an inclusion of both veg and non veg varieties. Calm, beautiful, well decorated and staffs are the real possessions. Lovely!
Totally in love with its lunch buffet.

Went for the christmas lunch buffet. We had complimentary wine( red or white wine options), and also complimentary beverages and mocktails followed by starters like chicken tandoori kebabs and baby corn fries. 
They had turkey in display with a live station to cook the Roasted turkey with various sauces. 
There was a beautifully decorated salad section with baby octopus and various types of salamis.
For the main course, there were crespelles, biryani, fish steak, roasted lamb, Shanghai noodles, daal tadka, pulao, mushroom Roselles.
For deserts, they had the beautifully decorated croquembouche, with Christmas cakes and pastries.

Went for the dinner buffet, there was a myriad of offerings for the main course, the starters included baby corn and fish fries. All of them, equally poor. I was very dissapointed, specially at that price point! The deserts were good though, the baked roshogolla, ganjorer halwa and the strawberry mousse are excellent. The squid and the octopus are something I cannot comment on, in terms of cooking skills, as I have no benchmark to compare that specific preperation. But what I can say, is that the preperation they offered is not suitable for the Indian palette.

The buffet spread here is quite appealing. The chef has done a great job in composing the menu. The alacarte menu takes a bit of time when you order, whereas of course the buffet is ready to be served. Prices are a bit on the higher side. I hosted a marriage party here and the kitchen and buffet staff made me taste the food before fixating the menu. It was a lovely gesture . 
The service is courteous and fast. Professional behaviour. The taste of the food is slightly tilted on the Bengali palate. But the food quality is excellent.

Location: Near The Axis Mall, Close to "Central" Shopping Plaza.

Pros:
Amazing service. Highly courteous staff.
Right blend of taste.
Pleasant ambience for a family dineout.
Thumbs up for Cleanliness.

Cons:
Can't get any right now.
The prices may be high for few recipes. But that's worth it.

Definitely, looking for the next opportunity.

Went there for a lunch buffet along with 10 other co-workers and unfortunately my experience wasn't good at all. I will not complain about the food because there was something far more important that was amiss. We had bought Nearbuy coupons for the lunch buffet and called to confirm in order to avoid any hassle once we are there. The person attending the call said they will serve only two starters and which will be repeated only once. I found this very unprofessional and demanded to see were the said rule was mentioned. The person was not expecting this and he caved and agreed to serve us in true buffet standards. On reaching there, they took ages to serve the starters. One part of the table had to sit with empty plates for another 15 minutes before they started serving. At a point we felt that they were intentionally doing this in order to avoid repeats. However, lastly one of the managers in our team asked for a started to be repeated and they came up with that weird rule again. I challenged them and said that another staff had agreed to serve us repetitions (I had noted the name of the person who spoke to me over phone) and finally they had to agree with us. 

They should know that quantity is not important but respecting a customer is of utmost importance. In fact, except a few none of us asked for repeats. If only they did not make up this stupid rule, they could have saved themselves and us a bad experience. Even though I liked a couple of items very much, the first thing that I would remember about this place would be the bad experience.

After a lot of discussions with my better half, decided to visit this place to celebrate Bengali New Year. We went for dinner. The Buffet spread looked quite good but didn't taste good at all.
They served two types of Telebhaja as starters - Alu with aamaada and chingri-r chop. Both these preparations were only stuffed with potatoes, no flavor or shrimp.
The Mishti Pulao was steamed rice sprinkled with sugar syrup and miniscule pieces of vegetables. All the vegetable dishes were full of oil.
The non-veg part consisted of Fish Kobiraji, Topshey Fry, Kachalonka Murgi and Mutton Kasha. For the Fish Kobiraji, they used a very bad quality fish - neither bhetki nor basa. Topshey fry was OK but got only 1 piece each, that too, after asking for it, as the buffet palate was empty. Kachalonka Murgi tasted average. For the Mutton Kosha, they gave lamb. 
Salads and Desserts were a plenty. Each one more average than the other.
Final Verdict: Average to bad food, Very High pricing.
In all, it was a real bad decision to visit this place.

Thoroughly disappointed.  This place has everything to be a big spot but the food itself is bland and boring. The staff are courteous and service is great but still that couldnt lift the bland food. Ambience is also good. Went for office party buffet. Salads selection - nothing special.  Non veg has many choices - baked chicken cooked in white sauce (okay, could be better),  seafood ( worst, salty) , murg ghosh (okay). Veg - fried rice, noodles,  veg masala and paneer. Pass. Desserts also didnt have much to choose from - rasmallai ( good),  chocolate cake and kheer (forgot the name).  Okay place. Been here 2 times - has to really revamp their buffet menu.

Starters had just two items and soup. Not very pleasing.
But the main course spread was huge. Chicken Biryani, Mutton Rezala, Pasta, Fried Sea Food, Noodles, Vegetables in Honey, Dhokar Dalna, Paneer & One Fish Item. The cooking and taste was perfect. Really an awesome dining experience.
Desserts had Bengali Sweets, Indian Sweets & Cakes.

Visited this outlet on Friday as part of a sudden plan from the office. Main reason for selecting this place was for an offer available in Near By app. The decor of the place is really good although one of my friend found an uncanny similarity with Yantra, Singapore. We were having the buffet from there. Starter had two items - veg spring roll and fish nuggets and a creamy soup. A little disappointed with the taste and limited options, we proceeded to the main course. To our surprise, the main course had a lot of variety - starting from the salads to quick munch crisps to Indian rice, Pulao, Chicken, Mutton to Noodles and Pan fried fish. The veg options weren't bad either. There was also pasta which tasted good. Deserts had decent variation and wasn't bad either. 
Overall, it wasn't a bad decision to have our lunch there but failed to impress us. House staffs may have been more pro-active and professional.

Located in Pride Hotel, Rajarhat opposite  Axis Mall, Cafe treat is the coffee shop cum multicuisine restaurant. We went in for the lunch buffet option. A la carte menu is also available.

The staff is very attentive and buffet options are quite good.
We started with tomato and roasted pepper soup with a bread basket.
The soup was really yummy and flavourful.
Then we helped ourselves with the fresh fruits and salads . There was a great variety at the salad counter. 
The main course had continental, Chinese and Indian options. 
I had kumbh matar, dahi bhindi, coconut pulao, fusili in cheese sauce with basil, vegetables in hot garlic sauce , hakka noodles, mixed vegetables steamed rice and assorted breads.

The desserts options were Kala gulab jamun, sandesh, chocolate soufle, coconut pie and  strawberry lamington.
I really liked the strawberry lamington.
The meal was great overall. The food was fresh and light on the palate. The servers were really attentive.

Went for a buffet lunch with my colleagues. They preferred Pride to Novotel, as it seems the food Pride serves is fresh... I also had a nice experience . The decor and ambience was fantastic. The buffet was not  too much over the top. A very controlled selection of menu items . The salad bar was so so - nothing extraordinary though. They had small bite size plates of Asian fried rice, some veg/ cheeze pieces as salad. The main course was more elaborate, with a combination of chinese and Indian ( Bengali ) dishes. Taste was very balanced for these dishes, but honestly nothing to remember and create a lasting craving which would draw you back to this place. Dessert selection was mediocre. All in all it is just about OK for something like a 750INR office buffet where you can invite clients , and at a close distance from Rajarhat. But if you are with friends and family then definitely not a top notch choice... The servers were courteous , but I was upset when I was not allowed to take even a few basic pics for review purpose...

Taste was very balanced for these dishes, but honestly nothing to remember and create a lasting craving which would draw you back to this place. Dessert selection was mediocre. All in all it is just about OK for something like a 750INR office buffet where you can invite clients , and at a close distance from Rajarhat. But if you are with friends and family then definitely not a top notch choice... The servers were courteous , but I was upset when I was not allowed to take even a few basic pics for review purpose...

I visited here long back. We had taken a business coupon and used to dine in here frequently till it's validity.

I like dining in here. The ambience is relaxing and soothing. The staffs here were always friendly with us. The food is usually good but certain items needed improvement. Whenever we ordered they asked us to try the cold coffee. On a certain visit I was particular about trying the coffee. It came in a huge long glass which made me excited to have it for sure. 
It tasted bad. I didn't like it at all. 

Cheers for the friendly staff and ambiance.

This place is deceptive and NOT at all recommended for people who want to enjoy good food as nothing is worth mentioning about the items they have in their buffet.

Food: Quality is very poor. Few of the items did not seem fresh. The selection of items were also poor. Only 1 item was served as a started that too not worth mentioning. They boasted of their main course platter but again that came as a huge disappointment as they just worked on increasing number of items but none of the item were worth mentioning.

Service: It was ordinary nothing exceptional. When you complain they just listen and has nothing to offer as a solution.

Ambience: okay

Cost: The buffet costs 999+tax which comes around 1300/- per person. Seriously, at this price you can get a lot better at many other places nearby.

For a foodie this is a NO GO place.

We visited the restaurant yesterday night for our office team party.
And believe me I had the worst experience I have ever had in my life.
This restaurant does not deserve any stars, but I am rating 1, because there is no option to give 0 rating in Zomato. 
Zomato please implement that option too ...thanks
Some of reasons -
1. The cost of buffet is around 1300 - 1400 INR including tax and the quality of food they served should not cost more than 300-400/- INR.
2. First time in my life I have seen a 1300/- rupees buffet have only one veg starter and one non-veg starter. Seriously are you guys joking?
3. The only veg starter was fruit cocktail..hahaha seriously..I want to know the name of the chef who claim this item as veg STARTER..
4. They claimed they have a elaborate main course....either they don't know what elaborate means or they never gone for buffet in a restaurant.
5. The taste and quality of every item was horrible.
There are many more points but the conclusion is don't waste you r money and never visit this restaurant for food.

Actually its been a while since i visited this place, my visits were related entirely to my business travel....having said so, must say this place has got an awesome buffet to boost....the menu is menacingly huge & had a lot of variety ranging from north and south Indian to thai, chinese, continental et all....the price is quite high but then given the ambience, quality, service, location, aesthetics and overall scheme of things, didn't mind it.....a buffet dinner for a couple excluding drinks could set you back by 4k....but i guess it is still worth it....

I would not recommend this place. As much as the outsides can be deceptive, nothing inside this place is good enough for mentioning.

When you visit a 5 star restro for lunch, you carry high expectation- Cafe Treat under delivers.

Nothing was worth mentioning except the layout of the buffet. Neatly decorated, but not so good at taste. no starters - you only get soup which was very sweet, to my dismay. The main course only had 2 good items on chicken and paneer. The mushrooms needed more flavour. There was no fish. The mutton was too spicy and the Biriyani was kind of bland.
The dessert had two good dishes - baked rasgullas with malai and the custard.
I think they need to improve on their menu as there are plenty of alternatives in and around the area which provide better food at cheaper rates.

Opted for this place when I was staying at the Pride hotel. The room service served me Bengali mutton curry and jeera rice, which was a little less spicy but decent. The buffet spread is ok at best on a Sunday. But the staff is cordial and friendly. Had an interaction with the chef which was nice.

Cafe treat is a pretty forgettable place.
Neither food nor the ambience is worth revisiting.To me, the place was dull!
If you have been having buffet at places like flame and grill,bbq nation,mainland china etc etc then the number of dishes in the buffet menu will dissapoint you.
Starters had 1 chicken dish and one veg dish probably spring roll.
After being disspointed by the starters menu I started having the main course . Amazingly I loved the chicken and fish curry.
In desserts they had this mango chomchom.It was greattt!
Price is on the higher side.
I'm giving it 3.5 mainly because of the food quality.

An okay place to dine.
In fact a better place if you are planning to stay away from the regular restaurant chores and chaos. 
Though you cannot call it fine dining, yet you will feel at ease and happy when you reach Cafe Treat. They have a wide range and variety of menu in the buffet stand.
You would want to pay a visit to Cafe Treat if:

(A)
1. You want to stay away from city chores
2. Want to check out a star property restaurant which isnt that expensive

(B)
Decor: Regular. Just like other restaurants inside hotel properties.
Staff: Little confused. Response time was pretty much on the higher side. It took them almost 25 minutes to serve us the cheque after we had asked for it.
Food: They have a wide variety of desserts. Taste-wise food was decent.
Music: Nothing significant.

Positive Points:

1. Inexpensive "star" dining.
2. Food tastes good. 

Negative Points:

1. I could not find even one mutton item in the buffet.
2. People eating in the restaurant are majorly corporate guests staying in the hotel (and eating like there's no tomorrow as the bills are reimbursable:D ). So if you are little "class-specific" (read elitist), you would definitely not like the crowd.
3. They just have 1 veg and 1 non veg starter for the buffet.
4. Response time of the staff is really high. High enough to bore you.

Good place for a first date: Well whatever! Your choice.
Second Visit: Umm....may be. (only because I'm located nearby Pride)

Recently tried a buffet at Cafe Treat, and although the food was decent, I felt the overall experience was a bit lacking.

Cafe Treat is the all day dining area of Pride Hotel. The place feels spacious but the idea behind decor does not seem consistent making it look contemporary at places and old school at others. However the staff service is just about decent. Plus they do not provide finger bowls which was another let down.

Coming to food, I loved their north India main course which was exceptional and dinner rolls. Otherwise the desserts, continental and oriental  preparations were pretty average. The options in salads were pretty limited and very ordinary. The items I particularly liked were the black daal served in small earthen bowl, paneer kofta and aloo dum.

Overall I felt that the rates here are pretty reasonable yet the overall feel needs to improve !!

Cafe Treat is a beautiful restaurant open 24 hours inside the Pride Hotel in Newtown. I've tried their breakfast & lunch buffets and both were surprisingly good & value for money. As you'd expect from a hotel the service is outstanding. This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated restaurants in the city but as Newtown develops into a city of it's own I'm sure their popularity would go up.

Situated just opposite to the axis mall rajarhat newtown, this place is doing well with their food. The interor is super fine as it maintains its 4 star hotel standard. The buffet quality is good but it do not have many choices over chicken or mutton items, neither on starter. There is a wide variety on deserts and really they taste good. 
Ambience wall beyond any comparison, staffs were carrying, overall I enjoyed my visit there.

I visited Cafe Treat inside The Pride Hotel in New Town (bang opposite Novotel) for a Buffet Breakfast.
The Breakfast spread was so filling, consisting of a mix of both Indian and Continental.
4 types of fresh cut fruits, 4 types of juices including Buttermilk, 2 types of flavoured yoghurt (did not like the taste, was tasting too sour), 5 types of rolls with breads, Cereals including Corn Flakes and Muesli with Milk of choice was spread. 
South Indian spread consisted of a Vada and Idly with the regular chutneys. I avoided eating them.
Indian spread also had Luchi and Sabji for those interested.
Baked beans and Made-to-order Omlettes were awesome. I specially liked the Cheese omlette.
Non-Veg items included Chicken Sausages and Fish stew. Both were just awesome and tasty. I got myself filled with these two to my hearts content.
Finally, the dessert section left me disappointed. Only option was a Balu Shahi.
Generous helpings of Tea and Coffee of choice was also available.
Overall experience was good. Would recommend for every foodie.

Have visited this restaurant twice. The first time was for dinner. Last time, for lunch. The lunch buffet spread is better than the dinner. Food variety needs improvement. Tastes good and is obviously hygienic. The staff behavior and  frequent follow ups enriches your experience. 
Ambiance is good. 
The main course should include a few more non-veg options other than chicken.Special mention- excellent dessert spread. Basil flavored Yogurts find a special mention.

Well i didn't actually went to dine, but i was staying there and ordered room service from this restaurant. I am addicted to their dal makhani and butter chicken. I just can't stop bragging about it. Just out of the world. Had buffet breakfast too which was just about average. I can't understand with their fixation with south indian breakfast, i wish they had more continental breakfast options there. Not much of a fan of sambar wada or upma to start my mornings. Missed boiled eggs terribly which shoul've been there.nonetheless, a good experience overall. The hotel doesn't look much appealing to me from the outside but is pretty sleek from the inside.

I am not sure if it is a 5 star property or not..however, the outside getup of this hotel is very deceptive...once u get in there u wd start to expect a lot but eventually when it comes to food (thats what for we visit restaurants), its very annoying..they charge atound 900 bucks for a buffet in which they dont provide mutton dishes. Only good part is the continental but cmon, u definitely want more in a 5 star property won't you!! The courtesy and behavior of the staffs were really commendable...in fact that's one of the reason i put a 3.5 rating for this place..however, i feel that there is scope of improvement a lot if management wish to and then definitely it would be a must drop in place for foodies..

Went there for a buffet lunch on sunday
The spread was very limited, there were hardly any deserts or drinks to offer, the service quality was really bad. Out of the dishes a few were good,but it was highly frustrating that one couldnt get a second serving because of short supply.As far as my knowledge of a buffet is concerned I believe one can have anything in whatever quantity he pleases, but it was proved wrong today.
Most of the platters on display took very long time to be refilled once empty and the staff were indifferent to this problem of ours.
There were only two rotis on the menu which was surprising beacuse other places of the same category offer a much diverse spread and a better quality of service.
The mouth freshners were the only thing that had variety.
I am absolutely disgusted with this place and would urge others to think twice before going to such a hopeless,overrated place.

It is pretty decent. We went for non veg buffet dinner from office. The options were limited, just 2 non veg options in main course. Taste was ok and the presentation was superb. The fried fish and pasta were good. Menu had a mix n match of bengali and continental which did not go down too well with my colleagues. I really liked the ambience as it is very chilled out. Good way to spend your weekend evening. It seemed to me that the menu could have been better planned.

I have been to this place a couple of times only and I liked it a lot. There are something's great about Cafe Treat and I'd start with the ambiance. It's bright and very spacious with perfectly aligned tables and appropriate gaps in between. The food is quite nice considering the price tag attached to it. It's a perfect place for a family get together or for a bunch of friends and even couples looking for a fine place to sit. The menu offers a large varieties of Indian, Italian, Continental and Asian cuisine. It's the best place for those wanting to get out of the crowded city roads and want a peaceful and relaxed meal at any time of the day.

The buffet at the place is rich with many options and though it's not cheap, I'd still prefer it to those looking for some perfection. It's a great place for conducting office group lunch or dinner too.

All in all, one can expect to spend around 1500 to 1800 for two.

I was here on a office party. We tried the Non-Veg Dinner Buffet.

The starters were served on the table. But it felt like the waiters only wanted to serve you the kebabs once. Also the starters were being served really late.

The main course and the desserts were very good. And the décor is also very impressive.

I do not understand why buffet breakfast in India, and that too in kolkata, have to have idlis and vadas! Had been here for a buffet breakfast this month and then had a terrible experience. The food was not that bad, but I am not going back there as long as I have other options.

Firstly, there was some marwari marriage, and a large portion of the hotel was booked by them. My luck!!! The breakfast spread had only vegetarian food that day (on instructions from their large contingent of marwari guests). Idlis, dosas, vadas, puris, and more idlis, more dosas, more vadas... Why would I choose an upscale restaurant to have my idlys and puris? Kolkata is famous for its cheap street food.

Apparently, non veg food was part of the buffet but only if ordered. But no one from the staff member explained that to us - later we just had enough time to order some omlettes and a few sausages. So overall not a great experience and definitely not value for money.

And then, there were people who were keep taking the cutleries from our table for their own use. And there was no staff members to assist us by stopping this intrusion to our privacy. We left aghast and vowing not to come to this place again.

I.T. canteen menus have been proven to induce acute lethargy at the office. My doctors recommend a regular intake of stimulating food washed down with some great drinks. Today I follow my doctor's orders with wonderful breakfast in The Pride Hotel. Cafe Treat is a swanky coffee shop located in one of the best 5-star property in Kolkata – The Pride Hotel. Mood lighting and various creative seating arrangements come together to form a distinct atmosphere. They were serving a vast variety of buffet menu i.e. Fresh Orange Juice, Fresh Watermelon Juice, Fresh Pineapple Juice, Canned Juice, Strawberry Buttermilk, Choice of Fresh Cut Fruits (4 Types), Coffee, Tea, Corn Flakes/ Chocos /Wheat Flakes/ Muesli with Hot Milk /Cold Milk, Oatmeal addition of flavours, 5 Kinds of Breakfast Rolls, Slice Bread Brown, White & homemade Multi Grain, Plain Curd, Flavoured Yogurt, Dry Fruits (2 Types), Grilled Tomato, Grilled Potato, Chicken Sausages variation with Sauces, Luchi, Bhatura, Strawberry Pancake, Beans Preparation, South Indian Veg Preparation, South Indian Vada, Idly with variation of Sambar and Chutney, Waffle, Pancake with Maple & Honey, and in Live Counter they were serving different kinds of Omelettes. We enter the restaurant at 7.30 am and I was very hungry.  I tried all their juices and milkshakes to start with, among them I found Strawberry Buttermilk & Pineapple Juice very tasty and natural, Watermelon & Orange juice just above average. After that I tried Triple Egg Masala Cheese Omelette fried in olive oil & Grilled Chicken Sausages. Masala Cheese Omelette tasted great, cheese inside the omelette giving my mouth a joy ride. About Chicken Sausages, there was nothing new to say. Then I tried 4 kinds of Breakfast Rolls with coffee and found them excellent. Twin Egg Spanish Omelette was also awesome. Chocos with Hot Milk tasted as usual. Now coming to the desert part, I was surprised seeing ‘Hot Mihidana’ & ‘Lobongo Lotika’, traditional Bengali sweets.  Hot Mihidana was very smooth & testy, unbelievably good.  Lobongo Lotika was actually dessert of the day, its crisp on the outside and yet so soft on the inside. I never thought that I would have gotten so excited over Lobongo Lotika. In the end we tried Strawberry Yogurt, Kesar Yogurt and Butterscotch Yogurt; we found them interesting as they tested different from regular ones. After three and half hour of continues eating we concluded that breakfast was very good, filling and delicious. The wide gastronomic choice of cuisines from across continents backed by personalized service set the tone for a dining experience – a benchmark of The Pride brand of hospitality.

I must confess that this is not a review of the Cafe Treat directly but an overall experience with the Pride Hotel. I guess that counts as it will essentially provide you with a dash of what to expect.

From the outside, the Pride Hotel seemed to be a building with sudden financial crunch and a never-ending maintenance story. However, when I talked to one of their managers, I realized that what we know as the Pride Hotel is actually a corporate building maintained by a third party, and the Pride Hotel has bought the ground, and few floors for the business. So, when we snigger at the look of the pathetic exterior of the building, the Pride Hotel is not to blame. This also attributed to a confusing entry of the cars if you are the first timer here.

We went there for a corporate lunch in one of their banquet halls. The reception was well decorated and spacious. The banquet was large with great looking chandeliers and space. I liked the decor. The manager-in-charge for the banquet was quite friendly.

The buffet lunch had three salads - tossed salad, German potato salad, and grilled veg salad. None of the salads made up to the mark. The tossed salad was too bland, there were no surprises in the grilled veg salad, and the German potato salad was a bowl of cubed potatoes garnished pepper and herbs and surrounded by sliced tomatoes. I probably missed the German part in that salad.

The cream of mushroom soup was good. I expected it to be good. It is a simple and no-surprise recipe. The veg selections with jeera aloo, shahi paneer and bhindi do piyaza were very good in taste. The jeera aloo was well cooked, moist, soft, and without the bitterness of the jeera. The paneer was fresh with a thick gravy. The bhindi do piyaza was tangy but not spicy, exactly what we wanted.

In the non-veg selection, the machhi nargisi kofta tasted good but the kofta resembled like egg devil in sauce. I never had this particular dish before so cannot comment on the authenticity of it. The machhi quotient was inexistent or probably overpowered due to the strong spices. The murg in tamatar was a subtle sweet and sour chicken in a rich gravy. It tasted good.

The semolina pudding was strong textured, chewy sort of dessert that I never had before. It tasted ok. For the lemon cheese cake, I did not expect the soft white cheese. It felt more like lemon cheese pastry compared to a cake. The taste was again ok.

So, it is 3.5. I was inclined for a 3.0 but the ambiance, support staff, and banquet managers made a lot of effort and we can give a grace for that. I heard that the place has a good buffet spread for lunch and dinner, and package deals in their bars as well. So, give this place a try, decide for yourself.

A 4 star hotel, fit to have a negative star rating.

1. The lobby and the rrstaurant is swarming with mosquitoes.

2. Frantic periodic calls to the waiter to fill water in ur glass is required

3. The menu mentions a brownie with ice cream, but they wont give u the ice cream without u asking for it.

4. Neither do they give u proper cutlery, nor does ur dinner plate match with the others on the table.

5. Pathetic service and attitude of staff

Go to this hotel only if u want to b grounded after a good day :p



----- 15 Feb, 2014 -----

Pathetic service, pathetic food, and more pathetic mosquitoes. Avoid this hotel.

I visited this place for dinner tonight with a few of my office colleagues. We opted for the buffet dinner and must say it was quite mediocre for the price they charged. First, there were just 2 choices for starters - 1 veg and 1 non veg - and the shocking part was that it was not unlimited contrary to the basic concept of a buffet! They just served two plates each with meagre quantity. The main buffet menu was very haphazard with no coherence among the items. The best items were the daal and parwal - its a shame that we liked only the items which we already eat at home :) Dessert was fine but nothing to die for.
In short, won't visit this place anytime soon.

Went for the christmas lunch buffet. We had complimentary wine( red or white wine options), and also complimentary beverages and mocktails followed by starters like chicken tandoori kebabs and baby corn fries. 
They had turkey in display with a live station to cook the Roasted turkey with various sauces. 
There was a beautifully decorated salad section with baby octopus and various types of salamis.
For the main course, there were crespelles, biryani, fish steak, roasted lamb, Shanghai noodles, daal tadka, pulao, mushroom Roselles.
For deserts, they had the beautifully decorated croquembouche, with Christmas cakes and pastries.

Went for the dinner buffet, there was a myriad of offerings for the main course, the starters included baby corn and fish fries. All of them, equally poor. I was very dissapointed, specially at that price point! The deserts were good though, the baked roshogolla, ganjorer halwa and the strawberry mousse are excellent. The squid and the octopus are something I cannot comment on, in terms of cooking skills, as I have no benchmark to compare that specific preperation. But what I can say, is that the preperation they offered is not suitable for the Indian palette.

The buffet spread here is quite appealing. The chef has done a great job in composing the menu. The alacarte menu takes a bit of time when you order, whereas of course the buffet is ready to be served. Prices are a bit on the higher side. I hosted a marriage party here and the kitchen and buffet staff made me taste the food before fixating the menu. It was a lovely gesture . 
The service is courteous and fast. Professional behaviour. The taste of the food is slightly tilted on the Bengali palate. But the food quality is excellent.

Went there for a lunch buffet along with 10 other co-workers and unfortunately my experience wasn't good at all. I will not complain about the food because there was something far more important that was amiss. We had bought Nearbuy coupons for the lunch buffet and called to confirm in order to avoid any hassle once we are there. The person attending the call said they will serve only two starters and which will be repeated only once. I found this very unprofessional and demanded to see were the said rule was mentioned. The person was not expecting this and he caved and agreed to serve us in true buffet standards. On reaching there, they took ages to serve the starters. One part of the table had to sit with empty plates for another 15 minutes before they started serving. At a point we felt that they were intentionally doing this in order to avoid repeats. However, lastly one of the managers in our team asked for a started to be repeated and they came up with that weird rule again. I challenged them and said that another staff had agreed to serve us repetitions (I had noted the name of the person who spoke to me over phone) and finally they had to agree with us. 

They should know that quantity is not important but respecting a customer is of utmost importance. In fact, except a few none of us asked for repeats. If only they did not make up this stupid rule, they could have saved themselves and us a bad experience. Even though I liked a couple of items very much, the first thing that I would remember about this place would be the bad experience.

After a lot of discussions with my better half, decided to visit this place to celebrate Bengali New Year. We went for dinner. The Buffet spread looked quite good but didn't taste good at all.
They served two types of Telebhaja as starters - Alu with aamaada and chingri-r chop. Both these preparations were only stuffed with potatoes, no flavor or shrimp.
The Mishti Pulao was steamed rice sprinkled with sugar syrup and miniscule pieces of vegetables. All the vegetable dishes were full of oil.
The non-veg part consisted of Fish Kobiraji, Topshey Fry, Kachalonka Murgi and Mutton Kasha. For the Fish Kobiraji, they used a very bad quality fish - neither bhetki nor basa. Topshey fry was OK but got only 1 piece each, that too, after asking for it, as the buffet palate was empty. Kachalonka Murgi tasted average. For the Mutton Kosha, they gave lamb. 
Salads and Desserts were a plenty. Each one more average than the other.
Final Verdict: Average to bad food, Very High pricing.
In all, it was a real bad decision to visit this place.

Thoroughly disappointed.  This place has everything to be a big spot but the food itself is bland and boring. The staff are courteous and service is great but still that couldnt lift the bland food. Ambience is also good. Went for office party buffet. Salads selection - nothing special.  Non veg has many choices - baked chicken cooked in white sauce (okay, could be better),  seafood ( worst, salty) , murg ghosh (okay). Veg - fried rice, noodles,  veg masala and paneer. Pass. Desserts also didnt have much to choose from - rasmallai ( good),  chocolate cake and kheer (forgot the name).  Okay place. Been here 2 times - has to really revamp their buffet menu.

Starters had just two items and soup. Not very pleasing.
But the main course spread was huge. Chicken Biryani, Mutton Rezala, Pasta, Fried Sea Food, Noodles, Vegetables in Honey, Dhokar Dalna, Paneer & One Fish Item. The cooking and taste was perfect. Really an awesome dining experience.

Extremely bad hospitality... The waiters doesn't seem to bother about the guests... If you ask something from the waiters they take ages to bring the stuff... And they seem to be busy uselessly....

Food is good and buffet choices are nice.

I would have given the rating of 4 if the waiters knew how to make the guests feel special....

Visited this outlet on Friday as part of a sudden plan from the office. Main reason for selecting this place was for an offer available in Near By app. The decor of the place is really good although one of my friend found an uncanny similarity with Yantra, Singapore. We were having the buffet from there. Starter had two items - veg spring roll and fish nuggets and a creamy soup. A little disappointed with the taste and limited options, we proceeded to the main course. To our surprise, the main course had a lot of variety - starting from the salads to quick munch crisps to Indian rice, Pulao, Chicken, Mutton to Noodles and Pan fried fish. The veg options weren't bad either. There was also pasta which tasted good. Deserts had decent variation and wasn't bad either. 
Overall, it wasn't a bad decision to have our lunch there but failed to impress us. House staffs may have been more pro-active and professional.

Located in Pride Hotel, Rajarhat opposite  Axis Mall, Cafe treat is the coffee shop cum multicuisine restaurant. We went in for the lunch buffet option. A la carte menu is also available.

The staff is very attentive and buffet options are quite good.
We started with tomato and roasted pepper soup with a bread basket.
The soup was really yummy and flavourful.
Then we helped ourselves with the fresh fruits and salads . There was a great variety at the salad counter. 
The main course had continental, Chinese and Indian options. 
I had kumbh matar, dahi bhindi, coconut pulao, fusili in cheese sauce with basil, vegetables in hot garlic sauce , hakka noodles, mixed vegetables steamed rice and assorted breads.

The desserts options were Kala gulab jamun, sandesh, chocolate soufle, coconut pie and  strawberry lamington.
I really liked the strawberry lamington.
The meal was great overall. The food was fresh and light on the palate. The servers were really attentive.

The food on the other hand is VERY MINIMAL and AVERAGE for the price.
Non Veg Buffet is a bummer!
The dishes are practically okayish.
Variety is JUST ABSENT.
And the waiter assigned annoyed us further because we put a bad review on their feedback form and asked us to change it. Ugh !

I'm not coming back for the shitty pricey  buffet here !

Visited this restaurant with family some time back. Décor, ambiance and service were fine as far as a star hotel property goes. Food was good too, though don't exactly remember the items in detail. Named Cafe Treat, the treat in which we'd indulged here had been worthwhile and commendable, perhaps not the best but kind of okay.

Went for a buffet lunch with my colleagues. They preferred Pride to Novotel, as it seems the food Pride serves is fresh... I also had a nice experience . The decor and ambience was fantastic. The buffet was not  too much over the top. A very controlled selection of menu items . The salad bar was so so - nothing extraordinary though. They had small bite size plates of Asian fried rice, some veg/ cheeze pieces as salad. The main course was more elaborate, with a combination of chinese and Indian ( Bengali ) dishes. Taste was very balanced for these dishes, but honestly nothing to remember and create a lasting craving which would draw you back to this place. Dessert selection was mediocre. All in all it is just about OK for something like a 750INR office buffet where you can invite clients , and at a close distance from Rajarhat. But if you are with friends and family then definitely not a top notch choice... The servers were courteous , but I was upset when I was not allowed to take even a few basic pics for review purpose...

I visited here long back. We had taken a business coupon and used to dine in here frequently till it's validity.

I like dining in here. The ambience is relaxing and soothing. The staffs here were always friendly with us. The food is usually good but certain items needed improvement. Whenever we ordered they asked us to try the cold coffee. On a certain visit I was particular about trying the coffee. It came in a huge long glass which made me excited to have it for sure. 
It tasted bad. I didn't like it at all. 

Cheers for the friendly staff and ambiance.

This place is deceptive and NOT at all recommended for people who want to enjoy good food as nothing is worth mentioning about the items they have in their buffet.

Food: Quality is very poor. Few of the items did not seem fresh. The selection of items were also poor. Only 1 item was served as a started that too not worth mentioning. They boasted of their main course platter but again that came as a huge disappointment as they just worked on increasing number of items but none of the item were worth mentioning.

Service: It was ordinary nothing exceptional. When you complain they just listen and has nothing to offer as a solution.

Ambience: okay

Cost: The buffet costs 999+tax which comes around 1300/- per person. Seriously, at this price you can get a lot better at many other places nearby.

For a foodie this is a NO GO place.

We visited the restaurant yesterday night for our office team party.
And believe me I had the worst experience I have ever had in my life.
This restaurant does not deserve any stars, but I am rating 1, because there is no option to give 0 rating in Zomato. 
Zomato please implement that option too ...thanks
Some of reasons -
1. The cost of buffet is around 1300 - 1400 INR including tax and the quality of food they served should not cost more than 300-400/- INR.
2. First time in my life I have seen a 1300/- rupees buffet have only one veg starter and one non-veg starter. Seriously are you guys joking?
3. The only veg starter was fruit cocktail..hahaha seriously..I want to know the name of the chef who claim this item as veg STARTER..
4. They claimed they have a elaborate main course....either they don't know what elaborate means or they never gone for buffet in a restaurant.
5. The taste and quality of every item was horrible.
There are many more points but the conclusion is don't waste you r money and never visit this restaurant for food.

I would not recommend this place. As much as the outsides can be deceptive, nothing inside this place is good enough for mentioning.

When you visit a 5 star restro for lunch, you carry high expectation- Cafe Treat under delivers.

Nothing was worth mentioning except the layout of the buffet. Neatly decorated, but not so good at taste. no starters - you only get soup which was very sweet, to my dismay. The main course only had 2 good items on chicken and paneer. The mushrooms needed more flavour. There was no fish. The mutton was too spicy and the Biriyani was kind of bland.
The dessert had two good dishes - baked rasgullas with malai and the custard.
I think they need to improve on their menu as there are plenty of alternatives in and around the area which provide better food at cheaper rates.

Cafe treat is a pretty forgettable place.
Neither food nor the ambience is worth revisiting.To me, the place was dull!
If you have been having buffet at places like flame and grill,bbq nation,mainland china etc etc then the number of dishes in the buffet menu will dissapoint you.
Starters had 1 chicken dish and one veg dish probably spring roll.
After being disspointed by the starters menu I started having the main course . Amazingly I loved the chicken and fish curry.
In desserts they had this mango chomchom.It was greattt!
Price is on the higher side.
I'm giving it 3.5 mainly because of the food quality.

An okay place to dine.
In fact a better place if you are planning to stay away from the regular restaurant chores and chaos. 
Though you cannot call it fine dining, yet you will feel at ease and happy when you reach Cafe Treat. They have a wide range and variety of menu in the buffet stand.
You would want to pay a visit to Cafe Treat if:

(A)
1. You want to stay away from city chores
2. Want to check out a star property restaurant which isnt that expensive

(B)
Decor: Regular. Just like other restaurants inside hotel properties.
Staff: Little confused. Response time was pretty much on the higher side. It took them almost 25 minutes to serve us the cheque after we had asked for it.
Food: They have a wide variety of desserts. Taste-wise food was decent.
Music: Nothing significant.

Positive Points:

1. Inexpensive "star" dining.
2. Food tastes good. 

Negative Points:

1. I could not find even one mutton item in the buffet.
2. People eating in the restaurant are majorly corporate guests staying in the hotel (and eating like there's no tomorrow as the bills are reimbursable:D ). So if you are little "class-specific" (read elitist), you would definitely not like the crowd.
3. They just have 1 veg and 1 non veg starter for the buffet.
4. Response time of the staff is really high. High enough to bore you.

Good place for a first date: Well whatever! Your choice.
Second Visit: Umm....may be. (only because I'm located nearby Pride)

Recently tried a buffet at Cafe Treat, and although the food was decent, I felt the overall experience was a bit lacking.

Cafe Treat is the all day dining area of Pride Hotel. The place feels spacious but the idea behind decor does not seem consistent making it look contemporary at places and old school at others. However the staff service is just about decent. Plus they do not provide finger bowls which was another let down.

Coming to food, I loved their north India main course which was exceptional and dinner rolls. Otherwise the desserts, continental and oriental  preparations were pretty average. The options in salads were pretty limited and very ordinary. The items I particularly liked were the black daal served in small earthen bowl, paneer kofta and aloo dum.

Overall I felt that the rates here are pretty reasonable yet the overall feel needs to improve !!

Cafe Treat is a beautiful restaurant open 24 hours inside the Pride Hotel in Newtown. I've tried their breakfast & lunch buffets and both were surprisingly good & value for money. As you'd expect from a hotel the service is outstanding. This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated restaurants in the city but as Newtown develops into a city of it's own I'm sure their popularity would go up.

Situated just opposite to the axis mall rajarhat newtown, this place is doing well with their food. The interor is super fine as it maintains its 4 star hotel standard. The buffet quality is good but it do not have many choices over chicken or mutton items, neither on starter. There is a wide variety on deserts and really they taste good. 
Ambience wall beyond any comparison, staffs were carrying, overall I enjoyed my visit there.

The Breakfast spread was so filling, consisting of a mix of both Indian and Continental.
4 types of fresh cut fruits, 4 types of juices including Buttermilk, 2 types of flavoured yoghurt (did not like the taste, was tasting too sour), 5 types of rolls with breads, Cereals including Corn Flakes and Muesli with Milk of choice was spread. 
South Indian spread consisted of a Vada and Idly with the regular chutneys. I avoided eating them.
Indian spread also had Luchi and Sabji for those interested.
Baked beans and Made-to-order Omlettes were awesome. I specially liked the Cheese omlette.
Non-Veg items included Chicken Sausages and Fish stew. Both were just awesome and tasty. I got myself filled with these two to my hearts content.
Finally, the dessert section left me disappointed. Only option was a Balu Shahi.
Generous helpings of Tea and Coffee of choice was also available.
Overall experience was good. Would recommend for every foodie.

Have visited this restaurant twice. The first time was for dinner. Last time, for lunch. The lunch buffet spread is better than the dinner. Food variety needs improvement. Tastes good and is obviously hygienic. The staff behavior and  frequent follow ups enriches your experience. 
Ambiance is good. 
The main course should include a few more non-veg options other than chicken.Special mention- excellent dessert spread. Basil flavored Yogurts find a special mention.

Situated just opposite to the axis mall rajarhat newtown, this place is doing well with their food. The interor is super fine as it maintains its 4 star hotel standard. The buffet quality is good but it do not have many choices over chicken or mutton items, neither on starter. There is a wide variety on deserts and really they taste good. 
Ambience wall beyond any comparison, staffs were carrying, overall I enjoyed my visit there.

Have been to this place twice, with the expectation of a better turnout for the later time, though in vain. Though it has the tag to its name of a premium service but the food is average quality. Hoping for a better result, the next time i turn up luckily.

Well i didn't actually went to dine, but i was staying there and ordered room service from this restaurant. I am addicted to their dal makhani and butter chicken. I just can't stop bragging about it. Just out of the world. Had buffet breakfast too which was just about average. I can't understand with their fixation with south indian breakfast, i wish they had more continental breakfast options there. Not much of a fan of sambar wada or upma to start my mornings. Missed boiled eggs terribly which shoul've been there.nonetheless, a good experience overall. The hotel doesn't look much appealing to me from the outside but is pretty sleek from the inside.

I am not sure if it is a 5 star property or not..however, the outside getup of this hotel is very deceptive...once u get in there u wd start to expect a lot but eventually when it comes to food (thats what for we visit restaurants), its very annoying..they charge atound 900 bucks for a buffet in which they dont provide mutton dishes. Only good part is the continental but cmon, u definitely want more in a 5 star property won't you!! The courtesy and behavior of the staffs were really commendable...in fact that's one of the reason i put a 3.5 rating for this place..however, i feel that there is scope of improvement a lot if management wish to and then definitely it would be a must drop in place for foodies..

Went there for a buffet lunch on sunday
The spread was very limited, there were hardly any deserts or drinks to offer, the service quality was really bad. Out of the dishes a few were good,but it was highly frustrating that one couldnt get a second serving because of short supply.As far as my knowledge of a buffet is concerned I believe one can have anything in whatever quantity he pleases, but it was proved wrong today.
Most of the platters on display took very long time to be refilled once empty and the staff were indifferent to this problem of ours.
There were only two rotis on the menu which was surprising beacuse other places of the same category offer a much diverse spread and a better quality of service.
The mouth freshners were the only thing that had variety.
I am absolutely disgusted with this place and would urge others to think twice before going to such a hopeless,overrated place.

It is pretty decent. We went for non veg buffet dinner from office. The options were limited, just 2 non veg options in main course. Taste was ok and the presentation was superb. The fried fish and pasta were good. Menu had a mix n match of bengali and continental which did not go down too well with my colleagues. I really liked the ambience as it is very chilled out. Good way to spend your weekend evening. It seemed to me that the menu could have been better planned.

I have been to this place a couple of times only and I liked it a lot. There are something's great about Cafe Treat and I'd start with the ambiance. It's bright and very spacious with perfectly aligned tables and appropriate gaps in between. The food is quite nice considering the price tag attached to it. It's a perfect place for a family get together or for a bunch of friends and even couples looking for a fine place to sit. The menu offers a large varieties of Indian, Italian, Continental and Asian cuisine. It's the best place for those wanting to get out of the crowded city roads and want a peaceful and relaxed meal at any time of the day.

The buffet at the place is rich with many options and though it's not cheap, I'd still prefer it to those looking for some perfection. It's a great place for conducting office group lunch or dinner too.

All in all, one can expect to spend around 1500 to 1800 for two.

Decent place!! The ambience is really great and best for official dinners. 

The food was decent too. Had a  variety in menu. I would have been very happy if there could have been a soft liquid appetizer and icecreams to finish with.

Overall a very nice experience. Will surely visit again soon.

Decent!

I was here on a office party. We tried the Non-Veg Dinner Buffet.

The starters were served on the table. But it felt like the waiters only wanted to serve you the kebabs once. Also the starters were being served really late.

The main course and the desserts were very good. And the décor is also very impressive.

The food at cafe treat is decent though nothing great. I don't quite like their menu. The Chinese is good. I tried their pesto pasta which is a not commonly available item. While it was very creamy, I didn't like the taste of their pesto sauce. Overall I would go there when I don't have other options.

I do not understand why buffet breakfast in India, and that too in kolkata, have to have idlis and vadas! Had been here for a buffet breakfast this month and then had a terrible experience. The food was not that bad, but I am not going back there as long as I have other options.

Firstly, there was some marwari marriage, and a large portion of the hotel was booked by them. My luck!!! The breakfast spread had only vegetarian food that day (on instructions from their large contingent of marwari guests). Idlis, dosas, vadas, puris, and more idlis, more dosas, more vadas... Why would I choose an upscale restaurant to have my idlys and puris? Kolkata is famous for its cheap street food.

Apparently, non veg food was part of the buffet but only if ordered. But no one from the staff member explained that to us - later we just had enough time to order some omlettes and a few sausages. So overall not a great experience and definitely not value for money.

And then, there were people who were keep taking the cutleries from our table for their own use. And there was no staff members to assist us by stopping this intrusion to our privacy. We left aghast and vowing not to come to this place again.

I.T. canteen menus have been proven to induce acute lethargy at the office. My doctors recommend a regular intake of stimulating food washed down with some great drinks. Today I follow my doctor's orders with wonderful breakfast in The Pride Hotel. Cafe Treat is a swanky coffee shop located in one of the best 5-star property in Kolkata – The Pride Hotel. Mood lighting and various creative seating arrangements come together to form a distinct atmosphere. They were serving a vast variety of buffet menu i.e. Fresh Orange Juice, Fresh Watermelon Juice, Fresh Pineapple Juice, Canned Juice, Strawberry Buttermilk, Choice of Fresh Cut Fruits (4 Types), Coffee, Tea, Corn Flakes/ Chocos /Wheat Flakes/ Muesli with Hot Milk /Cold Milk, Oatmeal addition of flavours, 5 Kinds of Breakfast Rolls, Slice Bread Brown, White & homemade Multi Grain, Plain Curd, Flavoured Yogurt, Dry Fruits (2 Types), Grilled Tomato, Grilled Potato, Chicken Sausages variation with Sauces, Luchi, Bhatura, Strawberry Pancake, Beans Preparation, South Indian Veg Preparation, South Indian Vada, Idly with variation of Sambar and Chutney, Waffle, Pancake with Maple & Honey, and in Live Counter they were serving different kinds of Omelettes. We enter the restaurant at 7.30 am and I was very hungry.  I tried all their juices and milkshakes to start with, among them I found Strawberry Buttermilk & Pineapple Juice very tasty and natural, Watermelon & Orange juice just above average. After that I tried Triple Egg Masala Cheese Omelette fried in olive oil & Grilled Chicken Sausages. Masala Cheese Omelette tasted great, cheese inside the omelette giving my mouth a joy ride. About Chicken Sausages, there was nothing new to say. Then I tried 4 kinds of Breakfast Rolls with coffee and found them excellent. Twin Egg Spanish Omelette was also awesome. Chocos with Hot Milk tasted as usual. Now coming to the desert part, I was surprised seeing ‘Hot Mihidana’ & ‘Lobongo Lotika’, traditional Bengali sweets.  Hot Mihidana was very smooth & testy, unbelievably good.  Lobongo Lotika was actually dessert of the day, its crisp on the outside and yet so soft on the inside. I never thought that I would have gotten so excited over Lobongo Lotika. In the end we tried Strawberry Yogurt, Kesar Yogurt and Butterscotch Yogurt; we found them interesting as they tested different from regular ones. After three and half hour of continues eating we concluded that breakfast was very good, filling and delicious. The wide gastronomic choice of cuisines from across continents backed by personalized service set the tone for a dining experience – a benchmark of The Pride brand of hospitality.

I must confess that this is not a review of the Cafe Treat directly but an overall experience with the Pride Hotel. I guess that counts as it will essentially provide you with a dash of what to expect.

From the outside, the Pride Hotel seemed to be a building with sudden financial crunch and a never-ending maintenance story. However, when I talked to one of their managers, I realized that what we know as the Pride Hotel is actually a corporate building maintained by a third party, and the Pride Hotel has bought the ground, and few floors for the business. So, when we snigger at the look of the pathetic exterior of the building, the Pride Hotel is not to blame. This also attributed to a confusing entry of the cars if you are the first timer here.

We went there for a corporate lunch in one of their banquet halls. The reception was well decorated and spacious. The banquet was large with great looking chandeliers and space. I liked the decor. The manager-in-charge for the banquet was quite friendly.

The buffet lunch had three salads - tossed salad, German potato salad, and grilled veg salad. None of the salads made up to the mark. The tossed salad was too bland, there were no surprises in the grilled veg salad, and the German potato salad was a bowl of cubed potatoes garnished pepper and herbs and surrounded by sliced tomatoes. I probably missed the German part in that salad.

The cream of mushroom soup was good. I expected it to be good. It is a simple and no-surprise recipe. The veg selections with jeera aloo, shahi paneer and bhindi do piyaza were very good in taste. The jeera aloo was well cooked, moist, soft, and without the bitterness of the jeera. The paneer was fresh with a thick gravy. The bhindi do piyaza was tangy but not spicy, exactly what we wanted.

In the non-veg selection, the machhi nargisi kofta tasted good but the kofta resembled like egg devil in sauce. I never had this particular dish before so cannot comment on the authenticity of it. The machhi quotient was inexistent or probably overpowered due to the strong spices. The murg in tamatar was a subtle sweet and sour chicken in a rich gravy. It tasted good.

The semolina pudding was strong textured, chewy sort of dessert that I never had before. It tasted ok. For the lemon cheese cake, I did not expect the soft white cheese. It felt more like lemon cheese pastry compared to a cake. The taste was again ok.

So, it is 3.5. I was inclined for a 3.0 but the ambiance, support staff, and banquet managers made a lot of effort and we can give a grace for that. I heard that the place has a good buffet spread for lunch and dinner, and package deals in their bars as well. So, give this place a try, decide for yourself.

A 4 star hotel, fit to have a negative star rating.

1. The lobby and the rrstaurant is swarming with mosquitoes.

2. Frantic periodic calls to the waiter to fill water in ur glass is required

3. The menu mentions a brownie with ice cream, but they wont give u the ice cream without u asking for it.

4. Neither do they give u proper cutlery, nor does ur dinner plate match with the others on the table.

5. Pathetic service and attitude of staff

Go to this hotel only if u want to b grounded after a good day :p



----- 15 Feb, 2014 -----

Pathetic service, pathetic food, and more pathetic mosquitoes. Avoid this hotel.

I visited this place for dinner tonight with a few of my office colleagues. We opted for the buffet dinner and must say it was quite mediocre for the price they charged. First, there were just 2 choices for starters - 1 veg and 1 non veg - and the shocking part was that it was not unlimited contrary to the basic concept of a buffet! They just served two plates each with meagre quantity. The main buffet menu was very haphazard with no coherence among the items. The best items were the daal and parwal - its a shame that we liked only the items which we already eat at home :) Dessert was fine but nothing to die for.
In short, won't visit this place anytime soon.
