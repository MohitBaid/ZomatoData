I ordered Chinese food and it was pathetic. Whether it‚Äôs chilly chicken dry or kung pao chicken gravy, the pieces were not even cooked properly. And the Chowmein would be rated below average. They try enough to make it look good by putting such vegetables but there‚Äôs no taste in them. Unsatisfactory!!

The food looked and tasted just like chilli chicken (minus the chilli). The name "spring chicken" is perhaps a bit misleading

EDIT: Here's the follow-up after the original review: One of the employees (or perhaps the manager, I'm not sure) called me the day later and notified that it was actually a packaging issue and they sent me the wrong dish earlier, so they offered to send it (or any dish I might like) for free to correct their mistake. They delivered the same order (spring chicken) the next night as per my request and fortunately, I got the correct dish. The texture of the chicken pieces looked like that of the previous dish, but the taste and color was different this time. It was really good (felt more like what I'd expect spring chicken to taste like). It had a nice sweet and juicy flavor and the aroma of the vegetables was nice. It felt like they took good care in doing it correctly this time.

I have to say, Midnight Belly takes its reviews seriously. Good service!

I really have a record of bad experiences on zomato orders. But this place was successful in surprising me. Was immensely hungry one day after college and ordered fried chicken quit late at night.¬†
They delivered within 30 minutes and 6 big pieces of fried chicken for 120 filled my stomach without making a hole in my student pocket. The quality and taste was amazing too!
I would love if a dip accompanied the fried chicken because I had to make my own mayo dip.
Must try for everyone¬† !

First I want to say during pujo it's very common that the order may be delayed.So, which is why they should communicate at the time of placing order, which they did lately.Ok, enough of that now, coming to the food.I ordered Chicken Sandwich and Egg Cantonese Noodles.The sandwich was very good and the chicken fillings was smothered in mayo, which I liked very much being a mayo lover.The noodles was nothing special it was average tasting.The prices are average.I actually recommend this place specially if you have a late night cravings.

It's 11:43 on Saptami evening, and Swiggy has ceased all operations, killing their determination to deliver and my hope for food. Zomato to the rescue, and along with it Midnight Belly. Being a Burger boy, my first choice is always a burger, and they offer only three so I go for the chicken burger, along with extra cheese and extra salami. Delivery comes in just under 50 minutes, and the gorgeous burger is ready for consumption. The delivery was quick, the burger was delicious and I'm a very very tummy-satisfied man.

In order to get minimum order as 99/-, do call on the restaurant's number 8017258473 and 8910162663. Awesome food at such cheap rates. They provide Healthy food at such low rates and that also at night till 6am in the morning, which is the best part of the outlet. Speedy delivery as well... Especially during occasions like durga puja, they are the only restaurant which is delivering on time (according to my experience of late night home delivery from other restaurants being a night person). Highly recommended! :)

I have ordered tempura battered fish with tarter sauce, Fish n Chips with tarter sauce, mixed cantonese noodles and white mushroom chicken.  It's a complete waste of money. I suggest not to order from this place. The quality of the food is equally bad as the quality of the cooking. The fish were smelling, the tempura batter fish was half cooked, the cantonese noodles was a disgrace to chinese food, the gravy was like veggies and chicken in water. Not a single dish delivered was good. Wish to rate 0 but there's no such option for that.

Sometimes simple cravings leads to most satisfaction.
Schezwan style noodles should be fiery in taste. Not only fiery looking. Which is where most of them fail. But this is the reverse charge. Veg Schezwan Style Noodles from in here was not at all fiery looking but fiery in taste, which is exactly how it should be. The noodles were not thick, which is what Calcutta is known for. 
Although I didn't mind, but you should give a fork, ketchup and invoice‚ò∫
