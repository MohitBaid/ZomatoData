First time tried. And completely bowled over. They claim to be 96% fat free and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not but I am least interested. Today is 5th and I happened to visit forum mall ... was elated to see that on every 5th of the month they provide few flavours at Rs. 15/- ... yes u heard right. Had their vanilla and coffee flavoured ice cream. Too good they were. Longing to hv more of these soon!!!

I tried the Butterscotch Caramel cake scoop yesterday.. I must say I was really impressed by the taste, otherwise paying such a high price for a meagre amount I doubt if I'll reconsider it given there are always some reliable brands to fall back on.

Small kiosk located on level 4 at Forum Mall is very catchy and nicely located under the escalator. Tried few flavours and loved the Gelato's they serve. butterscotch caramel cake, cho Fudge cake, cookies and cream are few flavours you must try. My personal fav was kulfi which was absolutely yummy. Would love to visit again.
