Located in belgharia, a decent sweet shop, small but sweet quality is good, staffs are polite, ambience is ok with good servicing and friendly price.
Coming to sweets, tried their rosogolla, chena toast, laddu, dhoklas, kachoris with cholar dal which is available in morning. All the items were indeed delectable and a worthy visit. But Kolkata has many other better options in sweets section.

Walked in for having some sweets. Tried their Rosogolla and Rosomalai. Both tasted very good. Rosogolla was soft and warm when served which added more to its taste.
Also I tried their Laddu. Good enough for Rs.5.

It's near to my place. The sweets are fresh and delicious always. caters to a variety of sweets. But the usp of Sutripti is it's early morning breakfast - hot and puffy kochuris and cholar dal. A must try.

It is one of the best sweet shops in our locality. Actually it's a branch of the original sutripti shop near Kalachand school. I love sweets from this place. Price is reasonable.

Since childhood I was desperately looking for a good sweet shop in Belghoria like the famous ones around the city. And there it was only a few months ago started. sutripti dahi, rasgolla, rajvog, paneer chop, veg sandwich, evening kachooris and so many will definitely attract the Mishti Lovers. Priceless mouth watering emotions almost everyday!yummy ?
