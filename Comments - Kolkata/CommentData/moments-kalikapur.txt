There sud be a provision to rate in negative...this restaurant is really that bad.Never ever get lured in enchanted by the decor or the ambience. Run fast, run far.We ordered Cream of Mushroom and seafood soup. In the first one...they quite literally had out in raw mushrooms and chopped vegetables in warm water with a big lump of cream...it tasted horrible.The seafood soup was marginally better yet a far cry from standard quality.The Reshmi Kebab had nothing Reshmi about it...just regular kebab dripped in milk..insipid and bland it was.We cudn't muster the courage to order anything else and made our way out of the restaurant as fast as we could.

Shiny decor but hollow service , food quality is bad , to be more precise you might get bones in boneless pcs,   it all depends on your luck & the icing on the cake is their behaviour,  I have made a pledge never again !!!

The food quality is good as well as the environment and service. We mostly face the problem of food quality degradation during festive season in kolkata. But they maintained their quality. Well done !!!

In one word this is unbelievable to have a lunch buffet in only 120/per plate with variety including Veg soup to dessert.Quality is good and ambience is also nice and you can certainly go there with your friends and family.

Food is average , but the restaurant is very small.  I usually order Chinese and food is always served hot. The taste is average. The menu card is quite elaborate but the choices are limited.

The beautiful exterior will definitely lure you in, and you'll end up in an  restaurant with a decent decor. But, the thing that kills the mood is a refrigerator - not just any refrigerator, but one which is present in very sweet and snacks shop at the corner of your para - one with a transparent door that reveals the bottles of coke and seven up and what not, a red refrigerator with Coca-Cola written along the borders. This fridge transformed a decent restaurant into a college canteen. 
The menu was unexciting; it was short, and the items were the same that we get at every roadside restaurant. We chose the garlic fried rice, and Hong-Kong chicken to go with it, according to the suggestion of the Steward, along with crispy baby corn for starters. The baby corn was quite large in amount, and tasted good, though it was a little too sweet for my taste. The friend rice turned out to be quite regular, with just some additional pieces of chopped garlic. The chicken dish had a fresh taste, but the let down for me was the texture of the meat - it was very much like packaged chicken nuggets, or boiled or pressed chicken. The pieces were bland inside, a disappointing contrast to the gravy. But the biggest shock was that the pieces were full of bones. At one point, I had to ask the server if the meat pieces they serve are supposed to be boneless, and upon receiving a confirmation that they are, I complained about the bones, pointing at the specimens that we had saved. The server just gave a nervous smile and left. Again, both the rice and the chicken side were large in quantity. 
The service was average; our server was a young and over enthusiastic man, with little clue as to how he should respond to our queries or complaints. At the end of the meal, we were served complimentary ice cream; I'm not sure if it is some kind of a custom. Here for new customers, but I guess it was to compensate for the bones in the boneless chicken. The ice cream tasted good - it had the flavour of butter scotch, though it looked like vanilla ice cream. To sum it all up, it was a below average experience, taking into consideration the decor, service, food, and price.
