Ever since I moved to Calcutta about a couple of years ago, my best food experiences have been in tiny, run-down establishments and not in the fancier, well known names. Sharma Tea House is one such find (no we aren't related). Their kachori sabji took me back to the lanes of chandni chawk and the chai + jalebi afterwards was on point. The snooty staff at the 'old world' Calcutta restaurants could sure take a pointer or two from the warm, friendly vibes at this shack. Pro tip : Go here for a hangover cure meal and be ready to be seated at a wooden bench. No seating available otherwise.

The best thing about Sharma Tea House is their kesar tea and namkeen topped with diced green chilli. Club kachoris fill many hungry stomachs in the morning although I am personally not very fond of it. Gulab jamuns are good. There is almost no place to sit. It is usually crowded. Some would even call it dirty. Staff behavior is rude sometimes. Tea is good and recently they've hiked their rates of tea. Overall, its a good place to snack.

This place is a heaven for snack lovers. I had keshar tea with nimki. Specially the nimki was good. I also had kachori with jelabi. If you visit this place i would suggest you to go for keshar tea and nimki.

Excellent road side food! Must try Kesar Chai, Samosa, Jalebi & Kolkatta Famous Kachori Sabzi. The taste is just mouth watering. Good car service as there is no place to sit or stand and eat. Cant comment much on Hygiene as food is made and served on road side. My rate is completely on quality and taste of food.

I had my breakfast one summer morning. I ate kachuri. It is remarkably good with their signature taste. The accompaniments potato curry has its own texture with mouthwatering aroma. The jalebi was simply awesome. The place is great for breakfast.¬†
No one can think about the price of good food in India , except in Kolkata.

Spend less than 50 for very satisfying food.

Visited for breakfast during break journey via Howrah. Not difficult to locate using Ola. Pretty crowded but service was fast. Ordered clubkachori with sabji and the famous KesarTea served in clay cups. Kachoris were very khaasta and served hot with mildly spiced filling inside but the aloo sabji served along with was quite spicy and savoury. KesarTea again was mild and the saffron threads sprinkled on top did add some strong aroma to it.

So finally in Kolkata, and the much known Sharma tea house is the first place we visited. Kolkata is famous for its street side junk food. Tried their kachodi sabji Nashta which is basically thick puris served with potato gravy which was decent in taste. Tried their tea which is served in a kulhad and best tastes with nimki.

Just the right place to kick start your morning with a lovely cup of tea. The club kachoris are incredible. They make it live infront of you and is served piping hot. People usually come down here after a jog from victoria and is very crowded in the morning. Forget the calories and indulge into some crazy indian breakfast. Highly recommended.

This had been my mother's favourite place back when she was in college and till now it hasn't lost its charms. Their tea is probably the thing why even at 8 in the morning, there's a huge crowd in front of the place. Hot kachoris and jalebis are being fried in the huge kadais, and they taste as good as they look. If you're in Kolkata and want to visit one of the famous places, breakfast at this place should definitely feature in your list.

Situated near the campus of IPGMER and SSKM hospital, this outlet is the go-to-place for snacks at any time of the day. 
They serve hot tea...available at many prices according to size of the earthen cup and add-ons. 
Kesar tea is what i really took a liking to. Moreover, Kachori with vegetables is delicious. Their samosa and jalebis are palatable too. 
There are just 2-3 benches in front of the outlet which cater to all the customers. As a result the place remains overcrowded on most of the days. Furthermore, concern for food hygiene is sorely lacking among the servers here.

The chutney which comes alongside kachori is another add on. The samosas also was not very oily and spicy. Remain almost overcrowded all the time for its location. Place not clean enough.

Sharma tea house is insanely popular. Between Balwant Singh, Gupta Brothers and this place itself, this entire alley of Bhawanipur best be renamed snack lane. Anyway, coming to the point, Sharma tea house is good, but I've had better.
I've had nimkis, the Kachori sabzi, tea, jalebi and most other stuff at this place. Everything is fine, but apart from the kesaria tea, I prefer other items from other places. Moreover, the service has also gone down a bit. Coming to the point, Sharma tea house is still worth going to satisfy your breakfast / snack crave. The reason for the low score is because it isn't as good as it used to be.

The Sharma Tea House is known for it's tea and kachori. You can find both the items at any time of the day. First I come to the tea... Tea is superbly fine and aromatic. You can have it in only 15 bucks whether compare to it's main competitor Balwant Singh's Dhaba on the other side of the road is very cheap.
Now comes to it's mouthwatering Kachoris. Need not to say, you must eat this. Cost Rs.8 each pc.
Now comes to the main part the famous Canadian celebrity chef David Rocco was there for the chai and kachori.
Then guess from this how much famous this is...

You've gotta try the Kachauri Sabzi here. Its out of the world. The place is always busy and overcrowed, so you may face some lacklustre attitude in the service from the staff.

The jalebis and the khasta kachauris are amazing. Also the kachauri-sabzi is one of bestselling dishes here. Not to mention the excellent tea that it serves. 

If you are in this locality, you must visit this place.

Am a Julienite, and for a Julienite to not go to Sharma Dhaba and have it's kachoris and lassi, is a sin. It's walking distance from Northern park. And the number of times I have visited this place is little more than I can remember. Starting from the hot gulab jamun to the samosas. Everything available here is good enough to bring you back. But one thing that stands out is the lassi. Comes in 3 measures of small medium and large. And is simply divine. The only bad thing is that you have to stand and eat. But that is not much of ¬†a problem if you are with friends. The place is close to my heart as it brings back all the memories.

One of the oldest breakfast destination! This is where people come at like 6am to have the tea and the kachori sabzi! Also, you'll find elderly groups here having a great time. 
If you haven't been here, it's a must must!! Must try is the kachori sabzi and the tea. Great place to come in the morning.

The best thing about this place is the odd timings when it operates.. You need some after a long night party cramp, this this is the perfect place. It starts serving from very early hours of the morning.. The puri sab ji and a follow up of tea is just too good.

Sharma Tea house offers you delicious tea and snacks right from early morning till about 9 pm at night. This place is almost always filled with people, yet the service is prompt. Have come here often. Their kachori sabzi, special kesar elaichi chai and samosas are just too good. Their gulab jamun looks more brown and is much better than the regular gulab jamun available at a sweet shop. They make tasty jalebis too. Love to grab a bite here :-)

Craving hot jalebis,dripping juicy gulab jamuns straight out of the kadhai! This is the go-to- place.
How about rounding it off with kachoris & Aloo sabzi served with a sweet khajoor chutney & pickled mustard chillies?
Eat all this & thank me.You're going to love it.
Don't forget the kesaria chai,its good & definitely better than the one at Balwant's.
Pocket pinch? Won't hurt at all.
Love this place.

I've been visiting STH since a long time.. more than 5 yrs.. i.e during my ttns at exide and when I visit Victoria for mrng walks..
A wow place .. for tea, kachori sabzi, kesar jalebi, kesar tea, lassi etc. It's the most busiest tea centre at bhawanipur In the mrng .. generally from 8am to 10am.. their service is very prompt!
One of the most famous drink.. milk cola you get chilled out there..
I remember during winters I just go Victoria for jogging only for the love of having breakfast at STH.. even during my Ttn days .. I have had alot of kesar Tea and samosa at this place .. and the staffs are really good.. They make sure they serve the right thing at right time..
In the mrng.. ambience is generally of ppl returning from walks and jogs..
The taste and quality of food they serve .. is not comparable with any other..
Location is opposite to Gurdwara .. a little walk from rabindra sadan..!

Had the tea only which is far better than any other small shops serving the same tea at the same price. Sharma tea has no competition in it.

The first thing she asked me while on the opposite side of Sharma Tea House, ‚ÄúIs this the tea joint for that famous Kesar Tea! Are you sure?‚Äù¬† I started laughing and replied, ‚ÄúYes I am. This is one and only ‚ÄúSharma Tea House and I have been here since long‚Äù. She was a bit skeptical and asked ‚ÄúIs it okay having breakfast there and specifically tea? The place seems not hygienic!‚Äù. I was a bit cautious then and protected toward the tea heritage of Kolkata like a mother hen and replied, ‚ÄúDear having local Chai prepared with mineral water is nothing but insulting for Street Food corners in India and specifically in Kolkata! I really don‚Äôt want to comment on the hygiene part but if you ask me about the taste then I can assure you that it is worth paying 20 Rupees for a cup of Kesar tea at this pint sized shop! Moreover, I haven‚Äôt heard anybody felt sick after having the food here or after eating tea‚Äù! Now she was confused and asked, ‚ÄúExcuse me! You eat tea!‚Äù and then I replied, ‚ÄúYes I am a true blue Bengali and Bongs eat their tea! We don‚Äôt drink anything for that matter!‚Äù After this weird discussion where I was lecturing how it is okay having tea and Kachauri there at Sharma Tea House I was fully exhausted and uttered with curse ‚Äú‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶¶‡¶æ ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶∞ ‡¶ö‡¶æ ‡¶§‡¶æ‡ßú‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ‡ßú‡¶ø‚Äù (Dada give me a Kesar tea and hurry please)!

It was just another regular cup of tea in a kullar. With few of my friends boasting about really good tea points we narrowed down on sharma tea point and I guess we should not have come here with any high expectations, Infact with any expectations. We ordered the kesar tea and it did not live up to the words used to personify the tea here.
Again, for just another tea of this type it was too expensive also!

I had been there twice and travelled from Rajarhat to their place early morning@5am to have that special kesar chai, kesar jalebis and kachori and aloo sabji. Fab breakfast makes your day wonderful. Its always crowded with people of all ages from elderly to kids alongwith parents. There is long queue of luxury cars parked to have a sip of the chai and grab the morning snacks. Just fab and awesome!!

Staff behavior was nice. Ambitious was good. Tea was just awsome. Refreshing and very tasty. In snacks we have kachori, samosa, DahiBada, kofta & jalegi and all the snacks were very tasty and spicy.

The perfect tea to start a day  with. It's the special Sharma Tea. I always wanted to try the special chai of Calcutta in Kulhad. Was always curious to know why Bengalis drink so much of tea. It's a must try if you come to Calcutta. 
Also famous here is the Singhade they serve with Sabji. Now Singhade in North India means something else. But here it is fried Samosa and it's the bestseller. It's always crowded.
Value for money- Yes

We ve taken kachowri,sabzi,hot hot jalebis n tea of course.
Don't always go for ambience cz its a street stall n located on a very busy street always cars honking n overcrowded whenever you come. But if you are a tea lover,just come here for a VAAR of tea....as I ve come driving from far kona express way only to have a cup of tea... Jeeeo!!!!

Sharma Tea has grown really popular over the past couple of years as an easy and contented spot for breakfast with its outlets in different corners of the city. Students, siblings and even office goers find it really convenient to grab a quick breakfast at very cheap rates.

I went there along with my friends after a long and tiring early morning tuition that had left us starving. We had the staple Khasta Kachori along with a Samosa. Also a glass of Lassi to end it on a delightful note. The quality of food is really good.

The place is well known to provide filling breakfast items at very economic rates, which is a major reason that it attracts such volume of crowds. Each morning the stall is surrounded by dozens of people eagerly waiting for their meals. This leads to a major problem of space management. You literally don‚Äôt have place to stand at eat your food peacefully, the only problem that I noticed about the joint.

Sharma Tea House, a very crowded place during morning hours. I drove around 8kms to try the awesome breakfast. We ordered Kachori Sabzi, Jalebi, Namak Paade and Tea. However, they also serve Samosa.

I have eaten Kachori Sabzi in past at Kolkata and it was a very nice experience here also. Kachori's were very small in size. ¬†Naman-paade (Nimki) were served with a pickle. I could not try their Samosas as my appetite was full after having 2 places of Kachori-Sabzi. To sumup, everything was very nice.

This place does not have a proper sitting area but just a road side sitting arrangement comprising of Benches and Chairs. Sitting on road side benches and having your breakfast is itself a very new and great experience. It is a recommended place to visit for Kachori-Sabzi lovers

If you want a 'Tea-holic', this one is the place for you. No one makes tea like they do. I am a super fan of Sharma's tea. We usually visit the shop early in the morning and no wonder, that the place is fully crowded even at the earliest of hours. My personal favorite is the masala tea or kesar tea. One sip of the tea takes me to the seventh heaven. They also provide some mouth-watering snacks which you can pair with your morning tea. Kachouri and sabzi are also available for break-fast or evening snack.
