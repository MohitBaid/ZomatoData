Great Place. Loved the food there, especially the cheese balls in pesto sauce. Was very reasonable. Had ordered The Chicken Cheese Garlic Bread, Fried Chicken, Pizza Samosa and chicken wrap. Place was a bit difficult to find and parking was an issue, but overall experience was nice.

Location wise it's bit difficult to recognize... Situated beside Paris Cafe... I was hungry and went for their fried chicken n egg burger... I get stunned... How this guys are managing to serve such a large nos of items from such a small kitchen... Staffs are very smart n courteous too... Decor is nothing great but they used the mirrors‚Äã very wisely... That makes the place pretty eye catchy... Btw... The burger n chicken was very good for a change from regular KFC options... I parceled a chicken cheese wrap and it was just mind blowing... And above all it was very pocket friendly place... So highly recommend to all...

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

Snack Street Cafe was one of the participants there.

This cafe has two outlets in Kolkata and they serve popular American and European junk food with Indian twist.

I opted to taste their Veg Cheese Burger, which comprised of - burger bun, thick aloo patty, mayonnaise, lettuces, cheese and seasonings. The cheese portion was quite generous. The burger tasted nice. 

This burger is apt for a quick bite of comfort food.

Location near SBI Alipore.  
One of the few decent quick bites in the area.  
The best thing about the place is amazing combo which is very reasonable.  
Their chicken tandoori burger is absolutely lipsmacking. The burger is very delicious and fitting.  
Service is fast and attentive. 
Pocket pinch is reasonable.

I'm a regular to this place. I usually order egg chicken snack street wrap and I personally love it. 
But, today I ordered the same egg chicken snack Street wrap via swiggy and was utterly disappointed with the quantity as it was not the same it used to be.
Secondly the outer covering or the roti was very dry n thin. The fillings today was not appropriate and it was not sufficient in. Quantity.

Today I felt paying 145 for this was not at all worth.
Disappointed with such kinda order from you guys.

Ok so this is a place about which I wouldn't like to write much as my ratings says it all. Be it in the afternoon you want to grab something really quick or in the evening while coming back from.work or anything or you want something for dinner. This place has it all. Dishes for all times. As I am someone regular here I get the privilege to try new dishes before they enter the menu. Photos attached of flavoured cheese garlic bread. You need to try this and I bet you'll stop having garlic breads anywhere else and that has been added in the menu. Also attached is a photo of pesto rice with cottage crumbs which hasn't been entered in the menu but is one hell.of a dish for all rice and pesto lovers. 
Get there and grab something
 I am sure you wouldn't regret

Mastering the art of making American snacks with a desi chatakdar masala twist, Snack Street Cafe is the sole relief to all students anfd office goers of Alipore. They specialise in Chicken Burger, Mexican Wrap, Veg Mexican Wrap, Veg Snack Street Burger , Cheese Jalape√±o Burger.

Location: this is located at Alipore Road, just opposite the Alipore State Bank just beside the Paris Cafe Alipore branch.

Decor and Ambience: done up smug and cosy, Snack street cafe is more prevalently into home delivery and take away as there are no provision for seating in the limited space. However, if you are comfortable standing, you can manage to pool in some space placing your food of the tables clung to the wall. The decor is simplistic with the likes of broken brick walls and amidst it juts out the hoarding which reads snack street. The dream map where they plan to set up their outlets is quite interesting as well.

Staffs: The owner, Mr. Jayant played an amazing host. His innovations to make American snacks with a desi twitch supported by his chefs, make snack street a success story. 

The menu which was served were as follows.

The Non-Veg menu inclusions-

1. Chicken egg snack street wrap- It is a unique combination of egg and chicken marinated in our special sauce and grilled in a roomali roti. Amazingly crispy, crunchy, filling, delicious. You just cannot stop at one.

Yummy snacks and fried goodiness only at Snack Street, Alipore!
If the likes of KFC and Mc Donald have bored you to eternity, worry not much! There‚Äôs a new kid in town, and they specializes in presenting American Street Food with a Desi Indian twist.  Opened as a mere take-away and delivery joint, this particular restaurant/food outlet has flourished ever since and is now a talk of the town. The location might be a bit tricky, but if you know where Paris Caf√© is at Alipore, you would find Snack Street just beside the same. The outlet is a small one, which used to house an ATM before. Hardly 6-7 people can stand comfortably without brushing each other. However, apparently being a soul food joint, people do not really need to sit and have the meals.

A restaurant located next door, the main business model is mostly home delivery which keeps this place throughout the entire day. The patrons mostly include the youngsters and middle aged people who may be looking for a quick lunch alternative, but not spend something expensive. B urgers, Wraps, Nuggets, Wings, Momos, Cold Drinks; this little place has them all. For someone who wishes to do some savings, the combo offers are also up for grabs. Team #panchphoron was invited for an extensive food tasting session. Little did we know the bundle of joy awaiting us!

1) Chicken egg snack street wrap:

(A unique combination of egg and chicken marinated in our special sauce and grilled in a roomali roti)

Undoubtedly, the best of all the items we had tried. A lovely combination of juicy and crispy fried chicken with egg to mix with the special sauce. The roomali roti was more like the wrap you get for Shwarma. The Roti was crispy and fluffy, adding to the crispy texture. This adaptation of fried chicken was so good, that I made my way back to this place the following day and bought two of them to have back home.

2) Fried chicken

(Chicken marinated with our in-house fusion of special masalas and deep fried to provide that extra crunchy affair)

More of a familiar name/item you may easily see elsewhere. However, what sets apart the fried chicken from this place is the juicy chicken, the crispy texture from the outside, and the thin and flavorful batter. Fried deep to perfection, the masala which was sprinkled on top, really tickled our tastebuds.

3) Chicken tandoori wrap-

(A fusion of european style chicken with the indian tandoori flavour wrapped in a roomali roti and grilled)

A desi modification to the erstwhile fried chicken. This one had tandoori flavors, dusted and sprinkled all over the fried chicken. The chicken portion was then wrapped inside a crisp and soft romali roti and then grilled to perfection.

4) Chicken &Cheese garlic bread-

(Get hooked to this combination of garlic bread infused with dallops of cheese and chicken marinated with our in-house masala and grilled)

With Dominos ruling the Garlic Bread Market, this one here did not stand up to the expectation. May be because, the bar raised by the fried chicken adaptions did not match with this one. Not a bad preparation though, somewhere I felt that the quantity of cheese was very less. A bit more brushing of flavors like oregano and flakes, would have made wonders.

¬†

Veg menu-

1) Veg Mexican wrap-

(A roomali roti infused with vegetable patty made of potato, corn, peas and special masala marinated with combination of sauces giving it a tangy and spicy taste, wrapped and grilled thus a low-oil affair )

For any given person, differentiating this wrap with a standard non-veg wrap would be extremely difficult. The patty was succulent, crispy and well made. The flavors blended in really well, and the combination of potato, corn, peas, tossed with the masala created a heavenly patty altogether. The sauces too were heavenly and imparted a sweet, sour and tangy flavor to the wrap. A delight for the vegetarian lovers.

2) Fried Veg Momo-

(Deep fried dumplings filled with vegetables severed with a spicy dip)

A quintessential Tibetian delicacy, perhaps this is one of those popular street food adapted from abroad.  The vegetables were fresh, and the momos were fried till light brown with a crispy texture on the outside.  The sauce was sweet and tangy, and complemented the Momos well.

Let there be no doubt, this is the best place in town serving American fast food at cheap and affordable rates. A much needed relief for those who run tight when it comes to their pocket money, the food here is cheap, yet gives you good value for money. The owner himself is present in the outlet most of the times and caters to the needs of every customers, whether they walk in or opts for home delivery or take-away. The place might be a small one, but they have been filling in the hearts and tummies of more happy souls any other place could probably only imagine.

Well, it‚Äôs really surprising that I haven‚Äôt ever come across this hidden gem, Snack Street Cafe, which inspite of occupying a prominent location near Alipore State Bank, is shadowed by the glamorous look of the adjacent Paris Cafe. It is actually difficult to get this place unless you are searching for it, but the day you try out this place, it‚Äôs sure to make a permanent place in your heart. As said earlier, a hungry person would obviously step into Paris Cafe, going by its amazing decor which has the potential to attract customers, while there‚Äôs almost nothing that Snack Street Cafe has that will attract a customer towards it. This is the major con of this place, the others being lack of space and no seating area. In spite of this, in my view, Snack Street Cafe stands far ahead of its immediate neighbour, the reason being the one and only thing that a foodie needs, and that‚Äôs good food !

Snack street cafe located in the corner of ¬†Nandan building in¬†17/1D, Alipore Road, Near Alipore State Bank and Paris cafe as its neighbour is a place to snack on some great fast food run by Jayant Sethia who is one fine man on a mission to give people a good food deal for their money .As it was a dream to run a food business and now it is happening most definite in all the right ways.Snack street cafe has not got the fame apart only from its neighbourhood it deserved yet ,as it is overlooked by the big fast food giants in the food circle in our city ,but this might seem to change if this eatery and its offerings are more visible and popular among all . Snack street cafe is currently having a delivery and take away service but one can get grab a bite inside the cafe as there is place to stand comfortably for 5 to 8 people with fixed marble slabs to place your food and enjoy . Apart from this they dont have any other outlets in Kolkata but there is a full fledged restaurant of theirs in Bokaro city which has the same menu available ,some pictures of it are below .

Some of you might have come across this place on zomato,and wondered to yourself where exactly is this place in Alipore? Chances are if you are standing bang in front of this joint, you may not still be able to find it. Tucked away in a corner of the same building that houses the Paris Cafe, this one is a pretty small place easily overlooked by the non suspecting regulars. & That‚Äôs justified since the place used to be a freaking ATM! However the owner has put the place to good use, redesigned it well & come up with a small place which serves pretty finger licking stuff! The place doesn‚Äôt offer any seating arrangement, however you can stand inside & have the food. When I inquired about this space-crunch, the owner replied that he had a delivery & take away model in his mind when he opened it, & it has been a successful venture that way. The foods are mostly comfortable foods & snacks, ¬†hence don‚Äôt really need a seating arrangement to be consumed. Coming to the reason of our visit, I had come across the name on zomato a few times, before the owner invited our group, PanchPhoron over for a tasting of the food that he serves. The logo is a sure shot ripoff from ‚ÄòHard Rock Cafe‚Äô. Read on to find out whether the food they serve are rock stars of snacks or not!

Visited this cafe 2 days back .. I was very hungry.. And ordered for crispy chicken.To be very frank I didnt like the joint.Please read the following points :

1) The food was not properly cooked as I found chicken blood inside the same.
2) They didnt have any seating arrangement at all.So had to ate the food by standing which was very much uncomfortable.
3) The place was very stuffy and also the AC was not functioning well.¬†
4) The staffs were not courtious.¬†

Not recommended from my end. Thank you.

Well firstly I stay a stone's throw away from the joint yet they sent the order of a burger fries and thumps up after an hour, better yet the delivery guy couldn't find the address even after giving the guy a clear location. The food was a wannabe kfc fried chicken but clearly it failed in all the levels. The oil used was not very good I still have that cheap oil smell in my hand the chickens were cold and missed a lil tenderness.

This place almost came like a saviour, when in the middle of Alipur, me and a friend were scurrying for some meaty snacks.

 Located right at the crossing, this place offers the simple joys of life, namely meat filled wraps and burgers, with dallops of dressings. 

I had their Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap, and my friend, their Snack Street Chicken Burger, and both were outstanding. 

Would definitely visit this place again, and if not, will order in very soon!

Had purchased a coupon from nearbuy of the restruant in which was written that free home delivery would be given for radius upto 2kms. In Google maps my distance from restruant was 1.6kms but still was charged for delivery.
Coming on the quality and taste of the food it was really awesome even though it was not worth the amount paid the food was quite satisfying.

I ordered their chicken burger combo through Swiggy. Can't complain about the burger it was really tasty. Fried chicken was not good...I mean I know I can't expect them to be upto the standards of KFC but still...French fries were dipping with oil...burger was really great. I also got a bit of stomach upset by eating their food hence the low rating. Should have given 1 if it hasn't been for the burger.

I must say this place has some good quality delicious food.
They have the perfect Burgers and Wraps.¬†
My personal favorite flavors are Tandoori and Honey Mustard (both in Burgers and Wraps).
Order a side of French Fries and a Beverage to complete your meal.
The outlet in itself is a little small. But you can get your meal delivered at home. It tastes as good at home as it does at the Cafe.

Formerly an ATM , currently a fast food spot. Kudos to the owner who could arrange so much in such a place. 

Let me share an incident:

We were at a friend's place and had ordered for a veg popular burger and veg momos using the swiggy food delivery people. The food reached on time and was very well packed. Trust me the momo was so amazing that all of us went to the cafe itself from our friend's place to grab another plate of it. 

The burgers were nice too. The owner was extremely polite. We also had a machine brewed cappuccino and green coffee. 

The green coffee was nothing but an antioxidant like green tea without the flavour of tea in it. Basically for people who are anti-tea !! :)
