The food was awful, chillichiken's meats were contaminated, the service was so poor, don't waste your money here. The shop looks cheap not its price rate.

This is the worst restaurant ever. Trust me, I am forced to use the F-word to describe it. The food is stale. And ambience and decor sucks. One or two workers are there, probably due to less pay. The price is too high for a restaurant like this. Who on earth wants to spend Rs175 just on a plate on Chicken Chowmein? Please, if you want to save your spare time and money, don't even step in. And one more thing, there is one AC room above and mostly the AC doesn't work.

I have had dine here after our movie at Menoka few years back just to feed our so empty belly ü§¢
It has just an upstairs tiny room to be accommodate for few people I can't recall exactly how many people they can accommodate at a time and at ground floor backside they have their kitchen probably if I don't recall wrong. Their foods are worse than even roadside foods.
Don't go here ever! ‚ùåüö´

Nothing much to say. Mainly haunted by students and couples in a budget. Zero decor and ambience. Lazy staff and okayish food. This place is still running because its really cheap and to the students of the nearby schools and colleges its nostalgic.

A tiny joint just around the sarovar lake crossing, once or twice I had meals here...and every time it was gross!
Although portions are sufficient as per as rate, but food lacks taste ... I tried chowmein and some chicken side dish...and it tasted like roadside dish
.. What's the point of dining in a restaurant when it serves meals of roadside quality?
Highly dissatisfied... Ain't gonna come back here.

The place might not be that big or classy but I think the food tastes really good. If you want a cheap but tasty food joint near rabindra sarobar metro then tintin is one of the bset solutions.

Had mixed hong kong chowmein and thai chicken. It was quite good and it is also very pocket friendly and the quantity is quite good . but the place is very small.

A value for money food joint for a quick take away mainly. There are place to sit but very small one and non AC as well. I have got basic fried rice , chicken noodles and chicken sweet and sour as a part of my delivery. Quantity and quality was generous. Decent option for take away.

Have visited few times must say its a small restaurant but food served is quite good. Price is on the higher side looking at the ambience but Food quality is good enough.There's an ac room upside which should be preferred . But employees are very less. One who serves the food also deal with other aspects
