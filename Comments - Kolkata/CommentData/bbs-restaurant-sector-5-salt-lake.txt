I have been to this place long time ago with one of my friends; this place is actually good for a group of friends to sit along with some liquor and food. I would prefer their starters which were far better than the main course. Everything from their 'Tandoor' section is worth trying. 

A good place for get together with friends, specially ones who are interested in liquors.

I have been here once for a family occasion. Their reception hall in its entirety was hired for the party. The room has a central clearing with the tables arranged along the side walls...along with comfortable sofas. There is not really much to comment on the decorum and ambience. Incidentally, this is a popular joint for hangout to the IT professionals working nearby...and they have a dedicated bar section.
Although they principally serve Indian dishes...that being a special occasion we had a menu comprising of both Indian and Chinese food items.
The Indian menu included Peas Pulao, Kalidal makhani, Mixed vegetables and
Chicken masala. All of the items were average...and accordingly they failed to stimulate my taste buds to an encouraging level.
The chinese items were Chicken fried rice, Veg hakka noodles, Mixed veg hot garlic, Chicken Manchurian and Schezwan chicken. The main courses items were again indeed drab...but the chicken items were tasty.
Overall, this looks like a place just to have a roadside lunch if you really need it...nothing more.

After we got there, the Very Humble staff introduced us to the Sharodiya Special Menu, though a bit disappointed  as we couldn't get the Pad Thai Noodles this time, But the Rest o the food was awesome. Started with Lat mai kai n Thai basil Prawns followed by Chilli Garlic Noodles, Fried rice  n Kawloon Chicken, Fish in Oyster Sauce. Over all a great Experience..

Do not visit this restaurant even if you do have to sleep on an empty stomach. Most of the food items are not available. There are cockroaches everywhere and I am sure it's not the theme. Do not visit this place. They are unable to maintain the most basic of hygiene and serve food that meets the least of a requirement. The waiters also have an excuse for all of the flaws and expects you to accept it as normal. I am not going there again. #Shutdownbb's

Avoid this place like a plague. Most pathetic service and callous behaviour of staff. We had ordered for Absolut vodka and Teachers. After ten mins the waiter says no absolute vodka. We order Smirnoff. Then he comes and say no Teachers.  We ask for one more Smirnoff.  Finally he comes and say no Smirnoff.  Rest I leave it too my readers. Shit place.

I honestly have no idea why this place has such a low rating. I have been there a few times and had a good experience every time. The seating is a bit congested and the ambience is nothing special. But the behavior of the staff and the food they serve along with their easy on the pocket drinks make up for that. A couple of dishes which I would specifically recommend here are the Chilli tomato chicken and the mutton tava fry. I ordered them a few times and they were equally tasty each time. Go give this place a try. Dont expect anything fancy and you wont be very disappointed.

Have been going to this place in the IBM complex for a while now. Standard hangout place for friends during late evenings for two reasons - cheap affordable booze and good food. First time in last 5 years or so, this place has disappointed me like anything. We found a cockroach in there complementary pindi Chana the other day. We called the manager - unapologetically he just said sorry once and went away to bring us another plate of the same dish. We said we don't want and asked for the bill , again shamelessly and least bothered he went away and sent us the bills. Overall it was a good place with poor service and untrained butlers but doable for quick booze and good starters but now am sure will never visit this place again.

This restaurant is situated in the IBM campus, a 7- 10 mins walk from college more.
I would suggest never visit this restaurant as:

1. Biriyani: Looks like they prepare it with sticky rice and the rice come in lumps .
It's not a place to have biriyani , I know but still it's not too hard to make a decent biriyani I guess.

2. Chelo- kebab: Avoid this too . the rice or the chelo they serve is mixed with mayonnaise, that makes its taste sweet & feels like you're eating curd rice.
Never ever try.
The kebabs are dry and salty .

3. Crispy babycorn & Mushroom: they are so overfried that you won't be able to differentiate between the corns & mushroom .

4. Ambience : we saw little cockroaches having a gala time on their window pane .

5. All the waiters will come and ask you once whether you have placed an order or not , they have no coordination among themselves .

ONLY GOOD THINGS THERE:

- it's almost always empty ( for obvious reasons! )
- their camel custard is good .

Next to the Electronic Complex PS, BB's is the go-to restaurant for the techies and college students near College More. We'd gone on a weekday lunch to escape the heat and also the canteen food ;). 

Ordered mixed fried rice and garlic fish. The staff were courteous though the food took its own sweet time to arrive in front of us. By the time it did, we were starving and dug right in. The rice was good, moist and with generous mix of prawns and chicken. The fish was also pretty fresh and a bit sweet. However, the portions only feed one person, and that is not particularly value for money. 

We also took fresh lime soda, and I have to tell you that was the sweetest thing I have ever tasted.

Only went to this place driven by nostalgia. This place used to be much better in ambiance, food and service years ago when we used to work in the nearby Millenium City. It is now a sad sad version of its previous avatar and there's not much happening to see any signs of improvement.
Missed the interesting menu card that used to come in a nice folder - now they just have a plain laminated menu. We ordered a chili potato which turned out to be just soggy french fries with some spring onions. Next, we had the fish fingers - slices of basa fish which were dry and overly coated with bread crumbs - the accompanying dip was not all that great.
We had the chicken in banana leaf as recommended by the server. These were basically chicken mince shaped into conical pieces, wrapped in banana leaves and deep fried. Some pieces were well cooked and juicy with a nice lemon grass flavour while some were undercooked and had a distinctive unpleasant smell. The banana leaves were super gready and it was an unpleasant experience removing them.We followed these with a Murgh Kali Mirch kebab which was the nicest of the lot.
Our vegetarian friends ordered Angoori Aloo which looked and tasted nice and a crispy chili baby corn which they created especially for us since it was not on the menu.
We had ordered some Seafood Tom Yum soup and a Seafood Lemon Coriander soup. The Tom Yum came with large sized prawns which were sadly overcooked and rubbery. The broth was tasty but super spicy because of the slit red chilies. The Lemon Coriander soup had to be changed once since they had given us a wrong dish the first time. The second soup was seafood soup alright but lacked flavour.We had a pitcher of mojito and beers to accompany the food.The service was patchy at best - there would often be no one available anywhere nearby. However, when available, the waitstaff was very polite.Not recommended unless you want a place to have a quick drink with your office colleagues.

Had been to this place yesterday evening for a quick drink. I will come to the review straightaway.

Location- located just below millenium city, it is very easybto locate.

Ambiance- Nothing special. Regular bar types with the crowd mostly comprising of sectorV office goers.

Food- Quite satisfactory. I have been to this place quite a number of times and have never been disappointed with food. I cannot state about their main course but starters are good. Last evening we had lamb in chilly tomato which they customized as per our taste. Fish fingers were fresh. They also served cucumber carrot sticks with spicy mayo. It was very refreshing. 

Service- Good but a bit slow perhaps. Staffs are extremely courteous and asking for feedback.

Pocket pinch- pocket friendly

So BB's definitely evokes a lot of fond memories about time spent with my colleagues and friends. The food is average but for regular office goers - a quick grab from here will not pinch the pocket.

Adjoined with the office of IBM of salt lake sector 5 , Kolkata lies BB's , a comfortable cosy restaurant , accompanied by a nice ambiance , too good and reasonable food . the food had perfect flavour . we tried Indian food , chicken reshmi butter masala , chicken takatak ( the best preparation , spicy and chatpata ) , fish tikka masala  and masala kulcha. I really had no issues with the quantity , quality of food , but has little issues with their delayed service ( may be because of rush during durga Puja )and has a slightly bigger issue how they were forcing the customers for taking packaged drinking water and very subtly not serving normal drinking water, that's attitude was a little disheartening but otherwise the experience was very good.

Came here on navami afternoon with family. The place was suprisingly empty evn though it was Durga Puja tym. First thing that was vry wrong on d part of d manager was that he said that our regular water is not at ol good so we can't serve regular water instead we r serving mineral water. We had to argue for a while for him to agree that d burden of mineral water cost should not b borne by d customer if they have a problem with the regular water. That really turned me off. We ordered dry hakka noodles with chilli baby corn to begin. The hakka was pretty good. For main course we ordered dal makhni, paneer butter masala and malai kofta in white gravy. The dal makhni was more diluted than required. Also the taste was average. The kofta was the best of all that we had ordered. Overall the food nd ambience was average.

Location is excellent, so that's an added advantage. I love their fish & chips, chicken biryani and the non-veg kebabs. The price is a little on the higher side though but quantity and quality of food is something I've no complaints about.

They complained to the staff and were seated at a different table with chairs instead of sofa. Same result, cockroach there also. And when reported this to restaurant staff,they said they do pest control regularly. Even if after doing pest control this is the situation in the sitting area just imagine the horror happening in the kitchen. This restaurant qualifies for negative rating if zomato allowed.

If you are standing in front of BB's then I would request you to walk 2 mins more and go to Rang De Basanti Dhaba and have a full lunch or dinner in 60% of the price. If you are looking for beers then there are ample good places to have a drink in Sec 5.
It used to be a good place few years back but now.. waste of money.

The ambiance is ordinary and the sitting arrangement lacks privacy. However, the staffs are good and the food quality is good as well. Do not compare this with any fine dining restaurants. We went to BB's about 5-6 times, mainly to celebrate different parties with office colleagues. They serve a couple of good fish items as starters. You can opt in for this restaurant for spending a good time with good food. However, food lovers and food critics should avoid BB's as it's not up to that level.

Visited last evening for a friend's birthday party...the renovated interior is very spacious..i think its open on Friday s only..heres the list of pros and cons:
Pros:
Very friendly staff...doing best to serve food on time...food tastes great with nice proportions...comfy seating...not very highly priced food items.
Cons:
No music..a soft music is sometimes expected..a smoking room would have been better..
Overall great dining experience alongwith good staff n food in the heart of Sector 5 kolkata.

When you have your office situated at Sector 5, it is but obvious you would visit this place. Gicven how regulars we are, we have tried almost all the items given in their menu. Gets rushy during Fridays but getting a table during Saturdays and Sundays is no problem at all. Good food, reasonably priced. All in all, a good visit place!

We generally visit this place for a drink or two, the ambiance is pretty good, not clumped or dark the price is also reasonable. The service is prompt. The place also serves good chinese. It is one of the very few places which will serve you cheap liquor, good food and you won't feel uncomfortable bringing in your family along with you,for a nice evening.

Went for a friends get together party. Got comfortable seating. Helpful staff. Reasonable price of liqueur but food is not tasty. Food price wise quantity is very less and not having enough option to choose among them.
Any way, I will not think to go again. bcz I can get same liqueur in other pub too..

need to improve in food taste, quantity, quality and menu

Well, I do not generally try out a place the 2nd time, if I I have been disappointed the 1st time. Had been to this place some 4 years back for a team lunch and was grossly unhappy with the food taste, so did not visit them these many years. Today, nevertheless decided to experiment again, and found out that they definitely have turned over a new leaf! The ambience was more appealing and food much much better as compared to my previous visit. I was warmly greeted by the staff and offered a sofa seater, which could accommodate 4. A muted LCD Tv was playing IPL highlights. Restaurant is finely decorated – to give it a Chinese feel – although, it is a multi-cuisine place! Size of tha place is also good and might accommodate 30 odd people! I expected some soothing numbers to play in the background, though no such arrangements were there!

I started off with a fresh lime soda (sweet and salt), which was fantastic – a perfect balance between sugar and salt – only drawback being that it was not that cool as I would have liked it. I opted for Masala kulcha and dal makhani for mains along with a couple of roasted papads. Dal was a beauty and tasted fine, except that it seemed too dilute. Kulcha was fine with decent stuffing and well prepared. Finger bowl served to me did not have warm water – which really turned me off – anyways, I am not deducting any points for this mischief!

Food quality and quantity was good as well as food presentation. Service is fine and the staff strived to meet all my expectations. Prices, are as usual, high and I am glad that they accept Sodexo vouchers. Location is great, inside the Millenium park @ Sector 5, Saltlake.

I strongly feel that they might start a buffet lunch as well as try to market themselves more in the competitive food market @ Sector 5.

P.S.- I enjoyed a 10% corporate discount  :)

One portion is good for me person only....on raising the issue the manager paid no attention and ignored and justified abt the portion...

Located in the Salt Lake, Sector V area, BB's is one of the best bar cum restaurant that one can get. Its very near to Webel and College more, lying beside the Millennium Park building. Though nothing too much to boast about, the ambiance, then again its also not much shabby. Drinks are available here at a very reasonable price. Corporate discounts are also on offer. Coming to the food, its quite good actually and also does not pinch the wallet very much. We had tried the Chicken Laasooni Kabab, Mutton Malai Boti as  starters. Both were equally good (though its unfair for a chicken dish to be compared with a Mutton one). We then had  Chicken Biryani with Mutton Rogan Josh. The Mutton Rogan Josh was really awesome. We had all these food accompanied with 2-3 Pegs of Johnnie Walker Red Label. The staff and their services were good and really had an enjoyable Friday evening after a busy week's work.

BBs is  a perfect destiantion to throw in treats to your friends but family visit is a good experience also. Located below Millenium tower, IBM building in Saltlake Sector V it offers options for buffet and a-la-carte at reasonable prices. A welcome drink follows the buffet spread, which stresses on chicken dishes with options for veggies.Rounds up with a cold dessert. Taste and food quality is good. Added to it the ambience,  makes it a value for money destination. Hospitable Staff and their cooperation is worth a mention. Pocket Pinch is around Rs.500/-. They also offer sumptous buffets at reasonable prices

TOTAL PRIVACY MAINTAINED, NO LOUD MUSIC, NO CHATTING AT TOP OF THE VOICE, NO DIM LIGHT....A CALM N QUIET PUB AT ITS BEST IN SEC 5 AREA.

It is BB's Restaurant for me. 

* Location : Just beside Bidhan nagar police station at Millennium city, you can see a big glow sign board from the main road.

* Ambience : I particularly like the entrance of the pub. A broad, empty space and then the restaurant door. There are 2 large and spacious rooms,decorated neatly by broad and comfortable sofas. Fancy hanging lights are quite fantastic....perfect setting with a peg to spend a quiet hour or 2. Just I entered the room and the ambience stole my heart instantly. (rating 10 on 10)

* Food : Every time I like light foods with drink. So I opted for
       1. Crispy chilly baby corn. ( cooked perfectly, awesome taste, lots of baby corns were there; seldom I see so much of baby corns in a platter in pubs.) (rating 9 on 10)
       2. Dry chicken Manchurian was not at its best. ( a bit salty and pieces were not satisfactory) (rating 6 on 10)
       3. Chicken Fried Rice. ( liked the taste so much. Fine rice,plenty of chicken) (rating 9 on 10)
       4. Limited variety they were serving in alcohol part. No one might take any different kind. So I opted for whiskey and vodka only.

* Price : Moderate as compared to other pub in sec 5. No complain.

* Management : I am very impressed with the management. My almost 3 hours on staying I ve seen the manager himself continuously was looking after the costumers. And if any service staff couldn't be able to answer any food query, the manager was always there to assist and suggest. Its really a good sign for a good restaurant. The service staffs were humble, courteous and were facing the customers with a smiling face. ( rating 10 on 10)

* Why recommended : For its cool, calm and quiet and very relaxing ambience. A total relaxation package in the hustle bustle of sec 5 working life.

Had been there yesterday for dinner along with my cousins. We were a team of 7. I must say we were thoroughly satisfied with the service, food quality and taste.
For the starters we had ordered Shredded lamb salad, Chicken satay, peanut sauce along with Fresh lime soda, Masala cold drinks and two bottles of Heineken. The Shredded Lamb Salad was simply awesome as the lamb was really tender and well cooked.
In the main course we had ordered Burnt Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice, Chicken Biriyani, Pad Thai Noodles and Hakka Chow along with Dragon Chicken, Chili Basil Chicken and Chicken Thai Samrod. All were well above satisfactory.
Special mention: just loved the Pad Thai Noodles.
I restrain myself from giving a rating of 5/5 only cause there is a small need of improvement in the presentation  of the dishes.
All in all .. Good Job!!

Food- we went for starters and tried the following-
Thai chilly fiah- perfect, good quality of fish too.
Dragon chicken- horrible, sweet and not well cooked,
Cheese chicken kebab- just edible... Chicken was hard.

This is located just below our office in Millennium city sector 5. This place is quite on demand for Friday's. This place serves excellent tandoori chicken. We usually go here to have tandoori chicken and drinks. The only disappointment is the service. Sometimes they have less number of people to serve. Sometimes the waiters are so annoyed. They even shout and show attitude. Although last Friday service was good but as usual they served the drinks and food on delayed basis. The 3 is specifically for tandoori chicken..

A pretty average restaurant located infront of the IBM building in sector 5..
We went in the evening to hangout...It was completely empty except one table which was occupied...They don't offer corporate discounts!!!That's the worst part...

For starters, we ordered

Chicken Mirza Hansoo as reccomended by the waiter...It was okay-ish...found it a little undercooked for my tastes...

Dragon Style Fish...This too was ok..nothing great...though the quality of the fish was good..

Chicken Lat-me-kai....Now this is nowhere mentioned in the menu but is their speciality as told by the waiters...It had 10 pcs of chicken was and was the best starter of the lot..

For cocktails,we took Long island ice tea and Screw Driver...both were fine..

PS-Please update the menu since it doesn't mention the cocktails...

Overall,there are better places to visit in sector 5 if you want to go out for a drink!!!

The food was decent to be honest. But the service was awful. The waiters were too busy with something or other. Had to call them thrice before one could finally take our order although the restaurant was not that crowded. Had to remind them 2-3 times to refill our glasses of water. The best part was, after we paid in card, the manager himself came and asked us to tip with a, not so convincing, attitude.

I am writing this review after eating about 7-8 times here and hence being a bit generic. The Chinese and Thai food is tasty here compared to the Indian counterparts. Thai Fish and Lat Mai Kai Chicken are a worthy try here ! The biriyani however is not recommended for sure as they serve the Southern style Biriyani.
The price is definitely on the higher side compared to the quantity they provide, but the courteous behaviour of the staffs and the ambience is what makes me go over and over again with my colleagues.

I have given this Restaurant a 1 for providing us some edible food, otherwise it was a pretty disgusting experience. 
The welcome gift, parking is available only for a singe car & the next available option is kilometers away. 
When we finally settled in, we ordered Chicken Lat Mai Kai for Starters, Burnt Ginger Fried Rice, Thai Fried Rice, Thai Red Curry, Chicken in Black Bean sauce , Chicken in Oyster sauce & Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles for Main Course.Once the food arrived we realized the portion sizes are really small. Some of the dishes were fine especially the Thai ones. The burnt Ginger & Chilli Garlic Noodles had no flavor. 
For desserts we ordered Gulab Jamun & Caramel Custard. The caramel Custard was decent but enough was not available for all in our group. The gulab jamun was horrible & any road side vendor in Sec 5 serves better Gulab Jamun than them.
Overall Not at all a value for money. Visit only if you have no other choice.

If you are not want to pay much on dinner and drinks today. Then in Sector 5 this is the place. The starters are simply amazing. The menu is well spread. 
But to disappointment the ambience is not so family oriented and also the fittings and fixtures need renovation.
It's a bit shabby but without doubt the food is lovely and and lip smacking.

Food and drinks are decent. But service is slow. Sitting booths are cool for smaller groups but the entire space is a bit crunched.

I have been a frequent visitor in this restaurant. This is on the heart of Sec V, so this is easy for the sec V goer to enjoy foods here even in weekdays. Undoubtedly they are specialist in Thai and Chinese. But I would not recommend to have biriyani and other Indian dishes here. Sliced Lamb, Fish n Chips were awesome. Last but not the least hospitality of the staffs was a real refresher !

Exploring a restaurant in weekdays, during office lunch hours, is very hectic... But when we explore BB's just in walking distance, that was so relieving... Me, with my colleagues went their, and had some wonderful experience... Food and ambiance both are fine.. We ordered Chinese items, chicken noodles and chicken fried rice.. Chicken in oyster sauce and hot garlic chicken were very good plus perfect spice combination made it yummmyy... Its a nice place to hangout.. I do recommend this restaurant for frequent office team lunch...

The fact that a restaurant still exists where you can have a good time listening to good music and having a good time with family was was completely oblivious to me. BB's is a place where one can go if he doesn't want to get disappointed. Food is of consistent quality, and by that I mean good. Ambience could be improved upon. The service was a tad below pathetic. The chefs cook good food but should widen their oriental menu. The lack of inspiration and creativity was clearly reflected on the good but mainstream dishes they presented to us. The staff should undergo a training, because they do not have the minimum courtesy to accept suggestions based on the menu. We had a nice time there, but I look forward to a nicer time in the future.

Horrible food. Even worse service. The guy barely understood what we were saying. Everyone tried to explain the order. Other waiters were only trying to punt to another. Then the food order was a mess. The food was even worse. Raw soy sauce and chalky tasting wantons.

We were desperate and so came here for lunch. We won't be coming again.

Located at Millennium City, near College More, this is a place to soothe your taste buds. Been here a number of times and haven't been disappointed yet. To start with the ambiance, its quite nice, with their special desserts all covered as paintings in the wall. They have low styled sofas facing each other as their seating arrangements other than the regular chair table's. Another attraction is that they offer "Chelo Kebabs". Though Chelo Kebab and Peter Cat is synonymous, this isn't bad either. But the ones which I am fond of are Murg Makhani, Chicken Lababdar and Muttton Roganjush, serving well with Butter Nans. Caramel Custard is one desert to try out. The Continental food served too is quite good. They lack staff, specially on week ends, though their staff is courteous and especially one of them named Amarjeet is our family's favorite. To sum it up:-
Pros-
1)Easy to locate.
2)Great Food
3)Good Ambiance
4)Good hospitality
5)Quantity and Quality complement each other.

Cons:-
1)Lack of staffs on weekends.

Advice:-
A change in their decor won't harm.

Been there recently and there is one thing that i can say about this place: Whoever loves Thai Food, Must Visit this place. The Pad Thai Noodle, The Thai Red Curry with Lamb are awesome. Spicy Thai Food at its best with a reasonable price for everyone. And the best part is The Drinks price is inclusive of all taxes!!!! Cheerzzz to that.  Seriously loved this place and the food. Must try the Caramel Custard. 

Will be visiting very soon with more friends. !!!!

And thanks to "A" for taking me there. Would love to go with you again.:)

Been there so many times but writing a review never crossed my mind. The place was once the famous watering hole for Sector 5 now lost its charm due to many pubs, night club and hookah lounge developed in close vicinity. Now even on Friday evening you will not find too much crowded.

We ordered various starters along with beer and cocktails.Chicken Cheese Kebab: Its no doubt still their best starters. Succulent soft chicken pieces with melted cheese as topping.
Crispy Conjee Fish: Though preference was the lamb variety of the same but fish was equally good. The crispiness of the dish was missing, bit towards soggy side.
Chili Sliced Lamb: Shredded lamb stirred with capsicum, onion and chilies. Liked by all of us.
Dragon Chicken: Chicken pieces were soft and the taste was also fine though better variety have tasted at other places. Which was most disliked here was raw uncooked cashews topped on the dish spoiled taste a bit.
Salt n Pepper Lamb: This dish could have been much better if the lamb was cooked properly. Not tossed well with salt and pepper. Obviously lacked crispiness too.
Chili Prawn: Taste was excellent but the prawn had tail-on which put me off completely.
Thai Chili Fish: They claim this as chef's special and you will not find them in the menu. Can be tried ofcourse as another fish starter.
Chicken Lat Mai Kai: Again off the menu dish and still fond the memory of the taste. Excellent.
Tomato Chili Lamb Dry: Another off the menu dish but didn't like concept of diced tomato with the lamb dish.

Main course we had Mutton Lababdar and Butter Naan. Lababdar is highly recommended and goes extremely well with soft flaky naans.

Cocktail and mocktails were disaster not recommend at all. Hard drinks price were not exorbitant. Variety of beers were decent and ofcourse were served chilled.

Staff was courteous but very slow. Bill for 6 of us was around INR 4K with taxes.

Ambiance is good,staffs are well behaved and service is very fast.

Tried Chicken cheese kebab,konjee crispy lamb which were satisfactory.

Biriyani was also good.

Situated in easy access  place in sec 5.

Bottom Line: Will suggest to go ,but don't expect something extra-ordinary.

Happened to visit it yesterday primarily to eat food for the sake of eating than enjoying a good time while coming back from a long drive. It was 3 Pm when we got into this restaurant in the middle of the modern office 'para' of Kolkata. Seeing the bar at our disposal we order for a round of beer and kebabs while taking another 5 minutes to decide upon the main course. Service was fast. The Indian food that we ordered was also fine. What surprised us was when this waiter after having taken the order and serving the drink comes and announces that their kitchen closes  at 3:30 Pm and they shut the main gate sharp at 4 Pm!!! I thought it would have been apt to announce such rigid timings before taking the order as we stepped in and allowing the customer to decide and definitely not after one settles down. Lastly, I had to go all the way to their back office to punch in the APIN required for Credit card transaction. Normally, any decent restaurant would have portable card swiping machine brought to the table these days. I hope the authority takes cognizance of these issues and fixes it up.

Visit this place if you are alcohol thirsty, else its a no-no. The food quality has deteriorated over the time, they discontinued the continental menu which was better of the lot. The lamb in oyster sauce isn't bad, and so is the Chelo Kabab. Yes, they do serve Chelo kabab even though its not mentioned on their menu. Earlier I used to like their Fish n Chips but now it tastes terrible. Their Chopsuey is also not upto the standard. Go for the caramel custard if you want to try the desserts. Service is quite slow, good if you are in no hurry.

Well what i like here most --the staffs will always give you a very warm welcome.
Food will be very average and you may feel them overpriced compared to the quality they serve--i cant mention a single item there which I felt was outstanding.
Drinks--if you are lucky you may get offers--but that will be mostly on low cost vodkas.
Ambiance is good and they maintain a good decorum.
Place will be too crowded specially on Friday s as expected, so better to avoid lunch time there to get proper attention from staffs.

Working in Millennium City gave me access to have lunch here every now and then.

The ambiance is great out here and so is the food. I wouldn't say its out of the ordinary great, but trust me, the food is worth every penny you spend out here.

Not only is the ambiance great, but so is the behavior of the staff. The service time is quite less and the quantity is great. Ohh and do try their Cheese Chicken Kebab. They are awesome.

Overall its a very nice place and does not burn a hole in your pocket for a proper full meal. It has been my haunt for lunches for quite a number of times in the past 2 years and I hope it will continue when I come back to Kolkata again.

I worked in Millennium City through 2007-2013...that is a long time eh? So you can imagine the countless visits to BBs. Well, to begin with, it has a very cool ambience, and the crowd mainly consists of IT office goers, so it has a bit of geeky sophistication and friendly warmth about it. The seating arrangement is pretty comfortable and classy, and service courteous. I used to love their sumptuous buffet lunches (@250 Rs only back in 2008). The Shahi Tukra was to die for...Sadly they have reduced the number of items now.
The Chinese and Indian stuff here is pretty decent. I am sorry that they stopped the Continental. The baked fish, fish Florentine, Herbed rice, Chicken A la Kiev, Chicken Tetrazzini were quite nice!
Also try their dragon chicken and Fish n Chips, the kind that you would down with a drink or two. They also have a bar, and have happy hours from 4 PM. So that's good news for drinkers.
The pricing is pretty decent. I just hope they would start the grand buffet and conti fare again. Bless you BBs, for the good 'ol lunching days!

Overall its a very nice place and does not burn a hole in your pocket for a proper full meal. It has been my haunt for lunches for quite a number of times in the past 2 years and I hope it will continue when I come back to Kolkata again.

I worked in Millennium City through 2007-2013...that is a long time eh? So you can imagine the countless visits to BBs. Well, to begin with, it has a very cool ambience, and the crowd mainly consists of IT office goers, so it has a bit of geeky sophistication and friendly warmth about it. The seating arrangement is pretty comfortable and classy, and service courteous. I used to love their sumptuous buffet lunches (@250 Rs only back in 2008). The Shahi Tukra was to die for...Sadly they have reduced the number of items now.
The Chinese and Indian stuff here is pretty decent. I am sorry that they stopped the Continental. The baked fish, fish Florentine, Herbed rice, Chicken A la Kiev, Chicken Tetrazzini were quite nice!
Also try their dragon chicken and Fish n Chips, the kind that you would down with a drink or two. They also have a bar, and have happy hours from 4 PM. So that's good news for drinkers.
The pricing is pretty decent. I just hope they would start the grand buffet and conti fare again. Bless you BBs, for the good 'ol lunching days!

It was dazzling when we rushed into bb’s for an office party last weekend. I felt a homely comfort even in the banquet space they have for corporate parties. The light was calm and the environment entirely suits with the graphics, decoration of the hall. It was a certain pleasure sitting on the couch with a glass filled with scotch.
There were stir fried fish, chicken lollypop, crispy chilli baby corn and hot & sour soup as starters. I loved the chicken lollypop. The stir fried fish was also up to the mark. I liked their not so spicy but tasty type of food. Yes, they are indeed very good when you are very hungry. In the main course, the chicken butter masala was so yummy. There was a white colored polao but unfortunately I don’t know its name, that was good also. Overall a nice experience partying in bb’s.

Sunday night outing ended with BB's as it was having different options mentioned on it's nameplate outside:) We were interested in trying some Chinese cuisine at decent restaurant. Mainland China was TOO expensive hence settled for BB's! We were not wrong.... first parking was not a problem even on Sunday night. Not much rush even though AC was not working at outside section hence every one was ushered inside. Our course was simple-veg crispy in oyster sauce accompanied by hakka noodles. Both were well prepared and portions were also sufficient. Crispy vrg was delicious due to mild spice and variety of veggies fried without much oil. Ambience was pleasant and comfortable. Enjoyed IPL match while dining. Only hiccup faced at end was bill payment by card took lot of time due to connectivity issue. If you are in sector V looking for quick dinner option BB's will certainly satisfy your need.

I've visited this place for a lot of times. . .
Have some added facilities here, so I have a bit more access more than normal customers.
We used to dine out and drink here any time..

Every time I felt very good and worm welcome from the staffs here . . .

Now lets come to the food quality..  that is good enough...
The Indian dishes are more preferable for me..
And specially the starters..

The must try items are -
"Chicken in Banana Leaf" ..
"Egg Pacora" ..

If you want to spend a good time with friends and colleagues after work..
BBs is the best option in Sec V area..

We went for a friend's get together party and were very much dis-satisfied at the service and quality of food that was offered. This is perhaps one of the very few restaurants that dont offer you a buffet. a-la-carte odering is very hectic and the pricing is moderate. Waiting time is high and the taste of food was very much average. A restaurant not worth to have a premium sector 5 address.

Decent food, not the old menu that I was fond of that had fantastic deserts and was a huge hit when it opened a couple of years ago. The food is pretty good but the portion size can be better for the price. The one plus two in terms of alcohol make it a popular choice for those who like their drinks, the seating is nice and on the whole it's a pretty neat place tucked away into the It part of Saltlake. Parking is easy to get and the food is not that great but manageable. I tried the chicken items and the exotic vegetables were pretty decent.

It's a nice place to chill with friends and grab a quick bite or a drink.

I have visited BB's on a number of occasions and somehow it has failed to impress. Food is just about ok and service is not their strong point.  I have sampled some of the Indian Starters and all the times I have eaten full meals it has been Chinese. The Chinese stuff is average .... the Dragon Chicken and Chili prawn are decent , Chicken Wantons are a tad oily but not bad. In the mains the Chicken in Chili Soy Sauce and Prawn in Garlic Sauce were nice with Hakka Noodles. If I had to rate it simply on the Chinese fare I would have rated it a 3 however my experience with Indian food was not quite so good. Paneer Tikka and Chicken Reshmi Kebab were what our table ordered as starters and the Paneer was under seasoned and nothing great , the Chicken Kebab was a little too pink and underdone for my liking despite my specific request at the time of placing the order that it was to be well done. When we called our waiter and pointed it out he was argumentative and said this was the way it was made so  we just asked for the bill paid up and left. Have not been back since ! We went on to have a very nice meal at Red Express !!!

This place is very near to my office and honestly speaking, my review is a little biased based on the fact that I have spent many evenings here, alone and with company having a drink or two. This place has a nice ambiance and the food and drinks are reasonably priced (also, they have some offer on selected drinks till 9 PM). My favourites are the Thai lamb chili tomato, which I find exceptional and the chicken drumsticks. The American chopsuey (fried) here is a little too sweet for my taste, but is decent.
Overall, a nice place to grab a quick bite or drink, especially if you work nearby in Sector 5. Recommended.

Went at 3pm.. just before the lunch hour gets over. The concerned person presented me with the cheque as soon as the meal was served and insisted me to pay ASAP. When I asked him to wait until I finish my dinner (Hardly 10 mins wait) his pitch was loud with rudeness and pressurized me to clear the dues.  Food was below average. Too much oil and less quantity.

Always been one of my favorite places to dine in. I am visiting the place for almost 3-4 years.
Ambience is awesome, you can always have an quite  and peaceful lunch or dinner (except on Friday evenings when the place gets full due to sector 5 crowd who enjoys their start of weekend).
Food as always is good in this place, no complain on that part. Their Chinese dishes are awesome. Service is also great.
The best part is they offer a variety of payment options which includes ticket restaurant coupons as well. 
Only thing which bugs me about them is incorrect billing. Sometimes they add extra items in the bill which you didn't had.
So while paying the bill check it thoroughly.
Other wise its a good place to dine in.

I needed a late night lunch and figured some thing in Sector 5 could be open. We found this place which is reasonably priced, offered tasy food. The decor isn't great but there were people in the place on a Saturday night, so I was assured we got fresh food. The food which we did order, chilli garlic noodles and manchurian was tasty. At under Rs. 500, it was value for money. The coke was not straight out of the bottle which was the black spot, if you will.

As I work in Sector V I thought I'd pick up some lunch. earlier I tried their kabab and it was not too bad. However this time I wanted something veg and the choice is nearly nothing. I finally opted for veg green curry. It was average but extremely oily. What was most surprising was the price. Rs.230 for a bowl of veg curry that too without rice. No wonder working people at sector V don't patronise it much.

Average restaurant... We had been just about half an hour early for lunch on a Sunday and the place bore a deserted look which speaks volume about its popularity.. however coming to the decor... pretty, simple and neat.. but nothing extraordinary.
Going on to the food would recommend Dal makhni.. after all it is one dish you cant possibly go wrong with.. all the rest was average..
A good place to go to if you work in sector 5 or live in salt lake but other than that dont bother travelling so far for food that is mediocre at best!

So if u are visiting in a big group with the difference of taste of food, here u can have all the types of food which are generally preferred.Often they give offers which is quite impressing.One day we went their & had a discount of 20% on our bill for just liking their restaurant in FB.

It was a a very sad experience when we dropped in for a quick lunch on a saturday afternoon. The food quality was pathetic- we ordered chinese and it was so salty that i could hardly eat. they changed a dish when we complained but that was equally bad. My wife is a vegeterian and her food it seems was cooked in a wok used for non veg food. It smelled of fish oil and when we complained they were not very surprised about it. I will never go back !

The first time I heard about this place was via a friend of mine. So when I got a chance today I went to try there Thai food. The Order I placed was a starter and main course. For starter it was Wanton chicken, which frankly felt a bit left out as it had less chicken and was more fried then to my liking. Then it was Thai Red Chicken Curry and Thai Veg Fried Rice. Here The Curry needs a special mention as it was the one dish that really Stood out from others. The Fried Rice was something which can be commonly found at most places.

The price was Reasonable considering the quantity that was served. Just one thing though avoid any drinks here since then you would not be able to enjoy the flavor of the CURRY. The ambience was calm and nice. But still could do a lot better with the decor part. 

Service was to the mark and prompt. Overall it was a nice experience. Looking forward for another trip to BB's.

The only place serving thai food that tastes like Bangkok food is BB's. I love their pad thai's and green curry. Their crispy chicken is notice worthy as well. While their food Scores the brownie points their downside is their service. I had once thrown a party there and they had FORGOTTEN to serve the main item! They had attributed it to some misunderstanding between us and them but trust me it was actually their forgetfulness that ha embarrassed me. You might think why I gobback there despite this faux pas? The food. Like I said, I'm the biggest fan of their pad that!!!! I'm salivating as I write!

Call it "The Sector 5's Delight". Pleasant ambience and wonderful starters. The Thai starters are well prepared. I personally liked  Crispy Conjee Lamb,Thai Penag Chicken and the Pan Fried Prawn. The latest inclusion in their dessert, Custard Pie, is also worth the try. 

However, the service has not been exceptional and costs are not exactly "Cheap". 
 
BBs Restaurant gets a 3 from me.

Not that much for their food.. but for their exclusive offers on the liquours! & yes, they make extremely good starters!

Try out their fish items.. its their forte! My personal favourite is Crispy fried fish.. perfectly blended spices with soft portion of fish fillets.. you will gorge on the platter more than your drink i bet!
They make good chopsueys also.. was not that satisfied with their prawn preparations though..

Their service could have been better.. 
And yes,they should definitely improve on their buffet spread.. quite an average spread, not very costly though.. foodies just dnt mind spending a bit high on a sumptous buffet, m telling you BB's!

This restaurant serves decent food at reasonable prices till you include tax. I ordered for a prawn pasta, fish & chips and a fresh lime soda. The bill came upto around Rs.750/-. They charge 13.5% V.A.T. and over and above that 4.5% Service Tax. 
The quantity they served was sufficient. Two thick pieces fried fish came with a dish full of finger chips. They served tartar sauce as accompaniment. The taste was good. But I have tasted more flavorsome fish & chips at similar prices. Somehow the taste of fresh good Bhetki fillets did not come through. It was good, nevertheless.
The pasta had 5 medium sized prawns, olives, bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, mushrooms and sauteed in butter and seasoned with oregano. They also served some extra molten butter in a bowl for added flavor.
Overall, the good taste and decent quantity made up for the high price.

1.Last evening we had Pad Thai...and I have to admit it was no Pad Thai at all. Just mixing some peanuts doesn't make it Thai....and I am saying so since i have had Pad Thai at Thai Express At Singapore...we were regulars...Visited Bangkok A couple of times ...and had their food..at places near Wat Pho...and Niras...have been to rest of Thailand to... So the taste actually was very very disappointing... 
2.I love your Chinese fare...specially dry chilli chicken, your fried rice...and long back i had an indian dish..with a very unique taste...i dont remember the name..it was sweet corn with spicy masala...
3.The service is good and so is the ambiance. 
4.The other point of discontent is...between regular water and mineral water...the choice is only Himalaya which cost a customer Rs 59. Isn't it a bit too much..?? In that case it could be more helpful if a few other brands like Bisleri or Kinley which i presume will be a bit more pocket friendly.
Overall I love this place...AND I know..what not to order..(Thai food)
5.The Buffet cost for a party is fantastically priced..with a huge variety of food  and Good Food.

don't be  confused  by the cheap rates  of alcohol in BB's  restaurant , they charge  27%  tax    ( VAT +  service tax  )  on alcohol . But i  rated it as  fairly  Good because of the  ambience, which is  pretty cool  .  food is also nice but as  everybody else has said  , the service  needs to be  quick  , try  out the fish items , which are it's forte .  you can try  thai too here . most of bb's restaurant's clients  works in millennium city specially IBM , therefore they can  afford to pay  27% tax on alcohol   , but if you  are not a office worker then be  wary of  the tax  .

I had Thai here, and believe me it was almost as good as authentic. Had a starter with chicken it was great, the last one in their thai starters options, chicken in banana leaf very spicy, served with sweet chilli sauce, red curry was nice too, the lemon grass was neatly imitated by lemon leaves.  Had no clue Thai so close to office could be so good.
Will go there again to try the Satay, pad thai and green curry.

Tough to get a place on weekends. A lot of space is unused and is kept for dining but the crowd comes to drink & bite on starters. Drinks are cheaper and the default snacks comes in the form Carrots & Cucumber with a tasty sauce. Food is good, specially the kebab platter is wholesome. Service is slow but if you are pro-active you will get your drink :). Point to note, they charge 23% VAT on the total bill amount.
