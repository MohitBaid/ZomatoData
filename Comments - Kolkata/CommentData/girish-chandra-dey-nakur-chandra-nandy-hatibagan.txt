I am yet to visit this iconic outlet but had the privilege to try their delicacies as a friend bought their sweets on a get together.

All their sweets are just heavenly in taste and also I heard that some of the sweets he bought were made by them only once a year so I was just lucky.

The sandeshs were some sort of revelation. Costly but taste is beyond comparison. All one have to do is to go there with a fat money bag and the thirst for sweets will be quenched accordingly.

If you want different types of sandesh, then this is the perfect place. 
Jolbhara was an absolute delight. 
The money spent was totally worth it. 
Looking forward to visit soon.

Specially in winter season they make delicious nalen gurer monohora which is truly delicious.
Other Sweets are equally delicious and it truly offers a feel of old heritage sweet shop with absolute satisfaction to your taste buds unlike some fancy glittery outlets...

What can be said about this place that hasn't already been mentioned? Sweets are heavenly, the best I have had. The prices in general are a little higher than the adjoining sweet shops, tastes are a bit better too (although personally I am in love with almost all the sweet shops in the lane üòÅ). 
One con I would say is it becomes quiet a challenge to get the attention of the servers when there is a crowd and it has happened that people who are there to buy only a few items have to strive harder to get notice of the shopkeepers against bulk purchasers in the rush.

Price is a bit higher but cherishing such mouth watering sweet deserves that price.
And a relevant info: please don't go here for any juicy sweet

If you are a "Mishti Lover" this is the perfect place for you.They only sell Sandesh but they have maintained the quality of sweets intact.Though situated near Girish Park and I live in south kolkata I often go there.Monohara and Jolbhara are my personal favourites they just melt in the mouth though they make various other sandesh too such as Chocolate Sondesh,Mango Sandesh,butterscotch sandesh and many more.

An evening in winter and you can turn your time straight back to that colonial 'Calcutta' devouring down a combo of Parijat, Monohora, Kaju singara and lastly Jolbhora Talsash....¬†

Well, Monohora was something I was looking for eagerly but unfortunately didnt have, but my stroll back to sovabazar was heavenly as I was busy the rich tastes of Bangali Mishti!

No doubt the best in Kolkata!!

The most renowned confectioner if Kolkata famous the world round for the exotic preparation of sweet meat. The most famous outlet is situated in a small alley called Ram Dulal Sarkar Street. It is difficult to decide on one delicacy because all are so wonderful.
The jol bhora, naram pak, gulab sandesh, butterscotch sandesh and the chocolate roll are the best seller. The disappear within no time. Besides these the flavoured sandesh like strawberry, blackcurrant, mango,lemon and chocolate are equally enticing. The malai roll is a must have.

Bengali is the sweetest language people say so being a bong girl how can I don't like Misti. So I personally fell that I don't have the audacity to judge their foods simply the Best starts with capital B. Trust me every one must try Chandrapuli actually every single sweet is best in their own way but the that is the best one.

Located near hedua. It's the best sweet shop you can find. It has the old Calcutta feel to it since they have not changed the decor since old times. Coming to the sweets, they only serve sandesh. I personally love the way they are blending classic sweets to suit modern day customers. The chocolate misti, jolbhora, kora pak sandesh is to die for. The price is affordable. plz give it a try when in Kolkata.

This place is no joke, and I am very serious. These people mean business. They serve up some serious Bengali sweets and are at a sweet spot where they just cannot be challenged. And these guys have been this invincible for over a century and a half. One visit at this counter and you will experience it for yourself. THIS PLACE IS A MUST FOR EVERYONE VISITING KOLKATA and would like to indulge in their sweet desires. My own story? Well, I come here to pick stuff for my cousins when I am traveling to other cities, and can't resist trying at least three different kinds of sweets on their display window. People pack serious amounts of their Sondesh for which they are known and now that WINTER IS HERE, they will have available with them Sondesh with gur(jaggery). Do come here to complete your visit to Kolkata.

Probably the best sandesh is available here, in Kolkata now. It's in a lane opposite to one end of Heduya lake. The building is old and this shop is below the gaRi-baranda. In the window and door opening of the ground floor flat , they have kept the showcases and use them as the counter too. You can see people preparing the legendary sondeshes painstakingly by the laborious traditional way. Quality of the paneer/chhena is outstanding. Best of the best. My only grievance is that they don't make doi. And also they don't have any seating arrangements. You have to take it away. Frequently there will be huge crowd and it's very difficult to catch the eye of the server from outside through the metal rods blocking the window. I wish this serving system would be modernised someday. I take sondeshes to Dubai and before to Saudi Arabia everyone I go to Calcutta. The cost of each sondesh varies from 10-20 rs per piece and they remain well for few hrs. Some can be kept for few days too- specially the koRa-pak. My first choice is the butterscotch sondesh and knachagolla and jolbhora and norom pak shonkho sondesh. Remembering it makes my mouth start watering. This is the classic Calcutta dessert shop. Nothing beats them.

Nakur is a delight to the Bangali sandesh aficionado! The outlet at 56, Ramdulal Sarkar Street is a pilgrimage to the sweet toothed gourmet. Ranging from the traditional Parijat and Sourav Sandesh to the contemporary Chocolate Black Forest and Mango Monohara, Nakur never ceases to surprise you.
If you are lucky enough, delve into weekly delicacies like the Posto Sandesh, crafted exclusively on Sundays or the Saturday-born Abar Khabo.

Born in a bengali household, who haven't tasted the famous nakur er sandesh since childhood. I always have been a true lover of sweets and sandesh and for me,  Nakur has given my dreams a reality. I am in utter craze for the flavoured sweets of them.  They definitely have added definition to the sweet throne of the bengalis.

Inspite of coming to Kolkata during my leaves nevwr been ti this place as it is in the opposite direction of my place..finally came during durga puja as i along with friends came to try out a few of there sandesh post pandal hopping.... btw this place is very popular as i asked one person and he guided me very well....
When i reached pabchami 4pm..luckily it was just 2customers and me....i looked thru the recommendations given by the people i follow in this platform and asked for the chocolate,jolbhora and monhara sandesh
Just lovedddd the chocolate variant, have tried many other as well which were very good but the plus point in this one is the price and the taste...the best ever...the monhara also was very good.not too sweet and a huge stuffing of pista and kheer inside ....i wnt name anyplace but what sets apart this place is the fact that the price tag they carry ....these are really dirt cheap and the same thing one wud get at 1and half times(at the least)in its competetors place....
If one is at the north calcutta definitely a must visit....

You visit Kolkata and do not feast yourself to numerous varieties of sandesh (shondesh, like we Bengalis call it), your visit remains incomplete. We Bengalis love our sweets and are extremely emotional about the sweet culture in our city. The shop located in between College Street and Hatibagan, more than 150 year old, is an iconic place to relish sandesh. There are a wide variety of sweets with delicate taste. Rich and creamy, it's a paradise for sweet toothed. The shop has an old look and you will be able to see the workers making sweets in a large clean hall. It's definitely a go to shop on a visit to Kolkata. One of my favourites.

Any sweet in this confectionery that you might try would be scintillating to your taste buds.I went to the shop today and requested them to pack 2 pieces of 10 different sweets that are the most popular. They charged 25 each totalling to 500rs.I also tried the mango malai roll and a type of makha sandesh with mango jelly on top for which I paid an additional amount of 80rs.Basically, I was either duped and overcharged, or the menu here needs to be updated with the current price.

Just around seven kilometres from Pretoria street.
A humble shop no tamjham of modern day shops,A classic display of their(how to refer)Prized possessions or prized babies,Hand crafted 24 carat.
Tasted some with assistance - jalbhara,chocolate cream roll & gur sandesh.
Carrying home some.

Only issue their assistants,But it's an issue which is there with some old establishments, the extreme passion for sweet making with an equivalent compassion towards needs of assistants,can make a difference,Perhaps.Just  an opinion.

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Dey , established in the year 1844 is located at 56 , Ram Dulal Sarkar Street near Bethune College is preeminent in the making traditional Bengali sweets with a subtle blend of western flavours.This sweet heaven gained popularity in the mid 20s and became famous all over india. This place received a boost in its status when Bollywood Acting icon Amitabh Bachchan hired the services of this joint for the wedding reception of his son. The silver lining to the cloud was when this sweet shop was hired to make a sandesh weighing 34kgs to felicitate The Kolkata Knight Riders.

This place never buys finished product as the ingredient for their sandesh, the processing is done completely by them , they serve the best quality possible and upgrade their standards with each passing day.

Presently there are 70 different varieties of sweets available for the patrons , some of the most popular are Chocolate black forest Sandesh , Chocolate Singhara , Gurer Barfi , Gurer Kanchagola , Mango Amrapali , Malai Roll and Chocolate Ball.

For varieties of Sandesh this place ranks amongst the best in Kolkata.

From childhood I am a big fan of sweets of this shop. It‚Äôs been years and the outlet have never disappointed me. They have came up with varieties year after year. Whenever I visit I can‚Äôt stop having more than 2 to 3 sweets at a time.

Now when I visited this place today it had came up with new variety ie., Dark Chocolate Sandesh. The owner was very generous giving the descriptions. I tried some of them and what I say the quality is just awesome. Each and every bite of the sweets are melting lite a butter. In one word I can say its butteryyyyyyyyyy.

Now come to the taste factor. It‚Äôs very much upto the mark and you can‚Äôt get much more than that. I can say it‚Äôs a Paisa Wasoool Deal.

Some of the sweets that we tried and they are:-

Dilkhush‚Äì The name says it all. Dil ko sach mein khush kr diya. Cottage Cheese (Chena) being crushed and a layer of pista was there on top of it.

Babu Sandesh‚Äì The sandesh having a inside filling of mewas and kheer. it‚Äôs really delicious.

Parijat‚Äì The sandesh being made by mixing mewas and nuts. Just awesome.

Black Forest‚Äì The chocolate lovers must try it. The sweet is made of a chocolate sandesh having a hard upper crust layer of dark chocolate.

Black Current‚Äì The black current flavor being added to the sandesh. Each bite was just buttery.

Dark Chocolate Sandesh‚Äì The best one I can say. The chocolate sandesh being layered with a liquid chocolate along with a caramelized balls. It was heaven. It‚Äôs a must try.

Thankyou The Foodinista for invinting us.. üòä

If there's one reason for me to move back to Kolkata ever (apart from several others) it is this place. Aha, ahahaha, aha. What sweets! Have had the strawberry and the black forest thus far this time around (my in-laws live a couple of blocks away, yeah I know, I got lucky, my partner is fabulous, and her house is in the confection paradise of Kolkata). I have, however, had almost every single piece on offer here. Facetiously speaking, this place is the cure for depression. Love the old-timey chouki-te-boshe misti bikri style. As Bengalis would say, hebby boss!

To start with, this is one of the most talked about shops in my locality - connection with Mrs Jaya Bachchan! I decided to try this out and i have to say, i was impressed beyond words! The butterscotch sandesh is as lovely as it sounds - they are a steal deal ! I had almost all the flavored sandesh that these guys have- orange, pineapple, kiwi, strawberry, blackcurrant! They also had these lovely black and white chocolate sandesh which were yum ! I packed the malai roll which again was a rocker ! Kudos to this age old shop !

Words aren't enough to describe this place! They are the undisputed kings of "Sandesh". We gorged on the Choco rice balls, parijaat and chocolate singhara and honestly got a food-coma! The Choco rice ball had a dark chocolate centre ( most other sweet shops use milk chocolates), the chocolate singhara had a gooey, soft, nutty centre and parijaat just gives you the comforting taste of pure "chhena" mixed with regal dry fruits! They have maintained their standards for decades and keeps getting better with every day!

Their sweets might look humble and simple, but they taste worth a million pounds! Their sweets are fresh and always made from scratch with the purest ingredients! This is the place to be if you like your "sandesh" delicious, pure and honest with a touch of love and nostalgia!

5/5 Because they are the best. No can beat them when it comes to sweets or desert (sandesh). For last 150 years this is the best place to have sandesh. But good things does not come in cheep so it's very expensive too, you can try thing from this joint, what ever you choose that is the BEST.

A sweet shop located in north kolkata...steeped in tradition. Most unimpressive looking and providing most impressive mishtis. On occasion days it becomes a huge chap if you decide to cater to your guests nakurer sandesh. I really cannot mention one sandesh as i like whatever is bought whenever. The chanar payesh ....uuuffff...too good. Nowadays they have increased their variety and you get modern flavours in sandesh along with the traditional.

When imagination intermingle with craftmanship, it produces such a result which carry on to serve and please people over time and in this regard "Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Nandy" is no exception. They are the master of fusing bong heritage, innovative attitude with fresh sweaten posset. For experiencing the mouth watering end result you must pay a visit. Take care and enjoy your desserts.

Bengali confectionery is all about various types of sweets. many desserts are fried foods made with sugar,milk or condensed milk. most of them based on milk products.many are flavored with almonds,pistachios & cashew nuts for the decoration.some sweets are made as a dry one but later on finish as dipped into sugar syrup mixture like very famous Gulab Jamun &¬†Rosogolla. another sweet product which is known by Sondesh also very famous created with milk & sugar. some of them are not very soft but some of them are very softer. you can feel the softness of the dessert which eating them, it will melt¬†inside your mouth gently. it is really hard to determine when exactly sondesh started referring mainly to the chhena-based sweet instead of the kheer-based sweet. but,commonly sondesh referred to the chhena-based sweet. it can be made with chhena or cottage cheese,one simlest kind of sondesh is makha sondesh prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. if you give it a shape of ball it is called kacha golla. chhena is dried and pressed ,flavored with essence of of fruits.sometimes even with the varieties of colors. another one which is my favorite one which is filled with syrup,blended with coconut or kheer ¬†and molded into variety of shapes. in the winter season there is another variant in sweet which is made by Nolen gur,made with gur or jaggery,the color of the sweet is brown or caramel color that comes from nolen gur. being a bong sweet is my first love. without a piece of sweet it is pretty much¬†difficult for me to¬†spend a whole day. this particular joint is very much famous for their sweets and the shop is very old. not only authentic and traditional sweets here you will find delicious next generation sweets. i was quite shocked after hearing that so many types of sweets are prepared by the sweet makers within no time.

We use to be frequent buyers at their shop as we use to pass by their shop almost daily. The sweet of their shop is amazing and the behaviour of their shop is also amazing. If anybody wants to buy anything from them, the customer should have time so that they can make your sweets ready. If the customer is 1 or 100 , there will be only 2 persons who will do the order ready and if you dare to say something be ready to face their arrogance. Basically customers are beggar for them they will treat like this only. Now days new trend has come if more than 5 customers you have to make a que,  when I asked them to increase the counter staff they start behaving like anything.

The shop is very renowned throughout the city. And their sweets are good. And there are lots of good sweet shops in Kolkata. What distinguishes one from another is the customer satisfaction from their products as well as their staff courtesy. Of course this shop has good products to offer but their behaviour towards their customers reeks of arrogance. I have witnessed the appalling way their staff had behaved with a senior lady citizen who happens to be a professor of a reputed city college. She happened to be our teacher. The behaviour of this shop's staff has compelled me not to visit this place again. I hope the shop's arrogance does not shroud their success.

If you happen to cross Vivekananda Road towards Hati Bagan and take the first left, you will see a row of sweet shops. One particular shop however will be hustling with a crowd across an iron grill. The hustle has been synonymous with Nakur for the last 15 years of my life. This is a North Kolkata gem. The shop only sells the "Sandesh" in all its fusion glory. The Malai Roll is a layer of Malai filled with Mawa and kheer then rolled to perfection to melt in your mouth. A lot like a divine malai-sushi with a lot more malai. The other items include Kesar Singara, a large piece of Malai make into a pyramid filler with mawa and kheer with sumptuous amounts of Kesar and sealed with cloves. The chocolate balls, or the Chocolate Monohora, as we call it is another fusion delight. It is the conventional Bengali Mecha in its Swiss Chocolate avataar. During winter, you get a similar one with Nolen Gur and that is divine.¬†Disclaimer: Try and be there by 6, things tend to get over pretty fast and you will be left with Sugar Free sweets and a few Kora-pak. They are delicious as well but one must savour the most exquisite delights of the shop first.¬†#Mishti_Mukh

I have been coming to this place since I was a child. Over the years it's managed to maintain the same charm of the "good ol' days" but at the same time evolve to make several innovations with sandesh.
I have been to 'Girish' as my mother likes to call it uncountable times and I have loved it each time ( okay not each time but enough for the others to not matter ). I love the jolbora sandesh and the chocolate sandesh. They have sandesh which is coated with caramel or gur or chocolate and they are amazing. Honestly, I could rave on about this place but you get the point so I would stop here. If you come to Calcutta this is where you should come to experience sandesh!

Do you know Bethune School. Then take the main gate of that on your right & head towards the nearest 4point, from there take the right & walk around 4-5mins. Then you will be granted to give yourself a sweet tooth by Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.

Love misti go there, fell fatigue with old style & taste you get then also you should check out this place.

They are running this outlet from 1844, so we can easily understand "Survival of the fittest". Without any doubt they are making one of best sweets of this town. But after looking this shop's look don't think their price will also like an orthodox type.

After reach there I waited around 10 mins for to give my order but that worth it. On that day I came to know there sweets are flying in various countries & outside of this cities also. As per the price they are giving the right quality & some innovative taste also.

Chocolate Singara @ Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, Kolkata ‚ò∫

This legendary and extremely popular sweet shop is known for it's wonderful range of both usual and not-so-usual aka innovative and fusion 'sandesh', the popular Bengali sweet, primarily made of 'chhena' (curdled milk) and sugar.

Having tried most of their popular creations since childhood, recently I got the opportunity to taste their Chocolate Singara.

By default, a 'singara' or 'samosa' is a deep fried savoury, wherein the bulbous and conical flour based sheath is stuffed with a spicy potato filling.

In the case of Chocolate Singara, the outer sheath was primarily made of 'chhena' and cocoa powder, and the inner stuffing comprised of thick and gooey molten chocolate infused with raisins, broken almonds and choco chips!

Needless to say, that it tasted great. 

One may not stop at having just one and one will feel quite filled upon having two!

Price: Rs. 30/-

Note: This sweet was parcelled and served at home.

Do you know Bethune School. Then take the main gate of that on your right & head towards the nearest 4point, from there take the right & walk around 4-5mins. Then you will be granted to give yourself a sweet tooth by Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.

Love misti go there, fell fatigue with old style & taste you get then also you should check out this place.

They are running this outlet from 1844, so we can easily understand "Survival of the fittest". Without any doubt they are making one of best sweets of this town. But after looking this shop's look don't think their price will also like an orthodox type.

After reach there I waited around 10 mins for to give my order but that worth it. On that day I came to know there sweets are flying in various countries & outside of this cities also. As per the price they are giving the right quality & some innovative taste also.

Chocolate Singara @ Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, Kolkata ‚ò∫

This legendary and extremely popular sweet shop is known for it's wonderful range of both usual and not-so-usual aka innovative and fusion 'sandesh', the popular Bengali sweet, primarily made of 'chhena' (curdled milk) and sugar.

Having tried most of their popular creations since childhood, recently I got the opportunity to taste their Chocolate Singara.

By default, a 'singara' or 'samosa' is a deep fried savoury, wherein the bulbous and conical flour based sheath is stuffed with a spicy potato filling.

In the case of Chocolate Singara, the outer sheath was primarily made of 'chhena' and cocoa powder, and the inner stuffing comprised of thick and gooey molten chocolate infused with raisins, broken almonds and choco chips!

Needless to say, that it tasted great. 

One may not stop at having just one and one will feel quite filled upon having two!

Price: Rs. 30/-

Note: This sweet was parcelled and served at home.

Happens to be one of the bestest sweet shops in the north. They have been involved in serving many popular faces of today.
We had chocolate sandesh, gur monohora and the jol bhora from here. They totally justified each of it. It tasted amazing and for quite reasonable prices as
compared to others..

Traditional bengali sweets and a bit of innovation.
This shop has been serving the city with quality sweets for ages and it sure knows how to satisfy the sweet tooth of the city. Try the colorful and innovative sweets for a change apart from the traditional gur sweets or the chena sweets.

Whenever i think about sondesh the only thing that comes to my mind is Nakur ,actually its not just a shop its a feeling. I remember when i used to stay in girish park i visited this legendary outlet almost every other day with my friends and we used to relish every bite of their amazing sondesh.You can actually smell nakur when you pass by ,the strong smell of chenna is quite distinct .
Now coming to their range of sondesh they have ample of flavours like mango,rose,ghondoraaj lembu,chocolate,coffee,strawberry,orange ,kiwi,butterscotch etc.
Some of my all time favourites would be jolbhora,coffee sondesh,chocolate singara,malai roll,kolapaker talshash,nutty sondesh,rose sondesh and finally nolen gurer kanchagolla sondesh.Now let me give you a lucid description of some of my favourite sondesh .
1.Coffee sondesh-As i am a coffee lover,this sondesh has to be in the top of my list. Coffee sondesh is normally available in the winter and most of the time its not in stock . so if you are lucky enough you would be able to have it.The softness of sondesh and the distict flavour of coffee will blow off your mind.It will cost you rs20.
2.Chocolate singara-If you are a chocolate lover ,you will love it the most.It has a filling of chocolate mixed with almonds and nuts.It will cost you rs30.
3.Rose sondesh-It has a flavour of rose as the name suggests. Sondesh is soft and flavour is also mild . it will cost you rs20.
4.Gurer kancha golla-This one is heavenly,it just melts in your mouth and it is soo soft that you can even lift in up.And i bet you , you cannot stop at one .You will feel like having it again and again.

All these are a must try and will nvr disappoint you.
And if you are a diabetic ,no worries you can go for their sugarfree sondesh.
Eagerly waiting for my next visit.

This is a very old and famous sweet shop in North Calcutta.
Staffs are sober and service is OK usually remain overcrowded most of the time.

I didn't visit this place in person but heard lot about it.
I got to taste their sweet in one of my family occasion. Each and everyone were complimenting about the taste of the sweet. Really overwhelmed to choose their product on our puja day.

Variety of sweets are available here...
I tried their

Jalbhara
Guti Monohara
Chocolate monohara
Nutty Sandesh
Mohini
Chocolate rice ball
Chocolate singara

They all tasted really well. Highly Recommendable ‚ù§

This is a legendary sweet shop located in hathibagan.I dropped by this place with few friends to try their sweets.Those were

‚Ä¢Jalbhara- This is the sweet this outlet is famous for and it indeed lived upto the hype.

‚Ä¢Gurer monohora- It had a caramelised layer of nolen gur on the outside with a filling of nolen gur er makha sandesh inside.Any word will fall short to describe how amazing this sweet was.This was an ultimate winter delight!

‚Ä¢Chocolate monohora- Most of the legendary outlets which are excellent with classics doesn't perform well when it comes to modern fusion sweets.But this place changed that thought too.This was the best cadbury mishti I've ever tasted.The dark chocolate coating on the outside was so good with chocolate sandesh filling. There was a crunchy element present in this sweet which I couldn't figure out but it was a nice addition.

Pocket pinch is very very reasonable yet the quality isn't compromised.Its top notch.No wonder why this legendary outlet was chosen to create the sandesh cake for IPL champions KKR amongst so many mishti shops in Kolkata.

The best Mishti dokan in Kolkata or might be in the whole country. Yes, you might think that I am over exaggerating but hold your horses right there if you haven't eaten the Butterscotch Sandesh or the Chocolate Singhara from them. One bite and you are transported to heaven. That feeling is almost indescribable. They prepare a wide range of sweets but my favorites are the one listed above. The prices are justified considering the quality they provide. Without wasting your time just head on to there and experience pure mishti bliss.

So if you want to test the substantive smak of sandesh then must try to come this place.

Must try is the chocolate singara and the kanchagolla - I mean they are both just out of the world. The malai roll didn't impress at all though. They have a variety of sondesh which can please every pallet. My favourite is the one with some stuffing in between. There was a rush outside even at a time like 11 AM. Most orders are for boxes, so it does get a little difficult to order a piece or so for having it on the spot. No rosagulla at this place which was disappointing.

Tried their Black Forest Sandesh and Gurer Kachagolla both are really awesome. Gurer Kachagolla very soft mild sweet and a mood lifting smell of Nolen Gur. Black Forest Sandesh Soft chocolate sandesh inside hard chocolate shell with rice crisper, it's definitely an ideal sandesh for a chocolate lover.

You can also try Talsash sondesh aka jol bhora, chocolate sandesh, chocolate jalbhara, the sarer roll and the kancha golla. The sandesh just melt in your mouth as soon as you put it in.

These people are not famous for being famous. 

The are really deserving. 

Many aspects are unusual here. 

Open making of misti 

The more than 100 year history and a great taste. 

Although some of the mistis are having added flavours but overall its a great place to have bengali style misti. 

Average price is 14 so within range as well

It was an experience. Being a hardcore bong, sweets are a part of my diet. Nevertheless the few sandesh (es) I devoured at this shop instilled a tranquillity which can possibly never be acquired by narcotics. There was indeed a certain level of ecstasy which rose exponentially for a few seconds during which period I kept on engulfing in a momentum higher than eating "fuchkas". After a extramundane "bhuribhoje" of sweets, there was indeed an emotional serenity which reminded me of the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha on the very eve of Maha-ashtami !

The warm rendezvous with the youngest generation of this topnotch heritage sweetshop having its only medium - sized outlet beside Bethun college in North Kolkata made my day even more grand. Our late Rituparno Ghosh had indeed done a great favour to the wedding of Abhisekh and Aishwarya Bachchan. 

Considering our hectic monotonous schedule, I can only comment: "Asche bochor abar hobe"!

As a bangali I can undoubtedly say that mishti is an essential part of our life. And mishti from  nakur brings life to our life. I have tasted every sweet there is on the menu card and every one of that seems to be as delightful as the other one. They have successfuly created sugerfree sweets which tastes nothing less.Malai roll holds a special space in my heart. I'd suggest that it is a must have

People say that Bengalis love sweets. But, here I am - the Bengali, who really does not find itself lusting over sweets. Sad may be, but, this is how I am.
However, few years back, I was loitering around this place for no apparent reason and the adamant friend of mine almost forced me to this legendary outlet citing the reason that KKR's victory sweet cake was from this place. It is amazing that I am writing the review for this place so late. Well, better late than never ;)
Approaching the shop, we waited in the line for little more than 5 minutes to get our request answered. We ordered for few sandesh-es (the names which I cannot recall) and the chocolate sandesh. Having tasted the sweets, I was indeed mesmerized by the unique and smacking taste which still keeps loitering in my brains.
The staffs in the shops are too kind and soft spoken inspite of managing numerous customer and their monotonous questions. After all, I am satisfied at this outlet.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Yes, you should visit this place to get yourselves surprised.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Well, I have been satisfied enough to give them high ratings. The chocolate sandesh was really impressive and I took a packet full of it home.

Well,this review is a bit late. But it's better late than never!üòÇ after 2015's puja festival, our teacher made a sweet-tooth treat for us, as we every Bengali do after bijaya. Sir brought the two types of sweets from this legendary place!üòç  one was the chocolate rice ball or something else, can't remember that exact name. But whatever it was, it tastes damn good! Other sweet was also pretty good. I'm not too much fond of sweets but as I love the chocolate flavour, I went crazy with it. Love it. Recommended.

It was an experience. Being a hardcore bong, sweets are a part of my diet. Nevertheless the few sandesh (es) I devoured at this shop instilled a tranquillity which can possibly never be acquired by narcotics. There was indeed a certain level of ecstasy which rose exponentially for a few seconds during which period I kept on engulfing in a momentum higher than eating "fuchkas". After a extramundane "bhuribhoje" of sweets, there was indeed an emotional serenity which reminded me of the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha on the very eve of Maha-ashtami !

The warm rendezvous with the youngest generation of this topnotch heritage sweetshop having its only medium - sized outlet beside Bethun college in North Kolkata made my day even more grand. Our late Rituparno Ghosh had indeed done a great favour to the wedding of Abhisekh and Aishwarya Bachchan. 

Considering our hectic monotonous schedule, I can only comment: "Asche bochor abar hobe"!

As a bangali I can undoubtedly say that mishti is an essential part of our life. And mishti from  nakur brings life to our life. I have tasted every sweet there is on the menu card and every one of that seems to be as delightful as the other one. They have successfuly created sugerfree sweets which tastes nothing less.Malai roll holds a special space in my heart. I'd suggest that it is a must have

People say that Bengalis love sweets. But, here I am - the Bengali, who really does not find itself lusting over sweets. Sad may be, but, this is how I am.
However, few years back, I was loitering around this place for no apparent reason and the adamant friend of mine almost forced me to this legendary outlet citing the reason that KKR's victory sweet cake was from this place. It is amazing that I am writing the review for this place so late. Well, better late than never ;)
Approaching the shop, we waited in the line for little more than 5 minutes to get our request answered. We ordered for few sandesh-es (the names which I cannot recall) and the chocolate sandesh. Having tasted the sweets, I was indeed mesmerized by the unique and smacking taste which still keeps loitering in my brains.
The staffs in the shops are too kind and soft spoken inspite of managing numerous customer and their monotonous questions. After all, I am satisfied at this outlet.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Yes, you should visit this place to get yourselves surprised.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Well, I have been satisfied enough to give them high ratings. The chocolate sandesh was really impressive and I took a packet full of it home.

Well,this review is a bit late. But it's better late than never!üòÇ after 2015's puja festival, our teacher made a sweet-tooth treat for us, as we every Bengali do after bijaya. Sir brought the two types of sweets from this legendary place!üòç  one was the chocolate rice ball or something else, can't remember that exact name. But whatever it was, it tastes damn good! Other sweet was also pretty good. I'm not too much fond of sweets but as I love the chocolate flavour, I went crazy with it. Love it. Recommended.

Had the pleasure of visiting yet another legendary a sweet shop last night. This shop, though takes a bit of effort to get to, but is worth all of it. If money is not an issue then trust me you'll love every bit of it. Starting from the mishti singaras, strawberry and butterscotch sondesh to the very famous jolbhora sondesh, all of them are just super delicious. If you have a sweet tooth then you might just lose your mind over the mind numbingly stellar mithais. I mentioned a phrase "if money is not an issue" earlier, that's because this place is not cheap. A small mishti singara costs about 30 rs, though very tasty but 30 seems a bit too much. Other items too are a tad bit costlier than other sweet shops. Other than that, it is as good as it can get.

Being from a bong family we are really fussy when it comes to MISHTI. Well this place offers the very best sandesh in entire Kolkata. The jolbhora sandesh of girish is absolutely out of this world. Girish is the ultimate name when it comes over to sandesh. They are the real boss.

That chocolate ganache covered one,which to my surprise DOESN'T have kheer in the middle( the ones which gives you an irritating feeling in your mouth and a true sense of guilt for the excess sugar) IT HAVE CHOCOLATE in the middle as well.

I will definitely give it a 6 on 5! I had heard about it so much, but never made it there till a couple of months back. I had asked them about their specialty, to which I was told by a fellow customer, that everything is special and that it was a very improper question!!! I realised where he was coming from once I had the mango sandesh and one other which I took back home. It might appear to burn a hole right through your moneybag, but the sweets are worth every paisa you pay! I hope it was closer to home, so that I could frequent. I envy North Calcuttans!

Had heard so much about this place on the internet. Was definitely on my bucket list on the places to visit in kolkata. Visited this on the first day itself and i should say it was disappointing. Tried all types of sandesh and I just did not like the taste. Maybe the taste slowly grows on you but I really felt it was over rated. Though i loved the chocolate one. It had some filling in it and was probably the best dessert of my entire trip.

It's a very famous sweet shop of North Kolkata... everyone knows about it... laid in the bylanes of Hedua... the front grill protection seems like we are in a jewelry shop... deco was not updated... they are trying to keep their heritage looks... Staffs are very enthusiastic and managing the huge crowd very well...
We tried some of their flavoured sandesh and also some jol bhora sandesh too... all are very good but not excellent or you can say it not suited by taste buds... no personal issues...
Pocket pinch was ok...

They really believe in 'name sells' and can give their customers anything they fancy in the name of 'sandesh'. Got a box of ice cream 'rotten' Sandesh and most of who ate threw up. Have been eating their sweets for more than a decade and the behaviour on complaining was also extremely disappointing and rude. Not going back. They have enough patrons one not going won't make a difference but really a turn off on the day of navami.

Bengal, the marshy tropical state of India has its class apart style statement, beauty definitions, intelligentsia which has unparalleled fame all over the world, and of course it is the haven for food lovers.You can check out here
Indian Bengali desserts your tongue will really relish.

This is an aged old sweet store serving us since 1844 with delicacy and dedication. They are the probably one Brand who has not jumped into the rat race of distribution and expansion through branches. At the end of the quality matters not the quantity.

"It is also tradition through generations. Every shop in the north has created its own identity and owners know their customers' taste buds. In north, most shops are old, and it is just the reverse in south," said Partha Nandy, whose father Pratip Nandy is fifth generation partner of Nakur shop. (TOI , 2010)

Recently few year ago they have introduced us with CHHANA CAKE which gain instant popularity after KKR winning their first ever IPL and so many starts including SRK along with our beloved Mamata Di celebrated our maiden championship by cutting a CHHANAR CAKE of enormous size.

Behind the green colored grilled counter of this iconic sweet shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street, the moiras deftly mould the chhana, fill it with crushed nuts and fill it up with syrups, to create the freshest and best ‚Äòsandesh‚Äô in the city. Nakur, as the shop is more popularly known, will want to make you taste each mishti on the counter. The classic mishtis are Madhuja, Parijat, a sandesh stuffed with pista and nuts, Mousumi, a sandesh layered with caramelized coconut and nuts, the syrup-filled Mango Sandesh and the more recent addition, Chocolate Balls, only, it is a soft chhana ball filled with solid chocolate and dusted with more chocolate strips. Start from the corner, have one, and keep pointing at more till you‚Äôve tasted them all!

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandi define the very term 'naram paaker sandesh'. Way before the evolution of all the fusion sweets, they were legendary for their jol bhoras (all year round) and monoharas (in winter). I don't believe I have ever tasted one of their creations and not liked it. Now with all the chocolate mishti competitions becoming so popular, they have completely revolutionized the concept of fusion sweets. Their chocolate sandesh, black currant sandesh and mango sandesh (with mango jelly inside) are absolute must haves. They have a chocolate version of the monohara, which is chocolatey and super yum. The latest creation is a chocolate singara, which has a chocolate covering shaped like a samosa with dry fruits and chocolate syrup stuffed inside. It is sinfully good.

THE best oldest sweet shop of North Kolkata, 5 minutes walk from Hedua (Azad Hind Bagh) swimming club. I visited here several times as I live very near to this place.
Every sweet has its own flavour. 
Recommended- Butter scotch mishti, Jolbhora, Chocolate sandesh. In winter you get nolen gurer mishti which is just awesome. And if its any bengali occassion be sure of standing in huge queues. One can also order 'Chana', its really costly but one will adore the taste of it.
Price per piece is Rs20/25/30. 
This is the sweet shop from where KKR took all the sweets when it won the T20 IPL series and not to forget about Aishwarya Rai Bachan's wedding sweets. It all came from here.

How often is it that you have sweets from a place that is over a 100 years old?? Fascinating right! After all Bengalis are known for their sweet tooth, does it come as a surprise?¬†

This legendary sweet shop is located in Hatibagan, it has stood the test of time and how! So many different variety of Sandesh, you name it and they have it. And they are all delicious.

I was there during the Durga Puja last year and tried their chocolate, mango and rose sandesh. Pretty good.¬†
What I didn't like was when I asked which one do you recommend, the behavior was rude and the guy said whatever you want to have.¬†

Anyway, do try out the different variety of sandesh. You are in for a delight.

It is a legendary sweet shop which has been in business for 172 years . I have tried their butterscotch Sandesh , black currant Sandesh and butterscotch Malai roll . The butterscotch flavoured sweets tasted awesome .
But the black currant version was divine .
Take a 10 minutes' walk from the Girish Park metro station and you will find this sweet shop which does not look too fancy (like most north Kolkata sweet shops)but you will surely get an idea of how popular it is from the crowd surrounding the shop . Price is on the higher side , but the sweets are worth every penny .

Kolkata aaye aur nakur sweets ka sweets nahi khaya toh kya Kolkata aaye! 
Aur agar nakur sweets ka sandesh nai laaye toh wapas hi kyun aaye!
I am totally convinced that the sweets of Kolkata are amazing and it took just one shop to convince me that. Nakur sweets was suggested to me by one of my friends and by the hype the name had already built I was assuming a huge shop and I was surprised to see how it actually looked like and how economical it is. So we tasted almost all the sweets they had to offer and I must say I loved the butterscotch flavor and the chocolate one that looked like a ferrero rocher. After tasting so many sweets I narrowed down on 3 and got them packed for home after confirming that they will last for 2 days. The third was plain sandesh. 
My advice: if u come to Kolkata visit nakur sweets and buy it for urself/home/friends and they will all love it.

A tradition, a lineage, a part of our history; this basically sums up everything related to a sweet shop, which is named as ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô. However unique the name might sound, it is their sweets that define this shop. ‚ÄòSweetness‚Äô is more of an intoxication, which is closely associated with people hailing from Bengal. It does not matter whether you have been born and brought up here, or have made way for educational or professional purposes. No meal here is completed without having a dose of sweetness being served on the plate. Whether, it be the sweet ‚ÄòAamshotter Chatni‚Äô, or a bit tangy ‚ÄòKancha Aam‚Äôer Chatni‚Äô; even if your mother does not serve you the freshly purchased Rasagulla (Roshogolla) from the market in the early morning, there would be plenty left for you in one form of the other.

Bengal has long been disputed as the holy land for sweets. Many acclaimed and proclaimed sweets have been claimed to be invented right here. Ofcourse, there are some disputes, with many people claiming otherwise, but then, in the current age, if there has to be one place which can be declared as the Holy Mecca for sweets, it has to Bengal. Be it a naming ceremony, a birthday party, a wedding function or any kind of get-together, no occasion, no celebration, no function can be thought without serving sweets to the guests or the people involved. And, if you are living here, one of the very first names which is undoubtedly going to strike your mind would be ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô.

Naturally, the question would arise! What is it that makes this place so popular? Is it the ingredients they us, Or the way they make their sweets? Is it the architects (Or as we say ‚ÄòKarigor‚Äô in Bengali), the finesse and expertise of whose that makes the sweets so delectable, or is it the plain humbleness and adapting themselves to the rapidly growing changes that makes this outlet so popular and readily acceptable to the masses? The answer to this should be that it is the combination of all of the abovementioned pointers. 

Located at 56, Ramdulal Sarkar Street, near Hedua Park, this place is an easy find. Ramdulal Sarkar Street otherwise may be called as ‚ÄòMithai Gali‚Äô, houses many popular and renowned sweet shops, out of which Nakur has to be the crowned king. If you are around Hedua, ask anyone where Nakur is, and they would be more than glad to direct you to your destination. Even then, for the uninitiated, once you reach Hedua Bus Stand from Hatibagan, keep walking straight and cross the park which would fall on your left. Once you cross the park, and reach the next signal, take a right turn. Walk for a few steps, and this outlet would be on your left.

Coming to the history, this shop was first established in the year 1844, by Mr. Mahesh Chandra Dey. At a later time, his son Mr. Girish Chandra Dey took over and the shop was named after him. Mr. Nakur Chandra Nandy, who hailed from Janai, married the daughter of Mr. Girish Chandra Dey, and eventually became his son-in-law. Janai, which is otherwise known for its delectable Manohara had already established its influence and very soon, Mr. Nakur Chandra Nandy joined the business which was already running strong being managed by his father-in-law Mr. Girish Chandra Dey at that moment. Being a railway addict, I have made several trips to Howrah ‚Äì Burdwan Chord Line, and quite often I used to drop by at Janai to taste the famous Manohara before going back home.  Being from such a holy place, the joint venture set up by the father-in-law and son-in-law slowly took up pace and since then has been running strong for decades.

¬†Coming to their products, Nakur specialized in making as many as sixty items, if not somewhat a bit less. Each one of them is a specialty of their own. However, if one has to cherry-pick, try their Monahara, Jolbhora, Chocolate Sandesh, Strawberry Sandesh, Dilkhush and other varieties. A special shout out goes to their Nolen Gur varieties, which are available only during the winter season. Nakur processes on its own raw materials, and hence nothing is bought pre-prepared from elsewhere. The shop sees heavy demand all throughout the day in any and every season and hence you would never find any unsold product left at the end of the day. This not only ensures consumption of fresh made sweets but also gives you unmatched satisfaction.

The popularity of this shop is such that, Mrs. Jaya Bachchan is said to have ordered some of their popularities on the occasion of wedding of her son Mr. Abhishek Bachchan with Mrs. Aishwarya Bachchan. Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar, Hilary Clinton, Rajiv Gandhi and other eminent and stalwarts have been awed by the sweets served here. As large as a 34 kg Sandesh was prepared by this shop to felicitate Kolkata Knight Riders in front of the Respected Governor and the Respect Chief Minister of West Bengal. The place can literally bask in the glory of their past accolades and nostalgic attachments, but such is the simplicity which prevails here, that makes them so popular and widely accepted across the entire state through length and breadth.

Very recently, Panchphoron was invited over here to taste some of the summer special mango sweets. Frankly speaking, my joy and excitement knew no bound knowing that I would get to see the entire process of how they make their sweets and later tasting the same. There were however, a few intrusions of sweets not related to mango flavor. Following would be a list of all the sweets, which we were offered as a part of the sweet tasting event.

1) Mango Singhara: Although not an Indian invention, Singhara or Samosa happens to be one of those popular snacks tried across the entire country with equal zeal and enthusiasm. A widely accepted food snack, ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô otherwise popularly known as ‚ÄòNakur‚Äô has gone a step ahead and left their fingerprints on this unique innovation of theirs. The pastry was gently brushed with mango syrup and pulp and was stuffed with finely made Mango Sandesh. The pastry was then rolled to give it a shape of a Singhara. There were no unwanted masala or spicy filling at the helm of the Singhara. The pastry was absolutely soft and the thickness was minimal. A plain and simplistic sweet, with a slight twist and turn, this one is bound to win your hearts and palette. 

2) Mango Amropali: First of the square shaped Mango Sondesh. The inner filling is of Aamshotto which alleviates the entire flavor component to another new level. The Aamshotto is topped with some finely crushed almonds. While the Aamshotto gives in the sweetness, the finely grated Almonds contribute to the nuttiness. A Midsummer‚Äôs Night Dream this one is, be ready to devour yourself and indulge into the world of Mangoes; courtesy: Amropali by Nakur.

3) Mango Moushumi: Second of the square shaped Mango Sondesh. Has a slight and subtle difference with its counterpart Mango Amropali. This one is slightly smaller in area, as well as in volume and overall thickness. This is a similar sandwiched kind of a sweet, with Mango Pulp/Mango Crush replacing the Aamshottos. The almonds also give way to Cashewnuts. This has a more liquidish appearance; however, if I have to make a pick, I would go with Mango Amropali.

4) Mango Manohara: Man/Mon = Heart; Hara = Lost; basically adds up to something or somebody who steals your heart away! A popular sweet from Janai, was probably introduced here after Mr. Nakur Chandra Nandy joined the business. The traditional Manohara has been innovated with the addition of Mango and named as ‚ÄòMango Manohara‚Äô. This one has a light and soft shell of pastry as the outer layer and the inner layer had a thick, yet a soft filling of Mango Sandesh. The sweetness was just correct (Maybe I am sweet buff). What surprised me the most was the thin pastry layer on the outside! The consistency and texture was just perfect, and to sum it up, this was truly a ‚ÄòHeart-Stealer‚Äô..!

5) Mango Jolbhora: Jol = Water; Bhora = Filled up. Logically adds up to something which is filled up with water.  Being of a mango variant, this one was filled up with a combination of Mango Pulp and Mango Syrup. The architects thereafter used the mould to fill up the gaps. The first bite was a mixture of the soft patty and thereafter, there was a sudden explosion of flavor, with the sweet Mango liquid mixture filling up the entire mouth.

6) Mango Sandesh: A typical Sandesh, brushed with Mango pulp on the sides and top. Tasted good, but was no match to the likes of others.

7) Daab Sandesh: Could not take a picture of this. ‚ÄòMalai‚Äô or Coconut pulp is used here to give a subtle but prominent hint of Daab/Coconut within the sweet. Mostly a sweet for fine palette and if you do not prefer anything strong, this one was undoubtedly an exemplary preparation.

8) Chocolate Sandesh: Picturesque and classy! Plain patty and patty drizzled with some chocolate sauce mixed together to produce a variant of matching colors. The pastry is then rolled into a cylindrical shape, and the inside is filled with a soft chocolate Sandesh. Without a shadow of doubt, this one was the best sweet for the day. The outer layer was crisp and the chocolate sandesh inside was simply bursting into my mouth.

To end, there is actually nothing much I could say more to praise this legendary shop. The owners are humble and the family understands the growing and changing needs of the people. They are interactive and make the people coming over to their shop friendly and comfortable. The highly skilled craftsmen are surely an added advantage. Artificiality is strictly a taboo here. The products are purchased raw and then processed by the shop itself. The ingredients used are of the high quality ensuring optimum taste and flavors. The lineage and culinary history of Bengali sweets would never be completed, without the induction of  ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô into the Hall of Fame.

Nice sweets. Went there for the 1st time and had multicoloured sandeshes- green apple, strawberry, black currant and butterscotch (you can guess which is which by their colours, obviously!). Enjoyed the black currant and the butterscotch very much.

It is a legendary sweet shop which has been in business for 172 years . I have tried their butterscotch Sandesh , black currant Sandesh and butterscotch Malai roll . The butterscotch flavoured sweets tasted awesome .
But the black currant version was divine .
Take a 10 minutes' walk from the Girish Park metro station and you will find this sweet shop which does not look too fancy (like most north Kolkata sweet shops)but you will surely get an idea of how popular it is from the crowd surrounding the shop . Price is on the higher side , but the sweets are worth every penny .

Kolkata aaye aur nakur sweets ka sweets nahi khaya toh kya Kolkata aaye! 
Aur agar nakur sweets ka sandesh nai laaye toh wapas hi kyun aaye!
I am totally convinced that the sweets of Kolkata are amazing and it took just one shop to convince me that. Nakur sweets was suggested to me by one of my friends and by the hype the name had already built I was assuming a huge shop and I was surprised to see how it actually looked like and how economical it is. So we tasted almost all the sweets they had to offer and I must say I loved the butterscotch flavor and the chocolate one that looked like a ferrero rocher. After tasting so many sweets I narrowed down on 3 and got them packed for home after confirming that they will last for 2 days. The third was plain sandesh. 
My advice: if u come to Kolkata visit nakur sweets and buy it for urself/home/friends and they will all love it.

Very few people knows that this place it located with the same decor,ambience opposite the lane of Hedua Park,after College Street since 1860.
They haven't changed at all. That's what I like about this shop. They tried to emerge again and again by being themselves. 
The sweets are little expensive than the rest of the other sweet shops in North Calcutta, but you can't leave Calcutta without having their Nalen gurer shondesh and other desserts.

Girish Nakur is the only sweet shop in kolkata that produces only Sandesh Items of varied tastes. No rassogolla, no curd and no snacks items like singara and the like are available with them . The items are all majestic in taste- chadropuli, golapi para, gurer jolvora, gurer/mango monohora,sarpuria,mousumi ,the different kinds of rolls -all are great to taste. Anyone with ¬†sweet teeth must at least visit a few times to taste their array of delicious sweet delicacies.

Are you a Bengali? Are you someone who resides in Kolkata? Even if your answer to the previous two questions is a no, yet you have a sweet tooth for bangali mishti then surely you have heard of this sweet shop. Forget even that. If you are a regular zomato user surely you know by now that this is the highest rated outlet in the city which shares the honour with barbeque nation. Not only Zomato, even TripAdvisor ranks this as the #1 place among 3723 places to eat in Kolkata. So what does this simple sweet shop has to offer so as to receive such a praise among the foodie community? To find out let's take a walk down the history of this shop.
More than a hundred years back Girish Chandra Dey of Simla (not to be confused with Shimla) started selling sweetmeats from this small shop. He was already making names in the industry when he was joined by Nakur Chandra Nandy from Janai, Hooghly. Subsequently Nakur Nandy married Girish Dey's daughter. However more than the marital relation, the father-in-law & son-in-law's joint business venture became the talk of the town. Their firm specialised in karapak sandesh (hard baked sandesh), however with time they have applied innovations & experiments to their products & garnered more appreciations. Not only Kolkata , their fame has spread across Bengal & even to the national level. Their patrons include some of the most well known personalities of India, like Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar, Rajib Gandhi. Not only a favourite among historical figures, recently the shop supplied chocolate, parijat & mousumi sandesh for wedding reception of Abhishek Bachhan & Aishwarya Tai. Kanchagolla & parijat sandesh have been gifted to US Foreign Secretary, Mrs. Hillary Clinton. The present prime minister of India, Mr. Modi is believed to be a fan of their sandesh too.
Locating the shop isn't tough. Locate Hedua Park, ask anybody, & they'll be more than happy to direct you to the shop, popularly to referred as 'Nokur'. Don't let the outside facade fool you. The shop may look old & shabby from outside, but even then the fantastic array of varieties of sweetmeats on display will surely impress you. The five generation family business is presently owned¬† & managed by Mr. Pratip & Pranab Nandy, latter of the duo can be found at the shop throughout the day.
Although specialising in karapak sandesh, the shop offers more than sixty items of sandesh including their specialities like Talsash, jalbhara, parijat, dilkhush, monohora & others. They boast of their product quality & rightly so as none of their products remain unsold at the end of the day. All the items are prepared afresh each day. The naram Pak sandesh has a shelf life of around a day or two, karapak upto a week, however it is adviceable to consume them at the earliest so that the intended flavour can be fully appreciated.

Recently PanchPhoron was invited over to try out some of their special mango sweets. It was a great opportunity to visit the shop, see the items in making, & have them as fresh as one could ever have. We tried the following sweets, & here's my short review of those:

Mango Monohora:
Monohora or monohora literally means 'one that steals the heart'. Such is the beauty of this sweet that the name is apt. Traditionally from Janai, this must've been brought to & popularised in Kolkata by Mr. Nakur Nandy. Now the original Monohora is already famous by itself, the newest addition being the use of mango to make it. Like the original, the mango variant too has a hard outer shell made from extra sugar, a bit too sweet for me though. Inside that shell hides the soft mango sandesh. Overall the induction of mango surely made things better.

Mango Amropali:
These are square shaped mango flavoured sandesh. Two layers of sandesh with a layer of shredded aamsatwo & bits of almonds sandwiched in between. As you bite into the sandesh the outside softness & inner crunchy almonds present to you unique texture, not to mention the mango flavour which just elevates the whole experience to another level.

Mango Mousumi:
This is similar to the previous one, only a bit smaller in size , cashews replacing the almonds, & mango pulp replacing the aamsatwo. This is undeniably a bit softer than the previous one due to the presence of pulp. Tastewise there's subtle difference, the woody flavour of almonds replaced by the cashews, but overall the sweet is as good as the previous one, if not better.

Mango Jolbhora:
The common Jolbhora gets a makeover, with mango syrup replacing the usual sugar/jaggery syrup. As mangoes are one of my weaknesses, this again impressed me as soon as I took a bite. Additional fun was seeing the item being prepared in front of our own eyes, right from putting the sandesh in the moulds, putting the syrup & then sealing the hole.

Mango Singara:
Not the usual fried snack with mashed potato filling, not the masala filling, not even the one with sujir filling. This one was mindblowingly made. A thin layer of sandesh modelled after the usual pyramidal Singara shape, hiding a filling of mango sandesh inside, & mango syrup lightly drizzled on top. Both the outer layer & the inner were soft, sweetness optimum making it the best sweet I tried that day.

Mango Sandesh:
This was regular sandesh prepared with mango syrup. Fresh & soft these too tasted superb.

Daab sandesh:
Sandesh made with grated coconut pulp. However the selection of the coconut is given importance. Not too tender, not too ripe, a medium aged coconut is procured for this one so as to make this irresistible piece of sandesh all the more mouth watering.

Chocolate roll:
Looking a bit like the chocolate roll you get to see in confectionery outlets. However in place of chocolate flavoured breads, alternate thin layer of chocolate sandesh & regular sandesh is used to wrap a inner core of, you guessed it right, more of chocolate sandesh. This one was another item I really liked. The fusion of chocolate & sandesh optimum, none overpowering the other. Surely will revisit for this item.

Needless to say, I really enjoyed this visit. It was evident from the taste of the items, why they are considered the best sweet makers of Kolkata. If its sandesh, 'Nokur' does it best. & Not only the original variant, they make the fusion sandesh as good as their unadulterated ones. For the syrup they use Alphonso mango syrup procured from Gujarat itself. Other ingredients are sourced locally & then goes through various age old techniques to finally produce the awesome sweets that people of Kolkata practically swear by. The methods may seem primitive, nothing is automated, rather relying on the skills of the craftsmen. Maybe that's the secret behind the great taste (or maybe they add some secret ingredients :D) . In any case the shop continues to uphold their name & fame, & keep doing so for generations to come. It was a privilege to be invited for this event & see the sweets in the making. Will surely go back for more.
Until then
Happy Eating
Cheers!

If you want raw Kolkata sweets, this is the perfect place for you. But you must have patience to get sweets. Because renowned sweet shop is always crowded. There are lots of options, you may get confused. Choose any, that will never disappoint you. 
NB: THEY SUPPLIED SWEETS IN ABHISHEK BACHHAN'S RECEPTION.

Purchased mango Sandesh yesterday and there was a hair inside. Pathetic, unhygienic. There is no lower option else I would have given zero star to this joint. Its a paradox that the self proclaimed number one sweet shop in the city is so callous.

Will not buy anything from here in future. See the photo yourself !

Bangali and mishti can't be perceived separately. Mishti stomps is the ethnic culinary identity of Bengal across the world. Ramdulal Sarkar Street is a mishtipoka's paradise. This place there, takes the level of mishti up by a notch to a grand existence. Their reputed aam shondesh, butterscotch shondesh and chocolate kodombo are the ones I look for all the time.

What can I say.....for me it's a connection I feel I have even before I was born.my maa had a craving for jol bhora talsaas when she was carrying me.
N rest is history I don't have sweet tooth but I somehow cannot resist the sondesh if it's from here.
And strangely enough I can detect it even without tasting that it's made here.

Kolkata is well known for its sweet which is for famous in the name of "Misti" among the bongs. And nakur provides the best sandesh in the city for years located in the very famous shimle para opposite to Hedua Park. All sandesh tastes awesome bt i would like to suggest ppl 2 try out monohara both chocolate and nolen gur one, jol bhora talsash, moushumi, and of course chocolate singara which is really yummy and a must try for sandesh lovers...the outside part of the samosa is made of chocolate sandesh and it has a filling of dry fruits churned in Hershey's chocolate syrup.

All hail to the king of "Mistanna" as I say to affirm the fact that this confectionary is from Bengal and is a pride to the Bengalis.
I had been personally visiting this for the last 8-9 years now and to my unfortunate self, I missed reviewing it. My personal recommendations are - Nolen Gurer Monohora (out of the world), Jolbhora, Chocolate Monohora, Blueberry and Strawberry Sondesh. Each and every sweet speaks firmly of the name of the establishment.¬†
Just recalled - one of my friends used to ask me precisely how do I rate a sweet shop, and my answer to that was "Girish Nakur is the benchmark" ! Hope it keeps upto my expectations forever.

This Sweet shop of North Kolkata is very famous not only for its old heritage, but also for delicious sweets... This Shop is situated just opposite of Hedua park at Hatibagan and 5 min walk from Girish Park metro station... We went there at morning cause I know that this place becomes very crowded at evening...
I have tasted 5 different types of sweets here ( Chocolate roll, Roll sandesh, Khir Singara, Pink Sandesh, Chocolate Singara)... all were tasty and mouth watering...
The singara types sweets were the best...
Price is same as of any renowned sweets shop in Kolkata...
#Best Sweets in North Kolkata and one of best in Kolkata....

Well, to begin with this sweet shop, I must  say this is one of the traditional and heritage bound sweet shops of Kolkata, specialy north Kolkata. Located very much strategically opposite to "hedua park" and beside Bethune college, this sweet shop has maintained its repute by delivering mouth watering and exceptional sweets that are famous all over. All of the items are unique to the taste buds, "rabri" and "chocolate sandesh" being my favourite. Being a bethunite myself I frequently went to this shop to satisfy my sweet cravings with my friends. The shop always remained crowded with people who waited to get their packet of sweets. Recommended to all [ except diabetic people :-)]

I was on a 2 day mini trip and i wanted to visit all the legendary places i could. This place was highly suggested by many people and even more by the locals. It is located quite inside and at the last day on the way to the airport i decided to go there. There was a lot of people buying stuff. So, apparently i was told this place only keeps sandesh and several varieties of it . I tried the plain sandesh, mango, blueberry and many others. The best andesh i have ever had was here.¬† In my personal opinion , the plain sandesh and the malai sandesh were the best. it was sad i couldn't take the malai one home because it wouldnt last till the next day tha tells how fresh it is made but i took all the flavours i could which accounted to half of my baggage not surprisingly.

As a kid, pandas hopping in the north was never complete without a round of mishti at Theo's legendary shop but now we go to nakur to pick up sweets almost every other month. Their chocolate strawberry and butter scotch Sandesh are to die for. Their Chandrapuli is yummy too. This shop is always busy and you would never get personal attention here, the old feel of the shop beings me back agin and again.

Everybody knows this place. Very famous. Awesome sweets both taste wise and look wise. I have a different problem though. I sometimes think that their employees are a little bit arrogant. Why I am saying this is cause they don't give that much attention to you for telling the price of sweets and all unless you are buying a lot of them. And also I think the background of 10 half naked men making and baking sweets aren't pleasant as well. Any way it just my thought. I love their sweets any way.

There that sums it all up. You can't be a quintessential Bengali with the famous Bangali sweet tooth and not have had sweets from one of the oldest sweet shops of Calcutta. And if you haven't, uhm what have you been doing all this time??? Rush. NOW. 
Besides the traditional oldies, try their newer fusion sweets. The several varieties of chocolate sandhesh are delicious.

A legend when it comes to sweets. The culinary history is not complete unless you find a place to mention about these two legends who had joined hands together to form what is undoubtedly the sweet heaven for the people residing in Kolkata. Located opposite Hedua and besides Bethune, this place is always abuzz and is hard to miss with the enthusiasm all around.

What should you try? Well everything! Do not even think of giving anything a miss here. Each of their sweets are uniquely prepared and have a taste and specialty f their own, not to be found in any other sweets. My personal favorite is the Butterscotch Sondesh and the Chocolate balls. Else, one can also try the Jolbhora, Monohara, Strawberry and others.

The prices may seem to be slightly a notch up, but one would never complain after having sweets from this place. There is not a soul in this city, who wouldn't vouch for this sweet shop.

BEST SANDESH IN THE BONG WORLD

TRIVIA- NAME
Girish Chandra Dey started manufacturing SANDESH more than a hundred years ago. Subsequently the late Shri Nakur Chandra Nandy joined him as a partner. Since then the firm became well known as Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.

SWEETS
This is the first time I am reviewing a "Mishtir Dokaan" but this place is far greater than just a sweet shop.
We dont live in Kolkata so when we come down its basically a frantic search for the best of Bengal in those few days.. and we did find a gem of a place around two years back.

Had heard about it a lot but had thought it to be one of those really hyped ones.

So the day we came here it was August i believe and it was afternoon , surprisingly still the counters could not be reached because of the crowd of Mishti seeking Bangalis.
¬†¬†
We met Partha Da (owner) who helped us with what had to be tried
1)Butter Scotch Sandesh - SUPERHIT The flavour and the way it melts in your mouth..Easily a competitor to Hyped European Milk Chocolates.
2)Mango Sandesh - Equally good.. with the softness and the flavouring done with the syrup was great.
3)Lebu Sandesh another hit with the Flavour and texture.
4)Black Forest was straight out of those 5 star desert chefs.. Perfect taste and hard on the outside and soft on the inside.
5)Jalbhara - Authentic to the core.

There were many others whose names i cant remember but each one of them were Superb both in taste & Quality.

They dont have any branches because Quality cannot be compromised.

The place were the mishti is made was really neat and clean.

A special mention for Partha Da who has good knowledge about what he is into and strives to deliver the best to the customers.

WHEN IN KOLKATA DO VISIT THE PLACE..

Cheers

This sweet shop is one of the few left in North Kolkata serving the best sweets. Located in the opposite lane of Hedua this shop is hard to miss as a big queue is always there. The shop is covered with a big green grille which I have been seeing from my childhood. No frills attached. They clearly know where they should spend their money.

My all time favorite is the black forest Sandesh which I always end up buying everytime I go. For 10 rs a piece it could not get better than this! All the flavors and types of mishtis can be tried and I can vouch that every piece will be loved.

I have a terrible sweet tooth. I'm a huge fan of rosogolla, the Bengali type, especially the winter specialty - brown nolen gurer rosogolla. And given that this *Legendary* sweet shop is the birthplace of so many varieties of the usual sweets, it would be a shame to not get a foodgasm by just looking at the chocolate sandesh or paan sandesh and rabri. Okay, I'm going in nostalgia; you just don't get authentic Bengali mishti (note: not sweets) with *that* twist of innovation anywhere else.

They are THE BEST for bengali sweets in Kolkata.Other giants like Balaram Mallik and Bhim Nag and even Makhan Das gives them.tough competition,with each having their area of excellence.but overall, they are the best.

A modest sized shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street,opposite Hedua and beside Bethune College,it appears more like a liquor shop with its grill facade than a sweet shop.But the buzzing crowd outside at all hours of the day will make you realise that you have come to the mecca of sweets.

What to try when in the store?Any sandesh for that matter and you will not be dissappointed.My personal favourites are the Butterscotch roll( soft sandesh rolled inside thick sheets of dry malai with caramelled butterscotch bits) and their latest offering,the chocolate dry fruit singara ( chhena coating flavoured with chocolate with a filling of honey soaked raisins almonds and cashews).They are orgasmic.

Reach the shop at 11 am to get these specialities,They get over by the afternoon.

Located near the Scottish Church College this shop has stood the test of time, earning it a 'Legendary' status. Once you are there, you'll find it humming always. A pretty old ranshackled shack though. But don't go with the look. The genius lies in their hands. The marvel is their creations. "Gurer jolbhora" and "Karapaak taalshash" are my personal favourites. There are many other items that can amaze your taste buds. Sweets made of "Guur" here are simply to die for. A must try.

Sandesh- that's the name synonymus with this legendary sweet shop of Kolkata.
Girlish Chandra dey,founder of the shop,had an extraordinary son-in-law Nakur Chandra Nandy. But Nakur was a lazy person,used to lie down everyday. On the deathbed,Girish called him and made him promise that Nakur would take the charge of the sweet shop.after Girlish's death,Nakur took the charge and showed his exellence in the field of Sandesh making.The sweet revolution of Bengal started with Nandy.

The college days memories bring a pleasure to the mind. This place is situated close to Scottish Church college near Hedua. There are many legendary sweet shops in kolkata, but for me Girish is definately the best. Though this place is not situated in the main street still it is generally crowded. They do not have any sitting place and you only have the option of takeway. They have a variety of sweets and most of them taste delicious. You will probably get confused on what sweet to try. 

Cons : The staffs are always arrogant. The place is difficult to locate, if you are new to this place.

One look at the shop and you would understand why it is under the 'Legendary' category!!

Located quite close to Hedua Park; this shop has been around since decades.
I have been there about 5 to 6 times and I have never seen it Not crowded!!

The staff is efficient.

Coming to the sweets. They are heavenly!!

Malai wrap; guler malai wrap; gurer jolbhora, rose sandesh, chocolate chocolaty ball (not sure if this is the correct name) are my few favorites.

The sugar-free sweets are a rage among all those diabetic Bengalis who cannot let go of Mishtis :D

Mishti-Lovers' Paradise :D

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:¬†
With so many renowned Sweet shops all around the city this place at Hatibagan Region basically falls just Opposite of Hedua park. With some fine quality and mouth watering sweets in the stocks they provide some excellent stuffs. Always crowded with people to buy sweets and sweets been sold like purchasing potatoes in there. With in my thoughts for so long finally i get to taste the few of them.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Its a takeaway simply.

SWEETS :¬†
With so many varieties and option in there it made me really confused what to eat and what to leave. So going hard at the sweets i decided to have the Gacha Golla, Chocolate Laddu and Gacha golla in form of sandesh.

Gacha golla was just excellent. It was so soft and light than it broke when i lifted it with pressure.

taste was so yummy and it was so fresh.

Chocolate Laddu was a good pick as suggested by my friend. It was hard filled with chocolate. Been kept out from the fridge for sometime it got a big soften but still was tasty enough.

Gacha golla in sandesh was as same as  like the first one but there was a surprise change in it. It contained the flavor of rose and the taste and smell could be felt beautifully.

ALL THREE SWEETS : 9/10

QNQ AND PRICES:¬†
Quality is very very good and a bit factor on the sizes of some sweets. Prices are fine as per the type of quality they are providing.

CONCLUSION:¬†
Always heard that this place surprises you with there quality sweets and today they surprised me for sure. Anywhere in the city you should come to visit this place once.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Well one of the oldest sweet shop in calcutta. Doesn't need a introduction the north calcutta giants delivers the best sweets and surprises me every winter with those delicious nolen gur's. Though the price is little bit on higher side but the quality taste and uniqueness needs to be paid a lot of memories assosiated with these and special mention the 'jolbhora's' they are best in class. Adding up to this having the owners son as a friend is a big bonus itself. Giving relief and encouraging my sweet tooth. Guys hats off....

Its a innovative collection of Bengali sweets. Their speciality is Manohara. You must taste Chocolate monohora, Gurer manohara etc. You cant stay back without appreciation. Norom paaker nolen gurer Talshah is fabulous. Butter scotch sandesh is highly recommended.

Price is bit high. But its worthy... :)

Nalen gurer monohora is always mothwatering and delicious. I bought this for 100 times minimum. But the pathetic thing is 3 weeks ago I bought them for some of my friends. then the quality was down dont know why. The smell and flavour was not equally same. I felt very sorry as I was not able to make them happy that time. :-(

My trips to my mamar bari in the area were incomplete without a box of these delicacies. Lip smacking sandesh and loads of sugary desserts for everyone available here. My personal favorite is the jal bhara talsash sandesh. If you are a typical bangali misti lover like me...this place should be on your list of favorite haunts.

Located near Hedua in north Calcutta this is one of the legends of sweet making in the city. Its been in existence for over a decade now and is a huge hit for all the sweet lovers. Over the years it has evolved from making traditional bengali sweets to fancy ones using chocolate, butterscotch, strawberry, black currant amongst othere. You can easily pick any sandesh and all of it tastes super. I can pick the kachagola and the malai rolls as my favourites.

Another legendary sweet shop near hedua park. You can't resist yourself from falling in love with the mouth watering sweets here. As its a very old shop you will find the kitchen on the backside of the shop. They use to  make all the sweets in front of the customer which is quite interesting. Unfortunately they don't maintain hygiene. Also slightly overpriced. But still one of the best Misti shop in town. My personal favorite is the chocolate ball.

Talk about sweets in Kolkata and you don't bring up this name is impossible. One of the best shops in town and doing things the traditional way is what it has made it stand alone in its own way ...the sandesh is best ones I ever had irrespective of what flavor you pick ....and don't let the old look of the shop fool you its the taste which will blow you away

Want to gorge on top quality "Sandesh" ? - here is the shop. Right opposite in the lane to Hedua Park, this venture has been serving people for years. Their jolbhora, orange/pineapple/chocolate/kiwi sandesh are awesome. The best for me was their butter scotch sandesh which I ordered too for my engagement. The quality of their cottage cheese (chhana) and the amount of sweetner or the authentic syrup that goes in - are truely to die for. Overall - Hugely recommended.
One word of caution for non-Kolkatans - don't ask them for any rosogolla or gulab jamun - Nakur is only meant for Sandesh.

Undoubtedly the best sweet shop in Kolkata. They have maintained their class, be it the chocolate or mango flavoured sandesh or rolls or any other sweet available in their shop, all are equally delicious. My personal favourites are Gurer malai roll, mango moususmi, parijat, dilkhush, gurer jalbhara and karapak talsash. A must go place for every people having sweet tooth. Forget the price tag , just love it.

This place already has a rating of 4.9 on zomato. So that rating speaks volumes about the quality and taste. Absolutely delicious - are the Sandesh 's here.

The jalbhara or the gur monohara are yum.

One feedback ¬†: try starting rosogulla or rasmalai or baked rosogulla.

Otherwise, maybe the best sweet shop in town. Its not everyday that you have to stand in a queue to get the sweets from a sweet shop. So this shop has arrived. Wonder why its 4.9 and not 5 on Zomato already !!

There are sweet shops, and then there are sweet shops. Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy is certainly one of the best of the lot. Even for someone who is not a big fan of "mishti", I am drawn to this place, just off Bidhan Sarani, time and time again for its mouthwatering array of sandesh. The sandesh are astonishingly smooth in texture, no lump or grittiness in sight. And the flavours are marvellous, ranging from the classics like kanchagolla and korapak to innovative flavours like strawberry, blackcurrant, butterscotch and chocolate., which actually do taste like what they are supposed to. I particularly like their Gurer Monohora, comprising a thin brittle shell of jaggery encasing a rich and wonderfully soft kanchagolla like mixture inside. No wonder you never find this place without a crowd. It is a must-visit for all sweet lovers.

The 4.5 rating is just would be described as a nakhra :P Their sweets are simple awesome and by sweet i should say sandesh. My personal favourite is black current sandesh but i would request anyone living in¬† bengal or and outsider to go there with a big appetite and try their sandeshes one after another . Forget the price tag , just go for the awesomeness.

A must for every people who has a sweet tooth :)

1)Ambiance(0.5/1): Being one of the most loved sweet shops in my home (have been eating from here since quite some time now), they really need to up their ambiance now! the most attractive part of their shop(apart from the sweets of course)? that huge photo frame of KKR team, SRK, Juhi chawla and Mamata "didi" cutting a cake prepared by them!

2) Food (1/1): this IS their strength and our family, our family friends - all of us LOVE their sweets! this time they introduced their MISHTI SHINGARA (Sweet Samosas). DELICIOUS is the word! Right amount of sweetness, resembling our good old samosa and filled with dry fruits inside - it was marvelous! Loved it! They have a chocolate variation as well but we were too full after a family foodathon! :P

3) Service (0.5/1) : I really wish their service was as good as their products! They were impolite to us , in spite of us waiting in line for over 15 minutes to eat their sweets. They basically need to work on their crowd management skills and I'm sure they will be perfect :)

4) Innovation/techniques (1/1): Sweet samosa - I think it's an innovation by itself!¬†

5) VFM (1/1) : They are a little more expensive as compared to the other sweet shops but their products are definitely worth the money! Dry fruits filed sweet samosa (decent size) was Rs.35/- per piece. I was happy to pay it and eat it up! :) I would have given them a 4.5 but service does matter. I am sure they will keep making many more yummy treats for their customers!

A waiting for sweets always remains sweet no matter how long the queue is. An age old sweet shop still is the king, Nakur, lives in every bong's heart in every occasion. Their classics Parijat, Kanchagolla, Jolvora Talsansh remain unbeatable. Other than their hyped chocolate preparations, try Coffee and Mulberry. And also the Apple sondesh and Nutties are worth trying.

No complains regarding the taste, size or quality of the sweets. Simply awesome. I felt the price was also okay, considering the really good quality of the sweets. But they should do something about the service. Its a very busy shop, so they should really consider to prep up the service! Anyways, my  fave was the chocolate ball and the butterscoth sandesh and..okay, I loved all the 10 variety of sweets I had bought. One thing that put me off though, was the condition of the workplace of the shop, it is visible from the place where you order for the sweets. I feel, the place where food is prepared must be spic and span, but it looked quite dirty from outside.

I had strawberry and chocolate sondesh and they were very good. The quality speaks for itself after you take a bite. I should mention the chocolate sondesh again and again as I have never tasted chocolate which is so good. For exciting the taste buds of someone who is averse to sweets, you guys deserve this rating.

Catering to wide range of human palates, and most importantly emotions, it has the sweet for simply every occasion. A light after lunch sweet? Sure. A mid day lazy feeling sweet? Sure. Want to pig out on sweets sweet? Got your back jack. Post break up blues sweet? Anytime bro. I wouldn't go on to comment about the delectable nature of the sweets or the fact that each one is a winner in itself. Add to it, the fact that it has a quaint old calcutta charm woven over it. Those shops you remember your grandmother taking you to and buying sweets and you returning with the "best day ever" smile all over your face. This one will remain in my boom dotted with stars all over. 
Thank you GCDNCN

I'm a little ashamed to admit that I wasn't aware of this place until recently when I was looking up places to eat in around Shobha Bazaar on Zomato, while planning a day out during Durga pujo this year.

The fact that it was established in 1844 is enough to get anyone curious. The high ratings on Zomato were also reassuring. So we went down there early in the morning of Bijoya Dashami, as testament to our Bangali heritage.¬†

I'd expected a bigger, shinier and grander spread of extravagantly priced sweets much like you'd find in one of the branches of the big names in the mishti business. Sitting in a line of sweet shops, the modest green iron-grilled window was surprising. Inside, you could see some of the staff still asleep, their sheets drawn around them. The walls were old and blackened with age and filled with framed pictures of garlanded deities, cricketers and politicians with their custom-made sweet spreads. Among all this was also a newer, brighter framed request for a Zomato review.¬†

Even at 7 in the morning, there was quite a crowd outside the shop. We picked up what looked most tempting, and as we later found out was one of their specialties, their chocolate mishtis.¬†

This sweet shop reminded me of many other sweet shops. Half remembered memories of mihidana and gujia bought at old shops in a little town with my grandfather or the rosogolla and barfi I had with my friends just yesterday at the air-conditioned shop near the university, I forget which.¬†

The great thing about Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, apart from its delightfully long name, is that it is as if of the old world adapted to the new, much like the city it belongs to.

Another heritage on the department of confectionery... This place is a pride of Calcutta, more so for the North Calcuttans... the place which had provided for sands in the marriage if Abhishek and Aishwarya or for that matter, invented the sandake for kkr's victory in the Ipl, is a must visit if you are in calcutta. Try out the chocolate sandesh for a fabulous experience.

Humble outlet in a quiet lane but truly fantastilicious sandeshes. The sale is made through the grill covering a large window with customers crowding on the footpath. Last evening was not very busy so snatched the opportunity to try out 1 piece of each sandesh. Truly loved each one of them. The sweets were of the right texture and had the precise measure of sweetness. Each one - chocolate, strawberry, butterscotch - melted smoothly in the mouth leaving me yearning for more. Try the Malai Roll here which is best amongst equals. Kudos to this place! I shall be back for more

Well sandesh is not realy my cup of tea ......... But one fine day i was in north kolkata with one of my close friend nd he knows dat i love sweets but i don't like sandesh..... so he pursuaded me to just have one bite of sandesh from dis shop nd so i did went for one bite ....... But it was not my last bite it ended up me having 4 pieces of sandesh...... it was like i m into some kind of drug which is so much addictive dat i was not able to stop my self ........ so hats off to such a great sweet shop...... But as i say flavour, taste varies from person to person so plz do give it a try...

Personally I am a traditionalist.i believe Bengali heritage of sweets should broadly stick with "chaana". So whatever experimentation they should do the base should be "chaana". That's where Nakur Nandy and his legendary sweet shop comes in the picture. They are indeed high on the price so are many other sweet stores these days.
The main aspect is what you get for the price.if you ask them to suggest a sweet which you can savor for a week the answer will be none. They always suggest for immediate consumption in one day because they know how delicate these sweets are. And trust me you won't be able to stop yourself from consuming in one day üòä

The best Shandesh outlet in the city, the Chocolate and Wgite Chocolate Monohoras being the best of the lot. 

I am not a person with a sweet tooth, and yet this outlet is the only one in the entire city, which I think I can say has this foodgasmic quality, which any other food shop in the entire city lacks, and this is, keeping in mind,the fact that Kolkata has some of the widest range of food that anyone can find across the length and breadth of the country.

They are the Batman of Bengali Sandesh.¬†

Only, I wish they had their shop a bit more done according to the modern sensibilities and the staffs were a bit more courteous- may be these lack of nouvelle concepts are what makes them what are they now, and that is pretty good- considering Calcutta is a place for best Sandesh and Mishti.

I've always heard of this place from my father as the best sweet shop in kolkata. A city which is particularly known for its sweets, existed a shop which further enriches one's experience of having these delicacies. 
Mango monohora, chocolate sondesh, butterscotch sondesh, malai roll..the list is endless. Each and every item on display should be tried. 
This shop has been featured on n number of food shows and they also catered for bachhan junior wedding. 
This one shall always be counted as my favorite dessert place. üíù

This place was, is and will remain the best bengali sweet shop. There's not a thing about them, which one can complain about. Their chocolate balls are to die for, and the melt-in-your-mouth sandesh coated with jaggery is a bunch of wholesome goodness. Their innovative attempts such as the strawberry sandesh, black current sandesh and mango sandesh are as delicious as the traditional delights like the tal-shash. When you'll visit this place, you'll just be pampered with choices, and be overwhelmed by the variety they have to offer.

Nakur, as it is popularly known as amazes me with one particular characteristic. How do they keep doing it for generations after generations?
They are the best innovators, creators, makers of Sandesh in the world. The Butter Scotch Sandesh is my personal favourite but with this sweet shop anything and everything is one's favourite.
To sum it up Nakur is not an eatery or a sweet shop, it is an institution.

Girish Ch Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy
Well i guess i wont be wrong if i say that i have grown up eating their sandesh and my day doesnt get complete if i dont eat girish ch deys sandesh everyday . i believe the quality they provide  can never be compared to any of the sweet shops in kolkata..You can say there is a complete transformation of the variety they provide Starting from my school days when they doesnt use to have much varieties but was very much popular for their Gulab Patti Sandesh till now when they have multiple varieties all of them are simply delicious..
My entire family being a sweet lover we are very fond of their sweets and i guess i have tried all of the varities made by them..My all time favourite are their Pineapple Sandesh,Butter Scotch,Straweberry,
Gulab patti,Nariyal Sandesh & many more...
During winters thier Nolen Gur Kocha Gola and their Taalsha Sandesh with Nolen Gur are my all time favourite..I have made all my relatives taste their sandesh and they are very very fond of them...
My relatives who stay outside kolkata are also very fond of its sweets because of the superb quality and delicious taste because i make it a point to send them their sweets because i dont want my friends and relatives to miss something really worth while..
Keep up the quality and we are waiting for the new & innovative varities of your sweets...

The popularity of Nakur is justified by its sweets which any sweet lover will love. It goes without doubt that they are highly priced but the quality and taste of sweets beat all others. On a recent visit i found an addition to their array of sweets, a chocolate singara, which had a soft chocolate crust and nuts and molten chocolate inside. Nakur incessantly goes on experimenting with various combinations of sweet flavours to bring out new sweets. And it does that ever so successfully, a reason why it is so highly praised. Popular picks among frequent buyers are golapi pera, chocolate sandesh, parijat amongst others.

The one & only sweet shop in Kolkata, probably in the whole world who experiments & plays with sweets in extreme enthusiasm levels. They tried to mix some sweets with some other sweets for example Jelly with Curd or Sandesh in some extraordinary levels that you can't even imagine. Those experiments not just gets the success they also provide satisfaction to each & every persons mouth, doesn't matter the person like sweets or not. This sweets tastes so great that words can't explain. This sweets are meant to be feeled by the mouth & soul of your heart. Undoubtedly this is the best ever sweet shop in Kolkata. The only bad thing over here is the price, if you count this as bad. But every rare artwork comes with a price tag & this sweets are none less than an artwork.
Conclusion : Hands down, No comparison, The best ever sweet shop in Kolkata. Every sweet lover over there are missing their real goal if they haven't tried this one.

I simply LOVE their mishti. In this street their are other three top sweet shops but this has easily made their own identity with their variety. Though price is little high the quality is best. They only make sandesh which are best in Kolkata. They offer a large variety as well as flavours and they make many sweets sugar free. Personally I love their chocolate mishties specially Dark Fantasy...yummy!!! Please if you have not been here visit this place as early as possible...trust me you will not regret.

It is beautiful how the gud oozing out from the middle of the sandesh and a tiny piece of caramel atop the strawberry sandesh add so much to the sweets. The chocolate ball comes a far second when in competition with these superb creations.

Sweets---Their sweets are the best in Kolkata if not in West Bengal as a whole...try their choco rabri,blueberry sandesh,chocolate sandesh,pista sandesh and get lost in pure bliss..quality is no1
Cost--a bit on higher side...quality sweets cost all least Rs 20
I run to the place whenever my tongue craves for some sweetness...and the rest is...well try it for yourselves...

The best sweet shop in Kolkata (if not in the whole world). Period. These people have taken the art of sweet making to a whole new level. The richness of flavour and the overall quality are almost unparalleled. Close your eyes and take a pick ... you cannot go wrong in Nakur (as we refer to this shop in short). Add to it the odd charm of a zero-bling get up of a typical north Calcutta shop.

Their customers database includes celebrities from India and abroad but that does not mean that a common man can get impressed.They are them selves celebrity among the confectioners from city of Joy.
I wanted to see badly, what makes Nokur Sweets so special? Why people are mad for them?Why people across globe drools through the green grill on a negligible glass case where there are way more good looking sweetshops across Kolkata.What is Nokur's way?I Got the answer after I tasted one sweet.Oh my God!!!These people play with your taste bud which leaves a deep impression in a sweet tooth's mind. 
I stay alone,still I bought almost 20 sweets.
Its twisted, kind of new wine in old bottles.
Standing in the amalgamation of Web age and a traditional old Kolkata Nokur stands firm with their products.Trade mark.
Never imagined that Sondesh can meet butter scotch, black currant , strawberry, mango ... Sondesh can stay within a dark chocolate wrapper. Feeling Intoxicated.
Another from my bucket list - met.
All the best.Keep blessing us.

Chocolate rolls are yum.
The best is Sandesh and that too butterscotch (mouth watering really)

I think they are the pioneers of chocolate sandesh...this is the oldest sweet shop located near hedua
Though they are famous for chocolate sandesh my favourite is narkel sandesh.....I also like a karapak sandesh filled with kheer and dry fruits  but I don't know its name

They might be over priced but the taste of their sweets is unparalleled. Their fusion sweets have always been a hit. I recently had their chocolate malai roll. They were Rs. 20 a piece but well worth the price. They one of the oldest  sweet shops in Kolkata and have built a reputation for serving only sandesh. There are no "rosh er Misti" available. If you're looking for rosogollas and ladygennis then don't come here. But if you want the best "sandesh" look no further.

They serve the best sandesh in Kolkata. The jolbhora, strawberry sandesh, chocolate sandesh are simply their best. I just love eating out there often because it's nearby my college. Nakur deserves to be one of the bets sweetshops in Kolkata. Truly.

The sweets are made to suit the sweet tooth of 19th century Bangali babu. Same taste, same flavour and definitely not too syrupy. The jalbhoras and the naram paks and the rasogollas and Khajas made on special occasions are too good and mouth licking in nature.

The Hedua area is one of those pockets of Kolkata which has a spin of its own‚Äî a calmer orbit inside the earth's blue whirl. Meters away, the busy north Kolkata traffic is like a crazy beast, growling for attention.  The 150-year-old sweet shop, Nakur, fits into the picture like the piece that completes a jigsaw puzzle. It‚Äôs a hole-in-the-wall, quite literally. The old-fashioned glass display counter has heaps of ¬†choloate sandesh, raspberry sandesh and butterscotch barfis ‚Äì culinary achievements  that have grabbed headlines across the city for the past few years.
Though it‚Äôs difficult to pick a favourite from Nakur‚Äôs wide array of sandeshs, one can of course wax eloquent about its most popular products. The choco-chip sandesh is a delightful play of textures where the smoothness of the cottage cheese blends in perfectly with rich granules of dark chocolate. The raspberry sandesh is another successful innovation, an gentle gush of tangy raspberry preserve greets you once you bite into the sandesh. You can also try more traditional items like Parijat, which is a pistachio-flavoured sandesh.

The must-visit sweet shop in Kolkata -this place out dishes out some of the best sweets in the city. The location is a bit busy part of town but the sweets will have more than made up for your ordeals. Have a korapaak or a taalshash if you want to go traditional or opt for the ferrero rocher sandesh or the chocolate puli if you are in an experimental mood. It will all be worth it. Eternal bliss!

The name itself is self explanatory. A legendary place for non-Bengalis to learn why we take pride in our Sandesh. It is one of the great 'Mistir Dokan' Kolkata has to offer. The sweets are as tasty as they get, they come in a variety of flavours and colours and each is better than the last. Some of them literally melt in the mouth. If they have any specially flavoured sandesh, ¬†can be rest assured that it is generously filled with the pulp or cream. Start with the chocolate ones. If u have a sweet tooth, this is one of the places you should land yourself at.

Visiting this place since my childhood and I have seen it through its ebbs and highs! Despite facing a dip in standard, it has again climbed up the ladder to occupy the highest rung! Their fusion sweets are to die for and the more traditional ones will blow you away too. Don't miss their "talshaans"! Your girish experience will remain incomplete without it.

Superb quality sandesh with mind-blowing taste.¬†
They have so much variety (Kiwi, Orange, Butterscotch, Chocolate, Mango, Rose, Malai roll and many many more) that it is difficult to choose one. ¬†Basically, their tagline should be - 'No one can eat just one'.

Their Strawberry sandesh, Blackcurrant sandesh and Chocolate sandesh are my personal favourites.¬†
I recently tried another sandesh that had a hint of coffee flavour - it was absolutely amazing and it definitely gets a place in my 'favourites' list.¬†

The best part is that when you have eaten half the sweet, a¬†syrup will ooze out (strawberry syrup if it's strawberry sandesh, chocolate syrup if it's chocolate sandesh etc) and the taste of the syrup along with the sandesh makes the whole experience very unique and flavourful.¬†
They even make a Diabetic sandesh and it is so good, it doesn't seem like it is meant for diabetics only.¬†

This is one of the best sweet shops in Kolkata for a mad-over-meetha person (like me).¬†It looks dull and shabby from the outside but do not go on the appearance; as appearances can be deceptive.

Discovered through serendipity, this place is any Bengali sweet lover's delight. Their Black currant sandesh and strawberry sandesh is a treat for the taste buds, and the Black forest sandesh is richly scrumptious.

Although marginally costly, the sweets are a bang for your buck. I would love to go back again and have some more.

It was a sweet discovery while riding in the old city... Saw a huge line of people standing in a que and the sweet shop name and estd date made me enquire about it.

Met the owner who made us try all the delicate and mouth melting sweets.

Each one felt better than the last one and we ended up leaving with a sweet tooth... :)

I had chocolate sandesh. It was over whelming delicious. I never thought a sweetmeat can carry the taste of good chocolate but I was beaten on that. The look of the place is shabby. They should try to improve a little on that. I deducted 1 star for that. Sweetmeats deserves 100% rating.

The mango sandesh is also superb .In fact each sweet is heavenly. Its a must visit for all who live in Kolkata and for all those who visit this city. I have been there numerous times. When ever any of my friends visit Kolkata I always ensure that I take them to this shop to  enjoy the flavor of Kolkata.

Nakur - One of my favourite sweet shop in Kolkata. Sweet prices are little high but it is absolutely worthy.. all are very fresh and the sweetness they maintain in every sweet is perfect. I have tried all their sweets and can not say which one is better... though one must try their jol bhora talsash, chocolate , malai roll , and mango sandhesh.. If you haven't been here for once yet, then definitely you are missing a part of heaven...

Nakur Chandra Nandy and sandesh have almost become synonimous..It is the quintessential sweet franchise which has been satiating our hunger for sweets of superior quality for more than 150 years..and till today they have maintained the same quality..Amazing indeed!!Tasting Sandesh from this place is an experience in itself, hard to describe in words..This place has been a cornerstone of our culture,tradition and History of Kolkata..Their DIlkhus,Parijat,Monohara have become legends in themselves..From KKR to Sachin Tendulkar to Amitabh Bachchan,their reputation have stretched all over the world..I personally adore their White Chocolate Sandesh more than anything else..the moment it pours down ur taste bud..u feel in heaven..in this era when you find so much degradation in quality around you..this place indeed is an exception..If u r a sweet tooth and haven't visit this place yet,you r missing out on something very precious..

Being a sweet lover, and most importantly being a Bengali, visiting this mecca of sweet confectionary was somewhat inevitable. Located in hatibagan (nearby hedua) the nearest metro station is "Girish Park".
The cluttered crowd sprawling in front of the shop, tells everything about its popularity. Though it has a shabby and old appearance and reminds you of the by gone eras of Kolkata. But its succulent and magnificent sweetmeat wonders which comes out from their kitchen has outbeat any and every sweet manufacturers and confectioners in the city. Their contagious popularity has spread all over the country and even overseas.
Keeping "girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandi's" sweets in the menu for every auspicious occasion is a must for most the eminent families of Bengal.
Even "Abhishek Bachhan & Aishwariya Rai's marriage" was also glorified with the excuisite sweetmeat from this place.
Everything offered here has its own majestic story, be it the various kinds of sandesh( babu, parijat, sourav, ratabi,3 star, monopuli, nutty sandesh, malai roll, mousumi, utsav) gur monohara, malai sandwich, choco rice balls, dilkhush, sharpuria, chocopuli, etc;
Ahh... It is becoming hard for me to control my cravings for their sweetmeat wonders while writing the reviews.
Being a Bengali is incomplete without indulging yourself into the mouth melting sandesh of "nakur". It is a proud heritage of city of joy.
Their glorious legacy cements the dense culinary expertise of Bengal elegantly in the entire human race.

If you really love sweets and have never visited Nakur, shame on you. Everytime I stand in front of their shop, look at their amazing display of sweets, I feel like a child split with choices. I want to just have it all but the fact that I cannot upsets me. Anyhow my favourite Nakur shandesh is CHOCOLATE CHANA WRAPPED AROUND CHOCOLATE SANDESH. Please visit Nakur.. one of the oldest and best sweet shops of our city.

Nakur is one of the legendary sweet shops of Kolkata serving mishti to the sweet loving bengali not only in bengal but also outside and abroad. Nakur's variety of sandesh is huge; you just have to name one and it will be served to you. The owners have not only maintained the heritage of bengali mishtir dokan but has been progressive in trying out new varieties of sweets keeping in mind the demand of the new generation.  I remember my brother in law carrying mishti from Nakur to California so that he could feel the essence of Kolkata sweets for a few days in the foreign land.

‚ÄúKuch Meetha Ho Jaye‚Äù very tidily sums up the attitude of Indians to ‚Äúmithai,‚Äù or sweets, on a daily basis. A literal translation would result in a grammatically incorrect sentence, but this often-used phrase means ‚Äúthe occasion calls for sweets.‚Äù The occasion being celebrated could be anything from a festival, a wedding or the birth of a child to smaller milestones in life such as exam success, a new home, a new car or even just guests for dinner! No happy gathering of any kind ‚Äì be it a party or a festival ‚Äì would be complete without sweets in India but specially in Kolkata, Nakur is the shop where I do go every time I visit Kolkata. These people are legends like Rabindranath Tagore and Subhash Chandra Bose who are associated with making kolkata proud around the world. Many people don't know that these people are associated with the grand celebration of big fat weddings of people such as Abhishek Bachchan and Sunil Mittal along with the Wadias..........they also became a part of celebration when Kolkata won the first IPL title of champions.......and many others are there on a big list.....but the point is.....they are awesome...all those chocolate sweets and that jolbhara sandesh along with a gur ka rashogolla are there on my list....though it is a small shop, but the taste standards are just like 5star confectioners..................good luck nokur........keep going like this... :)

If its authentic sandesh, none other than this place. They still use pure chhana, and that is what entices me to visit them everytime i get sweets for myself or someone else. A bit pricey, but that is definitely worth it. Special mention - jolbhoras (all of them), aam sandesh, butterscotch, monohora..

I have been passing along this place for years but never went for it. The first time I went here to eat when something regarding the sweets from this shop went to the Bacchan,s wedding n all came up.The sweets are awesome. It cannot get better than this. All the bengali chena sweets Were the softest I have ever had. For fusion lovers they have sweets in chocolate, black current, berries and may different flavours. It looks like a very old shop from ancient times. But I dare anyone to find a place better than this. Its heaven.

This is one of north Kolkata's most famous sweet shops and exudes an old world charm that is rarely found in Bengali sweet shops these days . The shop has trademark green railing outside and the interior is filled with large pictures of different gods and goddesses. The malai roll is one of their most famous products . The flavoured sandesh section looks as inviting as it is tasty ! I particularly liked the black currant sandesh, and the butterscotch sandesh had three layers made up of chocolate , strawberry, and vanilla . No wonder it is almost always crowded with patrons of all ages ranging from 15 to 50 & beyond ! Don't miss the lady with dishevelled hair waiting perpetually in front of the shop for some kind soul to buy her her favorite sweet . Love for food and love of humanity beautifully mingle here.

Best possible Sandesh you can think of in town. Love their Kacha Gola, Gur Sandesh, chocolate Sandesh etc. Very fresh and perfect blend of sweetness and added flavours. They mostly sellout on their popular items by early evening so make sure you reach on time to grab some of them.

After walking quite a lot from hatibagan bus stop we finally reached this legendary sweet shop!!though the appearence did not please us at first...but the moment we set our eyes on those awesomely beautiful n traditional sweets...we were thoroughly puzzled as to what to order!!we settled for their taalsash, malai sandwich and gurer monohora(the best one!)packed some for our homes and went back with a satisfied soul. :)

Legendary,which needs no introduction at all...where the famous Icon Swami Vivekananda himself had sweets is still has the consistency to keep their customers keep a trust when it comes to Bangali der mishti mikh...there jolbhora is my most famous specially the gurer1(jaggery)... 
Ofcourse the chandrapuli,sarpuria,nutty sandesh,malai roll,gur monohara(only available during the winter season)are  a must have..always is one of my favourite sweet shop...

'Nakur' was in my radar for quite some time. And finally I could make it here! 

Notun gur is the jaggery for the winters and the traditional notun gurer sandesh is available all over Kolkata now, This sandesh is a delight for all with sweet cravings. 

I have had this sandesh in Delhi (Bikanerwala and Haldiram - both are excellent), Mumbai (Sweet Bengal - good) and all over Kolkata. 

Nakur is by far the best.

The sandesh is mildly sweet (bringing out the natural essence of notun gur) and quite soft. What pleasantly surprised me was its granularity (unlike most others) - which took the culinary pleasure to a different level.¬†

Highly recommended.

If u love sweets it is your paradise. If u don't then also try, it will change your mind. Sandesh can't be any better. U can try authentic old styled sandesh, or even the newer experiments with chocolates, strawberry, black current, mango etc. In winter u can try gur monohara.

Location: Hatibagan.

Sorry foodies, wouldn't be able to comment on its exact location or ambiance, since I have always had its fare brought by my dad. I would surely visit it soon and update about these two. :)

The age old sweet makers or as my family calls it, the legendary sweet tooth producers, such so because we the children in the family started our sweet journey with the bite of a sweet from here. 
This place has been in this business for like ages now, and yes, also enjoy the patriotism we Kolkattans show by returning back to them every single time we crave for a sweet! This place surely bags a place in the gems of Kolkata Food Legends!

Talking about the fare, select any out of their fare on offer and you wouldn't be disappointed at all! Be it the Jolbhora Sandesh, Flavored Sandesh (Chocolate, Strawberry, Black Currant, Mango, Butterscotch, Rose and the list goes on), Nolen Gur Sandesh, Kaachagola or any other sweet, it would surely teleport you to a sugary yummilicious world.

Personal Favorites:
- Chocolate Sandesh
- Butterscotch Sandesh
- Jolbhora Sandesh
- Kaachagola

The prices are charged in a skimming manner, moderately friendly. 

Overall has always been a great experience. :)
- Keeping 1 point with myself to evaluate on its ambiance, service and staff, comments due.

Legends. Absolute legends they are, Girish and Nakur. Sondesh cannot get better than those you get here. Take your pick from the classics- jolbhora, kachagolla or the heavenly makha sondesh; or try the new age experiments of theirs- butterscotch, orange, strawberry or rose flavored. Hungry for more? Get ahead of the crowd and ask them for their Sachin sondesh, a signature they created on the day of his 100th century. And yes, if it's winter, don't forget to try their nolen gurer sondesh, quite a few varieties of that. Simply put, Nakur is THE best sweet shop in the city.

Soft but firm and d exact right amount of sweetness. .the magic combination is only possible for the magic hands of old craftsmen of North Kolkata I guess.

After Nakur I have simply disliked almost every sweet shop in South Kolkata. .if u have never gone to this place till now   . .do so. .its a must!

Heavenly sweets! Impeccable taste! If you have a sweet tooth, then this is the place for you! Estd. in 1844, these guys are at a legendary level when it comes to making authentic "Bengali Mishtis" or sweets. Every time I visit there and have their "Mishtis", its like I'm in 7th Heaven! From "Nolen Gur er Jolbhora" to "Abar Khabo" , Black Currant to Butterscotch Sandesh, "Choco Fillings" to "Chocolate Chip"...the list goes on and on and on! Everything tastes so so good! :D If you visit Kolkata, this place is a must for Sweet lovers! :)

P.S: It's recommended not to visit during auspicious days/Puja days if you don't wanna stand behind long queues! But yes, for having a bite of their sweet ecstasies, it's even worth standing in queues! :)

Probably the most celebrated mishti makers in town! I live down south in Tollygunge, and since it is physically not possible for me to go the shop each time, I have friends fitted in North Calcutta, who voluntarily treat me to Nakur Chandra's mishtis, every time we're to meet! They know that my love for these mishtis are so profound, that most of the times they treat me to it with me not having to shell out even an anna! Personally, the butterscotch sandesh is my favourite! I would love to try out everything on their menu, but unfortunately, haven't had that much of good luck yet!

Authentic and the best traditional Bengali sweets that u may have in kolkata . It's a haven for sweets and even the devils will turn pious on the taste of sandesh. The owners are boastful of their monopoly of taste and will even ask for a penalty or fine if you do not produce your receipt for a pre booked , pre paid order at delivery . Nonetheless I guess their Atitude is acceptable which gets washed with the sugar dipping in your mouth cavity from the womb of the  soft cottage cheese ; which has norom paak as it's sobriquet.

These place literally weaves MAGIC with its sweet. After trying out the numerous signature sweets I inculcated a strong dislike for other sweet shops. Whenever I visit their shop there are more than 10 customers standing in front of the counter. And the best part is that the prices are real value for money and also lower than what other popular sweet shop charges. Recomended: all sweets have a distinct flavour.

If you want to taste some old school authentic sweets while wandering in the norther part of kolkata, this is the place to be! Ranging from the famous nolen gurer sandesh and kachagolla to strawberry n choclate sweets, it is sure to impress you taste buds. It has a few seasonal specialities- mango sweets in summer, jhola gur planted in sandeshs at winter time and a lot more. Many of my friends n collegues who have tasted sweets from this place holds it in high regards. Can't claim its very pocket friendly, but I am happy to pay the price.

Like "A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard

Nakur writes poetry with chhana and sugar. It is arguably the best sweet shop in the City. True, they are extremely arrogant shopkeepers, but Nakur is Nakur! They know what is Sandesh. It is slightly pricy, but I would pay that amount for that quality.

Nakur represents a lot of things; in Kolkata, in people's lives and in My life. To rate it less that 5 would have been a blasphemy for me!

A stone's throw distance from Scottish Church College on Vivekananda Road, the location is rather inconspicuous for the √ºber-cool crowd, not habituated with the streets of North Kolkata. But once you locate this gem of a sweet seller, you are hooked on to it for life. ¬†Popularly goes by the name of 'Nakur' it has been catering to sugar rushes since 1844 and boasts of an enviable clientele. Introduced to me almost a year back by a friend of mine who also happens to be the friend of the owner's son, I have had the privilege of sampling a few prototypes which aren't for public sale, but that is just classified information which I am not going to share here. Sorry. But what I will share is the amazing selection of sweets which you can purchase off the rack. Chocolate flavored sandesh is what the shop takes immense pride in and I can clearly see why. They taste sublime and they are amongst the fastest selling sweets in the shop. But its a shame I don't remember what they are called. In fact, I don't think I ever paused from gulping down the 'little drops of joy' to ask the name. So hypnotizing is the taste that you forget the diet chart you have to maintain and your resolution to lose weight. Having said that, personally it would be an honor to get fat on 'Nakur'. Hahaha.¬†

Statutory Warning: You may start preferring Nakur over Cadburys.

Like mentioned in my previous reviews, I am not someone with an active sweet tooth.

It is more of a dormant one.

This place, however makes me a Sweet Monster (if there's one)!

I don't know what to eat and what not.
Especially the chocolate and mango flavoured sweets. Someone please tell me are they actually "Mishti"? Or dessert prepared for the Gods?
They are SO amazing!Best thing is, it is just 10 minuted walk away from my home so whenever I have a "Nakur" craving, I walk down and treat myself to the awesomeness.
My father often gets home huge box of sweets of various varieties from Nakur and BOY do I get excited.
To say that Nakur is an iconic sweet shop in Calcutta is a typical understatement. :)

I have a sweet tooth. I must admit. You give me sweets in breakfast, lunch, dinner, I'll take it on any given day. Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy serving Kolkata's sweet tooth since 1844 is one of the oldest and best confectioners in India. I have tried lot of their sweets but I don't remember the names of all of them. The ones I remember are chandrapuli
, parijaat, black currant, butterscotch, strawberry sandesh, diary milk chocolate sandesh, chocolate rice ball. If you ask me to pick one which is the best. Sorry I cannot do that. For me all of them are best. Taste and quality wise they are the best even with a shop that still looks like 100 years old. Yes, they have not changed the look and feel of their shop. But who cares!! There's always some crowd in front of their shop. Weekdays or weekends, you will find people jostling for their favorite sweets.

This is definitely the first sweet shop you should go to whether you are new to Calcutta and want to try good Bengali sweets or you are a die-hard fan of Bengali sweets and want only the best for yourself. Not very far from the famed Vivekananda statue and the recently revamped Chacha's hotel, this shop may be a little difficult to locate and notice, even though it is on one of the busy roads of old Calcutta. However, when you suddenly spot a huge crowd of people blocking your way on the pavement, and notice bustling activity in the kitchen adjacent to a sweet shop, you know you have come to 'Nakur'. People are spoilt for choice here, as you know for sure that every single kind of sweetmeat, arranged neatly in stacks on rectangular trays, will give you bliss only certain things in life can hope to give. When you pop a piece into your mouth, and feel the aromatic, gentle taste melting into your mouth, you will know what kind of ecstasy I am talking about. :)

If you are one of those travelers who love to visit the best of food outlets,then you must not leave Calcutta without treating yourself at this famous Sweets Shop.
Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nansi manufactures one of the best sweets in Calcutta.Popularly known as 'Girish er mishti' it happens to be my most favorite of all the shops in the city.
The sweets which are mostly dry are really good in taste,though I still try out the Gulab Jamun and Rosogolla here at times.
Will not say anything more but only a few shops like this have survived the competition till date and continue to maintain their standard.
Dont forget to try the chocolate sandesh here(a little pinch in the pocket, but very classy in taste).

After spending three years in the city and countless promises to mum to send her the best damn sweets, I finally found my way down to this gem of a 'Mishti'r Dokan". The shop itself looks as old as described(somewhere in the mid 1800s!!!) and the spread isnt that gigantic.But the taste that follows after you've put that first piece of sondesh in your mouth plus all the anticipation and hype minus the walking,is heavenly.I tasted one with fruits and nuts in the centre and the chocolate one,packed about 2 dozen of various varieties.Each one of them was so perfect that i couldve sweared i shed a tear in happiness.Outstanding.period.
PS- The 0.5 deduction is for the difficulty in finding this place.So worth it! ^_^

i was never into sweets much, but the one that turned my sweet tooth sharp & made me fall in love with bengali sweets is the legendary Nakur sweets. true that they offer a wide range and variety of sweets - be it some authentic bengal sweets or the experimental fusion ones & they make it appear in best tastes possible which made me savor every bit of their heavenly items. i have had heard much about this renowned sweet shop from my grandma & uncle, but i got fortunate enough to  taste their sweets mostly when it happened to be situated just by my college. with reasonable price and consistent maintenance of standard, they still occupy a position unparallel. apart from cadbery sandeshes like black forest, rice ball, choco chips,sandwiches  which are popular among youngsters like us, there are timeless ones like parijaat, golap sandesh, dilkhush, malai roll - which can win over hearts of all age & generations. golapkhash sandesh definitely deserves special mention - the aroma it delivered was intact and the nawabi flavor that persisted was heavenly - i packed one big box full of their sweets taking one from every item to send them oversea to my aunt in canada with loads of love & laughter. their sweets can still bring delight & have held up the pride of bengal for their mastery over the art of making sweets.

The best sandesh in town. Easily mistaken as a jewelry shop, this place is always crowded. But once you taste their products you know why. Their notun gurer sandesh and chandrapuli are my favorites. Every time we visit we end up buying much more than we can eat or distribute.

When I tried the first item , the only thought I had ' lets try another', then another one again, and I ended with five types of mouthwatering sandeshes, and I bought another five types of sweets...believe me they all taste heavenly...This is the best ever place for sweet lovers.

First of all I would say, people won't find better sandesh anywhere in whole kolkata. They make epic sandesh and varieties of sweets. The sweets which I find unique are jol bhora sandesh , guli sandesh those small ones and gur er sandesh. This unique taste you won't find at any other sweet shop. Bengali's are crazy for these sweets available in the shop.

a perfect 5 or beyond that for this sweet shop...not probably, but this is the best sweet shop in the city & people who have not tasted NAKUR's mishti is making or made a SIN....during durga puja even the government run services for pandal hoping stops for their guests to try sweets in this shop...i have never heard of any sweet shop selling sweet platters during ceratin ocassions but this place does...even when KKR won IPL the cake(which most of us thought) went from this place and its not a cake its a sandesh during the celebration party in eden gardens...so you can undersrand the grandeur of this name....any sweet that you taste will be a masterpiece...so no personal favourites because you wont be able to decide which one is better than the other and i can bet on that....expenses - expensive definitely,but quality always comes with a good price tag...so KUDOS to NAKUR for maintaining the same quality and for serving us....

The other word synonymous to Nakur (for me) is chocolate sandesh. I was pampered by one of my grand-uncles with these yummy innovative delight since my childhood, and it still continues.

Other than that, nolen gurer knachagolla and jolbhora are the timeless comforts to your tastebuds that you can ever imagine.

This place is LEGEN wait for it DARY....no adjectives can ever be enough to describe this place. It has been around since donkey's years and everyone who has been here and eaten shondesh from here will have fond memories. My grandparents loved this place (possibly their parents did too), my parents love this place and now so do I. Talshash, golap patar shondhesh, shorer sandwich (with pista bits on top), rose, jolbhora, babu shondhesh etc. all have the potential to teleport you to another dimension. And so do the seasonsal ones like lebu shondesh and kacha golla. I am a huge fan of all their traditional recipes and somehow don't like all their innovations. The black currant for instance was awesome as far as I am concerned unlike some of the various chocolate ones that they have come up with over time. If I am dying and I am given an option to choose from Girish, Nalin and Bhim Nag, I'd probably die choosing.

If you ever go to North Kolkata in search of nice food and nice desserts or rather for Bengali sweets then Nakur is just the place you should surely visit. Situated near Girish Park Police Station or you may say Hedua Swimming club this place is the heaven for all those who can spend a lot over sweets to taste the best. I being a regular to this place really recommend this to every person who likes sweet. Starting from Black Forest, Monohara, TriStar or ThreeStar, Jolbhora, Toofan Chocolate(named after 'Toofan' da,a member of Nakur family) etc etc. If you try any of their sweets I am sure you will again come back for more. Without any doubt this one of the oldest and the best sweet shop that is maintaining their standard even after so many years. This is really highly recommended to all sweet lovers.

How could I forgot to write a review about the best mishti shop in kolkata!! It's just hardly 10min walking distance from my place. Nakur, as everyone calls it, is on a busy commercial lane in the skein of¬†densely trafficked streets that make up the old Shyambazar district.¬†The shop itself is little more than a grated hole in the wall but the locals who line up at the window and the connoisseurs who have braved the traffic across town, know that this is where you can find some of the finest sandesh in Kolkata, delicate and creamy with a subtle grain that melts gradually and unevenly in your mouth.
In a weekend, around 8pm,u may have to wait in a queue to get your turn. That much fame they have. I love all the sweets & my favorites are jolbhora, blackcurrant sandesh, butter Scotch sandesh, malai roll. 
Go & taste the sweets who didn't try it yet. U will each & every item they prepare & finally ends up with extra calories.

We were on a tour of North Kolkata yesterday and upon enquiring a ‚Äògood‚Äô shop for ‚ÄòMishti‚Äô (assortment of Bengali desserts), were referred to this shop. Easy to find, Girish-Nakur is in Hedua, close to the Girish Park Police Station. It‚Äôs a Eureka moment when you reach it, for it is exactly how you would have imagined it ‚Äì old, cluttered, unassuming, bustling with patrons, hurrying and swift salesmen doling out the goodies to the Sandesh-lovers.

We struck a conversation with the young, Pradip Nandy ‚Äì the 6th generation Nandy currently running the place. And was happy to find out that he has taken his famous outlet to the digital space. Girish-Nakur has its own website, a Facebook page and a Twitter handle. Going the right direction, we declared!! He also told us, matter-of-factly, that since they sell only Sandesh, they come up with new variants every few months. Hence, a few exotic names such as Black Currant Sandesh, Black Forest Sandesh!! Truly new-age, we said in admiration. Having said that, you will not miss the original, always-in-demand Nolen Gurer Sandesh, Jol Bhora Sandesh, Taal sash sandesh‚Ä¶.those are their specialty anyway.

Visited this place for morning breakfast and was one of the earliest customers :-) ..... have a sweet tooth but am also carefull with my calorie intake and so was touch worried about my over eating ( story of our lifes i think ) ....... Place specialises in Sondesh and do not make anything with Ras ( Ras is sugar syrup ) .... thereby it is restricted to Sondesh and items like Rosgolla, Kheer Kadam are not available. 
Sondesh is fresh, fresh & fresh and extremely tasty ... it is more flavour driven then plain sugar and so you can eat happily and  you will LOVE it :-) :-) ... tried almost all the items but my liking was the small dumpling sondesh & the roll filled with dry fruits :-) :-) ... for the quality and freshness the price is a throw away and am sure you will like it 
a word of warning ..... the place is in north kolkatta and is in a by lane . the roads are small and extremely dirty .. traffic is snarl and if you dont come early you will struggle .... there is no seating place and you will have to stand and eat .. there are beggars galore and be prepared ... not a gourmet dining experience but a typical road side Indian eating experience !!! The place was started in 1857 and there is reason they are still successfull :-) ... Sondesh to Die For :-) :-)

To me they are THE BEST authentic bengali sweet makers. its a small shop in hatibagan, the service is not so great, but i don't care, i luv nakur's mishti!!! reason i like them so much is because i have seen many sweet shops who have tried to punch modern flavours with authentic bengali sweets. here i must mention that i am not a mishti fan but NAKUR has  successfully made me one....the MUST TRY LIST IS long!!!! but the most important one is the BLACK FOREST SANDESH.......!!!!! jug jug jio NAKUR!!!!

If you are talking about "SANDESH"... then please..please... don't give a second thought to any other shop in this entire universe. If you are a foodie and not having allergic to sweets and if you are in Kolkata, then it will be a sin, if you do not visit the shop and try the best "SANDESH" of this universe.
in school days, I used to save my precious pocket money to have those "SANDESH" and I am still following this trend. 
I cant name any specific "SANDESH" as the best because each of them is equally excellent. Yes, there are number of flavors like mango, chocolates, black currant, butter scotch and many more that may vary according to your likeness of the flavor. 
The best of part of this shop is that, it keeps experiment with its "SANDESH".  it is like "R&D" process which keeps producing new varieties of SANDESH which is very unique (sometimes seasonal) and cannot be found in any  sweetmeat shops in Kolkata.

Writing review for the God is not easy. Couldn't find a more suitable name for Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.
You won't find anything to admire when you visit this shop. It's like any other sweet shop in your locality. But wait! Go a little further and take a look at the awards and recognitions in the shop. That will tell you that you have come to meet or rather experience heaven on earth. A lot of people complain that the price is a bit high here and this is a shop for the rich and aristocrats. Well, it's partly true that compared to other sweet shops in your locality, this place is expensive. But that doesn't matter, if you want to taste the best. And frankly, it is not out of your reach.

I just can't mention any one Sandesh here, I love them all. You will see them making fresh sweets right in front of your eyes, they will bring the trays to the counter, and within 15-30 minutes they will vanish. You will never ever find old sweets here. The stocks hardly lasts for a few hours and deserves a phrase like "Sold-As-Fast-As-Nakur's-Sandesh."
You have to wait, but not for long. Other people will always be there, but the service is also good and they trust their customers. I buy Sandesh from this shop quite frequently and it's like meeting the almighty every time.

Girish Nakur is GOD. There! I said it. No, actually, they make the best sandesh I have tasted till date. I love the huge variety of plain and very innovative ones they have - they experiment with flavors and come up with blackcurrant sandesh, ferrero rocher sandesh, chocolate talsash, but I tend to love their traditional jolbhora talsash and the ever-faithful light as air golap sondesh. The crowd is there, but pointing at freshly made sweets and taking them home, or eating them right there is a part of my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and is one of the best things I have eaten till date.

I had a trip planned to Calcutta & as such was searching for the must-visit-foodie-places in there & seeing GCC & NCC at the top of the charts, i had kept a time slotted in my trip just to know why. 

As i was going solo & this part of the city was not known to me, i had to take the help of GPS & locals to get to this place. For newbies like me its located on the Ramdulal Sarkar Street which lies almost opposite to the Hedua Park near Hatibagan & you can easily find it on the left side of the road if you are coming from the Hedua Park side. There were quite a few sweet shops lined before G&N which had all kinds of sweets lined up & i somehow resisted them & finally reached my destination.

To be honest i was quite surprised on reaching the place as i had cooked up something totally out of the world in my mind but contrary to that it was just like any other Sweet shop you will find in any random place. Sweets decked up in the front counter, grumpy salesmen, sweets being prepared in the backyard, cheap rates, a steady flow of foodies, . I was just wondering at that moment what was it, that had made this place so highly-rated. 

I had read a few reviews in Zomato about this place & its specialities & without wasting anymore time i ordered them.& the rest as they always say is History.
 
1. Special Chocolate Sandesh - chocolate-favored freshly made buttery-soft sandesh with a surprise of Chocolate Sauce dripping from the centre. The moment you put that in your mouth, its Nirvana. Absolutely recommended.
2.Kora Pak - one of best i have had...i earlier had tasted it in K.C.Das & i felt this to be better.
3.Butter Scotch Sandesh - i never thought butter-scotch would taste so much better in the form of sandesh.

I also had their Black-Currant, Strawberry & a couple of other flavors which  were equally luscious.

The service is nothing to write about. But who cares. I have earmarked this as a must-visit place whenever i come again to this lovely city.

P.S. - There is a huge portrait of our Didi with King Khan & his KKR team members above the front counter of the shop, cutting a Cake Sandesh ( i suppose ) made from this place. Kind of shows its pedigree. LEGENDARY.

Personally I don't have a so-called sweet tooth, still Nakur is the only sweetmeat shop in Calcutta for which I can vouch. If you are born in Calcutta in a traditional Bengali family, then you ought to have sweets from Nakur at least once in your lifetime. You won't believe, this shop is carrying heritage since last 170 years! Once my colleagues from various parts of India came over here for attending a training. They tried typical canned rasgullas from Haldirams, mishti doi from Gangurams - but somehow they were not getting satisfied with their taste. They kept on insisting me for letting them taste some authentic Bengali sweets from a traditional sweetmeat shop. Undoubtedly, I opted for Nakur. The simple taste of Choco-filled Gutis, Choco-wrapped Rolls, Mango-flavored Sandesh, Malai-wrapped Rolls, Strawberry Sandesh left them mesmerized. Look and feel-wise this shop may not be attractive, but their sweets are making our city proud for the ages! My rating for Nakur would be a whopping 4 out of 5.

I do not know of any person in Kolkata who does not love this place. Its more than a century old and as one of its employees once explained to me ,  it was opened as a reply to pudding and pastry culture of the East Indian Company. Oh Boy, What a reply !!!

There is no place that makes sweets like this place does. The testament to this point is the fact that you would always find a good crowd standing outside the steel grils and buying their stuff be it 8 a.m. in the morning or 10.30. in the evening.  I wouldn't be overshooting when I say every one of their several sweets they make is a speciality of their shop. There are times when you would find only one or two variety of sweets available, such is their sale quantum. I would suggest you to better confirm/ intimate before going to the place if your taste buds are craving for some specific sweet.

Kacha golas, jolbhoras, kora pak are their items that have been ruling the taste buds for like forever. Now, they have experimented and introduced number of innovative sweets in the flavour of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, butterscotch, black current and all are crazzzzy!!!! Kacha gola, chocolate malai roll, black forest are my preferences though i know how tough it is to choose what you want. They have sugar free options for the diabetics or calorie conscious people.

This place is one that i have been going since i dont know when and can never get enough of it, and my taste buds are tempted already !!!

Class and Tradition personified, the Bard of Bengali Sweets!
Actually, consistency defines the quality of anything! Even a Rs. 2 GUJIYA depicts the quality which Nakur consistently delivers so one can easily make out what the Trademarks would turn out to be like.
No words or reviews can in true sense describe the class of Nakur.

When it comes to the typical and traditional Bengali Mishti (not Sweets/Desert), Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy is the best. Their dry Mishti is one of the best in the world (yes, you read it right!!).  They continued to create magic since more than 100 years sitting in the northern part of the city Kolkata.  Here are some technical points for the shoppers.

Parking: 
No dedicated parking space for the shop though. But, since it is situated on Ramdulal Sarkar Street, a relatively smaller road than the adjacent Cornwallis street, almost 10 cars can be parked at a time.

Ambiance and sitting arrangement: 
It is not a restaurant and hence no arrangement for sitting. It is a typical old Bengali Mishti shop, where shoppers buy sweets by standing on the footpath. Footpath adjacent to the shop is roofed by the veranda of their house, so, you don't get drenched in the rain. 
Yes, you can try peeking through the door or window of the shop and you may get a sight of making Mishti inside.

Taste and value for money:
All of the sweets are favourite of mine. They are simply as made in heaven. So, if you visit Kolkata, take a taxi from airport. Even, 400 rupee taxi fare is worth for these delicacies.

This place has achieved legendary status, and rightly so. 
Its a small sweet shop, located near Bethune College, tucked away in a side alley. The sweets here are awesome (and trust me, we bengalis are something of a sweetmeat expert).Not only do they have regular and traditional offerings, they also have a variety of new creations. The sheer variety of different chocolate sandesh available makes one's mouth water. Everytime I visit, I make it a point to try 1 each of at least 5-6 varieties. The quality and taste are very satisfying to the taste buds. Price wise they have justified offerings.Be it traditional 'mishti' or modern 'flavour' experiments, this place never goes wrong.
So next time you are in north calcutta , don't forget to sample the sweets this 'ancient' shop has to offer.

I have absolutely no words about the sandesh here! Be it the chocolate sandesh or the plain kancha gola or the kada paak, their sandesh just melts in the mouth and is divinely tasty!!! For any non-Calcuttan, trying their sandesh is a MUST!! it is a heritage in itself here in Kolkata! Outstanding, is the word!

(now even i've suddenly started craving the sandesh, while writing this!!)

Growing up in North Kolkata, you've got to be a sweets person. From the Bhim Nags and Sen Mahasays, Girish Nakur is a step forward. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best place for sweets in all of Kolkata. From the classical korapak to their experimentation with chocolate and other flavours like black currant et al, they just never go wrong. 
All hail Girish Nakur !!

I'm a sweets guy. I'm the guy who has, compulsorily, sweets every night after dinner. I'm 22 and yet sugar rush isn't yet a memory to me. Ergo, CLEARLY,  Nakur er mishti is a very special place for me. From the traditional korapak to the newer chocolate sandesh-es, I love just about everything here! This is very well woven into kolkata's heritage, and I think just about everyone in town loves the sweets here almost as much (I can't say more than) I do.
Ohhhh Nakur. Glory Glory Nakur Nandy.

If you need a definite taste of sandesh or particularly JOLBHORA, then you must visit the shop. Theres nothing much to add about the shop...their traditional sweets are still one of the best in the city and nowadays they are experimenting with new tastes such as green apple, black currant etc. Also they have introduced large varities of chocolate sweets which are all a must try.
So to tickle your taste buds...definitely visit with your friends or family!!

if you want to taste what a heavenly sandesh is come to Nakur. if you dont like to wait, send someone else to get them for you.
the best way to have mishti here is by coming with a team - at least a partner.
Choose at least five sweets depending on availability and your taste. order one each and share. that way you can have a lot of variety without stuffing yourself too much.
the chocolate sandesh , the jolbhara and the monohora are really the leaders. you may also try the orange, black currant and mango flavoured sandesh.
my all time favourite has been the chandrapuli - it just melts in your mouth.

Personally ,  Nakur has always lost to the oldest sweetmeat shop in the city but its Jolbhora (a special sweet made with cottage cheese which has been kneaded to a melt in the mouth consistency, with a filling of syrup during the summers and palm jaggery during the winters) is one of a kind. It is soft and has a melt in the mouth texture. I personally cannot give high ratings to a sweetmeat shop which is ultramodern. It has all sorts of non-traditional flavours with a layer of the flavour's compote on top and I personally love traditional sweets and thereby I cannot but give it a poor rating. Some might love the new flavours which give a new twists to sweets. I must admit that their chocolate flavoured sweets are quite delicious and if eaten as just a dessert is quite a nice way to end a meal. I was a bit annoyed with the high handed attitude of the servers. I have personally been a regular at the oldest sweetmeat shop where the servers are always ready to serve with a smile but the servers of Nakur seemed a bit careless about losing customers while not attending to them. They serve not on a first come first serve basis but on a basis of regularity of the customer's visit to the shop which is very annoying. With so many other sweetmeat shops falling in the category of cultural heritage of Calcutta) my rating is naturally not very favourable for the shop.

Girish has been a favourite with my family for at least three generations, as the quality of their sweets is very good. Their traditional Talshaash Sandesh is something that I have eaten with great relish for many years. The large size of their sweets was also a matter of joy.

These days, most major sweet shops in Calcutta are trying to come up with new varieties of sweets. Girish has not been immune to this trend, and if one goes to the shop today, most of the sweets on display are new creations.

Of the innovations, their range of chocolate-based sweets is very good. Girish was not the first shop to try and put chocolate in their sweets, but I think that the quality of chocolate used by them, along with the way in which the chocolate is melded with the cottage cheese/thickened milk that forms the base of most sweets, is what makes their chocolate sweets so good.

There has also been a flip side to this innovativeness. Owing to the changing nature of Girish's clientele, the shop now stuffs most of its sweets with nuts, which detract from the taste of the sweet itself. Sizes have also started shrinking. Some ghastly combinations have also ensued - I tried a sweet with kiwi pieces in it and found it quite terrible. Flavours like strawberry and pineapple should also not be used profusely as they don't go very well with the sweet base. One hopes that a balance will be struck to ensure that the taste and quality of the sweets remain the same, even the new varieties.

I love the sweets they serve,,, they are simply fabulous.
rosogollas, pantuas form a daily choice by all but I think this shop prepares with some magical effects and the taste is really unique.
The Jolbhora is out of the world,it will melt in your mouth. Chocolate sandesh is simply exceptional.... Pithe is excellent here...
It is my most favourite sweet shop.
Also, during occasions I order som sweets from here and they have never falide to satisfy and bring a smile in everyone's face,,,,
prices are reasobnable and i would rate 4.5 for GIRISH CHANDRA DEY AND NAKUR CHANDRA NANY....they should get the award for best sweets.....

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy  is the pride of Calcutta when it is about sandesh.It is one of the oldest and most popular 'Mishti dokaan' (sweet shop) as said in Bengali.
If you are a Kolkatan or have visited Calcutta ever and are a real foodie with the sweet tooth this place is a must go.It is snuggling in one of the lanes of Shyam Bazar with a dusty signboard -nothing attractive at all you may think , but don't go for the looks!  Some of my favourites are the
chocolate sandesh through which ' the liquid chocolate just seeps out of it as you delve into the soft sandesh . The Noren Gurer Sandesh is the real delight which has the real gur (jaggery) in it.
The Knanchagolla is so soft that it melts into the warmth of your mouth while Kora Paker Sandesh is another one to go for. The diabetic section is not at all the one to go for if you have diabetes , even I love the sweets of the diabetic section as well.It is value for money
All in all this place is an essential place for a foodie you have to visit this place and if you love heritage then Come Here !!!!!

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy is a brand synonymous with Sandesh in Kolkata. Many of my personal favourite sweets are from this shop in North Calcutta. In fact, I know many people who will buy their sweets only from here - pocket pinch not withstanding! Such is the demand and the quality of their offerings.
Some of my picks would be the Jol-Bhora-Tal-Shnash - an exquisite dish where the sweet is filled with a delicious liquid filling that leaks out only when you have gotten half-through, the Chocolate and Strawberry flavoured Sandesh and Rosogolla, the evergreen Nolen Gur-er Sondesh and the Knachagolla.
The Knachagolla is so soft that it will readily melt in your mouth, considering you haven't already disintegrated it when using your spoon or fingers without care. The Nolen Gur-er Sondesh, a speciality of the winter months, is something to swear by. In these days, the authentic Nolen Gur - made from silver date palm extracts - is hard to find. Almost all cheap shops will sell you scented and coloured jaggery. However, Girish and Nakur, though a tad expensive, will never compromise on the quality. You can always depend on them for the most authentic and most exciting flavours of the season. They also have a section for diabetic patients - which is sure to light up many faces!

Verdict: This place is legendary. Must go!

This is by far the best place to have Sandesh in Calcutta. Starting with the traditional kachagolla to the experimental chocolate sandesh, everything here is just heavenly. Personal favourites are Kachagolla, Jol bhora naram pak, Moushumi and chocolate sandesh. Best part is they know their strength is sandesh and they concentrate only on that. No rosogolla, no doi, just super delicious sandesh.

The only negative is their behavior. Worst I have found in Calcutta. A minus one for that.

This is one of the oldest sweet shops of Kolkata established in the 1850's and practically a part of the city's heritage. The establishment is supposed to be the birthplace of sandesh. The Nolen Gur items are super especially the Korapak Sandesh which I love. The Kanchgolla and Rossagolla are both excellent options to sample. Keep up with the times some off beat flavours like chocolate, strawberry and pineapple sandesh have been introduced as well. This is a must visit place for all true foodies with a sweet tooth but beware it is a little hard to find if one is not familiar with the area!

Having grown up in Delhi, "Nakur-er Shondesh" had been the stuff of all 'probashi' folklore, and with these sweet treats being hailed as the stuff of legends, my first visit to this place surely made me carry a bag full of question marks and exclamation marks, right down to the little counter on this shop inconspicuously tucked into a tiny lane in North Calcutta (a nightmare for novices!). But did I drop my bag full of marks, and how! This stuff was good! The first bite and I was hooked. I went back to my childhood days of frequenting the 'padra' sweetshop and having one of each one of the sweets on display, only this time with each passing try it got better, even when you thought it couldn't! 

I believe this review renders itself quite redundant in the face of the legends surrounding this place, the huge picture of KKR celebrating with their 'Shondesh Cake', the dozens of other endorsments and trophies adorning the aged walls of this tiny little haunt. 

It is a must visit for every "Shondesh" lover, and unlike my other reviews, I won't give you suggestions, just go at it like an adventure, and I can assure you that you won't be let down! :)

being a kolkata lover, and a person who loves heritage, i simply adore this place. 

Nakur, as it is popularly known by its regulars, is an important part of the MISTI History of kolkata, they have been on the scene for generations and i hav been a regular here. but what i like about this place the most, they ppl have adapted new techniques into the humble sandesh and made it quite a treat. 

they hav some chocolate sandesh varieties here which could give high end cake shops a run for their money. 

a person favorite here is the sugar free chocolate sandesh and the butterscotch sandesh .. one must also try the strawberry malai roll..

be sure to make your choice fast as people are waiting... a very popular place... and brilliant sweets.

Tucked away in an old, nondescript lane near Shyambazar Metro, don't judge this place by how it looks. Literally a hole in the wall, with purana grills, this is a far cry from the innumerable sweet shops popping up around South Kolkata.

But do you want to know how this place differs from those? Take a bite of their korapaker sandesh. You'll be transported to heaven is my gurantee. Popularly known as 'Nakur, this place occupies a pride of place for the Kolkata palate. If there's a big wedding or a huge celebration, this is the place to get your sweets from. For over 50-60 years, these guys have been dishing out veritable delicacies in sweets, with their quality never wavering. 

Even if you don't live in North Kolkata, make it a point to once come here and sample their stuff. You'll be blown away, and come back again and more. Just make sure to come before everything gets sold out!

What can be said about this place that hasn't already been mentioned? Sweets are heavenly, the best I have had. The prices in general are a little higher than the adjoining sweet shops, tastes are a bit better too (although personally I am in love with almost all the sweet shops in the lane üòÅ). 
One con I would say is it becomes quiet a challenge to get the attention of the servers when there is a crowd and it has happened that people who are there to buy only a few items have to strive harder to get notice of the shopkeepers against bulk purchasers in the rush.

The most renowned confectioner if Kolkata famous the world round for the exotic preparation of sweet meat. The most famous outlet is situated in a small alley called Ram Dulal Sarkar Street. It is difficult to decide on one delicacy because all are so wonderful.
The jol bhora, naram pak, gulab sandesh, butterscotch sandesh and the chocolate roll are the best seller. The disappear within no time. Besides these the flavoured sandesh like strawberry, blackcurrant, mango,lemon and chocolate are equally enticing. The malai roll is a must have.

Located near hedua. It's the best sweet shop you can find. It has the old Calcutta feel to it since they have not changed the decor since old times. Coming to the sweets, they only serve sandesh. I personally love the way they are blending classic sweets to suit modern day customers. The chocolate misti, jolbhora, kora pak sandesh is to die for. The price is affordable. plz give it a try when in Kolkata.

And these guys have been this invincible for over a century and a half. One visit at this counter and you will experience it for yourself. THIS PLACE IS A MUST FOR EVERYONE VISITING KOLKATA and would like to indulge in their sweet desires. My own story? Well, I come here to pick stuff for my cousins when I am traveling to other cities, and can't resist trying at least three different kinds of sweets on their display window. People pack serious amounts of their Sondesh for which they are known and now that WINTER IS HERE, they will have available with them Sondesh with gur(jaggery). Do come here to complete your visit to Kolkata.

Probably the best sandesh is available here, in Kolkata now. It's in a lane opposite to one end of Heduya lake. The building is old and this shop is below the gaRi-baranda. In the window and door opening of the ground floor flat , they have kept the showcases and use them as the counter too. You can see people preparing the legendary sondeshes painstakingly by the laborious traditional way. Quality of the paneer/chhena is outstanding. Best of the best. My only grievance is that they don't make doi. And also they don't have any seating arrangements. You have to take it away. Frequently there will be huge crowd and it's very difficult to catch the eye of the server from outside through the metal rods blocking the window. I wish this serving system would be modernised someday. I take sondeshes to Dubai and before to Saudi Arabia everyone I go to Calcutta. The cost of each sondesh varies from 10-20 rs per piece and they remain well for few hrs. Some can be kept for few days too- specially the koRa-pak. My first choice is the butterscotch sondesh and knachagolla and jolbhora and norom pak shonkho sondesh. Remembering it makes my mouth start watering. This is the classic Calcutta dessert shop. Nothing beats them.

Nakur is a delight to the Bangali sandesh aficionado! The outlet at 56, Ramdulal Sarkar Street is a pilgrimage to the sweet toothed gourmet. Ranging from the traditional Parijat and Sourav Sandesh to the contemporary Chocolate Black Forest and Mango Monohara, Nakur never ceases to surprise you.
If you are lucky enough, delve into weekly delicacies like the Posto Sandesh, crafted exclusively on Sundays or the Saturday-born Abar Khabo.

Born in a bengali household, who haven't tasted the famous nakur er sandesh since childhood. I always have been a true lover of sweets and sandesh and for me,  Nakur has given my dreams a reality. I am in utter craze for the flavoured sweets of them.  They definitely have added definition to the sweet throne of the bengalis.

Inspite of coming to Kolkata during my leaves nevwr been ti this place as it is in the opposite direction of my place..finally came during durga puja as i along with friends came to try out a few of there sandesh post pandal hopping.... btw this place is very popular as i asked one person and he guided me very well....
When i reached pabchami 4pm..luckily it was just 2customers and me....i looked thru the recommendations given by the people i follow in this platform and asked for the chocolate,jolbhora and monhara sandesh
Just lovedddd the chocolate variant, have tried many other as well which were very good but the plus point in this one is the price and the taste...the best ever...the monhara also was very good.not too sweet and a huge stuffing of pista and kheer inside ....i wnt name anyplace but what sets apart this place is the fact that the price tag they carry ....these are really dirt cheap and the same thing one wud get at 1and half times(at the least)in its competetors place....
If one is at the north calcutta definitely a must visit....

Nothing to mention new about this sweet shop.
Located in North Kolkata just in the lane opposite to Manicktala Street, this joint is a legend.

The varieties and the qualities will just leave you craving for more.
Starting from their Chocolate singara, chocolate malai roll to the flavored burfees, everything is just beyond explanation. 
A tradition merged well with modernization.

You visit Kolkata and do not feast yourself to numerous varieties of sandesh (shondesh, like we Bengalis call it), your visit remains incomplete. We Bengalis love our sweets and are extremely emotional about the sweet culture in our city. The shop located in between College Street and Hatibagan, more than 150 year old, is an iconic place to relish sandesh. There are a wide variety of sweets with delicate taste. Rich and creamy, it's a paradise for sweet toothed. The shop has an old look and you will be able to see the workers making sweets in a large clean hall. It's definitely a go to shop on a visit to Kolkata. One of my favourites.

Any sweet in this confectionery that you might try would be scintillating to your taste buds.I went to the shop today and requested them to pack 2 pieces of 10 different sweets that are the most popular. They charged 25 each totalling to 500rs.I also tried the mango malai roll and a type of makha sandesh with mango jelly on top for which I paid an additional amount of 80rs.Basically, I was either duped and overcharged, or the menu here needs to be updated with the current price.

First time to this sweet shop,Was on my 
to do list for my Kolkata trip after going through a food and travel channel.
Just around seven kilometres from Pretoria street.
A humble shop no tamjham of modern day shops,A classic display of their(how to refer)Prized possessions or prized babies,Hand crafted 24 carat.
Tasted some with assistance - jalbhara,chocolate cream roll & gur sandesh.
Carrying home some.

Only issue their assistants,But it's an issue which is there with some old establishments, the extreme passion for sweet making with an equivalent compassion towards needs of assistants,can make a difference,Perhaps.Just  an opinion.

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Dey , established in the year 1844 is located at 56 , Ram Dulal Sarkar Street near Bethune College is preeminent in the making traditional Bengali sweets with a subtle blend of western flavours.This sweet heaven gained popularity in the mid 20s and became famous all over india. This place received a boost in its status when Bollywood Acting icon Amitabh Bachchan hired the services of this joint for the wedding reception of his son. The silver lining to the cloud was when this sweet shop was hired to make a sandesh weighing 34kgs to felicitate The Kolkata Knight Riders.

This place never buys finished product as the ingredient for their sandesh, the processing is done completely by them , they serve the best quality possible and upgrade their standards with each passing day.

Presently there are 70 different varieties of sweets available for the patrons , some of the most popular are Chocolate black forest Sandesh , Chocolate Singhara , Gurer Barfi , Gurer Kanchagola , Mango Amrapali , Malai Roll and Chocolate Ball.

For varieties of Sandesh this place ranks amongst the best in Kolkata.

From childhood I am a big fan of sweets of this shop. It‚Äôs been years and the outlet have never disappointed me. They have came up with varieties year after year. Whenever I visit I can‚Äôt stop having more than 2 to 3 sweets at a time.

Now when I visited this place today it had came up with new variety ie., Dark Chocolate Sandesh. The owner was very generous giving the descriptions. I tried some of them and what I say the quality is just awesome. Each and every bite of the sweets are melting lite a butter. In one word I can say its butteryyyyyyyyyy.

Now come to the taste factor. It‚Äôs very much upto the mark and you can‚Äôt get much more than that. I can say it‚Äôs a Paisa Wasoool Deal.

Some of the sweets that we tried and they are:-

Dilkhush‚Äì The name says it all. Dil ko sach mein khush kr diya. Cottage Cheese (Chena) being crushed and a layer of pista was there on top of it.

Babu Sandesh‚Äì The sandesh having a inside filling of mewas and kheer. it‚Äôs really delicious.

Parijat‚Äì The sandesh being made by mixing mewas and nuts. Just awesome.

Black Forest‚Äì The chocolate lovers must try it. The sweet is made of a chocolate sandesh having a hard upper crust layer of dark chocolate.

Black Current‚Äì The black current flavor being added to the sandesh. Each bite was just buttery.

Dark Chocolate Sandesh‚Äì The best one I can say. The chocolate sandesh being layered with a liquid chocolate along with a caramelized balls. It was heaven. It‚Äôs a must try.

Thankyou The Foodinista for invinting us.. üòä

Indulge yourself in the authentic calcuttan sweets of "Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Dey" 

Carrying forward the legacy of the amazing "sweet" recipes and blending the same with some modern flavours and style, it's not just a sweet shop, it's a celebration of calcutta's beautiful dessert scenario.

If there's one reason for me to move back to Kolkata ever (apart from several others) it is this place. Aha, ahahaha, aha. What sweets! Have had the strawberry and the black forest thus far this time around (my in-laws live a couple of blocks away, yeah I know, I got lucky, my partner is fabulous, and her house is in the confection paradise of Kolkata). I have, however, had almost every single piece on offer here. Facetiously speaking, this place is the cure for depression. Love the old-timey chouki-te-boshe misti bikri style. As Bengalis would say, hebby boss!

To start with, this is one of the most talked about shops in my locality - connection with Mrs Jaya Bachchan! I decided to try this out and i have to say, i was impressed beyond words! The butterscotch sandesh is as lovely as it sounds - they are a steal deal ! I had almost all the flavored sandesh that these guys have- orange, pineapple, kiwi, strawberry, blackcurrant! They also had these lovely black and white chocolate sandesh which were yum ! I packed the malai roll which again was a rocker ! Kudos to this age old shop !

Words aren't enough to describe this place! They are the undisputed kings of "Sandesh". We gorged on the Choco rice balls, parijaat and chocolate singhara and honestly got a food-coma! The Choco rice ball had a dark chocolate centre ( most other sweet shops use milk chocolates), the chocolate singhara had a gooey, soft, nutty centre and parijaat just gives you the comforting taste of pure "chhena" mixed with regal dry fruits! They have maintained their standards for decades and keeps getting better with every day!

Their sweets might look humble and simple, but they taste worth a million pounds! Their sweets are fresh and always made from scratch with the purest ingredients! This is the place to be if you like your "sandesh" delicious, pure and honest with a touch of love and nostalgia!

A sweet shop located in north kolkata...steeped in tradition. Most unimpressive looking and providing most impressive mishtis. On occasion days it becomes a huge chap if you decide to cater to your guests nakurer sandesh. I really cannot mention one sandesh as i like whatever is bought whenever. The chanar payesh ....uuuffff...too good. Nowadays they have increased their variety and you get modern flavours in sandesh along with the traditional.

Bengali confectionery is all about various types of sweets. many desserts are fried foods made with sugar,milk or condensed milk. most of them based on milk products.many are flavored with almonds,pistachios & cashew nuts for the decoration.some sweets are made as a dry one but later on finish as dipped into sugar syrup mixture like very famous Gulab Jamun &¬†Rosogolla. another sweet product which is known by Sondesh also very famous created with milk & sugar. some of them are not very soft but some of them are very softer. you can feel the softness of the dessert which eating them, it will melt¬†inside your mouth gently. it is really hard to determine when exactly sondesh started referring mainly to the chhena-based sweet instead of the kheer-based sweet. but,commonly sondesh referred to the chhena-based sweet. it can be made with chhena or cottage cheese,one simlest kind of sondesh is makha sondesh prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. if you give it a shape of ball it is called kacha golla. chhena is dried and pressed ,flavored with essence of of fruits.sometimes even with the varieties of colors. another one which is my favorite one which is filled with syrup,blended with coconut or kheer ¬†and molded into variety of shapes. in the winter season there is another variant in sweet which is made by Nolen gur,made with gur or jaggery,the color of the sweet is brown or caramel color that comes from nolen gur. being a bong sweet is my first love. without a piece of sweet it is pretty much¬†difficult for me to¬†spend a whole day. this particular joint is very much famous for their sweets and the shop is very old. not only authentic and traditional sweets here you will find delicious next generation sweets. i was quite shocked after hearing that so many types of sweets are prepared by the sweet makers within no time.

We use to be frequent buyers at their shop as we use to pass by their shop almost daily. The sweet of their shop is amazing and the behaviour of their shop is also amazing. If anybody wants to buy anything from them, the customer should have time so that they can make your sweets ready. If the customer is 1 or 100 , there will be only 2 persons who will do the order ready and if you dare to say something be ready to face their arrogance. Basically customers are beggar for them they will treat like this only. Now days new trend has come if more than 5 customers you have to make a que,  when I asked them to increase the counter staff they start behaving like anything.
God help the culture of our Bengal.
Sweet shop with ARROGANT People.

The shop is very renowned throughout the city. And their sweets are good. And there are lots of good sweet shops in Kolkata. What distinguishes one from another is the customer satisfaction from their products as well as their staff courtesy. Of course this shop has good products to offer but their behaviour towards their customers reeks of arrogance. I have witnessed the appalling way their staff had behaved with a senior lady citizen who happens to be a professor of a reputed city college. She happened to be our teacher. The behaviour of this shop's staff has compelled me not to visit this place again. I hope the shop's arrogance does not shroud their success.

If you happen to cross Vivekananda Road towards Hati Bagan and take the first left, you will see a row of sweet shops. One particular shop however will be hustling with a crowd across an iron grill. The hustle has been synonymous with Nakur for the last 15 years of my life. This is a North Kolkata gem. The shop only sells the "Sandesh" in all its fusion glory. The Malai Roll is a layer of Malai filled with Mawa and kheer then rolled to perfection to melt in your mouth. A lot like a divine malai-sushi with a lot more malai. The other items include Kesar Singara, a large piece of Malai make into a pyramid filler with mawa and kheer with sumptuous amounts of Kesar and sealed with cloves. The chocolate balls, or the Chocolate Monohora, as we call it is another fusion delight. It is the conventional Bengali Mecha in its Swiss Chocolate avataar. During winter, you get a similar one with Nolen Gur and that is divine.¬†Disclaimer: Try and be there by 6, things tend to get over pretty fast and you will be left with Sugar Free sweets and a few Kora-pak. They are delicious as well but one must savour the most exquisite delights of the shop first.¬†#Mishti_Mukh

I have been coming to this place since I was a child. Over the years it's managed to maintain the same charm of the "good ol' days" but at the same time evolve to make several innovations with sandesh.
I have been to 'Girish' as my mother likes to call it uncountable times and I have loved it each time ( okay not each time but enough for the others to not matter ). I love the jolbora sandesh and the chocolate sandesh. They have sandesh which is coated with caramel or gur or chocolate and they are amazing. Honestly, I could rave on about this place but you get the point so I would stop here. If you come to Calcutta this is where you should come to experience sandesh!

To all the #Foodies with #SweetTooth, one of the legendary sweethouse (read it Palace) in #Calcutta. Try hundred of varieties (shape, size & flavour) of #Sondesh with a very cooperative & humble staff.
The only minus here is "no place to sit" but then you can have the #StreetSide ambience the one #Kolkata is famous for....!!

Do you know Bethune School. Then take the main gate of that on your right & head towards the nearest 4point, from there take the right & walk around 4-5mins. Then you will be granted to give yourself a sweet tooth by Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.

Love misti go there, fell fatigue with old style & taste you get then also you should check out this place.

They are running this outlet from 1844, so we can easily understand "Survival of the fittest". Without any doubt they are making one of best sweets of this town. But after looking this shop's look don't think their price will also like an orthodox type.

After reach there I waited around 10 mins for to give my order but that worth it. On that day I came to know there sweets are flying in various countries & outside of this cities also. As per the price they are giving the right quality & some innovative taste also.

Chocolate Singara @ Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, Kolkata ‚ò∫

This legendary and extremely popular sweet shop is known for it's wonderful range of both usual and not-so-usual aka innovative and fusion 'sandesh', the popular Bengali sweet, primarily made of 'chhena' (curdled milk) and sugar.

Having tried most of their popular creations since childhood, recently I got the opportunity to taste their Chocolate Singara.

By default, a 'singara' or 'samosa' is a deep fried savoury, wherein the bulbous and conical flour based sheath is stuffed with a spicy potato filling.

In the case of Chocolate Singara, the outer sheath was primarily made of 'chhena' and cocoa powder, and the inner stuffing comprised of thick and gooey molten chocolate infused with raisins, broken almonds and choco chips!

Needless to say, that it tasted great. 

One may not stop at having just one and one will feel quite filled upon having two!

Price: Rs. 30/-

Note: This sweet was parcelled and served at home.

We had chocolate sandesh, gur monohora and the jol bhora from here. They totally justified each of it. It tasted amazing and for quite reasonable prices as

Whenever i think about sondesh the only thing that comes to my mind is Nakur ,actually its not just a shop its a feeling. I remember when i used to stay in girish park i visited this legendary outlet almost every other day with my friends and we used to relish every bite of their amazing sondesh.You can actually smell nakur when you pass by ,the strong smell of chenna is quite distinct .
Now coming to their range of sondesh they have ample of flavours like mango,rose,ghondoraaj lembu,chocolate,coffee,strawberry,orange ,kiwi,butterscotch etc.
Some of my all time favourites would be jolbhora,coffee sondesh,chocolate singara,malai roll,kolapaker talshash,nutty sondesh,rose sondesh and finally nolen gurer kanchagolla sondesh.Now let me give you a lucid description of some of my favourite sondesh .
1.Coffee sondesh-As i am a coffee lover,this sondesh has to be in the top of my list. Coffee sondesh is normally available in the winter and most of the time its not in stock . so if you are lucky enough you would be able to have it.The softness of sondesh and the distict flavour of coffee will blow off your mind.It will cost you rs20.
2.Chocolate singara-If you are a chocolate lover ,you will love it the most.It has a filling of chocolate mixed with almonds and nuts.It will cost you rs30.
3.Rose sondesh-It has a flavour of rose as the name suggests. Sondesh is soft and flavour is also mild . it will cost you rs20.
4.Gurer kancha golla-This one is heavenly,it just melts in your mouth and it is soo soft that you can even lift in up.And i bet you , you cannot stop at one .You will feel like having it again and again.

All these are a must try and will nvr disappoint you.
And if you are a diabetic ,no worries you can go for their sugarfree sondesh.
Eagerly waiting for my next visit.

This is a very old and famous sweet shop in North Calcutta.
Staffs are sober and service is OK usually remain overcrowded most of the time.

I didn't visit this place in person but heard lot about it.
I got to taste their sweet in one of my family occasion. Each and everyone were complimenting about the taste of the sweet. Really overwhelmed to choose their product on our puja day.

Variety of sweets are available here...
I tried their

Jalbhara
Guti Monohara
Chocolate monohara
Nutty Sandesh
Mohini
Chocolate rice ball
Chocolate singara

They all tasted really well. Highly Recommendable ‚ù§

This is a legendary sweet shop located in hathibagan.I dropped by this place with few friends to try their sweets.Those were

‚Ä¢Jalbhara- This is the sweet this outlet is famous for and it indeed lived upto the hype.

‚Ä¢Gurer monohora- It had a caramelised layer of nolen gur on the outside with a filling of nolen gur er makha sandesh inside.Any word will fall short to describe how amazing this sweet was.This was an ultimate winter delight!

‚Ä¢Chocolate monohora- Most of the legendary outlets which are excellent with classics doesn't perform well when it comes to modern fusion sweets.But this place changed that thought too.This was the best cadbury mishti I've ever tasted.The dark chocolate coating on the outside was so good with chocolate sandesh filling. There was a crunchy element present in this sweet which I couldn't figure out but it was a nice addition.

Pocket pinch is very very reasonable yet the quality isn't compromised.Its top notch.No wonder why this legendary outlet was chosen to create the sandesh cake for IPL champions KKR amongst so many mishti shops in Kolkata.

The best Mishti dokan in Kolkata or might be in the whole country. Yes, you might think that I am over exaggerating but hold your horses right there if you haven't eaten the Butterscotch Sandesh or the Chocolate Singhara from them. One bite and you are transported to heaven. That feeling is almost indescribable. They prepare a wide range of sweets but my favorites are the one listed above. The prices are justified considering the quality they provide. Without wasting your time just head on to there and experience pure mishti bliss.

Must try is the chocolate singara and the kanchagolla - I mean they are both just out of the world. The malai roll didn't impress at all though. They have a variety of sondesh which can please every pallet. My favourite is the one with some stuffing in between. There was a rush outside even at a time like 11 AM. Most orders are for boxes, so it does get a little difficult to order a piece or so for having it on the spot. No rosagulla at this place which was disappointing.

Tried their Black Forest Sandesh and Gurer Kachagolla both are really awesome. Gurer Kachagolla very soft mild sweet and a mood lifting smell of Nolen Gur. Black Forest Sandesh Soft chocolate sandesh inside hard chocolate shell with rice crisper, it's definitely an ideal sandesh for a chocolate lover.

You can also try Talsash sondesh aka jol bhora, chocolate sandesh, chocolate jalbhara, the sarer roll and the kancha golla. The sandesh just melt in your mouth as soon as you put it in.

It was an experience. Being a hardcore bong, sweets are a part of my diet. Nevertheless the few sandesh (es) I devoured at this shop instilled a tranquillity which can possibly never be acquired by narcotics. There was indeed a certain level of ecstasy which rose exponentially for a few seconds during which period I kept on engulfing in a momentum higher than eating "fuchkas". After a extramundane "bhuribhoje" of sweets, there was indeed an emotional serenity which reminded me of the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha on the very eve of Maha-ashtami !

The warm rendezvous with the youngest generation of this topnotch heritage sweetshop having its only medium - sized outlet beside Bethun college in North Kolkata made my day even more grand. Our late Rituparno Ghosh had indeed done a great favour to the wedding of Abhisekh and Aishwarya Bachchan. 

Considering our hectic monotonous schedule, I can only comment: "Asche bochor abar hobe"!

People say that Bengalis love sweets. But, here I am - the Bengali, who really does not find itself lusting over sweets. Sad may be, but, this is how I am.
However, few years back, I was loitering around this place for no apparent reason and the adamant friend of mine almost forced me to this legendary outlet citing the reason that KKR's victory sweet cake was from this place. It is amazing that I am writing the review for this place so late. Well, better late than never ;)
Approaching the shop, we waited in the line for little more than 5 minutes to get our request answered. We ordered for few sandesh-es (the names which I cannot recall) and the chocolate sandesh. Having tasted the sweets, I was indeed mesmerized by the unique and smacking taste which still keeps loitering in my brains.
The staffs in the shops are too kind and soft spoken inspite of managing numerous customer and their monotonous questions. After all, I am satisfied at this outlet.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Yes, you should visit this place to get yourselves surprised.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Well, I have been satisfied enough to give them high ratings. The chocolate sandesh was really impressive and I took a packet full of it home.

Well,this review is a bit late. But it's better late than never!üòÇ after 2015's puja festival, our teacher made a sweet-tooth treat for us, as we every Bengali do after bijaya. Sir brought the two types of sweets from this legendary place!üòç  one was the chocolate rice ball or something else, can't remember that exact name. But whatever it was, it tastes damn good! Other sweet was also pretty good. I'm not too much fond of sweets but as I love the chocolate flavour, I went crazy with it. Love it. Recommended.

Had the pleasure of visiting yet another legendary a sweet shop last night. This shop, though takes a bit of effort to get to, but is worth all of it. If money is not an issue then trust me you'll love every bit of it. Starting from the mishti singaras, strawberry and butterscotch sondesh to the very famous jolbhora sondesh, all of them are just super delicious. If you have a sweet tooth then you might just lose your mind over the mind numbingly stellar mithais. I mentioned a phrase "if money is not an issue" earlier, that's because this place is not cheap. A small mishti singara costs about 30 rs, though very tasty but 30 seems a bit too much. Other items too are a tad bit costlier than other sweet shops. Other than that, it is as good as it can get.

Being from a bong family we are really fussy when it comes to MISHTI. Well this place offers the very best sandesh in entire Kolkata. The jolbhora sandesh of girish is absolutely out of this world. Girish is the ultimate name when it comes over to sandesh. They are the real boss.

That chocolate ganache covered one,which to my surprise DOESN'T have kheer in the middle( the ones which gives you an irritating feeling in your mouth and a true sense of guilt for the excess sugar) IT HAVE CHOCOLATE in the middle as well.

I will definitely give it a 6 on 5! I had heard about it so much, but never made it there till a couple of months back. I had asked them about their specialty, to which I was told by a fellow customer, that everything is special and that it was a very improper question!!! I realised where he was coming from once I had the mango sandesh and one other which I took back home. It might appear to burn a hole right through your moneybag, but the sweets are worth every paisa you pay! I hope it was closer to home, so that I could frequent. I envy North Calcuttans!

Had heard so much about this place on the internet. Was definitely on my bucket list on the places to visit in kolkata. Visited this on the first day itself and i should say it was disappointing. Tried all types of sandesh and I just did not like the taste. Maybe the taste slowly grows on you but I really felt it was over rated. Though i loved the chocolate one. It had some filling in it and was probably the best dessert of my entire trip.

It's a very famous sweet shop of North Kolkata... everyone knows about it... laid in the bylanes of Hedua... the front grill protection seems like we are in a jewelry shop... deco was not updated... they are trying to keep their heritage looks... Staffs are very enthusiastic and managing the huge crowd very well...
We tried some of their flavoured sandesh and also some jol bhora sandesh too... all are very good but not excellent or you can say it not suited by taste buds... no personal issues...
Pocket pinch was ok...

They really believe in 'name sells' and can give their customers anything they fancy in the name of 'sandesh'. Got a box of ice cream 'rotten' Sandesh and most of who ate threw up. Have been eating their sweets for more than a decade and the behaviour on complaining was also extremely disappointing and rude. Not going back. They have enough patrons one not going won't make a difference but really a turn off on the day of navami.

Bengal, the marshy tropical state of India has its class apart style statement, beauty definitions, intelligentsia which has unparalleled fame all over the world, and of course it is the haven for food lovers.You can check out here
Indian Bengali desserts your tongue will really relish.

This is an aged old sweet store serving us since 1844 with delicacy and dedication. They are the probably one Brand who has not jumped into the rat race of distribution and expansion through branches. At the end of the quality matters not the quantity.

"It is also tradition through generations. Every shop in the north has created its own identity and owners know their customers' taste buds. In north, most shops are old, and it is just the reverse in south," said Partha Nandy, whose father Pratip Nandy is fifth generation partner of Nakur shop. (TOI , 2010)

Recently few year ago they have introduced us with CHHANA CAKE which gain instant popularity after KKR winning their first ever IPL and so many starts including SRK along with our beloved Mamata Di celebrated our maiden championship by cutting a CHHANAR CAKE of enormous size.

Behind the green colored grilled counter of this iconic sweet shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street, the moiras deftly mould the chhana, fill it with crushed nuts and fill it up with syrups, to create the freshest and best ‚Äòsandesh‚Äô in the city. Nakur, as the shop is more popularly known, will want to make you taste each mishti on the counter. The classic mishtis are Madhuja, Parijat, a sandesh stuffed with pista and nuts, Mousumi, a sandesh layered with caramelized coconut and nuts, the syrup-filled Mango Sandesh and the more recent addition, Chocolate Balls, only, it is a soft chhana ball filled with solid chocolate and dusted with more chocolate strips. Start from the corner, have one, and keep pointing at more till you‚Äôve tasted them all!

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandi define the very term 'naram paaker sandesh'. Way before the evolution of all the fusion sweets, they were legendary for their jol bhoras (all year round) and monoharas (in winter). I don't believe I have ever tasted one of their creations and not liked it. Now with all the chocolate mishti competitions becoming so popular, they have completely revolutionized the concept of fusion sweets. Their chocolate sandesh, black currant sandesh and mango sandesh (with mango jelly inside) are absolute must haves. They have a chocolate version of the monohara, which is chocolatey and super yum. The latest creation is a chocolate singara, which has a chocolate covering shaped like a samosa with dry fruits and chocolate syrup stuffed inside. It is sinfully good.

THE best oldest sweet shop of North Kolkata, 5 minutes walk from Hedua (Azad Hind Bagh) swimming club. I visited here several times as I live very near to this place.
Every sweet has its own flavour. 
Recommended- Butter scotch mishti, Jolbhora, Chocolate sandesh. In winter you get nolen gurer mishti which is just awesome. And if its any bengali occassion be sure of standing in huge queues. One can also order 'Chana', its really costly but one will adore the taste of it.
Price per piece is Rs20/25/30. 
This is the sweet shop from where KKR took all the sweets when it won the T20 IPL series and not to forget about Aishwarya Rai Bachan's wedding sweets. It all came from here.

How often is it that you have sweets from a place that is over a 100 years old?? Fascinating right! After all Bengalis are known for their sweet tooth, does it come as a surprise?¬†

This legendary sweet shop is located in Hatibagan, it has stood the test of time and how! So many different variety of Sandesh, you name it and they have it. And they are all delicious.

I was there during the Durga Puja last year and tried their chocolate, mango and rose sandesh. Pretty good.¬†
What I didn't like was when I asked which one do you recommend, the behavior was rude and the guy said whatever you want to have.¬†

Anyway, do try out the different variety of sandesh. You are in for a delight.

A place that epitomises the concept of legend in Kolkata. famous worldwide, the sweet are in high demand outside kolkata. Do not go by the place, go by the quality and taste only.

It is a legendary sweet shop which has been in business for 172 years . I have tried their butterscotch Sandesh , black currant Sandesh and butterscotch Malai roll . The butterscotch flavoured sweets tasted awesome .
But the black currant version was divine .
Take a 10 minutes' walk from the Girish Park metro station and you will find this sweet shop which does not look too fancy (like most north Kolkata sweet shops)but you will surely get an idea of how popular it is from the crowd surrounding the shop . Price is on the higher side , but the sweets are worth every penny .

Kolkata aaye aur nakur sweets ka sweets nahi khaya toh kya Kolkata aaye! 
Aur agar nakur sweets ka sandesh nai laaye toh wapas hi kyun aaye!
I am totally convinced that the sweets of Kolkata are amazing and it took just one shop to convince me that. Nakur sweets was suggested to me by one of my friends and by the hype the name had already built I was assuming a huge shop and I was surprised to see how it actually looked like and how economical it is. So we tasted almost all the sweets they had to offer and I must say I loved the butterscotch flavor and the chocolate one that looked like a ferrero rocher. After tasting so many sweets I narrowed down on 3 and got them packed for home after confirming that they will last for 2 days. The third was plain sandesh. 
My advice: if u come to Kolkata visit nakur sweets and buy it for urself/home/friends and they will all love it.

A tradition, a lineage, a part of our history; this basically sums up everything related to a sweet shop, which is named as ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô. However unique the name might sound, it is their sweets that define this shop. ‚ÄòSweetness‚Äô is more of an intoxication, which is closely associated with people hailing from Bengal. It does not matter whether you have been born and brought up here, or have made way for educational or professional purposes. No meal here is completed without having a dose of sweetness being served on the plate. Whether, it be the sweet ‚ÄòAamshotter Chatni‚Äô, or a bit tangy ‚ÄòKancha Aam‚Äôer Chatni‚Äô; even if your mother does not serve you the freshly purchased Rasagulla (Roshogolla) from the market in the early morning, there would be plenty left for you in one form of the other.

Bengal has long been disputed as the holy land for sweets. Many acclaimed and proclaimed sweets have been claimed to be invented right here. Ofcourse, there are some disputes, with many people claiming otherwise, but then, in the current age, if there has to be one place which can be declared as the Holy Mecca for sweets, it has to Bengal. Be it a naming ceremony, a birthday party, a wedding function or any kind of get-together, no occasion, no celebration, no function can be thought without serving sweets to the guests or the people involved. And, if you are living here, one of the very first names which is undoubtedly going to strike your mind would be ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô.

Naturally, the question would arise! What is it that makes this place so popular? Is it the ingredients they us, Or the way they make their sweets? Is it the architects (Or as we say ‚ÄòKarigor‚Äô in Bengali), the finesse and expertise of whose that makes the sweets so delectable, or is it the plain humbleness and adapting themselves to the rapidly growing changes that makes this outlet so popular and readily acceptable to the masses? The answer to this should be that it is the combination of all of the abovementioned pointers. 

Located at 56, Ramdulal Sarkar Street, near Hedua Park, this place is an easy find. Ramdulal Sarkar Street otherwise may be called as ‚ÄòMithai Gali‚Äô, houses many popular and renowned sweet shops, out of which Nakur has to be the crowned king. If you are around Hedua, ask anyone where Nakur is, and they would be more than glad to direct you to your destination. Even then, for the uninitiated, once you reach Hedua Bus Stand from Hatibagan, keep walking straight and cross the park which would fall on your left. Once you cross the park, and reach the next signal, take a right turn. Walk for a few steps, and this outlet would be on your left.

Coming to the history, this shop was first established in the year 1844, by Mr. Mahesh Chandra Dey. At a later time, his son Mr. Girish Chandra Dey took over and the shop was named after him. Mr. Nakur Chandra Nandy, who hailed from Janai, married the daughter of Mr. Girish Chandra Dey, and eventually became his son-in-law. Janai, which is otherwise known for its delectable Manohara had already established its influence and very soon, Mr. Nakur Chandra Nandy joined the business which was already running strong being managed by his father-in-law Mr. Girish Chandra Dey at that moment. Being a railway addict, I have made several trips to Howrah ‚Äì Burdwan Chord Line, and quite often I used to drop by at Janai to taste the famous Manohara before going back home.  Being from such a holy place, the joint venture set up by the father-in-law and son-in-law slowly took up pace and since then has been running strong for decades.

¬†Coming to their products, Nakur specialized in making as many as sixty items, if not somewhat a bit less. Each one of them is a specialty of their own. However, if one has to cherry-pick, try their Monahara, Jolbhora, Chocolate Sandesh, Strawberry Sandesh, Dilkhush and other varieties. A special shout out goes to their Nolen Gur varieties, which are available only during the winter season. Nakur processes on its own raw materials, and hence nothing is bought pre-prepared from elsewhere. The shop sees heavy demand all throughout the day in any and every season and hence you would never find any unsold product left at the end of the day. This not only ensures consumption of fresh made sweets but also gives you unmatched satisfaction.

The popularity of this shop is such that, Mrs. Jaya Bachchan is said to have ordered some of their popularities on the occasion of wedding of her son Mr. Abhishek Bachchan with Mrs. Aishwarya Bachchan. Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar, Hilary Clinton, Rajiv Gandhi and other eminent and stalwarts have been awed by the sweets served here. As large as a 34 kg Sandesh was prepared by this shop to felicitate Kolkata Knight Riders in front of the Respected Governor and the Respect Chief Minister of West Bengal. The place can literally bask in the glory of their past accolades and nostalgic attachments, but such is the simplicity which prevails here, that makes them so popular and widely accepted across the entire state through length and breadth.

Very recently, Panchphoron was invited over here to taste some of the summer special mango sweets. Frankly speaking, my joy and excitement knew no bound knowing that I would get to see the entire process of how they make their sweets and later tasting the same. There were however, a few intrusions of sweets not related to mango flavor. Following would be a list of all the sweets, which we were offered as a part of the sweet tasting event.

1) Mango Singhara: Although not an Indian invention, Singhara or Samosa happens to be one of those popular snacks tried across the entire country with equal zeal and enthusiasm. A widely accepted food snack, ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô otherwise popularly known as ‚ÄòNakur‚Äô has gone a step ahead and left their fingerprints on this unique innovation of theirs. The pastry was gently brushed with mango syrup and pulp and was stuffed with finely made Mango Sandesh. The pastry was then rolled to give it a shape of a Singhara. There were no unwanted masala or spicy filling at the helm of the Singhara. The pastry was absolutely soft and the thickness was minimal. A plain and simplistic sweet, with a slight twist and turn, this one is bound to win your hearts and palette. 

2) Mango Amropali: First of the square shaped Mango Sondesh. The inner filling is of Aamshotto which alleviates the entire flavor component to another new level. The Aamshotto is topped with some finely crushed almonds. While the Aamshotto gives in the sweetness, the finely grated Almonds contribute to the nuttiness. A Midsummer‚Äôs Night Dream this one is, be ready to devour yourself and indulge into the world of Mangoes; courtesy: Amropali by Nakur.

3) Mango Moushumi: Second of the square shaped Mango Sondesh. Has a slight and subtle difference with its counterpart Mango Amropali. This one is slightly smaller in area, as well as in volume and overall thickness. This is a similar sandwiched kind of a sweet, with Mango Pulp/Mango Crush replacing the Aamshottos. The almonds also give way to Cashewnuts. This has a more liquidish appearance; however, if I have to make a pick, I would go with Mango Amropali.

4) Mango Manohara: Man/Mon = Heart; Hara = Lost; basically adds up to something or somebody who steals your heart away! A popular sweet from Janai, was probably introduced here after Mr. Nakur Chandra Nandy joined the business. The traditional Manohara has been innovated with the addition of Mango and named as ‚ÄòMango Manohara‚Äô. This one has a light and soft shell of pastry as the outer layer and the inner layer had a thick, yet a soft filling of Mango Sandesh. The sweetness was just correct (Maybe I am sweet buff). What surprised me the most was the thin pastry layer on the outside! The consistency and texture was just perfect, and to sum it up, this was truly a ‚ÄòHeart-Stealer‚Äô..!

5) Mango Jolbhora: Jol = Water; Bhora = Filled up. Logically adds up to something which is filled up with water.  Being of a mango variant, this one was filled up with a combination of Mango Pulp and Mango Syrup. The architects thereafter used the mould to fill up the gaps. The first bite was a mixture of the soft patty and thereafter, there was a sudden explosion of flavor, with the sweet Mango liquid mixture filling up the entire mouth.

6) Mango Sandesh: A typical Sandesh, brushed with Mango pulp on the sides and top. Tasted good, but was no match to the likes of others.

7) Daab Sandesh: Could not take a picture of this. ‚ÄòMalai‚Äô or Coconut pulp is used here to give a subtle but prominent hint of Daab/Coconut within the sweet. Mostly a sweet for fine palette and if you do not prefer anything strong, this one was undoubtedly an exemplary preparation.

8) Chocolate Sandesh: Picturesque and classy! Plain patty and patty drizzled with some chocolate sauce mixed together to produce a variant of matching colors. The pastry is then rolled into a cylindrical shape, and the inside is filled with a soft chocolate Sandesh. Without a shadow of doubt, this one was the best sweet for the day. The outer layer was crisp and the chocolate sandesh inside was simply bursting into my mouth.

To end, there is actually nothing much I could say more to praise this legendary shop. The owners are humble and the family understands the growing and changing needs of the people. They are interactive and make the people coming over to their shop friendly and comfortable. The highly skilled craftsmen are surely an added advantage. Artificiality is strictly a taboo here. The products are purchased raw and then processed by the shop itself. The ingredients used are of the high quality ensuring optimum taste and flavors. The lineage and culinary history of Bengali sweets would never be completed, without the induction of  ‚ÄòGirish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy‚Äô into the Hall of Fame.

Very few people knows that this place it located with the same decor,ambience opposite the lane of Hedua Park,after College Street since 1860.
They haven't changed at all. That's what I like about this shop. They tried to emerge again and again by being themselves. 
The sweets are little expensive than the rest of the other sweet shops in North Calcutta, but you can't leave Calcutta without having their Nalen gurer shondesh and other desserts.

Girish Nakur is the only sweet shop in kolkata that produces only Sandesh Items of varied tastes. No rassogolla, no curd and no snacks items like singara and the like are available with them . The items are all majestic in taste- chadropuli, golapi para, gurer jolvora, gurer/mango monohora,sarpuria,mousumi ,the different kinds of rolls -all are great to taste. Anyone with ¬†sweet teeth must at least visit a few times to taste their array of delicious sweet delicacies.

Are you a Bengali? Are you someone who resides in Kolkata? Even if your answer to the previous two questions is a no, yet you have a sweet tooth for bangali mishti then surely you have heard of this sweet shop. Forget even that. If you are a regular zomato user surely you know by now that this is the highest rated outlet in the city which shares the honour with barbeque nation. Not only Zomato, even TripAdvisor ranks this as the #1 place among 3723 places to eat in Kolkata. So what does this simple sweet shop has to offer so as to receive such a praise among the foodie community? To find out let's take a walk down the history of this shop.
More than a hundred years back Girish Chandra Dey of Simla (not to be confused with Shimla) started selling sweetmeats from this small shop. He was already making names in the industry when he was joined by Nakur Chandra Nandy from Janai, Hooghly. Subsequently Nakur Nandy married Girish Dey's daughter. However more than the marital relation, the father-in-law & son-in-law's joint business venture became the talk of the town. Their firm specialised in karapak sandesh (hard baked sandesh), however with time they have applied innovations & experiments to their products & garnered more appreciations. Not only Kolkata , their fame has spread across Bengal & even to the national level. Their patrons include some of the most well known personalities of India, like Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar, Rajib Gandhi. Not only a favourite among historical figures, recently the shop supplied chocolate, parijat & mousumi sandesh for wedding reception of Abhishek Bachhan & Aishwarya Tai. Kanchagolla & parijat sandesh have been gifted to US Foreign Secretary, Mrs. Hillary Clinton. The present prime minister of India, Mr. Modi is believed to be a fan of their sandesh too.
Locating the shop isn't tough. Locate Hedua Park, ask anybody, & they'll be more than happy to direct you to the shop, popularly to referred as 'Nokur'. Don't let the outside facade fool you. The shop may look old & shabby from outside, but even then the fantastic array of varieties of sweetmeats on display will surely impress you. The five generation family business is presently owned¬† & managed by Mr. Pratip & Pranab Nandy, latter of the duo can be found at the shop throughout the day.
Although specialising in karapak sandesh, the shop offers more than sixty items of sandesh including their specialities like Talsash, jalbhara, parijat, dilkhush, monohora & others. They boast of their product quality & rightly so as none of their products remain unsold at the end of the day. All the items are prepared afresh each day. The naram Pak sandesh has a shelf life of around a day or two, karapak upto a week, however it is adviceable to consume them at the earliest so that the intended flavour can be fully appreciated.

Recently PanchPhoron was invited over to try out some of their special mango sweets. It was a great opportunity to visit the shop, see the items in making, & have them as fresh as one could ever have. We tried the following sweets, & here's my short review of those:

Mango Monohora:
Monohora or monohora literally means 'one that steals the heart'. Such is the beauty of this sweet that the name is apt. Traditionally from Janai, this must've been brought to & popularised in Kolkata by Mr. Nakur Nandy. Now the original Monohora is already famous by itself, the newest addition being the use of mango to make it. Like the original, the mango variant too has a hard outer shell made from extra sugar, a bit too sweet for me though. Inside that shell hides the soft mango sandesh. Overall the induction of mango surely made things better.

Mango Amropali:
These are square shaped mango flavoured sandesh. Two layers of sandesh with a layer of shredded aamsatwo & bits of almonds sandwiched in between. As you bite into the sandesh the outside softness & inner crunchy almonds present to you unique texture, not to mention the mango flavour which just elevates the whole experience to another level.

Mango Mousumi:
This is similar to the previous one, only a bit smaller in size , cashews replacing the almonds, & mango pulp replacing the aamsatwo. This is undeniably a bit softer than the previous one due to the presence of pulp. Tastewise there's subtle difference, the woody flavour of almonds replaced by the cashews, but overall the sweet is as good as the previous one, if not better.

Mango Jolbhora:
The common Jolbhora gets a makeover, with mango syrup replacing the usual sugar/jaggery syrup. As mangoes are one of my weaknesses, this again impressed me as soon as I took a bite. Additional fun was seeing the item being prepared in front of our own eyes, right from putting the sandesh in the moulds, putting the syrup & then sealing the hole.

Mango Singara:
Not the usual fried snack with mashed potato filling, not the masala filling, not even the one with sujir filling. This one was mindblowingly made. A thin layer of sandesh modelled after the usual pyramidal Singara shape, hiding a filling of mango sandesh inside, & mango syrup lightly drizzled on top. Both the outer layer & the inner were soft, sweetness optimum making it the best sweet I tried that day.

Mango Sandesh:
This was regular sandesh prepared with mango syrup. Fresh & soft these too tasted superb.

Daab sandesh:
Sandesh made with grated coconut pulp. However the selection of the coconut is given importance. Not too tender, not too ripe, a medium aged coconut is procured for this one so as to make this irresistible piece of sandesh all the more mouth watering.

Chocolate roll:
Looking a bit like the chocolate roll you get to see in confectionery outlets. However in place of chocolate flavoured breads, alternate thin layer of chocolate sandesh & regular sandesh is used to wrap a inner core of, you guessed it right, more of chocolate sandesh. This one was another item I really liked. The fusion of chocolate & sandesh optimum, none overpowering the other. Surely will revisit for this item.

Needless to say, I really enjoyed this visit. It was evident from the taste of the items, why they are considered the best sweet makers of Kolkata. If its sandesh, 'Nokur' does it best. & Not only the original variant, they make the fusion sandesh as good as their unadulterated ones. For the syrup they use Alphonso mango syrup procured from Gujarat itself. Other ingredients are sourced locally & then goes through various age old techniques to finally produce the awesome sweets that people of Kolkata practically swear by. The methods may seem primitive, nothing is automated, rather relying on the skills of the craftsmen. Maybe that's the secret behind the great taste (or maybe they add some secret ingredients :D) . In any case the shop continues to uphold their name & fame, & keep doing so for generations to come. It was a privilege to be invited for this event & see the sweets in the making. Will surely go back for more.
Until then
Happy Eating
Cheers!

If you want raw Kolkata sweets, this is the perfect place for you. But you must have patience to get sweets. Because renowned sweet shop is always crowded. There are lots of options, you may get confused. Choose any, that will never disappoint you.

Purchased mango Sandesh yesterday and there was a hair inside. Pathetic, unhygienic. There is no lower option else I would have given zero star to this joint. Its a paradox that the self proclaimed number one sweet shop in the city is so callous.

Will not buy anything from here in future. See the photo yourself !

Bangali and mishti can't be perceived separately. Mishti stomps is the ethnic culinary identity of Bengal across the world. Ramdulal Sarkar Street is a mishtipoka's paradise. This place there, takes the level of mishti up by a notch to a grand existence. Their reputed aam shondesh, butterscotch shondesh and chocolate kodombo are the ones I look for all the time.

N rest is history I don't have sweet tooth but I somehow cannot resist the sondesh if it's from here.
And strangely enough I can detect it even without tasting that it's made here.

Kolkata is well known for its sweet which is for famous in the name of "Misti" among the bongs. And nakur provides the best sandesh in the city for years located in the very famous shimle para opposite to Hedua Park. All sandesh tastes awesome bt i would like to suggest ppl 2 try out monohara both chocolate and nolen gur one, jol bhora talsash, moushumi, and of course chocolate singara which is really yummy and a must try for sandesh lovers...the outside part of the samosa is made of chocolate sandesh and it has a filling of dry fruits churned in Hershey's chocolate syrup.

All hail to the king of "Mistanna" as I say to affirm the fact that this confectionary is from Bengal and is a pride to the Bengalis.
I had been personally visiting this for the last 8-9 years now and to my unfortunate self, I missed reviewing it. My personal recommendations are - Nolen Gurer Monohora (out of the world), Jolbhora, Chocolate Monohora, Blueberry and Strawberry Sondesh. Each and every sweet speaks firmly of the name of the establishment.¬†
Just recalled - one of my friends used to ask me precisely how do I rate a sweet shop, and my answer to that was "Girish Nakur is the benchmark" ! Hope it keeps upto my expectations forever.

This Sweet shop of North Kolkata is very famous not only for its old heritage, but also for delicious sweets... This Shop is situated just opposite of Hedua park at Hatibagan and 5 min walk from Girish Park metro station... We went there at morning cause I know that this place becomes very crowded at evening...
I have tasted 5 different types of sweets here ( Chocolate roll, Roll sandesh, Khir Singara, Pink Sandesh, Chocolate Singara)... all were tasty and mouth watering...
The singara types sweets were the best...
Price is same as of any renowned sweets shop in Kolkata...
#Best Sweets in North Kolkata and one of best in Kolkata....

Well, to begin with this sweet shop, I must  say this is one of the traditional and heritage bound sweet shops of Kolkata, specialy north Kolkata. Located very much strategically opposite to "hedua park" and beside Bethune college, this sweet shop has maintained its repute by delivering mouth watering and exceptional sweets that are famous all over. All of the items are unique to the taste buds, "rabri" and "chocolate sandesh" being my favourite. Being a bethunite myself I frequently went to this shop to satisfy my sweet cravings with my friends. The shop always remained crowded with people who waited to get their packet of sweets. Recommended to all [ except diabetic people :-)]

I was on a 2 day mini trip and i wanted to visit all the legendary places i could. This place was highly suggested by many people and even more by the locals. It is located quite inside and at the last day on the way to the airport i decided to go there. There was a lot of people buying stuff. So, apparently i was told this place only keeps sandesh and several varieties of it . I tried the plain sandesh, mango, blueberry and many others. The best andesh i have ever had was here.¬† In my personal opinion , the plain sandesh and the malai sandesh were the best. it was sad i couldn't take the malai one home because it wouldnt last till the next day tha tells how fresh it is made but i took all the flavours i could which accounted to half of my baggage not surprisingly.

As a kid, pandas hopping in the north was never complete without a round of mishti at Theo's legendary shop but now we go to nakur to pick up sweets almost every other month. Their chocolate strawberry and butter scotch Sandesh are to die for. Their Chandrapuli is yummy too. This shop is always busy and you would never get personal attention here, the old feel of the shop beings me back agin and again.

Everybody knows this place. Very famous. Awesome sweets both taste wise and look wise. I have a different problem though. I sometimes think that their employees are a little bit arrogant. Why I am saying this is cause they don't give that much attention to you for telling the price of sweets and all unless you are buying a lot of them. And also I think the background of 10 half naked men making and baking sweets aren't pleasant as well. Any way it just my thought. I love their sweets any way.

There that sums it all up. You can't be a quintessential Bengali with the famous Bangali sweet tooth and not have had sweets from one of the oldest sweet shops of Calcutta. And if you haven't, uhm what have you been doing all this time??? Rush. NOW. 
Besides the traditional oldies, try their newer fusion sweets. The several varieties of chocolate sandhesh are delicious.

A legend when it comes to sweets. The culinary history is not complete unless you find a place to mention about these two legends who had joined hands together to form what is undoubtedly the sweet heaven for the people residing in Kolkata. Located opposite Hedua and besides Bethune, this place is always abuzz and is hard to miss with the enthusiasm all around.

What should you try? Well everything! Do not even think of giving anything a miss here. Each of their sweets are uniquely prepared and have a taste and specialty f their own, not to be found in any other sweets. My personal favorite is the Butterscotch Sondesh and the Chocolate balls. Else, one can also try the Jolbhora, Monohara, Strawberry and others.

The prices may seem to be slightly a notch up, but one would never complain after having sweets from this place. There is not a soul in this city, who wouldn't vouch for this sweet shop.

This is probably the oldest sweet shop in Kolkata and definitely the best. If you are in Kolkata then this is the place you must visit. Authentic bengali sweets. Their 'chandrapuli' and 'parijat' are a must try. Their chocolate sandesh and butterscotch sandesh are also doing well.

BEST SANDESH IN THE BONG WORLD

TRIVIA- NAME
Girish Chandra Dey started manufacturing SANDESH more than a hundred years ago. Subsequently the late Shri Nakur Chandra Nandy joined him as a partner. Since then the firm became well known as Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.

SWEETS
This is the first time I am reviewing a "Mishtir Dokaan" but this place is far greater than just a sweet shop.
We dont live in Kolkata so when we come down its basically a frantic search for the best of Bengal in those few days.. and we did find a gem of a place around two years back.

Had heard about it a lot but had thought it to be one of those really hyped ones.

So the day we came here it was August i believe and it was afternoon , surprisingly still the counters could not be reached because of the crowd of Mishti seeking Bangalis.
¬†¬†
We met Partha Da (owner) who helped us with what had to be tried
1)Butter Scotch Sandesh - SUPERHIT The flavour and the way it melts in your mouth..Easily a competitor to Hyped European Milk Chocolates.
2)Mango Sandesh - Equally good.. with the softness and the flavouring done with the syrup was great.
3)Lebu Sandesh another hit with the Flavour and texture.
4)Black Forest was straight out of those 5 star desert chefs.. Perfect taste and hard on the outside and soft on the inside.
5)Jalbhara - Authentic to the core.

There were many others whose names i cant remember but each one of them were Superb both in taste & Quality.

They dont have any branches because Quality cannot be compromised.

The place were the mishti is made was really neat and clean.

A special mention for Partha Da who has good knowledge about what he is into and strives to deliver the best to the customers.

WHEN IN KOLKATA DO VISIT THE PLACE..

Cheers

Really love their chocolate balls, that is one sweet which has no competition, both in terms of taste and in terms of quality, also the price is so feasible that a person needn't think twice about gobbling down those sinful delicacies.

This sweet shop is one of the few left in North Kolkata serving the best sweets. Located in the opposite lane of Hedua this shop is hard to miss as a big queue is always there. The shop is covered with a big green grille which I have been seeing from my childhood. No frills attached. They clearly know where they should spend their money.

My all time favorite is the black forest Sandesh which I always end up buying everytime I go. For 10 rs a piece it could not get better than this! All the flavors and types of mishtis can be tried and I can vouch that every piece will be loved.

I have a terrible sweet tooth. I'm a huge fan of rosogolla, the Bengali type, especially the winter specialty - brown nolen gurer rosogolla. And given that this *Legendary* sweet shop is the birthplace of so many varieties of the usual sweets, it would be a shame to not get a foodgasm by just looking at the chocolate sandesh or paan sandesh and rabri. Okay, I'm going in nostalgia; you just don't get authentic Bengali mishti (note: not sweets) with *that* twist of innovation anywhere else.

They are THE BEST for bengali sweets in Kolkata.Other giants like Balaram Mallik and Bhim Nag and even Makhan Das gives them.tough competition,with each having their area of excellence.but overall, they are the best.

A modest sized shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street,opposite Hedua and beside Bethune College,it appears more like a liquor shop with its grill facade than a sweet shop.But the buzzing crowd outside at all hours of the day will make you realise that you have come to the mecca of sweets.

What to try when in the store?Any sandesh for that matter and you will not be dissappointed.My personal favourites are the Butterscotch roll( soft sandesh rolled inside thick sheets of dry malai with caramelled butterscotch bits) and their latest offering,the chocolate dry fruit singara ( chhena coating flavoured with chocolate with a filling of honey soaked raisins almonds and cashews).They are orgasmic.

Reach the shop at 11 am to get these specialities,They get over by the afternoon.

Located near the Scottish Church College this shop has stood the test of time, earning it a 'Legendary' status. Once you are there, you'll find it humming always. A pretty old ranshackled shack though. But don't go with the look. The genius lies in their hands. The marvel is their creations. "Gurer jolbhora" and "Karapaak taalshash" are my personal favourites. There are many other items that can amaze your taste buds. Sweets made of "Guur" here are simply to die for. A must try.

Sandesh- that's the name synonymus with this legendary sweet shop of Kolkata.
Girlish Chandra dey,founder of the shop,had an extraordinary son-in-law Nakur Chandra Nandy. But Nakur was a lazy person,used to lie down everyday. On the deathbed,Girish called him and made him promise that Nakur would take the charge of the sweet shop.after Girlish's death,Nakur took the charge and showed his exellence in the field of Sandesh making.The sweet revolution of Bengal started with Nandy.

The college days memories bring a pleasure to the mind. This place is situated close to Scottish Church college near Hedua. There are many legendary sweet shops in kolkata, but for me Girish is definately the best. Though this place is not situated in the main street still it is generally crowded. They do not have any sitting place and you only have the option of takeway. They have a variety of sweets and most of them taste delicious. You will probably get confused on what sweet to try. 

Cons : The staffs are always arrogant. The place is difficult to locate, if you are new to this place.

One look at the shop and you would understand why it is under the 'Legendary' category!!

Located quite close to Hedua Park; this shop has been around since decades.
I have been there about 5 to 6 times and I have never seen it Not crowded!!

The staff is efficient.

Coming to the sweets. They are heavenly!!

Malai wrap; guler malai wrap; gurer jolbhora, rose sandesh, chocolate chocolaty ball (not sure if this is the correct name) are my few favorites.

The sugar-free sweets are a rage among all those diabetic Bengalis who cannot let go of Mishtis :D

Mishti-Lovers' Paradise :D

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:¬†
With so many renowned Sweet shops all around the city this place at Hatibagan Region basically falls just Opposite of Hedua park. With some fine quality and mouth watering sweets in the stocks they provide some excellent stuffs. Always crowded with people to buy sweets and sweets been sold like purchasing potatoes in there. With in my thoughts for so long finally i get to taste the few of them.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Its a takeaway simply.

SWEETS :¬†
With so many varieties and option in there it made me really confused what to eat and what to leave. So going hard at the sweets i decided to have the Gacha Golla, Chocolate Laddu and Gacha golla in form of sandesh.

Gacha golla was just excellent. It was so soft and light than it broke when i lifted it with pressure.

taste was so yummy and it was so fresh.

Chocolate Laddu was a good pick as suggested by my friend. It was hard filled with chocolate. Been kept out from the fridge for sometime it got a big soften but still was tasty enough.

Gacha golla in sandesh was as same as  like the first one but there was a surprise change in it. It contained the flavor of rose and the taste and smell could be felt beautifully.

ALL THREE SWEETS : 9/10

QNQ AND PRICES:¬†
Quality is very very good and a bit factor on the sizes of some sweets. Prices are fine as per the type of quality they are providing.

CONCLUSION:¬†
Always heard that this place surprises you with there quality sweets and today they surprised me for sure. Anywhere in the city you should come to visit this place once.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Well one of the oldest sweet shop in calcutta. Doesn't need a introduction the north calcutta giants delivers the best sweets and surprises me every winter with those delicious nolen gur's. Though the price is little bit on higher side but the quality taste and uniqueness needs to be paid a lot of memories assosiated with these and special mention the 'jolbhora's' they are best in class. Adding up to this having the owners son as a friend is a big bonus itself. Giving relief and encouraging my sweet tooth. Guys hats off....

Its a innovative collection of Bengali sweets. Their speciality is Manohara. You must taste Chocolate monohora, Gurer manohara etc. You cant stay back without appreciation. Norom paaker nolen gurer Talshah is fabulous. Butter scotch sandesh is highly recommended.

Price is bit high. But its worthy... :)

Nalen gurer monohora is always mothwatering and delicious. I bought this for 100 times minimum. But the pathetic thing is 3 weeks ago I bought them for some of my friends. then the quality was down dont know why. The smell and flavour was not equally same. I felt very sorry as I was not able to make them happy that time. :-(

Located near Hedua in north Calcutta this is one of the legends of sweet making in the city. Its been in existence for over a decade now and is a huge hit for all the sweet lovers. Over the years it has evolved from making traditional bengali sweets to fancy ones using chocolate, butterscotch, strawberry, black currant amongst othere. You can easily pick any sandesh and all of it tastes super. I can pick the kachagola and the malai rolls as my favourites.

Another legendary sweet shop near hedua park. You can't resist yourself from falling in love with the mouth watering sweets here. As its a very old shop you will find the kitchen on the backside of the shop. They use to  make all the sweets in front of the customer which is quite interesting. Unfortunately they don't maintain hygiene. Also slightly overpriced. But still one of the best Misti shop in town. My personal favorite is the chocolate ball.

If u visit this shop u will not be satisfied by eating only 1 sweet,eventually u will end up eating 4 or 5 sweets.

Want to gorge on top quality "Sandesh" ? - here is the shop. Right opposite in the lane to Hedua Park, this venture has been serving people for years. Their jolbhora, orange/pineapple/chocolate/kiwi sandesh are awesome. The best for me was their butter scotch sandesh which I ordered too for my engagement. The quality of their cottage cheese (chhana) and the amount of sweetner or the authentic syrup that goes in - are truely to die for. Overall - Hugely recommended.
One word of caution for non-Kolkatans - don't ask them for any rosogolla or gulab jamun - Nakur is only meant for Sandesh.

My personal favourites are Gurer malai roll, mango moususmi, parijat, dilkhush, gurer jalbhara and karapak talsash. A must go place for every people having sweet tooth. Forget the price tag , just love it.

This place already has a rating of 4.9 on zomato. So that rating speaks volumes about the quality and taste. Absolutely delicious - are the Sandesh 's here.

The jalbhara or the gur monohara are yum.

One feedback ¬†: try starting rosogulla or rasmalai or baked rosogulla.

Otherwise, maybe the best sweet shop in town. Its not everyday that you have to stand in a queue to get the sweets from a sweet shop. So this shop has arrived. Wonder why its 4.9 and not 5 on Zomato already !!

There are sweet shops, and then there are sweet shops. Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy is certainly one of the best of the lot. Even for someone who is not a big fan of "mishti", I am drawn to this place, just off Bidhan Sarani, time and time again for its mouthwatering array of sandesh. The sandesh are astonishingly smooth in texture, no lump or grittiness in sight. And the flavours are marvellous, ranging from the classics like kanchagolla and korapak to innovative flavours like strawberry, blackcurrant, butterscotch and chocolate., which actually do taste like what they are supposed to. I particularly like their Gurer Monohora, comprising a thin brittle shell of jaggery encasing a rich and wonderfully soft kanchagolla like mixture inside. No wonder you never find this place without a crowd. It is a must-visit for all sweet lovers.

This is not a review of Nakur . This is a humble confession of the fact that i am a big fan of their mishti and i just love it . The 4.5 rating is just would be described as a nakhra :P Their sweets are simple awesome and by sweet i should say sandesh. My personal favourite is black current sandesh but i would request anyone living in¬† bengal or and outsider to go there with a big appetite and try their sandeshes one after another . Forget the price tag , just go for the awesomeness.

A must for every people who has a sweet tooth :)

I am not a sweet loving person but i drool on their sweets. Their chocolate sandeshes and occasion special sweets are unmatched in comparison to other mistir dokans. Most of the time, I see varieties flying away within moments of placement. If you want to have original Kolkata flavor, go and have GCD&NCD.

1)Ambiance(0.5/1): Being one of the most loved sweet shops in my home (have been eating from here since quite some time now), they really need to up their ambiance now! the most attractive part of their shop(apart from the sweets of course)? that huge photo frame of KKR team, SRK, Juhi chawla and Mamata "didi" cutting a cake prepared by them!

2) Food (1/1): this IS their strength and our family, our family friends - all of us LOVE their sweets! this time they introduced their MISHTI SHINGARA (Sweet Samosas). DELICIOUS is the word! Right amount of sweetness, resembling our good old samosa and filled with dry fruits inside - it was marvelous! Loved it! They have a chocolate variation as well but we were too full after a family foodathon! :P

3) Service (0.5/1) : I really wish their service was as good as their products! They were impolite to us , in spite of us waiting in line for over 15 minutes to eat their sweets. They basically need to work on their crowd management skills and I'm sure they will be perfect :)

4) Innovation/techniques (1/1): Sweet samosa - I think it's an innovation by itself!¬†

5) VFM (1/1) : They are a little more expensive as compared to the other sweet shops but their products are definitely worth the money! Dry fruits filed sweet samosa (decent size) was Rs.35/- per piece. I was happy to pay it and eat it up! :) I would have given them a 4.5 but service does matter. I am sure they will keep making many more yummy treats for their customers!

A waiting for sweets always remains sweet no matter how long the queue is. An age old sweet shop still is the king, Nakur, lives in every bong's heart in every occasion. Their classics Parijat, Kanchagolla, Jolvora Talsansh remain unbeatable. Other than their hyped chocolate preparations, try Coffee and Mulberry. And also the Apple sondesh and Nutties are worth trying.

No complains regarding the taste, size or quality of the sweets. Simply awesome. I felt the price was also okay, considering the really good quality of the sweets. But they should do something about the service. Its a very busy shop, so they should really consider to prep up the service! Anyways, my  fave was the chocolate ball and the butterscoth sandesh and..okay, I loved all the 10 variety of sweets I had bought. One thing that put me off though, was the condition of the workplace of the shop, it is visible from the place where you order for the sweets. I feel, the place where food is prepared must be spic and span, but it looked quite dirty from outside.

The sweets are excellent. No second opinion about it. The overall customer management would have been better. No fun in hustling and bustling for your turn of sweetness :). I had strawberry and chocolate sondesh and they were very good. The quality speaks for itself after you take a bite. I should mention the chocolate sondesh again and again as I have never tasted chocolate which is so good. For exciting the taste buds of someone who is averse to sweets, you guys deserve this rating.

Girish chandra dey and nakur chandra nandy hereby now shall be referred to GCDNCN not to be mistaken as the mathematical gcd and lcm. Although the parallels between them are quite strong. Catering to wide range of human palates, and most importantly emotions, it has the sweet for simply every occasion. A light after lunch sweet? Sure. A mid day lazy feeling sweet? Sure. Want to pig out on sweets sweet? Got your back jack. Post break up blues sweet? Anytime bro. I wouldn't go on to comment about the delectable nature of the sweets or the fact that each one is a winner in itself. Add to it, the fact that it has a quaint old calcutta charm woven over it. Those shops you remember your grandmother taking you to and buying sweets and you returning with the "best day ever" smile all over your face. This one will remain in my boom dotted with stars all over. 
Thank you GCDNCN

I'm a little ashamed to admit that I wasn't aware of this place until recently when I was looking up places to eat in around Shobha Bazaar on Zomato, while planning a day out during Durga pujo this year.

The fact that it was established in 1844 is enough to get anyone curious. The high ratings on Zomato were also reassuring. So we went down there early in the morning of Bijoya Dashami, as testament to our Bangali heritage.¬†

I'd expected a bigger, shinier and grander spread of extravagantly priced sweets much like you'd find in one of the branches of the big names in the mishti business. Sitting in a line of sweet shops, the modest green iron-grilled window was surprising. Inside, you could see some of the staff still asleep, their sheets drawn around them. The walls were old and blackened with age and filled with framed pictures of garlanded deities, cricketers and politicians with their custom-made sweet spreads. Among all this was also a newer, brighter framed request for a Zomato review.¬†

Even at 7 in the morning, there was quite a crowd outside the shop. We picked up what looked most tempting, and as we later found out was one of their specialties, their chocolate mishtis.¬†

This sweet shop reminded me of many other sweet shops. Half remembered memories of mihidana and gujia bought at old shops in a little town with my grandfather or the rosogolla and barfi I had with my friends just yesterday at the air-conditioned shop near the university, I forget which.¬†

The great thing about Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, apart from its delightfully long name, is that it is as if of the old world adapted to the new, much like the city it belongs to.

Another heritage on the department of confectionery... This place is a pride of Calcutta, more so for the North Calcuttans... the place which had provided for sands in the marriage if Abhishek and Aishwarya or for that matter, invented the sandake for kkr's victory in the Ipl, is a must visit if you are in calcutta. Try out the chocolate sandesh for a fabulous experience.

Humble outlet in a quiet lane but truly fantastilicious sandeshes. The sale is made through the grill covering a large window with customers crowding on the footpath. Last evening was not very busy so snatched the opportunity to try out 1 piece of each sandesh. Truly loved each one of them. The sweets were of the right texture and had the precise measure of sweetness. Each one - chocolate, strawberry, butterscotch - melted smoothly in the mouth leaving me yearning for more. Try the Malai Roll here which is best amongst equals. Kudos to this place! I shall be back for more

But one fine day i was in north kolkata with one of my close friend nd he knows dat i love sweets but i don't like sandesh..... so he pursuaded me to just have one bite of sandesh from dis shop nd so i did went for one bite ....... But it was not my last bite it ended up me having 4 pieces of sandesh...... it was like i m into some kind of drug which is so much addictive dat i was not able to stop my self ........ so hats off to such a great sweet shop...... But as i say flavour, taste varies from person to person so plz do give it a try...

Personally I am a traditionalist.i believe Bengali heritage of sweets should broadly stick with "chaana". So whatever experimentation they should do the base should be "chaana". That's where Nakur Nandy and his legendary sweet shop comes in the picture. They are indeed high on the price so are many other sweet stores these days.
The main aspect is what you get for the price.if you ask them to suggest a sweet which you can savor for a week the answer will be none. They always suggest for immediate consumption in one day because they know how delicate these sweets are. And trust me you won't be able to stop yourself from consuming in one day üòä

The best Shandesh outlet in the city, the Chocolate and Wgite Chocolate Monohoras being the best of the lot. 

I am not a person with a sweet tooth, and yet this outlet is the only one in the entire city, which I think I can say has this foodgasmic quality, which any other food shop in the entire city lacks, and this is, keeping in mind,the fact that Kolkata has some of the widest range of food that anyone can find across the length and breadth of the country.

Only, I wish they had their shop a bit more done according to the modern sensibilities and the staffs were a bit more courteous- may be these lack of nouvelle concepts are what makes them what are they now, and that is pretty good- considering Calcutta is a place for best Sandesh and Mishti.

Mango monohora, chocolate sondesh, butterscotch sondesh, malai roll..the list is endless. Each and every item on display should be tried. 
This shop has been featured on n number of food shows and they also catered for bachhan junior wedding.

This place was, is and will remain the best bengali sweet shop. There's not a thing about them, which one can complain about. Their chocolate balls are to die for, and the melt-in-your-mouth sandesh coated with jaggery is a bunch of wholesome goodness. Their innovative attempts such as the strawberry sandesh, black current sandesh and mango sandesh are as delicious as the traditional delights like the tal-shash. When you'll visit this place, you'll just be pampered with choices, and be overwhelmed by the variety they have to offer.

Nakur, as it is popularly known as amazes me with one particular characteristic. How do they keep doing it for generations after generations?
They are the best innovators, creators, makers of Sandesh in the world. The Butter Scotch Sandesh is my personal favourite but with this sweet shop anything and everything is one's favourite.
To sum it up Nakur is not an eatery or a sweet shop, it is an institution.

Well i guess i wont be wrong if i say that i have grown up eating their sandesh and my day doesnt get complete if i dont eat girish ch deys sandesh everyday . i believe the quality they provide  can never be compared to any of the sweet shops in kolkata..You can say there is a complete transformation of the variety they provide Starting from my school days when they doesnt use to have much varieties but was very much popular for their Gulab Patti Sandesh till now when they have multiple varieties all of them are simply delicious..
My entire family being a sweet lover we are very fond of their sweets and i guess i have tried all of the varities made by them..My all time favourite are their Pineapple Sandesh,Butter Scotch,Straweberry,
Gulab patti,Nariyal Sandesh & many more...
During winters thier Nolen Gur Kocha Gola and their Taalsha Sandesh with Nolen Gur are my all time favourite..I have made all my relatives taste their sandesh and they are very very fond of them...
My relatives who stay outside kolkata are also very fond of its sweets because of the superb quality and delicious taste because i make it a point to send them their sweets because i dont want my friends and relatives to miss something really worth while..
Keep up the quality and we are waiting for the new & innovative varities of your sweets...

The popularity of Nakur is justified by its sweets which any sweet lover will love. It goes without doubt that they are highly priced but the quality and taste of sweets beat all others. On a recent visit i found an addition to their array of sweets, a chocolate singara, which had a soft chocolate crust and nuts and molten chocolate inside. Nakur incessantly goes on experimenting with various combinations of sweet flavours to bring out new sweets. And it does that ever so successfully, a reason why it is so highly praised. Popular picks among frequent buyers are golapi pera, chocolate sandesh, parijat amongst others.

The one & only sweet shop in Kolkata, probably in the whole world who experiments & plays with sweets in extreme enthusiasm levels. They tried to mix some sweets with some other sweets for example Jelly with Curd or Sandesh in some extraordinary levels that you can't even imagine. Those experiments not just gets the success they also provide satisfaction to each & every persons mouth, doesn't matter the person like sweets or not. This sweets tastes so great that words can't explain. This sweets are meant to be feeled by the mouth & soul of your heart. Undoubtedly this is the best ever sweet shop in Kolkata. The only bad thing over here is the price, if you count this as bad. But every rare artwork comes with a price tag & this sweets are none less than an artwork.
Conclusion : Hands down, No comparison, The best ever sweet shop in Kolkata. Every sweet lover over there are missing their real goal if they haven't tried this one.

I never had such fetish about sweets. But the chocolate sandesh from this heritage sweet shop will keep your mind blown. You shall never wish to have cadbury once you place a bite of the chocolate sandesh from this shop. Coming for Rs. 10/piece, they offer a variety of sweet preparations with chocolates all in the same price and all are outstanding.

I simply LOVE their mishti. In this street their are other three top sweet shops but this has easily made their own identity with their variety. Though price is little high the quality is best. They only make sandesh which are best in Kolkata. They offer a large variety as well as flavours and they make many sweets sugar free. Personally I love their chocolate mishties specially Dark Fantasy...yummy!!! Please if you have not been here visit this place as early as possible...trust me you will not regret.

I'll just add to the raptures on this page :) The gud and non gud sandesh, chocolate square and most of all the strawberry/mixed sandesh, were exquisite. It is beautiful how the gud oozing out from the middle of the sandesh and a tiny piece of caramel atop the strawberry sandesh add so much to the sweets. The chocolate ball comes a far second when in competition with these superb creations.

A must visit place for any foodie in Kolkata. Even a diabetic person cannot resist the second piece of any sweet of this shop. 'Kacha Gola' and Korapak (winter special) are my all time favorites . Chocolate Sandesh is also a must try .¬†
I must say this shop has never compromised with the quality of any product.¬†
Although the service is little slow due to rush during peak hours (mostly morning and evening).

The place is a paradise for people loving Bengali Mishti.No sophistication....only sweet awesomeness..
Location--Ramdulal Sarkar Street...there is a bus stop there...and every Bengali at least belonging to North Kolkata knows about the place..so no difficulty in finding...
Sweets---Their sweets are the best in Kolkata if not in West Bengal as a whole...try their choco rabri,blueberry sandesh,chocolate sandesh,pista sandesh and get lost in pure bliss..quality is no1
Cost--a bit on higher side...quality sweets cost all least Rs 20
I run to the place whenever my tongue craves for some sweetness...and the rest is...well try it for yourselves...
A must go....

The best sweet shop in Kolkata (if not in the whole world). Period. These people have taken the art of sweet making to a whole new level. The richness of flavour and the overall quality are almost unparalleled. Close your eyes and take a pick ... you cannot go wrong in Nakur (as we refer to this shop in short). Add to it the odd charm of a zero-bling get up of a typical north Calcutta shop.

Their customers database includes celebrities from India and abroad but that does not mean that a common man can get impressed.They are them selves celebrity among the confectioners from city of Joy.
I wanted to see badly, what makes Nokur Sweets so special? Why people are mad for them?Why people across globe drools through the green grill on a negligible glass case where there are way more good looking sweetshops across Kolkata.What is Nokur's way?I Got the answer after I tasted one sweet.Oh my God!!!These people play with your taste bud which leaves a deep impression in a sweet tooth's mind. 
I stay alone,still I bought almost 20 sweets.
Its twisted, kind of new wine in old bottles.
Standing in the amalgamation of Web age and a traditional old Kolkata Nokur stands firm with their products.Trade mark.
Never imagined that Sondesh can meet butter scotch, black currant , strawberry, mango ... Sondesh can stay within a dark chocolate wrapper. Feeling Intoxicated.
Another from my bucket list - met.
All the best.Keep blessing us.

First 5 from me.

The best sweets I have ever tasted.
I basically had its Sandesh of varied flavours like butterscotch,strawberry.It also serves various others.
Chocolate rolls are yum.
The best is Sandesh and that too butterscotch (mouth watering really)
I am cutting 0.5 stars because of lack of space to stand and long waiting(because of long queues) .Must say one needs to be an expert to push through people to get your number because there is always a huge crowd and as expected no system of queue.

They might be over priced but the taste of their sweets is unparalleled. Their fusion sweets have always been a hit. I recently had their chocolate malai roll. They were Rs. 20 a piece but well worth the price. They one of the oldest  sweet shops in Kolkata and have built a reputation for serving only sandesh. There are no "rosh er Misti" available. If you're looking for rosogollas and ladygennis then don't come here. But if you want the best "sandesh" look no further.

The sweets are made to suit the sweet tooth of 19th century Bangali babu. Same taste, same flavour and definitely not too syrupy. The jalbhoras and the naram paks and the rasogollas and Khajas made on special occasions are too good and mouth licking in nature.

The Hedua area is one of those pockets of Kolkata which has a spin of its own‚Äî a calmer orbit inside the earth's blue whirl. Meters away, the busy north Kolkata traffic is like a crazy beast, growling for attention.  The 150-year-old sweet shop, Nakur, fits into the picture like the piece that completes a jigsaw puzzle. It‚Äôs a hole-in-the-wall, quite literally. The old-fashioned glass display counter has heaps of ¬†choloate sandesh, raspberry sandesh and butterscotch barfis ‚Äì culinary achievements  that have grabbed headlines across the city for the past few years.
Though it‚Äôs difficult to pick a favourite from Nakur‚Äôs wide array of sandeshs, one can of course wax eloquent about its most popular products. The choco-chip sandesh is a delightful play of textures where the smoothness of the cottage cheese blends in perfectly with rich granules of dark chocolate. The raspberry sandesh is another successful innovation, an gentle gush of tangy raspberry preserve greets you once you bite into the sandesh. You can also try more traditional items like Parijat, which is a pistachio-flavoured sandesh.

The location is a bit busy part of town but the sweets will have more than made up for your ordeals. Have a korapaak or a taalshash if you want to go traditional or opt for the ferrero rocher sandesh or the chocolate puli if you are in an experimental mood. It will all be worth it. Eternal bliss!

The name itself is self explanatory. A legendary place for non-Bengalis to learn why we take pride in our Sandesh. It is one of the great 'Mistir Dokan' Kolkata has to offer. The sweets are as tasty as they get, they come in a variety of flavours and colours and each is better than the last. Some of them literally melt in the mouth. If they have any specially flavoured sandesh, ¬†can be rest assured that it is generously filled with the pulp or cream. Start with the chocolate ones. If u have a sweet tooth, this is one of the places you should land yourself at.

Superb quality sandesh with mind-blowing taste.¬†
They have so much variety (Kiwi, Orange, Butterscotch, Chocolate, Mango, Rose, Malai roll and many many more) that it is difficult to choose one. ¬†Basically, their tagline should be - 'No one can eat just one'.

Their Strawberry sandesh, Blackcurrant sandesh and Chocolate sandesh are my personal favourites.¬†
I recently tried another sandesh that had a hint of coffee flavour - it was absolutely amazing and it definitely gets a place in my 'favourites' list.¬†

The best part is that when you have eaten half the sweet, a¬†syrup will ooze out (strawberry syrup if it's strawberry sandesh, chocolate syrup if it's chocolate sandesh etc) and the taste of the syrup along with the sandesh makes the whole experience very unique and flavourful.¬†
They even make a Diabetic sandesh and it is so good, it doesn't seem like it is meant for diabetics only.¬†

This is one of the best sweet shops in Kolkata for a mad-over-meetha person (like me).¬†It looks dull and shabby from the outside but do not go on the appearance; as appearances can be deceptive.

It was a sweet discovery while riding in the old city... Saw a huge line of people standing in a que and the sweet shop name and estd date made me enquire about it.

Met the owner who made us try all the delicate and mouth melting sweets.

Each one felt better than the last one and we ended up leaving with a sweet tooth... :)

Nakur - One of my favourite sweet shop in Kolkata. Sweet prices are little high but it is absolutely worthy.. all are very fresh and the sweetness they maintain in every sweet is perfect. I have tried all their sweets and can not say which one is better... though one must try their jol bhora talsash, chocolate , malai roll , and mango sandhesh.. If you haven't been here for once yet, then definitely you are missing a part of heaven...

Nakur Chandra Nandy and sandesh have almost become synonimous..It is the quintessential sweet franchise which has been satiating our hunger for sweets of superior quality for more than 150 years..and till today they have maintained the same quality..Amazing indeed!!Tasting Sandesh from this place is an experience in itself, hard to describe in words..This place has been a cornerstone of our culture,tradition and History of Kolkata..Their DIlkhus,Parijat,Monohara have become legends in themselves..From KKR to Sachin Tendulkar to Amitabh Bachchan,their reputation have stretched all over the world..I personally adore their White Chocolate Sandesh more than anything else..the moment it pours down ur taste bud..u feel in heaven..in this era when you find so much degradation in quality around you..this place indeed is an exception..If u r a sweet tooth and haven't visit this place yet,you r missing out on something very precious..

The variations of chocolet mishti is tremendous. Its comendable how they capture the traditional sweet in complet chocolet taste. Nakur er sondesh have been part of many our occassions and will remain to capture the places.

Went there with my friends during Durga Puja. The chocolate sandesh and the strawberry sandesh tasted like heaven. Although the out let was not that great, I mean a bit shabby. But as far as taste is concerned, it was mindblowing.

Nakur - One of my favourite sweet shop in Kolkata. Sweet prices are little high but it is absolutely worthy.. all are very fresh and the sweetness they maintain in every sweet is perfect. I have tried all their sweets and can not say which one is better... though one must try their jol bhora talsash, chocolate , malai roll , and mango sandhesh.. If you haven't been here for once yet, then definitely you are missing a part of heaven...

Nakur Chandra Nandy and sandesh have almost become synonimous..It is the quintessential sweet franchise which has been satiating our hunger for sweets of superior quality for more than 150 years..and till today they have maintained the same quality..Amazing indeed!!Tasting Sandesh from this place is an experience in itself, hard to describe in words..This place has been a cornerstone of our culture,tradition and History of Kolkata..Their DIlkhus,Parijat,Monohara have become legends in themselves..From KKR to Sachin Tendulkar to Amitabh Bachchan,their reputation have stretched all over the world..I personally adore their White Chocolate Sandesh more than anything else..the moment it pours down ur taste bud..u feel in heaven..in this era when you find so much degradation in quality around you..this place indeed is an exception..If u r a sweet tooth and haven't visit this place yet,you r missing out on something very precious..

Best sweet shop in the town. Its been decades since it has been opened but boy they just dont compromise with quality. They have an endless variety of sweets from chocolate sandesh to butter scotch, from normal jaggery sandesh to green apple sandesh they have it all. It is kinda overpriced but its worth yoyr money. You will never be disappointed.

I was in Kolkata for a day and landed up on this shop to try some Bengali Sweets.
I can bet you this is the best Bengali sweet shop in Kolkata. Tried almost all of their sweets but I loved their Mango manohar. I don't know how they did it but they solidify Mango and milk on their filling which is unique in its own way. Incredible!

When u want sweets.. The name is girish. Locatee in the north of kolkata, they are the best for sweets. May it be simple sandesh of bengali tradition to any type of sweet you like on special orders..  I cannot imagine an occation without their sweets. My favourites are black forest, chocolate monohara, shorer misti and strawberry sandesh.

No doubt about the fact that one of the best sweetmeat shop in the city...the shop doesn't look ostentatious and it seems that the clock got stopped here back in 1940 - 50 ...but the main matter of attraction is timeless... The sweets are really innovative and real treat for sweet tooths...let me share a must-try list... Utsab, Parijat, Mousumi, mango, Pineapple,Jolbhora ...      I'm sure that I'll add few more after my next visit.

Being a sweet lover, and most importantly being a Bengali, visiting this mecca of sweet confectionary was somewhat inevitable. Located in hatibagan (nearby hedua) the nearest metro station is "Girish Park".
The cluttered crowd sprawling in front of the shop, tells everything about its popularity. Though it has a shabby and old appearance and reminds you of the by gone eras of Kolkata. But its succulent and magnificent sweetmeat wonders which comes out from their kitchen has outbeat any and every sweet manufacturers and confectioners in the city. Their contagious popularity has spread all over the country and even overseas.
Keeping "girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandi's" sweets in the menu for every auspicious occasion is a must for most the eminent families of Bengal.
Even "Abhishek Bachhan & Aishwariya Rai's marriage" was also glorified with the excuisite sweetmeat from this place.
Everything offered here has its own majestic story, be it the various kinds of sandesh( babu, parijat, sourav, ratabi,3 star, monopuli, nutty sandesh, malai roll, mousumi, utsav) gur monohara, malai sandwich, choco rice balls, dilkhush, sharpuria, chocopuli, etc;
Ahh... It is becoming hard for me to control my cravings for their sweetmeat wonders while writing the reviews.
Being a Bengali is incomplete without indulging yourself into the mouth melting sandesh of "nakur". It is a proud heritage of city of joy.
Their glorious legacy cements the dense culinary expertise of Bengal elegantly in the entire human race.

If you really love sweets and have never visited Nakur, shame on you. Everytime I stand in front of their shop, look at their amazing display of sweets, I feel like a child split with choices. I want to just have it all but the fact that I cannot upsets me. Anyhow my favourite Nakur shandesh is CHOCOLATE CHANA WRAPPED AROUND CHOCOLATE SANDESH. Please visit Nakur.. one of the oldest and best sweet shops of our city.

Sufficient sweet and sufficiently flavored. No one can eat just one. It keeps me coming again and again. My words are less in comparison to its exceptional taste. Simply wow.

Nakur is one of the legendary sweet shops of Kolkata serving mishti to the sweet loving bengali not only in bengal but also outside and abroad. Nakur's variety of sandesh is huge; you just have to name one and it will be served to you. The owners have not only maintained the heritage of bengali mishtir dokan but has been progressive in trying out new varieties of sweets keeping in mind the demand of the new generation.  I remember my brother in law carrying mishti from Nakur to California so that he could feel the essence of Kolkata sweets for a few days in the foreign land. 
A must visit place for all bangalus who love mishti.

‚ÄúKuch Meetha Ho Jaye‚Äù very tidily sums up the attitude of Indians to ‚Äúmithai,‚Äù or sweets, on a daily basis. A literal translation would result in a grammatically incorrect sentence, but this often-used phrase means ‚Äúthe occasion calls for sweets.‚Äù The occasion being celebrated could be anything from a festival, a wedding or the birth of a child to smaller milestones in life such as exam success, a new home, a new car or even just guests for dinner! No happy gathering of any kind ‚Äì be it a party or a festival ‚Äì would be complete without sweets in India but specially in Kolkata, Nakur is the shop where I do go every time I visit Kolkata. These people are legends like Rabindranath Tagore and Subhash Chandra Bose who are associated with making kolkata proud around the world. Many people don't know that these people are associated with the grand celebration of big fat weddings of people such as Abhishek Bachchan and Sunil Mittal along with the Wadias..........they also became a part of celebration when Kolkata won the first IPL title of champions.......and many others are there on a big list.....but the point is.....they are awesome...all those chocolate sweets and that jolbhara sandesh along with a gur ka rashogolla are there on my list....though it is a small shop, but the taste standards are just like 5star confectioners..................good luck nokur........keep going like this... :)

If its authentic sandesh, none other than this place. They still use pure chhana, and that is what entices me to visit them everytime i get sweets for myself or someone else. A bit pricey, but that is definitely worth it. Special mention - jolbhoras (all of them), aam sandesh, butterscotch, monohora..

The first time I went here to eat when something regarding the sweets from this shop went to the Bacchan,s wedding n all came up.The sweets are awesome. It cannot get better than this. All the bengali chena sweets Were the softest I have ever had. For fusion lovers they have sweets in chocolate, black current, berries and may different flavours. It looks like a very old shop from ancient times. But I dare anyone to find a place better than this. Its heaven.

This is one of north Kolkata's most famous sweet shops and exudes an old world charm that is rarely found in Bengali sweet shops these days . The shop has trademark green railing outside and the interior is filled with large pictures of different gods and goddesses. The malai roll is one of their most famous products . The flavoured sandesh section looks as inviting as it is tasty ! I particularly liked the black currant sandesh, and the butterscotch sandesh had three layers made up of chocolate , strawberry, and vanilla . No wonder it is almost always crowded with patrons of all ages ranging from 15 to 50 & beyond ! Don't miss the lady with dishevelled hair waiting perpetually in front of the shop for some kind soul to buy her her favorite sweet . Love for food and love of humanity beautifully mingle here.

'Nakur' was in my radar for quite some time. And finally I could make it here! 

Notun gur is the jaggery for the winters and the traditional notun gurer sandesh is available all over Kolkata now, This sandesh is a delight for all with sweet cravings. 

I have had this sandesh in Delhi (Bikanerwala and Haldiram - both are excellent), Mumbai (Sweet Bengal - good) and all over Kolkata. 

Nakur is by far the best.

The sandesh is mildly sweet (bringing out the natural essence of notun gur) and quite soft. What pleasantly surprised me was its granularity (unlike most others) - which took the culinary pleasure to a different level.¬†

Highly recommended.

Location: Hatibagan.

Sorry foodies, wouldn't be able to comment on its exact location or ambiance, since I have always had its fare brought by my dad. I would surely visit it soon and update about these two. :)

The age old sweet makers or as my family calls it, the legendary sweet tooth producers, such so because we the children in the family started our sweet journey with the bite of a sweet from here. 
This place has been in this business for like ages now, and yes, also enjoy the patriotism we Kolkattans show by returning back to them every single time we crave for a sweet! This place surely bags a place in the gems of Kolkata Food Legends!

Talking about the fare, select any out of their fare on offer and you wouldn't be disappointed at all! Be it the Jolbhora Sandesh, Flavored Sandesh (Chocolate, Strawberry, Black Currant, Mango, Butterscotch, Rose and the list goes on), Nolen Gur Sandesh, Kaachagola or any other sweet, it would surely teleport you to a sugary yummilicious world.

Personal Favorites:
- Chocolate Sandesh
- Butterscotch Sandesh
- Jolbhora Sandesh
- Kaachagola

The prices are charged in a skimming manner, moderately friendly. 

Overall has always been a great experience. :)
- Keeping 1 point with myself to evaluate on its ambiance, service and staff, comments due.

Legends. Absolute legends they are, Girish and Nakur. Sondesh cannot get better than those you get here. Take your pick from the classics- jolbhora, kachagolla or the heavenly makha sondesh; or try the new age experiments of theirs- butterscotch, orange, strawberry or rose flavored. Hungry for more? Get ahead of the crowd and ask them for their Sachin sondesh, a signature they created on the day of his 100th century. And yes, if it's winter, don't forget to try their nolen gurer sondesh, quite a few varieties of that. Simply put, Nakur is THE best sweet shop in the city.

Be it their chocolate mishtis (yummy yum!) or the butterscotch or aamshotto mishti . .everything is simply beautiful. .the best being the mango mishti. If u ever feel that their prices are too much for sweets . .just dare and try one and you will never think about it again.
Soft but firm and d exact right amount of sweetness. .the magic combination is only possible for the magic hands of old craftsmen of North Kolkata I guess.

After Nakur I have simply disliked almost every sweet shop in South Kolkata. .if u have never gone to this place till now   . .do so. .its a must!

Heavenly sweets! Impeccable taste! If you have a sweet tooth, then this is the place for you! Estd. in 1844, these guys are at a legendary level when it comes to making authentic "Bengali Mishtis" or sweets. Every time I visit there and have their "Mishtis", its like I'm in 7th Heaven! From "Nolen Gur er Jolbhora" to "Abar Khabo" , Black Currant to Butterscotch Sandesh, "Choco Fillings" to "Chocolate Chip"...the list goes on and on and on! Everything tastes so so good! :D If you visit Kolkata, this place is a must for Sweet lovers! :)

P.S: It's recommended not to visit during auspicious days/Puja days if you don't wanna stand behind long queues! But yes, for having a bite of their sweet ecstasies, it's even worth standing in queues! :)

Probably the most celebrated mishti makers in town! I live down south in Tollygunge, and since it is physically not possible for me to go the shop each time, I have friends fitted in North Calcutta, who voluntarily treat me to Nakur Chandra's mishtis, every time we're to meet! They know that my love for these mishtis are so profound, that most of the times they treat me to it with me not having to shell out even an anna! Personally, the butterscotch sandesh is my favourite! I would love to try out everything on their menu, but unfortunately, haven't had that much of good luck yet!

Authentic and the best traditional Bengali sweets that u may have in kolkata . It's a haven for sweets and even the devils will turn pious on the taste of sandesh. The owners are boastful of their monopoly of taste and will even ask for a penalty or fine if you do not produce your receipt for a pre booked , pre paid order at delivery . Nonetheless I guess their Atitude is acceptable which gets washed with the sugar dipping in your mouth cavity from the womb of the  soft cottage cheese ; which has norom paak as it's sobriquet.

I am simply addicted to this place and keep on revisiting whenever i get a chance.
No other sweet shop appeals to me that way.

These place literally weaves MAGIC with its sweet. After trying out the numerous signature sweets I inculcated a strong dislike for other sweet shops. Whenever I visit their shop there are more than 10 customers standing in front of the counter. And the best part is that the prices are real value for money and also lower than what other popular sweet shop charges. Recomended: all sweets have a distinct flavour.

If you want to taste some old school authentic sweets while wandering in the norther part of kolkata, this is the place to be! Ranging from the famous nolen gurer sandesh and kachagolla to strawberry n choclate sweets, it is sure to impress you taste buds. It has a few seasonal specialities- mango sweets in summer, jhola gur planted in sandeshs at winter time and a lot more. Many of my friends n collegues who have tasted sweets from this place holds it in high regards. Can't claim its very pocket friendly, but I am happy to pay the price.

Sandesh and this shop are synonyms. They really are the best makers of this wonderful dish. And they have a wide range of Sandesh to offer. My favourite is Kal Bhara ( Jol Bhora ) made of Nalen Gur. Available during winters. I must have bought thousands of sandesh from this fantastic place.....

Like "A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† In the Spring time from the cucoo bird",
Nakur writes poetry with chhana and sugar. It is arguably the best sweet shop in the City. True, they are extremely arrogant shopkeepers, but Nakur is Nakur! They know what is Sandesh. It is slightly pricy, but I would pay that amount for that quality.

Nakur represents a lot of things; in Kolkata, in people's lives and in My life. To rate it less that 5 would have been a blasphemy for me!

Their delicacies are what dreams are made of. You don't qualify as a Mishti-lover until you have had their Chocolate and Mango Sandesh. The finest sweets are still churned up in this quaint little shop near Hedua.

A stone's throw distance from Scottish Church College on Vivekananda Road, the location is rather inconspicuous for the √ºber-cool crowd, not habituated with the streets of North Kolkata. But once you locate this gem of a sweet seller, you are hooked on to it for life. ¬†Popularly goes by the name of 'Nakur' it has been catering to sugar rushes since 1844 and boasts of an enviable clientele. Introduced to me almost a year back by a friend of mine who also happens to be the friend of the owner's son, I have had the privilege of sampling a few prototypes which aren't for public sale, but that is just classified information which I am not going to share here. Sorry. But what I will share is the amazing selection of sweets which you can purchase off the rack. Chocolate flavored sandesh is what the shop takes immense pride in and I can clearly see why. They taste sublime and they are amongst the fastest selling sweets in the shop. But its a shame I don't remember what they are called. In fact, I don't think I ever paused from gulping down the 'little drops of joy' to ask the name. So hypnotizing is the taste that you forget the diet chart you have to maintain and your resolution to lose weight. Having said that, personally it would be an honor to get fat on 'Nakur'. Hahaha.¬†

Statutory Warning: You may start preferring Nakur over Cadburys.

Like mentioned in my previous reviews, I am not someone with an active sweet tooth.

It is more of a dormant one.

This place, however makes me a Sweet Monster (if there's one)!

I don't know what to eat and what not.
Especially the chocolate and mango flavoured sweets. Someone please tell me are they actually "Mishti"? Or dessert prepared for the Gods?
They are SO amazing!Best thing is, it is just 10 minuted walk away from my home so whenever I have a "Nakur" craving, I walk down and treat myself to the awesomeness.
My father often gets home huge box of sweets of various varieties from Nakur and BOY do I get excited.
To say that Nakur is an iconic sweet shop in Calcutta is a typical understatement. :)

I have a sweet tooth. I must admit. You give me sweets in breakfast, lunch, dinner, I'll take it on any given day. Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy serving Kolkata's sweet tooth since 1844 is one of the oldest and best confectioners in India. I have tried lot of their sweets but I don't remember the names of all of them. The ones I remember are chandrapuli
, parijaat, black currant, butterscotch, strawberry sandesh, diary milk chocolate sandesh, chocolate rice ball. If you ask me to pick one which is the best. Sorry I cannot do that. For me all of them are best. Taste and quality wise they are the best even with a shop that still looks like 100 years old. Yes, they have not changed the look and feel of their shop. But who cares!! There's always some crowd in front of their shop. Weekdays or weekends, you will find people jostling for their favorite sweets.

This is definitely the first sweet shop you should go to whether you are new to Calcutta and want to try good Bengali sweets or you are a die-hard fan of Bengali sweets and want only the best for yourself. Not very far from the famed Vivekananda statue and the recently revamped Chacha's hotel, this shop may be a little difficult to locate and notice, even though it is on one of the busy roads of old Calcutta. However, when you suddenly spot a huge crowd of people blocking your way on the pavement, and notice bustling activity in the kitchen adjacent to a sweet shop, you know you have come to 'Nakur'. People are spoilt for choice here, as you know for sure that every single kind of sweetmeat, arranged neatly in stacks on rectangular trays, will give you bliss only certain things in life can hope to give. When you pop a piece into your mouth, and feel the aromatic, gentle taste melting into your mouth, you will know what kind of ecstasy I am talking about. :)

If you are one of those travelers who love to visit the best of food outlets,then you must not leave Calcutta without treating yourself at this famous Sweets Shop.
Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nansi manufactures one of the best sweets in Calcutta.Popularly known as 'Girish er mishti' it happens to be my most favorite of all the shops in the city.
The sweets which are mostly dry are really good in taste,though I still try out the Gulab Jamun and Rosogolla here at times.
Will not say anything more but only a few shops like this have survived the competition till date and continue to maintain their standard.
Dont forget to try the chocolate sandesh here(a little pinch in the pocket, but very classy in taste).

After spending three years in the city and countless promises to mum to send her the best damn sweets, I finally found my way down to this gem of a 'Mishti'r Dokan". The shop itself looks as old as described(somewhere in the mid 1800s!!!) and the spread isnt that gigantic.But the taste that follows after you've put that first piece of sondesh in your mouth plus all the anticipation and hype minus the walking,is heavenly.I tasted one with fruits and nuts in the centre and the chocolate one,packed about 2 dozen of various varieties.Each one of them was so perfect that i couldve sweared i shed a tear in happiness.Outstanding.period.
PS- The 0.5 deduction is for the difficulty in finding this place.So worth it! ^_^

i was never into sweets much, but the one that turned my sweet tooth sharp & made me fall in love with bengali sweets is the legendary Nakur sweets. true that they offer a wide range and variety of sweets - be it some authentic bengal sweets or the experimental fusion ones & they make it appear in best tastes possible which made me savor every bit of their heavenly items. i have had heard much about this renowned sweet shop from my grandma & uncle, but i got fortunate enough to  taste their sweets mostly when it happened to be situated just by my college. with reasonable price and consistent maintenance of standard, they still occupy a position unparallel. apart from cadbery sandeshes like black forest, rice ball, choco chips,sandwiches  which are popular among youngsters like us, there are timeless ones like parijaat, golap sandesh, dilkhush, malai roll - which can win over hearts of all age & generations. golapkhash sandesh definitely deserves special mention - the aroma it delivered was intact and the nawabi flavor that persisted was heavenly - i packed one big box full of their sweets taking one from every item to send them oversea to my aunt in canada with loads of love & laughter. their sweets can still bring delight & have held up the pride of bengal for their mastery over the art of making sweets.

First of all I would say, people won't find better sandesh anywhere in whole kolkata. They make epic sandesh and varieties of sweets. The sweets which I find unique are jol bhora sandesh , guli sandesh those small ones and gur er sandesh. This unique taste you won't find at any other sweet shop. Bengali's are crazy for these sweets available in the shop.

The other word synonymous to Nakur (for me) is chocolate sandesh. I was pampered by one of my grand-uncles with these yummy innovative delight since my childhood, and it still continues.

Other than that, nolen gurer knachagolla and jolbhora are the timeless comforts to your tastebuds that you can ever imagine.

This place is LEGEN wait for it DARY....no adjectives can ever be enough to describe this place. It has been around since donkey's years and everyone who has been here and eaten shondesh from here will have fond memories. My grandparents loved this place (possibly their parents did too), my parents love this place and now so do I. Talshash, golap patar shondhesh, shorer sandwich (with pista bits on top), rose, jolbhora, babu shondhesh etc. all have the potential to teleport you to another dimension. And so do the seasonsal ones like lebu shondesh and kacha golla. I am a huge fan of all their traditional recipes and somehow don't like all their innovations. The black currant for instance was awesome as far as I am concerned unlike some of the various chocolate ones that they have come up with over time. If I am dying and I am given an option to choose from Girish, Nalin and Bhim Nag, I'd probably die choosing.

If you ever go to North Kolkata in search of nice food and nice desserts or rather for Bengali sweets then Nakur is just the place you should surely visit. Situated near Girish Park Police Station or you may say Hedua Swimming club this place is the heaven for all those who can spend a lot over sweets to taste the best. I being a regular to this place really recommend this to every person who likes sweet. Starting from Black Forest, Monohara, TriStar or ThreeStar, Jolbhora, Toofan Chocolate(named after 'Toofan' da,a member of Nakur family) etc etc. If you try any of their sweets I am sure you will again come back for more. Without any doubt this one of the oldest and the best sweet shop that is maintaining their standard even after so many years. This is really highly recommended to all sweet lovers.

How could I forgot to write a review about the best mishti shop in kolkata!! It's just hardly 10min walking distance from my place. Nakur, as everyone calls it, is on a busy commercial lane in the skein of¬†densely trafficked streets that make up the old Shyambazar district.¬†The shop itself is little more than a grated hole in the wall but the locals who line up at the window and the connoisseurs who have braved the traffic across town, know that this is where you can find some of the finest sandesh in Kolkata, delicate and creamy with a subtle grain that melts gradually and unevenly in your mouth.
In a weekend, around 8pm,u may have to wait in a queue to get your turn. That much fame they have. I love all the sweets & my favorites are jolbhora, blackcurrant sandesh, butter Scotch sandesh, malai roll. 
Go & taste the sweets who didn't try it yet. U will each & every item they prepare & finally ends up with extra calories.

We were on a tour of North Kolkata yesterday and upon enquiring a ‚Äògood‚Äô shop for ‚ÄòMishti‚Äô (assortment of Bengali desserts), were referred to this shop. Easy to find, Girish-Nakur is in Hedua, close to the Girish Park Police Station. It‚Äôs a Eureka moment when you reach it, for it is exactly how you would have imagined it ‚Äì old, cluttered, unassuming, bustling with patrons, hurrying and swift salesmen doling out the goodies to the Sandesh-lovers.

We struck a conversation with the young, Pradip Nandy ‚Äì the 6th generation Nandy currently running the place. And was happy to find out that he has taken his famous outlet to the digital space. Girish-Nakur has its own website, a Facebook page and a Twitter handle. Going the right direction, we declared!! He also told us, matter-of-factly, that since they sell only Sandesh, they come up with new variants every few months. Hence, a few exotic names such as Black Currant Sandesh, Black Forest Sandesh!! Truly new-age, we said in admiration. Having said that, you will not miss the original, always-in-demand Nolen Gurer Sandesh, Jol Bhora Sandesh, Taal sash sandesh‚Ä¶.those are their specialty anyway.

Place specialises in Sondesh and do not make anything with Ras ( Ras is sugar syrup ) .... thereby it is restricted to Sondesh and items like Rosgolla, Kheer Kadam are not available. 
Sondesh is fresh, fresh & fresh and extremely tasty ... it is more flavour driven then plain sugar and so you can eat happily and  you will LOVE it :-) :-) ... tried almost all the items but my liking was the small dumpling sondesh & the roll filled with dry fruits :-) :-) ... for the quality and freshness the price is a throw away and am sure you will like it 
a word of warning ..... the place is in north kolkatta and is in a by lane . the roads are small and extremely dirty .. traffic is snarl and if you dont come early you will struggle .... there is no seating place and you will have to stand and eat .. there are beggars galore and be prepared ... not a gourmet dining experience but a typical road side Indian eating experience !!! The place was started in 1857 and there is reason they are still successfull :-) ... Sondesh to Die For :-) :-)

INSANE!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!!!!!!! the  best mishti in kolkata. To me they are THE BEST authentic bengali sweet makers. its a small shop in hatibagan, the service is not so great, but i don't care, i luv nakur's mishti!!! reason i like them so much is because i have seen many sweet shops who have tried to punch modern flavours with authentic bengali sweets. here i must mention that i am not a mishti fan but NAKUR has  successfully made me one....the MUST TRY LIST IS long!!!! but the most important one is the BLACK FOREST SANDESH.......!!!!! jug jug jio NAKUR!!!!

If you are talking about "SANDESH"... then please..please... don't give a second thought to any other shop in this entire universe. If you are a foodie and not having allergic to sweets and if you are in Kolkata, then it will be a sin, if you do not visit the shop and try the best "SANDESH" of this universe.
in school days, I used to save my precious pocket money to have those "SANDESH" and I am still following this trend. 
I cant name any specific "SANDESH" as the best because each of them is equally excellent. Yes, there are number of flavors like mango, chocolates, black currant, butter scotch and many more that may vary according to your likeness of the flavor. 
The best of part of this shop is that, it keeps experiment with its "SANDESH".  it is like "R&D" process which keeps producing new varieties of SANDESH which is very unique (sometimes seasonal) and cannot be found in any  sweetmeat shops in Kolkata.

Writing review for the God is not easy. Couldn't find a more suitable name for Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.
You won't find anything to admire when you visit this shop. It's like any other sweet shop in your locality. But wait! Go a little further and take a look at the awards and recognitions in the shop. That will tell you that you have come to meet or rather experience heaven on earth. A lot of people complain that the price is a bit high here and this is a shop for the rich and aristocrats. Well, it's partly true that compared to other sweet shops in your locality, this place is expensive. But that doesn't matter, if you want to taste the best. And frankly, it is not out of your reach.

I just can't mention any one Sandesh here, I love them all. You will see them making fresh sweets right in front of your eyes, they will bring the trays to the counter, and within 15-30 minutes they will vanish. You will never ever find old sweets here. The stocks hardly lasts for a few hours and deserves a phrase like "Sold-As-Fast-As-Nakur's-Sandesh."
You have to wait, but not for long. Other people will always be there, but the service is also good and they trust their customers. I buy Sandesh from this shop quite frequently and it's like meeting the almighty every time.

Girish Nakur is GOD. There! I said it. No, actually, they make the best sandesh I have tasted till date. I love the huge variety of plain and very innovative ones they have - they experiment with flavors and come up with blackcurrant sandesh, ferrero rocher sandesh, chocolate talsash, but I tend to love their traditional jolbhora talsash and the ever-faithful light as air golap sondesh. The crowd is there, but pointing at freshly made sweets and taking them home, or eating them right there is a part of my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and is one of the best things I have eaten till date.

I had a trip planned to Calcutta & as such was searching for the must-visit-foodie-places in there & seeing GCC & NCC at the top of the charts, i had kept a time slotted in my trip just to know why. 

As i was going solo & this part of the city was not known to me, i had to take the help of GPS & locals to get to this place. For newbies like me its located on the Ramdulal Sarkar Street which lies almost opposite to the Hedua Park near Hatibagan & you can easily find it on the left side of the road if you are coming from the Hedua Park side. There were quite a few sweet shops lined before G&N which had all kinds of sweets lined up & i somehow resisted them & finally reached my destination.

To be honest i was quite surprised on reaching the place as i had cooked up something totally out of the world in my mind but contrary to that it was just like any other Sweet shop you will find in any random place. Sweets decked up in the front counter, grumpy salesmen, sweets being prepared in the backyard, cheap rates, a steady flow of foodies, . I was just wondering at that moment what was it, that had made this place so highly-rated. 

I had read a few reviews in Zomato about this place & its specialities & without wasting anymore time i ordered them.& the rest as they always say is History.
 
1. Special Chocolate Sandesh - chocolate-favored freshly made buttery-soft sandesh with a surprise of Chocolate Sauce dripping from the centre. The moment you put that in your mouth, its Nirvana. Absolutely recommended.
2.Kora Pak - one of best i have had...i earlier had tasted it in K.C.Das & i felt this to be better.
3.Butter Scotch Sandesh - i never thought butter-scotch would taste so much better in the form of sandesh.

I also had their Black-Currant, Strawberry & a couple of other flavors which  were equally luscious.

The service is nothing to write about. But who cares. I have earmarked this as a must-visit place whenever i come again to this lovely city.

P.S. - There is a huge portrait of our Didi with King Khan & his KKR team members above the front counter of the shop, cutting a Cake Sandesh ( i suppose ) made from this place. Kind of shows its pedigree. LEGENDARY.

Personally I don't have a so-called sweet tooth, still Nakur is the only sweetmeat shop in Calcutta for which I can vouch. If you are born in Calcutta in a traditional Bengali family, then you ought to have sweets from Nakur at least once in your lifetime. You won't believe, this shop is carrying heritage since last 170 years! Once my colleagues from various parts of India came over here for attending a training. They tried typical canned rasgullas from Haldirams, mishti doi from Gangurams - but somehow they were not getting satisfied with their taste. They kept on insisting me for letting them taste some authentic Bengali sweets from a traditional sweetmeat shop. Undoubtedly, I opted for Nakur. The simple taste of Choco-filled Gutis, Choco-wrapped Rolls, Mango-flavored Sandesh, Malai-wrapped Rolls, Strawberry Sandesh left them mesmerized. Look and feel-wise this shop may not be attractive, but their sweets are making our city proud for the ages! My rating for Nakur would be a whopping 4 out of 5.

I do not know of any person in Kolkata who does not love this place. Its more than a century old and as one of its employees once explained to me ,  it was opened as a reply to pudding and pastry culture of the East Indian Company. Oh Boy, What a reply !!!

There is no place that makes sweets like this place does. The testament to this point is the fact that you would always find a good crowd standing outside the steel grils and buying their stuff be it 8 a.m. in the morning or 10.30. in the evening.  I wouldn't be overshooting when I say every one of their several sweets they make is a speciality of their shop. There are times when you would find only one or two variety of sweets available, such is their sale quantum. I would suggest you to better confirm/ intimate before going to the place if your taste buds are craving for some specific sweet.

Kacha golas, jolbhoras, kora pak are their items that have been ruling the taste buds for like forever. Now, they have experimented and introduced number of innovative sweets in the flavour of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, butterscotch, black current and all are crazzzzy!!!! Kacha gola, chocolate malai roll, black forest are my preferences though i know how tough it is to choose what you want. They have sugar free options for the diabetics or calorie conscious people.

This place is one that i have been going since i dont know when and can never get enough of it, and my taste buds are tempted already !!!

Class and Tradition personified, the Bard of Bengali Sweets!
Actually, consistency defines the quality of anything! Even a Rs. 2 GUJIYA depicts the quality which Nakur consistently delivers so one can easily make out what the Trademarks would turn out to be like.
No words or reviews can in true sense describe the class of Nakur.

When it comes to the typical and traditional Bengali Mishti (not Sweets/Desert), Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy is the best. Their dry Mishti is one of the best in the world (yes, you read it right!!).  They continued to create magic since more than 100 years sitting in the northern part of the city Kolkata.  Here are some technical points for the shoppers.

Parking: 
No dedicated parking space for the shop though. But, since it is situated on Ramdulal Sarkar Street, a relatively smaller road than the adjacent Cornwallis street, almost 10 cars can be parked at a time.

Ambiance and sitting arrangement: 
It is not a restaurant and hence no arrangement for sitting. It is a typical old Bengali Mishti shop, where shoppers buy sweets by standing on the footpath. Footpath adjacent to the shop is roofed by the veranda of their house, so, you don't get drenched in the rain. 
Yes, you can try peeking through the door or window of the shop and you may get a sight of making Mishti inside.

Taste and value for money:
All of the sweets are favourite of mine. They are simply as made in heaven. So, if you visit Kolkata, take a taxi from airport. Even, 400 rupee taxi fare is worth for these delicacies.

This place has achieved legendary status, and rightly so. 
Its a small sweet shop, located near Bethune College, tucked away in a side alley. The sweets here are awesome (and trust me, we bengalis are something of a sweetmeat expert).Not only do they have regular and traditional offerings, they also have a variety of new creations. The sheer variety of different chocolate sandesh available makes one's mouth water. Everytime I visit, I make it a point to try 1 each of at least 5-6 varieties. The quality and taste are very satisfying to the taste buds. Price wise they have justified offerings.Be it traditional 'mishti' or modern 'flavour' experiments, this place never goes wrong.
So next time you are in north calcutta , don't forget to sample the sweets this 'ancient' shop has to offer.

Growing up in North Kolkata, you've got to be a sweets person. From the Bhim Nags and Sen Mahasays, Girish Nakur is a step forward. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best place for sweets in all of Kolkata. From the classical korapak to their experimentation with chocolate and other flavours like black currant et al, they just never go wrong. 
All hail Girish Nakur !!

I'm a sweets guy. I'm the guy who has, compulsorily, sweets every night after dinner. I'm 22 and yet sugar rush isn't yet a memory to me. Ergo, CLEARLY,  Nakur er mishti is a very special place for me. From the traditional korapak to the newer chocolate sandesh-es, I love just about everything here! This is very well woven into kolkata's heritage, and I think just about everyone in town loves the sweets here almost as much (I can't say more than) I do.
Ohhhh Nakur. Glory Glory Nakur Nandy.

If you need a definite taste of sandesh or particularly JOLBHORA, then you must visit the shop. Theres nothing much to add about the shop...their traditional sweets are still one of the best in the city and nowadays they are experimenting with new tastes such as green apple, black currant etc. Also they have introduced large varities of chocolate sweets which are all a must try.
So to tickle your taste buds...definitely visit with your friends or family!!

if you want to taste what a heavenly sandesh is come to Nakur. if you dont like to wait, send someone else to get them for you.
the best way to have mishti here is by coming with a team - at least a partner.
Choose at least five sweets depending on availability and your taste. order one each and share. that way you can have a lot of variety without stuffing yourself too much.
the chocolate sandesh , the jolbhara and the monohora are really the leaders. you may also try the orange, black currant and mango flavoured sandesh.
my all time favourite has been the chandrapuli - it just melts in your mouth.

Personally ,  Nakur has always lost to the oldest sweetmeat shop in the city but its Jolbhora (a special sweet made with cottage cheese which has been kneaded to a melt in the mouth consistency, with a filling of syrup during the summers and palm jaggery during the winters) is one of a kind. It is soft and has a melt in the mouth texture. I personally cannot give high ratings to a sweetmeat shop which is ultramodern. It has all sorts of non-traditional flavours with a layer of the flavour's compote on top and I personally love traditional sweets and thereby I cannot but give it a poor rating. Some might love the new flavours which give a new twists to sweets. I must admit that their chocolate flavoured sweets are quite delicious and if eaten as just a dessert is quite a nice way to end a meal. I was a bit annoyed with the high handed attitude of the servers. I have personally been a regular at the oldest sweetmeat shop where the servers are always ready to serve with a smile but the servers of Nakur seemed a bit careless about losing customers while not attending to them. They serve not on a first come first serve basis but on a basis of regularity of the customer's visit to the shop which is very annoying. With so many other sweetmeat shops falling in the category of cultural heritage of Calcutta) my rating is naturally not very favourable for the shop.

Girish has been a favourite with my family for at least three generations, as the quality of their sweets is very good. Their traditional Talshaash Sandesh is something that I have eaten with great relish for many years. The large size of their sweets was also a matter of joy.

These days, most major sweet shops in Calcutta are trying to come up with new varieties of sweets. Girish has not been immune to this trend, and if one goes to the shop today, most of the sweets on display are new creations.

Of the innovations, their range of chocolate-based sweets is very good. Girish was not the first shop to try and put chocolate in their sweets, but I think that the quality of chocolate used by them, along with the way in which the chocolate is melded with the cottage cheese/thickened milk that forms the base of most sweets, is what makes their chocolate sweets so good.

There has also been a flip side to this innovativeness. Owing to the changing nature of Girish's clientele, the shop now stuffs most of its sweets with nuts, which detract from the taste of the sweet itself. Sizes have also started shrinking. Some ghastly combinations have also ensued - I tried a sweet with kiwi pieces in it and found it quite terrible. Flavours like strawberry and pineapple should also not be used profusely as they don't go very well with the sweet base. One hopes that a balance will be struck to ensure that the taste and quality of the sweets remain the same, even the new varieties.

rosogollas, pantuas form a daily choice by all but I think this shop prepares with some magical effects and the taste is really unique.
The Jolbhora is out of the world,it will melt in your mouth. Chocolate sandesh is simply exceptional.... Pithe is excellent here...
It is my most favourite sweet shop.
Also, during occasions I order som sweets from here and they have never falide to satisfy and bring a smile in everyone's face,,,,
prices are reasobnable and i would rate 4.5 for GIRISH CHANDRA DEY AND NAKUR CHANDRA NANY....they should get the award for best sweets.....

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy  is the pride of Calcutta when it is about sandesh.It is one of the oldest and most popular 'Mishti dokaan' (sweet shop) as said in Bengali.
If you are a Kolkatan or have visited Calcutta ever and are a real foodie with the sweet tooth this place is a must go.It is snuggling in one of the lanes of Shyam Bazar with a dusty signboard -nothing attractive at all you may think , but don't go for the looks!  Some of my favourites are the
chocolate sandesh through which ' the liquid chocolate just seeps out of it as you delve into the soft sandesh . The Noren Gurer Sandesh is the real delight which has the real gur (jaggery) in it.
The Knanchagolla is so soft that it melts into the warmth of your mouth while Kora Paker Sandesh is another one to go for. The diabetic section is not at all the one to go for if you have diabetes , even I love the sweets of the diabetic section as well.It is value for money
All in all this place is an essential place for a foodie you have to visit this place and if you love heritage then Come Here !!!!!

Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy is a brand synonymous with Sandesh in Kolkata. Many of my personal favourite sweets are from this shop in North Calcutta. In fact, I know many people who will buy their sweets only from here - pocket pinch not withstanding! Such is the demand and the quality of their offerings.
Some of my picks would be the Jol-Bhora-Tal-Shnash - an exquisite dish where the sweet is filled with a delicious liquid filling that leaks out only when you have gotten half-through, the Chocolate and Strawberry flavoured Sandesh and Rosogolla, the evergreen Nolen Gur-er Sondesh and the Knachagolla.
The Knachagolla is so soft that it will readily melt in your mouth, considering you haven't already disintegrated it when using your spoon or fingers without care. The Nolen Gur-er Sondesh, a speciality of the winter months, is something to swear by. In these days, the authentic Nolen Gur - made from silver date palm extracts - is hard to find. Almost all cheap shops will sell you scented and coloured jaggery. However, Girish and Nakur, though a tad expensive, will never compromise on the quality. You can always depend on them for the most authentic and most exciting flavours of the season. They also have a section for diabetic patients - which is sure to light up many faces!

Verdict: This place is legendary. Must go!

This is by far the best place to have Sandesh in Calcutta. Starting with the traditional kachagolla to the experimental chocolate sandesh, everything here is just heavenly. Personal favourites are Kachagolla, Jol bhora naram pak, Moushumi and chocolate sandesh. Best part is they know their strength is sandesh and they concentrate only on that. No rosogolla, no doi, just super delicious sandesh.

The only negative is their behavior. Worst I have found in Calcutta. A minus one for that.

This is one of the oldest sweet shops of Kolkata established in the 1850's and practically a part of the city's heritage. The establishment is supposed to be the birthplace of sandesh. The Nolen Gur items are super especially the Korapak Sandesh which I love. The Kanchgolla and Rossagolla are both excellent options to sample. Keep up with the times some off beat flavours like chocolate, strawberry and pineapple sandesh have been introduced as well. This is a must visit place for all true foodies with a sweet tooth but beware it is a little hard to find if one is not familiar with the area!

Having grown up in Delhi, "Nakur-er Shondesh" had been the stuff of all 'probashi' folklore, and with these sweet treats being hailed as the stuff of legends, my first visit to this place surely made me carry a bag full of question marks and exclamation marks, right down to the little counter on this shop inconspicuously tucked into a tiny lane in North Calcutta (a nightmare for novices!). But did I drop my bag full of marks, and how! This stuff was good! The first bite and I was hooked. I went back to my childhood days of frequenting the 'padra' sweetshop and having one of each one of the sweets on display, only this time with each passing try it got better, even when you thought it couldn't! 

I believe this review renders itself quite redundant in the face of the legends surrounding this place, the huge picture of KKR celebrating with their 'Shondesh Cake', the dozens of other endorsments and trophies adorning the aged walls of this tiny little haunt. 

It is a must visit for every "Shondesh" lover, and unlike my other reviews, I won't give you suggestions, just go at it like an adventure, and I can assure you that you won't be let down! :)

being a kolkata lover, and a person who loves heritage, i simply adore this place. 

Nakur, as it is popularly known by its regulars, is an important part of the MISTI History of kolkata, they have been on the scene for generations and i hav been a regular here. but what i like about this place the most, they ppl have adapted new techniques into the humble sandesh and made it quite a treat. 

they hav some chocolate sandesh varieties here which could give high end cake shops a run for their money. 

a person favorite here is the sugar free chocolate sandesh and the butterscotch sandesh .. one must also try the strawberry malai roll..

be sure to make your choice fast as people are waiting... a very popular place... and brilliant sweets.

Tucked away in an old, nondescript lane near Shyambazar Metro, don't judge this place by how it looks. Literally a hole in the wall, with purana grills, this is a far cry from the innumerable sweet shops popping up around South Kolkata.

But do you want to know how this place differs from those? Take a bite of their korapaker sandesh. You'll be transported to heaven is my gurantee. Popularly known as 'Nakur, this place occupies a pride of place for the Kolkata palate. If there's a big wedding or a huge celebration, this is the place to get your sweets from. For over 50-60 years, these guys have been dishing out veritable delicacies in sweets, with their quality never wavering. 

Even if you don't live in North Kolkata, make it a point to once come here and sample their stuff. You'll be blown away, and come back again and more. Just make sure to come before everything gets sold out!
