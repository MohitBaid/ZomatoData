Went on a Jan Saturday with family. It is situated right inside the Camac street Pantaloons complex. The decor is like Subway. The counter guys are very courteous and kind. They even arranged a combo with the Rava dosa just to help the customer’s interest. We had buttermilk and filter coffee. But at the end the taste of the dosa was not at all up to the mark. I can’t term it South Indian authentic delicacy. It is more of an office cafeteria like place.

This is a very feasible place for everyday lunch for the office goers around, as one gets the regular masala dosa and idlis, however any of their cheese dosa or uttapams arent as good as they look in the pictures, the cheese is simply sprinkled on top without heating properly, so that was a huge turn off. Otherwise their filter coffee is really good, also the combo offers are light on the pocket.

This place is a MESS. There were flies all around the place. Food had a very disgusting flavour. The tables wereleft uncleaned. There were no waiters to serve. However the cashier was freindly. The prices touch the sky. The card reader was also not working. My family's day was spoilt. This was the first and last time I visited the place. I would suggest to walk more 30 meters and go to pizza hut. Please avoid a visit here.

A very fresh place in the heart of camac street. This south Indian place is very new in its concept and with a lovely environment. We had masala uttapam, dosa masala, filter coffee and buttermilk. 
3 variety of chutneys were given along with samber which tasted amazing. The quantity was also good. 
Do visit.

Presentation of food needs to be improved. I was shocked to see mini idli being served in a flat plate. A South Indian would expect those mini buttons to swim in a pool of sambar.
We got complimentary papads too!! And just as they promised unlimited chutney, sambar and papads.
Wonderful combo offers.

Been quite some time since i had dosas this disappointing. Ordered ghee roast dosas. Could hardly taste any ghee. The sambhar was watery and tasteless. All 3 chutneys were below average and lacking any characteristic. Impossible to find even one aspect good about the good ordered.
The filter coffee was okay.

Location is good , ambience nice and service quick that about it as far as positives are concerned. 
Food was average, haldiram serves better dosas than this so called authentic south Indian place. Chutney quantity was less and  tastes yuck. 
This south Indian place also serves north India chola batura, even the roadside baturas are more soft and tasty than this. 
All in all a nice place to waste your money.

There’s a saying that don’t fix it if it ain’t Broken, and Vaango’s formula still works, good South Indian is something that is so deceptively simple that you can throw things out of proportion very easily but Vaango manages to keep everything in the right proportions.

A destination of exotic south indian food. The ambience was very nice. The staff were very cordial. The food were tasty and pocket frndly also.
We ordered two masala dosas which was part of Tuesday special offer of buy one get one free. We also ordered filter coffee and butter milk.
Masala dosa : they maintained the authentic taste 
of typical masala dosa which comes in a big size,both crispy and crunchy and stuffed with traditional alu masala sabji. It comes with one sambar, one regular white chutney  and one green chutney made of coriander,lemon and pudina. 
Filter coffee : it has got normal taste of coffee. 
Butter milk : it has got a tangy taste of salty and sour.

Located on the backside of Westside(Camac Street), it's a really bright, delightful joint, specially for South-Indian cuisine lovers.
Their combos are really good & economical.The staff is extremely courteous & well-mannered. 
Food is nice, although Banana Leaf(similar kind of place) is much better in terms of taste but then, Vaango is more economical.
We took a "meal for 2" [ combo 1] which was absolutely filling & delicious, specially the Pav Bhaji.We were allowed to replace the filter coffees with cold-drinks.
Resonable price, cleanliness, well-behaved staff & decent food pretty much sums up Vaango.Good for a casual, not too expensive, outing  !! :D

This outlet is also amongst the best south Indian food restaurants in Kolkata. A vibrant,clean restaurant ambiance,an order counter and assisted service. 
Food is basic south Indian with Varieties of Dosas,Uttapam. They also have combos which I asked them to include my Mysore masala dosa in the same combo and they happily did so. Smart young people serving also adds up to the 50 seater restaurant's ambience. Poppadums were served on house while food was getting ready. This courtsey is what makes guests happy. A little extra in the food industry. Next came the buttermilk, followed by food.  Dosa was quite large with potato stuffing and raw tomato and chili which added on the taste. Drumstick and Bottlegourd Sambar was served piping hot,which I loved, and asked for a refill. To finish off they served extra poppadums as well. Ensuring food is good or a feedback is important, the server did so, and overall it was a very good lunch experience. Try out.

Place with good staff and decent food.

The floor was slippery when we reached the hotel. 

The combos here are good and not heavy on pocket. We ordered the below items

Masala dosa - good taste upto the mark
Mini Idli or coin idli  - avoid it tasted like it was not fresh
Butter sada dosa - perfect 
Butter milk, some green lemonade - a must try 
Filter coffee - ok not that great
Pav bhaji in combo - avoid this combo as the portion was very small and not that great in taste.

They serve unlimited chutney and sambar.

Overall a good place for South Indian food. 

PS : The staff too polite and cooperative.

This is a South Indian Restaurant. They serve complementary papads and also three types of chutneys. But on the day we went, one of them was stale and tasted weird. We ordered a cheese dosa but it wasn't cheesy enough! Their speciality dosa was gunpowder dosa which again was average. The sambhar was good but the quantity of the chutney was too little. Although the service was nice but the food was really disappointing.

One of the best South Indian joints in Kolkata.. At the back of Pantaloons , Camac Street and easy to locate.. The place has a very good ambiance and the staff are really courteous..Above all the food is very tasty ..I had an onion masala dosa which was really crunchy..The place is surely worth a visit... I would love to try out their Rava Dosa and Idlis on my next visit!!

The spicy mini idlis are a must have thing in Vaango. I always ask ashiqe for better combo advice he will give you the best advice regarding choosing your combos.....

Ambience - 4/5
Food - 4.7/5
Service - 3.5/5 

Location - The 'Vaango' is a South Indian restaurant at Camac Street, just beside the Pizza Hut outlet at Camac Street. 

Atmosphere/Decor : As you enter the place, you will instantly love the place, because of the way it is decorated spaciously, utilising each and every corner to fit maximum number of people. And, you are definitely going to love the colourful walls where the South Indian culture is depicted in each figure drawn in the walls. 

Cuisines : Vaango offers large number of South Indian dishes. Here you can get so many types of dhosas - probably you have never heard before too about these huge varieties of dhosas. It offers you nothing except South Indian  dishes. 

 The Dishes: The menu here offers a wide variety of exclusive South Indian dishes. If one wants to get a real taste of South Indian foods, one should definitely drop in this place. The wide variety of dhosas taste so different, other than the dhosas we are generally offered in Kolkata; this is just because you get the taste of South India here. Other fab dhosas, you get all other types of South Indian dishes. And there is also add-ons like tea, coffee and other soft drinks. The hot coffee was served uniquely in a steel glass, placed on a steel small bowl, is extremely refreshing. Though, it has the smell of coffee, but it doesn't taste like the usual coffee we have at any other cafes; it has an altogether different but mind-refreshing taste. And all the foods along with the beverages like tea and coffee are several fresh, healthy and hot; all of the dishes here are medium spicy. 

Price : Here, the menu offers large number of dhosas and other South Indian dishes; but these are quite cheap and pocket-friendly. The variety of dhosas here start at the rate of Rs.90 per plate. And they offer you large variety of combos too, which makes you get exclusive South Indian healthy and fresh food, without spending too much for them.

Service: The service also accompanies good and fresh quality of food. The people assigned for the service of the customers are very much responsive and they do not at all take too much time to serve the food.

Found this south indian place and had to come with my south indian freak friend. 
A very spacious place with great calm ambience. 
They have lots of Combo Meal options to chose from, which I found to be better than single orders. 
Their ButterMilk is amazinggggg. 😍😍😍❤️
Other than that we had Idli, vada and uttapam. Which were equally very goood. 
And service was also very cordial and sweet. 
The pricing is also very unexpectedly reasonable. 
Overall a great place for healthy breakfast. A must visit for all south indian lovers. And dont forget to try their buttermilk for sure.

It does not even pinch your pocket and oh yes the unlimited complimentary papads are something to look forward to! Their filter coffee is a must try. They claim they make the best filter coffee and they are absolutely right. Also, the onion paper rawa dosa is a unique one. People who love south Indian food must visit this place. The staff is also very cooperative and will help you to choose your combo as per your interest!

I'm from California and I've never been to a restaurant in Kolkata before that had such good service. The waiters were amazing. They were so nice and polite. I ordered a masoori dosa and it was too spicy for me and we told them and they changed it for me and gave me a masala dosa instead. Plus the food was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone I know. Great food and great service👌🏽❤️

Visited the place on 25 June.we ordered a Mini dosa combo which came with filter coffee,pav bhaji,chole bhature .
Service was fast and efficient and staff was really courteous.ambience was minimal as is expected in a qsr outlet
Filter coffee was very good .we had to order them again
Bhature were fluffy and large but the chole were a little too spicy
Pav bhaji was average .bhaji looked more like a potato only bhaji.other vegetables were absent
Dosa batter was probably not well fermented so the dosa lacked the sourness typically present
Sambar was OK.may be the sambar spices were not strong or freshly ground ,that could have made it better
Coconut chutney was decent

All in all a good place if one is in a hurry

Vaango is located at 22, Camac Street on the backside of Pantaloons building. It is very easy to locate it. They have also opened a new outlet recently at Kasba. I had been invited here by Devashis Kuthari who currently operates the Good Vegetarian Food of Calcutta Group on Facebook. As it was more of a celebration on completing 69,000 members, i was invited herein to try the authentic South Indian delicacies. I am not a very big fan of South Indian food but i somehow find it quite light as compared to other cuisines. Sambar, Idli, Vada and Dosa are the usual which can be easily available in street kiosks to the usual South Indian Restaurants. However, here at Vaango, i had quite a unique experience. There were around 15-25 members who had come to dine in and i did not know much people out here. It was a little awkward first but then, we got comfortable over discussing about what we love – Food. I took my seat after staring at the ambiance. They have got wall arts and basic things done. It is just fine. Nothing very fancy though.

Vaango is one of the best south indian restaurant I've ever visited.It is located at 22,camac street,Block A,Kolkata,Near Westside Mall,Pantaloons,Camac Street Area,Kolkata.This restaurant has anather outlet at Acropolis Mall,3rd Floor,Food Court,Acropolis Mall,1858/1,Rajdanga Main Road,Kasba,Kolkata.

South Indian cuisine is all about delicious and traditional dishes to taste,a typical meal consist of many spicy and non-spicy dishes.The staple ingredients are dal and rice mixed within a consistency and hence made so many delicious dishes.Freash coffee and butter milk remain a staple drinks in every South Indian restaurants.

Vaango served many types of dhosas,idli,vada,dahi vada,kanda bhajia,uttapam which is served with sambar and chutney.

Few days back I and my fellow foodie friends are invited over a food tasting session at this restaurants from beverages to food,it was a great experience for me.

Being a lover of South Indian cuisine i tried those mouth watering dishes I considered myself very lucky.They served the best Dahi Vada in town as well as the Dosa and Uttapam.The ambiance was really good,sitting arrangements were really comfortable.The service was so good.All stuffs were so gentle and very efficient at their work.When I entered in the restaurant received a warm welcome there.

The foods and beverages are as follows:-

Buttermilk-Buttermilk was the beverage left behind after churning butter out of cream known as traditional butter milk which is decorated with chopped coriander leaves.This buttermilk tastes simply good.
Filter Coffee-This is a very famous preparation also known as "Kaapi".This beverage is made of mixed frothed and boiled milk together with the decoration obtained by brewing very well ground coffee powder in a traditional Indian filter.
Lime Mojito-The drink was very cool and little bit minty flavour,prepared with lemon juice and ice cubes.It was very refreshing drink.
Sweet Lassi-Vary famous drink to have in the summer.Very smooth in consistency and thick as a drink,very much sweet but it's was good in taste.
Starters:-We had many delicious starters

Spicy Mini Idlis-Soft and spongy rice dal spicy small fluffy idlis which was great in taste.Served hot with sambar and chutney.
Kanda Bhajia-Deep fried chopped onions and chilies alongwith batter.Served with two types of sauce.It was superb in taste,crunchy outside,chewy inside.
Idli-This is very traditional South Indian dish and also very popular as breakfast made by steaming a batter consisting of fermentation black lentils and rice.
Medu Vada-Very famous Indian fritter made from Vigna mungo.Usually made in doughnut shapewith crispy outside and soften inside.Served hot with sambar and chutney.
Tadka Idli-This preparation is same like Idli but a little different from it.
Goli Vada-Another varient of South Indian starter which was also very good in taste.
Main Courses:-

Dosa-This is the type of typical pancake made from a fermented batter.Somewhere similar to a crape but it's main ingredients are rice and blackgram.Served hot alongwith sambar,stuffing with potatoes and vegetables.It's very puffy and thin like a paper.
Masala Dosa-Very popular dish.Served with sambar and chutney.Inside filling is excellent in taste made with spicy potatoes.The size was big and taste awsome.
The other varieties of dosas are-Mysore plain dosa,Signature Masala Dosa,Rawa Masala Dosa
Uttapam-Very famous dish,specially one of my favorite dish.We tried three types of uttapam made by cooking ingredients in a batter which is crisp and crape like cooked right into the batter.Served with samabr and chutney.
Masala Uttapam-Prepared with sprinkled onions,tomatoes and green chilies.Brownish in color and very tasty.
Onion Uttapam-Perfectly cooked with lots of chopped onions as the name suggest alongwith chilies.Very good in taste.
Signature Uttapam-One of their speciality.It was cooked perfectly,well decorated,good in taste and served with sambar and chutney.
Chole Bhature-One of my favorite dish for alltime.Combination of chana masala and fried bread which is called "bhatura" made from flour.It is very big in size and puffy.Served hot with spicy aloo and chana sabji.
Poori Bhaji-This is an unleavened deep fried bread,soft and puffy.Served with aloo sabji and pickle.
Dahi Vada-This is the another favorite dish of mine.Probably I've tasted the best dahi vada in town.One of the specialty of Vaango.The key ingredients of this dish is dahi,tamarind,urad dal alongwith many spices with decoration of red chili powder.This tastes really amazing.
Dessert:-

Rawa Kesari-A mouth watering dessert made with rawa(semolina) slightly heated with ghee,cashewnuts and raisins,cardamon with a pinch of kesari powder.
overall I was really enjoyed my journey to south india with these delicious dishes.The quality and quantity are extremely good as well as the hospitality.A must visit place to enjoy good dishes.

In Kolkata we can find very few good south Indian restaurant and Vaango is one of them. It is located in Camac Street, near West Side Mall. They have another branch in Acropolis Mall, Kasba.

To be honest when I visited the place I have no idea what is the meaning of Vaango. I just google it and found Vaango means ‘Come in’, it is a Tamilian word and they use this word to ‘Welcome’ guests. 

The place is big enough for accommodating 40-45 people at a time. Ambiance was great, south Indian music was playing background. The staffs were very polite and friendly. I and my fellow foodie friends were visited the place for a bloggers meet. They warmly welcomed us, we tried some authentic south Indian drinks like butter milk, filter coffee and dishes like Dosa, Idli, Batura, Dahi bada etc.. The experience was superb. This is the first time I had some really good South Indian Foods in Kolkata thanks to Vaango. 

Beverage: We tried three different types of authentic drinks,

Butter Milk-It is the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cream. The tartness of buttermilk is due to acid in the milk. It is very healthy and delicious. They served it with chopped coriander leaves. 

Filter coffee-  It is a coffee drink made by mixing frothed and boiled milk with the decoction obtained by brewing finely ground coffee powder in a traditional Indian filter. The drink known as Kaapi, is the South Indian phonetic rendering of "coffee". The aroma was great, and it will give you a instant boost-up. Must try.

Sweet Lassi- It is a widely known drinks, doesn’t need any introduction. Lassi they served was fresh cool and delicious. The taste was simply good.

Starters: After these lovely drinks we had some starter,

Spicy mini idlis- Soft fluffy small sized idli with spicy coating. Served with chutney and sambar. 

Kenda Bhaja- Chopped onions coated with batter and fried deeply. Served with two types of deeps. It will go very well with coffee. 

Idli- Very famous and traditional south Indian dish made with rice and fermented black lentils. It is a steam food so it is oil free and very healthy. They served it with chutney and sambar.
 

Medu vada – Another famous south Indian dish made from black lentil or urad dal. Outside was very crispy and by inside it was soft and juicy. Served with dal, sambar and a spicy chutney. Too good.

After these chatpata starters we had the main course, where we tried
,

Dosa- It is most famous south Indian dish made from fermented batter. We tried Masala Dosa and Masala Cheese Dosa. Both were excellent. Filled with spicy potato chaat, onion. Cheese dosa was superb. They served it with sambar and chutney. The size was huge. One is enough to satisfy your hunger. 

Uttapam : Another famously known south indian dish. It is like a pancake made with rice, black lentil and topped with onion and different vegetables. Served with sambar and chutney. It have different variants like Masala Uttapam, Onion Uttapam etc. It was very soft and tasty especially Onion uttapam was superb. 

Chole Batura- This is a combination of chana masala & big size poori called as batura made from flour. Served with alu-chana sabjI, onions and pickles. 

Poori Bhaji- It is very famous in all over India. Poori served with sabji, onion and pickle. It was delicious and feels like home made. Liked it.

After trying these delicious preparation we tried a very famous desserts,

Dahi Vada- It was superbly delicious. One of the best dahi vada you will get in Kolkata. I can visit again this place only to try this preparation. Must Try.

If you love to eat South Indian food the Vaango is the place you need to visit. If you don’t like South Indian preparation very much, after visiting Vaango I’m sure you will like it. Overall experience was extremely good. Food, ambiance, behaviour, and staffs everything was perfect and the place is very much pocket friendly. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and followers. Make a visit and experience some DOSA VOSA , IDLI VIDLY.

কলকাতায় বসে প্রামাণিক দক্ষিণ ভারতীয় খাবার খেতে চান ?? সে ক্ষেত্রে এখানে আসতেই হবে । ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে আমি দক্ষিণ ভারতীয় খাবারের বিশেষ ভক্ত নই । কারন কলকাতায় ভাল মানের দক্ষিনি খানা মেলে না । কিন্তু এখানে খেয়ে সে মত প্রত্যাহার করতে বাধ্য হলাম । 
রাজদীপ ভট্টাচার্যের আমন্ত্রণে বিশেষ স্বাদ পরীক্ষণের অনুষ্ঠানে পাঁচফোড়নের সদস্য হিসেবে অংশগ্রহণ করি । সে অভিজ্ঞতাই তুলে ধরছি । 

পানীয় 

বাটার মিল্ক ঃ মাখন থেকে ক্রিম নিষ্কাশন করে সেটা দিয়ে তৈরি করা হয়। ওপরে ধনে পাতা কুচি ছড়ান । গরমের দিনের  আপ্যায়নি সুধা বলতে দ্বিধা নেই । 

লস্যি ঃ গরমকালের সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্য পূর্ণ আরেক ট্র্যাডিশনাল পানীয় । হাল্কা , পাতলা । দক্ষিণ ভারতের সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্য রেখেই মিষ্টির পরিমান কম । 

ফিল্টার কফি ঃ অতিখ্যাত জিনিস । দুরবনগন্ধবহ । যেন সুদুর পশ্চিমঘাট পর্বতের সবুজ ঢাল খানাই কাপের গোঁড়ায় উঠে এসেছে । না খেলে মিস !! 

লাইম মোহিতো ঃ আরেকটি সুন্দর পানীয় । লেমন জুস , আইস কিউব এর মধ্যে মিন্ট ফ্লেভার । শরীর চাঙ্গা করার অব্যর্থ ঔষধ । 
স্টারটার

স্পাইসি মিনি ইদলি ঃ স্পঞ্জের মত নরম , হাল্কা ফোলা । দুই ধরনের চাটনির সঙ্গে পরিবেশিত । 

কান্দা ভাজা ঃ পিঁয়াজ , লঙ্কা কেতে মাখন দিয়ে ভাজা । খেতে খেতে মেরিনা বিচের স্মৃতি মনে পরে যাচ্ছিল । দুই ধরনের চাটনি সহকারে পরিবেশিত । 

ইদলি ঃ এ ঠিক কি , সবাই জানেন । নতুন করে গাইড করার কিছু নেই । 

মেদু ভডা ঃ কালো গ্রাম দিয়ে তৈরি ডোনাট আকারের ভাজাবিশেষ । ওপরে মুচ মুচে । অন্দরে নরম । স্টারটার হিসেবে সুন্দর । সাম্বার , নারকেল চাটনি আর মশালা চাটনি দিয়ে পরিবেশিত । 

গলি ভডা ঃ আগের মতই । সামান্য কিছু পার্থক্য আছে । যদিও খেতে প্রায় একই । 

এর পরে ধোসার পালা । এত রকমের ধোসা ইতিপূর্বে খাবার সৌভাগ্য হয় নি । এবং আকারে প্রায় পরমানু বোমার মতন । 

১) মশালা ধোসা 

২) মাইসোর প্লেন ধোসা 

৩) সিগনেচার মশালা ধোসা 

৪) রাওয়া মশালা ধোসা 

পুনশ্চ উত্তাপামের পালা । খুবই বিখ্যাত ঐতিহ্যবাহী পদ । আমরা মোট তিন ধরনের উত্তাপাম খেয়েছিলাম । সাম্বার ও চাটনি দিয়ে পুরো জমে গেছিল । 

মশালা উত্তাপম ঃ পেঁয়াজ , টমেটো , সবুজ লঙ্কা দিয়ে নির্মিত । বর্ণে বাদামি । ক্রিস্পি । 

অনিওন উত্তাপম ঃ প্রচুর পরিমানে পেঁয়াজ আর লঙ্কা পাবেন । খেতে বেশ ভাল । 

সিগনেচার উত্তাপম ঃ এই দোকানের বিশেষ রান্না । ওপরে নানান মশালা ছড়িয়ে পরিবেশিত । খেতেও অসাধারন । 

এত কিছু খাবার পর পেট ভরে গেছিল । কিন্তু পিছন পিছন ছলে ভাতুরে আর পুরি ভাজি দেখে মন ক্রিচ্ছসাধনা থেকে ইস্তফা চাইল । পরম প্রজ্ঞায় তাকে মাফ করে দিলুম । 

ছলে ভাতুরে ঃ ময়দা দিয়ে লুচির মত ভাতুরা করা হয় । তার সঙ্গে চানা মশালার কমবো । সঙ্গে মশালাদার আলুর তরকারি এবং আচার । 

পুরি ভাজি ঃ নরম লুচির সঙ্গে হাল্কা মশালাদার আলুর তরকারি । গরম এবং নরম । 

দই বড়া ; আমার খাওয়া সেরা দই বড়া । এত সুন্দর পরিবেশন , মখমলে স্বাদ আগে কোনোদিন পাইনি । চেয়ে খাওয়ার মত ডিশ 

আরেকটি বিশেষ কথা । এই দিনটায় আমি ধরাধামে অবতীর্ণ হয়েছিলাম । সে উপলক্ষে টীম পাঁচফোড়ন বিশেষ একটি কেক কেটে টা উদযাপনের ব্যবস্থা করেছিল । সঙ্গে রেস্তরাঁর বাকিরাও হাত মেলাল , মুখে মাখামাখি হল । সেই অসাধারন স্মৃতির জন্য , একটা সুন্দর দিন উপহার দেওয়ার জন্য সকলকে অসংখ্য ধন্যবাদ ।

It's been a long time where Kolkata people is blessed with a proper south Indian food joint.
Vaango- a place where you'll find the best out of it.

As per location, nothing can beat the place, In ground floor of Camac Street Pantaloons, you never have to think about parking while hanging out with friends or family. Each and every staff is polite and well groomed which gives you a homely feeling.

The restaurant is well decorated with awesome wall graphics of south Indian tradition, with a banana leaf colour theme.

The food range starting with Mini Masala Idli, Puri Bhaji, Onion Bhaji, Cheese dosa, Mysore masala dosa, Medu vada, special thali, & my favourite the halwa.

You will find one of the best Dahi vada & Filter coffee in this place.

Lastly it's over all a awesome place where you'll find food & peace together.

Visited this south indian restuarant for breakfast the dosa was average not that great.
The service was quick. They give many combo offers to choose from.

this place in Camac Street is a value for money delight. it is friendly to the pocket and serves good enough food for that price range. The spicy mini idlis, the vadas, dosas n coffee are few things we keep ordering during our lunch. Only i guess the sweet kesari can improve a lot. I ordered once only not to order again from here.

Horrible service. We had ordered for the Southern Delight Combo Meal (which contains 2 Masala Dosas, 2 Idlis and either 2 Dahi Wadas or 2 Medu Wadas along with 2 beverages) , Mysore Sada Dosa and a Rawa Onion Sada Dosa.

Firstly, the time it took to make the food was long especially considering the place was not even half full and South Indian food is generally quick in service. Then from there onwards, the slope was all downhill. We had asked for the Masala Dosas with the masala seperate. They gave it with the masala smeared on the Dosa. When asked why they did this, the staff said that "It tastes better this way" and tried to convince us to try it as is. We had to scrape the masala from the Dosa ourselves and then continue to eat. 

Then there was the horrible Idlis and Wadas. Both looked like they were made a day ago and were atrocious and absolutely dry!

Finally, came the Rawa Onion Sada Dosa and Mysore Sada Dosa. When the Rawa Onion Dosa arrived, it was without the onions. On enquiring about this, they sent some sauted onions in a bowl and tried to pass it off as the error was rectified and again tried to convince us to eat it this way only. When we said that it was not the correct way, then only did they give the correct dosa. 

Lastly when we were leaving, the manager told us that the series of errors occurred as the chef was South Indian and there was a language gap between the chef and the people taking the order. This means that this problem can happen at anything and with anybody.

This place is not worth it at all in terms of food, service or price! You are better off going to some other South Indian place anywhere in the city!

Located next to Pizza hut in Pantaloons. 
We went there after a full day of shopping,expecting a cheap lunch but discovered that the prices of the dishes are a little expensive. 
We ate the Spicy mini idlis @59 with tax in which there were 7 pieces of idlis. It was served with coconut and tomato chutney. It was decent.

They call them a South indian joint..
Went there for brand name..
But got disappointed with the food quality and text..

After trying the outlet at Acropolis mall, visited this outlet at 22 Camac street. Its spacious and well maintained. Went in and found BOGO offer on dosa which was a cost saving for me. The service is fast here. Was initially served a cold dosa, but was changed when complained. 

Tried their Mysore masala dosa which was not even spicy as Mysore dosa should be, it was just a normal masala dosa. Their signature masala dosa had some orange powder which is very famous in South India, that made the dosa great. The chutney and sambar was average. 

Tried their only dessert rawa kesri which was basically suji ka halwa with a hint of pinapple flavour, it dint tasted rich, left more then half the servings. 
Well this brand has to innovate or do the basics well to strive in the long run.

Food is good but service is really very poor. Self service is there but u are not even to expect  to serve u drinking water on your table.After having dinner u need to ask for tissue papers for two to three times .There is no washroom as they have merged with pizza hut for that and when i went there the staff was rude enough to say that it was not a pay and use toilet. Almost 30 percent of the restaurant was vacant and we were having dinner,when i went to order my second dish for dinner the staff replied that we need to wait to place the order as they could not complete the existing ones. 
Really disappointed with this kind of service

Can't say I'm disappointed, nor can I say that I am impressed. It's hard to judge Vaango because there isn't much to judge them on.

The restaurant looks like everything you'd imagine an air conditioned South Indian joint would look like. They're much cleaner than most other restaurants of this ilk, and so credit where it's due.

The service is formal, and friendly - no complaints here. The simplistic decor makes Vaango a pretty decent lunch option. It's comfortable, without putting in too much effort.

The dosas here are actually very average. They look nice, and you won't mind eating here every few day, but that isn't because of the food. The masala in the dosa isn't a lot, and it isn't nearly as tasty as I'd hoped. Their portions are decent however, and if you're used to south Indian food as your staple, you shouldn't have any problems. But once again, they're food isn't going to get them places. If there's anything that makes Vaango a viable lunch option, it's the peace inside the restaurant. Smooth music and light food often makes for a nice early lunch.

Southern Delight Combo @ Vaango, Camac Street, Kolkata ☺

Having kick-started their operations in 2011, Vaango, the South Indian Food brand has finally arrived in Kolkata in 2016. 

Vaango in Tamil means 'Please Come'. However, Vaango's PAN India presence is mostly centred around Delhi-NCR region and other cities of North India. In Kolkata, their presence can be seen in the food court of Acropolis Mall and beside Westside at Camac Street.

If one enters the Pantaloons - Westside Shopping complex from Woodstreet, then the ground floor based Vaango can be instantly spotted from the entrance gate itself. 

The food brand's 3D mascot clad in white lungi, gamcha, fluorescent green shirt, golden jewelry, South Indian style tikas, with a bulbous nose and thick dense moustache, spread in a welcoming smile, is placed outside the restaurant's entrance. It has already become a popular photo clicking spot, like the joker mascot at all McDonald's outlets.

Vaango is a rectangle shaped restaurant, consisting of a 54 seater seating area, self service counter, semi covered wash basin area with a mirror, and a semi visible kitchen area. Orange wallpaper with 3 life size posters of South Indian delicacies are present on one wall. Though half of the other wall is covered in an almost similar orange wallpaper, the remaining wall's wallpaper is printed in abstract forms of South Indian culture. Three rows of seatings are present, two rows are lined along the aforesaid walls, and the third row is placed in their middle. Both walls are lined with fluorescent green colored sofas, upholstered in leather style cover. The chairs facing them and also the ones present in the middle row are made of fibre wood and metallic pipes. The chairs' sitting planks are fluorescent green, while the backside planks are wooden brown. Table tops are white in color with metallic pipe legs. Flooring is tiled and blackish grey in color. Ceiling is artificial, black chequered and filled with assorted spotlights and circular embedded speakers. There is a cold drink dispenser behind the self service counter. Instrumental music plays in the background.  

The food menu is well displayed on illuminated display boards behind the counter. A stack of menu hand outs are also present for take away. The menu categories are - Starter & Value Meal, Idli & Vada, Rice, Dosa, Rawa Dosa, Utthapam, Beverage, and Dessert. Six money saver Combos are also listed towards the end, along with the supporting pictures.

We opted for the most generous combo i.e. the Southern Delight Combo. It consisted of -

2 Masala Dosa: Two huge dosas with more than enough potato fillings were served with a bowl full of enough sambar, and rather small servings of coconut and tomato chutney. The dosas were thin and uniform in consistancy, but a little burnt from one side. The potato mixture was relatively spicy, than the ones we are used to, in the other equivalent outlets of the city. Sambar and coconut chutney were OK. The tomato chutney was a tad bit too spicy and rich in garlic.

2 pcs Idli: They were big, nice and fluffy idlis.

2 pcs Dahi Vada: Two South Indian vadas, immersed in thick and a little sweet curd, topped with chilli powder and cumin powder, arrived in two separate bowls. The dahi vadas were really tasty and quite filling.

Choice of 2 Buttermilk/Filter Coffee/Pepsi: We opted for two filter coffees, which arrived in two small steel glasses, placed in two steel bowls. The coffees were foamy, looked promising, but tasted average.

Vaango's serving utensil are made of white melamine. The present staff's duty only entails - taking of clients' orders and payments, and cleaning of tables. Upon ordering, each client is assigned a token number. Whenever that number is called, the concerned client is required to collect his/her order from the service counter.

Though the Vaango outlet at 22 Camac Street has been a welcoming sight for hungry and tired shoppers, who are constantly on the lookout for affordable, filling and relatively healthy food, the restaurant needs a little polishing in it's cooking department. Also, it needs to tune in the taste and quantity of it's wares, as per the existing comfort zone of the city diners.

Price Of Southern Delight Combo: Rs. 349/-

Amount Saved: Rs. 217/-

Price Paid After Taxation: Rs. 421/-

Most Hopeless South Indian Restaurant to come to Kolkata. We are all familiar with the South Indian food being served at  JyotiVihar, Banana Leaf etc.
When you compare with them, Vaango is hopeless.Even The roadside Dasawaal makes better items then this. Dosa was hopeless,chutney was watery. We left our Food in between.Same was also done by many of the persons who had come there.Pl never go to this place.One was the lowest or i would not give it even one star.

The food is good but the service is absolutely pathetic. On a Sunday evening at 7:30 most of their dishes were sold out. They were taking more than 15 minutes to take the order. The service was absolutely chaotic and the waiters and waitresses had no clue how to behave in front of customers.

The newly opened Vaango is located adjacent to Pizza Hut on Camac Street. It is difficult to miss this place because of the green and white figure in South Indian attire is standing in a greeting pose.

I visited yesterday. I tried the:
Spicy mini idlis
Tiffin combo meal

Prices are at par with quantity served. Self service is the system in practice. The spicy mini idlis were good.
The Tiffin combo was good too.
The problem here is with the condiments served which are an integral part of South Indian food. Excepting the red chutney the rest are nothing great. The Masala of the dosa was towards the spicy side.

The order taking is prompt and food gets ready quite fast. But the condiments need real looking into.

An absolute wrong choice! 
Located just next to Vardaan Market, a place where you can find loads of street food and their varied options. 
I'll suggest, go for that. This place is too mainstream, has nothing special to offer and at greater prices. No point going back there.

Was very excited to see this outlet open next to Pizza Hut on 22 Camac Street. But sadly it was a very disappointing experience. 
Order a Masala Onion Dosa and a Plain Dosa. The dosas were not upto the mark. They were thick and sweet and also became rubber like. I asked them to make my plain Dosa a little crispy and they made it like papad. I have very high expectations from South Indian restaurants considering the legendary Jyoti Vihar and Bhupendra Mansion in Kolkata but sadly didn't find this place upto the mark. The only thing I liked was their red chutney.

Visited the joint yesterday . Elated to know that a new South-Indian joint has opened in Kolkata. But was very disappointed to see the mismanagement and chaotic atmosphere.  For quite sometime no one will come to you for orders and then the ordered food reaches you when you are just getting ready to leave. Food is just not upto the mark. Hope , they will revive for better in future. Not recommended now.

Newly opened, so thought of visiting the place, but people dont waste your money here since the food is not edible at all and tasteless.
Staff is average and are very loud.

Moreover you are having self service that too in a South Indian hotel. For refilling the chutney and sambhar u will have go go to the counter and take since the quantity is less, although it is tasteless so u may not go refilling.!!!!!

My very first visit to Vaango. I was extremely excited to step into a South Indian restaurant right in Camac Street itself. I ordered for Filter Coffee, Idli Chaat & Medhu Vadas.
The filter coffee took forever to arrive! It did not taste like the typical, traditional strong filter coffee that Tamilians & I are used to having. Perhaps it was a tad bit stronger version of the regular weak instant coffees that you get from vending machines.
Medhu Vadas were average. The ones you get in Banana Leaf are far better cooked and definitely worth the money. Here at Vaango, I did not find worth for my Rs. 99 that I paid for two pieces of this vada.
Idli Chaat was definitely confused with dahi papdi Chaat and I have never seen such a sad mix up of Idli like this anywhere else, yet! 
Very peppy decor, seating and tables are color coordinated. However, the staff are clearly not coordinated along themselves, the kitchen staff are loud, noisy and the whole frenzied ambience really is a turn off.

Sad story here. Newly opened but
ill prepared. Imagine going to a south indian restaurant with hardly ten people around and the manager says that the chutney has finished and it will take 20 minutes before a masala dosa is served! Huge disappointment. And to add about the food - the chutney was mostly water and the amount was what a child would eat.  The masala dosa had a mini cupful of filling. Please avoid this place. Try the Acropolis Vaango instead.

Not a good experience from a newly opened restaurant.
1)Dosas were average.Samabar was very good.But Chutneys were not good at all especially their orange chutney.That was so tasteless.
2)Dahi Bada was good(still not worthy of price)
3)Uttampam gave me a feeling of Hard Roti(plz dont order it)
4)Buttermilk was good but nothing special as such.
This eatery badly needs improvement.Take That !!
