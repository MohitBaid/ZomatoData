Spacious. Colourful. And I like it in the afternoons. 

There is a sweet selfie corner which is in an auto. 

We had asparagus risotto and Alfredo pasta. Butter chicken is average.

Gave it a try as it is just beside my home. Being a vegetarian there were sufficient choices in the menu. Had soup, dal tadka, naan and paneer butter masala. The food was not bad but the service was very slow.. Had nearly slept waiting..

Famous for sheesha. Went there to try sheesha only.
The interior is decorated amusingly.
But sadly reviewing sheesha was not as expected and the price was unreasonable.
Tried better sheeshas at a comparitively cheaper rate at various other restaurants. :(

The Rooftop Dhaba - Exceptionally good food and sheesha.
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located right above crossroad cafe. As the name suggests, it is not a proper rooftop cafe but it does give you a good feel and is located on top of the building.¬†

Nonetheless, the place is quite nicely designed and the seatings are quite vibrant. I have been here many a times with my friends and the food and sheesha of this place have not yet disappointed me. The food served here is always lipsmacking hot and the sheesha is always nice.¬†
=====
What i had:

‚Ä¢ White sauce pasta - The white sauce pasta is served piping hot and is good to taste.¬†

‚Ä¢ Cheese Maggi - Add anything cheesy and the tastes improves fold times. The cheese maggi was quite a delight.¬†

‚Ä¢ Crispy Chilli Potato - The crispy chilli potato were quite in quantity. The potato wedges sauted in the chilly sauce and topped with sesame seeds were lip smacking nomnom. ¬†

‚Ä¢ Teen paan Sheesha - I always take the teen paan sheesha here. They make it with love and care.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 300-600 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.)¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced.
‚Ä¢ Piping hot food served everytime.
‚Ä¢ Ambiance is nice.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Service is a bit slow.
=====
Conclusion:¬†
I had a great time here and hope to come back soon again.

The rooftop dhaba.
Went there with high expectations came back with highly bad experience.
The only thing I liked about the restaurant was the Auto themed dining, booked it but sadly couldn't fit as it wasn't really comfortable.
Staffs are very casual and undisciplined.
We ordered hookahs, Cheese kebab,  tikka masala , reshmi masala, Kali daal, jeera rice and mixed vegetable, tandoori roti and coke.
The quantity is very very less, 
The worst part was , we ordered 2 tikka and 2 reshmi masala and they served us with 4 tikka masala.  When we complained the Waiters denied saying we ordered only tikka. When we ordered, we asked them to write it down and they ignored saying they can remember.
Food was not at all hot, tasted very normal.

After the meal they handed us with hand written bill which was around 4k and that was not at all worth it.
We asked them about it on which they said their computer isn't working.
Overall it was a real bad experience there.

Great Ambiance, Delicious Food. It was ¬†a great experience and cozy place. I had a great time :)
The kababs are mouth watering, especially fish tikka, it just melts in the mouth. Its a thumbs up place. Very Innovative and beautiful. The rooftop dhaba really created a rooftop atmosphere according to the weather of Kolkata :)

A newly opened restro on Prince anwar shah road this one stands upto its name..on the 4th floor gives a great view of the entire surroundings..but under staffed they take a lot of time to serve any order..so better order at once to avoid waiting time..we ordered rooftop dhaba special biriyani..roasted murgh..that stole the show..then lime soda mojito,chocolate shake and virgin mojito..all of them did not justify their prices..the interiors are good and off track signifying a roadside dhaba with an auto a cut out maruti standing out but they need to go a long way in keeping up with the demands..employ more staff fast and u guys will rock it

Ambience is v good..on a sosthi night there was no crowd, possibly because the joint is new....i will give a 4/5 to the decor...we sat on that auto haha :)
now coming to the food, the fire and ice mocktail was nothing more than fresh lime soda wth a lil jaljeera..chicken salt pepper n cheese kebabs were good(though i dint like the kebabs becaue the smell of ghee was v overpowering n i dont like it!).
Coming to the main course, we orderd butter naan, punjabi chicken, and butter chicken
well butter chickens taste was good, but the punjabi chicken tasted like err..fish! yeah, u read that right!
told them abt this...also the chicken were nt boneless...which should be mentioned in the menu, n we told them abt this :)
hopefully, wll have a better experience next tym

Celebrate the culture of Punjab with scrumptious curry food that The Rooftop Dhaba has to offer. Food has never been tastier before, and it has certainly never been this cheap.

This recently opened place has the most friendly and amiable staff team. The manager would come up to you and have a word with you, ask you about your day and more importantly, about your thoughts on their food. This customer-to-staff relation I believe makes a difference, and that is exactly how The Rooftop Dhaba made a special and a permanent place in my heart.

A class apart, sitting on the highest floor of the same building as Crossroad Caf√©, The Rooftop Dhaba brings an urban desi vibe with it. The setting of this place is very much Bollywoodish. The main attraction and what I would like to call their trademark pull factor is the sleek looking, bright auto sitting in the centre. It has a seat of four and is kept in the middle of the Dhaba all polished. Each table has their own bright lights, which I must say is excellent at bringing out our features in photos. Ask me, I would know. And as soon as you start to think that this place can not get better than this, allow me to be the one to tell you this, The Rooftop Dhaba is soon to open candle light dinners too. Now you can bring your significant other here, food would be light on the pocket, you would not need to pay for tax, plus candle light dinner. Best dinner date plan ever, right?

Me and my friend ordered Dhaba food and Chinese food respectively. I had had a one butter naan and Chicken Tikka Masala. The bread was excellent and so was the meat. In fact, the quantity was so much we could not finish it. There were big pieces of chicken with a good amount of gravy, which satisfied every part of my hungry tummy.

Next came the Chinese cuisine. My friend had ordered a plate of Chilli Fish and Chicken Hakka Noodles. Speaking in terms of quantity, we were very happy customers. The fish was so soft, it fell apart in our mouths. And the noodle was equally good. We had to pack our food back home because it was literally that much.

The Rooftop's strong suit is not just their food. Their mocktails are very nice too. Chilled, light and clear drinks perfectly quenching your thirst during summer. You would not want to miss out on the drinks, trust me.
