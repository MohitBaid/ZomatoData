Since my childhood this has been always my favourite place for bhel puri and batatas. Located on Lansdowne lane this is a tiny little shop between two eateries. You will always find rush in this shop and yet you will be served the tastiest of the plates.

A must try for street food lover.

This counter is at sarat bose road near picadially square. People love him and keep coming back regularly.

Yes, it's famous but I find it over hyped. Pan, bhel, bhatata is pretty normal as to my likings. It's decent but not as great as per the hype created around him.
