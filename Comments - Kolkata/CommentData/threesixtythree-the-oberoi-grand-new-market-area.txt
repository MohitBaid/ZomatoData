The ambience is gorgeous as it is expected. The hospitality of the staff in the hall makes all the difference. They will make you at home and treat you like their guest. Among the innumerable variety of items the ones worth remembering are Thai soup,  Kenowa, Beef Tenderloin, Salmon Ceviche, Roasted Turkey, Asian Seafood, Thai chicken, Maki Sushi, Assam Tea flavoured Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Orange Liqueur Chocolate and  Threesixtythree Belini. The last one is a sparkling mocktail that comes with a Californian grape. Quality of the food is very good. Only shortcoming is that the spread in the main course is too short. One expects a few more red meat items.

We went there on a Saturday and opted for lunch buffet. The overall quality of food was good. For starters, there is a huge counter of both veg and non-veg salads with different dip sauces. Then there was sushi counter with different types of veg and non-veg sushi. It looked fancy but personally I didn‚Äôt like the taste of sushi. For main course, there was two counters for veg and non-veg. We tasted the paneer recipe, chicken kebab, baked fish, gravy chicken, mutton biriyani and all of the dishes were really really good. For the dessert, there was many options to choose from; they had different type of sweets, custard, brownie and lot more. And, they serve ice cream on the table as per request.
Apart from the food, after getting so many positive reviews for the service I was a bit disappointed. The service was quite slow; we had ordered for mushroom soups which they serve on the table, they took the order but it never came; for the ice cream also, we had to sit for extra 15mins to arrive it in our table.
So, overall with the service and food, I am going to give it a 4-star.

A gorgeous restaurant in a beautiful hotel. I tried the lunch buffet which was minimalistic and aptly done.
The one year old restaurant can easily be termed the classiest one in city. Like the hotel ,the restaurant too ooze opulence and royalty yet being modern. A lot of research must have been done by the Oberoi team.
 In no way the buffet can be said most extravagant in the city but the spread was exotic and full of varieties. The mushroom soup was strong and flavourful. Then the starters were mostly salads done perfectly be it veg or non veg.
The sushi platter was the highlight of the lunch for me
6 types of yummy fresh sushis were served in both veg & non veg option
Main course was tasty with decent variety . Odd but the chicken biriyani didn't have any chicken in it.
The desert section was another beauty with 12-13 types of cakes, mousse , fresh fruits, tarts, Bengali sweets.
The lunch couldn't be any better overlooking the serene pool at this magestic property. Will visit again soon

A perfect restaurant to experience what fine dining is. Very friendly staff and the food quality over here is exceptional and service is fast. We did not have to wait even for 5 mins between appetizers and main course. Very good desserts and if a change is required in any of the dishes, they do it, no questions asked.  Yes, if you want to stomach to be full while leaving, your pockets might be empty by that time too.

Being an Eggiterian Marwari feels so cruel when u enter a multi cuisine restaurant and have veg food. Same goes with this place. I went there with my cousins for a dinner and God!! this place is worth visiting. Although it being primly a japanese cuisine resto.. we ordered veg. spaghetti and risotto to go with Glenfiddich and to add some japanese flavour we ordered a veg sushi named Firecracker sushi that was tasty as it was my first ever sushi experience. The service was good and the waiters were very helpful with the menu and suggesting food. overall a gr8 experience at a 5star hotel and a Grand salute to the management of this place.

Classy place with tasteful interiors. The staff are also equally friendly and helpful. Tried their signature dish crackling Sushi with avocado and cream cheese. The presentation  was awesome and was served on a smoke filled glass bowl. The sushi was real tasty and the portion size was quite good. 

Then we had penne pasta in mixed sauce which had mild flavor and had Asparagus risotto. The best thing about this place is it has options of a smaller portion for many dishes thus avoiding unnecessary waste. 

Apart from the food quality and taste which is top notch, this place has the most customer friendly staff. Really had a good time and a great gastronomic experience.

A classic fine dine restaurant style cafe which has some of the finest dishes from cuisines around the world. The service is impeccable.

What we ordered:

Firecracker Sushi : phenomenally done sushi. A veg sushi that is worthy to be one of the most signature dishes of the restaurant. A must try for sure.

Wild Mushroom Agnelotti : soft pasta parcels with brilliantly flavored and cooked mushrooms and a truffle oil cream with mushrooms. What a banger of a dish. Some bread to mop up the sauce and dang

Mushroom,shallots and Sun dried Tomato Pizza : do we need more than that.

The coffee shop at the oberoi grand , ended up for dinner and loved the service fast and prompt , that you hardly get to see in hotels these day (trained staff).

We ordered the crunchy sushi which was good and a must try, mushroom pizza with onion and sun-dried tomatoes was good and also the mushroom agnelotti with truffle oil dish was good too.
 All the food served was good and can definitely go there again to try other things there.

Food and ambience is much better in J W marriot with less price. I went today for lunch but starters their is nothing. Start with main course with few options. I asked one guy is their any complimentary drink with buffet, he said mojito or lime soda or coke. I ordered fr mojito but mojito was awful. And sad to see that they have taken 850 rs only for mojito. Even they charged 18% GST on total bill. Already GOVT. of India passed order for 5% and its being followed from yesterday. But when i asked he said no sir we are taking 18%. So next if i have to go i wl never go or suggest any body  to oberoi. Its unprofessional.

A grand experience at The Grand.. Reading zomato reviews and seeing the awesome ratings decided to pay a visit there on my b'day. The staff behaviour is top notch- a smile always ready on their faces. A classy ambiance. Wonderful decor. Now for the food.. We opted for the buffet. We were served soup and bread basket and hot starters on the table. There was an endless no. of salads.. both veg and non-veg. I found them all very tasty. Then went in for the sushi. Was having them for the first time.. Liked the taste of maki and nigiri but found the dipping sauce very salty( not an expert about it). For mains there was lamb biriyani, chicken chimichurri.. Polau.. Parshe jhol... Chkn masala.. Beef curry.. Array of papads. Whatever i tried was very delicious. Then i went in for the dessert... Cant name the exhaustive list.. All extremely yummy. The custard.. mousse.. Souffle.. Indian sweets.. Gateaux.. Wish i had another tummy. And the dark chocolate hazelnut pie(?) i dont know what to say.... Need a repeat visit.

The Oberoi Grand is loaded with childhood memories for me and its a place I am rather sentimental about. That being said I wondered how much I would enjoy the modern and contemporary feel of Threesixtythree. The moment we stepped in for dinner my mind was put to rest .... loved the mellow elegant ambiance and loved the bar on the right as well.Most people rave about the buffet but we went on Valentine's and ordered a special set menu. I loved the food and the lamb shanks we ate were absolutely stunning the best I have had in Kolkata by far. A great place to chill out , talk or even conduct a business meeting.

Few snippets from the amazing lunch buffet at the long awaited 363.

More than the Food and the ambience I am a big fan of Oberoi Hospitality and warmth.The personal attention that each staff gave for buffet was even more than what One could expect for a la carte

Personal favourite being the maki & margarita pizza and the cheese chilly kulcha-we went into a state of food coma after the gastronomical delight!

If you want to spend some good time and want to be treated like royalty you must head to this place.although I did not particularly like the indian spread but with so many choices on a buffet had nothing to complain!

A weekend buffet breakfast was had and relished here recently. Factors that make a difference to me at a five star:

Spread - top notch, I wouldn't want much more from a breakfast spread. Ranges from exotic fruit, smoothies, juices, muesli, cereal, English (yogurt, eggs), Continental (cheeses, croissants), south Indian (idli & dosa), north Indian (paratha & kachori), pancakes, waffles.

Presentation - uniformly great, full of small touches. The humble upma was served with a flourish. The juices were all in glass jars. 

Quality - pretty great, most things hit the mark. I especially like one of the mueslis and the broccoli hash. Toast was super light. Only the south Indian dishes were below average. While some of the chutneys were good, they were all lacking. 

Service - impeccable, faultlessly polite

This place was in my wishlist for a long time..
Finally i made a visit to this place last sunday..
On sundays there are two types of brunches are present one with alcohol which round up around Rs 2500 all inclusive and the branch without alcohol cost Rs 2065 all inclusive.
I would also add on weekdays they have buffet which sums up around Rs 1785 approx all inclusive.
Now coming to the ambience.. I need not have to say much as it is located at grand oberoi.. So it name says it all. The ambience was great.. The staffs behaviour were superb. The ambience was too classy and perfect for a date.. Or a meeting or a family lunch or any sort of occasions.
Please prefer to book a table before hand..
And yup for sure check the dates before visiting the place as during festive seasons for example durga puja they changed their menu and prices.
And normal menu was also available along side with brunch and buffet.
Now they offer a variety of starters and soft drinks.
Starters include a lot of items in veg as well as non veg dishes. The starters will satisfy both ur eyes as well as your taste buds with its presentation and taste... From pork to mushrooms.. To chicken to beef.. Fish all are present in starters.
Then the live counter of sushi was dere for all sushi lovers or for those who try them for the first time.
I was not much satisfied with the main course.
They didnt have much spread over main course.
I think this part would have been improved.
Main course have had itz separate veg and non veg counters along with live pizza counters.. And soups sections.
One must try the live sausage cooked and served in different sauces. It was great in taste.
The varities of papad will draw your attention for sure.
Now coming to the dessert part..
The live waffle counter was the main attraction. The flavours of the waffle was great in taste. Wd serval types of dsserts dishes. Including dark chocolates.. Fruit tarts!
In short i had a great experience visiting the place.
The costing was ok compared to the brand name grand oberoi.
The food quality was indeed great.
So food lovers this place is a must visit for you gueys.
Hope to visit it soon in some time..

Well it was a return to Kolkata after long time. On navami night went to the special puja buffet with wife. This was undoubtedly the best buffet I ever had. All the items were cooked to perfection. May be for the first time I had a doubt which item to eat over others. Specially all the prawn dishes were delicious. The biriyani & chicken chap were way better than those oil laden ones served at Park circus giants. Yet the biriyani and chap both had the typical Kolkata flavour. The staffs were very courtaceous. Overall a great experience.

I visited this place during my friends birthday. I had pre-booked a table for 2 and reached in advance. The ambience is very beautiful and is enticing. The decor is done magically and totally adds on to the mood. The staff is very courteous (special mention for Mr.Subham-he aa ranged a stole for me since I was cold), which makes it all the more a great experience! 
Now,starting with the food- we started with a soup. I wanted to have cream of tomato , though it did not figure on the menu, they got it made especially at my request (thanks to Subham). And when it arrived , the soup was delicious, just a suggestion they can add it to their menu. I don't think I've had a better soup- truly the taste is tuck with me . Next we went for dahi kebabs- I would say I've had better. Nevertheless, it tasted good. Also, a special mention her of the buns they gave us- they had stuffing of onion and was amazing! Next we went for Amritsari chhole kulche- the kulcha was amazing and the chhole would be better if dried instead of with gravy. The highlight of the dinner was the cake- we had sat in the bar and hence they got us a nice cake, as requested. Therefore, when we shifted to the restaurant they gave us the cake they had kept! I had no idea that the restaurant and the bar were 2 separate entities, else would have sat directly in the restaurant. Both the cakes were delicious. Loved the total experience! Thank you Oberoi for a totally loveable and special experience !! I will surely come again ! :)

Visit this place often for a round of cube dessert, cream cheese sushi and cold coffee ! It's amazingly made . Presentation and taste both are amazing ! Nice calm ambience perfect for dinner! :) Their North Indian dinner is nice too. Their black dal, yellow dal , stuffed paneer ,paneer in red gravy all are nice ! From the breads I like the stuffed kulcha the best . For dessert their evergreen ice cream sandwich is nice too ! :)

No intro is needed for this place.  Went to Three sixty three on 4th September. We had a pre booking. We received a warm welcome.. This place is just wonderful.. Service was amazing and all the staff were helpful.. 
We opted for non veg buffet lunch. They served the soup of the day. I never had this kind of soup before.  It was the best soup I ever had.  
There were lots of options in salads. But the fish salad was the best. 
I was excited to taste sushi for the first time.  I took mixed veg, crab and salmon. Sushi contains raw fish.  They  told us about that.  But still I choose to give a try. But it didn't suit me.  I had to suffer from stomach pain.  So I want to make people aware about this.  Please be careful. It may make you ill. Carefully listen  what they have used as ingredients. If any of those doesn't suit you, don't try it. 
Main course had a huge variety both in veg and non veg sections. Each item was tasty. 
Desert also has a lot of options. It was nice too. 
They made a cake for us. And it was superb. 
Totally loved the experience.
Will  love to visit again.

In one ward the grand buffet.... After entering the hotel you have to find it out at ground floor after the bon Thai....it's really a great place in Kolkata...every thing belongs to here is grand.......We went their on our special occasion.... We were seated in a table for two...the ambience is classic old style....may be the most beautifully decorated restaurant.....

Buffet started with veg and nonveg salads,then comes the soup of the day,...after that we tasted susi,then the main course...each item was very tasty..

Special mention is for the extra ordinary special cake for our anniversary... The desert section was also good...mainly options were there...

It was a great experience...

Yesterday we went to Threesixtythree  for dinner -to celebrate my husband's birthday. While making reservation I had requested them to make a Birthday Cake of fresh Fruits and trust me their hospitality won our hearts.
The ambience, quality of food and the ever smiling staffs were just awesome.
We ordered Galoti Kebab, Schiuan Dry Chicken, Pepperoni Pizza and Dynamite Sushi- which was their signature and best dish of the night. 
And finally they presented the cake which was sooo yummy. And its so sweet of Threesixtythree they gifted us the birthday cake. We will surely visit next time to tryout all their sushi dishes and desserts.
Thanks for your great service

It may seem that compared to other 5 stars' the restaurant is smaller, but don't get deceived. The spread is beautiful. Cold cuts, salads, and shushis are wonderful. In fact, one of the best shushis in Kolkata. Service is also impeccable.

One of my favourites in this city.
This place gives the most luxurious feeling when you are seated inside the restaurant.
Location : Oberoi Grand
Service - A1, very courteous staff & they were helpful in what to order as well.
Food - i had ordered for aglio olio spaghetti - the taste was very different which i used to have it regularly but it was very good.
Will be surely visiting again very very soon.

Hands down one of the best restaurants I've been in. 
I went there on my mom's birthday. 
The staffs were very cooperative and their behaviour was very friendly. The ambience of that place was something else. Candles lit and the environment was very peaceful. 
The quality of the food and drinks was lip smacking.

Came as warm and cordial invitation from zomato to join the Zomato Foodie Meet Up @363 degree.

An afternoon well spent with the the fellow foodies from zomato at the city's finest lavish world cuisine lunch destination @ 363 degree, Oberoi Grand.
Its our great pleasure to meet and talk to their legendary executive chef Sourab Banerjee who ƒáultivates daily to bring a new flavour to the menu in order to satisfy the palette of the guests.

Enjoy world cuisine at its best spanning culinary gems from several continents at this stylish destination. Their legendary Executive Chef Saurav Banerjee curates a whole new menu everyday along with his talented and experienced team of world-class professionals.

The lavish buffet spread comprised of seafood, meat salad, exotic and farm fresh greens, cheeses and cold cuts and desi chaats to Kebabs from northern flavours and wood-fired thin crust pizzas. The Sushi served on the table - tasted out of the world.
¬†
Main course followed by continental, desi, chinese platters. 

And of course the crave for sweet tooth, the dessert buffet offers starting from pastries, mousse , creme brulee, bengali sandesh and rossomalai were just amazing.

My thanks goes to Zomato and the team of Oberoi as well for their world class hospitality and the gesture - box of their boutique chocolates for the foodies.

Few special moments and some delicacies captured. .

five star and it has to be costly and it was. But the Pizza and Spaghetti we had made up everything we wanted that day. Amazing food, wonderful service, super courteous people. Indeed they are good at whatever they have and offer. They have indeed maintained their 5 star dignity and I and my FATHER(an ex Oberoi worker) felt obliged to be here for a reunion . Simply amazing. The decor is damnnnn cool. In general love low lights.

In one word, a perfect place. Lovely food , great Hospitality and service and the best of staff. First of all a big thanks to Protiksha for arranging everything as it was my wife's birthday and thanks to Akshit , our server. Excellent Hospitality..... unmatchable. Coming to food ..... Excellent.  Being vegetarian we ordered crackling maki which was just too good , so good that we need to order more to satisfy our palettes. Pizza was one of the best . Only ok dish was the mezze platter. Rest everything was top of the notch . Too good. We were also served a complimentary fruit gateaux to celebrate the occasion. Thanks a lot again for such a gesture.

Threesixtythree- you've taken my breath away! Mesmerising! I would recommend every food lover to come and try out the wide range of food that the buffet provides here (pictures are attached with my review). The main course can still improve though which is why I deducted a 0.5. Other than that here it is "quality over quantity". And trust me, you'll love the salads, sushis and desserts.
P.s.- Don't miss their ice creams. You'll thank me later :)
Thank you Team Threesixtythree for this GRAND experience!

Well, if someday I win a lottery or find a treasure chest in any oceanic abyss I would certainly not mind to spend those wealth in visiting this aesthetically beautiful restaurant "threesixtythree" days of a year
The decor is a medley of ancient elegance and ritzy modernism, bewitching enough to make u spellbound...
Now, barring any digressive discussions let's come to the main point, the food!!
Being seduced by the alluring images of the foods items, we went here to try their lunch buffet and as expected, they have completely satisfied my taste buds with the delectable lip smacking dishes! Let me discuss little more elaborately...
Starters : If you haven't tried sushi before, and thinking to give a try, add this place in your wishlist without hesitating as they are specialist to make you acquainted with this Japanese dish by suggesting the best sushis to start with..
Unlike all other buffet places, they don't have kebabs in the starter, but the chicken, prawn and squid salads will surely make you fall in love with these dishes, without forming any repentance in your mind for not getting the very cliche starter item, kebabs...

Main Course : Well, I truely think they should keep their eyes in this section and reformation and some variations is required in order to the overall betterment of the buffet because the main course is the nucleus of any buffet places...
Nevertheless, though lacking in variations, some dishes of the main course were truely good on the other hand...

Desserts : This is undoubtedly the best section of the buffet!! Especially the homemade ice creams they make is truely out of the world and probably the best ice creams I have ever had! The flavours are authentic and not a bit artificial...
The Brownie and rosomalai were also excellently well made... and after having the desserts you might suffer from cumpunction for not having it at first, in your empty stomach...
Lastly, to summarize the total review in just two lines :
"Threesixtythree
My foodie heart is won by thee" <3

The best place in the 'City of Joy' to enjoy a sumptuous buffet lunch. The food is outstanding with a complete areey of lip smacking delicacies from various cultures around the world along with their speciality mixed drinks made my day.
The best part about the meal was the top notch standard of service. The servers were extremely helpful and swift with assistance even before asking for it!
I would recommend their speciality sushis and the various entrees on the buffet. Overall it was a Grand dinning experience at the threesixtythree. Kudos to you people!

The hospitality of the Oberoi's has always been unmatched!! Kudos to three sixty three!! Thank you for the lovely Sunday brunch!! .5 has been cut from the rating as I had originally gone to eat a la carte but on Sundays only buffet is served! 
Would love to try dishes from the a la carte menu!

The oberi grand...as the name suggests it is indeed a 'grand' place to be. I went there last week to celebrate my mothers bday. The ambience is superb,the behaviour of the staffs were polite. The food quality was fantastic,starting from starters to main course it was just awesome. There was luchi chholar dal in the menu and also the famoys japanese sushi. The mutton kassa definitely deserves a special mention as it was too tasty. Everything was good but one drawback was that there were no prawn dishes in the menu. But still I would recommend everybody for a gala buffet
PS: If u visit for any special occassions like bday or anniversary they will provide a cake and celebrate if notified previously.

A buffet having sushis,pizza,salads and exotic chocolate desserts caught our attention.
We were very excited about going to this place and finally it happened.
Great hospitality,beautiful ambience and the special sushi counter made our experience a memorable one.
As we entered,we were mesmerized with the lovely ambience and cheerful staffs.
We had done our reservations so got our seats with no delay.
‚Ä¢Sushi-Firstly we tried the sushis made by a Japanese chef.
The sushis were well explained to us.
We tried all the sushis almost.
Fish sushis are supposed to have raw fish and no smell.
When we had salmon and yellow fish sushi,it melted in our mouth and could not resist ourselves from having more.
I had sushis before,but here I had the best kind.
‚Ä¢Salads-Moving on to the salad section,a huge pretty table at the centre is well decked up with widespread of veg and non veg salads.
I loved all the salads I tried,mainly the tangy prawn salad and squid salad.
Also the chicken and pork salad was tasty.
We were also served with thin crust veg pizza from their wooden oven.
The brocoli soup tastes really well.
‚Ä¢Maincourse-The maincourse had a lots of chinese and Mughlai food to choose from.
We had steam rice,biryani,yellow dal,butter naan,paneer,mutton,chicken,fish etc.
The food is absolutely lipsmacking.
‚Ä¢Dessert-I am a dessert person.And for all the dessert lovers like me,this dessert section here is heaven.
It had brownies made from fine chocolates,Dragon fruit salad,rosmalai,Bhapa sandesh,cream rolls,Custard,Raspberry Yoghurt,Ice cream etc.
I had a lots of dessert and loved all the items except caramel custard.It was charred and tasted bitter.
Everything else here is perfect.
The buffet is around 1750/- after adding taxes.
The food is worth the price.
There is no complemenrary drink.
Staffs are very well mannered and service is prompt.
We had an amazing lunch experience here.

As usual when I enter Grand, it still feels that same old way when we came here in childhood; even before many other 5* came to the city. Feeling grand in Grand is a done deal and that percolates down to the whole feel and awesomeness that waits for you at ThreeSixtyThree. 

The walk along the alley to the restaurant is so indulging. 

Went through the whole menu, before zeroing on the Risotto and the Pizza(Mushrooms and sundried tomatoes) coupled with Margarita but it's early to say much about the food as I missed out on the Sushis and Thai. Nevertheless, Risotto was so well done that it reminds me of the last best Risotto I had in Paiah(NZ)...

But yes, I would do be doing injustice if I miss out saying that their hospitality beat the one at The Hub(Taj)... 

More to follow after my second visit...

Absolutely bowled over by the brunch today! Had taken my Mom for the mother's day special brunch and we were delighted by the stunning food and the exceptional warmth of the staff. The salad press was lovely, the island was loaded with yummy goodness and the mezze selection was really nice. 

What I liked was the efficient refilling of the buffet. The staff was very proactive and was also helping the guests. 

The pizza was beautiful, very fragrant sauce and the crust was beautiful. Very cute name tags were given to the mains all themed after mothers day. 

The dessert was splendid. I fell in love with the Wasabi cake. It was a riot of flavors and textures. The nicest thing about all the desserts was that none of them were overtly sweet. The balance was perfect. 

In most brunches, there is a hero in terms of flavor or dish. But here everything was perfect. Every dish seemed hand crafted. 

Kudos to the team!

Strange that for my longest obsession with Oberoi and its food across India had to be dashed with 363. Food at the newly opened 363 didnt exactly wow me. Contemporary decor, quite staid and no staring moments or objects, their chairs being the best part of it. 
Al a carte still remains as good. Buffet is where is hits the lowest key. Salad spread wows you, however the vegetarian spread or the no -veg spread grossly disappoints. If you like sushi, there is some wee bit saving grace, but no the spread really needs to walk the mile!

A FULL CIRCLE

The Oberoi Grand‚Äôs restaurants had long stopped being just a fancy five star restaurant and had become a part of the city‚Äôs lore. Just like most diehard foodies have a favourite for biryani, or daab chingri, most self respecting gourmands had stories about La Terasse‚Äôs (and before that Garden Cafe) about its Smoked Hilsa or its Lobster Thermidor. No wonder when La Terraase shut down in 2016 it left quiet a big gap in the city‚Äôs culinary scene.

Threesixtythree, the all day dining restaurant, that has opened in this space has been the talk of the town from the word go. The space somehow seems more welcoming with the flood of light coming through from the 400 sq ft skylight. The Bar is not separated from the restaurant anymore and instead feels more integrated into the restaurant. Clearer glass overlooking the corridor and the pool gives one that sense of watching the world go by.

To do true justice to the food at the restaurant one needs to dine twice there. Once to try the almost gargantuan spread in the buffet and once more to savour the offerings from the a la carte menu.¬†

The skylight here works like a spotlight on the salads and cold cuts counter in the restaurant. Prawn cocktail, seafood mousse, bright and pretty trio of hummus, assortment of breads, olives and cheeses ‚Äî the menu changes every day and it will ¬†take a diner a lot of will power to save room for main course. The same goes for the dessert spread, but more on that later.

Of the a la carte options must tries include the Tomato Burrata Salad ‚Äì handmade organic soft cheese with succulent tomatoes in a light but flavourful dressing. If you‚Äôre a fan of risottos the Tomato and Honey Risotto is as bright on the plate as it is on the palate. The honey‚Äôs sweetness balances the tang of a tomato sauce which goes well with the texture of the al dente pasta and the smattering of pine nuts.

The Japanese offerings on the menu have become something of signature to the restaurant, thanks to Japanese specialty chef Raul Borja. Colourful sashimi ¬†on dry ice and colourful pebbles, Nigiri sushi with tuna salmon or yellowtail, or the vegetarian uramaki ‚Äî take your pick from the one the freshest sushi available in town. Speaking of fish, if you are in the mood for a treat try the Chilean Sea bass. A light sweetish miso based sauce on the thick but still juicy slice of fish, with its crispy skin intact ‚Äî it is a dish that respects its ingredient.

For desserts, though don‚Äôt miss their signature item The Cube. A hollow cube of tempered chocolate holds a rich dark chocolate mousse (made from the exquisite Vralhona chocolate...good luck finding that in airport duty frees these days!) that‚Äôs complimented with a smooth Armagnac ice cream and the plate dotted with tangy raspeberry coulis lemon cream that make for the perfect palate refresher.

Threesixtythree has had, since its inception, huge boots to fill not just because of the reputation of La Terasse but also because of Threesixty brand has come to be known for. Those boots, if they can be of a gastronomical variety, ¬†are more than properly filled.

It all started when Zomato decided to organize a foodie meet up at one of the finest dining places in the city , the Threesixtythree . In the heart of The Oberoi Grand, this is where you come to spend a quality time amidst some world class international cuisine that is spread to give you an experience like no other.¬† The restaurant is decked up in natural light courtesy the partial glass ceiling and large windows .The journey will begin at their classy bar where the ambience is woven in a way to let people engage in conversation in a relaxed manner while they sip their way through a fine selection of wines, rare single malt whiskey and some world class cocktails .
                                                                ...

First of all I thank #zomato for giving me the opportunity to visit "Three Sixty Three" for the zomato meetup. It's a privilege to walk down the stairs of this grand structure and to taste the palatable delicacies .
The newest addition to Oberoi Grand is "The Three Sixty Three" which is offering the "All-Your-Can-Eat" buffet lunch.
To start with we got a royal welcome to the dining hall, where the chef briefed us about the concept of the buffet.
The elaborate spread was all about freshness, aroma and taste. We had the special opportunity to savour the sushi made by chef Raul. The entr√©e s offered a wide choice of salads, meat loaf, special cheese, fresh olives. There is a chance , you will find it difficult to choose from the wide variety. The mains consisted of pastas, Indian breads, biriyani , lamb curry and Chinese items.
But , save your appetite for the end!!! The dessert section was indeed a visual delight besides being totally appealing to the taste buds. The dessert list
was long and indeed the lunch ended in the perfect sweet note.
The dessert counter had

Berry baked yoghurt

I went to this beautifully laid out restaurant today for buffet lunch but, extremely unfortunately, had a series of unpleasant experiences that completely ruined the lunch for me. I do not wish to list these issues over here because I have already discussed these at length right then and there with Sabrina, the F&B Service Manager, who handled the matter quite professionally and assured me that I had very valid grievances which she would take up with all those involved. I therefore remain optimistic that no other customer will ever have to go through the ordeal that I had to go through today. I also want to speak highly of chef Rana, who displayed excellent knowledge about the various dishes, and who happily took the initiative to help me out more than once!

I wish to point out that much of the information given by Zomato (as of today), and that given in the earlier reviews for this restaurant, is wrong or outdated! From Monday to Saturday the buffet is available only till 3 pm and not till 3:30 pm. Also sushis are no longer part of the regular buffet, but are available only as part of a more expensive 'special buffet' ... so be warned! Finally the regular buffet does not include a 'welcome drink' or mocktail ... and no, they do not hand out boxes of chocolates to take away after a meal (refer to the earlier reviews)!

The sushis are actually the highlight of the spread. So if you feel that you don't want to pay extra and would rather limit yourself to the regular buffet, my suggestion then is to have the buffet at other properties instead such as at Lalit Great Eastern or HHI or Park. The buffet there is nearly as tasty, there are more options available in starters, kababs and pizzas (but they do not include beef in their buffet, as this restaurant does), their basic buffet most probably also includes mocktails and, above all, they are a lot more affordable particularly if you use coupons from LittleApp and Nearbuy (and I would seriously suggest that Oberoi Grand should accept them too, because it will surely boost its business significantly).

However if you decide to go in for sushis, then in my opinion this restaurant serves the second best sushis in the country after Baan Tao at Hyatt Pune. Which is a lot of deserving praise for what I got to sample here today, and yes, it surely is worth trying out! And if you do not know much about sushis or are not particularly keen to try out raw salmon & tuna, then the best option is to go for the crab sushis for they are indeed very tasty and very well prepared!!

It is for a reason that The Oberoi Grand is fondly called the Grand Dame Of Kolkata. Needless to say ever since I heard about their newly opened All Day Dining space, Threesixtythree0, it made straight to the top of my ‚Äòto-go‚Äô places. I cannot thank Zomato more as they invited me to their lunch buffet spread a couple of weekends back. Along with fellow food enthusiasts of the city and the hospitality of the Oberoi, it was one fine day brimming with cheer and deliciousness.
                                                                ...

How grand will you feel if you are going to have lunch in the newly opened ThreeSixtyThree degrees in Grand Oberoi? I distinctly felt a sense of heritage, grandeur and the discreet sense of all pervasive luxury that‚Äôs always prevalent in a 5 star property such as theirs.
The d√©cor is a fine balance of old and new and boasts of long ago photographs- a testimonial of their colonial roots and heritage.
The occasion was a Zomato Meet ‚ÄìUp for some of their reviewers and I was cordially invited. We were welcomed with alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, served in very unusually engraved glasses in their bar area. The bar is well stocked and exudes warmth and class.
Moving on to the food area, which can be called as Casual Fine Dining, you will be immediately arrested by the strategically placed sun roof. Below the sun roof is the salad counter. the delectable offers included cold cuts, Hummus, Ganoush, imported olives, cheeses like Brie, Cheddar, Gouda, Prosciutto, Black grapes, dates, crackers, Prawn cocktails to name a few. 
We were presented with some amuse-bouche, which is a bite sized hors d'≈ìuvre and tasted just great. The newly opened place offers offers continental,Indian , Japanese and Indian- Chinese fares. We were served some very delicious sushis. The sushis had a filling of cheese, broccoli and was topped with  paprika, a creamy sauce and crispies, to be dipped in a light andslightly smoky and salty soy sauce. We were also served a thin crust Margherita which they have a live counter for.
For the main course, amidst myriad of choices I tried their Hyderabadi Biryani, Baked Fish in lemon butter sauce and a chicken Kebab- the name I am ashamed to say that in moments of gluttony I have forgotten. The food needlessly to say was delicious and very very well cooked. 
What should be highlighted and written in golden letters is about their Dessert section. What a heaven for the dessert lovers! Sheer bliss. The extensive dessert menu consisted of the following ‚Äì
Tiramisu
Berry verline
Berry baked yoghurt
Deconstructed cheesecake
Chocolate popsicle
Vanilla Bean creme brulee
Gateaux - slow bake with coffee buttercream
White chocolate pralines
Rajbhog
Rosogula
Nolen Gur Sandesh
Chocolate sandesh
Angoori Rasmalai
Malai chamcham
Kheer samosa
Baked sandesh
The Desserts were not only sweet surprises but were also absolute amazing to look at. So much so, that I sat with the chocolate butterfly, loathe to eat it. The Tiramisi and Cr√®me Brulee along with the White chocolate Pralines were killers. I had more than one helpings of each.
The price for this extensive buffet? Rs.1450 plus tax. I plan to go back as soon as my daughter is back. We were also presented with a box of sinful chocolates to take back home, which my son loved and devoured.
Would like to thank Zomato and Samridhi,Arpita and Chef Saurav Banerjee‚Ä¶ Thank you for your kind hospitality and for an afternoon to remember.

A party of two: my grandfather and I. We had gone there for dinner. 
The service was excellent. The buffet selection was small but the food was top-notch. (Quality over quantity I'd say) My grandfather didn't like the selection, but when he asked for some fresh mutton biryani, they obliged and he left a happy man. 
I'd suggest this place for dinner if you're not very hungry and looking to get pampered.

Threesixtythree¬∞ reflects the Heritage, Grandeur and Royalty that The Grand Oberoi is synonymous with. Also, it rightly claims to be Kolkata's finest address for international fine dining.

The bar section will offer you the finest wines while the beautifully sunlit restaurant will dazzle you with the magnificent lunch buffet spread which covers European, Asian, Japanese and Indian Cuisines. You can opt for a-la-carte too, the menu offers the choicest gastronomic delicacies! 

Highlights? The exquisite Salad Bar (Do not miss the cold cuts, olives, steak salad, Gouda cheese), The Sushi Counter, Wood Fired Pizzas, Baked Fish in lemon butter sauce!

A special shout out for the Dessert section! To name a few ‚Äì Tiramisu, Deconstructed cheesecake, Gateaux - slow bake with coffee buttercream, Chocolate popsicle, White chocolate pralines, Rajbhog, Nolen Gur Sandesh, Chocolate Sandesh, Angoori Rasmalai, Malai chamcham, Kheer samosa and Baked Sandesh. 

Price for Lunch Buffet? Rs.1450 + Tax. Absolutely reasonable, considering the lavish spread!

What else? The legendary service! The hospitality that will compel you to return again and again.

Highly Recommended!

¬†

P.S. Thank you Zomato for the invitation. Thank you Threesixtythree¬∞ for the awesome food and hospitality!

(TL:DR Version - YOU MUST READ THIS ONE! PLEASE!)(Post warning : I will be using exquisite or similar adjectives a LOT.)

I was invited here for a Zomato meet up and ofcourse the excitement was at an all time high!

¬†We met up at the bar area which had the most royal of touches, walls adorned with old photographs and beautiful paintings, blue velvet sofas and some light music in the background, the ambience of the place almost felt surreal!

We then moved on to our table after tasting some of their signature cocktails which use ingredients heavily used in Bengal to influence their tastes, panchphoron, Darjeeling tea and Star Anise were at the base of some of these cocktails and let me tell you, they were absolutely stunning!

Once at the table, we were presented with an amuse-bouche, which tasted absolutely well balanced.

We then moved on to the salad bar which had the freshest of produce, cold cuts and other items as well. I cannot explain to you how fresh all the produce was, the olives were pitted and were definitely one of the best ones I've eaten in Calcutta. The salad bar also consisted of gouda cheese, black grapes, dates, prosciutto, muskmelon, watermelon salads, prawn cocktails and all the works. The best part about the salad bar, it sat right under a sun roof and the lighting made it look even better!

We were then served some Sushi on our table and by god I've never had anything like that! It was crispy and soft at the same time, it wasn't too spicy but it wasn't bland either, the flavour was too good, the pickled ginger was amazing, the wasabi was great, oh, I'm drooling while I write this, I'm sure I must have eaten a LOT of it!

We then went on to the main course which consisted of a huge spread, I'll only write about the items I ate and I ate sparingly because I had to make room for the desserts! I first tried their fish in lemon, butter and herb sauce which was amazing, I loved the sauce and the fish was well cooked! I tried nadru ki tikki which I don't really know much about other than the fact that it tasted amazing! I had some hasselback potatoes and some vegetables and water chestnuts wok tossed in ginger sauce as well. We were then served with freshly made wood fired pizzas with sundried tomatoes and bocconcini cheese, it definitely comes to one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten in Calcutta!

That was main course for me before I pounced onto desserts.

The desserts were out of this world both presentation wise and taste wise, I had atleast 6 different desserts including the vanilla bean creme brulee, the berry verline, the baked yougurt cheese cake, the white chocolate praline and the tiramisu. I'm not writing more about this as I won't be able to do justice to it.¬†

Please visit the restaurant, it's definitely worth it in all ways, the buffet is priced economically as well and they offer SO much! The staff is very courteous and there's an infectious positive energy around the entire place.¬†

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram and Facebook. (Same name in both places)

Was invited here for a foodie meetup over lunch, which was a first of its kind for me.

Blending classic heritage, European charm with touches of contemporary elegance, and an authentic food menu comprising world cuisine, this newly refurbished restaurant of The Oberoi Grand, that opened its doors this year, truly lives up to its expectations.

With a lavish buffet spread, a sumptuous main course menu of culinary delicacies spanning across  Hakka Chinese, Continental and even delectable Indian dishes, and a tempting dessert spread, we were simply spoilt for choices.
 The desserts were particularly decorated beautifully in picture-perfect presentations, such that one would only want to click pictures and not mar their pretty dainty appearances!

Indulging in delicious amuse-bouche, salads, Shahi Paneer with Indian bread, and slices of the most delicious, gorgeous thin-crust pizza Margherita served at our table, had a wonderful time with my fellow foodies, amidst jovial conversations on food and the management's gracious hospitality. 
Taste and quality of food, needless to say, were par excellence. We were also offered interesting alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks initially, and served sushi from their live sushi counter. I only wish I could have had more, perhaps tasted their entire menu!

The ambiance was one exuding relaxation, comfort and charming sophistication with sunlight pouring in through the lovely skylight in the ceiling. We even interacted with the executive Chef who welcomed us with his warm hospitality and briefed us on the food scenario.

Lastly as a token of their appreciation we were gifted boxes of lip-smacking chocolates which are probably some of the best I've ever tasted.

I would like to thank Samridhi from Zomato for kindly inviting me to this gathering, Aparna from the Oberoi who accompanied us through our delightful gastronomic journey with warmth, graciousness and the most cordial hospitality, and the servers and all those who took such good care of our constant needs and demands with unparalled proficiency and efficient service. A heartfelt thanks to all at the Oberoi and definitely Zomato for making the experience a memorble one, worth cherishing. :)

Have been writing reviews on Zomato for nearly 5 yrs now. So was delighted to receive an invite from Zomato for a meet-up at this restaurant for the Saturday brunch.

ThreeSixtyThree is the new multi-cuisine restaurant cum bar which has come up at the Oberoi Grand in place of the old La Terrace.¬† The d√©cor of this place is a blend of the old and the new. The period paintings on the walls reminding us of the old British era roots of this hotel, while the skylight allowing in natural sunlight adding a certain dynamism and freshness to this space.

Coming to the food, one is spoilt for choice. To the usual continental and Indian fare of the old La Terrace, they have added a whole new Japanese section. Plus there is a Chinese section as a nod to the unique brand of Indo-Chinese food for which Kolkata is famous. When there is so much variety on offer, I usually concentrate on the continental section. I started from the salad counter with their delectable collection of cold cuts, bruschetta, cheese, olives and usual condiments, before moving on to their main course dishes. In between they served some really innovative sushi from their sushi counter, while the thin crust pizza from their live pizza counter reminded me of the time spent in Italy. The dessert section was excellent as well, with pastries, tiramisu and other offerings looking as good as they tasted. Overall the food was of a very high standard, but considering the high expectations one has from a place like this, they may decide to throw in a few more exotic items (may be some duck/pork/lamb dishes and some tuna/salmon sushi) as part of their standard buffet fare. ¬†

All throughout, Samridhi from Zomato and Aparna of Oberoi took really good care of us and the warmth, hospitality and attention to detail that one expects from an Oberoi group hotel was in full display from every staff we came across.¬† All in all,¬† the chance to meet some of the fellow passionate foodies from Kolkata, people whom I knew only from their writings, over some really good food made this a truly memorable afternoon.

I visited here this afternoon as part of the Zomato Foodie meetup , the first of its kind for me. We were given welcome drinks , both alcohol based and non alcohol based. The drink that i had , had the flavour panch phoran , which is a mixture of spices , common in bengali households. There were other drinks too such as the Babughat and another which had Darjeeling tea as it's base and was topped with gandharaj lemon. 
When we went to our tables , a pre appetiser had already been placed. It was watermelon and cream with parsley over stroked melon dressing. It tasted good. 
What I really liked about this place was their salad bar. It had a variety of salads from all over the world , as well as the common Indian and middle eastern favourites. The cold cuts were delicious. They had freshly imported olives which were juicy and tender. Hummus , lavash, baba ganoush were also part of this table. I had some sushi and tenderloin salad. The salad was very good , it was tangy and full of flavour and the tenderloin was very well cooked. The steak , tenderloin or any beef based dish has always been the best at The Grand. So never miss out on that whenever you visit ! There were two kinds of bruschetta too , the classic and a slightly modified one where tomato had been replaced by meat. Their baked tomato was also good , with mozzarella topping it. The calamari and cucumber salad was very refreshing. I loved how perfectly the calamari had been cooked. 
For the main course , there was Indian , Chinese , continental food. Indian food comprised of dal makhani, paneer , kebabs , rogan josh and palak corn and bengali delicacies. Chinese food comprised of Hakka noodles and tenderloin and vegetables in gravy , along with other dishes. From continental I had the grilled fish in lemon butter and herb cream. The fish was tender and broke easily. The cream was thick and rich. Hyderabadi biryani was also a part of the huge buffet and was served with raita. They also have a wood fired oven where delicious pizzas are made. I had the classic margherita, served hot with bubbling cheese and a lovely tomato sauce. It was thin crust , which is my favourite and the base was well seasoned. 
There was sushi served at the table which is by far the best I've had. It consisted of broccoli , cucumber and cheese as it's filling and was topped with crispies, paprika and a creamy sauce. They served it with galangal and wasabi, the presentation of which I loved. Wasabi , looked as if it was a fern plant , as it had been carved out so well. The sushi was really good , as all the elements really brought the entire dish together. The soy sauce was light and smoky. 
Finally , the desserts were so many and so tempting that it was difficult to decide what to eat. Apart from the Sandeep , rasgulla, rasmalai and other bengali sweets they had ( which is mandatory to have if you're in Bengal ), there was flourless dark chocolate cake , which was rich and dense , and had strawberry and coffee icing along with dark chocolate. There was tiramisu where the mousse was light and airy and the sponge was really soft. What I loved most in the desserts was the creme br√ªl√©e. It was very creamy and the sweetness was spot on. I also had a sweet samosa , which tasted similar to the chandrakala mithai. It was drenched in sugar syrup and was amazing. In the end , we were all gifted a box of chocolates which were delicious. 
Three sixty three is the new renovated form of La teres and has opened only three months back. Apart from the legendary restaurants this hotel has , three sixty three has really uplifted the quality of food at the Oberoi. Their wide array of dishes , from possibly every part of the world has proven to be too good to be true. The pizza , sushi and tenderloin are a must try.

One of the newest places in town. Service is very good and staffs are very very courteous. The menu is more inclined towards non vegetarians, though the veg food is not bad at all. 
Overall a very good experience.

The Oberoi Grand, somehow carries an air of old traditional Calcutta (and not Kolkata). And the good part is this is one of the few big hotels in the city that I felt is always doing good business both on rooms and F&B segment. Jokingly, I was told that there are loyalists who may and will object, if a sandwich is cut in some other shape than the traditional one‚Ä¶  So, tradition rules here- period.

When I was told that they‚Äôre re-branding its coffee shop with the world cuisine thrown in, and naming it after the famed Three-sixty in New Delhi and Three-sixty-One in Gurgaon, I was happy. And when I came to know they‚Äôre offering their lunch buffet with a live Sushi counter offering unlimited sushi (off course at a pocket-friendly price), I was happier.

Now, Three-Sixty-three, being an Oberoi property, is chic and posh. The sublime air of class could be felt. The outlet has got a lovely partial glass-ceiling, so natural sunlight was aplenty. As we found our seats, being the seasoned glutton that I am, I started looking for food station. And, I found, the whole outlet is having 6 food counters, namely,

The salad bar having one of the widest spread of cold cuts and salads with ample amount of non-veg and prawn items thrown in

The live Sushi counter (star of the show)

The Indian counter

The European food counter also serving wood-fired pizza

The oriental counter specialising in the special Calcutta/ tangra styled chinese food  and

The dessert counter

We were asked for our choice of cocktails (not in the regular lunch buffet package) and as usual, I trusted the server. He got me a strange item. It was cognac base mixed with Darjeeling tea and the result was sublime. It was one of the strangest yet lovely drinks that I had in a long, long time. And, in between he was getting it for me, I got my plate-full of salad to go with it‚Ä¶ Frankly, if you ask me, I‚Äôll be unable to name everything that I took. And thankfully, there was a lady at the salad counter who was guiding idiots like me about the names and ingredients‚Ä¶ But, as usual, I completely ignored her and went by my instincts‚Ä¶. And, I must say, they didn‚Äôt betray me. But, again, the Bruchetta was fantastic along with the Calcutta-chinese styled shrimp salad in hot and sour dressing. Basically, I would suggest, go for whatever excites you visually- because taste-wise, they‚Äôre all good (at least whatever I‚Äôve tried).

And after I was through with the huge spread, my tummy needed some rest and while I asked for one assorted sushi platter enjoying my drinks, it came. Now, Sushi always looks good, in fact it‚Äôs one of the prime USP of the dish. And, same was the case here. They were gorgeous looks-wise and also were a treat for the taste-buds. ‚ÄúTo hell with the main course, I‚Äôll only stick to these‚Äù I told myself and gorged in‚Ä¶

After finishing a plateful of these little beauties, obviously, there was no place left for the main course and I headed straight to the dessert section. Now, this is one section, for which, Oberoi is famous for and this time also, it was no different. The Tiramisu was slightly unusual in texture, while the heavy chocolate gateaux was perfect‚Ä¶ And the velvet cake was awesome.

This buffet is priced at 1450/-+ Tax on weekdays and 1650/-+ Tax for an extravagant brunch on sundays (the version with unlimited alcohol is 2250/-+ Tax BTW and I feel is a better deal). And considering the offering and the sushi counter, I feel is a damn good deal.

Will I come back again ? Hell, yes. If not, my family will kill me‚Ä¶

And, apologies for my bad, bad mobile photography.

When I was told that they‚Äôre re-branding its coffee shop with the world cuisine thrown in, and naming it after the famed Three-sixty in New Delhi and Three-sixty-One in Gurgaon, I was happy. And when I came to know they‚Äôre offering their lunch buffet with a live Sushi counter offering unlimited sushi (off course at a pocket-friendly price), I was happier.

Now, Three-Sixty-three, being an Oberoi property, is chic and posh. The sublime air of class could be felt. The outlet has got a lovely partial glass-ceiling, so natural sunlight was aplenty. As we found our seats, being the seasoned glutton that I am, I started looking for food station. And, I found, the whole outlet is having 6 food counters, namely,

The salad bar having one of the widest spread of cold cuts and salads with ample amount of non-veg and prawn items thrown in

The live Sushi counter (star of the show)

The Indian counter

The European food counter also serving wood-fired pizza

The oriental counter specialising in the special Calcutta/ tangra styled chinese food  and

The dessert counter

We were asked for our choice of cocktails (not in the regular lunch buffet package) and as usual, I trusted the server. He got me a strange item. It was cognac base mixed with Darjeeling tea and the result was sublime. It was one of the strangest yet lovely drinks that I had in a long, long time. And, in between he was getting it for me, I got my plate-full of salad to go with it‚Ä¶ Frankly, if you ask me, I‚Äôll be unable to name everything that I took. And thankfully, there was a lady at the salad counter who was guiding idiots like me about the names and ingredients‚Ä¶ But, as usual, I completely ignored her and went by my instincts‚Ä¶. And, I must say, they didn‚Äôt betray me. But, again, the Bruchetta was fantastic along with the Calcutta-chinese styled shrimp salad in hot and sour dressing. Basically, I would suggest, go for whatever excites you visually- because taste-wise, they‚Äôre all good (at least whatever I‚Äôve tried).

And after I was through with the huge spread, my tummy needed some rest and while I asked for one assorted sushi platter enjoying my drinks, it came. Now, Sushi always looks good, in fact it‚Äôs one of the prime USP of the dish. And, same was the case here. They were gorgeous looks-wise and also were a treat for the taste-buds. ‚ÄúTo hell with the main course, I‚Äôll only stick to these‚Äù I told myself and gorged in‚Ä¶

After finishing a plateful of these little beauties, obviously, there was no place left for the main course and I headed straight to the dessert section. Now, this is one section, for which, Oberoi is famous for and this time also, it was no different. The Tiramisu was slightly unusual in texture, while the heavy chocolate gateaux was perfect‚Ä¶ And the velvet cake was awesome.

This buffet is priced at 1450/-+ Tax on weekdays and 1650/-+ Tax for an extravagant brunch on sundays (the version with unlimited alcohol is 2250/-+ Tax BTW and I feel is a better deal). And considering the offering and the sushi counter, I feel is a damn good deal.

Will I come back again ? Hell, yes. If not, my family will kill me‚Ä¶

And, apologies for my bad, bad mobile photography.

Visited Threesixtythree the recently opened restaurant at the Oberoi Kolkata and was far from satisfied specially considering the earlier gourmet memories at the hotel. The food was average except the Narkol Chingri and Paturi. The courteous and ever helpful staff more than made up for it

You cannot not have a grand experience while at the Oberoi Grand. The food was really very nice and the best part was that the dining room attendant offered us a complimentary Pizza (which we politely declined) as we were waiting for food to arrive. The "Cube" was amazing and tastes just as good as it looks. The Ahi Tuna Salad too will blow your mind. But the Claypot Baked Middle Eastern Chicken that we ordered wasn't at all extraordinary.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

They will not book a table for 8.00 pm. Apparently they will give a booking only at 7.15 pm for the first sitting and you have to reach by 7.30 pm. You can't reach later than 7.30 pm else your table goes. Super attitude!!! Now I understand why the restaurants over there don't run anymore.

This place is fantastic! The quality, flavors, service and presentation are top notch. We ordered: veg tempura sushi, pizza, aglio olio, garlic bread, quinoa salad, mushroom soup and the burrata salad. 

My favorites : Aglio Olio - perfect amount of olive oil and garlic, garlic bread was fresh with a great crunch, burrata cheese was amazingggg - all cheese fans have to try it.

Hospitality, ambience, service and food at its best! After a long long time in Kolkata have I had such well trained staff (Anant) serving us a meal in any 5 star. Sets the standards high and also the future expectations. 

Do not miss the chocolate CUBE. Very interesting indeed

Excellent !! Real great experience !! Something which shows your exquisite class !!

We celebrated our 9th. anniversary and we really got a royal treatment. Sushi with stuffed Tuna was something great. Bavarian Ham along with imported cheese. Biriyani was amazing. The staffs were so cordial, well mannered and very helpful.

Seriously disappointed. Service is inconsistent. Amazing at times and downright pedestrian otherwise, especially late in the evenings. 

You are better off at Alipore hotels!! They know how to treat people!!

You walk in to a glam mid century style decor and think you are in Europe, not Kolkata . The staff is incredible and the chef has a flair for presentation , so it's guaranteed your food will look as good as it tastes. The best sushi in the city can be found here along with an elaborate dessert bar and buffet if you decide to go at lunch. Do go at lunch :) finish your meal with a French press and you won't be disappointed! Fabulous :)

One of the worst services that I have ever experienced at this property .. they even could not attend to me after sitting there for 20 minutes and I had to talk to restaurant manager Mr Dwijottam and lodge a formal complaint

Newest restaurant as on date, at the oldest 5star in town, that replaced La Terrasse and Chowringhee Bar at Oberoi Grand Kolkata - Threesixtythree was quite an experience. The touch of modernity amidst the old-world charm blended quite well. The assemblage of period-photographs that adorns the long wall are a treat to ones eye. The visible skylight on the ceiling is one from the 'Garden Cafe' days back in 80's that used to house chirping birds that I still remember distinctly. Of course a lot has changed over the decades and the new avatar reaffirms the old saying that change is constant. 

Well the cuisine is an interesting mix of continental, indian, Chinese from china town, Italian, American and Indian. My selection was from a western main course - Scottish Salmon served on a bed of asparagus. It was filling and tasted succulent with the natural jus from the fish dominating the taste. The other one was a clay pot baked Middle eastern chicken with grilled vegetables and fatoush salad. 

The assistant chef personally visited our table to take a feedback and understand a scope of customization. Overall, we liked it very much. Yet I was still somewhere missing the earlier avatar, La Terrasse, but moving with time is the order of the day.
