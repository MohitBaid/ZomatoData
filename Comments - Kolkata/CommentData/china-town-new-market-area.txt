It's a shabby place in the lane beside Nizam's, serving generic Kolkata-Chinese food. Hygiene is something one should throw out the window when entering this place. We visited in a group and although it served as good place to hangout in our limited budgets, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who isn't paralyzed by such limitations.

We ordered the generic Rice and Noodle items(some pork variants were there too which was, to be honest, nice...nicer than what I had anticipated), two chicken side dishes and lots of fresh lemon soda. The disregard to name specific items here is to enforce the idea that it doesn't matter since whatever the item is, the process will be the same barring some minor tweaking in the sauces.

The place was a bit gloomy but it was spacious and the uncle who tended to our table was helpful.

Ambience : 1 out of 5 because there was a banana peel under our table and also a cat came in while we were eating. 
Service :5 on 5. The uncle was so cheerful. 
Food: 100 on 100. The food was amazing. It was so tasty. I could go on eating. The China town special hakka chow, the soup chow is a high recommend. 
It's a must try, though there was a slight distraction with the entrance of the cat.

This restaurant, with its shabby clichÃ©d Chinese motifs, looks like a setting of some old mafia movie where illegal drugs are peddled and a gun fight can break out anytime ..other than these imaginary connotations, the restaurant is quite bland be it the ambience or the food . The food in fact is quite tasteless and unhygienic ( noticed a hair in my food ðŸ˜¥). Only perks are that the restaurant is spacious , quiet and pocket friendly , good for big groups of college students on tight budget or broke couples in need of some quality time .

Have been going to this restaurant since I was 5yrs old....the food remains amazing...the chicken prawn fried rice and the chicken and prawn dishes are worth...price very reasonable
Never need to wait in a queue due to ample space
And the owner and her husband are amazing....today her elder sister even served and it felt totally like home...luv u guys
And people kindly review restaurants are per the pocket pinch too....its stupid to expect an ambience of Hyatt and ITC as per catagorisations present

Went there with a friend a while back during lunch offers at work!It is quaintly located in a squalid lane in New Market but this is quite a good destination for pork lovers... We had Pork Chopsuey, Roast Pork Fried Rice, and Chilli Pork!Â While the chopsuey and fried rice were incredibly awesome in taste, we were a tad disappointed by the Chilli Pork! But I loved devouring the entire plate of the chopsuey as it had generous serving of pork meat and pork fat which I adore! A good dining experience in a city with more Chinese/Indo-Chinese restaurants than perhaps anywhere in India!

Been visiting this restaurant for a close 10 to 15 years and trust me what brings me to this restaurant is the food which is definetly very delicious and price is pretty balanced over the years maintaining the quantity and quality also . These are all the good points but now let me highlight the problems quite often faced or seen that is firstly the lady who owns along with her husband gets pretty loud and stern with her customers during orders and also I have observed barely a person is done or Still eating ,the table is quickly cleared giving the customer a sign of no table manners , then the washroom also is never maintained hence its a mixed feeling whenever I visit this restaurant .

Visiting this restaurant from last 10-15years with family! Recently visited 4-5 times with friends!
During childhood this was the place for lunch after shopping!

They serve authentic (taste wise) Chinese food! Really really yummy! The food quality is OK types! But really tasty with enough quanlity! Recently they hav increased the price a bit! But is cheap compared to today's Chinese restaurants!
Ambience is OK!
Service is good!

Love it overall!! But don't get time to visit nowadays!

If you are true Chinese cuisine lover and you dont judge the food quality by the looks of the restaurant where it is served, this is the best possible Chinese food you can ever have in Kolkata. Period. I am not exaggerating any bit. The noodles is full of crunchy veggies and non veg ingredients and so is the fried rice. Chopsuey is lip smacking good which will be there in your taste buds till you have them again. It is an ultimate soul food where the pour down all ingredients from veggies to seafood in plenty. You can also try their roast pork which amazing too. I can go on writing about this place endlessly. Just drop your guard about your fine dinning expectations, if you are a passionate lover of good food just go and try out this place. Coz it will never even pinch or make a difference to your pocket as well.

Discovered this place few days back and thought to give it a try. It is located at the new market area just beside the KMC. OK, we went here on Saturday noon. Nothing about the decor with few seating arrangements. Let me tell you, we went here around 2:30 and we came out at 2:55, by this you can figure out how fast was the service. There was a lady who was running the place. She was everywhere, taking orders, cleaning tables, serving food everything.. She was like a bullet train. As it was Saturday, we ordered veg meifoon and veg Manchurian but she told that meifoon is not available today, so we ordered veg Hakka noodles instead. The chow was good with lots of stir fried crunchy vegetables. The Manchurian was really good, it was crispy fried and the gravy was also light. And another thing, this place is really cheap to gobble on some authentic Chinese food.. Give it a try..

When i entered this place based on the directions given by my fellow zomato users i had an awesome feeling about the place. A quaint family run restaurant, very simple decor with chinese lanterns. I thought that today ill b discovering a place deserving, but lacking, attention. I WAS SO WRONG.
The owner of the place is terribly rude and loud mouthed. She will stand at your table after handing you the menu card and will show strong displeasure if you do not order in under a minute.
Guys, skip this joint, definitely not worth it. And the food was very commonplace. NOTHING AT ALL SPECIAL. THE SAUCES TASTE A LITTLE BETTER THAN OTHER PLACES OF THIS STANDARD. BUT THAT'S ALL,
P.S. If u do decide on going, plz wrap ur self esteem in an iron sheet coz it has every chance of feeling insulted.Â

A quaint little restaurant , may be a dining hall meant for office goers and students who are on pocket money budget .  A family run outlet    With a minimum decor or no decor . The food has nothing to boast about , just about palatable, not much to boast..... Grab a bite forget it and why on earth will u eat Chinese cuisine when u r spoilt for choices of Mughlai food at that area .

Only one thing I wanna share,if u don't like pork, n going for mix things den tell dem not to include pork in d mix cause if u don't dey will give u a mix chow or rice with pork chicken n prawn. Please be careful about this. Otherwise its a awesome place. A must visit in this festive season ;)

Its simply amazing when you find restaurants that you adore. All this while I have been trying to track this. But nonetheless I found it at last. New market for me means hogging on chinese at china town. No one precisely knows this place as it is situated at a dingy corner of new market just opposite society cinema. Once you reach the place you might find it better to drop the idea of having food as sanitation issues may pop up. But if you keep it aside . China town provides the best of authentic chinese. The sauces, the smell and the taste will definitely drive you crazy. As for starters you can go in for the chicken wantons. Or simply the chicken mushroom soup or the pepper chicked. The mixed gravy noodles or just the hakka noodles. Amazing. The chilli fish dry is commendable. The roast chilli pork dry is worth giving a try. The garlic chicken is amazing.  I mean I just cannot stop savouring thd taste of all the dishes that they prepare  the owner is amicable and cordial. Hw will suggest you. But I guess I have been there innumerable times, so my suggestions would be enough to appease your appetite.

A great restaurant that is very difficult to find (literally).

Though they get a very few customers, they are great people.

The food is fantastic directly from the people of China.

The lady is too nice ( although I don't find how people get her to be called "ARROGANT" as it is a very negative comment for so polite people like them. )

They way the lady talks is a bit tough but the words she says are very polite and soft.

For those people who have no taste buds , there is no place here as the food is just as if directly  from China. Its ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS FOOD!

I recommend people to try to understand people not just comment by there ways of speaking as she ( The Humble Lady ) talks just the way Chinese people do. Perhaps not all Chinese can be called arrogant by their speaking habits!

I must say being a Japanese.

I love China Town just as I love Sushi.

The not so very popular chineese outlet in the city. Bt yes it has its own corner. Located at a shabby lane in new market, it is almost like a diner more than a restraurant. The owner is also chinese and a little impatient. On the other hand its a good sign that the service is quick too, but people like me like to enjoy the food slow rather than an eating competition. A more soft srrvice would be nyc fr the owner. Apart frm that the food is good and its all chinese menu. U get a satisfactory chinese meal fr a satisfactory pocket pinch. :)

The place is located in a very shabby lane behind New Market. But the interior has a typical chinese flavor. The owner and the waiters are all from the land of Chengis Khan as well. But it was very regretful that the owner lady was arrogant and showed so much disgust towards the customers, I wonder why!!! the waiters would force you to order fast , eat your food fast, pay your bill fastcand if you dont they too shows their disgust!! Coming to the main part-- FOOD: it was an average rated chinese food. Not bad but not very good as well. Quantity wise the amount was generous and so was the cost. But then frankly speaking, we could'nt enjoy the food that much because of so much 'disgust-full stares' around.
