It might look like a not so classy restaurant but if you are a glutton then this is your place! Putting down lavish foods at an accessible cost make this resturant variant! It's food quality and quantity both are worthy of remark,but staff's service is quite sluggish! Ambiance and equipment is very ordinary! Nevertheless must visit to have squaremeal at a pocket friendly price!

I had ordered their Paneer Sada Dosa. It didn't taste amazing. Filling was little. Price isn't too high. But taste isn't too good.

Not too happy. Had heard quite a bit about this place.

The restaurant with the worst service I have ever been to. Took them nearly more than 45 min to bring the food which I ordered. And the food nothing great either. Ordered Chinese Thali... no salt in chilli chicken neither on Chicken Lollipop. Nothing more to say. Never going again there.

Located beside Pathfinder, this is a good place to have North Indian food. They have good seating arrangements but they take some time to prepare the food items. I went there with family and had Biryani, Chicken malai kebab (gravy wala kebabs), butter naan. Firstly, the Biryani is below average, it doesn't look and taste like Biryani at all. No one should order this. But I found the chicken items and Naan to be quite delicious and quantity was also good. Previously I tried Kulcha and aloo paratha too, they were also up to the mark.

I had been to Kasba for a work and in the early evening hours felt like having a light snack. However, somehow I end up in restaurant.

I was accompanied by a colleague of mine and we ordered for Chicken Chaap along with Plain Roti as well as Tandoori Roti.

Since, it was a bit odd time, we confirmed multiple times if they could prepare it soon and they blankly nodded. The AC wasnt working and the tables were not properly cleaned which made us irritated. However, the real irritating creeped in due to the wait as the food arrived after half an hour or so.

The Chicken Chaap and Tandoori Roti was good. The Plain Naan was not so delightful.

It is an average visit.

Visited there on saptami evening. Had few recommendations for this place. The place is pretty and clean. The service is the worst over here. Ordered biriyani and chineese both. Both tasted equally bad. The service was awful. They got wrong orders 3-4 times. But the restro is a new one so let’s see what happens after 3-4 months :)

I have ordered from this place quiet a lot number of time and love their Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Hariyali Kebab. The Biriyani is also good in taste.
The quantity is also good.
Their staff's are nightmares! In short this place serves GOOD FOOD but the BEHAVIOR OF THE STAFF's are worse,reason I have ordering from this place as not only once but they have behaved badly repeatedly.

So after reading a lot of negative comments, finally got to visit this place yesterday. The interior decor makes you feel like you've entered some posh restaurant. The menu card shocked me. The price was so so reasonable. Ordered lemon iced tea in the beginning which was okayish. Then for the main course we had veg rice and shezwan chicken. The rice was well cooked and there was sufficient amount. The chicken had the right amount of spices and was soft. At last we ordered chocolate icecream, which I really liked. Contended with the food. The only  drawback is that there are flies all around. Sitting on the freshly served food. They should do something about it.

It's a newly opened restaurant. Occupied huge space but no customer was around expect an oldschool group. Like we accidentally trespassed into someone's property. Stuffs had no welcoming manner, no courtesy. They're not even cordial. It took 45 minutes to serve veg polau and tandoori chicken butter masala. The other group was also complaining about the delay. We gave a shout too but the stuffs handled casually like they're used to it. 
Zomato misguided this time. They do conclude tax.
In the lunchtime, there were no combos available, not even biryani. Such a disgrace!
Tandoori butter masala has distinct taste, polau quantity Will not even suffice one single person. 
Not going back there again.

So like the picture says, I entered with a friend to have that Chinese combo. The waiter said it can't be shared because the quantity is less. So while eating my friend had exactly two spoons of fried rice from me. The waiter said we have to pay 60 bucks extra for that and we have to order something because that was restaurant policy. So i said he could just show it as a fine on my bill, he didn't and added that green apple soda. There was black dirty stuff in it. 

I would request people not to visit these cheats ever. Raise awareness and save money. Ostracize these asses.

Well, there's enough good deals available in the 'Little/Tapzo' app...
I purchased coupons for Biryani @ 89 which was after 44% discount...
In the evening I went there to redeem them and the overall good quality deserved 4.19 (approx)
If I compare it with the ones available​ nearby (Classic/Tufani)...then, this Biryani's Rice quality was far better with it's taste also good enough..., the meat quality (Mutton) was also far better than the street's one and the taste was less...as it lacked flavors...it had very mild taste of spices which is not expected as we are in India not England and we love spices so the Mutton in the street's Biryani shop is better in terms of taste only but not the quality...same was the potatoe...
Now, the overall quantity was also good enough at the price of 89 only in a restaurant...
The service was also good enough... Not much ambience...

I Like this place, satisfied with their services.

To be honest, my experience with Raj's Multicuisine is more than what I really expected. Good quality food with a Christmas-like ambience long after 25th and a warm hospitality - this is how my last night dinner with my family went.
