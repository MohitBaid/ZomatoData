4.5
So.. Today in middle of rain. We all decided let's get food from outside and thanks to Zomato app. Going out for food is a thing of past. Now, here in Baranagar area not all restaurants on Zomato provide home delivery service and I wanted to try some new place this time as well. So Even after seeing a overall rating of 2.3. I took a risk of placing my first order at Bhaipo's food court. Order was placed & acknowledged in no time and delivered at my place within the agreed time. Now let's talk about food. We ordered 3 curry items, 7 laccha paratha and one Veg Biryani. Food was warm and nicely packed. With first bite it was clear that such food  quality (price is pocket friendly too) doesn't deserve 2 rating. So I am going with 4.5 and the reason why I didn't give 5 because they only have lachha paratha in bread category. I think they should extend this category with  tawa & rumali roti at least. Highly recommended!üëç
