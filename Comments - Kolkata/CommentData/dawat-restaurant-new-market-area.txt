V.much overpriced. And the food is not upto any mark. We ordered STEAMED RICE, TOMATO VARTA, RUI FISH and CHICKEN.
The rice was good. It was fresh and prepared nicely. Sufficient for 1.
The TOMATO VARTA was nice. The RUI fish costs 90 bucks for 1 piece but was so dry and was so fried. And it was not fresh.
Even the CHICKEN preparation was not even good. Shreded pieces of chicken with half piece of boiled egg served with gravy. The gravy was tasteless. And again overpriced.
The reataurant was even not that clean. It was divided into 2 parts(A.C and NON A.C). All in one didn't liked at all. Such a busiest restaurant and with such degraded food! Need to improve a lot!

The restaurant is tucked up in a nondescript corner of the new market. The market which is always crowded not the restaurant presumably die to hygienic issues. The biryani is good but never go for the Chinese here. The name explains why. Better of you visit after evening. There service and ambience is below par but the food more than makes up for it. Again, stick to the moglai cuisine and drop in if you are at the esplanade. Regular with the tourists visiting the city and its known more for people getting takeaways tham dining in. Try their kebabs which are oilier than usual but tasty anyway. Smell in the smell its the one that reminds you of what's wrong with the city. Bon appetit.

First time I have explored the busiest restaurant in Kolkata which is crowed with Bangladeshi guests. The restrao is not very neat and clean, not well decorated but this joint is very popular to Bangladeshi guests. They have 2 different sections, one is with A.C and another one is without. They have two different manu cards, English menu and Bangla menu. You have to ask which menu you would like to see. They have huge options of Bangladeshi items followed by Mughlai and Chinese. We ordered Chinese Dawat special mix noodles along and chilli garlic chicken. Both the items tastes ok type, nothing impressive. But if you are looking for some rare Bengali items, please visit this joint.

Place is located in marquees Street. This restaurant is not  so popular but makes really nice Chinese foods. I often give a visit here for evening snacks. Ambience is not so great but okay. As it is in high demand for home delivery it service is not quick. We had chicken hakka noodles, chicken lollipop and Golden chicken dragon rolls . The best part chicken hakka noodles is actually you get chicken in it. Most of restaurant serves little bit of chicken in the name of chicken hakka noodles but here you will not be disappointed. Chicken lollypop was great in taste and dragon rolls also..

Egged on by the taste of a spoonful of biryani I had from a plastic box with the Dawat stamp on it, we decided to give it a try. Called them but they expressed their inability to deliver... so a neighbour and I made our way to Maquis St.

After a difficult parking experience, we walked into The place did not look too promising, and nor was the order-taking particularly efficient. The person manning the counter bent over and barked out the order which we could hear being relayed on the loudspeaker at the kitchen. The restaurant has regular as well as air-conditioned seating. They were quick to prepare the order and we got back home.

The biryanis were not close to what I had tasted from the box previously. These were in card boxes, and tasted almost homemade-like. The rice was very soft. The mutton pieces were small (at least mine was soft but it seemed almost artificial somehow). The Chicken Kassa (chaap was over) was quite insipid... overcooked chicken in a badly done white gravy!!! My neighbour was complaining his Mutton Kassa had almost no meat in it. They did not like the biryani either.

The phirni though was pretty nice. Smooth and not too sweet.

Prices here were somewhat less than the standard biryani joints.

I have been here just once. The restaurant is really pocket friendly and it is far away from the din of the new market area. There is nothing much to brag about the restaurant except that its cheap.

We had CHICKEN MOMO STEAM, CHICKEN PAKODA, EGG FRIED RICE, CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES, CHICKEN MANCHURIAN and DEVIL CHICKEN. The servings have wholesome quantity. Four of my friends were full and I even ordered a takeaway.

It is a good place to treat your friends once in a while.
