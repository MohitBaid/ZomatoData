Fried Calamari is to die for. Awesome offers going on in the restaurant - one plus one free. Superb ambiance and fantastic service. Truly international standard.

My experience was very bad. I had checked up the menu before coming and I knew it's limited for vegetarians. But dint expect you people to even deny the few items are there by saying that its not available. At least I won't be coming here again.

My experience was not so good . I ate nachos which was amazing .  Drinks was nice such as cold coffee and a chocolate drink . The menu has a large variety but when we order they say that this is not available . Most of the items is not available .

A normal shop but the food quality is good. Its better to take away or home delivery as there is no proper sitting arrangement. But the food is fine. Specially the momos and the pan fried momos are delecious.

I am a regular visitor of this place. First and foremost pls rectify that there is no Dine-In facility here. If you want a take away its best, if not, you have to sit on an ugly stool in the road, risking you life and eat with you life in your hand.
Considering their north-eastern chefs we generally ordered chinese or Momos. Now the momos here are cheap and good to taste, and the clear soup they serve with it is indeed commendable, I have never had better, but they have a strange texture of this red sauce, I not quite fond of. We had some noodles and side dish once and that too was more or less nice. I feel the rolls are also good in their menus because have seen a lot of people ordering that, but have never tried. 
Their USP is the good taste at the lowest price possible. But if you are looking for hygienic standards, you are in the wrong place.
