Maniktalla has been very close to my heart as my i have been visiting  this place from my childhood. 
Formerly this sweet shop was located somewhere else and now they have changed the location and made it a little bigger and better. Very near to Chalta Bagan crossing this place is doing well for the past 6 years here.
Yesterday i was passing by this place so thought of having something of them too. So tried their Khir Kadam and Kalakand. Both of them just wow. Fresh and tasty as well as the prices are so cheap. Loved it.

This is a good sweet shop, but will fall a little short by North Calcutta standard. Almost all the sweets are good. They have few stools inside the shop where you can sit while enjoying the food. 

They used to make really good kulfis, but now the standards have fallen. It is not that creamy and too icy now. 

The best point here is their price. You will still find most items below 10 bucks here. 

One huge negative I saw here is they pick the sweets with their hands while serving. When today even the small shops use tongs, what they are doing is really unacceptable.
