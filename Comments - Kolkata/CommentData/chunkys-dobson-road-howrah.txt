It was a home delivery. I had ordered an American cheesy burger. And a brownie with ice-cream. 
To be honest the burger was really good and cheesy but the brownie was not up-to the mark.

Usually go there on a weekly basis for hangouts, not that big its quite a small cafe located in watkis lane. I normally order sandwiches and pastas which i personally think are the only two dishes that will satisfy you for d payment. Must mention dont ever try d oreo shake ever...very pathetic...for the cost its a cheap cafe and fooding is quiet normal not that superdooper!  Ambience is also very simple, will suggest go here only if you have a low budget otherwise dont!

Ordered a pizza and Pasta from swiggy. Food packaging was bad and the pasta was good 4.5 out of 5 and came in a normal container but I had stomach problems after I ate the pizza. Pizza taste was very bad and I complained it to swiggy guys they don't use fresh stuff refrain from eating here

The place is a little small for holding parties and all but quality of food served surpasses the space problem..!
The only drawback of the cafe is that it takes a lot of prep time for the food..!! 
Maybe that's why the food tastes so great ..!‚ù£Ô∏è

I heard of this cafe from a friend... she suggested me to visit ehile I was in howrah... I must say it was one of my worst experiences in Kolkata so far... The cashier or manager whosoever he was, should learn some manners and etiquettes of handling customer... We ordered Nachos Bhel, which they say is their signature dish, was just pathetic... Thank god the quantity was less otherwise it would have been a dare for me n my cousin to finish it off. Also we ordered a Brownie Shake and a Ferrero Rocher Shake... The brownie shake was okay but the ferrero shake was the worst I ve ever had. It was some fake rocher he had used. It wasn't crispy n in the end i got the chocolate ball, seeing which I was a lil happy, but it tasted bad since there was no hazel nut in the chocolate centre.
I think the management should definitely pay attention...

Home delivery and food quality equally sucks... I ordered a chunky special pizza for home delivery.. And to my utter surprise the delivery boy doesn't know the location and is standing about half a kilometer away from my location. Repeated guiding over the phone also failed to address the issue of his stupidity. 
By the time I reached the delivery boy (Yes I had to locate him) and took my order, it was cold... Tasted stale and so I felt a waste of my ‚Çπ300 and time. 

If you don't have experienced or local delivery boys, kindly discontinue the home delivery service. And for the food... I am never ordering from you guys again.

We I visited the place ac was not working at all it was too hot to have a meal üòÖüòÖ pasta was really fantastic it was mouth watering üòòüòò cheese sandwich was awesome overall a nice cafe food and decor h impressive. It is a small get together or hangout place don't have enough capacity to occupy persons. When I have paid the visit some repairing or furniture work was going on hope they have completed that. I just hope ac is now working. If you love tasty food you must go üôÉüôÇ but eating without ac and fan in this weather makes tasty food tasteless.

This was my ist order in chunkeys. It was a disaster. Food quality pathetic. I ordered a chunky's spcl pizza with extra cheese . The order was suppposed to be delivered by 9:04 and it came at 9:30. The service was 0. The person concerned called me 4 times to confirm the same thing. They charged packing charges but failed to provide the service, the pizza was half broken when received as well as under cooked. It was a waste of money and time both.

Location-Dobson road,Howrah.

We haven't visited this place but ordered food at home from here.We really appreciated their service and were astonished by the food quality they serve at such pocket friendly prices.

Service-The service was very fast and reliable.We got our food delivered with proper packaging in approx 35 minutes.

Food-The price bracket at which they are serving such quality food is commendable.We have tried quite a few dishes and what we liked the most are-
1:Pasta in mixed sauce
2:Mexican wave
3:Garlic bread with cheese

Service-4/5
Food-4/5

Looking forward to visit this place soon.üòÉüòÉ

It's a small outlet which tries to specialize in pastas, Its basically an eatout place rather than being a cafe. It has limited menu and limited seats. Pasta had less vegetables but delightful mixed sauce, they were happily ready to change when i complained about the vegetables saying many people prefer less vegetables in this area. Will revisit soon to try other things.
Suggestions: Pls improve the platting and serve breads with pasta , common everyone serves it

I was thinking to write this review from a long time and here it is! First of all the place is superb wheather it be the ambience or the food. You cannot find a better place to eat fresh italian food that could make you crave for it, atleast in Howrah! Wonderful location, service was tentative and knowledgeable. Staffs and the Owner himself is really friendly! The pasta was fresh and the sauces loaded with flavor! Burgers are really good. Pizzas, specially The Chunky's Cheeza is like the best pizza overloaded cheese and fresh toppings! Desserts just make you gocrazy as they have a variety of the desserts which no one have heard of! And the special thing which I personally liked was that all the dishes in the menu are inventions of the owner, Siddhart Jain. I specialy recommend you to go and try the dishes!

Chunky‚Äôs is on Watkins lane very close to the Howrah AC Market. The place was recently opened focusing on the Italian cuisines including Burgers and Sandwiches. The place has a typical caf√© like ambiance. The outlet also has upstairs seating. The outlet has a few combo offers to try from.

¬†We ordered a combo which included a portion of Mixed Sauce Pasta, a portion of Cheese Garlic Bread and a Mocha Frappe. The Mixed Sauce Pasta was delicious with the tangy tomato sauce and the cheesy white sauce. The Pasta has a number of exotic vegetables, amazing! But the quantity was really low! The Cheese Garlic Bread was great as well and was different than other places. The Mocha Frappe wasn‚Äôt upto the mark and was more a chocolate drink. We than had the Veggie Overdose. The pizza was good again with a lot of cheesy goodness. 

The outlet doesn‚Äôt have exhaust fans which makes it impossible to breath in any kind of smoke. Also the service is so so and needs improvement.

The Verdict:-
Food/Taste ‚Äì 7/10
Service ‚Äì 6/10
Value for Money ‚Äì 7/10
Ambiance ‚Äì 6/10
Quantity/Quality ‚Äì 6/10

Good Italian food but service needs improvement. Items need to be large in portions.

Been there a Couple of times.Would Say one of the best places in town serving authentic Italian Food!!
Seating area is properly organised with much space,furniture innovative nd equally comfortable,music mellifluous and ambience elegant.
Coming to the food,the food is exotic and garnished with perfection. Nachos Bhel is something totally new which I found delicious as well as much rich in taste,the mexican Burger had also been a delight to have.
To sum up,an overall delightful experience.

My Ratings:
Food:4.5/5
Ambience:4/5
Service:4.5/5
Value for Money:5/5
Overall:4.5/5
P.S-This cafe has the potential to go all the way..Keep up the good work mates :)

Chunky's ¬†- a door to happiness! The best place to hang out with friends and family <3
I have been dining here since it is open and I must say it's quite a positive experience eating here. Those looking for a culinary experience in howrah, trust me, there is no better place than this! Not many restaurants or cafes here serve you "good" Italian, but this place, it certainly does! Coming to the interior, oh my god! Just as you enter this place you'll forget that you are in howrah! The decor allows the simplistic beauty of food to really shine! The doodling part <3 I love pasta in mixed sauce, nachos bhel and american burger! One would really regret missing it! "Death by chocolate" would drive you crazy! Its perfect for chocolate lovers like me <3 The price is worth the food we eat! Rating 5 is perfect for chunky's!¬†
I would love to come here time and again! In genuine love with this place!
Food - check!
Ambiance- check!
Hygiene - check!
Music- check!
Service- check!
Price- check!

Best place at the locality. Incredible ambience. Delicious Food. Quick Service. Ample Items. And the best thing is they provide board games so you can have a gala time with your frnds. If you visit 1's then you will automatically visit regularly.

There‚Äôs a certain joy you find when you walk into something classy in Howrah, and joy was found when I visited Chunky‚Äôs. Situated behind Howrah AC Market, this caf√© is not only easy to find, but is also something to relish. Let me start by saying that the ambience and interiors here is not something ordinary, especially for the city we are in. Simple, yet sophisticated. Now coming to the food ‚Äì I think I can go on and on and on about how great the food is and how everyone needs to try out everything that is listed on the menu. That‚Äôs what I tried to do ‚Äì ordered a large variety of things till the time we could move no more. Everything from the Nacho Bhel to the Pasta to the chocolate sandwich to the burger was simply amazing. The owner was quite friendly and helped us choose the best from all that they had to offer. Looking forward to visiting it again!

I visited Chunky's on the 23rd of December,2014.As we entered,we were greeted by the Owner and seated on a sofa cum chair.The ambience is soothing,music euphonious,interiors exquisite and the furniture quite modern and ¬†innovative as well.

¬†Coming to the food,i would say that it is very difficult to find luscious pasta outlets in Howrah but this food outlet has made it possible.I had had the mixed sauce pasta which should be tried at least once.The Nachos bhel is a must try(appears to be an invention of this outlet).You can also try Spaghetti but try it in sauces other than white sauce.Even sandwiches are ¬†lip-smacking over here with olives and tomato sandwich worth a try.
Coming to the service,i would say that the service is fast.There should be an availability of regular water either in jugs,filled glasses or like the drinking water machines(as in Dominos',etc.) as other outlets,cafes,etc. ¬†do keep regular drinking water.
My ratings are:
Food-3.5/5
Service-4/5
Ambience-3.5/5
Value for money-4/5
Overall-4/5
