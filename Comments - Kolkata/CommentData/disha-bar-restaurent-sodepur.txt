Disha has always been a favorite with its disha special Biriyani. But honestly the last day was very disappointing. The food served was stale and mutton and chicken pieces were totally hard and cold. Severely dissappointed yet will visit again with better hopes :p

Go to the hell but don't go to the Disha Bar and Restaurant. Generally I don't make reviews on restaurants even if the restaurant is below average but it is unbelievable restaurant. Sick.

Horrible ambience, Unhygienic environment, Congested space, Tasteless dishes,Pathetic service,Ignoring attitude and a good quality paper bill including 28% GST make this restaurant an exceptional restaurant.

The food here is not that great but the fact is that the food is cheaper than most other restaurants. The bar and the offshop is very famous in this locality. Among the food menu the kashmiri pulao is a good one and the rest of the menu is very cliche and not praiseworthy.

A very ordinary restaurant.. We have tried Biriyani,polao,mutton..  food quality was not good.  chinese foods like schezwan rice, chilli chicken  are comparatively better. Ambience is okay. Pocket friendly price..

Today we visited to Disha Bar and restaurant. It is the worst restaurent i had ever visited. We ordered pink woman and i want you in mocktail which was not at all good. Then for starters we ordered mahi kurkure which was comparatively good. Now the worst part was the main course. We ordered nawabi pulao and mutton rogan josh. Both were equally bad. The taste of pulao was so bad that I cant even explain. The mutton was very chewy and smelly. If there is a option where I can give 0 I would have opt that for sure. The staffs are also very rude.

We ordered Pink Woman and I Want You in mocktails. It was so bad in taste!! In starter we ordered Ghungru Fish which was really good. Now coming to the main course. We ordered Nawabi Pulao and Mutton Roghan Josh... O MY GOOOOOOD!!!!! Simply felt like vomiting!! I had never tasted something so bad in my life ever. If there had been any option where I could opt for 0 rating, I would have given that for sure. The waiters were also very rude. And on top of this there were so many sweet mosquitoes to accompany us!! Better starve than visitig this restaurant!!
