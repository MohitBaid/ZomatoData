Anamika is located in 39 Bustand, Picnic Garden. The food is average; quality and quantity both are not up to the mark.  Seating arrangements are available for around a dozen of people. Not a very hygienic place though. We had ordered for rolls from here; the food was okayish but was not very bad either. Biryanis' are very highly priced and is not worth the price. Extremely dry biryani and pretty dull too. A good place when in search of food in the locality as they are open throughout with no break for lunch and till late night.

An average experience. 
Their food is quiet rich, and ambiance is not so noteworthy, just a roadside small dhaba type.
Ambiance: 5/10 (Noisy and hot)

Â»Orders(Did a takeaway)
âœ©Chicken Butter Masala(7/10): 4 pieces, average sized, for Rs 200! Kind of rich. Tastes decent, a bit on the sweeter side. Not suitable with the price. Chicken was well cooked

â˜…Paneer Dopiaja[they named it](5/10): 6 pieces, extremely oily ,size is nice, for Rs 150 isn't worthy either. Tastes decent. The gravy  here is better than the chicken butter masala. Do try to separate the oil, use it for your home cooking, you'll get the extra flavor. But without the oil, the gravy will be less by 1/4th of total.

âœ©Rumali Roti(7/10):  Slightly thicker than usual, so you can call it towel roti or chador(bedsheet) roti ðŸ˜‚. Smaller as well.

They put lot of oil in the food & I got one chicken masala , the chicken was not properly cooked & it was kinda raw , waste of money..But other restaurants like krishh , Flamez , Joey's kitchen & red bamboo is better than this.

Bad experience. The food was smelling horrible. When we called the owner and complained he slammed the phone down. Horrible service. Don't buy from here unless you're desperate or you have money to waste.

Anamika fast food located in 39 bus stand area in Picnic garden and just opposite to Nag sweets you can spot it ,as its the only restaurant there catering to Indian meals as well as Chinese whether its noon or night Anamika fast food is available but based on my experience i wouldn't visit this place again still my review is below .

My order -
Chicken Biryani ,Paneer curry and jeera rice .

My experience & verdict -

AMBIANCE

Nothing great just a regular fast food center with provision of just two to three tables inside although fans are there with clean tables and salt pepper placed in every tables .

HOSPITALITY AND FOOD

Not at all good as the food that we ordered we waited for 40 mins that too without other customers order or I would say in pressure hours.
Basically I observed that they take their own sweet time after the order , slowly the paneer comes out from the fridge goes to the cook then they search for masala maybe as I assume takes another moment of time and then making it also takes some more time and then rice is also made in the same amount of time in such a slousy way , and talking about taste well the paneer curry tasted nice after so much of torture and wait but the jeera rice was not so nice however eatable but finally the Biryani which is made ready in handis was greasy and not at all tasty just filled in a box jetting out some rice and grease oil giving me a serious check whether to come here ever again after this experience .

Had their biryanis. The mutton biryani is really good. Soft and juicy mutton and butter soft potatoes are a rarity at a roadside joint. They also give an egg with the mutton biryani which makes it a really good value for money. However with their chicken biryani no egg is provided though it's also really good.

Testy food at a cheap rate. At night when I want something to eat I go for this restaurant. There are seating arrangements also. At night when you can't go anywhere you can go to this restaurant. .
