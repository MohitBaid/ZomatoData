Nice food ,nice ambience is all that makes a good place for eating out..and you can get both here. Not that much costly you can binge into here when you are near vivekananda park area and your urge for chinese rises.

A very good place for chinese freak people like me, with nice ‡¶õ‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶õ‡¶æ‡¶Æ  interior decoration and cosy ambience, inspite of it's location quite away from the normal hustle n bustle of ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶Æ‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶≤‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ ..
Well, We have visited for a lazy lunch on puja days and ordered for 
Mongolian chicken & crispy honey chicken as starter!
For main course we took veg fried rice , Tai chi chicken, chicken in hoisine sauce and  Beijing treasures! -Dishes were soooo delicious and of good quantity (each dish is good enogh for 2 ).Though they are best known for their indo chinese food but as per my taste buds, they serve a good quality chinese food at reasonable price! üòä

HIGHLIGHTS: 
1) No extra Tax! All are inclusive in the menu itself. 
You'll be so happy seeing the bill what you have assumed to be. üòÇ

2) One more and not to forget wala part is 
they won't ask you to leave even when if you already have paid your bill and don't make any further order!
(I loved it).

3) The staffs are so helpful about choosing food and also very cordial , or you can say friendly too.. They just don't leave you alone! üòÅüòÇ
One or two of them will be always there for any enquiries or order or anything! 

Service is also good. 
5/5!

Calm and composed place, situated right behind Vivekananda Park, this restaurant has some speciality dishes. The egg wrapped mixed fried rice, hupak chicken and chicken cheese balls are a must try for any food lovers.
Service level is also good.
Value for money.

Fantastic food. As one of the best Chinese food of Kolkata, I will recommend everybody. Visited this place for 4 to 5 time. Though the price is a little bit high but the taste attracts me as magnet. Chicken lemon coriander soup and chicken satay ¬†tastes alike Asia Kitchen(Mainland China). Their Chili Crab is also my favourite. Good Ambience and staffs' behaviour are plus point.

Our visit here for a Lazy Dinner night was quite nice. The restaurant is located in a quite lane away from the usual hustle bustle but was reasonably full. Staff was active and pleasant.¬†
Though I wouldn't call it the most authentic in terms of taste but its quite nice the way it is and the portion size is also good.

Although Kolkata is already stocked with numerous Chinese eateries all over, still our quest for new Chinese joints serving decent enough Indo-Chinese dishes takes us to places like China Calling.. Yet another budget Chinese restaurant in the up-market location of Southern Avenue in one of the alleys adjacent to Vivekananda Park.. It‚Äôs futile to search for anything unique or distinctive in a place like this but the food will surely satiate your hunger while the flavors are good enough to leave a lasting impression.. The place comprises two separate rooms with cozy, extensive sofas, stereotypical d√©cor to go with the theme and the name of the place.. Dimly lit crimson interiors, decorative mirrors and wall-hangings will welcome you for a comfortable family meal.. Service was fast and servers were no doubt courteous enough to satisfy your needs.. Coming to food:
Pepper Chilli Prawn: Tiger prawns saut√©ed with pepper, chilies, capsicums and spring onions in a fiery hot sauce base.. Loved the punch and the presence of pepper flakes adding to the flavors..
Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice: Extremely hot and spiced up.. A strict no for the faint-hearted or the ones not used to ample chilies and pungent flavors.. Portion was huge even for twin-sharing..
Chicken Thau Su: Chicken cooked in soy based gravy with generous presence of veggies like capsicums and carrots.. The sauce was mildly spiced and actually balanced the heat of the fried rice..
One thing I would like to mention that they only serve packaged drinking water being charged at mrp only, which still may be a negative for many diners.. Overall our total cheque was Rs. 950/- (all incl.) and their VAT and Service Charges are inclusive in the listed prices.. Overall prices may seem a bit on the higher side given the nature of the establishment but the portions kind of trade of the price..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Located in a small lane near Vivekananda park. It's a decent sized restaurant for a superb Chinese food.. They have started Indian but dint tried it as of now.. 

Thumbs ups : I think everything. It's a cozy place , food is simply great.

Thumbs down : they should start liquor as the starters will go well with drinks.

In Kolkata there are Chinese restaurants in every nook  & corner but what makes a restaurant stand out is good quality and tasty food in reasonable price. This place is exactly that kind. China Calling is a quiet, cozy, nicely decorated Chinese restaurant situated near Kamala Girls' School. Staffs are attentive and helpful. They offer tasty food in very decent price range. No compromise with quality & quantity. A plate of rice or noodles is good for 2 people. A good place for good Chinese food.

Been to this place for a quick grab 
With few of my friends. 
Located just opposite to the vivekanda park. Well, for some it might be difficult to locate it at first. 

The ambiance and decorations were pretty simple yet comfortable enough  with dim lights. 

We ordered for,
Fresh lime soda
Chicken Hakka noodles
Drums of heaven 
Chicken dim sum 
Chilli pork 

Well, won't say the food was extraordinary 
It was pretty much average. 
The service was fast no doubt in that.

China calling is located just opposite Vivekananda park in the Southern Avenue.
It is a small food joint which serves some good and affordable Chinese dishes.
We ordered the Dragon chicken as a starter. There chicken was wrapped in fried rice noodles and was quite spicy.
In the main course we ordered a Tai chi chicken which was good as well. 
The portions of both the rice and the chicken dishes served  was good. The place is affordable and is great for Chinese food lovers. :)

After much dilemma and searching through zomato for a good Chinese restaurant for a whole day me and my friend decided to visit this place on saraswati puja this year.
It is located just beside Vivekananda park in the lane just before Kamala Girls School. Very easy to locate this outlet. The outer decor is good and appealing and the name is perfectly justified with the decorations. It is a medium sized restaurant with 35-40 seating arrangements and it is divided into two sections with both the sections visible from one another.
The inner decorations are very good with the hanging lights and the wall decors. The dim light suits the environment and the light background music adds to the soothing atmosphere.
The staffs are extremely courteous and will serve you the food.
Coming to the food-we ordered the following:-
1) Starter: Chicken Satay - Long pieces of chicken fried beautifully and served with an excellent sauce. It is well garnished and will satisfy your taste buds
2)Rice: Mixed Fried Rice - Was very nice in taste and upto the mark
3)Main dish: Chicken in Hoisin Sauce - excellent dish with the sauce quite good in taste. One of my favourite dishes.
4) Desert: Chocolate Brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce- excellent in taste and was very good to finish our meal
Ratings:
Decor-4/5
Service-4.5/5
Food-4.5/5
P.s- No extra taxes. Worth going again.

At the outset, I must mention that the restaurant is owned by a dear friend's family. Hence, one must overlook any and all signs of partiality that might be reflected in my review.

Considering the location, which is a bit off the main road, I've seen transport to and from being an issue, unless one uses app based cabs. That being said, the d√©cor is almost spartan, perhaps aiming for the singular simpleness that defines Chinese aesthetics. The staff is more or less polite, if a tad overbearing at times. 

The menu, if I may be honest, is ambitious. It has packed in a lot of really wonderful items and it doesn't do the restaurant justice if you expect the Chinese here to taste like the Chinese Indians are used to. Chinese cuisine is supposed to be a bit bland, unless one factors in Kungpao or Schezuan. So if you read reviews on that count, you'll be misled.

My favourites include the pork ribs and any of their prawn items. I'm also a big fan of the imported soda they serve for drinks. The service time is satisfactory, as are the portions and price-point.

To be honest, restaurants are a competitive field, and China Calling is as good as the next one. But if you're in Southern Avenue, and if you need some space and peace without spending a hell lot of money, do give it a try. It doesn't disappoint on most counts.

Visited this place twice. What surprises me is the fall in quality.
 The first time it was lovely. Everything except the pork was delicious. The pork was a little stiff and lower on the meat portion. We stuck to only starters in our first visit and it was thoroughly impressive. The crispy honey chicken and fish in Peking style is must have here. The konjee crispy lamb and chili pork was not up to the level of the earlier dishes.

The second visit was a disappointment. We had come for dinner. They had greatly improved on the presentation by adding decorative elements to the servings but the basic taste of the dishes fell a lot. We had ordered fish in Peking style which was still impressive. Somewhy they had removed the pork dishes from the menu but still served them and the waiters were not too confident themselves about which of the pork dishes they served at their own restaurant, that was a little odd. The schezwan lamb was good but nothing exceptional. The fried rice and rice noodles were standard. The waiter asked us to try their special of the day which was whole beckti in sauce of your choice. Now he wasn't able to explain very well what the dish would be like but insisted on us taking it. And it was a horror. Almost inedible. There was no taste. It was fried fish with sauce on top, and it's not something I'd have again.

My second visit ruined all the hopes I had from this place. I may visit here again, but certainly won't rank this among my favorites. Most of the plus points in this rating is from my first visit.

It was one of those days when we were roaming hungry on the streets of Southern Avenue looking for a cheap yet decent place to fill our stomachs. We passed by this restaurant and my friend suggested a try. So we hopped in and ordered for a plate of Chicken Chilly Ginger Noodles. The noodles was nicely made with whole fried red chiiles and a flavour of ginger. One plate sufficiently filled 2 stomachs. The noodles costed us around 210 bucks including taxes. 
Decent ambience, reddish walls and dim lighting. A pocket friendly place, worth a try!

The red glass front door is misleading in the sense that you open the door with the anticipation that the decore is red. But it is not. No loss anyway. 
  The sofas are black and comfortable. The tables are bit high. Would have loved them a bit lower. Just a bit. I loved the painting of Tarasundari on one of the walls.

The whole restaurant is neat and clean. It is a small outlet but cozy as well.

The staff are obedient and helpful and professional brood. You would love them serve you.

Now for the food. We ordered sweet line soda, mixed Hakka noodles and Kung Pao chicken. Sweet line soda tasted great. The noodles and chicken arrived soon after. The noodles were more than enough for two persons. It was tasty, light and filled with goodies. Kung  Pao chicken disappointed me though. The cashewnut content was not much and the chicken pieces were not juicy.

Anyway, the price was normal. Place to drop in if you want to have heavy lunch and to be pampered too.

It's a little difficult to locate, however, everything else about this place is pretty good. On shashti, we were lucky to get a table for 12 people. The staff was very cordial and polite. It wasn't much crowded. We ordered-
Crispy honey chicken which was a little too sweet for our taste although we were told otherwise,
Lohan vegetables- which is basically fried Veg dumpling was ok.
The dish that we enjoyed most was the egg wrapped mixed fried rice. The chicken and prawn pieces were very fresh.
Kung pao chicken, chilli chicken were good and tai chi chicken was alright.
Brownie with ice cream was fine. would have preferred vanilla ice cream instead of tuti fruity. The decor can be upgraded to some extent.
All this came to 2500.
Overall it was a good experience and would certainly pay another visit to this place.

Went there for Panchami Lunch,had a good experience with the service,but no of items are a little less but maximum of them taste different i.e one can differentiate among taste.
Good for it if you are around Rashbehari Avenue.

This restaurant was in my wishlist for long time, finally had the opportunity to taste their food, ordered for home delivery. Food delivered within 45 mins. Ordered mixed fried rice, mixed rice noodles, hunan fish and singapore chili garlic prawns, all the items were excellent. Food was less oily and adequately spiced, quantity more than enough, ingredients were fresh. the price was on higher side for sure but as the food was good so no complaints. overall had a good experience with china calling. love to try it again in future.

The mixed fried rice has a great quantity and taste us very good. The prawns are soft and a lot if chicken is given. On the other hand the crispy honey chicken has a mild crunch and a soft centre. A sweet a tangy taste to tingle your taste buds. As a side dish tai chi chicken has a subtle taste, being on the lighter side has a nice garlicy hint. It can go well with a spicy rice or chow.

One of the best places to have Chinese in South Kolkata. A wonderful little fine dining restaurant. Cordial staff, comfortable ambience. Delectable dishes, which tastes unbelievably good, at extremely affordable prices. It's a must visit restaurant. Thank you to the entire team, specially Pallab and Subroto Karr for being such great hosts and warm hospitality.

This restaurant was in my wishlist for long time, finally had the opportunity to taste their food, ordered for home delivery. Food delivered within 45 mins. Ordered mixed fried rice, mixed rice noodles, hunan fish and singapore chili garlic prawns, all the items were excellent. Food was less oily and adequately spiced, quantity more than enough, ingredients were fresh. the price was on higher side for sure but as the food was good so no complaints. overall had a good experience with china calling. love to try it again in future.

We had a decent meal here , I quite enjoyed the starters specially the Crispy Honey Chicken which was very nice. The Chilli Chiken was also good. Hot and Sour Soup was decent but the Dimsum was overdone and a bit of a soggy mess. Overall a mixed experience with somethings very nice and others rather average.

The service was very good. The honey crispy chicken was amazing. Also I liked the kung pao chicken and the chicken Hakka chow. The quantity and quality sums up the value for money.  The ambience/decor is also quite nice. But the tables a slightly high. Little lower tables could have made me more comfortable.

The food is not that bad. Untimely lunch on a monsoon afternoon can be pretty rejuvenating. Vegetable dumplings in spicy manchurian sauce was quite tasty at a go. Was pretty orthodox while placing the order but non vegetarians may love to visit it quite often as they may love the chicken in Hoisin Sauce. But vegans like me was pretty happy with vegetables in hot garlic sauce.

As the name says, this is a decent place to have chinese dishes at affordable budget.
Ambience-wise, this place is good, the service is also good. My picks from this place are :
chicken lung fung soup, chicken Thau Su¬† , cantonese roasted pork, chilli ginger noodles and mixed rice.

Well china calling is located at the right lane of Kamala Girls school near wats this friday.

Last week we I tried at 4:30 pm but they were closed so we visited again today by 3 pm.

Ambiance is dark. Seating arrangements were very good and comfortable. Place was very clean and hygienic.. I really liked the interior.

Now coming to the food we ordered Fish in peeking sauce as a appetizer. Dish was good and spicy.. Quantity was sufficient and used bekti fish was well cooked.

We tried mixed fried rice and kung pao chicken. Kung pao chicken has 10 pcs of chicken tossed in cashews and bell peppers.
Fried rice was good but I found used rice quality was not do fine. The grain was too thick.... 

Brownie with ice cream is must try here.. Brownie tasted good. Wanted to try fried ice cream but our server said it was not available.

Service was good also.

A pretty standard restaurant; nothing fancy about it. The fact that it is small is made up for by the fact that it doesn't attract much crowd. Nothing too special about the food, but the quantity is humongous! It's best to go to this place in a group of three or more in order to be able to have multiple dishes. Since we were a couple, we ordered only dragon chicken and american chopsuey. The dragon chicken was good, but the american chopsuey was a bit too sweet and too soggy. Wrong choice, maybe. They don't serve mocktails as such, so we ordered sweet lime, which was good.

China Calling is situated in a by lane of southern avenue, beside vivekananda park and whtz this friday; hence even with my not so great geography knowledge I could locate this place. I went there on a Saturday night for a family dinner and the place was semi full. Its  a small outlet, basically a house turned into a restaurant. But i quite liked the subtle and minimalistic decor and the intelligent area management. 

Frankly I would have given this place a 3, but I will go ahead and give it a 3.5 just and just because of the flawless service. A special mention of Malay and Pallab who were at their gracious best. 

Moving on to the food. 
#Sea food soup : While the portion was less the taste was top notch. I was happy to see that it had loads of sea food. 
#Crispy Honey Chicken : Strips of chicken tossed is a sweetish honey based sauce. It primarily had soya sauce and ketchup mix as the sauce. The taste was very common and the chicken strips were too thin.
#Cantonese Noodles : though the portions was good, the taste was very mundane. It didn't have much of flavours, the portion of chicken and veggies were good. 
#Mixed Fried Rice : Okish, it didn't have much of flavours.
#Tai Chi Chicken: This chicken dish had similar flavours as the starter, very banal. 

I wish the team all the very best and hope they would improve !!

On a sudden dinner visited to this place when I had some other place on mind. Found this small Chinese restaurant near the Vivekananda park.

**Location**
Take the right lane from the Kamala girls school adjacent to the field and this place will be at your left hand side.

**Decor**
Chinese themed Decor with smart interiors and furniture is a clean and small restaurant.
Liked the coziness and simple look.

**Food**
Started with
Manchow soup : was very refreshing and prepared well.. Liked it

Mongolian chicken : Was decent in taste and quite tasty as well.

Stuffed prawn: Not worth compare to the price first of all. It was deep fried with crumbs so much that the prawn taste was missing. Not appealing at all moreover the dip was tasteless.

Mains
Mixed noodles:
Really good and very well prepared with less oil on it. Generous amount of Chicken and prawn added to it.

Chilli ginger mixed fried rice:
If I consider this as a normal fried rice it's nice but no ginger or chilli flavor is at all added to it when it comes to the flavored rice.

Taipei chicken:
Very blunt and failed to get the essence of the dish at all. A big NO on this.

Fish hu phak sauce
It was red gravy which was too sweet felt like having sweet ketchup but still decent compare to the chicken. The coating was thick on the fish which is a turn off for me.

**Service**
Service and behavior of the staffs are really nice. But they needs to be trained well in terms of food taste and knowledge on that. This will help the management to grow in future.

China Calling is a Chinese restaurant catering quality food in a beautifully decorated ambience. The interior is eye catching with red and black theme and hanging Chinese lamps. The staffs are attentive and knowledgeable about the food. They customize the food according to customer requirements
Lemon Coriander soup which was decent.

#Honey chicken which was very good, both presentation as well as taste wise.

Mixed Fried rice with egg wrap looked beautiful, but the taste flattered to deceive.

The Teng Tue style Fish tasted good . The gravy was rich and thick.

Fresh Lime, sweet n salt was mediocre.

Service is polite and pricing is reasonable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

We had Dragon Chicken as a starter which was super crispy and crunchy with a delicious sauce, Chicken Satay looked like Kulfi Sticks and tasted superb with a sauce which had peanut taste and Chilly Chicken dry. All starters were actually fab. Next for the main course we ordered for Mixed Meifoon, Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Pan fried Noodles and Pork in Hot Garlic. We noticed that they used minimum quantity of oil and all the dishes were lip smacking.¬†Ambiance¬†is good and the service is¬†courteous.

Little difficult to locate for a 1st timer. It was a Sunday afternoon and about 50% tables were occupied. The place is divided into 2 sections.

We ordered:
1. Crunchy baby corn salt & pepper : 1.5/5 ¬†
2. Chilli Pork : 3/5
3. Golden fried prawns : 3/5
4. Crispy Honey Chicken : 4/5
5. Mixed Schezwan Rice : 2.5/5
6. Fresh lime sweet & salt : 4/5

Taste of food is totally average. Quantity is good. Staff is courteous. Ambience is fine.

Tried their Chicken tom yum soup, Chicken Satay. In main course, we had Chicken fried rice, Chicken noodles, fish in teng-tue style and Tai Chi Chicken. The quantity was sufficient for 5 of us and food tasted delicious.
Service was good and it is a pocket friendly place.

However, when we entered, we were greeted without any delay and we were shown to our table.. The staff was very polite..

China Calling us over some other restaurants was not a myth. Situated very near to the Vivekananda Park, it provides with awesome Chinese foods. The price will not seem that pocket friendly when you have a look at the menu card. But when you realize that the prices mentioned on the card are inclusive of taxes, you understand the items do have reasonable prices. They don't keep chopsticks on the table and doesn't even provide you with one at first. If you want to have them, you can always ask for chopsticks from them. We had Chicken Cheese Dimsum, Veg Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice (it's actually not on the menu) and Hupak Chicken, and I had all of them with chopsticks. The foods were delicious. Quality was also good, though I personally felt quantity was a bit less than expectations. As for service, good, but the waiters were so soft spoken that it was almost impossible to hear them. Nonetheless, will rate this food joint with 8 out of 10.

Located beside vivekananda park, just opposite lane of kaal girls school. Absolutely great food, good taste. And the main part is the quantity. Good quality and good quantity. Had hakka noodles,  fried rice,  chicken satay, & fish coriander. Fish preparation was very soft. Should go.....

This is a small restaurant near VP with good ambience. It is a place where you can find some authentic Chinese food. We ordered a soup, crispy honey chicken, fish in peeking style and cheese chicken dimsum. Crispy honey chicken and the fish was really good everyone should try that but cheese chicken dimsum was not up to the mark. It was dry and tasted like any other random momo and it costs 180/- so overall the experience was good but for that dimsum im rating it 3.5

China Calling is a Chinese restaurant catering quality food in a beautifully decorated ambience. The interior is eye catching with red and black theme and hanging Chinese lamps. The staffs are attentive and knowledgeable about the food. They customize the food according to customer requirements. 

We tried MIXED FRIED RICE with shrimp and chicken along with the side dish THAU SU CHICKEN. 8-10 tender slices of chicken was very nicely cooked in flavourful gravy. However, the chicken slices in the rice was a bit chewy. Again, rice was aromatic and complemented Thau Su chicken. 
Finally, we tasted BROWNIE WITH ICE CREAM as dessert, which was not only great in taste but also in presentation.üòã yummy!

Service is polite and pricing is reasonable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Overall...
Ambience 4/5
Food 4.75/5
Service 4/5

What's better than the usual local Indian version of Chinese on a hot afternoon for lunch? Brilliant tasting Chinese for bucks that don't hurt the pocket!
China Calling is a really close call to that perfect Chinese lunch or dinner in a little, fine dining Chinese restaurant tucked away in the by lanes of Southern Avenue. We had visited it for a friend's birthday treat, for lunch and nothing disappoints one. Well done interiors, (personally feel there's too much use of black) comfortable seating,pleasant staff and wide array of menu.
We ordered the Honey glazed Chicken for starters, which was the best I've had in a while. Following it, was Coriander fish, Chilli Chicken, Rice Noodles and Pan Fried Noodles. Everything looked and tasted beautiful, though I think the Rice Noodles were a bit sticky. Portions are sufficient. Ice cream and Darsan to top it off, our group of four was full to the brim after this mega lunch!
All within a pocket pinch of 2200, made it feel better!
Must try!

China Calling is located near Vivekananda park and has a very small but beautiful entrance. We had already booked a table for two. The decor was good. We were given a huge table which was sufficient for two. We had gone around 2pm and we were the only customers at that time. We enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere.

Well...i went there with lots of hope as i am a great chinese lover...I decided to be there from the last night...We faced a bit problem in findng the restaurant as it was in a bit interior side...so guys planning fr dis restaurant, its located jst beside VP...
The theme was good...and a small restaurant with limited seating capacity...there is a screen showing sports(if not live then highlights)...we ordered mongolian chicken as starters...then we ordered mixed hakka and tai chi(or tai chu, i forgot) chicken...
The starter was not bad at all...but the main problem came in the main course...the noodles was thin but the taste was not upto the scratch for the money u r paying...the chicken also tasted nothing special...it was mediokar....
But the staffs are very nice and very polite...my suggestion is dont go for it if u want good food quality..but to try some new place its not a very bad one...the prices are as it is shown in the menu card...no extra charges...so its cheap(almost)..

Visited here for dinner today. Nice and cozy restaurant. Affordable prices. Bill came to 1340 for 3 of us. Ordered crispy fish and chicken cheese dimsum. The fish was really well made. But the dimsum was a bit dry and barely had cheese in it. It was more of momo than dimsum. Quantity is way too much. We had ordered egg rice,chicken taifu and mixed Hakka noodles. The noodles was a bit bland in taste. The rice was really good. Chicken taifu was tasty. The fresh lime soda was perfectly balanced. In the end they gave pass pass which is my favourite so that was a brownie point. Overall a nice experience. :-)

A great restaurant for any group - be it friends, family, couple!!

The food tasted more that awesome and the ambiance was very cumbersome!! The staff was in with the flow of the restaurant which made our meal even greater..
Food was delivered in time and the service was great..

I would recommend everyone going here to have the DRAGON CHICKEN (Starter) as this is the best delicacy I ever tasted in any Chinese Restaurant.

We were totally satisfied by the quality of food, restaurant, ambiance, staff and music... Yes guys! the music there was good too, had that soothing essence!!

Right from Parking your car to leaving the restaurant was simple, neat and to the point. That's exactly how I found this restaurant. Having a simple 4 page menu neatly categorized and the food simply to die for. Yes, really really good food. Very lip smacking and very tasty. We had the Egg Wrapped Fried Rice (OMG! You have to try this out) and the Hupak or Tai Chi Chicken (I don't remember the exact name but it had a brown soya based gravy and definitely one amongst the two mentioned).

I wouldn't really call it 'fine dining' because of the television set present in the dining room and the wall paints (though not noticeable) were peeling off. The rest of the experience was, really good. Once again, I go to a restaurant to eat. If the service and the food is good and I don't come face to face with any rodents or pests (people included), I don't really need to complain about anything else. At least, that's how I roll.

This is your standard Indian Chinese joint. Tucked away in a residential part of southern avenue. The ambiance is cosy. Everything is predominantly sweet, which is something I can enjoy once in a while. The crispy honey chicken is uniquely sliced into thin leaves. Well priced.

CHINA CALLING is the latest addition to the list of chinese eateries of the city of joy , occupying the ground floor of a building near vivekananda park, with a seating arrangement  sectioned in 3 rooms and pretty nice interiors done in grey black and red , really liked they have long black sofas which adds charm to the decor. But playing sort of light chinese instrumental would have made ambience much better, as we say , music uplifts our mood .
Perhaps we happened to hit the place on a wrong day, they ran out of lamb and pork , thus we restricted ourselves to chicken and fish dishes. Moreover the a.c. in the middle room where our table was ,had been sent for servicing.
However the manager guided us through the menu and we settled for the following dishes and my ratings are :

Chicken mushroom soup 4/5
Chicken Manchow soup 3.5/5
Chicken Lemon coriander soup 3/5 (Staff recommended)

CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN  5/5 must order
chicken satey 4/5

Kungpao chicken 3.5/5 (staff recommended )
Fish in teng tue style 4.5/5
Chicken hakka noodles 2/5
Mixed fried rice 3/5

When the basics such as noodles and rice of any chinese joint fails to tease your tastebuds , definitely the rating goes down. The hakka noodles was dry and bland ,the fried rice was unmentionable. Their recommended dishes weren't upto our liking, and it would be unfair to comment on their service and efficiency, as we were the only guests in that afternoon. But yes , I'll be looking forward to be back someday for their pork and lamb menu yet another time.

I go to this restaurant once in a while primarily because its very less crowded and you can have a nice quiet dinner and conversation with some one and quite pocket friendly. 

Food: The food is actually good as I have experienced. The finishing is better than many at this price range so kudos to the chef. I would recommend you have a soup like Talumein soup or manchow soup followedby a chow or rice of your choice along with crispy honey chicken or Mongolian chicken, etc. may be you can have a chili pork or lamb in red wine sauce if that suits your palate. Avoid fish and desserts, they are not worth it.

Service: Service is prompt and appropriate but I have seen waiters loitering around some times, all ears, which might be annoying.

Ambiance: The ambiance is no doubt quiet and cozy. There is a Chinese sword on display which seems straight from a Jackie Chan movie , "me likey!"

Verdict: Good place to meet a friend and have a nice conversation away from all noise and disturbance. Should avoid if only dinner or lunch is your main objective for the evening. :D

This October when I visited Kolkata for the festival of Durga Puja, I had a few places in my mind that I wanted to visit. One of them was this newly opened Chinese joint off Southern Avenue. Locating the place, even with Google maps, was a little difficult but we made there without a problem. One thing to mention here is that we were running out of time and wanted to order the soup and starters while on the cab, but the restaurant refused to take any such orders. The lack of concern was a little putting off, but never mind.

The first order was Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup, followed by Chili Pork and Crispy Honey Chicken. The soup was really good, and the flavors came out well. The ingredients were a little too much and the flavor of coriander was lost, but the slight tanginess of lemon was refreshing and we enjoyed sipping the soup. The Chili Pork were great too, made from pork cubes rather than roast pork and we gorged on the meat, it being by favorite. The dish, though simple, was prepared really well, and the sauce was just right, not overpowering the meat. The Crispy Honey Chicken was also good, fried pieces of chicken coated in a spiced honey sauce, and it had the signature sweet‚Äôn‚Äôspicy taste. Nothing extraordinary but good.

For mains, we ordered a Mixed Mein Foon (rice noodles) and Fish in Teng-Tue Style (which is Bhetki braised in a hot garlic sauce) and the combination was good. The order was too much for two people and we struggled a bit to finish everything, but in the end, we were full and happy. Rice noodles is my all-time favorite, and as always, it did not disappoint. The fish itself tasted great, and the gravy was the regular garlic sauce flavored, nothing fancy but simple and hearty.

Overall, I will rate this place at 4 even if I think it deserves 4.25 for the ambiance and the prompt service. Nothing extraordinary, but surely worth a visit to enjoy some good Chinese food.

The visit to this place was unplanned. We were actually going for lunch at another chinese joint when this place caught our eyes, and after quickly checking out some very good reviews on zomato we decided on trying this place out. The first thing that caught our eyes upon entering was the decor. The place though not big, was very ardently decorated. Thumbs up to the management for that. Now the star of any restaurant is their food. But china calling falls short in this category. We ordered lemon coriander chicken soup, honey chicken, pan fried noodles and fish in teng tu style. The soup was served with a lot of ingredients except for the main item mentioned..i.e. the lemon zest and flavour...there was no lemon flavour in it at all and frankly ordering this soup seemed futile. Next coming to the honey chicken, it tasted quite nice with a spicy yummy sauce but again the drawback of this dish was the chicken size which were extremely thin. The portion size was too little for the chicken pan fried noodles. One of my friend only had the gravy left for his portion without any noodles. The fish however was nicely prepared. It was very soft and the gravy was quite delicious. It was the only dish i enjoyed. But the worst part was we were not even filled after the lunch.The place is highly overpriced considering the portion of the food served. Our bill was 1000 without tax. Management should definitely look into upgrading the quality and quantity of the food, and being a new place it has a lot of chance on improvising.

The visit to this restaurant was completely unplanned because we were walking to have lunch in some other joint but suddenly we saw the direction board of this joint and decided to try it out as we were in the mood of having chinese food. The place is small but I would appreciate the fact that inspite of it being small the place is pleasently decorated. We ordered lemon coriander chicken soup, crispy honey chicken in starter and pan fried mixed noodles and fish in teng tu style (I hope I have the name correct). We wanted to have something lemony so we ordered the said soup but alas the soup had hardly any lemon flavour in it. It had all the ingredients but the lemon flavour was lost somewhere and therefore was disappointing. The chicken starter was well made but the chicken was quite thinly sliced. The pan fried noodles made us really sad because it had so little noodles in it that we 3 people hardly got one spoon each and it was filled with vegetables and very less noodles. The fish dish was good in taste and the quality of the fish was good but the quantity again is very less because the pieces were really small. The total bill amount was Rs. 990 and there was no extra tax. We were not that filled after our lunch and I would recommend them to do something about their quantity and it being a new joint it definitely has room for improvement.

Went to this outlet yesterday evening for some evening snacks. Following are my observations in brief :

Pros :

1. The interior decor is nice and seats are comfortable.
2. The food tastes pretty good except the soup which is okayish (Ordered Honey Sliced Chicken, Mongolian Chicken, Chicken Hot and Sour Soup).
3. The lights are perfect for a Chinese outlet.
4. The service staff is courteous enough.

Cons :

1. Location is a bit difficult to find.
2. A light music is missing which results in uncomfortable interference of voices when the restaurant is empty.

Overall a must visit for any Chinese lovers !

Very nice Chinese - fusion food. Honey mourala was too good. Chicken satay was very juicy. You must order the egg wrapped fried rice. Hockey - bockey for dessert is a must for the kids. A tad bit difficult to find the restaurant in the first place. But once there, enjoy the food. Highly recommended.

Its not for the first time that I had come to a Chinese restaurant. But this time I was referred this place called china calling by a close friend of mine. Hence I along with my family came here last week for a dine-in. And I must say that we were not disappointed at all, infact we were overwhelmed with the food we were served. It was pure authentic food and such reasonably priced. We had ordered veg hot & sour soup, bokchoy and brocolli calling, ginger fried rice and veg pan fried noodles. Service was quick and the staff friendly. We also got a chance to meet a few celebrities from tollywood along with Rituparna Sengupta who we came to know were regulars at the place and adding to it they did not mind posing for a few pics for us.
Well, i would suggest all chinese lovers to try this place for a pure authentic food and I am sure you too will love it.
Well done team China Calling!!!

Lets start with the starters..
Congy Crispy Lamb - 7/10
Stir Fried Fish - 9/10 ( Quality and the softness of the fish is to be complimented for)

Moving on the the main Course,
Cantonese Gravy Chicken Chow- 7/10
Mixed Fried Rice - 6.5/10 ( The standard taste of a mixed Rice)
Honey chicken- 8/10 ( it was not much of the ideal honey chicken you would expect but it did not taste bad, sweet and crispy )
Some Pork Gravy - 6/10 ( i forgot the name, one reason could be that i did not like it much) 

Overall it was a good experience, well behaved staff and clean area. Suitable for both family and students. 
Pretty reasonable ( our bill was ‚Çπ1500 approx.)

The oder was taken professional, the person taking the order was able to understand my needs and make suggestions accordingly.¬†
I ended up ordering-
Ginger rice - lovely and light, rice tossed with slim slivers of ginger.¬†
Chicken in plum sauce - The chicken pieces were tender but the dish was just okay not great but nice enough¬†
Crispy honey chicken - what can I say this just just perfect. Thin slivers of chicken perfectly spiced in a honey chilli sauce.

The fancy to try out a new Chinese food joint in the locality (Southern Avenue) got us stepping in here.

The pros of this joint were their smartly done interiors,apt seating arrangements, tempting variety of food in the menu card and welcoming staff.

But what really disheartened us was the non-availability of some of the hand-picked dishes. Crab wasn't available. We ordered Lamb in Red Wine Sauce but they served us pure tender mutton. Although the menu had 5-6 desserts, except for Darsaan they had nothing else to serve. Therefore we did not have any sweet ending to our food crave here.

Somehow this restaurant did not live up to the expectation it created when we entered here.

On an idle Saturday i decided to have a lunch at china calling. But it was a remarkable experience to me. The restaurant is well decorated. I ordered chilly crab as starter. It was too spicy. My mouth was burning. In the main course i ordered egg wrapped mixed fried rice along with sweet lime soda and tai chi chicken. The concept of mixed fried rice is good and innovative. The fried rice is wrapped in omlet. But the chicken preparation is like any basic kind of chicken preparation in taste. When i visited their, a new item was introduce in their menu named rajkahini special,preparation of boneless Hilisha.. but i didn't try it as i dont like hilisha. Rajkahani special menu will be available untill the movie was removed from theatre.

Stopped by for lunch. Started of with Chilly Pork, which was excellent. Had the mixed fried rice and chilly chicken gravy, which was equally tasty. The portions were huge and goid value for money food.

Gave my order through Somatosensory Order, not once, not twice, but thrice, and they rejected it each time. Chinese mood goes down the drain!

Well, overall what I experienced here was good. Except for a few loops, food was not that bad. The dimsums were bit dry, but the filling inside tasted really good. Crispy chicken was very nice but the golden fried fish was very small in size. It just went down in a bite. The basic sweet corn soup was good, it lacked the pieces of chicken, I literally looked for them inside. 
Now, our main course. The classic hakka noodles was great, no soya but good flavors. They really messed up the mixed fried rice, the smell of the prawns made me pukish. On the other hand, the fish in coriander sauce, was very tender and so good flavors that I craved for more. Kung pao chicken was also good and flavourful. 
Lastly, the ice cream scoops were too small. They should've served 2 scoops really. And the darsans were good too. 
Il be going back there soon.

They have increased all prices so it is around 900 bucks for 2 people now. They are not accepting Zomato orders. I felt very below average taste of Foods & prices are high in compare to taste. 1st time any restaurant (who serves pork) served Mixed Maifoons without Pork & when we asked they said we don't serve Pork in Mix Maifoons..... Strange!!!! Rating 3.

Went to this outlet during the Puja. This is located very inside from the main roads so a bit hard to find out. We took dishes like mongolean chicken in starters , sweet corn soup, a babycorn dish in starters. All the dishes were good specially the mongolean chicken which was awesome. In the main course we took chicken hakka noodles, chicken schezwan rice , fish in coriander sauce and kung pao chicken. Except the noodles every dishes were very good. The noodles was a complete turn down tasted very bland without any flavours. During the pujas they don't serve deserts or pan fried noodles or rice which I think a good strategy to serve good quality food as many restaurants are unable to keep up the quality of food during puja.

My wife and I went here for dinner. A small, cozy restaurant located in a lane behind Vivekananda Park, it was a nice and cozy. We ordered tom yum soup, a veg main course with mushroom, ginger fried rice, Singapore chilli prawns. The food in general was good, no 'wow' factor! The service was prompt and fast. The ambience was nice, but the sofas set alongside the dining tables were most inappropriate for comfortable dining. Beats me why basic dining chairs were substituted by drawing room sofas! Anyway, apart from the uncomfortable seats, this is a good restaurant with available parking space. Prices are OK.

Really, there ought to be some punishment death out to people who claim to serve Chinese and mess up the basics!! I mean, who can mess up the classic tom yum soup, huh??!! 
Upon entering we were greeted by an empty restaurant. The decor is nothing to talk about. It is almost lacklustre. So, ambience scores go down the drain. The waiter- there is only one; is not very friendly. The seating is quite uncomfortable. 
We ordered chicken tom yum soup, chicken rice and noodles, kung pao chicken and lemon chicken. Everything just tasted average. Soup was not piping hot as we would like it: it lacked fresh flavours and was bitter  taste- almost too strong when tasted in consecutive sips. Rest of the food- better not to talk about. 
Staff is not very welcoming too, though service is prompt. Certainly not going back ever. 
P.S. - only plus point - tollywood  director Srijit Mukherjee came in for dinner. A big poster of his upcoming movie Rajkahini was displayed outside the restaurant.

Firstly, the prices on the menu provided on Zomato are wrong or outdated. Add 20-30 rupees to get the present price. That's a big negative. Customers should have the correct information. Isn't that the point of Zomato.?? I think that's a shortcoming on the part of the restaurant. I request swift action. 

The decor at this place is absolutely amazing. As you sit waiting for food, you can look around and the beauty of the place in. Should keep your mind off the hunger. Yes, the decor is that good. 

The food is average at best. 
Crispy Honey Chicken: You could just go there and eat this till you're full and you'll come out feeling good about yourself. Could be called one of the best sweet non-veg starter in the city. 

Veg Ginger Fried Rice: I'm sort of sure that the rice wasn't fried. And even if it was, they must have used water to fry it in (anything is possible in Kolkata during Pujas). Seriously though, it didn't seem that the rice was sufficiently fried.

Kung Pao Chicken: The chicken was cooked well and marinated properly. Pity that the dish didn't have a punch of taste to offer. You just end up eating it. Nothing special happens once you put it inside your mouth. 

Chicken Thau Su: again the chicken was well cooked and marinated. In terms of taste, this one is recommended. 

Overall, I'd come back here in some time to check out the changes, because for a relatively new restaurant, they're at a better place than most others. I hope the decor remains the same.

It is terrific that this year the Pujo crowd started so early in Kolkata. It was yesterday that we went out and planned for lunch after a long pandal hopping. We were planning to go to China Wok, but the place was to crowded and we had to catch a movie afterwards. Being in a hurry we had to rush. So, checked Zomato and came up with this restaurant which opened just five months back. Walking up to here, the place was easy to find out because the management had put up the directions at every end of the alley. The decor was alright, sporting a typical Black and Red Chinese restaurant look. But oh my my, the music played there was horrible. It was in no way related to the Chinese culture, heritage or anything. Yes, they played 90s B Grade Bollywood music which just spoilt the whole ambience. The staffs were in real hurry not paying attention to what we had to ask and order. They just insisted on ordering the whole course at the same time. Well, in that way we just ordered soup and starters. We ordered Seafood Soup, Honey Chicken, Pepper Chilli Prawn and Chilli Pork. The soup, prawn and the pork were good. Although they didn't give the fatty part of pork, which like very much, it tasted really good. But now comes the Honey Chicken. It tasted good but was in no terms related to the taste of honey. It seemed more like Szechwan Pan Fried Chicken, but yeah it was good. This was kind of the manager to come and ask about the experience at the end of the meal, contrary to the service of the other staffs. It is not highly recommended, but if you go you will not be disappointed, neither very satisfied. Happy Dining! :)

Firstly thnks to zomato I came to know abt this great place though its just a few minutes walk from my home nd secondly sorry to the administration to write my review so lately as me ND my sister had been thr fr the rakhi treat nd today is 14/10/15. M a bit lazy to write reviews thts it ?. 

Ok. I wl begin with the ambience nd inner decors... Truly its superbly decorated, the moment u enter the place u wl have a wow feel from within. Its spacious with Chinese decors.. Nd they have a unique way fr the customers to select their order. They may have printed menu bt usually they wl provide u with a tab nd u can select ur items like u do in flip cart or snap deal just add the items in ur cart, simple. Totally  loved it ? ? . The service is too good not prompt not late just in time, so u can njy the time with ur family nd friends nd yes they r really helpful they have knowledge over the items nd wl guide u if u r feeling confused. 
Now the food ... Oh my my.. We had crispy honey chicken nd chicken sataye fr starters nd they both tasted like dish of heaven. While the sataye was a ltl spicy the crispy honey was a ltl subtle nd moderate with rich flavours nd nicely garnished. Nd mind it u can have ur starters with was bcoz they don't give rush to their customers unlike other restaurants, unless u finish ur starter they wont bring the main dishes.  Fr the main dishes we ordered   chicken in hoisin sauce nd chicken noodles which one I don't remember exactly ... Bt they both tasted good with adequate quantity fr two people to fill their tummy bt the starters stole the show. The chicken size was nice nd mouthful very nicely nd evenly served. 
In short I wl be back again soon to try out the other dishes. Moreover this place is pocket friendly fr the amount and quality of food they serve. Me nd my sister were highly satisfied.

Deciding to have lunch on an idle Sunday afternoon, my wife and I settled for this place. 
It is located in the lane behind the Vivekananda park. The decor is smart, Chinese styled yet not clich√©d. We had the entire place to ourselves when we checked therein.
Based on the suggestion of the attendant we ordered a plate of Mongolian chicken and stir fried fish as starters. Being the only customer at that point of time, they served the food immediately. The Mongolian chicken, 6-7 big succulent pieces of chicken tossed with minimal vegetables and tangy spices was just textbook delicious. It was spicy to my taste Bud's content.
The stir fried fish was different, 7-8 decent pieces of soft, delicate fish served with saut√©ed vegetables, it was a bit mellow in its taste but tasted good too.
For the main course we ordered a chicken Hakka chow mein and kung pao chicken as side dish.
The chow mein was a let down. Quantity wise it was okay, not huge. Taste wise it was over boiled, bland, too much simplistic, also it contained minimal chicken in it.
The kung pao chicken was again good, 8 pieces of decent sized chicken, tender, served with sweet gravy and ginger slices to flavour it. 
After that we had a glass of sweet lime soda each. 
To sum up its a decent joint to have dinner/lunch with your family or friends, good food, decent quantity and pretty cheap. But I would say, the wow factor is missing.

PS it cost us 850 bux for 2ppl

Trusting the regulars of this eatery my Sister and her husband, we ordered Crispy Honey Chicken, Chilli Crab and Golden Fried Prawn.  The chicken's name is quite deceptive,  cause even though you can taste the honey,  it is quite spicy!  And I loved it üòò The Prawn was stuffed with spices,  was light, and soothing on palate.  Now,  the Crab,  it was super spicy, with delicious succulent crab meat.  I liked it.  Overall it was a tasty food experience.  #ThumpsUp #Foodie

This place is simply amazing, both the ambiance and the food.
We ordered Konjee Crispy Lamb, Mixed Fried Rice, Tai Chi Chicken, Five Spice Lamb and Mixed Gravy Noodles. Each and every dish was simply delicious specially the Konjee Crispy Lamb and the Tai Chi Chicken. These two are must try dishes over here. And, the prices of each dish is quite affordable.
Hope to visit it again soon.

Needed a quick dinner close to home, zomato suggested it, we tried it!¬†

Don't think this can be touted as a restaurant for fine dining! However, good food and reasonable prices can be its USP. However, my experience was marred by their service!

Since they were hosting a private party for some upcoming Bengali movie's cast, they seem rather frazzled. Menus and water came to our table after prompting. After a decent amount of wait on our food, it finally came.

Chicken Tomyum Soup, followed by Mongolian Chicken! Both are extremely good and I would recommend them! Chicken Pan Fried Noodles and Five Spice Lamb came thereafter.

Although food was yum and portions were good for two, service was a HUGE let down. While serving soup, the server nearly dropped it on my lap. He struggled so much while serving the noodles that I told him that we would serve it ourselves!! We ordered for Fresh lime juice but that never came! To get the check was another ordeal and had to be requested 4 times!¬†

Hope the service improves! Else food is pretty good and prices reasonable too ( 2 persons, our bill was INR 700!!). Recommend it if you have a high patience threshold!

Amazing food and a perfect place for a weekend dinner. Cozy restaurant with subtle Chinese touch. Decently priced, moderate time taken to serve.  Must try Prawn starters  (prawn /crab) stuffed, pork ribs, thai chi chicken and fish in coriander sauce in the mains.

The food was good, especially chicken satay. We ordered chicken mushroom soup, chicken lemon coriander soup, and chicken satay for starter. For main course we had noodles and a chicken I don't remember. Noodles is thinner than usual and tastier. Quantity sufficient for two. actually two of us and our 5year old were struggling to finish one noodles. Recommended !!!

Too many Chinese joints in the city yet this one makes you come back again. Primarily because of its food. Roasted Chilli Pork and Pan fried noodles combine well. Try the Shanghai potatoes also. Ambience is just perfect for a "adda feel". It's certainly doesn't have the finesse of a fine dining.

Came across this chinese restaurant near Vivekananda Park. Food was beyond good. Nice cozy joint, loved the Roasted Chilly Pirk and Chicken Satay. Do recommend. Pricing is pretty average.

Good food, superb ambience, cordial staff....in short, a great dining experience.special mention needs for d fat free chilly pork . I'm not a health freak but somehow, I dnt like d thick layer of fat on pork meat.i knw, for some, that's a sheer delicacy.another exceptional item wz d lemon coriander soup. ...totally different.we had quite a few of their dishes and felt that there is some intentional ingredient change that this eatery is experimenting on.wel, I find it quite interesting.keeping all these in count, d price is quite reasonable.one good thing about south kolkata is ,in d last couple of years, quite a few restaurants hv come up of great standards.....yes, rather i should say, have exceeded d standards of our snobbish park street eateries.I hv taken a fraction point for d sitting arrangement.d chairs a very very comfortable, but not d  the sofas.superb for relaxing, but not that comfortable for dining due to its low level,specially ,for bulkies.

Great ambience. Amazing food. Arguably the best golden fried prawns I've ever had. The crispy american corn was good enough. I personally like that a bit saucy which it wasn't. Then again it was my choice. Really loved the experience.

China calling is a chinese restaurant with proper dine in facility located near Vivekananda Park, Southern Avenue. I tried chicken mushroom soup, chicken hot and sour soup, mongolian chicken, chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. I liked the food and the ambience. The service is fast and the waiters are friendly. Overall, a good place and worth a visit.

A great discovery via Zomato ..china calling is a restaurant located in lake road ...close to Vivekananda park. If you have been to watz this friday then is located at the next corner.

From outside it looks like an old building with a chinese restaurant facade .but the interiors are well done in tones of red and black.

I was there 2 weeks ago for dinner and found it surprisingly full.

The menu was presented in a tablet which was different though not unique ..
The manager seemed to be multi tasking but was prompt with menu suggestions

Order:
-Veg manchow soup which was so good that we repeated the order
- veg fried rice which was delicious light yet filling
- veggies tossed in garlic sauce which was very wrll made
- fresh lime sweet

The portions were good and we had a great meal

Pocket pinch: 600+ which is reasonable

A good place i shall visit again to try more.
Great going!

The food here is above average. Starters were better than the main course. The staff is very friendly. Ambience decent. A meal for three costed around Rs 1400 and hence not very expensive too. The only problem with this place is very very slow service. So make sure you have ample time in hand if you go here. One should definitely give this new place a try.

I am in absolute love with china calling when it comes to food ordering procedure. They have taken a  unique approach of providing tabs to the customers. The tab has got an inbuilt software that assists the customer in ordering specific dishes along with their own specifications on any particular dish. 
Its a newly opened restaurant with a nice ambience for a casual dinner with friends and family. 
Food is good and prices are dart reasonable

Visited this restaurant last week for a family invitation. It is a small cozy and simple restaurant in southern avenue, near kamala girls high school. We tried the sweet corn soup, chicken dimsums, fish in green sauce, chili chicken and fried rice. The food was okay in quality, the service was decent. I did not like their noodles as it was very sticky according to my standards.

Went to this restro following my school friends job treat.
The place is a little tough to find unless you know the roads well.
The place is spacious and ambiance is good. To say the least, we were the noisy batch :P. The idea of having the menu on Tabs works better if the Tabs did not hang so often.
Coming to the food. For starter, we ordered Chicken Satay and Fish (forgot the name). The satay was good but the fish tasted amazing.
For main course, we went for Schezwan Rice, Chilli Garlic Fried Rice, Pan Fried Chicken Noodles, Fish in Plum Sauce and Chicken in Garlic Sauce.
The Chilli Garlic rice taste much better than Schezwan rice which lacked the spicy punch. We were a little disappointed with the pan fry as it turned out to be more like gravy noodles. The Chicken was good but again Fish in Plum Sauce tasted amazing.
For desert, the Fried Ice cream was ok. The coating tasted a bit starchy and dry but the Hot Chocolate sauce saved the day.

for the main course we had veg cantonese noodles n thay su chicken... the noodles were thick n the vegetables so well cooked... the aroma was wonderful... n the chicken was complimenting it so well ( all thanks to a gentle waiter who suggested me that)
it was then we called out to the owner Mr. karr n congratulated him on his new venture...

Hidden amongst the lanes near Vivekananda Park, you might miss China Calling, if you don't look out for it. Determined to serve dishes that are popular and reasonably priced, China Calling doesn't fail to please. They serve dishes like Cantonese noodles, lamb lung king style, and golden fried prawns. However, your best bet is sticking to what they're known for. Don't expect a huge variety of menu as they keep it simple!

The food here may not be fancy, but it's clearly prepared with heart. Start off with ‚ÄòChicken Talumein Soup‚Äô and ‚ÄòChicken Lemon Coriander Soup‚Äô. Chicken Talumein soup was amazingly balanced flavours, it‚Äôs basically comprises noodles, veggies and chicken, flavoured with soy sauce and held together with vegetable stock & chunks of chicken. If you love your health, don't miss their delicious Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup ‚Äî it's so darn satisfying. I also loved to call it a ‚ÄòVitamin C‚Äô soup, made with vitamin C rich ingredients like lemon, coriander, carrots and cabbage. Served in delicious steaming lemon & coriander broth, chicken slices are soft and tender, making for an extremely satisfying bowl of soup that just screams 'comfort'.

Now for starters we wanted to enjoy ‚ÄòChicken Dimsum‚Äô, ‚ÄòCrispy Honey Chicken‚Äô and to quench our thirst we ordered ‚ÄòThumbs Up‚Äô. Chicken Dimsum was interesting and tasty but I did not get the ‚Äòwow‚Äô feeling for it. To me it was just nice but my companions were enjoying the chicken dimsum. Crispy Honey Chicken was simply marvellous, it‚Äôs definitely one of the most value-for-money ones out there, and it doesn't compromise on quality or flavour. If you love tongue twisting taste, don't miss their Crispy Honey Chicken ‚Äî it's so darn satisfying.

In mains we ordered ‚ÄòChicken Thau Su‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken in Hoisin Sauce‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Ginger Fried Rice‚Äô and ‚ÄòChicken Hakka Noodles‚Äô. Chicken Thau Su may not be the perfect authentic cooked, but it certainly satisfy my hunger for spices and flavour. Definitely go for their fantastic Chicken in Hoisin Sauce‚Äî a generous portion of fresh chicken pieces lying in an addictive gravy that goes so perfectly with Chicken Ginger Fried Rice, and their incredibly flavourful Chicken Thau Su with Chicken Hakka Noodles.

Our dessert was ice cream with chocolate sauce, and there was nothing to say about it. We had issue with our first servings and they immediately change the portions. Service was quick and staffs were helpful enough.

As a newly opened restaurant, they are doing well enough. Hope in near future they add more finger licking dishes to their menu. This place is one to look out for coming days!

This place is a joke. They didn't have any tofu or bok-choy available even though it's on their fancy android app menu. The fried bekti was not remotely crisp. The servers were clueless about anything on the menu and had to rely on one guy who was probably the manager. 

The main course was better. Hunan fish was decent and the Hakka noodles were not too greasy. Pan fried noodles and Beijing treasure were well made with fresh vegetables. 

Absolutely no frills and basic fare. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

It's a new restaurant in the area, only a couple of months old but a very ideal place for a family gathering. The place looks homey and is quite affordable. It is modelled on an apartment and thus has three separate sections plus a kitchen and washroom. The most ingenious part of this place that they provide you with tabs and you can peruse through the menu and order items at your own will through the in-built app. Hard copies are also available though.
We had ordered Mixed Cantonese noodles, fried rice, Mixed Hakka noodles, lemon coriander soup, Crispy pepper prawn, hupak chicken, Tai chi chicken and ice-cream with chocolate sauce and darsan for dessert. The portions were good and the waiters too were helpful and courteous. The soup was amazing , the prawn starter was crisp and succulent but it was really spicy, so those who can't have very spicy food like me, make sure you let them know. I preferred the tai-chi chicken more than the hupak chicken, coz personally I'm not too fond of soya sauce used in the latter. ¬†The chicken pieces were of good quality and really soft and tender.¬†
Overall, it's a great place to be in and I see it going places once they start expanding their menus to incorporate a lot many items. I look forward to coming here again as it's the perfect place for a weekend dine-out.

One of the best places i have visited in quite a long time. The restaurant is located in a lane adjacent to vivekananda park and the location makes it quite hard to find at first. However the ambience is pretty good and gives a nice and cosy feel. However, what stands out is the quality of food..all the items ordered starting from the starters to the main course were simply delicious and exceptionally tasty. Its by far the best cuisine i have experienced for quite sometime...which makes a visit to this this place a must!!! And the best part is that the restaurant being newly setup still doesnt charge any extra taxes like VAT or Service taxes which is indeed a boon!! So hurry up and drop in at this wonderful place!

Located just behind Vivekananda park in Southern Avenue, China Calling is a new outlet for good chinese food. We were a bit apprehensive as this was our first visit there, but we were pleasantly surprised. We started off with a chicken mushroom soup, which was standard, and for starters, took a chicken satey, which was excellent. It came with a peanut sauce, which was very different in taste and it was a great combination. For the main course, we took a mixed fried rice, and a hupak chicken. The quantity was more than sufficient for three of us; the hupak chicken was quite soft, and good in taste. We then ordered darsan with ice cream for desserts, and that was good too, both in quality and quantity. Ambience of the place is good, with a lot of decor, and the seating arrangements are quite comfortable. Service is a bit amateurish and needs to be improved, but overall, the place is definitely worth a visit!!

After being recommended by my sister, I visited China Calling. It was a brilliant experience. Chicken Satey and Stuffed Crispy Prawn in the starters stole our heart away. The Seafood soup was out of the world and I highly recommend Chicken Tai Chi in the Main Course. The coriander fish, though ordered after much deliberation, turned out to be a pleasant experience. I must also put in a favourable word for a nice and warm welcome that was extended to us. In fact if you are planning a dine-in with your close family and friends, in a group of 15 - 20, China Calling has a nice tucked away nook where you can enjoy the comfort of privacy and sumptuous food at a very reasonable rate. All in all China Calling is a must visit for Chinese Food Lovers.

A new restaurant in the block, the place offers good chinese food! We went through a groupon offer and it was a real value for money. After welcome drinks, we ordered lemon coriander chicken soup and chicken manchow soup. Both were warm and good, though I prefer the former one more. For appetizer, we had chicken and cheese dimsums, served with sauces which were really good. Wish the hint of cheese could be a bit more in the dimsum. For main course, we had chicken tai chi and chkn ginger fried rice. The rice was standard and nothing special. The chicken was really tender. We ended with vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce which was standard but the presentation was nice.. worth visiting twice! -

Very Very Avoidable ... Nothing that we ordered could be called Good ... The Chicken Hot & Sour Soup was returned as it was extremely sour but they still charged for it. The Mixed Mei Fun was Horrible, The Golden Fried Prawns were just Batter, The Singapore Chilli Prawn was Tasteless,  The Mixed Cantonese Noodles were really Sad. No Chilled Soft Drinks were available & No Ice in this hot weather. They took ages to get the Bill & that too incomplete ... Nervous &!confused Service - what they did well was to Ruin our Sunday Lunch ... I would never go back there again !!!

Pathetic..Pathetic..Pathetic.I had the most horrible experience at this restaurant.Last week I had gone to this restaurant twice n both the times, to.my utter disappointment, I was served with wrong food. Both days I got food parcelled. On first day I had ordered for mix rice n a dish of prawn. Though the rice was good, but prawn was completely opposite of what I ordered, that to after I had repeatedly specified my requirements.The dish was below average in taste. But b'coz I liked d rice I thought of giving it another shot.The next day I went there n told them about the dish, they told me that I got what I had ordered n there was no mistake from there side.Still I thought there was some misunderstanding n went ahead with my order,cautioning them to take order properly this time.But what happened that day was unacceptable, b'coz they messed up each n every dish that day.Firstly I had ordered pan fried noodles n I got Cantonese gravy noodle b that to gravy was so less that I could not have the entire noodles.secondly I ordered fish which was supposed to be non spicy n white in color but it was redish black with lots of red chillies in it. Lastly coming to the chicken dish, God knows what it was b'coz it was simply bitter in taste.when I went back  there with the food to confront them, they were not ready to accept their fault n tried to defend themselves  n top of that, one of the owners(a fat guy) was so arrogant n rude, he sounded like a para ka mastaan.I mean really??? Is this the way u treat ur customers. I had spent close to 2000 bucks combining both days n this is wat I got in return. Owners, plz dont play with customers hard earned money.Restaurants n owners like these r a curse to the hospitality industry.

A sudden plan with a cousin led us to this joint for dinner. It is again a new addition to the list of restaurants. It is located at the lane just opposite to kamala girls' school,adjacent to vivekanada park. Ground floor of the building is renovated to open this new joint. It's a bit difficult to locate but the staffs are very helpful regarding this. A nice entrance and spacious interior. They have three sections of seating arrangements. It is ideal for large groups since most of the tables were six seaters. D√©cor was simple and seats were comfortable. I loved their menu card. It was available both in hard and soft copies. They have few tabs to show menu by which one can even place the order. Coming to the food,we went for roasted pork ribs for starter and it was insisted by the manager and i have to admit that it was a very good suggestion. Unlike served with mashed potato, it was just the pork and i truly loved it. Though a bit spicy, it was very soft and well cooked and tasted amazing. For main course we ordered chicken cantonese noodle and five spice lamb. I just loved the taste of noodles. It was full of vegetables and chicken pieces and less strong in flavour which went perfectly with the spicy lamb. Though the flavor was good in the lamb dish, it was hard and difficult to cut into pieces. Service was good. Price is reasonable. Since i couldn't taste some pork dishes due to unavailability, I'm coming back soon and this time I'll definitely taste the dessert.

An eclectic Chinese ambience, with minimalistic, and quaint decor coupled with brilliant cooking made way for a beautiful evening. The chef excels in Chinese cuisine, the chilli pork and chicken satay being the jewels of his crown. Convinience also wins in regard to the fact that chunky menu cards are replaced by tablets, from where your order is placed directly to the chef, and misinformed waiters are a thing of the past with information about every dish being provided through the same. 
Thumbs up!

Pathetic..Pathetic..Pathetic.I had the most horrible experience at this restaurant.Last week I had gone to this restaurant twice n both the times, to.my utter disappointment, I was served with wrong food. Both days I got food parcelled. On first day I had ordered for mix rice n a dish of prawn. Though the rice was good, but prawn was completely opposite of what I ordered, that to after I had repeatedly specified my requirements.The dish was below average in taste. But b'coz I liked d rice I thought of giving it another shot.The next day I went there n told them about the dish, they told me that I got what I had ordered n there was no mistake from there side.Still I thought there was some misunderstanding n went ahead with my order,cautioning them to take order properly this time.But what happened that day was unacceptable, b'coz they messed up each n every dish that day.Firstly I had ordered pan fried noodles n I got Cantonese gravy noodle b that to gravy was so less that I could not have the entire noodles.secondly I ordered fish which was supposed to be non spicy n white in color but it was redish black with lots of red chillies in it. Lastly coming to the chicken dish, God knows what it was b'coz it was simply bitter in taste.when I went back  there with the food to confront them, they were not ready to accept their fault n tried to defend themselves  n top of that, one of the owners(a fat guy) was so arrogant n rude, he sounded like a para ka mastaan.I mean really??? Is this the way u treat ur customers. I had spent close to 2000 bucks combining both days n this is wat I got in return. Owners, plz dont play with customers hard earned money.Restaurants n owners like these r a curse to the hospitality industry.

A sudden plan with a cousin led us to this joint for dinner. It is again a new addition to the list of restaurants. It is located at the lane just opposite to kamala girls' school,adjacent to vivekanada park. Ground floor of the building is renovated to open this new joint. It's a bit difficult to locate but the staffs are very helpful regarding this. A nice entrance and spacious interior. They have three sections of seating arrangements. It is ideal for large groups since most of the tables were six seaters. D√©cor was simple and seats were comfortable. I loved their menu card. It was available both in hard and soft copies. They have few tabs to show menu by which one can even place the order. Coming to the food,we went for roasted pork ribs for starter and it was insisted by the manager and i have to admit that it was a very good suggestion. Unlike served with mashed potato, it was just the pork and i truly loved it. Though a bit spicy, it was very soft and well cooked and tasted amazing. For main course we ordered chicken cantonese noodle and five spice lamb. I just loved the taste of noodles. It was full of vegetables and chicken pieces and less strong in flavour which went perfectly with the spicy lamb. Though the flavor was good in the lamb dish, it was hard and difficult to cut into pieces. Service was good. Price is reasonable. Since i couldn't taste some pork dishes due to unavailability, I'm coming back soon and this time I'll definitely taste the dessert.

An eclectic Chinese ambience, with minimalistic, and quaint decor coupled with brilliant cooking made way for a beautiful evening. The chef excels in Chinese cuisine, the chilli pork and chicken satay being the jewels of his crown. Convinience also wins in regard to the fact that chunky menu cards are replaced by tablets, from where your order is placed directly to the chef, and misinformed waiters are a thing of the past with information about every dish being provided through the same. 
Thumbs up!

China Calling!! An ultimate place for hanging out with your friends and family. The food was delicious & the d√©cor is awesome. 

Unique thing that I saw in their restaurant is that they provide you a tablet for placing the order; it is easier for us to review the items in the dish. A must to go restaurant for having authentic Chinese food.

Good restaurant to enjoy Chinese food, loved ambiance, decor and food specially "Standing Pom-fret". Special point of attraction was use of a new technology....what they call it is Digital Menu Card, Restaurant provides tab to customer to view menu card and can place the order themselves .This is something very new and exciting in Kolkata restaurant, Its really nice :)

In short I liked the place.
Specially the pattern in which u have to place the order like after going there they gave us a tab we were just to c the food items dere and order from the tab only no waiter were coming to take the order they only came to serve.
Now the ambience was also good like better than average but not the best.
Coming to the price I think that the quality,quantity & amount spent is more that enough i.e value for money at least for the items I had.
Now coming to food the chicken mushroom soup we ordered was good. Then the fish starter was also good but a bit less fried. Then came chicken rice and lamb both the preparations were good but then again I loved the lamb a bit more.
Then the fried ice cream to be true this was the only item I was not at all satisfied with. The taste was oke types but the taste of the outer coating was below average.
But then again there was Darsan and yeah it was pretty good...

Tucked away in a quiet South Kolkata by-lane, this fascinating restaurant needs to be discovered soon by those looking for quality Chinese food.
The quality and the quantity justify any amount spent.
Another unique feature is the constant presence of the people who set it all up. You are assured of special attention.
Try the ROAST CHILLY PORK! You'll want to go back again and again.
But, please do not miss out on the other yummies!

Absolutely no chance to reduce any point for this place. Chowmin and fried rice both has the authentic chinese smell will surely stimulate your appetite. The quality of fish and size of prawn is too good. And above all this place is very pocket friendly. You should atleast once try the Chinese dishes here.
