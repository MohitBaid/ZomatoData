Situated near satyanarayan park AC Market just 3-4 walking from my home. This was an sweet shop cum snacks dine in outlet. In ground floor they serve sweets. It was takeaway  only area and in first floor there is dine in area for indian and Chinese snacks. I'm not try their snacks yet but tried many of their sweets like bhandhari ladoo which was Traditional Rajasthani sweet which they make perfectly and it tastes delicious, dil khushal which was also made perfectly and tastes good and I tried their some more sweets all were freshly made and tastes really nice. In my recent visit I take Malai Ghewar from here which was ravishing looking and tastes heavenly delicious. A must try place. Highly recommended to all specially for their sweets..
