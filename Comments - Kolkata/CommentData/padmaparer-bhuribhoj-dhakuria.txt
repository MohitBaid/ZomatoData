Having pampered the tastebuds of people, residing in the Gariahat Golpark area for a long time, , the renowned culinary destination, Padmaparer Rannaghor now has drove past the busy Dhakuria Overbridge to set up a new outlet. Curiously named, Padmaparer Bhuribhoj is following the culinary legacy with elan. 
An array of bengali delicacies with the accompaniment of some popular chinese dishes will fill your tummy and spread cheer to your bland tastebuds!
The evergreen Bhetki Paturi, the steaming Mutton kosha, Pompfret Fry and other mouthwatering dishes taste just grand. 
I highly recommend this restaurant to all.
