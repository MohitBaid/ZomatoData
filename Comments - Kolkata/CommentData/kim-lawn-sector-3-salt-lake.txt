Last night came home very tired and hungry and tried for home delivery. Found most places on Sunday night had their delivery staff out and the lesser ones were closing down. Luckily Kim Lawn accepted and the food came in, timely, five minutes before 10pm, which I pounced upon. My hunger perhaps has influenced my review.
Chicken Chowmein [Hakka]
Stir Fried Mushrooms
Chicken Bharta [which incidentally always goes well with chow in fusion].
As a previous reviewer for this place has stated – let’s be realistic and do the grading on the basis of value for money. And of course without bending the rules for hygiene and wholesomeness.
I give the pluses and minuses.
First the former.
Delivery – good. Properly packed and hot.
Not greasy at all.
Fresh and wholesome.
Generous portions. Huge for the chow. Adequate for the chicken bharta, and for the stir fried mushrooms, which were button mushrooms sliced nicely large, I would say the quantity was just fine.
There was a 15% off offer.
Now the minuses.
Chow and mushrooms – bland taste, and no seasoning to speak of, apart from one half of a whole Star Anise, my bug-bear, and recent aberration of local Chinese food these days. Did some trader bring in a large consignment recently?
No sauces were sent, though one had enough at home to compensate.
The bharta consisted of diced chicken in a gravy, and while not a bharta was okay as food.
Overall rating is 3 from me. Useful to keep bookmarked in need.

I was sceptical about ordering from this place owing to the current review 2.7. I went ahead with the order because it is a joint running for a long time now. I ordered 1 Mixed Rice, 1 Chilly Chicken and 1 Mixed Thai Soup. The quantity was enough for one person but would be a little less for two. The quality of the food was better than expected. Even though there was no ‘wow’ factor, the food did not disappoint. Mediocre would be the perfect word to describe it. Delivery was about 15 minutes late. The rice they use is of a thick variety, had they used a thin variety of rice i would have given the 4. The soup was not like the famous tangda thai soup but it wasnt bad either. The pieces of chilly chicken was also medium sized and was moderately tender. Note: This review is as a user and not a critic. 

Verdict: Would not mind ordering again but there are better joints at the same price.

If anyone ask me I would suggest not to visit or order from this shop..food quality is what makes a resturant worth to visit but in recent years their quality has degraded drastically.. It may be other things in the menu may be good but whatever I have tasted has disappointed me..

Very very ordinary restaurant: The food taste, quality, value for money, ambience, service, each and every single aspect needs to improve a lot.
Having the privilege of being an old eating joint at the heart of Salt Lake for several years, the apparent mediocrity needs to disappear ASAP, if it wants to compete wholeheartedly with the other eateries.

This is  a very old restaurant just opposite to the salt lake stadium gate.Earlier when very few restaurants  were present in Sector 3,this place was worth mentioning for their chinese food but now a days the quality has degraded and even tne ambience of this place is shabby enough to not attract customers.Recently gave a try and ordered mixed hakka noodles and chicken with babycorn and mushroom via home deliverythrough Zomato.Delivery was in time and the food was well packed and hot.The taste of the noodles was fine and has ample amount of chicken and prawn throughout.But unlike Chinese restaurants  they use those thin chowmien noodles instead of the proper thick egg noodles which was not satisfying.Coming to he chicken dish it was absolutely horrendous.Half of the container was filled with soggy batter of the chicken mushroom and babycorn mixed with a sweet ketchup base.There was very little of the actual ingredients.I have tried other side dishes from this place too and they actually use too much ketchup in all their ite,s making things very sweet.So for me,this was the last and final try,not going back to this place again.

Great food. That's all I can say. It's also an incredibly cheap place to eat out. Most of the people will not like this place as the concept of eating out at plush restaurants are an in thing now. They will pay more and more on food and taxes for something that can be easily called trash.

A very very ordinary place to dine in. This is located just opposite to the gate no. 1 of Saltlake Stadium. One sunday evening, four of us went there to try out some starters. They have seating arrangements both in the ground floor as well as in the first floor. We chose to sit in the first floor. Its a small place which will accomodate around 30-40 people at the same time. 
We ordered one plate of garlic fish dry, one plate of pepper chicken, one plate of golden fried chicken and one 600 ml thumps up bottle.
Each of these dishes had 8 pcs so it became easier for us to distribute amongst four of us.
All three dishes were average out of which pepper chicken was comparatively better.
All of these cost us around 700 something.

What : A GOOD CHINESE RESTAURANT.
Where : Sec 3 Salt lake, just opposite Bengal Tennis Association's gate.
When : We visited the restaurant in the evening.
Pocket pinch : Rs 400+ for 2 (with various items)

Ambience : It was my first visit in the restaurant and for the summer evening we preferred their outside chairs on the open street. So I can't be able to review it. Its a small restaurant, very neat and clean as seen from outside,so inside must be good.

Food : 1. Ordered Chicken roll (as it is very famous among the locals) and we instantly liked it. Very tasty,chickens inside were smooth and what caught my eyes more that the paratha was less oily. (rating 8 on 10)
             2. Chicken chowmein was above average,but not very good as reviewed. But the best thing is,in every food I have noticed that oils were very less. The chowmein was tasty with added chicken pieces as requested.  (rating 7 on 10)
              3. Fish Manchurian was the best of all. After a bite you can easily feel the taste of original betki fish. It was very tasty with thin coats on the fishes. Hit item here. (rating 10 on 10)

Management : As we sat outside and chatting with friends, there were very little scoap of managing anything, we arranged all chairs as per our comforts. But as it is a good old restaurant in this area,the management must be okay.

Why recommended : For the rolls. You ll not find such a fine roll in salt lake area @ that cheap rate. So,go for it.

Okay at best, their noodles and chili chicken are perhaps the best options. Momos are decent but the overall service is sub par.

Ambience is not too great either but for what it's worth I recommend ordering in, their times are quick.

Have bought long thick rolls from their takeout counter. Their rolls sure can satiate your cravings for street food as well as your burning hunger. If you are starved and you eat their roll, it would taste like ambrosia, food of the gods. But if one is looking for some spicy, zesty roll with the right hint of tang, masala and rich filling then one would be disappointed.

After having a long bike ride we decided to have some quick bite on the way. So as we were looking for some place to eat kim lawn arrived.
Its a small place but with good food. The service was good. Staff was courteous.
We ordered Chicken momo's and Chicken rolls.
Momo's were served hot along with red sauce. Tasted good.
The rolls could have been much better. The filling tasted bland.

Momos should be tried.
Roll quality is to be looked upon.

Pocket friendly affair.

A small yet very decent restaurant near the hyatt area. Went there today around the early evening,so the place was totally empty.
Since we couldn't detect the exact location of this joint,we called them up a couple of times and the staff was really kind and generous to help us track this place down. We reached there really exhausted after a long and hot day,so the air conditioner did its trick and cooled us down. The place isn't very well decorated but is moderate and decent enough to grab a quick bite. The table mats were plastic mats that had worn out with age and was also torn and folded in the corners. Anyway these petty issues didn't keep us from enjoying their food. We scanned the menu card and ordered 1 chicken fried rice and 1 plate garlic chicken. Food took maximum 10mins to appear since the place was totally empty so ours was the only order and there wasn't any rush. In the mild,clean and quiet environment,we started off with our meal. The fried rice had enough quantity and filled our appetite. It was prepared with very less amount of oil so in a way it was much healthier. The small chicken chunks along with eggs was really savored by me. The garlic chicken though was only satisfactory. It came with 8 pieces but the chicken seemed a bit over fried...almost to the extent of being burnt on the sides. The gravy though was garlicky and was accompanied with spring onions,which seemed very well cooked. Both the dishes very well complimented each other.
Prices are absolutely pocket friendly. Overall,a very nice eatery for quick bites.

My favorite para Chinese rank # 3. Here's why:

1) Tucked away neatly yet prominently opposite Salt Lake Stadium, easy to locate.
2) Mostly empty, imparts a strange sense of privacy and aloofness.
3) Prompt and indifferent service - adds to the deliciously cold, private, aloof ambience - great place to hook up or break up secretly over a steaming bowl of soup, stirred lingeringly. (They pack too).
4) Great para Chinese to quieten a heavy-duty stomach rumble - generous portion size, awesome taste, not too high on grease factor. 
5) Incredibly pocket-friendly.

Reviewer's Tip: Order for the ubiquitous chowmeeen-cheely cheeken please!

Its been one of the old restaurant s of saltlake specially when there was nothing much in saltlake.It serves Chinese and Indian food which is very pocket friendly so you can go in a group or family and surely you will find a satisfaction for the food you get there.And lastly its located very much  close to the stadium so should nt be a problem to search it.
My verdict -A definite yes

Kim lawn is a very o.k. restaurant. Like everything about it is o.k. be it the food,service or the ambience.Nothing great. The best part of kim lawn is it's pricing which is very pocket friendly and the quantity is overwhelming. The place is nice if you or your friends don't have enough money and you are really hungry. It's a typical go-to restaurant. It's not a place where u plan and go but it's the one which you and your friends suddenly spot,u r hungry and u enter to have a quick economical lunch.
