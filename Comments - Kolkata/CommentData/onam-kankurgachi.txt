Nice decent place with a decent atmosphere. The quality of food is pretty good, clean and hygienic. I love the dosa sold here, specially the Masala Dosa with onion.
I have also tried out soup here and that's also nice. If you are a vegetarian, do come to this place...you won't be unsatisfied.

I ordered a cheese masala dosa through zomato. The price after the restaurant discount of 15%, delivery charge and GST was 127. And guess what, they took a good 55 minutes to deliver one dosa. My house is hardly 1km away from the restaurant. 
Needless to say, the food was all cold. The dosa had quite little cheese, considering they took 30 extra for it. The sambhar, white coconut chutney, red chutney were decent. A yellow chutney they gave tasted quite bad, it smelled quite weird too. The aloo masala was decent too, but again the sambhar, dosa, masala all were totally cold and the dosa went soggy.

Onam is located just opposite to VIP Market back side area. This place is cozy and attentive to the customer in that area. Ambiance of this place is bright and beautiful. It has 24 sitting capacity for its customer. There service is slowly but the staffs are efficient.
There menu consist South Indian, North Indian, Continental and Mexican food.
In all of this I had South Indian food (cheese masala Dosa). Their food presentation was nice and the quality & quantity of food was well enough but it's taste is not up to the mark or tasteless. This place is not worthy in terms of money as it is a bit costly.

Though the noodle filled dosa struggles to meet up to the expectations, the masala dosa and the authentic sambar vada were undoubtedly great. The pineapple flavoured chutney is a bonus. Will definitely recommend this restaurant.

Well, a recently opened outlet bang opposite the VIP Market, Kankurgachi, a first visit to it, a comedy of errors followed by a sweet ending!

I ordered a take-away and the unending waiting time was just killing me ‚Äì service is pretty slow and disorganized. It was a busy Sunday, and they failed to impress the diners owing to their poor service quality! They often missed out on serving additional cutlery, abiding to customer preferences, cleaning the tables ‚Äì all signs of an inexperienced group of people running the outlet!

What happened to me was unthinkable, they handed over somebody else‚Äôs parcel to me!!!!!!!!!!

The trauma unfolded once I reached home and started unpacking my stuff, only to realize that I had been conned (joking!). However, a simple phone call to them and they delivered the correct parcel to my place within 10 minutes!

The following items were gorged by the hungry me:-

(i)	Rava masala dosa ‚Äì glad that some outlet has come up, which is not far from my place and also serves such tasty rava masala ‚Äì 1 of my favourites

(ii)	Sambhar vada ‚Äì good one

(iii)	Victoria vada ‚Äì A major turn off ‚Äì especially when consumed after tasting the superb rava masala

(iv)	Dhokla ‚Äì pretty tasy ‚Äì great on presentation as well

(v)	Club kachori ‚Äì Pretty crisp, served with very tasty aloo ki subzi

(vi)	Idly ‚Äì Fine

They serve the below with their South Indian delicacies:-

(a)	Sambhar (obviously) ‚Äì which is just fine, nothing great

(b)	Pudina chutney ‚Äì good, but not great

(c)	White (Coconut) chutney ‚Äì Fine

(d)	Yellow (Sattu) chutney ‚Äì a winner, 1 of the best chutneys to eat, especially, since it was sweet.

(e)	Red (Garlic) chutney ‚Äì we simply threw it away ‚Äì I had specifically refused this being served to us since it was Navratri, but they served this to me carelessly!

Prices are not very high ‚Äì but staff need much more coaching and feedback! Overall, expect good food and funny service!

Not worth the money. They are charging Rs 90 for a masala dosa! Which I found pointless. The quality of dosa was not bad but I didn't like the presentation and the dosa was not crispy at all. They served the dosa and masala separately!! They provided 6 types of chatnis which was okay.

I ordered dosa and pesto pasta via swiggy, delivery was prompt and pasta was okayish (though it was just cheesy sauce, not pesto by any stretch of imagination), but the South Indian grub was pathetic, no sign of any south indian seasoning or even a curry leaf. I see no reason why they could not get it right. The coconut chutney had the texture and smell of custard! Better steer clear from their south indian fare!

The delivery took more than 1.5 hours and this place is in kankurgachi which is just 15mins away from my location. When I placed the order for club kachori  and jalebi  I was called by the restaurant to confirm my order and I was assured it will be deliver in 20minutes. The delivery guy took another 15mins to find my location after trying to explain to him several times where he needs to come.  Which normally would have been OK given its difficult  to understand locations but then after waiting for 1.5 hours it was pretty annoying explain my location almost three times.  I had used the chat service and they did what they could do.  But if you want to try this place make sure you order food two hours in advance.  

Coming to the food. The kachori sabzi  was good and nicely packed.  However I didn't like the jalebi  much.
