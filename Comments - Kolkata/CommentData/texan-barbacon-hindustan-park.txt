Texan Barbacon, though the place is named Texan, we expected a bit more texan feel in the ambience. However apart from that, the ambience is good and quiet on its own. Bacon wrapped prawns, grilled chicken and open sloppy joe thats what we had ordered. No complains at all. Good ones as it should be. I was kinda bored of munching McD burgers and for a change we risked this place for trying out. Worth all the money for us. I would suggest that they should start serving chilled beer to match up their wonderful live performances. In a word loved it texan barbacon

Awesome place to hangout in weekends.  The food is really delicious. The service and their hospitality is really good. The worst part of most of the pubs in their long waiting time. I mean they takes so long that when the food will arive u might forget what you actually ordered. Bt in there TB's case its not like that you dont have to wait for long.  I must say they are really efficient to serve you the good food really quick. And you know what is the best part. The live music and stand up comedy. The ambience was really awesome. This place is a must visit in this holidays.

Bad food. Bad ambience. NO KARAOKE. NO LIVE MUSIC. 
We ordered a soup and a sizzler. Both we terrible. And don't let their digital menu food you. It's running Android KitKat and is slow as ever.

New Years Eve I had visited this new born baby of kolkata with a lot of Expectation. One of my friend had visited on 31st and got alcohol. I was too looking for it, but later on came to know that it was  actually a special arrangement done by them for 31st. Anyhoo we had ordered juicy succulent bacon wrapped prawns, American Stuffed Cheese Burger, Open Sloppy Joe, Pork Chops. My O My...Loved every bit of it. Wish I could get more cheese dripping from my burger(my cheat day it was).
Virign margarita popsicle could have been bit more flavor infused though. Overall TBB did not disappoint us at all and would love to come back for sure.
P.S. oh did I miss that we had been ordering their Chinese dishes(as all bangalis random evening snacks) through swiggy quite a few days. These Texan guys must have hired a good Cantonese Chef I must say. It is delicious and light. Superlike guys, keep on rocking.

Newly opened American cafe.  Provides good service and delicious food in a reasonable price within the budget. Very quick service and maintains a class. In my review it's a best place to have food with friends and family.

Do you have loads of time and patience? Then you can visit this place. Or else, steer clear of this place folks. 

Located in Hindustan Park, this restaurant is a new addition to that neighbourhood. The decor is nothing too fancy but what could‚Äôve been the highlight of this place actually is the saddest thing about it. 
They tried to be technologically advanced and introduced the ordering via a tablet from your table system, and guess what the tablets literally suck the joy out of the whole dining experience. It takes ages for a page to open, and the touch doesn‚Äôt respond. And to review your order, it takes another decade. You completely lose the mood to order or to eat. And that‚Äôs exactly what happened to us. So we ended up ordering just a drink and a starter. 

Coming to the food, we ordered a pinacolada and buffalo style chicken wings. The pinacolada was a complete disaster. It lacked the taste of coconut milk completely. Just felt like pineapple crush with milk. When we informed the bartender, he offered to change it, but second time around, it wasn‚Äôt any better. My friend wanted a drink so we settled for it anyway. The buffalo wings however were very tasty, juicy and very nice. 

Then comes the billing, fancy place couldn‚Äôt go old school with the card machines.. so their new compact card machines don‚Äôt work either.. three failed tries later we had to finally pay by paytm. 

In short, if this place doesn‚Äôt improve its overall dining experience, it‚Äôs doomed for good. No second time here for me. As for your first try, think ten times. ;)

This newly opened American cafe didn't disappoint food wise. We ordered:
1. Pan Fried Chilli Fish: It was really fresh, crispy and delicious.
2. Tangy Buffalo Sauce Chicken wings: There was the distinct flavour of Buffalo Sauce as well as a slight tangy taste, on the deliciously smoked wings.
3. Litchi Fish mocktail: A mocktail that tastes like it is named and is beautifully presented. This was very impressive.
4. Virgin Margharita Popsicles: This is something new and definitely on the must try list.
I feel this place is worth visiting at least once,maybe even twice. The Ambience is quite good with all the musical vibes. Service is fine too, although the high tech ordering screens installed tend not to work due to lack of server speed. They had introductory Happy hours when we visited, so that was quite nice.

Fresh review from fresh visit; this is a new kid in town located in Hindustan Park just beside Sudipa'r Rannaghar. Since it is a very new place finding out flaws in first visit, would not be right. They have introduced the system of ordering food through tabs attached with every table, well that worked good.

We opted for Chicken Chop Salad, Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Sauteed Vegetables and Fresh Lime Soda. The salad was good with succulent chicken cubes mixed with cheese. From the Grilled Chicken Platter, I enjoyed mashed potatoes more than the chicken ( the chicken was not that succulent and was bit chewy). I hope next time this thing will improve.

They have place for live music too. Also, they provide discount if your bill is above 750. Overall a good place to visit. Hope to see visit again.

Best of luck Team Texan BarBacon !!

As didnt found anything new or not much suggested by the staffs we havent take the main course , but one of their staff came and suggested a dessert which is very tasty food is good , as we gone on saturday eve , we were expecting some live perfrmnc as told by them , there wr instruments we waited till 8:50 as they said it starts from 8 but we havent seen any live music , hope you will include sonething new in your menu and i hope i get a bttr sugsn next time .

Best place to chill out and relax yourself. A place which has got ample capabilities to cheer your mood up. Working crew are so cooperative and polite. The ambience resembles that of a American pub. A pinch in the pocket of course. If you want to be a part of some live music + good food and spend some time with your besties. This is a must visit place for sure.

We ordered the grilled chicken and the pork chops, both of which were done very well.   Portions were generous and the pocket-pinch not too bad.  Will get food again!
