If you are a ice cream lover you better hit that place. A very small joint at city centre 2 mall. They make customized ice cream cones and waffle cups . You will get so many ice cream flavors and toppings to choose. The cone comes with one single scoop of ice cream whereas waffle cups comes with two scoops of ice cream.
I had customized my ice cream in crispy chocolate waffle cone with rainbow sprinkle, cookie dough flavored ice cream and chocolate ganache. The combination was so good and it delighted every corner of my mouth.

A bunch of happiness with a waffle is sure to sound tempting‚ù§
They serve you with wide range of varieties of icecream in different flavours and with different range of toppings from a wide list of such.
Tastes good .
Price is not that much high.

Had a Toffee caramel ice cream. Tasted delicious. You get a large scoop of ice cream in a tall cone. Worth the price. This one is located just infront of the Food court on the fourth floor at the DCN mall. Custom made ice cream is also available.

Small outlet in Rajarhat CC2. Service was quick though the ice cream which I tried failed to impress me. Tried the oreo cream and fudge and I was expecting it to be much better in terms of presentation and taste at that price.

The only qualm I have about this place is that it ain't anything like the one they have at South City. South City outlet serves better Ice Creams. I don't know how that is possible. But they do. Skip this one. Go to South City.

Visited CREAM & FUDGE multiple times and this is my favourite ice cream joint. Have tried a lot of flavours here, my personal favourite is Raspberry‚Äã.
The best thing about them is the creamy texture of their ice cream which melts to each and every corner of your mouth and their cone is best according to me.
In the picture SWISS CHOCOLATE.
Service is good and the pocket pinch is high but keeping in mind the taste and feel it's worth the money.

I have tried Rocky Road from this small joint at the ground floor of City Centre 2. Service was good and very quick however the taste and the quality of the one I ordered somehow failed to impress. I must say the regular sized one is pretty big and ice-cream was full of nuts but they do not go with the simple chocolate flavour.

Literally though, if you're looking for good ice cream in Kolkata, you should according to me, go for this brand. Their waffle cones are perfect and their ice cream is super creamy. You also get to choose from several flavours and combinations. Cheaper than gelato or Mama Mia. My favourites include, mint and choco chip, cookie dough and sweet cream.

Have been to Cream and Fudge multiple times as it our favourite ice cream place and our favourite flavour is the raspberry which is absolutely amazing.There are other flavours like strawberry and banana which are also very good.The best thing about their ice cream is the texture and it melts beautifully in the mouth and is also quite thick.Though the price is a little on the higher side but it is worth every penny given its taste.

Icecream is not just ice cream. It's an emotion. One of the best place to find your choice of ice cream is cream and fudge factory. Though the price range is high for a cup of ice cream or for a cone, but you will love the mixture of smell and every bite of ice cream. I had gurnished choco crunch in a cup. And it costed Rs 220.

One of the best hangout place for all dessert lovers especially ice cream lovers.This place is famous for its smooth, soft and flavoured Wide variety of ice-cream.
I have tried many of its ice creams, all are good but its blackforest icecream is my favourite. Presentation is just adorable and service is quite fast and customer friendly.Rates are a bit high but its worth it all keeping in mind its ambience, quality, taste, service.

Located inside city center 1, this is a small outlet with no secluded sitting area as such. The man at the counter knows his stuff. Thank god for that. The ice creams are delicious. And each of them has a very individualistic flare, both in taste and presentation. Nothing run-of-the-mill about the ice creams, this is one thing that I really like about this place. Prices are on the higher range.

We had choclate and strwbry heaven in waffle. Chocolate and strwbry ice cream didn't had much flavour itself. The strwbry jelly which they used for mixing and garnishing, was too sour.
But I must admit that the stuffs here are quite curteous.
Not sure will try this oultet again!! Walls or mama mia would be a wiser choice
