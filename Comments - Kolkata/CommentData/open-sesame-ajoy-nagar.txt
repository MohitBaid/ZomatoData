This small outlet is a savior whenever you want Chinese with low pocket pinch. Located on the 1st floor of Unnayan market complex, beside BRWS. The seating area is nearly 10-12. But they also offer home delivery and that's a boon. Almost tried all the items but their schezwan rice is surprisingly great. The delivery time is also good. This budget friendly restaurant is a hidden gem of this locality.

Every neighbourhood needs a budget Chinese delivery place and Open Sesame happens to be ours.
Ordered mixed fried rice and chilli chicken with gravy. The fried rice was surprisingly good. Chilli chicken was bland though. The quantity is great for the prices they charge. Delivery time is also good.

It's probably the best place to order Chinese . Though the ambience of open sesame itself isn't worth a shot, but the food quality and taste is probably the best in range and our people from our colony(Udita) keep ordering stuff on a daily basis! The veg Manchurian and chicken noodles and the schezwan chilli chicken are some of the best dishes here!

this place knows me from years now, and somedays even i dont feel like cooking or after cooking one half of the meal, i get lazy. so i pick up the phone and say 144, and they know the rest. before there used to be a gaming shop right opposite to eat and before i got myself exported, lol, almost evryday while gaming 4-5 pf us used to take a break after 2-3 hrs normally around 1600 hrs and go hog here. One of my friend had moved to australia and first thing we talk about is chicken lung fung soup, the only thing he will always take for yrs in row. when ever we all are in the country together we make sure we pay a visit before we get exported again. This time am home a little longer so i guess i will get to eat a little more :)

Restaurants like this one are a saviour for people like me who don't like to cook but love to eat. Tasty Chinese food at a cheap price and you don't want to step out of your house - order at open sesame and your conditions will be met. I love their mixed fried rice and schezwan rice and schezwan fish. Love it!! Oh and while placing the order do ask them do be a bit more benevolent with the green chili sauce they give, that is really spicy and yummy and they seem to be real miser about it....teehee!!! ðŸ˜‹

I have tried the Chinese items that they have. Food was delivered so no clue about the ambiance but must try is the pepper chicken. I prefer fried rice over noodles so my vote goes to the chicken fried rice, good quantity with chunky pieces of chicken. Both the steamed and pan fried momos are really good and should be tried.

When you are in a mood for Kolkata style Chinese that is good on quality and quantity and yet does not burn a huge hole in your pocket this is your place to be. This is a small joint and offers free home delivery in the vicinity. Their momos (steamed) are soft and succulent. The fish fry is full of fish and is a life savior if you have sudden visitors at home. The regular Chinese fare is good too unless you expect gourmet.

I eat here a lot coz this place is just 2 mins from my home. Hence, i've tried practically everything on the menu and everything is pretty tasty . I love the hot and sour soup they make . The pan fried momos are really yummy.  The gravy noodles and honey chicken are my favorites. Cheap food and great quantity.

OK. So this is one of my old favorites. We often order food from here and till date have never been disappointed. Though the restaurant space is quite small, it is ideal for home delivery. Love their Cantonese Chow and Oyster Chicken. This is definitely a must for us during party season and durga puja. Have again ordered today. Waiting to have a delicious and decadent meal.

As classic location for a quick and easy dinner. 
If you're feeling peckish for some pocket-friendly tangra style Chinese food, getting take-out from Open Sesame might be the way to go.  

Food -  (4/5) Delivers a classic version of the 'Indianized' Chinese food that we have all grown up eating. 

Value - (5/5) Short on cash but don't want to shovel down garbage? Say no more and give Open Sesame a ring. Good food for unbelievably less and moreover, love the quantity. 

Ambience & Location - (2/5) Lack of accommodation and terrible location make it really easy to miss. 

Suggestions - Do try the mixed fried rice, drums of heaven and garlic chicken. It is recommended that you order food since the restaurant itself lacks sufficient accommodation and is certainly no eye candy.

What do you do when you  just have 200 bucks lying in ur purse? When ur home alone and starving for some food yummy Chinese food? Or when you had this usual "tiff" with your mum and shes too mad at you to cook your dinner? You call at "open sesame"!! (Okay, maybe its just me who does this)..jokes apart "open sesame" is by far the most inexpensive and good food guaranteed joint I have come across. You get tasty Chinese food at an surprising low price. My favorite is the "mixed hakka noodles " and "Cantonese chicken", and not to forget the ever so yummy "momos". A must try on the "chilly garlic potatoes". The joint is pretty small so home delivery is a better option. The quantity is ample and two people can have sufficient even with one plate of noodles..
Cost for two (with a healthy appetite like me) 500 bucks.
P.s.: they are really sweet when I ask for extra sauce packets for my momo and I gt enough to even bathe in it :-p

Whenever am at Udita at my bff's place or nearby for something, i go and grab a quick bite at Open Sesame, most know about Gossip in this area but Open Sesame is the more popular home delivery joint. The place has no ambiance other than a small joint with three tables, few chairs, taking home delivery is always a better option. The food of this place is really nice. The fish fingers and fish fry are a delight, they use good quality fish and makes the fries soft with less batter and more fish. Their chilli chicken dry and babycorn dry are also nice. Noodles, Rice, Chopsuey i have had it all and can vouch for it. Main course you can order fish, prawns and chicken. Hygine is maintained. All in all, a really nice place, chinese is good here and price is comfortable.

I always order home delivery from this place when I visit my grandma at the Bengal Ambuja Udita complex. And both of us love the food. They home deliver soups which is a good thing and service is always on time! I like their chicken hot and sour soup a lot. And my grandma's favourite is their fish fry. They are not just a tiny fillet of fish in too much bread crumbs. They are soft and come with a generous amount of fish in them!
P.S.: As on date 04.01.2015, the chicken cutlet of Open Sesame is the best I ever had! Must try for all.

SAY OPEN SESAME TO SOME TASTY TREATS! - 3 out of 5

Open Sesame definitely opens up a box of treasures or pleasurable tasty treats. This is one food joint that does not promote itself as much as it should but lets it food do the talking. It is located very near Survey Park and it's on the busy E.M. Bypass stretch. In terms of ambience and decor, it is not a Beijing or Big Boss but will suffice for a visit. The restaurant is plain looking and provides comfortable sitting arrangements. However, they do turn out some genuine and reasonably priced Chinese food.

They serve excellent and piping hot soups at reasonable prices. Their soup items, namely chicken wanton soup, chicken hot and sour soup and Thai soup (we had non veg) deserve a special mention in this review. The soups were well made with a good amount of seasoning. After savoring their tasty soup dishes we moved on to their fried rice and chow items. One thing about their fried rice items is that they do not taste dry on the palate. The quantity of both their rice dishes and noodle items were generous and stomach filling. Their non veg chow and rice items had a generous amount of meat in them. 

When we were having wet noodles they did not taste soggy. As side dishes, stick to regular dishes like chilli chicken, chilli fish and Sichuan prawn. Be warned, these dishes can be very spicy on their delicate palate. Alternatively, their honey chicken and sweet and sour prawn went well with the rice and noodle dishes we had. The gravy in the sweet and sour dish was thick and the prawn themselves were juicy and tender. Not only is the food service at the restaurant quick and prompt but apparently their home delivery service is lightning fast as well.
