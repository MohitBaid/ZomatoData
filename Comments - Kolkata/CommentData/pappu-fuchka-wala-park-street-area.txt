This is situated in Russell Street.
It's a stall type with no sitting arrangenents although is quite hygienic.
Tried their Phuchka, which had tasty stuffings and was lip smacking. They serve Phuchka both in sour and sweet water. 

Recommended.....

Pappu Fuchka Wala is just beside the Bombay Dying Showroom in Russel Street. This guy Pappu makes really good Fuchkas. Her serves 3 for Rs.10 but his quality is really good. All the fuchkas are good in size and perfect to taste.

Situated in Russell street of park Street area in front of Bombay Dieying showroom. A thela with no sitting arrangement but maintained hygiene. Served puchna, churmur and aloo chat. Price was reasonable and service was fast. I tried their puchka which cost â‚¹10 for 3 little high compare to normal puchkawala rates. Taste was really good. Crispy puchka which stuffed with smashed spicy masala aloo and filled with tangy sour pani or mitha pani. Very tasty. Must try. Recommended.

They serve 3 puchkas for Rs.10 which I think is expensive as compared to some other puchkawalas in the city. However the puchkas are crisp and crunchy and comes with a well seasoned potato stuffing. There are options for sour and sweet water. The sour water is tangy and spicy. A complete delight to my taste buds. Keeps the area clean so hygiene is not a concern. Also makes churmur and aloo chaat. Must stop by for these if you are in the area. Don't confuse him with the other puchkawala in the area. He sits right next to the muriwala next to bombay dyeing.
