The food quality is very poor... I am having food in this restaurant for many years... Their food quality is decreasing day by day... Fish finger is not made of original vetki or basa.... Its just rare quality bhola fish....Do not choose it for food.... Liquor price is also very high... Comparing to this debonair is far better..

Here in the menu card the picture showing the lowest cost of the beer is Rs 150. If u visit the restura, then their on the menu card it is written Rs 190, but the waiter will definitely let you know that the price was upgraded to Rs 220 but still not updated on their menu card. So the beer price is Rs 220

Maharaja is located on Jessore road, a popular bar cum restaurant in DumDum. I had a chance to visit this place with one of my friends staying in Dumdum. We planned earlier to go to Park street for a week end party, but we had to cancel this plan due to late hour work and we landed up in Maharaja.

Though, this is quite a well known bar cum restaurant in Dumdum, I did not like the ambiance of this place.  My friend was just keen to dine here and I had to go for my friend.

Anyways, once we settled down, we checked the Menu. I noticed the prices and they were quite reasonable compared to my South Kolkata hanging zone, but the place is not much standard or sophisticated. So, I did not like the place to spend long hours!

Regular hangout for us. Food is of good quality specially sahi chicken and biriyani . Restaurant is good but only allowed if you have a female companion. If any of you wanna have conversation or any of your family friend is not drinker or smoker he must also sit in the bar. Even on repeated request i was denied entry to the restaurant and one waiter pointed out that if you don't drink or smoke that is your discredit. Was shocked at this answer. But if you wanna have a good food and you and your companion are alcoholic and both can tolerate thick smoke its the best place to be.

Maharaja restaurant is situated on Jessore Road at Central Jail bus stand. It is a well known restaurant in that area. There is a family section and a bar section separately. The o have been to the place quite a number of times. The food is good and well cooked. Being multicuisine restaurant it serves chinese, mughlai and north indian dishes. Though not of the best quality food, but the taste is good. T@he pocket pinch is average. Service depends on the time you visit the restaurant. It takes sometime at peak hours for delivering the food. Interiors of the restaurant has nothing special or different.

Had food last day in maharaja. First of all the ambience or the decor isn't much to speak about. They have a tv that is on full blast which I find irritating. But the food. They make some mean indian gravies. Try the butter masalas . They are really good. As for the Chinese, i want really pleased. Hence the 3.5. otherwise given the price and the great indian food they make, this was a sure shot 4. This is one of the little gems of dum dum which is mostly ignored because of its ambience(read bar).

Okayish restaurant with somewhat above average food quality. I have been to this place a couple of times but either of the time I was not satisfied. Actually I had no other options because both the times other restaurants were kind of full. Recently went there on Akshay tritia. Had to wait outside with my parents for sometime. Then went inside to which I must say the inside is gloomy and gives you a feeling of a country side bar with Smoke all around. Somehow we got our seats at one corner that was so-so. Ordered mixed hakka chowmin, mutton biriyani,vegetable polau and chicken butter masala and 7 up. The waiter served after 12-15 mins. Quantity of food was ok as per the cost. Quality and taste was average. But the ambience was something I was not ok with.

Visited this place today and felt like sitting in a country bar. Be prepared to share your table if there are some vacant chairs on your table. To be frank, I am not ok with this. I will prefer eating at home than this condition. Decided to move out without eating as I felt very uncomfortable with strangers sitting on my table and chit chatting about uninteresting topics. Will prefer to be at home than this. I will not prefer to hangout at such location.

MAHARAJAS wouldn't let the Maharanis drink alone without their ¬†PRESTINE SUPERVISION.

Well, folks, if you are looking for a review for the place then sorry to let you down. The humiliating experience of not being served a drink as sole girl drinkers is all that we were offered and is all that would be reviewed in this section.

A bright sunny day was on the charts and all that we (two age-old school friends) wanted was to grab a beer and some good lunch with our non-stop blabbering. That's what we girls do, right?! We blabber! Atleast that's one of the few things we are approved of doing. On ordering beer we were welcomed with squinted eyes and a hesitant denial on drinks for girls without the company of a MAN.¬†

So, here's to the people of MAHARAJA and to all those who conform to such outrageous ideologies -

YES, I AM A GIRL AGED 23 years and I hold the citizenship of this country that officially allows me to drink starting the age of 21 years. ¬†Kindly refer to the law written and sanctioned by the constitution.

NO, I DO NOT THINK YOU MAKE ANY SENSE when you do not allow two girls to drink without the supervision of a guy. Do you see how you trap yourself in a logical fallacy? Well, Mr MAHARAJA we do not want your forceful supervision in the form of hesitant whispers denying us our rights. The least you could do for us is GIVE BACK OUR RIGHTS!

AND, YES, I SHALL NOT KEEP QUITE. I shall let everyone, in my little corner of the world, know what your plates have to offer. I shall not be afraid of your patriarchal ideologies. I shall not sit back , settle, work things around it (Afterall, that's what we are taught right, to work around the problem) and be okay with your atrocious comments.¬†

FOR REST OF THE NON-MAHARAJA MEN , I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YOU. ¬†In fact you are the REAL MAHARAJAS who break the comforts of the patriarchal cocoon and speak against the forced social norms.

Tale of how maharaja people try to save the maharanis! Sorry couldnt find a rating in negative.

We (I and one of friend who is also female) went to this resto MAHARAJA near central jail because it serves very reasonable priced food and drinks. We asked the waiter: "do u have budwiser" and his reply was: "We don't serve drinks to only girls if no men are accompanying them." Before we could get angry to what he said, we definitely had a hard time digesting his comment or what he is trying to convey. We went and talked to the manager too and he was like girls go out of control nd without men we dont serve. Now, what the hell do u think of that mentality? Can u guarantee me that the guy who is accompanying me isn't going to harass me in any way? Or, he isn't going to get out of control? Also, just because they are men, do they have no other work than to acconpany us? 

No men are "tails" and no women are "climbers". Dont even want to go into if its legal or illegal. Its just the thougt process which doesnt deserve my puke! So, you maharaja and every parasite thinking along same lines where " Maharanis are not allowed without rajas".

Best part is they don't charge any extra taxes, everything is included and they will provide unlimited snacks for free with drinks. Don't know about the food served there but if you're in North Kolkata this is the best place to booze.

One of the oldest and cheapest bar cum resto. There are multiple parts, i wud say, of this resto apart from home delivery. At the ground floor its the take away counter. Average waiting time is 20mins. Rolls used to be too good. Once you go up to the 1st floor you see two doors - left one for the bar-cum-resto.. Right one for family resto. In both the resto u get all dishes except alcohol in the family one. Food is better than average and good variety. Have been a regular customer for years. Ambience in both the restos are ok sort of  and seat should be improved. Wish the resto management all the best.

First of all, this restaurant belongs to my classmate, a very dear friend Ashish Suri and still I ate only once with him in schooldays considering my innumerable visits to his place.
¬†( I personally visited Maharaja many times though during tuitions *with other friends*, the chicken roll was awesome back then and cheap...... ;P )¬†
(2006, 07 )
Second, this incident happened way later in 2013 after passing out of college, had this friend who bought us 3 pitchers of draught beer just to end up in a close shave from what can be called a perfect "HIT and FALL case". .... :P.¬†
Went there with my family as well, but by then the standard of food deteriorated from what we had during our schooldays.

As far as the food goes, it's completely unhygienic. The chicken is mostly undercooked (sometimes full with oil like the Assam oil well regions) and can be seen retaining some signs of being kept in a freezer for some nights prior to being served. I found a head of a roach in my fried rice a few days ago, plus their rotis are nearly always undercooked. And, their sweet and sour chicken tastes like a mixture of undercooked sauce, oil, cucumber and frozen pineapple pieces. Oh, BTW, their mixed fried rice has a chow-like taste with raw prawns and occasionally with raw chicken intestines in it.

As far as the environment goes, be prepared to be shoved into a bar if you are alone or with another person. The bar is noisy, full of smoke and misbehaving drunkards sometimes. And the guy who manages the staff is rude and will not consider any problems that any customer might face with the environment, but the people who serve the food aren't that bad.

The place is unhygienic, and that is what seems extremely appalling..... but their soups are pretty ok......

Undoubtedly the best bar on Jessore Road. Prices and offers are very reasonable. Most of the staff members are very warm and cordial. Inspite of not having a dedicated parking space the security guard shall facilitate parking along the roadside and ensure that your vehicle is safe. Do not expect a great ambiance here but it's for sure that you will leave happy.
Never miss Aalu tikki with mustard sauce (kasundi in Bengali) and ginger pickle.

This is quite a decent bar located 5 min away fron the 1 number airport gate. It has a family section but i have been to the other side. 
I like this place because of their decent quality of food ,decent price and mostly because they serve draught beer in lowest price.
It is located on the 1st floor and the area is huge. They allow to smoke inside though not at the table. Quality is good with the chicken items but the fish preparation varies a lot. I mainly love their snacks and the tandoor section.
Its worth a go for the drunkards as a decent bar is nowadays not available..and if available its over priced.

It has a family section but m not sure if they serve alcohol there or not

Place was filthy, and very shabby.
An hour after we ordered they came back to say that half the things we ordered was not available.
The quantity was too less.
Not for family going people at all.  The atmosphere at the place was very doubtful.  Thankfully we were in a larger group.  As there was no other restaurant open at that time, it was the only option.
We went around 9 PM at night, and they did not even have water bottles available.

This place is superb when both boozing n dinning is concern. I use to visit once or twice in a month along with my elder brother. The atmosphere is so cool and the price of every item is reasonable

This review is meant for the men only because I won't suggest you people to accompany with your family here. It's more of a BAR than a family restaurant located just on the Jessore Road at Central Jail More.

I used to go there at the initial stage of my career with my friends and colleague. It's just about sit back, relax and getting alcohol at a reasonable price between Nagerbazar and Airport bus/auto route. There's nothing special about the interiors and the ambiance is full of cigarette smoke.

Alcohol is real cheap here but they have limited brands only. You can try Chicken Tandoori, Finger chips or Crispy Potato as a snack. If you want to have dinner after a session of drinks I would suggest their Chilly Chicken with Fried Rice combo which includes sufficient quantity of rice and chicken for a single person and it's pocket friendly too.

So, if you are on a budget and want to indulge in trance this place could be a good option for that.

this is a typical den. their choice of beverage and food on the menu makes it a superb den. its cold and chilly on the skin and chaotic noisy on the ears. but if you can focus on the food, its really well prepared. I havent been there recently but my past experience has been good. the family section is the worst part as it looks like the ante room of a den - dark, smelly and shady joint.
but if you want to drink alcohol with friends and be noisy, I recommend this place.

Although it a family restro it has bar section also and which is not bad at all. Have tried this restro 3-4times being residing the neighbourhood.
Food is good service is also ok. their chilly shrimp is a recomanded dish to have. besides other chiken items and biriyani is also good. price is affordable with an ok type ambiance. for hanging out with friends with a couple of bottles of beers this place is quite ok

Food and service is good but really despise the way they force you into the bar section unless there are any female members in your group. If you are not going for a family outing or don't get to sit in the family section, its recommended you don't go here. If unfortunately you end up in the bar section at night, the inebriated shouts and cig-smoke atmosphere will ruin your evening.

I totally agree with Mr. Manas Majumdar on the point that this eatery is mostly focused on alcohol and alcoholics. Gradually turning into a bar this place is a strict NO-NO from my views for a family dinner. The items though tastes well, I would suggest Ashirbaad (a hotel nearby) for a more tasty affair. An LED screen is the only thing this restaurant has to offer and lacks number of waiters compared to the number of tables.

Its been very poor. only focused in alchohol and not food. Manpower is an issue for homedelivery. Ambiance is ordinery. Food price is ok as per standard. Not a good place to take your family for a freek.

The ambience of the place is good, the food is comparatively cheap but the quality has deteriorated since 3-4 months. I have been a regular visitor there. The service is a bit slow, but okay. Home delivery is sometimes available, sometimes not.
