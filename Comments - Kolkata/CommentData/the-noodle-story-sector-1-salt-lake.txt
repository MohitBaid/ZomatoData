I took the normal wheat noodles with a few veggies and fried in Szechwan sauce. The noodles was served hot in that pretty little box and the smell was amazing. The quantity served is enough for a person to fill his/her tummy without any regrets.

A small food kiosk out side inox at City Center, Saltlake. Service is good; staff are polite and prompt. Tried the tomato noodles with fried egg, the steamed chicken bao, the soba noodles with chicken and a player of steamed gyazo. 
The taste of the food is strikingly different from elsewhere. Generous quantities of vegetables, topping and sauces. The bao and gyazo were well made. The added sauce with them is very spicy. Good for a cold winter day!
It was quite nice. Only deducted one rating for their menu card, which didn't have updated prices.
Do try!

Discovered this place in City Center when looking for a non fried small eats. Absolutely value for money, stuffed bao. 3 small baos in a plate. I absolutely loved the mozarella strings as I bit into the bao. A slightly more seasoned mushroom would have elavated the plate.

Con: few menu options

Will definitely go back.

This is a newly opened joint at city centre saltlake.So my mother got us mushroom and cheese bao and noodles with veggies,chicken and paneer.
Noodles quantity was really good,enough for 2 people,it was nicely made and the best part is they have whole wheat noodles which is somewhat lil healthier than the others.
Disappointed with the bao because they had 2 mini sized bao in one plate cost Rs 150,moreover they named it mushroom and cheese bao without any hint of cheese.Though the sauce served with it was spicy and sweet.

Horrible horrible experience. I ordered stir fried yellow noodles. They sent me tasteless noodles with no spice or flavour. It was like eating boiled noodles. Plus the food was cold, so i dont even think it was freshly made. Please do not order from this place. When it opened it provided a good service. But my last two experiences have been really horrible. I could also taste flour in my food, don‚Äôt know how that happened. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone, anyone!

This place is located right in front of the Inox at City Centre 1, and is a small food stall with no seats . The food is made quickly in an open kitchen , and the menu has only noodles , apart from Bao bread. The chicken Bao they make are two tiny white buns with chicken filling inside , and they taste like an average patty . The noodles they serve have the option of both veg and non veg toppings.

Order: Veg noodles in yellow sauce
Service : Quick
Taste: Decent, came with loads of vegetables and the ample chunks of  Baby corn added a lot of bite to the texture, sauce was refreshingly unique and a bit on the spicier side. 
Portions: Decent but won't suffice for a meal on its own without helpings.

To cut a long story short,I ordered their mushroom and cheese bao.

‚úîAmple stuffing.

‚ùåThe stuffing wasn't flavourful enough.
‚ùåThe dish had a sweetish aftertaste which I didn't like.
‚ùåPretty pricey.

Opt for this dish if you're hungry otherwise give it a miss.The noodles smelt amazing but looked a tad bit oily.The staff was efficient and very friendly.

I have ordered Whole wheat noodles from this Kiosk located at the ground floor of CC1, outside Inox.
For the toppings i tried mushrooms, chicken, broccoli and fried onions with Indonesia garlic sause. The noodles were soft and soggy. Tasted decent. The small yellow box of noodles looks cool. The best part is that one can get prepared the type of noodles one wants. 
The price is on the higer side considering the quantity of food served.

Good at first glance. Attractive in the second. But after you have munched your noodles you will start to understand you are paying much more that you should have. They are charging for each item. The price seems reasonable enough when you look at the items individually. (Rs. 40 for chicken, 20 for eggs, 25 for mushroom, etc.) But, then the final amount will make you understand you are paying nearly 200 bucks for a mediocre dish, and proper restaurants charge you less. Note you have to hire a detective to find the veggies and eats you ordered in the noodle.¬†

I liked the box they are serving in, I appreciate the taste - it was OK, I hadn't had any problem with the stuff like many who are commenting in this space (lucky me!!!) but the bottom line is you will not get value for the money you spent.

Its a small kiosk in city centre one. Here you get to customise your noodle. You choose the sauce, type of noodle, add on vegetable and add on non veg along with the topping.
The staff should be more patient with first time visitors as one might not be a pro at customising their noodle already, its a new concept. The man who made my bill seemed to be quite irrirated.
I tool the soba noodle with garlic sauce and chicken add on.
It was pretty average.nothing great. I wish there was less amount of carrots in my noodle.
Cost wise, it doesn't come cheap at all. On an average a noodle box would cost you a minimum of 250.
Service was quick.

I liked it because of the new concept. I really found it new.. what intrigued me that one can choose from various options starting from the base(noodle),sauce, choice of veggies, fish,chicken,prawn and egg .. and topping also. You have the freedom. I chose normal yellow noodles first with a basic sauce and some veggies and chicken with some crushed peanut as topping. And honestly I loved it. The sauce tasted a bit different from the usual. One portion was enough for two persons. Next time we(the husband and I) tried two different options. I opted for udon noodles and the husband chose to have soba noodles. And it was served with some poached egg on top,beneath was some yummy noodles packed with chicken and some seasonal veggies( we got broccoli,bokchoy, baby corn) and some awesome sauce. I suggest this place. It doesn't burn a whole in your pocket.

A fairly new concept where you get to make your own noodle story from a wide variety of choices in their menu. Step one, you choose your own noodles (they have a variety of spinach/ tomato and what not), step two, choose your veggies, step three choose your sauce. You can add meat and other toppings at added costs. I made a concoction with tomato noodles, but the sauce turned out to be too spicy for my liking.

They also have a variety of Baos, breads with stuffings. I ordered a chicken keema bao, which was surprisingly soft, fresh and tasty. The sauce accompanying it was also very good.

Give this a try if you want to get experimental with your Chinese food and don‚Äôt mind eating out of a box.

The Kiosk is located at cc1 near inox ,Tried two items :
Udon noodles with Chinese (homemade schezwan sauce) with added chicken : i liked the box it came in , not a box of noodles but just one third of it filled , difficult to take out with small plastic spoons from such depth, liked the sauce and udon noodle individually but the preparation had more than enough of oil content . 3.5/5
Chicken bao : two steamed buns stuffed with a sweet ish filling , couldn't spot if chciken , tasted average at the best. 2/5
Verdict : overpriced for the miserable quantities.

Went yesterday after thinking a lot on what to nuch on during an evening time.. saw this small outlet near the booking office in cc1 salt lake.. 
Intersting concept as i went through the menu.. it offers a simple stir fry noodles as well as a variety which offers a four step menu to choose different type of noodle with veggies and a type of sauce to go with the noodles with a choice of topping as well..
I thought of choosing a yellow noodle with some bellpeppers and babycorn to along with it in a tomato chili basil sauce. it pinched me rs140 all inclusive on my pocket.. No compromise on the taste as it tasted the same what i expected it to be.. with an adequate quantity though the quantity of the vegetable choosen was not as much as expected with the compared to the price given for.. service was quick too.. 
Definetely on my list for the second time too..!!

The Noodle Story seems promising with their noodles. It's great for a stop-and-eat snack counter. I tried their Soba Noodles in the Malaysian and Thai sauce. With toppings. Ingredients are fresh, they taste quite good, and their portion per container is enough for two people. What I didn't like was the Bao. I've had Bao from a few other places as well.. Theirs seemed to be a little too sweet with very less filling to counter it. Probably wouldn't try that again.. But the noodles are quite good!

This is my first noodle story experience! We opted for soba noodles as a base,chicken and indonesian sauce. Overall, it tasted good but there were very few chicken pieces. Considering the amount which they charged for chicken,  number of pieces were very less. Indonesian sauce was moderate spicy but tasty enough . Soba noodles,they said, is a japanese noodles, was good in taste. 

I wish they had arrangement of chairs . After a tiring day, we wanted to be seated.

It is fun and it's innovative and it's a different concept. Kiosks are gaining popularity in the city and this one has the additional attraction of "make your own meal" concept. But the biggest highlight is it's Bao. It's finally available in Kolkata. I had the mushroom and cheese Bao. It was soft and warm and absolutely worth trying. The noodles also are well prepared. The quantity is also good. So if you are in this area, should try it.

Have had food from the lake mall outlet many times, and was super happy they have opened in city centre. Have got food delivered from swiggy a couple of times, and also eaten at the kiosk. The spicy bean sauce tomato noodles are really nice, and so is the thai sauce, the bao is really nice, Cantonese veg bao is delicious as in the char sieu chicken bao. 

A recommend dish is the rice as well. 

Good thing about them is that all the food is customised and if you know your flavours well, you aren't going to be disappointed. Personally I love customised food so it is hugely recommended.

The yellow boxes unfolded happiness. The taste that travells continents and becomes a joy in the mouth made us oodle for the noodles.  Baos served were super good, cheesy, soft, stuffed well inside, the dips were super taste enhancer. The Thai Flat noodle with minced chicken and shrimps was good to go where as the Veg one with mushroom bites, tofu chunks, topped with fried onion and garlic was a relief from the mundane Masala Noodle flavor to the taste buds! All over satisfying experience! Cheers!

Tried chicken thai flat noodles with basil sauce today. Food was good but the behaviour of the cashier is why I've given a low review. Tried to con me and take extra money. So after placing my order, he told me my order was for 325, I gave him 500 cash. On asking for the bill he said he would give it later. When my order finally came I asked for the bill again and saw that the amount mentioned was 225. He then proceeded to tell me that fish (which I never ordered) was not included in my order therefore the reduced amount. He then returned the 100 owed to me. Had to ask for the bill thrice to ensure that I wasn't conned. Customers shouldnt have to worry about being cheated when they come to eat at your place. Not professional at all!

Had the rice vermicelli noodles with an add-on of chicken and the basic chowmein with an add-on of fried eggs.Tasted different and really nice. Wanted to try the Chicken Baos but unfortunately they were unavailable :( The Vat and packing charge is a bit too high for a kiosk-restaurant.

Great place for grabbing a quick snack!

I believe there are too many momo places around now-a-days and momo seems to be the only snack choice you have in City Center. And Noodle Story is a welcome change to that.

I love their Chicken Char Sui Bao - which is a traditional chinese bao (the round dumplings we saw in Kungfu Panda :)) The best part of the Bao is the coating which is soft and fluffy unlike what we get in momos. The stuffing has a wonderful bbq chicken flavour too.¬†

I also tried a bowl of noodles with Korean Fragrant bean sauce and it was great as well.

The prices are a bit on the higher side though - but the food is filling and a great change from the same old momos.

As a food stall which don't have any seating facility I never expect a high price.
Anyway I made my own noodle storyüòã but it was below the average. I was quite disappointed at this stage. There packing is very good without any doubt.
I ordered at step1 üçÖ noodle, at step2 button üçÑ, baby üåΩ, fried eggs, chicken at step3 Indonesian sauce, from toppings fried garlic, fried onions. After all it's become around 200-210 I forgot the price actually. It just came in there small box like package. Quantity wise bad & also the taste is not good at all.

The only good thing about this place is the box in which they serve you the noodle, quite strong and hard.
I had ordered tomato noodles with fresh vegetables and broccoli, mushroom, babycorn with chicken in thai basil spicy sauce.
Pocket pinch: 186 total and INR 211 after tax for just one box of noodle.
The most disappointing fact was that i could only find 5 pieces of chicken for extra 40INR paid for it. It would have been better, if i had ordered the noodles veg only.
INR 200 in any standard restaurant will fetch you better noodle with good quantity of egg and chicken. Atleast serve what you take money for. 40rs for 5 pieces of chicken is definitely not worth it. I literally has to ransack the box to find chicken. Huge disappointment.

We had their food in cc1 late night at 10pm. We were not sure about the experimentations so ordered the plain Hakka r roadside ones. It was very bland. The taste of soya n vinegar was very very mild close to none, not even seasoned well. The price after adding mushroom n Bell peppers and peanuts without any sauce n nonveg came up to 169 which is almost close to Hakka noodles of Haka!!!! So unless I try other stuff n be well satisfied cannot rate more than 3. .5 is for the packaging which I liked.

I first tried out The Noodle Story couple of weeks back when they were kind enough to send me a few items for review. What first caught my eyes was the packaging. Not only cute but very convenient and surprisingly, quite hardy. Their concept is simple and one of a kind in Kolkata. You choose from a wide range of noodles including soba, udon, whole wheat etc. Then you choose your preferred sauce to go with it, then the add-ons like veggies, chicken, fish or prawn. They then stir in everything and hand you over your customised noodles.

I have ordered from this outlet many times afterwards and I've always had a good experience. My favorite combo is the whole wheat noodles with korean black bean sauce and chicken and prawn. Their quantity is decent and prices also reasonable. I have also tried their bao and rice but I am partial towards the noodles. Definitely worth trying!

The Noodle Story has been roaring their presence in the city like never before! They recently opened 4-5 kiosks all over the city. 
We were lucky to receive their food hampers at our place. A good lunch indeed! The package had Thai noodles cooked with chicken, egg, veggies, and a semi spicy sauce.
On the other hand, another wok contained a sauced rice. The grains were cooked, and tasted okay. It was too spicy for our taste. Accompanied them - cheese and mushroom bao. All in all, it was a good tasting experience!

Thank you Riti for arranging this!

The noodle story is great, especially for someone like me who loves spicy food. They have a variety of noodles and sauces and the preparation is also amazing. Except, you might find the food to have less salt than required, like I did. Since I was eating on the go, there wasn't a possibility of complaining for asking them to add more salt, meanwhile, a couple of days later another friend of mine also faced the same issue of having less salt in his noodles and rice both, but we liked the food otherwise! This place totally caters to the taste-buds of people who love spicy food!

This is a kiosk just opp to inox ticket counter at cc1. They have good options of rice and noodle . Good variety of sauce to make your own choice of noodle and rice.

Too pricey and certainly not worth it. Quantity is too less, quality is mediocre. I had flat noodles with black bean sauce. They drowned the noodles in sauce and didn't have the right balance.

Stop taking your customers for a ride. 
Ordered a Thai flat noodles in chilli basil sauce (149 INR) with top up of chicken (40 INR) and PEANUTS (10 INR).  The total bill amount was 230 INR. The chilli basil sauce was just chilli with no flavor of basil whatsoever. I had to go on a treasure hunt to find the itsy bitsy pieces of chicken. These were the most expensive peanuts I had since there were around 4 or 5 pieces that were halved. Come on, you can't even crush the peanuts to be added as a topping. 
I liked your concept but stop overcharging. It's not that people are not ready to pay, but please ensure that the quality is up to the mark. 
P. S - I also had the char sui chicken bun, this is better but the size of the buns are way too small. I have had the original ones and these are at best a miniature copy of it.

Recently visited at city center so saw the small kiosk here. It has varieties of sauce, noodles, and vegetables to add on. Newly concept added to kolkata city. Basically its a live mangolian type if counter. Pocket friendly. Service is fast. Staffs were friendly and can recommend you as well as explain you the type of dish they will be making, as well as they give you a chance to taste there sauces. Had ordered for Soba noodles( Flat noodle), with Japan style and Indonesian style (Medium Spicy). Food was good, deliciousüòé. Food was properly cooked.

Was really keen on trying this outlet but was really disappointed. While the menu sounds really innovative and interesting, its lacking in taste and the service is also poor. I asked for the veg chowmein and udon noodles with Indonesian sauce. The chowmein was better than the udon noodles but both were not upto the mark. They were so spicy that we started sweating only after taking a few bites. There is spicy and then there is burn your mouth and digestive organs spicy. I am all for spicy food but the noodles here were full of pepper and chilli which was not to my liking. Now for the service. If they want to compete with the road side fast food vendors who churn out plates of noodles in no time, then they really need to speed up. They are really slow. It takes an upward of 15min for one portion of noodles to get done. Was expecting it to be better

Happen to come across this kiosk few days ago and was really impressed with such an innovative epithet- 'The noodle story'. 
Their menu was well thought and had variety of base noodles as option starting from spinach to wheat and even vermicelli (rice). Had always longed for flat Thai noodles and finally its available in this outlet. 
More than noodles,I liked their Bao-cheese and Mushroom. It had stuffings of mushroom and cheese  packed in a bun like momo shape. It was absolute soft and flavorful. Was amazed to see the variety of sauces available to create your own customized noodle. One can actually create their own noodle story using the platter provided by them.

One thing straight up, this place gets major points for creativity.They have an array of different noodle kinds and numerous sauces to choose from.Add to that, a whole lot of toppings in the veges and meat section, makes this place a definite one-time(atleast) visit.The process of choosing the noodle and topping it off with one's choice of sauce and add-on makes it such an interesting endeavour.They also serve Baos, in addition to their signature noodles.
I for one, ordered the Yellow Noodles with Vietnam Sauce with some Tofu as add-on.The Vietnam-style was the only non-spicy sauce on the menu and well, it was delicious.
The food is inexpensive, the quantity is good, the taste is not bad either.Most importantly, it is one of those very rare places that presents itself with so much of authentic noodle choices.A must visit for all the noodle/ramen lovers out there.Do give this place a try.

P.S. I upgraded my rating of this place after my second time here.It is that good. This time I went for the Charsiu Chicken Bao and the stir-fried Yellow Noodles with fresh vegetables with an add-on of Chicken, Pok Choy and fried Onions. The baos were very unique in their taste, owing to the char siu and the noodles were delicious to the T. If healthy and tasty is your mantra, then do visit them.

I found this outlet to be really mismanaged. We ordered thai flat noodles with Indonesian sauce. I liked the sauce. The dish was prepared nicely. Can be better. They have variety of sauces.

They've opened their kiosk at CC1.
Had bought home their Thai flat noodle.
Taste had been very disappointing and unsatisfactory, though the noodles had been okay.
The sauce had been too spicy, even though I'd ordered for mild spicy.
Chinese food lovers and those with a penchant for noodles can try out, but personally wouldn't want to try again.

I had ordered the Thai flat noodles with chilli garlic sauce and the mushroom cheese bao, it was outstanding. Would recommend noodle story to anyone who wants to enjoy a variety of noodles with international flavours. Must visit.

The stall is on the ground floor in the mall. You have a selection for your noodles and it is delicious. It isn't good to eat out during a hot day because the mall is open. The food is good and the rates are also affordable. The staff is nice and polite.

I ordered a cup of yellow noodles with chicken and veggies. After tasting a spoonful, I realised that it's stale, perhaps cooked several hours ago. When I confronted them, they tried to give excuses like 'our noodles have a different flavour' etc. It's sad that a newly opened outlet at City Centre is trying to cheat people in such a blatant way!

this restaurant as it is near to my office. It's a good place with affordable price and situated opposite to city center 1. Side dishes are also good in taste.

The concept of the outlet is good but the taste is not upto the mark. I tried chowmein with some veggies and egg . Salt was very less in the palatte but the taste overall was also average. The quality was good . Next time will definitely try out some different combinations.
