This place deserves a rating along a negative scale. Went to grab a sandwich and a coffee. Finding the place was easy as it is located in the same premises of Kasturi restaurant. The garden did not have a decor in particular however the colorful chairs and umbrellas looked good. The name Kokobana was never mentioned on the sign boards, therefore I walked past the garden into the building to confirm if it is the same place. A waiter confirmed and I grabbed a chair in the garden. For 15 minutes I was sitting all alone in the garden and nobody came to take any order. Then I went inside the building to ask for the menu. The waiter instructed me to sit, I went back and soon he came and handed over the menu. To my horror it was a menu of Bengali cuisines, apparently of Kasturi. I mean, under what sense you'd give a Bengali lunch menu to a diner who has come to a cafe? I called the waiter and asked for the cafe menu. He was half unsure about if any other menu at all existed. I requested him to find out. He never came back. After 20 minutes I went inside to ask for the cafe menu. One of the waiters told me that they are not preparing the cafe items due to Durga Puja. I wasted almost an hour and came back in empty stomach.

Why couldn't they inform me before when I specifically was looking for the cafe? Why couldn't they come up faster to take orders when I was the only diner they had at that point of time? The waiters had a horrible body language, as if they were not willing to serve. They were laid back and lethargic. And that was true for all the 4-5 waiters present in the building.

One suggestion to the owner, either get professional people or switch to some other business. Running an eatery isn't your cup of tea, it seems.

Not that great a place. Its an outdoor seating. Food wasnt that great. Price is decent bt not worth 2nd visit as there are many places in the same area, same price but better than this in quality wise.
