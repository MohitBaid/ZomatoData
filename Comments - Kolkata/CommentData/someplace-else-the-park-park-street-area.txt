This place is really racist. I am an American and I felt extremely awkward here. My Indian friends were made to go through metal detectors to go in, while my friends from the US were not. Then, I asked them to play a Hindi song that is meaningful to me. They said yes twice. Then, they were extremely rude to me and said to me that it is against their policy to play a Hindi song. I didn‚Äôt  quite get what they are aiming to accomplish. I would not recommend going unless you are interested in rude servers who don‚Äôt follow through with what they say. Sad because the venue and decor is really nice.

I had gone there on new year's eve. I had booked couple passes so entry there was smooth. The ambience was amazing where there were DJ and live band performance. Food was okayish as they don't have too much items in their menu. The liquor prices are a bit too high and moreover it was way too much on that day because of the event. They didn't have draught beer which I had expected a lot. Then in beer they only had a few options that also at more than double the original price. Overall a good experience but expecting it to be better if I go on a normal day.

A place I am visiting from my college days of IIHM, from the time one can almost say I started my journey for being a hotelier. To be more specific it was since 2005 I am visiting this place, and each and every time I stepped in I just loved it. The Live performances are the best asset of this place, don't remember even How Many times have head banged standing at the front, how many times gathered with my oldest buddies, have endless memories for this place. In one word this place is "Nostalgia" for me.

This is the perfect rock and roll pub with the best of the ambiances in Kolkata, That old English country side feel , that amazing music been played with the optimum bass , the decent posh crowd , its just heavenly. No roxy , no tantra , no Jw matches the class of someplace.

About time some other joint straightened them out and their Monopoly comes to an end.They will run out of regular beer like clockwork almost everyday around 9pm and charge more than 650 bucs for a pint of Heiniken. When asked for the menu card the bartenders say they dont have the updated menu.These dumdfu@#cs will straightaway deny appetizers if the pub is close to full.
I was a regular here at one point of time.And now the service has deteriorated considerably. The bartender(s) will take u for granted. They will behave as if they are doing a favour by handing the drink to you.
Well these suckers have a competitor now in the name of Hard Rock. I just hope they reflect back on how arrogantly they treated their guests once their business is down....

If you love live rock music then this is the place. Am not sure if this is the only such place in Kolkata so far that plays live rock every evening, though, I believe HARD Rock Cafe is finally making its debut in the city, But this place is a classic; can‚Äôt beat an original, if you get what I mean.

Used to frequent this place regularly on weekeneds and sometimes even on weekday evenings till a few years back, but professional exigencies at times take the front seat. Also, with quite a few micro-breweries having opened, beer aficianados like me would tend to give the same bottled lager a miss. Also, the fact that compared to other metros, Kolkata has very few lagers available in the city.

Someplace Else has a nice British pub decor, though, the area is comparatively small and it does feel like a Mumbai local on weekends. Lol.¬† Food is damn good and the local rock groups that play every evening are pretty awesome too. 

If you love rock, this is the place to flock. Whether in groups or solitary, does not matter. Just soak in the music while your body soaks in the booze.

And you feel good about life till the next weekend comes.

Extremely expensive. Not worth it. The bill was wrong they had added a red bull worth 400 when I did not order it. After telling them to correct it. They had an attitude like they were doing me a favour. A LOT of better places which are cheaper and better than this shithole in Park Street

Review is about the ambience and not the food. 
I went there on Sunday night...
- decent crowd (not very amazing) 
- if you like music, this can be an option 
- quite a small place (area wise) 

Overall, if you want something somewhere even near to Bangalore /Delhi pubs, this can be an option.

Such a great experience! Happy hour was on when we walked in, and they had 1+1 on everything, including on premium scotch! Finger food that we ordered along with the drinks were nice too. Would recommend the fish fingers. The staff was courteous and prompt.

The music was really nice. Earlier in the evening, there was a DJ playing who was doing an excellent job. He was more than happy to accommodate our song requests as well. Later on, a live band came along, and they played well too. We hung out at this place for over 4 hours simply because we did not feel like leaving. Would love to go back.

The music was good. 
Since the bar was busy guys straight away rejected to even serve appetizers 
The beer one pint heniken price was kept as 650rs

Always a top fave to go for an never ending unwinding session. Cheers to the club management for keeping the favourites of Kolkata - the way it was.

Worst experience ever! The only reason me and my friends were there for 3hrs was for The awesome rocking band Parikrama. To start with when i called up the park hotel & wanted to speak to someone from Someplace else they put my call on hold and suddenly disconnected it, after 5 mins when i called up the hotel again and wanted to ask will there be any entry fee at someplace because me and my friends have initially expected as the famous band is coming to play live but they informed there is no entry fee unfortunately wen v rchd the guy at the entrance informed us that there is rs 500 as entry fee wen we said that just 2hrs back wen v called up hotel they infrmd us and he very rudely replied that probably someone has given wrong information but i cannot allow free entry his exact words were "what do you think they are such a big band and they are charging us 3lakh for 2hrs performance how can we make it free and whoever has provided you the information I dont know its a wrong information who has provided as i dnt know her name", which was a bit dissapointment statement to hear just want to tell him that time even now dude no one asked you are charging our question was y a wrong information was provided and how cud you say like tat.
2ndly when we entered and ordered for beer for a heiniken pint beer the price was Rs 650 which normally we get it at a price of Rs 350 (higher than normal pubs which is fine enough), I understand ppl will drink tonight more or just with the flow of music so u raised ur price and did not sell pitcher or anything.
My suggestion to The Park is wen u guys are star rated hotel you shud be more polite n professional to your guests n should not take undue advantage of the guest when there is any short chances.
Thank you.

had gone to someplace else a few sundays back. went there after 5 years. the service quotient was really low and most striking was the absence of hospitality. while returning from the wash room, i was stopped very rudely by one gentleman by the name of Roshan. His body language was least impressive and very insulting as well. He let me in , i believe because he realised that if i leave from there the bill will remain unpaid. I enquired about gautam and came to know that he has become a director now. back when i used to visit someplace else, under gautam, such kind of behavior as showed by Roshan was unthinkable. I was also presented coffee table book by Gautam in 2008 due to my continued patronage of this place. I will not go back there again and will also discourage others from visiting who are looking for hospitality. that one thing, Hospitality is conspicuous by it's absence. sorry to say that.

They re-kindled and re-defined Calcutta's Nightlife.

From the word go, they set the bar high, for themselves. Thereby setting an example for their guests. And they have consistently maintained those high standards.

Decor and ambience - they got it right the first time.
It's always Hospitality here - never was mere service.
They unerringly have the pulse and palate of their patrons - in the songs, the sangria/soma, the snacks.
Smoking room is a special bonus.
"Cover charge? We don't know what that means, Sir."
They've upped vigilance in the last few years, happily.

They're legend - from Singapore to Surat to the Suez.

They don't need yet another review, like this one.

Outstanding for the drinks, atmostsphere and music! But action begins after 10.30pm.
Only in Kolkata would you get live rock music every night!

Shit place. The average age of the crowd was 35. And this place is shady. All sorts of debauchery was openly happening here with uncles trying to pick on girls who didn't look like genuine girls themselves. Visit this place on a Sunday night and you'll know what I'm talking about. Haven't even mentioned about how overpriced this place is. No option to rate it worse so keeping it to a 1 star.

Someplace else has always been known for its live music. The ambience resembles that of a British pub and has limited seating. It's a small place , equipped with a full bar and a smoking room. We had the kebab platter and vodka. The service time is good and the place is expensive , owing to it being part of a hotel. Great for hanging out and dancing or listening to good music.

This place needs no introduction, and is located to the right after you've crossed 'The Street' at The Park. The interiors of this place are warmly lit , the lights low and private . The seats are good enough for two , as well as groups of 5-7. The gigs here are its biggest draw, apart from the service , that is immaculately attentive . The music on a Saturday evening was mostly a mix of popular rock tracks , though the volume was a tad too loud for easy conversation. The chicken tikka we had for starters was perfectly cooked , and had six well marinated , juicy pieces of chicken , served on a strip of banana leaf on the plate . The grilled paneer tasted good too. The ambiance of this place is amazing , so if you're looking to have a great evening , chilling with your favourite drink and your favourite people , listening to your favourite kind of music , then this is the place you cannot miss !

Went with little deals offer and was very surprised by the quantity they offered.
We were offered 2 mugs beer..(as per my friends comments,the beer was ok)...and one paneer tikka and one chilli chicken dry as starter...though paneer has soothed our taste but the chicken preperation failed to impress me...it tastes more like sweet and sour than chilli.
Lastly if you want to chill with friends along with a privilage to enjoy the live band...this place is just for u..

If you're in Calcutta and you didn't visit Someplace else yet then you are certainly missing out. A perfect place for the rock n' roll lovers. The happy hours and the band list performing frequently add to the speciality of this pub. If you are looking for some good music and want to spend some good time, then this is the place. 'The thrill is gone'. No. This place keeps it alive.

Touted as the best pub in the whole of Kolkata, SPE would be a quiet place with a very few people around,  if you visit during evenings in the weekdays. However,  you get to see the real shizz post 10pm on the weekends, when live performances go on floor. No,  you can't dance here, but yes you can have the best of the times to the beat of the live music, by handpicked performers, which is soothing to the ears, unlike usual pub music.

Since the place is overpriced (and over hyped to some extent), the crowd here is a very youthful, civilized and sober one, which is a saving grace. Ladies are treated to free drinks on Sundays. 

Otherwise on normal occasions, this place does burn a hole in your pocket.

A very unfortunate incident happened yesterday evening when I decided to go to Someplace Else for a quiet evening with friends. I was stopped at the entrance by an employee who then proceeded to declare that I was drunk and refused me entry. There was not a single reason for this allegation or such behavior. On being confronted about his unacceptable conduct, he then proceeded to threaten me and was joined by another person who pushed, threatened and shoved me. 

Their physical manhandling stopped only when I reminded them that the place has CCTV cameras which are recording everything. I urge the management to review this entire incident which happened around 10:30 PM and ensure that other visitors do not face the same situation in the future. Being a lawyer, I am well aware that initiating legal proceedings is pointless as it will only lead to wastage of time and effort with negligible results.

However, this establishment has now lost out on at least 3 patrons who are never going to return to the place. I have frequented The Park and Someplace Else on dozens of occasions but never again after this experience.

Someplace else is not just another bar. As a musician who has been up on the stage, this is an emotion. Brilliant selection of drinks. Ambience, let's not get into that because you need to be here to be in awe of that. Whenever I visit my hometown, I ensure a visit here every weekend. Never had the food here, just some finger foods which, needless to say, is good. For me, it's a rendezvous point. Never left this place without chatting up and sharing a couple of beers with an old acquaintance or friend. This place, in short, is simply amazing.

Live music from good bands, a good set of speakers and slightly cramped space make Someplace else one of the most iconic pubs in Kolkata. The waiters are courteous and the DJ plays good tunes. Liquor is expensive but the price is justified. Go there if you want to get a dose of live music, it won't disappoint you.

For us, it started with the Hip Pocket followed by the in house and Tantra's DJs followed by the Nucleus. The small and dark space, the loud feet tapping music out of the Bose speakers and the raving crowd; altogether made it in fact..... Some place else. Loved it!

Ambience- Great

@Someplace Else, The Park Hotel , Park Street

Horrible service. They took around 25 mins to get nachos and babycorn which was not at all warm. When we asked to get some moulten cheese on the nachos... the waitress took the plate and brough around 20 mins back with a little cheese on it but again cold af. 

There were no waiters ready to take the order.. When we asked one waiter to get a plate more ..he said 'manager is taking ur order..i cant take anything..double double hojayega toh..jisko order de rha usi ko bolo'...so basically he wants us to leave the table and find the manager. Lol

In short..never visit this place if u desire good service. The manager was quite decent but rest all the waiters were such redundant in their jobs. Unexpected at The Park Hotel.
Ambience was good no doubt.

Crowd - not young crowd ..middle aged crowd..

Wanted to visit for some time and so decided to drop in on the new year day. A note of caution for the guys do wear covered shoes or else u would not be allowed to enter. The place was very easy to find as it is inside THE PARK. It was quite empty and we got ourselves perched quite comfortably. As we were already full after having lunch we dicided to go for drinks only. We ordered a pitcher of draught beer and 2 mocktails. I was looking out for live music which is a forte for this place but was dissapointed. My experience was very average. The drinks r damn expensive. I have been to much better places before.

Heard of this place from many of my frnds who had already been there... Based on their n others review, I was eagerly waiting to be there for such a long time. Today was my first visit there n i m really disappointed to say that this may be my last visit there as well. We seriously went there with such high expectation n got such ill treatment. This place is really overhyped n foods are really, really overpriced. Food quality is also like a street side cheap restaurant. We ordered smoked lamb n it did not taste like anything called smoked lamb at all. The waiters are not also helpful at all. Noone came to help us as we entered, i asked one guy to give us seats for two, he totally ignored me. Then i have to ask another person to make an arrangement. Overall my experience was not good at all. This is totally my personal point of view which can differ with others. But i am not gonna visit this place anytime soon. Thank you.

Most disorganised and unmanaged pub I have ever been. I went there for one event organised by Nexa yesterday night. They only have 2 waiters, who even doesn't know how to manage a large crowd or can't talk to customers properly, serving drinks and snacks. For every order we had to wait minimim of 1 hour. 

It is pretty evident the name, some place else, is a history now. 
And The Park, is just a story now, it is just like a resaturant or bar which you can have near to airport or beside EM bypass.

Overall worst experience ,and will never come back.

Is it me or is this place overrated? The music is good, yes but it's half Bieberesque. The drinks are frightfully expensive and the ambience, well, I felt it heavy and weighing down on us. A simple AC request wasn't heeded and the service otherwise was non-existent. It was not even peak hour yet. We had a few cocktails and chilli cheese toast, both of which took a good 30 min to arrive and were no big deal when they did. This place did nothing for me.

In Love with the ambience, snacks not to forget Music of course....Best time to visit this place is after 10 PM on Weekends as you have really good bands performing over here....Have been here on numerous ocassions and always come out as a happy chap...

Too expensive to have drinks....But coz of the electric atmosphere you can't stop yourself from having a drink or two....Smoking zone is nice with good seating arrangements within as well....

It kind of is a alternate to Roxy that is just next door. We couldn't get a place to sit in Roxy so we went off to this pub. The aura is great here, full of beers and music but kind of is a let down.

The live music on friday saturday Wednesday is rocking 

Local bands perform sometimes big shots also come here 

Well entry fee is 0

The price a little steep but when you enter here the ambience will never let you feel that your money is wasted....

We basically had gone to visit Roxy but changed our minds when we got to know about the ladies night here.
The interiors are dim lit with amazing live music.
The ladies night was worth it.üòç
There was also 1:1 on selected products.
We ordered chilli fish and chips to munch with the drinks.

I recently visited this place, a place known for it's jazz and blues more than anything else, a place where all musicians desire to go and given a chance, play, in Kolkata. Someplace else is the place to be. From the crowd to the reception to of course the music, this place has a charm of it's own. I went to this place with one of my very close friends and music lover, Saurabh whom I met after 4 years. What better place to be at to bond over and discuss music. Although, I wanted to see Amyt Dutta live and was secretly hoping he would play there being a Friday night as he is one of those Indian guitarists whose playing I admire, he didn't. There were two bands from the local scene playing there and they too were ridiculously brilliant! And as far as Amyt is concerned, I'm sure I'll catch him somewhere, sometime and may be 'Someplace Else's ;)

Hands down one of the best places to be in at Park street and just don't miss the weekends. They have good live music from Inde Artists with good 90's numbers. Food quality is amazing especially for starters and A-Z variety of liquor to brighten up the evening. Service levels are basic as extending full fledged courtesies isn't practical here. Just don't visit alone.

Someplace Else is an amazing little pub at The Park Hotel on Park Street. There‚Äôs a small stage on the far end of the pub where local rock bands are invited to perform every evening. It gives the pub the look, and most certainly the vibe, of those small, cramped London backstreet pubs where groups trying to break into the music scene would come to play gigs‚Ä¶in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. But the best thing about Someplace Else is the crowd. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I walked into a pub and felt so...um, out of place ‚Äì the crowd was young, trendy and vibrant. And well, I'm not. Wow! I wish we had something like this in Dubai. Along with The Bridge, the best of The Park Hotel‚Äôs venues. Most definitely worth a detour.

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

Someplace else is a pub located in The park hotel on Park Street. It's where the "rock" scene of calcutta breeds and if you're into rock music, this is THE place to be for you. A live band performs here every weekend and with some beer, it makes for the perfect atmosphere.¬†

If you love rock, you got to visit this place on a friday or saturday night!

Good place if you are looking for a good old English pub feeling. Allow yourself to absorb yourself and you will get in the groove! DJ can be very well knowledgeable with music. During my visit in Durga Puja, they were playing rock classics - perfect for the environment! Food choices might be limited though and recommended to book before and then go!

One place is great for ambience, I mean excellent and with all the live band, crowd it has to be! But food options beer/alcohol option is surprisingly less (My thinking).
This is by far the most happening place I found in Kolkata which can give a fight to Bangalore or Mumbai pubs!
But sometimes I felt prices are a bit on a higher side for absolute no reason! Overall for ambience and to have a gala time it's a must visit! But you can skip it if you have a slightly less budget and you want to have great food also.

They charged sales tax on the alcohol we bought. Which is the first time I got charged a sales tax in a bar. That too 27%. Sales tax can only be charged on a commodity once I.e when you are buying it out of a shop. So the park street is illegally if I may say so charging ‚Çπ270 on every ‚Çπ1000 we spend here.

A bijou place though,yet some place else with its thematic representation of a british coloniyal styled pub and its live band performances as the key higlighter or USP in marketing lingo stands to enhance the charm of the beautiful park street .
Located on the ground floor of the Park Hotel, this seems to be a popular place not just coz its in the heart of Park Street but for its live bands and retro mysic that which attracts a certain category of crowd, a little edgy ,little matured and a criwd that understands music and appreciates the finer nuances of a great live band. Out of the three places tthat The park hotel boasts off this one is the smallest,perhaps coz its a pub unlike tantra and roxy which are nightclubs..
the settings represent a english pub or perhaps even a cabreat performance with brick wall decors, carved wooden walls and pillars,all compring an old colonial look with wrought iron as a mix.Not much of place to sit(or stand) with just a few tables, yet they are designed asthetically with railings created to give a look of a seperate section for some of the seating area. Inspite of the space crunch they also have a spaceous smoking zone ..vertically laid out,the pub has a long wooden bar with beautiful lamps on the left while the right side covers the seating area .towards the end is the heightened stage that belts out beautiful live band performances.
While live permirmances are a part of many thematic pubs and bars,yet is is the choice of the band that is the main traffic puller.so far this place has managed to get in place amazing bands to performe..you could really see the crowd enjoying themselves to the perfgormances..the food ,a tad expensive for a small place as such is all about bar food and on par with the other pubs perhaps..But for a place like this,it is not really for the food but the ambience that you would perhaps rate it as .drinks and tit bits is what mostly gets you going..but it was the efficuancy of the suave servers that actually amazed me.they were responsive ,quick and ready to make your experiance an enthralling one..but then, being a part of the renowned Park Hotel obviously brings in these ettiquetts is my belief..so, if you are in a mood for a chilax session with a couple of friends, this place should be a good bet..dont expect to find lavish place to sit down since this is not that type of a place but just to gang around by the bar and chilling it out over a few drinks and of course groove to the amazing live bands ..and you might find a compeliing reason to come back the next time

This place is one of the most beautiful pubs in the whole town. To be with good friends and to listen to the retro music in the background at this place will be one of the most delicious moments of your life, believe me; nightlife served at its best. 
We were searching for a pub in Park Street when another friend suggested us this. We ordered two glasses of beer for each and a starter combo of Chicken Tikka, Paneer Tikka and Tandoori Aloo. Drinks were served chilled and the starters were amazing. 
The whole area has an alluring ambience. The DJ was playing his beats and there was a small stage, which is used for live gigs during weekends probably. An exclusive smoking room is available, where you can serve your drinks if necessary. Dim lights also add to the aura. 
Overall, personally I guarantee an awesome night-out if you step foot inside this pub.

To sum up this place "Good vibes only" . From the bartenders to the music to the people.
It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea and thats the whole charm to it. If good music (retro, old school, alternative rock) makes you groove combined with people who know their music and of course beer will be beer and will be beer then this place is second to none. 
A big shout out to staff for making the place what it is..

The place still retains its charm. The pub is themed on a regular British pub ( though sadly Guiness is unavailable, which is the most sort after beer there), but still they have managed to copy the interiors very well. Live local band makes the place more enjoyable  and I love to go there on Friday nights whenever I am visiting the city, although there is hardly any place to stand because of it popularity.

Someplace else is among the most happening places in town. I have visited this lounge multiple times and every time I have been enthralled. The live band is the prime centre point of this place and some bands are absolutely brilliant, playing self made music and old school songs which are guaranteed to brighten up a dull week. The booze is slightly towards the higher side, but who cares when you have such a great ambience. The crowd is young and happening, and a joy to be around. 
If you like live music, Someplace Else is absolutely the place to be. Not someplace else.üòÅ

Someplace Else, certainly goes by its name and takes you to a whole new place, a place you wouldn't readily find in Kolkata. Sitting at the most happening place in the city, this place appears as an underdog but can go on to surprise you to whacking degrees.

If you are planning to drop by this place sometime soon, you'll locate it at The Park Hotel in Park Street. Walking across The Street and the lobby, is situated Someplace Else.

Wooden carved interiors with high ceiling and sheer, lit tiles gives the whole place an old-fashioned vibe. Adding to this is their country music playlist which surely does throw us off to some place else. Their interior is a work of art, but it only gets better from here.

Girls, get your high heels on 'cause Sunday nights are ladies night at this place. Liquor flow is good here, you'd want the shots above all the other on the house things they have to offer.

Now for the negatives: although I love the pumped up ambiance in this place at late hours, the bartenders seem to lose themselves with the vibrant music and the Sunday Night women crowd. Maybe get the orders rolling too?

The place is famous for live bands performing late into the night. It's good if you can find a seat or table as they are limited and fill up fast till the band starts performing. Ambiance is very lively and the crowd is good as most people come here for good music. We ordered pizza, which was great, and beer. Prices are high but music makes it worth it, I guess.

Place to hear some good music or live performance by band and have a chilled beer. Not very large but great wooden work gives this place an english bar kind of feeling. You can't term this place as a night club but also not bar. It comes something in between them. Price is okay considering you can enjoy live show and it is opened till late night so that's the plus point too

I went here on a Monday evening, and with a lot of expectations. But I was utterly disappointed...especially after having read such wonderful reviews about this place!

We reached here around 9.30 and the place was almost full! We occupied the last vacant table...the one farthest from the stage. To be honest, I was impressed with such a crowd that too on a Monday! We had gotten a great deal on food drinks from Nearbuy which we redeemed and placed our order and waited patiently.

The ambience is quite good! There aren't many tables... And the seating with chairs is slightly congested. The lighting is kept to a minimum but it really accentuates the mood for the evening. The smoking lounge has almost as much seating capacity as the pub!

After some 15 minutes the service associate informed us that one of the dishes won't be available and thus we'd have to make do with the other available option. The first round of drinks arrived quickly along with salted peanuts and cheeselings on side. And after an extra ordinary time, came the first food dish...and after even more time came the second dish. It took them more than required time to get the next few drinks as well which was very disappointing. It seemed there was just one service associate who frankly had too much to handle. I expected much better service from them especially after the reviews for here... And my fabulous experience at Roxy! Disappointed.

Coming to food and drinks, Beer was beer. Tandoori Paneer was disappointing...it should have been little spicier and lot more juicier and softer! Chilly chicken was good! So overall, nothing here that really set apart this place. 

For the last hour or so there was a live band playing as well which was quite great! Loved them dearly! But not enough to compensate the slack in service. Our evening was still young, and we wanted to spend more time but we decided to someplace else...

I guess mine was an off experience, but would have really liked if the service would have been upto the mark.

I wish I could give them a 0 star. I went there with a couple of friends on a Friday evening. We took the vouchers available on NearBuy for 2 starters and 4 beers. Firstly, there were barely 2 staff to attend the whole bar. Secondly, the beer glasses served were not full, about 40 ML from each was missing also, there was no proper foam on top. The food they served- it was like they were feeling pity on us and serving us some food for free. We ordered Cheese Garlic Bread and we were confused if we ordered the cheese one of classic one. They had good flavor of garlic but cheese? No, there was minimum amount of cheese, as least it could be. We complained to our attendant about it, the response? "That's what we serve here."

Pathetic... never going there ever again... Overpriced and not even worth the visit.

It is definitely  Some Place Else. This place gets you like  wine. A bit expensive but must visit place in Kolkata. ¬†The crowd is more live than the music.

Visited with my frndz last Monday. Got a killer deal from the nearbuy app. 18 beers (250ml) and 6 starters, 3 veg and 3 non veg for only 2300 something. Including Tax. The ambience of the place is way too good with live performances. The quality of the food is decent enough and the staff r very well behaved. Clean couches, smoking room, all in all a well deserving 5 stars. Will like to visit over here again.

At first, the rather limited size and seating of the place seemed underwhelming - I started asking my friends if there was a better top floor in the place. 

But within minutes, it didn't matter.

I've seen my share of live music, and Someplace Else takes the cake. The extremely professional and timely organization of the performances made for one of the smoothest shows I've ever seen. The acoustics were perfect, and the atmosphere charged. Add to that the extremely quick service, and I knew what the fuss about this place was for. 

After the performances were done at 8PM, I was about to leave. But then I wanted to try out a drink, which was going to set me back a few bucks. I went for it anyway. 

Soon after my drink was done, the bartender keeps another on the counter. 

"Sir, it's Happy Hours."

I think I cried.

If you are a fan of live music and music is your dope then it's a must try place. Was on the list since a long time and paid a visit for the first time with friends. If you want to catch up with your friends over a pint of beer for some real conversation then this is surely not the place. The music is a little on the louder side but you get used to it after spending sometime inside. Live bands are great and play some good stuff. The food and liquor is priced a little on the higher side but you won't mind loosening your pockets at place like this. Happy hours are from 4.30-8.30pm. The staff is well behaved and will come up with suggestion and will help you out in any possible manner. The decor is nice with less sitting space. If you want to enjoy the drinks, the crowd and the music all together then visit after 9pm. All in all a good place and one can come over and over again to get high on music.

Well, this place is extremely popular and ¬†has it's own unique charm. I love the classy decor, the warm & dim lighting & the cozy seating arrangements.¬†
Depending on your taste of music, you may or may not like the live band performances. I generally enjoy it!
The service is good.¬†
The food menu could have offered some more choices. Food tastes fine.¬†
Prices are on the higher side but that can be justified considering it's a 5* property.

Nothing much to say about this iconic place. Turn up on a Friday night , grab a beer and just soak in the music. Atmosphere is absolutely perfect , allows you to unwind. ¬†Seating arrangements can be improved , does get way too crowded in case of live performances. Still , SPE is the place to be on a lazy weekend night :)

SPE is okay if you're not a die-hard music lover or want to experience live music in a loud setting. For me, unless you're really lucky, all music they play is ordinary.

Drinks are a tad expensive here, but it's the Park, remember¬†

Crowd can be interesting sometimes - I've known people who've made friends here just hanging out casually. But the space is too small to relax and chill out.

I like Roxy more!

This was in list for a long time. Finally visited with my friends. 
I loved the ambiance. The seating arrangement is nice and cozy. 
I went with a killer deal from the nearbuy app. The service is really good and impeccable. Loved how the server himself suggested that we could swap the beers with the mocktails without any charge. Instant redemption was done without a hassle.
The beer mug is filled to the brim. (Grinning face). Table accompaniment included a bowl of cheeslings and a spicy chips. Both are given in a medium sized bowl and it is refilled the moment one asks for it. These are the small things that take any place to a different level. 
Firstly most of the bars just give only one time of accompaniment and even after asking for a refill one has to wait for it. But not here. For the mocktails we took tropical breeze, Virgin mojito and cool blue. Presentation and taste were perfect. Not overly sweet neither overly fizzy. 
The sides were paneer tikka which was soft and well spiced , soft alu Tikkas. Round goodness. The chicken Tikkas were equally juicy and moist. I loved the dry chili chicken. The plate is loaded with boneless pieces of chicken and coated with the perfect sauce. Must try. 
The smoking room is really nice. For the first time I saw a smoking room actually having seats for the patrons. And soft comfortable ones! Even if you don't smoke a quick peek is a must. 
Will be visiting soon. Kudos to the entire team. All the very best and continue to keep up the awesome work. 
P.S. Did I say they have a happy hour? From 4:30 to 8:30 on all alcoholic drinks. ( double grinning face )

Since The Park already has a couple of nightclubs, maybe this one could avoid bursting people's eardrums. I loved the place once earlier when they had live music... though, that was pretty loud, too, it was nothing compared to a recent trip where the DJ played music that drove me out to save my ears & sanity after a solitary beer...! This could be a chilled out bar with good crowd, music & a buzz, but at least for me, the volume levels are a complete put off, & won't be back. Also, when I visited during the Cricket World Cup Finals, there was a surge of a bit of shady crowd hanging about... who seemed really pally with all of the staff... just didn't make me comfortable.

No place is like Some place else. We normally go for live gig session. So many talented musicians across India comes nd perform. The ambience is at top notch. You would find people who purposefully come to listen to good music. PLC not that spacious though but the ambience will blow your mind. Artists like Ehsaan, Loy, Jayanta, Arunima, Hip Pocket, Amyt Datta and many more famous and talented musicians comes and perform. If much better than hard rock cafe and the entry is also free. That's the beauty of this place. Hence there is no place like Someplace else. :)

I have a complaint against this place, i.e on saturdays why arnt we allowed to enter without covered shoes. R we supposed to wear a coverd shoe to ait over a beer. I would request the authority to please look into this. All over it is a good place to hangout till 2 at night.

If your work place is near Park Street and you are looking for a place to unwind and listen to GOOD music this is the place to be. The upmarket ambience coupled with decent service makes the place a must visit for all you audiophile and bibulous people out there. 
Only thing I would suggest is the live band starts a bit too late. Grooving to their beats and returning home at any form of acceptable time is something you can clearly forget. And as always Bon appetite...

I don't really know about their food.
Never ate there.
None of my friends could tell either.
In fact I guess 99% of the people who have visited Someplace Else never tried the food.
We visit for the live band performances & some shots/beer to go with it.
The prices keep fluctuating so it's better to ask the bartender. I've had the same corona sometimes for as low as 330/- sometimes for 800/- per pint.
Generally there is no cover charge to enter this English styled pub, but sometimes they do impose it.
The place is quite small & some may find it a bit claustrophobic but I guess that's the reason the music sounds so good here.
Cheers to the great music this place makes every night.

P.s. they have a dedicated smoking room. & the waiting area is widely used a place to take selfies. :D

Although this place is expensive, ypu could actually try visiting this place during the Happy Hours and enjoy a one on one. We had ordered an LIIT pitcher and got one free with it. Three of us couldn't go through it! I think the happy hours are between 5-8 if I am not mistaken.

Being a music lover, I have been quite a lot of times at this place. Excellent musical atmosphere and the best part is they have different bands or music program on all 7 days. Saturday Night Blues is worth a mention. The price is on a very very higher side. I still remember in 2009, one full peg of smirnoff was charged 450 rupees, not sure what they charge now!!
The property belongs to "The Park" so the charge is justified.
So to enjoy the music, best option is that you go to Shaws bar, or Oly pub, or any place where boozing is cheap, full yourself and tgen drop in at SPE - take a pint of beer and enjoy the best music in town....

Ah..it gives me reason to work hard on weekdays so that I can chillax on weekends.dis place is another reason that I never want to leave my city .
P.s. last time I visited ( 13/2/2016 ), some creepy guy tried to be a push over on my friend .even when we told him to brush off ,he insisted to buy us drinks . this some how ruined her mood and yes it was her first time in someplace else.and she heard a lot abt d place from me earlier.

So much hyped this place. But not at all satisfied with it at all. As we all know about the location I'll straight go to the review. 
So, they have happy hours from 4:30 to 8:30. We ordered 2 Coronas as they didn't have budwiser, first disappointment. Second they only had starters at that time food would be starting from 6:30. Anyway there's not much to explain about the beers of course. Then we ordered cocktails Tequila Sunrise. It typically tasted like medicine. Not good at all. Coming down to food we ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka, fish and chips. Tikkas were good well cooked well balance of flavour. But the fish and chips were so dull and bland. It wasn't even served with proper tartar sauce just meyonees added with some capers i believe so so bland. Fish was well cooked but again no flavour, completely bland. Kebabs were even lacking salad which is a must have. Anyway when you have to pay 4022/- for these its not worth it.

If you're looking for a classy hangout destination, this is your place. If you love live music, this is your place. If you want to enjoy the best of the FnB in this town, this surely is the place you need to be looking into.

You ask me about the menu, I really do not know! I visit this place for astounding bands performing accompanied with good friends and a drink of your choice. Cool part is that, the waiters won't pester you for: "Sir, another drink?" Its heavily crowded especially on weekends. Earlier they used to play songs till 2-3 AM in nights especially on weekends. But not now. They wind up by 11PM-12 AM. They have the rotation of bands each for each of the days. The sound is pretty decent. You can choose your choice of song( they put it up on the board outside- what's playing for the week menu). Yes, music is a very important part of menu here. :)Smoking is not allowed inside, so you have to step outside the SME for¬†a fag just to catch glimpse of fancy cars and fancy what not. Prices are little higher side considering this is a 5 Star pub. But this has every element of Kolkata. Have grown up on this. Its no less than the evergreen song of "Coffee Houser Adda ta ar nei"..Must visit if in Kolkata

I was in Kolkata for a friends wedding. After the wedding was done we decided to spend a day exploring the City of Joy.

After having spent the day eating the amazing street food of Kolkata we decided to unwind at some cool place. One of our friend who works in Kolkata suggested that we go here. So it was decided.

From the looks of the place the place appeared pretty cool. They also had a couple of bands playing in the evening so we felt that we were in for a treat at the place. However it being a small place, we had to wait for sometime for getting a seat.

After getting a cozy corner table, we had to wait for quite sometime till we could get the menu. Even though we had occupied a table, service insisted that we give them a card so that he can keep a tab. Pretty strange and not cool.

Post getting the menus and having decided the food and the drinks, we again had to wait a while till our orders could be taken. Once the order came by we just chilled. The music being played by the DJ and the lighting did build up the atmosphere quite well. However the sour fruit was the order. The food - Nachos and the rolls were quite ordinary. Drinks - Mocktails - Coolbreeze, Illusion and Green Spike were also average. The place is priced pretty heavily and for the amount they charge the quality was pretty average.

The live performances also - one got cancelled and the other was running late. While the place become more active post the band performance started, however if you have been to similar places in Bangalore, you feel disappointed.

Overall okay place. Even if you give it a miss I don't think you would regret it.

Live Music is gorgeous, place to be for music lovers, i wish i could just come back here every evening, it's that enchanting. You find amazing people and stories out here. The perfect blend of music, ambiance and booze strikes a sweet spot in you mind and trust me as the night go young, it takes you to someplace else literally. I am fan of classic hard rock music so i used to visit on those nights. i went to this place 3 times, spent the last night here before saying adios to my journey in Kolkata. Service is friendly and amazing, management makes sure to keep it smooth and professional.

I had been to this place on new year's eve and  what a place for clubbing. With live music everyday it's an overwhelming ambience. Food and drinks were absolutely yummy... more than the food and drinks, the ambience itself brings u into the mood. It's a place hard to get rid of once there. Once a visit is highly recommended.

New Year‚Äôs Eve at Someplace Else is something you can really plan for if you are in Kolkata, though the last visit of mine was couple of weeks ago on a Friday night. Not sure how many times I have been to this place and everytime the experience was elevated by the live music in the end which comes as icing on the cake. This iconic pub is not so spread out, but it has got few cozy nooks which I really look out for. But getting your favorite seat has always been an issue unless you reach there bit early in the evening. 

Location ---- It is there inside the Park Hotel at Park Street. Take the alley alongside The Street caf√© and park your car inside the Park Hotel. The pub is there to your right on the ground floor itself; you can just ask anyone out there for directions :)

Ambiance ---- The ambiance really sets it class apart. It is extremely suave, with solid wooden interiors, brick-finish walls, elevated wooden seating areas, classy bar counter with high chairs and painted glass ceilings. One of the best old world settings in the city with a very woody European feel to it! But the place is not so big and you might feel a bit cramped up when it gets crowded during the live shows. The western background music is surely classy but the place lacks some good acoustics, the sound level goes up when the place gets crowded and in the end, it hurts the ear at times. For the regular use, the place has got old Sonodyne array speakers which is not justified considering the stature of this iconic spot. The sofas and chairs are comfortable enough but things get very chilling if the place is not so crowded, since the temperature levels of the ACs are often not adjusted as requested. The crowd is very good and the place is a heaven for classy western music lovers. Live band (performances mostly start at 10 PM) often performs their originals along with some old covers and takes your experience to another level and in the end you leave this place all happy and contented :)

Food ---- You can go for some pub grubs or even for some bigger bites along with your favorite drink. We had ordered for several dishes of veg and non-veg finger foods along with a pitcher of brewed drinks. Complimentary cheeselings and spicy banana chips are served with the drinks. The food at this place is always prepared with utmost care unlike many other pubs and bars in the city and elsewhere. They never compromise with the quality of the food here and equal importance is given to the presentation of the food which is surely appreciable. The Paneer tikka, Chicken kebabs, Tandoori Aloo, Chicken pepper salt and Chilli chicken were really good though the Tandoori Aloo could have been bit more flavorful. The Fish and Chips ordered was the best dish with super fresh Bhetki that was perfectly prepared and with the French fries. The tarter sauce dip was spot on. Though the quality is just amazing but the quantity and price is quite saddening. The prices are quite steep which maybe helps them to filter out some audiences in the end.

Service ---- This is the part which I didn‚Äôt like about this place. The servers are way too casual in their approach and are very novice, to say the least. They are also not very well informed about the portion of food they are serving which was extremely annoying and as a result we had to order more food to be on the safer side. The plate of pub grubs were said to contain one portion and we finished things up accordingly, after a while the same server came back and said that both the portions have been served in that one plate! I missed to ask his name but this guy was not quite in his senses, it seemed! Anyway we managed to deal with this poor service since everything else was so good. On my previous visits I have found the service to be quite casual but never had any confusion regarding the portion of food served, etc. The service time was prompt though considering the rush. 

Summary ---- Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3/5
Food quality: 4.3/5
Food presentation: 4/5
Value for money: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 2.5/5

My overall rating comes to 3.7 out of 5, which will be rounded off to 3.5 out of 5 Zomato rating. I can come back to this place every weekend for the awesome live band performances and the exhilarating ambiance with those scrumptious pub grubs. The amazing ambiance and the live music together as a unit pulls off the show at this place every single night and helps SPE maintain its iconic status! So, if you are new to this city and you haven‚Äôt been to SPE then do not miss to visit this place, you‚Äôll surely love it.

Cheers!

This is where you should be if you are looking for great live music to go with your booze. The bar serves a wide variety. The music is interesting. Some very good musicians are always belting out lively music to entertain you so that you go back to them time and again.

Used to be my favourite college time handout over a decade ago. But today its a sad depressing place where the live music scene is on.. but doesnt have the thump it once did... the vibe i believe depends on the place and the people who frequent it and once it was about the music. Now its any ordinary run of the mill pub...

One of my favorite joints in the city for the ambiance, food, drink and of course the Live Music

My choice of beer, Miller and Tex Mex Twist. The Tex Mex tasted quiet good and tasty. It was indeed fresh, with the crispy nachos

Price is very high, even if I compare to pubs in cities like Delhi and Bangalore. Ambiance is very lively with classy crowd. Space is another constraint for this place

You do not review Legends. Undoubtedly the best pub in town. Great music, great beverages and fairly good finger foods.
If you love classic rock then this place is a paradise for you. Playlist containing Led Zepp, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and etc. Add to that availability of all the liquors on the menu. Truly "The Best Pub" in Kolkata. Price is on the higher side. But you don't mind paying since the city lacks a genuine pub. Live music and great liquors. Fully Recommended! Go for it!!

Someplace Else is iconic for its live music, ambience and as woman friendly pub. It truly is. The happy hours makes me more happy. They take good care of the safety of their woman customers. And they will always provides you with best options. I will always go back for their drinks. One thing is too much that is the price. Wished it was pocket friendly

If you know Kolkata, you certainly know this place. Very easily locatable, on park street in park hotel. It has the feel of that typical pub you'd go in to unwind with some good drinks and amazing music. This review is based on a very old experience, i know i am late with the review. Luckily for me, when i had visited after college, they had Ehsaan Noori performing live for the crowd. And it was one hell of an experience. 

Pros:
1. The nicest experience.
2. The typical feel of a sophisticated pub.
3. The live music they play is amazing.
4. Superb location.
5. Perfect for a nice hangout, if you have genuine music lovers for company.
¬†
Cons:
1. A little too expensive.
2. Not spacious at all. 

P.s: This is an unbiased review based on my personal experiences.

Partied after a long time. Though the price is on the higher end, you can definitely make it reasonable during the happy hours, which last till 8pm. The USP of this place is their live music performance, which starts around at 10-10:30 pm. They play one of the best 80s & 90s songs, in town. The performing bands play cover songs and also a few of their originals. A definite go-to place in Kolkata for a perfect weekend.

The only place in Kolkata which plays decent rock musician at least that's the only place I've been to. Beer on the tap is quite cheap but only if you get one. Most of the times they'll say "don't have". A lot  of freeloaders around, starts coming in at about 9:30-10:00 pm. The live music scene is good. Food not worth, service lackluster. The only reason it's getting a 3.5 is because of the beer and the music.

Spent a couple of nights there on my recent trip to Kolkata. Inside The Park hotel on Park street, this place was a common recommendation from quiet a few of my friends. If you love rock or music for the past this is the place to be in Kolkatta. Happy hours till 8.30 pm. Live band on a daily basis from 10 pm and the DJ who is very open to requests playing some heavenly music....... Aah Nirvana!!! A bit heavy on the wallet though but then it's inside a five star. A couple of drinks and snacks / food for two can set you back by 4 - 6 K

This is from an awesome experience a couple of years back; but I'm certain it hasn't changed (will know for sure when I visit again in the near future).¬†

I was in Kol on work. Alone. Walked in to SPE at 7.30 PM to a place with two tables occupied. Sat at the bar, ordered some draught beer (very crisp!). Awesome music on the system. Enjoyed for a full couple of hours.

Left my (half-finished) mug of beer at the bar (still two table occupancy) and stepped out for a smoke. By the time I came back, an awesome live band was belting out great rock and roll music, the place had about 200 people in it and, forget my place at the bar, I couldn't even locate my half empty mug of beer. Stayed back in this electrifying atmosphere for a couple of hours more.

Also, great folks at the bar. Super service. Maybe a biased perspective because I wasn't charged for the absconding half mug of beer :)

One of the most enjoyable evenings of my life. Truly a place of awesome adventures!

This is a British styled pub, with short of seating space but who cares when the best of the bands in the town are playing for you.

No place else if boozing is on the card with live music, with no complaints on ambiance but yes...... it's damn high on pricing but being a five star pub you would hardly complain

Hi,

Ok! I know the great 'Someplace Else'. On the first day, I could not get a table or a sofa or a chair or just a carpet. Second day we were lucky(and stupid) and went at 7 to finally get a table. 
It was an average evening and I kept wondering why such a craze for this place. It is congested and suffocating to me. The service was quick but I did not have an 'AMAZING' time to return to this place. Hyped. It is expensive because of 'The Park' and it was justified if I had liked the ambience. Sorry!

P.S I went on an evening with no live music. Apparently live music makes this place better. Perhaps I can try again. Perhaps!

Come here to break free , bob your head , stomp your foot and sing along. An awesome place to energize yourself. Trust me , you will love it. If it gets too much for you , slip out and make your way to the Aqua pool bar in the Park Hotel. Warning : Don't come here if you want to have a long conversation with your pals.

Many places have come and went but this place stayed on......for decades.I think I first visited someplace else in 1993/94 when the Park had advertised it extensively but it was a very different animal then.I even remember the name of the manager Anirban Shimlai who in 1994 created a ruckus in Calcutta by serving draught beer and start having live bands perform here.

At that time it was a nightclub with a long bar and a tiny dance floor at the end of it.Beers were easy ably priced and entry was not strictly restricted like in Incognito at the Taj,or Anticlock at the HHI.

It still retains the old charm and has transformed itself into a Pub like place with live music,and given bands both local,national and some brilliant ones from the North East a platform to showcase their talent.

Can't forget the electrifying Lou Magaw show a couple of years back.Drinks are expensive now and the fingerfood/snacks take a long time to arrive but to anyone who wants to experience the electric experience Park Street was in the prime of Calcutta a visit to this place is a must.

I doubt if any sane person would ever review this place and give it a rating below three. 

Someplace Else, by far, is the most happening pub to be at on Park Street. 

An exhilarating live music experience coupled with the impeccable hospitality of the The Park group- it was only obvious this place would gain the cult following it has amongst its 'followers'. No wonder this is often referred to as the 'Mecca of Live Music' in Kolkata.

Wether it be a beer, a single malt scotch or even if you're a gin and tonic person; this place has it all and in addition, has the vibe and feel of a world class pub. 

Lots of wood work, brick walls and chalk board at the entrance with the line up of acts for the week; you know it's going to be an amazing experience right from the very moment you enter this place. 

What's also pretty 'cool' is the fact that they serve an unlimited supply of 'chakna' for you to much on with your drink. Their 'chakna' too is pretty old school, quite like the place itself- Spicy Aloo Chips, Cheeselings, Toasted/Salted Peanut and some more. 

This place is second home to me and my friends from the City of Joy.

Someplace Else NEVER disappoints.

If you love rock music, this is the place to be in Kolkata! I agree that the prices seem to be pretty high but beware its a part of one of the oldest 5 star hotels in Kolkata! I find their service also quite good! The bartender/waiter would search you among 150 people to provide you with your order if you dont have an assigned table! And boy never did they came up with wrong orders! With the initiation of places like IRISH house @ ballygaunge this place might need something competitive to be in business!

Visited them on a Saturday night. To our surprise, it happened to be 21 year anniversary of Someplace Else and they arranged for a live band performance by Ehsaan-Roy and others.¬† Place was jam packed by the time they started their performance. 

Someplace Else is a small but nicely done place. Wooden furniture,and modest lightning and flooring gives it a vintage feel. Music is loud and crowd builds up really fast and you can will feel some space crunch post 10PM. Given the price, crowd is average.¬† It often appears in the top to do list in Kolkata, and hence worth a visit to get a feel of night life of Kolkata. Overall, a must visit for rock music lovers.

So its just a must go specially for the rock music lovers. One downside would be if the crowd is more then you would feel the space crunch.

Visited them on a Saturday night. To our surprise, it happened to be 21 year anniversary of Someplace Else and they arranged for a live band performance by Ehsaan-Roy and others.¬† Place was jam packed by the time they started their performance. 

Someplace Else is a small but nicely done place. Wooden furniture,and modest lightning and flooring gives it a vintage feel. Music is loud and crowd builds up really fast and you can will feel some space crunch post 10PM. Given the price, crowd is average.¬† It often appears in the top to do list in Kolkata, and hence worth a visit to get a feel of night life of Kolkata. Overall, a must visit for rock music lovers.

This is cool small place where you can just chill and have some drinks and listen to superb live bands. Its truly one of a kind in Calcutta. You are gonna enjoy the performances by the famous as well as upcoming promising bands.
So its just a must go specially for the rock music lovers. One downside would be if the crowd is more then you would feel the space crunch.

Definitely my favourite pub in the  city. Been going to this place ever since my school days.  Great ambience and atmosphere.  If you  like rock then this is where you  head out to.  Open mic nights can turn out to be fun.  The crowd is great.  Like minded people with no dirth of good conversation. The smoking room is done up well,  unlike most places where it's generally bare bones. 
The food can be better for the price.  Also the pub should stock up more on draught beer as inadvertently draught is unavailable on busy nights.

PLACE IS FINISHED. After we entered, within 20 mins we had to decide, lets go some place else, this place is bullshit. All pre loaded tracks @ friday nite. I was like, wtf .. they killed the place. I was also astonished to see people still going there for nothing. If you just want to drink just, go to any place else, not someplace else.

It is truely"someplace" else. If you are into rock music and don't mind a lot of people sitting together and singing and also a few extra bucks then this is the place to be in during the weekends.
The live band that started playing after 9:30 was awesome and in general the music was really good. Definitely a brilliant hang out that is worth the hang over.

It's difficult and almost impossible to get a cent percent on reviews. But there you go... This place is magical. The staff is extremely efficient and friendly. The best music in town played live for ya. Come here and you'll know how good the people of Kolkatta are in music. Legendary!
Had a bit too much to drink once and I was dropped home by the staff. Excellent service. But just take care of your wallet as the music is so good, you might end up spending 40k in a night.... ;) all on yourself!

Excellent. And I do come here a lot!

Hello,
Recently been to Someplace Else.
If perfect ambience to hang out with friends with live bands is what you are searching.. head in here please!!

Pros: excellent ambience, very co operative waiters, live band and very, very nicely cooked and presented food.

Cons: a bit out of space it seems, though it surely wont bother you.

Zest of this place is amazing. It has a young feel no doubt. I went there for a performance by Soulmate recently, and since then I've been into blues. It was that amazing! :D But there were a few spoilers. Like a part of the crowd was crass; sleazy, drunk, middle-aged men, staring the hell out of you. I even got into a little verbal spat with one of them. Also I thought, the place should be a little more pocket-friendly, specially since it has a lot of students coming. Nonetheless, it's one hell of a place for "music and alcohol" lovers! ;)

Good choice of hard rock music to fast service.. from the decor to the quality of food. Everything was just perfect. And if you are a fan of live music , come here on any day ; you will never be dissapointed. Beers.. tandoori murg..aloo tikka.. make your evening rocking with someplace else. The best attaraction - live music and huge variations of liquor.

This is the best place to chill out in Calcutta - as long as you're not worried about the pocket pinch! Great food, Great variety of drinks, Amazing ambience, Efficient service, Live bands & Great Music. ¬†We might not have a Hard Rock Cafe here, But SPE makes up for it. One of the most iconic places in the city...And it truely lives up to it's expectations! Seating arrangements are comfy although very limited. The only disadvantage according to me is the limited space. It tends to get really crowded in peak hours. But that's barely noticeable as long as you enjoy a nice drink with amazing music to go with. A must visit for music lovers or anyone visiting the city!

It's was a bit of a let down considering everything I've heard about this place. I went on a weekend but the place was almost empty. The band played some decent songs (and some I'd never heard before) but it took them ages to set up and they started playing quite late. 
The best part was being on time for happy hours. 
In terms of food I really enjoyed the non-veg kebab platter and the mini kulchas (which were super cute!!). Quite pricey considering the portions though. 
Nevertheless I'd definitely visit again depending on the artists performing.

Had the chance to play twice at the Open Mics here, courtesy Neel Adhikary and my bandmates of course. This place hosts some of the best acts of the city. The ambiance is crisp and the music sets the mood. This place is also memorable to me as my college HOD's husband once treated me a beer after watching my performance. Memories. Enough said. This is one of THE places in kolkata. Do drop by if you haven't yet. üòÅ

One of the greatest pubs in town, Someplace Else offers a unique blend of exquisite continental cuisine, varied range of imported and domestic alcoholic beverages and live music by the best bands in town and the entire country. So if you're a music buff, this is the place to be. But all good things come at a price. If you are to have a really great experience and are willing to look past the draught beer on offer, you gotta carry some serious change in your pockets. Overall a fun place to hangout at and enjoy some real decent music.

Very nice atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, good food. Didn't see any live music as my husband and I wandered in early on a weekday, so I'm not sure what it's like during crowded weekends. The only reason I didn't give a perfect 5 is because the food was very expensive and it was really cold inside.

A great place for music lovers, the live band performance makes up for everything you pay here. Superb ambience gives you the English bar type feel. Food is little expensive but worth the price you pay for. Try out the Chicken Smoked Pepper, tastes heavenly with the beer.
I went in just for live band performance. Find your own reason for coming to this place. A small band of 4 members, a lead guitarist, bass guitarist, drummer and keyboard player played relentlessly for two and half hours. Rock music or blues inspired from B B King they would play it all for you.

Ah! Great music! Great bands! Great ambience! Delicious food! And absolutely one of the best places in the city for having a beer! With open mic sessions and major events, a great place for budding and established artists to perform. Fact: highest hours of live music among any pub in Asia.

To most people, it may seem overpriced. But the music and the ambience... It's worth every penny you spend here! Yes, it gets crowdy time to time, but a decent place with a good fun loving crowd.

This is one of my favourite places in Kolkata. The place is very crowded over the weekends and is just next to impossible to get a place to sit if you are moving in post 7pm. The place is expensive but every penny you spend is worth it given the awesome ambience, great food and music that's a treat to your ears and you couldn't ask for more. Chili blasted chicken or a pepper salted river betki is an awesome combo with your beer. They also make really good cocktails- one should give Mango Martini a try! The pic below is what I am referring to :)

The alcohol is expensive as hell here but when you walk down to a pub in The PARK, you cant expect cheap stuff..... Have been here a couple of times, though the place is a little congested but its fun.. Great crowd that comes in !! SPE is definitely a place you would like to explore in Kolkata if you are fond of night life, good music and a great crowd !! And definitely not a bad place to have a wing man by your side...

This probably is India's finest pub. I have been twice and have loved performance by varied band each time. This place is not about drinking, it about music and absolutely music. Crowd consists of music lovers first and drinks are secondary. Am originally from Ahmedabad, i was so much in love with this place that i arranged a business meeting at Kolkata and booked a room at park so that i can fly down to enjoy a night Some Place Else. Wish be here again soon and then again very soon.

A good place to chill with acquaintances or spend some solitary time over a pint or two of beer. Not much to choose from the food menu, I settled for pork sausages with corona. The night was good as some band was performing, the food was a good compliment to the ambience. The crowd near my seating was a little irritant though, but then again that is not the establishment's folly. Will definitely go there again when I am back in Kolkata.

Even though it is an old pub, SPE still holds some charm for me as it was the first pub I ever visited in my life! The nostalgia, the memories this place holds for me can never be forgotten. The live bands are an added bonus. If I were to criticize though, I would say their stock of beer should be living up to their fancy menu. Blanc and Stella usually being unavailable, one would atleast expect a cold frosty mug of Millers when one visits. Unfortunately, one is stuck with cliched bits of Fosters and Kingfisher. In the food menu, I usually prefer the pork but then that's a meat eater's choice.But everything said, I always make sure to visit atleast once, everytime I'm in Kolkata.

A great place for those who are neck deep into rock music. Ambiance is very appropriate for the kind of music it plays. The service is very smooth and customer friendly. Even when it's crowded which it is, the bartender will find you for your order and deliver precisely.

SPE has the highest hours of live music being played anywhere in Asia. The equipments are up to the mark and the bands are beyond just awesome. You might not always get a place to sit but that's the fun.. Right?? To me, it is best to take a stand by the bar close to the stage and dig in.

The food is above the mark too specially the sizzlers.. Some people might find the prices too expensive but then it's a 5 star deluxe hotel so you got to keep that in mind. I would love to go to SPE any day or anytime just because it's the place like no other.

It's also one of the few places where the same drinks change prices on the same night, unless you keep a close watch on the menu. They will run out of domestic beer at about 9 or 10 pm every night. Draft pitchers will run out even earlier.¬†

Its really just there now for rich people or first few dates people or those showing their out of town friends - a place in Kolkata with live music.

Its also a nice change of venue between Roxy and Tantra (on the same premises) , lord knows I'm not going to review those two, so...

Someplace Else or Some place else.

Ambience: perfect for booze and music lovers. Great place to hangout with your friends or special ones

Food: kebab platters both veg and non-veg  are amazing and compliment the booze pretty well  

One of the best live music pubs in the city.

With very few in Kolkata this is a pub indeed. You'll enjoy the place if you kind of like rock music. Live bands play occasionally. I guess on Saturday nights. Not sure. Go there if you want to enjoy a pub!

Cons.
1. It is too costly even for a small drink.
2. It's a pub so, there is no space for proper dancefloor.
3. Smoking place is so small and suffocating.
Pros.
1. Environment is pleasant.
2. Ambience is classy.
3. Food is worth the cost as per the standard of The Park.
4. People are good.
5. Waiters are on time always... if one takes the orders...
6. Songs give them extra comfort, if one is going there with a partner...
Now readers can ask why I mentioned cons first...
Ans is ... I went there with a friend at 31st night... there was an entry fee.... which is normally free, on that date it's 1000bucks... and drinks' cost is so high that I could not get drunk... :( ...
P.s. ask them for Pork Loin... its a dish with too much taste...for drink grabbers,it's a must try dish....I don't know if it's a 31st special dish!!! But gave us pleasure that night. :)

It's one of the most iconic places to visit in Cal especially if you are looking for some chilled out time, enjoying a drink or two or as many as you please along with some really cool live music. I love this place and have visited it innumerable times. I would highly recommend it to everyone which will definitely etch lovely memories and nostalgia for a long long time ...

They deserve a much better rating. Yet another one of Kolkata's iconic pubs, This place is certainly Someplace Else. It has a great ambience, with live bands every day of the week. And for a five-star outlet, it's great value for money. My experience was marred by a rude manager. I hope that kind of behaviour is not on offer, when you visit the place.

Ambience: It houses the best live music in the city. You think Kolkata doesn't have a Hard Rock Cafe? Well, we don't need one. We've got SPE. Awesome bands play awesome music over here and in total style, especially in weekends. Even the bartenders are super-cute. Decor is very classy and interesting with glass work on the ceiling, mural on the bar slab, framed posters on the wall, lights in the style of street-lamps and much more. Only problem is the space. It's pretty small and keeping in mind its huge demand, gets crowded easily. I rate it 4.5/5.

Food & Drinks: Only tried the Chili Blasted Baby Corn. Delicious but quantity was a bit less. You get a wide variety of drinks here, both domestic and foreign. However, I would recommend the cocktails, regardless of the high cost. It takes good skill to make a good cocktail and these bartenders have it. I have tried the Caipiroska and the Long Island Iced Tea. Former was a pretty plain lime based vodka cocktail, tasted nothing special, except that they magically drowned the bitter taste of vodka somehow but latter was mind-blowing. I have had cheaper LIITs in other bars but trust me no one makes it as good as SPE. Some of the beer brands are affordable and can be your choice if you are planning to go there regularly. They anyways, serve you complimentary crispy spicy chips to go with your drink. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Very good service is given by the bartenders, the bouncers and the sound engineers. They take their job very seriously and work hard to maintain the reputation of the place. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Yes it is pretty costly... both the food and the drinks. However, you can't complain with all that awesome music going on live in front of you.

Overall, I rate it 4/5.

Someplace else is a nice break from the huzzel and buzzle of Kolkata. The interior reminds me of many of the bars I have frequented in Scotland and England. But it  has several setbacks. 
First of all, the beer on drought is thin as water. This is no joke! It's flavourless and without body at all. Just don't go for it. 

Then there is the Ac, it is chillier then what is pleasant. It seem to me that whoever has set the temperature decided that colder = prestige... Not good. 

Then last but not least, the sound system. For a bar in such a nice hotel, it seems like they went and found a old intercom and wired it up to a group of badly maintained subs. The music choice was not bad, but the performance of the sound system made several of the favorite songs of my youth sound like a car tire being beaten with a stick. 



The crowd was fine and seemed respectful.

THE place in Kolkata. Synonymous with the city and quite simply the best watering hole and gig in town. The jury is out but this could be the best live music place in the country. Lots of issues with the place with non existent service, cramped surroundings and awfully crowded weekends. But for pure music experience in a pub, this is the place to be!

She was always been very nice and that's because of her nice ambiance, wonderful crowd and awesome music.. after visiting Kolkata and Somplace else after almost a year it seemed very different now. Signifying changing Kolkata, it explained me very clearly that other than music,crowd and beer it has another identity, "A posh pub under the name of The Park",it explained me very clearly on a packed up Saturday night if you are not coming out of a white BMW, it can just close its doors for you, this time I understood same as new Kolkata this place is also not mine any more. A short guy with a ponytail can just block your way and say that u cant enter because your shoe does not look good or may be you are wearing a sleeper or anything else.. and if u badly want to see her after a long time like me and request to get in that guy may call the security to remove an unexpected fly from the glowing crowd of nice shoes, white scenes and white BMWs ..

Hmmm..someplace else has been kind of a mixed bag for me. I rememver frequenting to this place mostly after work because their happy hours is kind of flexible (5.30-8.30) for office goers. This place is obviously very famous and has achieved thos cult status of being the classiest pubs in town. It is obviously in the centre of park street and u just cant miss it. True. But the sad part is that the patrons are ill-mannered. I dont know if it is the management or anyone else who is pressurizing them to attract more customers or something but they just dont listen to ur requests. One evening, i went their with a friend and we asked them to accomodate us on one of those bar stools, at that point in time, all of them were occupied, so he got us two chairs and we were asked to take up the spot opposite to the bar stools, trust me if u have been to spe, u know that how uncomfortable it gets wen u have to take up that tiny cringy place by the barricade. There is almost no place to keep anything on it except a drink. We kept aksing him to shift us to a better place but no avail. Once we were done with our drinks, we ordered beef nachos and sknce there was no place to keep the plate we asked him once again to get us to a better place and this guy comes close to me and tells me in chaste bengali: 'dada ekhne to dinner korbe na, snacks e khabe to ei jayga te adjust kore nao'. I mean who the hell comes up and talks to u like this, certainly not expected from the creme de la creme park hotel atleast. This is wen we sensed somethings fishy. After about half an hour after this we saw that the bar stools were available but purposefully reserved. Again on asking as to why we were not accomedated to one of those- this guy come up and says: 'ekhne meye feye na anle okhne bosa jabe na boss' and this is wen things turned ugly. These money minded pricks only wants girls in there so that it can bring in more n more people. It was the 4th or probably 5th time at spe for me but the experience  was horrbile.

Situated in the Park street it stands out as proclaimed.Out from the chaos and hustle bustle of Kolkata you reach finally a place which holds the classic English decor.While spending leisurely time at Kol, I was introduced to this place by a friend while I was searching for great music yet not a place too loud to chill out.As you enter,the Park's interiors fascinate you and on the right there's a small entrance to this place.The place is dimly yet well lit and at the front there's a small center stage.The best part of this place is they have a band performance once every week.Lucky enough we arrived on the right date.Both bar and food menu are fairly priced.They even offer happy hours 5 uptil 8.We ordered four large JW Double black,two pitchers of draught beer,a veg pizza and a veg platter.The food was up to the mark and served in fair time.The service is very good and the staff is well behaved and caring.They took care of our lappy and other items while we were in smoking lounge.All in all it was an awesome experience.Without anymore delay,go try it!

Visited many times n every single time I visit here I come up exclusively new experience. Its a heaven for music lover, with booze n live music, what else u need. On addition you get good food too. Experience at SMP is unforgettable with Amyt Dutta, Ehsaan Noorani, Parikrama and so on. Music lover or not its a must visit.

Been there a few times.... Ambience is ok, i would say many people over rate this place just because it is part of one of the most happening part of kolkata.... park street. At times they really bring in good bands but try to be there before the live band starts... Usually they don't start till half 8, PM..till then the oldies they play are really a drive down memory lane. The bartender tried to con me the first time i went with a glass of JD. The next time when i complained they gave me the right portion...what a smuck. Overall a nice time to hang around with friends till it gets over crowded.

One of the most iconic pubs in #Kolkata, Somplace Else is one the best places to head over to if you are looking to have fun or just relax. The food and drinks are awesome and so it the live music. A lot of people crub about the not so bit floor space of the pub, but that in no ways is a negative.
Someplace Else is probably one the best places to hangout in tge city.

Really nice music but a little too loud for the ambience and it's size. 
You can smell and absorb the old-ness and the great past of this place being one of the oldest. 

Though they don't have a particular drinks menu neither a vast variety of beers. 
Pint wasn't given itself or the whole bottle and beer wasn't served in the beer glasses or a dedicated chilled mug. Also, Overly priced. 
Members only nights not mentioned so one may have to choose Aqua or tantra or any alternative. 

Bar is constructed in a nice way but the service is slow, concentrated in one corner of the bar with only 2 attendants. You can't order or expect your drinks throughout the length of the bar. 
Few seating area are obstructed and can't witness live band visually. 

But there's still something which makes you stay here longer. 
I shall come back, definitely.

Another nostalgic place situated at Park Street which has a crowd of its own. Its been twenty years and is probably one of the first pubs to come up in the city. The cosy little place has the look and feel of an Irish pub with a small podium for rock bands to perform and entertain the crowd. It has a typical retro feel to it and the music is to do with rock music of all genres. If you are a rock music lover and a beer lover and want to do some head banging with friends then this is the place for you.

Apart from practically growing up there, my head reels with the amount of memories I have with this place. Will need a book to fill you in on how fun one can have on that simple rectangular strip of bar. Live music is one of the top reasons to be headed to SomeP as most of us did and continue to call it. They make a killer old fashioned. Their selection of bands were always good. You have to enjoy the power of crowds to have a complete experience in Someplace Else because this place gets packed. Last but not the least, don't forget to hang out with Gautam Da who is the best pub manager in my knowledge!

One of my favorite pubs as they play live music and most times its quality music. They also have a happy hour which I enjoy very much because of the 2+2. I go there with my friends often. The price is quite steep due to the 5 star rating as I heard and during heavy crowd they charge an extra entry fee but this can be avoided if one goes there around 6 when it is absolutely free.

Best place in Kolkata (or probably in all of India) for live music.. live bands everyday, my favorite Hip pocket plays Wednesday's and Friday's. They keep on having special performances and I have seen the likes of Indian Ocean and Parikrama live. The service is quick and warm, esp considering the crowd. Nothing great to eat (decent snacks/ finger food) is the only reason i had a bit of a doubt before giving it a 5 on 5.. at a point of time, used to be every Wednesday night affair for us.. :)

If there is a place which serves ambiance and not 'Food and drinks', that is some place else. Lovely ambiance. Live bands is definitely an attraction there, but not the only one. Its a place which you need to visit atleast once.

This place has very strong memories attached to me. Even though it has been few years since I last visited this place. But, I always n always made sure that whenever I visit Kolkata.. I dont go back without stepping in to "someplace else" atleast once. This place is so small, but amazes me as to how wonderful it is. The food, the live music, the ambience and the way this place has been built, it makes you fall in love with this place instantly. Its a pub which is located inside of The Park hotel @ Park Street. Its a 5 star hotel & is a famous landmark. I do not have much to say about the hotel itself.. But "someplace else" is beyond awesomeness. If you are in kolkata, please make it a point to visit this place. Weekend would be a great idea to step in compared to the other days. Recommended to all.

One of my favourite pubs in kolkata. I think I have started visiting this place from my eleventh standard when I didn't even know what exactly a pub meant. I have always liked the place for its ambience and good live bands. U will definitely feel lost in the music and would feel.relaxed. Otherwise, the food.is decent but there is nothing really outstanding things to mention about.

SOMEPLACE ELSE, at last after cancelling a lot of plans got to go here with a couple of friends. The place is pretty small with a lot less seating space than I thought but nevertheless very comfortable. There was no live music on the day i visited the place but the music they were playing was something that rock and roll lover will surely love. The cocktails on the menu are something that one must try but be choosy because some might not taste as tasty as they look on the menu. At the end of the day its a good place to catch on with some old friends, with some beer and nice music.

I heard a lot about it since I came to Calcutta a couple of weeks back so I decided to give the place a visit on my second Saturday night in the city. The first thing I noticed was it was a rather small place with only 3 sitting tables/corners barring the bar counter and few round seats opposite to the bar. Saturday night is supposed to be Blues night at the place as I went in rather early at 6:30 only to realize the live¬†band only kicks starts¬†post 9:30 (it was virtually empty when I initially came). So I had some time to kill before the "blues night"¬†began and decided to venture out and try some of the other places on the street and came back to the place¬†around 8:15 (happy hours end at 8:30) so I¬†thought it will be better to at least come 10-15 mins prior to that.¬†By the time I came back the place was chock-A-block. No¬†space to sit but with the 80's music being played the vibe around the place was¬†soweet.¬†Another thing I realized was that¬†most of the people who were at the place¬†seemed regulars as they knew the staff rather well. The first band- Plan B stated off at 9:30 and had he audience¬†moving to the beats straight away (playing self comps as well in between. I left the place at 11, although there was a second band expected¬†at midnight. Overall, a decent place to hang out and the staff is quite warm and helpful. Can't say anything about the food as all I had was few¬†glasses of wine¬†(-:¬†But when you have few 65-70 year old's dancing to the blues in a crowd which predominantly consisted of teenagers and people in their 20's, you know it's a pretty chilled out place. ¬†They place has¬†rock nights on three¬†out of the¬†5 weeknight, not really sure about¬†that though.

I couldn't find a better place for myself to chill out after a hectic week's work.
Almost every Friday and Saturday night this used to be the place where I was always to be found.
Some call it the Musician's Mecca of Kolkata and the others just come here to have a nice time.
Someplace else aka SomePE is a lounge which is situated in the famous Park Hotel of Kolkata.
If you are a true music lover who loves to dwell on whiskey on weekends and plans to go for something dry like kebabs or grilled fish,at the same time being a part of the jig,then you must be at Someplace Else.
The interiors are decorated with all the famous rockstars,you name it The Beatles,Lynard Skynard, Rasmus etc.
The lounge is in its 20th year now and the standards have remained the same.
The best of Indian bands and musicians have performed here.From the brilliant solos by guitar great Amyt Dutt to most popular of Indian bands like Indian Ocean have performed here.
Late night performances are mostly common here and the beer(though a little costly) keeps you going...
There is a separate smoking zone which in this place.Thanks a ton to the person who seriously cares about non-smokers like me.
Otherwise if you step into this place,you will not feel like coming out.Forget coming out,you will forget where you are when the alcohol starts to kick in...
The rest...I'll leave it up to you to find out....

The food is awesome, the service is amazing but the drinks are a bit on the higher side. Although we concentrated mostly on the drinks but would certainly berg in again on a weekend just to sway to the Live music :)

The up-side: Great location. Amazing ambience. Great music. Great drinks. Loved the Long Island Iced Tea. Good food. Loved the Pepper Chicken. Good service. Decent crowd. On the down-side: A bit on the expensive side. Lacks space for seating. Smoking area is a bit cramped up with no windows. The stage setup for bands was small. No dedicated dance floor. Track request might not be delivered as desired. Overall: A good place to spend the evening with friends if you can afford it.

This happens to be one of my favourite places in calcutta. The place promotes the best of local talent and the atmosphere is always electric. You can be sure to catch some of the best musicians in town jamming on stage. The lack of a cover charge indicates the sole purpose of having people connect to the music more prominent. The staffs always very friendly and the grubs amazing. The price is justified given the location of the place and the quality it offers. Cheers.

One of the best chill out place in Kolkata to have drinks with quality music. This will give you the actual feeling of a pub. everyday they arrange some music shows(it may be some bands or indivsuals). enjoying that show with a glass of wine is a heavenly feeling. the ambience, stuffs, management everything are at their best. along with they have a huge collection of drinks and cocktails.

now if i have to consider the cons, their biggest problem is the place is very small to handle a big crowd, hence sometimes the music becomes a bit loud. Also their price range is very high. but still i should recommend to visit here to feel the ambience...

If you wanna enjoy a proper pub this is the place to be in kolkata. This is a place were you can hang with your friends enjoy rock music.. And if you hardcore rock fan..theirs no better place than this...enjoying Pink Floyd ;-).
The beats of drums and the rhythm will make your body moving,it's always an awesome experience to visit someplace else.The illusive lights music took us miles away from reality.
Personally i don't visit here for foods i prefer beer and music to roll my mood. 
Some of the fantastic live band performance happens their. 
Its little pricey but i guess quality doesn't come cheap.

Last year at Durga puja time me, my bro nd my buddies hop in THE PARK'S "Some Place Else". 
Its an rock theme bar. 
Ambience of this place is living. When we entered this place its too crowded. We really dodged people to get a place near bar.
This place host the best band always. The vocalist was singing back to back popular rock nd roll tracks which made the crowd charged up.
This place offer some best food nd liqure in town. 
We ordered a large Jack Daniels on the rocks (for me as I prefer only this scotch) nd a large Chivas regal and finishing touch wid Taquila shots.
In food we had Chilly cheese mashroom its one of the best I had in town, crispy chiken its yummy and the chicken lollypop its juicy. 
The staff is so friendly.
At 2 pm we call for our bills it came rs. 23000 only. 
It consists of 5 large JD nd 5 large Chivas, food, nd 8 shots of Taquila nd 2 cocktails sex on the beach (cocktails r free frm the bar fr us).
Love the place its became on of the favouriate hot spot for me in kolkata.......will surely hop in there when agian I will be at my CiTy oF jOy.....

Now Eat Work Party repeat.......Cheers!!!!

Absolute favorite place in Park Kolkata. The place is known for live music played by kolkatas better bands. And the service is amazing. the guys at this pub remember your drinks every single time and though its a little expensive the crowd does get filtered. I have heard it was really happening place years back but right now as well i feel its a lovely place to have your evening drink. Some serious music and really nice drinks. they also have a nice smoking room. Must visit any day of the week.

Someplace else needs no introduction. The best pub in the city with the best combination of crowd, live bands, acoustic arrangement and of course great drinks and finger food. 

Popularly known as SPE or sumpe, it is the in house rock pub of Park Hotel but frequented mostly by young college people who come here to enjoy live rock bands. 

During my college days I was a regular on Sunday evenings when Cassini's Division used to perform here. Well that was almost 5-6 years back. I feel the pub has the best sound in the city. Though the place is pretty small and gets cramped during weekends and special occasions, still one of my favourite places to hang out and unwind over drinks and rock music. 

Yes drinks are expected to be expensive as SPE is a part of a 5 star property. Pint beers are priced around Rs400-Rs500 (including taxes).  I usually sit at the bar, so service is pretty fast even during peak hours. 
Definitely a must visit if you have not already and for people in Kolkata for a few days, try to spend your saturday or sunday evening at SPE :)

Someplace else is one of the places which reminds me I am in Calcutta. With its heavy wood setting and closely knit tables and always jam packed, it sets a totally different mood. From the old day elite with a glass of scotch to the generation x you will see them all enjoying to beat of the music. If you want to just enjoy a cosy conversation over beers or sway to the music of live regional as well as international rock ,this is the place to be.

The best place to witness the music scene of Calcutta. Well, that's what people told me and i paid a visit to this place. There was a local band playing covers of the Beatles, ac/dc and even Floyd. The ambience is perfect to meet up friends or even, like me, come alone for a drink or two with live music in the backdrop. Pretty cool numbers and decent drinks. Buzzes at night with activity, i came alone and left with friends. Loved the place. Need such places in Bombay.

If boozing with friends is in your mind n if you are a guitar fan.. love soft rock.. you gonna enjoy like anything.. I specially liked.. "whisky is my business".. the band plays that every weekends. Seating capacity is limited.. Arrive early or come if you don't mind standing.. We got place luckily.. Awesome snacks n food.. Efficient and quick staff.. All in all.. Go n rock on weekend with friends.

Kolkata is one place that I fall in love with every single time I visit. And quite interestingly it never fails to surprise me.
So I was at Park Street in Kolkata when one of my friends suggested we go visit Someplace Else. I have been to quite a few Lounges before and when I say you have to visit the place, means you actually need to. Especially if you are a night person and love to hangout with friends on a Friday nite. 
As far as the arrangements go, this place has got a good Rock Culture get up, with live shows being played on. You can go for any of the Shooters if you want. I liked m all.
Its always soothing to grab a pint of beer and listen to the Rock bands that perform there, if you are into that kind of stuffs.
All in all one of the best places to hangout with friends, and especially if you make your way to Park Street, this is "Someplace" you wouldn't wanna miss !

if you are in need of a perfect hangout place.. where you can sit with your special someone and talk life.. where you can get to listen to some of your favorite hard rock classics.. where you will not find other people ogling at you.. then you need to head to Someplace Else tonight.. With Lynard Skynard playing in the background. classy interiors, friendly waiters, their Mojito will taste spunkier.. then if you plan to stay more, the place invites bands to play live..
one suggestion though.. I went there on a Monday, a Wednesday and the Saturday of the same week.. and I found the same band playing.. a change could have been good..

Great place to hangout with friends. Live local bands play blues and rock. Has a separate smoking room which is full of colourful characters. All in all probably the most hip place to be in on park street.

 Be warned though local brands of beer start getting exhausted right about the time the bands start playing.  

Pros: good music cons: a little crowded when bands play.

Been there quite a few times and I must say that this is not going to be a very accurate review since I have never really stayed inside long enough! I have almost always jumped over to Roxy or Tantra - but here's a quick take : for the best live music experience in Kolkata coupled with a lively ambience and reasonably priced drinks, this place is an unmissable entity! Do go there every time you feel like hanging out with old college buddies or work colleagues or your sweethearts! This is yet another place that is deeply entrenched in the Kolkata legacy chronicles!

Someplace Else was a place I have visited regularly since the day it opened .... after food music is my second love so naturally SPE which is a perfect blend of both is a place I have hung-out at regularly for years. They serve up typical pub-grub and finger food though on request they will rustle up a Club-Sandwich or Burger for you if your hungry. 
My recommendations for the food for Non-vegetarians  ---  Sea Food Platter which is yummy , Chicken Pepper Salt tastes awesome especially with a nice cold beer , Double Cooked Pork Chops .... juicy and tasty !
For the vegetarians --- Cheese Tootsies with Chili ( perfect snack) , Mixed Basket of Fries and the Tex Mex Twist what I call fun food ... spot on.
If you are a drinker try the Limoncello Liqueur ... lovely stuff and not available in most places first had it at a friends place years back and love it since. For the cocktails my vote goes to Jumping Jack Flash. Beside these they have a well stocked bar with all the regular stuff so if you want to hear good music and eat pub grub drop by SPE especialy on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and let the good times roll !!!!!

Looking for a place for Rock Music! This is the abode of Rock Music in Kolkata. In kolkata you will see a guitar in almost 3/10 people and they have a great taste in music ranging from S.D Burman, Classical, Rabindra Sangeet all the way to Rock. Now this place is the Mecca of Rock music in Kolkata. Do they play good music? Of course they do. New and budding to the well known bands; everyone comes here to play. Thursdays to Saturdays are the best days to be here. A relatively small place but there will be no lace to stand inside once you enter. Load some pints, listen to some Jazz and Alternate Rock away from the Techno/trance tracks. If you love Lennon, Cobain, Morrison or the likes you will definitely find this place happening. I have been to this place more than often and seen Parikrama, Indian Ocean etc. performing. I even went when the place celebrated its 15th anniversary. A lovely place inside the park Hotel. I have not been to this place recently but I would any day head to SPE if i am in Kolkata.

Yes they always play your songs at Someplace Else. Always.

As I detest the latest rage in music, that monstrosity by the name of Electronic Dance music, its always comforting to back to the haven of rock music. Is there a more iconic place in the city, nay make that country, which patronizes this adrenaline rushing, head banging, teeth clenching form of delirious pleasure. Budding as well as established & vaunted bands find pride of place at the stage and croon away to glory. 

May the riffs and the bass-lines always keep on ringing. To misquote the great Jim Morrison "The future is certain and the end is never near" for Someplace Else.

It was our first visit to Kolkata and almost everyone we spoke to suggested a visit to someplace else. Before we entered, we were awestruck by the interiors of the park hotel and the western style cafe cum lounge right outside.

The lounge itself was quite small.So this is a place where local bands play is what we were told and there was a band playing for the night which my music-loving friends did like. With the dark ambiance and focus on the band, the mood was all set for people to enjoy the music.  But it was quite loud out here and impossible to talk. Drinks menu was extensive and looked good. Talking about the food which was a veg platter of nachos, kathi roll and jalepeno poppers, I have never been more disappointed. Dry nachos with a very ordinary salsa, and a dry and tasteless kathi roll. The poppers were decent. For the 1300 we paid for the platter, a beer, a breezer and a coke we could only curse ourselves. 

But lesson learnt- this is the place to go only if you wanna enjoy the music over a few drinks.

You don't go there for food... you go there for the music, the crowd, the ambience. One of the most happening places of Calcutta and not to forget the most lively of all, Someplace Else is actually someplace else only.
You just need to go there once.. and I can bet you will go there every weekends.
The Live music is the star attraction and food and drinks are by the way...
Still if you need to pick something to just munch on.. you can order the seafood platter which gives you the variety without making you think too much on what to order and the Tex Mex Twist for the vegetarians.
A must if you visit Calcutta.

Some of the great memories I have about this place. The ambiance is electric there. Good music, crowd and little over priced alcoholic beverages. It wasn't really possible to go for the drinks there but once upon a time my sunday used to mean Someplace else. From head banging crowd to losing a friend's specs in the maddening crowd....plenty of memories are associated with that place....Went there for mainly music and loved the whole atmosphere. In kolkata this is definitely a must visit place. Absolutely Recommended.

Amazing ambience. If you have a little money this a perfect place to go to... Its a lot of fun!
Waiters are courteous.
Pork chops were yummy a little under cooked though but immediately the waiter took it back n replaced it!
Jager bombs are priced high compared to other places but they were good too.

The place where I enjoy the blues. This is Kolkatas flagship pub and the location is jsut right. Park Hotel is a lovely place to be in and someplace else is where the music blares, the heart enjoys and the ear aches. The draught beer has to be pre-booked since it finishes quickly but it is highly recommended. Also recommended is the vodka served in chilled tall glasses filled with ice and sprite. However, if you have hard alcohol, be prepared to say a hard goodbye to cash since the prices here are quite high.

Someplace Else hosts the best musicians of the city and most of the time I just enjoy the draught beer and the chilly chicken or the crispy chilly babycorn. The chicken kebabs are also nice to have with the beer.

I would not recommend dinner here since the atmosphere is crowded and the place (including the stage) very small and one remains thankful that the smoking section has been placed outside the pub.

You must visit someplace else at least once if you are a lover of rock or blues music.

Since the day I came to Kolkata, almost a month ago, I've been waiting to go to this place. So, this Saturday night, I was finally able to make it, and boy oh boy, was I in for a treat!
Now, having lived in Bangalore and Delhi for a long time, I can tell you that there are not as many options for a rock n' roll pub in Kolkata as one may wish for, but this place certainly changes your perception. 
We went there around 9 o'clock and found  the place to be cramped! It's a small place and it was Saturday night, so needless to say, we found ourselves standing. The Indian band Plan B were playing some alternative rock numbers which had really set the mood. Later on, the band Saturday night blues performed along with Ehsaan Noorani, and was totally blissful.
I can not comment on the food, as we did not order any. We had a couple of beers and I would like to point out that they charged almost double the amount that is mentioned in the menu here (Rs. 600 a pint and we only had the option of Heineken or Corona). Nevertheless we had an amazing night.

My rating here is purely based on their quality of music, the sound system, the ambiance and the like minded crowd. 
Looking forward to the next Saturday night!
Definitely, definitely recommended!

Excellent ambiance. Wonderful live music. This place is filled to the brim during Puja days and Christmas / New Year time. On normal days, you can easily find a table here. The DJ here usually plays well known music. The place just booms with music. Had cocktail many times here, and those were just fabulous! The live performances go on till 11 or 12am, and the lounge is open usually till as late as 2 to 3 am. Probably the best place to be in Kolkata.

Someplace Else place is an old favourite. There was a time I would go there every Saturday to hear the Blues band, but over the years the place has gotten very crowded and there is barely any space to even move your feet. Because it is so crowded it is very difficult to eat anything there. There are only about two or three tables and a few bar stools which are mostly occupied and even if you find a table you will probably find a stranger standing right next to you with a beer in his hand. The music is loud so forget about catching up with your friends and hoping to get a conversation started. It's a good thing smoking is not allowed inside anymore. I have always wondered about the fire safety there. The place has just one small door which is the entry and exit both and is packed to the brim.

Having said all that, nobody goes there to eat. Its a great place to have a few beers, just stand and listen to the band. I usually keep a tab at the bar as it makes it easier getting your refills. I just love this place but I only wish it was a little more spacious.

It was my first visit.. and i just couldn't imagine how beautiful it could be.. the ambiance.. it's awesome. We reached there a bit earlier so didn't get the opportunity to enjoy the live rock music. You have to enter through the main gate and go straight towards the end before the end of the lobby it was situated at your right, or else you can go inside through the parking and its just in front of you.
As situated in a five star hotel the price is good. The behavior of staffs, bar man, managers are very good. Its was quite a pleasant evening at "some place else" inside the park. We haven't tried any food there... just drinks.. Will go there again

this is the place to be , if you are searching for a wonderful ambience , great live rock music , super chilled beer. its located inside the park hotel and you have to walk right  through 'the street' to reach SPE.
I am visiting this place since last ten years and i have lot of memories and feelings associated with this place. back in 2005 it was our music pit every sunday evening when cassini s division used to rock that slot. this place is associated with some golden memories .at that time smoking was not banned inside and the place used to be a heaven for me. fogged with smoke , stage lights,alt rock music,the energy of the crowd ,the smell of the alcohol,the headbangings ,all created a magical charismatic feeling. it has its way of taking away all your worries and frustrations in your struggling life.
it is definitely 'the pub' for me and my friends still now . someplace else continues to keep its charisma and spell to each and everyone who visited this place.

If you are a regular to this place, you almost surely will have a love-hate relationship with this pub. And more often than not, in spite of the bubbling hatred, love wins over purely due to the sheer quality of musicians belting out soothing music, the like minded music oriented people, the long adda sessions with friends over a pitcher of beer and yes, the headbanging !

I still remember that days when I used to visit this place regularly each Sunday evening at 6 to watch my then favorite band from Kolkata, Cassinis Division belt out one hit after the other. And we, the people literally used to bring the place down with our headbanging and body-surfing. If you are a music lover you will absolutely love this place as long as you don't suffer from claustrophobia. Undoubtedly, this is the best place in Kolkata for live music. Now for the cons,

1.  The place is very small and at times the bouncers/waiters might try to get all hoity toity and act smart with you. 
2.  Being a part of Park Hotel, the rates of beverages are exorbitant and will burn a hole in your pocket.
3.  When the place is almost full, priority will be given to the regulars and first timers will have to haggle with the bouncers to let themselves in.

Would still recommend this pub to any music lover and will rate this 4 just for the awesome music, musicians, crowd and the innumerable memories :) ..

I don't have any words to explain about this place. This place is truly out of this world and rightly named 'Someplace Else'. I've had wonderful and memorable times with my friends here. This is one place where I just forget about my tensions and worries and this is one place where I could be myself without worrying what the person sitting(or standing) next to me would think about me. Awesome music, awesome service. For beer drinkers, I would suggest to go for draught beer which is filled from the tap to your beer mug or a pitcher instead of the normal bottled beer. DJ Austin plays awesome music during the late evenings. This is a place where I could end up in a nice conversation discussing about anything under the sun with a stranger sitting next to me. To sum up, this is the best place on earth(or at least Kolkata) since I cannot think of a better place than this. It is a bit costly which is understandable being a part of a five star hotel, but at the end of the day, its worth paying the money for the complete experience. My all time favourite place.

Love this place. I don't go there for the meal kinda food, but for a great hangout. The ambience, the people, the music bands playing live music, the energy, the booze....   awesome is the one word that describes all parameters.

I have seen the place when it's packed to the brim, as well as when it's utterly empty. Love it both ways. Only problem this place has is the total surface area.... which is as big as a pin-head for a pub (deducted 0.5 from my rating for that).

So if you're in Park Street looking for happening place, remember I told you about this one.

There are a few very key reasons why Park has been able to maintain a pub like Someplace Else without losing much of the crowd, be it the elderlies or the youngsters. First, 'once a music lover always a music lover'. Hence, no matter what the age, people do turn up here no matter whenever they can. Second, the ambiance is amazing for a pub. I've been there when it was jam packed, on private occasions and also when the place is absolutely empty. This is the best hangout for people in the heart of the city. There might be other places popping up and trying to develop a hold on the 'pub scene' but very little can be done to remove SPE from it. Next, live music with booze! Might be a little heavy on the pocket, but come on! Think about the band, each member, each instrument. There is something you owe to them also. So when you put it all together, it's fine. *Though you'll still feel you are paying too much while actually paying* Coming to the music, the in house bands could clean up their acts a bit.

Everything cut out,SPE still attracts an overall audience of interest who actually want to spend time listening to a live band and enjoying a drink.

Overall, time well spent! Ambiance well enjoyed and an experience well imbibed.
Cheers!

Someplace else (SPE) is a name which makes my taste buds get excited. I don't think there is any place in the city that comes even close to a place like this . The ambience,the bands,the music -everything - it is a world of its own . If you are going there don't pick your brains deciding which cocktail to get. Just order a neat drink and enjoy the night . You have to try the cheese kulcha there. Some may find it a little too cheesy but I could lick off the plate . You get draught beer on some days if you are lucky ,so if draught beer is available definitely go for that . Without a doubt my favourite beer place in the city.

Someplace Else (SPE) is the best hangout spot in the city of joy. If you are a music buff and love live performances this is the place to be in the city. Every night there is a live band and I love the music on wednesday, friday and saturday. The beer is slightly expensive though and not always you would get the draught beer. But I think its a small price that you pay for the great evening that you will get to spend here. You can find avid music fans head banging to the great music that is played here. The bands which play here and which I like are Hip Pocket, Saturday night blues and Pseudonym. Sometimes guest bands from Shillong, Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai also play at SPE and this just makes it more awesome. 5/5 to SPE

Writing a review for SE has many facets - the crowd, the music and the food. It is a well established fact that the first 2 are amazing so let me concentrate on the food bit. While it is expensive (quite natural in such a classy hotel), the taste is literally too good. I ordered for the veg platter, non veg platter and double cooked pork chops. All 3 were excellent and had lots of variety. To add to it excelkent music. A definite thumbs up!!!

So on my initial visit to Kolkata me and my friend dropped into the most happening pubs in the most iconic structure in an equally riveting Park Street. My fellow Kolkata friends used to boast that 'Someplace Else' is the best of all the Park pubs in entire India and it was this statement which heightened my curiosity to see if the sentence had any truth in it.

Upon entering I think we were quite early at 8:30 coz that was when the crowd was trickling in and we ordered for pints of beer and the Non-Veg Kebab Platter. The live music hadn't started yet and coming to the pub, it was the most closeted pubs I've ever been to. The area is so small and a deck of instruments and speakers are right near the seating area reducing it even further.

Finally at 10 the musicians decked up their instruments to start their show but we were already feeling claustrophobic within such small and confined place. The Non-Veg platter was good and the few beers that we had, well nothing can go wrong with packaged drinks.

To people who claimed it to be the best well the pubs Kismet and Aqua in the Hyderabad Park are huge and better in pricing but I'll consider one point though. The crowd over here is much better, better vibe,and it's people who enjoy their music thorughly and I'll give anything to hang out with such a crowd. 

The experience is quite a good/bad of sorts and it turned out to be pretty average from the expectations I'd set myself to believe in. Well a definite good pub but I've been to much better ones

Been there quite a long time back and absolutely loved the place.. A great place to enjoy live music and your drink.. Specially liked the energy of the place.. Initially, when we entered, which is around 7:30, the place looked so dull that we wanted to leave, but after 8, its face changed completely.. Thoroughly enjoyed the music, ambience and style in which the place has been designed. Only one con which I know all will agree to - The place is too small to accomodate a large number of people. Kind of feels suffocating once a group comes in. Gets a 4 from me for the lovely atmosphere and music despite the space issue.

Yes the place is a tiny closet. 
But it is the closet that will lead you to the land of magic and music that will create everlasting memories. From Purna Das Baul, to Indian Ocean, to their regulars Hip Pocket, this place is "the place" for Live Music in Kolkata.

Yes the place is expensive.
But although the food is great, the cocktails even better, no one is going to ever ask you to actually order one. You are more than welcome to just sit in a corner in one of their plush comfortable sofas(or you might just have to stand, because the place is always crowded)and enjoy the music with your friends, without spending a buck.Also by the way, their cocktails are more than worth every single buck.

Yes the place is always crowded.
But that is because this place is an eclectic magnificent mix of amazing music, fabulous people, great drinks, and perfect ambiance. It could be a high end pub anywhere in the world, is very cosmopolitan(and they make a very goof cosmopolitanism as well) but also has something very uniquely Kolkata about it.

I highly recommend.

Walk through all the plush interiors of "the park" and then you land up in this haven, an old English style pub has carved out a distinct niche for itself among the PYTs. The pub itself looks like a dated wild, wild west watering hole. The ambiance is just perfect of course you have to love some good music. Kolkata's best bands perform here on a regular basis so you are in for a musical extravaganza. 

The only downside to it is that the place is a a tad small for the footfall it handles, A pint of beer is about 250 bucks. Rest of the menu pertains to its 5 star standard. (pricey)

Overall a good decent place to unwind with friends to some foot tapping music and the best part of it is that there are no cheapos hanging around at SPE!! 

Drop by after 9pm to take it all!!

I have a long standing love-hate relationship with this place. Love wins over. The music, people and the draft beer... all add to the ambiance so perfectly. Love SPE.

Also, while you are at it, go check out the beer, the wine, and all, but don't forget the Mojito. Its one thing that SPE is really famous for, apart from the music. Which, on normal days, is good, and on good days, is amazing. Plus, the DJ takes requests when accompanied with wide-eyed pleading stares, and the promise of pouting if he does not play it. :D

A definite halt if one is looking for live music. Various bands perform here and  at times  you even get see them compete which can be quite a thrilling experience. A rock culture prevails here and that's what keeps the place going. The only let down is the space, too small in comparison to the crowd it pulls every weekends. However, the ambiance is good, food and drinks are great and there is an array of options. 

Can  be expensive but nonetheless a great hang out joint. Also reminds me of the  pubs i have been too in the UK . Has an english touch !!! 

Overall good head banging experience!!!

Someplace Else. What does this tiny little flicker of maddening energy have to do with food, you ask? I assure you that it is cleverly designed as a restaurant to snare an unsuspecting Park Street visitor and ensure that he or she has a maddeningly amazing night full of excellent music and charming people and usher said person outside post midnight, craving for some more.
The food is good, yes, but the city's bands are what make the place the left ventricle of Park Street. One could get lost easily in the strains of the music, and when the band is playing not two feet away from you it's just the music that matters.
The only downside of SPE is that it is quite small, and its littleness is even more evident when a well-known band is performing and the entire club fills to the brim with people, and then it's not fun anymore.

Because some place else deserves, it really does.
I went to some place else a few months ago with some of my cousins from usa. I wanted to show them the rocking nightlife of kolkata and took them to an exact place.
We entered with beats of drums and found our body moving with the rhythm. It was an awesome experience being there. The illusive lights, music took as miles away from the reality.
We had beer and a few snacks which boosted our intoxication to extremity. I'm waiting when the 31st night will come and i will revisit some place else. I jus luv it :-)

Yes, the beer is great and the food is good, but you don't go to SomeP for food. You go there because you want to have a drink and enjoy the best of the best of Kolkata's Bands playing live in front of you.

For me its more of THE place for music in Kolkata. I have been fortunate enough to play for an Open Mic there, and the experience there has been amazing. I have been going there for three years now, and it is always a place where nobody bothers you.

The sole exceptions are those days when someone special comes to perform (and many do), for on those days the joint seems tiny against the number of music lovers that gather there.

This place is perfect for my taste, and would love to go back always.

P.S: There is a smoking room in Someplace else, and help will be given at someplace else to those who ask for it! (its on the left side of the bar, just ask!)

I wish I could put my own pics I clicked at Some Place Else, the Park. The Ambiance is amazing and of a new feel. You enter smelling the essence of desserts and pastries with Frozen Ice on the right when you walk in. 
You enter the next half to see the most dazzling Sea fishes, they are yellow and red. You look above you see a unique style of Chandeliers. You feel you sit down under the sparkling stars with tiny LED yellow lights.
When you finally enter Some Place Else, Ouu.. Its dark and Noisy - Noisy I say I say Music.
Some Place else is one such place which you would find really economical if you have come from an another state, have freshly brewed beer. Ask for the Munch ins, you would love to eat them. Enjoy the music for you would always have live shows from bands in Kolkata.
This is one such place that fills Park Street with happiness.

To anyone who isn't acquainted with this place, it is truly the 'Hard Rock Cafe' for Calcuttans. This is THE place to go to, if you want to have a drink and let some good old classic rock wash over you. 

Its located right inside the hotel, so you'll have to go inside and climb down. The place isn't very big though; there's a severe shortage of seating if a popular act is on. 

Don't let that deter you though. SPE (as its fondly known) has been loved for quite a while by the rock lovers of the city, if you're one of them, bite the bullet and drop in on a a night. Who knows, you might get swayed by the Beatles or Floyd? ;)

the best place to hang out with friends and enjoy live music, the red wine (four seasons) is the thing that pulls me to em... a bit expensive but if u hit the happy hour the beer price is attractive.. the cheese balls are not so much hit for me.. as i find them rawish .. but other than that its a hit!

Someplace Else is clearly meant for two types of customers:

If you enjoy the evenings with friends or the loved one sipping wine and shouting at each other (the loud music!), this is one place you should definitely try out.

For all music lovers who 'want it all' for the midnight, drop in after 10:30 (typically when the live bands gear up for the night) for a good live music experience; but do not expect places to sit which by then have been occupied already by the other category of customers since early evening. Beers are cheaper options at around 250-300 bucks a pint!
