Very shady place. One of worst punjabi food I have ever eaten. I paid 140 ds for a veg thali which was very bad in taste, looked unclean, and served in messed up condition. That kind of food you can get in 40 RS in roadside thela and hopefully would be better in taste. 

Tusi kalank ho punjabiyan te....

‚òÖDON'T COME HERE‚òÖ If you're in New Market and hungry, if there are no stalls open around, this place is a ‚òÖMUST AVOID!‚òÖ. This place is infested with dozens of mice in the kitchen which roam around on their cooking utensils!

Look into the kitchen's corner(middle slab), sitting opp to the refrigerator if you don't believe me. I wouldn't have ordered if I had seen it before our food was served!

We got, (consider other reviews if you consider the mice infested kitchen, but I won't rate it or write anything)
Keema Paratha
Mutton Kasha
Chicken Do Pyaza
Chk Tandoori half
Salad
Tea
Sprite(10/10): Because it comes from the company!

Don't go here for ambience but for simple food and great price. Nestled in an alley in the super crowded new market area, the looks are unpretentious- dhaba like. We had aloo dum (not that great as it was not dry), bhindi masala (great), paneer kadai (very good) and dal makhni (thick and delicious). We had all this with tandoori rotis and nimbu paani (simple & homely). We finished this up with 'kadak' tea. And for all this we paid around 500 rupees for 3 which was great.

Ordered food via zomato delivery. The food was delivered before the designated time but unfortunately the food was not good. The matar keema had this weird smell. Don't know how to explain it. Not spoiled but not good. The dal butter fry was a runny dal. The garlic naan was below average. The chicken butter masala was the only decent tasting thing. Food quality needs to be changed and improved.

I had a great time here. It was a break from the monotony of airconditioned restaurants. It was like being back to roots. This is a place where the food is the sole hero. I had mutton kasha, keema matar accompanied with tandoori roti and plain roti. The tandoori roti was hard though. Go for it if you want a true highway dhamba experience.

Having Punjabi khana ia treat to my tastebuds always and specially when its khalsa, you get some of the most authentic punjabi dishes. This place is pocket friendly and one can have  'pet bhar ke khana' for two at Rs 300/-.
One suggestion to the management would be a quick renovation of the interiors and the menu would attract more guests since this is located at a place where food traffic is huge on a daily basis.

Situated in hubbub of new market area, this place had never really caught my attention. But thought of giving this place a try today. Honestly speaking, the look of this place is not at all fetching. It is really shabby and looks pretty untidy too. They offer a variety of Punjabi foods at an ok-ish price. I tried their makai roti and chicken with saag. The rating is attributed solely for the food. The chicken was awesome! And some points for the very friendly staff.  You know a good smile adds that little extra zing to your food! But they really should look into their decor.

This was one of the small restaurant I preferred to order while my stay in the city. On a rainy night when I was searching for a veg joint. Someone recommended this joint. At the first sight, I wasn't sure about the quality and service. But they proved me wrong.They offer awesome food at reasonable prices and quantity is also good. My fav was dal,jeera rice and Amritsari chole.

Visited this place after a long time the taste had gone down a bit but it's still good for someone who is longing for some good North Indian Punjabi food. I would request the restaurant owner to just tune the food back as it was earlier to make it great again.

At a first look, you may not think of having a meal here. But don't just go by the looks. The place may not be air conditioned, but it's surely a legendary place. The restaurant is thronged by Indians & foreigners alike. You will get one of the best Punjabi dishes, Lassi, Tea over here. Sometimes it can be hard to find a seat here as the place is located in one of the most popular shopping districts in Kolkata. A visit here is must if you are in the New Market area.

Situated at the busy lane of New Market this food joint has been there for ages now. A lot of theme dhabas have come into existence in the city these days but this place is a quintessential punjabi eatery with the rustic feel of Punjab. There is nothing good about the ambiance here... it is a typical dhaba type joint where you get amazing punjabi food at a fair price. The kababs are just too good and the taste is going to linger in your mouth for a very very long time. The garlic naan...the chicken tandoori, chicken irani... oh my mouth is watering as i am typing these words :p Try out their chicken bharta and palak paneer for sure. I bet you will not get this taste in the fancy punjabi restaurants anywhere in the city. There is this waiter who has been there forever and as you enter will make you feel so comfortable that you will not be able to leave without ordering. Overall it is the place for foodies and not people who are looking for some good decor and ambiance.

This is a prefunctory rating since we did not have food (only 3 cokes). This review is to warn future diners about the waiter (don't know if he has been fired yet). Will certainly add a proper review with a proper rating once I visit it a second time (as I certainly wish to).
¬†I and two of my friends went there and ordered three atom cokes because we had a heavy lunch somewhere else and we wanted something to wash it down. The MRP apiece, as you know, is Rs 8, but the waiter wished to con us into thinking that the restaurant charged 15 bucks each (nearly double the price) so that he could make us shell out Rs 45 instead of Rs.24. Luckily the owner heard us and caught on to his tricks, and we got the proper change. So please be careful if you want to buy soft drinks on your next visit to this place.

Two extremely drenched dames entered Khalsa Restaurant around 7.20 pm in the evening and wanted some damn food. The waiter came, smiled, gave them menu cards, and left. They ordered the following - french toast, reshmi kabab, lachha paratha, aloo paratha, chana masala. 

Man went away. 

Two moderately drenched dames came slightly late, and they sat down and ordered the following - chicken irani, tandoori roti, aloo paratha, anda paratha, reshmi kabab, coffee, tea, liquor tea, and hot chocolate. Oh, and two bottles of water.

And also a banana custard pudding, which one of those dames, who is a very bad influence on humankind, proceeded to apply all over her aloo paratha, and commenced eating, to the utter shock of this poor writer, who is still reeling from the shock of it all! 

The aloo paratha. Was. Divine. 

So was the Chana masala. 

The Reshmi kabab was average.

The tea and coffee were both very good - hot, sweet, slightly bitter in the case of coffee. 

The bill came for 1007 rupees. 

The four dames were very very very very satisfied. 

Half marks were deducted for the underwhelming egg paratha. Otherwise, life was a good place to be.

Khalsa Restaurant is probably one of the oldest Punjabi restaurants in the New Market Area if not the city and definitely one of the best.
So imagine my surprise when I did not find it listed in Zomato ! I requested Zomato to add the restaurant and they did it immediately.

It is a tiny restaurant on Madge Street connecting New Market with Sudder Street and serves authentic home-style cooked Punjabi Food. They also see a heavy footfall of foreigners and so also have things like Peanut Butter Sandwich on their menu, which I have never tried. The restaurant is small and not very high end but it is spanking clean. Even I, do not mind drinking their normal water. There is one waiter who is omnipresent and always smiling. The restaurant owners I believe, double up as cooks as well.

Their food is brilliant in general but I want to talk about the lunch we had their last Saturday specifically.

This is what we ordered initially amongst the three of us.
================================
1. Mutton Rice : 1 plate
2.Mutton Kasha :1 plate
3. Chicken Rashmi Kebab : 2 plates
4. Chicken Tandoori (Full) : 1 plate
5. Irani Chicken : 1 plate
6. Matar Keema : 1 plate
7. Tandoori Roti : 4

The server came and told us that they were out of Keema Matar so we replaced that with Chicken Bharta  and ordered an extra plate of Kalmi Chicken because SB thought it sounded nice. Later just for savouring the gravy of the Mutton Kasha SB and PB2 ordered white rice.

I heart the food they serve. It tastes brilliant and it is light and non- greasy.

Let me start with the Reshmi Kebabs. They are soft and succulent and buttery and just melts inside your mouth. The Tandoori Chicken here should be a benchmark of the Tandoori chickens made across the city. They are charred to the right amount and the chicken itself stays juicy and soft.  The Chicken Bharta with the shredded piece of chicken in this super delicious gravy has light and finger-licking good. The Irani Chicken comes in a red gravy which again is amazing. The Kalmi chicken comes in a garlicky white sauce which is to die for. The best part is the poultry itself is fresh. The Mutton dishes (which I did not taste) was proclaimed to be the best  both KB and PB2 had in the longest time. I also love the Tandoori Rotis here which are made of Atta and not Maida and is a perfect accompaniment to all the dishes. 

I keep on coming back here and plan to come back here for the longest time.

And the best part with all the above dishes and three Masala Thumbs Up our bill was 900 bucks.
