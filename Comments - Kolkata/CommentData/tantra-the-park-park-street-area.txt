Cramped dance floor, indifferent staff and just okay music. One word to describe the place - Average. 

Most fascinating thing - a pint of beer costs 900‚Çπ and sorry there are no choices, they only serve one particular type (Heineken or tuborg it was). The cover charges don‚Äôt include any food or drink and I am not here to crib on that but I guess world elsewhere has moved on to better and consumer friendly business models. Here, it‚Äôs technically a ripoff.

I hope there must be better places to chill out in Kolkata and maybe this place is all about its historical value.

The only way it can be enjoyed is when you fill your gastronomic requirements elsewhere and come here solely for the dance and music.

Positives - Location and the vigilant security staff.

For dance & party thos is good, but drinks & food ( without any offer) is too costly unnecessary & doesnt go with quantity. A beer which cost actually 275/_  they  are charging 870+ Tax. Else, nice DJ, nice dance floor, nice offers. Suggestion: Booze some where else, get intoxicated & then get into dance floor of Tantra with your partner.

I visited Tantra at 9 30 on a saturday night to find it almost empty except a few girls enjoying their happy hours. And then they left. They dont have a menu. The beer available for me were close to a 1000 bucks for a pint and were different from what the ladies were having. A LIIT was 1600 bucks. The DJ said the party starts at 12 30. Ofcourse i didnt have the patience to stare at an empty dance floor for 3 hours. Or watch the bar tender practice his juggling skills and failing miserably dropping the glasses all over the floor. Hence, plan your visit to Tantra strategically to enjoy the place. People of Kolkata recommended it highly.

The staffs are not so friendly (not rude either) and the food is EXCESSIVELY OVER PRICED and to make the pinch even stronger, the quantity is meager and tastes absolutely ordinary.

This place is located inside the Park Hotel. One of the most hyped clubs in Kolkata. So a friend and me decided to try it out. No hassle in getting an entry. The ambience and the crowd was out of this world! Nice loud music made it even better! Cheers to the DJ. But, this place is overpriced to the core. A pint of Heineken costs 770 bucks! Had a decent night overall.

THE TANTRA MANTRA..

The Park is a brand name and some of its restaurants get the benefit of it. There's nothing special in Tantra - neither the food nor the service. And unfortunately our visit coincided with a Silver Wedding Anniversary celebration hosted in the Mink Room which is why the waiters were more busy attending there...

It is one of the so called hottest night spot in Kolkata and quite a frequent for all night out folks visiting, The Park. The ambience is quite cool which plays some good songs but it is loosing the charm based on the crowd that is coming along and really needs to be spiced up if it wants to continue with its fame and glory. A good place to chill with your pals but the crowd could be a dampener at times.

You go to Tantra with a lot of expectations. I have done so at least thrice before typing this down.  But every time it has been  a major let down for the kind of down market crowd they allow in,  the fu*** up cocktails they serve, the humongous bill they charge and the outdated speakers they play.  All in all, a place which needs a major overhaul. Is the management listening??

Pretty good place to party. Had been there once for the Friendship Day bash. It's a moderately spaced area with a dancefloor and bar area with bar stools and chairs around it. We had sat there. There is also a separate sitting area which looks cosy with sofas and cushions. The lighting is dim which sets the mood. Drinks were on the house for ladies which was pretty cool üòÅ . The bartenders were cordial.The DJ was good and hence we danced a lot. Enjoyed to the fullest :-)

Place is ok, but the management and staffs are rude. The have lot of attitude because they work for a 5 start company. May be The Park is promoting Someplace and Roxy more than Tantra and they want to move Customer from Tantra to their other pubs.¬†
You have to cross the parking road which itself degraded the ambiance. You can still see few crowd just because of the Old days fame. Will not recommend any of my friend to this place.¬†

Suggestion to management: May be you should change the staff(Manager) or you should shutdown!

I called them and asked if they allow stag, they said no. I asked charges for couples. They said Rs700. 

I reached there alone, asked them if they can allow me, as this was once in a while trip from Banglore to Kolkata. They said no.¬†

I asked if I can approach girls who are entering, they said I can try.

¬†When I approached they said I can‚Äôt do that. When I asked why? They said not in front of the door. I agreed, went outside.

Approached a group of 3 girls, they agreed to accompany me, even though they don‚Äôt like Bollywood, they agreed to come along. 

When I went there, there was a manager ‚ÄòRajnish( or something)‚Äô who told, the guards not to allow me. I asked why, he has no answer and started using abusive language. When I said I am not entering but stop using abusive words, he started calling Boxers to move me out.¬†

I had no option then to come out(who want to mess with Boxers‚ò∫ (But they were nice with me) ¬†).

Suggestion To Mgmt: Have a rule, which is same for all. All staff should know about rules. Don‚Äôt use abusive words with guest and use boxers only when there is a problem, not to show your strength

 Luckily I got chance to enter Roxy along with another group and spent my time there.

[Don't dishearten by the poor rating, I will take further feedback from my Friends in Kolkatta keep writing reviews about You(Once in a Month)]

This is a well-known clubbing hotspot in posh Park Street. Ambiance and decor is pretty normal and average, nothing impressive. Apart from the super deluxe Scotch Ballantines and finger food - chicken sausage - which we'd had and perhaps the name 'tantra,' honestly I wasn't that impressed. Ambiance lacked groovy vibe and classy feel.

Add to that free drinks( which, unfortunately are served to you in a much diluted form..except for the good ol' beer)!! We ordered potato wedges with garlic mayonnaise and a non veg tandoori platter to complement our drinks. The non veg platter was quite a tasty preparation..and had chicken ,fish and lamb chops. The food,of course is overpriced but all in all, not a bad place for partying with your friends!!

Called the team to enquire about a few things before visiting, and the first thing the lady on the other side said (even though I did not ask for it) was that Stags were not allowed. To top it up, she was rude.
After the visit I'm sure that these people have an element related to 'Rudeness' in their people policy and training guidelines.
Highly overpriced. Slightly worth.

Not only is this place a great stress buster but it also has given me lots of good memories to look back on. The staffs as well as the manager are both helpful, kind and ready to answer any queries or doubts, which is expected of a high end place like The Park. Great service, awesome music.

The dance floor here reminds me of school/ college auditorium where crowd sits at one end and you dance in other end. Generally dance floor is centrally located inside any disc. Anyway in my two of visit, one last week was not very impressed. Crowd is decent owing to being in Park Hotel. Music is good. Food is ok and pricey. Would not recommend if you very choosy and particular. Can give it a miss then. Else fine and ok place to hang out. Nothing exceptional.

Visited this place last Saturday, Music was pathetic and so was the ambiance. It does not seem to be a club in any way when you get inside. The place needs renovation.Apart from the drinks the entry fee is too expensive. AVOID THIS PLACE (highly recommended).

The place remains one of the vintage discs in Kolkata. But the whole place does not give the vibe anymore. The life inside the place has slowed down.

This one still is the preferred night club in Kolkata since past 10 years.
Located in the upscale Park street where i love to hang out.
Lately i have been liking the¬†mini betki fingers in starters and the Tantra mocktail.
They have a good collection of expensive wines in case that interests you.

A bit on the expensive side but well worth it.

Tantra has been Iconic in terms of everything,one of the oldest in the city and I started my partying scene from here only. The crowd has changed over the years but yes in recent times it has picked up again,with different themed nights taking centre stage,also quite few national and international acts keep coming down from time to time.¬†Servicewise the island bar is real good and the bar tenders are pretty good with their work alongside the staff is nice. The music depends on the nights its themed on thus you'll find a mix of it from time to time. Coming to the crowd it does have a nice crowd.

One of the decent clubs in the city not too...out loud of a club but certainly brings in some decent crowds on "girls night out"... I like the DJ for he makes good sync with Bolly and good english numbers...as far alcohol is concerned a bit overpriced for a club of this stature...otherwise its a decent club to go with your friends on a Friday night.

Please shun this over rated and probably the most dilapidated and worst maintained pub Kolkata ever has!!! It just runs of the fame it had gained earlier. Drinks are freaking expensive with nothing extra ordinary about it!! If you looking out for a place to chill,dance and have fun there are a lot many new pubs with new concepts opened up in the city rather than this shack!!!

The oldest nightclub or a ' disco ' in Kolkata or Calcutta as it was called then was ' Pink Elephant' at the Oberoi Grand.Then came Incognito at The Taj,The Anticlock at the HHI,The Equinox at The Peerless Inn,The Dublin at The ITC Sonar in that order.Then came the Big Ben,Venom and all the other stand alone clubs all over the city.

Tantra happened in 1999,midway between all the clubs I mentioned,and won Kolkata over.

It was bigger than all the other clubs,had DJs like Aqueel play here,had dancers dancing on the bar from Mumbai,had a special VIP section called the Bodhi Bar and changed the Kolkata party going scenario forever.

In their heyday,they had serpentine queues outside on Park Street and with some expert Bartenders whipped up some killer cocktails and commanded a loyal following.

But gradually,the regulars moved towards lounges,the new party goers moved towards more swish clubs like venom and the Park's own Roxy and a particular type of rowdy elements started frequenting Tantra and it lost its sheen.

Now it is a pale reflection of its former self.....almost sad and forlorn and on my visit I could not find a single reason to be here more than 10 minutes.Roxy seems a much better option.

I really wish the Paul sisters redesign the place,which they are adept at and maybe launch a Kolkata version of their very own 'Agni ' from Delhi.

Way too overpriced. I can get cheaper drinks in the heart of Mumbai. And the crowd was bad. Just a couple of good looking girls, but otherwise there were old men (uncles, grandfathers) shaking their booties. Music was good. The decor is strictly basic. Really don't know why they charge so much. May be because of the legacy. If you still wish, you may go to waste your money. Entry fee for guests who r not staying with the Park hotel (800 Rs) with no cover. So basically I paid 2000 Rs for one large peg of Old Monk!

Unlike most of the people here my first visit to Tantra was at a Sangeet function for my colleague. After the ceremony was done all hell broke loose and we were at the dance floor in a jiffy. It was quite an ambience. The food served by top chefs of the park were delicious, although dancing and drinking as we were had only a little attention to that. It is probably one of the oldest nightclub in Kolkata, and a must visit for any happy feet out there.
Attaching some unusual photos of Tantra seen like never before.

Tantra is probably the oldest pub in town which is inside the park hotel,park street... The place is quite big including two floors and dark and appropriate for night lovers ... Although the quality of services and the class of crowd have degraded in the recent past still talk of the town on most occasions ... Wednesday and Fridays are ladies night where they serve free alcohol to ladies till midnight and after 12am everything is charged ... Free entry to gals and 500 per couple is the entree free .. no cover charge... Everything inside is paid and too expensive ... Although the ambience is good and decent items in the food menu .... I love to relish snacks there ... Almost all the brands starting from a beer cane to teachers to blackdog to bloody merry available ... They also have made to order cocktails option... The bar have extremely good staffs and bar tenders ... Although the management is not up to the mark and at par with the other 5 Star properties ... The club remain opens till 4AM DURING party night's and the music is evergreen ... All time famous bollywood and Hollywood club mixes ... Dance floor is big and gives one enough place to move ... All and all good place for a night out !!

The floor space is somewhat small but as the gathering of crowd was not that much .
yes i visited this palce on 14th feb 2015 first time so the crowd was much and felt the space is less.but another time it was ok as there was less people.

Yes there should be money in pocket to visit this place as the drinks is too much costly.
So if you are a party boy or girl visit this place on some occasional day.

Went here once. The area is aptly decorated for a club. Dim lights and cozy. But the floor space is a little less and it tends to get really crowded. The bartenders know their mixes well. The couches are quite comfy. Located in Park street inside the park, it earns it's right to charge on the higher side. A place to be visited only if you're a party freak and have bug bucks to spare.

Tantra is one of the oldest night clubs in town. It's located inside The Park and is one of the most famous destinations for party hungry crowd. It's quite big and the ambiance is dark and appropriate for a club. The only thing is that it gets super crowded at times and the floor gets cramped with people. The prices are towards the higher side being it inside a 5 star hotel. It's a place, people should at least visit once for the sake of it.

Tantra, once upon a time, was the most happening nightclub in Kolkata. It was also one the first of its kind. During my middle school days, tantra was a cult place to be in. All the kids looked up to it. And if anyone had stories of their elder bro/sis going tantra, we would listen to it awestruck. Finally i visited tantra once in my high school. I really felt lucky then because i could enter a 'high-status' club being under age. I was really excited and truly enough tantra crowd seemed very elite back then. But those are all things of the past. Now i visit tantra only if my friends force me literally. To be honest, i started going to tantra from my college first year on a sort-of-regular-basis only on Wednesdays to avail the free-drinks-on-the-house-for-ladies offer. I stopped soon enough. The crowd is cheap beyond imagination. Almost all the males seem pervert, trying to grope girls on dance floor or hitting on them otherwise. If you enter tantra while its not crowded, you get the drinks quickly. Once it starts getting crowded, the bartenders serve only the faces they know. At times ignoring customers to flirt with them. The music has also gone down. Now they play a few trance and mostly, MOSTLY, honey singh numbers. No wonder the crowd that visit tantra now will prefer honey singh over edms, but still. Maximum girls drink till they actually drop. They they puke on the stairs or the washroom sink. Disgusting! I have even seen girls wearing shabby tees and jeans carrying a school bag inside tantra. I myself visited tantra first time during school, so i am not saying not to allow them. But i really think the authorities could do better if they could filter the crowd. Roxy has a better profile entry than tantra. Not really recommended unless guys are accompanying the girls. Cheerie!

A part of "The Park" hotel, situated in the heart of the city. This place is among the first of its kind opening in town and completely redefined the meaning of "fiesta" in Kolkata. "Tantra is "mecca" for the party animals in town. Lavishly decorated with touch of elegance at every nook and corner of the place, the lightings are smothering, spread over a vast area and offers one of the biggest dance floors in Kolkata. The sitting arrangements are proficiently organized and gives a perfect almost 360¬∞ view from any of those cozy couches. The "MUSIC" over here is sheer epic as always and the DJs out here knows how to drag you to the dance floor. The bar is superbly well stocked and offers the world's finest wines, scotches, sufficiently aged single malts, bourbons, tequillas, vodka(Roberto Kavalli), classic cocktails like mojito, cosmos etc; the bartenders are fabulously talented and inherits the perfect set of skills to deliver the cocktails/mocktails oozing with perfection. The crowds are mostly chique but sometimes it does get a bit lousy but the extravagant ambience completely makes everyone go overboard. Even though the city now has got a lot of clubs and discoth√®que but "Tantra" will always be the party "Mecca" to go gaga.

Won't remember of the pricing ofocurse for no1 remembers how many drinks you had however the staff was pretty rude with domestic as well as international guests while serving them. Late back attitude in taking counter orders.

Tantra and Shisha go hand in hand. The ambiance, the dance floor, the staff, the food, the spot, everything peak perfect. The Park is really onto something good. :)

Excellent ambiance with impeccable service quality, my one day visit to the City of Joy was made a memorable one when we visited Tantra.



EDM collection was pretty good. while the only grouse would be that the crowd was a bit off considering the place in itself is quite expensive.


Food is nothing to write home about while the cocktails were quite interesting

Tantra was the first disco in the city which went viral and Calcuttans learnt to party. Tantra taught Kolkata that party begins after midnight and that nightlife is cool with music, booze, dance and friends. As students we used to feel the pinch in our pockets back then but the ambiance and the music swept us off our feet. The cool DJs playing all sorts of trance music on the console made Calcuttans go crazy. off late with night clubs growing in the city like mushrooms the craze of Tantra has reduced but this place will always be special to my heart.

Tantra has been a hotspot on the city's party circuit for a long time situated in the center of the city's five star hotel The Park.
Last time i visited Tantra at Christmas eve almost year ago almost the music ambience was everything was good. But personally i didn't like the environment as much.. It felt like i have come over to some cheap nightclub. 
Its over priced and quality is not maintained properly. 
But i wouldn't mind visiting occasionally with my friends though it plays great music :-)

I have seen and met people from every city ! 

God knows why this place is soo shabby ! with horrifying and horrible crowd !

Tantra has just lost its Aura that was in our school days ! 

It should be shut down if that is what your are selling in Tantra !
Do something about the crowd people !

Frankly speaking, I thought it must be a super cool place to be when I was a teen. I thought the music must be too good and the DJs must be of international repute. Much to my dismay the place has no such thing. I think there was a dearth of places which is why couple of songs were shot here. This place is pathetic as you have to pay a fortune as cover charge and you don't even get covered for the entire amount. The drinks are way too much hyped and the crowd is pathetic. We saw people in sarees and even Kurtas and bachelors shabbily dressed and came to have some fun! If you know what I mean. I didn't expect this place to turn out this way. But for some reason people used to rate it high earlier but not now. I think the other two places of The Park, SPE and Roxy are quite good compared to Tantra. I had been to Tantra mostly when I had been sponsored. My experience is not that great out of 3-4 times i had visited this place for a Disco that is a part of such a big hotel.

During my childhood summer vacation trips to Kolkata, and later my college days in nearby Kharagpur, Tantra used to that aspirational hub where the supposedly cool and well heeled crowd would flock in droves. Well I couldn't wait to set foot in it, and years later I finally did a few weeks back.
 
In one word: completely underwhelmed (well that's 2 words). 

The place was cramped, the music was crap, the food and drinks were overpriced (which admittedly is not the point of the place). Who pays a fortune to listen to dubsteps of Honey Singh for crying out loud!! We left the venue in a jiffy and settled down at the nearby Someplace Else.

Now that was one helluva experience for a hard rock aficionado like me and have accordingly reviewed that there.

The Dance Floor should be large to dance comfort for single and couples. And the alcohole rate should not be much higher. The pole dancers, bartenders, bouncers are good. And musics are awesome. Must go last 31st night of a year.

Had a really good time at tantra. But also was a bit let down as  I had been expecting much much more from it. 
But being there with a bunch of close friends would surely make your time good and totally worth it!

Tantra at The Park is the place where I debuted at clubbing. There is only one place in Kolkata which has survived test of times. Musically and event wise no other place in Kolkata has managed to come up to the level Tantra has reached. This club has really defined EDM scene in Kolkata. Contrary to the fear psychology some people have about this place, Tantra is the most secure place. Music lovers, its your ultimate den!! Must try on a special night...the vibe is simply infectious!!

Tantra has been a hotspot on the city's party circuit for a long long time .... situated bang in the center of the city at The Park Hotel it was THE place to be seen at one point. Music has always been its strong point since they have always played great music there ....... service is prompt and the bartenders know their stuff for the most part. The crowd is not always to my liking though and there have been reported incidents of late. Its a good place to go with your friends and in a group occasionally.

I seriously don't know many people who go to Tantra for a great time. They don't. Tantra is overpriced, filled with douche-bags and has a smoking section upstairs that caters to the drunk crowd. Yes, it is exclusive, and unnecessarily overpriced for a stag entry.

Wednesdays are awesome for your female friends though.

Possibly one of the first places I went partying, Tantra is quite old, and I must say, a lot of bad publicity is associated with this place. However, on every occasion I have been there, I have had an average time. A revamp a while back has made this place more accessible and open, and nowadays, the bar has upped the notches by presenting mixed drinks which are quite tasty. I quite like their service, which is attentive, especially if you are at the bar. The music is strictly okay and I would like some more variety, I guess. Overall, okay.

Tantra is a good place for people who just wanna enjoy music and dance. If u are planning to go there with friends and have a good drink or if u plan to throw a party for ur friends it's a place u need to be really loaded with cash cause it ain't gonna be cheap. The drinks price are sky soaring high..

I am not hard core party guy. but what i experienced at  Tantra and assume  that, this is the hottest party destination in the city. 

Tantra's will be one of the oldest space, it has  been around for many years and has always been the place for the biggest, hottest parties the city has to offer. 

If you drop in  make sure you have some good freinds are with you , 

i will not comment anything on food, deccor, service . but the  ambience attracts you  The music is awesome ,  The drinks are very expensive though the entry fee is quite reasonable. Do take lots of money in your kitty if you plan to booze. But overall I assure you are gonna have an awesome and unforgettable experience.

Yo boy I love this place. I can surely say it is one of the Oldest and most popular disc of Kolkata. The very ambience attracts you and slowly you get addicted to this place. The music is awesome the lighting just perfect. But yes I feel the dance floor is not big enough. There are other discs in Kolkata with bigger dance floor. Its like you get almost crushed and cannot dance freely. The drinks are very expensive though the entry fee is quite reasonable. Do take lots of money in your kitty if you plan to booze. But overall I assure you are gonna have an awesome and unforgettable experience. 
So all you party lovers 'Tantra' is the place. Jump in as soon as you can.

The hottest party destination in the city. Tantra's been around for years and has always been the place for the biggest, hottest parties the city has to offer. If you drop in, you can easily expect to meet a celebrity or two, such is the following that Tantra enjoys.

The Bodhi Bar on the top floor is a place you have to check out, if you ever go there.
