This place is situated at Lake Terrace on the top floor of the Hotel Stay. Ambiance is loud and energetic and the place is medium sized which can seat around 20 people. Food quality is good and the hookah was also very soothing and light. The crowd however leaves a lot to be desired and though it would be morally wrong to regulate the crowd by the restaurant, it really does not do good to the ambiance and feel of the place. The place also does not gives bills or receipts for the food or hookah as according to then it saves on the GST!. So the final price can be adjusted with a bit of bargaining which is hilarious. Overall a pocket friendly place which can be a hit specially among the young student society.

This is a place you can visit if you are interested only in hookah.The food from this place isn't good enough.The ambience is below average.Especially the crowd so if you are going with family please don't go to this place.With friends it's okay.And the sofa and AC's they need some maintenance.

It is just on the lane beside the famous sweet shop jugals(যুগলস). It is on the fifth floor of the Hotel Stay. The lift takes you upto fourth floor only. Therafter you have to help yourself. The ground floor has a family restaurant which serves the same food as the hookah lounge. It also has rooms on the rest of the floors which also has offers for couples on hour basis. I used to go there during my college days that was on 2013 or 14. The hookah lounge has sofas and tools and you can buy cigarettes, red bull and cold drinks at higher price from there itself.
Flashback to 2013: It was a place we used to call our second home because it was a fun spending time there. That time the place used to be quite maintained. There were no extra false ceiling and enough light to see clearly, ac used to work properly even when it was crowded, the songs were good enough and not extremely loud and even the staffs were quite friendly and helpful, Gopal da, Bikash da, khurshid da, bunty da and sometimes the manager used to come there to have hookah and he was also friendly. Luckily i know him and still gets updated about the ongoing offers. Sometimes we used to pay the money all together at the end of the month since we were regular visitors. The foods were cheap and good in both quality and quantity according to the price.
Coming back to 2017: The lifts doesn't work most of the time. Climbing stair for 5 floors is not an easy thing when you are out to have fun and good food The place has become gloomy, dark even in the daytime. False ceilings with dark lights and extremely loud music. You can't hear to the person sitting next to you. Waiters are changing and the new ones have become less friendly. They won't co-operate with you for your orders. You will get the hookah or the food half an hour later. The ACs doesn't work properly and they have a stand fan which they have to turn towards different people turn by turn because it is very hot inside. The food has worsen in quality and prices are very high now. Students create nuisance and doesn't let anyone have fun. You definately can't enjoy your time here anymore.
They have opened another hookah parlour MANIAC beside Zeeshan which is more maintained now-a-days. They have pool and enough space also. And the food and hookah there is also better than Flames. Basically they have shifted their concentration more on Maniac.
The rating is based on both the condition of back then and now. Since we have spend a lovely time there for many days I just ignored the fact that it is a really horrible and cheap place now.

Located in the lane before tea trove in Desapriya..
The interiors are just too dark and dingy, so what if it is a Hookah bar 😐 and the music is so loud that you can barely hear what the person next to you is saying. 
I suggest, dont go for the food at all. We had chicken hakka noodles and honestly, even roadside kiosks make noodles of that sort at a lesser price. Hookah was decent. They also had Happy Hours then at 7pm so we had discount on the hookah.
The suggestion would be try visiting some other place if at all for Hookah, this place has nothing more.

Seriously....zomato is even keeping this plave in its list of restaurants..... a zomato nearby search took us there. A climb of 5 floors (lift not working) later we entered into a dingy badly lit smelly place. The seats were all tattered and torn.There was only one guy who was lying down on one of the tattered seats...apparently he seemed to be the waiter. The whole place was deserted even in a Saturday evening(no doubt). Whatever we asked was not on the menu and the guy was reluctant to serve anyway... PATHETIC.... am sorry that i there is nonway for me to rate it below 1.

Cheap hookah. That's all. 

People obviously visit this place for hookah. They have a hookah menu more varied than their food menu. The food, pasta in Alfredo sauce was good and so was the noodles, nothing worth mentioning however.
It's a dingy place with odd, loud music, too stuffy to breathe and too dimly lit to see anything. The seating isn't much comfortable, good thing they have some tattered cushions to share around. 

Basically, you climb 4 stories in stairs because lift doesn't work and as you reach the place all out I breath it welcomes you with a suffocating plume of hookah smoke. I didn't have a good time. 

I'm not going back, you may if you want cheap hookah and don't care about anything else. 👍

What is this place?! 
This place is difficult to find and if you end up finding it, it's a task climbing up those stairs (lift doesn't work). There's barely any light on in the cafe/ hookah parlor/borderline discotheque. Filled with College goers who seemed at ease with the place. The music was so loud that one could barely hear his/her own voice. Therefore no room for conversation. We were a group of 6 and it was a task fitting in the sofa they had provided. We had ordered hookah ( paan and brain freezer) which was decent but they took forever to provide us with one glass of water. One had to keep calling out to them. Bad experience. Not going back again.

I had been to this place with my friends for hookah. This joint is divided very nicely so that there won't be any irritation or suffocation whatsoever for the family men. The crispy chilli babycorn here is good and also the cantonese fried rice. The hookah was average. The ambience is like that of a disc and so is the lighting of the place. And regulars treat it like their second home. But the service is very bad.

I have been to this place twice....once with my friends and once with my cousins. If you are a stickler for ambience  or looking for a nice romantic place I suggest you give this place a miss. But if you are a student and a gang of friends/ cousins demand a hookah treat from you then this is the place for you. Servers are not many and are willing to customise the hookah the way you want. The hookah served is quite satisfactory. They have nice combos on offer too. The first time I went , we had 2 chicken noodles-chilly chicken combos and 2 hookah. Bill was around Rs 550. The next time we went, we had 1 hookah and a kebab platter combo and the cheque was rs 600. So you can very well guess the pocket friendliness this place offers.
              Ambience,  service, infra wise , this place needs to improve a lot. Their air conditioning as well as air passage is a little down which sometimes becomes suffocating. Otherwise for a combo of gossip , hookah and good munch ons minus ambience.....this place is satisfactory.

Not really a place to dine in lavishly. No as such staff present there. Anyone can change the music according to their will. It's much of a place to have adda with friends. Too gloomy and interiors need to be furnished. Only thing available is Hookah. They serve you selected food on top of that. Needs a hell lot of development.

Their hookah is well made. Their flavors are limited. I haven't tried their food ever. 

One major disappointment about this place is the ambiance. Hookah parlors generally have a very cozy ambiance. This is just one big hall with tables along the sides. I can literally hear what the group opposite to me is talking about and there is absolutely no privacy. 

Honestly speaking, although the hookah was good, I will give this place a bad rating because of it's ambiance. And I will definitely think twice before visiting this place again.

A decent place for Hookah. But there's no food available due to kitchen re modelling (according to the person in charge). They should mention this on the website because I was slightly mislead as I went there to grab a bite as well.

This place doesn't offer half the food in the menu, nor does it offer any combo. The hooka however is good. No WiFi either.

Hookah was good.
Food tasted good but we were made to wait for ages before our order arrived.
There was only one waiter when we visited the place and so it was ovious that we had to wait for food even much longer.
The blue lagoon mocktail tasted lyk kerosin n it was very pukish.
2.5 stars because the food tasted good

Hookah here is decent and food turned out better than expected.
Wouldn't mind another visit to this place just to eat. I was expecting bad food from this place, but turns out it was quite nice. Although they could introduce a larger variety of dishes. Service is nice but quite slow.

Flames -   A well and good family restaurant and a A awesome hookah bar.. 
The food tastes great. The ambience is awesome with all those dim lights and LED bulbs.. 
The seating arrangements are quite comfortable.. The staff is friendly and attentive.. Some times they delay. But its okay when they serve you good quality.. 
The hookah is great and cheap. And so its always crowded.. 
An awesome place to hang with friends. 
:)

TOO MANY PROBLEMS.
1) Staff is RUDE. The few waiters there feel they run the place so they couldn't be least bothered to help you or make anything convenient for you. I went with a Groupon coupon. Before arriving, I made a reservation through the phone and mentioned I didn't have a printout, only the email on my phone. They said it was fine and there would be no problems. Upon arrival, they said I required a printout. When I said they didn't mention this to me on the phone, they accused me of either lying or calling up a wrong number. They refused to connect me to their manager on the phone for a good 10 minutes and when they finally did, he stole the cake. He was insanely rude and abusive. He threatened, abused, and put me down the whole conversation. They refused to give me good customer service or make anything easy on me. 
2) Music is blaring throughout. Terrible music, I must add.
3) I went at night and the place was dark. It was poorly lit. I don't know if that was the effect they were going for, but it didn't work.
4) The crowd was rowdy, cheap looking, and obnoxiously loud as well.
5) The place is on the 4th or 5th floor. Lift does not work. They expect you to walk up and down the stairs, which can be quite unpleasant if done in heels.

OVERALL: Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad experience. I would never suggest anyone ever go there. The staff should be fired. The manager should learn how to treat customers and speak with decency to women.

Flames, situated at Deshapriya Park, boasts of two sections :- A multi cuisine family restaurant and a hookah bar. The family restaurant showcases a very mediocre ambience, slow staff, compact menu and moderate pricing. The food at the family restaurant is good. The hookah bar gives a very vibrant feel and is always brimming with teenagers, due to its cheap pricing.  Service is good at the hookah bar as the staff is very friendly and attentive. The food is great at the hookah bar and so is the ambience. Flames, the hookah bar is delightful and alluring, but the same cannot be said about the multi cuisine family restaurant !!!

Please keep in mind that this place has two very different sides to it::

1:: The family section where the dining is very reasonable when it comes to the pricing of the menu & the quantity of the dishes served out. The quality is mediocre but the quantity makes up for it. Food comprising of the chinese segment is the saving grace ,please don't experiment,stick to the basic only. This segment totally caters to the couples of the ones who come to dine with family. But keep in mind don't expect very high standards  but be rest assured if you're light on your pocket & have a crazy hunger to quench then surely this is the place

2: The hookah zone is a zone I would advice couples or people with family to strictly avoid as the section is always filled with teens & school kids. Thus there's too much noise for non-regulars to have a meal in peace. Also most of the dishes from the menu aren't available. Orders take much longer than usual  to be served as they are delivered from the restaurant kitchen, thus for dining or eating out the family section is always a better option.

Also note the regular hookah holics here rule the music that gets played here, so your quiet meals can be disturbed by some random track that can be a pain to your ears and the staff there will not be able to assist you as well. The lift will only take your to the fourth floor beyond which you will have to help yourself so people with weak knees please avoid. Also the smoking zone is right at the entrance of the hookah zone so for non-smokers before you even enter your nostrils will have a hard time.

The adda spot of our band (The Accidental Note). Hookah is nice and not heavy on the pocket. Never did I order food so I've got no idea on that. 
1)The crowd is awesome and really friendly
2)You have the option of playing games on the ps3.
3)Your experience will be memorable
And on some lucky days you may even see our band rehearsing and playing there... :)
Overall a must visit.
See you there. :D

Nice place for dining in. Ambiance and quantity was too good. The behavior of the staff was too good. I loved their Chinese fare a lot. Szechuan noodles and cantonese fried rice are worth a try. I loved the style of dividing the restaurant and hookah parlor. For family men, the silent cosy lit ambiance is great. A good place for dining.

Went here yesterday with friends. A good place for hangout. Hookah was good and so was the food. Took Crispy Chilly baby Corn and Cheese Omelet. Both were good. I had a voucher from Snapdeal so I got a discount of 40% on the bill amount (Food and Beverages) and hookah was available was 99 bucks. The only drawback was that the number of waiters were less. Only two of them were working and delivery was a little late as well. But overall the experience was good!!

-extremely confusing to locate
-ground floor has restro which is atleast better.
-4th floor for hookah,lift for 4,doesnot work most of the time.
-half of the food menu is unavailable.
-a single waiter,not intrested to take orders.
-u have to wait almost 45mins for hookah.
-have to wait almost an hour or more for food.we had chicken cheese club sandwich and conjee crispy chicken.tasted good.
- the most horrible mocktails i had here
-the hookah bar is more like terrace,scorching heat of sun directly gets inside the glass wall,a.c sucks.. simulates THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT ;)
-the crowd consist of school students..busy chattering and they control the music player.
-staffs are not even interested to improve everything.

 my recommendation- DONT GO :-)

The smoothies are really well made and the hookah is mediocre.
Cant say anything about the food as we were just hanging out at the place so did not order any.
The waiter is pleasant and very understanding.
The only disadvantage is the seating arrangement. No partition for those who are having hookah, so you will be having it with everyone else in the restaurant. The lights are well done but the seat-table arrangement are very low for you, so being seated comfortably and enjoying the hookah might be a bit tricky.

Very poor service in the hookah section. Was made to wait over half an hour for an order of a coke and a mocktail. Mocktail tasted ordinary. Limited options of hookah flavors. Not planning to come back anytime soon.

Surprised to see none of the hookah lovers have reviewed yet. I can only judge the family section and it is very good. The dimly lit cosy ambience is perfect. I loved their Chinese fare a lot. Crispy chilli baby corn and sweet corn soup were very good. Their Szechuan noodles and cantonese fried rice are also worth a try. A good place for dining after shopping at Gariahat.
