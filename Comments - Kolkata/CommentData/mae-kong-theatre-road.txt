As I walked in to this newly opened asian restaurant at Kenilworth hotel I was honestly surprised to see that it’s a vegetarian only restaurant.
The ambiance was lovely and it had a good menu with lots of options to choose from. The chili asparagus dumpling was soft and spicy. Noodle wrapped paneer nuggets were crispy and delicious. However the honey chilli lotus stem was a complete disappointment. The chips were soggy and tasteless.
In the main course we enjoyed a fragrant thai green curry.  This was the best part of the meal. Taste and consistency of the curry was spot on. Pad thai was good to taste but didn’t come with peanuts and lemon wedges on the side. The rice bowl was above average.
Have to say service was slow and we had to ask for our main course to be served twice.
Overall the place makes for a good dinner option for vegetarians.
