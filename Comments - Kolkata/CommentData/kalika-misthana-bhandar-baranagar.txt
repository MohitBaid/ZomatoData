Kalika Misthana Bhandar is an old sweet shop at Baranagar.

Ambience is tidy.

Staffs are nice with quick service.

Tried Rabri, Malai Chop & Singaara. All tasted pretty decent & fresh. Caters well to the needs of local people pretty well.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

My local Misti shop. Buying sweets from there for more than 30 yrs. Quality of sweets are still very good and having a long range of variety.
