I had tasted bamboo chkn previously in aaraku.. then went to santas fantasea for tasting their version of bansa pora chkn and mutton.. trust me .. both of them were delicious.. and quantity was also good.. we had wild red rice from mizoram with it.. and the combination was heavenly.. we went a step forward and ordered smoked octopus.. it was creepy looking but worth it.. the decor is good giving a tribal and sea food theme.. the staffs were very good and they actually suggested the foods.. i would definitely visit again for the bans pora :)

One of the most awaited places I wanted to dine in. A place with great tribal ambience. Each and every item on the menu is unique. Tribal food, seafood etc. Loved the dishes. Everyone should visit it atleast once. Food is awesome and the rates are reasonable. Do visit and enjoy the food.

It's an easily affordable destination for sea food lovers! It's tribal decorations & ambiance is perfect for a different dine out! You'll have to utter WOW after tasting their popular dish of BAANS PORA CHICKEN/ MUTTON! Food explorers must try any dish of Octopus or Squid!

If you love sea food then this is a perfect restaurant for you. Quality of the food was great & Quantity was good under reasonable price. Seating could have been better. Though i didn't like that much their special menu Bansh Pora Chicken. Malaysian rice was amazing & prawn item was also superb. Loved the decoration of the place.

Did not live up to the standards I was expecting.First of all the staff are not at all friendly and helpful. It seemed as if we have caused them some kind of inconvenience. They did not allow us to sit at a table we preferred, they did not have the means to accept payment by cards and they weren't attentive at all.The food was okay. The sea food salad was a disaster. The only food I was able to eat was their bamboo mutton but I must say I have tasted better.¬†A total disappointment.

Firstly the name of the restaurant triggered the curiosity to visit there once. We (me with my parents) had a combined dinner of tribal cuisine & seafood. Bansh pora mutton,soru chakli & wild red rice were good. 
But I actually loved their seafood items.
Seafood soup with shredded sea fish,pwarn & squid was a big WoW. Shanghai octopus was amazing too. I tried octopus & squid for the first time. It was a great experience. Planning my next visit with friends.

I was very disappointed with Santa's Fantasea, Golpark. We had ordered three dishes- the Octopus, the butter garlic squid and pepper baby corn. The octopus was chewy, rubbery and basically uncooked. It was served on a bed of oily slimy looking gravy even though the menu card said it would be served with three different types of sauces. On being asked, the steward kept on insisting that they do not serve it with sauce. It tasted so awful that we did not eat this dish. The squid was served chinese style i.e crispy fried and doused in a chinese type soya-chilli-tomato sauce. They were better than the octopus but still quite pathetic. There was so much cornflour on them that they had become stiff and hard. No taste at all. Last but least came the pepper babycorn- the only veg dish in their menu. This smelt strongly of fish oil and tasted bland. ¬†For the prices, the food is quite awful. Even worse was the service. The steward kept on insisting that this food was what everyone loved.He had a take it or leave it attitude, not even a hint of a smile on his face and certainly no regret or apology for serving undercooked or bad food. Overall this is not an experience that I would recommend to anybody looking for a nice seafood meal.

It was a great experience for me, my family and my colleagues, my selection didn't went wrong choosing you guys. Going out of the box trying something different was absolutely treating my tummy in a nice way. First I would like to appreciate both of your outlet Golpark and saltlake. Secondly I got appreciation from my colleagues when I suggested to get food delivered from your Saltlake outlet for team lunch, and also your food made my parents special day to an outstanding day. We have tried Banspora Chicken which gives an immense flavor of marinated chicken with Indian Spices and the burnt bamboo flavor. The WILD RED RICE was something which I would like to have again and again. Apart from this the other dishes like,Sea food lung fung soup, Seafood Malayasian Noodles, Teriyaki Chicken, Dragon Pepper Chicken all are recommendable.

Today I went with my family for having lunch at this place and it was a complete delight. 
Decor- They have tried to give a tribal touch  to the place which goes nice with the kind of theme they have kept in mind and the type of foods they offer.. Though I found the bamboo chairs a bit uncomfortable.. 
Ambience- It was good but since I went today so it was crowdy.. The place is not that spacious. 
Service- prompt and satisfactory. 
Food-  We ordered  Shanghai  Squid which was yum and crispy.. Seafood salad would be a favorite  for people who love meyo and cheese..This combined with the seafishes was absolute delight. We ended it with the famous Bansh Pora Mutton paired up with Soru Chakli, which was an awesome delight given the taste and smell  of it with very low oil. 
Overall a nice experience and value for money spent

The place offers a very warm, homely at the same time an exotic tribal experience with decent interior and mouth watering tribal and sea foods. Though some soft music at the backgroud could add a little more soothness in the ambience which was severely missed. The service was also very impressive. 

P.S : I'll be very glad if the management satisfy a little curiosity of mine. How is the name connected to the theme of the restaurant? To be more precise, how can santa ever fantacize about banshpora mutton ?

Finally visited this tribal & seefood restaurant situated near golpark. The decor is at par with the theme and the staff was courteous and service prompt. Coming to food we ordered the famous 'bansa pora mutton', Julu pithe, prawn momo, jadoh rice and neemcheem kheer. The kheer was made with shredded prawn and it was surprisingly wow. The quality and taste of food lived up to my expectations and well I can say I will definitely come back for seafood and other tribal food experience.

We had a kheer for dessert which was made from prawns. It tastes beautiful. Hoping to go there again to taste other unique dishes.  Highly recommended. The staff was very friendly.

I was looking forward to visit this place for a while. Was little bit curious to taste the bansh pora stuff.. 
So when I was at this restaurant my 1st choice of starter was obviously bansh pora chicken(not the mutton cause one of my friend doesn't eat mutton).. I was much disappointed with that..Cause the dish wasn't hot when it was served.. It didn't taste that good also..But the other dishes were very tasty..(The red rice n smoked fish)..The khir with prawn pieces was one of the best dessert in the town ..I totally loved it..
Table service was quick.. the ambiance is one of its kind.. Overall good experience..Want to visit it again..

First things first, their Welcome drink. That was so delicious that I ordered two! (it was a date during durga puja) .¬†

Bansh pora mutton was , at first sight and smell, heavenly. we struggled to find out which side to open the baansh from (it was a bit funny) , the waiter was more than generous to help unwrap and serve the same. Very smokey¬† in flavour¬† and the mutton was very tender . A bit spicy , but really well cooked.¬†

Burnt Chilli Octopus was fresh and nicely made.¬†

The overall ambience was pretty , liked the tribal layout of the inside room . The outer room I didn't like so much.¬†

Over in all, it was a great experience to get to try something new.

On a rainy weekday when hunger overtook our brains, we, a family of 3 and my aunt headed to this little outlet, located quite conveniently. We were greeted quite warmly and served Tankha Turani as complimentary drinks (I think). It's been a while so I don't remember all the names, but here's what I remember... Butter Garlic Squid, which was wonderful. Then we had Shoru Chakli and two servings of Bansa Pora Mutton... which was AMAZING!!! Absolutely melt-in-the-mouth and succulent.¬†
I'd like to visit again, and hopefully arm myself with more excellent food memories. Sorry about the lack of pictures, this was about a year back :(¬†

Anyway, great food, good service, value for money, easy location. Hope to go back!

After hearing a lot about its theme and food, I finally ended up planning a dinner with my friends at this place. Special mention, "my friends" were from Pune and Hyderabad, hence their taste buds are not so similar like Kolkatans.¬†
Service was good. Time taken too was okay. We had tried a wide range of dishes. Starting with crab momos- the momos were indeed hot and great, sadly "without" any crab, only giving a fishy smell.
The wild rice was referred by the waiter- it wasnt upto the mark, and we had to leave it half-way.
Seafood Noodles- were indeed good¬†
Pomfret dish was well cooked with an awesome spicy gravy, which we had mentioned,
Finally, the much awaited "bansh pora chicken"- the smoky flavour was a bang on, and we all relished the taste!
But, I had also taken a parcel of Bansh pora mutton which costed me 441 bucks, which was half filled up with the burnt dough to cover the bamboo and less than half of mutton.. which was a total waste! So, its advisable to check the parcels before carrying back home!

The place is well decorated..Specially the wall paintings are properly painted with the theme..And the sitting arrangement is good enough..¬†
Now coming to the food,we started with..
1. WINE CHILLY HORSE MACKEREL :
Two medium size of horse mackerel tossed with wine and sauces..This item is good..We took this as a starter but it can also be taken as a side dish..So this is 3.5/5
2. JADOH :
This is the rice item...Red rice with small mutton pieces and mint leaves..Rice was not properly cooked... its enough for two..It disappointed me..So this is 2/5
3. JHUPU PISI'S MUTTON DELICACY :
We took this as a side dish..four medium size mutton pieces with medium thick gravy....the mutton are properly cooked and its medium spicy..the taste is good..So this is 4/5
The staffs are well behaved..

One of the most unique restaurants in entire Kolkata, Santa's Fantasea has quite an impressive catalogue of sea food and tribal food items to choose from.

The decor is unprecedented and the staffs fine.

Availability of food items is almost never a problem here and they are fairly consistent as far as their food standard is concerned.

Choose your food with much thought and after much consideration as there are so many things on the menu that simply might not suit your taste but there are also some of them which might pamper your taste buds with never-been-tasted-before deliciousness!

Their mutton, fish and Malaysian preparations are generally better and they almost never serve stale sea food.

Voted by Zomato as the "best restaurant for seafood: 2015", Santa's Fantasea is a place that can lift your mood and satiate your hunger with their lip smacking  arsenal; however, they can bring further variations in their menu in the coming years, and a bit more consistency shall be quite appreciated by customers like me.

The visit to this place was pending for a long time. A huge amount of persuasion from girlfriend paved way for my decision to give this place a visit. We just reached in time before they close down for their mid-day siesta (from 4- 6 pm), and viola ! We were in for a treat and feast ! Since we entered just before 4, we practically didn't have any time to choose the food from the menu. We had to do away with experiencing new dishes and ordered the regular ones. Jadoh rice, bansh pora chicken and soruchakli. The service was prompt. Within minutes the room was filled with the heavy aroma of bansh pora chicken ! Tasty as it was with the smell of burnt bamboo well incorporated. Jadoh rice was subtlety spicy to tickle the taste buds. Soruchakli fitted the rest seamlessly. 
The best thing of the afternoon was saved for the last ! It's not everyday the restaurant manager comes out to serve you and ask you politely if the food was well cooked ! Now , this is amazing hospitality from the restaurant. Overwhelmed ! Literally. The waiters even waited when we wanted to take some snaps ! Definitely a must go restaurant for all !

This place is famous for seafood but we arrived here to try their very underrated Tribal foods.. we have the best experience of here from staffs behaviour to service to decoration everything top notch..

Come to foods we ordered

1. Wild Red Rice (Mizoram) - This is a veg spicy rice dish which have a very bright taste and it tastes really good.

2. Bansh Pora Chicken - Well as it named it is a smoky dish of chicken comes in a piece of bamboo, Smokey spicy chicken dish. This is the show stealer.

3. Kori Gassi - Another chicken dish almost similar to manchurian in medium spice with coriender and a different tribal taste. This dish is also good.

All over I will be visiting again for those tribal dishes only.

I think this is one of the best seafood restaurant in allover kolkata.I found the best combination of Bansa pora mutton with soru chakli & seafood rice with schezwan pepper octopus.These two are just awesome. I also took wild red rice & kori gassi which was good but not the best. Just one reason for which I'm not giving it 5 star is its ambience, the only field in which Santa's fantasea should develop more to grab more people.Overall It made my day.

Seafood at its best. This is by far one of the best seafood joints in the city. It was fresh, well cooked and sure to bring you back for more. The Shanghai squid was delicious ,so was the chilli octopus. So tender, it was brilliant. And I guess nothing more needs to be said regarding their baanshpora mutton. 
It was a truely delightful lunch

These guys happen to be the adventurous kind.. Imagine deciding to stand out in a crowd of restaurants serving the same fare.. Serving tribal food to the hard core food lover requires a lot of bravado..
The eatery may look small but it has made best use of its space.. The guy who took our order was very helpful in suggesting that we try their signature dish the baansh pora mutton with soru chakli.. We went ahead with it.. I loved the mutton with that lingering hint of smokey aroma.. The soru chakli went perfectly with it.. It was made with minimal oil n hence i loved it evn more.. Then we ordered the malasian sea food rice.. Lightly flavoured with chunks of squid and prawns....yumm.. But i didnt much like the cracked leaves chicken.. It was too sweet for my palate..
Would love to try their other tribal dishes fr the heck of adventure food and for the unconventional taste..

Before I start, I want to let the readers know that I'm someone who cannot tolerate spicy food. 
This place comes with a really nice decor, specially with those chairs. If you're a fan of breads, try the Soru Chakli, which goes with almost any side dish. The Jadoh they serve is of substantial quantity and it contains a lot of strips of mutton. Since I am not into spicy food, the Shanghai Squid was my only option and it did not disappoint, can be had as a starter too. And the seafood topping noodles are one of the best dishes served there; that's what I felt. The noodles are fresh and baked well, the topping is even more amazing. All in all, it is a really good place to grab lunch with your loved ones.

I visited the place for 5th time but giving the review now because I tried octopus this time. Each and every time I ordered only bansh pora mutton and wild red rice but this time with brave heart i tried octopus. The gravy was tasty no doubt but the octopus taste like rubber, not so good. Their signature dish that means the bansh pora mutton and wild rice as usual taste really good and unique. The decoration the service all are very good.

I had visited this place on 3rd December with some of my friends & had a horrible experience.¬† Firstly, the waiters¬† didn't know how to take orders in a precise manner. They served an extra dish which we didn't even order. Secondly, among the four dishes that we ordered, Crispy Fried Prawn was very bland. Bansa Pora Chicken, Crab Momo & Smoked Octopus was still palatable. Thirdly, when we wanted to split and pay the bill using our cards but the waiter didn't accept¬† it & didn't furnish proper reasons that why they can't accept it.

The ambience is great. You can get the vibe and feel the difference when you enter the restaurant. Tribal paintings and wall hangings here and there. And the usage of bamboo.
Coming to the food. The restaurant offers a wide range of variety, both for tribal food as well as seafood. The items cooked inside the bamboo ate to die for. The squid is perfectly cooked. And the chicken is tender. The experience was great!

For the second or third time I had the Butter Garlic Fish and it is a delight. This is a place that knows how to cook its seafood right, though the squid can be a little too rubbery sometimes. The place is affordable and a welcome change from the monotonous Chinese at every corner of the city.

Not that much good as expected and read from reviews. Seafood is good here but tribal cuisine is not upto the mark. Ordered soru chakli,bashpora chicken,  seafood malaysian noodles,1 shanghai squid, 2 plate crab momo,onion kheer. Tribal food is not good. Bamboo chicken is over hyped. Noodles and kheer is delicious. For a family dinner/lunch this restaurant is recommended.

A journey to the tribal cuisine...
Heard of this restaurant from my friends over facebook page for quite a long time. On the eve of our wedding anniversary we decided to give it a try...And believe me the best anniversary lunch we had in last 6 years.
 We ordered banshpora chicken, jado rice, jhupu pisi's mutton and soru chakli....Let me rate each and every item for you...
Banshpora chicken-4.75/5

Jado rice- 6/5 ....Yes you read it right...6 out of 5...Being a rice lover extra marks for the aroma..

Jhupu pisi's mutton- sorry I can't rate it...But i just couldn't resist myself from using my hand and I am telling you.. the mutton is so tender that even a person with slight dental problem can eat them ...

Soru chakli-4...1 point deducted because in front of other items I can't give it 5...
So a very delightful experience...Already planning to visit next month 4 their seafood delicacies..

Lovely food and easy to reach though it is in an alley between golpark and dhakuria. I went there thinking it as fusion fantasea but I was not at all disappointed. The staffs were very friendly and we loved the ambience. We had bansa pora chicken which had the perfect flavour of bamboo and the charcoal. We had sea food canton noodles, singapore noodles & wild rice along with smoked crab and prawn.

A great place to be for a foodie to be in. Looking for a change of taste, landed on the place after some preliminary search in the internet. I went there for a Sunday afternoon lunch with family of 5 including myself. At the onset, the place was bit confusing to locate as there is not much of pomp and show at the entrance. Located almost near the main Golpark Road (in the lane of Anjali Jewellers), the place had a nice and comfortable ambiance once entered. The place is well lit and is well maintained. The chairs and table were made of bamboo. Nice and stable to sit on.
Coming straight to the food, we ordered:
1. Prawn Momo(Steamed): 4/5 (though went to have the crab momo, but had to settle for the prawn. Nevertheless a good one though)
2. Bansa Pora Mutton - 4.5/5
3. Burnt Chilly Octopus: 4.5/5- (Only if you are willing to taste something beyond the usual)
4. Jhupu Pisi Mutton: 4/5
5. Seafood Beijing Rice: 3.5/5
6. Jadoh: 4.5/5
7. Ngatok : 3/5 (This is more like paturi with some amount of fry. The fillet used is Bombay Vetki)
8. Tilhou Kheer: 4.5/5
9. Chemmen Kheer: 4.5/5

Service could have been a bit faster. But being a full house Sunday, it was acceptable. The people were courteous and polite. Recommended for a family lunch out for foodies and definitely worth a revisit. Overall 4.5/5.

The place is very small but cozy. The decoration takes you on a tour to the tribals. We took two of each dish and the three of us couldn't complete them, meaning the quantity ¬†they provide is more than substantial. The Bamboo Shoot Chicken and Chilli Octopu were absolutely gorgeous. Green Seafood Rice is one of the best fried rices you'll find in Kolkata. However the Fish in Teriyaki sauce was stale and bad. I would visit this place again, but with a slight apprehension.

We went to this place on a weekend. This place has gained much good reviews given it offers proper tribal cuisine.Have heard a lot about this place so went ahead to have dinner over there. The interiors have been done around tribal arts. Beautiful tribal arts adorns the walls and the wooden furniture matches up to the theme well.The ambiance keep up to its delicacy it serves. We ordered chicken lungfung soup,soru chakli(tasted beyond my expectations), chicken in aromatic herbs, seafood malaysian noodles and last but not the least spicy octupus cooked in rich spices. All of them had a uniqueness of its own. To me, the soup was below average. And yeah! thumbsup for the soft , perfectly cooked soru chaki.Gonna visit againüëç

We took the famous Bashpora mutton. It was the highlight of the menu. Perfectly cooked, smoky, melting in your mouth. 
We took Soru chakli to keep the taste of the mutton intact.
We tried the Malaysian rice which was tasty and of decent quantity. 
Oyster chili squid was nicely cooked and the gravy was yummy.

Kerala Mutton soup: 5/5
Tastes perfect.The coconut milk can be tasted in it,the lemon(just the flavour,not much tang),bits of soft Mutton.One of the best soups I have ever had.
Amount in a bowl, enough for 2people with decent appetite and 3people with small appetite.

Black pepper mackerel : 3/5
Was not boneless.Was tasty.The gravy tasted better than the fish itself.
2pieces,one plate enough for 2.

Patra pora:3.5/5
Tasty,non spicy, mutton made in banana leaves.Reminds us of "paaturi" a bangal delicacy,but lacks the punch of flavour, albeit very soft.
Amount in one plate of this,is enough for 3,in small portions.

Shanghai squid:
2/5
tastes like crispy chilli squid.way too crispy,the squid gets lost in it.
Amount enough for 6,in very small portions.

Jadoh: 3/5
Decent portion for 3,in one plate. Delectable ,goes well with the tribal cuisine.Rustic.

Schezwan pepper octopus: 1/5
Not tasty.Chewy.Felt like eating flavoured rubber.amount enough for 3,small portions.

Jhupu pisis mutton: 4.5/5
A perfect mutton er jhol.The meat was extremely soft and it fell off the bone in such a way,one Wouldn't mind eating it with fork and spoon.
Amount good for one.

Chemmen kheer tilhou kheer: 3.5/5
The kheer in itself tasted good.One was onion kheer and another was prawn kheer.The kheer tasted the same in both.Did not receive the flavour of the onion and the prawn in the kheers.It just felt like some onions and some prawn bits ,put in the kheers respectively.

Verdict: Inconsistent.One of those who accompanied me exclaimed that what she tasted in the salt lake branch was way better than this one.
It's recommended if you love mutton.The mutton dishes were quite tasty here.

I visited this place once.. Firstly the food was amazing in tastes and ofcourse in good quantity. Bamboo chicken (bashpora chicken) is my personal favourite. Now coming to the ambience, restaurant is decorated  in coastal theme which is quite eye catching, cozy atmosphere ofcourse. Staffs are also courteous. Affordable price as per the quantity. Will surely visit this place again.

Nice ambience. Combination of tribal and underwater wall decor nicely describe the theme of the restuarant. We ordered
Bansa pora mutton, soru chakli, honey chilli prawn, malayasian sea food rice, smoked fish.
Signature dish is Bansa pora mutton but frankly it was not that great. I have far more better bansa pora in Araku valley and simply we started comparing with that.
The other dishes were simply superb. The tast was excellent and quantity was good.
The should add some cocktail/mocktail options and secondly they should train their waiters. We have asked them to serve in a particular order but they started in their own conveinent order.

This outlet is located inside the lane beside Anjali Jeweller's. The walls are nicely decorated, the outer one with the sea and the inner one with the tribal theme. The ambience is nothing to write home about. There was no music playing and owing to the strange acoustics and close proximity of the tables one can annoyingly overhear conversations from the neighbouring tables. 
Coming to the food, we started with the bansh pora chicken. It is a dry preparation with a unique smoky flavor. For me, this was the highlight of the meal. We had ordered julu pitha to go with the chicken, which in retrospect was a terrible mistake. It is a stuffed tribal bread, which was doughy and undercooked with no flavour of it's own.
For main course we ordered seafood Malaysian noodles and honey chilli squid. The honey chilly sauce was delicious but the cook on the squids was just wrong. I have never tasted more rubbery and chewy squid in my life. All the dishes were good in quantity. 
We wanted to finish off our lunch with a dessert or a drink. But they had nothing except cold drinks to offer. Considering their high rating on Zomato, I left feeling more than a little underwhelmed. A very average experience this was.

This is one such place which I prefer visiting often...located on the alley beside Anjali Jewellers golpark,is a bit difficult to lacate...but once u do i bet u simply cant get off with one visit...
Starting from the decor to its food everything is fabulous.... The bansh pora mutton is one of the most well cooked and tender mutton one can ever have.... I prefer having it with shoru chakli...
Coming to the main course we had malaysian seafood rice and chicken in oyster sauce...they were equally heavenly in taste....
So those who are looking for a good place to grab some sea food,this place is a must visit for them....
But being a small outlet this place remains crowded almost all the time...

The bansh-pora mutton was excellent as usual, but it is spicy and hot, not for people with a bland palate. Team it with generous helpings of shoru chakli. We liked the mildly flavoured Malaysian rice, the capsicums added to the freshness. Wish it had more pieces of fish. DO NOT MISS the onion dessert, a Manipuri speciality. Did not think much of the crab momos but the sticky tomato sauce was yummy!

It was such an amazing visit to Santa‚Äôs Fantasea. Randomly found this restaurant while going for the city excursion. Tribal Cuisine written on the board caught my attention and decided to come back in the area to have dinner.

Interior is pretty interesting. Tribe and Underwater wall paint with little low lights and wooden seating. We had Smoked Fish with Soru Chakli (roti prepared by dust of rice, maida and eggs). It was beyond my expectation. Never had such delicious Tribal food in the city. It was cheap as well. Service was excellent too! One of the waiter named Roysten told me about Bengali and Tribal food traditions in detail as well about unexplored places of Kolkata. (Extend my sincere thanks to him).

Come to know from local people that Santa‚Äôs Fantasea is one of the famous theme restaurant serving authentic Bengali and Tribal food. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to try other dishes but definitely coming back soon.

Overall, I had a great experience. I would highly recommended this restaurant to anyone who wants to try an authentic Tribal meal at cheap price.

People who love experimenting with food should definitely visit this restaurant once. The tribal cuisines along with chinese and seafood makes it a bit different from the other restaurants. 'Banspora chicken', a popular tribal dish, ain't that great as one thinks of, rather the chinese dishes are tastier. One can also try octopus, here. The ambience and decor goes hand in hand with their tribal flavour of their menu. Service is good with moderately priced items.

We ordered jadoh(rice), jhupu pisi's mutton, wine chilly tuna, mango sorbet. The mutton and the tuna were hands down delicious. But the rice was something else. I would suggest everyone to try it. Mango sorbet was a little icy. Otherwise great experience. Looking forward to visit again.

It was a sudden family plan out...and so Santa's fantasea was our first choice..as few days we were craving for seafood... So this was probably the best option for us all... 
We  ordered 1) bansa pora mutton: which was absolutely amazing, so tasty indeed out of our imagination... The flavours were so strong nd kinda hot that it just lightened up the mood..too much of spices and the mutton was so tender and juicy and the Smokey smell made it taste even better . 2) smoked fish: which was superb..  It WS a lil sweet and had a lil tangy flavour... It just so juicy so filled with the flavours that will leave u licking ur fingers again and again..  3) oyster chilli basil octopus: this was my first time trying out octopus.  Which was really amazing... It got that soft chew kind or feeling . so well boiled and yet so delicious.. 4) seafood Malaysian noodles: that was a coriander mixed noodles which was amazing... 5) seafood Beijing noodles : mixed WD squid and prawns and really tasty 6) shanghai crab: this was absolutely the winner dish.. The crab was sooo tender nd soft that u can break the skin nd eat the meat without struggling to break it WD ur teeth...it was amazing...
Overall the service was really good...the stuff members were really attentive and responsive at work... Really 5/5 restaurant.

What we ordered :

Seafood Cocolim(4.5/5) 
Shanghai Squid (3.5/5) : A little undercooked. Was a bit difficult to process.

If you are looking for unconventional and good food then this the place to be. However, hard luck for me as I am yet to taste their signature dish...Banshpora Mutton :-(
As we went to a day when the restaurant opened after three days of closure, they needed time to prepare Banshpora Mutton and we had to settle for Banshpora Chicken.
Let us come to the taste...
Banshpora Chicken...very good taste with nice aroma of the smoke....but the chicken could have been more tender (my personal choice though)
Jhupu Pisi's¬† Mutton Delicacy...this one I loved!!! The mutton is tender and the spices of the gravy was apt!
Jadoh...though it comes with mutton pieces, we had to settle with Chicken pieces, as they needed time to prepare the mutton. Taste wise...another delicacy! A perfect blend of spice and rice!
Smoked Squid...again another good dish but I do not know why..I could not feel the smoked part; on the contrary the amount of Garlic was more. When we enquired, they confirmed it was Smoked Squid. However, the taste bud were satisfied with the taste of the dish.
Seafood Malaysian noodles...it had fish, prawn and squid...and the suggested by the man. A good one indeed!

The rates of the food is reasonable and hence, you can pay a visit if you are kind of broke and still want good food....LOL!
The only issue with this place is their service, which was quite slow. As they were aware of the rush, one would expect better service by them.
A recommendation....Please add some drinks...fresh lime soda...at least!

This place like everyone else has been saying, is a gem. Not so difficult locate, placed cozily in a lane at Golpark, it looks small in the outside but has a rather pleasant ambience inside. It is a themed restaurant, concentrating on two main parts : 1) tribal cuisine of India and 2) seafood. They have the interiors themed accordingly, one space is fashioned as a blue ocean and another space have a chic tribal decor with wall painting and tribal masks.
The array of dishes of tribal cuisine they offer is rather fascinating and unique from banshpora mangsho, smoked mutton in bamboo shoot to jadoh, sticky rice and meat and prawn kheer, you'll find these nowhere apart from here.
We had gone there to taste their seafood dishes and they have one of the most varied seafood menus in the city. Talk of fishes to a Bengali, this felt like quite a paradise. From mackerel and tuna to crabs, squids and even baby octopus, this was our seafood dream come true.
We tried :
1) Smoked Octopus: Perfectly tenderised baby octopus in a sticky, spicy sauce with a really prominent smoky flavor. 4/5
2) Seafood Malayasian Rice: This dish gives me the sweet dreams with it's ultimate kick of lemon grass. It is beautifully fragrant and light and comes with a generous amount of squid rings, prawns and fish tossed in. This dish does show you that you can have a delightful bowl of fried rice without your regular additions of eggs and chicken. I can come back here over and over again just for their seafood rice. And I have! 5/5
3) Chicken in Oyster Sauce: Quice nice, a dark, sweet sticky sauce on succulent chicken pieces, went kinda well with the Malayasian rice. 4/5
4) Banshpora Mutton: This one definitely wins you over first with the theatrics, smoked mutton, brought to the table inside a flaming bamboo case. The taste thereafter, is another whole new experience. The best part I suppose is how they've used so much less spices to deliver such intense flavor. The meat is melt in the mouth soft and juicy with an amazing smoky flavor. This dish is aptly the most popular dish here. 4.5/5
We had looked for their crab dumplings but they were unavailable at the time. I'd sure go back to taste them along with more from their tribal cuisine.
Service is prompt and friendly, over all a very happy experience everytime I came here. 10/10 would recommend.

This dish does show you that you can have a delightful bowl of fried rice without your regular additions of eggs and chicken. I can come back here over and over again just for their seafood rice. And I have! 5/5
3) Chicken in Oyster Sauce: Quice nice, a dark, sweet sticky sauce on succulent chicken pieces, went kinda well with the Malayasian rice. 4/5
4) Banshpora Mutton: This one definitely wins you over first with the theatrics, smoked mutton, brought to the table inside a flaming bamboo case. The taste thereafter, is another whole new experience. The best part I suppose is how they've used so much less spices to deliver such intense flavor. The meat is melt in the mouth soft and juicy with an amazing smoky flavor. This dish is aptly the most popular dish here. 4.5/5
We had looked for their crab dumplings but they were unavailable at the time. I'd sure go back to taste them along with more from their tribal cuisine.
Service is prompt and friendly, over all a very happy experience everytime I came here. 10/10 would recommend.

it's a go to place for tribal food I must say...pujo came to an end with dinner at this place..and I must say I am really satisfied with the food..
bansh pora mutton and jadoh rice was pure love..ofcourse  for people who love spicy food it's a must try. we ordered smoked fish...wch was tasty but it did not justify the name...it had  gravy and and tasted like lemon fish...soru chakli was recommended by them but personally I did not like it..we also ordered jhupu pisi's mutton which was satisfactory ..one thing which I did not like is the service.

I love their seafood.  Though every one I have come across, those who are Santa's fan,  are typically in love with their tribal cuisine.. the famous Bash pora stuff and red rice. However,  I have become a fan of their seafood instead. I have tried their squid and octpus,  and I have become a die hard fan of the Sanghai Squid!  How crisp is the preparation and so well balanced sweetness with a tint of spice. I also tried the Smoked fish on my next visit to the restaurant, and again I was mesmerized with the lemony spicy dish. I will definitely recommend this restaurant for seafood fusion.

I simply love this restaurant. I have become a fan of tribal cuisine after visiting this place. The banshpora mutton is something one should definitely try once. The fried under various names served here comes with little pieces of squid and that is something one should try. The side dishes are various and very tasty. 
The service is very good. The crowd management quality of the staffs is noteworthy. I'm very sceptical however I rate this joint a straight 5.

If you are tired of eating tandoori chicken and chinese chopsuey then this is the place to go.
Everything they serve is one of a kind. Every item on the menu is new. 
They are known for their bass pora mutton,so we tried it. It was damn good and had that smokey flavor which I love. But I felt it was a bit too spicey and also felt the amount was a little less. Other than that it was just perfect. Next was wild red rice. From the looks it seems extremely spicey, but it just perfect. All the flavors were perfectly balanced and none too overpowering. The red rice was complemented well with kori gassi. Our waiter suggested it and it was perfect match. 8 juicy chicken pieces cooked in green gravy which had lemon grass, pudina and coriander paste. Finally we had malaysian noodles. It was loaded with prawn, squids and chicken. It was lovely.
My only disappointment is that they had ran out of octopus , so we couldn't try any of the octopus items.

I personally feel their menu offers a nice change to the typical ones that we often come across. This is where I had tribal food for the first time. On my last visit this Sunday I was a little disappointed. Firstly we had to wait for an hour because the restaurant was already full. It would have been better if the management could intimate us about the time in approximation so that we could go to some other place instead of counting on their 10 15minutes that they kept saying. They have extended their sitting space and included tables in the inside area as well. 
Food:
Baash pora mutton: this is a must have. You can see everyone ordering it. Their speciality which tastes awesome. (on the Spicer side)
Jadoh: nice in quantity and quality. A tribal rice again.
Jhumpu pishi's mutton: this was pretty average just that the mutton was extremely soft.
Smoked fish: this could have been named lemon fish. It was nothing like smoked fish as it had gravy and no smokey thing in terms of taste or smell. If I consider it without the name then the dish was nice. 
Shoru chakli: not going to have it again.
The staff was too busy to behave in any manner other than hurrying. Not very pleasant to communicate.

This was my first visit to this exotic place. Unfortunately during puja, they tend to cut short their menu card. The squid was tender and nice but we missed out on the octopus. I loved the banshpora Mutton and jadoh rice. The Beijing noodles wasn't that good..none of the food dishes were much spicy. I am looking forward for a second visit to try out their original exotic menu card..
N.B.avoid such exotic restaurants during durga puja. It was a disappointment.

The food was good but the Bansh Pora mutton is worth mentioning separately as it was one of the best that I have tasted. The Octopus in Burnt Garlic Sauce was an average dish but can surely be tried if you are looking to have Octopus.

However, for a place offering such good sea food expected more from the ambience to which I was disappointed slightly.

After planning for months,  we finally headed to their beautifully decorated small outlet at Golpark. Ordered for bansh pora chicken & smoked fish for starters. The staff were quick and helpful regarding choosing the dishes. Next we went on to order Jodah (red rice with mutton pieces), kori gassi (chicken cooked with coriander leaves), butter garlic prawn & seafood Malaysian rice. As a dessert we went for tilhou kheer which is nothing but finely shredded onion in kheer. All the items tasted different and the best among them was Jodah and the kheer. Looking forward to revisiting it in order to taste more of their dishes.

Kudos to the restaurant chain for maintaining authenticate taste for the items. Being previously eaten bansho pora mutton, auto chakli in Orissa, I can vouche, that yes it is authentic. The Mangalore's chicken was a bit down when compared to the other items(which were just amazing). One most pocket freindly yet praiseworthy enterprise. Total paisawasool.

Wow.. simply superb is what I can say the least..üòÄ
As my durga puja celebration continues and being a bong foodie any festival is incomplete without a tummy filling food.. so on the occasion of sosthi (26.09.2017) visited this place for a dinner.. We reached there may be at 8 pm and it was full.. The owner was chatting outside he saw us waiting outside and sweating heavily he ordered his waiter to arrange us in a table of 4.. that was really a nice gesture of him..

Location :- very easily locatable.. just take the lane beside anjali Jewellers golpark branch.. and just a few steps it stands tall on left.. 

Ambience :- The a.c was quite chilling.. The wooden tribal themed wall and furniture's...and the other room was seafood based.. Overall good ambience..

Food :- We started of with 
1) Bansh pora mutton :- wow.. It was heavenly.. The smell of smoky bamboo shoot was really too good.. The mutton pieces were tender soft juicy and the smoky smell of bamboo made it even better.. A must try over here.. don't miss it.. 

2) soru chakli:- a very very soft roti like item which goes really well with the bansh pora mutton.. 

3) wild red rice :- lipsmacking.. I can have this dish all alone.. without any accompaniment.. spicy.. Red.. tasty.. fantastic.. A bit oliy though.. (10/5) the quantity was enough for 2..

4) butter garlic octopus :- this dish was specially for my bae.. non spicy.. A buttery gravy over which 4 pieces of octopus floating over.. wow.. It was really tasty.. I tried Octopus for the first tym.. It was really tasty.. I am in love with it..

Service "- It was quick.. overall a prompt staff..

Our bill was 1204 Inc GST(18%)

The price has been increased may be for puja...

We had to wait a bit but the food was worth it.
We ordered Jadoh rice,bansh pora chicken and soru chakli.
The rice was awesome. The mutton pieces in it were perfectly juicy and soft. It's a bit spicy but I was fine with it. I would really recommend it. I would give it 5/5.
The chicken had smokey flavour and the spices had been well soaked up by the chicken  pieces. Somehow I didn't like that too much but tasted differ from person to person. It's 3.5/5 for me.
The soru chakli that we ordered with it was simple and nice.
The service was quite satisfactory despite of the crowd in that place. They have tried to give the interior a nice ethnic traditional tribal feel. 
Everything was worth it.

As the restaurant name says that it specialises in seafood, we ordered smoked squid, butter garlic octopus. Although the smoked squid was pretty delicious, the smokey flavour was expected to be bit more. The butter garlic octopus tasted good. 
From the "taste of tribal terraine" section in the menu, we ordered Bansa pora chicken, Jadoh and Wild red rice. The Bansa pora chicken was really delectable and also it smelt good. The wild and red rice was also pretty good but on a little spicier side. Moreover, the Jadoh also tasted good. 

A point which needs to be noted is that I went there in group of 5 people. A six-seater table was not allocated to us as we were 5 in number. But, after sometime, when a group of 5 people entered the restaurant; they were allowed to sit on the same six-seater we were looking at. I didn't understand why such misparity? The table that they alloted for us was not meant for 5 people and hence the table was small to keep the plates and other necessary cutleries. The service needs much improvement.

Ambience 4/5
Quality 4/5
Service 3/5

This is a good restaurant that specializes in seafood and tribal food. One of the best foods offered by the restaurant is bansa pora chicken/bansa pora mutton which is a tribal food that I know to have originated from the Jarwa tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Another famous dish that one can get here is jhupu pishir mutton delicacy. These mouthwatering delicacies are absolutely fantastic. The jadoh rice and red rice both are very good. Along with these one can get squid, octopus and many other kinds of seafood.
The ambience is not that bad. But I expected better behavior from the waiters otherwise the restaurant is good and affordable.

The smoky flavour of baansh pora mutton and a bite of soru chakli will make you lick your fingers. Jadoh is a must try coz itsss awesome... But mutton lovers.. I would seriously recommend jhupu pishi's mutton coz if you have not tried that yet...you are at a great greatt loss.... would love to visit Santa's Fantasea 100 times over..  Just a bit of space crunch makes it inconvenient for you to have a peaceful eat out there... but that becomes petty when it comes to taste...

I had been planning to visit this place for quite a while now and finally managed to go a few days ago. First of all, the decor is so pretty! The food is excellent, I must say. We ordered shoru chakli, bansh pora chicken, tribal red rice (veg) and the dragon prawn. The bansh pora chicken/mutton is a must if you visit this place. It's got a lovely aroma of burnt and cooked bamboo. The tribal red rice is good too, except I kind of found the smell of the ghee a bit overbearing. The dragon prawns were amazing too. I'd say for 270/280, the prawn dish was pretty much cheap given the rate of prawns at other restaurants. Overall, this is a GREAT place to enjoy a different kind of a meal. I am definitely going here again!

Since we went on a puja day, it was a bit packed but it was definitely worthy. The place is not that huge but the ambience is beautiful.

We tried -
Shoru chakli which was awesome
Bansh pora chicken -- which i'd always suggest.
Bansh pora mutton- we didnot like this item much and felt chicken was much better than the mutton. It was too spicy.
Malaysian noodles (with octopus, squid , prawn)- Which was veryyyy good.
Dragon pepper chicken - which was also very delicious.

Last comes the dessert that saved us from the spicy sensation that is --- Chemmeen kheer.
The dessert is made of kheer and prawn. Yes! You read that right. But it is very tasty and you'll feel like you having just the kheer. You wont get any taste of the prawn but can feel the presence of it.

Overall a very good experience with the tribal food. ‚ù§

This place is famous for its tribal cuisine. Easy locate. Great ambience. The service was pretty prompt. We ordered Beijing rice, Malasian noodles, squid, a chicken side dish ( I don't remember the name) and their signature dish banshpora chicken. Everything tasted really delicious but the banshpora chicken was class apart. It tasted heavenly. The pocket pinch was quite reasonable. I'm sure gonna visit this place again for the banshpora chicken and to try out octopus which is also a famous dish of this restaurant. To taste real tribal cuisine one must definitely give it a try.

Santa's Fantasea is an ideal pick when your taste buds are bored of monotonous dishes from known cuisines. This restaurant serves delectable tribal cuisine and sea food. The interiors are of a tribal theme that makes the ambience extremely appealing while justifying the cuisine they serve. The staff is helpful and polite. The lunch order included Bansa Pora Chicken, Soru Chakli, Burnt Chilly Octopus and Seafood Malaysian Rice. Each and every dish was mouth watering. The Bansa Pora Chicken had a mild smoked flavour which, I think, enhanced the taste of the dish. Soru Chakli perfectly accompanied Bansa Pora Chicken. Burnt Chilly Octopus was delicious and Seafood Malaysian Rice was indeed loaded with "seafood". I really wish they maintain their amazing consistency. Cheers!

Good food. Good ambiance. Good service. 
Though small, but from the moment you enter, look around to the time you taste the food, everything gives you the tribal feel. And its amazing. Indian Tribal cuisine is really delicious, and this place does justice. They have cuisines from tribals areas across India. We had ordered a fish item for starters, which was just amazing. Then we had ordered Bansh Pora Mutton, speciality amongst Odisha tribals along with wild rice , speciality amongst Mizoram tribals, which were just amazing. Mutton had that smokey spicy flavour, which went well with the wild rice. We did have a wonderful wild experience. Must visit.

Most probably the first restaurant to offer various tribalfoods in Kolkata

It's located near Golpark and Dhakuria Bridge. There is a road just beside Anjali Jewellers and the restaurant is only few footsteps away from the main road. This area is quite peaceful. And once inside the restaurant one becomes instantly relaxed because of the iterior decoration highlighting tribal art and the lighting. One wall of the main dinning area is of glass, but inside is not visible from the road. It's quite amazing inside. Because from the outside no one can think at first that the seatiing capacity is more or less 60. The wooden chairs are nicely designed, but I think they should provide cushions because it's not very comfortable, specially for elderly persons. But once the food starts to hypnotise the palets and tongues this uncomfort vanishes. The dishes are very tasty, quantity sufficient and prices reasonable. One imporatant point is that a few dishes are not suitable for those who do not like hot and spicy food. Therefore, it is better to discuss with the stewards or the captain/manager about the dishes before ordering. The service is prompt except a few dishes like Banshpora items which take 10/15 minutes to be prepared. The stewards are very polite, helpful, efficient and most impotantly jovial,, which has a positive impact on the clients.

Great place to try tribal and sea food. It has an unassuming appearance from the outside but the interior is interestingly decorated. The baansh pora mutton and patro pora are highly recommended in the tribal food section. The squids are also praiseworthy.

Visited this famous place in golpark with my friends and since our group was huge had the luxury to order many items...
1. Mutton soup
2. Shanghai squid
3. Bansa pora mutton
4. Smoked octopus
5. Malaysian rice
6. Canton noodles
7. Teriyaki chicken
Every dish has an unique taste and something you will remember for a long time. Special mention goes to "Shanghai squid" as we had to order 3 plates just because of its mindblowing taste and "Bansa pora mutton" the way it was served I personally have seen nothing like it!!! Being a foodie I dont care about ambience much but I really liked their "tribal" theme! Kudos to the team for putting up such a fine outlet! Look to visit there more!!!

Paid a visit this afternoon, just a jump's distance from golpark's Anjali jewellers..Ambience was cool, and the service staff were very courteous and well mannered...Serving time was amazingly very brief..The look of the place resembled a tribal mojo gimmick, which was unique and pleasing at the same time.
Coming to the food, ordered Bansh Pora chicken, seafood malasian fried rice and honey chilli fish, and they exceeded my expectations, though the quantity of the rice was a let down for the price range and quality offered..the fish practically bettered the chicken by a long shot (big deal for me)...serving in those earthen kullads was refreshing..
In the end even the service staff asking about the food and the ambience was a big cherry atop the ratings...
All in all a very good experience, looking forward for a repeat dosage pretty soon..

Been there a lot of times. But what I realised lately was that the quantity of the Cantonese noodles had reduced significantly. On querying they denied. But later while leaving; the manager accepted that the chef had supplied lower quantity that what should have been.
Moreover, the ambience is pretty good. Going rightly with its name.
I love the taste of both the seafood Cantonese noodles and the seafood topping noodles. But better quantity is asked for. I'll give the main course a 3.5/5
Ambience is a 3/5
The side dishes are pretty good too. The smokef fish or the baked fish or the honey chilli fish are all amazing.
If you like things a bit spicy; go for the sanghai squid. Otherwise the butter garlic squid is an absolute darling for the taste buds.
The crabs are delicious too, but difficult to eat,
I'd give the squids a 5/5 and the bhetki's quality is a win win too.
So, overall its a 3.5/5.
A small suggestion would be to increase the quantity of the main course, which would make this restaurant a 4.5/5.

I just LOVE this restaurant. Well-mannered staffs, the excellent and sufficient quantity of food.  We had, banse pora mutton, seafood malaysian noodles and dragon pepper chicken. Though i expected the chicken to be a bit more spicy, yet the taste wasn't that bad. The noodles was awesome. The banse pora mutton was the best. However, the waiter suggested us to have banse pora mutton and roti as it seemed to taste best, we preferred to take it with the noodles just to taste it. I would love to visit this place again and again. They truly made me fall in love with squids.

Unlike my first visit where I was totally disappointed, the Golpark branch of Santa's Fantasea turned out to be good. We ordered the following:
1. Malaysian Seafood Rice
2. Dragon Pepper Fish
3. Burnt Chilli Octopus 
4. Lemon Crabs
5. Bamboo Chicken 

Overall, it was a good experience. Though the oil content in the food was evident making it unhealthy. But the taste compensated the loss. The Burnt Chilli Octopus is a must try. üëçüèª

We went to SANTA'S FANTASEA recently. We had gone to this tribal restaurant a long time ago. Not only We liked the restaurant at that time but also loved it this time.

This time we ate the Mushroom Chilli Babycorn and Santa‚Äã's Fantasea seafood special soup for starters
It was an yum as the soup had lots of crab meat , squid , octopus , prawn and fish.The chilli babycorn also had the required elements of taste factors in it like the burnt flavour , the little bits of utter peppery flavour and so on. I would also like to tell that the babycorn and mushroom were cooked properly.

For Main course , we ate the Malaysian Seafood Rice , Burnt Chilli Prawn , Dragon Pepper Squid and Burnt Crab. First of all I would like to tell that the Burnt Chilli Prawn was a little bit salty. Besides that everything was piquant.The Malaysian Seafood Rice was awesome and the Dragon Pepper Squid was tasty and was cooked properly . The Smoked Crab was toothsome and was packed with the flavour of lemongrass.

For desert , we had the Mango Sorbet and the Natural   Strawberry ice-cream . The Mango Sorbet was scrumptuous and it was full of mango pulp and the Natural Strawberry Ice-Cream had tit-bits of real strawberry here and there in the ice-cream.The ice-creams were a new addition to the deserts.It was from the Lindon Dairy Co.

We had a scrumptous dinner and overall every food we ate excluding the Prawn dish was ambrosial .

So, I recommend that those who love tribal dish , must go and have a dinner there. You will be sure to tell the words 'DELECTABLE'.

Coming to d food ->we had taken bansa pora chicken- their tribal signature dish, seafood Malaysian rice, octopus in chili oyster sauce, dragon pepper chicken with eggdroplets... I personally didn't like bansa pora chicken.. Got strong burnt odour from d platter. But rice was very tasty.. The prawn, squids and another fish was there inside d rice.. Chicken was a bit heavy with d egg droplets.. My first ever attempt towards octopus.. And it was toothsome.. All along it is good selectionüòâüòä

If you are looking for a place that serves amazing sea food and unique tribal dishes , this is the place you should choose... The chilly octopus is a must try over here... The best item that it serves is the baans pora chicken... It is an absolute delicia served in bamboo stem... The sea food and the tribal food are equally good.. You may even try squids... All the tribal items are distinctive and you may try any one of them without much hesitation

I'm always impressed when places really make an effort to make a change. This is far and away the most interesting meal I've had in Kolkata. The food was spicy, wildly flavorful, wonderfully cooked, and a fascinating glimpse into unexplored culinary excellence of tribal india.¬†

Went to their Golpark outlet for lunch with my wife and it was really a beautiful experience. The food was delicious, really nice...actually it was amazing!

Their Bansa pora chicken,Teriyaki fish,Seafood Malaysian rice, and Soru chakli are pure love.The staffs were extra courteous.. helpful, tending to suggestions, ever smiling, and accommodating!!

Don't expect Indianized cuisine here and be sure to try their seafood section.¬†
The another reason why I loved this place is its crowd, no paneer tikka dal makhani butter naan & loud families here :)¬†

Overall, its perhaps the most memorable meal I've ever, ever eaten.¬†
A place definitely to go back to.

This place is an all time favorite as it is one of the few joints in kolkata which serves great sea food at affordable prices! I have been here 3 times and never has it disappointed me.
Ambience is decent with tribal motifs and wooden chairs. On my recent visit I saw they have finally expanded the restaurant and hence the problem of waiting for long periods to get your turn is also gone now!
Food- the food is soul stirring comfort food. Now I should mention it's not a happening place for vegetarians cuz its kind of a sea food haven. You'll find very few vegetarian items on the menu.
My all time favorite dishes-- the bansa pora mutton- the smell and sight of delicate mutton cooked in bamboo shell is irresistible!
Beijing noodles and malaysian fried rice- I've never been a fan of colored rices and noodles but this changed my mind!
On my last visit I tried squid here. Now I'm not a very adventurous person when it comes to food but given my trust in this place I placed the order and I have to say I did not regret it at all! LOVED it. It was juicy, spicy and not rubbery at all which was my biggest fear.
Also had jhupu pishir mutton--basically a tribal style mutton curry. I didn't like it that much somehow but my friend loved it. But the shoru chakli roti with which we had it is awesome! It goes well with the mutton and its so soft that it melts in your mouth!

The one item which I really don't like here is the chemmeen kheer. The idea of prawns in a kheer didn't really excite me in the first place but we ordered it anyways due to one of the staff's suggestion and also due to the lack of better dessert options. My assertions about the dish were sadly true and steer clear of this dish if you don't want to end your meal on a bad note!
Pocket pinch--generally between 800-1000 for two and trust me the quantity is pretty good!
Overall- a highly recommended place for tribal and sea food cuisines. I'd love to visit this place again and again!

Been wanting to visit this place for a long time.just did not find time. But then came Santa's fantasias kickass Facebook food videos which motivated me to come here finally.

So visited the golpark branch and ordered the following :

1) Burnt Chili Prawn 9/10
2) Bansh Pora Mutton 8.5/10
3) Shoru chakli Roti 8/10

All three items were absolute dynamite ! The prawn was fresh , soft and bursting with flavours. Their signature dish Bansh Pora Mutton, which is a Odisha local cuisine, is a winner all the way. The flavour is smokey, Mutton pieces came boneless and succulent , enough taste to leave you wanting for more. The manager very rightly recommend us to order the Shoru chakli Roti which is a rice based chapati, comes supersoft  and goes very well with the mutton. 

Decent clean decor. Lots of seating, good service. Price wise slightly expensive.

Overall highly recommended if you like your food slightly out of the box !

It's an amazing place to experience Tribal food.
We ordered Bans Pora Mutton and Bans Pora Chicken , Jupu Pisi er Mutton delicacy coupled with Some tribal rice( infused with Mutton) and Soru Chakli. I must say food tastes great. Ambience is also good. Stuffs are well behaved. Only negative thing is space. The floor area is not sufficient. Otherwise this is so far the best joint to have Tribal food.
In dessert we had onion kheer and prawn kheer...Yes! Onion and Prawn...Just superb.

Visited Santa's Fantasea for the first time and found this place superb for food lovers!! Though you have to wait for a seat if the restaurant is full but it is worth it. The employees working were very courteous and helpful. Hopefully they will continue the good work! Now coming to the food, I went with a friend and we had Shanghai Squid, Seafood Malaysian Noodles, Seafood Beijing Rice Noodles and Kori Gassi. All were well cooked and tasted awesome!!! The price is also very reasonable. And the best thing is that they have takeway option too!! Would love to visit again and try other delicacies!!!

Heaven for sea food lovers. I had no idea about the vastness of seafoods and then I came here with one of my foodie friend and got overwhelmed. Location is tough to reach cause no one knows about the restaurant at Golpark area except local teenagers. Banshpora Mutton is more tasty than the chicken preparation.

Went along with a friend there, tried their shanghai Squid, which was so pathetic and oily like like anything. I've tried dishes from here, and they are amazing. But this particular dish just made me almost puke. It was very crispy, so much that we didn't even recognise the taste or squid, ( god knows they gave squid or something else) . Very oily and a complete waste of money. Where as their mom is are no better than street shop momos ( only with too much cost and of course 18% GST )

For the past two years, was planning to come here. Unfortunately the plans never did materialize. But the chance of dining here eventually was presented tonight when my friends did choose the restaurant for satisfying the crying stomachs. And trust me, when we finished our 7 or 8 ordered dishes, it was like "Oh God, give me more! " Those who fancy seafood, will definitely be disappointed if they miss these dishes. Each dish was worth the money. But out of those, I shall specially mention "Banshpora Mutton " and a delightful dish of Octopus. Nevertheless the dessert called "Prawn Kheer" was absolutely stunning to finish things off. Hoping to go there again within a few weeks!

Located just in the lane of the anjali jewellery this is just even for sea food lovers.  Very easy to locate.. It takes a 2 mins walk from anjali jewellers showroom of golpark. 
The decor is fully based on underwater sea and tribal culture. 
I loved the decor.  Staffs behaviour were really nice and polite. 
Now coming to the food. 
Firstly please try bansh pora chicken or mutton with soru chakli.  It is awsome in taste.  The flavours orientation  needs to be mentioned.  It is a must try. 
Then i ordered mexican rice.  It is a green rice mixed with fish.. Squids and prawns.  Awsome in taste.  And a new dish to taste.  And i ordered baked prawns.  It was too good. 
Overall the food quality was great. 
Yuup a bit expensive place. 
But for good food easily this much can be spent. 
One must visit this place. 
You will love the food the ambience and most importantly  u will get oppurtunity to taste new types of food. 
They also keep different octupus recipes. 
This is a good option for octopus lovers. 
Santa's fantasea will never dissapoint you for sure.

Heard a lot about this place. So decided to opt for it. Tried the Tribal Cuisines for the first time & it turned out really well. We had Bansa Pora Mutton, Jadoh , Kori Gassi ,Seafood Malaysian & Smoked Fish. And trust me guys each and every dish was really tasty & delicious. A great treat to the taste buds. Guys must visit this place at least ones & I am sure you are gonna love it. Must try the Bansa Pora Mutton, Smoked Fish & Jadoh. Was thinking to try the onion kheer but my stomach didn't permit that. So will give it a shot next time. Will visit it  soon.

Had lunch here some days back.. Ordered smoked octopus and Shanghai squid as starters , well frankly speaking liked the octopus thing , smoked squid tasted like chilli baby corn which was good.
Tried Jadoh a meghalayan rice dish which was kind of dull for my palate. 
The speciality bansh pora mutton was nice, Smoky.
Tried mackerel ,didn't like it, my " kosha mangsho vat" palate may be not suitable for seafood.
But undoubtedly the stuffs there were very well behaved, nice and ambience was also very good..

This is my 5th time visiting this restaurant. Everytime I went there with a new person or a group as I personally vouched for the quality of food there. I visited when this place had the mention of all service charges being inclusive, thus didn't charge any tax over the price in the menu, and now the GST is being applied over the same price which was with inclusive taxes. This is kind of a dishonest route to go, which wasn't expected.

This time we ordered Soru Chakli, Bansh Pora Mutton, Jadoh, Kukhura Ko Masu and Tithou Kheer. Soru Chakli was disappointing for a Bengali who enjoys this delicacy as part of festivals and well aware of the quality it should be. The quantity of Bansh Pora Mutton really becomes an eyesore with the additional taxes to hike up the price even more but quality is still impeccable being succulent and smokey in flavour, although losing the quintessential smell very quickly. Jadoh, which I had before and is impressed more and more with every time I taste it, and Tithou Kheer(Onion kheer) were far beyond the expectations, but the overall experience was bogged down by the chicken dish which, although had a nice flavour in the gravy, had the chicken pieces being sub-par. Tithou kheer was a nice ending and though it has onions in it, there's no pungent flavour or smell, which is a nice and unique touch.

The staff was cordial and attended to every need throughout the time.

P.S - I have had almost every tribal item in their menu in my previous visits, of which, if I mention some, Kori Gassi was underwhelming, Patra Pora and Ngatok should be tried by any foodie and Voksh Meh is a niche item for those who love dishes with bamboo shoots(that distinct smell).

Have been to the golpark restaurant yesterday for lunch. We ordered burnt prawns for starters and bans pora mutton with roti for main course and onion kheer for dessert. To be very honest I didn't like it that much, probably my palate I would doubt. My husband kinda loved it. I found the saltiness and sweetness quotient of all the dishes were on the higher side. Overall it was an average experience for me.

Went there having seen a great rating and reviews about this resturant. And i was not disappointed at all. 
We ordered bansh pora chicken with soru chakuli pitha which was absolutely delicious. The chicken had a unique smokey flavour that would blow your mind from the first bite. Also ordered fried tuna fish wich was also awesome. It was served with an exotic sauce and the combination really tasted great. We were short in budget,so could not order more. But definately I will visit again to taste the flavour of other tribal and sea foods.

Ordered 1) Wild rice (mizoram) 
                2) Bansh pora chicken
                3) Jhupu pisi's Mutton
Pros: 1) Huge quantity
           2) Wild rice was spicy and very good. Loved it. Jhupu pisi's mutton was lovely with huge chunks and tasty gravy. Bansh pora chicken was also good but I didnt find diff. in taste with kababs.  
             3) Courteous staff. And helpful
Cons: Not very spacious

Pros - Unique variety of food served-try bashpora mutton, jaddo rice, jhupu pishi's mutton. themed decor, quanity is very good
Cons - though a themed restaurant the lighting and decor is a bit gloomy which is a deterrent for me; parking in front is a big challenge, better to park @city college road and walk; the utensils were not properly washed, the space is less.
Advice- The kitchen area looked a little unhygenic. If you can improve to a visually clean level you will have more footfall

It is located in Golpark and is not very hard to locate. The moment you get in, you literally get a feeling of being in some seaside or beach restaurant and hence it is themed like that..so a big tick for that. Coming to the food, we ordered bansa pora chicken, shanghai prawn, butter garlic squid and seafood malaysian noodles. The food was delicious, could not get enough of it and the staffs were quite courteous. So basically if you are a seafood lover, this might be just the right place for you!!

I have tried many variety of dishes in many restaurants across Kolkata, particularly being a resident of Bowbazar, had food all out at various restaurants in Park Street area. Specially Chinese food. But this was my first time trial at Santa's Fantasea Golpark outlet, the food was really different,  although I did not try out the regular chinese dishes, but I had Bansh Pora Mutton, Shoru Chakli, Shanghai Squid, Tilhou Kheer & Mango ice cream.... Its really fantastic... specially hats of to the cook whoever prepared Fantasea Soup, Bansh Pora Mutton & Onion Kheer... The ambience was fine, Mr. Anthony was very humble & Mr. Pradip was nice... Great food, great variety of dishes with Squid & Octopus... Just excellent! Value for money....

The ambiance is descent though there is a space crunch. The staffs are very well behaved and courteous. Overall, we had a wonderful experience.

Black horse? Underdog in hospitality? I don't know but I firmly believe wonders come in small packages & sometimes beyond expectations! Relatively small outlet adjacent to a lane of Anjali Jewellers in Golpark but thanks to zomato to guide to right path to the succulent, sumptuous, satisfactory journey for a foodie like me! Really never had a bad meal! Be it Banspora Mutton or Soru Chakli or teriyaki chicken or teriyaki fish or burnt garlic chilli prawn or seafood Malaysian rice! Mouth watering...not only at santa's, but even while writing this review after 15 days of cherishing the taste been out there! We gone there on a Sunday with a group of 10 pax with a fear of not getting seats. But good luck remains with good foodie! We got arrangement in the room adjacent to the entrance. Interior is not so impressive but staffs are very courteous. Being our first visit they suggested their best dishes. And result? Not repenting at all!

This is one of the best places serving good seafood in the city.I had heard about this place time and again but haven't visited all this time though had been to its sister restro Ecstasea.This has got a bit more space than its sister restro. Located in the lane beside Anjali Jeweller's, Golpark. Easy to locate.

The food was delicious as expected. Banshpora Chicken could have been a tad bit more of flavour. The Malaysian Noodles and Pepper Fish were pretty good. That was all we had. Might come back to taste their other seafood dishes. The thing that shouldn't go without mentioning is their decor which has been done to give u a feel of the sea and underwater experience. Happy Dining :)

A lazy rainy afternoon and good warm cosy food....what more could one ask for and the best way to cater to your mood is this place! It's been almost the tenth time that i have been back to this place and every time I search for a place to dine I end up finally choosing this. I can never refrain myself from rating this place to be the best of the all the current restaurants in Kolkata and even today it didn't disappoint me. We had wild red rice(recommend for people who love a little spice) teriyaki chicken. The star of the day though was the "patra pora"! As the name suggests it's a dish that has been char grilled but with a twist. It's minced mutton mixed with spices and grilled inside a banana leaf. Who would have imagined that mutton can be infused with 'kalo jeere'! We loved it! Fresh on the palette and a different experience altogether.
To cut the whole story short DO visit this place! It's probably one of the best gastronomic delights of the city!Obaak Ami

Great place if you're in the mood for sea-food! The service is prompt, and tge seating arrangement is decent enough, with 3 rooms. We ordered Shanghai Squid and Jadoh Rice. The rice was really spicy, and heavy with ample mutton chunks. Definitely going to visit this place again for the squid,though!

Went to this restaurant after reading so many positive reviews and blogger's suggestion. The interior design is kindof tribal and their service Is fast. Coming to food we ordered :-

1-  Bamboo chicken - It was excellent and something I'm trying for the first time. Best try it with soru chakli.  (4.5/5).
2-   Shanghai Squid - The show stopper dish of the evening for us,  Equally spicy n sweet. Excellent quantity. Amazing experience (5/5).
3-  Onion Kheer - An unique manipuri dish we tried,  it was worth it,  a must try desert (4.5/5)
4- Soru chakli - Roti prepared by dust of rice and egg,  It was so soft n delicious.  (5/5)

Overall verdict - 
Definitely best restaurant for tribal and seafood in kolkata,  if you are low in budget.  (4.5*/5) .

A marvelous place to enjoy the food that has the punch of tribal flavours. One of the most liked by all is the Banspora chicken/mutton which is absolutely mouth watering and has great deal of smoked chicken with perfect blend of the masalas! This is a must try if you go out there, the smell and the taste of it will just make you crave for more! I really like the way it is served in a chopped off bamboo shoot. Coming to the ambience, it is 'fantastic' (although there is a bit of space crunch). Among fish, i tried fried pepper tuna, its dry, definitely not oily which i usually prefer and loved its flavour. Other than this I also tried the seafood canton noodles, seafood Malaysian rice. The noodles is a mix of steamed squid pieces and neither too spicy noodles nor too oily. But, must admit I enjoyed the taste of the rice than the noodles which comes with prawns. Overall a good place, but make sure you don't go there in the rush our or peak seasons cause you have to wait in the que for a table! Loved the food :)

Went there for lunch with my wife,daughter,brother n sister..it has been in my wish list for some time..so I planned to land their ballygunj outlet on my bday
It's a thematic restaurant with tribal n seafood in focus.staffs are quite courtacious,but service lacks a bit I guess,needs a lil bit more promptness .
Food is great though..or rather overwhelmingly good.
We ordered basnsh pora mutton(Andhra tribal),Patra pora mutton ( odiya delicacy),soru chakli(made of rice flower),steamed squid,steamed octopus,n kheer with onion-a heavenly desert ...of which Patra pora n octopus stole the show..
Quantity 4/5
Taste 5/5
We once tasted basnsh pora chicken in Andhra,& the basnsh pora here tasted different..but u will appreciate its flavour in Santa's
Only one area which didn't impress me is ambience
May seem quite different at first glance,but given the opportunity they have,what they could do in tribal culture in mind,it stands out just below par..atleast according to the standard of food they serve,ambience lags behind
But all in all a very unique place to hang around..looking for a revisit soon to taste jhupu pisis mutton..sounds exciting..isn't it?

Tribal foods are very good. But as I dont like smell of fish, so the seafood fried rice was a little uncomfortable for me.
One thing I should mention. May be it is their policy of not to keep softdrinks as it does not match with their theme. But after all when they are keeping pet bottles, they must serve it chilled.

This is located near in golpark, a 2mins walking distance from the main road. Its a fusion of tribal and seafood with chinese. The internal decir will give a feeling of tribal house. The tables are made of bamboo. Water is served in clay pot. We only tried the tribal food items. Banspora chicken & soru chakli as the starter, wild red rice & jhupu pisi's mutton delicacy as main course & tilhou kheer as the desert. All the food items were very tasty. The staffs were also very helpful.

Wonderful food. First of its kind in Kolkata. Mainly Tribal Food but serves exquisite Sea Food also. Each tribal food is unique & satisfies the taste buds. Bansh Pora is very famous here which has almost become the signature dish. But there are lots of other dishes whish are must try. In the dessert section they have the Payesh. But its not the normal Rice pudding but its unique as it is the Prawn Payesh.

Great food. Great ambience. Malaysian Seafood Rice is exceptionally good. Noodles, Smoked Squid, Dragon Pepper Squid and Chili Basil Octopus taste good as well. Well decorated. Well mannered staff. Cutting half point because I feel they need to work on their timing, because they served us the octopus item much earlier than the other items(it wasn't a starter). This happened when I went there for the second time. First time experience was good. I have tried their seafood section only. Looking forward to try their tribal section. Thanks to

This restaurant has created a new revolution in the on going fusion food restaurant culture. Located in the lane of Golpark showroom of Anjali jewellers,this restaurant is actually 2mins walking from main road.This is a tribal and ocean food with chinese fusion restaurant and the ambience ,decor is very much commensurate with it.
We ordered their most known and famous dish-bansa pora mutton with sanghai squid and golden fried prawn in starters.
Special mention of the first 2 dishes. The bansa pora mutton is small tender pieces of mutton cooked in a bamboo with all the spices and herbs in tandoor,giving it a smoky flavour.Loved it always. The sanghai squid is a crispy tangy squid preparation cooked in a sweet and sour sanghai sauce.Really loved it very much.Golden fried prawn is 8pieces of batter fried prawns served with a sweet sauce.
In mains we ordered Malaysian sea food rice with dragon pepper fish and smoked crab. These 3dishes were really tasty specially the crab preparation.The gravy prepared in a red sauce with lemon grass in it ,giving it a special aroma and flavour. The crab pieces were with shell in situ but it was soft and juicy.Overall it was a lovely experience and every foodie must visit this place..

I could not give less than 4.5 because the experience here has been really great. This restaurant is located near Golpark Anjali Jewellers outlet. From outside the restaurant may look a little shabby but its interior is well and good. A good food joint to dine with your family. We( a group of 12 people) went there for a Sunday lunch and we have to wait for sometime to get our seats arranged. Usually on weekends it is a bit hard to get space there but thankfully we got lucky.

The interior decoration is nice and it gives you a feel of old tribal houses. There are many tribal paintings and designs on the wall and the chairs and tables were made of bamboo( which went with the theme).
Water is served on small clay cups and a neat and clean place it is.

Now, coming to the main part that is FOOD. Food here consists of two sections- tribal and seafood. We mainly ordered from their Tribal section as we were interested in trying some innovative tribal dishes.
We have ordered for--

1) Banshpora mutton( One must not fail to have this; this dish was oh so delicious. Mutton beautifully cooked with spices inside smoked bamboos. This made my tastebus go crazy).

2) Patrapora mutton( This is mutton cooked inside leaves. It is a bit spicy but really tasty. The concept is somewhat as if it is Mutton paturi.)

3) Soru Chakli( Rice flour roti which was really soft and tasty and goes well with Banshpora mutton and Patrapora)

4)Sticky rice(white non-spicy rice cooked with butter and vegetables. It was okayish in taste. If somebody wants to have something mild and non-spicy then it's the dish to choose.)

5)Jadoh rice(red rice slightly spicy cooked with mutton balls; It has a unique taste which was good.)

6) Then we had another dish whose exact name I forgot. It was a mutton dish and the mutton pieces were really soft cooked to perfection with herbs and after having all the above mentioned items this dish kind of tasted bland and subtle. But If someone is health conscious and want to have light preparation of mutton then this is the dish to choose.)

7) Last but not the least we had Tilhou Kheer(Onion kheer it is and it was really tasty. Before ordering this one I was a bit worried thinking how this combination would work at all? Onion and kheer?? But I am really lucky that I took the risk and went for this one. It is really yummy and gives you a taste of sweet cream and mild onion flavour.)

8) We also first time tried their octopus dish and it was worth trying. It was also tasty and spicy.

All in all a great experience. I would have rated this restaurant 5 but a prompt service is expected so just cut 0.5 marks there. Staffs were courteous and polite. A really great place to try out some lipsmacking innovative dishes. Highly recommended for all you foodies out there.

P.S. Banshapora mutton is highly recommended. Happy Dining :)
Will surely drop by here soon.

On of the most over hyped places in kolkata! But this place failed to impress us not only with their food but also with their service! Ordered the famous bas pora chicken, sticky rice and red wild rice! The bas pora chicken didn't have the infused smoke that i was hoping for! The sticky rice was a big turn off, it seemed as if the rice was dipped in ghee only!! The red wild rice had only one taste and that was of garlic and nothing else! Plus we had to ask for refilling our glasses with water several times before the waiters actually did it! As a matter of fact this place is a disaster literally!

Much overhyped to be honest. The banshpora chicken did not live up to the expectation rather it was barely palatable. The sticky rice was horrible with too much of ghee. The red wild rice had an overpowering taste of garlic. Service okayish. Location and decor are a big plus. Space management is well taken care of.
The food though disappointed big time.

Santa's Fantasea, undoubtedly the best there is in Kolkata regarding sea-food. I mean sure there are many more restaurants that offer a wide variety of sea-food, but the options there are always restricted to fishes and prawns. Santa's Fantasea rises above them all with its signature menu. I will highlight my visit to this place on a rain drenched afternoon.

Ambience - It is all themed to a tribal look, with the wall murals and furniture everything.
Staff - Courteous enough. Full points to that.
Food - I will start with the crab. Smoked Crab to be precise. It was a juicey crab with shells and cooked in light spicey sauce. Off course it is a messy job to eat crab bit by bit, but once you reach the core, it is pure juicey heaven. In main course, red rice was a bit spicey. But the second highlight was "Patra Pora", a dish claimed to be an Oriya tribal cuisine. Pieces of mutton (boneless), cooked and served wrapped in banana leaf was an absolute delight. It is a must recommended for all meat lovers.

End verdict - The sheer variety of sea-food is a key USP to Santa's Fantasea, but the mutton dishes are also as succulent as can be. I will surely visit again just for the "Patra Pora", it was true bliss for me.

Word of caution, sea-food such as crabs and lobster are extremely high on protein concentration, it is advisable to not mix them with mutton, for the uninitiated foodies, it can cause problem.

Visited this outlet once. This is the ideal destination for sea food and tribal food. Ambience is good.. Food quality and quantity is also good. Bansh pora chicken is their signature dish. It was very tasty and I recommend to try the dish along with 'Jadoh rice'. Overall experience is very nice.

It's the perfect destination for tribal and sea food. The decoration and ambiance was good the restaurant has 4 rooms interconnected and 4 of them has wall painted with different themes, one with sea animals, while others with various tribal paintings. 
Now let's get into the food..... octopus and squid are the most demanding ones but there is another dish banshpora mutton it's delicious. It's one of the best place to have sea food.

I find the restaurant a little bit overrated. I tried Bans pora mutton which is pretty tasty contains a smokey smell which I like. I had this preparation with soru chakli. Shanghai Squid was chewy, the coating was crunchy but not the squid, I didn't like much. Ngatok is a preparation of fish which is cooked within banana leaf, is tasty though I find it a little bit less salty. Prawn kheer is the thing I really liked. Actually no one can recognise the prawn if it is not told. The prize is also pretty high compared to the taste. Ambience and decore is quite good and the staff are very well behaved

It's the perfect destination for tribal and sea food!! I have bookmarked this one ever since I downloaded the zomato app. Finally went there today with two friends.
Starting with the decoration and ambience, the restaurant has 4 rooms interconnected and 4 of them has walls painted with different themes,one with sea animals,while others with various tribal paintings.

Now let's get into the food! We started with their signature tribal dish Bansa Pora Chicken and also ordered Schezwan Pepper Crab for starter. Wow!! The Bansa Pora is cooked in a bamboo and they serve in that, it has got the perfect smoky flavour, perfectly spiced up and a new one of its kind. The crab was perfectly spicy and we couldn't seem to get enough of the gravy! Most importantly the crab pieces were properly broken, hence it wasn't difficult to eat.

In main course, we ordered, Seafood Malaysian rice, Smoked Fsh and Teriyaki Chicken. The rice was done in some green sauce and we got prawn and squid in every bite. It was awesome. The smoked fish was done with lemmon grass and lemon leaves, while the chicken was done with with spring onion and bell peppers. Amazingly none of the dishes tasted similar and all were excellent in their own way.
Lastly we took one tihou kheer. Well we were unsure to try it as fusion of onion and kheer seemed too risky but well we didn't get disappointed. The smell of onion wasn't there and it tasted like sewai payesh and was nice.
Service is prompt and staff was good.
Only disappoint was they don't have any refreshment drink( the rice drink is off now)
I will definitely come back here to try whole set of new dishes. A must try for all

This restaurant was on my wishlist for a long time. Finally went there with  my friends. From outside the restaurant didn't look good but the interior was quite impressive. We ordered saru chakli roti and bans pora chicken. Both were very tasty. Saru chakli roti was very soft and the taste was quite different. Bans pora chicken was very tasty, the chickens pieces were very soft and had a nice burnt flavour, I just liked it. I recommend to try the dish. 
I heard before that they served a tribal drink to their customers before serving food and all the prices were tax included. But when we visited they didn't serve any drink and we had to pay tax. May be they had changed their rules. 
Their service was good, friendly. Like to visit there again to try another dishes.

this one will ex'sea'd your expectations...assorted tribal cuisines from select regions and choicest white meat delicacies
its an unapologetically designed non vegetarian place..hence you may expect a slight waft of kitchen..but on the whole nothing unpleasant and entirely pardonable..the waiting time is slightly on the higher side..prices are more than reasonable and the portions served are generous
last of all - eat while its hot
my recommendation - jadoh rice and bansa pora mutton/chicken

I had a chance to visit this place when it was relatively a new kid on the block. My first experience of this restaurant was mind-boggling. The food was simply magical. Previously they used to give a complimentary rice drink on my last visit I was surprised to see they have stopped that. Previously the servers were quite gentle now the servers don't know why always seem to be in a hurry. On my last visit I ordered a squid dish , a prawn dish and noddles. As I was getting late coz of some emergency I asked them to pack the prawns n noodles. We ate the squid at the restaurant coz it was served already. When we asked the server to pack it they seemed irritated and there behaviour was quite strange. On reaching home when I opened the box I found that they have given me rice instead of noodles. Previously this place didn't charge taxes prices were inclusive of all taxes but now it's not the same.
It became one of my favourite restaurant on my first visit but the second visit was really quite disappointing. 
The food is really good but it needs to work on the other aspects.

A great location and amazing decor. The tribal cuisine is really an innovation to the restaurant. Coming to the food, the banspora chicken was a delicacy here. The sea food salad and fried rice were also good. Great quantities served. Pocket pinch reasonable. Most of all they serve a nice spread of sea food. Octopus and squids ate available.

Visited this outlet twice. This outlet is known for their off-beat menu and introducing tribal cuisine and seafood in Kolkata which is accepted by Bengalis wholeheartedly. There may be many restaurants with seafood delicacy but Santa's Fantasea made octopus and squid more affordable. I visited this place about 2 years ago when we were served a complimentary drink tankha turani but it is not being served now.
Coming to food we tasted till date:
Chowchu Chicken - This is kind of crispy chicken which tastes good.
Shanghai Squid - This is the only seafood dish I tried here and it was so good. This dish made my first squid tasting experience amazing.
Bansa Pora Chicken - This is from Orissa. I find this item overpriced and nothing to go gaga over it. We also ordered patra pora but we were informed that it would take much time so we skipped it. We ate bansh pora with Soru Chakli which is a thin roti made with maida which too I find high priced.
Wild red rice - This dish is of mizoram and it veg version of jadoh.
Jadoh - I just loved this dish. It is dish is of meghalaya, primarily a khasi delicacy. As far as i know the authentic dish is cooked with pork/chicken. Although here it is done with mutton which anyway is very flavourful. This is spicy red rice with mutton pieces in it. While browsing I found out this is served with Doh jem or tungrungbai. I'm looking forward for the day they introduce them in the menu and pork, which is basic part of many tribal food.
Voksa Rep Chum or Jhupu Pisi's Mutton - Introducing the star dish of tribal cuisine from mizoram. This dish compliment jadoh rice perfectly. The mutton pieces were so soft, just the way I prefer, with a bit spicy gravy.
Voksa Meh - This dish was not liked by me much as the mutton pieces were not soft as voksa rep chum.

Also I think they should the start platters system here also which is present in their salt lake,sector 5 outlet. I can understand they have started this to cater office crowd there but here also there are many college students who will readily accept platters.

Ok so I have been to their sector 1 outlet before, and whenever I visited this place..they used to be full..and we were asked to wait for long time... So this time I made one early visit on a weekday ,and got our seat. :D¬†
The interior has a tribal touch, table-chairs are made of bamboo and the stuffs are really helpful, courteous..and now without taking much time..I am coming to the food..

We ordered bamboo chicken and saru chakli as starter, as main course jhupu pisi mutton and jadoh, and Tilhou Kheer as dessert.

So it took about 10-15 minutes..and our starter was served.
Boneless chicken pieces coated well with masala ,cooked and served in the bamboo stick, had a different test and smell which really made it unique..Soru chakli is just roti made of rice floor..so thin and tasty, combined really well with the chicken.¬†
Though I would like to prefer their bamboo mutton ¬†over this bamboo chicken...but it was nice though.

Next comes jadoh rice, spicy rice with generous amount of mutton chunks in it..and the flavor it got, is just spot on..awesome. I could just leave everything and eat the rice only..
.
The jhupu pisi mutton was a big surprise for me. Trust me..I had this kind of mutton dish after ages. Four mutton leg pieces,had a unique flavor..the gravy was mind blowing ,loaded with loooottttts of garlic..it was just heaven in my mouth..with every bite I take. And u can just imagine by now..how was my experience with this two together in my mouth.... I just totally found it my soul food, and loved it to every bit.

Lastly we had Tilhou Kheer as dessert..which is basically kheer with few chopped onions in it. Tasty really, but a little bit too sweet it was for me.¬†

But however the jadoh rice and jhupu pisi mutton has won my heart all over..and I am just gonna come back to this place again to have that. I will highly recommend this place to everyone. Do visit surely...

Another item was smoked fish which was finger licking good.This item was also little bit spicy.Fishes were very soft so u can easily cut them by a single spoon.lastly I ate the Shanghai crab...This item was little bit sweet and very much tasty.U can go there and can experience the tribal and sea food under single roof....When i will visit this place next time i will try the crab momo which was not available this time...

This was my target from ages.. finally got the chance yesterday.. it was a very nice experience indeed.. different from the common cuisines we come across.. so here goes my review..

About the food.. we were 4 people yesterday and the quantity seemed to be a little less at first.. but in the end we had to stuff our stomach up so that the food doesn't get wasted..

Coming to the quality.. If you are fond of very subtle flavours, then Santa's Fantasea is definitely not a place for you.. but if you are up for outburst of flavours in your mouth, you have got to pay a visit to thia place.. the Bansapora chicken came as the 1st dish which acted as an appetizer bring a dry preparation.. it was marvellous.. then came wild red rice, and jhupupisi's mutton delicacy.. the rice itself seemed a complete dish being filled with flavours.. and me being a non mutton person.. enjoyed the mutton preparation to my very own surprise.. so, it ought to be pretty awesome.. finally we had Seafood Malaysian Rice.. which was complemented perfectly by Honey Chilli crab.. Our eating spree ended with deli ious desserts.. cookies and cream.. chocolate double delight and a mizo preparation named Tilou kheer.. this Tilou Kheer is something that did not impress me because for me the Onions and kheer do not go hand in hand.. But overall it was an excellent out of the box experience..

Now coming to the decor.. it is really nice complementing the theme of the restaurant i.e tribal and marine decor.. they kept it pretty simple too.. the the good thing was there was no dim lighting which we find in most restaurants these days..

The behaviour of the staff was also very cordial.. and their recommendations were perfect.. the service was also pretty quick ..

It's a dine out experience I'll cherish.. I'll surely visit again and would recommend everyone at least once..

The food was good. The famous bash pora mutton was yummilicious. Crab filled momo was not availabel. Teriyaki chicken and the jadho rice were perfect with each other. We ordered baked fish but I'll suggest never order it. Its not at all good. Verry little cheese just on the top and rest mayonnaise. But we were very disappointed by their service. We had to wait a king after giving the order for the main course. It was so bad hat when we asked for water 2-3 times they have handed over the jug to us. And the most disappointing situation was when we ordered bash pora mutton for parcel and after coming home it was found to be 1/4 th mutton and the rest to be chicken.

'Bansh Pora Mutton' was the weird food item I had heard from my brother! So went to this cool outlet at Golpark. The decor is good with tribal motifs and the food is mouthwatering. We had this delicious 'Bansh Pora Mutton' which we relished along with Wild Red Rice. The complimentary tribal beverage was too good. The owners, however must expand the place. It becomes too crowdy ¬†during holidays.

First of all kudos to the idea of presenting tribal cuisine in the heart of Kolkata. Primitive , simple yet delicious food will steal your heart. I visited Santa's Fantasea ,Golpark thrice. And all three visits went fine. Many complains of space crunch but thankfully I had always managed to get seats till now & enjoyed my afternoon meals.
During my first visit with my spouse , we ordered a plate of Shanghai squid for starter, 2plates of Wild red rice (a Mizo tribal delicacy) with signature dish bansh pora chicken and patra pora mutton(odhisa) . It was absolute worth for the money paid. The decor too has a tribal and sea theme.
On my second visit I ordered crab momos, but it was not upto the expectation, the crab filling inside was very less. For dessert I ordered a Manipuri tribal dessert Tilhou Kheer . Each spoonful of Tilhou Kheer was blissful. Those who have sweet tooth or is an experimental foodie like me will definitely go crazy for this. Before tasting Tilhou Kheer , I was critical about adding onion in kheer but the suggestions from friends and cousins always included this dessert. So the final encounter with the dessert was surprisingly awesome.
The third solo dining was in a late summer afternoon of April. This time the order consisted of Soru Chakli and Bansh pora chicken. Needless to say bansh pora chicken or mutton by Santa's Fantasea is the best form a bamboo can be presented. Since my last taste experiment with Tilhou Kheer went fine I decided to taste Cheemeen Kheer,a sweet traditional dish from Kerela. The Kheer is more or less like Tilhou Kheer. The only difference between the two is in Tilhou onions are added and in Cheemeen Kheer prawns are added. But the experiment with cheemeen kheer didn't went well. The cheemeens (the prawns) were very dry and will definitely not remain in my suggestion list.
Overall the experience at Santa's Fantasea went fine. The signature dishes are enough to steal the limelight and rating. Try the tribal flavours at least once if you are passionate about food.

The location is good, google map shows you the way with pin point accuracy. 4 wheeler parking is a prob during the peak hrs.

It gives you a good tribal feel, menu is uncommon here, something we never actually tried. Our order was:

Baby corn pepper (didnt like it)
Bansa pora mutton (felt like the mutton was cooked and then stiffed into the bamboo cavity)
Burnt chilly octopus (didnt like it, will not suggest a sausy dish if you r trying octopus for the first time)
Dragon pepper tuna (tuna was falling apart, over cooked)
Jadoh rice (tasted good, had generous amount of mutton pieces)
Jhupu pisi mutton (was disappointing)
Shanghai squid (best thing we tried there, squid was awesome)

We were 7 in number. Ambience was good with prompt service and friendly staff. Worth a try if you around golpark area. I would recommend trying their squid over octopus.

Till now this is the best place to tryout the dishes like Banshpora mutton , bamboo shoot octopus, honey chili squid, Sea food Beijing rice and sea food canton noodles

None of the dishes fail to amaze..though the space is crammed but the food makes up for it. When you walk out with a belly full of baby octopus and squids it seems your day is made. Crabs, prawn, mutton, etc. Everything has a twist and the gravy of each dish is distinguished and different. I hope I could lick the plates but that would seem obscene.

I heard much about this place but never really felt the urge to visit the place for I am allergic to sea-food. This time on my visit to Kolkata, some of my ex-colleagues persuaded me to look at the options for chicken dishes offered and join them for lunch in here. I went through the menu, looked at the reviews and ended up going to this place to only have the Wild Red Rice and Baansh Pora Chicken. I didn't like the Baansh Pora Chicken as much, as I felt it was little under-cooked. The Wild Red Rice was okayish. My colleagues, who wanted to taste the various sea-food offerings in here, changed their mind suddenly and started looking for nearby places to eat. They didn't want me to feel left out while they gorge on crabs, prawns, squids, etc. To which the staff assured that they can make everything with just chicken and bhetki with not a single piece of prawn or squid in it. I kept telling them about my severe allergic condition, to which they kept re-assuring that I shouldn't worry. We ordered for Malaysian Noodles and a Fish prep (which I didn't taste). I got an after-taste of prawn after 2-3 spoons and immediately stopped eating. I came back home and the next day I developed the allergic reactions. I was angry and disappointed. My first mistake was to go to a place which specifically offers sea-food. The second mistake was to count on the staff, to believe on their words that they will prepare the food keeping my concern in mind.

Went for a casual dinner with my friends from BOI last Sunday. The place was less crowded. Guess the early hype has died down a bit. We ordered seafood salad, zedoh rice (Hope I have spelled it right!!) and bans pora chicken. The salad was delicious but cucumber pieces were in abundance rather than sea food! The rice was subtle with shreds of mutton and mild aroma of ghee. Together with bans pora chicken it was a sumptuous dinner. The decor and ambience was average. I will recommend for an upgrade.

Hello everyone..

This blog is going to be quiet interesting, because this is from¬†my one of those clients for whom I write Ad Script..and trust me to please them with the radio script is not so easy work‚Ä¶

But they are doing really tremendous job with their food..

Santa‚Äôs Fantasea basically offers tribal and seafood..Their signature dish Banshpora Mutton is very popular, though some of my friends didn‚Äôt like it..

The procedure of this particular dish is very different..Here a bamboo is stuffed with marinated mutton and then it goes to the oven. (for full method check youtube)..For that reason there is a smokey flavor in the entire food which some might not like..

¬†

But another signature dishes are : STICKY RICE, MALAYSIAN RICE, BELGIAN RICE, KALAMARI, SHRIMPS, SQUID, OCTOPUS etc..

Basically if you love tribal and coastal food please visit Santa‚Äôs Fantasea.

But guys you should not wait your customer for more than 20minutes.

We ordered dragon pepper chicken,smoked squid and malaysian seafood noodles. Quantity wise it was okay for two of us. Noodles were good.Chicken was tasty. But squid was delicious.crispy .not so spicy.It was more like a starter for us.

I gave 4 points to "Santa's Fantasea" for its ambience and food quality.Heard a lot about this place & at last went there on valentine's day.
The decoration(Tribal theme) was awesome.And the main attraction is their anomalistic Tribal cuisine they serve.I ordered Bansa pora chicken from tribal cuisine, Dragon pepper squid & Seafood Malaysian rice from seafood cuisine.Bansa pora chicken is their signature dish.This preparation was too much spicy which I don't like.The squid preparation was tasty.& Malaysian rice was not up to the mark.Staffs were nicely behaved & helpful.
And lastly I must say that it's a cost effective restaurant.will go again.Love food.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

The Malaysian rice is amazing. And the squid was beyond amazing. With the right amount of spices, the item was a delicacy. The Bnash Pora chicken is a highlight of the restaurant. It comes with a tribal rooti (shoru chaki) which is so so tasty. Food is cost effective and delightful.

I rated it 4 cause the service and food served during weekend is just so amazing that i cant rate it lower. But you find a different scenario on weekdays.  Of tribal food interests you, if you are an omnivore in nature, just drop by and hog up to your heart's content. Baas pora mutton is a mist try.

Santa's Fantasea had been on my "to visit" list for AGES, it just took far, far too long to convince my parents to try what is slightly alternative cuisine to their traditional Indo-Chinese tastes. But I knew that the hundreds of recommendations I got weren't likely to be all wrong, and this place would turn out to be a culinary delight. It truly is. 

Here's the thing about ordering at SF, the waiters will recommend the pricier dishes - they'll sometimes work and sometimes not work. I can try and dispel some myths. 

We tried the famous Baansh pora mutton with Soru chakli roti. Here's the thing - this meal is overrated and overpriced. The quantity is pitiable at best, the taste is average, and whereas the quality of meat is pretty nice, you really are left wondering whether this is even remotely worth the hype. For these dishes, it's not. Also, 30 rupees (outside of taxes) a piece for each miniscule roti - NOT WORTH IT. 

But this is where things improved. We ordered Jadoh - the spicy red rice with mutton pieces, an absolute delight in my opinion. It's puffed up tribal rice, not your usual fare of basmati, but it tastes amazing and the liberally spread mutton pieces are delightful. We had Kori Gassi, an amazing green chicken curry with it. The coriander really shone through the curry - although if you don't like coriander, stay far far away from Kori Gassi. 

Note - we wanted to have Patra Pora but we were told it was going to take a long time to make it. Not the thing a hungry customer wants to hear during lunch. Hence we had to switch to Baansh pora. I just feel disappointed about it now. 

However all this couldn't remotely fill us up, so we ordered Seafood Malaysian noodles and on the waiter's recommendation - Burnt chilli prawn. The noodles were delightful to me, fish and squid were present liberally and the taste was quite mild - a conscious decision since we had ordered the slightly intimidatingly named prawn. However the prawn turned out to be the star of the meal. It was absolutely delicious, spicy but nowhere near an unpleasant heat, indeed it was as if even the heat added a different layer of taste. Very strongly recommended. 

I will be going back - for the Patra Pora, the Shanghai squid and another round of the burnt chilli prawn.

This was my second time at santa's fantasea. The food as usual was very good. Their bansh pora chicken is awesome. This time we tried only tribal food. With bansh pora chicken we had Kukhura Ko Masu a tribal cuisine from Sikkim which was spicy and tangy and wild red rice. The rice was on a spicier side. Although we asked for medium spicy yet it was too hot. For people having a sweet tooth and who cannot tolerate spicy food I would recommend them to try Sticky rice since it comes in a sweeter taste. The best thing i liked was the mango sherbet ice cream. It had a real pulpy feeling in it which is most of the times absent from other ice creams. Overall the staff behaviour was good however they seemed to be in some sort of hurry since they gave the bill even before we had finished the ice cream. so -0.5 for that. However I think that this is the place to go if you want to try out something different at affordable prices.

Situated near the Anjali Jewellers at Golpark this place have had a good mouth publicity going for them. And the main attraction here is the unconventional tribal cuisine they serve. It takes more than luck to get a table here during the weekends. Delicacies like Jhupu pishi's kasha mangsho, Bansh pora mutton (their famous bamboo cooked mutton) and soru chakli are few of the many brilliant dishes that you would find here. That being said they are moderately costly and may effect a good chunk on your pocket. Hence one should think twice before bringing your date here although the food and ambience is up to it. The service here is very ordinary and the waiters look tired and uninterested. They don't keep reservations so no point trying that. If you're driving here parking may be an issue as this is located inside a small lane. If only they would have had nice music playing here and a tad bit better service this would have been perfect.

Soru Chakli, mutton bansa pora and fried spring pomfret were the dishes we ordered. Believe me, you cannot have better tribal dishes anywhere else in the city.

The atmosphere enhances a tribal feeling, the decor suits the dishes which are served. Staffs are fine. 

Coming back to food, Bansa pora is a gem. The bamboo flavour in the mutton is really unique and a signature dish.

Another positive side of Santa is the reasonable pricing. The experience here was great and I keep recommending this place to all the foodies.

We have visited the place last week to celebrate farewell of a dear friend and we were very much eager to explore their tribal foods basically.. But being a sea food lover we ended up ordering smoked octopus and seafood lung fung soup. We found these  dishes very average and octopus were not juicy and ruined our taste buds completely.. So we skipped sea foods and started ordering tribal dishes...Among them that red rice with meat balls are good and got authentic north eastern aroma and their famous bashpora mutton got that nicely blended added fragrances.. I personally had problem with soru chaklis ( for me it was not properly baked). As far as interiors are concerned, it is very below average. They tried to go for a tribal rural interiors but messed up completely.. It looks very artificial. One can hear voices from other tables clearly as they lie in close proximity which is completely unacceptable.. During summer if you opt for regular water, they don't even give cold water..
They follow strict timings, upto 4pm for lunch... We were in mid of our lunch, suddenly one came and told us we need to pay the bill first as they will wrap up the stuffs.. Asking for bill payment before the food ends is a total massacre from their side.. It shows lack of professionalism...

Starting from their oyster chlli basil octupus to banshpora chicken to karri gassi to their rice & even their mesmerising ambience everything is so much wonderful including their service. It has become famous among seafood lovers. I must add I had a beautiful date with good food.

First and foremost thing, THE BANSHPORA MUTTON - its a killer man.. I could order 2/3 plates of it and eat all of them alone üòõ. N e ways, the Prawn momo, the chicken side, the tribal rice, all tasted good.. moving on Tried Octopus over there for the first time, and it tasted quite well to me.. also, their sea food noodles and squid side were good enough as well.. I would say it is a decent place to try out some sea food & tribal delights in a budget..

I went to this place with 3 friends of mine and the moment I entered the restaurant I was amazed by its interior decorations.. the theme is basically tribal out there..n it's quite spacious too.
Now coming to the food .. we ordered seafood Malaysian rice,smocked fish,tankha tarun,arsa chhum.I must say that each n every dish was really awsm n tasty..bt arsa chhum which was a chicken dish n the chicken was not dt that soft kind of,thats what we didn't like .. 
As per as hospitality is concerned .. this place knows the best. Really good n also the order came fast at our table.

Overall it's a very nice place.. pocket friendly..huge gang can be taken as it has plenty of space to accommodate.MUST VISIT TO GIVE YOUR TOUNGE THE TASTE OF VARIOUS TRIBAL FOOD ACROSS INDIA AS WELL AS THE GLOBE...

Banshpora chicken was awesome. One of the best place for tribal food. Awesome decor. Loved to spend time there. We also ordered malasian noodles and smokey fish. The smokey fish was very tasty. Price and quantity are quite balanced. I must recommend others to visit there.

Unique decor and lovely presentation along with great food. Love the small place. Their trademark Bansh Pora Chichen and Mutton are delicious when tasted with Soru Chakli. ¬†I would recommend trying their fish items more apart than Bansh Pora dish. I did not like other chicken or mutton dishes that much. The restaurant being a rather narrow road can prove little difficult for parking. Overall, love this food joint.

Haven't tasted seafood yet? Santa's Fantasea is the place to make you fall in love with seafood for sure. Besides seafood the Tribal cuisine is supposed to attract one's attention. Having a great ambience Santa's Fantasea meets the cravings of some delicious sumptuous meals at reasonable prices.
Banshpora Mutton or Chicken is a must try. 'Shoru Chakli' the name itself has its own kind of a charm satisfying the taste buds. Among the seafood dishes Oyster Chilli Basil Squid or Octopus,Butter Garlic Squid,Dragon Pepper Squid,Malaysian Rice or Noodles have their own kinds of mesmering tastes. Ah!Fried Prawn Momo and Tangy Chicken are the additions to the Chinese list.Thus,Santa's Fantasea is the place to put out any seafoodgasm or just the craving of some really good Chinese food.

After months of planning had a chance to visit the place. As suggested by the zomato reviews we ordered popular dishes to play a bit safe as crab fried momo, baansh pora mutton, soruchakuli and onion kheer. Loved them. Thanks to the earlier reviewers. Expecting to visit pretty soon and would try new dishes from their list. Will really request people to visit once if you wanna try something different.

I went there with two of my friends. They serve authentic tribal food. You can not really expect classy ambiance here,it was moderate and gives you that tribal feeling. But one cannot resist to praise about their food. We took shoru chakli and bansh pora mutton. And they were perfect combination. Then we took wild rice.The taste of food here is so unique.And also we had their popular Smoked Octopus üêô. It was prepared so well.This restaurant is highly recommend for both mass and class. The price is very reasonable. Staffs are helpful.I was satisfied with their service. üëç

Went to have lunch here. The entrance is nicely decorated. Interiors are also really nice. Tribal feel to it. One con that I found as I headed to my seat was the presence of flies. They should have better pest control. The menu is very unique. Tribal foods, sea foods. I ordered the baby corn mushroom pepper and a rice dish from Meghalaya (they don't have a lot of vegetarian options, that's why 3.5). The quantity of the baby corn mushroom dish was a little less I felt. Rice was sufficient for 2 people. My friend ordered the bans pora mutton and a roti that accompanies it as suggested by the waiter. He was raving about the bans pora, said it was excellent and quantity was good too. For cold drinks all they had was coke, that's it (another con). I heard the crab dish is really good too although can't say about it as didn't try. All in all good if you are looking for a unique eating experience and if you are looking for non vegetarian menu. Not recommended for vegetarians.

This was our first visit to the place and quite interesting. I like seafood and that's the reason my friends advised me to try the food here.
We started with Bansh pora mutton, which was quite good. It is also the most recommended dish here.
My friend's advice was to try the octopus here. So we ordered Chilly Wine Octopus. Did not like the taste of octopus much as it is little rubbery for my taste. But the taste of the gravy was awesome.
We ordered seafood Malaysian rice which was quite tasty, except for the presence of squids (again rubbery for my taste). So I decided to sort out the squids. Next was the smoked fish which was great. We liked it the most.
Overall a good experience and would love to visit again.

Mixed feelings - I like their sea foods, tried butter squid, octopus and mixed Singapore rice noodles. Also had hot garlic chicken and dragon prawn. But their speciality which is Bash Pora Kosha Mansho, is in my view an overpriced item which doesn't taste that good, compared to the other dishes. My mother seem to be a fan of bashpora, I don't know why.

We faced a bit of problem while finding out the exact location. However, we had Google maps to our rescue. On our particular visit, we ordered for Shanghai Squid,  Red rice, Banshpora chicken, Chill basil octopus in oyster sauce. I had read a lot about Banshpora chicken but I personally didn't find any exception other than the concept how it is cooked. It tasted pretty much like a casual dish. I loved the squid and octopus; no wonder this place has specialised in sea food varieties. Last but not the least, we ended our lunch with the Tiltou (onion) kheer which is wonderful.

The ambiance is really nice and they have well maintained the theme. The stuffs were well-behaved and very polite. Coming to the food I have orders Soru Chakli with Bansa Pora Mutton and Patra Pora Mutton and Seafood Malaysian Rice. What can I say, all the food were delicious. Definitely recommended and will visit next time to try the other dishes also.¬†

Visited with a couple of my friends.
Nice ambience and great staff.
Tried a variety of stuff and they all turn out to be quite good.
1. Seafood supreme soup - The staff suggested us to go for it and the soup really put us off guard. One of the best soups ever tasted.
2. Shanghai squid - Nice and crunchy.
3. Smoked Octopus - Nice tender cooked octopus with a great sauce.
4. Soru chakli - okayish. Not much of a surprise there.
5. Bansh pora mutton - Great taste and the smoky smell is to die for.
6. Jadoh - This Meghalayan delicacy is a gem of a rice platter.
7. Jhupu pisi's mutton delicacy - 4 pieces of mutton with a nice gravy
Overall had an awesome experience.
Rated .5 less as we want something new and fresh from the bag of Santa on our next visit.

The place was charming to be precise. We had been there on a Sunday and found it to be packed. Luckily after a two minute wait, we got our seats. The menu was quite interesting and took us a while to decide on our order. We chose the threaded chicken fry as the starter, which was yummy, the famous bansa pora chicken, which came in bamboo sticks and looked as well tasted delicious. Soru chakli was one of a kind and absolutely light on the tummy. We then went for the Ngatok which I personally found to be quite bland and did not quite like. The bill was not too heavy on the pocket either. Definitely plan to check out more dishes the next time I visit.

The food is amazing...especially the seafood Cantonese Noodles. 

However, please train your staff to effectively communicate with customers. They were not very helpful to us, when I asked about the details of any dish they just replied saying it's sauce based..same reply for every dish! 

Also...please improve the seating. I understand it's a Tribal Themed restaurant but please put cushions on the chair. 


But the food saved the day! Reasonably priced, good taste and quality.. Hoping to come back sooon

An amazing restaurant with diversified flavours, this is the food joint you were looking for if you were tired of the usual Chinese and Mowglai cuisine. The food here is amazing, though the service is a bit lacking and is untrained. 
The location is in the lane of Anjali Jewellers at Golpark, and the inside has been expanded to include four rooms, meaning there is adequate seating facility. They serve tribal as well as seafood cuisines.
On our particular visit we had the banspora chicken from the tribal section.
We also had the onion kheer which was extremely tasty.
From the seafood section we had the chili squid, which I would recommend to anyone trying out this place as well as a seafood rice. The prawn dumplings were spectacular and a must try.

Heard about this place, so paid a visit. Ambience wasn't too great. Place is small and cramped, and it was more crowded, the day being a Saturday. Food was tasty. Chairs were uncomfortable. Feeling like a makeshift restaurant. Its on the cheaper side, thats a little plus point. Malaysian rice was good, so also the smoked prawn.

An absolute delight.

This place expertises in the best tribal and seafood delicacies in town.
The ambience and decor has a subtle blue calm touch with tribal paintings and carvings and unique wooden chairs and tables. It's a ride to enjoy the food feeling like you're in the same place from where the food comes,isn't it.

Coming to the authentic taste of the items in their menu..
They maintain special skills in cooking the seafood with respect to perfection.
Gladly,I enjoyed every mouthful I tasted.

We had the famous Bansa Pora Mutton. Needless to say, everyone tries it and loves it. It's a must have. Mutton roasted on a bamboo with minimal oil. The Mutton flesh is shredded and juicy. However you're left with a smoky aftertaste,something not everyone enjoys. But awesome nonetheless.

The Squid in Butter and Garlic sauce was a surprise. It was the first time I tried squid,was hesitant initially. For the first timers, it's somewhat rubbery in texture,but melts as you keep chewing. The flavours were very good. I much liked it.

The Schezwan Crab was absolutely yummy. Crab lovers know that there's a certain prawn like smell and texture that you expect and love, but it's unique and softer in its own way. The spicy sauce enhanced the meat. The legs were crunchy and it tasted very very good.

Mongolian Rice was a spicy treat. Don't go for it of you're not very good with chillies. I personally quite liked it.

A wonderful experience guys. Run to Golpark already. Or your nearest outlet.This is all you're looking for!

This place calls itself a seafood restaurant and when we visited and asked if they have Salmon they were telling that king fish is salmon. 
The king fish given was too old.
The squids were not properly cooked.
The king fish was also cooked in Chinese sauce.

I have eating seafood since a long time and went to this place to kill my salmon hunger. But now I hate king fish too.

Not a good place for seafood lovers.

We went to this place for lunch, mainly to try their seafood and tribal cuisine that we have heard so much about. We started off with steam crab momo and juhu pitha - the crab was well cooked though the outside was a bit chewy; the juhu pitha was a unique dish, a bit dry but quite tasty.¬†
Next we moved on to soru chakli and bansa pora chicken - the former was soft and blended very nicely with the chicken, which was emitting a smoky essence that is typical of this dish.
Last of all we finished off with smoked octopus and malaysian noodles. The octopus was easily the best dish of the day, and was one of the best ones that I've had.¬†
The ambience is family friendly with all the tribal wallpapers and the staff very cooperative. Overall a nice experience, would like to visit again. :)

The reviews we read before visiting a place adds to our positive attitude towards that place. This particular place have received a lot of acclaim and i was very hopeful before my weekend dine in. Julu pitha turned out to be a chicken stuffed bun with indian spices much like the steamed bun we enjoy so much in tirreti bazaar. The wild rice was very flavourful and left us craving for more. The cheemmeen kheer was bland and nit upto the mark.

What I noticed is that they have expanded a lot in these few years and are doing really well.
Coming to food. We decided to have a gala lunch. We ordered a seafood soup to start with, then came our favourite squid fried starters. For main course we got bansa pora mutton with jadoh. Both of them are just too good. The mutton pieces were well cooked and tasty. We always refer this outlet to our friends. Keep it up

I had visited this place last year in the month of October and I am really sorry for late review. I had heard a lot about this place and the zomato ratings also urged me to give this place a try. Featured in Thematic Ambience in zomato, this place will sweep you off your feet with the interior decorations. Upholding and uplifting the tribal cultures of India with statutes and paintings, it revives the tribal excellence, the traditions and practices as well as the tribal culinary. ¬†Since I had visited this place during the Durga Pujas, I had wait about an hour in the queue before getting a seat. This place is easy to find and located near the Anjali Jewellers shop. The tables are chairs have this authentic tribal look and the water was served in earthenware glasses. We had ordered Baansh Pora Chicken, Malayasian noodles, Jadoh and Shanghai Pepper Octopus. Jadoh is a delicacy from Meghalaya which comprises red rice and pieces of mutton . The Octopus was brilliantly cooked and worth the price. Also, the Malyasian noodles were perfect and definitely a must try for sea food lovers. The Baansh Pora chicken cooked in the Odisha style reminded of my visit to the Aracu Valley where I had tasted a similar delicacy with soft pieces of meat cooked inside a Bamboo. Overall this place provides a true experience of sea food and tribal culinary at affordable prices.

A pretty decent and well decorated place amidst the hustle and bustle of the busy golpark junction.  It is pretty well known for its seafood and the trial cuisine it offers. The place attracts a lot of crowd during the weekends and despite enough seating arrangements the waiting time is pretty high. I will recommend visiting it on a weekday because it is largely unoccupied then. 

Now coming to the food,  its pretty good and offers something new to relish. We had ordered Prawn Momos,  Bansa Pora Mutton and some Wild Red Rice to go with it. The Momos were not good and somewhat dry along the edges. The Bansa Pora Mutton was indeed a delicacy. Soft succulent pieces of meat cooked in a spicy marinade inside a bamboo.  The presentation was as good as the taste was. The red rice went perfectly with it.  We finished the meal off with Chemmen Kheer which was Prawn flavored Kheer. Although the combination sounds contrasting but somewhat it blends perfectly and was really very tasty. 

Overall a good experience.  Friendly courteous staff and a pretty decent service. Pocket pinch is above average. Will recommend.

As the name suggests "Santa's Fantasea" is a fantastic restaurant.It stands out because of the food it offers and that is what is needed after all from a restaurant.The ambience is good and so is the service.The place is pocket friendly and don't forget to try out "Bansa Pora Mutton/Chicken".Try out the various squid dishes.Only con is the fact that table booking is not available,so there is a healthy chance of you waiting outside on the road for a spot.Try it out without fail.

Had my first octopus here.
Staff is friendly, no issues at all. 
It is a place worth to visit not only a single time, but multiple times, if you crave fresh sea food, or want to taste the tribal exquisite dishes.

A trip to the most awaited place atlast. It is located in the road jst besides pc chandra in golpark.
The place is nicely decorate with some tribal cultural touch.
Comming to the food
1. Santa's fantasea special sea food soup- not value for money
2.crab meat momo- good size with tender crab fillings.
3.Teriyaki chicken- a bit spicy specially the gravy but its delicious
4.sea food salad- okayis. Tasted good for ample mayo but expected more prawn and squids
5. Jadoh-Tribal mutton biriyani...with smoky chunks of mutton
6.Dragon pepper chicken- less spicy but good
7.Malaysian sea food rice- Great ..

Also guys you should try the bamboo chicken...its also delicious and smoky.

Overall service was a bit lazy bt the quality of the food shadows all that

ITS A MUST TRY OUT !!

The ambiance was really good. Good for wallet if you share food (slightly overrated). Service is satisfactory and food is served within 10 minutes of placing the order.
The famous Banshe Pora Chicken was not so satisfactory for me. Rather, I'd prefer an Octopus dish and a Schezwan Squid dish. Both these are worth trying.
Onion Kheer is something you should try there atleast once.
Overall, it's worth visiting once or twice.
Cheers!

In the bylanes of golpark this restaurant is best for sea food cuisines..I had ordered soru chakli, bamboo chicken, Singapore Beijing noodles and crispy chilly prawn. I had heard about the banshpora chicken before and I was very keen on trying it but I was a little disappointed with it because i expected much better but the chilli prawn was out of the world..the noodles was equally awesome but the prawn was ravishing both look wise n taste wise and I am looking forward to visit this place again and try this particular dish..the service was good with a friendly environment and a bohemian and cool outlook...

Food was really good. I liked the interior a lot. We ordered bansh pora mutton, smoked octopus, soru chakli, jadoh and kori gassi. Each and every dish was tasty served hot and fresh. Mutton was so tender that it melted inside my mouth. Chicken was uniquely cooked as I ate green clred chicken for the fast tym. Loved the place. Will visit again for sure...

This was my first visit. First of all, very easy to locate. The decor of this place is quite refreshing. A very tribal vibe. Next, the service was very fast. Might be because we ordered as per their recommendations, since it's our first time. We ordered the Shanghai Squid, Jadoh rice and Arsa Chum. The Squid was spicy and bursting with flavours. The rice was rich too, with mutton pieces. Arsa Chum was a pleasant surprise, with very subtle flavour of lemon and gondhoraj leaves.

After 3 failed attempts through one & a half years and after almost all of my friends and family tried it and yelled awwed superlatives to me for the suggestion [and me sulking :( ] finally went there today to experience the hyped tribal and seafood cuisine. The decor is minimalist with tribal art and seafood ambience taking the centre of attention through the walls and props used. We went for lunch and ordered Shanghai Squid in starters and Baansh Pora Mutton & Soru Chaakli for mains. The squid was well cooked, crispy on the outside and juicy and chewy inside. Perfect to quench the hunger pangs yet retain enough appetite for the Main Course. Now comes the crown jewel, Baansh Pora Mutton, true to its name, was served in a bamboo shoot and it's out of the world. It's nothing like anything you've tasted before. The Soru-Chaakli was soft & succulent and provided a perfect foil to the meat. We ended our chomp-fest with Mango Sherbet Ice-Cream from London Dairy, and it was an experience worth every penny that we spent (it's light on the pocket as well). Don't miss this one. I'll not wait another year & a half for my next visit.

Well i heard about it so i though of visiting the golpark branch 

The experience was not good but not bad also

Good cuz the food is good specially the chilli mushrooms but bad cuz billing time
Serving time were like ages 

And they served the main course first then the starters believe me they did and the people down there were lousy 

Apart from good food(just by taste i donno about hr hygiene part though ) there is nothing special out there really

Finally after a long long wait I had dinner there. It was an amazing experience with such delicious food. The Soru Chuklis were perfectly baked, Crab Momos had every ingredients well balanced though the coating was little chewy. Fish in Oyster sauce with Basils and same dish with Octopus ware very delicious. And the signature dish Bans a Pora Mutton was very very well cook. Hoping to visit again soon.

Amazing little place with wonderful dining experience. Staffs are cordial and guides you to make the perfect choice of dishes. Generally crowded during special occassions like most hyped places, but the wait is worth the dining experience. The place serves both tribal and cuisine and seafood. One can dine with octopus, squid, tuna fish which one won't get at all places. The Banshpora chicken and mutton with soru chakli, lal gosht and seafood canton rice, teriyaki fish, baked fish, mongolian fish, seafood Malayasian rice are some of the dishes of my chocie. I would recommend all to visit the place with friends and fam. Will love to visit it many a times.

A 5point for its food and taste.  The interiors takes one to the rural feeling. There is so such seggregation of appetizers and maincourse as the menu is also tribal food based thus that category is not distinguished.  We started our meal with 
Bas pora mutton
Patro pora mutton 
Accompanied with shoru chakli r roti. 
My personal favourite was bas pora mutton as it has less number of chillis.  Patro pora is lil spicy. The roti is a very different one.  Super soft and white.
Then we ordered -
Malaysian rice with
Baked fish-which is bombey bhetkey
Honey and chilli prawn.  
Here i have to give a special mention on honey and chilli prawn as it was mindblowing and the malaysian rice just won our hearts.  Malaysian rice is with fish, prawn and squids and green in colour!  
Finally to end the meal we tried the -
tilhou kheer
Which is kheer with onion.  I have never had such a combination in my life but i took the risk and i dont regret it.  It is a must have.  There was another type of kheer with prawns which i hope to try the next time.  There are still many items in the menu which are unusual as well as appealing. They even have recipiea on tuna,  squids,  octopus,  horse mackerel other than the usual fish chicken and mutton. 
Hope to go back and try the other items.
P. S. - highly recommended place for quality food at very reasonable prices.

A homely, affordable seafood restaurant indeed. After having heard so much about this place I finally planned to visit it today and I was impressed. We had the sanghai squids for starters. It was really spicy and delicious. We had the teriyaki fish, burnt chilli octopus with the stick rice for the main course. I liked the fish a lot, the octopus was well cooked but while the gravy went well with the rice I found the octopus meat slightly bland. Also the stick rice is not what you usually expect, it was literally soggy fried rice that was served to us which was a let down. Nonetheless a great place to savour your seafood cravings.

My first visit. Visited on a weekday evening...and as expected the place was deserted and became the first customer of that evening. As entering, you  will feel the tribal ambience of that place...Nice n cosy.
Coming to the food part, ordered #shanghai_prawn and #crab_momo at first. And they were just heavenly. Every piece of prawn was making celebration inside my mouth I guess ;) so does the crab momo spicy n awesome.
#Fried_spring_pomfret was good. And #seafood_malaysian_rice was ok too.
But another master piece was #smoked_fish. The fish was super tender and well cooked.
Overall the feast was super hit and very pocket friendly too. Will surely visit again n again.

I have been there for several times . Also have tasted numerous items,so wont go for the details. Just willing to be focused on tribal stuffs, specially Bansh pora part ,the signature dish of fantasea, where the shredded chickens were put inside the bamboo. It will give you the flavour of smoked bamboo. Omg I was just blown away after having it.

Would have definitely given a 5 star for this place with a deep tribal essence in it's menu, as well as the taste.
Bansa Pora Mutton (Orissa's delicacy) is one of the finest indian preparations one could find! This place does a proper justice to it.! A proper balance of spices, good quality mutton, cooked to an even tender. The bamboo flavour reveals itself after a few bites, and this dish gives proves to be one the most outstanding preparations in a while! A 5 for the dish!
On the other hand, the smoked prawns, cooked in a chilly garlic gravy, with a little bit of lemon grass and other herbs, made us explore another flavourish ride with the sea food. Prawns & herbs used were fresh. A 5 for the dish!
Chemeen kheer (prawn kheer) was a no show. Chopped prawns in a khoya like dessert doesn't make sense on the first look. The taste of the sweet khoya and prawns don't seem to fit together in a single dish. A 2 for the dish!
This place is highly recommended for every sea & tribal food lovers and those who want to explore!

Wow! That's what I must say. I heard about this place for sometime and was wishing to have a taste here...so last Sunday finally we paid a visit to this place and I am really satisfied. We ordered bash pora mutton, crab momo, julu pitha, mandarian rice and honey chilli squid. 
The bashpora mutton is just awesome...the mutton is cooked so well and the smokey flavor from the burnt bamboo enriched the flavor.
Crab momo was also really nice.
Julu pitha was good but a little dry.otherwise it was nice.
The mandarian rice was really good...the prawn and squid in it was perfectly cooked and the flavor was really nice.
The honey chilli squid was also really good...not so much sweet not so much spicy perfect balance.
All in all it was really nice experience. I am willing to go again and try some other dishes.

I wish there was a negative marking.There were rats in the dining area happily moving around.And when I complain , they very simply say that they are also facing problem and do not know how to handle this.

I SAY SHUT DOWN TILL YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE RATS  AND RODENTS IN THE DINING AREA  !!!!

The food they had served tasted good I should say but given the hygiene who would want to go have good food and fall sick???
service was not great.waiters were callous.didnt even serve the starter on time. with main course only they served the starters and when I enquired such strange service i was told aince everything was ready we just served or else it will be cold. like we cant make one by one.we will prepare things altogether and its upto ypu how to have.It was an awful experience. I urge people not to go there.Just to make profit they cant have a place with rodents functional

I am not much into experimenting with cuisines. However, I went on a double date with a close couple and was not disappointed with this restaurant at all. Even though the outlet is small, the decoration is quirky and goes with the kind of food they serve - tribal and seafood. We ordered Bansh Pora Chicken, the star dish of the place as I was told, and Sticky Red Rice to go with it, A Crab Momo, and Shanghai Squid. All the dishes except Bansh Pora Chicken were pretty good, even though they were a bit spicy. Among these, I loved Shanghai Squid the most. The portions were filling, and the prices were reasonable. The service was prompt as well. Overall, I would totally recommend the place for people willing to try something new!

We had heard a lot about this place from our friends in Kolkata, and was thinking to visit Santa's Fantasea for long time. During the Christmas holiday in Kolkata, I had tried this restaurant for lunch. It was a working day, and we went bit early (around 12:30 PM). The place was almost empty, but it got almost full when we were leaving the place. If a restaurant is full during weekdays, it shows the popularity.

The decor was very cool and funky. It's a house that was converted to restaurant. The seating capacity was of around 80 pax approx. The walls were decorated by motifs of tribal culture. I loved the decor, and clicked loads of photos (but sad, I lost all the photos as I had to format the phone).

We ordered Bnashpora mutton and Jadoh. In both the dishes, the mutton was undercooked. Taste-wise, both were unique. I had had bamboo chicken earlier also (Bnashpora chicken is called Bamboo Chicken and prepared by tribals of Orissa-Andhra border; it is a delicacy in Araku valley), this version is slightly different. Jadoh was good in taste too. But both the dishes were spoiled as the mutton was undercooked and hard.

Overall, I think, it was not a very good experience. The basic premise of a good restaurant is good food, which was not so in this case.

This nice little joint is really a bit hard to find. It's in a small lane near Golpark and for the first timers I would suggest using Google maps for ease. I have been to this place twice and both times we were greeted by a very nice, smiling waiter offering us Tankha Turani, a tribal drink from Orissa, which is basically spiced water from mildly fermented rice. Believe me, on a scorching summer's day this can be a bliss. First time we went there, ¬†we had ordered Bansha Pora mutton with Soru Chakli, and I knew instantly that I would come to this bistro everyday for a piece of that meat. Next we had ordered Shanghai squid just to have a taste of their sea food delicacies. I must admit that the squid was a little bit under cooked but the flavors of the sauce compensated well.Next time I went to this place, was almost a year later and nothing had changed. Not the smiling waiter, not the ambiance and definitely not their quality of food. This time we were a group of 6, so along with the quintessential Bansha Pora and Soru Chakli, we also ordered Jadoh, a Meghalayan rice, Baked fish, burnt chilly octopus and seafood canton rice. Jadoh was really exotic. It was tremendously spicy and went well with the subtle flavors of Bansha pora. The seafood canton rice and burnt chilly octopus were pretty routine oriental dishes and this time around the squids and octopuses were cooked to perfection. But everything that took my breath away was the baked fish. It was creamy, it was cheesy and the fish was so luxuriously soft, almost velvety. I was surprised to see that even after being baked with loads of cream and cheese, the fish had managed to hold its body. It was really an experience of a lifetime and I must urge everyone to visit this joint at once, if you haven't yet. My pick of dishes will most definitely be Bansha Pora, Soru Chakli, Baked Fish

This is one of the finest restaurants for good seafood.
I have tried their signature Baansh pora chicken which tastes great.The smokey flavour is strong and it is spicy.
The seafood rice and noodles are my all time favourite.
For mains,I tried their butter garlic fish,Shanghai squid,oyster squid,dragon pepper fish,Oyster chilli basil octopus,Chakli roti etc.
The butter garlic preparation is non spicy and tastes yummy.
The dragon pepper base is too spicy.
Oyster chilli basil tastes great in both octopus and squid preparation.
Also,their signature chemeen(prawn) kheer is totally lip smacking.
I would suggest them to introduce drinks in their menu.
The interiors are beautiful and the newer version is more spacious.
Staffs are very well mannered.
They levy only GST on their food.

Food: 4.5 .Ambience: 4 .
Decor: 4.5 .Service: 3.5.Location:3.5.

Being one of the few dedicated sea-food joints in Kolkata, Santa's Fantasea has come up with a Tribal Taste in their menu as they offer a delightful combination of the two extremities- Tribal Cuisine along with Seafood.First thing first- it is not difficult to locate (neither too easy for the first timers). Follow the lane beside Anjali Jewellers, you will find it to your left. Don't get deceived looking at their entrance-they do provide a good capacity along with fine ambience and good decorations. You may feel like being at a tribal village or a small restaurant on the beach...

People who were there for taking orders and serving the food was quite helpful as they suggested us what might be a good order. Yes, Bansa Pora Mutton was quite an obvious choice (we asked for chicken and they suggested mutton which I don't regret at all). A Tribal dish from Odisha, Bansa Pora Mutton comes in between a pair of burnt bamboo pieces. One can feel the taste of a truly tribal dish.Soru Chakli complements it well. Categorized as a tribal bread,Soru Chakli is probably the softest roti (leave Romali Roti apart) I have ever tasted.One may feel a bit overpriced given the size of a Soru Chakli..

Coming to the Seafood cuisine, we ordered for Shanghai Squid as a starter. Both quantity and quality was good enough. That gave an idea of how good other sea foods dishes are at the restaurant. Next time round I will definitely try for an Octopus!!!¬†On the whole a good food joint. Prices can be lowered a little bit. Probably ideal for a evening bite not to sure about a dinner..

4.2 probably the best rating.

I have been to this restaurant five times and tried a huge number of dishes here.
This is one of the finest restaurants for good seafood.
I have tried their signature Baansh pora chicken which tastes great.The smokey flavour is strong and it is spicy.
The seafood rice and noodles are my all time favourite.
For mains,I tried their butter garlic fish,Shanghai squid,oyster squid,dragon pepper fish,Oyster chilli basil octopus,Chakli roti etc.
The butter garlic preparation is non spicy and tastes yummy.
The dragon pepper base is too spicy.
Oyster chilli basil tastes great in both octopus and squid preparation.
Also,their signature chemeen(prawn) kheer is totally lip smacking.
I would suggest them to introduce drinks in their menu.
The interiors are beautiful and the newer version is more spacious.
Staffs are very well mannered.
They levy only GST on their food.

Food: 4.5 .Ambience: 4 .
Decor: 4.5 .Service: 3.5.Location:3.5.

Being one of the few dedicated sea-food joints in Kolkata, Santa's Fantasea has come up with a Tribal Taste in their menu as they offer a delightful combination of the two extremities- Tribal Cuisine along with Seafood.First thing first- it is not difficult to locate (neither too easy for the first timers). Follow the lane beside Anjali Jewellers, you will find it to your left. Don't get deceived looking at their entrance-they do provide a good capacity along with fine ambience and good decorations. You may feel like being at a tribal village or a small restaurant on the beach...

People who were there for taking orders and serving the food was quite helpful as they suggested us what might be a good order. Yes, Bansa Pora Mutton was quite an obvious choice (we asked for chicken and they suggested mutton which I don't regret at all). A Tribal dish from Odisha, Bansa Pora Mutton comes in between a pair of burnt bamboo pieces. One can feel the taste of a truly tribal dish.Soru Chakli complements it well. Categorized as a tribal bread,Soru Chakli is probably the softest roti (leave Romali Roti apart) I have ever tasted.One may feel a bit overpriced given the size of a Soru Chakli..

Coming to the Seafood cuisine, we ordered for Shanghai Squid as a starter. Both quantity and quality was good enough. That gave an idea of how good other sea foods dishes are at the restaurant. Next time round I will definitely try for an Octopus!!!¬†On the whole a good food joint. Prices can be lowered a little bit. Probably ideal for a evening bite not to sure about a dinner..

4.2 probably the best rating.

Foods are good but the staff are rude, lacks manner and knows little hospitality. They dont care if you are pleased with the food and environment or not. Giving it 1.5 as good sea food, otherwise would give 0. Will never go back there again.

Had a fantastic tribal and seafood culinary adventure with Utsav Mukherjee. Ordered#saruchakli and #banshpora mutton in starter then continued with seafood Malaysian rice and oyster chilli basil octopus! Was a great experience... Would love to explore more. Decor and ambience were perfect to tease your appetite mood!

I have visited at th golpark outlet last week. Location is very easy to find. Decorated wall with underwater world nd another part with trivial region will surely increase your excitement. Service was very good nd foods were no doubt delicious. You will get the unique trivial nd seafood in very reasonable price. I hv tried octopus nd squid 1st time.. Really gd in taste .. Food lovers should try it.

This place is located in Golpark near the Anjali Jewellers store. The lane adjacent to the jewellery store will lead you to this food joint. It might get a little tricky for first-timers and hence, resort to Google Maps if necessary.

We were served a complimentary drink in a bamboo glass. It was a tribal drink which was not very pleasing to the palate.

We had ordered Soru¬†Chakli
, Bansa¬†Pora¬†Chicken, Smoked Octopus, Seafood Malaysian Rice. The Bansa¬†Pora is kind of a signature dish of this bistro. Hence, no-one misses it if they visit this place. The Bansa¬†Pora dishes are really exquisite. The Chicken had strong flavours. I had tried the Mutton Bansa¬†Pora previously and that was even better. The Soru Chakli is a special type of bread made with egg and wheat and it supplemented the Bansa Pora really well. The Smoked Octupus¬†was a superb dish with rich taste and strong aroma. A highly recommended dish. The Malaysian rice was extremely delicious too.

On my previous visit, I had tried Teriyaki Chicken, Wild Red Rice, Bansa¬†Pora Mutton, Kori Gassi and all were good. The staff is courteous and service is prompt too. I am looking forward to visiting this place again.

Visited there after hearing so much positive review.. Now its time for my review :-
FOOD ORDERED- 2plate bash pora chicken, 3 plate mixed rice, 2plate gravy chicken dish (names i dnt remember, properly)
REVIEW- Bash pora chicken was worst, trust me its worst.. I dnt know how people love it so much.. Rice and gravy chicken dishes was good, no complaints regarding that. Basically am totally disappointed with bash pora chicken.. Last thing i want add that i didnt try any sea food so can't comment on them.
SHOULD I VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN? Probably not. Didnt match my expectations.

Okay,so I have been here yesterday for the second time and we had ordered Sticky Rice,Banshpora Chicken and Jhupupishi's Mutton and a baby corn mushroom dish for starter.Its the sticky rice and the chicken prep which I feel the speciality of this house but the mutton dish is overrated I guess.Its nothing but a normal mutton dish and I wouldn't like to have it for the next time as, to me, the prep turned out to be quite common.Else everything is good.

This was a place i was looking forward to visiting for a long time, and finally, went there in December last year. In fact, i took all my cousins there, as a birthday treat, as this happened to be one of the most popular places in south kolkata.

Major disappointment.

We ordered almost all the famous dishes they make: and except for zulu pitha, each one of the tribal fare was a let down. 

Bansh pora mutton tasted like it was 'koshano' in a typical kadhai, and just served inside a pre-burnt bamboo for purposes of presentation and not taste.

And if that was bad, Bansh pora chicken was just horrible. I think of 'pora mangsho' and mouth watering visuals of roasted crispy chicken (with some charring here n there) pop up in my mind. What we got on the plate was this cooked (not roasted) small pieces of evenly brown weirdly spiced chicken. If i was starving, or if the cooking at my house was terrible, I would have liked it, but neither was/is the case, and all of it was made worse by the high expectations we had of this place.

Moving on, 

Jhupu pishi's mutton dish: One of my Bhai-s ordered it, and i had to finish it because he wouldn't. If I didn't pay for it, and wasn't much about not wasting food, I wouldn't have finished it either. 

Jado rice: was basically mangsher jhol e makha bhat. Albeit more spicy. Decent, but nothing like the hype.

Soru chakli : this stretchy rubbery bread. Two pieces they gave stuck to each other, and i basically felt like eating some form of 'gola ruti'. 

I did like the zulu pitha though, and the red colored chutney/sauce kinda thing they gave with it ( i think it came with the pitha. We ordered too many things! ) . 

Thinking the sea food would spare better, we ordered a bunch of those. Obviously being my birthday treat, my cousins ordered more of the expensive stuff ( üòÑ ). Fortunately, some of them were actually very good. (Thank heavens!) Case in point: Schezwan Octopus. But some, like the green colored (Malaysian was it called?) rice and noodles was plain n simple yuck! It tasted as if someone fried the noodles in mustard oil and then poured on it a bowl of cold coriander chutney that had been sitting in the fridge for two weeks. And if you think that was bad ( I repeat my rhetoric again), the worst was yet to come:

Bamboo shoot prawn!

This costs 320 (without tax) for 5 prawns in a gooey uncooked disgustingly sour n salty tasting broth of bamboo stems n some leafy things (and this is coming from a very typical 'Bangal' who loves his vegetables). This was, undoubtedly, the worst thing we had that day. 

Overall, the only saving grace from the entire evening was the Zulu Pitha from our Tribal fare, and the Shanghai Pepper Octopus from the seafood one. The later one tasted especially good: Sweet, salty n sour chunks of octopus covered in a thick red sauce! It reminded me of our Goa trip the earlier month, and after an evening full of gastronomic flops, at least one thing I could take away as a happy memory. 

To conclude, I really hope this was just a one-off incident, and the food there isn't really that bad, that the chef maybe was having a bad day controlling the kitchen or something, and on other days, their food does live up to all the hype this place has.

Presentation was awesome in bamboo ... Next we ordered seafood Beijing rice and dragon pepper squid ... Didn't expected octopus and squid will be so tasty ...

Nothing tastes better than exotic fooding. And Santa's Fantasea does delivery what they promise, mouth watering food in Budget (not cheap though). The staff here are really polite and well mannered and I loved there decor, which was simple yet delightful to the eye.
Only crunch is the waiting time and prices (which is shadowed by the meal taste).This restaurant offers something different by way of cuisine, and so is unique in Kolkata

One of my recent favourite places to eat! A cute little place, with obvious care having gone into the design and decor. Even the salt and pepper shakers on the tables are in keeping with the tribal theme! Such attention to detail is refreshing and makes for a wonderful experience. The same is also reflected in their food. Their menu concentrates on a few things, and executes them really well. The Bansh Pora mutton dish is absolutely delicious! Tender meat,wonderful mild smoky flavour.Though the chicken version of the same dish is about 100 bucks cheaper, I would still recommend going for the mutton as it is a much better preparation. The amount could be increased though. 
Main dishes- their wild red rice(Jadoh) is incredible, was not expecting rice to pack such a strong punch of flavor. 
Their spicy squid is really well cooked, and so is their octopus. There are not too many joints which can claim that.
Their mixed seafood fried rice and noodles (I'd sampled the Beijing) is also delicious - all the seafood being cooked really well.  Their main dishes come in huge quantities too, enough for 3-4 people,unlike the Bansh Pora mutton. 
I've been to this place a couple of times and can't wait to go again!

Our late night extravaganza in South Kolkata emded up here. We were in total of 5 persons in a chevy beat roaming around to catch up a place for dinner. It was already 10.20pm when we checked in they were scheduled to close by 10.30pm but they were cordial enough to accommodate us. We ordered tangy chicken... Bans pora chicken (this is their signature dish) and 3 varities of chowmein. Order was quick and the staff friendly too... We finished our dinner by 11pm so it was super quick. 
Lets come back to the food.. The food was tasty specially liked the banspora chicken..

I had a long desire to go this place because of the variety of seafoods (especially octopus) they provide. Finally this Thursday I went to Santas's Fantasea. As I said before they provide a wide variety of seafoods and tribal dishes. I ordered Smoked octopus, Bansh pora Chicken and Seafood Beijing Rice. All the three dishes I ordered really taste great especially the smoked octopus. I tried octopus for the first time and had no idea that it can taste so yummy..
The staffs are well behaved and friendly. The restaurant is well decorated with the tribal theme. The ambiance is also good.¬†
Its worth going to have some delicious seafood and tribal dishes.
I so loved it.

My opinion:
1. They must serve vinegar onion with bashpora chicken and mutton.  
2. London diary ice cream is very disappointing.  Amul or metro is better.  It was served while it was half melted and inside was full of ice . I think it was an old stock.
Better after having food better u have ice cream outside!!!

The place was really nice..full on tribal feeling..
Hut kind of restaurant..even too the glasses were like that ... the service was good enough..not bad..

It was good and trying something new was also really exciting !! Hope to come here again üòÖ

A wide variety of seafood and tribal food is available for choice. A very well diversified mini is always a plus point. Food quality is even appreciated. 
I ordered for Smoked Octopus, Burnt Chilly Prawn, Seafood Beijing Rice and Onion Kheer. All the preparations were great but I felt the oil used could be a little bit less. Otherwise the taste seemed quite satisfactory.
Coming to the service part.... I entered the restaurant as soon as it opened at 6 pm. There was only one server I could see and he just showed us the table in front of him and was busy swiping his mobile phone. I felt a bit ignored about that and hence I could not proceed for one more star.
The ambience is not really matched with the theme.. Kind of too many things put together. And moreover using incense sticks inside the restaurant for whatever reason is just not done. While entertaining the restaurant the smell desired is of light food and drinks. 
You all should pay a visit to relish the food.
Happy Eating!!

Now this place finally got ticked off from my wish list, after so many attempts of trying to visit them. Yes these attempts were worth it. 
They remain closed for couple of hours after lunch time, hence we went in an empty restaurant at 6pm today. This was a bit difficult to locate but we managed to find it, which was right beside the lane of Anjali jewellers in golpark. Coming to the decor and theme, it was really appealing with all those sea creatures and tribal style seats, tables. They have a lot of seating capacity, as there are three rooms which make up the restaurant area.
We ordered Beijing style seafood rice, smoked octopus and burnt chilly prawn, for the dessert we ordered onion kheer. 
So the rice was really good with lots of seafood and vegetables, flavored beautifully with pan asian spices. The smoked octopus was very delicately made in flavorsome gravy with lemongrass and lime leaves, burnt chilly prawn was equally good but the prawn needed to be cooked a bit longer according to me. The kheer was a really innovative idea, they also have prawn kheer but we opted for the onion one. It tasted so good with the onions in it, it felt like we were having some shahi dessert. 
Service was fast and servers were suggestive, but there was a lack of serving attitude and they were reluctant to serve us when we went in first, maybe because it was odd hours for them. But again if the restaurant is open you should have that proper motivation to serve your guests, this would be a suggestion for the management. 
All in all the food, ambiance uplifted my friend's and also my mood for the evening. Great food quality and quantity!

Not worth of spending 2000 for lunch..
Staffs behavior is worse than food.
Momos we order were served cold and completely hard. Octopus was not upto mark.
When i told the waiter to change the momo he just denied to do so..!!!!
Even they don't have little courtesy to  apology for the bad food and service.
Definitely one of those place which is not recommend for others unless enemies...!!

Santa's Fantasea has given me my first tribal food and seafood experience. Like many others visiting this place had been in my bucket list for a long time. I liked their seating arrangements i.e., on unique wooden chairs and tables. Ambience is satisfactory.
We had ordered:-
1. Bansh Pora Chicken (Odisha)- a delicious smoke flavoured chicken is served on a bamboo. I haven't tasted such an amazing and tasty dish lately. A moreish dish to start with.
2. Jadoh (tribal rice) - this brown coloured rice is a combination of unique flavours and has pieces of mutton in it. Taste wise it is brilliant.
3. Seafood beijing rice- It had squid, prawns and veggies in it. The taste was okayish.
4. Malasian rice- to my surprise it was green coloured rice, with all squid, octopus and prawns. I liked it.
5. Dragon Chicken- a spicy, colourful and flavourful preparation. 
6. Teriyaki Chicken- It was also good. 
This place should be visited by everyone. They also have a wide range of dishes available here. So, if anyone wants to taste tribal and seafood they must visit to Santa's Fantasea.

Santa's Fantasea is a tiny restaurant located on a Lane near Anjali Jewelers in Golpark, and is truly a hidden gem. The restaurant is decorated in coordination with the cuisine, ie. seafood and tribal food. The quality and quantity of the food was really good. The service was fast and the total ambience was quite satisfactory. It's a must try for all the foodies in town.

This ¬†has become one of the most trending places of the town. We visited the Golpark outlet. The restaurant is not that big and it's more like a house converted to a restaurant. So the ambiance remains a so so. But where the restaurant differentiates itself from others is the Food and that is what matters. Based on recommendations and positive word of mouth, we ordered Bans pora chicken, Mizoram rice and a baby corn-mushroom dish. The food was fresh, cooked properly and satisfied my tummy to the level which will make me come back to the place very soon. The service is good and waiters are well-behaved. So thumbs up from my side. 3.5 is just because of the interior or else it has the potential to be a 4 or 4.5.

We went on Valentine's Day with our friends.. First I would like to start with the decor, it was a clumsy place and the a.c was not working. We asked them to change the place but after so much of request they changed the place which was all the more worst. Then coming to the food- after waiting for 50 mins the starter was served with the main course. The whole lot of food was served cold. The staff behaviour was very rude. It was overall a hilarious experience on such a day...

We ordered beijing seafood noodles,malasiyan noodles as well as the rice,bans pora mutton,wild rice and smokey octopus.
Among all i liked the octopus the most. They literally serve you the best octopus dishes of all time.
You can also get lobster and crab dishes right here.
If you are looking for a not so fancy diner but awesome food then this place is a must visit. Wish to visit it soon again.

After seeing the popularity of the restaurant, the craze for seafood & tribal cuisine, specially the bansa pora mutton I had wish to eat here & finally visited with a friend today.

Address: 9, bullygunge terrace, near Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. It's easy to find.

This is a small outlet, which can accommodate around 30 people, I think & is always almost full. Getting our seats we immediately ordered

1) Crab momo fried: It was ok as a starter, but wasn't delicious as I had expected it to be.
Rating - 3/5

2) Bansa pora mutton: I came here specially to try this one, hearing about it so much & it didn't disappoint me. I never had mutton that tender before & I really liked the smoky flavor. Rating - 4.5/5

3) Wild red rice: It was delicious too. Though both the items were dry, it went well with the mutton. Raing - 4/5

I really liked their nice & simple thematic ambience. Food was good, pricing is ok, it was a good deal having that great meal at just 800 bucks, the staffs were friendly as well. All in all, it was a good experience. I will be coming back here for sure to try their seafood.

Santa's Fantasea is one of the really good sea food restaurant you can find in Kolkata. I went there one evening with my brother and a friend and we really enjoyed the thematic ambiance of tribal homes.
We ordered Smoked Squid as starter which was really delicious, and if you are having Sea food for the first time this will make you fall in love with it. :)
For the main course we ordered Bamboo Shoot Octopus and a tribal rice. Now you must note one thing, if you are not well acquainted with sea food then do order something spicy. I did liked that bamboo shoot octopus but my friend didn't. So while you order I would suggest you to ask the waiter about its taste.
Leaving that apart it was worthy visiting Santa's Fantasea. And I would love it visit it again.

0.5 is deducted for scope of improvement. One of the greatest joint for seafood. Tuna and octopus is rarely available in the best of the restaurant in Kolkata and that at a very very affordable price and that too at great quality is a very tall task. The answer to this is Santa's fantasy. Great ambience coupled with beautiful decorated spray painting of tribal India. One must try the wild red rice, the best rice I ever had.

After reading such good reviews about this place, I really wanted to try their tribal cuisine - bansa pora mutton - it was amazing. It was so flavorful - it was rightly spiced and the charcoal flavor was extraordinary. The mutton was perfectly cooked and very tender. The server suggested to order soru chakli (their special roti made with maida batter) to go with the mutton. It was good but it was a very small and thin roti, it doesn't fill you up. 30 bucks for one roti is too expensive. 
We also ordered seafood lung fung soup which was hearty. It was filled with good amount of seafood like crab, squid and shrimp. The crab momo was highly recommended in the reviews but I did not like it at all. They used crab stick or imitation crab meat as the filling which I did not expect - it was totally bland. 
We also ordered chili wine octopus and seafood canton noodles - both the dishes were good.

Seafood Revolution. 
Good for your soul, and your fantasies, so is it healthy for your pocket. 
A small place, which otherwise was difficult to locate in the residential locality, has made a nich√® for itself, in the world of seafood. 
Coming to food, had tried prawn momo, smoked prawn, malaysian rice. 
Prawn momo, had chunks of prawn in it, not  evenly chopped. And the momo was soggy. Not exactly, what a momo lover would want to have. 
Smoked prawn, good quality and good quantity served. The gravy was rightly balanced with tangyness and hint of smoke. But, it has some lemongrass or somekind of shoot, which is inedible, so it would be better if it is removed before,  dish is served. 
The malaysian rice, was made with spinach, so had green tint. Otherwise, great in taste  
Service is fast, smooth and courteous.

After hearing a lot about this restaurant,we finally decided to pay a visit to this place(mainly to try octopus for the first time)!And yes we aren't disappointed at all :)
We were welcomed with a tribal welcome drink which I Personally didn't like!
We tried the following items-
1)soru chakli
2)bansa pora chicken
3)smoked octopus
4) Seafood Malaysian rice
The bansa pora chicken is really nice! It has a highly smoky flavour (near pungent) so much so that we had to order soft drinks after having it!Soru chakli which is a thin maida and egg chapatti complemented it really well! My friend told me that the bansa pora mutton is even better...
Coming to seafood,the smoked octopus taken on the waiter's recommendation is the best octopus dish for beginners(with octopus)!The Malaysian seafood rice is amazing!!! Full marks to this dish!
Service is quick and staff courteous!
One such good restaurant with a unique cuisine where everyone must pay a visit to!I am definitely coming back to try the bansa pora mutton and see if it's really better than its chicken counterpart!

I loved the 'tribal' interior, the wall art, the tables, the chairs, the glass everything... Moreover I loved d food. We ordered soru chakli, bansha pora mutton and chicken both. We also tried fried tuna and king fish. Every dish awesome.. let me think, ok d king fish was less awesome as my maa didn't like it much but that couldn't stop me from loving d place. The only bad thing is they have completed one year, so have started adding up taxes. Damn

Crab momo was good. Soru chakli was nothing special. Malaysian seafood rice was very good. Chicken and tuna were good as well. The tilhou kheer was awesome. Never even imagined that onion can taste this good in the form of dessert. All-over a good experience. Would love to visit again. But we're told that they don't charge tax, but we had to pay tax also.

well unlike the thousands that rave about the food here.I have to tell their claim of serving tribal food is an absolute disaster. The authenticity is pure 0.
Having tasted sikkimese as well as naga cuisine from the den. The food they serve do taste descent but its absolutely different to the original cuisine. I hated the baans pora as i noticed the same bamboo used for serving various people and instantly knew that they were using ¬†a short cut to prepare as the bamboo loses its effect after using it twice. The taste was too charcoalish for me!

The rip off was the gassi! oh my god i have never seen such oblivious attitude ever! they gave me a chinese green synthetic coloured dish for a mangalorean gassi and they are teaching a south indian about how it is the real thing , the moment they came to know that i am from Bangalore , the server went inside to call the chef but never came back!! Pathetic!
The chineese was good but that is not their USP as there are millions of chinese joints in the city. Sad to see so many people raving about it . Good food is separate but if you are going to endorse a regional cuisine and not serve it the authentic way then whats the point!¬†By the way , the green color of the gassi seriously gave me stomach issues as i saw super green looking poop the next morning! I have shared the pic of the gassi.

Went today for lunch. We had been there many times before and love their collection of seafood dishes, especially Malaysian Seafood Rice, Seafood Salad, Smoked Squid and Chemmen Kheer. Quality wise, today's lunch was very satisfying.
But they had changed their price rules and did not bother notifying customers regarding the same and no mention in the menu either. From previous experience we knew that their prices as displayed in the menu was inclusive of taxes and also that they only accept cash towards payment. So was surprised when the bill came and displayed additional Service Tax and VAT, increasing the bill amount by atleast 22%. As they do not accept card, it would have been a real jam if we were not carrying extra cash and cash wasnt available in the nearby ATMs as is the trend now.¬†
Very poor and harrowing experience and a real trying one at that and not at all expected from Fantasea. We had been there maybe a month back and that time too, the prices were inclusive taxes and their menu doesn't say anything about taxes being extra.¬†
Taxes are a part of our life and no one bothers about them.. but this lack of transparency and misleading customers (and regular ones at that) says volumes regarding customer service practices at Fantasea.

Banspora Chicken: a delicious chicken item, cooked in Bamboo, enriched with the flavour of bamboo is a must try here. 
Wild Red Rice: A perfect blend of masala and rice, giving it a unique taste! 
Smoked Prawn: soft juicy prawns cooked in a red gravy with lemon leaves will give goosebumps to your tastebuds.

These small food joints coming up in nooks and corners of kolkata are surprise packages wrapped in not so alluring covers. When you see it from outside, it is a real small one leading to seating arrangments divided in  four chambers. The first part is underwater themed followed by tribal themed chambers. As suggested by  prior visitors 'baansh pora' mutton topped my wishlist. As they brought in the burnt bamboo , the aroma of smoked mutton increased my hunger. It was combined well with very soft and simple shoru chakli. We could not resist to taste the sea food menu. Beijing rice with honey chilli fish satisfied our taste buds. Rather it tasted even better in comparison  to the tribal dishes. Sorry, I forgot to click pictures of all the dishes as i digged in as soon as they were served.

Santa‚Äôs Fantasea is famous for its seafood. Let‚Äôs see what the restaurant has in store for us:. The place is located in a small lane band opposite to Ramkrishna Mission, Golpark in the lane beside Anjali Jewellers. It‚Äôs a little problematic to find especially as it‚Äôs there in the lane and not on the main road. I have to tell you this that I went to tuitions for two years straight but have hardly noticed people there. The place is¬†not exactly visible. It seems like an ordinary house.
                                                                ...

Santa's Fantasea offers you lots of delicious food. I have had the bansa pora mangsho(mutton) before it was really tasty. Yesterday my uncle got bansa pora chicken which was super yummy.The smoky flavor and the ¬†well cooked chicken with ¬†the masala was smashing. I had it with the plain rice and also with the shoroo chakli which tasted out of this world. Also had the kerala mutton soup..it was mild and the aroma of the gondoraj leboo was a delight. Will be trying out the other items soon.

Seafood something which is not generally everyone's favourite is their speciality. I also previously hesitated to try out the seafood but actually it was really good. The burnt chilly octopus was my favourite from their menu. Looking forward to try out other octopus and squid dishes from their menu. A genuine break from the cliche mughlai or Chinese or Indian cuisine. Loved to try out something different.

Dishes curated from the coastal tribes of India. Places like such are innovational geniuses and show their strategical braveness. Places as such delight you to the core with simply their concepts of existence. The food is now doubt good and the menu boasts over a cultural diversity. However, I suggest the management takes not of the recent imbalance of the food quality and maintain a standard taste.

Santa's fantasea is a well known restaurant in south kolkata. They serve mainly tribal and seafood dishes but also serve few chinese dishes(though we did not taste) we went there on 9th april 2016 to celebrate my birthday. It is in the adjacent lane of golpark anjali jwellers.. its a small place eith two rooms.. but fully packed with customers.. as we were two they provide us a two seter table but it was very close to thw washroom and kitchen. So we asked to change our table. They provide us a two seater table immediately in the seafood section... we asked for a four aeater table as the 2 seater us much small to accomodate they told that they can not provide that as it was a rush time. Never mind. We ordered their famous bansa pora chicken and wild red rice.. the waiter over there suggested us to take some side dish and he recommended to try kori gassi.. after few minutes our order were served. They looked yummy. When we tried it was just awesome.. but the chicken pieces in kori gassi is like the same chicken ball used in chinese dishes. One can easily enjoy the tribal rice and bansa pora chicken ..

Nice,small and cosy place to eat... It's a bit inside an alley, so a bit hard to find... bansh pora chicken was awesome bt was disappointed with the octopus... It was the first time I had one, expected something delicious BT tasted like a spiced rubber!!!! Don't know whether it tastes like that or the restaurant's fault... Bt the main turnoff of this place is it's menu... There is no variety in the menu... The preparations were same.. only 4 types of preparation for crabs, squids, octopus, etc... I would recommend another restaurant for this price tag, if not someone wants to try out seafood...

The very popular, Baansh pora mutton - served in a bamboo (bnaash) . It has bite size pieces of mutton, smoked and cooked with mild flavors. The Smokey flavor was a tad too much, wasn't my type of dish. But it is much appreciated.
Service is good

I heard about this restaurant quite a few times from my friends and zomato friends of course. They have touted a lot and that‚Äôs the reason finally I went to this outlet last Friday. Well the location is easy to find out- Anjali jewellers, Golpark and you‚Äôd be good to go. Before coming to the Food let me tell you that the restaurant is not as spacious as I thought. It‚Äôs rather small underneath a building, probably a rented place. Anyway the atmosphere will make you feel comfortable or rather a homely feel. For couples and a small family dine in it would be okay but in festival time I guess it will be hard to grab a seat inside.
Anyway without a further ado let‚Äôs talk about food. Well the food is the thing here outweighs all the bummer I‚Äôve mentioned so far. Thanks to Zomato reviewers for their time. I tried Shanghai squid for the starter and guess what it‚Äôs worth every penny. The item is lip-smacking. You‚Äôll taste a sweet and spice combo. Seriously one would carve for more starter than the actual dish. I decided to order for the sea food only. Took Malaysian rice with smoked octopus. 
The green rice full of squids and prawn- adds more richness to your taste bud.  Well for the octopus it was my 1st time and to be frank I was excited. Yeah it felt different and octopus got a kind of taste that does not resemble with anything. We thoroughly enjoyed the new food but once again the squid stole the show for it(. Nevertheless the entire package was delicious. And most importantly at the end it‚Äôll not burn a hole into your pocket. I recommend everyone to pay a visit at least for once. It was my birthday treat to my girlfriend and we‚Äôve made our mind to visit them again in couple of weeks.

Located in golpark , the lane beside anjali jewellers , this themed restaurant is the new craze of south kolkata. The ambience is quirky and nice. We sat in the tribal section and started our dinner with sanghai squid. This was definitely the best among all. Perfectly made , with good proportion of spice , this dish was lip-smacking ! Next we ordered their famous baansh pora mutton with shoru chakli. This was definitely innovative and great to taste ! But mutton could be a little more spicy I felt. Chakli was soft , perfectly complemented the mutton. Next for dessert we ordered prawn kheer which was again heaven . Too good to taste . Definitely I would visit again to try rest of their innovative dishes .

Well, this one is topping my list of next visits. Located in Golpark, this is an excellent joint for Tribal Food.Bansa¬†Pora Mutton,Bansa¬†¬†Pora Chicken,Jhupu¬†Pishi's Mutton Delicacy and Patra Pora --all of them are extremely delicious.The Wild red rice and Jadoh are tummy fillers with a twist.I simply adored the way the dishes were served inside charred bamboo fillets and there was a smoky taste exuding from them.Loved the decor,the tribal masks and the wooden seating layout.

One of the best (for tribal food) and pocket-friendly restaurants i have been to. I have visited the salt lake outlet even and both of them didn't disappoint us in terms of food.Food quality is really good and ambiance quite great but lacks in space. But the service is not upto mark. They were very slow in serving us the food. And the waiters behaved in a very unprofessional manner. I am again looking for coming to this place because now it became one if my favourite restaurants in town (omitting the service part)

One of the best meals I've had in days.....I was looking forward to this because I had heard of this place from my friends numerous times and I couldn't wait. Finally when the day came I was not disappointed.
I the food was good the ambiance was OK , a little cramped because of the little space but other wise the decorations were perfect. The food was great the wile red rice was particularly delicious which is why we ordered it twice. 
Over all I had an awesome time and I will definitely come back here to try the rest of the menu card. Only I wish the waiters were more professional and cared about the customers and not pretend that they don't here us when we call them, it is a rude thing to do.

The food is really good, the ambience is great and the prices are quite fair. Over the years Santa's Fantasea has become the go-to place when you want tribal and sea food, and there's really very little to complain about. 
The squid dishes and the baash pora mutton are personal favorites and they are just as good as I remember they were the very first time I tried this place out.
The only thing I can think of that's wrong with this particular outlet is that it is a bit small and cramped.

Food : TRIBAL ; ordered bash pora mutton and soru chakli .The mutton was juicy and tender and was worth each penny. The chakli went very well alongside.
THAI SEAFOOD ; ordered the Beijing mixed seafood noodles. There was enough pieces and bites of various seafoods yet it lacked that bomb Chinese flavour and had quite a lot of oil in it.
Money : pocket friendly 

Shall come again for more tribal cuisines:)

Gist: A medium sized restaurant with great seafood, good decor.

I visited this place on 21.02.16 around 12.30PM. Bit tricky to find. Not a very big place but can accommodate around 30 people, reservation recommended due to crowd. The decoration is good. A washroom is available inside. Ordered Smoked Squid, Fried pepper tuna, Smoked Crab and Honey Chilli Octopus. Serving time is fast. Food tasted great. Staffs helped with the menu. Will visit again to check the tribal items.

This is a good place if you are in love with sea food and experimental dining. The ambience is pretty good though the two seater tables are placed a little close to each other. 
The complementary welcome drink is both unique and satisfying. 
The service was great and the food yummy. 
A must visit at least once if you are a foodie and happen to be in Kolkata.

Modest place with an interesting decor and a surprisingly impressive and diverse menu, stars of which are obviously Bansh pora mutton and the octopus dishes. The best part is they barely charge you any taxes. A must try, however the place is on the smaller side, thus it's difficult to get a seat on weekends and holidays.

The tribal restaurant as they say. The interior is more of a village than being tribal. Anyway, the food served is pretty tasty.
The very popular, Baansh pora mutton - served in a bamboo (bnaash) . It has bite size pieces of mutton, smoked and cooked with mild flavours. The Smokey flavour was a tad too much, wasn't my type of dish. But it is much appreciated.
Jhupu pishis mutton - this was a yum preparation. Made without oil, mostly smoked , succulent mutton with mustard leaves. It smelled divine :D 
Seafood Malaysian rice - this is absolutely delish! The green colour appears very vibrant, and the pieces of meat in it is tender and well prepped.
Burnt Chilly Prawn - pretty Spicy. Loved it totally. Succulent and fresh prawns cooked in a nice chilly garlic gravy.
Butter garlic Fish - this is a white gravy. Basa fish pieces served lightly seared in a lemony sauce.

I feel the Malaysian rice and accompaniments were better that the tribal mutton.
But great food nevertheless! Cheers :)

Liked both the tribal and the Sea themed section. Sufficient and well do to space. 
The place is famous for some delicious sea food and they dont disappoint.  
Dragon Pepper Chicken and Malaysian Rice both were fitting and Rich.  Sticky rice is equally nice.
They have a huge menu considering both the sections.  
Service was attentive. 
A good visit and a recommended one for seafood Lovers.

A very unique concept restaurant.Very well decorated and pretty cool ambiance. 

This is in my belief the first restaurant to serve such a splendid variety of cuisines.From tribal to sea food you get really cool and amazing items on the menu.

Trying the unique flavours from different parts of the states is something you will love.

The Bansh Pora Mutton is love in first bite and moreover the octopus delicacies are a must try.

Overall a decent place to visit if you are high on life and willing to taste different and unique dishes.

Sometimes your taste buds also need some adventure.Get happy high trying the exciting menu.I'm sure you won't be disappointed. 

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

View : cozy comfy sitting arrangements segmented into three parts. Full of Chinese tribal masks, statues.
Decoration is also according to d theme.. chairs r also attractive. 
 Food : the day before Christmas my frnds and I decided to go there. Someone told stories  about octopus dishes which sounds good. 
We ordered bansh pora chicken, smoked fish, octopus, seafood Beijing noodles and sea food Malaysian rice.
Noodles and rice 's tastes were good. Both contain chopped squid ..
Bansh pora chicken contains a smoky charcoal flavour.
Octopuses r good though I took only one piece. Well prepared. 
 Staff:good service 
Experience : to try some new item like octopus n squid this is the best pocket friendly place.


 Cons : little congested.

A very unconventional place I must say. The theme is tribal foods. The ambience is really awesome. With its chairs and tables, tribal arts on its walls, the decoration goes well with the theme. We went on the christmas, so I would overlook a little mismanagement there. As suggested by my learned friend, we ordered a banshpora chicken, and as recommended by the staff, we ordered Jadoh rice. Banshpora chicken is very similar to the assamese dish Sunga chicken. Cooked and served inside a piece of bamboo, and smoked to perfection, this dish would never "bamboo"zzle your tastebuds. Its enough to carry a great rating for this place. The Jadoh rice, a spicy red rice with pieces of mutton provides a perfect combination. I would steal a 0.5 star because I believe this place needs more staffs. If the food is this spicy, I would prefer to have water whenever needed.

Heard a lot about this restaurant n the tribal cuisine from friends and accolades... Finally paid a visit last week with clg buddies... We tried bansh pora mutton and chicken with seafood beijing rice and chouchi chicken in the starter....the dishes r unconventional n different in taste from the other restaurants in town.... The bansh pora mutton / chicken is good for a change in the taste buds but nothing extra-ordinary.....the smell of the smoke in the receipe appeared a bit annoying to me.....the rice again is different in taste from the conventional fried rice that we usually hav but good in its own way n so was the starter.... Service is a bit delayed because the staffs were a little less in number compared to the rush... The decor in nice but the space is little clumsy.... Overall for those who want to try out something new n unconventional it can b a good option....

Bansh pora mutton: excellent smoky flavoured soft mutton...comes in shredded pieces.
Honey chilli octpus:yes octopus...the preparation was awesome...though the octopus itself was a bit chewy..may b that's how it is...5 pieces in a plate...semi gravy item.
Mongolian chilli fish: excellent soft fish...very nice and tangy preparation...comes in shredded pieces...
Sea food Beijing rice:simple fried rice with squid, fish prawns..very simple and nice fish...good quantity for 2 in a plate.
Seafood Malaysian noodles:green colored noodles...sweet and spicy...with squid, fish n prawns...good quantity for 2.
Smoked fish:its only named smoked...basically it's soft fish pieces in tangy sauce with lemon grass..8 pcs in a plate.
Teriyaki chicken: very tasty semi gravy 8 pcs of chicken...sweet n spicy.
Over all good experience...will love to go more the bansh pora stuffs...

One thing which I have to say is that all the dishes are very different from any other restaurants in the city. I personally liked the signature dish here which is "Bashe pora Mutton and Chicken" very much. There are a few other tribal dishes also to choose from. There are plenty of options as far as seafood is concerned. All in all a good place to try out something non conventional.

Awful xperience!!... went wid a lot of xpectations, but too badly dissatisfied. 1stly service. service personnel wr just too ignorant nd kind of arrogant. D guy serving us was trying to run away from us nd was behaving really bad. D surface area of d table was too small. Nd over dat d guy serving us brot d appetiser, main course & side dish ol tgadr. I had ordered 2 side dishes, d 1st 1 cem ol tgadr wid appetiser nd main course, d rest cem wen we finished having d rice so we had to hav it ol by itlslf. Coming to d food:-

Crab meat momo- was soo stale dat d shell bcem chewy nd hard nd it had insyd was cmpltly dry nd had 70% fine noodles nd 30% crab meat nd d whole thng noway had ne taste o flavour of crab.
Chow Chu prawn- d batter d prawn was coated with was chewy nd had no taste, d prawn was over cooked nd d whole dish was soo blank nd tasteless.
Seafood rice- tasted really good but had no octopus nd very very few pieces of fish, squid & prawn. D portion size of d whole dish too was quite lesser dan d standard size.
Smoked octopus- d octopus was soo over cooked dat it seemed lyk d rubber octopuses sold in stationary shops, d gravy tho tasted real good, had soo much lemon grass, gondhoraj lime leaves, nd coriander stems dat it spoilt d gravy ultimetly.
Dragon pepper fish- d gravy was good but d fish("red snapper") as proudly sed by 1 waiter is commonly known as "Bhola Bhetki" wich costs arnd  Rs150-200 per kg nd as expected had a horrible tasteless mashy texture..atlst basa too would hav been a better opsn dan "red snapper"....

Visited it at last, last saturday. 
It is easy to spot. The ambience is good. The decor is very beautiful. It enhances the experience. The staff is friendly and efficient. It is a spacious restaurant and can accomodate a lot of people at a time.
We ordered, Crab Momos, Soru Chakli Roti, Baansh Pora Mutton and Seafood Tibetan Rice. 
Crab momos had sumptuous quantity of crab meat. 
The roti was tasty and different.
The Baansh Pora Mutton was cooked to perfection and was smoked beautifully too. 
The rice was what I liked the most. It had mushrooms, baby corns, prawns,fish and squids. It was delicious and spicy. 
Will definitely visit again !

This place is a must one for seafood lover. Nice ambience and good service makes it a perfect eatery specifically it is specialized for tribal foods, One of a kind. Lots of option from tribal cuisine and seafood. Also foods are not that much costly.

We, the wolf pack attacked too many dishes and finished in no time.
Bans pora mutton 
Dragon pepper chicken
Malaysian seafood noodles
Beijing seafood noodles
Smoked octopus
Wild red rice
Bansa pora mutton was a must one, flavored soft pieces of mutton stuffed in bamboo. Its a signature dish.
The steller one was smoked octopus. Taste it yourself to indulge yourself into an awstruck experience.

Verdict - 4/5
Recommended.

Update (Dec 17) Came back again as I loved it the last time. This time brought my family. We simply loved it even more. Just avoided few things which were not necessarily to our liking the last time. But unarguably their Bansh pora mutton is still the flagship. Other tribal dishes like Ngatok (Fish smoked wrapped in banana leaf), Jadoh rice, Potro pora mutton all were lip smacking. The burnt chilli octopus sauce was awesome. The crab with tinge of gondhoraj flavor brought joyous smile. To go with all these always go for a few shoru chakli (special Indian bread). The other flagship in desserts onion kheer is a must try. The prawn kheer also lives up to expectation. Extra brownie point is for the service (it wasn't crowded being a Monday afternoon which might have helped us grabbing extra attention from the staff)

The bansh pora mutton, patra pora mutton and jado rice all lived up to its reputation and tickled the right taste buds to me. So overall this was a very satisfying experience. Coming down to what I did not like. I asked for something quite hot, (I have heard a lot about North Eastern cuisine being very hot and that's the taste I relish the most) for which they recommended Jhunu Pisi's mutton. This dish was a let down in every sense (not just the hotness but also in terms of taste this was nothing special and better to be avoided). If I am nitpicking, I would say the service could improve a bit more. Otherwise it lived up to the hype it deserves.

Not giving a proper 5 on 5 for this restaurant is a sin.

I came to know about this place from zomato. But never really happened to visit this place. ¬†Before the pujas, I went there with one of my friend and I was totally mesmerized with not only the food but also the ambiance. We have ordered Jadoh, Oyster Chili Basil Squid and the famous Bansh Pora Mutton.¬†
And I really loved the food there. Also I liked the fact that they use less oil than normal.¬†
And we are quite impressed with their service as well.

This place was on my check list for so long..finally went there..we had to wait for a while to get our place..ordered crab momo and dragon pepper chicken for the starter.Both tasted really well.We had their speciality bans pora mutton which was quite good and also had gadho-quite unique in taste. We also ordered seafood Malaysian noodles and shanghai prawns. I just loved the prawns. We wanted to have their shrimp kheer but it was already over. The bill amount was 1500..good value for money

One thing I can straight away say that the place is very much appropriate for a foodie like me mostly because of its pocket friendly nature. Honestly speaking if you are keen to have some taste of tribal food then it should have been at the top of your list. The place is also famous for its exotic seafood. I have been to this place twice. The decor,the ambiance and the food is very much appreciable.¬†

First time I have ordered- Shanghai squid,Crab momo(steamed), Honey chilly octopus, Seafood Beijing rice.

Second time I have ordered- Fried spring tuna,bansa pora chicken,Wild red rice.¬†

Must try dishes:- Shanghai squid,Honey chilly octopus, bansa pora chicken/mutton.¬†
I would definitely drop by this place in the coming days. :-)

This was my 1st visit to this place yesterday. And I swear I would love to be there a lot number of times. I am always kind of nagging and annoying in case of choosing a place to sit during my visit to each places. And no wonder, i was actually confused while choosing a place to settle down while I entered this amazingly decorated place. The ambience and the hospitality were beyond perfection. My ratings are as follows,

Food- 5/5
Ambience- 5/5
Service- 5/5 

And we ordered Crab Momo(steam) and King Fish as Starter . And for main course, we ordered Bans Pora Mutton and Soru chakli. Damn, these foods are mouth watering . üíï

It's the most popular tribal cuisine in south kolkata presently for its lip-smacking tasty food.
For starters we tried lal ghost and bans pora mutton.
Main dishes were jadoh rice , Malaysian rice, Kori gassi and chicken teriyaki.
And desert we tried  guzzle nut.
The best thing about the food was it's uniqueness. Each were hell lot different from the others and we're to die for.
I guess even after a month I can still feel it's taste in my lips. :* 
The ambience was good with tribal paintings round.
And the best thing was that it's really affordable.

I've visited this place twice this month and I'm really in love with the service and food. The waiters are courtesious and well behaved. They helped us to choose from the menu as we were confused what to have. 
I never expected that this place has so much to offer thanks to Sneha and Sweta for accompanying me to this place. So the first time we came to this place we ordered Wild Red Rice and A Green Chicken sorry I don't remember the name. 

Second time i.e. this Sunday we came here for lunch We ordered Wild Red Rice,Teriyaki Chicken and Black Bean Sauce Octopus yes finally Octopus. Sweta and I were so excited we forced Sneha to have it to it was awesome. The food and Service both were awesome. 
Finally we ordered the dessert Chocolate Brown Icecream which was much better than Double Chocolate. It was served in a steel icecream plate which I didn't like actually. 
But altogether its a nice place and a nice experience will be back again soon.

P.S. PLEASE bring back Tankha Turani I've heard a lot about it. Bit never got the chance to have it.

After a long debate with a friend of mine at last decided to visit this restaurant. The restaurant has an ambience that would give you the tribal feel.  I thot that I won't love the food here. But I was absolutely wrong. The food was literally innovative....specifically the tribal food. I have never tasted such a cuisine before. First we ordered Mongolian fish(hot and spicy). Afternoon that came the lip smacking banshpora accompanied with soru chakli. Now don't this that it is our normal soru chakli which our moms prepare....it has egg in it....and the taste is different. For main course we ordered wild red rice, kori gassi chicken and honey chilli crab. The rice and the crab were perfect. The crab was with shell. The kori gassi chicken was a total disaster for me. Not only me, my friend and her husband also did not like it at all. So, in a nutshell, the overall experience was very good. Could have rated it as five,  1 deducted for the chicken preparation.

Indeed there is a fantasy in the sea and one cannot get to know without visiting such a nice restro. It a combo of both sea food and tribal cuisines. both are too good to taste. The quality of food and the service is also too good. The bansa-pora-mutton is rich in taste. Price is pocket friendly. Recommended

Location : 5 mins from south city morning college

I and my friend decided to have lunch here after my grt experience at the other outlet in saltlake.
The ambiance is spot-on with their tribal. theme.
The chairs and table are also given a tribal look.
A very spacious place with a lot of siiting arrangements.
We ordered
1. Wild red rice : spicey and tasy at its best just a little much oil
2. Smoked fish : I can have this and only this as my lunch, I am so fond of it . The flavour of lemon grass and gondhoraj lemon leaf is so grt it's beyond explanation.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòòüòç
3. Teriyaki chicken : loads of bell peppers and nicel
y cooked soft chicken . üëçüëçüëçüëç
4. Soru chakli : made of rice flour . Very soft goes well with the smoked fish. 
The food was awsome as always.
Ambiance : 4.5/5
Food : 4/5 ( just coz the wold red rice was  unproportionately oily )
Waiting time : 15 mins
Quantity : 4.5/5
Staff : 4/5
The staff was very nice explained the dishes and answered my query abt the dish. Was very patient with us and when I complained abt the oil he took is very nice and assured to see to it.
Even told us about the newly opened fusion fantasea by the same owner .
Explained us few of the changes in menu too .
An awsome experience.

Visited this place with my best friend. Glad that I did. It surely tops my "must visit at least once in a lifetime" restaurant list. Ambience is perfect. Staffs are really friendly and service is fast. We ordered their crab filled momo. Momo was soft with the right amount of fillings. Though they could have added a little more spice to it. Next we ordered their seafood rice. One plate was enough for two. Squids were well cooked. Rice had a beautiful aroma. The winner of all was the banshpora mutton. Had a smoky delicious smell. It melted right inside the mouth. Had never tasted a softer mutton dish in my entire life. Lastly took an octopus dish for home. It was my first time tasting octopus and must say,octopus is not my genre :P . The gravy tasted delicious though. Cant wait to go back there.

This restaurant  has been there in my checklist since its opening  but since I stay out of Kolkata so could not make it.  Yesterday  I got to visit here with my hubby. 
Location:
 It's very easy to locate.  One of my friends told me it s located near to golpark anjali jewellers. When I asked the security of the anjali jewellers  he promptly told me the location. It's located in the same lane of anjali jewellers just one minute straight walk from it.

We sat in the Tribal section but ordered seafood.  We ordered sea food sizzling soup, noodles and tuna fish.
Sea food soup was yummy. It contained egg drops, mushroom squid fish chunks n some veggies. 

Seafood Malaysian noodles was green in colour. Taste was good. 

In side dish we ordered Wine chilly tuna .the gravy was delicious  but the fish was undercooked. It was smelling like raw fish.. We had only the  gravy. 

I have given 3.5 points only because of the tuna fish else it deserves 5/5

After so many delayed plans finally i had the time to visit this place with my friends as it was in my wishlist for a long time. The decor is very neat and authentic to its theme. We ordered Bansh Pora Chicken as starter. I dont know but i didnot like the dish at all. I had a feeling that the chicken dish was very over hyped and somehow felt the chicken's taste was stale. I might be wrong or the taste might be lime that only but i did not like it at all/neither my friends. Then we ordered some octopus dish and it was good. We also ordered beijing rice and singaporian rice which was also good. The best part was the fish dish that we ordered and of course the service is very good courteous. To sum up, my expectation was very high of that place....but somehow i was a bit dissapointed.

We ordered the famous bansh pora mutton with soru chakli,it's  kind of a roti,mutton was soft and good but I didn't like the taste that much.then ordered seafood Beijing rice with tangy chicken. The rice was really good,the chicken tastes very nice but it was really hard to chew,chicken is a soft meat,I don't know why it was so hard,otherwise the environment was nice,staffs are good,food was good not grt.

Here's  where the meat gets really interesting. Dishes inspired by what tribes of India have been eating,like that of red rice. combined with seafood,is what makes this a meat lover's heaven. What's more, tribal recipes use very little oil! üòâ 
Stepping into the restaurant is like entering a tribal hut for a moment with decorated walls and large tribal drawings. Even the seating arrangement is basically a woody area where caricatures grin down at you from the walls. 
The pop picks here included Kerela Mutton Soup as a starter.
Then for main course  Bansa Pora Mutton and Jadoh rice which tasted great. Though I even liked red rice along with achumm chicken. A north Indian dish with chicken cubes and white gravy. 
Last but not the least came Burnt Chilli Octopus. Which will definitely make you droll the way it is presented. 
Overall. It is a nice place for lunch with friends and family any day in a calm tribal hut with reasonable pocket pinch of 700+ for 2. ‚ò∫

No qualms over the service of the staff. Order came quite soon as well despite ours being a big group.

AMBIENCE
The decor has a distinctive tribal feel to it. They have kept everything honest to their theme.

FOOD
Do not forget leave out the Bansh Pora Chicken. The Red Mizo Rice is one to try as well. Apart from this, almost all the sea food dishes are worth giving a go. And definitely a place to return to.

The white pure texture of the dessert was soothing and quite delicious. The squid dishes are lovely over here. As it's almost nearby for me, it's like a golden opportunity for me to sneak into Santa's fantasea and have tribal food.

Thumbs down for: in a narrow ally, difficult to locate, only cash payments and no drinks.
For the rest, its really good. And if you are a vegetarian / eggiterian / chicketerian only..... stay away from this place.

The first thing that came to my mind when we decided to try squid was Santas Fantasea.From confused decors (blue and green) to the items listed in menu card all stole my heart.
In compare to santas fantasea salt lake sector1 this place is a bit small.Service was prompt and good.
We ordered:
For starters:
Bamboo shoot prawn-Prawn was extremely delicious soft,juicy and it melts automatically in the month.The gravy was mind bobbling.
For main course:
Sanghai squid prawn-It was spicy,gravy was awesome but the squid was slightly overfried.It was too much crispy.
Seafood malaysian noodles-Now this is something that everyone visiting their must try.Consists of mushroom,chicken,fish,squid,octopus it was too awesome.Though noodles and squid was a bit heavy for us still we were gulping it since it was that fingerlicking good.
The menu is inclusive of tax,and reasonable also...would definitely visit the place again üòÉ

We heard a lot about this place, so we decided to check into there. The tribal decoration is quite decent with a comfortable seating arrangement.¬†
We ordered Bansh Pora Chicken, Seafood Malayasian Rice, Fish Teriyaki and Cheemmen Kheer. We were satisfied with the food quality and taste. The quantity is also sufficient for three of us. When we heard about Cheemmen Kheer, we were quite ¬†sceptical to try it out, but when we had it, it was quite nice rather, in fact, it was pretty difficult to discern that the sweet preparation was made up of prawn. It was a ¬†good gastronomic adventure.¬†

The only negative thing we noticed that the service was not so prompt. Otherwise, the experience was worth appreciating.

Island life has captivated me since the old childhood days of 'Robinson Crusoe' by Daniel Defoe, and still going strong with my dosage of movies like 'Cast Away' and a trip to the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Santa's Fantasea tries to uphold this oceanic and tribal theme in a delicate manner with a large variety of seafood and the culinary excellence of tribal India.

It was another day out when we decided to try this highly popular casual dining outlet. Located quite conviniently in a lane next to Anjali Jewellers, it was quite easy to find. 

The ambience is quaint and picturesque. The decor is quite colourful and easy on the eyes. Each rooms are done with a different theme. The seafood section was decorated with hues of blue and green, while the tribal section had wallpaper paintings and straw decorations keeping to the subject matter. We decided to settle for the tribal section. The seating arrangement was intriguing with bamboo tables and chairs, salt and pepper holders and even the glasses. Overall the joint, artificially tried to reproduce the experience of a feast on a bamboo tribal island beach. And now, for the food.

Started with the highly popular Bansa Pora Mutton. Hailing from Odisha, this was a recommendation from a dear friend. The first thing to enrapture you about this dish is it's stark visual appeal. Steaming marinated mutton stuffed in burnt bamboo stalk and cooked in tandoor, it infatuates you as the staff serve it. The next factor to hit you would be the subtle and pervasive aroma. The tangy fragrance of burnt wood, increases your appetite by several bounds. Perfectly cooked soft and succulent meat, the only complaint about this ambrosial perfection would be the limited quantity provided. 

To support it, was Seafood Bejing Noodles. Well prepared noodles, with an assortment of squids, prawns and other fishes, this dish was palatable. The flavours were perfectly mingled, and were further complemented by the large variety of seafood.

Being a little adventurous as usual, the next item on our course was Honey Chilly Octopus. The octopus were gelatinous, a bit tough in texture and chewy. The honey gravy was a bit populated with garlic, and had bits of bell pepper, capsicum, tomato and other common ingredients. The components didn't quite blend with each other and thereby turned out to quite bland.

The final dish on our course was Seafood Topping Rice Noodles. ¬†Extremely fine rice noodles topped with a gravy of seafood, it was overall delectable. Though the rice noodles seemed a bit oily, the gravy was piquant and savoury. The variety of ingredients in the seafood intermingled to give a distinctive taste, while each kept it's own uniqueness. A scrumptious treat, that send pleasure vibes to your brain with every bite you take. 

The service was warm and friendly. And other than the Bansa Pora Mutton, every item was reasonably priced and quite easy on the pockets. The menu prices were inclusive of taxes and you gotta pay what you chose. Quite rare for most joints these days and quite agreeable to the customers. 

No need to further glorify this well deserved popular seafood and tribal eatery.

Just go visit it already :)

A good old place to dig into the variety of options laid out for seafood. A popular place, no doubt. Located at the same lane as Ornate Caf√©, this place is right around Anjali Jewellers, Golpark.

Mostly known for its seafood items, this place is ideal for anyone who would want to try food that are traditionally not available in every restaurants.

My friends and I therefore decided to be adventurous and ordered their Oyster Sauce Squids. I was not much impressed by it. Although it was my first try at squids, so I can't tell if they were cooked good, however the flavors didn't cut it for me.

Next we ordered their Dragon Pepper Chicken. Now, I may not be an expert in seafoods, but I know my poultries. The meat in this item was tough and chewy. Flavor again was a problem. If you get both the texture and the flavor wrong, I don't see much positive remarks left for me to give.

Their Seafood Malaysian Rice however was great. Loaded with bits and pieces of shrimps and squids, this item and its flavor straightway made its way to my heart.

Extreme remarks because extreme were the dishes. If chicken meat is tough, there is not fun eating it. If the flavor of a particular item is not there yet, I can't say that they are. But on the brighter side, the service is fast and staff really makes it a point to take care of his customers.

Visited here during Durga Puja on Nabami. Waited for 1 hour but the wait was good, foods were awesome. We ordered Sanghai Octopus, Malasiyan rice and Banspora Mutton. All the three dishes were delicious, specially I loved the Banspora Mutton. But the quantity of Malasiyan rice was not that much what we expected to be. So we took another rice that is Jadoah, where the quantity was enough for two and it was really good in taste.loved the place.

Visited this highly recommended place for dinner. The USP of the place is the tribal food and the types of seafood they have on platter. Firstly, the restaurant has a quirky ambience. Not too fancy but reminds you of a quaint somnolent place, unpretentious which I always prefer. Unfortunately the food is not mind blowing. We ordered the kori gassi, baans pora mutton and red wine octopus. The mutton was good but the remaining two dishes were banal. The bread was soft and nice. Overall the fusion didn't hit the palate.

Went there a few days back with friends, the restaurant is pretty easy to locate near golpark Anjali jewellers. As we entered the restaurant the ambience was nice and clean and we were too hungry so ordered our food right away. We ordered Malaysian rice and non-veg fried rice and on the side we ordered bansa pora chicken as it was on all our wishlists for a long time and smoked fish. As the food came a little late we spent no time and started serving each other with the mouth watering dishes. The bansa pora chicken was great and had a unique aroma which triggered our appetite even more and the Malaysian rice  also tasted very good with a hint of dhaniya and small pieces of squid in it. The non-veg fried rice was normal and tasty, nothing fancy but what caught my attention apart from the bansa pora mangsho was the smoked fish. It tasted havenly, we were smitten by the taste. It was soft and stood up to its name which said 'smoked'. After finishing all those dishes we still felt a bit hungry so again ordered another chicken and basil side dish and I am sad to say that the dish was disappointment. The gravy was good and tasty but the chicken was so hard that we had a tough time while eating it. Apart from that I had a nice experience with Santa's fantasea and am looking forward to visit again.

It was dashami and a okd school reunion

Started off with the bansh pora chicken and the bansh pora mutton which were cooked perfectly but did have a smell though

We addrd soru chakli along with it which was brilliant as always and was finished up pretty fast

For main course we went for jadoh rice and a chicken preparation which was made with coriander, garlic and onion. The jadoh was exquisite and had ample amount if mutton in it and the chicken was amazingly prepared as well.

The quality was pretty decent enough given the fact that there was the usual pujo rush. Nevertheless it was an amazing experience again

I have been visited these place on saptami for lunch during Durgapuja and it was my first time visit to these place, restaurant was not really decorative it's a small joint but have heard about their seafood and bansh pora Mutton a lot so thought to visit, ambience was OK type we had Malaysian green fried rice, Shanghai squid and bansh pora Mutton although we have to wait a long for food after giving order, dishes were OK not so much delicious as I heard but at the same time not that worst too... Everything was good but they have to look after their ambience and try to make it more clean and decorative

Since you searched for this restaurant in Zomato let me assume you heard about this joint from someone who suggested you this place and highlighted a specific dish- banspora chicken/mutton. Please don't harbour a lot of high expectations regarding this dish /place. Well, to put it honestly, it is just grilled mutton or chicken, albeit grilled in a hollow bamboo..but thats it, it  hardly differs in taste. It not at all worthy of the fame it has gathered recently. Yes, definitely, the food served is unique, but that doesnot mean that they are of the highest standards.Looks like most Kolkatans today will lap up and praise all those things which, according to them, are different from what others are having. Instead of delving much into the quality people very easily fall into the temptation of assossciated glitter. People preach these as achievements and others with no intention to fall behind follow suit, like a flock of sheep, comforming very much to the human nature. So my advice to you will be to not be a sheep and to refrain yourself from visiting such an average place by visiting some other places.

Went there first time during the puja. We had to wait in the queue for 30 mins due to the heavy demand. The wait was worth it. The ambience was unique and the management was great. We were total of 9 members. We ordered Malaysian Rice, Malaysian Noodles, Banspora Chicken, Thai Oyster Octopus, Smoked fish followed by Chicken Kari Glasse. My favorites were the Rice and the Chicken Kari Glasse. The quality and quantity were both at par. The pricing is all inclusive of taxes and very pocket friendly. Loved it!!

Well, I love this place. The staff was super friendly. It's a tribal and oceanic themed restaurant and they provide the best tribal and seafood in town. I've previously been to santa's fantasea in salt lake and I loved the food there. This time I wanted to try the popular banshpora. So we ordered one and yes! The dish lives up to its fame. Malaysian rice have become one of my favorite here but I did not like the roti made of rice dust, it almost sticks to your teeth.
Plus point - very very reasonable prices.
Highly recommended.üòÑ

I had heard rave reviews about this restaurant and was very intrigued to try out the place. Finally made it on a dashami evening with a bunch of friends. But honestly I was left with nothing else but in utter bafflement. The ambience is decent and lives up to the theme. But service is very slow and the staff has a very lack lustre behavior. But it was the food, which we were so excited to try out,let us down the most. We had ordered butter garlic squid and smoked chicken for entr√©es and we were yet to decide on our mains...to our disbelief, the squid which was served was stale and that also to such an extent the horrendous smell emanating from it was unbearable, literally forcing us to puke !!! The chicken was also stale,but not as much as the squid...It was dry and very fibrous....we just could not eat and were forced to leave. I was really very excited to visit and try out their interesting repertoire, but I never expected this kind of irresponsible and incompetent service that also from place,which has had their so called crowning glory...!!!

Have always wanted to try seafood. Authentic seafood. Santa's Fantasea is probably the only authentic seafood place in Kolkata that even goes light on your pocket.

We went there on Dussehra afternoon and unfortunately had to wait over 90 minutes just to get in. The queue manager was really amateurish.

The interior decoration was good but nothing to blow one away. Some very half hearted tribal paintings were done which fail to grasp anyone's attention.

The table wasn't clean when we were given the seat and the place is very congested. They jammed almost all the space possible with dining tables and chairs.

Poor for ambience.

We ordered Smoked Octopus, Malaysian Noodles and Shanghai Pepper Squid. First timers don't try their spicier version of food as it's too spicy for some. The food was just about the right amount and the taste was decent.

Not much to judge here for me since there isn't anything for me to compare to. All in all a mixed feel towards this restaurant and I would like to visit them again in may be a less hectic / eventful day.

We went to the place with my old school friends on the eve on NAVAMI DURGA PUJA. It was heavy rush. We got our table after 75 min. Taste wise food was decent but pathetic in terms of quantity & service. It doesn't justify the price card.  They don't accept debit or credit card.

Review: Santa's Fantasea
A short section by section review, focusing on major aspects.

Location - 4/5
At almost Golpark crossing, it is very easy to direct one to this restaurant. At the lane of the Anjali Jewellers, it is just a few meters inside. Not directly visible from main road, but fairly easy to reach.

Facilities - 4.5/5
No parking facility nearby, but plenty of lanes around to park your car at walkable distances. Takeaway facility is there. I was greeted with a welcome drink on my first visit, that was something I'm yet to experience from other such affordable restaurants.

Ambiance - 4/5
Beautifully decorated inside in simple tribal furniture and wall paintings. You can feel that you are in the place for seafoods & tribal delicacies. Seats & table-heights are comfortable for peaceful eating. On the minus, the washroom could have been better made and roomy, and could have more wash-basins so one need not wait for his turn for simple hand-wash.

Drinks & Food - 5/5
Seriously, I have tried a lots of food here, almost everything for the first time, and I was never ever disappointed by the taste. Various dishes of Squid, Octopus, Prawn, Fish for the seafoods meets the tribal meet preparations so well here. The chicken lovers will have plenty options too. Pricing is very good, and you will feel your money to be well spent.

Service - 4.5/5
The attendants are very courteous and ready to help. But in busy hours, they take more time for serving than you would like. The method for systematic management of waiting list is also appreciated.


Overall - 4.5/5
Standard pub with foods that are targeted mostly for having with the drinks and the hookah, the place will be liked by most of the young people with a good amount to spend, but strictly not for those who will like to end the evening with a proper dinner & some drinks for a reasonable amount.

Excellent place to satisfy the gastronomical quench. Visited the place on Durga Pujo Oshtomi night with family and experienced complete satiety,courtesy of a sumptuous meal comprising Jadoh rice,Korri Gassi,Soru Chakli and the famous Bansh Pora Mutton.The warm and cordial behaviour of the staff even on the rush hours was a major high for me.The ambience and the affordable price were other reasons enough to visit the place yet again and recommend to everyone else to dig into tribal and seafood cuisine. A big thumbs up for Santa's fantasea üëç keep it up. Tried Teriyaki chicken and Julu pithe as well on my 4th visit to the place and needless to say they matched up to my expectations. I will definitely go back for satisfying my gastronomic quench.

If you are looking for great seafood in Kolkata must visit this place! I have been their twice. SHANGHAI SQUID is their USP for sure! Octopus items is ok. If seafood is not your choice then definitely try their mutton soup & bashpora mutton! Ambience is quite unique & it should be a treat for selfieholics! Some may argue that the price is one the higher side but it's worth it.

I heard about this place a lot... and finally am here..... I must say its worth it... Talking about the place.. Very well decorated... captured the tribal decoration very well... and very easy to locate

Food : We ordered Seafood Malaysian Rice, ¬†Jadoh Rice, Shanghai Fish, Bash pora Mutton and Tihou Kheer

Jadoh Rice was excellent...Tribal Rice mixed with small pieces of mutton... absolutely delightful...tastes better than any fried rice of ¬†top chinese restaurant...¬†

Shanghai Fish was a tricky dish...the fish pieces were as soft as cotton... first we expected it to be spicy... when we tasted it..it tasted very sweet.. so without thinking about the future consequences I mixed a lot of gravy with my rice... but soon i realised..its not what we thought it was... gradually it turned out extremely spicy(EXTREME MEANS EXTREME)....it was so spicy that my face turned as red as the dish... but it was a good experience as it was really tasty...

Malaysian Rice itself was flavourless..it did not have any taste of itself as Jadoh... this green rice mixed with some seafood items like squid,etc only tastes well when u mix it with any flavourful side dish as Shanghai Fish..

Bash Pora Mutton is speciality of this place... smashed mutton steamed in bash(bamboo)...it was good as hell... Though the quantity of this item was little insufficient compared to its cost.. fit for only 1 or 2 people... still i would suggest to taste it..if u dont it will be a big miss.....

Tihou Kheer : Nothing special... some normal kheer or Bengali payesh...was little disappointed...

Cost : Very reasonable.... We ordered so many things and bill was only Rs 1330...where only bash pora mutton itself was Rs 380...

Service : was good... people were polite... just they need some extra hand....

Ambience : Good enough.. nothing to complain....

Santa's fantasea is one of the best restaurants i have ever visited..yesterday I was here with some of my siblings and we were fascinated by the ambience of this place..The quality of food was very good..The fast service is also noteworthy..Everyone must try 'shanghai squid' and 'banshpora mutton',which are among the best dishes..'soru chakli' and 'jhupu
 pishir mangsho' are also very good..The bamboo chairs maybe uncomfortable for some..Overall this is one place which is worth visiting!!!

Location : Take the lane beside the golpark outlet of 'Anjali Jewellers' and on the left side you'll find Santa's Fantasea.
Ambience : This eatery is divided into two parts having underwater and tribal themes respectively.
I *LOVED* the cozy feeling and the cute wall arts.
The staffs were well behaved.Even with all the ongoing pujo-time hustle-bustle,they served our food in no time.
Food : Find a word better than 'Awesomazing'.
That's what the food is like.
We ordered ~>
1.Malayshian Noodle : A green coloured noodles with capsicum,onion,squid and prawn.This dish spells love üòç
2.Chilli Pepper Squid : Numerous tonguegasms courtesy this dish.Perfectly flavoured and well cooked.
3.Thai Oyester Chilli Basil Fish : YUMMY to the power infinite.It kinda owns my heart now üòç

Visited this place for lunch on a very busy & crowded day as it was Panchami of The Great Durga Puja. Had to wait for about an hour to get our seats. We had Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Noodles, Smoked Chicken and Shanghai Pepper Chicken. They delivered the food within 15 mins, but the second delivery of an extra plate of Fried Rice took too long (about 20 minutes). Quantity was a bit less compared to other restaurants in that area, but taste was top-notch. Although I found the chicken in smoked chicken a bit harder to chew. May be the cooking quality was compromised due to huge rush. Overall I liked the food and the price was reasonable.

Being a foodie I always look for places where I get a different flavor...santa's fantasea had been in my hit list and the first time I went there we were almost starved....it was noon and we were dying to have something...the place was crowded and after some wait we managed a table.......we ordered fried pepper mackerel,julu pithe, sticky rice, banshpora mutton...I particulary liked the sticky rice...i didnt like the mackerel though because of the smell...but sticky rice is a thing that can go with any chicken or kuttin platter....i went with one of my friend and d amount of food was sufficient for us... When I went second time,  we ordered jadoh, sticky rice (I recommended as I liked it very much),patra pora mutton, kukhura ko masu and ngatok....jadoh is a full plate in itself...it might not go with everythng...I particularly liked the kukhura ko masu and ngatok... Wish to vsiit again... :-)

My partner was mentioning this place since last few weeks and so after the finishing touch to our pujo shopping we visited this eatery. The decor was pretty impressive with thatched style gateway and a tribal face. The chairs with a feel of bamboo looked very much in theme but was a bit uncomfortable. We ordered the much spoken BAANS PORA CHICKEN , RED RICE AND ONION KHEER.The quantity exactly serves two. The chicken tasted good but personally I feel its over-hyped.Its the same chicken thats added in chicken roll with just a burnt flavour.The rice tasted exactly like schezawan rice.The kheer was just our normal "payesh". There wasn't any onion flavour neither was it different in any other sense.Felt like we were eating all known regularly eaten items in a tribal ambience. The waiters need to be a bit more pro-active. Contemplating if I would visit it again. To sum it all , its not bad but then there is nothing out of the box here as far as the taste buds are concerned.

Sisituated near Anjali Jewellers golPark this place serves the best tribal and seafood in town. The decor is extremely simple and has a tribal touch to it..the food , portions and the pocket pinch is in absolute sync. We ordered banshpora mutton with Soru chalking  their signature dish...a rice from Meghalaya a chicken preparation made with coconut n tamarind.for a first timer the smoked octopus was brilliant and so was the brownie ice cream.

Oyster chilli basil octopus and sanghai squid was very nice and delicious dishes. As i am not a fish lover, i did not like the dragon paper tuna. But it was a nice dish to try at once. The seafood malaysian rice was also a very very delicious item that fantasea made for us.
We paid 930/- for three persons. Which is also not a very expensive figure for 3persons when the food is delicious and worth trying....

Located beside the lane of Anjali Hewlerrs, visited this place couple of times to experience the taste of tribal innovation in food. Bash pora mutton is an exceptional among the items in the menu which goes perfectly with soru chakli. The eatery specializes in tribal and seafood cuisines. Among the seafood the squid preparations and the seadfood fried rice are the best in the menu.

This is a fairly new restaurant with a unique menu. Must try Bansa pora mutton, jadoh rice and soru chakli from tribal cuisine, and malaysian rice and teriyaki fish from the seafood menu.
What we loved most are:
1. They gave us a chicken starter completely out of the menu, which was very tasty.
2. The Malaysian rice was tasty too, and had a variety of seafood in good quantity too.¬†
3. Teriyaki Fish was one of the best. It had boneless red snapper pieces tossed in butter, bell peppers and a tangy sauce which made it a perfect match with the rice.
4. The Jadoh rice was good, as it was a bit spicy, and contained a lot of succulent mutton pieces.
5.The Bansa Pora Mutton was the "champion of the dinner". Even though the preparation did not have any gravy of itself, but the mutton was juicy, tasty and smoky. 5/5 to the dish.
6. The staff, including Manager Sanjay Babu was very cordial and polite. Sanjay recommended us dishes so well that we really enjoyed more than what we expected.

suggestion for management: May include tribal music for the complete development of the ambiance.

Looking forward to visit again, and try something new.

Hands down!! I absolutely love this place. Their kerala mutton soup is soul lifting!! The squid is absolutely delicious. I dont like octopus because of its rubbery nature in general.

This place was in my wishlist for such a long time.. Went there on a birthday treat with a group of 16 people... Ate a variety of dishes and loved them all especially the tribal food... 

Steamed Crab Meat Momo- 6 pieces of medium sized momo served with a red sauce... It was lip-smacking.. I have never had anything like that before... This starter itself stole my heart completely..

Jhulu Pitha- it was kind of a stuffed bread... It was very very tasty...

Jadoh- it had enormous amount of mutton pieces in it..and so so delicious.. We ate that with baans pora chicken..  And it really went well with the rice as well..

Baans Pora Chicken- oh boy!! This dish is something i will always crave for and will still not be satisfied no matter how much and how many times i eat.. Perfectly flavoured with soft succulent pieces of chicken...

Also tried sanghai squid..the dish basucally was batter fried squid pieces tossed in a sauce.. The coating on the squid was crisp and tasty bt the squid itself had a bad after taste..may be because this was the first time i tasted squid..  I personally didn't like it..

Red rice was good too.. 
Another chicken preparation i tried was kori gassi.. Jt was chicken in green gravy... It tasted delicious too..
Mongolian Fish was also nice..

The service was promt.. And the ambience was also good..
A must visit for everyone out there.. üòÉ

The place is located near Golpark, along the Anjali Jewellers alleyway.
Had gone for a light lunch and had Bansa Pora (mutton), Honey chilli squid, and Jadoh.
I've had squid before and Santa's squid was very well prepared. Not at all rubbery or hard, which is one of the biggest disappointments when eating squid.
Jadoh was a little like sticky rice, but obviously a lot more spicy.
Overall experience was quite nice. The staff was friendly and prompt. However, they did have to refuse certain items from the menu (but that could have been a singular issue).

It has been long time that we heard about this place specialised in indian tribal and sea food. So after today's puja shopping in south kolkata, we decided to barge in there.  
The place is nicely decorated as per the food speciality. We ordered bansh pora chicken, Soru Chakli, burnt chilly prawn, malaysian rice and onion khir. The food is good with different taste. It is not run the mill restaurant and food diversity and quality are the proof of the same. The service is cordial by the staffs. Overall a nice experience.

I was suggested this place by a friend and I am glad she did so. Initially it was a bit difficult for me to locate the restaurant because of it's small entrance but inside it is beautiful. It's a themed restaurant and is famous for it's sea food cuisine. I loved their seafood coco lime soup and kukhura ku masu chicken. I actually licked the plates clean :D. The staffs are good too. Overall, I really liked the place and it is super affordable.

Santa's Fantasea I heard so much about their Bansh pora mutton. We tried it. Yak! Absolutely a non sense dish. I didn't try their sea food so can't comment on that. Tribal food ought to be different but they camouflage mutton kima as bansh pora mutton. That is not a good business tactics.

It's just splendid,words fall short for it.... from the starters till the desserts one tends to lick it up and keep no remnants of the particular food.... no need of mentioning the environment as it's just too good and above the rank for a sea&tribal food destination! The staffs are well mannered, sobre and helpful.... one should go for the 'squid' and the 'chemmeen' kheer.... just heavens üòç@

Ordered twice Bansa pora chicken through Swiggy. The chicken preparation is really awesome. The packing for home delivery was good as they wrapped the entire bamboo stick with chicken with aluminum foil for home delivery. People who do n't like spicy food can go for it.

Visited with my family on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was off the main road and is situated in the ground floor of a 2 storeyed house. Decor was ok but the space is too small and cramped. The chairs were not very comfortable but I guess it was due o the tribal decor. Ordered Bansh Pora mutton for starters which had an excellent taste and I loved the way they served it in a bamboo in traditional santhal style. I heard this joint was famous for seafood so we ordered seafood noodles, fish in garlic sauce and burnt chilly octopus. Taste was ok . Desserts were not available. Had ¬†a pleasant experience but it could have been better.

The restaurant is very easy to find .....but hard to notice at first because its not as big as the other restaurants. The ambiance is good....and food is lip smacking...we ordered bansha pora chicken,soru chakli,butter garlic squid and seafood beijing noodles. All of those are good.... specially the squid....only negative i found is the amount of salt in the food is less üòúüòúüòú (thats not a big deal... depends on your preferences).

Frankly speaking I was disappointed after so much of hype and reviews from friends..the best part it the dishes are different from what we eat regularly and we get to taste tribal and other delicacies which are not so common.
Coming to the food..we had baash pora chicken..an over hyped item..I didn't like much..had a burnt smell of bamboo which was nice..Chicken was too dry..
Dragon pepper fish..spicy red gravy..tasty item..Fish was very soft and juicy..
Seafood mayalsian rice..green color rice with seafood..The rice was mentioned to be without squid..bt they served with squid..although after complaining they changed the dish.
Tangy sauce chicken..a sweet and sour red gravy with cubes of chicken..The chicken was soft but gravy not so good..
They did not accept credit card..all the cash we carried had to be given for payment of the bill. Service is good and staffs are polite.

This place turned out to be a hidden gem. Went there with a couple of friends and the experience was pretty good except the fact that it was too crowded and we had to wait for almost half an hour to get a table. But the wait was worth it! We really enjoyed the Bansh Pora Mangsho and Jadoh rice. Good quality food and cosy ambience, it's a must visit if you're in the mood to try something different!

Finally visited the much awaited place on my bucket list! ‚ù§ And I'm so glad with the service, and the food, and the ambience!

This place is located in the lane adjoining Anjali Jewellers and is very easy to spot! Very centrally located, so that's a plus point. No confusing lanes and by-lanes, much to the joy of any hungry eater! 

The ambience is really colourful and bright. Each of the rooms are done up in a different way, and the d√©cor is very soothing to the eyes, especially the seafood section which is done up in shades of cool blue and green. The bamboo chairs too, added to the authenticity of the joint serving tribal cuisine.

Coming to the food straight away. Honestly, this was my first tryst with tribal cuisine and I was a bit apprehensive, but my oh my! Santa's fantasea, you made this experience so damn worthwhile!
We ordered :

‚Ä¢ Shanghai squid - yummy! I'm a squid lover and this dish was finger-lickingly good. Made to perfection! 

‚Ä¢ Spring fried tuna - okay, this is where I deduct the marks. I mean I wasn't expecting 2 big sized maacher bora. Really! Plus they tasted pretty bland. Plus, they hadn't even served any sauce or dips to have the boras with. So it was pretty dry and bland. 200 bucks gone down the drain. In fact this was the ONLY letdown of the evening.

‚Ä¢ Malaysian seafood rice - this is very appealing to the eyes, being absolutely green in colour and also definitely to the taste buds.‚ù§ it had good amounts of fish and squid much to my delight. 

‚Ä¢ Teriyaki chicken - my bad! I thought this would have slight gravy but it was absolutely dry. So it couldn't be paired with the rice. However, as a standalone dish, this tasted fantastic! Absolutely tangy and tasty.

‚Ä¢ Patra pora - oh my god! Believe me, I just increased the rating by 0.5 right now! I mean, this was soooooo good. Instead of ordering the much hyped baanshe pora mangsho, we went for this one, and we were not disappointed in the least bit. Mutton shreds slowed cooked in banana leaf. Oh god, I'm salivating already. Please, do try this one.‚ù§

‚Ä¢ Shoru chakli - the tribal pancake! This went really well with the patro pora. 

‚Ä¢ Chilled coke to wash all of this. 

The service was warm and friendly. And I loved the experience.

Pocket pinch - 1350! VAT free! YAAYY!‚ù§

P.s. The servings are really good, and we had to pack the rice and chicken back for home. And as I'm writing this review, I'm simultaneously my stuffing myself with yummy Malaysian rice.

For searching the place.. It can be a pretty good riddle..But after we made it to the spot we were stunned..The ambiance is great..The workers are warm and the food..Well let me just take a moment to appreciate those..Please try the baansh pora maangsho..It is a treat to your taste buds..And did I forget to mention the Chilly Octopus with Rice Noodles..Many a couples ordered the same, which made me realise it is a famous dish..So, proposing the same.. *_*

Went for lunch today at this greatly reviewed place. Interiors are simply done with a feel of tribal & rustic environment. We found the rates to be quite reasonable. Tried the following from a wide range of delicious sounding items.
Kerala Mutton Soup - A lovely soup with mutton keema, coriander & lemon. Really tasty.
Banspora Mutton - A tribal dish from Odisha, this dish is one of the signature dishes of Santa's Fantasea. Tenderly cooked mutton pieces served in a small piece of  bamboo. The mutton gets cooked within the bamboo & the smoke gets nicely infused 
Pomfret Pepper Fry - Deep Fried Pomphret whole pieces
Jadoh Rice - A tribal rice dish from North East. It's red rice cooked with small pieces of mutton. A bit hot but tastes great.

Will visit soon to try some Fish dishes...

visited this place on the friendship day this year. nice homely atmosphere .. except the foreigner group sitting near our table and growling like animals... but not cutting the rating for that because the restaurant authority was not responsible for this. We had tribal rice, bansa pora chicken, chilly octopus as main dishes ¬†.. about the starters we did not have a good experience. It was probably kimchi sea food salad (not sure though) .. it is better to order the items suggested by others i think... bansa pora chicken is a delicacy ... just wonderful .... octopus was ok ...

Best seafood you can have in Kolkata with moderate budget!!!
Pros:1. Awesome lip-smacking food..
2. No extra charges(no service tax, no vat)..
3. Price is very decent.
4. Distinct taste of every dish(though all taste really great).
Cons:1. Quantity of main courses is little less..
2. Nothing else, this one's really fabulous.. 
Experience: I have visited this place more than once so I can assure you about the seafood offerings here.
Octopus in oyster sauce was just too delicious for me, though smoked octopus is also tastes good but I would suggest the first one.
In main course, Malaysian and Beijing seafood rice is the best you can get, but my favorite is the green Malaysian rice.
They also offer a various dishes of squid,chicken and fish, all tastes great and heavily satisfies your stomach, you can try according to your taste, no issues with that.
Haven't tried any of their tribal food but heard good things only about this restaurant.
Overall: if someone is looking for a good seafood restaurant and they have a budget then my friends, this is the place. Spend around 300-350 per person and have a seafood extravaganza.

The food Quality did not impress me on the first visit, but what impressed me was the Manager's sincere effort to make customers happy. I will edit my rating if I find better food the next time I visit. The place has a potential.¬†

TOILET : Now that really dissapointed me. Very poorly maintained toilet. Not their fault though, men piss without lifting the toilet sit up ............. yuck.... but in that case, ¬†they should put up a sign saying, men, please lift the toilet sit............ or something........... I know, its a tricky area to solve, but you have got to do it. Good Luck!

Situated near Anjali Jewellers ,Golpark this place is unique for its tribal and seafood menu. Place is small , there was no prior reservation facility , interior decoration & sitting arrangement are average. we have to wait for 40 mins to get a table but after that service was prompt . First they served welcome tribal drink 'Tankha turani' in a bamboo glass which has unique taste . After that we ordered for Bansa pora mutton(odisha) with Julu pitha & soru chakli. Bansa pora mutton was served in a bamboo container and had a unique burned smell & taste which made it delicious. Then we order ¬†for Oyster chilly basil octopus,seafood Malaysia rice which are good but not great . Overall experience was good . Will recommend to others.

This place has been in my wishlist for longer than I can remember. Well, recently the wish came true and I got to visit it for an early dinner on a Saturday evening.

The location is pretty prime and easy to find. It took us a couple of minutes to find it and get seated.

Now, I know the place is mostly famous for its seafood, but that night we decided to go for the tribal options they have to offer.

Our order was simple:
Sticky Rice
Bansa Pora Chicken
Bansa Pora Mutton (Takeaway)

The food came fairly fast after ordering, and I was immediately blown away by its aroma. The rice and chicken combination was one of the best I've ever tasted.

The mutton was sadly not that good. It somehow wasn't at par with the chicken in flavor.

Looking forward to visiting again to try all the other options on their menu. The service was great.

Note: They do not have options for payment by cards, which is a drawback in my opinion. Introducing that would be a great help.

If u r in Kolkata,and thinking about seafoods,of course Santa's Fantasea is the first name coming into mind.Till date the best seafood and tribal cuisine served in Kolkata.Must try Chili Octopus,Bansh Pora Mutton,Green Chicken Gravy(i don't remember the proper name).As the place is lil small in size u may have to wait up to 20 mins in weekends rush hour.
And the most attractive thing they don't charge TAX or VAT.Best place to have your lunch or dinner for College Goers.Truly awesome food without making a hole in your pocket.üòçüòú

Santa's Fantasea is a small restaurant near Golpark (the lane of Anjali Jewellers). 
Pro's
1.The seafood there is pretty nice. Especially the octopus and crab. 
2.The Kerala Mutton Soup is probably one of the best soups I've had in medium end restaurants in Kolkata.
3.SOME tribal dishes are pretty tasty.(Especially Jhulu Pisi's Mutton.)
4.The staff is very friendly and service is nice.
Con's
1. Slightly overpriced for college goers and target audience.
2. Exceptionally small seating area. This is by far the biggest disadvantage they have. It's not just small. It's too small. The tables look very crowded and it's uncomfortable to dine properly.
3. Some of the dishes in the tribal section have to be ramped up. The mutton items are good. But not excellent. The Kori Gassi and related chicken dishes were alright. I didn't like the sticky rice at all. Shoru Chakli was way below standard. And the niche dish of this restaurant --- " Banshapora ".
I had the privilege of tasting banshpora made by the tribals when i went for a tour of Araku Valley this year. The difference is staggering. This one just doesn't taste right. I really hope the management tries to improve the banshapora and patrapora dishes.
Overall, good. But can be better

Santa's Fantasea used to be one of my favourite places for its subtle variety of seafood. and there was a time, around a year back when the food and the service as well were truly GREAT, but the worst part is, the quality of food is ACTUALLY deteriorating. I have visited this place around 5 - 6 times, the latest one being on 10th Sept, 2016. The manager is VERY well behaved and decent and knows his ways around the menu card. But the waiters don't have a clue as to what exactly the place has to offer and what exactly am i expecting when i am ordering some dish with an uncommon name. you can google things upto a certain extent, but, i'm sure if you put in "Jhupu Pishi's recipe" in the search box, you won't get too many results. at times there is a queue for a table, but weirdly enough they won't allow you to book a table. even if it is on a first-come-first-serve basis, the waiters inside have no idea who's up for a table next. the food used to be VERY good, but the quality is degrading. Still, all things said and done, if you are tired of having squid and octopus and crabs at china town, this place, surely, has a treat in store for you. and yes, i mean it in an absolute non-sarcastic way.

Santa's Fantasea is the ultimate destination for pocket friendly Sea Food & Tribal Food.¬†

At this time, when average to downgraded Chinese and North Indian food joints are coming in ¬†numbers in every locality, then the very content and concept of Santa's Fantasea is itself the show stealer.¬†
¬†The ambience and service were quiet good.¬†
¬†Coming to food, the Banspora Mutton was delectable. The jadoh and red rice were a great relief from conventional Fried Rice and Mei Foon. The squid was ok. The Onion Kheer was a sweet surprise. will like to visit the place more often, targeting the Octopus & Mackarel next time !!

Good variety of Seafood. There is a tribal menu also which is limited but with tasty dishes. Ordered the Wine Chilli Crab without shells which is off the menu but on the suggestion of the staff. It was excellent. This time around also ordered the Sesame Prawns and Mixed Seafood Noodles. It was an excellent meal for two which left us satisfied. It is reasonably priced. The staff is courteous and attentive. The downside is the size of the place which can get noisy if full.

Santa's Fantasea is a place for amazing sea food and great tribal dishes.I have visited this place very often and their food whatever you order never disappoints you (except for for occasional unavailabilities).Their bansa pora mutton with red rice will blow you away with the flavour and heat.Also  I should mention Jadoh a rice dish with cubes of mutton cooked with spices is amazing in itself.Then comes the seafood squid,octopus (they use baby octopus which are very tender),crab,fish,prawn everything tastes out of the world but smoked crabs and chilli wine octopus are my personal favourites. This is a place big on flavours. Totally recommended.

I visited here twice before for a tribal gastronomic adventure. I wrote a review and I was really pleased at that time with their hospitality and delicious dishes. But Santa‚Äôs Fantasea ‚Äì this time you made me disappointed in terms of service and cooking. 

1.	I checked in at 3.15 pm yesterday and ordered for one plate of Seafood Malaysian Rice, one Smoked Squid, and one Fried Pepper Mackerel within a few minutes. I asked for their suggestion, but the waiter neither understood my words, nor I due to the indistinct and murmuring voice of him (It‚Äôs better to inform that I don‚Äôt have any hearing disability or speaking disability). I repeated the order thrice.

2.	I was waiting for 15 minutes and surprisingly I noticed that the most of the people who ordered at least 5 minutes after my ordering was served with their ordered dishes. I asked the waiter about this. A few minutes later, another waiter came and I was asked to repeat the order again. I did it and they went inside taking the slip. I received the meal 10 more minutes after this.

3.	The Fried Pepper Mackerel served was not at all fresh. It had a bad smell and we could not complete it. I ate Mackerel before, flesh of a freshly prepared Mackerel is always white ‚Äì but the restaurant served me a red fleshed Mackerel which I think was due to refrigeration for a long time.

4.	I never experienced such unprofessional service from any restaurant. Even the amateur waiters of any other restaurants serves far better than this restaurant. The waiters had placed the bill on my table when I was on the midway of my eating. Why don‚Äôt you learn a minimum kind of hospitality to serve the customers?

Not at all difficult to locate, it's just in the allay beside Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. It's a nice place, the ambience is good, unorthodox decorations. The food is good. The best thing that I found about this place is the difference in taste from the usual restaurants in the city. It's a place to have seafood and I think it will not disappoint one. The Malaysian seafood rice and the Beijing seafood rice are both good. The Beijing variant is a little more spicy than the other. We had smoked octopus, and it was delicious. The octopus size were moderate and in moderate amount of gravy. Next, coming to the chicken dishes, we had ordered tangi sauce chicken and teriyaki chicken. Well teriyaki stands out. First in tangi sauce chicken there were lots of annoying amount of straw leaves. Second teriyaki chicken is better in taste and the the texture of the chicken. Now, where did the restaurant go wrong. Cards were not accepted due to some technical issues. Second every time we had to call the waiter to fill up the water and after second or third time it became really annoying and disturbing. But in the whole it was a nice experience, the behaviour of the waiter's were good. They will help you in selection of your menu and will take you through the quantity the offer. Though I felt the quantity is a little on the lower side. But I wish to visit the place again and try out the tribal cuisine.

If you want to taste something different, this one should be your first choice. Affordable place to have exotic tribal food in south Kolkata. You must go for Bansa Pora Motton over there, it‚Äôs their speciality. Patra Pora & Kori Gassi are also good.

One of the most terrible places I have been to. Firstly, I dont care about ambience but this place is an eye sore. 
Complimenting that is the terrible service. 
And the cherry on the cake is a lacklustre food. Their menu sounds good and exotic but thats about it. Taste wise its a total
Letdown. 
Only positive is that the prices are low so you dont end up wasting much.

Heard a lot about this place, n was very eager to visit. Finally today was the day.
1st of all, small place with very uncomfortable sitting.
2ndly, interior wise was not so much appreciable.
Not evry food items was available also. Now about the food quality- evry one was talking about the bansh pora mangsho .... Ok the item is overrated, not a exceptional dish.
Fish items was better that came out from the kitchen, Rice was also good.
N now the major point to highlight -u hv to carry cash as they don't accept card, it was very disappointing that they don't hv the facility. So evry1 please keep that in mind. And also found unusual bill type with out service charge & VAT - don't know is this place a truly govt. registered or not.
Overall statement - can visit the place but don't expect very high return or very happy tummy that u can bring home.

Great ambiance .... combination of sea and tribal hut. A little cushion on the chair would have been great ... though the seating arrangement is very good.
This time we tried sea foods ... crab momo, sea food salad , Malaysian sea food rice, octopus in tangy sauce, smoked squid, pom-fret cooked with wine .... all were very fresh , tasty and delicious .... ¬†
The food was little hot as per my wife's liking except Malaysian rice ¬†(we should have asked the hot quotient of the food which unfortunately we didn't). Food was extremely fresh, tasted great.¬†
At the end we asked for ice cream and the service person suggested to have hazelnut ice cream .... it was really cherry on top¬†
I will come back soon for the tribal dishes here ..... ¬†unfortunately i was so busy eating, did not take any snap :(

An easy to locate restaurant next to the Anjali Jewellers lane at Golpark. Serves Tribal cuisine along with Chinese and Sea food and the service is REAL QUICK. Santa's Fantasea is famous in town for the Banshpora chicken/mutton. The mellow smoky flavour of baansh in the chicken was a perfect flavour one could ask for, crab and prawn momos are outstanding with great amount of filling, squids are absolutely rightly fried which almost melted after a couple of bites. The interior is great with a lot of tribal and underwater wall art. Extremely pocket friendly with a huge quantity of food to finish for an indvidual so make sure you're tagging along with someone. xD

The ambiance was really nice with the rustic decor. The waiting time is usually a bit long for the restaurant is not very spacious and its capacity doesn't match with its popularity, but the food is worth the wait. It is really original for the restauranteur has sought out authentic tribal cuisines from Oriya, Assam and north-east India and made them available to us. Kudos to them for the detail research and the painstaking efforts to try to recreate the rustic dishes to suit the palate of the urban clientele. The seafood is amazing and one must try at least one squid dish and the jumbo lobster. Another must have is the bansh pora mutton. Overall a very good experience.

Decorated with both tribal and oceanic themes, this restaurant near golpark truly lives up to its name. We ordered seafood supreme soup which is a hot and spicy soup full of squid, prawn, fish and small pieces of octopus along with egg and baby corn. It packed a punch of flavour and felt extremely comforting on a rainy day like today. Next we ordered seafood topping rice and shanghai squid. The rice had a nice sauce almost like sweet and sour but tending more towards spicy and was topped with squids, octopus and fish. What delighted me was the smell of butter running subtly through the rice. The squid was well cooked and crispy and spicy. The service was prompt. An excellent experience which I hope will continue the next time we visit to try out the tribal cuisine.

This is the second time i m visiting this place. No doubt that it's offering octopus at such a cheap rate, the amount is very very less. It's not only about the octopus dish,i an talking about all the dishes. My 3 brothers and i visited this time. We ordered a lot many dishes. To our surprise we found the sea food dishes have more or less same type of taste. We definitely had banshpora(both chicken and mutton)- i found the quality has detoriated. The complimentary drinks was not given any more. So when i ordered for it, they said it won't be available. This time we were more into experimenting.we ordered julu pitha.no one warned us when we were placing the order. It smells rotten something. We had to request them to take it away.
Ps: if u hv never been to this place, do dine and if quantity is a factor(like me), do have enough cash(because they don't accept cards, i face the same problem both the time).

Loved the food in this place. The baash pora mutton is my favourite there. It is a must try. What disappointed me is the jadoh. It was more like pulao!!!! And being from Meghalaya i know wat jadoh is and what it tastes like. It was nowhere even close to the authentic jadoh which is actually made of pork. Very disappointing. Otherwise a nice place with good food

After listening a lot about this place, me and a couple of friends gave it a try. One word sums it up. "Disappointment". The quality of food that is expected from a 4.2 rated restaurant nearly didn't match up to what was served to us. The only reason for the 2.5 rating is because of the promptness of the staff and their behavior.

Been to this place for lunch. Great food.
We ordered food from tribal section - Bansa Pora chicken, Patra Pora mutton and Soru Chakli roti. Everything was delicious. Service was fine too.
They don't have many options in beverages though, which they could improve.
Nonetheless I am gonna come back to this place and highly recommend it to all my friends.

ok..this is gonna be a detailed review....first of all irrelevant of the prices the service is aweful.they r totally 'illiterate of food n service' staff...dnt expect service here...we went there at 3.30..they said they close at 4.00 so we have to order all in all at one go..we did that...but still they came on over n over again to remind us that they r closed..but someone came at last..an old guy may be their owner who asked us to complete our meal n not get bothered by the check folder which they already placed on our table....now for the final touch of my review..food...see..i m a hotel managemnet guy from ihm...m not gonna tell wer i work..but pure quality review is wat u r gonna get from me....i ordered one malaysian mixed noodles..one bansa pora mutton..one honey chilli crab...lets start with the mutton...it was amazing...every bite was worth its price...the burnt flavor...the spices..all wer in perfect combination...i luved it..simply..the king of the menu...next the noodles...very very blunt...the squid in there was cooked perfectly...not raw..but exact to perfection...but i believe they wer baby squids...but it was tasty...now...the criticism...the crab...honey chilli crab was a disaster....there was no hint of chilli...it was all honey...it cud replace ice creams in the dessert menu actually...that is not all..sea food has its own flavor n texture...u can distinguish it if only u r used to eating eat..only one crab out of 4 was fresh..the rest wer all stale..crab meat is supposed to be flaky..not coagulated...only one was fine...the rest smelt bad.....i can tolerate bad service..bud not bad food...first n last experince...sorry..never again..

The name clearly stated that it is an absolute heaven for sea-food lovers. What surprised me on my visit was how they have tried to take their visitor back to their roots. The tribal theme and the tribal food in the menu are simply amazing and a very new concept, I have come across in Kolkata. The tribal menu did make me a bit nervous, with no idea of how it would taste, I ordered the Crab Momo at first. It absolutely won me over. My next order was Smoked Prawn, Bansa Pora Mutton (must, must, must try) and the Wild Red Rice. The Menu boasts of tribal dishes starting from Odisha to Mizoram and nothing will disappoint you, it left me amazed.  To taste the tribal dishes sitting in Golpark, Kolkata was indeed a new experience.

One of the most over-hyped restaurants of South Kolkata. Don't know why it has a zomato rating of 4.2.

To start with I really liked the interior of this place. A very simple but authentic tribal setting to their bamboo furniture. I went in with huge expectations but came out highly disappointed. The Bansh pora chicken came as a part of baked bamboo filled with chicken. It tasted good but there was hardly any fragrance of smoked bamboo. We ordered the Soru Chakli which was very sticky and it tasted awful. On the other hand I loved their Wild red rice. The rice was rich and oily. The quantity was average for 2. 

The only thing that I loved about this restaurant is their pricing. Everything on their menu is tax included. 

Service was prompt. The staff were really polite and attentive. You can try this place but don't go in with huge expectations.

This is quite a popular place in the city right now and because of family and friends I ended up visiting both the outlets - Salt Lake and the Golpark one. The menu is an interesting one with a mix of tribal cuisines,of mostly North East India, and seafood cuisines and they remain very true to it. You will not even find your regular drinks like sweet lime soda etc. Taste wise it has definitely something very different to offer which is a welcome change. The food is fresh and remains true to its root. Taking together both the days we ordered their famous bashpora mangsho and bashpora chicken with shoru chakli, jhupi pisi chicken, bhetki fish and crab dumplings, crispy fried calamari. We mostly stuck to the tribal part of the cuisine. With and intersting mix of flavours it is definitely worth the try. Since, these are food most of us are not familiar with, the explanation in the menu was helpful. The servers were also helpful and attentive. However, I felt the decor was a bit loud and over the top, especially the seafood section. Well if you are looking for something different to try out, do check this place out. Reservation of place is recommended, especially in the Golpark outlet as seating is limited.

Probably this restaurant holds the monopoly in tribal food menus in the city. Had been in my wishlist for a long time and one fine sunday with my sister stopped off there. Tribal themed decor grabbed out attention for sometime. We didn't order the baansh pora chicken as that had already been tasted by us in Aaraku valley. So ordered patra pora, wild red rice, julu pitha, tilhou kheer and smoked octopus.Staffs cordially explained the specialty of each dish and helped us in choosing our menu. Patra pora is available with the option of mutton only. Though i prefer chicken but had this happily. Perfectly cooked with requisite spices and onion kheer was simple yet tasty. Coming to the octopus, just had a whit of it as my sister forced me. Overall , reasonably priced food and delightful experience. Worth a visit.

Been to this place twice.
Ambiance is unique ¬†with tribal touch.¬†
They should work on their serving time.¬†
At our first visit we ordered "soru chakli" which was not properly cooked and the staffs were not ready to listen to us. They were ignoring like hell. Which made us very upset. and decided not to visit this place again But while exiting the restaurant someone called us from behind and apologized for what happened inside and also made sure we were not charged for the same. And that person happened to be the co-owned or the restaurant.
This act of that gentleman made us visit the restaurant again. ¬†And we enjoyed our meal but this time have not ordered "soru chakli".. :P

Probably the only place in Kolkata serving & famous for their very own recipe "Bash Pora Mangso". A 4.2 rating on Zomato, Best Seafood Award 2015 & on my bookmark list, what else do you need to get excited about this place. Lets dive in !

Location : This one is really easy to find. Everybody knows the Ramkrishna Mission over in Golpark. Just opposite to that locate the Anjali Jewellers Showroom. Take the lane beside it & after few seconds you will find Santa's Fantasea on the left side.

Decorations : The restaurant is divided into two dining both offering different themes. First one is based on their famous seafood theme having painted underwater scnerious on wall. Second one is based on old village as per tribal theme. The restaurant isn't very big from inside but space is very well managed, so upto 30 people can be managed over there. Things like wooden loaf based sittings & village like mud water glasses all this makes a brilliant ambience to enjoy.

Staffs & Management : Staffs were very friendly in our case. Polite, mannered & well behaved waiter took our order. Also they took quite an average time to serve our orders.

Foods : Probably the one & only place serving & famous for its Burned Bamboo Meat in Kolkata. Also Crab filled momos over here are well known as per Zomato. What else we would order then!

Crab Momo Steamed : 6 medium sized momos were beautifully served with sticky sweet sauce that was little odd. Well crab momos aren't very common, probably it tastes better with this. But in actual the momos felt very sticky, dried & chewy. Inside the crab fillings were shredded like noodles. The momos weren't juicy from inside neither their was soup with it, so disappointment for momo lovers. The high taste & fragrance of crab was completely hidden. Although it was very nicely cooked but it tasted very very ordinary.

Wild Red Rice (Mizoram) : The bowl full of rice looked very rich, spicy & oily. There was hardly anything mixed with it other than fried onions. The quantity of rice was somehow average for two people. Spices used were different, so it tastes different too but that wasn't so impressive. Color tone of it defines its name well but it tasted very very ordinary to me.

Bansa Pora Mutton : An extreme well popular dish of Santa's Fantasea is Bansa Pora Mangso. We thought to take Chicken but the waiter guided us Mutton as it tastes better with Tribal Rice & everybody orders that so. It actually came in a part of baked bamboo & meat was completely filled within that. Coming to the meat, it was tendered very very well but it didn't contain the main fat part of the mutton that everybody likes. Their was no such gravy but a thick layer of spices on it made it look very delicious. Coming to the taste I didn't ever thought that this dish will disapoint me to this level. The real taste of mutton was completely gone from it, where the only fragrance present was of smocked bamboo. It actually tasted really odd like burned mutton that didn't suited me well.

Pricing : The one & only best part about this restaurant I found was, All the items on their menu card is inclusive of all the taxes. Therefore you don't need to count that extra excessive amount after billing that everybody hates. Our bill for above mentioned items were Rs. 630 in total.

Conclusion : Definitely you will get something different than usual over here but that isn't worth it. Expectations falls apart after trying their so famous dishes. It's just the rumours making this place fly so high.

The service at Salt Lake unit was far from the desired level. Most of the items were not available and the staff kept on saying the we are short of manpower. Starters were served after the main dish and when asked they blamed it on the choice of starter as it was an item which takes more time.  No one was interested about customer satisfaction. Neither they seemed to be bothered. The taste of the food was also not all that great  as compared to the initial period when the restaurant had started its operations. Once I came out of the restaurant after dinner I felt that I had a very bad taste which I would not like to experience again.

Santa's Fantasea is a one of a kind restaurant specialising in Tribal and Seafood dishes. The restaurant is moderately small considering its immense popularity, and the interior is decorated with bamboo and woodwork, with tribal paintings adorning the walls. Bansh pora mutton and chicken comprising succulent meat pieces served in a sliced bamboo shoot, smoked squid and octopus in a gravy spiced with lemon grass and fragrant kaffir lime leaves and tribal specialities like soru chakli, wild rice continue to be their USP. The Nagaland kheer with prawns as dessert was a surprising yet delicious end to our meal. Santa's fantasea has indeed lived up to its reputation and authenticity.

The baansh pora chicken and soru chakli which we had were not that good. The soru chakli was extremely bland. Maybe it is supposed to be that way, but it was not at all friendly to the tongue. The Baansh Pora Chicken was too dry and seemed very weird to have.
The Sanghai squid which we ordered was awesome and was the only thing which we liked.
Also a major disadvantage is that they take cash only. And they have put it up that they are not accepting cards temporarily, though that has been on display since god knows when.!!!To me the restaurant seemed over hyped.

Although we had to wait for about half an hour, but the wait was worth for those great food. Best part to my surprise was that the bill came without any VAT inclusion, as they take only cash and no debit/credit card.

I came back to Kolkata almost after surviving on slSouth Indian  in Bangalore for 2 months and this was the only place on my bucket list that fulfilled all my desires to have good seafood. The rustic tribal theme beautifully blends with the ocean world fantasy theme. The staff was extremely  cordial. We had ordered bansh pora chicken, seafood fried rice, smoked crab and chingri maacher payesh. I just felt that the chicken needed more time for the flavours to infuse properly other than that it was good in taste. The crab wad brilliant, it was fresh and the subtle  flavour of the smoke  made the gravy all the more delicious. The rice complemented both the dishes and had a unique flavour with big chunks of prawn and squid. The star of the show was the dessert. We were skeptic at trying such a weird dish but the payesh was really delicious and I would definitely come back again to try their other items. A decently priced place that serves authentic tribal and fresh seafood dishes is a must visit for any food lover.

Well who knew that there lies this fantastic eating joint in the heart of south kolkata, Just the adjacent lane to Anjali Jewellers (Golpark) has this perfect eating place for Sea food lovers. Not just for Sea food this is place is an appropriate choice for someone who wants to explore  the tribal cultural food of Eastern India.

Trust me we wanted to try all possible dishes on the menu but we were just two on a tuesday afternoon in between work obviously our appetite wouldn't have allowed us to do so, we sticked to 

¬†

Bansh Pora chicken - Yummylicious (I dont eat mutton, but what i heard that Bansh Pora mutton is much more yummier)

Sea food Malaysian rice - Just WOW

Oyster Chilli Basil Squid - Too good

And quantity was more than sufficient for both of us.

Wish to visit there soon and try their Crab Momos, Smoked Fish, Smoked crab, Burnt Chilly Octopus, Bamboo Shoot Prawn and many more..... List is long so I guess its worth visiting every week once to try all the beautiful dishes.

For people who doesn't like Sea food, I would suggest them either to go and try once or give it a pass.

After hearing a lot of mixed reviews about the restaurant I had Santa's fantasea on my wish list more so coz it was a zomato award winner.  sadly my hopes were dashed. The bash pora mangho was just about interesting. The sea food soup, Beijing noodles and the pomfret in wine were nothing to write home about. 
Yes the service was quick, the staff were polite, price line reasonable and quantity generous but fell short on flavours.

This place is located in a small lane adjacent to Anjali Jewellers show room in Golpark crossing.
This is an excellent place to have sea food as well as tribal food. The place has two seating areas, one with a tribal theme, the other with an under-the-sea theme.

We Ordered : Wild red rice, Bansa pora Mutton,Shanghai Squid and Schezwan Pepper Crab.

Mutton cooked and served inside a bamboo,pieces were shredded and had a smoky flavor.
Wild rice was a bit spicy and mixed with minced meat.
The Shanghai squid was a dry stir-fry with crisp battered squid in a tangy sauce.
Crab was nicely done and it was a soft shell crab,tossed in a spicy schezwan sauce.

The stuffs were very well behaved and helped us out to choose the dishes.
The price of food is very reasonable here compared to the quality and quantity. 
I really recommend this place to everyone.....

Santa's fantasea has been in my wish list for a long time. Finally I went to Santa's today for lunch with my brother. 
This place is very easy to find. Just take the lane adjacent to Anjali jeweller's in golpark...walk a few steps..and u reach there. 
The decor is very impressive. Walls are adorned with sea and tribal theme. 
The stuffs were very well behaved and helped us out to choose the dishes. 
We ordered bansa pora mutton with soru chakli first. The mutton was awesome. The soru chakli was very soft and tasty. They both complemented reach other very well. 
Then we ordered jhupu pisi's mutton delicacy and jodah which is the red rice from Meghalaya. Both there items were very tasty. The rice was a bit spicy but tasty indeed. The mutton was well cooked. 
I didn't know that tribal cuisine can taste so awesome. I'm definitely coming back to try out the sea food and other stuffs.

The decor is minimalist and the theme is tribal with wooden chairs, tables, 'alpana', and the murals on the wall. I went there on 5th August, 2016 with a friend. For two of us, we ordered sea food supreme soup and the famous 'Bansa Pora Mutton'- a Odisha delicacy. The later obviously live upto our expectation- it was well cooked, juicy and the smoke favor added to its allure. The supreme soup was very tasty, little sour with distinctive tastes of its ingredients- prawn, chicken, egg and cruchy squids. The server was very patient with us and as it was our first time there he walked us through the menu thoroughly and gave us very good suggestions. We just jumped on the starters as soon as they served the dishes so forgot to capture any photo. After starters we opted for Seafood Malaysian Noodles, black pepper squid, and black pepper sauce crab. All the dishes were very delicious and the taste of the ingredients were retained even after cooking and they were served in huge amounts. I deducted 0.5 points as they did not serve any drinks (example, fresh lime soda or tribal drink as written on the menu) other than cococola. It would be great if they introduce some drinks which goes with the food options. There are many options which we could not try so I am surely going back to try the other dishes on menu.

Hi, firstly my last visit to this restaurant just ruined my rest of the day!..wen it first opened, it offered quality food at reasonable prices but now the quality of food has deteriorated and the prices soared up. There was no smokiness or flavors at all in their signature dish "Bansa pora"! Beijing noodles was damn tasteless..Oyster basil squid was chewy, rubbery with an intense rotten smell !! Tribal food was unauthentic..I lived in Shillong for 10 years and Jadoh served in the restaurant is nowhere near its authentic taste and cuisine. .I would have given 0 star if there was an option. . I highly DO NOT recommend for first timers in this restaurant who are planning to pop in the not soo sea food world!

Wow went there like ages back, the menu was pretty different in terms of other restaurants in other cities.... Liked the ambience.... It did get crowded by 8:30 though....

I ordered the following items...
1) Shanghai Squid - great dish, great flavours, tad bit rubbery
2) Burnt Chilly Prawn - another great flavour, would've liked the Prawn more crispy before it was marinated with the burnt Chilly sauce.
3) Bansa Pora Mutton - the standout dish of the menu, try this one and you won't regret it. The was of presenting it was creative....
4)Seafood Malaysian Rice - nothing special but good flavour of the Prawn (could've been squid, was mixed) and fish bits....

This place is located in the small lane adjacent to Anjali Jewellers show room in Golpark¬† more. Pretty crowded almost always so you may have to wait outside for some time before you gain entry to this awesome outlet.
The decor reminds you of a Tribal village with wall paintings and murals. Even the cutlery is in sync with the theme. The staff is courteous and service time is moderate. Here's a list of food items that we had along with our experience-

Bansa pora chicken- The chicken was smoked with an light undertaste of bamboo shoots.
Burnt Chilly Octopus- The star of the day. The sauce was fabulous! The octopus was a bit chewy but I loved it.
Crab Momo- Disappointing. No sign of crab but it was momo filled with chowmein.
Ngatok- Awesome. Somewhat like Fish Paturi.
Patra Pora Mutton - Juicy succulent smoked mutton. Tasty.
Wild Red Rice, Malaysian Rice, Malaysian & Beijing Rice Noodles- White, Green and red in color. The 3 rice plates had 3 distinct tastes and all of them were well cooked. Special mention to the red variety which is cooked with brown rice to retain nutrients and fibres. Even a small quantity is very filling.
Shanghai Squid- Not so good. It was so deep-fried that the taste of squid was lost. It was like having chicken popcorn.
Smoked Fish- Tasty boneless fish with a slight undertaste of lemon.
Tilhou Kheer- Onion kheer apparently but no onion in sight. Tastes just like ordinary kheer. Tasty nevertheless.

Our experience was great. Would recommend to friends and would certainly visit again.

Been here lots of times. The tribal food as well as the sea food cuisine is excellent. The baansh pora is the signature dish and it's a delicacy. Same can be said of the soru chakli and the Zulu pitha. The sea food cuisine is also excellent. The smoked squid and the Mongolian chicken will tickle your taste buds.

Another excellent place to have sea food and as well as tribal food. Butter garlic squid and Shanghai squid are my personal favourite.. The interior is quite good and the quantity of the food is also good. Recently they had added the extra tax otherwise the place is moderately cheap with very food quality food.

Well, this is really a reasonable place. Pocket friendly enough. Trying squid or octopus dishes over here is must. The baansh pora is really a good treat towards the taste bud. In short, if you love seafood, this is a nice place to visit.

This place was in my bucketlist for a long long time. So, today finally I managed to hit the place and so glad I did. The restaurant has two seating sections with tribal theme. The ceiling is sea themed, the walls adorned with tribal masks. Indeed very intelligent decor. Very courteous staff and prompt service. Today we ordered the famous Bansh pora chicken, smoked fish, the Malaysian sea food fried rice, wild red rice and black pepper squid. No wonder bansh pora chicken is their specialisation. Tender chicken served hot inside bamboo. Squid was amazing as was the smoked fish. The price rates were not exorbitantly high as well. We were very satisfied with our food experience at this joint. Can't wait to indulge again into amazing tribal food. :)

In one word simply awesome...
Though a small place but the service is prompt n food is delicious.
Had mutton in bamboo very soft and well cooked, jadoh rice which is from Meghalaya, smoked fish, burnt chilly prawn which is too good. Had kheer with prawn in dessert, though didn't like it.
Must try for once..
Also those who are interested to have squid or octopus can try out there...
Bon apetit!!

A major LET DOWN! Over-hyped "Bansh Pora Chicken". A chinese cuisine wrapped with a so called Tribal Twist,which was quite similar as any average chinese restaurant. They should actually try getting larger tables and maintaining the tea cup looked water glasses a proper hygiene. It was definitely not a santa claus' Fantastic journey.

Santa's Fantasea  was on my wishlist for a long time. Finally I have got the chance to dine on this restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant there was some renovation work going on. At first we thought we won't get the chance of eating there but the staffs told us that food is available. We ordered for banshpora mutton, kori gassi chicken and jadoh, all tribal cuisines. Though this restaurant is famous for their seafood preparation, tribal preparations are also awesome. Food is awesome and you can't forget the taste which is unique, quantity was also good. Price is also reasonable. The staffs are nice and well behaved. Finally one thing to say it is a must visit restaurant and I am waiting for my next visit to taste their awesome seafood preparations.

A rainy evening we decided to explore this seafood place , heard a lot about this place from friends and also from zomato. We were 10 heads including 4 kids. We had to wait for a while so that they could accommodate us, so for big groups a little time in hand is recommended. As the sitting capacity is less. 
We ordered 2 Bansh Pora Mangsho, 2Patra Pora Mangsho , 3 Soru Chakli, 2 Wild Red rice, Oyster Chilli Basil Squid , Sanghai Squid, Seafood Malasian Rice , Burnt Chilly Octopus and for the kids Butter Garlic fish and Chicken Rice Noodles. The food were superb and the quantity was more than enough we had to literally stuffed our self . The behaviour of the staff were also very nice and polite. So if you are looking for some different cuisines this place is a must try. And also very affordable

Well, no one cares about my writing skills here, so lets just come to the point.
Santa's Fantasea is a sea food & Tribal food specialist resaturant near golpark.

FOOD: Food here is absolutely amazing. The word 'Foodgasm' probably originated here. They offer a platter of sea foods including prawns, squids, octopus, crabs and various fish. They also serve chicken, mutton as well as rice noodles & tribal chapatis. Watch out for their Kimchi Salad, coupled with Banspora chicken/mutton with zulu pitha to have an awesome food experience. They also make tasty rice noodles that goes very well with squids.¬†

AMBIANCE: The interiors is small, but cozy with tables that look like as if they were nothing but assorted bamboos, giving a tribal feel in the atmosphere. The walls contain murals of sea animals as well as tribal people that further adds up to the appeal of the place and totally suits with the menucard and the food that they offer there.

SERVICE: The staffs here are pretty supportive, but don't expect the best of their behaviors in the rush hours. The owner often stays in the restaurant and any problem brought to him are solved with a smile. The price here is also pretty cheap. 6 people can easily be fed fully within 2500/- rupees.¬†

OVERALL: A good, pocket-friendly restaurant with cozy ambiance that focuses totally on the food they are serving ¬†and makes ur meal an awesome experience. GO for IT... :)

I got to hear about this restaurant from a friend of mine. Actually me and my family are ardent sea food lovers and we always look out for good seafood. By sea food I mean mostly squid octopus cattle fish snapper baramundi etc . Honestly I am tired of eating prawns and crab and not much interested for them. After visiting Thailand and Malaysia and Singapore many times I keep on searching to get a real taste of seafood that resembles Thai or Malaysian cuisine. In fact I cook squid and octopus at home every fortnight. So once I check on to the menu in zomato of this restaurant Santa's Fantasea I felt curious more so for the prices that's sound very much cheap and affordable plus they were inclusive taxes which was a pleasant change as mostly in the bill I really get intimidated with the percentage of various taxes. Coming back to it moreover it's unusual to find sea food at such reasonable rates in the heart of kolkata. So I thought of definitely checking it out.
It was an impromptu decision to go there this Saturday for lunch and man when we reached there it was packed with many people,considering the place is bit small. Anyway after a wait for almost 40 minutes we go our table for three and directly started scrutinising the menu card as it was already past three in the afternoon and we all were hungry as hell.
I already made up my mind reading zomato reviews what I want for sure. Like the Bansa pora mutton ,patra pora mutton, soru Chakli, steamed crab momo, jadoh. The task that was left was to choose from many soup options and also from squid and octopus range.
I was expecting snapper but there was only mackerel tuna and king fish and I wasn't interested though still we ordered dragon pepper tuna for take away. Well yes we not only dined out there , we took our dinner from there too. Yeah we are bigger foodies. Plus the food was delicious from the first sip of the soup so the decision was easy to make.
Well we ordered Bansa pora mutton, seafood supreme soup, seafood Malaysian rice,seafood Malaysian Rice Noodles, butter garlic squid and octopus in bamboo shoots for our lunch. Yes we aim to order out many stuff to understand whether the food is really worth it or not. For dinner we ordered smoked squid, Bansa pora mutton, patra pora mutton, soru Chakli, crab momo steamed, jadoh,dragon pepper tuna. We avoided prawns as we can get prawns almost everywhere.
Now coming to the food. It was delicious. Bansa pora mutton and patra pora mutton sounds similar but are very different in taste and both tastes mighty fine. I loved both but patra pora a bit more. Next we love the soru Chakli. It's so thin yet full of flavours.
The octopus was very tasty and not at all rubbery and the gravy was to die for. The squid was melt in mouth literally. I wish they give me the recipes. I would like to try them at home considering I am fully stocked with octopus and squid. The crab momo was the best momo I ever had. The jadoh is the red rice cooked with mutton and is very flavourful and not at all dry.
The supreme soup didn't looked great presentation wise as it was Orangish in colour but it tasted awesome. Well I guess they have some inclination towards colour as like the orangey soup, the Rice Noodles and the rice was coloured green too and no it wasn't squid ink they used but something else.
When I saw they are serving Malaysian seafood rice I got excited and thought of ordering them as I always crave for Malaysian cuisine as I think I am in love with Malaysian cuisine. But a bit disappointingly the rice didn't taste anything like Malaysian seafood rice. It lacked that seafood flavour and was a bit bland. I think a dash of fish sauce and a little bit more of the seafood like cattle fish squid baby octopus and shrimps would have amped up the dish to another level. Well honestly I am not boasting but I can cook authentic seafood rice better than them. The smoked squid and the dragon pepper tuna was remarkable too. And all of these costed only Rs 3710 inclusive taxes. 
The service was prompt and the staff was great and friendly too. Even with a packed house they delivered food fast. That's really very impressive. I heard they are opening up yet at another place in south kolkata with a larger area and that's good to hear. I liked the decor. Very earthy and warm. Over all I loved it. I would suggest them to include stuffed calamari, grilled snapper to include in their menu if possible as I would really like to taste them and for that it's not possible to visit coastal region that too outside India every six months.
Hope to dine again in the near future. Wishing best of luck for a glorious future.

Although I've been here quite a few times, however it never gets old! We visited in a group of 9 today for lunch. The food and ambience was great as always! 
Special mention goes to the Baanspora Chicken that we had (which I wasn't exactly a fan of earlier!) However, today the dish was brilliant with a beautiful hint of smokiness that gave was just right to make your palate sing! 
We tried the Shanghai Squid. This dish was a first for me and I was bowled over! The crunch, the spice, the slight hint of sweetness..all of it was superlative! 

I Loved the Smoked Prawn, the Honey Chilli Prawn and the Arsa Chhum - as always. These are my go to dishes whenever I visit the place.

The ambience and service were brilliant.
The folks there even arranged for a knife so that we could cut a cake that we brought to celebrate a birthday! 

Although I must say we missed the drink that they used to give earlier. If it has been discontinued, then I and a lot of other I'm sure would love to have it back!

The entire experience was fun, delicious, wholesome and memorable! ^_^

P.S.: A bigger space would see even bigger crowds! Hope they can take a hint! ;p

I visited Santa‚Äôs Fantasea with a friend for lunch during my food trip to Kolkata. Located close to Anjali Jewelers in Golpark, this quirky restaurant was not hard to find. Here goes the review ‚Äì

Ambience ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a themed restaurant and right from the entry, the d√©cor is done accordingly. There are two seating sections; both colorfully done. Beautifully painted tribal people and mermaids adorn the interior walls of the place. The ceiling resembles the sea with a bunch of fish swimming in it. The furniture goes well with the ambience. Seating however feels slightly cramped. The crockery is alright, nothing fancy.

Food ‚Äì We started with Crab Filled Momos which were great and we gobbled them up in no time. The main course consisted of Smoked Prawns, Baansh Pora Mangsho, Smoked Octopus and Wild Red Rice.

The Smoked Prawns had a generous quantity of prawns and was the perfect balance of flavours.
¬†
Next up was Smoked Octopus, which was similar in taste as the previous dish and the octopus was great. ¬†

Baansh Pora Mangsho was the stunner. It was lamb marinated in traditional spices and cooked inside a bamboo. It was served inside a charred bamboo stick which gave it a pretty good aesthetic appeal. The taste of this particular lamb preparation was simply mind blowing. Highly recommened.

The Wild Red Rice, which was a tribal preparation of rice from Mizoram went super good with our main course.

Service ‚Äì The staff was friendly and helped us decide what to have. The food didn‚Äôt take long to come to our table, even though the place was almost full. So yeah, pretty good service.

Santa‚Äôs Fantasea is a fun place with a lot of interesting dishes to offer. The pricing is very affordable and the portion served is great. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an amazing food experience. I‚Äôd be back here the next time I visit Kolkata.

Have visited this place a few months back along with 10 friends. We had ordered red rice, kori gassi , jhupu pishi and bansa pora mutton. The bansa pora mutton is their speciality but somehow i didn't liked it. The mutton was extremely stiff , burnt and tasteless. And i didnt liked the smell of the burnt bamboo. Jhupu pisi is a dish made with mutton ribs. The taste was pretty ordinary if you ask me. But i liked kori gassi( which is a chicken preparation). The service is good and the prices are fair.

Where do I begin? This place is one of my best restaurants in Kolkata, a place which I recommend all my friends to visit. The first time I visited this place, it was recently opened, and it was a week day so there wasn't much rush. We had their famous banspora, smoked crab and their wild red rice. Each of the items were finger-licking good and I particularly cannot ¬†forget the taste of their smoked crab.¬†
However, we visited this place couple of times more, mainly hoping to taste their lobster but there was always such rush and Que that we ran out of ¬†patience both times.

I was being pestered by my friends to try this place for quite a long time and going there was definitely worth it. It‚Äôs a small homely restaurant with lip smacking food. We ordered Chili squid (was delicious), Red rice and Bans pora mutton (which was bit spicy for me). One plate is enough for two persons. Should try this place if you want a roller coaster ride for your taste buds.

Finally made my visit to this awesome restaurant. The place was quite crowded despite being late for lunch hours. Ordered Santa's Fantasea special seafood soup. The presentation and taste were outstanding. The quality of seafood used was so fresh and tender but the quantity was less though. Next had the famous Baansh pora mutton and Soru chakli. The Baansh pora mutton, oh mine! The bamboo smell, the smoky flavour, the taste of spices and the mutton. Next was Jadoh Rice, of which the mutton pieces were so tender and juicy. And finally tried octopus for the first time in my life! Schezuan pepper octopus is was. I had issues slicing the tentacles, since octopuses have elastic bodies. But once I could manage slicing them and put in my mouth, oh wow! Everything was so well cooked with proportionate spices.
The menu reads such diverse and long listed choices. The food is totally worth the price. I had an awesome foodie experience there. All excited to visit the place again!

So, first time we visited Santa's Fantasea's Salt Lake Sector I outlet. This time we wanted to visit its main branch which is situated in Golpark near the Anjali Jeweler's showroom. It was about 7:30 o'clock in a Sunday evening. We did not have to wait for our seats. We easily managed to get one table near the entrance. The place was well decorated. One thing which brought our attention was a smelly ambiance and the staff was bringing all the stuffs from the main guest entrance. It was a bit noisy and disturbing. Also, this time we did not get the complementary drink which we had gotten in our previous visit at Santa's Fantasea. It was not even available with a price though the menu card still had the name in it. Anyway, we placed our order. We ordered 'Bansh Pora Mutton', 'Seafood Malaysian Noodles' and 'Oyster Chilly Basil Squid'.

Bansh pora Mutton: It was the show catcher. Moist, succulent¬† cubes of well cooked mutton was very tasty. We tried this dish before, but this time the spices and the texture of the food was awesome.
Seafood Malaysian Noodles: Green in color and full with shrimps, it tasted nice. one portion is enough for two persons.
Oyster Chilly Basil Squid: Squid was new to me. So I enjoyed eating it. It tasted more like Chilly Garlic Squid. Taste of Basil was hard to find.
Overall, Quality of food was very good.
One thing which I want to point out, is related to the part : Service. The waiters were not eager to serve. They did not even bother to ask whether we want our food to be served or not. We had to ask for the service only for the Bansh Pora Mutton as the Bansh (Bamboo) was very hot.
Rating can go like this:
Ambiance: 3/5 (smell of raw sea creatures took 2 points from the Kitty)
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 1/5 (pathetic service)
Pocket pinch: 3.5/5

I went to the restaurant with my cousins,to just enjoy the tribal foods....my cousin brother have been visited the place before us so he suggested us....we went and in starter we ordered Banshpora Mutton wit Shoru Chakli.....the dish was damn awesome....we heard about the dish,so we were expecting it to be good,but when we tried it was far above of our expectations...we true some sea foods also...those were also good...but yes the place is not spacious...if all the other tables are full you'll feel over crowded!
So obviously I won't say the ambiance was very good,though the tribal foods will make you forget other flaws!

This was my third visit to the restaurant and I¬†was disappointed this time. We (6 of us) went for a family dinner with high expectation, but sorry things did not turn out as we expected.

We ordered Smoked Fish, Black Pepper Squid, Bansa¬†Pora Chicken, Bansa Pora Mutton, Jhupu Pisi's Mutton Delicacy, Jadoh, Julu Pitha and Soru chakli.¬†
Smoked Fish and Black Pepper Squid, were good but ¬†just a word of advice- if you are using Lemongrass ¬†then please use the tender ones.
Now the tribal food section- the sole reason of our going there. Bansa Pora Chicken,¬†Bansa Pora Mutton andJadoh tasted the way it should. Soru chakli was not good, last time it tasted far more better. Julu Pitha was okay.¬†
Jhupu Pisi's Mutton Delicacy was pathetic. I really did not know that you serve ¬†a delicacy half cooked in a bowl with gravy dripping from the sides.

The service of the staff was bad. I think they need to learn that how to lay the food on the table and serve it on the plates of the customers.

Visited it today itself 
Now we ordered Seafood Beijing rice, Schezwan Octopus, Bnash Pora Chicken and Dragon Pepper chicken 
The quantity was not as much as I expected after seeing various posts, reviews and pictures on Zomato, but probably it was because we went there almost at the closing time at 3 50pm. Anyways, it was enough for 3 people 


Now the Schezwan octopus is a must try for foodies and so is the Bnash Pora chicken, which took my breath away. It was heavenly. The rice although not enough in quantity, it was quite sumptuous with large chunks of Fish and veggies. The chicken did not live upto the expectations but the others sufficed for it. 
Expecting people to go there as soon as possible

A five miuntes walk from Anjali jewellers lane, Golpark, this place is to give you a tribal-seashore feel. Be it the squid or the octopus, every food is amazing to look at and taste great. 

We ordered Fantasea's special soup, Smoked octopus, Malyasian Noodles and crab momo. Try out Bansh pora Mangsho...as they serve the mutton inside a hollow bamboo and one can get the smoked feel. The soup tasted great with squid, octopus, prawn, crab and twist in the taste. Price is not too high. Rs 600 for two.

Best mutton (goat) preparation ever! It brought back memories and more from childhood when an Aunty had sent us some goat cooked on charcoal. It's been more than 25 yrs but the taste still lingers! Basic ambience...but the food is God send. Yes I'm referring to the Banshepora Mangsho! Full marks for yumminess and prices!

Paid a visit last month. Serving time at this outlet is pretty quick but you may have to wait for about more than half an hour to 45 mins to get a place during the busy hours of the day. The restaurant doesn't take advance reservations of table also. Decor is nice and simple - liked the Tribal facial sculpture on the wall. The outlet is very less spacious but the tables are neatly placed making the place is a cozy comfortable one. Food quality is really good and so is the taste! Tried 3-4 types of the Tribal dishes they serve and liked each one of them. Quantity of the portions, specially of the Tribal dishes are mediocre and they must work towards enhancing it considering the amount they charge. Seafood items are relatively cheap and pocket-friendly. I somewhat feel Bansh Pora Mutton is little overhyped, as I liked Patra Pora way more than it. The presentation of Tribal dishes is recommendable. The mutton pieces were succulent and tasty. We ordered Jadoh Rice which was sometime totally different yet had the right amount of spices and the perfect aroma. Dragon Pepper Fish and Chilly Octopus were nicely cooked too. They must work on the hygiene part big time. The hand-wash sink area was dirty.

What we ordered - Seafood: Dragon Pepper Fish, Seafood Beijing Rice, Smoked Chili Octopus || Tribal Food: Jadoh Rice, Bansa Pora Mutton, Patra Pora Mutton

Decorations are economic yet eye grabbing.
Staffs are helpful and friendly.
Offers a large variety of sea food.
We've tasted prawn and chicken.
Prawn is mouthwatering, however chicken is not that tender.
Overall a decent place at budget price. üëç

If seafood is your thing and you are running on a low budget then Santa's Fantasea is the place for you. Located in Golpark, this place serves great seafood as well as tribal cuisine at affordable prices. I visited the place with a group of friends for a weekday lunch. The place has two seating areas, one with a tribal theme, the other with an under-the-sea theme, reflecting the two major cuisines served there. We opted for the former, owing to its novelty. We loved the unique ambience, with leaves and trees drawn on one side and cracked mud walls and ethnic decor like the inside of a cottage on another side. The tables and chairs, made of wood planks, also went with the theme.¬†

Coming to the food, we started off with Banspora Chicken and Soru Chakli from the tribal menu. The chicken came in a bamboo shoot and tasted smoky and delicious with the Soru Chakli which was wonderfully thin but a little less moist and mushy. ¬†The crab momos had bits of crab within a thin and well cooked casing and served with a delicious sauce and tasted quite good as well.

Coming to mains, we turned to their seafood section and ordered Shanghai Squid, Teriyaki Fish and Burnt Chilli Octopus. The Shanghai squid was like a dry stir-fry with crisp battered squid in a deliciously tangy sauce. The fish was well cooked and tasted fine. The octopus was a first for me and although I personally found the texture a bit weird, others at the table seemed to like it a lot. The burnt chilli sauce however, was absolutely gorgeous.We also ordered Seafood Mongolian and Seafood Beijing Noodles to go with out mains. They tasted pretty good and had lots of veggies, fish, prawn and squid in them which I loved.

Service was fine and the value of money is excellent. Overall, it was a great experience. Will definitely come back to tryout some more dishes from the tribal section. Highly recommended.

I dont really know if was us who got unlucky, but the day i visited it was an absolute disaster! I was so looking forward to having the famous 'bansh pora mangsho'.. The mutton pieces were dry n almost impalatable. The squid was nothng out of ordinary and made in the sauces which took the taste away... All i could taste was soy! Red rice was nice, different and fresh. 
I guess would want to come here again once before labelling them as bad -_-

We need more places like this. Lovely ambiance and refreshing menu. The place is small though, so expect to wait, specially on weekends. We loved the bansh pora mutton. Lovely smokey taste and soft mutton. The Jadoh was great too. Ordered two squid and octopus dishes which were tasty too. Definitely worth travelling for.

An excellent, new kind of food joint in Kolkata. I had wild red rice (Mizoram food) and kori gassi (Mangalorian chicken curry) and prawn. Both were excellent. Food was great in both quality and taste in huge quantify and it's very pocket friendly. However deducted 0.5 marks for the interiors which i found could be decorated more.

I was recommended this place by a lot of friends and family members so I finally decided to pay this joint a visit. I am a huge fan of seafood but what astonished me were the ample options they provide on the tribal menu. I decided to go on the most famous dishes Bansh Pora and Mizoram rice. ¬†The Malaysian noodle was not disappointing but I have honestly had better at some other places. The sea food items live upto its name, they are fresh , well cooked and well served. My only concern is that this place is very suffocating and not recommended if one prefers a quite dinner otherwise its a must visit because they bring new flavours that have not been experienced before in Kolkata food culture.

Heard a lot about it. But was not up to the mark. The food was too oily. Average in taste. When they were asked for suggesting a probable good combination from the tribal section, their specialty, it was disaster. Did not click with the taste buds even. Kori gassi (chicken prepared in tribal style with pepper, garlic & coriander) and Jadoh (red rice with mutton pieces) were suggested. Not at all a good combo!! Will do better separately. Shanghai Squid was a tad hard. Banshpora Chicken (chicken pieces steamed in bamboo shoot in tandoor) was average. As a whole this wasn't a good show.
Place is not that clean enough. Dead & alive insects were around the corner we sat.
Considering everything, the pricing wasn't fair enough.

Please suggest if anyone has got better experience here.

Last friday I went there with my friend. One of my friend told me it is not as good as you think after reading the reviews. But still I want to taste their food mainly tribal foods. We order bashpora mutton and Beijing rice noodles. Bashpora mutton is very less quantity they serve. Also the taste not so good as wrote in many reviews.  The taste is moderate and quantity near 200 grams which is too expensive. It cost 380/-. For that tribal food we really disappointed. Then rice noodles with squid and fish was average taste.  This is also very less quantity and not sufficient for two. The charge those menu including tax which is good for us. Lastly the waiter are very casual and not well trained. Overall experience is very average and I must say:this restaurant is totally over hyped.

The place adds up to the uniqueness that's there to its name. But be rest assured it is not to woo you with a fancy fairytale or Santa Claus. A small eatery you may call it, with the essence of a tribal culture that pretty much flows through the food and the decor. If that's not enough to get the gluttony tingling for an adventurous eating experience,  then try their cuisine. The best part of eating is when you don't know what's coming your way but you order what you like.  So here you may pretty much use your luck and order some good delicacies,  each has its own flavour and taste.  Try non-veg mutton dishes,  it's really good. Also the rice specialities and the bansh(bamboo) pora meat is amazing and so is the presentation. So move ahead with an idea of having a simple sober family meal.  You will love it.

It is one of its kind,quite a new thing in Kolkata.Once went with my friends and the other time i went with my husband .The dishes ordered were ngatok,wild rice,Malaysian sea food fried rice,fish teriyaki , banshpora and the best obviously was sanghai squid which you feel should never get finished and you keep on eating.If you are in Kolkata and have not visited it yet please do not do it as it has been appreciated by zomato even for sea food...go for it.but malaysian rice and fish teriyaki were not clicked so ...you need to visit the place to taste those awesome dishes.

Yes, quite the place to be for a food outing of any kind of occasion or no occasion for that matter. The Santa-s fantasea basically tried to showcase the Santhal (tribal) and Sea food items. The staff is amazing and they would assist you with the correct choice.

Initially they used to provide welcome drinks as soon as you arrive which has stopped these days. However, the Bans Pora chicken/mutton is quite a MUST TRY from this place.The Julu pithe should be tried if you are new to the tribal food but Soru Chakli happens to be my favorite. The teriyaki chicken is probably the only item that I have not liked much from here.

As far as the sea food items are considered, I think there is hardly anything to complain. From the squids to prawn to fish to octopus, every item is made with perfection. Only suggestion, they should also have some form of fried Octopus for people like us. I have never tried Crabs from here so no review for those. If you like medium spicy food, always settle for Beijing sea food noodles/fries.

Also, the place is pocket friendly and the price is inclusive of VAT and other charge.

One of my most favourite restaurants of Kolkata and another of my perfect ratings. The food quality per price comparison of this place is just out of this world and nobody beats that. I have been here numerous times and sometimes just because of a craving for a particular dish. We love the seafood soup here, so rich in flavours and so light. The lobster here is a must try, regular or jumbo butter garlic or black pepper. The smoked crab, the black pepper squid and any prawns are just delicacies here.
Among the tribal fare, Banshpora Mutton shoru chakli ruti are my all time favourites, with favours extended to Jadoh, Gnatok and Julu pitha.
Only con to a place like this, some of the dishes here are inconsistent - something like a Banshpora Mutton is overcooked on some days and just perfect on other days and also their salads aren't good enough. But neither of these points could deduct .5 from their 5, maybe a .25.
Only regret is that I couldn't find many of the food photography that I had done here. Obviously this calls for another round of visits to the place ;)

This joint is amazing just like the Sector 1 outlet. When it comes to tribal and sea food cravings, Santa's Fantasea is the place. The Seafood Malaysian Noodles, Smoked Octopus, Honey Chilli Prawn and the Seafood Beijing Rice were top knotch. Have always been a fan of their delicacies. Needless to say, the food quality, the quantity, the service, the unique decor is an added advantage. Pocket friendly too. Recommended, highly.

The review was long due after my first experience of visiting this place which wasn't upto expectations. The place is cleverly decorated according to both of the specialty themes - tribal and seafood. However we had to wait a long time to get a table as the place was packed, we were not guided to our tables which we had to settle for on our own and finally after being seated, we were asked to shift to a different table altogether. Coming to the food, we had ordered Butter Garlic Fish, Teriyaki Chicken and Dragon Pepper Chicken followed by Bansh Pora Mutton along with Soru Chakli Roti. Food took a long time to arrive but most of it was quite enjoyable; although I was not a big fan of the Bansh Pora Mutton (personal opinion).

On the second visit though, the staff actually did greet us after we entered. Also, the food was even better.
We reordered the Butter Garlic Fish which was as good as the last time and opted to try out the Shanghai Squid - that came with crispy sweet and sour stir-fried rings of calamari , the Oyster Chilli Basil Octopus - that was served in a spicy gravy and the Seafood Malaysian Rice with chunks of beautiful seafood. Overall, a much better experience this time around.

Food was full of flavors. Service was good, ambience was also good. I won't really mind coming back to this place.

Fantasea proves yet again that even a small nondescript place, in the back lanes of Kolkata, can be cozy, and serve some amazing food.. although this place has one of the largest verities of sea food (as their name suggests), I wanted to try their North Eastern Food.. I ordered the Jhupu Pisi's Mutton Delicacy (Mizoram) and accompanied it with Jadoh Meghalaya), which is red rice with mutton pieces.. Flavours that burst in your mouth.. absolutely stunning !!! Whether they are authentic to the region or not, i don't know... But, boy were they good.. Have to go back soon to try out all the Sea food on offer..

There is no option for 3.75, otherwise I would have given that. Now here comes a detailed review:
1. Food was good and a little bit off beat in comparison to the normal restaurants that's why 4.25 for it.
2. Ambiance - They have tried to create a theme of Tribal & Sea, but too much crowed and congested in a small place. So 3.5 for that.
3. Food - Chicken Banshopora - 3.75 (Mutton Banshopora is the best one), Suru Chakli - 4, Julu Pitha - 2 (Stale smell was coming from it), Malaysian Noodles - 4.5, Beijing Rice - 4.0 , Squid (Don't remember the gravy) - 4.5......We had all these for Rs.1080 (For 4 persons) (Have not tasted Jadoh Rice, Tribal Desserts , Other Squid Preparations & Mutton Banshopora. Those are on my wishlist.)
Waiting time was 1 hour in Sunday evening (That's expected!!)
Staff Behavior - 3.0 (Not that much cordial, as have to ask them several times for filling up of water)
So overall - a Rating of 3.75 (approximately 4).
Best Part - No Service Tax, as no option for card transaction. (Both Customers and Hotel owner gets benefited).

To be short and precise, who loves to experiment with food should visit this place once. Nice ambience, amazing tribal cuisine, located at a lane near by anjali jewelers in goal park. Surprisingly they dont keep you waiting. We ordered red rice, prawn in red wine and chilly sauce, king fish - I found that a okay sort of dish and ofcoarse their famously known bansha pora chicken, which was soft juicy and perfectly cooked. Each plate of side dish is okay to serve three people. Cherry on top is they dont charge service tax....So a place for youngstars. In comparison to the food, price is okay.

I've been hearing about their baanshpora and squid and octopus for such a long time now that when my friends asked where we could go for lunch, I instantly suggested Santa's Fantasea! I have to say that they were a bit apprehensive about the tribal food, but they agreed to go. One of my friends had already been to the place so we had no problem in finding the place. When we reached, it was full so we had to wait for a while. It gave us the time to really observe the decor. When we finally got our table, we ordered soru chakli with baanshpora mutton, jadoh rice, chilly wine octopus and schezwan pepper octopus. First they served the baanshpora mutton in a burning bamboo and it was just amazing! The smokiness of the mutton was wow! And the soru chakli was a perfect compliment to the dish. Next, they served the other three dishes. Both the preparations of the octopus were excellent, even though I liked the hotness of the schezwan pepper octopus a tad bit more than the chilly wine. This was my first time tasting octopus and I must say I can't wait to have it again! But the real hero of the lunch for me was the tribal jadoh rice. I absolutely totally recommend it! This place is a must visit!

I really like this place.. ambience, decorum and yeah the food. This themed restaurant is famous for tribal cuisine and seafood. On my first visit I ordered the tribal food. And I must say each preparation was really very good starting from baans pora mutton to wild red rice as well as the chicken preparation of Sikkim. There was an unique taste in each food which I liked the most. I would love to visit this place again.

It's one of the best and renowned sea and trivial food station in Kolkata. I would have rated 4.25 if possible. Awesome and different quality of dishes are served here. Waiting at the pick time may be bit longer but fully worthy. Hospitality is not as good as it was before though you must visit to taste banspora mutton/chicken and Shanghai squid.

Since the theme was related to tribal pattern, thought of trying some tribal food! Ordered their famous bamboo mutton and shoru chakli. Went there at 6pm, they told us to come after 15mins. Went back at 6:30, still the staffs were so much reluctant to take our order. At a certain point of time, thought of leaving the place. Due to my friend's request we stayed and after requesting them they took our order. The food was not upto my expectations from this place. And according to my friend this was not the authentic bamboo mutton. Shoru chakli was okay. Decor complementing the place and the chairs too, location is easy to locate. Still will visit for one more time cause everyone deserves a second chance.

Heard a lot of good reviews about this place and about the food, specifically the bansh pora mutton, so went to try it. Honestly I was disappointed with the item. I had the authentic bansh pora mutton from Odisha and this was nowhere near to it. It lacked the smokey flavor and also the amount of mustard oil.
Really surprised to see that here the mutton is kept inside a sliced up bamboo.
Bamboo mutton does not come in that way. It goes inside the bamboo and is poured out by holding the bamboo upside down after its been cooked.

Apart from food, ambience and location is good. Decor is good.

This restro was in my wish list for very long time. The space in this outlet isn't sufficient but the management try to solve this with decent decorations, heard a hype about bashpora mutton. Honesty I didn't like it that much, more cooking and salt were needed in that dish, I even didn't felt for Jadoh, a tribal dish made from red rice with mutton. What I really enjoyed were chilly burnt prawn and very innovative prawn kheer.. Both the side dish and desert were simply mouthwatering and yummy. Staffs were good. Not awesome but good lunch experience.

Santas Fantasea has been one of my frequently go to places for dinner and with mouth-gasmic seafood at such humble prices, it's always a treat to dine here. 

1.) The ambience is definitely in accordance to its cuisine of tribal food. Well spaced out, though the outlet is not huge but it's certainly homely and peaceful.

2.) Seafood salad- a must try if you want to cherish seafood in its originality without curries and spices. It includes prawns, crab, squid, octopus fish all put together with a light dressing. 

3.) Oyster chilly basil octopus- octopus was quite rubbery and overcooked for my taste, yet the chilly basil sauce was good enough.

4.) Baansh pora mutton- cooked and served innovatively in bamboo. mutton is shredded and the smoky flavour is what makes it unique.

5.) Baansh pora chicken- small pieces of chicken with a thick dry masala with a smoky flavour.

6.) Butter garlic squid- Its a must try here. The squid was cooked brilliantly in the butter garlic sauce. It's just yumm!

7.) Seafood malaysian rice noodles- Quite light with ample seafood incorporated. Goes well with butter garlic squid.

8.) Honey chilli squid- It was quite sweet for my palette. Too oily as well.

The place is pretty easy to locate, so finding it wasn't an issue. We ordered Schezwan Pepper Crab, Chilly Wine Octopus, Baansh Pora mutton and Seafood  Malaysian Rice- and each of the dishes were undoubtedly excellent. I preferred the Baansh pora Mutton and the Octopus. The Octopus didn't feel rubbery to chew. The staff was friendly. Overall, I'd say I'm definitely visiting this place again.

Had an experience over the takeaway process, items were pre-ordered over phone from zomato. It was ready and packed, we didn't have to wait at all.

The food was different from what I have had till date and liked it. Banshpora mutton was good, the dark colored tribal rice...forgotten the nsme was ordinary.

The Malaysian rice was better and a squid based item was tasty , though a bit too much chewing is necessary, in my opinion.

The soups, we had two types, were also very tasty.

What I didn't like was the fact that even today they are not accepting cards, not sure whether for avoiding tax. The prices, if you put taxes on these would be quite high given the ambience and space.

Recomnended specially for sea food lovers, though good for tasting tribal cuisine as well.

This outlet of Santa's Fantasea is larger and more spacious than the other outlet in Saltlake. The decorations are lovely, tribal themed chairs and tables of bamboo.. wall decorations,paintings all have a tribal feel.. The bansh pora mutton is awsome.. patro pora too is delicious! They serve a wide variety of quirky seafoods which is quite unique.. starting from squid to octopus! Delicious foods at affordable prices!‚ù§

Waiting time is too long and uncomfortable on the road. Half of the items on the menu was unavailable. We got billed for crab momos which wasn't available. Realised it when we saw the bill a week later. The amount is not upto mark. 4 tiny octopus is not enough to justify a plate. Had to order multiple times to fill us up. Waiters were clueless and borderline rude. Decent food. Not amazing as written a million times here. No card payment! And the restaurant itself is small and cramped up. I hoped the food would make up for it, but didn't. Disappointed. Not going back for sure.

My second encounter with Santa's and seafood, I personally feel their crispy chilli squid is the best dish to look forward to. The much famed 'Baansh pora' mutton had a nice burnt flavour but lacked salt, so did the mixed seafood rice and the Shoru Chakli was a bit bland. And a bit of a surprise came in the form of Kori gassi, simply put the Mangalorean chicken curry known widely among foodies to be a reddish coconut based curry, which was green in their case!!! It was a green chilli based curry, but the taste thankfully was good.
I had had the starter squid and fried prawns in my earlier visit both of which had become instant favourites.
Visit Santa's Fantasea if you are into seafood, squids and octopuses precisely. Crispy chilli squids and no additional VAT (yeah, it's pocket friendly)...these two things double handedly make this place at least a one-time try if not a frequent family & friends go-to eat-out place.

After braving lashing rains and covering quite a long distance, we were just hoping that the visit be worth the trouble. And oh boy, it was so worth it! Although it rained hard today, the outlet was packed when we reached. That was clearly an indicator of the popularity of this outlet. We did manage to get a seat without much wait. The ambience isn't the best. But when the food is so good, I don't generally care about the ambience. 
We ordered Shangai Squid, Chilly Wine Octopus, Jado, Bhaansh Pora Mutton, Chilli Prawn, Seafood Malaysian Noodles and Seafood Beijing Noodles. The service was pretty quick. The Shangai Squid is hugely popular, as is evident from the other reviews. Crispy bits of squid in a spring onion, garlic, chilli and tomato sauce. It simply couldn't get any better. Jado is a tribal red rice with bits of mutton. It was evenly spiced and tastes quite good on its own. The Bhaansh Pora Mutton had a subtle smoked bamboo flavour which definitely enhanced the quality of the dish. I have had the same at the Salt Lake outlet, but this one was way better. Seafood Beijing Noodles along with Chilly Wine Octopus was also a lovely combination. The noodles had bits of squid and some veggies like pepper and baby-corn in it and it complemented the octopus well, which itself was mildly spiced. The Malaysian Noodles consisted for capsicum, brocolli and probably spinach paste, and was a bit bland but along with the chilli prawn, it was divine. The heat of the prawn was just enough and not too over-powering. 
All this for a pocket pinch of 1870 for 3. 
A must try outlet for seafood lovers.

I strode into this place wanting to give it 5 stars; after all it had been talked up by a lot of people. But I was sorely disappointed, and hence no pictures for this review. The food was below average. We ordered the Shanghai Squid for starters, and it was probably the only good thing we ate today. Although the squid itself was chewy enough to make one of my companions avoid it completely, the sauce was predictably tasty. That's where the positives end for me. Bansh Pora Mutton- 'the' dish that this place is famous for; oh I had such high hopes for it, but sadly they were all crushed. The presentation was exciting, one could say. The meat itself was grossly under-seasoned and though some would argue that north-eastern dishes are usually light on spices, this was plain bland. Combined with the Soru Chakli this felt like a punishment meal. Anyway, the next thing we had ordered was the Seafood Beijing Rice, which again, lacked enough salt to make it like-able. Yeah, there was enough squid in it to be called 'seafood rice' I guess, but again they were overcooked and chewy. Oh and none of the spiciness promised by the 'beijing' in its title either. All in all, a forgettable dish. As a side, we had ordered the Kori Gassi which according to my knowledge is Mangalorean for 'chicken curry'. We were expecting succulent chicken pieces in a delicious concoction of coconut milk and South Indian spices; but what reached our table was a Chinese inspired chicken dish surprisingly green in color! Imagine how our hopes fell flat. :( When we tried to tell our server this wasn't the famous Kori Gassi of Karnataka, he insisted that it was, although a quick google image search would prove him wrong. It tasted like a run-of-the-mill garlic chicken, probably with coriander puree to tint it green, although we couldn't detect its flavor. By the time, we had finished our late lunch, all the enthusiasm we had arrived with had depleted. I couldn't comprehend how a restaurant that was pretty popular in foodie circles, could serve up such deplorable food. Anyway, I am not going there again, not even though it is one of the few places I can get squid in Kolkata. The one star is for th@e sweet chilly sauce coating our starter, and for the cute earthern tumblers they serve water in. Atleast they got that right!

The foods are relatively cheaper here. I highly recommend the squid and octopus based dishes here. It may sound unconventional but trust me on this, you won't regret it. Though I found the Bamboo Chicken nothing special. Too dry for my taste. So if you're on a budget but you wanna treat people with tasty foods then I suggest you to hit this place.

Going right back to the roots, this place describes the culinary excellence of Tribal India like no one does. Apart from the tribal  food this places excels In the field  of Seafood. South kolkata‚Äôs first restaurant dedicated to the tribal genre is doing wonders with its extended menu solely dedicated to exotic Indian flavors along side out of the box seafood cuisines.
Amongst  the tribal food the most recommended dishes are  
Jadoh: A meghalayan cuisine where red rice is cooked with mutton. Absolutely lip smacking and high on flavors. 
Bansa pora mutton : An Odishan style of mutton tandoored inside bambo shoot. 
Julu pitha : Stuffed Tribal Bread 
Amongst the Seafood 
Teriyaki fish : This is a regular dish at any Chinese restaurant but no one makes it as good as they do. 
Octopus in Black bean sauce : If you are willing to gorge on octopus this your pick 
Honey chili Squid: This is another if those lip snacking prodigies.
Seafood Bejing noodles : A combination of Spicy seafood noodles.

Santa's fantasea is every sea food lover's paradise on earth. Specially for the young crowd from the different surrounding colleges. If you are an experimental soul and if you want to try out new stuff, this is the place for you.
Its a tribal themed restaurant with many variety on the menu which sound yummy and are new as well. We tried out the sticky rice, smoked octopus and the crab. They serve you little octopuses which look cute and tasty at the same time. The crab was good as well. Sticky rice was not the authentic sticky rice you get in Malaysia or Singapore, but it didn't really taste bad.
The greatest thing about this place is the affordability and the quality of food that comes with it. The ambiance is good as well. And don't worry, you won't fall sick!

The day your heart desires the not- so- regular, go for the earthy flavours of the tribal cuisine at Santa's Fantasea.¬†Glad they had the great idea of introducing a different kind of taste for food lovers of the city. I would recommend the tribal menu with emphasis on dishes from North East and Odisha. Must haves include the spicy and tasty wild red rice from Mizoram, both veg and non veg varieties are good. Amazingly the bansa pora mutton from Odisha with its smoky flavour goes well with the red rice. Ngayok, a fish variety from Nagaland which is cooked without oil was great. The fish essentially gets the flavour from the spices and gets cooked in its own fat inside the banana leaf. A variation of our very own paturi. You could get a little adventurous and try the Tilhou kheer from Manipur made with onions. This was a surprise item, made with mashed onions probably boiled and added to creamy milk; definitely a worthy end to the earthy flavoured meal.
Other recommendation: smoked crab is hot and spicy with a distinct lemon grass flavour and keeps you craving for the next bite. Tried the black pepper kingfish, liked the preparation but wasn't impressed with the quality of surmai.

Ambience is regular, decor has some tribal wall decor elements, so just go for the food. It's usually full during meal times on weekends, so go when you have time to wait.

This is the best place serving Tribal food in Kolkata. I visited this place in the month of May for family Dinner.
*AMBIENCE*
The place has tribal caricature all over the walls. The seating is distributed in three rooms. The place is not very spacious. 
*FOOD*
We tried the following combinations:
Soru Chakli with Banshpora Chicken - An Awesome combination of flour and Egg with Banshpora(served in bamboo sticks) Chicken
Red Rice with Jhupu Pishir Mutton - Excellent combo of spicy mutton with tribal rice.
Malaysian Rice Noodles with Smoked Squid - This combo did not go down very well. Smoked Squid should preferably be had as a starter. I particularly didnt find Malaysian Rice Noodles preparation extremely tasty. It was mediocre to taste.
*STAFF BEHAVIOUR*
The service was quick and prompt. Staff was polite. The price of food is very reasonable here compared to the quality and quantity.

This was on my to-visit list for a long time and finally it happened last week when a friend decided to treat me and out colleagues over there. The ambiance is nice, though a bit small. One might perceive it to be cozy. Anyway, the place lives up to people's expectations. The tribal dishes are finger lickin' good. The bansa pora mutton and chicken were very nice but I felt it to be a bit over hyped. Although it might be due to the fact that we ordered near their closing time. The jhupu pishir mangsho was a lot better. The fried prawns were not good at all. The squid I didn't taste as I don't have an affinity of sorts for exotic dishes. The jado was nice. The chicken korigassi was simply great. The green gravy looked a bit weird but the taste of it trumped even the chicken. I could've just had the gravy and be contented. Much recommended. Plan to visit again soon.

Santa's Fantasea, in the alley opposite Sony centre Golpark,

heard a lot of hype over this place, mostly for their tribal and seafood cuisine.lineup. After a short planning I along with a group of 5, visited this place on last Saturday for a different type of lunch.

Arrived around 1:30, the place looked a bit shabby from outside. I felt nothing appealing, although Saltlake Sector 1 outlet looks much better from outside.

As we pushed our way in, we were greeted and showed a table for 6. Again quite a small place from inside. Well decorated in a tribal theme. I liked their interior design. It was airy and well lit. Staffs were kind of mixed. Some were professional and a few were like 'boys' who show up to and fro to serve water and all. Yet good mannered.

Coming to the food, we ordered Bansh pora chicken, Bansh pora mutton and patra pora mutton. Initial impressions for the chicken was good, well cooked. Patra pora came in very late during main course which was also great. However, Bansh pora mutton was not much appreciated. Spices were not properly cooked and ready to serve. Smell of Jeera was in very amount everyone in table complained.

In the main we ordered, Seafood Malaysian Rice, Seafood Malayasian Noodles, Smoked Octopus, Teryaki Chicken, Jhupupisir mutton speciality and Soru chakli. Coming to one at a time, Rice and Noodles were almost same as the name suggests, dont know why its green in color, which I disliked personally. Tasted ok nothing as special.

Smoked octopus was a utter nonsense. A couple of my friends ordered to taste it here but both found it was too smelly and chewy to eat. More than half of the dish was wasted. I did not prefer to eat.

Teriyaki chicken was good although bell peppers were almost uncooked and felt raw to eat. I had no I idea of what soru chakli was, almost felt like Malpoa, a sweetdish, without the sweetness.

Jhupupisir mutton speciality was worth mentioning of the lot. Really tasty, not a lot of spices, just right. Soru chakli with this was a good idea.

In the end we had deserts. Two options available and we ordered both. The kheer and payes both felt good and I was quite surprised to taste these two dish. Good one.

Pocket pinch was normal although I cant say it is easy on the bugdet. Because the quantity is not sufficient and there are better options nearby. Price to quantity ratio need to be improved. Especially the main course items.

Recommended for sea food lovers only.

Voksh Meh
Bansh pora chickn
Soru chakli
Wild red rice
Teriyaki Fish
Sanghai squid
Beijing Noodles
Unfortunately this time we were not welcomed with their welcome drink. Never the less lets come to the food we ordered. All the items we ordered were fresh and tasty bt special mention would be for the Sanghai squid and the Teriyaki fish.. I have never tasted something that good.. The bhetki was fresh and smoking hot and it just melted in my mouth.. It was an awesome experience.. Would like to visit this place again and again.

Last Saturday i went to Golpark branch for first time with some mixed recommendations. Ordered squid, sea food soup, bash pora mutton,some ruti with that,octopus etc. Seat arrangement and table size is painfully small .once food will be placed you cant even place your sunglass on table top.Mutton was tasteless ,as we had to seek some salt to finish that.Total disappointment.Next octopus ,total rubbery and in one word bad preparation. So all together felt disappointed. Lastly they DO NOT ACCEPT CARD PAYMENT . So one suggestion Look before you leap..  Ufffff....But had to rate 1.0 to post this

Full marks for creativity in serving seafood. This restaurant just happens to be there in a boring Kolkata lane. But once you enter, it is a different world. They serve you a welcome drink which is some staple drink of some tribe they have based their theme on. Despite the not so favorable welcome drink, the food menu is interesting. Go ahead, experiment. It will be worth it.

I was pretty psyched to be visiting their outlet, with the amout of referrals I have been getting from my friends. So as I walked into their facility the first thing that caught my attention was the decor.. There was a seafood themed section and another was the tribal themed section. Though the decor and the lighting was mismatched, but still it can be overlooked. 
But the food was absolutely scrupmtious. I had the seafood topping rice, smoked king crab and the honey chilli prawn. The food did not let me down. Did not have had a better quality of sea food in a long long time.
Baring the seats which can be tad uncomfortable for some, since they are just pure bamboo seats, I think full marks in most of the quarters. A little improvement in the ambience and the infrastrucre can make a mighty difference I believe.
Still, just awesome sea food... Awesome! Definitely worth the price and a riot of flavors for the tongue.

One scorching afternoon and the proposed fantasy called us in! The place was quite tiny, table for two too constricted for accommodating numerous orders. As for the ambience of which we didn't have much since we were made to sit in the tiny non AC room; as the table for four had to be saved for what appeared to be no one till the end of 1.5 hours. The order of konkan salad was quite savoury though a tad bit spicy.However Malaysian fried rice tickled our taste buds unexpectedly as did the dragon pepper squid which by the way had the gravy similar in taste to the konkan salad. We ended the course with tilhou(onion) and chemmen(prawn) kheer both of which were delicious and previously untasted delicacies.

Alright, so I had been hearing a lot about this place for a year but never got the chance to go until 2 days ago. I had innumerable expectations in my mind as I had read the reviews but did it keep up with all those expectations? Umm, kind of yes. We ordered the much hyped bansa pora mutton which was honestly shit. Also, the meat was smelling of goat. Yes. You read it right. But I cannot deny the deliciousness of the octopus and the sea food supreme soup. Again, the crab meat momo was more of veg momo as I could not taste any bit of the crab meat. Anyway, if you love sea food and you want to taste octopus and by octopus I mean proper octopus without making a hole in your pocket, then this is your place.

I visited this outlet with my cousin and a friend.  I almost forgot to upload the photos and write a review.
Lemme begin by confessing this fact that it was my 1st time regarding tasting seafood. Santa's interiors are quite good but personally I did not like the seating arrangements.
We had ordered : 
Seafood soup
Shanghai squid
Chilli wine tuna
Oyster chilli basil octopus
Beijing rice noodles
Seafood soup was good. I did not taste the octopus. Based on my cousin's feedback, the octopus was well prepared. 
The star dish was Shanghai squid. I can go to this place innumerable times for this one particular dish. It was tangy and spicy with a burst of flavours in your mouth accompanied by the crunch of the squid itself.
The tuna fish had a smell which I disliked.
The Beijing rice noodles were good with proper quantity of prawns and squid in it.
All in all it was a good experience. The service was also ok. 
I am in love with the Shanghai Squid :D

This place is definitely recommended.

Went for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. The place was quite crowded. The decor & ambiance isn't really mind-blowing , even the service 7 staff wasn't really fast paced. Now, when I was starting to dislike the place, came in the famous Bansh-pora mutton delicacy, which made me forget all the cons & all I was concentrating on the smokey aromatic texture of the food. Even though the rice dish & the octopus(was too rubbery) we tried were not really great, but nevermind, banshpora mutton compensated on their behalf!!!! Would certainly come back for that one dish of theirs..!!!

Located just 5 mins walking distance from Golpark, this restaurant is as good as the ratings on zomato suggest. Had visited this place for dinner on a weekday and it was full, but luckily I got the table in 5 mins. The ambience of the place is nice and rustic. We ordered bansa pora mutton, soru chakli and malaysian noodles. 
The mutton was soft and succulent, but I just felt that the seasoning could be better.  However the texture, smell and look of the dish was great. The chakli was a kind of thin roti and very tasty. An average person can easily eat 3 rotis. The noodles were different and okay. 
The staff was polite and courteous,  but they could have been trained better. Overall a nice experience and a place to visit again. 
Note- there is very limited options for veg users.

This place surely serves one of the best sea foods in Kolkata. The octopus and squid is to die for. The place has everything in store for a sumptuous lunch/dinner.
However, the place falls short in this lighting and seating space. The two-seater tables should be better arranged. And obviously the lighting. If hanging lights or some tribal style lighting ways , such as kerosene lamps can be used, I think k, it will add to the excellent interior decorations. 
But u r going to come out of the restaurant , with a full and happy stomach!! :D

This is the new hip and happening joint around with lots of people heading out to here. Went there once with my sister and it was fun. We had Jadoh (which is supposed to be made of pork and pork blood, but here they use mutton) and Burnt Chilli Octopus (first time I tried octopus). They were out of squid, the day we went so that was a bit disappointing. The Jadoh is quite tasty and the octopus really had a lot of flavour though I'd have liked to have a greater quantity of octopus in that dish. Overall a fresh experience for me and my tastebuds.

Order Bansh pora mutton and chicken - liked the mutton more, it was clearly a preparation for red meat. Then I ordered Schezwan Octopus, it was good. It wasn't over-frozen octopus, which added to the flavour and probably it was marinated to remove the stink. Do recommend. Ordered smoked fish, expected it to be ddry with spices on it, but it was supposedly sme kindof an orinetal/asian dish, drowned in gravy and lathered in Garlic, it was good - just that I don't want everything in the same preparation. Took away Red wild rice and 'Khukura ka maas' chicken (also the same dish as the fish and the octopus) which I expected to be tribal. Oh well, it was good, but variety was very limited. Will try out the squid next time! :)

Last week, I have been there, though I have to wait more than 40 Minute  as the management team was a bit lacking, table was empty and they didnot even bother to ask people ot come and sit while it was empty, I have to kept on barge in and ask them.

But let me tell you the food was awsm, Best sea food I have ever had.

We had

1> Teriyarki Chicken

2>Smoked Octopus

3>Seafood Malyasian Rice

4> Banspora Chicke (The best among all )

So I want to recommend you all to visit the restaurant once to taste this kind of tribal and seafood delight.it's a sad that I dint get Crab in lunch time.. I was disappointed I would like them to request to avail CRAB in lunch time also.

Beautiful cozy interiors and seating arrangements. Although the space is a bit small but they made good use of it. About the food, it's delicious. I am not much of a seafood fan but yes the tribal foods are exotic. We had Jardoh rice ( amazing spicy stuff straight from the state of Mizoram), Malaysian seafood rice, Dragon pepper fish (again spicy and too good). Finally the delicacy of this place, Baash pora chicken and mutton. Although I am not a red meat fan but yes the mutton tasted better than the chicken, since it retained the smoky taste better. We also ordered the Santa's special seafood soup but I tasted just a spoon and a piece of squid, it was not bad. Staff behavior is very pleasing, nice ambience. Overall do visit this place, specially if you are going on a date for the first time and he/she ia a foodie. Don't miss it. The pocket pinch is reasonably fair, affordable and worth it.

This place was on my wishlist for a long time in order to try out their much talked about dish-Bansa pora chicken.But after eating there,I just had one word in my mind-OVERRATED. We ordered Fried prawn momos,Wild red rice & Bansa pora chicken.The outer covering of the momos was very hard & the filling inside was tasteless. The rice was again hard & chewy & had a very different kind of flavour which I did not like.It had the smell of raw rice grains..The chicken was good though not as awesome as people say.
Prices are cheap & inclusive of taxes.Service & ambience are decent..but if you go towards the kitchen side its unclean.And so is the washroom.

Located near Anjali Jewellers and South city college, golpark, this place is a must visit. They specialize in tribal  and sea food. The d√©cor goes perfectly with the theme of the restaurant. I have been to this place so many times and it remains pretty crowded always. dishes that one must try are ‚Äì Seafood Topping noodles, Canton Noodles, Oyster Chilly Basil Squid and Smoked Fish and off course Bansa Pora Mutton. But I was not really happy with the crab momo and crispy fried prawns.

The service is  fast and the staff is helpful. The quantity is good and full-filling. It‚Äôs quite pocket friendly. Overall a great place and a must visit for all seafood lovers

The presence of tribal paintings,wall hangings,little artifacts will just set your mood. Then a rice drink(welcome drink) will be served in  a glass made of bamboo. My God!The drink is so refreshing. Wild red rice,jadoh,bansh pora,kori gassi,naga mutton dish, jhupu pishi's mutton delicacy,patra pora are my personal favorites. I also liked their sea food menu. Smoked fish,squid octopus are extremely tasty. Loved the tribal desert prawn kheer and onion kheer.

Heard about this place a lot so went to try out some seafood n tribal cuisine.
Decent ambience n decor but personally I didn't liked anything except the bash pora mutton.
The wild red rice was awful even the pan fried mongolian fish.
They said it would be spicy but it was real blunt.
Though the service was great the food is below average.
I scored it 3 just on the basis of the authentic tribal setup.

This is one of the best places to eat for anyone who loves seafood. The variations, the tribal food, the decor, the ambience, the helpful staff - everything makes it an experience to remember! Even if you are the one to order the same item in every restaurant you visit, Santa's Fantasea will surprise you. And yes, Banshpora Mutton is a must have!

'Wow' would be the first thing i am going to write and that should probably say everything. Nevertheless, it was a great sea food experience for me. I am so in love with both the interior decoration and of course the food.

The Baans Phora... Amazing and a must try.
The Sea food Noodles and Rice(Malaysian and the latter was Chinese), were equally tasty. Less in oil, which is a huge plus point. The Mutton ribs were also good. All the things available are a must try. Unfortunate for us, we couldn't get Crab Momos which i was expecting a lot.
Anyway, the weekend dinner to Santa's Fantasea has been worth. Sea food lovers and  those who want to try out tribal food, this is your destination.

I won't be judging about the quality of the food, no doubt it was good. But somewhere or the other I felt that the delicacy was missing. Their sea food is undoubtedly the best in Kolkata, as they are the only one to serve some really good ones. Now coming to the hygiene and ambience, it irritated me a bit. Such a big restro is expected to give a space for a proper washroom or hand wash area, and it was deeply missing here. The ambience was good, not so appealing but it works if the food is good. Anyways, if you are expecting for a change from the routine food, visit here. The best part is squid. I couldn't try out the Tuna as it was unavailable. Octopus sounds appealing but you will slowly start disliking it.

Great and great.... had a pleasant tasty hangout. Been there with my friend to celebrate. The interior decor and theme was nice, refreshing. The staff were well behaved and helpful. Now Coming to food. Ordered from the santhali section. The bamboo chicken had a raw taste and smell which lingers in the mouth for a long time. Exceptionally beautiful. Next was jhuppu pisi mutton which was spicy but had a great taste. One of the finest that i had tasted. We had iy with the santhali rice ( the waiter helped with the order). Never i had tasted such a beautiful dish.


The food from seafood section was mediocre. Not too good not too bad.. just okkayish. One thing i didint like is that at the end the head waiter asked for the money/ tip personally and kept on barging for that. Though the food was good this behaviour irked me. Overall very good place. A truly deviation from traditional restaurant dishes.

Went to this place with bae on 15th of April. Poila boishakh. It was his first time to try seafood.i was very excited. Umm we tried Fantasea special seafood soup... which was absolutely delicious.  We had Cantonese seafood mixed noodles.. and with that we had honey chilly squid (which was soooo squishy and juicy and tasty) and pan fried octopus. (Bae loved this was one because it was more on the spicy side)  i have to say this the food is so amazing here... and the price rounded up about 700 bucks which is cheap i must say for four seafood dishes. No added tax. Loved the decor. Loved the place. Will go again to try tribal food.

If you are a big foodie but conscious about having oily food,here is a place you can enjoy to your heart's content. Best time to go is during the first quarter of the evening to get accommodation as later the place gets packed up. Firstly,here is a restaurant where you can eat 4 different items for 2 people within the range of Rs 1000...so its really cheap. Secondly food quality is awesome... go for 3 things, banshpora mutton-shoruchakli rooti combo(didnt prefer rice as you wont be able to eat more), crab filled momo and red wine chilly octopus... well octopus is superb..will taste like ‡¶ï‡¶ö‡¶ï‡¶ö‡¶ø. And yes..there are no service taxes involved here like KFC nd other restoz.. So eat,pray and love :)

Santa's Fantasea is one of the best restaurants that I have been to recently. Contrary to what the name suggests, there is nothing Christmasy about it, but the tribal decor will surely impress you. The menu is unique combination of seafood and tribal cuisines. We ordered their famous 'banshpora mutton' which is a must try. The mutton is tender and the flavor of smoked bamboo and spices blends perfectly into it. We also tried their wild red rice, which is little of the spicy side, but mouthwatering. From their seafood menu we tried the chilli oyster basil squid which was also very flavorsome. But my favorite was the Chemmen Kheer which translates into prawn kheer. It took me a lot of courage to try this mind boggling dish and I loved it. I was also looking forward to try the Tankha Turani drink, but it unfortunately has been discontinued.¬†
It is also friendly on the pocket.

We went on a Thurs however the place was pretty crowded.
I loved there wall painting n also the ceiling fish paint with fish hanging style.
The service was really bad because it took too long for them to give us a thumbs bottle n d bill took tym as well after asking two or three staff.
Coming to the food... We ordered Malaysian Rice..Pepper Squid n Patro Pora.
Food was yummy..awesome..authentic tribal food.
If the service improves m sure I would like to come back again..but the food is definetly great.

Third time down the line, this place has been one of my favourite food hubs since the very first time I visited it. On my first visit, I tried their trademark dish #BansaPoraChicken and during my second round of visit I made my friends try this dish and won some pats. Chicken cooked in spices and imbibed in the flavour of Bansa (bamboo) gave me a divine feeling. I am a squid lover and I have tried various delicacies of the seafood in this restaurant and was never put down. The infusion of great ambience and delicious food earns 5 stars from me, for this restaurant, in the first review itself!

For many days I have kept a wish in my mind to visit here and finally my wish has been fulfilled today when I visited here with my beau.
Located Opposite of Ramkrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Golpark, more specifically in the lane of Anjali Jewellers.
Its well decorated with some tribal masks, tribal marks which can create a different ambience from the city life.

We have ordered Wild Red Rice, Bansh(Bamboo) pora Chicken and Smoked Octopus. Quantity was enough for two of us. Quality was superb though the bashpora chicken was a bit let down to me. Staffs are well mannered and its a pocket friendly restaurant for us, for everybody's information currently they are not accepting payment with cards. The Octopus dish has really won my heart.
P.S - A special thanks to

Santa's Fantasea

Location : Inside the lane beside Anjali Jewellers at Golpark.

Ambience : Nice..Would have given them a 5 star if the cooling in the last sitting place was good.

Service : Fast and staff were courteous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a long time wish for me and my partner to visit this place....We had heard very nice things about this eatery from many of our friends..and after long wait we finally went in last Thursday for dinner....We reached around 8:30 PM and the place was almost packed....We were asked to sit in the last room.....

The decor of the place is nice matching with the tribal cuisines...But the last room had no AC and it was a bit hot with just a ¬†single fan...

We had ordered :
Bansh Pora Mutton
Wild Red Rice
Chilly Wine Octopus
Ngatok
Soru Chakli

The Bansh pora mutton was very tasty...the taste was awesome and the mutton were very tender..
The wild red rice was not a great hit..It was supposed to be spicy but we didn't find it spicy...
The Chilly Wine Octopus was excellent...The gravy was awesome and the octopus were cooked well...It was the first time I tasted Octopus and I liked it
The ngatok was the best dish we ordered...Cooked with spices in a banana leaf it tasted awesome....It took time to prepare but it was worth the wait....

Overall we had a great experience with the food and service...Would definitely visit again...

Finally THE santas fantasea, a long overdue.Its located in the lane by The Anjali Jewellers a few blocks away.From the outside the look up to it may not be so appealing but once u r in surely u will be transported to a different place.The seating space is quite small considering its huge popularity.There are 2sections-one where the walls are decorated with tribal painings and the other were there fishes and other sea animals decorating it.The tables were made of bamboo anf the glasses were earthen giving u a tribal look.
Coming to the food as we were a group of 11,we ordered a variety of dishes -The favourite Bansh pora Mutton,Shanghai Squid,Seafood Beijing Rice,Seafood Canton rice,  Seafood Topping rice and noodles, Crack leaves baby corn,Wild Red rice and Soru Chakli.
The bansh pora chicken with its a bit burnt taste cooked in bamboo goes well with the soru chakli which itself was tasteless.My personal favourite wasbthe Shanghai Squid which were soft crispy squid pieces.  Personally i liked The noodles a bit better than the Rice, Tye noodles contained all variety of seafoods mixed,The wild red rice was red rice which goes well with the Banshpora.
Only negativity was the unavailablility of the dessert as we went around the afrernoon closing time.
Overall a great seafood gastrocnomic experience.Surely if u are a seafood lover and faj of themed restaurant, do visit here.

When u have  a large team size, add to ur advantage of tasting the huge range of varieties..
Bashpora chicken , bashpora mutton, teriyaki fish, basil chili octopus, draggon pepper squid... I dont remember half of the names while writing the review. 
Just a recommendation if u guys r serving kori gashi chicken and kerala mutton soup, kindly change the name to some chinese and thai dish respectively. Agreed there is coconut, corriander and chilies to add south indian flavour. Unfortunately they tasted like chinese and thai dishes..
Due to the space constraint and the hard wooden chairs am knocking it down to 3.5. Could have bagged 4 or 4.5 if the chairs are bit comfortable to sit..

I am very late to visit this place. Finally had the chance today. I reached early as I had heard there is a queue and waiting time. Thankfully we got seats but the place already had few tables occupied. Reached around 6 40 pm.

Located near the the Anjali Jewellers showroom. Just enter in the lane beside the showroom and a stone's throw away is  Santa's Fantasea. 

Brightly decorated. The seating near the entrance highlights the sea food part of the menu with lots of colourful show fishes hanging by and a bunch of fishes drawn on the blue walls. The inside area showcases the tribal look of the menu. With lots of tribal masks and thatched false roofs made.

Coming to the food. I had got a lot suggestions from my colleagues who are regulars here so I ordered everything according to their suggestion barring one dish.
Started of with bansh pora chicken and the rotis. The chicken had a charred taste as it is roasted inside the bamboo. It needed to be a bit more soft and cooked more. The pieces were chewy. It went well with the ultra soft rotis. Although the rotis themselves don't have any taste but it goes well with the chicken.
Next on the list was the smoked octopus. Baby octopuses cooked in a kafir lime, lemon grass sauce. Overloaded with garlic just the way I love. The sauce was perfectly balanced flavour wise. This was followed by Malaysian fried rice and burnt garlic prawns. The rice is green in colour and loaded with shrimp and squid pieces. 8 pieces of prawn lightly fried in a batter and coated in a gravy made with soya sauce, dry red chillies. 
Upon suggestion from the person taking the order we took teriyaki sauce chicken instead of dragon chicken. The chicken pieces again were a bit hard. Needed to be cooked some more. I felt the different sauces were really good than the main ingredients. 
For dessert I was really skeptical in ordering the onion Kheer but it turned out really well. Kudos to the chef for making this dish. The onion smell and pungency was no where there. The sweetness was perfectly balanced. All of this was accompanied by a thums up pet bottle.

The service was really good. The waiters were polite and super fast in their work. 

I loved the fact that their menu is all inclusive of the taxes. The bill came to 1470 after eating so much.

All the best to the management and team.

Ambience: You enter and understand that the 'tribal' theme is everywhere.. the walls; the utensils and the furniture.

Service: The service was prompt and the waiters were friendly too..

Food: Ofcourse we had the FAMOUS Baansh Pora chicken. It was heavenly. Beautifully cooked; the gravy; the smoky flavour of the chicken being cooked in the bamboo.. It was a real treat!!
Then we had Seafood Malaysian Noodles; chicken Malaysian Noodles; seafood Noodles and Red Rice.

The malaysian noodles was my absolute favorite.. The shrimps Prawns and Squids were cooked to Perfection!!

I loved the place and I cannot wait to go and try out their other dishes :D

Till now the best seafood restaurant i came across, wonderful ambiance and great food. they not only serve great seafood but they also serve great tribal food, bashpora mutton taste awesome <3, squids, octopus taste great, however the service is slow and there is no door man to notify you with the seat arrangements or the crowd. but this factor can be neglected with the awesome food they serve and the ambiance it have right from the first step to the glasses the roof and the way of service is simply a class apart. A good restaurant for family, friends, colleague and of course the food lovers of kolkata. The prices of the food items are budget friendly, hope they keep up the good work and serve more foods for foodies like me.

This was my 3rd visit. Recently seeing the huge word of mouth publicity they have steeply increased the rates by 30%. 

Crispy Fried Prawn Rs 200 to Rs 260 in one go.

Quality is acceptable  but 1 portion of Banspora Chicken is not even enough for one person. And given the price Rs 280 for such a small portion I must say this place is not value of money at all.

For Chinese dishes you hardly get 8 small pieces of Chicken for Rs 240.

So if money is something you don't bother about at all then you can easily try this place.

Can be called an exotic resturant easily. One of its kind, its tribal menu is quite impressive. Welcome drink of Tankha Turani and then followed by an elaborate meal can give you an out of gourmet world experience. And behold.....its very pocket friendly!!

For the first time tried the much vaunted Bans Pora Mutton. Didn't have the smoky taste it was supposed to have. The green Malayasian Seafood fried rice was superlative! Schezewan pepper fish was as it should be. The Pepper Crab tastes good but may be difficult to negotiate for many (you have to use both hands - no other way to break the shells to get at the meat). For dessert, the Onion Kheer tasted like normal Kheer - but that is an achievement I suppose - because there really was shredded onion in it! Haven't tried the Prawn Kheer; maybe that will be more interesting.
Decor is interesting.
There is no waiting place inside if the tables are full. Better to reach by 1 pm for lunch if u r going on a Saturday/Sunday & by 8 pm in the evening if u want to avoid waiting outside on the road. Car parking is an issue here!

We went to take away food for dinner on 17th May and below are my observations.

Firstly, though it was a weekday, the place was absolutely filled with customers and people waiting outside.

Anyways, the place is very small compared to the seating arrangement which makes ventilation an issue for people waiting.

Having said and felt the same, I proceeded with placing the order. The manager somehow came across displaying a high handed approach who didn't bother to even switch on the small mounted fan until asked.Neither did he even bother to offer a glass of water. These may be come across small issues but goes a very long way in serving customers.While ordering, I enquired about the amount of gravy served and he non- chalantly said that it will not be like "macher jhol" which to me was really offensive. A customer can and will have questions regarding the food which they are paying for and such an attitude will never help an outlet to survive in the longer run.

We had to actually come down to the place as the outlet and their only delivery partner is Swiggy who due to some technical reason was not able to fulfill delivery requirements of this outlet for the week.

Now coming to the food, below is what we ordered and our observations:

Dragon Pepper Fish-It was Red Snapper which was melt in the mouth and spicy which was to our liking.

Teriyaki Chicken-It was way too spicy to our liking though we wanted it to be extra spicy but I guess the cook could not control the level of spice required just like the Manager couldn't control his attitude.

Seafood Malaysian Rice-It was just about okay though was green in colour and not sure why.

The total amount came to Rs 730/- including all charges.

Very nice place. Food is awesome. Ambience and decor was nice. Food is very tasty and unique here. Bansa pora chicken is toOo good with soru chakli. Tribal food and sea food both were very nice. I tasted octopus for the first time here. It was nice. Squid is also good.

I have been to this place twice in the last one month and I usually do not visit the same restaurant so often. That I guess makes this place really special for me and trust me it is! Amazing food coupled with great service have made this place one of my favourites in Calcutta. Seafood salad, banspora chicken and mutton, fried pepper tuna, soru chakli, Malaysian seafood rice- all the dishes I have had over here are really delicious (other than the tuna which was not really match up to my expectations). A definite must go for all the foodies out there. Give your fantasies a little jolt!

This is a perfect place for food lovers. 
Decor - Tribal look has been given to the restaurant. 
Food - 1. Baans pora chicken - Soft, smokey and yumm. This dish is one of a kind and a must have. 
2. Sanghai squid - This is my favourite. It is crunchy and delectable. 
3. Smoke squid - This is not as tasty as the sanghai squid. So go for the sanghai one. 
4. Octupus in wine - The little octopuses seemed rubbery so thumbs down for this one. 
5. Mongolian noodles - Again a must try. 
 Staff - The waiters are friendly and they patiently explain the details of dish to every customer.

Bansh pora chicken/mutton. This is the best dish I like there. Having eaten in various tribal food restaurants, this is okayish. May be there needs to be more competition in this cuisine in Kolkata. Apart from that, other dishes r standard. If u want to taste squid, Hatari is a better option. As of now, this is the restaurant providing one of the best tribal cuisine in the city.

An easy to locate diner right at the heart of South Kolkata...it's located a few paces off the Anjali Jewellers showroom which falls left on the way from Golpark to Dhakuria

As you enter you are greeted by a warm and hospitable staff members...the decor is beautiful...while some of the walls depict an underwater scene which gives you a feel of sitting in an aquarium,some walls depict the tribal indian household(with the "petol er glass" and all).

I visited with my girlfriend and we ordered wild red rice, chicken bansapora and a crab dish...the crab was only okayish...but the red rice and the bansapora chicken was par excellence!!...a must have!!

Not only is the food good,it is pretty affordable as well...looking forward to future visits and tasting some exotic seafood this time

As with most reviewers , I wanted to try this place as it was much talked about. So quite honestly I was very excited when I eventually could make it here. 

¬†Well to come directly to the food , it did not at all live to my expectations in some parts it was pretty bad actually.

We ordered Shanghai Squid, Steamed  Crab Momo, Wild Red Rice and Kori Gassi. 

¬†The Shanghai Squid was pretty average , I liked the Wild Red Rice with its cinnamon flavor  , but the real disappointment were the Crab Momo and the Kori Gassi. The steamed momo was cold, tasteless and pathetic, I had to leave the plate as it is. The crab stuffing itself seemed to be made with Gadre crab sticks and was not seasoned properly nor was the outer coating done well, a total disappointment.

Coming to the Kori Gassi ( a green chicken dish basically) , the gravy was average but the chicken pieces in itself felt as if I was having cornflour dumpling, tasteless again.

I would also like to mention that a visit to the washroom could easily cause you to throw up.

I would definitely like to give this place a miss.

Went to the restaurant after checking the Zomato reviews. A little gem for any foodie nestled in a by lane in Golpark. First the d√©cor of the place is very vibrant and instantly you feel you are in a tribal area. The menu is also very interesting with a combination of tribal and seafood. We ordered chicken momo, smoked fish, banshpora mutton, soru chakli, and chili Honey prawns. Smoked fish was out of the world. Prawns were very succulent. Soru chakli was nice. Banshpora mutton, their signature dish, was tasty but I personally found the fish and prawns more delicious. Definitely a paradise for a foodie. Will definitely visit again to try their other dishes. Keep up the good work.

A seafood lover's paradise and complete value for money. It's tiny so you might have to wait. We were given a tribal welcome drink and ordered steamed crab and prawn momos which were delicious. The seafood fried rice was yum but the Shanghai octopus was a wee bit too rubbery for my liking.

Finally got a chance to have dinner here. I was well prepared to be blown away by the place since I had heard so much, but in spite of it all the place took me by surprise. Each of the dishes were exquisite and they tasted amazing. We started off with Kerala mutton soup and steamed crab momo..the soup was delectable while the momo was a bit of a little down since they weren't juicy enough. We went to have shoru chakli roti and bansa pora chicken. Delicious!!! Next we had seafood Beijing rice and seafood canton noodles. We ordered crabck leave squid and teriyaki chicken as sides for the main. The quantity was really good and the taste of each of the dishes created a heady mix. Such a great place and such great food!! Will be coming back for more!

I went Santa's Fantasea with my boyfriend..It is situated near golpark anjali jewellers. The restaurant is decorated with tribal decoration. we ordered bash pora chicken(tribal dish), jadoh(tribal dish), oyster basil octopus.. bash pora chicken was looking different... but taste is not that different. Jadoh is a rice "mota chal" preparation with small mutton pieces.. and the octopus dish was very good.It was spicy but good. We asked for desserts and trival drinks..But those were not available.overall experience is good.

This place definitely deserves every bit of praise that it gets. The place serves amazing food at really affordable prices. My best friend and I visited this place a few days back and boy we had a feast. We started with Crispy Fried Prawns which was really amazing. The batter was a bit too much I think, but the prawns were cooked well and the batter was crispy too. My friend though found some veins in the prawns.
Next we had Malaysian Seafood Rice with Dragon pepper fish. Another cracker dish. The rice is definitely one of the best fried rice I've had. A MUST try! The fish was also really really delicious! It wasn't exactly flaky but the flavours were just so good that it hardly mattered. 
Then we had the patra pora mutton which was stellar. It looked really good and the taste was nothing short of impeccable! We also tried some thing from the tribal menu the name of which I can't remember but it was something like uttapam except it was thinner and basically its made a good substitute for roti while having mutton. 
The food was simply great! The ambience is also quite pleasant and welcoming. I quite liked the chairs. 
The bill along with a bottle of Pepsi came to just 980 rupees. There is no additional tax either. What you see is what you pay. 
You definitely don't want to miss out on this place if you haven't been here yet! 
So hurry and have a wonderful time! 
Happy Dining!

The wait is over.Finally got some time to catch up this one with family. This is the first time i tried a sea food restro. This one is very easy to find,inside a short lane aside Anjali jewellers. It just takes 2 minutes. Coming to the food,we orderd baansh pora chicken which was mind blowing. I liked the way the chicken was diced into pieces with the tandoori flovour incurred in it. Next up is the jadoh and malaysian sea rice. The jadoh was too good to comment anything. This was one of the best rice preaparation i had till date. The other one i ddn't try. Along with this we had teriyaki fish and dragon pepper chicken.. The chicken item was a little spicy but tasty.. And the fish was well cooked. Overall it was an awesome experience and next time want to try out the octopus and squid preaparation.

Was dieing to try this out after all the great reviews I had heard about this joint,Even though space issues made us wait for 30 mins but boy was it worthwhile.Every dish ordered was heavenly and tasted like it was a labour of love.
1.For starters we ordered Shanghai squid,which btw was the the most tender and crispy preparation of squid I have ever tasted.
2.Then for main course was the Patra Pora ,which can probably stake claim for the crown of best dish in the city right now,also the cult favourite bash pora chicken,the flames coming out of the burned bamboo sticks,the taste of which heightens the flavours. We had it with the rice with mutton dices,completly succulent,gave me a feeling of having home cooked food.
3.Topped all of it with the onion kheer,I have to@ take my hats off to the chef for this one as he/she did such a marvelous job I couldn't even believe I was having a desert made of onions(no matter how weird that sounds)
Loved the decor,wall paintings and hangings,great ambience,even greater time spent.

We walked into this bustling crowded restuarant, silently hoping that we could get a table. All we needed was some good lunch.And to our delight we did. We finaly decided on Bansa Pora Chicken, Wine Chilli Mushroom and Soru Chakli. The Chicken tasted heavenly- it was spicy and gives off a smoky piquancy of burnt bamboo- which makes it different than all other meats I have ever had. The Mushroom was soft and had a sweet and sour flavour. Perfectly compliments the smoky flavour chicken. The Chakli was soft and yielding in my mouth. It perfectly compliments the Chicken and the Mushroom.
The staff was very friendly.
As for the ambience, I loved it.

I visited this branch only once. But it was my 1st time and i enjoyed a lot on that visit we ordered from their sea food section. Food is too good but i was surprised by their service quality, it was excellent. They served a welcome drinks, they help me to understand my order as it is a theme restaurant not all the food is commonly available in other places. I will recommend everyone if you're planing to visit this place please don't mix your order with seafood and with tribal food please visit at least twice to enjoy both of their theme food. It is economical if you want to wow your gust but you are careful about your pocket this place is ideal and the best part is 'vat and tax are included'.

This place is truely a hidden gem in Kolkata.

For a long time I wanted to visit this tribal restaurant. And after all this days I finally visited this place today evening with two of my friends. 
It's pretty easy to locate. Just take the narrow Lane beside anjali jewellers in golpark more. 


It's indeed a small place and you may have to wait for a while to get your seats. 
The ambiance is good. And with such beautiful art all around, it will make you feel wonderful. 

Today we ordered - 

1. Lal gosht -
We thought it to be something which will have gravy instead it's just minced meat with spices formed into tikkis. And they serve it with imli chutney. The taste was absolutely perfect. Though one of my friend find it a little bit dry. 

2.  Seafood Malaysian rice - 
This one is absolutely perfect. I loved the fresh and refreshing flavours of the herbs. 

3. Smoked squid - 
This dish will definately hit your taste buds, with the beautiful blend of sweet , sour and heat. And the smokey flavour was good. 

Though we were on a low budget today but still I would love to visit this place again and try some more amazing foods that includes 'baansh pora mutton' 
Something I always wanted to try :) 

Recomended.

Located on the lane right beside Anjali Jewelers' in Golpark, this small eatery isn't hard to find.

This place has a tribal vibe to it with all those tribal show pieces and a huge tribal mask sculpture on the wall.

The staff is very courteous. Full points for service.

We ordered:
1)Laal gosht
2)Seafood Malaysian rice
3)Smoked squid

1) I expected the laal gosht to be a thick rich spicy mutton gravy (which is the traditional dish), but instead we were served 3 pieces of what seemed like 'tikkis'. Minced mutton mixed with spices, formed into 'tikkis',supposedly baked, topped with cilantro and served with a tangy sweet tamarind chutney. The tikki was a bit dry in my opinion. Taste was awesome and it went well with the chutney. Pretty nice.

2) Seafood Malaysian rice. Well, we ordered two plates this rice, which they served it in a single bowl and I have to say I am not at all happy with the quantity(check the pictures). It was basically rice tossed with shrimps and squids, and was greenish in color. I loved the taste.

3) smoked squid : Pretty nice. Squid in some sort of spicy sauce  flavored with kafil lime leaves and lemongrass.

Overall a good experience. Recommended.

Located at the lane beside Anjali Jewellers in Golpark, this restaurant had been an enthralling hit down the past among foodies from the nooks and corners of Kolkata. Hence, I have so much about this restaurant that I decided to give a go at this some few days back ! But little did I know that I would come out with an experience I would not like to remember. Let me elaborate on the same :

LOCATION : Not easily visible. But well, all knows it going by the popularity.

DECOR : A nice tribal decoration with furniture complimenting the set up.

FOOD : Well the main part which failed to live upto my expectations (Can be because I have had too high an expectation on this one). Ordered Banspora Mutton and Soru Chakli, a rice-mix made roti, and a Teriyaki Chicken. The Banspora was cold and so was the Chakli. Banspora Mutton dices even had less spices and oil that it was ought to be ! The Teriyaki Chicken was a disaster as it caused a burning sensation in my throat lining throughout the evening. The taste was okayish though.

SERVICE : The biggest letdown for me was the service. As me and my friend entered the restaurant, we found it was almost empty with hardly a table occupied. I asked the attendant whether we can comfortably sit on a four seater ! He didn't allow us and instead made us sit on a two seater table which hardly had space to keep two plates on it. So, we couldn't even take photographs of the dishes as there were no place to fit them in. Also, the seats were too uncomfortable ! Moreover, the staffs were serious and lacked a smile for the guests to feel better.

Overall, may be I had this experience on a bad day for the outlet and people may think that this review does not go hand in hand with their overall rating in Zomato, but I was hugely disappointed with the experience ! However, I would come again to cross-check whether the experience was an exception or a dark reality.

Perhaps the only restaurant in Kolkata that serves Indian tribal cuisine along with sumptuous seafood....¬†Let loose the foodie in you by savoring delicacies at Santa‚Äôs Fantasea.... Tucked in Ballygunj Terrace Road off Golpark, along with amazingly delectable food, this place offers you an equally charming tribal ambiance to relax in....

My favorite food pick here is none other than the¬†bansa pora¬†mutton/chicken (kind of bamboo mutton/chicken)....

The hospitality of the restaurant is one of the several reasons to visit there over and over again. The staffs including the owner himself is extremely courteous. 

I have been visiting the restaurant since its  inception. I have often faced difficulty to visit restaurants along with my little naughty kid. But in this place the owner himself has gone out of his way to make him feel comfortable.

Coming to the food and ambience I would give 10 out of 10. The small area has been aesthetically decorated in
 tribal theme.
I mostly start with the rice based tribal drink called as "Tankha Turani"
"Jula Pitha" has been my favourite. 
Sea food salads, different varieties of sea food noodles are also delicious apart from their signature dish "Bansa Pora''

This place has earned quite a name in the last few months. Being a foodie I decided to give it a try. The place is small with minimal decors. High chances are there that you won't get a place in the first place. We were lucky enough to get it at the first place. We ordered shanghai squid in starters. It was quite well cooked. In the main course we ordered Malaysian fried rice, seafood Beijing noodles, bansh pora mutton and kori gassi. Bansh pora mutton was super tasty. I recommend everyone to try that. You won't be disappointed. Rice was good but I did not like the noodles. It could have been better. But as a whole this place scores good in terms of food. Another good thing is you don't have to pay tax. That makes the price extremely reasonable. I am hoping to visit again and that too very soon.

Ok...so where do I start...probably the most unique restaurant in the city...or should I say the most unique food in the city...

I and my friend visited this place a couple of days ago...and this was on our radar for quite some time...and it certainly lived to expectations...

First we ordered their famous Bansh Pora Chicken...and the mere look of it impressed me...It tasted like bits of Tandoori Chicken... But there was a tinge of lemon and juiciness in it...the taste was unique and certainly this was the best thing we had there...

Then the Zulu Pitha...it was stuffed bread...the only thing being the bread was something very unique...I could not figure out what it was made of...it was hard to tear off...but once it's in the mouth it melts instantly...the stuffing of egg and Chicken added a uniqueness to this preparation...

Then we had Soru Chakli and a chicken preparation(i can't recall the name)...the soru chakli was a roti...which was made out of rice dust and egg...and yet it was sooo soft...

The chicken gravy tasted like that of garlic chicken but when you take a bite of the piece of chicken there is a tinge of coriander leaves and jeera...which renders it a uniqueness...

All in all a great experience... Good food..great service...amazingly fast...

I would've given it a 5...but just because of the lack of a proper washroom.......I'm deducting 0.5 marks...

Oh and by the way...the ambience inside is excellent... The d√©cor... The wall painting... The lighting... All lend it a perfect tribal feel to it...

One of the best seafood restaurant in south Kolkata! The ambiance is perfect...you can go with family and friends alike. The price is reasonably on the cheaper side and quantity is adequate. What's great about the place is that is serves authentic seafood. The waiters are nice and do have enough knowledge of the cuisine. They gladly help you out if you have no knowledge of what's the difference between squid and octopus! The tribal decore gives is a special look. Overall a nice experience!

Last sunday we went there hoping to have a nice time and good food.little did we know that it would become a dismal experience.we reached at 7 pm. the first thing that greeted our eyes was a piece of paper reading "cards not accepted".Then we noticed that all the tables were empty except 1.We tried to sit on a table for four.one of the waiters came running up and told us very rudely that we are not supposed to sit there and should shift to a 2 seater table which is too small even for school kids. We stated that we,ll have dinner and since it was almost vacant there should not be any problem. but we were rudely refused.we had no choice but to step out of the restaurant.pretty¬† much for the "fantastic" experience in santa's fantasia.

I have been here thrice and the place surely has impressed me each and every time.The place is economic too.Last time I went there with my cousins.There were 5 of us.
We ordered:
Bnaash Pora chicken
Bnaash Pora mutton
Lal gosht
Red wild rice
Smoked prwan
Kori gassi
Dragon pepper squid
And I must say each and every dish tasted wow! 
The quantity of the rice was disappointing though.
But overall I loved the place.

Best for tribal cuisine and seafood. The theme of the restaurant is also sea and marine life.. We ordered the banshe pora mutton and chicken and both tasted awesome.. The smoky flavoured mutton inside the bamboo sticks were well cooked and was delicious.. Items were reasonably priced. Staffs are good at recommendations of side dishes with main course.

Situated in Golpark,the lane beside Anjali jewellers,this place is nice when finding good and reasonable food. However,had very high expectations from this place but unfortunately it was unable to keep up with those expectations. Only a few selected dishes are praise worthy but,other dishes are very moderate in taste. Had ordered the Bejing fried rice but it was not that good. Some might find the quantity of rice dishes less. I would recommend you to order tribal food or seafood when you visit this place. If you order the normal, your experience will be less than moderate in terms of taste and tummy satisfaction.

Intro : Its so well said ..."it's actually easy to succeed than to honour and hold on to success" ...Our tonight's experience features Santa's Fantasea in that league

Experience : Family dinner - we reached @ 950 pm - wait time of 30-40 mins was informed - very politely
10 15 pm - we knocked - 15 mins more

1026 pm - still no reassurance - we were waiting outside, daughter feeling very un comfortable- wife goes to ask if at least she can sit somewhere - small table shown - I am waiting outside

1028 p.m. - Just two minutes have passed , I am still outside - the same staff comes to my wife - Our last order is at 1030 p.m

Just imagine - the entire family has not settled down and the great Santa's Fantasea announces last order

My wife called - I went inside - raised voice how is that possible - last order when we have not even got a place - someone came - reassured - Then suddenly everyone started to wind things up - as if it was just going to close down and we were unwanted guests

Food- Ya we are still driving back home with the packed food !

1/5

Review of food :

Now that we are ultimately able to have the food ( at home , almost midnight), here's the food review:

Banshpora Chicken - Really a absolutely different dish - really enjoyed the smoky flavour - a burnt bamboo flavour - as the name suggests, 4.5/5

Jadoh- Loved it - again absolutely out of the box -Red Rice with mutton pieces-. tasted great 4/5
Kukhura Komaso - Chicken Gravy dish from Sikkim - Again well done -.tasty - decent chicken pieces tasty gravy 4/5

Food rating 4/5

Overall - One of our worst dining experience in life. 1/5

Located in Golpark, near South City college, this place was in my list for a long time for its tribal cuisine. 

Not a big place and not spectacular when it comes to ambience, this place is just okay on that front.

So, we walked in and ordered Kukhura Ko Masi (Hopefully the right name), Juli Pitha, Roti and Bashe Pora Chicken. Surprisingly, they served us quite fast and the food was really good. Although the Pitha was a bit disappointing, others were really good. While the chicken tasted like garlic chicken with a different blend of masala though but the roti was completely different. Really good.

Standout however was the Bamboo Chicken. More of a burnt tandoor taste. Personal favourite that.

And the rates are quite reasonable. So, one can easily go and eat if they like the cuisine at display there. Definitely recommended.

Well on weekday afternoon this place was full of patron when i arrived. Decor is not much impressive but i was hungry to not to think so much. We ordered baash pore mangsho, malaysian rice noodles, dragon pepper chicken and honey chilli mushroom. 
Baash pora mangsho was good. The smokey flavor that makes the meat even more tasty. But the chicken wasn't tender at all. The bambo stick needed a longer simmer.
Dragon pepper chicken was utter nonsense. Neither it tasted well nor was it chewable.
Malaysian rice noodles was amazing. It had the perfect flavour along with the right proportion of veggies and flesh. The colour , the shine all looked so perfect. Finally the honey crispy mushroom was out of the world. The perfect blend of honey and chilli was too good. The tangy and sweet feel to the thick gravy made us craving for more.
Overall it is good. I will recommend this place for non fancy family gatherings.

I might be the last person amongst all the citizens of Calcutta to have visited Santa's fantasea for the first time.(apologies). Birthday treat by a friend took me here and I immediately understood the craziness for this eatery. We had to wait over an hour to get a table for 6. But the wait was worth it. The place is too tiny (speaks for the huge queue that is always waiting) and very easy on the pockets. The decor goes with the theme of the restaurant and its very well lit.(I like places where you can actually see properly what you are eating)! The food came in maybe within 20min of our placing the order. The platters are new,Unique and yet they haven't messed up the taste. My personal favorite would be the Mutton Bansh pora and the soru chakli roti.Its burnt,and its laden with flavors and essence of bamboo. The dry shanghai squid is something which one can go on having forever: its like the munchies we get, and its so tasty. ! The black pepper crab was something that did not impress me much and was very regular like the ones made at home. To go with this, we ordered for Wild rice which was full of flavors and very fresh to the taste buds.
This place is ideal for giving treats to your college friends, to treat yourself and for any regular eating out. Its easy on the pockets and  satisfying on the tongues. Highly recommended . :)

We finally made it to this place yesterday evening and we were not disappointed, to say the least. The joint was little crammed but cozy. The service was prompt and the food was quality considering the pocket pinch.
We concentrated on tribal cuisine and ordered Bansh Pora mutton, Zulu pitha, Jhupu pisi's delicacy, Red rice and Jadho. Barring the zulu pitha, all other preparations were very good. The food was by and large spicy but less on oil, which we liked very much.
Overall I would highly recommend this joint for casual dining.

One of those places where you can keep on going without getting bored. The place is a bit congested but let me tell you something, these guys, they do not compromise with the quality of food they serve. Bansh pora chicken and bansh pora mutton are the most popular appetisers at this place. Apart from these two, the dragon pepper squid is one of my favourites. Then you get to choose between a wide variety of rice and noodles. I prefer the Malaysian noodles and the Beijing rice. Also, try out the shanghai squid. Oh and no service tax.

Heard a lot about this place. Finally went there. Place is a bit clumsy. There is almost no place between two adjacent tables. And chairs are so hard that it almost hurts.
But these all things will be oblivious when the food arrives. Taste and quantity is just perfect. Price is also okay. Smoked octopus is a must try. Overall a good place to dineout.

The inside decor is appealing,felt like we were enjoying the meal in the heart of the sea.
Service was prompt,staff were courteous.
Bans pora chicken with soru chakli was appetizing,had a beautiful burnt flavour as expected.
The burnt chilli prawn was delicious as well
The sight of the julu pitha was simply adorable,which made it heartbreaking to eat it.
In the mains we had sticky rice and jadoh.The sticky rice was finger licking good.
We ordered two chicken dishes-arsa chhum and kori gassi which went well with the rice preparations.
In dessert we had the yummy tilhou kheer which was made of onion.
The restaurant is very pocket friendly and I would have rated it 5.Only deducted 0.5 for the unavailability of the tribal drink tankha turani which we were intent on having and most of the desserts.

Yes! 5/5!! You must be wondering why?? Its because they deserve it. Everything I found here is suited to my perfection! Food, Decor, Service - each & everything is just what it needed to be!¬†
I visited this place a few weeks back, with my bff. We ordered Jadoh (which was splendid) along with Mutton Bansh Pora (this was the show stealer!! ) & also Voksha meh (just to taste mutton bamboo shoots). Jadoh was so good that we ordered another plate of it...bansh pora mutton - so tender that it melts in your mouth leaving you wanting for more! :) Voksha meh was okayish (mind u it has a strong odour ).¬†
Coming to its decor....one cannot just sit down idly!! Both the rooms are just perfect to put one in the mood! A great themed restaurant I must say!
And last but not the least, their service. Its prompt. The waiters are very cordial & friendly.
Overall a memorable experience. Will visit here soon! :)

This is one BRILLIANT restaurant serving lip-smacking tribal food. I have visited this place thrice and my review is bases on the three visits. On the first visit, I remember ordering A Crab Momo, seafood noodles and garlic butter squid. The quality and quantity both were very good. The garlic butter squid is worth a special mention. It was amazingly tasty.
On my second visit, they did some changes to the menu. We ordered Wild Red Rice, oyester squid and bansha pora(mutton). Bansha pora was the highlight of that night.
On the third visit, we ordered smoked octopus, sticky rice, chicken in black bean sauce. The octopus though looked a bit scary, tasted beautiful.

There are unique items on the menu. But what is not acceptable is the use of colours in food. It is repulsive seeing green colour in Kori Gassi and Malaysian fried rice. Very few food hubs in Kolkata do this. The restaurant should not ruin it's name this way when it is trying something beyond of the ordinary.

Entering the place, you will experience a tribal theme. Ambience is great. The service of the stuffs is decent. Coming to the food part...I ordered Wild Red Rice, Black Pepper Squid and Tangy Sauce Chicken. The Squid tastes just outstanding. The food is worth every penny. I assure you that you'll never ever come back from this place with an empty heart and obviously tummy. :P It's quite Satisfactory. ;)

Unique, Different, unconventional, divergent are a few words that comes to my mind describing this restaurant. It is one of those rare restaurant that isn't mainstream but has gain mainstream popularity.

Place has a very good ambiance and i especially dig the tribal and sea theme decor, lovely.

On to the food, one of the best in Kolkata. Be it the squid or the octopus or the fish or the chicken everything is mouth-wateringly delicious. The tribal food are more of an acquired taste. I simply love the Jadho rice, Banshpora mutton and shoru chakli. I was a bit skeptical at first about the Banshpora, but it was splendid none the less.

Love this place.

Went there today. Frankly speaking had a lot of expectation but was let down.
Overhyped banse pora mutton. For that kind 350 is too much.
Had malaysian rice, jadoh, malaysian rice noodles. Too much oil in each of the dishes .Kindly know how to cook rice noodles , There were lumps of noodles. ¬†The place is too small to go for any kind of celebration¬†. Dont know if it was a one off today but had heard lot about their food. Was a total let down and on that . probably this was my first and last time. Moreover the waiters need to be more polished. It seemed that you are at a road side dhaba with that kind of a service.

After hearing way too much about the famous bansh pora maangsho of Santa's Fantasea, I decided to try out this place. But to my surprise, it tasted awfully bad. The dish was overcooked and had simply no taste at all. It wasn't just me who didn't like it, the guests beside my table too complained about it not being upto the mark. Besides this, I had ordered crab momos which didn't have much filling at all. It was just a layer. The squid was better than the other two, but still rubbery as it was undercooked. The only decent dish was the seafood rice. I think this place is just over hyped as it really didn't serve good edible food.

heard a lot about the tribal and sea foods of this restaurant. tried Bashpora Mutton with Soru Chakli..it was very good. the aroma of pora bash with the boneless mutton was realy tasty and different. Oyster Chily Basil Squid was bit spicy..but tastes good. I heard lot about their prawn dishes so tried Chou Chu prawn...it was nothing but fried prawns with sliced fried  garlic. it was too salty..didn't taste good. The waiter suggsted to taste Smoked Crab..yak..there was lemon leaf and sour taste..no trace of smoky thing. Hoisin Chily Prawn. bit sweeter dish.taste good. Teriuaki fish. it was a boneless fish dish. couldn't identify the fish. Seafood Malaysian rice with prawn and squid tastes good though the rice quality was averrage.
The decor of the restaurnt is good with tribal paintings and showpieces.
Cons: 1. very limited seating capacity.
2. v less waiters.
3. the wash room is very pathetic...just beside the kitchen.

In terms of the food, the restaurant lives up to its reputation. The group ordered the Crab momos (steamed), Bansa Pora Mutton, Soru Chakli, Crack Leaves Tuna, Oyster Chilly Basil Squid, Seafood Rice (Malaysian and Beijing). All of them wowed, especially the momos, mutton and the squid. The mutton was perfectly made and succulent and the momos were very tasty. It was my first sampling of squid and I was a little apprehensive but the texture and the flavour won me over with the first bite. I docked one star because of the way the servers seemed to be hustling us to give our orders quickly even though there were empty tables. Overall, a fantastic place to sample some brilliant seafood.

Well!! We have been planning to visit this seafood specialist for a long time but unfortunately it never happened, finally it was my friends birthday, so we decided to give it a try,it is located beside Ornaate- the cafe store golpark, we were in a hurry so took parcel,we ordered Bansa pora chicken, wild red rice & jhupu pishi mutton, the names are very unusual but tastes really good, the quantity would have been better but still will look forward for a dine in sometime soon :)

Food ordered:¬†Seafood Malaysian Rice,¬†Butter Garlic Fish,¬†Bansh Pora Mutton.¬†
Food was excellent, especially the Bansh Pora & Malaysian Rice. The Bansh Pora Mutton had that unique smell of burns and the rice was something new and unique too. One should give it a try.¬†The place is just beside anjali jewelers.¬†
The main reason of giving it a 3 star is, we have visited Santa's Fantasea on this sunday, as the 2 seater table was already occupied, we have to sit in an non-ac area where some goods are kept. Since it was my 1st visit, I haven't expected it at all. Need to try the Salt Lake outlet, hope it will not disappoint me.

After seeing several posts and getting many positive feedbacks I finally took the effort to visit this place. Thanks to Google map it was not tough to locate the restaurant. The d√©cor is moderate not so great to create a hype about it. According to me and as a former hotelier food and service both are the major pillars of a great FB outlet. I will not spend much writing about the food because it was trully amazing, the first of its kind in tribal cuisine in Kolkata. However, if I don't visit this outlet in future it will be due to the pathetic service. If you go in good numbers then you will be privileged to get a seat in a room where the air conditioning is on otherwise they will provide you a two seater either near the gate or near the cash counter where there is no air conditioner. The person in the cash or may be the owner is very humble and have the courtesy to ask you about the quality of the food otherwise the waiters don't even bother to serve you water. One of them is so arrogant that it seems he is paying himself to serve us food. The funniest thing is his English dictionary which he uses though you are speaking with him in Bengali. On asking for dessert options the tone in which he will deny you will make u recall your old maths professors. Nevertheless a bad experience also teaches you stuffs. So, please try it out yourself guys rather judging based on this review. Best of luck.

This place is awesome. The schezwan octopus was chewy but the gravy was finger licking.we also enjoyed the two soups  we took .the soup had squid ,octopus,shrimp and crab meat.we the best of all was the honey chilly squid which was slurrrrrrp!we took three rice which were jadoh ,Beijing seafood rice and the Malaysian rice.finally we had prawn kheer .I know it sounds crazy but trust me it was out of the world.

I suggest to everyone who like seafood and tribal food to go to Santa's fantasea .

The place is well decorated with tribal theme. Had Smoked Octopus and Shanghai Crab. The Octopus was awesome. The crab was good but it was made of frozen crab and the was thus dry unlike and less tasty than the local sea crabs. But cooking was awesome.

A long awaited visit to this coveted restaurant finally came calling when my friend & i decided to have a food meet as per our regime after 3 long months. So on a sweltering afternoon's heat we visited the place. 

The place has 2 rooms of seating arrangement with moderate capacity. We quickly ordered the following:-

1. Cold drinks

2. Bansa pora mutton- Their signature dish which is very reknowned among the diners. The mutton is basically smoked in unique distinct spices & is served in bamboo casing. The taste was so outstanding that we ended up taking 2 plates of it. The portions were adequate as well. Highly recommended!!

3. Seafood malaysian meifoon- seafood meifoon which was made with prawns, squids & broccolis. The meifoon was cooked perfectly & the oil was on the lesser side as well. The quantity was balanced(neither too low nor too high) & could be shared by 2 people.

4. Teriyaki fish- 8pcs of bhetki pieces made with garlic sauce,bell peppers & spring onions. The fish pcs were soft & tender which gave a subtle taste to the dish.

5. Smoked squid- pieces of smoked squid prepared in mild sauce,curry leaves,lemongrass & spring onions. The texture of the squid was a bit rubbery & complimented well with the meifoon.

6. Onion kheer- Another gem of a dish in the desert section(tribal menu). The onion pcs are diced into very fine cuts which was mixed with the kheer but had no onion taste & gave a smooth texture to the kheer. Highly recommended dish!!

The food which they served satisfied our taste buds in every way. The service was prompt & flawless. All the prices in the menu are tax inclusive which makes this place a pocket friendly affair. Looking forward to visit again!!

It is a small place in fact a residential accommodation converted to a restaurant located close to Golpark Anjali Jewellers. The restaurant is done up in the tribal theme. The menu proudly announces a potpourri of exotic seafood and tribal fare from the Indian subcontinent. Overall the experience was different from the other restaurants in the city and their squid is soft and juicy too. 
Definitely worth a visit. :)

Went there on a friend's birthday treat. 11 of us occupied the whole of sea-themed part of this place. Another part was the tribal themed section. 
Coming straight to the food, they serve some really nice sea food. 
-Malaysian rice being a clear winner. 
-Oyster chilli basil squid too went along great with it. 
-However, did not like the chicken dish as much for there are other places that offer better chicken items. 
-Smoked prawn was good too. 
Price, extremely pocket friendly.

Seafood at it's best. Heard a lot about this place and went for a evening adda with expectation of good food. I must say am nt disappointed. Food is of great quality and their interior and ambience is much appreciable. We ordered bansa pora mutton, Kori gassi, red rice, jadoh, schezwn octopus.. The octopus dish was great to taste and the red rice is far better than any schezwn rice. Concept of bansa pora mutton is also very nice. Overall, good food, good place, good ambience, good service. Will definitely visit again.

Lovely ambience, spacious,beautiful interiors.

Wild red rice: Spicy with red chilli flakes and made of thick rice. A heavy meal.

Bansha Pora Mutton: Unique presentation, beautiful succulent mutton pieces. Lovely smoky fragrance that is not pungent at all.

Octopus in Chilli Wine: Juicy, sweet and sour at the same time. The octopus was a bit chewy but had anice texture. (As reported by brother)

Kori Gassi: Large chunks of chicken covered in a smooth green gravy made of wonderfully fragrant coriander and garlic. But I found the chicken pieces a little hard and the gravy wasn't really infused in it. It was a festive day and peak hours, hence I'll just overlook it.

Malaysian Seafood Rice: Beautiful fragrance and mild, made with squids and onions this is like a palate cleanser.

Visit this place to try out unique dishes and ample quantity which offers great value for money. The servers are very helpful and fast.

A place with an exclusive menu on offer, Santa's Fantasea is indeed a fantasy come true for the adventurous eater, especially for Bengalis who have plenty of new delicacies to satisfy their meaty and fishy taste buds with. The place has a selective range of tribal delicacies from all around the country (mostly from the north east) which is quite unique in itself. I have been to the place a couple of times and my personal favorites are Jadoh rice (red rice with minced meat) which in itself is quite wholesome. The bans-pora mutton, lal mans (Mutton), ngatok (fish item),  arsachum (chicken) are exclusive delicacies you must try here. 
Apart from tribal food the place has a wide platter of sea food including squids and octopus. We had both. I specifically liked the squid. Apart from these there is a host of other new delicacies to be tried it from, and the best part is easy more economic than you would expect for such exquisite dishes.

I loved the decor of the place, though the place is a bit small and cramped. The welcome drink concept I liked. The drink was also refreshing. Service is good and so is the behavior of the staffs.

I tried my first Octopus here and loved it. Loved their seafood fried rice too. Great place if you love seafood and want to experiment with new items.

If you want to taste something different, then Santa's fantasea can provide you the solution! It's awesome! Lovely combination of tribal and seafood. I have been there twice. I think their seafood delicacies are better than the tribal ones. Though tribal cuisine is very much satisfying. 
Seafood rice, all the preparations of squid, bansa pora mutton are my favorites here.

Cost of the food is very low as we won't be able to get crab squid horse fish in a very low cost but the service was quite slow not good that's the reason customer wait outside for a long time. You can give a try but not in weekends üòâ happy eating üëçüèª

Bhai ektai kotha bolbo. Santas fantasea rocks!! I have been to this place for like 5 times and everytime, mind it man everytime it has succeeded to present something wow. I had previously decided that i wont give any review about any resto but this place has made me do it. U can try anything and everything and everything will be yummaliciousss..

Location - this place is located in the lane of anjali jewellers, golpark . Just go in and whoa!U r there. So simple.

Ambiance - ab hum photo nahi lete. Humara bolna hi kaafi hai. Waise bhi everyone has uploaded soo many photos of that tribal man with wooden teeth that my photo will not stand out. So just read the description. The resto has two sects - one tribal and one seafood. Though u can eat anywhere and have anything. I personally like the tribal one. The decoration is at par with the theme. And the tables are good with comfortable chairs. But a bit of advice. Please introduce wooden plates to make the theme more realistic. Otherwise everything nice and tribal. As far as the seafood part is concerned .. a little decoration can be done.

Ambiance - courteous staffs and professional behaviour. No hi hello. Just polite attitude towards work. Good and impressive.

Food - when i went there for the first time i was really impressed as they served us a complimentary welcome drink but this time there was no such drinks. I think they have stopped that. Why? Introduce that again.

Anyways lets jump to the menu.

Beijing sea food rice noodles - it was yum. Proper meifoon i must say. Everything was nice and perfect. I must say meifoon is my fav so i can be a lil partial too.

Smoked octopus - this is a signature dish of santas. So i dont think i need to elaborate more. It was just delicious. But one lil bit prob - the octopus was a lil hard. It could have been a tad bit softer.

Honey chili squid - it was a sweet and chilli thing. Squids were perfect and i loved them.

I forgot the name of the chicken dish. Photo de rahi hu isiliye.

Last me bata du i didnt have any intention to write this review so i didnt click any pic. Pic courtesy a frnd who is nt on zomato.

We went Santa's fantasea today, which is rated number 1 for its seafood in zomato. Whatever we went there around 3:30, n all the staffs there were at hurry as the place was having its closed time. I ordered the most famous baanshpora mutton, shanghai squid, the chakli, n the renowned crab momo. The baanshpora as expected was mouth watering, so to as the squid. But really cudnt get why r people so after the crab momo. It was nothing as I have heard before. Above all I didn't find the place customer friendly. But the food served was good.

Santa's Fantasea is a gem of a place and due to its convenient location, it has made itself in the list of favourites for all the seafood lovers in South Kolkata. 
I managed to drop in on a Saturday night and quite evidently there was a queue of people waiting outside. Though the interiors were nothing extra ordinary but stilll it has got a slight hint of theme tribal essence in its decor. Coming to the food, the Malayasian Fried Rice was good, a noticable greenish tint is there in the flavoured rice mixed with prawn and veggies. Next, it was smoked Octopus which was quite delicious. Though the octopus flesh is a little rubbery which I find irritating at times, but the taste was spot on. Lastly the dragon pepper fish was a pure delight for the tastebuds. The fish was fresh bhetki and it just melted in mouth. It scores big for the food but the service could have been better. They were taking time to serve water also which was a litte disappointing at times. Apart from that, the visit was worth it. 
Overall, it deserves a 4 out of 5 undoubtedly, iff not more.

Have attempted to eat at the restaurant on several  occasions but turned away for the long queue. So decided to order home this time around. Since Swiggy was too busy and Zomato wasn't showing the full menu - called up the restaurant directly. Sanjoy Roy was most helpful with the order - guiding me both on the selection and portion size. The 2 meat (mutton)  dishes -   Voksa Rep Chum (Mizoram) and Voksa Meh (Nagaland) were exceptional. The first was a red curry with mustard leaves and the second with Bamboo Shoot and seasonal herbs. Both used tender chop cuts. Went down brilliantly with red rice. But, the weak link in the chain was the absence of pork and dried fish pickle in the menu - without which North East Tribal food is unthinkable. But, wish they stuck to pure tribal cuisine (which now has a very limited collection) without going in for standard Oriental and Chinese - albeit with an emphasis on Sea Food. (By the way - the Chilly, Basil, Oyster Squid made a fine starter with the Single Malt at home.)

Another themed restaurant with a tribal feel all over it. This can also be categoriseed as a hidden gem. It is located in a narrow lane in the interiors of golpark. The place is inside a house on the ground floor.
CI went there with my good friend Saikat Mondal¬†to give the tribal cuisine a try. We started with Baans Pora Mutton along with soru chakli. While this much could suffice many people. We two foodies took it as appetizers :P, and went on to order another round of food. This time we ordered Jadoh, the rice dish along with Jhupu Pisi's Mutton Delicacy and burnt chilly prawn. Every single dish was cooked to perfection. I am out of words in praising the taste of the food here. A must go for seafood lovers and meat lovers. The dishes I tried were too good. The baans pora is on the way to become a legendary dish, Kudos to the management for their great food and service.Food: 5/5
Ambience: 5/5
Service: 4/5

This little place is tucked away in a little lane, a little stroll away from Golpark. Star Anise in sticky rice!? Who would have guessed? Well, it wasn't really sticky rice that they served, more of a canton style gravy rice. But their Bans Pora mutton blew me away. Commendable. Worth it. Pretty easy on the pocket too.

After a long long time of 'fantasising' we finally made it to Santa's Fantasea! We were super excited to try the tribal delicacies here nd started with the famous bansa pora mangsho, which is pieces of mutton cooked inside bamboo  and served directly from the burning bamboo to ur plate. Its a dish from Odisha.It had nicely smoked tender mutton pieces. Then we had Ngatok, a Naga tribal dish of fish and herbal spices wrapped in banana leaf...it was amazing to taste. The aroma of the herbs was mild yet dominating the taste. In maincourse we ordered jadoh, a Meghalayan rice dish and it tastes out f d world!! It had unpolished rice mixed with flavoursome spices and cooked mutton. We also ordered seafood beijing noodles, which was tasting quite bland compared to the other dishes. But the sides, smoked squid and kori gassi (Mangalorean) saved it. The green coriander gravy of kori gassi was too good. The lemongrass in the smoked squid added the extra awesomeness in the dish. We had such satisfying dinner and the pocket pinch was just 1300/-. The food we ordered was more than sufficient for 3 people! Will definitely come back again to try the other dishes for sure.

From the viewpoint of uniqueness,this restora is a high five for Kolkata. So many reviews and photos and obviously 'octopus' worked as catalyst inside my mind. So,finally,with my colleagues I hit the small yet famous food joint near Golpark.
Objective was quite clear to us-Try as many new items as we could both physically and economically.we ordered Banshpora chicken,Jadau rice,Chilly basil octopus,Beijing seafood noodles,Smoked crab and Julu breads.
Each and every item was distinct in taste. Banshpora chicken was smoky flavoured but the quantity wasn't satisfactory. Octopus in sauce was good in taste.(those who think it's horrible,pls visit and taste),jadau rice was flavoursome and tasteful but there should be more mutton pieces in. Crab was usual.julu bread is a fluffy bread with stuffings.
At the end,according to my colleague

Sea food being one of my absolute favourites, this place keeps luring me back. But that's not all. Its ambience,its people, the other offbeat dishes, and the price together make a wonderful combination, if you're looking for comfort meal without burning a hole in your pocket. Everyone knows about the bnashpora chicken here, which pairs well with the red rice. But one combination that completely took me by surprise is the sticky rice with smoked squid! The sticky rice, with its buttery, spicy smoothness, feels like safety blanket for the mouth and the insides! A small eatery where you can have a good time,alone or with a food partner, its best gift is the bill, which is just what you see on the menu, with no added taxes.

Location- inside the lane of anjali jewelers 
Ambience-Good thematically done.... Seats are not very comfortable.
Service-quick and nice.
You might get not a seat very easily and it's kinda worth the wait.
Food:-
Jhulu Pishis mutton- soft,juicy and yum! 
Julu pitha- too much maida... The filling was not enough.
Soru chalki-thin and goes well with mutton.
Bashe pora chicken- smoky,soft and we'll done.
Garlic prawns- not great, they could not pull up Chinese well. 
Onion kheer- it was better than what i was expecting... 
The only problem with this place Is its a Lil smelly. Maybe the sea food smell all over which I don't like much.

The name ain't a misnomer for this restaurant. It indeed meets the fantasy of the foodies around Kolkata. The place is small yet exudes a cosiness. The decor is pretty and apt. The pricing just right. As far as the food is concerned it's definitely worth and more your money. I might sound cl√Æched but the baansh pora mutton is outstanding and that smoked squid is to die for. Being a typical bengali who lusts for fish and will choose it over chicken any day, the bhetki in white buttery sauce was foodgasmic. An amazing place to hangout with both friends and family.

It's quite sometime that I heard of this place but I couldn't find suitable companion for this place so had to wait until my bestie was back in the city. Santa's Fantasea was my fantasy that I turned into realism recently. Just near Anjali jewellers, Golpark it is located. ¬†Hunger never says and come so around 5p.m hunger took me there. To my utter dismay I realised that the place remains closed from 4pm to 6pm. After wandering in the streets, exactly around 6pm I was allowed to enter along with my companions.¬†

It's a tribe based tribal themed restaurant as mentioned in zomato and they have put up a lot of tribal paintings, statues and boards. Their outer room is seafood based. The sitting arrangement is quite comfortable and they give a complimentary welcome drink which varies day to day tastes good.

We ordered a lot of wild red rice, oyster chilli based squid and under tribal food we took bansh pora chicken which is a preparation where chicken is marinated and stuffed in bamboo, cooked in tandoor. The first two dishes were undoubtedly good but the third one didn't win my heart. There's a hype that mutton bansh pora is the best but I didn't try that so no idea about it. It is a pocket friendly place even after they repriced it all. Overall, it's a good place and I would love to go back again.

worth trying. :)

If you love trying out different types food or you are the one who is always looking out to taste something new then this I place you should definitely drop in. You have a wide choice . Price is also reasonable.  But preferably dont drive (parking is a issue) and drop in early (place is small compared to popularity).

Santa's Fantasea was good restaurant, I was thr with my frnd in one hottie afternoon.a long wait around 30min outside..no seat available n was hungry so wait fr our turn. Finally it was our call. Chillax. We had ordered some sanghai noodle and one squid preparation.preparation was good but one thing they should change. There theme is african tribal so according to that they should arrange wooden texture plate n serving bowl whatever u say.anyways nice restaurant in small budget..frnds cm n hv a taste sm exotic food.. Ohh next time I must try Bashpora chicken which is very famous here..

Heard numerous great words for this tribal and seafood serving place. I decided to give it a try before leaving Kolkata whatever the problem was to find a foodie friend who was willing to try new cuisine, and finally, one of my friends agreed to accompany me on this mission.

Location:Situated near Anjali Jewellery shop. Take the road just in front of the shop. Walk for less than a minute, and you will find it on your left.

Ambiance:

Pros:
1. Two rooms equip with ACs.
2. Nicely decorated - one is decorated as an ocean and other as a tribal place to give a feel of their cuisine.

Cons:
1. The place is small compared to the crowd.
2. The bathroom is 'Pathetic'.
3. The bathroom is just beside the kitchen and inside the service area.
4. In the service area, you will find a refrigerator where the raw material has been kept. If you see that thing, then you may leave the place without eating.

Rating: 1.5/5

Service:

Pros:
1. Staffs are courteous.
2. Service is fast.
3. Serve water at regular intervals.

Cons:
1. Do not serve the food on the plate except Bansa¬†Pora Chicken.
2. They are reluctant to switch on the AC.
3. I read at Zomato that Thanka Turani which is a tribal drink was offered on the house. I was wondering when they would offer us, but alas, I had to take the initiative to ask about it.

Rating: 2.5/5

Price: It's a VFM place. Quantity provided was very good and also the price was not very high. For two, it cost will cost you around 600 rupees.

Rating: 4/5

Food:

Most of the items on the menu were not available which was a big disappoint and reason for our dissatisfaction for us.
Finally, we ordered Bansa Pora Chicken, Shanghai Squid, Smoked Octopus, Seafood Malaysian Rice, Seafood Shanghai Rice.

We planned to order Bansa Pora Mutton but as it wasn't available so we have to go for the Chicken. It was really good. Chicken pieces were tender and very well cooked served inside a bamboo. Strongly recommend. 5/5

It tried the dry version of the Shanghai Squid. It was another well-cooked item. Recommended dish for the Squid lovers. 5/5

That was the first item I tried Octopus, and I didn't like it. It was chewy and slippery.

Both the fried rice were very average. Only the good things were the quantity and lots of sea-food. Rating: 3/5

Overall food rating: 4/5

When some one enters the Resurant from the summer hot outside,it really feels awesome.

Atlast Santa's Fantasea.

Like many others I have heard about this,the best seafood joint,one of the best resturant of kolkta etc.So it is.

It really is.The place is well decorated with its cute hanging fishes and tribal           .

We had Seafood Malaysian Rice,Sanghai Praw,Wild Red Rice and obviously the Special Item Baanshpora chicken.The food is astounding.We could not complete all of it.And the Red Rice is really spicy.Worth trying.Stuffs are Good.Clear.But one main draw back is no drinks excecpt cocacola.This is much needed after a Full stomach lunch.Otherwise for food lovers its a must visit place.Price is reasonable and 4.5 is deserving.Hurry up.Santa's Fantasea is witing to welcome you.MoM:Superb Seafood.

Santa's Fantasea is bringing tribal food on Kolkata's food map. The seafood here is equally good if not better. Been here ever since it has opened its door. And I must say every time it gets better. The place is small and gets packed very soon. And, it is very pleasing to the pocket as well.¬†
Waiting for them to expand and hoping their food quality does NOT fall.¬†
Oh, did I mention their Baansh Pora Chicken/Mutton is to die for?!

Summer always brings out the 'sea-foodie' in me, and as spring decided to give Bengal a skip this year, I needed to rein in my taste buds. I had heard about Santa's Fantasea's sea food delicacies from a food critic once, so I decided to do a quick search on Zomato. I was amazed by the ratings and favourable reviews, and delighted to find tribal cuisine being served here as well!(Yaaay! You rock ZomatoüòÑ‚ù§). The promise of Jadoh was enough to try this new place. My father's birthday was two days later on Holi, so a dinner with my parents at this place was finalised.

Location- This place is very easy to locate-just take the lane beside Golpark Anjali jewellers outlet, and it's a 1 minute walk from there. For those who don't know about this outlet, it's on the Golpark-Garia route, opposite to the RKM institution.

D√©cor-  Like many other restaurants in Kolkata, it seemed that this was a residential place that has been converted to a food joint. The decor is not of very refined taste, and a bit quirky, which is absolutely refreshing! It symbolises the rustic tribal culture and a fantasy sea world they promise to provide.
The tribal menu is extremely helpful, as it explains each native dish. Even then,if you have a problems in placing your orders, just let the server help you, they give well thought suggestions.

Food- We decided to begin with the seafood menu and I recommend the same for those who want to try both cuisines, as Indian tribal cuisine generally consists of rich mixture of spices, and seafood in later course might feel bland on taste buds. We started with smoked crabs and dry Teriyaki fish. The fish was fantastic, it was fresh, perfectly done and full of flavour. It did taste different than teriyaki dishes I have tried before but in a good way. The smoked crab, even though it was fresh and tasty, was a bit too dry for my taste(I prefer it melting into my mouth like butterüòã). It's a shame we couldn't order the squid or octopus as a result of my mother's paranoia of slimy creatures,but I have promised myself to come back again for the squid(should have seen the look on my mother's face when a fellow patron was trying octopusüòÇ). In the main we ordered their famous Bansh Pora mutton, Soru chakli and Jadoh. Jadoh is a Meghalayan rice dish cooked with pork pieces, but here they serve it with mutton pieces. I would heavily recommend this north east Indian meal as it is amazing and unique and offers a peak in the flavourful cuisines of the seven sister states. Soru Chakli is like 'gola roti',as we Bengalis call it. Try this with dry sides,it worked great with the Bansh Pora mutton dish. The Bansh pora mutton served here, is basically marinated mutton, stuffed in a bamboo and then cooked on a tandoor. It was the best dish of the night; the aroma is brilliant and does wonders for your appetite. The mutton was succulent and the flavour of burnt bamboo was in perfect balance with the spices.

Overall, this is a great place. The food is fabulous and refreshing. The ambience is great too. However space is an issue here, hopefully they work it out soon enough keeping in mind their rising popularity.

Don't try to co-relate name with decor. Well if you don't bother in the first place, all the more. I do. 
At first I thought, it'd be all like Santa Claus and Christmas tree, and sea, before checking it up in Zomato, since it was themed. 
Then I was like okay, this is tribal. 
It's like you're walking in a tribal village and you get treated by some sophisticated alpha male's house. x'D
The decor is soothing and pleasing. Calms mind. 
The food well. Nothing extravagant. 
Or may be I didn't order much to praise extravagantly. 
Ngatok was all right tasteful. Wild red rice was domestic to taste buds, a bit different from what I had in Mizoram. :'D
Baansh-pora is totally worth it. This is the ace of the lot. 
All in all, yeah more that one time visit. 
I'm gonna have to visit again. xD

I had eaten here when the restaurant had just newly opened and it was teeming with people. I liked their service, very friendly. I love their pawn and octopus dishes. The sea food soup was a new experience for me. They had also given us a complementary drink. Im keen on trying the bash pora someday. Its a novelty that has made this restaurant pretty famous. However, I still kind of prefer Ecstasea though this place has a better location and is easy to find. In a gully adjacent to the Anjali Jewellers at Golpark

This place took me into a tribal synonymous life. The walls,  beautifully embossed with picturesque tribal designs, depicting their lives in the woods. And yes, the food was very delicious, starting with the 'bansh pora chicken', which had a beautiful smoky flavour and along with it the 'jadoh', which had minced mutton balls countered my hunger well. 
Coming next to the sea-food, the 'oyster chili basil squid' was mouth-delighting with its creaminess along with the famous 'sticky rice'.
Lastly, I couldn't resist my urge for sea-food and summed up the meal with some 'butter garlic octopus',first time though but was worth the try !
A really decent place and pocket friendly too.
Keep up the good job Santa's !

Visited this place for a b'day party with 4 of my foodie friends. We were all new to this place and only knew about their famous bashpora mutton/chicken. So we started with bashpora mutton along with smoked octopus and a ngatok and the from the very first bite realised delicious is too small a word for them. Then in main course we ordered wild red rice, sea malayasian rice along with jhupu pisi's mutton and fish teriyaki and each one of those items was amazing. Specially the combination of red rice and jhupu pisi's mutton was too awesome and I would suggest everyone to try this combo. We also ordered a sea food soup and I have absolutely no doubt that it was the best soup I ever had till date. In the end we had chenmeen(prawn) kheer which was also no less than above mentioned items. 

Ambience is okay, the place may look a little congested but the quality they serve will make u ignore everything. And lastly the bill without any kind of added tax was a breather! u can actually eat a lot here spending not so much. If u want to taste something different with a pocket friendly budget, this place can easily top the list.

Visited this place on my mothers birthday, she being a sea food lover, this was a great treat for her. We were given a table at the tribal section.
Had to wait for half an hour to forty-five minutes for a seat.  A flat converted to a restaurant. Having a seating capacity of 25-35. Ordered the baas pora chicken and mutton. Chicken was nothing of that sorts. But the mutton was amazing. With the bamboo flavors coming very prominently. Followed by johar and wild rice. Which were spicy and great. Ordered prawn Manchurian and schezwan fish. Both were great. As we got a table late, but due to the kind staff we managed to get piyaz and chigri payesh. It was something we had not tried, but were good over all. Must have would be baas pora mutton!

I would have given a straight 5 if I was to give this review just for the food, which by the way is really good, but the service and behavior of the staffs of this place is so messed up that it's difficult to overlook and rate the place just based on the food.¬†

Food: I don't eat mutton but the Bansha Pora mutton here made me a convert and the charred bits of mince mutton goes amazingly well with the soft as cotton Shoru Chakli Ruti. The distinct smokey flavour of the mutton is hard to miss and it is such a pleasant distraction from all the oil-laden-thick-gravy mutton which you get in other restaurants.¬†
The soft Shell crab in Garlic sauce was really good with the right amount of spice and kick. We absolutely loved it and so was the squid in Honey Chilli sauce. My mother though preferred the Shanghai Squid more than the Honey-Chilli Variation. I tried their Sikkimese style chicken and didnt ike it very much.¬†

I tried to eat at this place for more than thrice after which by the fourth attempt I could finally get in. The servers behave as if they are the king of the world, with no regard for waiting customers at all. They make it look like as if they do the waiting customers a favour by letting them in. There is no manager or anybody in the restaurant to whom you can actually complain about it.¬†
Barring this issue with their servers, the place serves good food at affordable prices and a must visit for all the sea-food lovers.

After hearing about its great seafood menus and reviews went there to have a nice lunch with someone special. Located inside the lane of Anjali Jewellers of golpark , the outside was decorated with sea food style and inside was totally rural look. The place gave a nice feeling and we ordered fantasea's special soup , smoked octopus,malyasian seafood noodles and crab momos. Everyfood was tasty and¬† specially the octopus and the soup. Would go here once again to taste the bansh pora mutton. overall very satisfied and very nice and quite cheap. would recoomend this place if u want to try out seafood.

The exterior of this restaurant is not particularly striking. And well, in this age appearances do matter. The interior wall decorations are weird.
However the food was quite delicious. Seafood Malayasian rice was excellent with smoked octopus ( a bit tough though) along with oyester chilly squid. The squid was a bit salty to my taste. We finished it off with soru chakli and bansh pora mutton. The texture of the soru chakli was simply beautiful. Will like to taste the rest of the tribal dishes.
Second visit:
 Had Malayasian noodles, Shanghai Octopus, Patra Pora and Jadoh. 
Shanghai Octopus was good. However, Jadoh and Patra pora stole the show. The mutton pieces were wonderfully marinated and cooked and quite succulent. Lipsmacking! We were so full, we couldn't eat another morsel. Delicious food!

The best thing about this place is their menu which is very unique and light on the pocket. There is no added tax to the prices on the menu. The food was light, though their rice dishes aren't enough to fill two people. The banshpora mutton and soru rooti are two  unique dishes which I'd seriously recommend. Since I've never had octopus or squid elsewhere I'm unaware of how they're supposed to taste, but it was a nice experience altogether. I've heard some complaints of late service about this place but probably since I had been there on a Tuesday afternoon the service was lightning fast. The weird wall decorations of tribal people staring at you which you munch along make the food taste a tad bit more delicious. Overall an interesting place to dine.

Kolkata food entrepreneurs have struck gold with this small but unique restaurant.
Situated near the South City college,Golpark. .it is not too hard to find.
The restaurant is sectioned off into a tribal food area and a seafood area.
We went there for lunch and even on a weekday. .the place was totally full.
We ordered julu pitha,wild red rice, bansh pora chicken, butter squid and fried mackerel.
The julu pitha was moist and soft but I felt that the chicken stuffing inside was far too less.
I loved loved the butter squid and the wild red rice.
The bansh pora chicken was different in a good way but a bit dry.
The fried mackerel was a disaster. .for me that is . .but it might be because its a sea fish and I'm used to the smell-free sweet water fish.
But I loved the decor and the service. I will surely go back and try some more. Perfect for students' budget.

Szechuan pepper fish was good too..

Sea food malaysian noodles was awesome.. One of the best noodles i have ever had.
Sea foos canton noodles was good too..
They had squids in it.. As i had told earlier i do not have fish, cause of the smell..
Yet i loved all the fish items as well as the sea food items.. Go there enjoy the delicacies...

I went thr previously few months back, i did get a welcome drink.. I did miss it this time..

A completely reasonable priced place, food tastes really good and an ideal place to treat your taste buds with a bit out of the ordinary food. The tribal effect really adds to my pleasure.

One word: Wow. Santa's Fantasea is truly a gem of a place. Let me get right to it. When you enter, there are three rooms which are decorated in three separate ways: the sea, a tribal setting and a village. We decided to sit in the tribal area. The ambience is warm and inviting and the waiters are very polite. Now the food: Again, wow! We ordered Smoked octopus. It was the first time we tried octopus and we were not disappointed. The taste was so good. We also ordered Jadoh, Arsa Chhum, Ngatok and Dragon pepper chicken. All the dishes were delicious. But i have to personally ask you to try the Jadoh and Ngatok. Jadoh is a rice dish with succulent pieces of mutton and Ngatok is fish prepared in a banana leaf. What surprised us was the bill. It was so reasonable compared to the quality and quantity of the dishes being served. A must try, this one. Will definitely be going back for more! Ting :-)

The hype is real.  We had the best of both worlds, tribal and seafood.  The entrance is modest. But the food is stuff of small wonders!!  
Go there for the tribal highlights of banshpora Mutton,  kori gasi and wild rice. 
The waiter's recommendations for basil squid and Beijing rice were pretty good as well.  
Hope to visit again soon,  for the other dishes we could not try this time around.

Favourites are bansh pora chicken and butter garlic squid..
To experience an explosion of taste in your mouth must try is kimchi sea food salad has an awsum blend of chili and lemon.
Octupus dishes are also awsum..the chutney with jullu pitha
One stop seafood paradise.
Looking forward to many more visits..
Sad bit is the complimentary welcome drink has been discontinued:(

Tribal delicacies originating from different corners of India and Sea food make this eatery unique. 
Their Bansa Pora Mutton (mutton stuffed in Bamboo and cooked in tandoor) needs no introduction! The Wild Red Rice, another tribal item, is delicious and I haven't had such brilliant item before. They used to serve a complementary tribal drink before which they don't now. Among their sea food offerings, we had ordered Teriyaki fish, Chow Chu Prawn and Black Pepper Squid. All of them had generous portions. Black pepper squid left us spellbound. Since I have visited this place before it's worthwhile to try their octopus and squid items. Food: 5/5
We were waiting for 2 of our friends who were 10 mins late and despite having many tables empty, the waiter was kind of rude. In hospitality business, being polite to customers is quintessential so I hope the management shall be more courteous. Despite this issue, they did help us in ordering and service was prompt. Service: 3/5
Interior decors has a tribal touch. Their chairs are made with bamboos. The walls resembled that of tribal huts with thatched straw decorations. They serve water in Brass glasses just like our previous generations used to. Ambience:4/5
It's won't burn a hole in your pocket. Highly recommended.

I visited the Salt lake swimming pool restaurant
with two of my friends for lunch. The interiors are really innovative and the
food was awesome. They recommended us Bansa Pora mutton,Arsa Chum(chicken
infused in herbs and lemon),Jadoh(combination of red rice & mutton
pieces),honey chili prawn, seafood Beijing rice & the desert tilhou Kheer!!

Each and every item was the first of its kind
which we had. Staff was also courteous and the restaurant is very pocket
friendly.

¬†A must try for all!!!!

15/03/16 : Visited there today with a friend. The location is a bit odd hard to find but still managable with the landmark.. Its a themed resturant.. Ambience is nice.. Order served quick as it should be.. Coming to food - Its delicious no doubt but we didn't recieve the welcome drink cause we visited at around 4.00 and its the closing hour so a bit of rush was there.. We ordered:¬†
#Seafood Beijing Rice

#Smoked fish
#Cheesy tuna salad (though it should happen to be boneless we found small pieces fish bones in it)
All the items were very tasty specially the smoked fish. Overall experience was nice.

I really like this place. Both online and offline praises are floating in in the air, and my opinion is no different.
Of course it is a small place and though the decor has its own inimitable style, it is not bery good and nothing classy. But it is good nevertheless.
I don't need to talk about the food. Everyone has been singing a panegyric about it. I highly recommend:
# Banshpora Mutton
# Honey chilli squid
# Beijing Rice
#  Seafood topping noodles

(The steamed crab momo coating was thick and a little sticky)

Heard about this place for a long time now. Finally tried this awesome place on Saraswati Puja with friends. The quintessential Bansh Pora Chicken was the showstopper. All the good things I heard about that thing was true. Other than that we tried the rice noodles, shrimp and squid. The lunch was sumptuous  and the pocket friendly bill steals the deal.

Santa's Fantasea is really a restaurant of tribal and sea-food fantasy. One of their rooms have sea animals and mermaids painted on the wall, while the other had some tribal decorations. Along with that, bamboo-finished chairs and tables provide perfect ambience to enjoy their bench-marked tribal-food or sea-food. Even before you order something, complementary welcome drinks will arrive. Don't think of any mainstream sodas or mocktails, even this drink has a tribal origin. Well, as far as food is concerned, I mainly visited to try squid or octopus. Needless to say, I just loved them, and it even made me decide to visit the restaurant in near future to have some other variations. Mixed Seafood Rice and Squid in Chilli Garlic Sauce from the "sea-food" menu, along with Bansh Pora Mutton, a specialty, and Chicken Korigassi from "tribal" menu pampered my taste buds and left me to crave for more. I liked the fact that they have gathered tribal foods from different parts of our country and brought them in one place. To top it, the servicing was also at its best. Now coming to the price of  the items, well, the cost justifies the quality and quantity both. A total rating of 9.5 out of 10 is well deserved. I am eagerly awaiting my next visit to try some other items on their menu.

The restaurant has a tribal feel to it. The menu consists of a mix of tribal and seafood cuisines. We ordered bansa pora chicken and jadoh (Rice with mutton chunks;Meghalayan dish to be precise) from the tribal cuisine and tried the honey chilli octopus from the seafood part. I found the bansa pora chicken to be fine, properly cooked , tasted nice but a bit too hyped. Hopefully much talked about bansa pora mutton will satisfy my taste buds upto the mark the next time we go. The rice was perfect. The octopus was well cooked and tasted amazing. The gravy was tangy with proper amount of sweetness of the honey and hotness of the chillies. The quantity was very nice. One plate of each enough for two hungry fellows. And as they say Santa's fantasea never pinches your pockets. Very reasonable rates for the quality and quantity served! Great experience. Definitely going again to try some other dishes. :D

This place has been in my wishlist for a long tym and finally visited it.
Coming to the ambience..the decor is nice and decent but nothing spectacular and the place is quite small compared to its saltlake outlet.
It has a blend of tribal and seafood decor and it looks quite fascinating. However lack of space doesnot fully bring out the beauty of its unique decor.
Coming to the food ,We were a group of 6 and ordered the following:
1.Bansh pora chicken
2.Seafood Beijing noodles
3.Seafood Malaysian noodles
4.Wild red rice
5.Smoked squid
6.Burnt chilli prawn
7.Garlic butter fish
8.Teriyaki Chicken
9.Seafood Beijing Rice
10.Soru chakli (pic not taken)
The dishes that stood out was the smoked squid and the teriyaki chicken.
Banshpora chicken failed to impress me.. The taste was unique but had a strong taste of bamboo.. Also the quantity was low in this case.
The garlic butter fish was very subtle in taste. However it tasted bland coz we had so many spicy food before that. I would reccomend you take some other preparation of fish..
The burnt chilli prawn was just good..nothing spectacular..
The staple items which included rice and noodles were good and had decent quantity.
However soru chakli failed to impress me and tasted very average. Maybe its better paired with banshpora mutton or chicken as others have mentiond in their reviews.
The total bill came as 1650, which is actually quite cheap given the amount of food we had.
This place is tax free till date and wont burn a hole in your packet.
However service needs to be improved.. it was very very slow..i was amazed dat just 1 person was taking care of all the tables. Tipped him 50 bucks for his hardwork ..but srsly u guys need more men.
Not a spectacular affair as i had expected.. Looking forward to visit their saltlake outlet.

2nd visit.. Had ordered wild red rice, teriyaki chicken, jadoh and sea food salad for mains while dessert comprised prawn kheer..
Jadoh is a delicious dish. Shredded mutton chunks in a spicy red rice. Although i craved for more amount of tender chunks of mutton, but quantity wise it was good. The sea food salad could have been better both with quality and quantity to justify its price.
Teriyaki chicken is a good thing to order if u r not wanting either the tribal cuisine or any sea food. It was delicious with 8 pcs of chicken.
The wild red rice was a good nd cheap staple nd complements the side dishes well.
Prawn kheer was unusual. It was served cold. However it was sweet nd was refreshing.. the combination of prawn nd kheer is outrageous but not bad. The price has increased significantly since my last visit. However no additional taxes were levied.JASMINA BISWAS Debashmita Basu

Finally I went to Santa's Fantasea. I had heard
So much about it. Zomato is also full of good reviews about it.
Location- The restaurant is located in the street next to anjali jewellers golpark.

Theme- The restaurant is very insignificant from the outside. The theme of the restaurant is tribal. They tried to decorate the walls with tribal faces etc. The restaurant though isn't that big.

Service- The waiters were all very helpful and the food didn't take much time to arrive though it was a fairly crowded restaurant

Food- This place is amazing as for food is concerned. I have uploaded the pictures of all the food we ate. The food was very tasty and left us wanting for more even though our tummy was full. The quantity is sufficient for two be it the rice or the side dishes. Amazing food which really kept me drooling for more....
The dishes which we had were-
Smoked Crab
Wild Red Rice(Mizoram)
Wine Chilly Pomfret
Bansa pora Chicken(this is the recommended dish here)

Negatives- I was taken aback when The waiter told me they can't provide me with a knife.

Also the floor of the restaurant was very dirty.
Another thing which I am very curious about is the name and the cuisines and seafood, what is their connection? I wish there was some kind of write up for it.
But overall my experience was very good. O am definitely gonna visit this place again...

Not only has there been an increase in the prices AND addition of service tax and vat (this wasn't there before), but the food quality and service have also considerably deteriorated.

We had ordered Bansa Pora Chicken, Seafood Malaysian Noodles and Smoked Crab. The last two were pretty good, but the Bansa Pora Chicken is extremely overrated. Believe me, it tastes like burnt reshmi kebab. Also, there was hardly any meat in the crabs.

About their service: we had very clearly mentioned 'Noodles' but the waiter arrived wih rice instead, because he had taken the order wrong. The issue was immediately solved though. They served rice with a single strand of hair to the table beside us, and had to face some ruckus.

So overall I'm pretty much disappointed to say the least. I'd look for other seafood restaurants in the city and think twice before visiting Santa's Fantasea.

After reading several good reviews about this place, we were finally determined to head for some squid and octopus... There were 6 of us and it was a Sunday afternoon... Hence the space crunch was there and we did have to wait outside for our call. Once inside, the ambiance was great. The wall decor matched with their specialties-(tribal and sea food, mermaids, octopus). We ordered 7 different kind of preparations-->¬†
Jadoh,¬†chicken bansa pora,¬†beijing seafood noodles,¬†malaysian seafood noodles,¬†malaysian sea food rice,¬†oyster chilli basil squid, smoked octopus.¬†
Believe me, all of them were awesome to the last morsel. They take care in preparing each and every dish on their menu differently, as they are ought to be. Squid and octopus were delectable enough, will try again. Bansa pora was somewhat similar to chicken kebabs prepared in tandoor. One drawback was that they accepted only cash.
Pease visit if you are a foodie, enthusiastic about new, exotic recipe. Keep up Santa..!

I was there for the first time on 17th February, 2016. The joint is only 10mins walking distance from my place. I have heard great things about this place for the past few months. Though seafood is not my cup of tea, still decided to give it a go..we ordered the specialties i.e baanshpora chicken & another crab item. Both were delicious and unique in taste. The service was quite good..but one doesn't simply finish Santa's review without mentioning it's ambiance. It's totally unique. Tribal vibe exude from tables to table salt containers. There are some interesting items which I would like to try on my next visit. Oh did I mention, its super pocket friendly?

Pros:
1. Unique ambiance.
2. Delicious food.
3. Very economic.
4. Good Service.

Cons:
1. Location. Though it's at Golpark, but it doesnt have the luxury of being at a prominent position.

The ambience is nice...you can feel the difference in the ambience..as far as the food is concerned bansh pora mutton with the complementing bread is a very nice combination..but wait...if you are hungry enough and want to have a heavy lunch then the quantity will immensely dissapoint you...though the prices are tax inclusive but you will not be happy enough to pay 350 bucks for the bansh pora mutton..i will hope that they'l increase the quantity coz it's really tasty...the red rice is excellent and it will not at all dissapoint you for it being veg...and coming to smoked octopus the octopus is well cooked but the preparation is like an any time chinese side dish...

It took a while for this restaurant to start drawing in crowds mostly because of its location . The food they serve is so unique and so delicious that it has a 
que of customers waiting to go in even on week nights. The crowd favourite seems to be the bansh pora Mangsho. I am partial to the jhulu pithe and the spiced squid. Rather extensive menu so go with time to spare. The d√©cor is a terribly over powering and the most uncomfortable chairs in the planet. More so because the waiting time could be long. Best visited for a weekday lunch

This is what i like about Kolkta. You have these little restaurants popping up everywhere with good food. Santa's Fantasea is a liitle slice of heaven if you are into seafood. This place provides really good quality food with bold flavours that will make your taste buds come alive. The oyster chilli basil squid is just amazing and with the malaysian fried rice it like a perfect combo. This is one place that i would definitely visit over and over again whenever i'm near gariahat...

Coming to the sea food ,I am always apprehensive about squids and octopuses and their preparations because it is prone to stink at times...But the seafood preparation at Santa's Fantasea is amazing!!Thumbs up!!
The quantity,quality and price ;all are too good!!
Added brownie point ,the management and staff are very well mannered!!

A colleague of mine recommended this place for its speciality of sea foods. Went there with a friend of mine on Saraswati Puja evening. This outlet is located in Golpark just in the alley by Anjali Jewellers.

Car parking could be an issue on weekends / red letter days. The moment you enter the place you will be aware of their speciality seeng the paintings and the decor of the place - Seafoods and Tribal.

Its just three rooms of a building with the third having only two tables near the cash counter (yes you would find their owner most probably seating by your side and counting money and taking orders for home delivery :) )

We were asked to seat at a table for two in the second room but later was asked to move to the next small room as they had a group of nine coming in (Though I have heard that this is often done with customers but i dont hold it against them as it was a rush day)

Coming back to the decor, the tables and chairs were wooden and the doors are decorated with straws to give it a tribal look with brass / alloy glasses. The first room has a big octopus painted in the wall. The second room had one tribal man in one of the walls. Though the ambience and the decor is not overwhelming but still goes perfectly with the dishes they offer and their speciality.

Now coming to the food, we didnt try the tribal cuisine but as was pre-decided went for their sea-food offerings

We ordered the following

Seafood Beijing Rice
Honey Chilli Octopus
Schezwan Pepper Crab

All three were nicely cooked and if you want to try out something new you could definitely visit this place. Very Reasonable price which makes the experience worth more.

Am looking forward to try out their tribal offerings in the next visit.

Note - The way to the Hand Basin and Rest Room coincide with the staff's way to the kitchen and this floor is not cleaned properly and slippery - I want to draw the attention of the manager here...

May be I am the first who are going to criticize this restaurant..Today was my first entry here.After reading the impressive reviews my first preference was the grt "Bansh pora mutton".But the bansh pora mutton gave me a "bansh" viceversa.Because I find nothing interesting in it without the way its looks.Alltough they serve it and took the bansh away..may be it was the only bansh which they used to serve everyone.:() any way don't expect a great taste from it.Then the sticky rice was so-so..and the soru chakli was better than that.But the smoked prawn was better than best!! No word to explain.And was looking for the tribal drink,can't remember the name but didn't get it.Atlast I found the most gainer person,the icecrm man who was standing outside of the restaurant. He fulfil the whole thing.Don't miss it newcomers..:)

Hey you wanna hangout with your friends and want some octopuses and squids to accompany you, then you may have hit the right place in town!!! 

To start with, the outlet does not boast a overwhelming get up, but whatever they have decided to present to their customer is loud and clear - We specialize in sea food and some tribal cuisines.

Disappointing aspect of that place seemed to be there service.... Looked to me the place was understaffed, a waiter or two could have saved as from shouting 'dada dada'.... Nonetheless that is a kolkata feeling!!!! 

We also faced minor parking issues and some 10 mins waiting time - but that was totally acceptable, considering the fact it was saturday night... 
 ‚ö† beware of the fact there are no starters in their ever decreasing menu. 

Foods we tried :-
Oyester Chilli Basil Squid - Best of the lot. Preparation can be roughly attributed to chilly prawn served at Haka or Mainland China..... 

Honey Chilli Octupus - nicely golden - red cooked ocutpuses which seemed to have been pan fried and then cooked. 

Black pepper squid - reminiscent to the one we ordered before, but a little more spicy and squids were less cooked, but it was good. 

Teriyaki Fish - a dish ordered for safe keeping, in case we could not eat the other two üòÇ - you know after all mach mangso khanewala ko squid diya gaya toh you hesitate üòâ

Our ventrals craved for more so we jumped to the tribal menu..... 
Jadoh - Thick red rice with mutton mixed to each grain
Bansa Pora Mutton - yummy mutton roasted inside bamboo stem!!! Tastes awesome - gotta try those again.. 

After having all this we got hit with a 1500 paycheck - and we paid happily to live another day (after all so many dishes for 1500, who doesn‚Äôt want to visit that place again üòù)

The variety of sea food they offer is really. We ordered Basil Chilly Squid, Szechuan Octopus, Pepper Fry Tuna, Judah Nah and Bansa Porar mutton. Taste was just awesome. The place lived up to our expectation. Specially the squid was so good that we ordered another plate. And the price is very reasonable. I'll strongly recommend the place if you are looking for some good quality sea food. And please do try their Basil Chilly Squid and just ask them to make it a little more dry.

Within a few minutes reach from golpark ....along the vicinity of Anjali jewellers.
Starting with the decor... Its a visual treat to eyes...their theme is tribal ...wall paintings..... tables n chairs made up of bamboos......
They welcomed us by serving a complimentary drink called tankha turani...not so tasty though.
So we ordered shanghai squid, kimchi salad in starters... Then in main course wild red rice, Malaysian noodles, butter garlic fish, baansh pora chicken.
Each n every items were delicious.
Shanghai squid is very spicy n toothsome so was the salad...equally tasty.
Baansh pora chicken has a kind of smoky flavour as well tasty...garlic chicken is just out of the world... Though not a fan of red rice.
Its amazing place offering delicious tribal n seafoods within reasonable prices! Plus no taxes!
Hence recommended :)

Was waiting for long to visit this place... Had gone once before but being a Monday it was closed.
So it was today that we finally decided to visit this FANTASEAland with a friend of mine. Both of being foodies we had done our review research before and the concept delighted us.
As we entered the outlet the decor was completely thematic with amazing use of colours and lively decor which added to the ambience.
abundant use of wood was made to highlight the tribal theme- with wooden table chairs , tray, cruet set etc. We were served water in the copper glass and we set to look at the menu.
After much discussion we decided to go for seafood. We ordered for prawn momos which were OK
For the main course we decided upon chili wine octopus, prawn in hoisin sauce, Beijing noodles and seafood Malaysian rice which turned out to be truly remarkable in all sense. By the end of it we were completely full and thus could not proceed for dessert.
But we will make sure that next time we try the tribal food as well as the desserts they had  to offer.
A must visit place with good food and a unique concept

This place has become significant in providing the best sea food in town. A small place though you can get exceptionally amazing and sumptuous food here. If your tongue wants to touch the delicious sea food then Santa's fantasea is the place you should visit. The ambience is very normal. We ordered the much hyped dish #BanshPoraChicken which was served nicely in the bamboo and proves out to be as delicious as we expected. #SeafoodBelgianNoodles and #SmokedPrawn is what we orderd for the main course. Treating your stomach with #SmokedPrawn was worth it. Every item was very tasty, the quantity of food is more than enough and the cost is quite reasonable. You can give this place a visit whenever you want to stuff yourself with seafoods.

They serve a welcome drink, which I think is made of rice(?), It has lemon and is somewhat sour, I wasn't a big fan, but my friend looves it. Anyway, the decor is simple and not too over the top, it's cute. I have yet to try the tribal cuisine, I am a big fan of seafood hence I've always had that when I went.
All dishes are made really well, but my recommendations would be:
bansh pora chicken, smoked squid, shanghai crab.

I had kept it in my mind to visit this place but somehow could not make it, mainly due to fear for parking of the car here. The narrow and meandering lane where it is situated makes it very difficult to get a good parking space.
Anyway, today pangs of hunger drove me there. While walking there, I encountered a lady telling her company, " see that blue light(the signboard of this place)? It is fantastic. We should go there once."This shows the popularity of the joint.
A staff opened the door for me. I think they should keep a doorman. Anyway, I went in to find the outlet almost full, but they found me a place. The chairs are tastefully built with bamboos. The doors are decorated with straw. The walls are decorated with tribal mural, behind me there was a huge mask of a rakshasa wearing tribal jewellery. There were beautifully decorated Egyptian terracotta figurines. The table is adorned with wooden salt shaker and brass alloy glass. Everything in order to bring home the fact that this is a restaurant serving tribal food. Perfect.
I told the staff frankly that I was very hungry so as to get me something which could be prepared very fast. He suggested bansh pora mutton and shoruchakli. I doubted that it would be prepared soon but I gave in. Just 5-8 minutes later, he was back, carrying the blackened bamboo with him.
The mutton is soft and juicy and the smell of smoke and bamboo enhanced its taste. I did not like shoruchakli so much but consumed it anyway.  The dish was not very hot but suitably spicy and I really loved it. My hunger was satiated.
Then I once again asked for the menu. I wanted to try the rice drink but unfortunately it is no longer in circulation. Then my eyes fell on ngatok. I decided to try it. They said it would take 10 minutes to prepare it, and they kept their word, as
Within that time the dish arrived, wrapped
in banana leaf.
It contained two red pieces of fish, brought straight from the oven so
Very hot. I took a bite. It was soft and juicy and melted into mouth,  leaving a wonderful taste of lemon and aromatic spices. Outstanding.
The price is reasonable. The staff is attentive and polite. In spite of having several patrons, they paid equal attention to all.
Only my dissatisfaction is lying elsewhere. I would have preferred brass alloy plates and bamboo cutlery, but ordinary glass plate and steel cutlery disappointed me. Would the management do something about it?

Tribal Food, sea food at the heart of the city- well, this is the place! We had ordered Bansa pora with sharuchukli and Octopus rice, octopus tossed in sauce and squids in sauce.¬†
Bansa pora - a piece of matured bamboo which had been slit from middle, mutton marinated in mild spices put inside this slit and then sealed lightly. The bamboo had been then roasted completely, The mutton that came out was absolutely lip smacking! The spices, the smokey taste did the magic on the tender mutton. The mutton was perfectly cooked and without oil! This one is a must try!!

Squid - The squids were soft succulent and the sauces enhanced the the taste

Octopus in sauce - Tried octopus for the first time here. Found the sauces to be similar to squid.¬†

Ambiance and staff - simple yet very good. gives a tribal feeling :D

Must must try!!

My roots belong to Northeastern India, so am very much fond of tribal cuisine. When heard of this place was very eager to go because I have been to their sister concern Ecstasea & I know how they maintain their standard. Finally went their with my friends, firstly they welcomed us with their complimentary drink n than we ordered Basa Pora Chicken, Chilli Basil Oyster Squid, Bamboo Shoot Prawn, Seafood Malaysian Rice n Seafood Beijing Rice. All the items in the menu lived upto my expectations. Will surely visit again.

Liked the ambience and decor divided into tribal and seafood sections. The welcome drink was indeed refreshing (but might not suit everyone's palate). The Murton bansa pora and soru chakli were good but I found then a bit overrated. What I loved was the shanghai squid. Crispy and flavorful we ended up ordering 2 plates of it. The julu pithe was also flavoursome. Stuffed with chicken and egg. We rounded off the meal with Malaysian seafood noodles and kori gassi which were both awesome.

Santa's Fantasea - A pretty normal place with distinct servings.
=====
Intro + Location:

Santa's Fantasea is located in Golpark in one of those bylanes where Anjali Jewellers shop is located. I had got to visit this place with one of my friend. I had this place on my wish list since a long time and i finally got to hit it.¬†
The ambience of the place is nothing very extraordinary.¬†

I somehow felt this place to be over hyped on Zomato.¬†

Nevertheless, i went on trying what i felt like.¬†
=====
What i had here:-¬†

‚Ä¢ Wild Red Rice - The rice was very different and felt a little uncooked. Don't know if that's the way they prepare it. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Ngatok - It was red sniper fish i believe. It was really good. Tasted excellent. Was very tender. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Bansh Pora Chicken - It was different. The chicken was not as tender as i had expected it in my mind. Nevertheless, can give it or bansh pora mutton try.

‚Ä¢ Soru Chakli - Tasting it seemed kind of full of maida. Personally did not like it much.¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Location is always crowded.¬†
‚Ä¢ Different and unique dishes from palates of india served under one roof.
‚Ä¢ The owner is down to earth. He sometimes often serve tables. Thumbs up to hospitality.¬†

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Ambiance could've been much better.¬†
‚Ä¢ Food couldve been served smoky hot. Bansh pora chicken was not as hot as expected.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 200-350 max
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.7/5
Food Quantity 3.7/5
Food Presentation 4/5
Hospitality 3.7/5
Ambiance 3.3/5
Value for money 3.5/5
=====
Conclusion:

A good place if you want to try something different. They have got a variety of stuffs to offer taking from tribal rice, bread, horse mackerel, king fish, tuna, squid, crab, octopus etc etc. Worth a try!
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

And Yes I did not like Bansh Pora Chicken. ¬†I know its very strange that the most talked about dish is the one I did not like but it was not good at all. It was dry and coupled with a burnt smell, the experience of having it was one thing I would never cherish. Might be the Bansh pora mutton is Good but I have not tasted it so no idea about it. However, I liked all the tribal rice. Kori Gassi which is an authentic Mangalorian dish was good too. But In this restaurant I would prefer Sea food to the Tribal ones. their squid preparations are delicious. The Other sea food dishes are good too. The ambience is alright. The thing which I like the most is their welcome drink. A very rejuvenating drink topped with pudina leaves is a delight. The place is not that expensive also. Once in a while trying out here is what I recommend. :)

Wanted to try new cuisine so I selected this place today. Not too far from the main road of golpark,easy to find out.
Today I mainly tried their seafood cuisine
üîπcarb steamed momo
üîπseafood Malaysian rice
üîπbaked fish
üîπwine chili octopus
üîπteriyaki chicken
üîπprawn kheer
Each and every dishes are superb.
Crab momo‚û° momo filled with crab meat,nice taste but I was expecting some more filling.

Seafood Malaysian rice‚û°its a green colored rice containing seafoods.. I simply loved this one.

Baked fish‚û° another mouth watering dish...I liked  the mild smell of lemon with the cheesy flavours. MUST TRY It..

Chili wine octopus‚û°it was my first try in octopus.. But still it was not that bad.

Teriyaki chicken‚û° perfect blender of flavours with veggies... Not too spicy ,not to sweet.It just took my heartüòÑüòç

Prawn kheer‚û° one of the special item of their house,but I didn't enjoy it.....

I feel Ambience could be better,But Staffs are very courteous and I will come back soon to try their tribal cuisine.....

Located beside anjali jewellrs at golpark, this place is perfect to try seafood and tribal cuisine. Their tribal cuisine menu is pretty interesting. Bansa pora mutton and jadoh rice which is a red rice prepared with mutton pieces are highly recommended. We also ordered smoked squid, smoked octopus..both were equally tasty. The quantity that they provide at such a reasonable rate is quite appreciable. The space is small though but overall it was a nice dining experience with new cuisine to try out.

Such an excellent restaurant with some bizzare and great sea food. Had octopus for the first time and it was so tasty. The theme is very well sculpted inside the restaurant and the aroma of the seafood as soon as you get in makes you crave for it. We, four people ordered almost every best thing that we found on the menu. The banspora mansh was not that great nd it lacked spices, crack leaves tuna was yummy, the squid and octopus were the best ones, Malaysian noodles was soo good and the soru chakli was something very new for us. The quantity which they provide you at the price is seriously very good. The service was poor but it overcame by their overwhelming food. Surely gonna visit again!

And I have to say they were perfectly cooked. I also tried mutton baanshpora which was a total bliss. If you are a seafood lover or want to have tribal food definitely try this place. :)

Thanks to Zomato and their reviewers for suggesting this place on V-day. The place can be located easily. Let me highlight some cons so that it can be overcome before my next visit to this place.

Etiquette:
1. They don't give finger bowl after you have your food.
2. They don't offer any sweet/saunf at the time of bill payment.

Food:
1. As the tribal menus are not well known, they should give more details on menu card about the preparation.
2.The most hyped dish 'Banshpora Chicken' didn't seem that tasty. The chicken was not cooked property.

Now the best parts...
1. Lovely ambiance, stylish furnitures, cool ambiance.
2. Everyone should try their 'Ngatok'. A lovely preparation of vetki fish.
3. Wild red rice was good too. 
4. Best among all we had was 'Patro pora'. A fantastic mutton preparation.

We have heard that their new branch will open near Vivekanda Park on 15th April 2016.

Awaiting to have sea food their soon. With

Though I had tried the bash pora chicken before at the entrance of bora caves in araku but I found this much cheaper and tasty.
The squids are really awesome.the octopus was little small in size and little salty in taste.

Visited this place on a friend's advice and I must say, I was pretty amazed by the ambiance and the ethnic and indigenous feel to the restaurant. The table for two is quite cramped up (since the salt n pepper containers are there and then again the signature drink also occupies some place of the table!) and we had to sit still, lest if something fell down. We tried the Bansh Pora Chicken which was good but the quantity was less; it would have been better if it was a bit more. The staff members were cordial although some had an annoyed look on their face. I traveled all the way from North to Fantasea and the experience was passable.

If one want to be called a gourmet one must call on the less frequented places (eateries) to partake of unique dishes. So i along with my swashbuckling buccaneer set out for the restaurant called Santan's Fantasea to hunt for the hidden treasures. Located at golpark. Interior of the place boats of Tribal Arts decoration & artifacts, sea themed painting. I came here primarily to taste seafood & one thing that was missing in my platter since now was the mystifying sea creature "octopus". So i instantly ordered Schezawan pepper octopus & beijing rice. It was served instantaneously & without pausing i nibbled a tentacle. I had no idea that the otherwise creepy crawly eight legged slimy creature could taste so heavenly.¬† The rice & the gravy complimented each other. Next i orderd the sought after dish of the restaurant which is "Bansa Pora Mutton". Although it was to be eaten with soru chakli roti I ordered Malaysian Rice instead. The rice had balanced taste of Vegetables, onion & squid. The mutton was served in a burnt shell of bamboo shoot & had a predominant flavor of charcol & bamboo blended & mingled into soft tender & juicy mutton cubes. Really it was delicious. 
With this my journey ended for the day at Santan's Fantasea but needless to say I'll keep coming back for more gems. :-)

I heard the name of this restaurant from a friend. Then i was curious about it. I have dined in many places but never been in a tribal restaurant. So i went there with my wife and one friend. As one can see the the interior is decorated. According to tribal stuffs. Like masks bamboo glasses wooden chair and tables etc. The ambience is really good.

Now about the food. Ordered their famous two dishes banspora chicken and mutton with rotis. I was very much surprised to see the way the cook the food. It was actually a bamboo in which the meat was cooked. And the flavour was so much good. Mind was blown. The smoky flavour adds a punch in the taste. I will definitely recommend every food loving person to visit this place and have some great time.

Located in the lane just beside Anjali Jewellers in Golpark.

Ambience is not that great. The place is cramped with too many chairs and tables inside.

Service was good.

Both of us tried the Soru Chakli roti which wasn't that great.
Bans Pora Chicken alongside with it was well made.
Other than that, we had the Wild Red Rice which was very spicy and good to taste. With the rice we had Teriyaki Fish which was simply awesome. The fish piece was very soft and there was no such smell of the fish. We also tried the Smoked Chicken which was a dish made with lemongrass and tasty as well.

Pricing is very affordable and truely satisfied! Total bill came to 890/- for the two of us along with Coke.

A good experience :))))

TRIBAL FOOD, COOKED TERRIBLY BY A TERRIBLE COOK.
I'm not a negative person and not the kind of writing reviews... but after this bad evening i felt i had to!
we have been there for have some unique sea food.The soup was quite ok, the food really average.nothing special.we have tried Bansa pora chicken, we felt like the chicken same as Roll's chicken , just added some smoke. We have also taken another 3 dishes including rice, just want to say its better to say TERRIBLE FOOD not TRIBAL FOOD.
And most important things,,, service and hospitality is Horrible,  (-5/5).@Chef Animesh

Yes, you got it right and its not a human error, have rated 5/5. Now let me tell you why.

I am staying in Bangalore since last 6 years and tasted different cuisines, but this one was exceptional. Being a bong, the taste buds are always active and it tries to find the right food to quench its thirst. In brief:

1. Golpark branch. Ambience is soothing, service is efficient and fast. Didn't have to wait for long.
2. Food quantity when compared to the price is perfect.¬†
3. Their signature food, Baansh pora mangsho was extremely well cooked. Its unique in its own way and the meat was fresh, it stayed soft even after it went cold.¬†
4. I tasted King fish and let me tell you this, the fish was soft as butter. Never got such a perfect blend of lemongrass with fish.¬†
5. The list will go on, but I will stop here. The bill came WITHOUT any fancy service tax, VAT, cess, and all that crap. Bangalore restos are famous (or rather infamous) for adding these to inflate you bill.¬†

Undoubtedly, next visit to Kolkata will include Santa's Fantasea again.

Been here once with a friend. This is definitely an awesome place to try items which we never heard of before. I had Patro Pora and it is one of the rarest preparations i have ever tasted. put in one word it's simply awesome. In rice preparations one should try Jadoh, which is a simple dish yet a culinary art. In seafood section, I tried Shanghai Squid and no wonder it didn't dissatisfy my taste buds! For a starter you can order that too! Overall this place is awesome! Would have liked a better ambience and more space though.

Seafood at it's best.....though the staff were not well behaved and co-operative. The food was excellent. The price is reasonable and quantity is also ok. I really loved the octopus preparation. Chicken cooked in bamboo was not good, nagatok was very delicious. The only drawback is the space is small......otherwise seafood is awesome.

Famous for it's tribal cuisine, this place is one of the best eateries in kolkata. The must-have bansa pora chicken/mutton. Which is basically chicken/mutton small dices is prepared and stuffed in bamboo and burnt in flame. While serving the chicken/mutton is scraped out of the hollow bamboo into the plate. A burnt flavour is imparted into it. There is a variety of tribal breads, tribal rice items. They serve a welcome drink which is a tribal rice drink. This place is also famous for it's sea food. The decor is very attractive. There are two sections, one has the theme of a tribal hut and the other section portrays the sea food cuisine. I have had the bansa pora chicken, a tribal bread soru chakli, red rice and mutton. Food is excellent. Can't say the same for the service. But this place is worth a visit.

Well one fine morning I was stubborn that I will have my lunch at this place. I went there with a friend and ordered Bnash pora chicken, kung pao chicken and seafood rice noodles. According to me the food was good at the given price range and I am sure that this place has got some real kickass dishes to offer. Would like to explore more.

The food is just brilliant with a great ambience that will give you a tribal rustic feel. I have had ordered sesame chilli prawns, mongolian fish and seafood beijing noodles. Each of these dishes were impeccable. Crab momo, one of the greatest delicacy this place offers was sold out. So anyone wishing to grab a bite of crab momo should reach early or call them before hand. Banshe pora mutton and chicken are equally great as well. This is a unique place and one should give it a go once at least!

Doesn't seem a lot when you enter, but food is fantastic. Very rarely do we order 4 or 5 dishes, and everything seems perfect. Crispy fried prawn was the starter, and it reminded me of the 'bangali biyebari chingri maach bhaja' cooked by a 'ranna r thakur', truly great. We then went on to order Wild Red Rice, Kori Gasi, Butter Garlic Squid and their famous mutton Baansh Pora. The red rice was amazing, spicy but hit the right taste buds. Very delicious. The Kori Gasi, which was chicken in a green colored gravy, tasted very good, while the squid was, again, fantastic. The baansh pora was good, but it did not seem as great as the fame it gets, but good nontheless. Overall, the food is GREAT, at a very reasonable price too. Recommended for anybody who wants to taste traditional tribal food.

Before I type a single word .. a big applause for the person whose brainchild is santa's fantasea. The combination of tribal cuisine with seafood is just mindblowing.. it seems that their menu has been perpared keeping in mind the CALCUTTA TASTEBUDS. Without going into much detail of the deƒáor of this golpark restaurant i will only mention about the food they serve.. afterall it is this what drags people there. The welcome drink is a real winner . Went with friends for lunch and had ordered banshpora mutton i.e mutton prepared in bamboo shoot cavity .. though they serve a chicken variant but the mutton one is the match-winner. Slow cooked mutton with that smoky, burnt flavour will win your heart. I was disappointed with thier crabmeat momo.. i expected the presence of a bit more crabmeat inside. We have also ordered seafood rice which had squid in it ..this was well accompanied with octopus!! But ask me, i will suggest soru chakli .. i.e chapatis of rice flour witj banshpora mutton. However did not had the oppurtunity to taste their dessert but surely will complete that by my next visit.

Reached there at 2p.m. on 26th January and it took more than 45minutes to get a table. Decoration was okay for me as I have seen this kind of decoration previously. Let's come to happy and unhappy points of this restaurant-
Happy points:
1) attendants are good
2) manager is looking after all the customers
3) bansha pora chicken was a delicious dish for my partner

Bored with usual chinese, Thai, moghlai, dhakai, wanted to venture something new..hence tribal. Had decided the cuisine as per zomato and swiggy review and there wasn't an inch of disappointment. Kerala mutton soup, bans pora mutton, jhupu pisi mutton, red rice was our course. Good taste, adequate portions and reasonable prices fulfilled our appetite. Ambience was perfect except for the manager's temper. Doesn't need added recommendation as the quaint place had a good queue outside.

Have been here several times. Tried their mixed seafood rice and teriyaki chicken. The food was heart warming. I've also tried their signature baansh pora mangsho, squid, octopus and crab. All of them taste equally good. The octopus in black bean sauce was totally awesome! Also their soups are really good. Food for money and great for groups. Do try their crab momo. :)
And do ask for their help in choosing their signature dishes!

Located in golpark, this place will surely blow your taste minds.Be it ambience, be it food,be it cleanliness this restaurant excels in every field. We ordered" baansh pora mutton" which is buttery soft and will surely melt in your mouth followed by "Malaysian rice", "Beijing noodles", "spicy tangy chicken", "dragon  pepper chicken", "Shanghai fish" and last but not the least "chilly wine octopus". The fragrance of every dish itself is mouthwatering. Looking forward for more visits.

We went there around 2pm..it was a Sunday. .and was too crowded. .we had to wait for an hour to get in. We ordered the famous bansh pora mutton, jadoh,wild red rice,chilli wine octopus which were too delicious. The bansh pora mutton was tender  with a smoky flavour. As it was all dry food..they wished us to have jhupu pissis mutton..which was not that good. I didn't like ngatok, which is a fish preparation wrapped in banana leaf.
As a whole ..I would like to visit the place again

Service was VERY good. Food quality and taste was really good as well. Though I had never tasted squid and octopus before, (so I really won't be doing justice in judging the dishes on first tasting), the octopus however seemed a tad bit difficult to chew (as in 'sheddo' hoy ni types). I would definitely go back there again to try out the other dishes. We tried the Bansh Mutton, tasted like any usual North Indian dry Mutton dish which smelled like cigarettes (apparently that was the smell from the smoked bamboo). I honestly don't care about the decor (though it was really ethnic in style because when one is hungry, decor doesn't really do anything to make you eat well :P

Now, the thing is, this one is simply over-rated or outstandingly marketed restaurant of the new kolkata. The ambience nor the decor, is nothing astounding , rather just meet the requirements of its theme in a much cheaper way. We tried bansh chicken,which may be the most talked about dish of the restaurant, so more of a compulsion than fascination to try it, and also few fancy tribal names of which, dragon pepper fish was actually good, a mizoram dish. So in conclusion, a pocket friendly restaurant with bit out of the box food

Last December, me & my husband visited this place to have our lunch. We had ordered: Jadoh, Bansh Pora Chicken, Smoked squid.

As per place it is very accessible. Interior has a touch of tribal culture, which is really good. But the inside most table is quite small for two. First they serve a complementary drink which is quite refreshing but tastes not so good.

Food quality and quantity both are very good. I like Jadoah and Smoked Squid a lot. Bansh Pora Chicken is not suitable with rice but it has surely a good taste. Service is absolutely fine and price is reasonable. So, it is a very good place to taste the tribal food.

It is not every day that you come across a restaurant that has a really strange name but has good food.

It claims to have tribal food and that by itself caught my attention. I haven't been there but ordered in, I have been told that the seating is quite small.

We ordered quite a lot of stuff and not all of them were great. The ones I really liked was the Ngatok (fish wrapped in banana leaf) and the Baans Phora Mutton (mutton cooked in bamboo stick).

The Chinese part of the menu can be avoided and you can stick to their core competencies.

Overall, it is always nice to try something new and the lack of oil would definitely be a healthier option though one has to get used to the smoky flavour.

Another point (though I don't personally Care about it), there is nothing for vegetarians. üòú

Went there last Sunday for dinner after hearing good things about it. Thought a small place tucked into the bylanes of golpark would be vacant enough to find immediate seats. How wrong was I. The place was chockablock with people waiting outside. That's always a good sign. Got a table after half an hour and man was it worth the wait. The food was delicious. Must try the bnaashe pora mutton and Malaysian seafood fried rice.

Had been there for lunch a few days back. It was a treat from my friend who recently got placed. Last time when I came to Santa's Fantasea, this place hadn't become so popular. That day we had to wait for twenty five minutes almost due to the rush there for a late lunch on Saturday. This place is the first joint I found out in Kolkata to introduce such a vast variety of seafood and tribal cuisine hand in hand. Recently many more has come up following this trend.
On that day, we had Seafood Lung Fung Soup at first. Then we ordered Wild Red Rice, Jadoh, Bansa Pora Mutton and Honey Chilli Octopus. The mixture of this tribal cuisine and Chinese seafood preparations is a bit weird, but I liked it still. The soup was really good. The rice were also tasty, on the spicier side. The Bansa Pora Mutton I had earlier, they have improved a lot since then. The food is really good. But points have been deducted for the staff inefficiencies and inadequacies. Otherwise, Santa's Fantasea is a great place to have an unique meal experience at a pocket friendly rate. Happy Dining! :)

But food could had been better prepared and served hot...had the baansh pora chicken (bamboo shoot burnt chicken)  was nice ..there was smokiness flavour... That's it.. It lacked everything else including the hotness which it is supposed to have as coming from tandoor...and squid was way too chewy
..might go back sometime.. But not soon

Hello¬† guys, i am so excited that i am finally getting to write a review of this place. If anyone checks out the other reviews they are mostly around 4.5 and 5 . This is like the hottest place and everyone is talking about. I maybe one of the last few people in finally getting to this place . So is the hype really worth it ??

A big juicy "YES" . This is one of those places where you will go back again and again and still have the same vibe . Today's review will be based on the tribal dishes that they serve. There's nothing much to talk about the ambience apart from the tribal and marine wallpapers which were nice to look at . As for the seating¬† it is¬† a little¬† problematic for people going in big groups. Now straightaway to food .We had the following tribal delicacies :-

1. Bansa Pora mutton (4/5 ) - 
2. Patra Pora mutton(10/5) <--- Yes you are reading it right !!
3. Kukhura Ko Masu ( 3.5 / 5)
4. Ngatok ( 4/5)
5. Wild Red Rice ( 10/5 ) <--- Yes you are again reading it right.

There's not much to brag about "Bansa pora Mutton ". It is lovely but the thing is "Patra Pora" mutton is even better. Oh my what a dish . These 2 mutton delicacies are probably the hottest thing to talk about in south Kolkata. As for the quantity it would be better the dishes are shared by at most 3 people. "Kukhura ko masu" was a little bit of dissappointment for us because the dish was a lot like szechwan chicken. But still it was well prepared. The " Ngatok " was superb. It had a tinge of lemon flavor in it and the fish was soft as hell . Yummy stuff !! But what made my evening is the "wild red rice". I still cannot get over it . It was so well made and the spices were spot on. It is the most apt side dish to have with the meat. 

Coming to service the guy was really well behaved and managed really well especially when the place was really full. The only con was that none of the tribal deserts were available which was a huge letdown. But on the brighter side it will drive me to go back again which i anyway will . so :)

We discovered this little gem of an eatery while on a girl's day out with Rhitabrita Mukherjee. Its cozily tucked away on a lane near the Ramakrishna mission institute and its prettily decorated with tribal artwork. We were welcomed with a complimentary drink(a kind of sherbet which tasted wonderfully tangy) and we ordered their signature dish baans pora chicken which had a delicious smoky flavour. We wanted to try something new and had butter garlic squid which was awesome(and I'll be going back for more) along with wild red rice which was quite tasty.One of my friends had fried mackerel and proclaimed it delicious.

When it comes to the tribal cuisine, the food is delicious. Bansh Pora, Potro Pora were great including the red rice and the other rice items. The seafood cuisine has a lot of variety but is very generic and tastes like most Indo-Chinese food. I was very disappointed with the service. Although we were the 3rd to enter the restaurant, they didn't even serve water for 15mins and the drinks were served in broken/cracked clay cups. Its high time they  think about increasing their manpower seeing the popularity of the place. I won't mind if they increase their prices a little more. Just because the food was heavenly, I am giving it a 3.5.

Me and my wife planned to visit Santa's Fatasea six months back after hearing a fantastic review from our friends. Finally, we got an opportunity to viait thia mecca of flavours. Firstly the ambiance took my breath away as usually u not get the chance to sit on a Flinstone chair. The decoration is done so well that pne can understand that this restaurant has a treasure of sea and tribal food.

Me and my wife both r foodie hence we deal with numerous diahesh at a time ao that we can share but we should not waste. On this motto we order Bans Pora chicken along with Red rice preparation and Kimchi sea food salad on recommendations. After waiting hardly 15 mins our dishesh arrived. The moment Bans Pora chicken was out from the Bamboo an aroma spread which contained sweetness of bamboo and tangy taste of the chicken. Believe me my taste buds went crazy to taste it. The mesmerising taste took us so crazy that till we completed a stock of chicken we remained silent only the expression of satisfaction was reflecting from our faces. The Kimchi salad was a cherry on the cake. Its taste was awesome i dont have much words to deacribe it. The squid taste made my day. Service was excellent however the day was too much hectic for them. I am going to visit again and again till I finish all the dishesh

I went there with expectations after reading the reviews here but got a shock. The ambience was good enough as well as the decor but the food was awful. We ordered prawn momos but found no prawns in it. The seafood salad was not prepared with fresh vegetables and the mayonnaise was prepared  with sugar and curd. We found chunks of sugar in it. Ordered a king fish pepper fry and the fish was not fresh and it was stinking. We have never found such poor quality of food in any kolkata restaurant yet.

To start with one must know that it is located close to Anjali jewellers. For easy direction let me tell u, its not on the main road so its not easily visible. One has to enter into the lane only then can u spot it. The food was not as expected especially for my first visit. Thoroughly disappointed. I had read so many reviews regarding the food so had very high expectations from it. But after ordering the much talked about Bansa pora mutton we were aghast by the taste of it. It tasted of burnt food. It seemed as if they were trying hard to make it like kathi rolls but definitely failed at it. Even the crab momos which are supposed to be steamed were cold. Service was very very slow even though we were the first to arrive for dinner. Their complimentary drink Tankha turani was tasteless. The plain water tasted better than that. The smoked crabs and burnt chilly octopus had the same base. Only an addition and subtraction of ingredients. The crabs were babies without claws. Even for that reasonable price it was not worth it. Supreme soup was okish. Had the soup twice just to fill my stomach as i was very disappointed by the food. Even the Beijing seafood rice only had few sprinkles of so called seafood. No doubt its called a tribal cuisine. But its upto ones taste. I gave a score of 2 only because of the ambience nothing else.

This small seafood and tribal cuisine speciality restaurant is located next to the Anjali Jewellers shop in Golpark, has food which is to die for. We had close to 6 dishes, and for the the first time in my family history, we didn't have to pack anything back home! I'm not much of a seafood person and I this place has converted me into a seafood person. Each dish has a distinct flavor no matter how similar they look, so brownie points for that. Not trying out the food here would be a huge mistake.

Nice place. Food with a different angle.Tried banshe pora mutton (well the smoky flavour was nice) and some other dishes including squids,octopus. Taste was good overall but a few points i would like to mention.
Hardly anything veg was there in the menu (would really appreciate if they add some more dishes in that section)
Secondly the service personnels seemed to be over burdened by the number of customers and were getting irritated at times.service was also slow due to that.

Apart from the above mentioned points, kudos to the team SF for introducing such an unique cuisine and maintaining the quality level consistently.

A fabulous addition to the Kolkata restaurant scene. The restaurant offers two cuisines - Tribal and Seafood, the decor is also done with different tribal wall paintings. Now coming to the food, ordered the bansa pora mutton, wild red rice, teriyaki fish and honey chilli octopus. The bansa pora mutton is a dish to savour, the flavour of mutton perfectly complemented by the aroma of smoke. The teriyaki fish was tasty. It was my first time that I tried octopus, and was not disappointed and would in future go and surely try out other octopus delicacies. The other great feature is that the dishes are very reasonably priced and there are no additional taxes charged!

Chose from their list of tribal food. It was very  good. Very different and a welcome change. Pocket friendly and a great place for lunch with friends. I found it a bit crammed. It was full at 3 on a normal weekday! But that speaks more of their popularity than lack of space I suppose. Looking forward trying every new thing they have on their menu.

I am totally disappointed to dine at Santa's Fantasea on the 31st Dec 2015. First thing after the menu card is offered I could not make out are we at a sea food joint or at a Tribal food joint. The food is very very very average specially the chicken recipes it was just some fancy name given to a normal crispy chicken. I went there with my family with high hope for some coastal sea food delicacies but all in vein - we ordered for fried Tuna fish which was served cold with a super gross presentation -in one word a total FLOP!!. We ordered Mackerel fish in wine sauce, though the name is more mouth watering then it originally taste. The price is exorbitant and quantity for such over priced food compared is very less. The place is all crowded and stuffy and the overall service is utter poor, and as the name suggests you'll find nothing about Santa or his fantasea. ;) So a big NO for this place.

I love the complimentary drink they serve. I have tried many items. Amongst them I like seafood Malaysian rice, butter garlic squid, teriyaki chicken and chemmeen kheer. I also tried jhupu pisi's mutton with soru chakli- a good combination. Infact all the food they serve is authentic. Visit to Santa's fantasea is highly recommended.

This restaurant houses one of the best seafood and so-called tribal cuisine, at a nominal price. Paintings all over the place and wooden tables add to the ambiance. I found "Bas diye jaay chena" quote is apt when I tasted the Baspora Mutton. Simply great flavor with a touch of bamboo. Octopus was a new try, a bit on the crunchy side. Wild red rice is fabulous with chopped squids. Tuna fillet was tasty too. Crab momos, I was disheartened as the meat filling was less.
Cons: Wait time is a lottttt. The place is cramped. Service is poor, as I literally had to call them multiple times to serve to dish, provide water and even to give the menu card!!

Probably the best low budget with a great food resturant at Kolkata. I am really pleased to be there and now a fan of this resturant. The only issue is that they should have some more men to attend, however starting from their behaviour to the dishes... Its awesome!!! Loved it and highly recommended..

Complementary tribal drinks was so mild that it test like water. Bansa pora mutton is just test like mutton roll inside stuff with some smokey smell. Nothing special except inside decor and  ambience. Not taken any service tax or vat. Just hand made bill written with pen. I strongly feel that food was overcharged and not beneficial comparison to price so not recommended. My rating for the abovementioned specific food as am not tried other tribal food and other sea food yet.

Wanted to try a new cuisine today, hence this place. Not very difficult to find. Had to wait for 10mints before the three of us were allotted a table. We ordered bansa pora chicken, seafood Beijing rice, seafood Malaysian noodles, oyster chilly basil octopus and a bottle of cold drinks. 
I won't be able to describe how it felt to have the bansa pora chicken. It was simply out of the world and a must try for everyone. Rice and noodles were both immensely tasty having respective flavours of their own. The quantity was more than what we were expecting at that price.. I tried octopus for the first time and I must say that I was not at all disappointed. The pocket pinch was also not much and hence I would recommend this place to everyone. Lovely lunch after ages.

I always loved this place but this time I was disappointed. After waiting for 20 minutes a group of people who came a minute ago were given a place to sit while we had to wait for another 10 minutes. It should be clearly mentioned that this place decides whom to give seating preference at their own discretion. I'd hate to go to a place like this no matter how delicious the food is. It's important to remember that service plays an equally important role. I don't think I'll ever visit this place again. I'm simply disgusted with their behaviour...

An absolute gem of a place !! I had heard abouth this and finally made a plan on Christmas to have a date with Santa on the special day. 
The complimentary drink Tankha Turani was the rice drink from Odisha and I did not like it. Thats personal opinion though.
We had ordered Baanshpora Mutton, Soru Chakli, Teriyaki Fish, Smoked Squid, Wild Mizoram Rice and Chemeen Kheer.
The mutton was an absolute delight and its a must for anyone visiting this place. Lovely ! It goes pretty well with Soru Chakli and hence the order. The smoked squid was great, but the Teriyaki Fish was out of this world. The taste and aroma and the fish pieces were wonderfully cooked and it was fabulous.
Lastly the chemeed kheer was a cherry in the cake. Chemeen is prawn as the menu card says, but you hardly get the smell of it as the kheer was an utter delight.
Highly recommended for everybody.

Tip: Reach early to avoid the long queue of waiting list.

The extremely high rating on zomato and their huge menu attracted me to this place. To say the least, I was quite disappointed.
In the mood to try out their seafood I asked for their suggestion from their squid section and ordered their Shanghai Squid which turned out to be quite a let-down.
The squid had a very thick coating/batter and was over fried which kind of ruined the intrinsic texture of the squid. Neither did the sauce in which it was cooked in, taste any better.
The Baansh Pora Mutton is supposed to be a dish in which the Mutton is supposed to be slow cooked inside a bamboo stick. Having had other variations to this dish before, I was expecting the meat to have the smoky charcoal taste that comes along with this preparation. However, it felt as if the mutton was cooked separately and stuffed into the Baansh. Either they are over booked or under staffed coz a dish like this takes time and they were surely not doing their complete bit before serving this dish.
The last item on our order was the Wine Chilly Octopus which was the only saving grace of the evening. The octopus was well cooked and the accompanying soy chilli sauce elevated the taste of the dish.
I'm sure the high ratings are for a reason, but if they continue on this path and start compromising on their quality, their reputation is sure to suffer.
Another plus point of this place is the pricing of the items which is extremely reasonable and value for money.

The place speaks of it itself. The place was crowded when I went there. The staffs couldn't gv proper attention to us..but that can be forgiven. The restaurant provides a complimentary drink which is a bit different to my taste but I liked it. I took their special soup as my appetizer and trust me its the best soup I had till date. Then I had jadoh, cracked leaves squid (this dish is just awesome) and had bansh pora chicken (now I personally didn't like this dish so much due to the intense exotic smell of burnt bamboo). Overall it was a good experience hanging out there with my boyfriend.  The ambience was good. The  place was crowded and by that you must have understood that  its a great place for having food.

Santa's Fantasea - I meant to visit this place for a long time now. So tonight, after office, my wife and I finally decided to give this place a try. Well first and foremost, nice location. Very accessible and easy to find. So full marks for that. Nice cosy place - the service was very warm but the expertise is lacking. Then, again, that can be improved with a bit of effort. Now, coming to the best part. The Food. Absolutely amazing. We had chilli wine Tuna, butter garlic squid, bashpora mutton and Soru Chakli. The subtle flavors oozing out of every bite complemented the aroma beautifully. The strange(?) mix of tribal food and regular seafood left a riot of tastes in our mouth. The menu had a lot more to offer but alas we were full. Speaking on behalf of my wife and myself...we will be back! Soon! All the foodies out there - do not miss this one. PS - very easy on the pocket too!

A perfect place to taste seafood and tribal cuisine.. May be I am very late here to post this review about this awesome restaurant.. Really fingerlicking and mouthwatering food they serve u here.. U can't even differentiate between which is good which is not.. 
Now something about food
Started from Bansa Pora( Chicken) an awesome starter a perfect dish to start ur food journey in here.. 
Another starter as Crab Momo(Fried) another perfectly juicy one with each and every bite u can taste the juciyness of meat fillings. 
Now Main Course (Non-Veg)
Wild red rice with teriyaki chicken and Tangy sauce chicken.. U should Jhulu pitha here to taste the authentic tribal cuisine with kukhura ka masu (a dish from Sikkim) Boneless chicken with coconut paste fresh herbs and spices. I think ur mouth is getting watered after seeing the review.. Shanghai octopus is delicious üòã with soru chakhli .. And in Veg u should try Baby corn Pepper Mushroom üçÑ.. Lets now try out this restaurant at least once.. I m guaranteed that u never be disappointed here.. The service is also good here.. That's all..

It was an anticipated visit. Was lookin forward to this for a long time. One of the best seafood joints in town and it does live up to that category for sure. But.....
The three of us ordered Red rice, Jodah,Butter garlic fish, Schezwan pepper crab and Jhupu Pishi's Mutton, all in ample quantity. I would prefer the red rice over any fried rice I have ever had along with fish. The crab was my first time ever, and was a delight to have, although a tough task for a beginner. The fish was buttery smooth and very tasty. Jodah and Jhupu pishi rice both mutton dishes did not impress me although my friends liked it. Jodah was over spiced and jhupu under spiced as per my liking. All this for just rs.1000. I call this one of the best seafood in kolkata.

Would have given it 5 rating but.. This and my initial 'but' was just due to the fact that I was not satisfied with the service. I know it is a small place but 3 people cant be accommodated on a table for 2. We had to wait for almost half an hour but had to compromise as hunger got the better of us. Also when crab was asked to be brought as the starter, we get the mutton and fish on our table first. We had the crab while the others were there getting cold. And yes the rice needs to be cleaned well, we found small hard grains of stone in a bite of Jodah.

I had high hopes. The service disappointed but the food didn't. Will come back surely for more seafood, hoping to have a better dine-in experience.

Desire for seafood brought us here in a tiny street near Gol Park but the recommendations drove us towards the tribal genre. Had the best possible mutton as banshpora mutton along with the sticky rice whose aroma itself won us over.¬†
Despite being a little skeptic about sea food, burnt chilly prawn is undoubtedly the best prawn I have ever tasted.
However, were a little disappointed with the unavailability of crab momos and the over-spicing of smoked octopus.¬†
On the whole, the 20 minute wait outside due to the demand was worth it.

Ordered bansh mutton and a Sikkimese specialty. Both were at best average. The Sikkimese dish is a watered down version of Tangra style Chinese chicken dish.

Ambiance was good. Will I return? No. This restaurant is at best a one visit one.

Wonderful place to try something different. We went there today for dinner and, as suggested by the reviews, ordered Crab momos, Seafood Lungfung Soup, Sticky rice, Banspora chicken and Wine chilly octopus. All of them were delicious. The service was prompt and quick. Very satisfied.

Visited after seeing Zomato's review. Small little shop in lane next to Anjali Jewellers. Tried sticky rice, garlic butter chicken , bans pora mutton and chakuli roti. The dishes were all excellent and lipsmacking. The onion kheer was also amazingly tasty. Downsides - need to improve cleanliness , especially of toilet and area leading to it. Did not have any of the boneless varieties of fish or icecreams. The staff except one were not at all knowledgeable about the dishes - what they had and what to recommend.  Need to improve on these to rise above small time !

There was a big hype around Santa's Fantasea because of its sea food. But I personally felt the place is good for snacks and particularly for a young crowd. It offers sea food like octopus and squid( among my favourite sea food) at an affordable rate. Would love to see scallops in the menu in near future. The no VAT n ST part was a little relief since its pocket pinching for us students to pay extra amounts for ST and VAT elsewhere. As a whole the experience was good but hope to see a more flexible menu.

Yes as everyone says "have the banshpora mutton" ITS AMAZING. The food was an absolute delight. The rates are very reasonable owing to the quantity and quality of the food. My reason for giving .5 less as I feel the ambience could be better. :)

The place claiming to serve exotic seafood and tribal cuisine had been on the wish list of our gang for quite sometime. Afterall... who doesn't want to savor on unusual delicacies once in a while? We reached the place around 8 in the evening and found it already full.After waiting for about half an hour we were ushered inside the eatery decked up as a tribal cottage. The menu attacked us with cuisines from the north-east and when one of our skeptical friend asked a waiter "Do you guys serve anything normal over here?" he got a quick "NO,nothing normal here!!" for an answer... LOL :-D

We ordered an array of items(We would have ordered the whole menu if we had the luxury of elastics purses and tummies),starting off with crab momos,smoked octopus,bamboo burnt mutton,stir fried squid,prawn wafers and many more.The momos were rich with vibrant flavors and just melted in our mouths.The octopus was cooked in a nice caramelized sauce  and had a distinct kick in it and the mutton along with its earthy aroma just won our hearts(tummies i.e.).But the real winner of all were the tiny squids bursting with a crisp tangyness.We all loved it and kept asking for more.

The ambience was good,the staff friendly and I would have rated the restaurant 5 out of 5 had it not been for the weird welcome drink we were served.It was supposed to be a special tribal drink(old rice sodden water),but somehow it killed our tastebuds,forcing us to push the glasses away. Anyway, visit the place if you are one spunky human eager to try out new exotic food right in the heart of the city but steer clear out of it if you are the traditional bloke.

It's a nice experience...an exclusive collection of treasured tribal and sea food. .Basapora dishes,  smoked octopus and squids are a must eat. ..Located at the heart of South Kolkata and a cool ambience combined with economical a la carte dishes makes it a gourmet's paradise.

It is really sad that I have to write something disappointing regarding a restaurant that was in my wishlist since its inception. Santa's Fantasea has become a household name for the foodies in Kolkata and that has definitely heightened expectations among a lot of us. We tried out different octopus, squid, Manipuri sticky rice, julu pithha, baby corn mushroom as part of starter, wine chilli mushroom and noodles. The octopus n the wine chilli mushroom preparation seemed stale and as a result exuded foul smell. The sticky rice was a lot like ghee rice and was a delightful experience. For vegetarians the place is a huge turn off.
The service was forced and some of the staff were really rude. We wanted to sit for long hours and hence was ordering at a leisurely pace. However they made us feel quite unwelcomed and we had to hurry. I hope the management looks into the issue and make the ambience much more customer friendly!

P.S. I loved the complimentary refreshment ‚ò∫

You have to accept that this place is highly popular now. The moment I reached there, I noticed a large queue waiting outside. It is located at a very prominent place, on the lane of Anjali jwellers in Golpark. It is very, very hard to get a place there and be prepared to stand in queue. 

The food needs a special mention. We ordered only seafood and the soups had a topping of squids, octopus, prawns. It was extraordinary. The pan fried noodles was mind blowing. I dont remember the name of the dish though, but never tasted any better noodles after that.¬†
Waiters are arrogant and the 'we-can-do-without-you' ¬†attitude reflects in their faces.

Loved the food here. Typical orissa cuisine. The tanka torani and the bansa poda mutton are a must try. Service is quick, staff is polite. Reach quite early if you wish to avoid a long waiting period.¬†
The sitting area is quite less and that makes it a bit congested. This is irrelevant once the food arrives on the table. :P

I was quite sad about my experience at Santa's Fantasae ! We were a group of 10 who had gone as instructed by 7-30 pm to celebrate a friends birthday ..... despite all of us except two reaching we were squeezed on to a six-seater by an extremely rude staff member who stated that until the guest does not arrive a bigger table can't be provided ! A few minutes later a four seater next to us became vacant and we repeatedly requested the staff to add that table to our other four-seater and replace the two -seater that was attached to our table we were rudely refused and the staff member Sanjay kept misbehaving. Considering we were celebrating a birthday everyone was getting quite upset ..... finally via a fellow foodie I managed to contact Mr Kaushik the owner of the establishment and the matter was somewhat sorted out with his intervention.
This place is undoubtedly popular and somehow I feel its got rather carried away by its popularity. The rude and arrogant behaviour of the staff member was quite shocking and the worst I have experienced in Kolkata in quite a while. The food was good but not great I would have rated the food a 3 had the service experience been better. Not a good place for vegetarians but the momo's were decent as were both the prawn dishes we had Fried Prawns and Prawn in Burnt Chilli. The best dish which was different was their signature Basa Pora Mutton which everyone enjoyed. I hope this serves as a wakeup call and they stop being carried away I would think twice before going back as would all those on our table who were truly appalled at the horrible behavior displayed. A disappointing experience we expected so much better !

A small resto in the lane of golpark,santa's fantasea has become quite popular for mainly tribal cuisine.with unique north eastern dishes this resto was a must visit for some time now.they served one welcome drink made of rice which was refreshing.we ordered banspora mutton, kori gassi,kerala mutton soup and rice roti.soup was very nice.it had small minced mutton pieces,gondhuraj lebur pata and coriander.
The roti made of rice flour was ok.nit very great.but i guess its exactly how it was made earlier days.banspora mutton was good.the flavour of bambooshoot and charcoal was quite strong.prices are reasonable.and ambience decent.probably i will visit again to try on the other dishes.nd yeah menus reminded me of visiting north eastern states. :p

Decor was really good. One of the most beloved themed restaurant in Kolkata. It boasts of the best tribal & sea food cuisine in the city. Mutton Bash pora didn't disappoint as their signature dish. Red rice was okayish. Was a bid skeptical about sea food cuisine as it consisted of octopus and squids. However, went with smoked squid  and it was pretty good. Tribal welcome drink was a nice gesture though it didn't taste that good. Rates are too reasonable for a restaurant that has got zomato award for being the sea food joint in the city!

I must admit I have been quite late in drafting this review, considering that I'm writing this after I've visited this place 6 times. 

Firstly, a truly innovative restaurant.  Secondly, it understands sea-food. And thirdly, the prices are not drilling a hole in your pocket. 

The flagship dish is of course the BaNshpora Mutton and I've seen people queuing up for takeaways of this dish alone. This is a unique dish from the North-East and also from Orissa. The beauty of this dish is its cooked almost without oil, smoked with spices inside a bamboo piece (as the name would suggest). 

Other unique items are the Octopus (several dishes, so feel free to try any of them). The mentionable part of it is that it's super soft, not at all rubbery and comes with a fraction of the cost they'd charge you in a comparable hotel. 

Coming back to the tribal foods, do try the Ngatok (fish) and the Shoru Chakli (a soft damp piece of bread that's very similar to your 'pithey'). Actually there are a lot of dishes that would tempt you to visit this place again & again if you're in a mindset to experiment. 

The ambience - quite small. Can accommodate at most 5 tables. So be prepared to wait in a long queue if you're running late. 

The proprietor Mr Kaushik is a whole-hearted guy who'd spend good time with you explaining the various dishes, their history, etc, if you insist.

A restaurant that understands what is meant by sea food. It would live up to your expectation if you have octopus, squids and lobsters in mind. Excellent in quality. We also tried tribal rices, but I'd prefer to give it a pass. Rather go for rice noodles. Oh and btw you're supposed to get an introductory drink, but that is subject to availability it seems. Service is average, and the outlet is pretty small. Once in a lifetime one needs to drop in here if in Kolkata.

Heard alot about this place and finally visited yesterday. We ordered Bans Pora Chicken and Mutton (better), Jadoh Rice, Seafood Malaysian Noodles, Sanghai Squid, Smoked Octopus (trying 1st time) and Burnt Chilly Prawn. I found this place quite over hyped than actual. It's true that they are trying something different which is appreciable but still its not upto the expectation. Location and decor was good with Bamboos, Pocket pinch absoulutely ok.

It was my first visit to this themed restaurant. First thing that impressed me was it's ambience. We started with a tribal dish - chicken in burnt bamboo shoot, smoky crab, Malaysian noodles and dragon chicken. Service was bit slow since we had visited on Saturday evening and there was a lot of rush. The cuisine was pretty new to me though I liked their noodles and pora chicken in bamboo shaft. Overall a good experience as I could try something new. Would like to revisit to experiment on some more dishes. Prices are also pocket friendly.

firstly the restaurant does not look good from outside, though the inside is much impressing . once four of us went there on a monday afternoon and came to know that it remains close on mondays . never mind went there again . this time on a wednesday , ordered for their famous dish basha pora mutton and wild red rice . they served us welcome drinks , a tribal drink , which was not excellent but certainly good and much different from the drinks we are used to. 1 thing which i did not like is that, they gave us mineral water bottle of kinley in place of normal drinking water so had to pay 30 rupees extra for the bottle ( although its mrp printed was 20 ) next came the wild red rice and basha pora mutton, the quantity could have been better but taste was excellent same goes for the rice. the rice seemed to be a little less cooked so we had to chew it hard. may be the dish itself is like that i dont know. we were two and the net amount in the bill was 580. one of the uncles present there told that they are running out of change so couldnt give back the change ( although i wouldnt have took it ) the service could have been a bit faster . lastly i would like to mention that they dont have any waiting space . when we came out of the restaurant , people were standing in a huge line which seemed funny. al together an average experience . but they deserve a special thanks as they are giving an opertunity to taste few awsome tribal dishes .

Location- 4.5/5

Food- 4.5/5

Ambiance- 4.5/5

Service- 5/5

First of all, a quick suggestion, google map shows an entirely different location if you try to follow that. Go by the address written in Zomato. Take the lane left to Anjali Jewelers, Golpark and you'll be able to locate this place after a 1/2 min walk.

Coming to the ambiance, we found a table in Tribal section and I have to say, the decor is very different from what you are used to see in other restaurants. Lovely!

Coming to the food, everything we tried was completely new to our taste-bud and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had perfectly cooked Honey Chili Prawn for starters, and quantity was more than I expected. We felt Bansh-pora Chicken was a bit overcooked, but the smoky flavour compensated for it. I was a bit skeptical to order sticky rice, but it left me awestruck with a dominant aroma of ghee and a subtle garlic flavour- brilliant is the word for it. Soru Chakli was decent- soft and moist. Kori Gassi again proved to be a brilliant discovery- big pieces of chicken in green curry (coriander + palak leaves I guess).

One let-down is that they didn't have any dessert available at that time.

Service persons are well mannered and we got a prompt service (within 10/15 minutes of placing our order).

LEFT WITH A BITTER TASTE!!¬†

Walked in to an overwhelming smell of raw fish.

Started with some sort of rice water concoction for a drink....pathetic!!¬†
Ordered a few dishes.... one of them being Honey Chilli Prawns...NOT fresh...

Another dish called ¬†Bansh Pora Mangsho...WASN'T EVEN SERVED EVEN AFTER ORDERING BUT CONVENIENTLY BILLED !!!

So much about the food... seems like some people of this city have no bloody etiquettes....DISGUSTINGLY BURPING TO A DECIBLE 12.

Later it seemed as though Some vagabonds just out of their beds after a bachelor sleepover walked in to have a meal....messy hair...dirty clothes...unshaved faces...slippers on their feet...feet dirty as hell....n legs folded up on the chair with one foot pointing straight at our table.... while we tried not to look it still left us with a complete distaste of the food and environment...

Someone should start an institute for table manners and etiquettes.¬†

MY WORST EXPERIENCE.¬†

Sorry to say....Im not visiting you folks ever again.

Visited Santa's Fantasea two days back with a friend of mine.. Though it was the peak lunch hour on a Sunday, we got a table pretty quickly. The decor is simple and is in sync with the two main types of cuisine they serve - tribal and seafood.

They served us a complementary welcome drink which had quite a unique taste and was refreshing as well. We immediately placed our order - Crispy Fried Prawn, Bansa Pora Mutton, and Steamed Rice to go with it. 

The prawns arrived after about 10-15 mins. Eight pieces in a plate seemed total value for money. The batter was crispy and overall it was nice, but I have had better at other places. Here the prawns seemed to have been mashed slightly and then fried, because the texture did not feel like whole prawns battered and fried. 

After this came the long wait of a complete hour before our main course was served. Since I and my friend were meeting each other after a long time, we had a lot to talk about and the wait was only slightly bothersome for us, but in no way is a wait of one hour to serve a main dish and a rice staple justified. 

The mutton had the smokey flavour of bamboo and wasnt oily at all. In fact, it felt quite homely. But it was undercooked and as a result was rubbery and chewy at parts. It went well with the rice, but somehow the Bansa Pora Mutton seemed to be a bit over-hyped to both of us.

The prices are quite decent and they dont charge any extra taxes. Whatever price you see on the menu are all tax-inclusive.

Don't know why people are gagaing over this but my experience was horrible at here.We ordered banspora mutton which I guess even tribal people are going to throw away if even they are hungry.The Malaysian rice was just ok.The decor was not up to the mark&toilet was just chi...& upon this they were not even accepting cards on puja when people mostly carry plastic money.So was disappointed with this place.

1)	Ambiance (0.5/1): Colorful walls resembling the sea and tribal art. They have 2 small but cozy sections of seating arrangements. Very interesting interiors -  they just need to work a bit on the passage to the washroom.

2)	Food (0.75/1): We were 6 of us. They didn‚Äôt have 4 dishes(ONION KHEER, PRAWN KHEER, JULU PEETHA and another starter I can‚Äôt remember right now) that we wanted! *heart broken*. What we finally ordered and ate ‚Äì were all amazing!

a)	TANKHA TURANI (rice drink from Odisha): This was on the house. Beautiful rice drink with lemon and curry leaves-mustard tadka! We opted for it twice!

b)	HONEY CHILLI PRAWN: Tangy and sweet, well cooked prawns served in a good portion. 

c)	TERIYAKI CHICKEN: Chunky chicken pieces in teriyaki sauces with the tribal zing to it. gorgeous!

d)	BANSE PORA MANKSHO (Bamboo burnt mutton): One of their best preparations ‚Äì the mutton was actually inside the bamboo which was all burnt up on the outside but stunning meat on the inside! Instant hit!

e)	BANSE PORA CHICKEN (Bamboo burnt chicken):Similar concept , but with chicken. Personal favorite! It just couldn‚Äôt get any more tribal !

f)	KORRI KHAASI: soft and big chicken pieces in a green coriander gravy.

g)	WILD RED RICE: It didn‚Äôt seem as red as I would like but their portion was huge and it tasted delicious ‚Äì especially with baanse pora meats ‚Äì almost like biryani with kebabs! Must try!

h)	STICKY RICE: As simple as it may sound, they infuse star anise, tinny veggies and other spices in the sticky rice to make it amazing! Even those of us who didn‚Äôt like the stickiness ‚Äì loved the flavors!

i) SHORU CHAKLI: Thin rice rotis to go with the gravy

3)	Service (0.5/1) : good and friendly, but they didn‚Äôt have 4 dishes that we REALLLY wanted to try

4)	Innovation/Technique (0.75/1) : the variety they offer in their sea food and tribal dishes ‚Äì is definitely praise worthy! This is what sets them apart and they are loved for the same!

5)	VFM (1/1): 9 dishes, 6 happy people and the total bill is Rs.1870/- (about Rs.325/- per head!) Definitely going back here on my next visit to Kolkata. Cheers!

We went here tomorrow.. I am just giving you an over all experience..

Location -- on the heart of golpark.. Just a few sec away from Anjali jeweller s

Ambience -- 
not good.. Average.. Not a place for special days like birthdays,anniversary etc.. But for a casual day out it is quite good.

Food -- we went for tribal foods. But this restaurant is awarded as the best sea food restaurant in Kolkata.. Now coming to what we ate..
1. Tankha Turani(tribal drinks of odisa) -- this is complimentary and refreshing too.. Little bit sour.
2. Bansa pora mutton(odisa) -- marinated mutton in bamboo stick cooked in tandoor.
You will get a smoky smell with the tender mutton pieces. This is the signature dish.
3. Ngatok(Nagaland) -- fish cooked without oil in banana leaf. Don't think as paturi. It is different.. And a must have dish.. In my opinion, this is the best dish.
4. Jadoh(Meghalaya) -- tribal red rice with mutton pieces.. One is enough to serve two hungry people.
5. Korri gasi(Mangalore) -- bone less chicken with garlic pepper and coriander. Green in looks. Not too spicy but good in taste. 
6. Jhupu pisi mutton(Mizoram) -- mutton we used to eat but little bit different in taste. And a nice combo with jadoh.

Over all the spices they are using is bit different. The food is not too oily and spicy and you can't eat comfortably. Very nice in taste.

A good value for money restaurant.. The price is within your range. We were three and the bill was only about 1600.

After a long time, it was a "hangout time" with ms. T. I had been here, a few weeks ago. I had tested "Malaysian seafood rice" & "smoked octopus". Now this time I started with "bashpora chicken"(tribal cuisine) and then we ordered "burnt chilli octopus" &"seafood topping noodles" and then again we ordered "chilli wine octopus" & "Malaysian seafood rice noodles". Now to come to taste and services, taste is nice. One can feel the mix of Kolkata culture to sea food or tribal cuisine. It's more like molding seafood into Indian cooking style. And of course tribals foods are always nice by the origin of its own. They made us wait for an hour just after we ordered for 2nd time. But we understand the delay. It was Sunday afternoon and people are hungry. At 3:30p.m. it was a bit congested. However,it was value money for time we spent together. :)

At last I visited this restaurant after months' waiting. And it is worth a visit. We ordered Malaysian Seafood Noodles, Malaysian Seafood Rice , Bansapora Chicken, Prawn Chili , Shanghai Squid. My personal favourites are Malaysian Rice, prawn and Bansapora Chicken. The quantity was more than enough and the best part is that it is within fair range of prices. I am definitely going for an another visit.

Awesome restaurant.....The food was excellent and at a very very reasonable price.I ordered bansa pora mutton,boiled rice, malaysian mafoon and burnt chilly octopus and trust me everything was perfect. Even they serve a salty welcome drink with masala in it.In regards to the staff....Again a 4  star...disciplined friendly though I thought they should be a bit more proffessional.The only reason I gave a 4.5 instead of 5 is becoz though everything is tribal themed even the glasses they could do a bit of innovation instead of using plain white plates they could have used something theme specific

Happen to visit this restaurant during my puja vacation and was truly amazed by the dishes they served. The restaurant has a unique tribal theme and the food is amazing.
The bansa pora mutton was excellent cooked to perfection and the wild red rice was quite good, since the visit was during the puja they had ran out of the tribal drink tankha turani and the sweet dishes.¬†
Overall the food was amazing will surely visit again when I am back to Kolkata will have to try the octopus and the chemmeen kheer.

Went there during my Pujo vacation to Kolkata, and boy, it's a gem!! Nicely tucked in a narrow ally at Golpark, this is a must-go for the gastronomically inclined. Bringing in tribal cuisines from Orissa to Nagaland with unique recipes and cooking techniques, the entire experience is awe-inspiring! We were in a big group and therefore could try out most of their delicacies. The Bansh Pora Mutton is super awesome, the quaintly-named Jhupu Pishi's Mutton too is quite unique (somewhat like a Nihari gravy), then the Octopus Masala was great, the Fish Naga Tok yummy and the Jado rice extremely tasty. Finally the Onion Kheer was fabulous. And their service is top notch. Kudos, guys... Keep it up, will surely visit again when I am back to Kolkata!

The food was great and great value for money too. I asked for something light in chicken for my mom and the owner Kaushik Ghosh suggested chicken butter garlic which I think is not even on the menu . The chicken was cooked to perfection, not stringy but soft & succulent. It was liked by all as was the smoked crab , basnspora mutton, Malaysian fried rice and noodles with gravy. If you are iffy about squid you can ask them to leave it out as we did. The ¬†fact that everything was so tasty and different is rare to find in any restaurant . And the menu is so interesting and unique.

At last. A perfect blend of tribal food and seafood. This place is a must visit for those who want to try newer cuisines and want a break from the stereotypical Chinese, Mughlai, North Indian dishes. We had the wild red rice, banshpora chicken, shanghai squid and beijing seafood rice noodles. Each of the dishes is unique. The banshpora chicken/mutton and shanghai squid are must-try dishes. Will be visiting again soon!

This place is a very unique place in kolkata which has an assortment of various tribal/local delicacies from different Indian states along with some super seafood. Located at Golpark , this place is kind of a hidden gem waiting to be unravelled. The restaurant itself has all types of tribal carvings as Interior decor and the menu is a very comprehensive one having a lot of options. We had gone there and were welcpmd d with a traditional odisha drink, which was rustic in nature but very nice. Further we ordered some crab chilli, octopus sautey and a squid delicacy. All of them were very good except perhaps the crab which I personally didn't like that much. There is a famous dish " the banshpora mutton" which they serve you on a half bamboo strip, and will be trying that next time.If ur a food adventurer, this place is a no brainer. Further the cost is very very reasonable and value for money

Went there on a sunday with high hopes. In my opinion,this place has been overhyped to an extent that the bansa pora mutton has achieved mythical status and for someone travelling all the way to golpark to have it,the reality of the dish falls way,way short of the expectation.
Firstly,the service is horrible. We were asked to wait outside as the place was full. Two tables emptied in front of us,but for 10-15 minutes no one bothered to clean them,let alone calling us. We had to go and poke the management.
When seated,again,we had to call them repeatedly to take our order. We had bansa pora mutton,red rice,arsa chhum,shanghai squid and soru chakli. The mutton failed to deliver in terms of flavour,which was supposedly the usp of the dish. Shangai squid was good but not exceptional. Arsa chhum and red rice was good,infact,the rice was the best of the lot.
Had to wait for an eternity to get the bill,which was wrong with two dishes missing. Had to send it back.I've never encountered such unapologetic tardiness in an establishment. I'd definitely not recommend this place. The food does not manage to compensate for the mismanagement.

The food here is quirky. We started with the Shanghai squid which was amazing. The Jadoh, a tribal rice preparation with mutton was not that appetizing, but the Bansh pora mutton was again a very unique and tasty dish. The desserts on the menu looked a bit intimidating, which stopped us from ordering any. Overall the food taste is good, with good portions. The washrooms and wash basin areas however need a lot of improvement; really plays with one's appetite.

Santa's fantasea is the one of those rare places in Kolkata which serves exotic seafod and tribal cuisine under the same roof. The lane adjacent to anjali jewllers, golpark takes you to this outlet of Santa's fantasea.

Santa's Fantasea is a unique restaurant near Golpark which serves seafood and tribal food under one roof! I was planning to visit this place for quite some time mainly because of its high rating in zomato and feedbacks from my friends. Also i never tried seafood dishes like octopus or squid, so experimenting with new dishes was also a big reason to visit santa's fantasea.
AMBIANCE: the restaurant is decorated modestly. the chairs and tables made of bamboo or wood does give a tribal effect. But its not awesome or something. As ambiance is not very important for me so it wasn't that important for me. i will give 4/5 for ambiance.
SERVICE: service was good but a bit slow. they took a long time to take order. also some of the items (like momo with crab meat filling) weren't available when we vistited. a 4/5 for service from me.
FOOD: now we are talking! the food here is awesome. In tribal section we ordered bansh pora mutton and wild red rice. both were fabulous. specially bansh pora mutton, it is a must-have when you are visiting this restaurant. From seafood section we ordered smoked octopus, seafood rice noodles of two different types and butter garlic fish. i must admit both octopus and squid tastes real good, though i am slighly inclined towards squid. smoked octopus is quite good, as are rice noodles and butter garlic fish. I will rate 5/5 for food as this is definitely the best lunch i have in months.
VALUE FOR MONEY: this is another aspect of this restaurant which i must mention. this restaurant, while providing awesome food in such prime location near Golpark, is unbelievably affordable. most of the dishes are below the price range of 200-250. the amount of food in one plate is quite good too. ¬†and most importantly, THE PRICES IN THE MENU CARD ARE INCLUSIVE OF ALL THE TAXES. this was just great as 4 of us, after having such an awesome meal, had to pay only 1200 bucks! i will rate 5/5 for providing such value for money.¬†overall this is a must visit restaurant if you love seafood or tribal food or willing to experiment. just go for it and i can promise you wont regret!

This restaurant was on my wishlist for a long time. Finally went there with my family members.
From the outside the restro didn't look that special. But as soon as we got into we all liked their interior themes and decorations.
As there were already too many reviews about their ambience hence i wouldn't waste time describing the same.

As i had already read many reviews that this restro was always full of customers hence it is very difficult to get seated soon.
But to my surprise when we got into there it was empty. We were the only family there. But after some time more and more people kept coming.

We were welcomed with their complementary free drink Tankha Turani. We had ordered Bansh pora mutton, Soru chakli roti, Wild red rice, Kori gassi (tribal chicken item), Seafood Malaysian rice, Smoked Squid and also taken away oyster chilly basil squid and honey chilly crab.

Now coming in details about the food
Tankha turani- it had a new kind of taste. It was good but not that very special.
Bansh pora- this was the best dish we had here. The mutton pieces were very soft and had a nice brunt flavour.
Soru chakli- this rotis were also very soft and very tasty.
Kori gassi- the marinated chicken pieces were very soft. But the taste was average.
Wild red rice- this item was also very very good.
Seafood malaysian rice- this item was not that good and had a raw smell.
Smoked squid- this item was also very good. Really liked it..

Don't know about the parcelled items as i hadn't tasted them. But they charge 10 rupees each for each container.

Servicing was good ,friendly and helpful. Moreover whats best about them is that they don't charge any extra tax on their bill.

Love to visit here again ...

Food is definitely a big 5, but couple of other issues will determine the final rating. Parking is a issue for sure. SERVICE is poor in terms of speed. Waiters do not upsell any item, seems like they are in a hurry to sell the fast moving items only. But the food is definitely good with a wide menu. Hygiene of crockery and cutlery is poor. And a loud ambience, not for a quiet dinner or lunch.

Tucked away in a small bylane next to anjali jewellers in golpark, this place can easily be termed as a hidden gem which doesn't burn a deep hole in your pocket.
Wanted to visit this place since a long while and finally managed to experience the food that has got a lot of people raving, no wonder why.
Tried out the often reviewed preparations like baash pora mutton(soft succulent pieces of mutton having a subtle smoky flavour, a downright hit with my mom and grandma), ngatok (the banana leaf wrapped fish cooked to perfection having a mild flavour), soru chaakli(soft rice flour rotis), smoked octopus and honey chilli squid. However the kheers weren't available but we thoroughly enjoyed it all and hope to visit soon again.

Went there during Durga Puja this year with friends. I had received some amazing reviews from some of my foodie friends earlier and had been waiting to visit this place for a long time.
But we were not at all satisfied. May be it was due to the Puja factor.
They were too late to serve our foods, took more than 40 minutes probably. Also their sense of quantity is poor. We were told a plate of noodles would be sufficient for 2 people. Accordingly we ordered for 4 plates for the 7 of us. They gave 2 large bowls saying that each bowl had 2 plates of noodles. I don't know how they could think each such bowl would suffice 4 people. At best it could be for 2 people. The side dishes were alright.¬†

As a result, we again ordered for 4 more plates of noodles and some more side dishes. Another round of waiting followed for 30 minutes.¬†

We became very tired and once thought of cancelling our second order and walk out. Anyway we stayed back.¬†

Some of my friends had told me to take either their sea food cuisine or the tribal cuisine on a particular day, not both, to get the best taste. We ordered only Sea Food items that day and nothing from the Tribal cuisine. The squids, octopus and prawn were good. But we had become too tired to appreciate their taste. Overall we came out disappointed.

And thank god we had arrived early that day, else we would have to wait outside, like we found many others outside waiting.

I think they cannot handle the pressure during festivities. Will visit come time later on a normal day, since I had received good reliable reviews earlier about this place. May be I will alter my rating then.

AND Kolkata got a new favorite!This is a place worth going to and standing in a queue for 1 hour, simply because of the food they serve. Be it the Tribal food or the Sea food ! I guess i don't need to review the Banspora chicken. Its smoky, its tender and its absolutely amazing! People who have tasted it know how good it tastes The Malaysian rice is great! Shanghai squid is just perfect! i didn't like the texture of octopus but then the gravy was amazing!
Amazing ambiance....a little difficult to fit in if you are planning to go in a large group! And be prepared for a queue....'cause it's perpetual!

Over-hyped and understaffed - the exact reactions that we had after visiting this place for Sunday dinner. The decor is pretty much okay, tribal themed, as expected. But what we did not expect was a leaking aircon and a non-functional card swiping machine. So far as food is concerned, most of the items were pretty average.

Here's what we ordered:

Banspora chicken - did not like it much, too dry and tasteless. Will try the mutton version if I revisit them.
Shanghai Octopus - chewy and inedible
Fish nagatok - tasting like fish kabab, this one is definitely the show stealer. We ordered this twice so that each one of us can have a second round of servings.
Soruchakli, noodles and rice - just okay, nothing exceptional
Desserts - none of the desserts were available [sigh]

Quantity is a bit on the lower side, there is a room for improvement. Price is however quite moderate.

Okay. Food is here tastes amazingly well. Especially the octopus and the mutton. It's really very fresh. The red rice is tasty and very different from what we generally have. As for the crab , trust me it'll keep you asking for more. The octopus reminded me of the traditional Thai Tom yum soup. It was spicy. The only problem however and the only reason why the restaurant has got a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that it is very dirty. Really really unhygienic. Service is very poor. Honestly , I wasn't even willing to have dinner here after seeing how dirty the interiors were but then the food was so good that well it outdid everything else.

Located in golpark near anjali jewellers, this place doesnt attract much attention if you are an unaware passerby. Open the gate and lo ... You are greeted inside by tribal decor and well .. cramped space. Though we had heard about long queues, fortunately we didnt encounter any. About the food , its cheap and its really good. You get a decent amount and service is fairly swift. We had banspora chicken, patrapora mutton, chicken korigrassi , rice ,noodles ,smoked squid, shanghai squid, and chili basil octopus. Banspora chicken and patrapora mutton and shanghai squid were really awesome. Seafood beijing rice was also good. Oh, and you also get a complimentary chhaach like thing while you order.  A really great place with good seafood . A must place to visit.

Had their Bans pora mutton,Shoru chakli r thanka turani. The drink was not that cold and also not that refreshing. The shoru chakli was served cold and mushy,nothing great. But the biggest let down for me was the Bansa pora mutton. I read a lot about that dish but for me it was a horrible dish. The mutton was completely dry,overcooked and it had a strange burnt/smokey smell. The smell was annoying and it didn't seem to be tandoored. For me this place is very overrated and overhyped. Don't know about their seafood section though.

They informed that they do not have crab momo so started with smoked octopus and ngatok. Both were nice specially the ngatok. Then had soru chakli with bansh pora mutton. Mutton was tasty. Then we had seafood malaysian rice and oyester chilli basil squid. Rice had prawn, fish and squid. Both tasted good. A real good work by the team.

Among those items bansa pora mutton and shanghai squid was exceptionally good. On the other side the test of the smoked octopus was moderate. But my overall impression to the restaurant is very satisfactory. I would like to visit it again to test the other preparations.

Someday ago I went to this restaurant, with my wife. From many years I have dream to eat Octopus and Squid. Recently I got the name from Zomato that they serve it with excellent review. It is most voted restaurant in 2015. Only two room with two different ambiance, one is tribal, another is sea food section. 

I ordered 

1. Bansa pora mutton

2. Wild red rice

3. crack leaves squid

4. smoked octopus

5. seafood beijing rice

6. their complementary orissa drink always there

Initially I ordered mutton because my wife uncertain that she can eat octopus or squid or not. Later she told me next time we will never order that mutton because its test is average than other. Smoked octopus was excellent, in my whole life I never eat anything so beautiful like this. My wife's eyes was closed in amazement when she was eating octopus. 

The price was really reasonable, only 1060 for all this item, most priced was mutton with 350, anyone can easily skip it. Only regret that I could not taste all the item. please go and test the item as early as possible.

Although based on sea food (mackerel and tuna is not available in most of the days) but for me the best is Bansh Pora Mutton! It just has a completely different taste served in charred bamboo itself! Will visit again soon! Hope Tuna and Mackerel will be available this time around!

Bansh pora mangsho was tenderly cooked.
Roasted fish was soft and spicy. Not very spicy. It's a must try.
Butter garlic squid was the best you should eat this if you're in santa's fantasea
Wild rice was good.
Sticky rice was horrible. Do not try it unless you like to eat marr Bhat.

Docking off half a point for a not so clean washroom and somewhat slow service, but otherwise easily one of the better options in town in my opinion. We restricted ourselves to just the "tribal section" of the menu and all items were very good (would like to go back for the "seafood section" later). Very reasonably priced as well. Wish they had a more extensive dessert section and had thumbs up. But a very good meal nonetheless!

We visited this restaurant for a group gathering. The indecor was interesting but the space is very small. The staff were decent but the service is a bit slow. From the foodies' point of view this is a good hang out. Tribal food was excellent. Bansh pora mutton/chicken is a delightful affair. The best part of the whole food list is the jadoh rice, well cooked with a nice aroma. The sea food fried rices were somewhat tasteless. The side dishes were great in taste, especially the teriyaki chicken. Octopus and squid are other attractions of the menu. Unfortunately crab meat was not available which was a disappointment. The price is ok though the serving size could be better.@ avik de

It kinda disappointed me...i would kind of question its freshness...may be it is the dishe's smell but didnt like it!

What an awsome place!!! There are very few places which does justice both to your taste buds and your wallet. And this is surely one among them, maybe even the best among them. It has also got an awesome atmosphere. The banshpora mutton was an absolute delight. The smoked octopus and garlic butter squid were no less. This is indeed a must visit place for the college go-ers. I've rated it 4.5 only because there is no limit for perfection and crab was unavailable. Otherwise a full rating isn't an impossible thing

The ambience of this place is just awesome and we tasted octopus and buspora mutton and herbs chicken and jadodang fried rice. The taste of chicken and octopus i liked And the fried rice tasted good. We were given a complementary drink made from rice. Its was also a new item for us. All over the experience was good.

Firstly this restaurant was on my list for long as it had great reviews as well as menu was something different. Restaurant is located on ground floor of house in the lane next to Anjali jewellers. After shopping on a late saturday afternoon before puja, we dropped as the last customer for lunch service at 3:45pm.  Decor took us by a visual treat with tribal theme wallpaper paintings, few statues, while outer-room was seafood themed. The table was made of bamboo so are salt pepper and glasses. We put in our order at one go as it was the last order for lunvh, first were served welcome drink made from rice extract with a little seasoning, digestive in nature. Ordered Banshpora Mutton as starter, nicely served with bamboo intact to ensure that taste of bamboo in mutton flavour, mutton was soft and tasted just great. Mains we ordered Jadoh, Kori Gassi, Beijing Rice with Burnt Chilly prawns. Food came in early and each item tasted just fabulous. Jadoh was flavoured rice cooked with tiny mutton pieces, kori gassi was a green chicken preparation with coriander flavour. Burnt chilly prawn was very tasty and went great with beijing rice. Quantity is good for 2 people and value for food as well. Will visit again surely to try the rest of menu.

Went there right after durga puja . the theme and interior were great. they offered us a special menu with lesser items. we ordered the famous "bashpora mutton" which didn't spoil the excitement at all. I loved the Smokey affair with the well cooked tender mutton. Apart from that we tried dry chilli octopus and seafood noodles which were great too. Looking forward to go there again .

We went there hearing about their Exotic cuisine. Ordered The Shanghai Octopus and Malaysian Sea Food rice. The taste of the Octopus was good ( although this is my first time tasting Octopus) , The rice was average. But the restaurant seemed under staffed today and the desserts were not available. But the price of food was really cheap compared to the cuisine. Would like to visit this place again to try the other seafoods.

Went to Santa's Fantasea for the first time. The welcome drink made from rice with curry leaves made us anticipate the innovative & unusual flavours, and also a quite friendly service. We ordered for spring fried pomphret and  bansh pora mutton! The pomphret made our mouth watery while the woody & burnt smell of mutton satisfied our cravings to the most. Also the suggestion of having the mutton with the paratha of soru chakli was perfect! The blunt and damp taste of the paratha went well with the intense burnt flavour of mutton! Sitting in bamboo chairs amidst tribal decorations added to the experience. Thank you Santa's Fantasea looking forward to more variedexperiences.

Visited this place few months before puja, this was my first tym to an all seafood restaurant and was really excited by seeing the variety and the taste of the food. The squid in perticular was exquisite. Also tried their smoked octopus and their mixed seafood fried rice which was a blast than some ordinary mixed fried rice. The price is not at all that much as other seafood restaurants charged.
Seafood is a tricky area and so don't wanna try other restaurant of this genre as this one is enough to serve my seafood cravings. :)

Visited the place with my cousin on a Friday evening. I had no idea about this place before but it seemed that the food will be nice. Well, after visiting the place, this is my experience and opinion. Absolute mismanagement on part of the staff, had to find a place on our own, got 2 glasses of water after 25 mins and after requesting at least 5-6 times. No one came to take order for 30 mins. Then managed to get hold of one guy who said that half the things on the menu are not available. After clearly asking him what all are available we finally placed the order. Another 30 to 40 mins passed (more than 1 hour 15 mins from the time we came in) we had to ask the waiter the status of our order 5 times after which he paid any attention and told me that he is looking into it. He came back 5 mins later and said that it is going to take a while (without even trying to sound a little cordial), it turns out they have not even started on our order, almost 1 hour 30 mins have passed. I told them to cancel the order and left the place. Absolute horrible and pathetic experience, I do not care how good a food they serve, I am sure its not worth to put up to this kind of non sense, there are other good sea food joints in Kolkata. I will never be visiting this worthless place again.

one of the few places in Kolkata which serves exotic, tribal and rare sea foods at affordable prices.Your gastronomic journey starts with a complementary tribal rice drink Tankha Turani...has got a slight pungent hit with a sweet after taste.Their Mefoon is tastier than most chinese outlets. Be sure to test their specialties Bansha-pora and Patra-pora... diced and spicedmutton bamboo steamed and banana-leaf steamed respectively. Sanghai Squid tastes like heaven...Octopus with Fillings, well...the filling is good, but I feel undercooking makes it the octopus rubbery...however excellent customer service, awesome ambience.

There is nothing less than 1.0 reading here. I would have given it less than 0.5. Having a tribal decor with straws doesn't bring the smells attached to earth. Tribal food is primitive and relates to nature. I was utterly disappointed here. We ordered bansh pora mutton with smoked prawns and fish. Bansh pora was nice but the rest of the stuffs will be a puzzle for the viewers who are reading my review. I'm posting picture of smoked fish and prawn here. Figure out where is the smoked stuff. Tribal food has an essence of nature and the management has concentrated on tribal decors than food.

A restaurant located in ballygunge which deals with tribal and seafood. I dropped by to try the seafood although there is quite a buzz about the tribal food yet I did not try it cause it did not interest me. The host was really welcoming and approachable sometimes a bit too much but I don't blame his enthusiasm.  We got started with a refreshment tribal drink from the house served in tribal inspired cups,  ordered couple of sea food dishes which were all upto the mark and most important of all the fishes were all fresh. The prices to my surprise were quite low considering it is located in ballygunge.  Overall a great experience and had a great time.

Food Items that were tasted: 
1) Banshpora Mangsho :  Mutton Cooked and Served with Bamboo straw. Delicious taste, mind blowing.
2) Patro pora : Mutton cooked in Charcoal , served with Banana leaf. One hell of a lovely dish. 
3) Chilli Burnt Octopus: Octopus perfectly cooked with Burnt onion, ginger and chilly. 
4) Smoked Chilli Prawn: Awesome dish!

And do Order Black Pepper Sauce Crab, loved it to the core...¬†

All in all Santa's Fantasea is the one you would be looking for if you are really craving for some delicious tribal and sea food dishes.

I visited this place today with few friends of mine, absolutely loved it. 
Its an unique venture with very distinct spread of menu. 
I loved the tribal section. I am not much into squids and octopus stuff, hence i let that section pass. 

We ordered 3-4 items from the tribal section and absolutely loved each of them. 
The wait staff are cordial but they could get few more people as the tables are always full and few staff find it difficult to attend everyone on time. 

Amazingly reasonable pricing. A meal for 3 costed us 600 rupees !! And i have already decided my next visit ! Finally kolkata is getting its share of taste bud pleasure !! Kudos to the concept! 
Shall i go there again? Yes !! Next week itself üòÅ

Santa's Fantasea is a way out of the world experience... One of its first in Kolkata. They have distinct sections, tribal and sea food.. Once you enter the restaurant..you clearly understand the difference in decor of the two sections.. We seated ourselves at the Seafood section. We wanted to try out the house mackerel and king fish, but unfortunately none of that was available.. We finally ordered Banshpora mutton a tribal Odiya delicacy which is basically a dish where mutton hunks are marinated in rich exotic spices and cooked inside a bamboo shoot.. Sanghai squid, Honey Chilly Prawn and Smoked Octopus. Must say the flavour of the Smoked Octopus was amazing, and one of the best I have tried ever. Looking forward to visiting Santa's the next time I drop back in Kolkata.. Although it's a mystery to me why they named it 'Santa's'.. Can anybody help me with that ?;)

My friend & I went there during 2015 durga puja. The place was small so it was crowded. We waited for 1 hour to enter the place , waited for 30 minutes for the food to come & finished the food in just 10 minutes. I didn't have much seafood before that & was newly in love with the food genre. I've been recommending this place to my friends & known people since then. Baanshpora chicken is a must try , which is a tribal dish. We also had squid which was good too. I'm gonna try their crab dish on my next visit . :)

After a friend suggested me this place, I visited sometime in August and completely fell in love with the food. The signature dishes like Bansa Pora mutton(tender smoky mutton pcs cooked inside a bamboo), Jupu Pishi (mutton ribs cooked with bamboo shoots), wild red rice, smoked fish/squids etc tastes better and better everytime you have it, even during the heavy pressure and crowd during the durga puja. Its must visit place.

The best find for Tribal and Seafood delicacies. I always thought that this place is a little overhyped, but that's before I paid a visit here. The food is sooo good, that you can't help but give it a 10 on 10. Went there on Shashti for a wholesome lunch with a friend and was extremely satisfied with the luncheon. They had a special menu for the Durga Puja period, slightly expensive than the usual menu, but totally worth it.

 My orders were:

1. Baansh Pora Mutton- their trademark, and it was mouthwatering.
2. Soru Chakli- the tribal bread, more like a soft pancake, went just fine with the mutton.
3. Smoked Octopus- the best I ate so far. Period.
4. Butter Garlic Squid- as the name suggests, it was buttery and garlicky, made in thick non-spicy white gravy... Awesome is the word for it.
5. Red Wild Rice- Tribal rice, slightly spicy, went perfect with my Octopus and Squid both.
6. Smoked Chicken- Mouthwatering.
We hogged all these and were so full that skipped desserts. Service was prompt and staff very attentive. I can't wait to go back there.
P.S: We hogged all these for just Rs. 1190/- inclusive of taxes.

Long live Santa's Fantasea. Kudos to the owner for experimenting with such unique tribal dishes and pulling it off this well.

what could I say just loved every bit of food they served from bansh pora to smoked crab , the fish , the rice everything.  I loved bansh pora the most. once it got into the mouth there were burst of smoky flavours of the dish just awesome. The price is okay but the quantity could be better , I don't know may be we visited during puja time so  the quantity given were less and the service were little slow but I am happy . The food compensated every thing. Just want to visit it more often whenever I get the chance.

As this was the closest from Gariahat and we could not get a proper parking for our car at China Whites we decided to check into this place expecting there would be a safe parking for our car in the lane the restaurant is located. Though we got a parking, the restaurant was very crowded. We had to wait for nearly 2 effing hours to get a table for 5 people!! The worse was they did not provide us with any chairs while we waited outside.

Now as we entered they almost closed their kitchen and thus we had to order all the food at once. Though the food was good and sumptuous, and was served hot, the portion size of rice was less. We had to order 5 plates of rice for each of us. The dining area is small. The ambience was average. And to my surprise they did not add any taxes to our bill so that could be a perk of this place! :D

The name popped while I was surfing zomato to satisfy my taste buds' demand for something new and after going through the menu I was completely hooked. All the squid recipes are something to die for here. loved them. extremely well cooked with flavours popping out everywhere. along with it, is the famous baansh pora mutton. the smell, the spicy touch, the presentation.... all attempted to perfection. The rice dishes were also a stand out. on the other hand many might not get the hang of octopus dishes. I found them a little bit hard and chewy for my taste. another thing, since the resturant is famous for seafood and tribal foods, it's better not to order Chinese mains like noodles. ours noodle had an uncooked portion when served. The staff is very friendly and courteous. overall it cost us around 1000 bucks for 3-4 people. already my third time here, and planning to come back soon.

Wonderful experience dining there! We went there for casual dining and were pleasantly surprised by the warm and cozy atmosphere there.

The food was very good and the service was very prompt and friendly. We had a bit of all, starting with the Banshpora Mutton, which was superb. The mutton pieces were very tender and delectable.

After that, we moved to the seafood, and tried Shanghai Squid and Smoked Octopus. The squid was very good, cooked in a hot and sweet sauce. The octopus we didn't like that much - there was a slight smell in the octopus, which put us off.

But altogether, it was a very good dining experience. The prices were also very reasonable. I'm looking forward to having another dinner there.

When you the restro it feels like entering into a tribal zone. Water served in earthen pots, salt n pepper kept in wooden containers simply awsome. Seafood lovers will find themselves in heaven. Squid , octopus, prawn and crab everything is there. The banshpora chicken and butter garlic fried squid would make you simply crazy. An economical place, a meal for three would fetch max 1000.

This particular outlet was in my wishlist since the day i heard about it and i was pretty satisfied and happy after my first visit. The food is so good that made up for the 1 hour long wait to get a table. They tried to make the interior look like a small village but unfortunately due to the cramp in space it is not at all successful. We ordered for Jodah Rice, Butter Garlic Prawn, Smoked Prawn and Baanshpoora Mutton. The Jodha rice is basically Mutton Fried Rice having small mutton chuncks which was quite satisfactory. The Smoked Prawn had a subtle taste and had about 12 pieces of small sized prawn. The Baanshpoora Mutton which is their signature item was very innovative i must say. It had a smoked flavour and was tasty. But this particular item is not recommended for those people who likes their extremely soft. The Mutton pieces which were there was hard but only the preparation demands it so i wont blame the chef. The highlight of the night was Butter Garlic Prawn which was my favourite. The gravy was so tasty that we almost made the serving plate dry by licking even the last drop. Some of my friends even ordered for a portion of Butter Garlic Squid which was also very impressive according to them. Kindly note that their portions are quite small and hence you should order accordingly. Full marks to their people who were serving as they had a smile on their face and patience inspite of the mad rush. Overall very satisfying and i am definitely coming back here to try some of their other delicacies like Crabs which was unavailable.

Went to this place yesterday.. Although the menu looks quite impressive I am not too happy with the freshness of the seafood. We ordered for octopus, crab, prawns, mutton, and chicken. To begin with the octopus was not too fresh. There was a filthy smell in the crab meat. We asked the floor manager to smell it and they confirmed the same and they changed it. Then the prwans werent too fresh either. Due to the pujas, only four types of sauces were available.. The bansh pora mutton was really good.. The other mutton was undercooked.. However by then our interest in the food was over.. Great interiors.. However to reap harvests in the long run, quality needs to be upheld as exotic food turn lethal when stale..

Squid was very tasty. It's an awesome starter.
Bash pora mutton was also good but bash pora chicken is bad.
Lobster was very sweet and a waste of money. 
Overall..
Price: cheap
Taste: a bit sweet and light
Ambience: Awesome tribal ambience welcomed by traditional drinks.

Had saptami lunch here. A very tiny place with cramped seating arrangements. The restro does not even have a proper washroom. The staffs are a little mismanaged. It took abt 45 mins for them to serve us. But all this was quite compensated by their food. We had bansa pora mutton , schezwan chicken ,smoked fish,garlic butter fish,wild red rice and seafood Malaysian rice. On the whole the food tasted great. The wild rice with its blend of spices us a must have.Bansa pora mutton is a bit expensive considering its quantity but its burnt and smoked flavour is just mesmerizing. The lunch for four costed us only rs 1410. They don't charge any tax over the menu price.
The only thing is that the management should be a bit more organized.

Pretty decent food. Both tribal and continental. A few negative things I want to point out though. Firstly the basin is located where they dump grease and stuffs, a very stinky experience if u have to use the basin. Secondly, the festive menu specially in the Continental section is a bit repetitive. Only four items are repeated with different ingredients only. U really don't get much to chose from. Lastly, do not order jadoh rice. Wild red rice is way cheaper and only thing missing is a few grams of mutton and it saves 120 bucks extra from your pocket A mixed experience overall I must say.

We had a gala dinner on the eve of maha saptomi. Me and my wife went to taste some tribal foods and ended up tasting a lot more than just the tribal foods. Initially we ordered special roti and bamboo chicken. Both of them were mighty delicious. After that ordered smoked prawn and malayasian rice. Oh my god. Those preparations were so very good. I would definitely visit there to choose from a wide range of variety of food items. I would highly recommend this one.

Well...A very new Fare. Loved it.

Went out for the Saptami Lunch. Bansapora Mangsho.....yummy. Never miss this. It was out of the world....Mutton marinated and stuffed inside a bamboo and then burnt on fire....the smokey flavor of the soft and succulent mutton will take your breadth away.

This along with Jadoh....red rice with mutton pieces ...a combination worth remembering.

The Tribal Fare is a new experience and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

Warning....these are little spicy and therefore small kids might have trouble. You should go with the standard know food like Sea Food Malaysian Rice.

Crab was not available. But I will not reduce points for that since it is Durga Pujo time and the rush is maddening :-).

Space is a little cramped and entry is difficult. I had trouble taking my aged father up. This needs a bit of improvement please.

Overall...a very nice experience.

I visited here with 6 of my friends on 17th Oct,2015. In short --
Ambiance - superb
Food - awesome
service - poor
Price - reasonable
You have to taste zadoh rice and baspora mutton if you are coming to this place. But in the middle of main course we ordered some extra item. They has got a big amount of doorstep delivery order. Instead of giving us the priority they started preparing dishes for doorstep delivery order. We had to wait for 45minutes in between for that. We were so much frustrated about that behavior, that we were about to cancel the order. As the last order was done in a hurry, food quality became lower as expected.

It's a amazing place to cherish the taste buds, if you are bored with Chinese or mughlai, try their tribal food and feel the flavor.their Mutton preparation (Baans pora) is an authentic product of tribal culture and their sea food, "no comments", try it

We, a group of 9 had gone there for lunch on choturthi. I must say their service is extremely poor. The taste and quality of the food is good, but the quantity given is below average and the service is HORRIBLE.

We had lunch over here.. and I found this restaurant typically over-hyped. Luckily we got two seats at about 12:45 PM, after us whoever reached, they had to wait outside for long hours in a queue until the seats inside got vacated further. After getting into, they told - no soup would be available, no momo would be available, no dessert would be available, on asking for cheesy tuna salad and lal-gosht they refused their availability too, on asking for baked fish they told it'd take long time so better to order something else.. non-availability of so many dishes!! It really put me off in the first place! How will the meal get completed without at least a bowl of soup, one starter and a dessert? A real piss-off for anyone! We finally had - jadoh, smoked squid, sea food salad, mutton bansha-pora, mutton patra-pora, ngatok, shoru chaki. They took average time to serve. But the space in the table was so small that it was not enough to accommodate all the items we ordered. So we got hard time managing the table-space. Jadoh tasted like normal rice (coarse grain) cooked with spicy mutton gravy and pieces of minced mutton were there. The amount was substantial and it tasted good. Both mutton bansha-pora and mutton patra-pora had similar pieces of mutton (size of the pieces were same as minced mutton found in jadoh). About bansha-pora, I could not get the reason behind all the brouhaha people do about that signature dish! It tasted like normally charred mutton pieces without any flavour of spices or herbs. Only a mild smell of bamboo stem was there. I did not like it. Usually, you need to apply spices, salt, pepper, herbs on the mutton for quite a long span of time and wait until the flavour gets soaked into the mutton and makes it tender. I clearly found those mutton pieces were devoid of proper marination and the pieces were hard, not tender at all. Patra-pora was better since it had mustard/spices in it but then again, similar complaint of improper marination was applicable for this dish too. Pieces were not tender. Smoked squid was good in taste and the volume was also sufficient enough. The quality of squids used were fresh and succulent, and the bamboo-shoots used in gravy added a special flavour in it. Ngatok was superbly delicious. It tasted good because of proper marination of fish fillets in spices, and the flavour was mildly smoky, not at the level of making it charred killing the entire taste like bansha-pora. Shoru chaki was thin, soft, supple. Finally, the sea food salad was a complete bland. The contents were good (it had calamari rings, pieces of prawn, sliced cucumber/bell-peppers, grated cheese) but the salad clearly lacked proper tossing.. grains of sugar were visible on the top of the salad and it tasted horrible when I had to chew the granular sugar with the calamari rings! I guess, they put those in hurry and did not wait until the sugar grains get dissolved in the dish. Or, they compensate my desire to gulp one dessert item by putting sugar grains intentionally into the salad! (joking) Anyway, I really found this place over-hyped, but I appreciate their entrepreneurship skill for inventing innovative and weird ways of making the dishes, putting both octopus and bamboo-stick in one table, and for giving people an opportunity to finish their palate within a meagre amount of money without any pocket-pinch!

I would have rated this place 4.0 but couldn't due to their ultra long waiting time, that too in between a serving.

6 of us attended.

Food - 4/5 We ordered Bansh Pora Chicken, Bansh Pora Mutton (better than the chicken version), Jadoh(red rice with mutton and mushroom), Red Rice, Korigassi(greenish tribal chicken curry) and Rukva ko Masu (red mutton curry). The food tasted good and the bansh pora was indeed a speciality in this place. I loved the Korigassi most as it was a bit spicy but was mostly some green herbs mashed in the gravy.

Sitting and Ambience - 4/5 Sitting was pretty spacious and the wall paint tried hard to reflect a tribal feel. The chairs and benches were like made of logs which added to the feel.

Service - 2/5 We ordered our first course and it came within 15 minutes. When we asked for a 2nd serving they took nearly 40 more minutes to deliver it. We were like half full and sitting like ducks wondering when the 2nd servings would arrive. It was indeed an extremely bad experience. They don't charge any service tax which is weird. But, their bad service definitely justifies it.

Cost - 4/5 Considering tribal delicacies which is hard to come across, you are getting the same in the middle of Kolkata. 6 of us had good food for 1970 i.e. 330 per head with 2 rice varieties, 2 curry varieties and 2 Bansh Pora Varieties which was pretty good.

P.S. They do not provide a proper bill with TAN id, service tax and all. Just a hand written piece of paper which might be hard in case you want to get it reimbursed. Neither do they accept cards.

I had heard and read a lot about this place and all the reviews had a positive feedback. So it was on my must visit place list and last sunday i managed to strike it off. 

The place is small and has minimalistic decor with seating being comfortable and the staff being polite and helpful. 

I had their famous bas pora mutton and smoked fish with soru chakli.

The mutton was soft succulent and juicy with all the flavours hitting the right spot. The smoked fish was also very yummy and the soru chakli was well different from all breads we are used to having.

The total bill for 4 of us was 1000 which is pretty cheap considering the quality of the food. A big thumbs up to their entire team :)

An awesome place for food lovers. Loved every bit of it. Interiors are cool , tribal in nature with a countryside outlook.
Ambience was perfect for dine in. 

The owner helped us in our quest and his choices were no doubt amazing. 
Bansa Pora Mutton was topclass loved the way it was served. 
Then came Soru Chakli which was a roti mixture of rice , maida and egg to be precise.
Jadoh was great too it was a combination of red rice and mutton pieces.
Finally came Ngatok which was a mouthwatering item to say the least , it was fish cooked without oil served inside a banana leaf. 
Overall experience was pretty awesome.
Gonna back again soon.

When you call a restaurant popular? Well when you stand outside that joint for odd 45 minutes on a Wednesday. Yes that's the waiting period for this place normally. And that proves its awesomeness. It is indeed awesome. Chose a dish, name a dish and try it. You will be bowled over. The tribal smell, the authentic seafood preparations make this small cozy place a heaven for all foodies. Go there and eat. Unless and until you eat there you will not feel the fantasea! All best.

So finally, we found our way to this place! To begin with, it looks a lot bigger in the pictures. Having said that, it's still pretty big.
We ordered Arsa Chhum and jadoh.
The jadoh was pretty normal. Nothing to write home about. The chunks of meat in it, were too small for my liking though.
The Arsa Chumm was pretty good. Liked the lemon kick we got from lemon leaves. The chicken was nice and tender. But really, the thing that made me smile was that lemon leaf! Although it's a pretty common technique, but it's a good one, if u can disguise it like that!
Then we ordered the prawn kheer and the onion kheer.
I can still understand the logic behind prawn kheer, where you can add almost 'rubberized' prawns to add some texture and chewiness to the dish.. But the onion kheer was awful to be honest. We couldn't just kill that beast! Felt like we were eating kheer with stale onions. What a waste of perfectly good kheer! They added gud to try to salvage some taste, but I wouldn't order it again. Ever. Not my cuppa!
The service was pretty prompt. But I would not keep my cutlery cupboard right next to a customer's table. Every time a fork or a spoon fell down, it was pretty irritating.
Also, it didn't help, that the owner was sitting a few feet away from us, wearing shorts and a tee.. And showing us some hairy legs.. and talking to a customer seated next to his table. He was so loud and vocal about his restaurant's squid dishes, it was like as if he was forcing the customers mentally to order those squid dishes! My ratings?
Food: 3/5
Decor: 3/5
Service: 3/5

This place is never let you down your expectations..its very difficult to find out a very good seafood cuisine in Kolkata also the pocket friendly and if you are looking for something then it's the place. All the foods served with mastery in preparation and presentation. 
In Tribal section it's unique in its nature and believe me Banshpora Mutton with Soruchakli is a lifetime experience. For me it's not the end just the beginning. A Great Thanks to Team Santa's Fantasea to present such beautiful cuisine in middle of the town..Hats Off!!!!

Heard a lot about this place and finally visited last week with friends.
This is a small place but the ambiance is good, have to wait outside for sometime because the place is full. They will serve rice drink as a complement.

Peoples are very interactive and they will always ready to suggest you dishes. We first started with tribal cuisine. We ordered Jolu Pitha and baas pora mutton in starter, johu pitha was a new taste, baas pora mutton was like wow!! ,its really good and I will suggest everyone to try this,less spicy but soo tasty. Then we ordered Wild red rice kukhura ko masu(a sikkim dish) and korri gassi, taste is different and good. you have never tasted this type of food.

Then we moved to seafood cuisine, we ordered seafood beijing noodles and smoked fish and a prawn dish,taste is good and again i'll say bit unique.
This place is not for veg peoples,one of my friend is vegetarian and he just have rice or noodles to eat,no side dishes.
Really loved this place and would like to visit again.

All the dishes were perfect and made my lunch date a really happy one. :)

I have been planning to go to this good restaurant for months. Let me get straight to the food. The complementary drink was not as good like I expected. It tasted a bit flavorless. The table was unexpectedly small. When I asked the waiter to make us sit somewhere else he said no two seaters are available anymore. However, the couple who came after us were made to sit in a larger table. With a bit of frustration I swallowed my tunkha tarani.
We ordered Smoked Squid, Seafood Salad, Dragon Pepper Chicken and Seafood Beijing Rice.

The Seafood Salad was extremely delicious. However, I didn't like how they stuffed it more with cucumber and Bell peppers. Small squids and prawns were mixed with mayonnaise and cheese grating as the salad dressing. But I don't think they should put huge amounts of cucumbers and Bell papers in it (that's not pleasing to your taste buds when mixed with mayonnaise).

The Smoked Squid is another amazing dish I relished with great satisfaction. The dish was perfectly executed with one exception of course. They put some green leaves or some stuff I couldn't recognize which was not edible at all. I was a bit disappointed by that.


The dragon Pepper Chicken is something I look forward to having again. It was given in plenty amount and the flavor burst in my mouth.

The rice preparation isn't the best. I like it when the rice grains are longer and crisper. None of the criteria were matched. Plus the size of the prawns were pathetically tiny. I won't recommend it to my followers.

It has room for improvement. Given the prices, no wonder this restaurant has become so popular at a short span of time.

Small cozy place in Ballygunge Terrace. Would be a good place to hangout. Nice quite road. The ambiance could be lot better and the seating arrangements too. The tables are small and too close by. The food is great. Ordered Dragon Pepper Chicken, Seafood Beijing Rice, Smoked Squid and Seafood Salad. Comes in ample quantities. The squid tasted great, so did the salad. The rice was okayish and the chicken was very good. Probably will never go back coz I am not a seq food person. Bash Pora items are a must try though. 
Go there if you love sea food and a cozy environment.

Heard a lot of positive reviews about this place so finally decided to drop in here yesterday. As expected the food here was delicious to say the least. All the items right from the starters to main course were an absolute treat for the taste buds and were totally delectable. Bamboo shoot prawn among the starters was the icing on the cake and a must try at this place. The only problem with the place are its uncomfortable and hard chairs. Though they are probably put in place to give tje place a tribal feel yet i feel that they could have come with a bit of comfort. However, the excellent food quality more than makes up for it.Overall one of the best seafood cuisines I have ever tasted in Kolkata and it comes at a reasonable price too.

However we tried bash pora mutton which was quite authentic with a smokey flavor then we tried seafood rice which is too good. We also ordered prawn in schezwan sauce n chilli crab. The orawn was quite ordinary but the crab was too good. Overall a good experience.

So I went to this place intrigued by the name and boy was I surprised! This is as unique as it gets in Kolkata for a food joint. This Orissa-tribal themed place had me pleasantly surprised to think that the owners actually had the guts to execute the establishment of such a place in India where too extreme experimentation is usually frowned upon . But hey, times are changing.
I would like to note :

The Pros -
1. Awesome ambience and decor. Thumbs up.
2. Great food and hey, there's a free welcome drink too. Who doesn't love free. Superb.
3. The seafood is pretty fresh ,including the octopus,which,being an unusual thing to eat for Kolkatans, I was apprehensive about, post-ordering but turned out to be very fresh along with the squids.
4. The Orissa styled tribal mutton cooked in hollowed out bamboo shoots was something that I had never eaten and my advice to you all who drop by , DO NOT MISS THE TRIBAL CUISINE BEING SERVED HERE. I guarantee a fresh change for your taste buds.
5. Awesome value for money.

The Cons -
1. Location is a bit on the inside , so you might have trouble finding the place, unless you're a local.
2. Due to the lack of music playing inside, it gets too loud when all the tables are occupied.
3. The menu cards were torn and tattered and that is what put me in doubt in the first place when I sat down for my meal,but was relieved when I tasted the food.
4. The staff spilled a glass of water on my plate where he had just served the squid and the rice I had ordered and never offered a replacement for the same and just gave me fresh plate to eat what was left of my food after throwing away the wasted part. Neither was I offered a discount for the same and I paid for the entire food when I probably ate half of it . Blame it on the small table and the untrained waiter. These are small nitty gritties the owner/manager should always take care of to make the outlet stand apart from the others.

Overall, a good place for a different kind of a lunch date with your folks. I would have actually rated them 4.2 but hey, if it's a proper sit-down restaurant with platter to plate service, these service failures are a must no-no. I loved the food though. I would definitely visit again and advice all of you foodies to do so.

It's a great place for tribal food and is a heaven for seafood lovers.
We had Bansa pora, patra pora along with Wild red rice and Julu pitha. The Julu pitha, patra pora and wild red rice were delicious.  The chicken bansa pora seemed a bit bland whereas the mutton bansa pora tasted out of the world. So here's a tip, if you are going for the bansa pora, choose the mutton variant. Also do ask if prawn bansa pora is available. I've been told that it's off the menu but it is available.

We had order the most popular dish bansh pora mutton which had a very nice smoked flavour to it. We also had soru chakli, Shanghai octopus and chicken Cantonese noodles. Each and every item tasted unique  and I liked them very much. Looking forward to visit this place again.

Was on my wishlist for a long time. At last in last week I got the opportunity to have a bite there. I was with my colleague. Upon entering they offered us free Tankha Turani. Its a rice drink & different in taste than other normal drinks. Then we decided to go for full tribal cuisine. So we ordered their famous bansh pora & soru chakli. It was good. Then we ordered jadoh, jhupu pisi's motton delicacy & kori gassi. Though jhupu pisi was really good, combination of jadoh & kori gassi was just amazing. Bill was around Rs. 1100/-. Looking forward to try their seafood dishes in near future.

This restaurant was in my wishlist for quite a long time and today finally I got the opportunity to visit there.
Starting from the location, it is very easy to locate (beside the Anjali Jewellers, Golpark, lane.)

Ambiance - Absolutely unique with a tribal touch. The seats and tables are made up of bamboos. The walls have paintings of marine creatures and also the tribal art does justice to this restaurant. I am in love with their ambiance. :)

Staff Management - Decent enough.¬†

Food - On our visit we were served with their complimentary drink, which was a tribal drink in fact but tasted good to me.
Then we ordered their much hyped combination of wild red rice and bansa pora chicken which indeed tasted heavely! :D
The plan for our tribal lunch was absolutely satisfactory and each penny was worth it and we couldn't have asked for anything more than this.
The food quality and quantity was fair according to the price. :)

Pocket-pinch - Moderate.

If you haven't visited this restaurant by now then make sure that your next visit should definitely be this one. :D This place will not disappoint you. :)

Finally had a Chance to visit much hyped Restaurant SANTA'S FANTASEA at South kolkata.The first thing that caught my eyes was the decor. One room is ocean themed and another is tribal themed. It was different and beautiful. First They served a complimentary drink. It didn't tasted good to me but the gesture was nice. The food left me speechless. We ordered JADOH RICE(combination of red rice with motton),BANSE PORA CHICKEN (chicken marinated stuffed in bamboo and cooked in tandoor) and KUKHURA KO MASU (chicken flavoured with tamarind, coconut and herbs).Everything had so much of unique flavors. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted superbly delicious. Price and quantity is decent. I would love to try the other tribal dishes.But next time definitely will go to test SEA FOOD.

A place in Calcutta, that too in GOLPARK, serving reasonably priced seafood! Squid, octopus, prawns, lobster, crab, mackerel....you name it, they have it! I was thrilled. And I wasn't disappointed on either occasions I dined here. My personal favourites are the Smoked Squid, Voksa meh or mutton with bamboo gravy, noodles in their seafood red sauce, and red rice. Bonus points for the cute tribal theme that reflects on the walls, the furniture and the food. Thumbs up!

I've eaten multiple times from this joint but never really visited it. Queer but true, we were staying over at a friend's and decided to order in bulk from Santa's Fantasea.
The food is experimental but delightful.
We ordered Jhadoh, a tribal red rice that comes with juicy chunks of mutton. We all know the craze for Bansa Pora and true that it's yummy. But, do try the Patra Pora, boneless thawed meat loaded with spices and baked inside a huge piece of banana leaf. A meaty variety of Bengali's well adored Paturi.
I had it twice, while the first time left no room for complain,the second time had it slightly over done emphasising the inconsistency revolving around this dish.
Jhupu Pishi's Mutton Delicacy is a clear winner. The smooth, rich gravy still lingers in my mouth.
Smoked Squid was decent but I was sold to Baked Prawns. Soft, well cooked Prawns in a thick gravy of cheese and grated coconut, baked to perfection. Absolutely perfect!
Have heard a lot about their complementary welcome drink and quirky interiors and Ido wish to go there in person and enjoy a quiet meal.

A quality place to visit with friends, just up ahead the lane beside Anjali jwellers, Santa's Fantasea lived update upto its name...somehow. The welcome drink was just different...different from everything else we ever had before. The kimchi sea food salad however was not upto the mark-neither quality, nor taste was upto the mark. However the wine red rice was very delicious and so was the butter garlic squid. The sauce was just awesome. Compared to it, the chicken was a bit downer. We could smell the kancha Tel in it. However we can visit again the place for the squid, and by extension, octopus.

Location: Golpark, beside Anjali jewllers. Santa's Fantasea is a perfect blend of seafood and tribal food. Serving a variety of dishes, this restaurant can be any food lovers delight. I tried the much acclaimed Banspora Mutton(Note: I ordered banspora chicken, but got mutton as the order was not executed correctly) along with Julu Pitha, which in my opinion is really good and 1 julu pitha can suffice your hunger. Another must try is the Crab Momo. A rather new dish in terms of the Crab meat served with momo. Would've given five star if not for that wrong order.

They welcome you with a drink,which itself is awesome. We tried shanghai squid,smoked octopus,wild red rice,bansa pora mutton,tilhou kheer. And trust me all of them were awesome, I will go there again,hopefully they will maintain their standard and quality of food ¬†always. It is undoubtedly one of the top 3 restaurants in kolkata at this moment.

We ordered bansh pora accompanied with some tribal roti and squid with red rice.. The gave us complimentary drink before they served us the dinner. The food was really good so was the behavior of the people.

its a sea food lover,s paradise! the quality they serve and the price they charge is a rare combination in urban kolkata. 
i had visited the place with friends. after being served with the complimentary drink - tankha turani - we ordered smoked squid, smoked octopus and sanghai squid. the squid was so fresh and soft that we even ordered some for take away. the sanghai preparation was a bit spicy. octopus was really good too. for main course we went for the much famous bansh pora mutton, juli pitha, soru chakli and bnash pora chicken. the bnash pora items were delightful surprise to people who are not fnd of oily food. the soru chakli went well with the mutton. but honestly we did not like the julu pitha much. 
overall the food was excellent both in terms of quality and quantity. and its refreshingly friendly for the pocket. 
the interior and service was nice and did not leave any space for complains. i look forward to visit the place soon. 
( note : this place does not have a huge capacity and does not take prior reservation, so the weighting time can spoil the sport a bit)

Finally Santa's Fantasea. Tribal theme is new. And I love new. So yay! OK, serious stuff!
Squid in Shanghai sauce is amazing. Trust me. With a crunchy texture and the softest flesh, its a must try. Shezwan and Pepper Sauce Crab. Well, its not everyday that you get to dig in with your fingers and bite your way into seafood awesomeness. So must try too. Bansh Pora Mutton is what this joint is famous for. It was good, but not extraordinary. Probably, we expected too much. Seating is good. Service pretty fast. I will definitely go back for some delectable seafood that's friendly on your pocket.

Got a glipmse of taste few days ago and got some reliable recomendations too. So,thought to try once. The location is convenient- just in the alley beside Golpark Anjali Jwellers. The decor is innovative but it was instantly apparent that their budget on interior was highly limited. Ok, sometime you don't have big sit capital. The floor tiles were not properly fitted. The wash basin was in some clumsy area. The kitchens were visible, toilet was not enough clean. Actually, the staffs there are novice, yet humble and service is quick.

As we entered, a complimentary welcome drink was served. It was a bit salty and sour. Neither hate it, nor liked it.
We ordered Soru Chakli, Bans Pora Mutton and Jadoh Rice.
¬† ¬†
Soru chakli: Rubbery... Hey guys, You have mixed too much Maida/Atta with Rice dust. Change it to Chal gura+daal bata (skip Maida/Atta) and other spices you already use. It will be Perfectly soft and taste better.

Bans Pora Mutton: Originally a tribal dish from Odisha and Andhra. They used a conventional dry bamboo. So there was no seperate flavour of it. The mutton was decent and tasted fair enough, though don't live up the hype. The smoky flavour was short lived. Though they said that, they cook/roast the mutton inside the bamboo for 3-3.5 hours, I highly doubt it. If it was so, the flavour would have last longer.

Jadoh rice was definitely excellent. Tasted really good. It is itself a good meal, requiring no side dish. This one is highly recomendable.

Didn't try their seafood. But saw some as they were carrying to other tables. I think they use too much artificial colors. Deep intense green- yes no natural looking green, on two unknown dishes. I hope they are food grade colours.

Couldn't be too excited about the restaurant. I think they have taken gimmicky policies. They aren't horse for the longer race.
I will give the final verdict only after trying the seafoods.

Did I forget to mention the tax and service charges are included? Urrr.... are excluded? Because they don't give you pakka bill. Just a piece of paper. They don't pay it... so don't take it from you. In one word...this place is overhyped and overrated...

The food was good though, took prawn momo, smoked fish, Kori gassi, Sea food noodles with only fish and prawns.
We were served a welcome drink.. Tankha Turani.. It was yukk..
Kori gassi was a bit weird coloured  and had no taste..
The restaurant is very pocket friendly.. All taxes and charges inclusive..

The food was delectable. We had ordered Shanghai Squid in starters and well the initial squeamishness was driven out by the awesome taste. For the main course we ordered Wild red rice, Bansa Pora Chicken and Jhupu pisi's mutton delicacy.  The rice was truly mind blowing and you could have it as a stand alone. The mutton was ok, felt a bit under cooked. But all in all the food is awesome and reasonably priced though the place is a little small.

Not enough seats are available but if u have to wait outside for a bit the taste of food will mesmerise u for sure. The preparation of smoke fish, squid and bansh pora seems to be perfect. We 4 friends had our lunch and it just costs around 1200. Which was the cherry on the cake. Go and have some ultimate tribal and sea food guys n gals...

If you are bored with Chinese or continental or  mughlai cuisines then you should try out the food here... Tribal and seafood... The place beautifully decorated keeping in mind the cuisine.. The tribal dishes are truly delicious. I ordered the Kerala mutton soup which was mildly cooked with minced mutton and herbs. Very tempting. The mutton bansh pora deserves special mention. Don't miss out on it. The wild red rice or the jardoh rice compliments the mutton bansh pora. The sea food menu is also good . they serve very soft and tender praws and the crab momos are really nice. I have had almost 5 to 6 visits to this place and each time the food satisfied my taste buds. Love this place. A must visit.

The staffs are very helpful too. It has unique dishes at a very reasonable price. Food you just can't miss- Shanghai squid,Baansh pora,red seafood rice,the lobster,smoked fish and maybe many more which I am still left to try. Though at times you actually have to wait for hours before you can get your food,trust me,it's worth it.

Was planning to visit this place for quite some time. Got the chance today. The place could have been a bit bigger, too small for my liking though. Tribal food and sea food are the cuisines they offer. Ordered a plate of crispy babycorn with  pepper and mushroom along with a plate of schezwan prawn. Didn't like the babycorn but the prawn was yummy. Main course included Malaysian sea food fried rice and Beijing sea food fried rice; both tasted good. The smoked crab is nice as well. The highlight of the lunch was banspora chicken, too delicious.. The rates are reasonable as well.. If someone wants to try some different cuisine, definitely visit this place. On my next visit want to have a bite from different sea food delicacies.

Located conveniently in the heart of the city, this small food joint scores 5/5 for its innovative tribal theme as per my judgement. However, cushioned chairs would surely add a little more comfort to the otherwise hard wooden chairs. One would really feel welcome with the welcome drink that they serve. Banshpora mutton is no doubt very tasty with shoru chakli but a bit pricey as compared to the quantity. Malaysian rice was superb. Smoked octopus was not as good as Ecstasea. Chemen kheer was full of prawns. In a nutshell, if one is too tired of having the traditional cuisines, this innovative variety of food can be cherised at a much reasonable price.

A very good place to dine if you are fond of trying something new or you are fond of seafoods. I had a desire of trying out their tribal cuisines. And I wasn't dissatisfied at all. The staffs were very cooperative and helpful.¬†
The chair and tables are all made of bamboo.
They offer a strange welcome drink prepared of some processed rice in a bamboo glass. Its good. They serve water in copper glass.

I went to this place with my parents. We ordered bans pora mutton, Nagatok, Wild Red Rice, Jadoh, Jhupu pisi, Voksa meh, prawn kheer. My parents and me liked the prawn kheer the most. I couldn't take pictures of all the food items because I was starving and couldn't stop myself from eating rather than clicking their pics.

Coming to food quality its: its too good! I'd give 5/5.
Quantity: I'd give 4/5.
Taste and satisfaction: 5/5.¬†
Price: its pocket friendly. They don't charge VAT or service taxes and other unnecessary charges! Moreover, they offer a strange welcome drink prepared of some processed rice. Its good.

I would love to visit this place again for seafoods!!!

I'm giving this place a rating of 4 because, there's no place to stand properly for people who are waiting in the queue. People have to wait on the narrow lane. There's no place to stand in burning sunlight and rain. When there's big line, it becomes tough for people to stand properly because of the vehicles running on the narrow lane.

Located in the lane beside the anjali jewellers, this place is a hidden treasure chest..i have been to this place twice this week and both the times the experience has been overwhelming...the staff is very friendly and take time to explain all the dishes on the menu..the ambiance is very tribal... And the food is exquisite...anybody who likes seafood must try the food here.. The menu is the most innovative one i have seen in kolkata so far and the dishes to try specially are the "baansh pora mutton", "honey chilli squid", "dragonpepper squid", "burnt chilli octopus" and complement it with the "seafood malaysian rice"....even the prawn and onion desserts are pretty unique....last but certainly not the least.. For the quality of the food... This place is really pocket friendly... All in all i have fallen in love woth this restaurant and would love to visit this place again and again...

We also ordered Chilli Wine Octopus and Seafood Beijing Rice. The food was really delicious as we'd heard before and as we expected. But somehow we we weren't impressed with the service. We weren't served the welcome drink that we saw others got. Other than that, it was a fine experience basing only on the food that was served.

A welcome change from the beaten track! This restaurant strives to go back to the roots, upholding the culinary excellence of tribal india. Besides this, their seafood offerings are also varied. This restaurant was on my wish list for a long time; so I must thank my friend who chose Santa's Fantasea to treat us. I REALLY liked their Banshpora chicken, jadoh (spicy rice with shredded mutton and a cinnamon flavor) kori gasi (chicken cubes in a green curry), malaysian noodles and dragon chicken (chicken in spicy red sauce)! I wish them good luck. They must keep up the good work and open up at a bigger space soon, to avoid the service delays and cramped sitting which are inevitable for a great place with overflowing patrons.

We visited there one week before... I must tell that it is a so so experience.. Nt so bad or good.. Price reasonable rather i say pocket friendly.ambience is good and cozy though limited place.2 room sitting arrangement. Staffs r good. Now coming to the main part if food.. We hav ordered the BASHPORA CHICKEN ,thn dragon squid,benzing topping rice and crab.. Everydish is tasty bt jst like good chineese dish.they told us that they invented the dishes..if u listen that words u will be upset.. Ammount is ok... Thn in desert they hav invisible desert .. This is a interesting part of d place.. U must try those.u will be surprised.though many things were nt available that day.. If u jst want a casual eatery u can go there.bt to me its nt upto d mark.they should make some interesting parts in menu.. And if u go must try d saru chakli and bashpora chicken or mutton mustly.....

located near golpark this place offers exquisite authentic tribal and sea food one needs. The bas pora mutton is a must for new commers, serving food through a bamboo is a one of experience. Even the sqiud and octopus are good. The complimentary drinks gives your taste buds a hell of experience.....

Amazing sea food....we had Bansh pora chicken,wine chilly horse mackarel,sanghai squid and Malaysian noodles... The chicken,squid and the noodles were awesome... But m not a fan of the horse mackarel though .... Service was not very good as the restaurant is under staffed... We had to wait a lot... But food was yum... Price is convenient too ..I would Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner..

We went to this restaurant on a Sunday noon. Be-aware the restaurant has a two hours break(4pm to 6pm) in the afternoon. We had to wait out side for 40 mins to get a table for 4 person (may be because it was a Sunday!).¬†
We had the following:
1. Tankha Turani - Avarage (you will not order it 2nd time)
2. Bansh Pora Mutton - Great (unique item, you will not find it anywhere else)
3. Crab Filled Momo - Good
4. Tuna Cheesy Salad - Avarage (after what I had at goa, quantity of Tuna fish is very less)
5. Schezwan Pepper Crab - Best Item (gravy was awesome)
6. Smoked Fish - Really Good (beware of bamboo shoots)
7. Mixed Seafood Fried Rice - Good

The restaurant is on ground floor, decoration is nice. It was made as a home initially so not like other restaurants. Take the lane beside Anjali Jewelers(Golpark). If you ask them(guards at anjali jewelers) the address, they will smile as they have to tell this to a lot of people daily. Cards are not accepted (take cash with you). Finally I feel it is bit overrated but foods are really good.

The best place to eat when you consider the price,variety and taste. If you are looking to try something new this is the place for you. They just cannot get wrong with anything. One of the few places where you can pick up the menu card and order anything you see,without the fear of how it may turn out. I would definitely suggest bansh pora and squid,and the jadou rice is really good

As soon as you enter this place you realize that it is different. The whole tribal setup is very appealing. We tried as per suggestions and enjoyed the food. We had smoked fish, Jadoh (Red rice with mutton pieces) , another side dish and prawn kheer. The concept and taste is unique and I am surely going to come back to try other sea food and tribal dishes.

A unique dining experience indeed! With affordable rates and unusual cuisine,this place serves up some scrumptious food. The decor is in keeping with their choice of cuisine, half of the place is done up in blue shades with fish,seaweed,octopus and mermaid painted on walls,whereas the other half is painted with tribal motifs.You are given a complimentary drink as you sit down to give your order. It's served in bamboo glasses and tastes a bit salty and tangy. Some may call it weird,I liked it. Ordered the famed mutton bansa pora with soru chakli. I was not disappointed, it was yummy,with an earthen taste and you could feel the taste of the spices. My friend was hesitant to try squid or octopus so we went with the smoked fish. I don't know what fish it was and I don't care,it was awesome :). The waiter recommended it,and we thanked him later for it. We also had seafood Malaysian rice which was alright. I am coming back to this place asap :)

A good place to enjoy ur food if u really want to try out something different, something out of the ordinary.
This place certainly has plus points along with a few negative ones.
Plus points are its cleanliness, calm environment, and an exotic food menu.
Have heard so much about its bansh pora chicken and Bansh pora muton, so decided to order bansh pora chicken as mutton was not available but to my disappointment it didn't quite tickle my taste buds. The Oyster chilly basil octopus was really good.
The wild red rice was not going well with either octopus gravy or the bansh pora chicken but the Seafood Malaysian Rice really went well with the octopus gravy.
The negative points of the place-
1. U have to wait a long time( at least 30mins) to get inside.
2. The place is too small to accommodate a lot of people. Only two six-seaters are available. Getting a place during any festival or occasion would really be hard.
3. Staffs are a bit rushy and always want to serve all the ordered dishes together( they should take into account that while I am enjoying a dish my other dishes will get cold).

3 of us went on a Sunday afternoon. We reached around 1 30pm and found it ALMOST full which was lucky cuz we found a gradually growing line of ppl waiting. There was a welcome drink and we ordered the bansa pora chicken (mutton wasn't available), jadoh, wine chilli mackerel and black pepper kingfish, although the head waiter kept advising against mixing tribal and sea cuisines . The food was AWESOME.. Every single item was delicious. The bill wasn't tat heavy on the pocket either. I would have rated 5, as no sort of sweet dish/dessert was available today and we yearned for some as the black pepper mix had gotten somewhat hot to handle by the end.

Tribal clothes, jewellery and now food. We tried prawn momo, smoked prawns for appetizer. The momo was awesome but the smoked prawns tasted ordinarily Chinese. They served a tribal rice wine which was good if you have an acquired taste for it. Mains we ordered Bansh pora mutton, chicken with lemon grass don't remember the tribal name, jolu pithe  and shoru chakli. The Bansh pora mutton was fantastic, the chicken somehow was a fusion of lemon and Thai chicken. Nothing tribal about that. The jolu pithe was unique , tasted like a stuffed idli. The shoru chakli reminded me of neer dosas. Good to the tastebuds. The showstopper was the onion Kheer I don't remember the name. It was very flavourful and crafted. The ambience was good if they can control the fish stench a bit. Worth a try.

Went to this place a week ago with the fam! It was on my wishlist for a long time since I wanted to taste their legendary bansh pora! So along with the mutton bansh pora we had the jadoh rice and a chicken side dish from Sikkim called khukura ko masu. Even though I absolutely loved the bansh pora and the rice,they were just delicious, the chicken dish did not appeal to my taste buds. The manager who took our order was the one to suggest it saying that it would go with the rice but it didn't. And the reason I gave them a 3.5 instead of a 4 is that they don't encourage serving both the tribal and sea food cuisine together. I wanted to have a prawn side dish which I couldn't take.And another thing is that the staff were in a bit of a hurry, coming to clear our plates before we had finished our food. But overall food was good,nice ambience and a plus point is that they served the food within 5 mins of ordering.

P.S The welcome drink was quite good.

I went to this place with a lot of expectation, having heard and read a lot of good things people had to say about it. Happy to say, it was all proved to be right.
The decor and ambience was quite appealing but nothing to go ga-ga about. The food however, is.
We had ordered chilly squid, banshpora chicken and wild rice and rounded it up with the prawn kheer. It was all quite delicious. Tempting enough to go back again. Banshpora manghso is of course a speciality here. And well worth all the praise. Loved the kheer too. Tue squid we were served on this occasion was a tad bit smelly but nothing too impossible to gulp down.
Waiters are courteous and helpful with suggestions. I liked the place for the different kind of flavours it offers my palate.

Santa's Fantasea was in my bucket list for a long time and I was not at all disappointed the day I finally paid a visit there. Apart from beautifully decorated, the food served here can give a tough competition to that of other lavish restaurants. I had ordered HONEY CHILLI OCTOPUS and SEAFOOD BEIJING RICE NOODLES. I doubt any other restaurant can serve something so delicious in such a reasonable price. Santa's Fantasea just earned another regular customer.

Others have written most of it, starting from the food to service to location everything is really superb and the best part is no service tax and no vat which makes this place stand out from the rest.

Since this place is close to my home it had turned into a weekend spot for us. After multiple visits I can vouch that both the staff behavior and the food quality has deteriorated drastically. Earlier there was this gentleman who guided us with selecting the menus and was very polite. But now I am feeling bad to write this review.

The only restaurant in Kolkata which is famous for it's tribal cuisine. I once asked the manager of the restaurant that how did this idea come to his mind. He told me about his desire to bring something new in people's lives apart from the same old chowmein, chilli chicken and biriyani. I would give a thousand claps to that man for bringing in something so unique, so extraordinary in our lives and that too in a very cheap price. Therefore, I'll highly recommend everybody to explore this place at least once. Apart from the bnasa pora mutton, their jhupu pisi's mutton and wild red rice are also good.

We went there on a saturday reading the zomato reviews. Yes,the zomato reviews were true to their word,about the food but the experience we had before we were ushered in was like unforgettable.We had booked a table,yet we waited "outside" the restuarant from 1.30 pm to 3.30pm in the scorching sun.At 3.30pm we were asked to place our order(while standing outside the restuarant,on the street!!! Yep..wow)..some of wanted to go somewhere else but the only reason we stayed back swallowing our pride, bcoz we wanted to taste the food,we had heard so much about.At 3.45pm we were ushered in.Yes the decor was superb, the food was awesome,but ordering on the street was humiliating. Hope you dont have to go through the same experience.But brownie points for the yumilicious food !!The bamboo smoked chicken and oyster chilli basil squid was out of the world..like nothing we had ever had before.The baked fish was great too.They didnt have many dishes like chemmen kheer which we wantd to order bcoz it was their closing time(but hey! We did arrive on time..so not our fault)..Altogether the food compensated for our incessant wait..so yeah we might go back again !!(but wouldnt wait for this long next time)

Had Jadoh, Bansapora chicken, crispy fried prawn, Oyster chilly basil octopus, Seafood beijing rice.Now coming to to them one by one,Jadoh: It was nice tribal cuisine from meghalaya, can be compared with our mangso r jhol bhat but with all new fragrance.Bansapora chicken: Awesome flavor of bamboo adds all the charm into it.
Crispy fried prawn: nothing special, it's just a prawn chop with chutney.
Oyster chilly basil octopus: It was a bit spicy near to chicken in oyster sauce. Octopus is like the stomach portion of the chicken.Seafood beijing rice: Type of mixed fried rice, tastes nice.To sum up, it was an all new experience for me to have such offbeat delicacies. Over all 4/5

Latest update: The much hyped restaurant of south Kolkata bogged down by quality and service.
They have stopped complimentary tankha turani and even you dont get you with a price. They will rpvide you with regular water which tastes like tube well water. Taste of jadoh and banspora chicken is much much deteriorated . Julu pitha has become so stiff that u need to work on it to get a bit! Much dissapointment!! 2/5 thistime.

Hence average comes to 3/5. May not visit within a year.

After a long wait finally i had a piece of santa's fantasea. Tucked away in a small lane near anjali jewellers this place is a beauty. Small not so spacious yet very comfortable. 
The decorations are unique. Before placing the orders we were greeted with a drink madr for rice and spices...a palate cleanser so to speak.

We ordered smoked squid which absolutely awesome..so rich in taste and spices..simply superb. Then we had joda ( a mizoram red rice with mutton) and baash pora mutton and kukurako masu( name sounds aweful but tastes brilliant). 

The rice was spicy had a subtle taste..quite liked it. The kukurakomasu was a chicken dish. It was very good in taste. 

But i will say ( now i know most will disagree to it) that the bash pora mutton us overhyped.. Yes!! I said it. Its overhyped. The mutton pieces were ok in taste and was not tender..atleast not to me. 

And i will also add that we wanted to crab momo whicjh was not available..and we also were also very excited about sassong chicken( or so i guess the name is) which was also not there.. Apart from these two tiny dissappointmnts i had a very good experience.

The price is very reasonable..all of wat we had cost around 900/-. I liked the restaurant keeping aside the cons. Will definitely return again.

This restaurant is easy to find. Walk around 50 @meteres into the lane beside Anjali Jewellers and you'll be greeted by this small restaurant.

Let me use a Q&A format to make it easier for you.

What do they make?
They specialise in Tribal and Sea-food.

What's their claim to fame?
Their bansh-pora chicken/mutton.

Why should I go?
Because of the food. I tried their Tribal specialities today. Loved their bansh pora chicken. It's new, it's interesting and it tastes really good! I was delighted with their tribal red rice. Both of these are a must. I had a mutton prep which was underwhelming and I don't even remember the name. Edit: Jhupu pishi's miutton delicacy. I have heard good things about their octopus dishes though!

Because of the decor. Decorated with bamboo chairs and Tribal stuff on the walls. It feels nice!

Because of the service. They bring your food within 10 minutes. I am NOT kidding. If you're hungry come here. Very unobtrusive but helpful waiters. The manager was very enthusiastic with his recommendations!

Because of the value for money. The don't charge you for their service. I keep telling you that I am not kidding. No service tax!

Who should I take?
Everybody you know. Ask them to bring friends and family!

Is there a reason I shouldn't go?
Nope. Nope. Nope. Don't eat the Jhupu Pisi's mutton delicacy though. Try something else!

Very nicely decorated and themed restaurant. Located near Anjali jewellers one might have to wait before getting a seat. Unfortunately the welcome drink was over when we arrived. Coming straight to the food, it was a very unique experience. Bansha pora mutton, wild rice, jhupu pishir mutton, schezwan octopus....each item was a gourmet's delight. They have a versatile and exhaustive menu. However the price is not very high considering the exotic foods available. Lastly we tried the pwawn kheer. It sounded something strange but trust me, tastes fantastic.

This was my second visit to the place. Undoubtedly the food was fantastic. But the "julu pithe" which was described as "indian burger" was not impressive. Rather is seemed like a modified version of pork bread, available in Teriitty bazar in the morning. The "banshpora mutton",  "Judah Rice", Octopus in oyster sauce and smoked squirt were just too good. But the experimental desert "piyajer payesh" was ok. Overall it's a nice place with a nice ambiance. Very cheap. Keep it up.
Just a small tip to the management team, try to make the table allotted for two a little bigger . Foodies need bigger space.üòã

Oh boy, what can I say about this little marvel..!! Tastefully decorated 2 rooms with theme of the cuisines they serve - seafood and tribal food. Tribal foods are mainly from north eastern india and odisha. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you will be greeted with a welcome drink named Tankha Turani, a rice water made drink from odisha. It was truly a different experience and a much deserved break from so called sweet lime soda and all. The best appetiser till date. Bansa Pora Mutton is their signature dish, a must must and must try. We had it with Soru Chakli, a roti prepared by rice dust, flour and egg. Both of them went well. From the seafood section, we tried Smoked Squid and Seafood Beijing Rice. Both of them are okay. I found better seafood dishes at Ecstasea to be faithful to the zomato followers. But a twist in the tale.... the dessert, Chemmen Kheer. Totally blowed away. Kheer with prawns in it. The best you can give to your taste buds. Staffs are generous. The owner keeps interacting with everyone. Altogether a very informal way of make you feel at home from the moment you drop in. 
N.B. Addition: Red Rice and Butter Garlic Prawn.

The place had been sort of a 'fantasea' to me for quite some time. Had a chance to go there very recently and I can now vouch for the awesomeness of the place with all sort of gastronomical sensibilities that I have grown up with. 

The bamboo chicken was just brilliant, almost a staple for anyone who comes here. Along with the shoru chakli though.

The schezwan crab was also very good, but we had a hard time breaking the shell with the spoon and fork provided. 

The malaysian meifoon was reasonably good as well. 

The problem though, lies not with the food, but with the service. It lacks warmth and humility. Apart from that, just for good regional cuisine and seafood, this should definitely be the place to go to.

Mutton? That too in a smoky flavour? This is the place..though the waiting time is too long. You might lose patience..but its worth it! Ordered bamboo mutton, red rice and a tribal chicken preparation..fingerlicking taste which remains for long long time..you will find the owner himself suggesting and taking your orders and explaining you details of your ordered food..incredible and different!

Service: poor during peak hours.
Food: good value for money, tribal section has got some interesting items..mostly are spicy yet very tasty eg. Bansh Pora Mutton, Ngatok, Jadoh. Julu Pitha was not liked by most of us..i guess it was the only item we did not like. Dessert section was also unique-we tried Chemmeen Kheer(kheer with prawn).

I visited the place on Sunday at 1.30 a.m. I was pretty surprised to see that the restaurant was full and five groups standing outside to go in. We had to wait for around 30 minutes but the wait was worthwhile. The decoration, the behavior , the quality of the food was just awesome...
We ate Wild red rice , Bansa Pora mutton , ¬†Ngatok , Shanghai Squid , Seafood Beijing Noodles , Smoked Crab. The Shanghai Squid was the best of all.

Sceptism prevailed then was absolutely drained away with the rice broth.... all one can say its aquired habitat. But bowled over with all their signature dishes.....mangsho kankra chingri and mixed seafood....kudos to them for epitomising tribal cuisine

It was my first visit to this place...not very far from my house..had to wait for 15-20 mins to get a table for 2..well it is indeed a seafood lover's paradise and the best part is that it is pocket friendly...But I do wish they train their waiters a bit more...
Coming to the decor,it gives you a feeling of rural India which is nice...also as soon as you enter,you are greeted by the smell of fish(which could really be a mood-killer for some people but definitely not for a seafood enthusiast like me)
We were welcomed with their traditional rice drink,Tankh Turani..
For starters,we ordered Smoked Crab and Shanghai prawn...Both were fresh and delicious...the crab tasted quite good unlike most of the restaurants I've had in
Shanghai prawn has a tangy flavor to it.
For mains,we had Bansh Pora Chicken and Soru Chakli....Chicken was spicy,aromatic and had a distinct smokey flavor to it..For the Chakli,they were thin,had the consistency of a homemade dosa,but went well with the chicken nevertheless...
Our total bill came to 690/-
Hope to try their squid and octopus too someday :)

This place had created a lot of hype.
Beginning with the decor,i found it really well-thought and detailed. The metal glasses and pitchers are an added delight to the tribal theme,but was a bit disappointed with the simple ceramic plates.
Loved the complimentary drink, a nice selection and effective gesture.
Ordered the hyped Baansh pora mutton,wild red rice and Kori Gassi.
The mutton had a unique charred and woody flavor to it and was tender but, i didn't find it matching the hype around it and a bit overpriced. The chicken dish had a different flavor and appearances. Worth trying as experimental tribal cuisine. I found the Wild Red Rice very ordinary and nothing different from schezwan fried rice.
Did not try their famed seafood dishes.
Will visit again.

If u are bored with regular Bengali,Chinese or Mughal foods then this is the right place for you...their tribal dishes have a unique taste something that you haven't tried before. I am not a seafood lover so m not telling anything about the seafoods but the tribal foods are really awesome specially the bansh pora ones.

My rating is not on the food or ambiance. Did not even taste the food there. ¬†If there was an option then would have given them negative marking.¬†

Firstly, it says in Zomato that table reservation is recommended but when I called them for a reservation for today evening, to my surprise they informed me that they do not do any table reservation. They blamed Zomato for not updating it even after their repeated communication to Zomato. He asked me to come a bit early and so we went for an early dinner at 7 pm today. On entry to the premises we were confronted by a shabby guy (yes we were confronted), who did not even bother to great us. Rather we felt a bit intimidated. We felt very very unwanted and when we asked for a table for two he told me in Bengali 'Hobe na Hobe na' which basically meant won't happen. However, I could see some four seaters where empty (and since they don't do table reservation, they were not reserved for any one I guess) and we were still refused for reasons unknown. We felt really humiliated and unwelcome and just left.¬†

Dear Team Santa's Fantasea you will appreciated that who ever goes to a restaurant they go for having a good time and thats why they do not mind paying for that but if there is no good about the experience then whats the point of paying. What is surprising is how can you have such a rude untrained person at the front? We wanted to enjoy the evening but your team made sure that it goes the other way.¬†

I do not recommend anyone to such unprofessional place.

Finally managed to visit this place on the second try. The 1st time it didn't happen as there were a lot of people waiting so I had to skip the plan. This place is actually a bit hard to find for a 1st timer and you may have to ask someone for the exact location.¬†

Now after getting in, we were served with a complimentary drink, the name of which I forgot, unfortunately. It was nice and I liked it. As we were visiting this place for the 1st time, we had absolutely no idea what to order and which dish was a starter or a main course! The waiter understood that and he helped us select our meals. So we went ahead and ordered Bansa¬†pora Chicken and Bansa pora mutton as starters, and Seafood Beijing Rice and Smoked Squid as the main course. The bansa pora chicken and mutton had this burnt smokey taste which I found to be quite good and it added to its flavour. The rice was also good, but it had small pieces of baby corns in it which I felt to be a little undercooked. And finally the Smoked Squid was awesome, it was kind of rubbery and even with a fork I found it difficult to pick it up from my plate (not a bad thing). The sauce that was used to cook the squid was delicious and with the rice it made the combination very tasty.

The ambience of the place is also very good with decorations and tribal drawings on the wall and even the chairs and the tables are made from Bamboo and wood combination and it is also very pocket friendly which is a huge plus. Overall, this place is not at all like any other regular restaurants and it has its own special identity mainly because of the food they serve which you won't get easily in any other restaurants. I kind of like visiting such unique restaurants and anyone reading this review¬†if you know any joints with special foods that won't put a hole in my pocket, please do let me know :)

Recommended!

This was my 1st encounter with sea food... It was better than my expectations. Loved the decor, but seats could have been more comfortable. The service was prompt,. The welcome drink was different bt didn't suit my taste buds. Liked julu pitha, though the chicken was not properly seasoned, loved the smoked squid, totally. Crab momo was an utter disappointment, dry with no sauce. Sanghai fish compensated for the disgust, Szechuan crab was decent., seafood noodle was simply superb. At the end a surely new experience which was more or less pleasant and went easy on my friends pocket..

This one is a highly rated one. And you will know why once you have visited it. A tribal themed restaurant with a seafood cuisine, add to that very polite behavior of the owner.
However I found the baanspora a little bit overhyped. Also the octopus although palatable was not really my cup of tea. :( . loved the seafood soup with the lemon grass though. Will definitely visit again.

This tribal themed restaurant is beautifully designed. I loved the welcome drink and Banso Pora to my fullest. The wild Red Rice was nothing but the replica of Schezwan Rice but the Kori Gassi preparation is what I liked. Prices was a little higher than we expect.
I recommend you to visit this place as it is the sole place serving you some authentic tribal cuisine in the city.

I tried both Octopus and Squid here, both are fabulous. Personally, I'll recommend everyone to try the squid, it's delicious. Also, the restaurant is famous for serving unique tribal foods, so I'm going to have to try them next time.

The restaurant is not that huge but if you skip it for that reason you are gonna miss to please your tastebud with some awesome seafood and tribal foods. This restaurant is best in Kolkata when it comes to Seafood and Tribal Cuisine. It have two rooms one is designed with Seafood and the other one with Tribal Environment. Each and every dish is awesome.

How to go-- It‚Äôs near Gariahat crossing in South Calcutta, opposite of  the Ramakrishna Mission at Gol Park area, in a lane just beside Anjali Jewellers (at the Ballygunge Terrace Road, Map is included in my pictures )

Ambience & Mood--Two small rooms are there. One is sea theme based and the other has tribal look. The decoration is really arty and innovative; walls are painted in blue, green shades (pastel hues). Wall hanging fishes are dangling from the ceiling: the little mermaid and fern moss painted wall give you a feeling of being in submerged dream land. In the tribal room, you will find tribal clay statues, some beautiful painting along with tribal designed ( ‡¶Ü‡¶≤‡¶™‡¶®‡¶æ ) wall decoration.¬†
¬†‚Ä¢	peek-a-boo
The glasses are made of copper which is really healthy and the salt and pepper box are made of wood. Not only is that, the chairs and tables are altogether made out of bamboos.It‚Äôs the hard work of the young entrepreneur doing a great job, after running a hotel in Chandipur and working as a direct supplier for a long time. 

Kitchen-- Whenever I attempt a particular spot, I watch out for cleanliness stuff. I discover the kitchen is super dark, grimy and very unhygienic. My friends are not prepared to eat there but I somehow cool off the entire circumstance. How to know the kitchen of any eatery? Order for their Pan fried items or kebab... You will know it!¬†
¬†‚Ä¢	Peek-a-boo¬†
¬†Bathroom! All things considered, it's ideal to sit eat and go without utilizing that! ¬†

People-- Service was smooth and people are friendly enough to help and clarify the diverse dishes.
‚Ä¢	Peek-a-boo
Yes they are fast but be ready to wait for 20/25 mints after ordering your item.

Food-- Our order:-
#i)	Tankha Turani- The Tankha Turani was served in a bamboo glass as Complimentary drink. I know that the 'Tanka Torani', a delicious mix of rice water, lemon juice, curry leaves, ginger, green chilli and salt. There is another rice drink from Odisha (popularly known as 'hariya' among the tribes). These drinks work as an appetiser. They tried to get that kind of taste in it. But I did not like it at all.
‚Ä¢	Peek-a-boo
¬†Here the taste of Tankha Turani varies with time!!! Sometime it‚Äôs normal buttermilk with herbs, sometime its pudina, jeera green colored drink. But trust me Sabu Dana drink is the worst kind of. They are not at all original 'Tanka Torani' which I tasted before.
#ii)	Oyster chilli basil octopus- Its Thai dish and the most beloved street food. It‚Äôs known as pad kra octopus.  Oyster sauce and holy Basil makes it additionally aromatic, soft and juicy. The proper mincing and grinding releases all the juices and oils of the chillies and garlic and it brings out an extra depth of flavour, makes the entire dish more vibrant, garlicky and spicy. It is normally eaten on top of a pile of plain steamed jasmine rice with a fried egg on the side.¬†
¬† Here the dish is okay, rather tastes like Szechuan sauce. Octopus was juicy soft but my suggestion is if the size is big then you should make it shredded or it looks odd to some extent.¬†
#iii)	Wine chilly mushroom- The original dish is like Sliced Chicken and Black Mushroom in Burnt Chilly with Wine Sauce. This sauce tends to get a sharp kick which might possibly be the red wine. It‚Äôs still a lovely sauce gives the gravy proper volume.¬†
¬† Here this dish is 5 out of 5 according to my taste bud.
#iv)	Shanghai Squid- The dish was invented by Westerners using Chinese cooking styles. It is a Indo Chinese dish, a preparation of making squid in Chinese sauces along with Indian herbs and seeds (ginger, garlic, sesame oil, scallions/green onions, soy sauce, sugar and vinegar) and then served with the garnishing of spring onions. It is mainly unique non-vegetarian appetizer from the list of Chinese recipes. People say that Shanghai items got absolutely nothing to do with Shanghai. A lot of people in Shanghai will not like this dish because many people in Shanghai cannot handle large amounts of garlic.
¬†Here the dish was bad tastelessly over spicy! Chewy and over fried! Where is the original taste of squid? It tasted like over fried shrimp. We did not finish it. Big thumbs down.
#v) Veg fried rice- Second best of all. Less oil, good to taste and soft. 

*Why I choose this place--
1) The cheapest seafood in town 2) Hard to get proper tribal food 3) Decor and ambience 4) No service tax or any other taxes included 5) Car parking 6)The quantity of food and fast service.

**Why not--
1)	Overhyped 2) All dishes almost taste same 2) It‚Äôs famous for tribal food but I expected better from them 3) Seafood is normal, I tasted better. 4) The food item cooked with an excess of sauce, which suppressed the essence of the main meat/ fish 5) Need a major improvement in the area of hygiene. 5) Small place. 6) Because of the rating, try to come as early as possible otherwise you have to wait outside. Avoid Weekends/ lunch and dinner time. 7) Card is not accepted here.

¬†***My OVERALL rating***
Food quality: 2.5/5
Food presentation: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Ambience ‚Äì 3.5
Hygiene - 2
Value for money: 4/5

I want give it another try with some tribal food. Next time I want to choose the menu more carefully according to my taste bud and hope to come to you with better picture and experience :)

Somewhat authentic, but generally run of the mill is how I would sum up my review. We were enthused by the glowing reviews to pay a visit to this small eatery in ballygunje terrace for a Saturday dinner. Firstly, I find the offering and menu confusing, tribal cuisine and seafood, which is mainly oriental in nature. I don't see how one can reconcile the two offerings.

We ordered the famed Orissa bansa pora, which is lamb cooked over tandoor in a bamboo. While the offering was fancy, the mutton was not hot and the smokiness which is the essence of the dish was missing. Then we ordered a noodles and a devil pepper chicken dish, which were pretty standard fare. Something that any normal chinese eatery in Kolkata would serve. 

I was also not impressed with the cleanliness of the place. The tiles were broken and I could see gas cylinders lying In an inside room. The service was good and fast and the owner takes personal interest in the goings on. However, a little attention to detail and a focused menu would do wonders for the place

I loved this place.  Mindblowing food.  Good ambience.  Polite waiters.  And no VAT or service tax.  We were welcomed with  Tankha Turani,  a rice drink from odisha in bamboo cups . We ordered Crab Momo which turned out to be lip-smacking.  Then we ordered Shanghai squid,  smoked crab and honey chilli prawn.  Every dish was cooked to perfection.  I will revisit this place again and again just for  the crab .  The shanghai squid was good.  But last time i visited this place,  the squid had tasted better.  I was a bit sad as octopus was not available. But then,  there is always a next time... Oindrila Chakraborty

Awesome is an understatement when it comes to 'theme' offerings... ¬†A small food joint situated near Golpark Anjali Jewelers, Kolkata specializes in tribal foods mainly from Orissa and Kerala as well as other parts of India... I will not be able to comment whether the same is 'authentic' or modified but either ways, they promise to delight your taste buds... And what is sure to surprise you is the price!!!¬†

Please do not forget to try Bnaashpora (meat cooked in bamboo) while you are there...

Though i came here to taste the octopus dishes, but it was my bad luck that those were unavailable at that moment. Still the void was filled with mouth watering squid dishes and the authentic bansh pora mutton. Over all a very nice experience, keep up the good work.

if you are not Indiana Jones or Shankar Roy Chaudhary from Chander Pahar you would most probably not bother about leaving behind the know favourites like Moglai or Bansa Pora Mutton.YOu would not most probably even know of most of things on the menu here.I would gladly mark this place as must vist just based on the gastronomical experiences. The.The menu traverses from Arunachal to Andhra bringing out some of the lost flavours of lost India ,a part most of us would not even see.Kudos for you may be actually saving some of the culinary traditions from getting lost.The interior is nicely done with bamboo and tribal motifs which actually goes quite nicely with the theme.A rice drink is served in a cut bamboo cup making it all the real.There were two parts to the menu A sea Food a Tribal Food Menu.The seafood menu is quite extensive offering everything from Red Snapper to Octopus.The best part is you don't have to sell your kidney for the experience it is quite affordable.Would i recommend it...well if you think there is more to eating out than Muglai,Chinese ,South Indian and Benagli...absolutelllyyyy

Most organized, most economical restaurant, these are two characters that I found when I visited this place after reading a lot of positive reviews from Zomato. I don't want to say anything about the location bcz it is already given here with map. I am a foodie so I am now straight going to their foods, first of all they will serve you a compulsory drink which is neither so good nor so bad. I ordered bansh pora chicken, Jadoh, Malaysian rice, octopus with black bean sauce and smoked squid. The taste of the Malaysian rice,octopus and smoked squid was just awesome but disappointed very much when I tasted their signature dish bash pora , omg the flavor was extremely smoky and undercooked that I was unable to finish the single bite of it and it was totally waste then I would like to tell something about jadoh, jadoh is a rice which has some smoky flavor and a very uncomfortable aroma and the quality of rice is not very good I think this is a tribal food so they may use low price rice but due to these nature of this dish I was unable to eat ¬†and 70% of jadoh was waste. At last I would say to all food lovers that you should visit this place for extremely tasty sea foods but please order tribal foods if you are a great lover of it otherwise please thing twice.

The place is really nice with two sections. One is tribal another is sea. But you can eat anything in any section.
So what I tried there was tankha turani which is a rice drink from odisha and it is complementary and I don't like it very much.
But after that the dishes which I tried was awesome. I tried fantasea special soup which contains seafoods like fish, prawn, crab, squid and octopus and which will give you a mouth watering taste. After that we ate soru chakli which is actually a roti made with dust of rice, maida and egg with bansa pora chicken (chicken marinated stuffed in bamboo and cooked in tandoor) and this combination is marvelous.
In the main course what I tried was seafood cantonese noodles, mongolian fish and honey chilly octopus. And these 3 dishes are also good.
Again visited and tasted baansh pora mutton, and I must say it is better than baansh pora chicken. Tried smoked octopus and shanghai squid and the squid is awesome.
Really love this place.

Its nevr late that I realised & was quite disapntd on finding out the reality against my expectations. I really dint like chicken banspora. The taste resembles that of chicken stuffed in a chickn roll. Dont knw why ppl are adding a lot of colour to the original version. I was excited to have smoked squid  but all my excitement ebbed at the sight of it as there was a half dead- half moving fly in it. Kinda bad experince..

One of the best restaurant in South Kolkata I have ever been to. Best known for tribal foods and seafoods. Easy to reach - located near Gariahut Golpark, very close to Anjali Jewellers. Nice and cosy little place to have your meal. Stuffs are very cordial. I tried Smoked Octopus in seafoods, Baans Pora Mutton, Ngatok and Wild Red Rice in Tribal foods. Smoked Octopus and Ngatok were awesome. I would definitely recommend this place.

After reading a plethora of 5 star reviews , on a rain marred day we decided to visit this place, the joint is small albeit packed, the menu is vivid , we ordered for banshpora chicken, mongolian seafood rice , smoked fish and after a while shanghai squid, the food was served prompt, here i would like to say that there is certain euphoria about the banshpora chicken but i found nothing special in it, to be honest it tasted like the cubes of chicken in a chicken roll. Nevertheless what really ticked me off was there was a "fly" in the shanghai squid, a moving wiggling fly, when i pointed it out to the server he took it without even saying a sorry or anything,we waited for 20 minutes for the squid but it didnt arrive, so we called for the bill, what was astonishing was they added the full price of the squid in the bill, when i pointed it out, they said your squid is coming, we packed it and left as soon as possible. The 2 is very gracious of me.

Let me review first in one word " Overhyped". Yes, that's right. Such good reviews from Zomato users, lots of appreciation and an outcome.. Total disappointment.. It started with Tankha Turani, a tribal drink which was Ok, Not that bad type. In starter we ordered Sanghai squid and Crack leaves Squid. Both tasted nothing but Baby corn to me. Then we were waiting for the so called Star food, yes Smoked octopus. Star food, but "so called".That's right. It was good, but can't give a Star Rating! Anyways proceeded with the much-publicized dish "Bansha pora" Mutton and chicken.. And again comes the disappointment. We had ordered Seafood Malaysian Rice(which was great! yes i liked it.) and seafood malaysian noodles(a complete disaster).The location is convenient. But the place was water logged due to heavy rainfall. So we had to face a lot of trouble to check in there.Anyways 2.5 rating out of 5. Not that bad, not that good!

Ok ill be rating this restaurant in three different ways.. 
1. Decor and environment.. The interior is a cosy setting and can accommodate upto 25 people or so at once.  So on a busy day like a holiday be prepared to wait outside. (its worth it). 4/5
2. Food.. The menu presents a wide choice of exotic food that are a bit uncommon for a regular restaurant. But if you have the courage to experiment, you will be pleasantly surprised. 4/5
3. Price..  The price was absolutely reasonable for me.  With the complimentary drink,  and other exotic items with reasonable prices, This restaurant wins my heart and vote of confidence.. 5/5

P.S do try the julu pitha and banspora chicken/mutton if you are visiting

This was my second visit to this place, after I found out about it on Zomato. The decor is quite unconventional, and you feel like you are in a quaint little eatery in a village. Once you take your seats, tumblers of a delicious tribal drink called Tankha Turani are offered to you. This is complimentary, and acts as an appetizer by stimulating your taste buds. For starters, we decided to order Shanghai Squid, an item they have failed to add to the existing menu, but delectable nevertheless. It's a crispy fried spicy squid dish, which is quite filling for two people. For our main course, we had tried Bansa Pora Mutton the first time, but we had felt it's a bit overrated. It tasted quite similar to the mutton dishes prepared at home. So this time, we decided to order Mixed Seafood Rice Noodles, and a Mackerel dish. Didn't like the mackerel dish much, but noodles was good. The first time I had visited, it was a weekday and the restaurant was comparatively less crowded. So the waiters were more attentive. But this time, it was very crowded, and service wasn't as good as before. I would suggest they either expand the area of this particular outlet, or branch out to meet the increasing demands. Another thing which disappointed me was that their Crab Momos are almost never available, in spite of being on the menu.

Heard about the restaurant from one of my friend. Went there for lunch yesterday. One of  the many drawback is that you have to stand outside the hotel if you are in queue. u can't park your vehicle. food is good though. Not extra charges added. Watever amount is mentioned in the menu card. Bansh pora chkn/ mutton is must have. U will all kind of seafood including octopus and squids. food is sumptuous . The restaurant is a combo of tribal and seafood. You can give it a try. lacks a lot in professionalism though..

In one word - Overhyped.. went there yesterday for lunch.
Ambiance- located in golpark just a few steps away from anjali jewellers, is this tiny little space converted into a restaurant. It's a colourful place with lots of marine and tribal decorations on the wall. And immediately on entering you get a typical smoky bamboo smell which some may love and some (like me) may not like.
Food- first of all, the complimentary  drink they serve is very light and soothing. we ordered Malaysian rice, Beijing rice, bansh pora chicken, Shanghai squid, smoked octopus, black pepper sauce crab and a tofu dish. Loved the squid and octopus. Malaysian rice was normal.. and Beijing rice was a complete disaster.. it was completely bland and spiciest of all. And I didn't feel anything extravagant about the bash pora chicken except from the way they serve it. crab was good.. but the gravy of crab, octupus and fish tasted almost the same.. the fish was also not as fresh as expected.
Waiters behaved well initially but later got in a hurry of closing the restaurant.. prices are normal for the seafood dishes but qauntity they serve is just somehow okay for two.
For having a one-time experience of seafood and tribal food combo.. this place is okay.

After a long wait I finally got to visit this place and was left totally amazed by such an outstanding yet humble foodie paradise. The place is set up in the ground floor of a residential house and sprawls across two rooms. Both the rooms are beautifully decorated with seafood pictures and odisi tribal depictions.

The food was fantastic. At first, we were served a complimentary drink consisting primarily of rice water with herbs and spices, which was very refreshing and tasted really nice. This was followed by Shanghai Squid, Basil Smoked Octopus, Bansh Pora Mutton with Soru Chakli (rice chapatis), Red Rice with Mutton, Crab in schezwan sauce. All of them were truly remarkable. We enjoyed the squid very much; having ordered it twice. Bansh Pora Mutton was a totally different experience altogether. The flavour was very unique from anything I have ever had. And lastly the octopus: I was a bit squirmish about it at first. But just one bite changed my opinion about it. The taste was just brilliant. Its like prawn but a bit more chewy.

This place very beautifully cherishes the cuisines of the odissi fisherman tribal community. I heavily recommend it and am looking forward for more.

At your first glance you can miss the restaurant in a cozy road... Small nice and tidy place, great ambience, good food. Ordered 5 items... Bansh pora chicken, wild red rice, soru chakli, oyster chili basil squid and malyasian noodles. Among them wild red rice, bansh pora chicken, oyster chili basil squid and soru chakli was great but the noodles is bad as the seafood items are not cooked properly...otherwise all is well... Specially liked the oyster chili basil squid. Hope to visit again...

Today went to santa's fantasea. The decoration was nice and all the sitting chairs tables even glasses are made of wooden materials like bamboo.. And the deco in the walls are amazing.. They all made the atmosphere like tribal area.. üòÄ..
The services are also quick and good. They gave us welcome drink named tankha turani. Which was an average..then we ordered soru chakli, bansa pora chicken(orissa), wild red rice, oyster chilli basil squid and seafood malaysian noodles. Soru chakli was good enough. Bansa pora chicken was tasty.. Wild red rice was different and good. Oyster chilli basil squid tastes awwsm.. I ate for the frst time and it's so yummy. But, seafood malaysian squid is not good enough... The squid in it is undercooked or else whatever... It smells bad. I dnt like it.. But i like all the other things which all over make my day... Happy to be there.

The place was almost inconspicuous, but for a slight queue on a Tuesday night.
That's right! A queue on a weekday night.

That itself should speak volumes about this place.
Always an admirer of seafood, coming to this place was a culinary achievement. :D
We ordered schezwan octopus and it was delightful (to say the least). But it did leave us gasping for air (read, spicy). The ngotak (naga preparation of some fish) was great as well, and so was the sticky rice.
However, the seafood Beijing noodles was a bit heavy on the oil front. A little less oil would've been good.

The decor blends right in with the essence of the place. The place, however, is a little short on space.


PS- they serve a complimentary drink to every customer. Missed the name of the drink :/ but who cares as long as it tastes good!?? :'D

This new restaurant, (well, more than a year old at this point, I think, but still new comparatively) had been on my wishlist since last year's pujo. At that time, people weren't even that crazy about this place. I just randomly checked it on Zomato one day and thought I should go. Well, after cancelling a million plans, finally managed to convince a friend to join me as I visited Santa's Fantasea today. Within this one year, it has taken the city by storm and has become the place for youngsters to try two uncommon cuisines at really low prices.

We arrived a little after lunch hours, around three and though there was no queue as expected, the place was half full. The first room was ocean-themed and was slightly smaller and more dimly lit as compared to the tribal-themed one.

We decided to stick to seafood and ordered a Seafood Malaysian Rice, a Shanghai Squid and a Oyster Chilli Basil Octopus. We were also served the complementary drink, Tankha Turani, in beautiful carved wooden mugs.

In the Zomato reviews, I had read that people weren't too fond of the Tankha Turani so I wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. It had a delightful slightly salty, slightly tangy taste to it and we sipped it as the dishes arrived. The squid was first to arrive and it was definitely the dish of the day. Big pieces of squid were fried with a thin, crispy batter which resulted in a crunchy outer coating but a soft, chewy inside. It was served in a spicy and garlicky gravy. What's not to love? The rice we loved as well as it had a distinct flavour to it's own. Many a times we are disappointed by the rice/ noodle dishes as they are just served as an accompaniment to the main dishes. But I could just eat this flavourful rice on its own, which not to mention had a HUGE amount of seafood in it. If there was one dish we were a tiny bit disappointed with, it would be the octopus. It simply had too much oil in it too really relish the taste. The octopuses in themselves, were properly cooked though.

Our bill amounted to 530 Rs. The service was very fast and the servers really REALLY polite. Definitely will visit again to try their tribal dishes. :)

This review is based on the two occasions that i have visited the place, the 1st time we had a full fledged dinner of only the tribal dishes and 2nd time it was a light meal of the seafoods.Enough has been spoken of the ambience already, so I will concentrate on only the dishes

1)Bansh pora mutton: the most raved about dish of the place.Very good in taste, quantity OK for the price, but yes, the smoky flavour could have been a bit more than the curried flavour. 4/5

2)Soru chakli: a thin rice pancake. lacked salt as well as seasoning.Very bland on its own.3/5

3)Red rice: disappointing to say the least.Expected some variety of wild rice/parboiled rice and some exotic flavours at least.Turned out to be ordinary rice coloured with food colouring and flavoured with predominantly whole garam masala.2/5

4)Julu pitha: staffed bread, shaped a bit like the tibetan Tai-po,ie, a steamed bun stuffed bit boiled egg and mince.A bit bland, but not bad.3/5

5) Lal Gosht :a type of shammi kebab shaped mince patties. very very dry. didnot like it much.2.5/5

6)Korri gassi : chicken in a coriander based gravy. very tasty. 4/5

7)Smoked Squid: an absolute delight.Smoky, saucy with a hint of lemon grass...its orgasmic.5/5

8)coco lime crab: again....a bliss on the tastebuds.5/5

verdict: The next time I am there, it would be only seafoods for me

We had also ordered smoked octopus which tasted pretty good.Santa's fantasea provides an impressive array of seafood platters. Overall it was a worthwhile visit .

Small space,good tribal decorations . welcome drink tasted good to me.
Bamboo chicken and mutton was average.
Sea food items were really good,I loved octopus;) fried rice was good in quality but they provided 2 fried rice in 1 bowl , that was  really less in quantity!
Service ,a bit quicker ,would be better!
 food quality was superb,anyway!
Would recommend to have some tribal & sea food dish! :)

The reviews and ratings of this place over here in zomato made me expect too much out of this place it seems. Ambience - complete tribal feeling.. Even the EDC machine was out of service adding to the tribal ambience. I had Kerala Chicken Stew, Sticky Rice and Bansa Pora Chicken. Chicken Stew was the only part of my meal that I liked (4/5). The chicken preparation was half cooked, and the rice made me feel depressed. The rice preparation had a seed like spice (like bitter guard seeds), which was making me hate it more. 
About the service now, I also ordered for a Crab momo, which the waiter was to check and revert back on its availability.. But he never came back throughout the time I was there. Well I could have asked the floor manager but the rest of the preparations were so depressing I didn't dare to. 
Maybe my choice of food was real bad then, will visit once more to try seafood. Hope then I get some better experience.

After reading much about the restaurant, decided on visiting it.
The place is quite small, so if you go during the peak hours, be prepared to wait on the road in front of the Restaurant as there is no waiting lobby.
We had to wait for 30 mins before we got in.
As for the decor, The Tribal section looked considerably better than the sea food section.
We ordered Bansha Pora Mutton, Soru Chakli, Sea Food Beijing Noodles and Smoked Crab. We left the octopus and squid out for now.
The Bansha Pora Mutton tasted awesome with the simple Soru Chakli.
Sea Food Beijing Noodles wasn't anything extraordinary. The Crab was tasty and nicely cooked.
We also wanted to try some Momos but it wasn't available at that time.
Overall, it can be said that the Tribal Section is much better than the Sea Food section.

Now the food..its was lip smacking.. the bansh pora chkn..the smell and the taste never had anything like that before, also ordered shanghai fish- very spicy and very tasty , smoked prawn- took good and Malaysian seafood rice- authentic Malaysian rice.. also got a complimentary drink (quite nice) .. and to my surprise ..NO EXTRA TAX.. now this is something that u ll find rarely in any good joint around Kolkata.. rounding up each and everything .. I loved completely .. from the food to the staffs .. no doubt its gaining so much popularity .. Santa's fantasea keep up the good work :) :)

Got to know about this restaurant from zomato,  and after seeing the tribal delicacies and seafoods they are serving, we have decided to go there on last weekend to try some of their delicacies . And, afterwards, we understand that it was a great decision that we have taken. As a welcome drink, they have served tankha turani which was unique in taste but very light. On starter, we have ordered, shanghai squid (tangy &  crispy outside, juicy inside.... A must try), oyster chilly basil octopus & smoked fish., both are very niceky cooked and unique in it's taste.  In the main course, we have tried tribal dishes. We ordered julu pitha(tribal bread stuffed with chicken kima), bansa pora mutton ( a must try for them who has craving for red meat)  accompanied with saru chakli, and atlast jadoh rice... which is a cobination of red rice with mutton pieces...mouth watering in taste and  the type of rice is very different than usual. Above all, staffs are very well behaved and mannered and on top of it,  serving time is very fast. Overall it's an amazing and satisfying experience and will be there again soon.

The only thing to give this one a thumps up is for their thematic pulchritude; moreover you are bound to get baffled with a sudden complementary. Some of the dishes are really very good. I recommend that if you are a sea-food lover or wanna taste something new then this is the place.

This place surely deserves a second visit..The ambience decor and staff service is very good. You would be welcomed by a complimentary odisha drink Tanka turani..quite different but tastes good..We had ordered for their famous Banshpora mutton and along with it Wild Red rice, Gnatok and Smoked fish..The food is really yum..Unfortunately, we couldn't try out their crab momos which is another of their specialty that they serve..Looking forward to try out crab momos, arsu chhum and jula pitha in my next visit..Tried out Tilhou kheer(piyajer paayesh) on their recommendation and unexpectedly I liked it..No wonder now I understand why this place became the most searched in Zomato..Santa's Fantasea - you made my Sunday lunch special üòá

Read this..  i have the most honest review for you. Dishes i tried

1. Basha pora chicken
2. Shoru chakli
3.  Tribal red rice
4.  Jhumpu pishis mutton
5. Tankha turani - welcome drink

My opinion - very very averae food. Below average in some parts. 

1st basha pora chk/mutton is a dry dish. It has a overwhelming smell of bamboo in it and it's a love it or hate it or hate it taste. Honestly it did not seem to be tandoored rather burnt on lpg fire coz you can smell the lpg thing in it. Besides the bamboo smell, the chk did not have a taste of itself or its masala. 

2. Shoru chakli (pancake/ roti) was served cold and mushy. Very bland in taste especially when cold.

3. Jhumpu pishis mutton - quiet a general homemade mutton,  which does not taste exotic my any means. 

4. Tribal red rice - wasn't red rice at all,  just a thick quality rice tossed up qith onion and chilis

5. Thanka turani - served in a bamboo made glass..  the glass handles were wet and seemed it was not washed properly.  The drink warm,  wish it was cold.. would have been a great one. 

On top of all this,  there was no ice for your water in the restaurant, waiters are unprofessional and you can hear them yell and use profanity in the kitchen area.  They give you a hand written bill which is not acceptable. I wonder where my tax goes. The was basin area just near the kitchen was a heap of filth. Stagnant water,  stale food,  unwashed dishes and wet muddy floor was very unwelcoming. Somewhere i don't want to go ever again!!!

Coastal and Tribal cuisine at real affordable price these days isn't a myth, thanks to food joints like Santa's Fantasea. Kolkata foodies always love experimenting and when it came to sea-food items like squid, octopus or lobster it was no exception. This small place has got huge popularity these days and is a must-visit for all seafood lovers.

LOCATION ----- It is located quite close to Golpark, you need to take the left from Anjali Jewelers and then walk for a minute till you find this place on your left. Also you can park our car close to the eatery, that shouldn't be an issue. The restaurant is basically ground floor of one typical south Kolkata residential building and so it is there located in a proper residential area.

AMBIANCE ----- You will feel the place is pretty small when measured in terms of its popularity. The demand is rising everyday and the supply is striving hard to cope up with that. Unless the sitting capacity is increased the huge waiting times won't get reduced and the customer satisfaction index won't rise. Yes, you need to wait atleast 30 to 45 minutes before you get seated and then maybe 30 minutes before your food is served, this happens mainly during proper dinner or lunch hours mostly during weekends. We were incredibly lucky to get seated the moment we were in, since we were two and a table-for-two just got emptied the moment we were there, but our order was taken after 5-7 minutes and our ordered food items were served after about 35-40 minutes. We were seated in the seafood themed room that is right in front, there is another room that has got an interior decor having the tribal theme, the room with tribal theme looked tad better to me, it's somehow close to reality. The overall ambiance is nice with all those seafood and tribal decors in place, though I would say the decor and the property is overall quite humble and cramped up. It has got no acoustics treatment or heavy curtains so the place is quite noisy when it's full. Not suitable for private dinners or meals. Also the tables are small, table-for-two is too small for two people, in general they serve most of the food items together and since we ordered quite a few items it was one real mess placing all those items in that super small table, though the thematic table-chairs looked pretty cool and I personally liked their finish and looks.

FOOD ----- Here are the items we had at this place:

a) Tankha Turani: This is one complementary tribal welcome drink that is served to all, it is basically one fermented rice drink and served in beautiful wooden/bamboo carved mugs. The drink is quite refreshing and sets you up for the meal, and yes it is definitely out-of-the-box and serving it as complementary drink is one nice gesture.

b) Bansa Pora Mutton: After Tankha Turani we decided to go for another tribal food item from Odisha. This dish is deservingly very popular and it would be a crime if you leave this place without tasting this item. This is one of the best mutton preparations I have had so far, the smokiness in there is so intoxicating. It has got well marinated mutton tightly stuffed in a bamboo and cooked in tandoor. The mutton is scraped from the bamboo straight to your plates and the amazing marination and strong smoky aroma is sure to win your heart. I would rate this dish 5 out of 5, one real STAR dish.

c) Fried Pepper Mackerel: I really liked this fried fish item, I had never tasted mackerel before and was a bit skeptical, but then I found it really nice and the preparation was good as well.

d) Shanghai Squid: We basically ordered this dish as a starter. This was one item which I didn't like that much, maybe because I have had much better squid preparations before outside India. It tasted quite close to crispy chilli babycorn :) I don't like my squid fried to this extent on such high flames.

e) Smoked Octopus: Really loved every nibble of this dish! This was another STAR dish and everyone should try this out once. The whole octopuses in there were so perfect, chewy and having a lovely texture, the spicy gravy in there was complementing the octopus and together they made one perfect side dish.

f) Seafood Malaysian Rice: We were served Seafood malaysian Rice Noodles instead of Seafood Malaysian Rice, though the order slip clearly read Rice and not Rice noodles. Anyway, the awesome taste and texture of the dish eclipsed all these misunderstandings. The fried rice had all possible seafood items in there, like prawn, squid, etc. Also loved the lightly tossed onion and capsicum pieces, the overall taste of the dish will surely make you super satisfied. One plate of this rice serves two.

SERVICE ----- No doubt the guys serving our food were courteous and friendly. There were few confusions and long wait times as mentioned above but overall it was one nice experience. Also these days they accept only cash, so please keep that in mind.

OVERALL ----- Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.9/5
Food quality: 4.6/5
Food presentation: 3.8/5
Value for money: 4.8/5
Service: 3.7/5

As you know, the menucard has numerous options and I have only tried a few. So there are more amazing surprises waiting for me, and I am sure to try out other items as well, maybe next time I will try more of those tribal cuisines. So if you want to try out these unique course of coastal and tribal cuisine right here in Kolkata then this is the place to be, their uniform standards of quality and culinary innovations are sure to amaze you and bring you back for more!

Cheers!

New foods to explore. Okay in taste. Good ambience. But place is limited. Red Rice is not recommended. Squids and fish starters are quite good.

Few restaurants surpass all your expectations and emerge to become a legendary restaurant. Santa's Fantasea is right up there. And this is evident from the high ratings and rave reviews that this little restaurant has earned. Go there on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and be prepared to wait for atleast 45-60 minutes; such is the popularity that this restaurant has garnered. 
I went there last Sunday with a friend. First up, the bad bits: we had to wait for almost 1.15 hours to get a table for two. The servers wnt allow two people to occupy a three or four seater. That's why, we ended up waiting for a table even though bugger groups came in later and got their tables faster. 
Now coming to the interiors. It's delightfully done with wall hangings, frescos, etc. The menu boasts of tribal and seafood. We were only interested in sampling the tribal fare. Hence, we ordered for #kori gassi, #wild red rice, #julu pitha and #banshe pora mutton.
We were served complimentary #tankha turani, which is a drink made from rice bran (most probably, if I understood correctly) and seasoned with roasted black peppercorns (most probably). The wild red rice was like normal fried rice. Though it was supposed to be spicy, I felt it wasn't quite spicy. The kori gassi was a delight. It was a coriander flavoured gravy, mildly spicy and absolutely tasty. The julu pitha is basically a stuffed bread with minced chicken. It was too dey for my liking. The almost legendary banshe pora mutton was absolutely stunning. Boneless mutton cubes mixed with spices and done in a tandoor. It had the right amount of smokiness which made the dish an amazing one. In fact, I will say it's one of the best forms of mutton that I have had. 
We ended our meal with a #Tilhou kheer which basically kheer made with onions. Not many people would praise this one, but trust me, thus is probably the best preparation available here. For me, it was the show-stopper. I dnt really have words to explain or describe how heavenly this kheer felt. Try it once and you be going back every time just to have this kheer. 
The prices are very economical and wnt dent your pocket. I wish they expand and have more dining space, because this arduous wait really gets frustrating. 
Second review: I visited Santas Fantasea a second time and boy, this place is full of surprises. This time we ordered a Shanghai squid, chicken arsa chum, patra pora mutton and wild red rice. The squid was spicy, crispy. It wasn't chewy like I had at some other places and that's why I enjoyed the squid. Arsa chum is a coconut flavoured gravy with jalape√±os, but I still like the Kori gassi more. Finally, patra pora is another gem. It's as good as banshe pora, if not more. Succulent boneless mutton pieces, marinated with mustard paste and smoked in a banana leaf...it tasted out of this world. Sadly, the kheer wasn't available.

Santa's Fantasea is located in the lane just adjacent to the Golpark branch of Anjali Jewellers. Although it may seem to be a little obscure, it is easily traceable on Google Maps. My friend and I had gone there for lunch today. We were shown a table for two which was comfortable for us. From the outside it doea look as if we are entering somebody's house, but the ambience is fairly pleasing. Keeping with the name, they have underwater scenery painted on the walls. 
Coming to the food now. As soon as we were seated the waiter served us our welcome drink. I don't know what it is called, but I found it very interesting. My friend was not very comfortable with the taste of curry leaves in the drink so she decided to give it a miss after a sip. We had ordered baansh pora mutton, shoru chaakli ar julu pithe. The food was very tasty and the portions were just sufficient for two people. 
The servers were very helpful who also suggested us what to order. My friend required to charge her phone and they were very helpful regarding that, offering her the phone everytime she needed it to click a photograph etc. Overall it was a very nice experience. I'll surely be going back for more.

Seeing the hype..the fb posts..the check ins..the raving zomato reviews..couldnot help myself than making an unplanned visit to the place.My partner was allergic to seafood ( chose a wrong partner in this case) and hence confined our meal to their tribal menu..and we BANSA PORA ,SORU CHAKLI, BAKED FISH , WILD RED RICE, JHUPU PISHIR MUTTON CURRY, PIYAJER PAYESH(forgot the tribal name for it). From the complimentary odishya drink to the dessert..everything was a treat. The santa's fantasea experience is incomplete without the duo of bansa pora with soru chakli.However i felt the portion was too less for the price. The rice was unusually good and went well with the jhupu pishir mutton..which was delicetely soft with the meat falling smoothly from the bone and had an amazingly tasty gravy.i recommend this mutton dish and the Baked fish which with dollops of mayo,white sauce and cheese was melting in the mouth. The dessert was also a new thing we tasted and was awesome it was.
Next time will surely try out their seafood section.

And there the next time..within a week..i tried their SHANGHAI SQUID, CRACK LEAVES CHICKEN ,SMOKED OCTOPUS , BURNT CHILLI PRAWN , SEAFOOD MALAYSIAN NOODLES , SEA FOOD BEIJING RICE , PRAWN KHEER.

This lot was just good. The squid preparation was excellent followed by the rice..the chicken dish looked unique due to the caramelized spinach garnish and was tasty too. I lked the onion kheer over prawn. The prawn was decent and did not really like the octopus

A paradise for seafood lovers.. The food is amazing and it is easy on your pocket. We went during the puja season a lot and even during such rush, the food quality and taste remained great..We were given a complimentary rice drink with our food. Their bansha pora is probably the most wanted food in their kitchen.

Got there seeing 4.7 rating in Zomato. Unfortunately didn't find the experience worthy of even 3.0, rated it 3 just bcoz i haven't tasted the seafood section yet. Went with one of my foodie friend for lunch. Not much to say about the ambience as the place is small and a bit clumsy. They served the complimentary tankha turani drink. Found it totally tasteless except a bit salty. Then we ordered their signature dish Bansha pora mutton, julu pitha, shoru chakli and kori gassi (a chicken dish on their suggestion). About the dishes, bansha pora taste was good, mutton was tender and delicious too. But the amount was really really less in terms of price (Rs 350).. It was not even enough for 2 of us. And strangely they don't even keep the bamboo on the table to bring a charm to the food! They just served the mutton and took it away! Both the roti/bread namely, julu pitha and shoru chakli were pretty tasteless themselves. The chicken side dish kori grassi tasted good though once again amount was too little. Only thing thats saves the day is they don't charge any tax ;-) Would try to visit once again for their seafood section specially to taste the crab meat momo and octopus. I am not sure why they even keep the momos in their menu as they never seem to be able deliver it. In short, found this place far too over rated in Zomato in terms of everything, ambience, food quality, food quantity and corresponding price. Maybe just because they serve unique food..

I have visited the place in one of my friends birthday. Believe me, you will not even imagine what is Inside that small door. The first thing which attracted me was the decoration. The place has two rooms with small accommodation but each and every wall of each room were decorated with either tribal art or other fantastic forms of decoration. The manager and the stuffs were very friendly. They welcome our group with a very nice welcome drink (tanka turani was finished by then). We had mixed seafood rice,bansha pora,smoked octopus,and two other dishes of chicken which I cannot remember right now. As per expectations the seafoods were just great, specially the smoked octopus. I have never tasted so fresh and so delicately cooked octopus dish before. But the best was bansa pora.The aroma of smoked clay and the semi burned bamboo mixed with small pieces of mutton was a heavenly experience. I would like to visit the place again.

I had been here last Puja. It was three of us and bored of the usual Chinese and north indian, we decided to try something new and Voil√†! We were at the perfect place. Needless to say, the bansa pora was the Best. We had ordered smoked squid, fish in green sauce, seafood flat noodles, chicken in white sauce. All of them were cooked to perfection and had an amazing flavour. Something that cannot ve found in every other restaurant. The  ambience and d√©cor was an add on for us. For all foodies who prefer to give their gastronomical senses a different twist, this place is highly recommended. Plus the price is an absolute value for your money.

Very cozy interiors with innovative decor. First time in Kolkata which provides such a variety of seafood. One can choose from a large platter of squid, octopus, crab, prawn, mackerel, tuna along with conventional dishes of chicken and mutton but with an interesting twist which will tease your taste buds. Smoked octopus, bansh pora mutton are a must-try...

If you are seeking out for a different kind of cuisine other than Chinese and continental ones, then this is your destination. 
Santa's Fantasea offers an exotic range of delicious platters be it tribal or seafood. And not to forget the complimentary drink they serve. 
Two dishes that have won my heart are mutton banshapora and jhupupishir kosha mangsho. 
Ambience is equally impressive. And prices are reasonable as well..

I Just Love food of this place.Within last month after I got my first stripend money, visited this place for 4 times with my family, school friends, college friends & family friends.
‚ñ† FOOD IS REALLY DELICIOUS,AN ONE OF THE UNIQUE IN KOLKATA...
It servers wide ranges of both Indian tribal and Sea food.
I actually never had Sea food of this place so can't tell anything about it.
But I've tried 60% of all the tribal food recipes and it's just OUTSTANDING !!!
I'm going to recommend everyone to visit this place and should have (must try) _
1."Bans Pora (chicken/mutton)"- as the name suggests it is made by stuffing spiced up meat inside Bamboo...it has got unique smoky flavour.I personally loved the mutton counter part of this dish.
2.Potro Pora Mutton- spiced up mutton wrapped with Banana leaf.
3.Kori Gassi Chicken- green gravy made up with corriander leaf & chopped garlic.
4.Wild Red Rice(spicy, Veg) - It's basically Unpolished spicy garlic fried red rice.Goes extremely good with Potro Pora Mutton.
5.Chakli roti- It has got a very blant flavour...it helps you to have all the flavours of the side dish you have.
Goes extremely good with Bans Pora & Potro Pora.I also liked it in combination with Kori gassi Chicken.
6. Lal gosht - meat ball...recommend you as the best starter.
7. Julu Pitha- bread stuffed with chicken & egg.

‚ñ† Easily can accomodate approx 30-35 peaople...If you wanna have lunch come early by 12:30 PM to get table for your friends because this place got popular within a very short time.
‚ñ† Nice Interior
‚ñ† Good Waiter service
‚ñ† VERY REASONABLE PRICE...if you go with your friends (4-5 people)...it's gonna cost you around 950-1100/-Rs.So pocket pinch for one is around 250/-.

If they maintain their quality of food, don't increase prices soon...this place gonna be a FOOD LANDMARK IN KOLKATA.

This is restaurant had some interesting decor.
The different dishes tasted distinctly different from other area "fusion"restaurants. All food was served piping hot and the staff were pleasant. I liked that the owner came and asked how the meal was.

~Welcome drink, some kind of jal jeera.. been better it is was cooler.
~ Crispy fried prawns, a must try.
~ Bansh pora mangho, a so so dish not smoky enough..Quantity awfully small.
~ Malaysian rice , green and delicious.
~ Seafood Salad, w/ mayo but the grains of sugar hadn't gotten mixed evenly.

If one is ready to try something different.. its worth a shot... but just a FYI portions are quite small.

I had visited the place couple of weeks back with one of my friend.Its a small joint located just inside the lane beside the anjali jewellers showroom near golpark.it was my frst visit and i found the ambience and decor to be quite nyc and simple.as we took our seat we were offered a welcome drink named tankha turani (drink from odhisha) .it was tasty.although it was a welcome drink, it was refilled later on request from us.we ordered bansh pora mutton  and a squid dish as starters.both were fantastic.spcly the squid dish as it was the frst tym I tasted squid n  I loved it.next to follow was sea food topped ryc noodles , smoked octopus and wine tuna.ryc noodles was fantastic again.smoked octupus was good although I tasted it very little.wine tuna was dissappointing compared to other dishes.overall it was a nyc experience.we had ordered 5 dishes n bill was around 1100.

The rating scale on Zomato should be stretched to "INFINITE",because,there happen to be some eateries,that surpass all measures,scalings and ratings of expectations..and yes,needless to mention,Santa's Fantasea is one such novelty...I seriously dunno,where to begin with,the beautiful tranquil ambiance??the friendly staff?the out of the world food?(sigh)

My bff decided to give me a gala treat post Graduation...and knowing to the core,the devil of a foodie in me,he decided to give this place a try...

To be honest,the very entrance door made me cringe...because it gave the very impression of a crammed up space inside...but once I stepped in...all my apprehensions,became evanescent...

there is something in the air of this place,its ever beckoning...may be its the tranquility,which sharply contrasts with the cacophony of the Golpark Crossing outside..

Now the food,

as soon as we sat at our table we were offered,two beautiful bamboo carved mugs of Tankha Turani(a tribal rice fermented drink),and as we sipped from our mugs,browsing through the bill of fare,i couldn't help but gasp at the variety of various dishes assembled out there...one of a kind,i must admit..

For starters,we settled with Shanghai Squid.This was my very first tryst with molluscs..and I never wouldve believed that they could taste this good,had it not been for this awesome preparation...the quantity being just appropriate...

next we went for the most celebrated dish this eatery offers,that is,Mutton Bansh Pora (succulent pieces of mutton barbequed and served in a piece of burning bamboo)
 and also ordered Soru Chakli(pancakes made of rice flour) as an accompaniment...I have never had such a beautifully cooked and presented mutton preparation before...it made me drool,to the core...
The visit to this eatery was a whole new experience in itself...I don't know whom i should be thanking enough..my bff for bringing me hither or the proprietor who curated such beautiful dishes..or the people behind the counter,who cooked up magic...
or zomato,for hunting down such eateries like this??
now before i begin my thanking spree,
i guess i should decide what i will be ordering next time...
Coming soon ;)

Satisfied but not overwhelmed as heard from many. The bansh pora is not something extra ordinary. Crab was delicious. If you want to change your taste, it is the destination.

After reading lots of reviews and their growing popularity I was trying to visit the joint for a long time. Today I got time to visit the place for dinner. I have ordered for their speciality dish for which it has earned fame in the city the famous " Bansh Pora Chicken a dish originated in Odisha, Ngatok along with Wild Red Rice and to finish with Tilhou Kheer.
The food portion and the quality is really good all the food item was new to me and I really enjoyed the taste, the aroma of the Bamboo was there in the Bansh Pora Chicken and the spiciness of the Fish in Ngatok kept on lingering in mouth for a long time. But among the lot I really enjoyed the dessert "Tilhou Kheer" an onion kheer which was just excellent. I give full marks for that. Ambiance wise the restaurant is small size having a tribal d√©cor. My recommendation is try at least once it will give our taste buds a new experience away from the daily mughlai and chinese foods.

Hidden in a small lane in golpark , its a small flat turned to restraunt. Its a smaal place with basic decor of tribal theme. Food has lots of variety and some food is really good. Service is okay. There is a sea food stench though. Fishes like kingfish and bhetki are ice stored once and are not fresh.

My review might come as a surprise to many - because I did not found the food OK but not "Awesome", "fantastic" or "great".
We had baansh pora maansho - I truly speaking it was not so great. I had the oppurtunity to taste this multiple times in Odisha in places like Bubhaneswar and Jajpur and the one here in this Kolkata restaurant failed to match them. One can argue that this is normal as this is not Odisha - but if you serving baansh pora maansho - it should taste like one. The mutton quality and tenderness was OK but I found problem with the taste - somehow I suspect they have used the same baansh multiple times during preparation. Fish Ngatok was OK but again not wow type.

This my 4th visit in this restaurant!! They have completely changed the menu but kept the same signature complementary rice drink!! Though I have never liked the drink but the food has become better!! We ordered squid, chicken, prawns, red rice etc! I missed the coconut milk baked prawns, but they have replaced that with better spicy dishes! Bansh pora chicken is an add on!! :D
For me, it is one of the best places to have that special Sunday brunch üòäüòç

This is a small restaurant that gets over crowded in the weekends and holidays and we were unfortunate enough to witness that! Anyway after a 1.10 hour long wait we finally got ourselves a table and then it took almost 15mins for someone to come and take our orders (just imagine my hunger)
The bansh pora mutton is the best seller in here, though i feel differently about it. Except the fact that it is cooked and served on a bamboo stick nothing else is extraordinary about it (offcourse it is my perception) also i am not a shoru chakli person which is the only option to have the mutton with! The under estimated dish according to me is the malaysian rice which is probably the best rice i ever had and 1 extra marks for that! Then again the smoked prawns we ordered were pretty good but the smoked flavour was missing to the extent that i even doubt whether it really was smoked prawns. The stuffed pitha had an innovative touch to it. And I am really sorry but i was literally freaked out about the inclusion of prawns/onions in my dessert. If you are experimental enough give it a try.. All in all i might come back to this place but never on a holiday!

This place mainly serves sea food and tribal food. And boy! What taste. The golden fried squid (this name might be wrong, ask the owner for the right name) was crispy and delicious. Banshpora and patrapora mutton are a must. There is a free welcome drink which has a unique taste. Price is so reasonable. Service is good. One problem is they don't accept cards.

I do not understand why the name refers to Santa or even if it does, we are not sure Santa has a fantasy about seafood in the frozen Nordic tundra. The bewilderment drives us to visit this tiny speck of unusual space right off Golpark.On arrival, we realize, that the name does not do justice to half the concept on offer -it has an ethnic, tribal tune to it as well. And also, it is a sister concern of a garagemakeover serving seafood specialities called Ecstasea.
At the Entrance u can see Masks, thatched hay doorways, bright tribal face mural on the wall and a bit uncomfortable yet stylish rustic wooden-slat furniture com prises the interiors. A com plimentary tankha turani served in bam boo mug as welcome drink.over all I liked that decorations quite unique.
Disappointment comes big, as most of the fish selection is unavailable due to delayed arrival of fresh stock. We decide to enlighten ourselves with the tribal fare. Kerala mutton soup,bansa pora julu pitha and famous Meghalayan jadoh, from the northeastern states. For starters, we also order Shanghai squid.
Bamboo roasted mutton bhuna/ bansa pora was mind blowing with smokey flavour pair of julu paratha .
#No dessert available

After having heard a lot about this place, finally got the opportunity to go to this place today. It's a small place n when we reached around 1:30, it was full and so we had to wait for a while.
Once seated, we were greeted with their complimentary welcome drink, which was a tad bit spicy, but we loved its taste. We ordered the banshpora mutton, Julu pitha, butter garlic squid and wine chili mackarel. Service was very prompt n we got the dishes within minutes of ordering.
The banshpora mutton was delicious. The charred taste was just right and we loved it.
The Julu pitha was okay. I feel the covering could have been slightly thinner in comparison to the stuffing. But the taste was good.
The butter garlic squid was also great. The squid was cooked to the appropriate amount.
The mackarel however was slightly undercooked in some bits. It has room for improvement.
Overall, however it was an enjoyable experience on a rainy afternoon. And I would recommend the banshpora mutton for everyone who visits this place. :)

Excellent quality and taste of food. We ordered Banshe Pora Mutton, Ngatok, jhupu Pishi mutton, Mizo red rice, smoked crab. I am not a great fish eater as I am too sensitive to its smell and bones. However Ngatok just blew me away. It's a terrific preparation- one of the best fish dish I ever had. Banshe Pora mutton is a unique preparation and an awesome one. Jhupu Pishi mutton and Mizo red rice is great in taste but not unique like previous two. Smoked crab is just standard. Not to mention the tribal drink which is another unique aspect.  Also it is not expensive in comparison to other restaurants having same quality of food.
Parking is a problem. Seating capacity is too low leading to long waiting times. But the service is very prompt. Very courteous host. Decor is terrific.Not sure whether it's real 'tribal' or a marketing strategy. But whatever it may be , overall it's an excellent restaurant and worth giving a try.

Fantastic tribal and sea food! Located at a very prominent place like Gol Park in south Calcutta this place blew my mind every time I visited this place. The staff is extremely helpful, there is quite a variety in the menu. The interior... umm the first room is decked up like an underwater place.. looks a little silly...however the tribal section is impressive. Coming to food..which begins with a typical welcome drink is a delight. Banshpora Mutton is the shiz, when it comes to the dishes. MUST VISIT for every food lover. :)

Well, finally been here today, ordered crab momo which we did not get, so tried prawn momo in stead. It was ok ok type. Then we had canton type rice noodles with honey chili squid. The noodles was tasty, good but the squid had a very strong flavour of fish sauce so 2 or 3 squid we left out, the gravy was good though sweet n a little spicy. I became so full that we could not make it for the bansh pora mangso... :(
The complimentary drink was good too and the dessert made of onion is simply a stunner...
And of course the service is good too...

Being a sea food lover I wanted to visit this place for a long time .I visited this place which is of high reputation over here in zomato...
Decor was quite unique and had two get up..one room had a sea bed decor while the other room had tribal set up.

Speaking of food we ordered the iconic dish banspora which was amazing and definitely lived up to its potential.. we also ordered squid fry and another squid item and were well cooked and tasty... to my great surprise all the dishes were really cheap except for the banspora which is understandable considering its fame..the special rooti we ordered was a flavoured rumali roti type ..the mixed seafood noodles was good As well.
The only regret was that no octopus dishes were available..
The staff is friendly and helpful ..
Looking forward to visit this place very soon

Atlast I managed to be here after long wait. After reading all the comments nd reviews of my fellow foodies, I was highly excited to try out this restaurant... Nd I must say they have made quite a goodwill as we had to wait fr more than an hour to get a table during lunch hours (m not sure about weekdays) . Try to go in a group as they have seat arrangements fr family or bigger groups... There is only a single table fr a couple ... So the wait bcomes a ltl longer. 
Well 1st the ambience.. The place is small bt nicely decorated which goes along with their tribal theme.. Nothing to catch ur eye. 
The staffs are very well behaved nd wll greet u with a smiling face. They have good knowledge abt their food so u cld ask them to suggest u food according to ur mood nd trust me u wont be disappointed. Well the owner will be there to assist nd take ur order as well nd he is really a gentleman. 
The moment u managed to get a table nd take ur seat u wl be served their complimentary drink. It varies .. This time it was some sabu Dana drink I wish I avoided tht stuff... 
We ordered shanghai squid fr starter nd it was fantastic ... It was crispy nd spicy nd its a must try. Fr the main course we ordered Malaysian mixed rice which is smwt green in colour bt not bad actually.... Nd my fvrt smoked fish. Wow its was just amazing. Though it tasted more like pan fried schezwan bt it was really worth it. Nd last bt not the least.. Chingri payesh...  it was simply amazing. If u have it u cld identify its taste similar to our very own pithe.. I mean the gravy one.. They just added chingri nd made chingri payesh. It was really worth a try. 
Bt I was a little disappointed with their quantity .. It's decreasing with their increasing popularity. 
Conclusion - I am eagerly waiting to visit again üòÅ

Visited the place today. It's a small place with great decor. Bit packed up n only two tables of two. We had the baansh pora mutton with their version of "ruti" which were more like pancakes. The mutton was superbly tender n had the hint of wooden smokiness from the bamboo. It was delicious. However i dint really like the "roti". But it dint matter much to me. I wud heartily recommend this place for the food, if nothing else.

This place was bookmarked from quiet a long time and atlast got a chance to finally visit this place . It is situated in golpark in a lane beside Anjali Jewellers, very easy to find. Thaugh from outside it looks very simple and small but from inside it's quiet big and decorated as tribal theme with tribal masks and hays. The chairs are of curved wood which adds to the decor. We were welcomed by a complementary rice drink Tankha Turani. We ordered # Bansh pora chicken which and is chicken served in burning bamboo #Ngatok which is a fish served in banana leaf cooked in nagaland style. For main course we ordered # Malaysian Seafood Noodles with # Shanghai Octopus. The combi was yummy .In the noodles there were prawns , tuna and squids. And octopus experience in the first time is good. They have a lot of variety of seafood. Seafood lovers should definitely make it a point to visit this place.

I am always a bit speculative when ever I visit a restaurant which has ¬†a rating above 4.5 and does not fall under the category of fine dining. Specially after the reviews and visiting Hanglatherium I have gone into this mode.

Rave ratings and reviews of Santa's Fantasea and I decided to visit this place. Located at Golpark take the lane beside Anjali jewelers and you will be able to see this place. First feeling while entering the restaurant, too cramped place. There are two rooms and the tables are arranged to accommodate 2, 4, and 6 people group in each room. Decoration is nice but not something as mind blowing. The tables and chairs are made up of bamboo and if you are planning to sit for more than an hour then by the end it will become a bit uncomfortable.

Coming to the food aspects, the opening was with Tankha Turani, which was nice made of rice water. The we ordered Bansh Pora Mutton, no doubt this was awesome and if you are meat lover don't miss this. The taste is really good.

Soru Chakli - I don't know why I ordered it, but whatever respect I had for this place for Bansh pora mutton had already gone after having this. The taste is worthless

It was time for the Sizling sea food soup and I would say that this is also worth to go for. The taste was really nice. Fried spring Pomfret was somewhat OK, in terms of the presentation and taste.¬†

On the main course I ordered, smoked crab, Shanghai Fish, and sea food canton noodles. I like crab a lot but some how I did not like the taste of the smoked crab. The sanghai fish taste was good and so was the taste of canton noodles.¬†

I was wondering how come this place gets such rave reviews, here are some pointers. The food is cheap and it attracts a lot of crowd from the nearby college and schools. Second the food is good and third there are no taxes which is kinda brilliant for the customers. They accept only on cash.¬†

There are however some of the things other than food which I just didn't like about this place.

1. The waiter is always not pleasant while taking the order. Even if you are thinking for 30 seconds he will show his discomfort to you.

2. The window's have clear glasses and the crowd out side always watches you what you are having and eagerly waiting when you will finish your food. Just not comfortable while having a nice dinner/lunch for me.

3. There is no waiting area for the guests and as result they will stand on the passage way of the first and second room and will eat you and your food by their eyes.¬†

#dontmiss - Bansh pora mutton.

Not so hard to locate this place. Near anjali jewellers. 3 of us went for dinner. This place is a small place. The place was crowded. We had to wait for around 10 min. Finally got table. Ambience was good. chair was of diff kind. water and the complementary drink was served in wooden glasses made out of bamboo.
¬†They served us a drink at first which was avg. Diff taste. After a bit of discussion we ordered Bansh Pora mutton in which mutton is cooked inside the bamboo and then cooked in tandoor, 1 jadoh which is a combination of red rice and mutton peices, 3 soru chakli ( also known as special roti), and ¬†kori gassi which is a chicken dish.
bansh pora mutton is something i nevr had before. Superb taste. A must try here. It tastsed great with the soru chakli.
Next was the jadoh with the kori gassi. The rice tasted great. Better than pulao.
The kori gassi was also very good. It had a green gravy. I would suggest people not to go with this combination. Red gravy would have tasted better. But still the kori gassi tasted great individually.
Total was 830/-. A must try place. I will visit agin for the sea food part.
The prices here are really as you expect...will ¬†go again.:)

Santa's Fantasea is one of those names you keep hearing from time to time when discussions on unique food in Kolkata are afoot. In a city where eating out still presents only a handful of options as far as cuisines go, this restaurant stands off as a beacon of individuality. Thus, finally succumbing very willingly to the peer pressure, we decided to give it a try this afternoon. 

The fact that the restaurant was nearly full on a weekday afternoon is a testament to its popularity. Luckily, a table for two was still empty and so, we managed to get seated fairly easily. 

They started off with giving us a complimentary tankha turani, this beverage made of rice water spiced with mustard seeds and tamarind. It was sour and spicy, and very refreshing. 

We ordered fried crab momos and Shanghai squid for appetisers. The momos were crispy and not very oily, although they did not taste much of crabs. The squid, which was recommended by the waiter, was spicy and cooked just right, making it juicy and not at all rubbery. 

For the entree, we ordered their speciality, bansa pora chicken (chicken burnt in bamboo) and jadoh (wild red rice with mutton). The jadoh had a wonderful aroma of spices and meat, reminiscent of, yet much more complex than, a biriyani. The rice itself tasted unfamiliar and nice, packed with flavours quite different from your everyday white rice. As for the chicken, there is a reason they are famous for it. It was absolutely soft, the meat very tender.¬†

The portions were quite large and we did not order any desserts as it was all we could do to move out of our seats after such a filling meal. A must for people who want to try out good seafood and tribal food in Kolkata. Also, do ask the waiters for suggestions on what to order if you cannot decide. They know the strengths of the menu quite well, are very friendly and always right on the mark.

One of the finest and distinctive tastes they have got I must say. The quality of food, staff, the tribal ambiance all account for the popularity of this restaurant in that area.

From octopus to squid to prawns to authentic tribal dishes.....this place serves it all....humble in setting but a giant when it comes to the taste; quality and variety.... If you are open to experimentation and have a thing for sea food......this is it.... 

I have experienced sea food in goa kovalam varkala in India and hikkadua in sri Lanka which I believe is far superior to the 3 places I mentioned......Santa's fantasea is right up there to joints in coastal sri Lanka and in most cases better!!!

Sundar, sasta and tikao.... it is one apt statement for this joint. Food was at its best at this place with low cost and great ambience. We reached here right at the nick of time just before the crowd started pouring in. They served us with their signature complimentary drink which was good in taste. Then as per the order they served us with the Fantasea seafood soup, which was a 2-in-1 soup with sweet n spicy taste. Followed by this was the Seafood Beijing Noodles and shanghai Squid, both of these tasted simply awesome. The Noodles was so much in quantity that it was almost difficult for us to finish. The Squid tasted really great. .. cooked to perfection. Great experience. I m waiting to go back again.
On my second visit we tasted tribal foods. We had Soru chakli and Bansh Pora mutton and it tasted yummmmmm.

A welcome change from regular cafes or Mughlai cuisine.
Santa's Fantasea is one of those places where you will have to scrutinize the menu for quite sometime to decide what to order because,I mean really,when was the last time you had so many new dishes to try,that too from different states? :D

After two visits,I have found my favourites though.
Crab momo in green sauce,mouth-watering it is.(it's sad that they dont serve it with the sauce anymore and therefore tastes pathetic.)
¬†And Jullu pitha which is basically chicken keema stuffed inside bread.
Smoked squid was delicious. So was the Cheesy tuna salad with fresh vegetables.
The highly popular Banshpora Mutton was okayish.
Didnt like the octopus,couldn't be chewed.
Seafood noodles are amazing.
The shanghai fish had the most delicious gravy.
The crab wasnt good. :|

Interiors are nicely done,in keeping with the tribal theme.One of the best places for comfortable,filling lunch at a reasonable price.

I have been to this tribal themed restaurant twice and both times it never failed to amaze me in terms of food as well as the ambience.
On my last visit we ordered Kori gassi, wild red rice, chicken bansa pora, pomfret in black pepper sauce and smoked fish.

The Kori gassi which is chicken cooked in garlic and coriander gravy was truly amazing . The chicken pieces were soft and juicy. The wild red rice and smoked fish deserve a special mention as these two were the best tasting dishes of the lot. The bansa pora chicken tasted good but the chicken could have been softer. The pomfret in black pepper sauce was okayish. All in all Santa's Fantasea is a really good restaurant which serves unique food at affordable prices .

A dud in the face. After reading high reviews landed up and my taste buds gt the chance to finally taste the rice drink. Like a Yash Raj movie the set, costume, & overall looks Santa's fantasea gt me on the boat. BUT the taste of the stuff. Yak. Over spiced, extra oily food was not for my appetite. Thus I left the movie halfway keeping only the chaler sorbot on my mind . I personally didn't like the worthless presentation where taste didn't matter. Gimmicks are not permanent.

It was the hottest day in Kolkata and Santa's fantasea was the nearest restaurant that we could find. The heat had squeezed out our appetite so at first we ordered only one dish. But the food was sooooo good that we kept on craving for more and more. Their signature dish is Bnasha pora.The presentation itself is brilliant. You must try korigashi as well.

This place is unique and different. With its Odissa palates it can be a treat or a disaster for one. Its Coming up well. still needs to explore and grow a lot. Very few options in the menu and one would like some description for each dish to be printed in the menu for the dishes are typically in the tribal language phonetically. Space is limited too so if you go with a very big group you may have to wait long.

Besides for those who like to experiment you won't regret trying.! good seafood.

At a first glance this place looks like a normal bengali foodplace so was sceptical initially.The interior is aptly designed suggestive of the cuisine it offers.The food is delicious...right from the complimentary tribal drink,the perfectly smoked banspora mutton,the juicy squid and smoked crab...everything was a delight to the palate.Definitely recommend it to sea food lovers.

Being a Bengali, Imma a great Foodie.... To me Santa's Fantasea is like exploring a Sea Beach where you will find Varieties of Sea Food as well as TRIBAL dishes.... One must come and Explore this great Beach..... Your journey will only be complete when you come and enjoy the Scenic Beauty...The Paintings and DECORATION is just marvellous ...The Servicing is also quite good...
The Photo I've posted here is of Smoked Octopus.... taste is very unique, I liked it.... only thing I dint Like here is that they gave too much Leaves in the Gravy which was irritating me..
One must come and Explore this Beach..

Santa's Fantasea is famous for their seafoods,located near Anjali jewellers, golpark.Fantasea is decorated in a such way that you actually feel you are under the sea level.Furnitures are made of bamboos but looks like very modernised. They will welcome you with a traditional drink serves in a bamboo glasses, it's quite amazing. 
In food,first,I have tried their coco lime soup.It was excellent and extraordinary. Then,I have also tried their Shanghai fish with sticky rice.I have never found fish so tasty and tantalising before this,rice was also enjoyable. But,the most appealing is Bansa Pora Mutton, which I have tried later in friend's recommendation.It was delicious, delightful and divine.Nice ambience. This one is highly recommended. Seafood lover can't give it a miss.

In search of heavenly seafood?? Tribal food?? Yes this is the place. It's near the anjali jewellers in golpark. The food was just too tasty, awesome, yummilicious. We had the fantasea special soup, seafood Malaysian noodles, Shanghai squid and the schezuan pepper octopus. A complimentary tribal drink was also served. I can't say which was better because all of them were fantabulous. Their preparation , their decor, their service,the ambience all were just too gud. The owner himself was present and he was very humble. Guys plz visit!! I will be visiting soon!!

Well... Visited this restaurant today with few of my friends. Fabulous would be less to say about this restaurant. Pretty fast and ordered service within the place. Location is good! Ambiance brings you the¬† feel of the cuisine style of tribes. 0. 5 deducted for: 1.¬† card service was not available and2.¬† Had to wait for 45 minutes to get into the restaurant. Trust me that proved to be worthy. Recommended items- bansh pora mutton and Shanghai squid. An unique item was their dessert:- chingrir payesh... Hmm, I know how u would imagine listening to this weird combo if you haven't tasted it yet but it really is an unique and tasty dessert. And most important point for my recommendation would be their pocket friendly item prices. It is a must try from my side!

This is one place which i keep on visiting and now i am recommending this to all other foodies of calcutta. There food is awesome and a plus point is there beautiful wallpapers. They have two section - seafood and tribal dish. Today, on a pleasant day, i went there with my sister and aunt-cum-sister for saturday brunch. After waiting for like 15 mins (as there was a good queue) we were given a place of 3. At first they offered us their usual complementary  special tribal drink TANKHA TURA . For food we quickly ordered their signature BANSHA PORA MUTTON (soft marinated cubes of mutton tasted superb) SHANGHAI SQUID (juicy and slightly spicy ) , SEAFOOD MALASIYAN NOODLES and CHILLY WINE OCTOPUS. Squid was mouthwatering and a must try. Noodles and octopus - nicely made and complement each other.

If you are very fond of seafood give this place a try. They serve a wide range of seafood and some unique in taste tribal food. Service is good and inside is nicely decorated with some tribal artwork. Bansh pora chicken or mutton is a must try. It has a smoky flavour and the chicken melts in your mouth. I have ordered smoked squid and malaysian sea food rice. The rice is very good to taste and so the squid. They serve food in a very handsome quantity and price of food will go easy on your pocket. One thing I didn't like, the inside area is very small and you have to wait for about 30 mins when all tables are full.

Tribal cuisine in Kolkata !! This excited me and dragged me to this wonderful place. It has two sections , one decorated with attributes of sea and the other replicates a typical tribal hut. I am impressed with the detailing of the tribal decor.
First we were offered a rice oriented drink which cannot be categorised as delicious but average. We ordered Kerelean mutton soup. The flavor was amazing. The combination of coconut milk, curry leaves, gandhoraj lemon with pieces of mutton; is worth praising. 
Mutton or chicken bansa pora... Chicken or mutton cooked inside bamboo ...yummy and the best!!
Jadoh.. Red rice with mutton pieces.. Good!
Overall a nice happy experience.. I shall go back to taste their Sea Food very soon.

Came to know about this place from Zomato and was very much excited to visit as I suddenly was craving for some sea food. So I finally visited the place with my friends and MAMMA MIAA!!! It was THE place I was destined to hook to forever! YES!
1) Good food
2) good quantity
3) affordable...
What more a REAL foodie wants! ?
I treated my friends here on my birthday and they all loved it (except those who don't favor sea food---*sad face*)
Now time for the harsh time--
1) it stinks DEADLY sometimes! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX ITTTTT!! (I beg u guys _/\_)
2) it doesn't have a proper toilet! yikes! what will you u do if its an EMERGENCY! :/
(Authority fix this too...please?)
3) most importantly they take CASH! (yes bring plenty of it, if u come here with frnds and generally carry only cards) :)

Edit,19th July 2015.

Well,I don't know if it's a rude trick of fate but just days after I write this fangirl review for Fantasea, I receive a jolting shock. When we went there for dinner last night, a number of things really bummed me off.

1. We had to wait for an hour. Their service is painfully slow, with only ONE waiter waiting on the tables and two other people taking orders. It's ridiculous how a place as popular as this can't hire a few more people for better service.

2. The cutlery smelled like fish and I had to call two different people to finally get them to change the glass.

3. The biggest shocker- they served rotten prawns. They smelled stale,and the moment my friend bit into one, he had to spit it out. What's worse is, when I wanted to talk to the manager/owner, he was conveniently absent.

I'm saddened by how once awesome places fall deplorably low,and to add to that, fail to take responsibility. I really really hope it was just a bad day for them,and they aren't really stupid enough to commit social suicide by degrading their standards.
                       ______________


Yes, definitely the new favourite in the city! I'd been to Fantasea the first time a couple of months back during Durg Puja, when they'd just started off, and just a few months down the line, they seem to have made incredible progress. The ambiance is comfortable, though not exceptional. The place is clean, and I love the complimentary drink. (The gesture more than the drink)

Now,the food. Although it branched off as a part of Ecstasea, which might be considered the pioneer of affordable seafood,etc- Fantasea has far surpassed it in variety and taste. Their baansh pora mutton is a must try- with its earthy savoury taste- it's unique. From the seafood section, the coco lime soup is delectable, as well as the momos. But I think what I like the best, the absolute best here, is the squid. You MUST,must try the Shanghai squid. It's tangy and spicy and crunchy-an absolute comfort food for your tummy. And the butter garlic squid. There's a party in my mouth just thinking about them.

The service is a little slow, and table reservations are recommended (had to turn back a couple of times thanks to the crowd) but Fantasea has successfully established itself as quite an unusual little restaurant at affordable prices. Here's hoping it stays the same!

Reading mostly positive reviews about this place landed me to their doorstep one hot summer afternoon with a friend. I wanted to personally see how a place can have two distinctly contrasting cuisine on the menu and do justice to them.
Location is fairly easy to locate.
The interiors are niche and colorful however the tribal influence overpowers the seafood theme.
Probably I ended up on a wrong day as none of Crab Meat, Tuna, Mackerel or Horse dishes were available. Even their card swiping machine was out of order.
They serve a complimentary welcome drink to all their visitors which as a concept I think is very welcoming and I feel other places should take a leaf out of their book for this since it does not pinch you much. We were served a drink closely resembling Jalzeera however not as salty. Honestly it wasn't as nice as the gesture itself. We ordered the much heard Bansha Pora, Soru Chakli, Baked Fish,A Medium Lobster in Black Pepper Sauce and Seafood Fried Rice.
The Bansa Pora turned out to be very impressive, the way they serve it sandwiched within a burnt bamboo. The burnt organic and spicy flavour of the dish and boneless mutton in fair quantity, a taste very different from oven cooked mutton will leave a mark on your taste buds. However if am to be very critical, the mutton was slightly undercooked.
The Baked Fish had a very distinct Lemon flavour and served in a Alluminium foil bowl, the ones commonly used to pack food. I found it a touch bland but my friend liked it though. Next came the Lobster, it was perfectly done. The minced cooked lobster meat served within the shell itself with the head and tail in a single plate. It was as much a visual treat as it was culinary.
The Seafood Fried Rice was okay with generous amounts of Squids in it. But I have had better.
One more thing which needs to be mentioned is the very competitive pricing of the dishes, however they have increased them recently.
The startup is nice and promising and I hope they can sustain it. Will visit again

a great restaurant for foodies who have a palate for experimentation. Not a big fan of the decor but absolutely loved the food. i tried the sea food and found it extra ordinarily fresh as compared to other restaurants in kolkata where the squid is usually rubbery and chewy it was so well cooked and so was the smoked octopus. absolutely loved the food there and it is good value for money. would recommend to take a little bit more care about hygiene and cleanliness. the staff is courteous and the owner was very helpful and friendly, really liked the place.

they will serve you with a traditional rice drink when you enter this place in bamboo glasses!!!!! it was really impressive!!!
then comes the food !!1
although i was a little disappointed to know that crab meat momo was not available at first but then the food just lifted up my mood!!!
we ordered shanghai prawn chilly pepper crab and bansh pora mutton!!
all the dishes were excellent but the bansh pora mutton was the best among the three!!!!!!!
the best part of all this is that this place is really cheap!!!!!
the only tinsy bit of a problem is that the service is bit delayed!!!! otherwise it's worth getting a five out of five!!!!!
if you are sea fod lover you just can't miss out on this place!!!!!

A great experience! One of the best sea food we've had in Calcutta. We ordered the Shanghai Crab and the Smoked Crab, out of which the Smoked Crab was definitely better. The Seafood Malaysian Rice was superb. We also had the Sticky Rice but were slightly surprised when it looked more like rice porridge rather than the usual sticky rice, it was good nonetheless. Coming from Mizoram, the sticky rice there is different from what they served. (Also, they have 'Voksa rep chhum' in the menu and description says it's mutton but 'voksa' means pork in the Mizo language, so pretty obvious they've made a mistake.) Oh, they also give complimentary Tankha Turani served in bamboo mugs.¬†
I would give value for money a 5/5, five girls with healthy appetites spent just 1000 here. :)¬†
A little warning here, the washroom is quite dirty!
But we would love to come back here.

Everybody knows their speciality bashpora mati pora zulu pitha etc but other dishes are also equally brilliant like baked fish, smoke fish, keong chicken etc. Crabs are also fresh every time they serves it. People who likes octopus and squid must try here. A "paisa wasool" place...

Fantastic is the word that comes to my mind when I think of this place. A seafood and tribal themed restaurant in the heart of golpark. The location is a bit tricky but if you take the lane beside anjali jewellers it's just a few metres away to your left.
We decided to drop in on a Sunday evening and unsurprisingly it was almost packed. There are two seating options available themed according to the cuisines this treasure trove has to offer.
On our arrival, we were greeted with a tribal drink of Orissa known as tanka turani. It had a hint of Indian spices and tasted pretty refreshing. For starters, we ordered Thai style seafood salad and for the main course we opted for smoked squid and red seafood rice noodles.
Coming back to the salad, it was among the very best I've ever tasted with an ample amount squid, shrimps and veggies. The balance was impeccable.
Moving on, the smoked squid was soft, succulent and delicious and the exotic herbs did well to complement it's flavours. The Rice noodles were as good and came loaded with shrimps and squid. The presentation was outstanding.
The portions are good enough to satisfy two hungry souls.
The pocket pinch was 430/- for all this which is more than reasonable in a city of over priced restaurants.
The ambience were notches higher than what you would come to expect. The staff were courteous although they tend to make you wait at times.
Would love to come back and try their fabled tribal cuisine as well, including their famous baansh pora. Happy eating.

We arrived at the ominous time of around 5pm and this place is not supposed to open before 6. So we what till the closed sign was overturned and finally grabbed our seats. This is a themed eating joint with two specific sections, one is the tribal section doned with green walls and tribal masks and murals while the other is the seafood section painted in hues of blue with paintings of sea creatures adorning the walls.
Now coming to the food...everything was fantastic. ..even the complimentary welcome drink...then the bash pora chicken...the chilli burnt prawn and chow chu chicken (I may have got the name wrong :p).
All the items we ordered were excellent and lip smacking.  The prices were so reasonable. 
I loved this place totally.

To begin with, extremely affordable prices and generous portions makes Santa's Fantasea an absolute delight for college goers! The tasteful d√©cor hits you first, with beautifully done paintings on the wall and quirky showpieces in both the tribal and seafood sections. The welcome drink tasted interesting, though I'd have personally preferred to not have the lemon bits floating on my drink! Me and my friend ordered the Thai Seafood Salad and their much popular Squid in Chilly Garlic Sauce, which both of us struggled to finish towards the end! The Salad had a lot of mayo and veggies, and tasted rather creamy and sweet! For those not too sure about trying octopus, you can start off with this one! The squid was GORGEOUS! Perfectly cooked to tenderness, the squid was so beautifully complemented by the sauce! Even the accompanying capsicum and onions tasted immensely good! I'd definitely have the squid again next time I go, but maybe something else instead of the Thai Salad!

Found out about them today morning and was there by the evening. Famished and with really high expectations. Its a small place with minimal decor which kind of needs some rethinking. They serve you with a welcome drink in cute bamboo mugs which was different but good to taste. We ordered for the stuffed pitha..bamboo chicken..smoked crab and sticky rice. I didn't find the pitha and the chicken as great as expected. But the crab and the sticky rice stole the show..they were absolutely delicious. They stole the show for me. The prices are super affordable. Overall a great experience ..will definitely want to try it again.

WOW this place is really Santas secret treasure......im lovin it. I heard a lot of this resteraunt from the Zomato users & finally decided to visit this summer. This gem is tucked inside a lane near Golpark. The interior & decor is similar to the food they serve ,........tribal cuisine & sea food. Man i didnt even know any resteraunt even serve tribal food in Kolkata. Bored with the usual Chinese, Italian & such similar food outlets in the city this outlet was on my wishlist for a long time. Their menu is vast offering lip smacking tribal food & sea food. Finally when the smoked squid & octupusses arrived on my table it took me not more than 15 minutes to order the next course that is Basa pora from the tribal section. All the food starting from the squid to basa pora are jhakass !!!!!! I am willing to rate the resteraunt & its owner 8 out of 5 for their whole new idea of creating such wonderful resteraunt & for changing the food road map of the city. Most importantly it do not burn a hole in your pocket unlike the other eateries in the city. Wish to visit the resteraunt many for times to try their other exotic quirky preparation. A must visit for all foodies in the city.

Finally tried their "Bans Pora Chicken" and I must say it's absolutely worth the money. Quantity wise maybe not as much as some expect but taste wise I loved it. Served in a unique way this dish definitely is a must try when one visits this restaurant.

Deliciousness on steroids!!! An amazing theme restaurant serving seafood and tribal cuisine. 
Had to wait a long time to get in.. But once in.. It was worth every minute. 
Their seafood supreme soup set our experience rolling. Filled with chunks of oceanic goodness, it has to be tried. Next came the wild red rice, bansh pora mutton and the smoked squid. They were awesome... With the smoked squid being out of this world. Last but not the least was the chemmeen kheer. Bliss for the tastebuds. Definitely a place I'm going to again.

With hundreds of restaurants in the city and new ones cropping up every day, it's time we demand more from these places. I have ordered take out from here previously and honestly the tribal fare was quite interesting although the seafood Kolkata chinese type preparations were awful. So on a Sunday we decided to go here for lunch. We took a seat on the inner side but were asked to move to another table near the gate because there was some booking for 11 people and they needed the table (those 11 people never came and our previous table was given to another group within 10 mins). We waited a long long time before anyone came to take the order. All this time people kept pouring in and waiting for tables right next to where we were sitting. There was no waiting area and on complaining, the staff asked the people to wait outside but some people just would'nt leave. We kept our patience until some people started dumping their bags on our table without even asking for permission. There are long lines outside many popular restaurants in the city but nowhere have I faced such annoyance while seated inside. Santa's Fantasea definitely serves some good food (only the tribal menu) but gets zero points for ambience.

Update: We had takeout from there last Sunday. Their staff was very kind and helpful. Especially Mr. Sanjay Ray. They bailed us out by taking our order when they had a "closed" board on the door and everything else was shut, also kept a pair of earphones that we left in the shop safely until we collected it. Coming to the food, the Bansa pora with pithe and a tribal rice were excellent but the mutton curry was just too much corn starch and garlic.

The sea-food tastes the same....its the same sauce used in all non tribal food....ambience is good....concept is awesome...
1. Banshpora - its mutton cooked outside and placed inside the bamboo....just the smokiness of the bamboo was good...else its just boiled mutton...taste not good.
2. Lobster - please DONT eat it here....you will never ever again in ur life would like to eat lobster...here what u get is lobster meat cooked in Chinese sauces with cornflour coating.....the lobster on top is actually the shell....they even reuse it....
Overall not so good.

I am a food lover, I love to eat and i love to write the feeling of the food in my mouth. However, sometimes you come across some sheer genius, which creates an indelible impression on you, you make a memory, which you want to feel again and again, but the words come short for describing it. Thanks to ¬†Santa's fantasea, i felt the same yesterday and made a memory and definitely will be in deficit of words for describing it.
This place have been getting some rave reviews and awesome points courtesy of the food they serve here, with a smile.
Located right in the lane of anjali jewelers before the golpark side of Dhakuria bridge, this place is always bustling with food lovers. It is a small place, 20 ppl can dine in, at max.
With the rain outside, on Saturday night, after a waiting of 1hr.10 mins approx we got our place. I'm not gonna go on about their decor, its a themed restaurant, that's it.
We ordered the Thai sea food soup, Shanghai Squid, One mutton & one chicken banspora, soru chaklis, one Jadoh and one Beijing sea food noodles.
The thai sea food, was a green based soup, garnished with pudina, coriander and gondhoraj leafs and filled with a decent amount of sea food. It was the definition of delicious and we were just getting started.
I hated squid thanks to the buffet spread of Mainland china, before. But the squid they served here, with an awesome looking, Indo-Chinese sauce, i got the feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night. if it looked awesome, it tasted even better. Soft, squishy pieces of squid served in a tangy, spicy sauce, what else can you ask for.
Banspora, enough said, lol not really, mutton marinated and cooked and served in bamboo shoots, well that's their genius signature. The soft warm pieces of mutton marinated in feisty spices, ¬†left a riot of taste in our mouth, it was the showstopper. We ate it with soru chakli (roti) sort off Bengali pithey.
Jadoh, a dish made of coarse red rice, spicy and filled with decent pieces of soft mutton was good, fulfilling.¬†
We over ordered with a plate of beijing sea food noodles. i have never before seen noodles like this. It was kind off, noodle, pasta made flat type. It was nice, subtle, filled with soft pieces of prawn, crab and squid. After consuming the spicy banspora and jadoh, yeah it was little bland, but we finished our dinner on a high note. We were satiated by the orgasmic food they served.
In short, I wanna thank Santa's Fantasea, for making such awesome food and serving a piece of memory on the table.¬†
PS. It cost us about 1420 Bux for 3 ppl. well its pretty cheap, i'd say for the food they serve here. For 2 ppl it wud be 900 bux.
Make sure you have a waiting time of 1-1.30 hrs if you plan on getting a table there on any night within the time zone of 7-10 PM. you can go after 10.15 PM, but then most of the food would be finished.
It would easily have given this place a 5, cos its more than that. But i will take 0.5 points away, till they take over the above floor and convert it too a restaurant too.

Ambience: 4/5
This tribal theme restaurant looks every bit tribal. The welcome rice drink served in a tribal bamboo glass, a speciality from odissa is a pleasant appetizer. Apart from that water is also served in traditional brass glasses. The only grievance I had is regarding the cleanliness of some of the utensils. It can be improved.
Food quality: 4.5/5
Speciality is tribal and sea food. Since I don't like smell of sea food I opted for tribal mainly. I had bansh pora mutton. Pleasantly earthen flavored boneless mutton with sory chakli, a special ruti made of rice flour and maida. Also tasted smoked fish, it too  tasted good. In dessert, I was really surprised to taste onion payesh, a kind of kheer made with onion. It was also worth trying.
Location: 4.5/5
It is located a little interior in the street adjacent to anjali jewellers at golpark.
Cost to quality ratio: 5/5
Overall rating: 4.5/5
I will definitely visit the place again.

The restaurant ambience is a mixture of traditional tribal cultures as well as modern world.  The food varieties and quality of those are pretty good,  especially not eating BAANSPORA will be a huge miss. It's not 5 starred because of lack of seating comfort and Wi-Fi.

this place has been trending for quite sometime now!! an average of 4.7 at zomato speaks a lot in itself.. I was there two weeks ago on my birthday with my family... the seafoodie aromas and the decor captivated us as we entered.. It was a Thursday and yet it was packed. Luckily only one table was available and we got that!! So we did not have to wait which can get little frustrating at times...!!The owner and staff were polite and friendly!! So then we set the ball rolling! The seafood lemongrass soup was a perfect start.. Next up was a tribal course - of course Basa Pora! With that we asked for Jhulu Pitha and also Voksha Meh... ! it was all good! My parents did not quite like the Voksha Meh for itz pungency and may be their taste buds were not bamboo shoots friendly!!¬†Moving on, the mixed seafood rice and smoked squid were up next!! Must admit, one of the best seafood feel I have got ever since my last visit to Goa!!¬†We were full, but I had plans for night, so I packed the basil squid...& well-o-well... it goes perfectly with hard drinks !! Overall, fully satisfied and I am glad I chose it for my birthday dinner..!! It is hardly 10 mins from my house, so lots more visits on the way!!!Cheers & Bon Apetit!!

I'd heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. Decided to go there finally with a good friend of mine. When we entered the restaurant, no seat was available and had to wait for about 20 mints. They aren't accepting cards at the moment so remember that. Small restaurant, can serve 30+ people at most any given time. They serve you one drink at first. We ordered bans pora chicken and jadoh, the tribal meat rice dish. Food was supplied after about 15 minutes. We liked 'Bans pora chicken' more than the rice. The waiter was confident that it was enough for our appetite but sadly he was wrong and we had to order again. We found that octopus and tuna were not available. So ordered Oyster chili basil squid and Seafood Malaysian Noodles. Oyster chili basil squid was decent. Felt that it was more than smoked although you might disagree. Noodles was good but not exceptional. Quantity and quality both could have been better. But the service wasn't satisfactory, specially from a so called reputed Zomato certified restaurant. A big letdown. Will I go there again? Only if anyone pays for me. Only for the tribal food, four stars but half gets deducted for poor servicing.

Back on the Calcutta food scene after a very long time, I am constantly on the lookout for new and interesting experiences. That's how I stumbled upon this rather unique place on Zomato; and to my great pleasure, I later realized that it's among the most trending of Calcutta restaurants right now!
First, the pros. The menu and the quality of the food definitely deserves appreciation. The food is divided into two sections: Seafood and Tribal cuisines, which is also how the whole restaurant is themed and done up. The Seafood section is naturally more expansive and with a good range of Seafood items and the varieties of their preparations. The Tribal items though relatively limited, each appear quite tempting by the descriptions. We wanted to have the crab momos, but in its absence, we tried smoked crab and Shanghai squid. The former is a very interesting preparation of mildly smoked crab in a garlic and lemongrass based sauce. The spicier Shanghai squid was also very nice to taste, but personally I would prefer my squid without the batter coating, which would allow me to relish its subtle flavors more effectively. We followed these up with the signature Tribal item on offer: Baanshpora (Bamboo smoked) Mutton. This comes as small bite sized succulent pieces of boneless meat cooked inside a bamboo shoot section. The meat imbibes a distinctive strong smoky taste from the cooking process and we really enjoyed this with Soru chakli, a rice flour based item, very reminiscent of the South Indian Neer Dosa. All this (for a family of three) under ‚Çπ800... Amazingly satisfying! Not to forget, the complimentary jal jeera served in bamboo carved mugs!

Coming to the cons... It's a small place of two rooms and 8 tables only, operating out of the ground floor of an old house. They do not take reservations and we (and practically everybody else) had to stand in queue for 30- 45mins. To make things worse, there is no waiting area or sitting place, leaving no option but to stand on the road & dodge the traffic. Given the huge popularity of the place, it is rather understaffed, adding to the delays. In fact, it is quite commendable how the two lone servers were multitasking on many ends together with a constant smile on their faces.

Good ambience! Good food! But its a bit cramped up and the lights are too bright for a comfortable meal! But if you overlook these two... I am sure you will like the place! Moreover they make lovely sea food and tribal dishes ! As soon as you sit they serve you with this drink having curry leaves and sunflower seeds...hmm couldn't decide whether it's good or bad!!!!!  Had baansh pora a typical tribal dish! We also had red rice and squid in oyster sauce! The squid was awesome!!!! Overall it was good experience but it would have excellent if they served chilled water instead of normal water and if the lights inside were a bit more soothing! But you should visit it atleast once to have different experience !!! I know you will like it! I will again visit soon!!!

I loved the decor of this restaurant(both tribal and seafood section).They gave us a complimentary drink Tankha turani..I liked it.Food here is really awesome.I loved almost all of them which I tried.They r as follows.The only let down was on both occasions when I dined here..flat noodles,crab momos n octopus were unavailable.That's the reason I can't give it 5/5

Thai seafood soup-4.5/5..It was so warm,comforting n thick with abundant soft squid rings in it.Loved it so much.I wish octopus was present there too.

Green seafood fried rice-4.5/5..It was good with lots of soft squid rings.Missed the presence of octopus though.

Mixed seafood fried rice-4.5/5.. It was good with lots of soft squid rings.Missed the presence of octopus though.

Red seafood meifoon-4.5/5.. It was good with lots of soft squid rings.Missed the presence of octopus though.

Smoked squid-5/5..omg..This was out of the world.Squids were cooked to perfection..not rubbery at all.The gravy was spicy in a nice way..With smell of gandhoraj lebu.Winner dish for me.

Chilli garlic squid-4.5/5..perfectly cooked squids..very tasty dish.I wish it was just a bit more spicy.

Sanghai squid-4.5/5..Took it on recommendation of the manager.It was spicy n crispy.I liked it.But I prefer squids to b soft n enjoy its fresh flavour.

Smoked fish-5/5..It was cooked in same sauce as squid.Fish was slightly crispy outside n so soft inside.Loved it.

Baked fish-2/5..The only dish I hated.It was too sweet.Fish n creamy sauce tasted good in mouth..but the very next moment it was spoilt by the overpowering sweetness.One of my friend correctly described it as MACCHER GUR. :P

The price here is very reasonable.

Looking forward to going back here to taste their famous baansh pora,crab momos n most importantly octopus dishes(hopefully it'll b available next time).

Tasted 2 octopus dishes here---Burnt chilli octopus and shanghai octopus.They tasted very good but I felt number of octopuses in them was bit less.

What a sweet little place this one is! Yes, the vibe it has been generating with its Bansa Pora is stupendous‚Ä¶ and that alone is attracting hordes of insane meat-lovers! The best part: 'everyone is leaving with a dazzling smile and awesome reviews'. Why should it be different with me?

One must not forget that Santa's Fantasea also excels in its seafood delicacies along with the tribal marvels. So once there, don't just stick to the first two pages of the menu card.

We reached around 8.30 on a weekday and the place was packed up! It seems going for lunch is a safer option if you want to avoid standing outside. Thanks to Zomato, the menu was predecided‚Ä¶ and we wasted no time in ordering:

Tankha Turani - The complimentary rice drink from tribal Odisha. I loved the spicy-salty flavor, but needed time to get used to it initially. As we are used to having drinks on the sweeter side, the flavors of Tankha Turani might be a little overpowering at first. Give it a little time‚Ä¶ you are bound to love it.

Bansa Pora Chicken - The Crown Jewel‚Ä¶ period!! It delivered 100% as promised. What a mind boggling explosion inside the mouth! Never did I think smokey, charred chicken pieces cooked between two bamboo halves can taste so divine. Let's not waste words typing‚Ä¶ you need to eat it to know what I mean.

Jadoh - Fat rice grains cooked to perfection with red spices and mutton pieces. Was a little apprehensive but the risk was totally worth it. Complements wonderfully well with a spicy side dish.

Shanghai Squid - Coming to the spicy side dish, this one is my pick of the night (because Bansa Pora is one a different level altogether). Crunchy exterior with the rubbery squid cooked precisely, this is seriously one item every foodie must try once in this joint.

The only reason to take away .5 from the overall rating is because there is no one outside standing to take down names and send in the groups accordingly. Given the fact that this is a very busy restaurant even on weekdays, something like this should have been taken care of. I hope they look into this issue as soon as possible.

In all, a fantastic place if you want to try out rare and super-tasty dishes in Kolkata.

For all its hype and recent fame on Zomato, Santa's Fantasea flattered to deceive. The faux tribal decor was a bit too gimmicky and over the top for my taste. And the food a bit too underwhelming. The mutton of the bansh pora was lacking in flavors as well as a bit tough to chew on. The seafood salad was good but heavy in dressing. The prawn momos were thick skinned - a sin when it comes to momos. We took one plate of babycorn pepper fry just for kicks - that disapppinted too. A very average meal, all in all.

Located inside the Anjali Jewellers lane off Golpark, this restaurant has a very interesting blend of seafood and tribal themes.

We went there around 2.30 in the afternoon. The place was packed and we had to wait for a table. The tribal theme is reflected in the furniture which appear to be made from split wood mounted on bamboo frames. We sat in the outer room which had ocean themed decor, while the other room has tribal decor.

On sitting we were served complementary drinks in stylish bamboo cups.

We ordered Banshpora chicken, stuffed Jhuilla bread, seafood salad and for dessert Tilhou kheer. The food was served quite fast considering the place was jam- packed and there were only two waiters. The chicken was delicious but the amount could have been more. The seafood salad was excellent. Well-seasoned. The bread was the only jarring note. It was tough and not puffy at all. The filling was quite good however. The kheer was a real surprise. It was cool and light, yet blended with onions and spices.

The bill was only 580. Taxes are combined in the food price. What you see is what you pay.

I recommend this place, and will definitely go there again.

I was not sure about this place but was pleasantly surprised by the food. The decor definitely gives you that tribal vibe. Very easy to locate.We were welcomed with a complementary drink which was a tribal drink named trintha .We chose to order some seafood dishes instead of the signature ones.Ordered seafood beijing rice noodles, seafood malaysian fried rice, butter garlic squid & shanghai prawns. The rice noodles & shanghai prawns were spicy & delicious.Generous portions. No complain there. The service was quick and the staff were courteous :) The prices shown for all the items are inclusive of taxes so that's actually a big relief !!! :) Will definitely go back to try some of their tribal delicacies :)

The restaurant has been on my list for quite some time...went there with my friends...6 of us..it is located in golpark area in the lane adjoining anjali jewellers..for the first timers...you may want to ask people on the roads for direction...
Ambience---The restaurant is not very big but interiors are quite well decorated resembling tribal huts and some tribal pictures and themes..
Food----we ordered patra pora,jhupu pisi's mutton delicacy,shoru chakalis,smoked fish,fried rice and chowchu chicken.Patra pora was the best of all...served within banana leaves...the mutton was tender,juicy and having a smoked flavour...
Jhupu pisi was a let down for us..it was may be due to our own tastes...it was like a stew...
Shoru chakalis are pancakes made of flour,egg and rice...they were good enough...
And the smoked fish was awesome though a bit oily...and fried rice was okk!
Cost:After couple of shoru chakalis and the above dishes...it costed us around 1300..so I think its quite cheap..
PS:They served am panna as welcome drink..it was okk but we thought it could have been a tad little sweeter..
All is all...the experience was good and its worth a go

Tribal food and Seafood heaven, just perfect!!

This small joint is located in the lane beside the golpark anjali jewellers. The concept is totally unique and they have made outstanding efforts. There are two sections, one is tribal themed and other is seafood themed. Lovely decorations with tables made of bamboo. Waiters are attentive, service is little slow.

Everyone is welcomed with a complimentary tribal drink called Tankha Turani. The menu mostly contains large variety of seafood and tribal food. Veg and chicken options are very limited. We ordered Lal Ghost, seafood lemon grass soup, mutton bansh pora, chili garlic squid, mixed seafood fried rice and wild rice. I must say each and every dish was just awesome. Specially bansh pora and chili garlic squid. Definitely the best seafood in town. As of now price shown in menu is inclusive of tax so pocket pinch is low. Our total bill for all those items came rs 960 only. Highly recommended.

After getting great reviews from friends one fine evening we knocked the door of Santa's fantasea. The ambience is good. The welcome drink was good too. We ordered seafood soup with lemon grass which tasted great.. One of our friends was allergic to seafood. Even he could not resist tasting it. Then we opted for lal ghosth and Zulu pitha which were so so.. What mesmerised our taste buds were banspora and squid in chilli and honey sauce.. They were really mind blowing.. One must test wild red rice.. Quantity was enough to leave us the resturant in a tight and distended belly.. And lastly no VAT.. That's really good..

Delightful little place tucked away in the alley adjacent to Golpark Anjali showroom. My first visit there today and I'm satiated! We were welcomed with complimentary drinks, a traditional Odisi delicacy. We had smoked bhetki (though did not quite get why it was called smoked), the heavenly Banshpora mutton and Jadoh- red rice and mutton; a very spicy but delicious Meghalayan cuisine. The service was impeccable and lightning fast,and the staff were very courteous. The totally commutable location and the wide spread of dishes, specially for those who love sea food, makes this place an absolute win win. An early weekday too made us wait for a couple of minutes due to booked seats. Plus its very easy on the pocket too. I hope this one gains more popularity.For me, I have booked myself many more visits.
P.S. If you are planning to visit anytime soon carry some cash with you, the card option is temporarily not available.

I visited this place on a Rainy Sunday afternoon, and had to wait outside for quite some time. 
The place is dressed up with a tribal outfit. The place is pretty compact with ancient tribal graffiti on all its walls. 
They served this complementary tribal drink, which didn't impress me at all. 
We ordered Vetki Fish with green tangy sauce, Red sea food rice and Shanghai Chicken, all of which were mindblowing !! 
Reasonable prices, Excellent food !!

Santa's fantasea is located just a few blocks of Anjali jewellers, a unique place for sea food lovers and tribal cuisine. The ambience of this restaurant was good, it contained two sections one sea food section and other tribal section. We took a table at sea food section. Waiter served us a complimentary tribal drink 'Tankha Turani' which is a rice drink of Odissa, the taste was quiet unique.
Then we came to the main section, we ordered 'Baansh pora' mutton marinated and stuffed in a bamboo and cooked in tandoor. It was delicious, totally mind blowing. Then we ordered Mixed sea food rice with Octopus in garlic chili sauce. The baby octopus was so tender and the taste was awsome, you will be mesmerised by the quantity of octopus, squid, horse mackrel, prawn in the mixed sea food rice.
Then we ordered Jadoh which is a combination of red rice with mutton pieces. The mutton pieces were so tender and with the combination of red rice it was excellent, something worth trying. Next we ordered Baked fish which was again the best thing we had. Would visit again for trying squid, tuna fish and more.

Best seafood in town. Lovely ambience and interiors. This is place is just full of surprises. Each food item is just awesome. Its hard to decide. Bansh Pora is something out of this world. I recommend everyone of you to visit this place. Best sea food at most nominal rates possible.

Santa's Fantasea is a small & very nicely decorated seafood n tribal food joint. Easy to locate. As the place is very small , seats are very few, so we had to wait almost 30-40 minutes. Coming to the food we ordered Bansa Pora, Squid in chilli garlic sauce, mixed seafood rice noodles, mixed seafood fried rice. We wanted to order smoked octopus but as octopus was not available ( a let down of course) , ordered crab instead. Bansh pora was very tasty. Loved the squid. Crab was good but too hot & spicy. Noodle & rice both were good but couldn't finish off because of quantity. In this price range the quantity they offer is commendable. Loved the place. Will visit again.

After a lot of hoolahooing from friends, I decided to take some friends from outside to the place. Disappointed by exactly four vegetarian items in the whole list and a menu card that deserves some attention. The food is decently appreciable, well decked up interiors and a personal touch from the manager makes this is a good eat out, especially if you're in the mood for something other than the regulars we keep going back to.

Another restaurant for seafood lovers. wait it serves exotic tribal cuisine which is their speciality. Just located beside Anjali Jewellers in Golpark, this is indeed a hidden jewel. The restaurant is truely impressive. The ambiance is beautiful & the waiters are extremely polite. We were offered welcome drink as we took our seats. It was a kind of mint coolant. The best part was the serving mug. it was made of pure bamboo & it gave the drink a heavenly taste. Bansa pora is their speciality but the seafood also deserves a mention. Their mixed seafood rice is very fulfilling. You can even try their chicken dishes. But the smoked fish was something I just banged on. It was extremely delicious. It was really an awesome experience & I am looking forward to visit there again & try the other items in their menu :)

this is going to be my 100th review and what an experience to write about.

the restaurant is located in the alley beside anjali jwellers near golpark. parking is a bit tricky as the lane is narrow and you have to manage between lots of cars as it's a pure residential area.

they have 2 sections. the bigger part is tribal themed and the smaller part is themed after sea life. neat work and very catchy.

next the menu will draw your attention and you must go through the complete menu to decide what you want as all the items are unique. staffs here are very friendly and they will explain all the food items properly. they will even suggest what is better according to our food taste. very courteous service and a brownie point for that.

you MUST start with bansa pora or patra pora or mati pora. these three are their signature items. we opted bansa pora so were presented with two charcoaled bamboo sticks full of tender pieces of mutton. amount was enough for 2 people. as per their recommendation we had them with fine rice chapatis.

next came kukhura ko masu, a chicken preparation with tamarind and coconut, very unique in taste. and we also tried sanghai squid which was pieces of squid deep fried and tossed in hot red sauce. it was very well prepared too. prawn sukha was also nice, not too dry, had a very mild taste of mustard sauce, again quite unique. along with all these sides, we opted for mixed noodles, which was quite big in amount, one portion can be easily served to three. unfortunately, octopus was not available that day and we missed it :(

coming to the end, i MUST say this is one unique restaurant where each and every item is a must try. i am hoping to visit soon and try mati pora and few of the octopus king fish and lobster items. price is very reasonable and nothing to complain about.

Seeing the average rating of this place i dont think anyone would even have a doubt before visiting here. I didnt.
I fortunately had the luck to chat with the restuarant owner and i was more impressed than ever. The reason why santa's fantasea is so trending and has kept its high ratings intact is that out of evrything else they put much notice on these reviews we put up on zomato. 
He told me they even changed few dishes considering the suggestions of few reviewers. Wow!
I tried the octopus in chilli garlic sauce, smoked squid, mixed fried rice, plam cake. Had nothing to complain. The Octopus was perfectly cooked not too chilli not too sweet, got about 6 to 8 pieces which was more than enough. The squid was a dish like a crispy chilli baby corn to be precise but tastier. The fried rice was enough to feed two hungry souls. Was more than full to have anything else. My sister wanted something in dessert, but unfortunately they dont keep much options on that part so had to go for the plam cake, which was actually not that good. 
Still a 5 star from me.
The interiors+ the service + the food 
THUMPS UP!!! 
Cant wait to visit again. :)

We went to Santa's Fantasea on a Sunday for lunch.

In this regard, I should warn you about one thing: you have to wait at least half an hour to get a seat as the theme based eatery has very limited dining arrangements (around 30 people only).

So a dinner on a weekday would be a safer bet for people coming from a distance.

The decor (oceanic in the outer room and tribal in the inside one) perfectly matches the dishes they serve.

As you enter, the enthusiastic waiters will greet you with a glass of 'Tankha Turani(a variety of Chaas with some herbs and spices)'as a complimentary, welcome drink.

Though momo is a Sikkimese delicacy, I suppose we have it more than them nowadays.

You can choose any among Chicken, Fish, Prawn and Crab Momos. They are pretty well-stuffed and tasty as well.

Now you have come here to have some quality seafood, so be a 'Perfect Voyager!!‚Äô

Order any of the seafood soups and you will have the delight to dip into the sea of Squid, Octopus, Prawn and Crabmeat and also mushroom (for selected ones).

Moving onto the main course they have limited offerings for tribal spread, so it‚Äôs better to be a 'Mechho' like me and concentrate on the seafood again.

They have seafood rice, noodles and also rice-noodles in four varieties including veg as well. Believe me you will be mesmerized by the quantity and quality of squid, octopus and prawn present in them.

Now I have eaten octopus many a times in the City of Joy. But this time, it was never like before!!Tender baby octopuses in a spicy gravy ('Smoked Octopus') will simply tantalize you more and more.

We also ordered Squid for side dish. Large portions of squid cooked in Chili Garlic style is a must try if you are a newcomer to this Ocean (!!).

Did I miss to mention the 'Bansa Pora'? Silly me!!It‚Äôs a unique 'Mutton Marvel ‚Äòthat would surely make you high! Its soft, it‚Äôs boneless and it‚Äôs cooked in such a style that you will surely have the burnt out smell of the bamboo as well.

I will surely revisit the place to dedicate myself to the praise of Tribal cuisine.

Finally got the chance of visiting this restro today with my school friends for a reunion kinda thing. It's been on my wish list for quite some time. N I was jumping with joy when I heard that my friends had opted for this place.

I expected a large crowd owing to the super high rating on zomato. Thankfully we did not have to wait.

Now ambiance- we sat in the tribal section. The decor is outstanding. It really felt like a tribal atmosphere. Even the furnitures had a tribal touch.

FOOD- one word. Marvellous. Period
Even the complementary drink tankha turani also.
Our order consisted of the following
3 bansa pora
2 mixed seafood rice
1 mixed rice noodles
1 veg noodles
1 smoked fish
1 korigassi
1 basil squid
1 jhupu pisi's mutton delicay
2 julu pithas
Sadly octopus was not available which was a huge letdown. Flat noodles were unavailable also.  This is my reason of deducting .5 from my rating. Recently my friend had visited and the same thing had happened with him. Why include such dishes in your menu which you fail to serve?? It may happen once. But repeatation of the same thing is not desirable.   However squid n fish compensated my sadness of not being able to try octopus.
Bansa pora as everybody already knows is great. But the quantity is too less compared to the price. Smoked fish and basil squid were the undoubtedly showstoppers of the day. I recommend anybody visiting this place must try both. Korigassi is a chicken dish prepared in green sauce. It was okayish. Julu pithas I did not like at all, although it had egg as well as chicken keema in it. I had expected that they would serve some chutney kind of thing to go with it because it's dry. I think it would have tasted nice had it been served very hot. They served it at normal temperature. And trust me I am not exaggeting if I say that it tasted like idli gone cold and being served without a chutney. Imagine the disaster.
 Veg noodles was again goog but not the best. Jhupu pisi's mutton delicay was again so so. It tasted like normal mutton curry but the gravy was a tad bit too sour which somewhat took away the taste of mutton. Otherwise nice to have with rice. Mixed seafood rice was good. Very good in fact. And the quantity was enough for two ppl.

Service is a a 3.5 /5 because the waiter was asking us repeatedly if we were done or not. I understand that ppl were waiting outside but it does not feel nice when the waiter is urging you to finish quickly. Otherwise he was helpful.

I just want to add that it's one of those places which we Bengalis refer to as "joler moton sosta" meaning unbelievably cheap. So m returning very soon to have octopus and flat noodles and other tribal dishes. 

And one suggestion- please add some desserts to the menu if possible.

Kudos to the Santa's team for such innovative concept and lip smacking dishes.

Today was my Santa's Fantasea debut...
Even on a week-day afternoon all tables were occupied, we had to wait but the hospitable manner of the staff made even waiting comfortable.
Now, the food-
First, the complimentary palate-cleansing appetizer with yoghurt, curry leaves and mustard seeds was quite refreshing...
Me and my partner wanted to try items from both the sea-food as well as the tribal section.
So, we ended up ordering prawn fried momos, pasta sea-food salad and korigassi (a tribal chicken curry with coriander gravy) with a staple of simple, steamed rice.
The momos were perfect, with a crunchy exterior and a succulent filling of juicy prawns.
The pasta sea-food salad was a little disappointing as it was all about the pasta, cheese, tomato and cucumber chunks with only a faint fishy smell and an occasional bite of squid if you are lucky.
The korigassi on the other hand was heavenly.
Subtly flavoured green curry with 8 chunky chicken pieces tasted wonderful when mixed with steaming hot rice.
The bill came to Rs.480 and it was well worth our time and money.
Definitely visiting again.

The place is pretty small. And kinda cramped. The interior's divided into two rooms, one painted blue with mermaids and the other with a tribal look. And those are it's two cuisines, tribal and seafood. This is probably the only place that serves tribal food.¬†
I visited the place around two weeks, having heard so much about it from my friends. It was 1 PM and completely crowded. We had to wait for a table.¬†
We ordered Baansh Pora, Smoked Crab, Squid in Chili Garlic Sauce and Baked Coconut Prawn, along with Coke.The baansh pora was served in an actual bamboo shoot. The meat was minced, dry with a strong flavor that I absolutely loved. The squid was a revelation. Kinda spicy, but it was perfect, with the Baansh Pora. The Crab was okayish, a bit tangy. And the prawn I loved. It's the one dish I would recommend anyone going there, along with the squid.¬†I hope to try out Octopus next time.¬†Oh, and their welcome drink was horrible.

After reading a lot of reviews from here, I finally decided to drop in this restaurant, which is just a few paces inside the alley adjacent to Anjali Jewellers, located in Golpark. My first visit was quite welcoming. Was welcomed with a drink which was quite refreshing..a mix of Gondhoraj Lebu and curry leaves with a hint of spice(was pretty interesting).¬†
What we ordered: I wanted to order the crabmeat momo. But unfortunately wasn't available. So, we started the rainy day with Konkan Seafood Salad- It was amazing!!
Mixed sefood rice: This had a mix of prawn, crab, octopus and squid! Since, I am a Seafood addict I didn't have a problem with the mix of seafood but people who are allergic or do not like squid or octopus can definitely ask not to add them. Then again it tastes best with the mix of all.¬†
Squid in hot Garlic Sauce: Okay, so am a fan of Squids and I simply love them. Not many restaurants in the city serve squid and even if they do it is not cooked to perfection. But the happy news is that this place surely knows how to cook it to perfection. It was lip-smacking. Again I like the squid plain in butter pepper flavour fried but this is worth trying too.
Pocket Pinch: 500 for two(yes you read that correct)¬†
P.S: I quoted the pocket pinch only for seafood and not tribal cuisine that they offer.¬†
Looking forward to their tribal menu for my next visit.¬†
All in all genuinely tasty food at really affordable prices. Thumbs up!

Baansh Pora Mutton and Jhupu Pishi's Mutton Delicacy are must orders according to me.
The food was mind blowing and to add to it I loved the decor and the friendly staff. This is evidently a place where one visit is not enough to discover everything.¬†
Missed out on the crab momo but will be visiting soon enough to get a grab of the things that I missed.
A sure shot 5/5 for Santa's Fantasea.¬†
p.s. all prices are tax inclusive so a bill of 500 bucks stays 500 bucks.

Very nice place. The food is very good. Wanted to taste seafood and it was really good and very cheap also. The decoration is very nice. The Shanghai squid was the best, if you go there I think you should once try it. There are two rooms, one with ocean theme and another with tribal theme. The place is very small though, the tribal room has 4 tables for 16 people and the ocean room has 3 tables for 10 people only.

This was my first visit to this place and it was a really different experience. I was way too satisfied with the food and the variety that they had to offer. It has a selection of different types of tribal food from different states. We were served a welcoming drink called Tankha Turani which was really good. Needless to stay the best thing that we had was the Bansa Pora which had succulent pieces of mutton with Soru Chakli. I really loved the Meghalayan dish of Jadoh which is a simple and delicious concoction of red rice with mutton pieces. We had ordered Smoked Octopus and Smoked Crab as recommended by the staff which was totally taste worthy. We had also ordered 2 dishes as takeaway one being Jhupum pishi's Mutton Delicacy and Voksa Meh both of which were tasty and something that we had never tried before.Its a quaint little place but its really a gem be it their food, hospitality or service. Really plan on visiting this place soon.

Santa's Fantasea... As the name says.. My first tribal and seafood joint hunt!! Located at golpark, precisely at Ballygunj terrace next to anjali jewellers. Ambience is cool with a tribal motif.. Tribal statues and wall decors and alpanas. It has also a seafood section which is decorated with fishes and sea images. I went for tribal foods.. So a must tries are bansh pora ie mutton cooked in bamboo sticks which is a tribal food of odisha, soru chakli rooti, ie rooti made of rice and spring onion and as a starter shenghai squid.. Which is a seafood. It tasted the same like crispy chilli babycorn only instead of babycorn you have squids. They warned us not to have octopus on first place, as they are sticky and couldnt be finished. Bansh pora tasted awesome, finger licking so as the soru chakli rooti. We were warmly welcomed with tankha turani as a complimentary drink., which is a drink made of rice, also a tribal drink of odisha. You can also try mutton kerala soup as a starter and also crab momo. Staffs are friendly. Budget friendly as they dont take any taxes which was surprising for me and also worthy of spending money. Would visit again for tuna fish and more!!

Food was good actually for kolkata foodies the tastes may be new. I think the presentation of the food was good, things are very simple but how they are presenting the dishes to their customers that is more important. I hav ordered for kerela mutton soup which was just a soup with coconut milk and its simple, then baspora mutton and red rice these two are cooked in a traditional way, the rice was villagers traditional rice which we call lal chal. And the baspora mutton is cooked in a very  traditional process. Quite simple but good food. Welcome drink was awsome.

It has one of the best squid dishes in Kolkata. And the Mutton is amazing! Keep up the awesome food guys!

Take the right turn from anjali jeweller's golpark, branch if you are travelling towards it then walk for 2 minutes straight and there lies the small well decorated restaurant. 
The ambience is good enough, all decorated with bamboo. Starting from the welcome drink to the main course all were new items that we ordered for. The special attraction was BANSH PORA which is a must dish.octopus is another mouth watering dish. 
But the place is not spacious enough but good for cozy cozy couple dinner.
Again its a must visit if you want to try out tribal food.

If you are bit health conscious  and a weight watcher then you must try their tribal cuisine. Zero oil but superb taste specially jhupu pisi's mutton. Bansa pora is excellent , a must try item. Wild rice is tender and nice but I like jadoah more. Pocket friendly.  Quantity is moderate. Will visit this place again.

A theme restaurant at the heart of golpark is a place i went to on saturday. Once you enter you get passed the theme room of sea and then you get into the next room of a tribal village. I took my seat amidst the sea and there came my welcome drink Tankha Turani which is complimentary. It didn't take much time for me to place my first order as Bansh Pora was pre-decided. I just had to confirm what would go good with it and they suggested the rice chapati which was unique as well. Within a few minutes came the much awaited Bansh Pora Mutton and its aroma was allover. It was a pleasure to taste it as it was something i never tasted before. Just bansh pora was not fulfilling my crave for more and more there and thus thought of ordering something else. The owner himself was there to take care and thus he suggested ¬†Kukhura Ko Masu and we just went with his suggestion and had it again with the same rice chapati. It was again delicious.¬†
The furniture were made in the tribal design. They serve water in copper glass and store water in a copper jug which i love.
The waiters were cooperative and courteous.
Highly recommended.
Looking forward to try everything in their menu.

Last Sunday afternoon our family wanted to try out a new restaurant for a change in your taste buds.  
We decided on Santa's Fantasea located at golpark which served Seafood and Tribal cuisine.
The cozy 40 seater located conviniently in the lane adjacent to Anjali jewellers, Golpark, where parking shouldn't be an issue, does not take reservations and works on a first come-first serve basis.
We reached at 1pm sharp and immediately got a table for the 5 of us.
The menu was not at all fancy however the content was new and different. We placed our order and had to wait for about 20 minutes for our food.
If you're wanting a change to your taste buds and you're not vegetarian then this is your place !
The food was delicious and different. It's one of the very few places that sell octopus, squid and tuna at a reasonable price. It's not the kind of food you've been tasting in the various other food joints of the city.
The staff was helpful and their suggestions were as per our need.
A great, satisfying lunch for 5 and we paid Rs 1800 ( inclusive of a jumbo lobster that cost Rs 850 ).
If you're the kind who's on the lookout for a new and unique place then your search ends here !
However the few things that one should keep I'm mind while visiting this place are :
1. Reach before 1pm or else you might have to wait for over 30 minutes for a table.
2. If you're vegetarian then you're gonna have very limited dishes to choose from.
3. The crowd is dominated by bengalis who love chatting at the lunch table, so don't expect great ambience. However the hospitality of the staff and food would make up for it.

Happy eating :D

A decent eatery serving north eastern and tribal cuisine with reasonable prices. The Kerala mutton soup was light with just a sprinkling of shredded mutton, but it was tasty. The bamboo mutton was particularly good and goes well with the rice pancake rotis. Portions for the bamboo mutton were quite generous and although the burnt flavor might not be for everyone, it has a unique taste that's not too spicy but deliciously smoky. The complementary drink was alright - a rice based drink which tastes a bit like a bland buttermilk. It seemed like "bhaater fan with phoron" (boiled rice foam with roasted spices ?)

I wasn't too impressed with the Jhupu Pishi's mutton curry, the gravy wasn't too bad and had what tasted like jalapenos - but the mutton itself - 4 chop pieces were very tough and a bit undercooked. The waiter recommended red seafood rice to go with this; thick short grained rice with hardly any seafood, but not too bad taste-wise.

This is the sort of restaurant that will be a huge hit with the college going¬† & youth crowd for its price and generous portions, but don't expect tip-top quality here and make sure you know what you are going to order before-hand. The cooks do tend to rush as soon as it gets past 10pm, so get in early. The kitchen is absolutely filthy, but I suppose we can ignore that given the taste of the food.

Having said that I do look forward to going back here and trying fish or octopus dishes. I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous yesterday given that we're still barely out of summer. Everyone around me seemed to be fond of the squid, octopus and pomfret, so I'll probably try one of those next time.

You enter this small eatery through an aquarium and end up in a tribal village complete with alpona on the walls and a quaint tribal mural....
The waiters are pretty welcoming and the Aam pora r sorbot arrived promptly to the table ( they are not serving their usual complimentary drink Tankha Turani due to the heat.... ). We ordered the much fabled Bansh Pora Mutton and I confess I have never tasted anything like it... It was like an explosion of flavour on my palate with all the taste buds tantalised!!! The Jhulu Pitha a rice bread stuffed with Mutton and eggs... Nice but not over the top wonderful... The Ngatok is a nice oil less appetiser... A spicy steamed fish... Wrapped in banana leaves... A twist on our regular paturi.... Again very different combination of flavours which worked wonderfully together. 
Then, overcome with gluttony and enthusiasm on discovering that Santa's Fastasea is another restaurant by the people who own Ecstasea ( they serve the best squid and octopus in Kolkata... Awesome) we ordered seafood fried rice with generous portions of calamari, prawns... Amazingly delicate... Just what it should be... Just a dash of pepper and we were on board!!! And to lap up the rice we married it with. Octopus in Spicy lemon sauce.... Simply divine... But with a tad over abundance of lemon grass in my opinion  .. The showstopper for the evening was Jumbo Prawn in garlic butter... We died and went to food paradise.... Delicious!!! 
Pocket pinch... Omg... It is reasonable... Cheap even.... 
We love it... And will return hungry for more!!!!

After reading a lot of reviews from here, we friends decided to drop in this restaurant, which is just a few paces inside the alley adjacent to the Anjali Jewellers, located in Golpark.
As it was Sunday, we had to wait outside for almost 10-15 minutes, but our patience was rewarded later. The waiters were courteous and considerate; they never showed any irateness even once.¬†
We had ordered a number of items (the photos of some of them are attached); the stand-out amongst them were Patra Pora, Smoked Octopus, Arsa Chhum and Bansa Pora (exclusively in that order). Although we heard a lot about the last item I mentioned, its flavour did not meet the expectations we had for the dish. The other three truly tasted like the real "ambrosia".¬†
P.S: The prices shown for all the items are inclusive of taxes. (This was actually a big relief for all of us when we came to know of the same.)

visited the place today after reading the reviews fin zomato.its was crowdy place and we had to wait for for long to manage our seats.. after waiting for nearly one n half hours we finally get our seats. the ambience was nice and seats were arranged for sevev people . the inner space is not very big but comfortable. now coming to the food . at first we got a welcome drink which was undoubtedly good and was sixer as a first impression . then we ordered food, the ¬†food was mouthwatering , specially the bansa pora meat which is very famous , but there have another dish which simultaneously good , is VASKA MEH . this is a mutton preparation with seasonal herbs and bamboo shoot. this dish is just made our lunch. so guys if you are planning to check in place this can be a must try dish. and try this with veg rice .there is another new thing is green seafood rice. ¬†the seafood cuisines are also very tasty and they provide sufficient amount of food. and most importantly price very pocket friendly , thoug it it was very consuming , still after having the food i must say it's worth the wait as we often say " sabra ka fal mitha hotha hain " ;) ;)

I visited this place after hearing oodles of good stuff from friends and reading reviews on Zomato! Clearly I had a lot of expectations! However, the experience was quite close to a disaster! After waiting for nearly 45 mins we finally managed to get ourselves a seat and ordered prawn sukha and smoked crabs and some green rice to go with it! The rice turned out to be dangerously HULKish green and to my surprise prawn 'sukha' and 'smoked' crabs tasted just the same! ;-) I cackled on the crab shells to find some meat but to no avail ( I wasn't expecting shelled crabs to be served in the first place)! And to top it, within a moment of our paying the bill, before we could even transfer the change back into our purse, we were asked to leave because there was '1' more family waiting outside! ;-) Absolutely horrendous!

Ok...so after more than a year, after hearing rave rave reviews, repeatedly, I dared to visit once again. We ordered Bansh pora chicken with shoru chakli for starters and later went on to have wild rice with smoked prawn in lemon grass. Bansh pora was outstanding yes! For dessert we had the prawn dessert which was nothing but bits of no smell no taste prawns in makha sandesh. 
Overall, better experience than before!

We all love things out of the ordinary... Most of us have two main options before going out food, 'Chinese' or 'Moghlai'... How bout coming out of that... This small place at Golpark makes us get away from that... Who knew tribal food can be this tasty and ppl wud go from 'O MA GO' Octopus!!! to ordering Octopuses and Squids galore... This is where this place has won... Everything in the menu sounds unique and delectable... Hope to be here again and again!!

Great food....not only the bansha pora mutton but also the Patra Pora mutton was awesome. We tasted their new dish.. Shanghai squid which was equally good. The ambience was uniquely done with a tribal section next to the sea section. One thing that needs mention is the price. Such good food at such reasonable prices is a rarity these days.To foodies like me good food matters and the price is secondary...but when it does not hurt the pocket, it is an additional bonus. The 
Ngatok fish additionally needs mention...amazing taste. I'm looking forward to my next visit to taste the other dishes.

This is currently my favourite place to eat.. And I have been referring this to a lot of people these days :D
First when you enter this shop, they provide you a refreshing drink, which is nice onna hot summer day! First I had their Kerala mutton soup.. Which initially looked too dull to me, but once I took the first sip, it was wow! Taste of mutton, with lemon grass.. It was excellent.. Next I tried their tuna salad, smoked octopus.. Both were nice.. Then came their legendary baansh pora.. Which was mind blowing.. I was little confused what to take with baansh pora.. And the waiter suggested me to take one of their special chapati.. And we loved it.. It was amazing in taste.. And went really well with the chapati.. Thumbs up!

Santa's Fantasea ..well as the name suggest ,this place truly have some uniqueness and yet it will not burn a hole in your wallet . This is on of those restaurants ¬† where one will like to try out the whole menu if possible . As for me I went there a few times and managed to taste few of the dishes . They have managed to create an interesting menu containing some tribal and seafood dishes. ¬†The Bansa pora along with the Soru chakli ruti ¬†is my favorite and for the starters the smoked squid is awesome . Among the rice preparation I tried , Jadoh is my favorite. The environment of the place is good enough for me .. ¬†I managed to complete about 20 % of the menu and hope to complete the rest by this year . For me the location is perfect for some small ¬†adda along with some nice tribal dishes to try on .

A nice restaurant in the heart of golpark,the first of its kind..went their with my better half..was awesome,the decorations,the ambience,the seating arrangement,the walls,the miniature santhal models,the bamboo glasses with the HULKISH green drink everything will make you spellbound ; and to break the spell there came the food .
The veg rice and the pomfret in green curry , i must say both were equally horrible . The fish was stinking and the and the rice was overcooked , dunno how they serve good food . And to top all things up , they even were not accepting cards . I hope not to return to this place too soon , hope you ppl have a better experience when you go here..keep rocking , keep chewing ..

Mesmerising! !
Wish I could give them a rating of more than five.
We were welcomed with a complementary drink which was a tribal drink named trintha which was made of sweet and sour burnt mango. It tasted wonderful.
We ordered their famous bansa pora which is a mutton preparation roasted in a bamboo shoot. The aroma of the burnt bamboo adds to its uniqueness. We had that with rice rotis which were highly soft and tasty.
This was the tribal foods that we tried first. Then we went for the seafood.
We ordered smoked squid whivh was awesome. The taste will linger for hours if you don't spoil with all the mouri during bill payment. The squid was cooked with gandhoraj lebu leaves. The beautiful taste of the dish can't be described in words.
Along with that we had ordered mixed seafood rice with gravy. It was simple and delicious.
This is one outlet whose entire menu I would like to try.
And the bill for all these was 670 and no tax.
The ambience is unique and so is the decour.
One dining room has the underwater theme denoting their seafood menu and the dining room has the tribal theme denoting their tribal food menu.
The furniture were made in the tibal design. They serve water in copper glass and store water in a copper jug which I would suggest that they do away for health reasons.
The waiters were cooperative and courteous.
After a long time we not only had food but had a grand experience.

If you are looking for tribal and sea food then Santa's Fantasea might¬† just be the right place. If you go on a Sunday, like I did, there are chances that you might have to wait for 10 minutes before you get a table. However, the dishes will make the wait totally worth it. The welcome drink which is similar to the familiar Aam panna in a bamboo mug, Bansa Pora which is mutton stuffed in bamboo, mixed sea food fried rice with squid and octopus¬† are some of the dishes that I would definitely recommend. The quantity is very good and one plate for each item could easily suffice for three people with normal appetite. Considering¬† seafood, we were a little apprehensive but they sure know how to deliver hygienic, tasty dishes in a short span of time. Small joint but totally worth the experience. :)

Finally visited this place. Although quite small, its clean and the ambience is nice. We were greeted with a complementary drink in bamboo glasses. It was refreshing but could have been a little cooler. We ordered Thai Seafood Noodle Salad, Crab in Coco Lime Sauce, Chicken Keong and a Mixed Seafood Rice. The salad was ok. A tangy combination of flat noodles, fish, prawn, squid, octopus, peppers and lettuce. Loved the Chicken and the crab dish. The chicken was spicy, went well with the rice. The crab was served in a yummy sauce. Crabs were fresh, soft and succulent. The Rice was good but it could have done with a ¬†more fish and prawn pieces since we asked not to give octopus and squid in the rice.
The staff were courteous and the bill amount surprised us by being a lot less than expectation. They dont add any taxes. Will visit again. More options in the drink/dessert menu would be nice.

17th june: I went to this place with great hopes because I heard that the place serves tribal food and seafood
I visited the place with my man
When we entered the place the ambiance sort of caught our attention with the paintings and textures done on the wall and as soon as we entered they served us in a bamboo cup ,a soft drink which was not refreshing and cold
The impatient waiters came immediately to our table and I should mention that two waiters came to our table to attend us and were leaving in between when we tried placing the order
Rahul and I were not that hungry so we ordered veg rice and pomfret with tangy green sauce
The food was standard
The fish had a typical smell which made the dish taste really awful but the rice was somehow edible
The quantity of the food was not satisfactory
The prices were overrated in comparison to the food we got served
I personally didn't find the behavior of the attendants pleasing which I always mention in all my reviews
I don't think that I would ever think of visiting the place again.

Bansh pora, some pishi's mutton, chicken in tamarind and lemon sauce, wold red rice, and ngatok. I've listed the items in order of the tastiness of the dish. Very impressive menu. Still lots of items to try.

Had a wonderful experience at this place. Visited just few days after it had opened. ordered bangsha pora, and patra pora and both of them were superb, although the portions we found were small. For soup we chose coconut lime..which tasted divine. Although we were a little sceptical about sea food but they too turned out to be mind blowing, and this included sea food rice and noodles. secor was nice and creative. space was little. what I liked the most was the guidance and assistance of the owner/chef, and interaction with each customer asking for feedback.

Located in a quiet lane across main road in Golpark, it was not very difficult to locate it as we went there a couple of weeks back on a Saturday for dinner ....
A few things about the restuarant:
Its a very small outlet with just two small rooms ( maybe 9*9 size approx) as the total space for dine-in ...
Waiting time is too high as we had to wait for over an hour outside for our turn to enter into the restuarant.
No such prominent parking place beside the restuarant but have to find one in nearby lanes .....
Now coming to the main part -- the food ....this is where it manages to overshadow its drawbacks .... We had ordered the much popular Bansa Pora (Orissan tribal) which was mutton served inside a bamboo ...taste was quite good .... we had Voksa Meh and Jadoh(meghalayan recipe) .... but the one which stole my heart was Bhetki Smoked Fish .... its one of the best fish recipes i have come across in recent times .... loved it so much that we ordered multiple plates of that item again ..:) .... Mixed sea food rice was great in taste too .... ..... pricing was ok i should say ... as i said its not spacious inside and ambience not that great ..though they have tried to maintain a theme inside e.g the table was made of wood carved out , the saltbox was made of bamboo as well and looked quite different ..... overall i would love to visit it again for its quality of food served .....

My friend and I reached the place at 6pm but were kept waiting outside the restaurant for a good fifteen minutes while they cleaned up inside.¬†Their signature rice drink was unavailable, so they served us warm, diluted aam panna which was an absolute turn off.¬†That being said, the staff was very friendly and rather embarrassed about the aforementioned glitches.

The Seafood Coconut Lime Soup was incredible. Very fragrant, light and soothing, perfect for summer. Although served hot, it looks to me like it can do just as well as a cold soup. The seafood was fresh and abundant. It's always nice to see experimental flavour combinations from the more budget restaurants of Kolkata.¬†

The Baansh Pora mutton was strictly okay. It tasted like a smokier, saltier kosha mangsho. The dish scores solely on the novelty of the cooking method and is not value for money. The portion size was small.¬†

We also ordered Shoru Chakli which is not on the menu but was available on request. This was a mistake. It was an overpriced, floury pancake with zero flavour.¬†

All told, not a great experience. Santa's Fantasea and Ecstasea are run by the same group. Perhaps that's why their seafood offerings remain far superior than the rest of their rather ambitious menu.

After a long wait , finally my friends and I decided to have our lunch here . Located at Golpark near Anjali Jewellers, this food joint has been an amazing experience. The food is cheap and served in its best quality. Outstanding mouth watering delicacies of sea foods one can get here . 
Apart from some unique preparation of chicken , rise and fish , we also took smoked crab and squid stuffed with fish dipped in red sauce and pan fried. The later was a lavish one . Though the service was slow , but the food contented us so much that I am hardly left with any complains for it . 
I would love to go there often , not only because it's close to my place but for the amazing food that it gave . Probably the only restaurant in Kolkata I have visited that served us with a welcome drink of mango masala in a decorated bamboo glass . That gesture was really sweet.

Located in a quiet corner of a rather busy road, this place presents a rather affordable selection of seafood cuisine (student's perception).
Squid and Octopus are its main attraction.
Especially the Squid stuffed with fish, it has a sweetish taste with a hint of chili in the squid, and the fish was delectable.
But I did feel that the quantity is on the lower side.

Santa's fantasea located near golpark anjali jewellers is one of the best seafood joint you can get in kolkata. We went there with a group of 10.
We ordered
1. 5 Mixed sea food rice
2. 1 Green sea food rice
3. 1 Chicken keong
4. 1 Prawn sukha
5. 2 Smoked octopus
6. 1 Octopus in garlic chilli sauce
7. 2 Smoked squid
8. 1 Squid in chilli garlic sauce
9. 1 Crab in green tangy sauce
Honestly, all the foods were well cooked and tasty. The quantity of rice is a little less other wise full marks to food.
Ambiance is nice.
Welcome drink is a nice approach by the authority.
Pocket friendly price. All these we got for ‚Çπ 2400.
P.S : Take your time and go there. You may have to wait outside.
Go for it guys.

Oh what a fantasea! The restaurant is easy to locate, small but very well decorated with tribal art and little fish hanging here and there(non-edible, strictly for decoration purposes). And to think I hate fish! I was unsure as to how I'd react to the seafood, however the squid managed to steal my heart. The baansh pora was unique and tasty. But the best dish I had was the baked coconut prawn. It came in a creamy and thick sauce which was absolutely delicious. The crab was a bit of a let down because we couldn't figure out how to eat it and also it seemed majority shell with less meat. They also serve a complimentary drink at the beginning. The service is prompt and waiters polite.
Next time I visit I'd like to try the octopus.

Paradise on earth for sea food lovers. Their signature dish bansh pora mutton is a must try. They also offered us a new dish called the shanghai squid which is more like a Chinese preparation and was quite nice with the squid perfectly cooked. Their thai seafood soup was also pretty good with a distinct flavor of lemon grass. It was an amazing discovery. Would like to go back again and again and try the other interesting tribal foods.

Just came back from an awesome dining experience at santas fantasea...we started with crispy chili squid which was delicious followed by mixed seafood rice and octopus in garlic sauce as the main course.it was my first time having octopus and i couldnt help but think about oswald-the blue octopus!!but even  that could not spoil my appetite for the food tasted delicious...
The mixed seafood rice was literally mixed with all sorts of seafood!!and the octopus..though looked a bit creepy was quite good.
At last we ordered a desert..the date palm fantasea which in my oponion did not live upto the expecations..
But overall it was a really good experience and the decor was something new...would surely go back and try the bash pora...

FANTASTIC! That's the word for this little themed restaurant serving varieties of tribal cuisine. We were lucky to have arrived around 7:30 pm one Saturday and find ourselves a place, because within 5 minutes, there was a moderate sized queue outside the restaurant. We were cordially seated by the welcoming staff, and were promptly served with the welcome drink Tankha Turani, which was an experience in itself. Then it was time to order, and we settled for Bansa Pora, Ngatok, Julu Pitha, Smoked Octopus and Mixed Seafood Rice. The tastes were amazing, apart from the Julu Pitha, which personally did not suit my taste buds, but my hubby enjoyed it. I personally fell absolutely in love with the Bansa Pora, Smoked Octopus and Mixed Seafood Rice, and we ended up ordering repeats of the octopus. The Bansa Pora was brilliant, with the smoky aroma of bamboo wafting into our nostrils. The Smoked Octopus was absolutely delicious, the octopus cooked to perfection, neither chewy nor too tender, and the gravy was amazing. It perfectly accompanied the Mixed Seafood Rice, which was a gastronomical delight in itself, with generous amounts of seafood in every bite. The food is moderately priced, and does not harm your wallet one bit. The money you pay is worth every penny for the wonderful experience that dining at this restaurant offers you. Would definitely go back again very soon.

Fantastic Fantasea

This is a great place for good food. At pocket friendly prices, you will get options ranging from Bansa Pora which is mutton slow cooked inside bamboo to delicately cooked smoked squid. The restaurant offers a pleasant ambiance and a friendly service. Personally I like to sit on cushioned chairs at restaurants, but the food at this place made me overlook this problem.

I loved the Bansa Pora. Kudos to Santa's Fantasea for bringing in such dishes. The mutton inside the bamboo shoot is soft and succulent, with minimal spices. It has a beautiful aroma to it as well 

I have been here a couple of times and interacted with the owner. He is the man behind Ecstasea as well.

I thank him for coming up with such affordable yet fantastic restaurants.

After visiting Santa's Fantasea, I must say that I prefer it over Ecstasea because of three reasons. It is easy to locate, the menu is pretty versatile, the space inside does not make me feel claustrophobic like the small space in Ecstasea . Now coming to the food. In one word it was heavenly. We ordered Bansha Pora along with Squid in Garlic Sauce and Red Fried Rice. After tasting Bansha Pora, I regretted not ordering steamed rice because it complements the delicious smoked mutton very well. I am a big fan of sea food and the soft octopus in my rice and the sensory pleasing squids made me and my friend nod our heads in satisfaction!

Very easy to locate,santa's fantasea is presently,the fav resto of all college-goers.With its tribal decor and delicious food(sea food & tribal food) ,it is refreshing and very economical also. The staff were courteous and offered us a welcome drink on the house. Most of the menu was on sea-food ,unfortunately since i'm allergic to sea food(still wanted to visit) , we ordered from the small collection of chicken and mutton tribal dishes.The mati-pora was not available,so we went for bansa-pora.It was delicious! We also had the wild red rice and the kukhura ko masu.Both of which were heavenly.The second time we are hoping to try out Jadoh,a mutton dish.

I tried this place a month back but the food was alone to make me visit this place again within a month's time (FYI i stay in the other end of the city)
A really small place but the menu & food in itself is unique.. 
I cant say its the best coz i personally haven't yet witnessed anything similar to this place's food anywhere else in the city.

I was really excited after checking the menu & wanted to try a little of everything but while ordering the owner personally guided us & made sure that we don't over-order & can actually enjoy the food. This gesture was enough to make sure that i am in a place where the owner wants his guests to enjoy their food & is not just trying to sell foods mindlessly.

Well coming to the food which i would recommend everyone to try & will personally order again in my next visit are banshpora mutton, hong kong style squid, smoked octopus & their special roti.
We tried the julu pitha also, but would try something new like kerala mutton soup & the lobsters, crabs in my next visit..

A truly amazing much-needed place! To show the courage of serving up exotic tribal and seafood dishes when other restaurants are busy loading up on more Chinese and Mughlai and Continental... it's truly stunning.
I went with a friend and we ordered a Regular Lobster, Smoked Octopus and ofcourse Baansh Pora. The complimentary appetizer drink does need a little improvement but the dishes they serve... Wow, just WOW. The smoked octopus blew us away and so did the others. The baansh pora was perfectly cooked with it's sensuous tribal flavor... although it may be just a tad overhyped and overpriced. The lobster on the other hand, although absolutely a delight for the taste buds, was really quite overpriced indeed given it's serving size! But then again, one shouldn't complain when trying out dishes so exotic and well-done.
The ambiance is pleasant, the staff very very friendly and probably the only tiny reason I wouldn't rate this a 5/5 is cause the cooking has just a little room for improvement still left.
But kudos to the innovation, the ambitious effort and it's perfect execution!
Will return many a time :)

First and foremost, do not expect anything too special or too gourmet when you visit this place. Take this to be a cozy place that caters to a little differently cooked food. However, it is also recommended that you visit the place at off peak times -- in case you brave a visit in a proper dinner time, be prepared to wait for about 30-45 minutes for a table. This is because of the space crunch. Now coming to the food -- we ordered --¬†
prawn/shrimp momo -- I would have liked it if the flavor was not overpowered by cilantro leaves. My husband however liked it. I would have preferred the flavor of the prawns unmarred.¬†
shanghai squids -- winner hands down. this is not in the menu. but if you enjoy spicy food, ask for it, and rejoice.¬†
bansa pora -- loved the smoky flavored dry mutton.¬†
julu pitha -- a sweet covering envelops the savory filling -- well nice, although nothing exceptional.¬†
jadoh -- it was red colored rice with some smoky mutton pieces -- not too bad, but not so good either.¬†
Crab items were recommended by people, but they were out of crab even at 7-45 pm when we placed the order. It was a weekend too. If you have demand, try to maintain the supply.

I had first suggested this place to my sister a couple of weeks ago after forming my opinion wading through a dozen of reviews out here at this site.

Last week, luckily enough I managed to visit this place and form my own experience. Located inside a busy narrow lane in golpark this restaurant is an absolute delight.¬†The restaurant is unpretentious and done up to the theme of tribals. There are large wall murals greeting you as you sit on the wicker chairs. The place is enough to house a dozen tables. The waiters are ever smiling and if I am not mistaken one of the founders had taken our orders and suggested some.

No sooner had we made ourselves comfortable than we were meted out the quintessential tankha turani drink ( a dash of lime added to a jeera kind of drink).¬†This was accompanied by their magnum opus - bansa pora mutton ( which as the name suggests is a concoction of boneless mutton roasted inside a split bamboo shoot) and ngatok fish (cooked without normal spices, but an absolute must have).

Our main course constituted of jhupi pisis mutton (which was a careful fusion of mutton cooked in sezwan sauce and with added Thai herbs like lemon grass) and smoked crab. We had ordered for rotis which are made from rice flakes (the closest comparison would be the southern counterpart - neer dosa).¬†

Much against our own wishes we had to resist the temptation to try out the squids and prawns/ octopus ; called it a rain check. The place accepts cards though it was nonfunctional during our sojourn. The desserts are limited. My suggestion to the management would be to play some adivasi music in low volume to add on to the ambience. A definite visit for any food lover!

UPDATE: visited this place again after my last review [more than a year later].the place still doesn't accept credit cards. the management should either put up a warning notice that they don't accept cards or stop the year long excuse of cards being not accepted temporarily. ¬†i hope they read this and drop in a line of reassurance.

The 'must have' dishes are Baash Pora and Smoked or Sanghai squid, the mixed sea food rice (fried rice with shredded squid,octopus and prawn) , octopus in red chilly gravy and masala tuna.. I wanted to try the crab filled momo but they didn't have it. you can try that one too.. ;)
its a value for money restaurant. give it a shot..

Just three words "Its a fantasy",and I still fantasize over the food and get foodgasm when I think about Santa's Fantasea.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We tried bizarre stuffs-Octopus,Squids,Bansh Pora and Crab Momo. It was adventure in other sense because it was a first time for me,trying some creepy sea creatures like Octopus and Squids. Was reluctant ,but to my surprise both were awesome. Squid was the show stopper though.Even loved their complimentary drink of rice,served in bamboo mugs.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coming to decor and ambiance, they had two sections- a forest themed section and an underwater themed section. Ambiance wise,its good.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† In a nutshell,it was a bizarre and awesome experience and didnt make too many holes in my pocket :) 

¬†¬†¬†¬† Highly Recommended for foodies who love to experiment

A hub for seafood and tribal delicacies put together..the food journey here begins with a spiced rice based cmplimntry drink....The octopus and squid dishes are must hv sea food options...Staples can be Wild Red rice and Julu pithe which is much like the Taipo of tibetian cuisine with slightly different stuffing.The Tribal dishes here are my prsnl fav over the sea menu and Patra pora and Bansh pora should be in your checklist if u r a meat lover.Regarding Sea-food, avaibility is a question.So decide ur menu once you reach.Another thing,i hv been visiting this place for quite some time now and somehow in my last few visits i hv found the staff lacking their warmth a bit.Bt this should not stop u frm trying this wonderful place out at Golpark.

Oh ....what an experience!! My taste buds got exposed to a different taste altogether. We had bansha pora with their spcl Roti, smoked fish, jadoh, green rice n chilli garlic squid. Believe, each n every item was so exclusive in their taste.....amazing. the most surprising part was the bill....after having so much, it didn't pinch our pocket. Would love to visit again.....
The only suggestion is, pl increase the no of tables so that waiting time will be reduced.

This gem of a place is now currently my favourite. And I don't easily spill out a 5 star but not doing so would be cruel on my part. 

I had heard about this place from my friends and wasting no time quickly checked it out on Zomato. Easy to locate, the place is pretty well done up with art work done on the walls from under the sea to tribal lore. The menu too gives off that aura with a variety of tribal dishes that sound really good. Being served with a welcome drink on a bamboo glass, an impressive gesture....I quickly made the order. 
Crab steamed momos, smoked squid, Octopus in chilli garlic sauce, Veg rice and the much anticipated Bansh Pora. 

The service was prompt. The food arrived within minutes. The crab momos were well steamed , moist and gave off a very oriental flavour. The insides were very well cooked and it was a treat. 
Bansh Pora as the name suggests is mutton spiced up and cooked inside a burning bamboo shoot. The best of the lot, it was perfectly cooked and the flavours were rich as I expected it to be. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth, the smoked bamboo aroma was intoxicating. 
The octopus and the squid was by far the best I've ever had. The gravy too was very yumm. The right amount of flavours packed together. 
The quantities were quite good. Enough for two people. The rice was great ttoo noAnd the best part, the bill came to Rs. 815. Unbelievable, I thought but it was. 

Coming back again. Soonest. We need more places like this here in Kolkata. Kudos Fantasea for living up to your name and more.

It's a comparatively new addition to kolkata's ever growing eating destinations. A small restaurant... Flaunting a simple tribal decorum... And a must-go for someone who wants to savour the unique cuisine of exotic sea food even once...Baansa pora , the spicy Shanghai squid and fried prawn momo are what really inpressed me... Patra pora, stuffed squid, smoked crab, octopus in spicy lime sauce were ok.. Mixed seafood rice and mixed flat noodles werent that different from the conventional ones. Overall considering the amount of food and value for money, Santa's Fantasea offers an acceptable deal within average pocket pinch ; Although they really need to upgrade their desserts section. Be ready to wait outside for around 30 mins at rush hours if you have a large group...

The welcome drink in bamboo cups coupled with the bamboo furniture and accessories gives an almost authentic tribal experience(except the huge mirror, some plastic fans and the chargers carelessly dangling from the switchboards)..¬†
The menu is a mix of tribal (Odisha, Andhra and the Northeast) and Seafood
We were a little confused between the two worlds and ultimately ordered a generous mix of both (Jadoh, Bansa Pora, Smoked Squid and Seafood Red Fried Rice), didn't know what to expect.¬†
But the food spoke for itself, cleared all our confusions.¬†The tribal tastes were authentic, unlike anything I have ever tasted, especially the Bansa Pora. Although its a little extravagantly priced at 300(compared to the other dishes), it is worth every penny! A must have. When they open the Bamboo and serve the smoky mutton, it's a real drama added to the table!Just hope they can incorporate their seafood in the tribal cuisine because the modern seafood does not really fit with their decor and ambiance!
BTW heard they are adding seafood desserts. Prawn Payesh anyone??

Now this place is something I am really fond of. Have been here many times, but this place impressed me big time. A month back our friends' group first visited here for a b'day treat & it was a great experience.
AMBIENCE / DECOR - This restro is decorated in tribal and sea theme and you can also see pictures of sea creatures on the wall. Ambience is also nice.

QUANTITY - Portions are not huge but that hardly matters, you will enjoy ordering more.

TASTE - As for taste, Santa's Fantasea really nailed it. I have tried Thai seafood soup, prawn sukha, bansha pora, smoked squid, mixed seafood noodles, mixed seafood rice, squid in chilli garlic sauce. 'Lipsmacking' is the word that comes to my mind when I think of any of their dishes. Not to forget they welcome you with a tribal drink.

POCKET PINCH - Quite affordable. For a group of 8 the bill was 2000 and for my 2nd visit we were 2 people and the bill was 500.

A big thumbs up from my side to Santa's fantasea. Must try!!

Nice, cosy place for a quiet sunday lunch. My husband and I were craving for seafood and we decided to try out this place. We ordered the seafood lemongrass soup, smoked fish, seafood rice and lobster in black bean sauce. The dishes were well prepared and good to taste. We were offered a welcome drink at first (aam panna) which was decent. Overall it was a fine experience except for the fact that we asked them to not put octopus in the soup and the did. When we requested them to change the soup, they did remove the octopus but the taste of the soup had funnily changed to a bland tasting hot water bowl. When we told them that, they did not show much interest in rectifying it. However, the food quality is good except for the soup! Plus the place is pocket friendly too.

This food joint is one of a kind and authentic.  The food compliments the decor and does not disappoint you. If you have a tongue that looks around for different flavours then Santa's Fantasea is the place to be. They have a variety of sea food and tribal delicacies that are really unique.
Recommended: seafood konkan salad, squid stuffed with fish along with seafood rice and smoked crab make a hearty meal. The Bnash Pora Mutton is one of my favourites with its smoky and earthy flavour and goes well with the shoru chakli roti . The Ngatok which is fish marinated in a exotic paste and served on a banana leaf is also a clear winner.
Thumbs up: they serve a welcome drink called tongo turani which is a fermented rice starch drink. Although the flavour might not suit many it's unique in its taste. They're also introducing the prawn payesh after a few weeks which is an incredible way to end your meal. Even though it'll be crowded most of the times the service provided by Mr.Koushik Ghosh and his team is commendable!

Zomato helped me discover this joint. I was searching for alternative cuisine - got bored with chines, continental and what not. Fantasea was an welcome change. Buoyed by excellent reviews on Zomato, I decided to check it out and was pleasntly surprised.¬†
Food is excellent and out of the ordinary, Bansha Pora with Soru chakli, Jhupu pishir mutton curry, Jadoh.. all turned out to be balanced, devoid of excess oil, and a taste which is new to my buds. Prawn sukha was tangy, spicy and playing to the galleries.¬†
Decor is innovative, its a quaint restaurant with good service, who smilingly help you with orders
Some dishes are not there in the menu - which needs an urgent update
We did not get any desserts too - How about some innovative tribal sweet dishes?
Would love to visit again to try out seafood delicacies ...

My daughter and her friends went for lunch on Sunday... they goobled up wild red rice, kori gassi and banshpora chicken.. I heard that they have stopped serving the welcome drink!

Having heard so much about Santa's Fantasea, I went the very next day I arrived in Calcutta. Here's my honest take.
Ambience
The first thing that struck me was the rather tacky decor right from the entrance. The rural look in the tribal section was fine but what put me off was the huge mural of a supposed tribal, a rather insensitive portrayal of the kind Hindi movies would do at one time, reducing them to some stereotypical caricature. I was appalled and unfortunately my mood was set. If anything, the food had to be bloody good. Unfortunately it failed to rise to the occasion as much as the decor did. Here are my impressions:
Starter:
Fried, crispy squid -- an oriental mishmash of red szechuan style sweet and hot sauce with chilli paste to explode a bomb. It was crispy no doubt but chewy as hell. First couple of mouthfuls were fine. The rest were a chore and the only thing I could taste was red chilli.
Main course:
Baanshpora mangsho: This was rather nice, with the smoky flavour holding its own. However, teh waiters should be trained to recommend the rice pancakes with the mutton.
Wild red rice: This is a conjob. There was nothing wild about it nor was it the red rice I was expecting. It was plain basmati rice coloured with red tomato paste and chilli paste and perhaps some orange colouring. Tasteless!
Fish smoked in Banana Leaves: No flavour of smoking because the spice paste was so strong and undercooked. Looked and tasted almost the same as the squid but with more of the orangey-red masala and the strong raw taste of ginger-garlic paste and excessive use of chilli paste marred any flavour that it may have had.¬† Tasteless.
Prawns Sukkha: Same taste as the fish and squid and same bright orangey red masala. If it was supposed to be Andhra cuisine, it failed the test and taste. Tasteless!
All in all a bad experience. The prices though were surprisingly low compared to the rather generous quantities and I suppose that's what makes the place run. All of the above came to just Rs 1000! Perhaps I'll go back to study the menu again and see what could really work for me.

Thank god my friends took me to this place ! I have never eaten such mesmerizing food. You smell culture in the food. The Bashphora, Prawn achari, the roti, smoked crab with oyester sauce,etc., you go on licking your fingers. The price is reasonable and the place looks cute. I have fallen for the food here. Such varieties. The taste of each dish takes you to another world. If you still havent been to this place, dont think twice,RUN RUN RUN ! The first tribal food corner in Kolkata, EXPLORE !

Even though the food here is nicely priced there are a couple of problems. Everything seems to be covered in a standard red sauce. Also avoid the 'red rice'. It is not red rice in the least and is basmati cooked in red paste. The owners don't seem to have any idea o what red rice is actually.

After going through a lot of reviews on Zomato,I visited this joint with my mother today with high expectations.
The restaurant is easy to locate,just a few steps from golpark anjali jewellers.The decor was simple and matched the theme of the place.we sat at the tribal section.We were welcomed with a cumin based welcome drink(wish it was cold since its the summers and sadly they didnt have ice)
Moving on we ordered their famous Shanghai Squid,Banspora Mutton and Jhulu Pithe. The squid was tasty but the schezwan sauce was too over-powering.The mutton was soft yet very dry,nonetheless tasted good.Jhulu pithe tasted fine.The bill was approx Rs 500 so its very easy on the pocket
The staff is very courteous and so was the owner however the food didnt match my expectations...so the next time I visit, i would go for Seafood strictly.
P.S. Desserts should be made available for people with a sweet tooth like me.

Jhingalalahoooo !!!!
If you are too cosmopolitan to travel to the interiors and taste what the local tribes eat, come to this place.... A posh representation of the simple ways !
The decor segregates the resto into 2 sections - Marine and village.
So it says at the very outset what cuisine it offers! 
It brings to us the food from the different tribes from all over the country. We went for popular choices - Banshpora mutton, Wild Rice, crab in ginger garlic sauce and smoked octopus. So it was goodies from both the worlds.
First thing to hit our table was the aam panna in wooden mugs. The drink's taste and flavour was marred by the overused flavour of wood. May be it was my cosmopolitan tongue acting posh !
Banshpora was really tender cubes of mutton served inside a bamboo stick. I hope they had truly cooked it inside those sticks where they serve from. The wild red rice was good but donot plan to eat it with banshpora as the bamboo dish is completely dry.
I tasted the best cooked octopus till date and I lived this dish the most out of the 4. 
And the last thing I wanted to speak about was the crab which smelled of shit. Literally shit ! We complained to the staff and he promised replacement. But I had no intention of eating again as my wife had pointed this out at the very end of my dinner and I had no intention of eating anymore. Anyways, I always end up eating double, thanks to my wife with her big appetite !
The bills came with a nice surprise though... It didnot contain the crab price !

Bansh Pora Served In A Burning Bamboo was great to see & good to eat .. Menu was definitely different & so was the food....Sea food rice was yummy, Julu Pitha was great too. Ambiance was cosy and ¬†Staff were attentive & courteous.
Restaurant is a must try HOWEVER Credit card has not been accepted so we had to go out to the nearest ATM under the scorching sun which was a mood dampner and why the menu card was torn to pieces, ¬†which instantly needs a replacement...
waiters reassured new menu is in the pipeline & "Onion-Payesh" would be the next star attraction.....Please start accepting cards & no torn menu card please.
No tax & service tax is charged and entire spread is priced reasonably....

It was hottest day of the season and it was an intense urge for having 'Bansa Pora'.. Ultimately latter one won..

We reached there around 12:45 noon.. This place is easy to locate.. Just take the lane beside Anjali Jwellers , Golpark..Walk for 0.75 minutes and you are at Santa's Fantasea..

After entering, we took our seat and within no minutes they served us bamboo made cups containing a soothing complementary drink which made us wintry..A bliss..! In asking they told that drink was made of ¬†cumin (jeera) n was called "Nimda".¬†

Then we ordered Bansa Pora and julu pitha.. Waiting time was unusually long, almost 25 minutes..While having food, we felt to order something else.. They suggested us to go for squid and persisted in us to have a out of menu dish, Shanghai Squid..

Bansa pora : 4.5/5 succulent spicy boneless mutton pieces with a smoky flavour served hot in hollow bamboo shell..

Julu pitha: 4/5 made by ground rice and stuffed with half egg n meat n spices..served with some acrid chilli sauce..

Shanghai Chicken : 3.5/5 batter fried squid in hot tangy chilli sauce..did not like it much for its fiery taste..

Service: Servers were attentive and polite. Service time was a bit longer.

Pocket pinch: Pocket friendly. No added tax. Food are worthy of that pricing.

Going soon to have Bansa pora and other mutton items.

Visited this twice....awesome experience...all the dishes are awesome....lipsmacking...be it smoked octopus...shanghai squid...bansa pora...arsa chhum ...wild red rice..julu pitha or crab momo...each and every dish is delicious...my favourites are shanghai squid...bansa pora and wild red rice. Arsa chhum...a preparation of chicken with lemon leaves and herbs is equally tasty..not rich or spicy.. light..yet so tasty. A wonderful seafood and tribal cuisine it is. And also it charges no tax.

Mercury was rising and looking for something light during lunch. Thought came across for Santa's Fantasea. Was expecting complimentary Thanka Turani on table but drink not been prepared now-a-days as due to high temperature prone fermentation. Instead we got jeera and pudina drink. Pretty ordinary.
In main course ordered their specialty Bansa Pora which are diced mutton pieces marinated and stuffed inside bamboo and cooked inside tandoor. I found it bit dry and lack taste of correct spices. Looks to me over hyped. Best accompanied with Soru Chaki which is not there in the menu cost INR 20. Soru Chaki is tasteless too.
No service tax or any other taxes are not charged or inclusive in amount mentioned in menu. 
Liked the tribal theme restaurant ambiance and price is reasonable. Staff are courteous.

I think this place is actually over-rated. I visited this place twice, first to taste the highly rated cuisine..and second to verify my taste buds. Yes the tribal cuisine is unique of a kind, but the overrated Bansa Pora is not such tasty as others claim it to be. First day I tried seafood, which I found not so tasty as those of other seafood restaurants available in Kolkata. And the next day I tried tribal. Korigassi was the only item I liked amongst the crab momo, bansa pora, lemon grass soup and the other dishes. This place is not even cheap as the quantity they serve is too little. And both days I found people standing by my table waiting in long queue. Overall not a great experience.
Visited again after about 8 months. This time taste improved remarkably and they have increased the quantity. Tribal section is better than the seafood section I guess. And now they make queue to wait outdoor. Thanks for that. Hence I inflate my rating.

Flavour of jungle picnic... very exceptional restaurent in terms of food variety. I have a very extraordinary experience in Santa Fantasea. I have tasted Bansa Pora which is a mutton item , Wild red rice and Ngatok which is a vetki preparation. All these are very delicious. Bansa pora mutton has a smell of smoke and that is very exceptional. Another specialily of this item it is not at all oily. Staffs are very gentle. Decoration of the restaurent is is also good. I will love to go again and again.

i've been waiting to go to this place for a long time now, and sometimes high expectations weigh down the experience...... NOT IN THIS CASE. wonderful ambiance, wonderful service, wonderful food, exceeded my expectations to be honest. i went with a friend, we were welcomed with a cool welcome drink :P , we ordered one plate of crab momos, one sanghai squid(not in the menu, u have to ask for it separately}, one korigassi, and one jadoh. the crab momo was a superb appetizer, and the sanghai squid is a must have if u visit the place, its super spicy and crispy. the korigassi might not have the best appearance but it is super soft, super jucy and super tasty. if ure ordering any kind of rice, ORDER A JADOH, u can thank me later, and one plate serves two super hungry people with huge appetites. when we were done we couldnt move, literally, we had eaten so much. we couldnt/didnt take the bansa pora and jhupu pisi's mutton delicacy though we wanted to so badly.. :P Next time surely.. :)

Good food and friendly staff. Keep up the good work. 
The tribal cuisine gets a recognition here. 
The decor too brings a fresh feel. 
Thursday night and full house in a nook in Golpark is definitely an achievent.

Till now all the reviews I have gone through have spoken very high . And I may be the first person to differ .  
Went for dinner yesterday night . The first thing I was served was the menu card ....held in one piece with two stripes of cello tape . The dishes we order ....other than the banshpora mutton , the pomfret and bhetki pora were just okay , nothing great . The banshpora mutton was undoubtedly outstanding .
The worst part was the washroom and the space to cross to reach the wash room . The kitchen at a glance was unhygienic , soiled plates were dumped on one side of the area one had to cross to reach the washroom . After crossing these once entered the washroom.....it was dirty and stinking like hell . 
No matter how good the food is , if the kitchen is unhygienic and the toilet stinks , I have no plans to visit such place twice

This place is, in short, great value for money. I had gone there with my friends. The one-of-a-kind decor with bamboos and paintings certainly made the ambiance pleasant. Their welcome drink (complimentary) was soothing and refreshing. We ordered a thai seafood salad and a cheesy tuna salad at first, both of which were great. Then for the main course we had baansh pora mutton, mackerel fish and rice noodles. Everything was yummy, although their signature dish baansh pora mutton wasn't exceptional. Since our bill had exceeded a thousand rupees, we were given a free squid dish whose name escapes me at the moment - it was basically crisply fried squid. I loved this one. All in all, a great place where you can stupefy yourself with tasty food without burning a hole in your pocket.

Yesterday 6 of us visited the place in the evening. If you want to grab a seat as soon as you reach the place I would suggest to reach the place by 7.30 PM on week ends. There are only two six seated tables , rest are all four or two. We had a 3 and half year old in the group so ordered fish in white sauce and saru chakli for her. Which she liked so much that almost finished the entire quantity to our great amazement ! :) So families visiting the place with young baccha party you could give it a try. Coming to our order-1) Crab fried momo- 6 pieces per plate, good taste, worth a try 2) Lal gosht - They look like cutlets. Made of small pieces of mutton and some other stuff. Good to taste but little spicy. 3 pieces are served on a plate3) Smoked fish- It was perfectly cooked in little sauce, having lemon grass and lemon leaves . Very tasty , a must try. Around 10-12 pieces in a plate 4) Bansa pora-¬† We know that this is the signature dish of this place . But this time the typical burnt flavor was very strong so , those in the group who tasted the same first time didn't like it. It goes best with Saru Chakli, which is not mentioned in the menu card. They are very soft rotis made of rice flour each costing around Rs.20 if I am not making a mistake. 5) Patra Pora- This was small boneless pieces of mutton cooked wrapped in banana leaf. Great taste. One must try ! Quantity was also quite good. 6)Jadoh Rice - Red rice with mutton chunks. It looked very spicy but surprisingly it was not !¬†Different taste and goes very well with Patra Pora. The signature drink of tankha turani which is usually served as welcome drink was missing. Instead something like nimbu paani was served. Cold drinks are available but no ice-cream. The sweet dish segment need some serious work as there is hardly any choice available. Overall experience is very good. Pocket pinch will make the person paying the bill very happy ! Inclusive of everything we paid around Rs.2,200 for a wonderful evening spent with near and dear ones.¬†:)

TRIBAL Food ...!!! and that too at heart of the city...!!! Hard to believe but that's the fact...Santa's Fantasea...they have made it possible !! The name has been buzzing around the foodies' networking sites for last couple of months or so. Now, being a ultimate gourmate, naturally , I couldn't refrain myself from visiting the joint.
The eatery is moderate to small, in size. Decor is quite innovative...wall painting is on the theme of under ocean and tribal hut. Dining Table and chairs are made out of bamboo which is certainly not cozy. However,I must say that the idea of decoration is out of the box . On arrival, you will be served with Aam panna serbat (earlier they used to serve some tribal drinks) which is served in a special kindda mug made of bamboo. Now, coming to food... I'm not sure if there is any other restaurant in Kolkata , serves tribal food . Also ,I won't comment on the degree of authenticity of the dishes, this eatery serves under the name of tribal dishes. On the contrary, I just can assure you that they serve very different and rare kindda lip smacking palate... We had ordered,
‚äô Smoked Pomphret - baked pomphret fish in a tangy kindda sauce base with lemon leaves and other herbs.
‚äô Laal Gosht - Ball shape chops made out of minced mutton and herbs. Dry item.
‚äô Julu Pitha - fluffy bread stuffed with egg and minced mutton.
‚äô Bansh Pora - small boneless mutton pieces wrapped inside bamboo, cooked in charcoal . It's got smoky aroma of bamboo and charcoal.
‚äô Jadoh Rice - Well...I would like to name this as "Tribal Biriyani" ... Red colored rice cooked with small pieces of mutton and herbs.
All of the dishes taste very different from the typical cusinies, easily available in city. A must visit joint for foodies who like to experiment.
N.B. : They serve sea foods as well. Gonna grab my share of oceanic delicacies on my next visit.

this nice,cosy restaurant serves food which is easy on the pocket yet lip smacking good.hte staff are courteous,even the owner comes down to interact,giving it a homely feel.the decor is tastefully done,the masks adorning the walls add a tribal ambience to the place.the welcome drink didnot suit my taste,nevertheless rest of the fare compensated for it.the banspora mutton with tender juicy mutton alongwith the aroma of bamboo can be the sole reason i would like to go back again.nagatok,a fish dish was good too.rice was sufficient for two.we couldnot try out the seafood,but going back to try out squids,octopus,lobsters and crabs..

Big disappointment on the seafood front the menu said Kingfish and the fish they served was some river fish. Kingfish is what they serve in Goa. Please Google Kingfish...its called surmai in Marathi and konkani... Basa pora was good. The bamboo Glasses in which they served the welcome drink looked unhygenic. The restaurant floor was filthy..probably not cleaned for a long time. We had basa pora, bhetki in tangy sauce, squids, kingfish fry jadoh rice which the waiter insisted probably it was ready. The service was quick..staff insists on the food that is actually easier for them to cook..ask them something different from the menu it was unavailable..trust me guys there is no seafood available in here other than lobster and squids.

This place is located in the adjacent lane to anjali jewellers in golpark and is an absolute paradise for seafood lovers. I have been here only once but it was enough for me to get bowled over by their food. I had this place in my wishlist from a long time and so when I and my friend met at golpark one afternoon we decided on trying out this place. My friend had already tried the place earlier and she sounded very positive .The ambience of this place is nice....giving an overall tribal feeling with huge wall arts and paintings. The sitting arrangement is cozy and comfortable and though the place maximum has a sitting of 20,everything is arranged in a very proper manner with a friendly and corteous staff.The management definitely deserves a clap! But the highlight of this restaurant is definitely the unique food items. We started with their sanghai squid(though not very sure of the name)and it was one of a kind. It was mouth watering from the first go and I also liked the presentation. The squid were cooked to perfection and we enjoyed this dish immensely. For the main course we tried the patra pora which was a mutton dish served in banana leaf,and this dish was quite lip smacking too. We had our mutton with the rice roti and the whole taste was bliss inside the taste buds. Also they served us with a complementary drink,which was quite warm, though it tasted interesting. This place is extrmely pocket friendly and cheap when compared with the quality of food served. Both of us enjoyed ourselves immensely.This has become one of my favourite places for dining just after a visit and I am definitely going back to try the other seafood dishes and definitely the squid.

Somehow I was so very against this restaurant.May be it's the name or whatever,I always kept making excuses when somebody asked me to go there.But then one day,my friends and I finally decided to drop in and IT COMPLETELY CHANGED MY MISCONCEPTION.They serve you a welcome drink which,to be very honest,is not that great,it's bland.We had ordered Thai Seafood soup(as momos weren't available),Crispy fried prawn,chicken in green sauce(yes,somebody actually ordered chicken in a seafood joint),mixed seafood rice,veg rice,jadoh,smoked squid,and a new squid dish that they were serving at that time.The thai food soup was amazing with loads of squid and octopus pieces in it.The crispy fried prawns lived up to their name.The mixed seafood rice and chicken were really tasty.The smoked squid was amazing with that extra bit of kick from the chillies.But the standouts were the jadoh(it's basically a spicy rice with loads of lil mutton pieces in it) and that new squid dish(it was crispy and succulent and super tasty).And now coming to the veg rice...I don't have words to describe it.I can assure you that I have never tasted a more pathetic dish than this before.It's basically stamed rice with corn starch poured over it with a few capsicums.They should immediately take it off from the menu.My overall experience was quite great,although I was not satisfied with the quantity.But I would definitely like to visit again.

Went in with a lot of expectations.Full family.Large appetite.Ordred bansh pora,patra pora and lal gosht in mutton dishes,kukhura ko masu(chicken),Ngatok( Fish) and Julu Pitha.Now I am partial to enterpreneurial brilliance as well as the guts they showed in launching a tribal menu.But why mix seafood and tribal food in the menu?And food from North East without Pork?Does not work.
Coming back to the food,the mutton dishes were uniformly good,with banshpora deservedly being top notch.The lal gosht was good too.
The fish was bland.And the chicken was bland and tasteless with lots of star anise clearly cooked in a hurry.
I would request management to improve cleanliness in washroom and in general and maybe include pork in their menu.But will go back to taste the remaining tribal items someday.

We entered Santa's Fantasea half-wet on a rainy evening right after a long session of swimming. Naturally, being extremely hungry, we ordered the mutton coconut soup, bansh pora, octopus in chilli garlic sauce, rice, and voksa meh, mutton with bamboo shoots, since I love Bamboo shoots. They served us a complimentary glass of Tankha Turani first, which was a mildly sour rice drink, and tasted wonderful, perfect to make us feel more hungry. This was followed by a light, coconutty soup with mutton, fragrant with herbs, and light, a stunning smoky mutton inside a hollowed out bamboo shoot, octopus, which was fresh and tasty, if slightly overcooked (but then that's me), and a plate of mutton in a light gravy with plenty of bamboo shoots and a spicy kick from fresh chillies, which went perfectly with the plain rice. Service was prompt and the decor is quirky and fun.

Update: Oh they are going to make Chingrir payesh and it will be in their new menu from June. Also, the smoked octopus and lal maas were very very good today, enough to make me want to snatch some away from my friend.

After a long day my bestie took me there. It was a very hot day , so we ordered banshpora, jadho, smoked prawn, baked fish and green flat sea food noodles. Each of the item was with an unique signature taste and when you put in your mouth it gives a bursting of flavors. Before tasting I thought smoked prawn and grilled fish were almost same in taste. But I simply awestruck with the taste of smoked prawn , it was a great combination of meyo and cheese with a hint of gondho raj lebu. Each dishes comes with an surprise of taste which was very enjoyable and satisfy your soul.

The rave reviews about this place made me eager to visit this restro‚Ä¶it has been on my wishlist for quite a long time‚Ä¶but wasn't able to make a visit due to the exam pressure‚Ä¶:-(‚Ä¶as exams are over, now m a free bird n finally head towards this place few days ago‚Ä¶:-)
Time:- 7.25pm
Ambience n decor:- It is divided into two sections‚Ä¶on entering i was quite happy to see the lovely decor‚Ä¶the first section is painted in blue colour  along with the picture of octupus n sea creatures‚Ä¶the next one is decorated with the tribal masks n idols‚Ä¶
we setteled ourselves in the tribal section‚Ä¶only two tables were occupied except us‚Ä¶

FOOD:- here is the main part the food‚Ä¶They gave us the complimentry drink TANKHA NURANI‚Ä¶which is a liquid form of rice along with some spices‚Ä¶though it was refreshing but i didnt liked it that much‚Ä¶
BANSA PORA- heard loads of appreciation about the famous bansa pora‚Ä¶it is basically small boneless marinated pieces of mutton cooked in bamboo‚Ä¶even though m not a mutton lover at all,for the first time in a restro i orderd for a mutton preparation‚Ä¶n thank god i wasn't dissapointed at all‚Ä¶i loved the flavour,the taste was really good ‚Ä¶but 
i think they can work on the quantity‚Ä¶for 300 bucks the portion is not good‚Ä¶
SPECIAL ROOTI:- the bangalis are very much familiar with this kind of ruti because it is similar to the suru chakli we make in our home during the winter‚Ä¶it went very well the mutton‚Ä¶ the Julu pitha wasn't available at that time‚Ä¶ i was dissapointed with this fact cause i was dying to have julu pitha‚Ä¶ :-( :-(‚Ä¶
But nevertheless i'll try this next time for sure‚Ä¶

Service:- The staff was cordial,well behaved,n helpfull extra marks for that‚Ä¶:-)

Pocket pinch:- It was quite a pocket friendly affair‚Ä¶best part they dont charge any taxes‚Ä¶:-D

Would like to visit again n try their other delicacies including the sea food‚Ä¶:-)

One word for this outlet ..... Brilliant !!
I've been reading a lot of their reviews and the basa-pora mutton is a key feature so it just lured me.

Let's just begin with food . The mutton was mind blowing . Tender, not a drop of oil and oozing with smoky flavor . The rice drink they served as a welcome drink was really soothing . The server recommended Shanghai squid and it was top notch . Perfectly cooked and well balanced.

The smoked pomfret was ok I didn't like it too much . And we ordered the banana leaf fish with was outstanding again .

The place is done up well and I simply loved the inner room with tribal theme decor . The asymmetrical wood chairs are a very nice touch and the bamboo coffee mug is awesome .

The owners have put in a lot of attention to detail and the love shows . Coming back again soon .

Kudos!

Well...Once upon a time in kolkata three hungry souls entered a seafood n tribal food paradise at 9 ballygunge terrace and came out satisfying their palate.....kudos to the concept of bringing tribal food cuisine in the heart of the city.We were welcomed with a complimentary glass of a tribal rice drink from orissa.....well that was only for cleaning the palate and sensitising the taste buds.Seeing such a huge collection of non conventional cuisines we thought of fusing the both....n bingo! we were right.The bansa pora consisting of minced mutton cooked tenderly in a bamboo shoot with a hint of smoked bamboo flavour bowled us over...before we could shrug out of its tantalising flavour out next order of smoked octopus was on the table.!!! It was awesome...A perfect blend of smoky flavour with tinge of lemon grass n other exotic herbs!!!...Our next ventures were shanghai squid n cheesy tuna salad....The squid was sweet sour n crispy with a tinge of pepper..A chefs delight n a foodie's dream...tuna salad with loads of cheese and mayonese made the combination more interesting. ..The seafood mixed rice was even more delightful and with the fish in white sauce it just melted in my oral cavity.....as a whole Santa's fantasea made my evening...The staffs r really good n fast in serving. ..and a bonus was a polite greeting from the owner and his query about the quality of the food....We entered as hungry souls and came out with our heart and gut fully satisfied and our pocket still full.The decoration and ambience was artistically crafted and blended nicely with the food....A must visit for me n my family n friends every weekends.Only one con is that their quantity is average..but then again a pocket friendly restaurant may be pardoned for this and they make up for this by their quality.Still Yeh Dil mange more...4.5 for their honest and sincere cuisines. N.B- We also ordered jadoh, squid with basil n lal gosht that day....no more review for them...A re yaar..,,, kichu review lekhar jonyo baki der keo to chance dite hobe....

If you want to taste something different then Santa's fantasea is the place to go to.. 
Located near Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. The specialty of the joint is tribal and sea food. The food is very good, service is good but the ambience really steals the show. The complimentary drink is a special drink to start with. Having its roots in Orissa 'thanka turani' is a simple drink with an outstanding flavour of curry leaves. 
The main course was a mix of tribal and sea food cuisine. We started off with 'steamed momos stuffed with crab meat' which is a must have as a starter. The 'soru chakli' and 'bansh pora' is a compulsory if you planning for a visit here. Mixed sea food rice and smoked promfret are also very good and can be used as alternatives. The main attraction is tribal food which is a must have.
In short if you are planning for a family dinner this place is really awesome.

To start with...this is a lovely place to go and eat food. 
I am not a sea food lover and i never had the idea of tribal food either. 
But this place enables me to seek more of tribal food now. 
The decor is good. It has that sea and tribal decor. The staff is good too. They attend you very nicely. 
Starting with the food, they give you a conplimentary drink named as "Thanka Turani" which is a tribal rice drink from Orissa. 
Starting with the starters.. We ordered for
"Steamed Crab momos". For the main course, we ordered for "Wild red rice" and "Korigassi" which are tribal dishes. 
I must say the food is really good and it deserves more customers to visit it again and again. 
Everything is perfect here. And i am definitely visiting it again sooner.

First of all, little difficult to find unless you have google maps. But don't go with a high expectation, which i did actually, cz its not a that fancy huge restaurant. I would rather classify it as a classic one. First of all we were greeted by a special item from odisha, tunka torani (if you are oriya, you would love it, cz i did). Anyway I went there to try octopus and squid for the first time. So it was very awkward to choose which dish to order. Thanks to the suggestions of the waiter we had octopus garlic chilly and smoked squid. squid was good i didn't feel like eating anything awkward. But octopus, you gotta try it on your own :D. Both the items were very tasty. Coming to main course, we ordered bansa poda mutton with soru chakli. Its was splendid and soru chakli ( a kind of soft roti ), was so soft that it will melt in your mouth right away. So over all it was a very good experience and most importantly the menu card has very reasonable price for each item. though i found bansa poda little over priced considering the amount.

SO thats it, Go guys n girls have an octopus, and let me know whether it goes down your throat or sticks there (just kidding) :D

Basically i got the reference from one of my FB friend and was planning to visit there..! It is situated in Golpark.. The ambiance proved 'the first impression is the last impression' quote .. :) Awesome decoration.. neat and clean.. hospitality is appreciable.. ¬† If you are planning to visit Tribal corner here is the master place..!!!!!.. Firstly the complimentary ¬†Welcome drink 'Tanka Turami' is very refreshing and all our stress were gone.. We ordered Squid in Chilli Garlic Sauce which was crispy and yummy .. Masala Mackrel ..mmm not wat we expected :( Red rice noodle .. as usual very good.. And here comes the food-stopper of the day 'Bansh pora' a must try dish.. Basically cooking in bamboo shoot is very famous in Arunachal.. And this dish is one of the pride of Kolkata i must say..  this is just the trailer.. Picture abhi baki hai mere dost ;) Some awesome experiences are waiting for you !!!! :) \\m//

NOT JUST SANTA'S, THE "FANTASEA" IS YOURS TOO
Hidden in a quite and inconspicuous neighborhood, this two roomed tribal food den is not just Santa's but can be everyone's "fantasea" after the first visit. The first thing that will draw your attention is the decor, viz., richly tribal with walls painted to look like mud walls. The most striking of all that is the huge mirror which rests on the wall facing a the huge glass window on the other side. The paintings on the walls and ceiling is indicative enough of the authenticity of the place.
With satisfactory service and excellent food the bamboo tables will surely call you back time and again to this place.
Crab momo, mixed seafood rice and smoked sea vetki escalades the climax at lunch.
Next time I would love to taste some octopus there.

It was a great experience , though we had to wait outside for about 20 mins as all the tables were full. We had ordered bansh pora with soruchakli which was awesome !!!!! Then the seafood part i.e. the mixed seafood rice and smoked fish , it was a real different taste , loved it ! Planning for a second visit ! Oh , u get a drink called the "tankha turani" as complimentary ! Do visit and try their "bansh pora".

Tucked in a small bylane near Golpark, this two-roomed restaurant boasts of probably the most ¬†unique yet pocket friendly menu in the city. The interiors are tribal themed with fish installations, and the tables have cheeky headlines from a leading daily. We started off with the complimentary Tankha Turani, with its strong fermented flavour, served in quirky bamboo tumblers. The Bansa Pora is a must try, especially with the Wild Red Rice. The meat cooked inside retained its flavours while remaining all succulent and smoky. The Mixed Seafood Flat Noodles had the right proportions of squid and prawn, and balanced out the extremely spicy Octopus in Garlic Chilli Sauce. The Squid in basil was equally good. However the best dishes had to be the crabs. We'd ordered the Baked Crab and Crab in Coco Lime Sauce. They were the soft shelled variety, and we even got the large claws on request. The meat was perfectly cooked and we soon had a pile of shells on our plates ( probably the messiest seafood ever!), but I couldn't stop raving about it. We decided to end the meal with a second order of Bansa Pora- it is THAT good. Overall it is a great place to hang out when you get the munchies and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket.

Before going into too much of details, I am claiming that this place will turn into a legend one day.
First, the food. Tanka Turami, a rise drink from Odisha, will take away all your frustration of the hardworking day with a sip. They will offer it free. I will not say more about the Bansa Pora. You have to taste and witness this awesomeness. It is a must to order dish. The jhupupisi mutton was splendid and will have enough potential to satisfy your taste-bud with couple of soruchakali ( roti made with rice). I have tasted the smoked octopus too. But i cannot compare it because it was my first time having octopus. However, it was great in taste.
Second, the hospitality. You will never feel that you are having food outside your home. They have created a friendly environment which will give them sustainable competitive advantages. If you need any information about the food, they are happy to share.
Lastly, I would say, an evening well spent.

nestled in an alley beside anjali jewellers golpark, this establishment boasts of simple but trendy decor a.w.a dishes.the staff was very polite and hospitable with one gentleman even enquiring about the culinary experience. funny how little things like these work a long way!! food was good but i only sampled seafood as octopus in garlic chilli sauce and squid stuffed with fish. portions are generous and fulfilling but way too much garlic in octopus.maybe it provides the zing with the munchy tentacles! tip- the complimentary odhiya rice drink offered seems bland on first sip but combined with spicy seafood serves as palate cleanser. try fusion of tribal and sea. squid was... munchy. both dishes are spicy so carbs (rice /noodles/ pasta)are must. will return to try only tribal items next. good for a first run and value for money.

Santa's fantasea , situated near anjali jewellers , golpark was a well known restaurant to me for its decor... its has two section, one for sea food and the other is for trival food... all the chairs and tables were of bamboos. .. but to my surprise it was one of my best seafood restaurants... a special drink was on the house .... we ordered julu pitha and shanghai squid to start... and we had bansh pora , red seafood rice .. and those were delicious. .. bansh pora was served in a burning bamboo , which was very much innovative. .. and service was very good... ambience was homely .... and the most important thing is that at the end of the day the bill was  650 only... we will surely visit this place again and again...

Food with a twist. The place is owned by the same people as ectasea. So quality and value for money are assured. The menu has two sections. Tribal food from orissa and Andhra and the other section has seafood. Which is very different from what is available in most of the restaurants in the city. Still i would suggest to stick to the tribal food. As ectasea has far more variety when it comes to seafood. Although both are equally yummy. Must try is the bansa pora which is a meat dish smoked inside a bamboo shoot. Tastes awesome. The tankha turani which was a welcome drink. I personally didnt like it much. The lal gosht was average. The sukha prawn and smoked octopus were yummy. The octopus had kafir lime leaves in it which was a pleasant surprise and the prawn was cooked in mustard oil which added a nice zing to it. The wild red rice was a nice accompaniment. And the mixed flat noodles was full of different kinds of seafood  which we could taste in every bite. Place is worth a visit

For starters this is situated in absolutely very convenient location. The ambience is cool. Sums up the feeling of tribal with its decor.. We ordered bansa pora. It was awesome.. The welcome was different in taste.. The mixed seafood rice tasted good .. Flavours were mild yet distinguished. Octopus in chili garlic sauce is very tasty.. We also ordered wild rice.. It was a bit spicy but went well in combo with bansa pora. Overall the restaurant is a price cutting one.. The service was fairly quick...

This is at golpark. A bit difficult to find out to find out. You have to enter the lane beside anjali jewllers and walk for 30sec. It has got a tottaly new theme that is tribal foods of bengal. I am glad that some people has taken such an initiative to focus on tribal foods. 
They have two sections one is marine, another is tribal. The decor is really good. It will make u feel anxious about the food also. But my review will have also two parts.
Tribal food : (rating 5/5) 
they offer a free welcome drink tankha turani in bamboo glasses. Its Unique in taste. We tried their bansa pora , patra pora, with rice flour roti. Both were mutton disheses. Taste was super duper delicious. I loved it. And if u vist bansa pora is a must try and do ask for the roti as they dont hav it in menu book. They marinate mutton quiet well and bake it within piecce of bamboo in tandoor. You will juz love the smokey mutton chunks when served. Also we had julupitha which was a stuffed bread and of great taste.
Seafood : (rating 3/5)
I tried their seafood a month ago. I orderd tuna salad, smoked crab, seafood noodles. I found bone in tuna salad. Crab was without flesh , reason being it was not fresh. Both dishes were good in taste but lacked proper fresh ingredient. They must improve it. 

Again i will recomend to evryone to try their bansapora and julupitha.

This place is unique in its concept and themes..I think probably this is the only full-fledged Tribal Restaurant in the city..It can given full rating based on the sheer uniqueness of its concept and its unorthodox decor..Appropriately in line with its theme they are serving some superlicious,unique and authentic tribal cuisine and seafoods to all seafood lovers like me at the cheapest possible rates..A paradise for seafood lovers as they serve everything from octopus to squid to kingfish to mackrel to crabs and lobsters...
Coming to the food,I have tasted:
Lal Gosht: Boneless Mutton Balls cooked to perfection,spicy,soft and tender..
Green Seafood Flat Noodles: Quite unique,liked the taste of flat noodles..
Smoked Squid: Tangy flavour,loved the assortment of spices..well balanced flavours..
Prawn Sukha: Another perfect combination of spices..prawns are impressive in size
Fish in Green Tangy Sauce and Chicken Keong tasted great as well..
Overall service is flawless,the owner himself is very courteous and humble..just one point to mention almost all their dishes are a bit too spicy and hot..so may not be ideal for some foodies..
Food: 5/5
Pricing: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

If you want to try out Tribal Food you may choose to be in this place.. Average Rating...
Bansa Pora: Its a smoked Mutton Dish in a Bamboo frame. I personally dint like it much. I felt as if 5000 cigarettes were crushed to make this dish.Jokes apart, ¬†actually one who loves to taken in the smoked flavour would definitely love it.
Tankha Turani: ¬†I felt it was bit sour. This could be the actual taste but I didnt like this too.
Kori Gasi - Its actually a name of a Kerala dish which you can try out in Tamarind Resto as well but the colour and the flavour of this dish is completely different from what you get in Kerala. I liked it.
Rice Roti - Thats typical ghola roti made of rice powder and few coriander leaves. No taste at all.
Veg Wild Red Rice - One can definitely try this one out but Jadoh i think could be better than this n can be tried by non veg foodies.

Update: Visited a couple of times since then....once with my aunt, when we ordered Seafood rice noodles (resembled something like gravy noodles) accompanied with Sesame Chilly Fish and Mongolian Fish. Both the side dishes were filling. The next time I met a school friend of mine after 25 years....our grand reunion was celebrated again with their popular dish Bansa Pora mutton, though this time I felt that the quality had dropped a few notches from the previous year. The meat was great only till it was hot; once it returned to room temperature it became like plain mutton, devoid of any aroma or taste. We ordered Wild Red Rice too, which was similar to my previous experience. As side, we opted for another item which had gained repute: Jhupu Pishi‚Äôs Mutton Delicacy (a Mizo smoked mutton dish with mustard leaves ‚Äì it‚Äôs locally known as Voksa Rep Chum). The other tribal dish we tried out was Ngatok from Nagaland (fish cooked without oil, marinated with aromatic herbs inside banana leaf ‚Äì akin to a Bengali paturi). It was quite good and I can recommend it.

                        I wanted to treat my cousin who is totally into seafood, so we decided to try out this restaurant in March 2015. I had seen its reviews on Zomato earlier, as well as noticed the place while visiting Golpark‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a few metres on the left along the lane beside Anjali Jewellers. I rung up prior to leaving home to reserve a table for the three of us. Complimentary beverages (a fermented rice drink seasoned with mustard) were offered to us as soon as we arrived. We ordered Lal Gosht (3 reddish-looking mutton chops), Bansa Pora (their signature mutton preparation), Wild Red Rice (a veg. fried rice from Nagaland), Sukha Prawn (not quite dry, but sapid nonetheless) and Crabs (mud-Crab legs). All the dishes were flavoursome. I would very much recommend this place to anyone who is weary of the ubiquitous Chinese/Tandoori restaurants and wishes to explore some other forms of cuisine‚Ä¶in this case, tribal and the North-East.

Santa's Fantasea may not boast of a great ambience but when it comes to quality food, this little restaurant in golpark is outstanding. They have a seafood and tribal section with beautifully painted walls. The decor is very picturesque. We were welcomed with refreshing drinks on the house. First off, we ordered Bansh Pora in which they served marinated mutton, cooked and served in a bamboo stick. Even though they specialise in seafood, we were taken back by its remarkable taste. Truly mutton can't get any better. The julu pitha( stuffed bread with keema and boiled egg) turned out to be a bit bland. However the Red Seafood rice was very good and the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the meal was the Shanghai Squid, which left us craving for more. Also among the other dishes we ordered, Smoked Crab, Octopus in chilli garlic sauce, korigrassi, chicken pataya, Seafood Clear soup are worth mentioning. Now coming to the prices, we were mighty pleased witht the bill, a meal for two cost us only 650 rupees. You dont come across a place that serves such quality food and that too so cheap. Service is very prompt and the staff quite polite. Even the manager enquired us if we were enjoying the food. Definitely worth many many more visits.

On Holi evening, when most food places are closed, we could locate Santa's Fantasea with little help from them and were warmly received. Though it is located slightly off main road near Golpark but can be easily accessed.¬†
The menu is unique, offering tribal food. Bold step indeed. Steward was friendly and extended right suggestion for two of us. Bansa pora, Julu pitha & wild red rice. Bansa pora was yummy, mutton was tender and had smoky bamboo aroma. Julu Pitha is unique, the bread had flavour of slight fermentation. A bowl of soup and Julu pitha is light dinner itself. Rice was normal. What we liked most is courtesy of staff and their willingness to educate us with different cuisine. Enjoyed.

Went there for a birthday dinner. Recommended by a friend of mine for their delicious food . My family was a bit sceptical about trying sea food and tribal food as we had no idea how it will taste. Tha place is nice . Nice decoration. The waiter was polite and helped us with the orders. The welcome drink was okayish. We ordered sea food soup. Iy was pretty yum. The sea food was properly cooked and was not smelly. Then we ordered the famous bansa pora with chikli roti. It was awesome too. We had smoked octopus which tasted okay. Red and green fried rice tasted good too. The most amazing thing that we tried was the baked fish. It was served freshly baked with full of cheese and white sauce base. The fish was so tender it almost melted in mouth.
Overall a nice experience..would love to come back again and try other foods on the menu.

Santa's fantasea, located just a few blocks from anjali jewelers is a unique place serving ocean and tribal cuisine . Recently went there with my girlfriend and was really excited to try this place out. Atmosphere was soothing and not at all crowded. 

We sat down and was served with a drink called thunka, a very simple drink prepared from fermented rice and we both really liked it. First we wanted to try out tribal cuisine and ordered bas pora and special roti(rice bread ) . Bas pora, small mutton bits marinated and Cooked inside a bamboo steam, has its unique taste and flavour. There is a hint of bamboo smell evrytime you take a bit of this dish. It tastes good with there spacial recommended roti.

Then, from sea food section we tried out "Thai mixed seafood noodle salad" and smoked fish. I liked the salad and would recommend others to try out. Smoked fish, was tangy with a hint of lemon leaves and soft boneless bhetki. . Also a good dish to try out!
A good place and definitely want to come back to try out some other dishes.. Specially lobsters. :)
Thumbs up,!

Uniqueness is its USP is what i felt. From ambiance to food fare, this is a very diff eatery from regular eateries and restaurants. Food here is from unexplored tribal and rural cuisines round India. 5 star to them on this idea.Now coming to the food, its delightful. I m a crab aficionado but lil disappointed wid the grill crab, Other than that fish, Kerala mutton curry and another cutlet of mutton whose name i cant recollect, was quite awesome.¬†Definite Visit.

Update 2 :

Disappointed.
Shangai squid was a let down with over fried pieces of squid. Bansh pora chicken was dry and lacked flavors.
Seafood beijing rice was so bad that we had to request it for change.
Saving grace was chilli dried prawn. It was wonderful. ! Somehow it saved the day. Along with it supporting cast was Jadoh rice. Somewat good@.

Tread with caution while ordering your food.

This is new concept restaurant specialized in tribal and seafood cuisine. Conveniently located in Golpark , SF offers wide spread of delicacies which are rare in the city. Actually you have to visit a couple of times before actually rating this place. My first tryst with SF was nice. We had bansh pora mutton with rice flour roti. Also we tried squid. Both the dishes were tasty and quantities were apt. I am looking forward to visit the place again soon.

The seating area is fairly compact but it shouldn't deter you from trying some delectable, non mainstream offerings coming in generous quantities at wallet friendly rates. ¬†
Did Santa's Fantasy satiate my lust for seafood ?  Well, it gave me a jolly good reason to look beyond a one night stand  ;)

Bengalis have a long-standing love affair with food plucked from watery depths, but even in a city where you can't go five steps without finding a "maach bhaat-er hotel" and or a swanky 5-star seafood restaurant, Santa's Fantasea has found a nice niche for itself, by serving seafood with a twist.

Leaving aside the bhetki paturis and shorshe ilish maaches for places like Bhojohori Manna and Bong Connection, Santa's Fantasea's seafood menu veers towards the offbeat and the eclectic - typically Bengali fish and prawns vie for competition against squid, octopus and crabs, often all in one dish, in a mesmerizing symphony of textures and flavors.

We tried out the Konkan seafood salad (cool, crunchy, subtle flavors), the fish-stuffed squid (extraordinary), octopus in garlic chilly sauce (flavorful, interesting textures), mixed flat hakka noodles (perfect accompaniment to the stronger side dishes) and fried ice cream. 

It's pretty affordable, if you order well (the portions are quite large). I'm looking forward to going back for the seafood momos, the cheesy tuna salad and some crab.

This restaurant was on our wish list for quite sometime. Finally today we managed to drop there for lunch.
Location: in the lane adjacent to Anjali jewelers, golpark. The ground floor of an apartment is modified to create the restaurant. 
Ambience : the restaurant has two sections,tribal and sea food. There are some 5 tables in tribal themed room,and around 4/5 tables in the seafood themed room.
Food : The choices are quite many, as well as unconventional.
We started with Kerala mutton soup: which was pleasantly different. Even I got hints of gondhoraj lebu.
Next we had lal gosht,that's awesome, loved it.
For main course we ordered bansha pora,special rooti, mixed sea food fried rice.
Bansha pora is nice,though different.quantity is good.
Didn't like the special rooti.
The mixed sea food fried rice was OK.
We ended with crispy fried prawns. I liked the batter,the prawn also seemed fresh,but   some more spice and marination should be allowed to get infused in the fish.
Service: not satisfactory, should be improved.
One of us arrived late,he was not given or offered the welcome drink.
On asking repeatedly napkins and water was not served.
Only one person was taking orders. So once the place was getting filled,service was getting delayed.
Price: for 3 of us, the bill was 1070 inr,which is quite reasonable
Overall : good experience.

Few days back I decided to visit the restaurant after seeing the reviews in Zomato. I visited the restaurant with my mom and dad for a lunch. Ok to start I really liked the decorations and all. They first gave us a drink which was a tribal drink named Tankaa Turani. To be honest I didn't like the drink much. Then we ordered Shanghai Squid for starters. Then we ordered Baansh Pora Mutton, Tuna Masala,  Smoked Pomfret and mixed sea food fried rice. Ok the shanghai squid was just brilliant as well as the other items. Mutton, Tuna and Pomfret was awesome as well. The food quality was brilliant. One of the best seafood restaurant I have been into and that too at such a low price. Would recommend you to go if you are looking for a good seafood restaurant.

From where should I start? Uniqueness? Taste? Ambiance? Service? Quality? Quantity? Value-for-money?
To be precise, they score a steady 4.5 out of 5 in each of these pillars!
A never-seen-before menu card with almost 40% of items which are probably available in no other restaurant in the city, signature being the tribal food.
Superbly tasty. Tender meat. Unique flavour. Unbelievable!
Ambiance is made tribal in True sense. Typical tribal paintings on walls, appropriate wooden tables and chairs. Electricity and AC are the only odds reminding its unreality!
Small restaurant. Small space. Limited tables. Only one service guy! Smart enough to manage it all. He has detail knowledge of the dishes and helps selecting the right one. Fast service.
Enough quantity. It will never make you feel pain in pocket.
Quality food. Quality presentation. Properly cooked meat. Just perfect.
Extremely value for money. No tax till now. Below average price with respect to the total service offered.
My experience -
Tankha Turani - served free as welcome drink. Fantastic.
Kerala mutton soup - excellent dish. Better than any chicken soup I have ever tasted! Unbelievable!
July Pitha - interesting delicacy. A good quick bite.
Bansa Pora - totally unique! Unique flavour of bamboo fused in boneless tender mutton. Memorable!
Patra Pora - another unique one! As the name explains, flavour of burnt banana leaf is fused in spiced mutton.

Area of improvement - washroom can be made cleaner and better decorated and maintained.

Overall experience - Outstanding! This is probably the only restaurant of its own kind in the city.

Suggestion - Needs to be promoted properly. Probably Zomato is the only major source from where foodies can be aware about this awesome place. But everybody in Kolkata deserve the awareness of the presence of such a fantastic restaurant. The location being slightly off main road, easily visible big banners hosted in various places across the city can give a bigger boost.

I don't know how Santa is related here but my experience was nothing less than fantasy!

Finding this place can be a problem.... It's the lane next to anjali jewellers in golpark. But parking spaces are  abundant in the lane before that...

The place gives you a to see drink which I loved... With spices this was really nice...
I tried only the tribal food and it was just great... Had the kerela mutton soup.. One of the better slips I have had in a while... Then had the julu pitha which is a stuffed soft bread.... Then the mutton smoked in bamboo and the spicy special Roti's... Fabulous stuff...
Now comes the jadong.... It's a meghalayan dish... Which is traditionally cooked in peek blood... Alas this place makes it with mutton and different sauces and doesn't use blood.... Half the taste was gone but still it was great to eat...
Also try the wild red rice....

We looked it up on Zomato.  We really wanted to try the bansha pora but we went for the smoked octopus instead. It was a great decision. It's very tangy and not too heavy. The fresh herbs add to the taste. We tried the flat noodles which was pretty good. The fried rice was very average. The squid in garlic sauce had a beautiful flavour. The crab momos had a very unique taste. I did not particularly like the complementary drink. The pocket pinch isn't much. It is quite an affordable place and easy to locate as well.

Visited yesterday with my friends and had a great time. The ambience was awesome. More because the whole surrounding had an ethnic/tribal look around it. The theme of the decors is bamboo which was more of a reason it felt so. Bamboo furniture ,glasses, cups etc. We got a complimentary drink called Tankha Turani which though few of my friends didn't like much but it felt great to me. Worked up my appetite quite well. :D Noodles and rice are pretty decent and good in your mouth. I would suggest all to get the Bansa pora which has got stuffed minced mutton inside cooked in slow flame. Yum :p. If you visit you should definitely have the squid and octopus because they cooked it very nicely. Dishes to try definitely:
Shanghai Squid
Chilli Garlic Octopus
Chicken Keong
Hope to visit again pretty soon.
P.S.: The service was also great.

Dishes tried
1. Kerala mutton soup
2. Shanghai squid
3. Baked crab
4. Fish Stuffed squid
5. Mutton banso pora
6. Roti
The soup was good and so were the crabs and squids. Only two comments though
1. All of these items were having a very distinct flavour of lemongrass. While I am a big lemongrass lover myself, you would not want the same flavour in all of your dishes.
2. While the squids and crabs were supposed to be appetisers, they were cooked in too much sauce, which actually kills the appetite instead of working it up.

The best was yet to come though. Banso Pora needs a special mention, its delicious! Tender meat, delectable spices, mild flavour - fabulous stuff!

The welcome drink is bound to refresh you. The Crab Momo cooked in green sauce and the Bansha pora was simply out of the world. 

A pocket friendly resturaunt that must be visited to taste the tribal foods of India.

It is indeed one of the best places to try out sea food!! The fish, particularly the quality of the Bhetki is awesome!!! The ambiance is good and so is the service. The decoration is also alright considering the small space available. They also give you a welcome drink which is also unique in taste!!! Smoked fish, Korigassi and Mixed noodles can be tried!! Prices are also reasonable!!

I was craving, craving to have squid. More like sea food. Before you get into the impression that I love fishes, then let me take that away from you. No, I don't. But, I love squids. I first ate squid, 1 year back probably. But the sight of squid dishes on TV channels always excited me. So, when my city started serving squids at affordable and awesome prices, I definitely had to try them out. So fine one day me and S decided to visit this place.¬†

Being so close to my house, the transportation was not a trouble. We reached this place and it was so tribal and down to earth. Damn! I am glad that they took the initiative to actually shed some light on the tribal food of India. Why not? They have some exquisite delicacies which I am sure of. I would love to try the tribal food one day but since I was in for quest of some sea-food, I ended up ordering two plates of squid dishes along with sea food fried rice.

Smoked squid, chili garlic squid and Sea-food fried rice was what constituted of our lunch. We were welcomed with a drink. Well, I am sorry but I didn't ask the name of the drink. Not that I was overtly fascinated by it either. It had a strong smell of lemon. And strong means STRONG. It was basically a savory drink with mustard seeds and dry red chili. Anyway, I basically didn't drink it and passed. Next came the smoked squid and fried rice. The smoked squid tasted quite decent, in fact very good. Except the overwhelming presence of the lemon grass, I loved every bit of it. Are smoked stuff supposed to be so lemony? Anyway, the fried rice tasted normal, like any fried rice would be. The chili garlic squid was moderate and that is exactly the reason why it got a 3.0 rating from me. I wish the squid in the chili garlic gravy was not battered and fried. The squid is so spectacular in itself, why batter it and fry? The squid tasted very doughy as a result.¬†

The bill was decent, I am sorry I don't remember it. But you can check the menu here and it costed exactly the same. The pocket pinch was very, very decent. You can anytime come here and have your lunch, even when you are returning from college.
I would come here again, yes, because I want to try out the tribal food of this place. And I am not going to order chili garlic squid again.Good job, management. Though, some details in the food would be appreciated. Cheers!

I simply loved the place. I went there for dinner. They gave us  a welcome drink named Tankha Turani (rice drink). We ordered squid in chilli garlic sauce as a starter. Then bansa pora and wild red rice for the main course. The food was just amazing...tastes really good. All the platters are proportionately cooked. The price is affordable...the service is good. The ambience nd decor just matches the type of food availabl there...i.e. tribal and sea food. One must try this place. Would love to visit again. :)

Finally went to this place on Poila baishakh. Fairly crowded. Ordered Bansa Pora (marinated mutton served on bamboo shoots) and Voksa Meh (this stewy mutton curry with a subdued yet unique taste). The Bansa pora was eaten with their rice rotis (which the owner recommended, who actually was the one who took the order and was highly courteous). 
Smoked crab and Prawn sukha were the other dishes that we ordered. The crab was soft shelled and don't go expecting chunks of meat; the sauce was highly delicious though. The prawns were so succulent. Must try! Definitely going there again to try their other dishes.

The name sounds weird, but the place does not disappoint. My friend and I wanted a very light lunch and headed straight to the tribal section of the restaurant, already sure about what we want, thanks to intense Zomato research. We were served with the traditional rice drink, which, as many have pointed out, is an acquired taste. However, it did make the experience complete along with the painted walls, the bamboo furniture and the metal water tumblers. Not surprisingly, we ordered the banse-pora-mangsho with shoru chakli. The preparation was unique, the scent of the roast meat with the infusion of a smoky bamboo smell. The pieces were tender and paired nicely with the soft shoru chaklis. The food is reasonable and seems to be doing well. A good experience overall.

After reading review from Zomato I went to this place to celebrate Bengali New Year. Their tribal food and decor is something to watch. it is very unique and I just loved it. We tried Something new like Tankha Turani (Tribal drink as complimentary), Bansa Pora Mutton, Patra Pora Mangsho, jhulu pitha, Wild Rice, Seafood rice, Smoked fish. All of them taste awesome. if you ask me which is teh best then I will say try out Bansa Pora Mutton, Patra Pora Mangsho. These are something which is unique in taste. The mutton was very soft and have a smoky smell. It tasted awesome. I will definitely visit again to taste their unique dishes which i haven't tasted yet like mati pora mangsho Jhupu pisi mutton delicacy, chichen keong, kukhura ko masu

After reading much about this place, I visited here with three friends on a Sunday afternoon. We were caught by surprise by the sheer amount of time we had to wait for -- one hour -- before the waiters could manage a table for four. Add to that another 20 minutes before someone decided to accept orders from us. 
But these little inconveniences will not affect my rating for this foodie's paradise for the quality of lunch we had that afternoon.
As a welcome gesture, we were served with a rice drink from Odisha (popularly known as 'hariya' among the tribals). It works as an appetiser.
For starters we ordered smoked crab. It was alright! The crabmeat was tender. The preparation had too much of sauce on it, which subdued the taste of the meat. But, the hint of gondhoraj lemon in it was unique. Next, going by so much of craze around Bansa Pora, we ordered that with wild red rice, followed by Ngatok. All three of them made our day and we contemplated if we should ask for a second helping. 
We chose to try something new and ordered Jadoh and Korgassi. Jadoh tasted similar to the wild red rice with meat chunks as an extra, while korigassi was interesting, with coriander in it.
In my opinion, Bansa Pora and wild red rice stood out among others. 
Although the quantity of food was not too much, the quality and the taste won over our hearts. On a second thought, I feel at this price the quantity too is justified. 
The waiters should be a tad bit punctual between taking orders and serving them, and that's the only negative point among all the good things about this place.

Try the Tribal. Tribal food is something that you can not have in common restaurants. So if you dare something new, this is it. We were here on evening today after office. At first they served a complimentary welcome drink Tankha Turani, a drink of rice with a taste of spices, served in bamboo glass with cane handle. WOW! This drink set the mood for something new and special. For starters we had shukha (dry) prawn and shanghai squid. Both were good, but the squid was really tasty. Then comes the bansh pora ( boneless mutton stuffed inside bamboo ) and Korigassi, a boneless chicken dish, along with chaler roti ( roti made of powdered rice and coriander leaves ). The mutton was very soft and had a smoky smell. It tasted so good with the roti, we had to order another bansh pora and roti. The chicken, served in green gravy with coriander leaves, also tasted good, but the bansh pora was really awesome. We are looking forward for a date to visit here again for the other delicacies.

It doesn't look as exciting from the outside as much as it is from the inside, thanks to some over the top decor. Whether its octopus or squid or crab or tuna, you name the sea food and chances are that you have it on offer. The complimentary drink, being a tribal drink from Odisha, is fine. Missed out on the bansha pora mangsho (a mutton preparation), which seems to be a hit with most visitors, and other tribal cuisines. I would hope to explore Kolkata's only tribal cuisine on the platter (as the staff likes to refer to the tribal food to be found in the menu card) on my next visit. The staff members were polite but service was a tad bit slow. Also, there was confusion regarding which item is a starter and which one forms a part of the main course since there was no such division in the menu. Perhaps, such a division was never intended to be there anyway.

We have been there 4 times and never for once did we miss the Bansha Pora (mutton cooked in bamboo). The distinct smoky flavor of bamboo is vivid and tastes best with a thin crepe sort of soft roti. The owner is always present and gives good suggestions. The place is homely and cozy.

It is one of those places that you glare at and ponder as to what the owners were thinking decor wise. Over the top has a whole new meaning in this joint.¬†
¬†The staff are very polite and serve you with the complimentary drink as soon as they seat you.¬†
¬†The menu has variety but its very confusing (imo). The problem for me is figuring out what the starters are and what the main course is.
¬†After our close inspection, we decided to have the laal gosht and the masala mackerel. The former was nice, very flavorful, the latter was ok. I originally expected 2 whole fishes small/medium sized, but it was 2 pieces of one big fish.¬†
Then we went for the octopus in chilli garlic sauce and a julu peetha. The octopus was nicely cooked but the gravy was on the salty side. The julu peetha was not nice at all. Having tasted similar food before, the peetha was not fluffy as it should be but dense and the stuffing lacking seasoning.¬†
¬†I will end with saying that it is nice to have a ¬†joint which gives you so much seafood options and to our surprise it is also a very pocket friendly place.

The staff were courteous and helpful and the food was fresh and delicious. The coup de grace was of course the bas pora mutton...it surpassed all expectations.

Located in the lane beside Anjali Jewellers in Golpark area, this place was a pleasant surprise. While checking out the places trending on Zomato, Santa's Fantasea (yes, yes the name is still a mystery) caught my eye, largely thanks to its quirky menu.¬†
¬†The place is small but with a rather unique decor. The walls are laden with tribal fresco, masks and one particularly scary wall impression art. To add to the tribal feel, the chairs and tables are all made out of bamboo.¬†We were given a complementary welcome drink 'Tankha Turani', which is apparently a rice drink from Orissa. The drink was spicy, tangy and kinda reminded me of 'Idlis', going well with the overall ambiance.
¬†We ordered :¬†1. "Bansa Pora' - which is basically small mutton pieces marinated in spices and cooked inside a bamboo shoot. The dish was well made, with all the various flavors apparent while not losing its main component : the smoky bamboo feel.¬†2. Nagatok - 2 pieces of fish, roasted and cooked with a lot of spices and wrapped in banana leaves. Although I personally loved the dish, the thing was too spicy for my girlfriend. So not recommended for people with gentle taste buds.¬†3. Red sea food Noodles- This was a dish that I personally found slightly off the note. Perhaps because of the conflict of too many elements competing with one another. The chow was cooked in a red sauce and had a lot of veggies (carrots, yellow, red, green pepper, onions among others) and a whole lot of sea food (prawns, fish, squids and even pieces of octopus). Decent dish, but could have been better.¬†The best part about the place is their price though, which is pretty affordable.¬†
¬†And unlike, literally any other restaurant in Kolkata the prices on their menu card is the final price, all taxes included.¬†Overall a likeable, different experience. Will definitely come back to try the other tribal dishes and their choices of octopus dishes too...!

Had it not been for the overwhelming gesture of the owners to let me and my partner in despite the restaurant being closed at the time, we would have seriously regretted being unpunctual.
This place is located near Anjali Jewellers in Golpark. It has only got a handful of tables to offer, but the tribal decor is certainly something to ponder over. It's unique and attractive.
We were served a complimentary drink called "Tankha Turani" to start things off, which tasted weird but had a tangy feel to it. Coming to the food, this place is a catalogue of quality marine food. They have a great diversity in their menu card. We ordered the Shanghai Squid and Smoked Octopus in our first spell. While the former is a favourite, the latter was a maiden experience. It tasted really good. The place deserves further credit for turning me into a seafood lover overnight.
The only glitch in the beautiful experience? They served us Crab in Red sauce instead of Crab Momo! No dip in ratings for the bizarre error since that was delightful too!
All in all, this restaurant serves magnificent food at really low prices. A paradise for seafood lovers. :)

Ten of us went to Santa's Fantasea for a team lunch. It was our first venture in tribal food area. So we were quite excited specially after reading the reviews of Zoomato. I personally checked around 100 reviews from here and already had short listed in the top liked food in this restaurant.

Now coming to the experience we had there. The restaurant consists of 2 dinning rooms for seating. AC was OK. But somehow I got a strange smell just immediately I entered in the restaurant (Probably use of some air freshener would help). Never mind, we were too excited to dig into the very creative menu that the restaurant was offering. Our order consists of the following -
Tankha Turani (Complementary drink :) ), Pomfret Masala Fry , Crispy Fried Prawn, Smoked Chicken, Shanghai Squid (Free bee :)), Bansh Pora ( the famous mutton delicacy) , Smoked Octopus, Smoked Crab, Korigassi, Arsa Chum, Baked fish, Nagatok, Medium Lobster in Butter garlic, Seafood Rice and Soru Chaki ( the roti @ 20) ... Along menu indeed :)

The drink was new and it was different .. but can't say it was awesome. Pomfret was fresh. But I didn't expected from name that it will come as semi liquid gravy on top (probably we should have confirmed about the dish). Shanghai Squid was crispy and tests good but it was so over fried that I couldn't feel the squid in it. All 3 chicken dishes (smoked chicken, korrigassi, arsa chum) was truly awesome ( wanna give 200 on 100 :)). Never tasted any thing like that before. Bansh pora .. absolutely new experience. The brunt flavor was really going along with mutton. But I was missing the melting in mouth concept.. for us it was slightly undercooked.¬† The crab and the octopus was fresh in Smoked octopus and smoked crab but the sauce was OK type. Though all the sauces was having a lemon grass smell in it which gives a freshness to the dish overall and finally does not burn your stomach at all :).

I was specially disappointed with all the fish items. The baked fish was creating a huge expectation with its description. But when it came the over use of mustard with mayonnaise killed the dish. even the Nagatok which was supposed to be a paturi kind of dish seems to be cooked outside and then presented inside a banana leaf. Even the so hyped lobster which is most expensive dish in our menu tasted strictly OK type.

I liked the lightness of seafood rice and soru chaki which was good accompaniment with all the dishes.

So over all cant give it a 5 or 4 but cheers to New Taste in Kolkata certainly can grab¬† a 3.5 :).

Finally went to this place for Sunday lunch. We were lucky enough to get a place because within a few minutes the place was packed and people were waiting outside. The decor of this place gives an underwater as well as a tribal feeling.
 They served a complementary drink before food which was quite unique and different .we ordered bansa pora,chicken keong and mixed seafood rice. The bansa pora was very good with smoky flavour, the rice was average with lots of octopus squid and other seafood items and the chicken keong was delicious but very very spicy. People who are not accustomed with spicy food should avoid this dish but people like me who loves spices in everything will enjoy it very much. Service is a little slow due to the crowd but the good food compensates it. Overall a good experience.

You Suck !!!!!!!!!
So basically I am like really upset right now because the food was bad and in absence of a better word confusing. 

So we ordered red wild rice and it was anything but wild it was rather  coloured bland rice.
Then,we got bas pora (mutton) which is basically like a bamboo based mutton so there was no flavour of bamboo it was just a basically Bengali type mutton preparation the mutton was soft but it wasn't what it said it would be. 
Then, we got something called asun chicken it was well kind if Thai ish. 
Then we had a prawn sukha Chinese ish . 
And a special roti aka pancakes .

So overall confusing and it isn't worth it unless you are looking for fast food .
If you are a true foodie by heart this place isn't for you.

Bored of the usual Indian and Chinese eateries, we decided to dine some place new and unique after a long day out. Zomato found us this amazing place. Everything about this place is unique and different. Directions: Take the lane of Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. Not the one before or after, exactly that lane. Parking available.
Head: +4
Our Order: We were served a welcome drink of fermented rice on our arrival known as Tankha Turani. I never knew fermented rice could taste this good. Coming to our main order, 2 Coconut Lime Soup, Korigassi, Red Seafood Rice, Mixed Seafood Rice Noodles, Shanghai Squid & Smoked Prawn.
Pocket Pinch: 1040 INR. Just. 
Pros: 1. Their speciality is Tribal and Seafood. Since none of us had any clue about either of them, a man (probably the owner) was happy enough to explain us the dishes and suggest us on our order. 
2. Needless to mention, cooperative and friendly staff.
3. Complete tribal ambience adding to the atmosphere of the place. 
4. Food is tasty, unique and different complying with the theme of the place. 
5. Pocket friendly and tax free. 
Cons: No cons. 

P.S: We are coming back next month to try the octopus.

Delicious seafood blended with tribal delicacy- that is what Santa's Fantasea is. Not heard of this place before. One day one of my hostelmates told about the place. after entering with a friend into the restaurant we were amazed by its interior. but the window should have some curtains on it, otherwise the seats are clearly visible from the road outside.
Coming to the food at first they served us with the complimentary drink Tankha Turani. It was average.
After that we ordered Fried Tuna- good taste, a bit different from other places.
then comes the famous Bansa Pora with Soru Chakli ruti- the dish was just awesome. the mutton was well cooked with a scent of burnt bamboo. with the roti it just melted in the mouth. i will come in this place again and again just for this dish.
then we ordered Smoked Squid- dish was nice. the sauce was excellent.¬†
the service was warm and fast.
overall if you want quality food in reasonable price this should be your destination.
and finally, yaa we are coming back again to taste the dishes we hadn't tasted :)

Well this review is based on my 2 visits to this place. Recommended by a friend, located in the same lane as Anjali Jewellers this place is quite easy to find. The place is not that big with around 8-10 tables divided in 2 rooms. What catches your eye would be the interiors - it's tribal themed and the cuisine too is not just limited to seafood but they have tribal food options as well. Now the problem with me and seafood restaurants is that I want to try EVERYTHING but then you can't can you???
On arrival they serve you a refreshing (because it's complimentary) drink- kind of sour and tangy it's called tanga turani I guess. In these 2 visits I got the chance of tasting their horse mackerel (fish) masala, squids in chilli garlic sauce, octopus in chilli garlic sauce, red flat noodles and not to forget the evergreen babycorn with mushroom in pepper sauce for my vegetarian partner. The horse mackerel was really good and was spicy just the way I like it and the portions (2) are more than enough if you are the only one eating, the octopus too was very well cooked but I would rate the mackerel higher. As starters I had ordered chilly garlic squids and crispy chilli baby corn during my first visit and had a tough time figuring out which was what because they both looked the same but the waiter was kind enough to sort it out for us however it took him some time for this as well but nonetheless the squids were good. Now the red flat noodles was something which I really liked and will recommend this to anyone who cares. A meal for 2 will cost you somewhere around 500 - 600 so this place is definitely value for money and yes the waiters (2 or 3) are all very courteous and well behaved, the owner sometimes walks upto to you to enquire about the food and for a moment I thought I was a VIP, a very nice gesture. Definitely visiting this place again to try something new...

Brilliant!! If you are bored of the same old biriyani and chinese then this is the place to be. Unique taste and cuisine.Must tries:
1. Baansh Pora Mutton - Their forte, Juiciest meat, tender. Just superb
2. Lal Ghost - 3 pieces of minced mutton kebabs (looks similar to galawti kababs of lucknow). Honestly i personally found this dish better than Baansh Pora.
Can try:
Wild Red Rice with Korigassi (Boneless chicken in coriander sauce with garlic) - Refreshing

The food doesnt make you feel heavy and does not burn a hole in your pocket. Quiet Pocket Friendly. Looking forward to another visit at this place to try out some more of their unique delicacies.

Went there sometimes back with my better half for lunch. Its a very nice restaurant and unique because they serve tribal foods from different parts of India. Interior is nicely done tribal themed and furnitures are made from bamboo. We ordered for their signature dish banshpora mutton which is ground mutton roasted and baked inside a bamboo having the great concoction of bamboo flavour and juices with mutton and spices. To go with that we ordered for some type of thin bread which they recommended(don't remember name), it was not regular wheat bread but seemed like made from rice flour, tested great. We also ordered mutton jado rice which was a bit spicier though but tasted great unlike typical mutton pulao/fried rice. As dessert we settled for honey noodles which was okayish. Only thing is that they need to add more options to the dessert section otherwise its a great place to have a nice meal and pocket friendly too.

This place gets a thumbs up for the food quality at such a reasonable price. We had no less than a feast today. Add to that a free squid dish,  your joy just increases tenfold.
To start off, that rice drink was unnecessary.. It tasted weird. 
Now to the best part. We had lal mutton gosht kebabs(good not great), bansa pora mutton (goes really well wd a paratha or white rice), squids stuffed with fish,  a definitely must-have, with wild red rice and finally some smoked octopus. I could jst go back there to have that octopus again and again.

My girlfriend suggested this place and we finally went there. The concept of tribal food is quite unique in Kolkata. Probably the only one in Kolkata. The food here is mouthwatering. We had smoked octopus, stuffed squid, Crab and mutton prepared in bamboo (how unique is that!!). The staff here are very courteous. The ambience is good however, little music would be nice. The cost is very reasonable. A must visit place for any foodie.

Options for seafood is limited in Kolkata, tribal food is a rare occurrence in the city. I saw this place in the trending section at Zomato and immediately decided to give it a go. The place sits cozily at a narrow lane in Golpark (beside Anjali Jewellers). There's no dedicated parking place which makes things a bit harder for people coming with cars although a couple can fit nicely at the side of the road. We had to wait for about 15 minutes to get inside. The place can sit around 30-40 people only and have only 3 waiters along with the manager. Nicely decorated, the ambience gives one the tribal feeling in the inner section and aquatic feel on the outside. I had a mixed feeling with the complimentary rice drink (tankha turani) served in bamboo glass. We were really helped by the manager with the food selection, felt good when he took his time to explain each and every dish we enquired about. Finally settled on Baansh Pora which was excellent, ordered one more at the end. Voksa meh has that tribal scent and tasted good. Jadho rice served with Voksa Meh is ok, a bit oily to my liking. Loved the pan cake roti suggested by the manager, didn't like the Julu Pitha though.

Overall a fine dining experience and a close encounter with delicious tribal food. I will definitely go back there to try their seafood variations.

i was strolling on a lazy sunday near golpark When i landed up in this dine-in.situated just after anjali jewellers.deco is really good.i think this dine in is the part of ECSTASEA restaurant(lake road).i would suggest u to have the thai seafood soup.really tasty &the best part was the price.the pricing of the dishes were very attractive. Flat green noodles was something i haven't tasted before.it was really yummy.good in taste,good in quantity.Service was spontaneous.
Cost for two :500/-.a must visit place.
if u r planning for saturday/sunday dinner my tips is to get down there early as u may have to wait for a while to get a sitting.

One of the best places for seafood. The restaurant is well decorated, having a cosy feeling. The best part is its quite pocket friendly. The smoked octopus with the mixed red flat noodles goes too well. And even better is the Shanghai squid and Bans Pora. Shanghai squid isn't printed on their menu as yet; but make sure to try the thing. :)

Been hearing about this tiny little joint for sometime.   Located in the lane adjoining Anjali Jewelers in Golpark, the place pleasantly greets your eyes with beautifully painted walls which resemble a underwater scene.  We ordered smoked crab, smoked octopus and a plate of crab momos.  Service is really quick.  The crab was exceptionally delectable, the octopus very well-cooked.  I was a tad disappointed with the momos, can't say that they are the best I've had.  Looking forward to visiting the place more often and trying out everything else on the menu.  That said, their dishes don't burn a hole in your pocket.  After my first visit, I can say that I'm well-fed and very happy.

A "fantasea" indeed for foodies.. this place offers one of a kind experience with its blend of tribal and sea food. Located at Golpark, this small joint is a rather new addition to the Kolkata food scenario. The decor is lovely, painted in accordance to the tribal and sea theme. Once inside, you'll be offered a complimentary Tankha Turani, a tribal cooler drink. You immediately know you've walked into the right place.The menu is segregated into tribal and sea food pages. Coming to the food, we(there were two of us) tried the seafood flat noodles.. excellent I must say.. and the smoked prawn, cooked splendidly. But the show stealer has to be the marquee tribal dish of this place, the Bansha Pora. It is basically a mutton dish, marinated for over a day, cooked slowly inside a bamboo shoot, and also served likewise. The Bansha Pora, coupled with the tribal paratha/pancake(forgot the actual name) was the best thing I've had in  while. For the dessert, we took honey noodles, which proved to be delight in itself. Food quality, decor, service is fantastic in this joint. Cost for two comes up to approximately Rs. 800. Put this place on your must visit list and enjoy the unique tribal / sea food combination this place has to offer.

Fantasea came as a pleasant surprise with a considerable range of tribal food. Most conveniently located at Golpark, this place has the opportunity to be the most buzzing joint in the area. Highly recommended are their Bansa Pora, Patra Pora, Jhupu pishi's mutton, Ngatok and se food clear soup. The ingredients and fresh and service is quick and waiters friendly. I could do with little less of the decor as I find the wall paintings over bearing. I hope Santa expand the Tribal menu further. Would love to go back for more surprises.

The location has been so nicely explained in zomato that it was very easy for me to find it. The place is not very large and has approximately 7 to 8 tables. The whole place is quite nicely decorated which gives a tribal feel to it. We were very much eager to try out their baansh pora so we quickly ordered it and along with it we took two rotis which were made of rice and along with it we ordered squid stuffed with fish. They serve a complimentary drink known as Tankha turani which is a rice drink from odisha which was not bad and was quite refreshing. Initially i thought that the squid would be chewy as it came in a bigger size but i was so happy to be proved wrong as the dish was so perfectly balanced. The sauce was great, the dish had no smell and it was not at all chewy. Then came the baansh pora which had this wonderful burnt smell and the combination of baansh pora and those typical rotis (dont know the exact name) were great. The mutton tasted great which was boneless and absolutely soft. The experience was so good that i instantly decide to visit this place more often and the best part is the low price which they charge for their delicious food items. Our total bill was rs. 520 and last was not the least the behavior of the staffs were very warm. I would recommend everyone who is willing to try out new cuisines to definitely put this joint in their wishlist and give it a try.

My friend and i had dinner at this place in March.

Ambience: Mid-sized restaurant but vibrant and cosy. Within a quiet lane off Golpark. ¬†

Service: The staff and owners are courteous and warm. They gave us detailed insight into the dishes we were interested in and helped us make our decisions.¬†

Recommended: Bansh Pora Mangsho -They served it straight from a bamboo platter. Korigassi - chicken in green curry (North East), Red Rice.¬†

Pocket Pinch: Definitely value for money. Two-course meal for two around 600.¬†

Advice: Hopefully it will stay open a little longer past its 10pm last order deadline.¬†

Verdict: Hidden gem in Golpark.

Being a lover of everything related to the seas, I had been a regular at Ecstasea for a very long time, and was absolutely thrilled when the same guys opened another restaurant in Golpark.¬†
This restaurant is perhaps the first¬†of its kind to deliver authentic food from the local tribes of India. The food, rich in herbs and mostly marinated over long hours infuses such rustic flavours to the senses, that one is tempted to try everything on the menu.¬†¬†By now, I've tried almost everything on their menu, but I'd strongly recommend, as many others have, their signature dish called the Bansha Pora. ¬†A dish prevalent in parts of Orissa, it has mutton marinated for over a whole day, stuffed into a bamboo, cooked in a tandoor for hours. The burnt smell of charcoal over tender meat is a combination so deadly, that it's impossible for a food lover to resist having it over and over again. :)

After reading a lot in zomato, me and my two colleagues decided to visit santa's fantasea. We wanted to try something different and the concept of tribal cuisine was preety new. The restaurant is situated in the street just beside anjali jewellers. The decor was nice with the beautiful paintings and the seating arrangements gave that tribal feeling. We were greeted with their complementary tribal rice drink which was quite soothing in summer afternoon. We ordered for the famous bansa pora with julu pitha. Bansa pora was tender juicy mutton cubes in smokey spicy gravy but not rich in oil, tasted very different but very good. The julu pitha was bread with chicken and egg stuffing tasted very good with bansa pora. Next came red rice and kukhuro ko masuchicken(). Red rice was good and went well with the chicken dish. The chicken has a distinct coconut flavour but mild spicy as well. The chicken dish was very unique and i have never tasted something like that. Then came squid in chilly garlic sauce and this dish also tasted well. Baked fish was very creamy..and finally we had crab in green tangy sauce which they provided complimentary on order above Rs 1000..The crab was quite spicy and very flavorful and tasted very well. We couldn't have any dessert coz they dont have any now, but the waiter informed that they will start serving tribal desserts. The quantity of the dishes were very good..One dish can be easily shared by two. The service was very good and the waiter was very well mannered. All in all we were highly satisfied. The price is a steal. One bansa pora, two julu pitha, one red rice, one chicken, one squid, one baked fish costed Rs. 1010 only along with their complimentary drinks and a crab dish. Highly recommended..

On arriving, you are served a complimentary drink, Tankha Turani, really refreshing, a little sour and tangy, that soothes. We had BaaNsh Pora, Octopus in chili garlic sauce, Hakka rice noodles and a Thai Seafood salad.

The noodles were pretty standard, good quantity and all.

The octopus was pretty good too. The baaNsh pora was new for all of us and delectable. The smoky flavour in the cooked mutton was interesting to say the least.

I really loved the balance in the Thai Seafood Salad. In fact, lately I have oft caught myself craving the seafood salad, here - which, regardless to say, is a really good sign. (Y)

Will revisit soon.

Specially, since I really want to try their lobster and crab. ¬†:)

P.S. I did visit again (in fact a day after I made this post). To read about both the visits, please check my new blog: poursomemoresugar.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/santas-fantasea/

I highly recommend this place to everyone. Great food at an unbeatable price. The sea food is so fresh, they say they bring it from Orissa. The staff is very friendly and they customise sauces to your taste. From whatever we ordered id recommend Bash Pora with the yummy pancakes(more like a neer dosa), lobster in butter garlic sauce, Naga style Bekti. There's a lot more to try.
Also have to say that the good is not greasy or oily at all, so you won't feel uncomfortable after a meal.

Had a very nice experience here. It was my first time and only tried tribal foods and they were all awesome.. We had 
Tankha Turani as welcome drinks, 
Lal Gosht was mind blowing..., 
Bansa Pora had a typical taste and smell of charcoal which was worth trying, 
Wild Red Rice was fabulous in taste, 
Arsa Chhum and Korigassi on the chicken side, both were really good. 
Only wish there was a curtain at the window that would've made the ambience perfect! Staffs are really helpful and describe each item with patience.. Next time will try seafood section..

Finally got the opportunity to visit Santa's Fantasea. I was blown off by the ambience. Everything was made up of bamboo giving it a tribal feeling.  We were welcomed with a glass of Tankha Turani. It was REALLY refreshing. After a lot of discussion (as we wanted to have EVERYTHING) me and my friend settled on baansh pora, smoked crab, red seafood rice and fish in white sauce. 
The baansh pora which is a mutton dish cooked inside bamboo in tribal style was AWESOME. The fish was soft and tasted lovely. The crab was ACTUALLY 'fingerlicking good'. The staffs were really well behaved. The owner was sweet enough to ask us personally about our experience. Santa's Fantasea has stolen my heart completely. I would really love to go back to taste the other exquisite dishes. I would recommend EVERYONE to visit this wonderful restaurant. :)

awesome place. complimentary drinks( tankha turani) was a pleasant surprise. In summer, chilled tankha turani would be a blessing, it felt so.¬†

Tried Khukura Ko Masu. The preparation was so new to my taste senses, it took a time to realise which buds were reacting. Nevertheless, accompanied by Julu Pitha and Smoked Octopus made my day. Julu Pittha is a heavy one, though it looks like just a bun.¬†

Can't wait to have bansa pora..

Ohh my god!! What a place right at the nose of my house. Just went here today based on reviews on Zomato and a few friends who had been there but I was amazed. This place serves only Tribal and Seafood. Did not go for the Tribal menu today but whatever I had was absolutely lovely. On entering we had some welcome drinks going in bamboo glasses made from rice which was refreshing.
Started off with Crab Momos and Chilli Garlic Squid for starters. Both of them were exquisite. For the main course we ordered Chef's special Lobster, Baked Fish (bhetki)(This is something I would suggest everyone), Octopus Basil and Crab in Coco Lime Sauce. We had a bowl of mixed flat green noodles to go with it. I cannot degrade any dish here. The kitchen seems small so you might have to wait for some time to deliver food, but it was worth the wait for me.
They plan to change the Tribal menu every few months which shows ambition and variety. And at the end of the day, what we had to pay seemed so less compared to the places we go to.¬†
My further visits to the place made me try the Tribal food and I must say, the Baansh Pora Mutton and the Tribal rice(jadok) were truly exceptional. The menu has been revised and there are a lot more options to choose from when it comes to seafood and sauce that goes with it. One of the best places around.
I will give it a 5/5 for everything.

Reasonably priced food and very good service. Sadly can't say the same about the food quality. We chose seafood over the tribal cuisine (a wrong decision). The Seafood Lemon Grass Soup smelt and tasted a bit rancid (mostly due to the prawns). The Smoked Crab wasn't smoked properly. Parts of it were left totally uncooked. None of the seafood (barring the squid) tasted fresh. Inevitably the whole thing caused us food poisoning the next day. ¬†The waiter was honest enough to admit some of their shortcomings. But I wonder why did they serve us the food knowingly in the first place. Anyway I would suggest others to enquire about the seafood properly before ordering.

I tried smoked pomfret, crispy prawn, crab momo - but let me tell you other than pomfret I didn't like the rest 2 much.

But then we ordered for baansh e pora and red rice.... Baansh e pora took me to another world all together..... Such a smoky flavor with tenderness of mutton is fantabulous.

My suggestion don't try anything else, just just tribal food.... It's absolute mouth watering

One of the most popular restaurants in Kolkata currently is Santa's Fantasea. I have been a fan of this joint since it opened up with the Golpark branch. Till date, I have made 10+ visits to this place.

Recently, I have gone to this place on one afternoon with my wife to have lunch. They told seats were full and we need to wait. We said okay and waited outside along-with 3-4 other people who were waiting too. After 20 minutes of waiting, they called us in and gave us seat in a table of 4 and took the order. We were pretty full in stomach that day and had gone to the place only to enjoy the beautiful food. So we ordered 2 dishes. The waiter told us Sir we will shift you to a 2 person table, we said Okay. Then we were shifted to a side place inside the restaurant (which they have been using lately to gather more people) and there was no fan or AC. On a hot summer day like this, it felt suffocating sitting there. I had requested the waiter to shift us to another place but he refused. Then I told him to cancel the order as I decided to go to some other place. To my surprise, the waiter said "okay khaben na toh? cancel kore dichhi- ei oto number table er order cancel kore de". There is always a way to address things politely. I felt really bad with the attitude, and said we would better go as we are not paying less to sit here and suffocate and eat like this. Then there was manager type person, who angrily told "paise ka baat nahi hai, aapko wait karna padega agar udhar baithna hai to". I instantly replied that you only called us in and we have already waited for 20 minutes, it was neither a weekend or festival time. He said people come here and wait for long, longer than hours and then they come and have food- it is choice and if you do not want we can't help it.

Is this what hospitality has come down to? I am a novice in the world of hotels and restros but I thought that a smiling face with some good words will never do you any harm. Just thought for sharing, as when you get such treatment from good places, it is a matter to feel bad.

Well, not quite many know about this restaurant. I would suggest foodies with taste buds who are constantly picking up new ways to explore their gourmet, to visit this place for once.. The tribal cuisine would rejuvenate you with the grameen culture. Add to that, the tribal look of it... Also, if u think tribal food is not enough, you would get to taste squid octopus and various types of seafood. The complimentary welcome drink known as tankha turana has a tangy flavor along with that scent of rice.. We ordered for bansa pora, crab momo in red sauce, mixed seafood noodles, smoked octopus and shanghai squid. I didn't like the preparation of shanghai squid.. Others were really good. The bansa pora mutton, you get that smell of roasting bamboo from the mutton, a new thing. Fillings in the crab momo was nice. Smoked Octopus.. Juz loved it.. U get to feel that flesh in ur mouth.. Tender and juicy.. And the noodles was good.. I would give it a 4.0..  Bon appetit, folks!

Update: 27.5.15

Visited the eatery for the second time. This time ordered green seafood rice and octopus in chilli sauce. I would say its sister concern performs better than this joint...¬†

For seafood lovers who look for options at reasonable prices, Santa‚Äôs Fantasea is the place to be. Tucked away in the lanes of Golpark, this outlet offers quality service like its sister concern Ecstasea. Even though it scores equal to its sister in the seafood section, the tribal spread that it offers is quite attractive to the foodies of Kolkata. The first that we noticed was the d√©cor. The tribal setting is really fantastic and completely rustic and sets in a unique mood. It is a medium sized eatery and was sufficiently clean and air conditioned. ¬†Coming to the food, we tried out only the seafood section. Immediately after we were seated, we were offered a complementary drink each. It was named Tankha Turani and was a rice drink with black cumin added. The taste was really different. We ordered green seafood rice and a squid preparation. The food was served hot and spicy in about 10-15 minutes and the courteous waiters were ready to serve us.¬†The portions are good and the total bill for 2 green seafood rice and 1 squid preparation came to 470/- including taxes. Quite reasonable I would say. The quality of the food is good not superb. Will like to try out the tribal cuisines soon!

The restaurant is located at the centre of south kolkata - golpark. They will  welcome you with a complimentary drink, which I found refreshing. We had ordered kerala mutton soup, tuna salad, smoked octopus and their specialty bansh pora. The food was pretty good  at the price , I liked their mutton items, both the soup and bansh pora . And the Service was very prompt and the  waiters will help you a lot while choosing. Overall it was a good experience.

If you are looking for a budget seafood meal then look no further than Santa's Fantasea. The restaurant is small but feels like home. Food , obviously being delicious also has a new touch to it. Thanks to the chef I got to experience Bansa Pora for the first time and really loved it. But the best part was its starters that included squid and crab for us. Hope I can visit there soon as I have other restaurants to try from too.

This newly opened food joint is located just opposite to Anjali Jewellers at Golpark... Interior decoration is really eye pleasing. This place is known for its seafood n tribal cuisine.. I thus took both the platters!!  Squid in chilli garlic sauce as starter and wild red rice accompanied with bansa pora in the main course. Squid was really tasty but I found it to be over fried!! Rice n mutton were really good although it took 40 mins to serve bansa pora!! Price was affordable!! So overall I had a good time at Santa's Fantasea!!
I again had a visit to this place for my birthday treat. This time I tried their seafood and chinese platters. As it was the month of June we were welcomed with aam panna which really made us happy. We had konkan seafood salad which was awesome to taste. Then we had red and green seafood rice with chicken in tangy sauce. All were just too good! This place is really worthy to visit again and again.  
But I would like to see the management more careful about their service as we got a pin in our rice! I know it was unintentional but it could have turned into worst event ever. So you people should be conscious and careful. Good luck!

Santa's fantasea is a tribal and seafood restaurant in golpark, situated in the lane beside anjali jewellers...
been there last week and was greeted with the welcome drink tankha taurani...though i dint like it much, the delicacies that followed amazed me...we ordered smoked octopus first...it was quite good...had octopus before in their franchise Ecstasea before, it had a similarly good taste...
next we ordered wild red rice, ngatok and bansa pora....the first two were quite tasty and unique...but the signature dish was bansa pora...small mutton cubes served in a bamboo piece and tasted just awesome....
and it was quite pocket-friendly...
would like to taste the rest of their specialties on my next visit...

I had never tasted squid and never intended to but this place really changed my mind. Their Shanghai Squid is so delicious. This is the perfect place  if you want to experiment. And this place not only serves seafood but also tribal food, like, delicacies of the 7 sister states of North-East India. And there is something about their hospitality..makes you feel at home.

Tucked in a narrow lane at Golpark is this food heaven. From the outside it wont appear as impressive as it is. As you push open the door you enter a world closer to the soils of the country. The decor is simple yet apt. Bamboo and cane hug each other to bring out the tribal smell. 
It was our first visit and we ordered roti, baansh pora, jadoh and a coriander based chicken delicacy. Each of them were mouth watering. The meat melted almost like fresh cheese in one's mouth. The jadoh, a tribal take on biriyani was spicy yet light on the stomach. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and promise to not only go back again and again but also to take friends and family to tickle their tastebuds with the romance of the soil.
To top it all it is very reasonable and the pocket pinch will not make a hole in the pocket. We had sufficient food for the two of us who were terribly hungry at 3 in the afternoon and the billed amount was a seven hundred and ten only.
Do not wait to pamper your tastebuds and drown in the authentic local flavours of our land.

My cousin went to this place on 14th feb and had put up pictures. I got tempted to visit the place when I heard the place serves tribal food. I never heard tribal food as a cuisine so I thought it would be different. My taste buds always try for something different. So I went to this place. The place is little bit difficult to locate and even my phone navigation could not locate it. I also read the reviews in zomato and saw that it got mostly good reviews. I went with my Mom. We reached at around 8:30. The place had very good decor with tribal artifacts all around. We were first served a complimentary drink which is liquid form of rice. It tasted like Panta Bhaat but was not bad. Anyway I found the menu very funny. I asked the waiter what are specials. he suggested Bash Pora Mutton which is boneless mutton chopped , marinated and cooked in a bamboo stick. HE suggested shoru chakir ruti alongwith it. We also ordered jhupu pishir mangsho with wild red rice and smoked octopus. I loved the way they served the bansh pora inside a bamboo stick. The taste was really good and very different. Shoru chakir ruti is like gola ruti which we have and it was very soft and went well with bash pora. Jhupu Mashir mangsho had a very tender and subtle flavor and it mised well with the wild red rice which was very spicy. At last came the smoked octopus. It was not bad. Tasted like normal bengali chinese stuff. Overall i am very satisfied and must say the taste is really different and a welcome change from biriyanis, mixed hakka chowmin , burgers and pizzas. It must be tried but there is a lot of room for improvement on the quantity . I think people will pay a little bit extra but quantity must be more. I have heard they will introduce many new items and also make a desert section. So looking forward do that.

I had been planning to visit this place from quite some time and the opportunity on Saturday ,14th Feb.
Me n S went there around 8.30pm, and the place was absolutely packed. So we asked the owner to call us once a seat for two is available, as we waited outside. The location is just inside the lane beside Golpark Anjali Jewellers, and the ambiance is¬† of a para outside. We waited for sometime but I was getting impatient as I could see people going in and settling down. S went inside and spoke to the owner. He apologised a got us seat for two, immediately. Once inside, I didnot find any reason to blame he polite gentleman ,as the area on around 20 seats were full, with another just one sweet and polite staff.
So here's the food fare we enjoyed :
1. Tankha Turani (A tribal rice drink) - Complimentary
2. Seafood Coconut lime soup ( First time octopus :) with sublime coconuty taste) - Yum
3. Jadoh ( Red rice with mutton, tribal take on biriyani ) -¬† mutton pieces melt in your mouth) - Double yum
4. Bansa Pora (mutton minced and marinated inside bamboo shoot and charcoal grilled ) - Hero hiralal of the menu,in fact everyone was asking for it.
5. Arsa Chhum ( Light chicken preparation, taken to go with jadoh) - Good
6. Julu Pitha ( Dumpling with egg mixed filling inside accompanied with a tangy sauce )- Thik thak.

If we had left without eating here, we would have missed an experience of a lifetime because we have fallen in love for their food and good hospitality and plan to become regulars.

Santa's fantasea I have no idea why this name was given but skipping that part as of now and coming to the food. Santa's fantasea was visiting all the Cognizant offices and from there I got the address and was in the mood to try some sea food and so went there after office. We had planned before entering the restaurant that we will be having Octopus and Squid and so as soon as the menu was given to us we ordered Smoked Octopus and Squid in Chilli Garlic Sauce and with that Green flat noodles and Tuna Salad as the finishing touch . As this was my first time I was trying Squid and Octopus so I was excited as well as worried whether they will suit my taste palate or not but thankfully I loved all the dishes specially the Smoked Octopus and overall my experience of Sea food in Santa's fantasea was good.

The quality is great, taste is awesome, ambiance and decor is fantastic and menu is cheap. The Manager is very helpful who patiently and very eagerly explains and recommends items from the menu.

We ordered Shanghai Squid, Julu Pithe, Steamed Prawn Momo, Shoru Chakli Pithe, Bansa Pora, Smoked Crab, Nagatek and ended with Honey Noodles with Ice Cream. Each one ... distinct in its taste.

Its a must try !!!

Santa's Fantasea is located at Ballygunje Terrace near Golpark Anjali Jewellers.I've visited this restaurant few days ago.I went here with my lover.First of all when we entered here then all seats were empty almost.The ambiance of this restaurant was good.They had two separate portions.One was Seafood section & other was tribal food section.We sat the tribal section.waiter served us a complimentary tribal drink 'Tankha Turani'.This is a rice drink of odissa.This taste was unique but not so good.Then we ordered 'Baansh Pora' - Mutton marinated & stuffed in bamboo & cooked in tandoor.This taste was totally mindblowing.I loved it.We also ordered 'Julu pitha' & Their special Rooti.Julu pitha was a bread with chicken keema & boiled egg.Taste was awesome.Special Rooti was just outstanding.This rooti looks like roomali rooti but taste difference.I loved it so much.If you go there don't miss Baansh Pora with their special rooti.Price is very reasonable.service is too late.The tribal food is totally different from other food.

I do not understand why this place is not popular yet. From an interesting d√©cor to an even more interesting menu, this restaurant definitely stood out for me. The entire tribal theme is unique and that's what attracted me to the place in the first place. A special mention to the restaurant for providing us with their special drinks as soon as we got seated :) sweetest gesture I have seen since a long time! For starters we ordered prawn momos and seafood coconut lime soup. Absolutely delicious. This gave us confidence to actually look forward to the experimental main course that we had ordered for. Our bansa pora and korigassi for the main course were brilliant. Both the mutton and the chicken were very well prepared and the tribal feel was definitely there. 
I am really looking forward to going there again and trying out more of those tribal dishes! :D

Food is one important source of happiness and well-being Santa's Fantasea is located pretty conviniently in the heart of busy south calcutta.The simplicity of the place simply rocks!Located in the lane just beside Anjali Jewellers ,it is a small restaurant.The decor is very nice and a perfect blend of authentic tribal setting to their bamboo furniture.I would obviously say the taste of food is extraordinary if not devine.We were served with Tankha Turani First.It is complimentary drink they serve .Its got sweet gesture,cooled rice soup is the main ingredient of the drink with a dash of mustard,curry leaves and red chilli flavoured aroma.Followed by Bansh Pora steamed spicy mutton and a special trait of roti .It tastes kind of steam baked,fabulously soft and delicious with dash of onion leaves hither and thither. This place offers best kind of tribal dishes as well as seafood. The next item we ordered was a spicy rice followed by spicy baby octopus curry. A perfect seafood with great taste. Ambiance is also very friendly .I would say the place is worth visit.

Three of us went to this place after hearing from one of our friends and also reading the reviews on zomato. We were welcomed with their complimentary rice drink which were served in bamboo mugs... For starters we ordered the mutton soup (which was very light and refreshing), Shanghai squid in a delicious sauce, Masala horse mackerel (never thought fish could be so delicious) and cheesy tuna salad (this was nothing special, just tuna in mayo cheese sauce, though tasty). For mains we had julu pithe (a sort of sourdough bread stuffed with minced chicken and egg... Nothing like that we had tasted before, served with a chutney) bansa pora (mutton pieces cooked in a bamboo and roasted.... It has a nice smokey flavor different from charcoal smoke) kukura ko masu ( chicken in a coconut gravy) octopus in a lime based sauce (delicious) and achari prawn. We were really surprised when the bill came to just ‚Çπ1600. The only con about this place: they didn't have a tribal dessert section, but we talked with the manager and he assured us that in the next few months they are going to revamp the menu with added options.... Eagerly waiting for that day to come for our next visit!!

Lunch at Santa's Fantasea was a pleasant surprise.... the place has a great menu, pocket-friendly prices, quirky tribal decor, helpful staff and the food is nothing short of extraordinary! 
We ordered schezwan squid, bansa pora mutton and a huge lobster, chef's special... cooked in butter garlic sauce. Each dish had it's own distinctive flavor... it was pretty good! The squid was juicy, not rubbery at all. The lobster deserves a special mention for the detailed plating (we're planning to put up a picture soon). But the icing on the cake was the mutton. Roasted within a bamboo shoot, the meat was so fresh and juicy that it makes me salivate even to think of it! The Welcome drink they served us (made from rice) was plain... didn't like it that much.

So this place definitely deserves a visit if you're looking for fresh seafood or tribal delicacies. A definite thumbs up from me!

We went to this place for a tribal lunch and we were thoroughly satisfied. Some really wonderful mutton based dishes here are jadoh rice, Lal gosht(mutton chops) and bansa patra(mutton cooked in bamboo shoot). The fish we had here was ngatok, a paturi kind but with completely different set of spices. The prices a very very reasonable for a hearty lunch of 2. I would love to go back to this place.

Located very conveniently near my home, this was the first time I went there to give it a try.
And saying I wasn't disappointed is an understatement. I LOVED it.
Starting from the decor, a very simple but authentic tribal setting to their bamboo furniture. Marvellous.

We were served with a chilled, complimentary drink made from ground-rice, flavoured with mustard seeds and curry leaves. Very refreshing.
We ordered prawn and crab momos.. So succulent and flavoured delicately.
We followed it up with Bansa Pora : Mutton chunks cooked in a spice-mix in a bamboo's hollow and a spicy red rice with mutton cubes. Bloody Brilliant.

We ended with Flat Noodles in Honey and Ice-cream, basically Darsaan.

Pocket Pinch : 795/- !

So I recommend this place to anyone and everyone who's brave enough to eat out of the box and even those who don't. You will love it.

I have raved about Ecstasea in my earlier reviews, and I am enthused once again to do the same for Fantasea! What an idea! Kudos! Full marks to this joint for innovation and taste. It is all about coastal and north-eastern tribal cuisine along with the regular seafood delicacies.
Here's why I would recommend this place to all and sundry:

1) Novelty - food is one important source of happiness and well-being in our times. It is the easiest way of exploratory living in a busy, drab city life, so it only makes sense to try something unique like this. Bansa Pora mutton and Julu Pitha - an interesting twist to the regular tale of bread and meat...dive right in!

2) Taste - well, it is surely above average, if not divine. To know more, read about what I ordered:
a)¬†¬† ¬†Complimentary Tankha Turani - sweet gesture, cooled rice soup drink with a dash of mustard, curry leaves and red chilly aroma thrown in. Nothing spectacular or appetizing, but interesting!
b)¬†¬† ¬†Julu Pitha ‚Äì Soft floury dough baked into fluffy bread, filled with meat shredded and boiled eggs ‚Äì tantalizing enough to seduce any Bengali palate. It is served with two amazing chutneys - one spicy and one sweet. The whole combination is mind blowing!
c)¬†¬† ¬†Bansa Pora Mutton ‚Äì Served out of bamboo containers ‚Äì no obvious flavor of bamboo really, just lip-smacking kosha mangsho ‚Äì goes awesomely well with Julu Pitha. So you have bread, boiled egg, chicken keema and mutton kosha ‚Äì a sureshot way to tingle the ‚ÄòBong Culinary Fantasy‚Äô.
d)¬†¬† ¬†Jadoh Rice ‚Äì Red, flavorful, spicy rice, generously laced with tender mutton cubes, and herbs. High on taste and aroma.
e)¬†¬† ¬†Voksa Meh ‚Äì This for me took the cake! Very light mutton curry, seasoned with delicate herbs and pepper chillies / capsicum. Brilliantly done, a must try with rice or Jadoh. 

3) Ambience ‚Äì Lovely frescoes with tribal and underwater theme! Bamboo furniture and glasses to drink out of ‚Äì certainly ups the uniqueness quotient.

4) Pricing ‚Äì Last but not the least ‚Äì pocket pinch here is rather low. Food is great and service very courteous! It cost me about Rs 1000 for all of the above, so if you are a moderate eater, a dinner for two would cost you about Rs 500.

So ring in the New Year with a dinner with your loved ones at Santa‚Äôs Fantasea! It is on the lane beside Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. 

Happy Julu Dining to you!

Now this one is an excellent place to have a meal. This is fairly a new place serving seafood and coastal cuisine. Located in the lane just beside Anjali jewellers,it is a small restaurant with a simple ambience. We got seated and was offered a complimentary drink made of rice. It was very refreshing. We ordered their signature dish Bansha pora along with Julu pitha which is a kind of steamed bun stuffed with chicken keema and egg. The bansha pora was marvellous. It was divine. This is wat u call finger licking food. It went very well with the bread. Alongside this we also ordered a squid starter which was not in the menu but a chef speciality. It was amazing too. Service was excellent and pricing is just perfect. All these came to just rs 500. A must visit place

Wonderful experience.. 
Being a seafood lover.. Was looking for a pocket friendly food joint. Voila! Santa's fantasea is the answer. Went on a saturday afternoon.. Ate like a monster.here is my order.. Tankha turani ( complimentary)
Shanghai squid , smoked crab , julu pitha , bansh pora , mixed seafood rice , red pepper octopus , prawn sukha , fried mackrel. 
Loved each n every dish.. The server guided us through the menu n suggested the dishes n none of them failed.. N the bill came out to be 1650 only despite ordering such wide spread. 
Certainly going back for this under water deep sea diving experience. 
Keep up the good work! With

This restaurant is a vanguard of a food-movement to liberate Kolkata-food lovers from the clutches of 'chicken butter masala'. The idea of this restaurant is just fantastic and absolutely beyond the realm of 'conventional thinking'. In a society where people are blindly running towards food chains, once nurtured, but now shunned by the West (likes of McD, KFC...) Fantasea dares to do things differently and stun its patrons with its originality.

Every bite of food is AMAZING and what makes it even more exciting is the simplicity of the preparations. In my few visits so far, I have tried: (1) Baked fish (2) Naga tok (3) Baansh pora mutton (4) Smoked crab (5) Prawn fry (6) lal ghosht (7) shanghai squid (8) octopus with red pepper. ALL the items were delicately prepared and were EXQUISITE. Some times when the owner briskly describes the recipes to you, it seems so simple and in that simplicity is the mastery behind the cooking. A lot of effort has been invested by the owners in educating himself on tribal cuisine as well as training the chefs in the art of tribal cooking. I applaud the owners for taking in all this effort to push their vision.

FANTASEA is definitely a place you would want to try out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. As a food-lover I always feel it is our duty to support restaurants and restaurateurs who have a food vision and are not hesitant to try something new and who are thoughtful about what they are serving. The decor, the food, the furniture and the PRICE is just fantastic. To me, in terms of novelty, this restaurant is right up with the Anjon's 'Oh Calcutta!' which was an attempt to make Bengali cuisine more mainstream. In stead of always turning to the West, that novelty can be achieved right here is a lesson well learnt from this restaurant. I wish the restaurant the best and hope it scales new heights...¬†

One little point: may be if the restaurant focuses more on the Tribal part - that'll be a better label for it (rather than both Tribal and sea-food). This change although apparently small, will require a lot of change in the branding... but honestly, as long as they keep on doing what they are doing now - I couldn't care less about such embellishments

If I had not visited the place I could have never imagined such a wonderful food joint existed in Golpark hidden amongst the crowded residential area. It's a gem of a restaurant. Words can't describe the tango my taste buds had as I went out to dine there. The place gives an authentic feel of tribal India with its ambience , welcome drink and main course. From squids, octopus , crabs to our regular mutton and Bhetki everything was built according to tribal cuisine of Orissa and northeast . I particularly savoured the banspora mutton. The bamboo flavored mutton was a real treat for the taste buds. It was particularly clear my first experience with squid and octopus won't be last. Food was fresh and to top it served by a very cordial staff . Service was fast and as by the price it was damn cheap.

We orderd Kerela Mutton soup nd Bansa Pora wd traditional tribal rotis for d first session..;) :P
The flavour of Kerela mutton soup ws somethin i hv nvr experienced before nd ws excellent.. Bansa Pora too had an uniqueness about it..
2nd session comprised of mixed seafood rice wd smoked octopus.. very standard preparations..well served.. quantity may b a tad bit on d lower side..
Overall a wonderful hangout place.. easy on d pocket..wd a fresh uncommon tribal cuisine to check out..
Kerela Mutton soup was d standout dish for me..

Delightful memories from my first two visits compelled me to visit again today. We were greeted with Tankha Turani, a rice drink with spices and herbs. Bansa pora lacked its characteristic smoky flovour. The mutton was also undercooked. However our disappointment was gone after devouring on Ngatok, boneless fish in spicy condiments and cooked to perfection. We also tried the Cheesy Tuna Salad which was another surprise as was the red mixed seafood rice in gravy which came in handsome quantity. The staff were really cordial throwing in suggestions. Prices are also justified taking into account the quality and quantity of the the food. Must visit if you want to experiment and not be disappointed

Okay.. another great venture from the Ecstasea owners. When I stumbled onto this one on Zomato, I could not wait to take my partner there.. the menu is so very promising.. Last evening, this was our dinner date. Not too hard to find the place -lane beside Golpark Anajli Jewellers - just keep walking for a minute. Good effort on the decor to reflect a seafood / tribal theme. A complimentary welcome drink was also served . We wanted to try the tribal flavours and ordered Bansa pora, Jadoh Rice, Julu Pitha and  Ngatok. Items were good, distinct and satisfactory. However, being the in-depth food critics that we are, we had some concerns: Bansa pora had a wonderful smoked flavour, but the nature of preparation ( curry-type ) downgraded the smokiness. Also, the quantity-price ratio could have been better. The rice was good , but nothing extraordinary in terms of flavour.Julu pitha was unique and nice, no complaints here. The fish was a paturi-kind - but the quality of fish should be improved, especially since this is a seafood speciality.

Overall experience - left us wishing for more - in terms of flavour. This is exactly what we felt for the Ecstasea outlet aswell. The owners are doing a great job, serving good food at affordable prices, but there is a lack of that perfect notch  of finesse in terms of the flavours of the dishes that would make them worth dying for. The lack of effort on that takes away half a point from me.

But,then again, it is just our opinion. The mango people are already dying for this only, so why bother as long as the business is running well :)

A complete surprise package in the heart of golpark. Went there after recommendation from the one and only Mir and was not disappointed at all. The complementary drink tankha turani, a rice based tribal drink was really nice, a unique test for a drink. Then came the famous bansa pora ,which was an outstanding dish. The perfect balance of smoked flavour blending with the really spicy mutton was something hard to forget. Though we felt that the preparation could have been served a bit little warmer. Nevertheless, it was awesome.
As of main course, we ordered mixed seafood rice with gravy, smoked squid and chicken in oyester sauce. All of them were well cooked, I found the squid a little overspicy, which is not a bad thing if you are cool with that. The mixed seafood rice was adequate to serve two people, and you could really taste the octopus, squids, in there unaltered flavour, chicken in oyester sauce was also pleasant to taste.
The restaurant decor is quite tribal ,some tribal music would have been better, the owner was personally taking care of all the customers.
Overall, it was a lovely evening spent at Santa's fantasea, and I wouldn't mind going back there over and over again.

Wow! Now all the wonders of the world are off the beaten track, my sincere belief is reiterated when I travelled off the main road from Golpark and stmbled upon the rather unimpressive doorway of Santa's Fantasea: but my gosh it left me impressed. Not to mention that my co diner was the one and only Mir, according to his patent dialogue the place is "Awesome sala". Painstakingly done authentic decor the food is mind blowing. The Basa pora, has nothing to do with Bassa fish but an amazing experience of mutton roasted in a bamboo. The Julu pitha is brilliant. Their crabs melt in the mouth. The steamed crab has a slight hint of lemongrass which is the best use of the stuff ever, just right. Their squid is soft and juicy too. All in all a place where Abar khabo repeatedly comes to mind

what a fantastic place! ¬†i thank zomato big time for bringing this place to my notice. ¬†today two of my friends and i went there and were instantly amazed by it's beautiful decor which is divided into two sections- sea food and tribal. however you can eat sea food in the tribal section and vice-versa (personally i liked the tribal section better). ¬†we ordered mixed seafood rice, mixed seafood flat noodles, smoked squid and octopus in chili garlic sauce. you can find plenty of fish, squid and octopus in both the rice and noodles. the rice was good while the noodles very very flavorful. the octopus was tasty too but what won us over was the smoked squid- an absolutely heavenly preparation, one of the best delicacies i have ever tasted! the quantity is quite good and the prices very reasonable. our total bill was 590. they did not even charged for the tax!!!¬†

the staff is attentive, polite and would make helpful suggestions. however we were not given the complimentary welcome drink until we asked about it. but i am so satisfied with the over all experience that i would rather ignore that. ¬†will definitely visit again. ¬†:)

Me and my wife visited this place on a weekday during evening and was a little sceptical to find that we were the only people in the restaurant. But when the food was served I felt like the food critic who had just tasted ratatouille. Santa's fantasea is an amazing place and they really take great care to the food that they are serving. Their bansa pora is just amazing with succulent mutton which literally melts in your mouth. We were told that the mutton is marinated for 24 hours and then cooked in bamboo for 3 hours. The initial scepticism of an empty resraurant instantly went away the moment we tasted the food. All in all I must say that santa's fantasea has a great product to offer to the people of kolkata. And I really want to queue up in front of their restaurant and pay for my meal and thank them for bringing tribal cuisine to us. I really want to see this restaurant succeed and am waiting for the next time to visit with my friends. I wish Santa's Fantasea all the very best and keep up serving the delicious foods that I sampled.

Visited this restaurant with my friends last night. And some of the dishes were so good that we ended up placing more orders even though we were almost full. I would recommend their Bonsho Pora ... tender, juicy, spicy (not much though), boneless Mutton stuffed inside a Bamboo stick and then that is kind'a burnt/smoked using charcol. Just A-W-E-S-O-M-E!! You can have it either with Jadoh (li'l spicy red rice mixed with juicy, boneless Mutton that looks like Biryani but tastes even better) or you can have Soru Chaglir Roti (another unique item!).
We also tried out Smoked Crab, Smoked Pomfret and Smoked Octopus. All three were just DELICIOUS with Pomfret being the best among the three. The typical blakish sauce that they are using on the top of these smoked dishes is just a reason to visit this place once again. On our honest request, they actually served a bowl of that sauce also! And it was too good with all the dishes!
Ambience was also very good. Price very much reasonable. Only thing I would suggest you guys is that the quantity of Mutton should be li'l bit more in case of Bansho Pora. I actually called the owner and gave this honest feedback as he was open to over the phone feedback. If they can increase the quantity of Mutton as I said, this new restaurant is gonna be my weekend destination for next N number of weekends!

Visited the newbie in the city on an idle Saturday evening with friends and expectation of treating taste buds with a break. What an appropriate choice it was! The place was small yet cozy with theme decor (keeping balance with tribal cuisine) and the staffs were cordial.
We started with a complementary tribal drink made of rice and rich Indian spices served in bamboo mugs (did not like much). The following experience was just too good to express with my limited capability in literature. Every dish had an unique new taste and flavour which truly impressed all of us. The smoked seafood were wonderful (crabs, pomfret and octopus) complemented by a wonderful and unique inhouse sauce. The signature dish Bansa Pora (boneless mutton smoked in fresh bamboo stem) induced with a fabulous and unique flavour of burnt bamboo in the meat is a must try. The Jadoh (rice cooked with rich Indian spices and boneless mutton) is also a must have dish. Soru chakuli goes equally well with Bansa Pora. I am definitely visiting the place again.

Suggestions for improvement :
1. Bansa Pora should be served in a increased portion.
2. There should be some innovative options around deserts as well to complement the other sections of the menu.

Finally I visited this place. We were greeted with a complimentary drink - Tankha Turani, a rice based drink with a taste of red chilli, coriander, mustard seeds and ginger. Tasted very South Indian to me. They were served in typical North-eastern glasses made of bamboo.
As we visited this place in the evening hours, we were not that hungry so we just ordered their signature dish Bansa Pora - a tribal dish where mutton is stuffed into fresh bamboo sticks and cooked on fire. The mutton was soft, tender and quite spicy. Just the way I love it. There was a distinct flavour of the bamboo as well.Prices are very reasonable. The decor is cool. I am definitely coming back soon to try out the other tribal and sea food dishes.

Slightly hidden from the view, tucked in a bend in the road is Santa's Fantasea. Do not get me wrong with the "tucked in the bend" metaphor, for this restaurant is located within 50 meters distance from Golpark. Santa's Fantasea has belled the cat of innovative idea by going an out and out tribal and sea food cuisine. If you are walking into this restaurant, you better be ready to wonder what is there on your plate and then be completely stumped by the awesomeness of the whole deal.
The owner has taken the trouble to pay some attention to the decor and the furniture. The area is divided into two sections - the tribal cuisine area and the sea food area, marked by the decor of course.¬†
Once inside are greeted with the complimentary drink of Tankha Turani. It is a fermented rice drink from Orissa, with just the right hint of spice. Do not miss the Bansa Pora, which is a mutton delicacy made by marinating the mutton kheema. It is then stuffed into a bamboo and cooked in tandoor. Compliment this with the Julu Pitha which is a sort of steamed bread that is stuffed with chicken kheema and egg. Together, they make the perfect yummy combo. Another very fascinating item in their menu is the smoked octopus, pardon my exoticization. Also, the mutton steamed in banana leaves.
Overall, options galore for those who are tired of the regular fare and are looking for something more. The owner of the place is usually around to help you with the menu and explaining each dish.
So what are you waiting for? Walk in and have a great experience!

Santa's Fantasea- A place where Santa comes with a Bag full of Food Fantasy. One of the newest joint in Kolkata with speciality in Sea food and Tribal delicacies is also the sister joint of Ecstasea.

It was a normal Saturday lunch and there was constant buzz about Fantasea across the city, so we hoped in. The first look into the decor was the mix of sea world and tribal handcraft wall decor with crafted bamboo chairs which caught the eye. Next thing as a first timer we were pondering across the menu, Kaushik Da came in as a host and made some excellent suggestions.

It started with Tonko Turani(a tribal drink made from rice) and Kerala Muttion soup(minced mutton with coconut basil leaves curry leaves) and Bonso Pora(this is must try...marinated mutton cooked in bamboo stem in tandoor for a long tym)..then Smoked Squids and Octopus with chilli garlic sauce. Smoked Crab was the next in the menu...the BEST QUALITY CRAB I've ever had. The key thing about the preparation is every dish has its own uniqueness which actually shows how much culinary expertise have been involved. To end up we had Tuna Cheese Salad..one of the fantastic mix.

The Best part comes next. The pricing of each item is one of the cheapest in the town and the quality of the food served is one of the best. The ambience, the aroma and the warm hospitability of Kaushik Da and Avijit Da will make your visit heart-filled. A Must Go Guyss!!

Cheers!!

Well I am already feeling quite happy writing review for this lovely food joint. Let me share a piece of info...Santa's Fantasea and Ecstasea(Sarat Bose Road) are owned by same people. So people who are fans of Ecstatsea can come to this place with eyes closed. So coming to the decor of the place...its absolutely amazing...a ground floor of a house is intelligently converted to a exotic Tribal n Sea Food joint. We were given the complimentary welcome drink - Tankha Turani (tribal drink). It was different n tasty. Then we ordered - Bansa Pora(mutton marinated n stuffed in bamboo n cooked in tandoor) with Julu Pitha(stuffed tribal bread). Guys u need to try out these...they r just too yummy. Then after the tribal experiance we just plunged into the sea food ordering Smoked Octopus and Veg hakka rice noodles. The experiance was great. Had lovely time talking to the owner whom we remembered from Ecstasea. ¬†Highly recommended. Lovely food with minimal pocket pinch. Way to go guys..

A big "thank you" to zomato for listing this wonder food joint. For a major change in the taste buds of kolkatans, presenting to you SANTA'S FANTASEA. the name itself is derived from santhals implying tribal and sea demarcating sea food. I had long forgotten the taste of tribal bamboo chicken since I left vizag's araku valley. Of course no where I tuna available in kolkata at so low prices except in goa. The goa fever and andhra fever combined together gives you SANTA'S FANTASEA. My first venture to this joint was probably this pujo's choturthi. Could not resist myself and revisited it on shoshti. Reached golpark, found anjali jewellers. Beside it was this joint. When we went inside what attracted me was the beautiful decor. One phase was the sea food section, where there was a mermaid, fishes, octopus, prawns. The blue ambience gave a feeling that I was scuba diving undersea with the colourful creatures and mermaid aroud me. The next section was however the tribal section. It was all green. Had cutouts of village huts and alponas done on the walls. Small tribal sculptures lay there. What looked fantastic was the tribal man's face sculpted out with finesse. Then came in our complimentary drink. The tankha turani. A rice drink from odisha which was all spicy and tasted a bit different. The copper utensils, the cane mugs, the wood salt pepper stand. Added to the tribal ambience. What was missing was a tribal music. Solely recommended. Then it was our turn to look at the menu. What amazingly struck me was the bansa pora.  Reminded me of vizag and I immediately ordered it. It is mutton marianated and put in bamboo and then of course tandoored. It was excellent ans too delicious that I wanted one more of it. But then my bestie suggested we shoud try octopus. The owner of the shop came in just then and suggested we should definitely try the smoked octopus. The smell was so appealing and the taste was out of the world. What struck me was the taste of food had some similarity with the food from ectasea. And I was correct when the owner confirmed it was their second venture post ectasea. And then a litchi ice cream worked all wonders. The next day I went in. Squid was all I wanted . The smoked squid was I could aim for. The smoked squid was amazing. Then we went in for the masala tuna. After a long time I had the original tuna instead of just the tuna paste. The masala tuna was amazing. A must try. And to team it up,there was their speciality- the mixed flat noodles. It tasted amazingly good. What a lovely plethora of food they offer. Experimental dishes. And a seafood lover's delight. The tribal food is first of its  kind in kolkata. A thumbs up for the attempt and execution.  The dishes are spicy though. But will definitely revisit it innumerable number of times. Rock on!!

Great food! The most interesting part is the very distinct flavour that you get in every dish so you can seperately enjoy each. Nice setting with those bamboo tables and chairs, keeping up to the tribal feel. Good hospitality as well(atleast for now, that it is new). Ps. Don't miss the baansh pora mutton!

A restaurant serving tribal food in Calcutta is probably the first of its kind. Santa's Fantasea has two distinct types of cuisines - the tribal cuisine and the seafood section. On my visit, I decided to try both.

I reached there on a weekday afternoon with 3 of my friends, and got a table quite easily. The staffs were extremely cordial, especially the gentleman who seemed to be the owner. He explained to us the various tribal dishes available on the menu and also suggested the top dishes.¬†

We were greeted with a complimentary welcome drink, Tankha Turani, a rice based drink, which is otherwise a part of the menu. It was a drink with a taste very different from everything else I had tasted before. It tasted of rice, it tasted of tempered spices - red chilli, coriander, mustard seeds, ginger. Tasted quite good.

We ordered -¬†
1. Bansa Pora - mutton was soft, tender, spicy, perfectly cooked and yummy. A signature dish of this restaurant and a must try.
2. Julu Pitha - Tasted similar to Tingmo(Tibetan Steam Buns) but with a meat filling. It was nice, but not extraordinary.
3. Thai Seafood Noodle Salad - the least favourite order of the day. It had nothing close to any Thai flavours. Thai flavours r strong, spicy, lemony - this was complete opposite. Some boiled flat noodles and seafood tossed with some mayo. A complete disappointment.
4. Squid in chilli garlic sauce - tangy, tasty, fresh squid.
5. Baked Crab - the sauce seemed similar in taste to the chilli garlic sauce. It was nice, but the crab was not too fleshy. It was slightly disappointing not to get fresh crabs in a seafood restaurant.
6. Crab in Coco Lime Sauce - sauce tasted fantastic, with the subtle flavours of coconut and gondhoraj lemon. The problem with this crab was same - not fleshy enough.
7. Fish in green sauce - the best among the seafood options that we ordered. The sauce tasted amazingly smooth and flavourful. Highly recommended.
8. Mixed Seafood Rice - Quite good. Loaded with seafood. Makes your tummy quite happy.

All in all, This place is a nice cosy nook to drop in once in a while when you have seafood craving. The best part is that it does not burn a hole in your pocket!

I would have rated it 4.5, but taking away the 0.5 for the slow service. I hope they improve upon that in future.

Their tribal food is a welcome & innovative addition to cuisines available in Calcutta. The Bansa pora - mutton flavoured by and served in bamboo - was very well prepared as was the appam-like bread that we had alongside.  The flat noodles and the prawns were quite tasteful.  The owner spends time finding out about preferences and makes intelligent suggestions.  Highly recommended.

I Visited this spl place on Sashti late night, 29th sept!! These are the same guys behind the superbly spl restaurant "ecstasea " in lake road.
Being a place that serves tribal cuisine, the decor too is tribal in nature with mud walls, tribal masks etc.
Coming to the food.., well if you want to experiment and try out cuisines that are different and exotic then this place won't disappoint you.. The menu comprises tribal cuisine mainly from the North East, Orissa and Bengal ...
We had tankha Turani , a fermented rice drink from Orissa, was spicy and sour and just right to beat the heat... Next we had Bansa pora, mutton cooked inside bamboo and served hot along with a spl roti that's made of rice flour.. The mutton was soft and tender and mildly spiced and was just awesome... Lastly we had the mixed seafood flat noodles with prawn fry... Hv had similar flat noodles in the streets of Bangkok and must say this one tastes better!!
Highly recommended for people that love exotic cusine... Will definitely be back soon!!

The Bansa pora is a must try. stuffed beat within bamboo and grilled .

This kind of cuisine is happening for the first time in Kolkata. 

The location of the restaurant is also at a prominent place. Just behind the Anjali jewellers showroom in Golpark.

This year my puja started with this restaurant. I and my bestie hit this joint on chaturthi for lunch. It is near golpark anjali jewellers. Very nice and innovative d√©cor it has. There are two sections of this joint- sea food section where the wall is painted with sea colour and sea creatures like octopus are drawn on it. And another one is tribal food section where the wall is painted with tribal masks and idols. As we settled down they offered complementary drinks which tasted awesome and tasted like chhaas but a bit thicker and creamy and had masalas. We ordered bansa pora from tribal section and smoked octopus from sea food section. Bansa pora, small boneless mutton pieces cooked within bamboo pieces which is delicious served with a thick tomato chilli sauce, i think li'l bit of tamarind was also added. Smoked octopus is very spicy and prepared with lemon grass and other herbs and sauces. For dessert we ordered litchi ice cream which is truly yummy. Price is reasonable and pocket friendly. A must visit for foodies who love to experiment.

We were one of the first customers at this seafood and tribal food place located at Golpark(the lane beside Anjali Jewellers,near Mouchak). The interiors are decorated with tribal art motifs and the ambiance was in sync with the theme. We ordered Bansa Pora,Baked Crab,Crispy Fried Prawns,Mixed Seafood Rice and Flat Noodles. The service was prompt and we were served a complimentary drink. Coming to the food,the Bansa Pora was excellent and is highly recommended. The seafood was also fresh and succulent. However,the food was extremely spicy(specially the crab) and that might pose a problem to people. 
The owner and the staff were extremely hospitable and kept coming back to enquire about our experience. Here's wishing Santa's Fantasea a successful run. I would definitely visit again.

P.S-If the owner is reading this,a small suggestion would be to ensure that the cutlery is also in sync with the theme. Though the glasses and pitchers have a rustic feel,white dishes spoil the mood.
Apart from that,this place is fantastic. Will recommend to all.

This place is apparently run by the Ecstasea owners. I would suggest visiting Ecstasea for the octopus and sea food in general and this place for the tribal fare
