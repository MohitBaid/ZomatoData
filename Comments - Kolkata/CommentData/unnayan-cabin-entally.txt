Very average place. Its an old eatery, I have had their food only once. Chicken kabab was the dish I parcelled, small pieces of chicken fried in mustard oil along with capcicums and onions, the latter being in excess.

I have visited this place quite a few times. Food items served here are always hot and fresh. I normally go for the Special Moghlai Paratha and Egg Chicken Roll. I really like this place everything is so clean here. Pocket friendly no doubt.

I understand that we care for ambience, suited waiters, wifi facilities in a restaurant (lol) but end of day we spend our money on good food ..
Unnayan cabin is a place where you find the last one... 
A very humble owner,mostly no MSG Chinese food & very very pocket friendly..

My choice:
-------------
Chicken kebab- a different style 
Alu dom - some locals pay for even the curry without allo.
Moglai paratha - very best bengali style
Roll - Chicken roll's are awesome.
Noodles- lightweight & tasty.
Chicken & fish kabiraji Cutlet !

Try once

This one of the oldest restaurant in the area. It is just located opposite of Entally market. It serves plenty of foods. I had tasted tarka roti,chowmin, vegetable chop. Everything are awesome.
