This is really close to jadavpur university and this was the place we always looked upto for fresh birthday cakes. 
They were cheap and fresh.. 
Took almost 12-13 birthday cakes over 2 years.

Bake Club has been consistent in its products; I wish the management paid more attention to the marketing policies. I’m really disappointed that the Gariahat outlet folded up, and find it baffling since it always used to run out of stock by evening…implying steady sales. The cakes and savouries are of a reasonably good standard, though not outstanding. I particularly liked the combo-meals that were earlier available; I think they should be re-introduced.

A nicely curated bakery with sumptuous confectionery delicacies. It is indeed a popular hub and scores ahead of its peers in the Jadavpur area with unmatched quality and variety.
The signature croissants and chicken bone pakoras are a must try.

Gone are the days of Khaboush and heavenly fish orly. The shop seemed more organized and cleaner than the last time I visited, almost a year or so ago. I relied on my old trusted Bake Club last week between a lengthy 3 part exam and although quality has dropped quite a bit, it did serve the purpose well...i.e wholesome food in reasonable price.

I got myself a chicken egg croissant and a plate of pan fried momo. The hunger pangs were calmed but the croissant seemed a bit stale(thankfully, it didn't cause any stomach upset...so it might not be stale but just some kinda funny smell). I did miss the little nuggets of chocolates of 15rs a piece that remained in the cabinets!

Safe to say, this place still is my go to place when I'm near 8B bus stand and hoping for a quick fix in a budget.

This outlet of Bake Club is located in the 8B area of Jadavpur opposite to the Tollygunge Ranikuthi auto stands. The outlet has a good amount of accommodation space although there are no seating facilities. The space is better than most other Mio Amore or similar confectionary outlet in Kolkata. The place also has a large variety of delicious food items available. We had Fish Orley and Chicken Garlic Kebab. The Chicken Garlic Kebab was incredibly tasty and at Rs. 65 is absolutely worth it. It had last succulent pieces of chicken with a sweet outer covering. The Fish Orley tasted good as well. The staff were quick and prompt in the midst of the place being full with people.

We have been to this place several times and have always loved this place for both the snacks and pastries. But this time we had the worst experience. We did order for a chicken patty and chicken lollipop and wanted to have some pastries later. But THE LOLLIPOP WAS ROTTEN which we came to realize after we had almost two - third of the item. Feeling disgusted on having such bad food we demanded not to be charged for the lollipop. The owner (or worker, I'm not sure) replied to us such disrespectfully and made implications that we had as much as we could (of the lollipop) but didn't want to pay (even though the food was stinking of rot!) Being fed unreasonably bad food and being treated with such disrespect we involved in verbal arguments. This man was very aggressive and threatened us saying he was from 'EI ELAKA' ( the locality) and he tried to be aggressive physically. I don't know maybe if he was not stopped by a gentleman (probably from the same shop) this man would have gotten physical! He was that aggressive!

My point is, if one is treated so disrespectfully and even threatened physically just because he claimed not to be charged for a rotten food, i don't know what to expect as a customer!

Worst experience ever..we took chicken spring roll,chicken croissant,garlic kebab and chocolate truffle...the non-veg items are not fresh,too much spicy and unhygienic (to be precise)...too much sweetness in pastries...found it extravagant(too much sauce in every food as if trying vaguely to hide the food quality).. keep some spare change for antacids...

Located at Central Road of Jadavpur 8b area...visited this joint quite sometimes in past but never actually did the bakery chain could satisfy my taste buds...

The cakes and pastries are way below the standard...chocolate pastries lack the gooey chocolate content...all what you get is bread and only bread in the cake..the snacks items are comparatively better than the bakery ones..

Ordered birthday cake for mother few years back which looked innovative but tasted extremely poor and stuck like a chewing gum in the mouth. Inside it was no layer of cream but bread and only bread. Very disappointing!

Prices are average...but quality should improve to stand pari passu to the market competitors...

Lets talk about food quality,the quality of the chicken is not to soft with respect to arambagh....but taste was good...the flavour of garlic was too good and strong....specially according to its price its good...u can try it....hope you would like it..

Located near the Jadavpur 8B bus stand,this branch of Bake Club is a popular choice among customers for years.
The Lunch Pack(Pulao with 2 pieces of Curry Chicken)is fast-selling,being sold out before 1pm.
The Chicken Sandwich,Chicken Egg Club Sandwich,Chicken Croissant have the same delicious chicken and mayo filling.
Having visited this place for many years now,the Chicken Garlic Kebab,Chicken Spring Roll, Chicken Cutlet,Italian Chicken Bowl are the items I've personally loved to eat again and again.
One thing is certain for all the above mentioned food items : you're assured a good quantity for the price you're paying.
The Chocolate coating on the Cream Rolls was too sugary for my liking,but other items of confectionery are pretty good.

Love most things made here. The veg spring rolls and the chicken penguin is my absolute favourite. I end up munching them before I can click a single picture usually because I'm famished and secondly, they taste great. 
Also took a pack of cookies for tea, the coconut almond flavoured, and they were crisp and delish, tasted homemade, despite the slightly high prices. 
Definitely my favourite bakery right now, way better than the Mio Amores and Sugar and Spices.

Chicken Croissant, lemon tart are the best. Also there is a range of veg and nonveg snacks that one can try. Affordable price.
Cons- No sitting arrangement provided.

Like many other confectionery shops in the city this place is also a good option for having a quick bite whenever you feel hungry. Tried only this outlet of Bake club for a few times. They have large variety of items in their menu including various cakes, pastries and snacks for both veg and non-veg sections. Chicken crossiant tasted delicious as well as the chicken sandwich. Also tried chicken garlic kebab and it was pretty good. From the sweets section I have only tried Choco kaju pastry and it tasted too good. So definitely thumbs up for this place for serving quality foods at affordable prices.

A pocket friendly good place for a quick bite to satisfy your hunger prangs. Stands out from the other places who offer similar eating options because of the quality and taste of the bakes and cakes they sell. The lemon tart is the best pastry for me from the wide range they offer. The chicken italian from the savoury menu is rich and creamy loaded with cheese and chunky pieces of chicken.

This is a famous bakery shop in Jadavpur area. I got parcelled Chocolate Pastry, Chicken Egg Club Sandwich, Italian Chicken Bowl and Chicken Tikka Roll from here. Pastry was nice, chocolate cream was fresh but little sweeter as per my liking. Sandwich and Tikka Roll were mind-blowing. Italian Chicken Bowl was full of cheese and shredded chicken and tasted great.

The prices are very pocket-friendly and the place could be tried for some light munching.

Visiting  Bake Club after 5 long years took me back to my childhood days. This is a place I make sure I visit whenever visiting Kolkata. After soo many years the place is still the same, serving some marvelous bakery delicacies at pocket friendly prices. I had my staple Chicken Croissant, the filling of cream mayo chicken and egg inside the croissant makes a delicious dish all together. I also tried their other  delicacies and all were very delicious.

Sometimes when you are satisfied with the food from not so high hope wala place you feel elated. Thats exactly what happened with me. I must admit Bake club is not my first preference when it comes to tit bits and snacks. Well i was quite tired with having the same items from mio amore who hardly introduce new items in their menu and hence gave this outlet a try. Took away some chicken lillipops and choco crunch. The lollipops are very cheap, big in size and tasted awesome which was as i mentioned earlier unexpected. Choco crunch was okayish. Overall a one time try is worth it.

Located right next to the Jadavpur Bazaar, this outlet is definitely an eye-catcher with all the Illuminati. The best part about this outlet is that you shall get fresh items on board unlike some of their other outlets. The Chicken Garlic Kebab, Panache and Sandwiches are really nice. The variety of bread that they offer is also pretty vast. If asked, I shall suggest to pick up their Cheese and Garlic Bread, which is freshly baked. Overall, a pretty decent food joint for a quick bite.

While passing by the streets of the CIT market situated near 8B bus stand, Jadavpur, your eyes fall onto the beautiful cakes and the lightening board of bake club. 
I entered with friends and decided to have one of their extensive varieties of pastry available. I tried their chocolate pastry and it was well done! The base was spongy and fresh. The chocolate quality seemed good and fresh as if it was prepared quite recently. Overall, I would recommend this outlet and rate it 4/5!

This is one of the oldest outlet of Bake Club.
Food will taste good if you visit in the early hours of the day cause the food you get is fresh then. The quality of cakes have degraded from earlier which is disappointing. Also the place is pocket friendly.

Few things which you must try from here are :

Chicken Pizza.
Garlic-chicken kebab.

There lies a huge scope of improvement in terms of quality of food.

Went there today (15.9.2016) to buy a cake for my sister's birthday. They were too few choices to choose from. Hardly 5-6 cakes were there. Most of them were chocolate cakes. I chose a heart-shaped cake with choco chips on top. It cost 250bucks and extra 5bucks for the packet. The cake looked nice and tasted good too. My sis liked it very much. So did the others in my family. They are doing good business and are far ahead compared to Sugar and Spice and Bake Paradise.

I think, Bake Club should gain popularity. People Choose crappy places like CCD and Barista and pay high prices, when in bake club you can just chill as well, with a coffee or tea or some cold-sweet drink, and some pastries, some cookies or biscuits and a variety of light-food, its a place with a Heart. I would often stop by for an evening snack at Bake Club.

I had never visited bake club prior to the start of my college life. However it has since become a valued haunt specially if my wallet is on the lighter side. Though 8b is fraught with similar places like Mio Amore, Sugar and spice, Bake paradise etc. This remains my favourite. It offers a wide variety of both savoury and sweet items which are quite different both in appearance and taste ( good different definitely). To start with savoury items, the chicken Italian sub is both filling and tasty as is the chicken egg croissant. Both the paneer and chicken garlic kebab are excellent. Fish paniquat and crispy chicken are two other dishes which are immensely filling as well as good for the palate. However my favourite is certainly the chicken full moon tart, the tart itself is flaky and the filling is yummy and succulent. The sweet dishes are good too... specially the Casatta, green apple ( it's very creamy though) and the ganache. Point to mention is their personal bakery items...I'm a huge fan of their Nan Khatai cookies.

All the crowd happens to come here because of their fresh and hot foods. Chicken Italiano, Spring rolls ,kebabs,Patties are some of the favourites of this place. More or less all the items served hot and tasty and that also at a very affordable price to suffice your hunger during your daily schedule is nothing but a blessing in disguise .

This is the best outlet of Bake Club in the city. The other outlets did not impress me half as much as this outlet has done. Located opposite to the gate number 2 of Jadavpur University it is the best confectionery store in that area as well. It usually stays crowded almost always as it is the goto place for many people planning to have a quick snack. The items are all very fresh and extremely tasty,a quality which the other outlets of Bake Club lacks. I have had their kebabs and I just love them. If you ever visit this outlet don't miss out on the kebabs. The chicken pieces were pretty big and spicy. It tasted amazingly good. I had their chicken croissant which was extremely heavy and tasted good too. The sandwiches here are like those served in other confectionery stores and hence isn't anything mentionable. Either Bake Club as a whole has upped their level or this outlet is exceptionally better than the other outlets of the same. I visit this place whenever I am in and around that area.

The chicken croissant, is my favorite of all. Boiled eggs and shredded chicken mixed with mayo, was put inside a sliced open croissant. A toothpick and a napkin, used to cover  and keep the croissant in place. There were pastries, cutlets, momos' and sandwiches, but I am not a fan of those other than the "chicken croissant"

Small place with no seating at all. Believe you folks can grow a large customer base with a seating option

A toothpick and a napkin, used to cover  and keep the croissant in place. There were pastries, cutlets, momos' and sandwiches, but I am not a fan of those other than the "chicken croissant"

Small place with no seating at all. Believe you folks can grow a large customer base with a seating option

A friend of mine gifted me this beautiful cake. I was so happy on receiving it. The cake looks quite beautiful. Small in size though but was appealing.It tasted okahyish and both of us found it a bit dry. The quality and quantity is not that up to the mark. Overall its okhay

I love the kebabs they have. Cheap and good and the portions are well as well. The sandwiches can be tried as well.

I've been to Bake club several times, No complaint about food , as they are tasty and fresh, I tried their Lunch Pack so many times, but this time they are disappointing me , Coz the Pulao is really good ,quantity was good also, but the chicken kosha with that , last two times Tremendous HOT, so much Chilly can't eat the Gravy.
Well @ 65 rs the lunch pack quality is very nice but the chilly are killer, they can reduce that.

This is the place where I visit every alternative day. Located near 8b bus stand. They have a good variety of pastries. I have tried almost each and every variety and all of them are equally delicious. They also provide a lunch box which contains chilli chicken and fried rice. Very handy in a hurried situation. Occasion cakes are very decorative and delicious.

Bake Club has many diehard fans. I have tried most of what they offer.. The sandwiches are nothing more than plain and simple. The patties are not as good as what you get from nearby outlets. Pizza pieces are nothing to talk home about.
The pastries and cakes are good. They also stock icecreams and other fries munchies which I found good. The staff is good. The have a price advantage over the big brands. 
I am keen to try their lunch packet available in the afternoon. I read that its good.

Bake club is one of the old favourite confectionery and quite popular too.

**Location**
Just on the bylane of the adjacent road to the 8B bus stop. Very  easy to locate.

**Products**
All their products are freshly made and has their own touch which is very appealing.
Try their cakes and pastries very much yum and simple which I like. Plain and simple not trying to do fancy. Also try their cutlet , patties and Garlic Kebab which is quite popular.
A good one indeed.

The first and the original bake club...located in grd floor of the same building that houses Indian coffee house, this place is famous for it's pastries and  cookies and pastries. But my favourite are their steamed and pan fried momos. If you go at the afternoon you can also get lunch packets priced at 55 which consist of pulao and 2 chicken pieces.

Located near 8B Bus stand at Jadavpur, this is one of the better confectionery outlets in this region. Famed for their popular cream rolls, the quality here is usually a notch high up than their neighbours. Try their Cutlets, Patty and definitely the Garlic Kebab. The pricing here may seem to be a bit high but the quality compensates for it. Do not forget to try their cookies as well!

One of the many but also one of the first settling confectionary producers in the area, Bake Club has been a popular choice with a wide base of consumers.

The best thing that Bake Club sold, when it opened its doors, many- many years ago was their huge and delicious Cream Roll. The rear of it was generously dipped in chocolate. The fact is, it still is, but the chocolate is not quite chocolate anymore. It is sugary, crunchy and brittle and gives away to the sheer drop in quality.

Some of the more likeable items on offer are the chicken spring roll, chicken supreme, egg and chicken croissant and also the chicken garlic kebab. The biscuits here are actually great. You should surely get yourself some of those.

The food is merely decent, the proportions are good, but frankly the place is a "Second Choice" kind of a place.

Situated near the 8b bus stand amongst the hustle and bustle of Jadavpur, this place does offer good foods at good prices. Being very close to Jadavpur University, this place has been visited a lot of times by me during my college days. Food quality is decent enough and there are a lot of options also. Pricing is a bit higher than other shops in its category like Mio Amore, Kathleen,  etc. But overall it offers a decent experience and the items available can satisfy the needs of even the hungriest of souls!

Located right beside the entry to the market and the stairs to the Indian Coffee House, this small outlet is a perfect place for some light snacks. I have been visiting this place from the time their outlet was half of what it is now. A welcome move as it is crowded at busy hours with school and college goers gorging on their delicious finger food. 

I would not recommend their bakery products except their cookies which are quite good. The pastries and cake are very average. The highlight of them are the snacks. I have tried quite a lot of items from their menu but my personal favourite is Garlic Kebab and Chicken Drumsticks. The Garlic Kebab is absolutely amazing with five pieces of succulent chicken pieces prepared with Onions and Capsicum and it is on the spicier side. A must must try. 

They dont have any seating area but a zone in their store where you can stand and enjoy your order. Also the items are very pocket friendly.

The Chicken Spring Roll, or the Croissants, or the Cutlets, or the Patties, or just about anything- you can be assured that the quantity is big enough, and the price is low- precisely what college students are looking out for, for a quick bite. Also, their cakes are delicious! Especially, the chocolate ones!

This outlet is very close to my college. Whenever any of our friends have birthdays we buy cake from here. It's very cheap and tastes fine compared to the price. Their rum ball tastes delicious at ₹19. Though it's a bit too sweet so that it might seem difficult for one person to finish off. Among snacks I have tried a chicken item I don't remember the name. It hardly had chicken in it. The breads were huge in size and the chicken was only in the centre.

This outlet of Bake Club is located at Jadavpur 8B, opposite to Bake Paradise and just beside The Sugarr &  Spice. I am a frequent visitor of this outlet. It is a spacious one, moee spacious than the one at Tollygunge. The food quality is aloso very good here. I had their chicken burger, pizza, etc. The Chicken burger is my favorite item. The pastryrs and the cakes are equally good, but somewhere they lack in presentation. I love the chocolate tart. I will definitely visit again.

The items are quite nice. Both confectionary as well as snacks items tastes fabulous. Their bread and dry cake items are also fresh and tasty.

This Bake Club unit (the original unit of Bake Club,before they opened branches in various corners of the city) reminds me of good old nostalgia,when I was a student at Jadavpur University and would frequently come here either to have some item on spot.or for take-away.

Now that I am out of Kolkata due to professional commitments,I rarely find time to visit this place.Even when I am in Kolkata for a short visit,time doesn't really permit to come here.

I used to like earlier version of their brown bread,which was a bit darker in colour and tasted like real brown bread. However,these days,Bake Club Brown Bread is no different from others,with same texture and taste.Would like to know why did you change it.

But in todays modern times,I would be happy if the management of Bake Club ties up with hyperlocal delivery apps like Grofers and Swiggy (a lot of other confectionary chains like Just Baked,Sugarr and Spice,Flurys etc. have already done that). 
In this way,we as customers can easily order items from you sitting at home.

This would be beneficial for consumers,so they would order even more.Also,your sales would also increase manifold. 

Would hope that the management would give some serious thought on my suggestion and would act accordingly so as for their own benefit as well as the benefit of the consumers.

I never ate  cakes from here so I do not know about the quality of cakes they provide.

There's a huge chance of missing maximum of the famous items of you're late! the footfall is very high.  Fish fry, chicken spring roll is a must try for foodies and the bone cutlet is one of the most underrated but hidden tasty item here.  The cream roll and chocolate cakes are really yummy.  I've taken the plain cake a lot of times at home for my parents and elderly people who really don't like the cream.  overall very nice food and perfect pricing also.

In comparison to Mio Amore & Sugar n' Spice this eatery is yet to grasp considerable market share,still it continues to be a favourite hunting spot for many due to its variety in items.They are operating with approximately 9 outlets with the one situated at Jadavpur being the biggest.It is also the one closest to their manufacturing unit & is quite spacious with provisions for back rests.
The items to have are paneer panthraj,chicken supreme,fish fry,fish orly,chicken dolphim & chicken fullmoon.The pastry section also offers wide variety of options like choco cashew,green apple at affordable prices.
When you are little overdone with expenses & your salary account or pocket money requires few more days to be replenished places like Bake Club comes as a saviour. It allows us to enjoy you money's worth by providing a supper or a decent meal for sixty to eighty rupees.I look forward to visit this place more often.

The crispy fried chicken tasted pretty average, in fact in my opinion it was overcooked and the chicken was not fresh. I was not sure whether or not to order a sweet item next, but I am happy I did finally. The choco net was really amazing.

This particular outlet is much better than the one in Santoshpur. The food is fresher and the ambience is a bit better. It's not as small as the one in Santoshpur but they could definitely expand and that would be a good idea. When it comes to chicken sandwiches, Bake Club is very very good. Sometimes, their sandwiches are a bit too dry and I need to gulp down some water with every few bites. Overall, this place is good and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.

This outlet is quite frequented by people running up and down the jadavpur 8b area. The place has much variety in pastries and chicken bread items. But the trays for veg items were mostly empty. I tried a fried item of paneer, cant recall the exact name, it was  triangular in shape with a flour coating and stuffed paneer bhurji inside it. After heating it, the cover was soft and stretchy, somehow it failed to impress me. But on thing which is a must try here is the fried momo. Its the best thing i had from here and shall come back again for it.

I first sampled Fish Orli from this place when I was in high school. They had introduced the mini lunch concepts of Fried rice and chilli Chicken which used to be my favorites along with their Veg Kulcha and Chicken sandwich. The Jadavpur outlet, I believe was one of the first to be opened in Kolkata. Compared to Monjinis and Sugarr and Spice, their snacks were different and tastier. In confectioneries, Melting moments and Nutty Pie were good. Their Rum ball used to be one of my favorites coming second only after Kathleen. Even today I would suggest this place fro some nice snacks, to the youngsters, especially those running on a student budget.

A very good shop for having a little snack or a packed lunch. Their fried rice & chilly chicken packed lunch sell like hot cakes. The shop needs to get bigger or make a small sitting area for people. Overall very satisfactory experience every time I have been to this shop.

Bake Club opened when I was in the eighth standard. At that time, its difference with the other similar kinds of confectioneries was that the cake was made in the shop and the people customers could see it. Also they introduced some new items like kulcha, mini lunch pack (fried rice and chicken curry/paneer), apple strudel, cookies like melting moments etc. It was a delight. A relief from Sugar and Spice and Monginis. Unfortunately, like all other things in kolkata their quality worsened over years. Now it's no different with the confectioneries around it. Rather the staff have got more arrogant. It's not even that reasonable. Though the above is true, I still visit this place for the melting moments cookies. Nothing else is worth a second try there. Maybe Palmiers.

Pretty decent place. If you're tired of the same old stuff at Monginis and Sugarr n' Spice (or however they spell it), try the food here. I'm not much of a sweet-tooth, so i didn't try out their pastries and laddoos and what not, but the club sandwich was great. The chicken patty is refreshingly different.

I am really fond of this place because of the excellent cakes they bake during Christmas. I have always found them to be fresh and full of nuts and raisins. 
All throughout the year they do sell really nice confectionery. Nice tarts and various types of bread rolls. They also have lunch packs which go for 60 bucks but I haven't tried them. But don't go for the momos they have. They are usually stale and not too palatable.
P.s. I have noticed some really interesting looking cakes in their display. Waiting for someone's bday to come up! :p

Bake Club has been calming my hunger ever since. I go to this place on a regular basis. The garlic chicken kebab is my favourite and also the fish orly is good. I have ordered cakes for parties as well and they were very good. This place is usually crowded with people of all age and is very popular. When your hungry and in jadavpur, you know where to come to !!

I visited this place a few times. I liked the food and the price is decent. The food is good and I would recommend it whether is be the sugary stuff or the other snacks - but I would not stay that it's excellent for the price. There selection, however, is pretty good compared to other shops and the servings are not stingy and the items are quite filling.

Food--》Though Bake Club dont have many oulets like Monginis but its food will impress you.. They had wide variety from pastries to cakes to snacks and cold drinks, mineral water, breads etc. We ate chicken spring rolls and paneer sandwich and took a parcel of veg spring roll. Bill was under 100 bucks. Pocket friendly :)

Location--》 close to jadavpur-ranikuthi auto stand, near 8b Bus Stand 0r opposite of jadavpur monginis. Being located in a prompt location this outler is ever-busy. This outlet has wash basin and a small eating area.. quite spacious!!
Overall a great place for a pocket friendly eating.. one thing I feel that they had small variety of veg items!!

The confectionary shop is located on the Kane opposite 8B his stand , near the auto stand .  The shop has the usual bake club fare which tastes slightly different from the confectionary products available in other popular chains .  The bread based items are good and usually does not disappoint .  But the Crispy Chicken was not good at all. The chicken cutlet and fish fry are also better avoided .  The pastries are good and they have a pot shaped cake ( rosogollar handi)  which looks interesting .  Their shop has cold drinks and is a good option for a quick bite.

Firstly, a disclaimer from my side.This review is based on my experience at the Bake Club outlet at Peerless Hospitals.Since the hospital outlet is not listed on Zomato, thus posting my review here.Since the hospital does not have any decent cafeteria/canteen, this is the only go-to option.Have tried quite a few of their items on offer.This would include the chicken pattice, chicken burger,chicken sandwich,chicken lollipop,egg chicken croissant, chicken hot dog etc. Firstly the good part-the size of the items and prices are extremely pocket friendly.However most of the items lack the finesse or punch-whatever you may like to call it. Tasteless stuffing,inadequate chicken, some items not being fresh, outer coating of the lollipop being too thick and chewy for consumption, chicken pieces used being too chewy etc are the shortcomings. This is an ideal outlet for students who are on a tight budget.But for a discerning foodie this outlet fails to impress.

Any engineering student of Jadavpur University would have visited this place atleast once during their college years.

Situated near the busy 8B bus stand in the vicinity of other confectionery shops like Bake Paradise, Monginis, Kathleen and Sugarr and Spice, this shop has made up a mark in the area.
On account of their comparatively inexpensive cakes and the innovative items in their menu, Bake Club used to be our first choice when it came to celebrations for someone's birthday (read : rubbing cake on the face) in college.
Items like Chicken Garlic Kabab, Chicken Italian roll and the Fish Orly are all-time hits out here. I love their huge cream roll for the chocolate coating at one end. Coming to the cakes, the Chocolate Brownie is a bliss. The pastries are average. Overall, the items are decent enough.

The marble slab inside can comfortably seat 3-4 people, and the wash basin inside is a big plus-point. Over the last year, they have refurnished the interiors and added new items for you to try. Sadly the prices of a few have nearly doubled since 2012, but Bake Club is always a good choice for a quick snack.
3 out of 5 from me.

Apart from the sealed breads and small cakes that are available here, the other confectioneries in this joint at Jadavpur CIT Market is not worth a try. The pastries appear stale when tasted, and the patties and the burgers will hardly titillate your gustatory sensation. Though the shop is well illuminated with LED bulbs and would also strike appealing at the fight sight, but it does not, at all, live up to its promise. The prices are also a tad high when compared to other confectionery outlets in the vicinity. In a nutshell, a big disappointment.

As long as I remember the only confectionary I visited since my childhood days were Monginis & Bake Club. My dad's office being near to 8B bus stand, whenever I visited him at the office he would would give a treat to this "powerhouse" of fast food!! I wonder maybe I am one of the oldest customers who is still visiting this place!! Started as a small eatery , it has been renovated recently & now its fabulous!! Coming to their items I have tasted all their stuff & my mouth  still waters thinking of their tastes! Cheap & very much affordable with a great list of items to choose from this is  a student's paradise!!! Absolute bliss!!

This was a competitor of monginis-type snacks back in college days. It is very pocket friendly for college students and their burger is quite alright. We get to eat fine dining now but at one point fine dining was not such a lucrative option. Bake club was great for birthday treats then. I have not tried their sweet bakery items but the salty ones are alright.

The cakes are really tasty and looks mouth watering. The assortment of chicken and paneer items are all to be tried at one by one with every visit.The best place for treating your classmates for any small achievement of yours.

I was a fan of Bake Club in my school days for their interesting and often innovative items. However, they were on a slide for a while. Cut to 2014, and you'll find that Bake Club has majorly reinvented itself in the last few years. From opening a few new outlets to swanking it up at existing ones, they're giving a hard run to Monginis. I agree with the previous reviewers who said that a quick bite here is better than a tummy filling at any fast food joint.

This outlet on Jadavpur Central Road, i.e the road leading from 8B Bus Stand to Bikramgarh, is arguably the best bakery in the whole area. With a large floor space, proper lighting and colourful wall decorations, it's a fun sight in the otherwise crumbling, moulded CIT market building, on the ground floor of which it is situated. The astounding number of items on display is a welcome sight considering the fact that most other bakeries in the city have not tweaked their basic menu in quite a few years. They've rediscovered their knack for innovative new items which are spread across the price spectrum. The inclusion of a number of items such as Momos, Pakoras and Kebabs have also certainly helped the establishment. The portions of an average item is large enough. The Dessert section is better than ever with an equally large number of pastries. In short, just go have a look. :) 

Chakraborty Tip : The images for the menu provided in this page are very old, incomplete and not a reflection of the items they now provide. Keep that in mind.

I’m sure you’ll never go hungry if you have a Bake Club near your place. Kolkata boasts of many Bake Club outlets, where you find mouthwatering titbits at very reasonable rates.  A big foodie ( as I like to call myself), I most often find my way into these outlets to try some chicken spring roll, chicken garlic kebab, chicken burger or paneer kebab. Since I have a sweet tooth, I make it a point to try their chocolate truffle pastry, which is simply awesome. The speciality about these food outlets is you can drop in anytime and get your fill by spending a few bucks.

Snacks and savouries are always served fresh and crispy. The reason is simple. There are hardly any leftovers after 7 p.m. People always throng in Bake Club outlets to try some delectable kebabs or patties. Cleanliness and hygiene are two factors that are taken care of in all Bake Club outlets. Fresh savories and pastries are displayed on clean trays. 

Apart from yummy chocolate truffle pastry, chocolate special pastry, chocolate flakes and silwenya, Bake Club offers delicious eggless brownies. You can also purchase birthday cakes from any of Bake Club outlets. Serving their customers in the best possible manner is their motto, therefore each Bake Club outlet is manned by three to four people, each one busy serving a group of customers. As a result not a single customer feels neglected or unheard in the crowd. I always prefer visiting Bake Club outlets in the evening to try some delicious crispy chicken or chicken croissant or a generous slice of chocolate truffle pastry. Next time you walk past a Bake Club outlet, just spare a few moments, drop in here and try some of the best snacks and savouries.

bake club ranks somewhere between cakes and monginis going by their preparation and quality of patisseries.while availability of many of their items vary from store to store,few bestsellers are a constant see,and mostly delightful.chicken italian,chicken picaddily,mutton cutlet,chicken garlic kebab are my personal favourite.they also make decent almond and lemon tarts,creme nuts and brownies.there are few among the non veg section which look appealing but disappoint,so perspicacity dictates sticking to known ones.however the candour of their selection has been impressive over the years,even as i feel their enterprise dwindling due to new outlets of kfc and subway opening every now and then.but they will,hopefully,retain their niche of customers.

Bake club has this really small counter in the 8B area of jadavpur in the CIT market.
There is a stone counter where a few people can manage to sit.
They have a few very dramatic cakes made in the shapes of earthen pots.

The bakery items are decent and they have a large variety of tiffin cakes,brownies etc.

There is a huge variety of veg/non-veg items which can be filling.
The garlic kabab, fried momo, paneer roll,bone pakoda,chicken spring roll are a few which are really good.

Bake Club manages to stand out in spite of of being located near several other Bakery outlets in Jadavpur. I have been a regular customer of this bakery since the bakery had just opened and was extremely partial to the Chicken Sandwich that they offered . It used to be my regular after school filling before I rushed off to tuitions. Another favourite was their Chicken Khaboos roll, which is a non oily variant of the quintessential Kolkata Chicken roll with extra large chicken pieces! The Chicken Hunger taste is also worth trying. The cakes and pastries section is pretty average with regular offerings such as Rum ball and Blkack forest pastries.

This Bake Club outlet adjacent to the Indian Coffee House in Jadavpur, has been a favourite haunt for me since my schooldays when I would frequently drop in with friends for a quick bite. The place was recently revamped and made bigger. Now one can even sit on the newly installed marble slab and eat or simply keep the food on it. For me, this is the best pocket friendly bakery in that area any day.
The scrumptious mayo filled Chicken Italiano is my all time pick. Apart from that, the Chicken Burger, Kebab and Lollypops are some of the best items here. All the other veg and non-veg items are pretty decent except the crispy chicken, which I find a tad bit rubbery. Even though their cup cakes are amazingly yummy, it is better to avoid the pastries (the sponge cakes used in them are really hard). Again, the jam roll and lemon tart is better than the rest.
They also provide different kinds of bread and cookies in this outlet.
4 points to Bake Club for saving my broke and hunger stricken self and making me so happy after hours of attending tuition!

This lovely little joint had saved my life literally from starvation countless times, and I thank "Chicken Hunger Taste" for filling up my belly. The truth is, I would come here when I wanted to make sure I had something lurking inside my stomach for a considerable period of time. They used to make a mock "Pantharas" of Paneer, which was tasty. Also, the chicken garlic kebab wasnt quite bad, although the steamed momos are meh. 

I am not much of a fan of their sugary stuff, although they have a plain cake slice (probably madeira cake or named something like that ) which I sometimes eat when I want something sweet.

This bakery is one of the better ones among the confectionery chains operating in Calcutta. It stocks a good range of savoury and sweet items. The outlet near the Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand is also their main outlet, therefore, their entire range of products is usually available here.

Personal favourites include the Chicken Piccadilly and the Chicken Spring Roll. Unfortunately, they've stopped making their Apple Strudel and both the Lemon Tart and the Chocolate Tart have deteriorated in quality, therefore there aren't any pastries that I particularly like any more. Even so, this remains a good place to drop in for a snack.

There was a time when i frequented their triangular park outlet for the chicken lollipops which came at just 7 rupees per piece. This particular outlet located close to 8B bus stand serves varieties of snacks and pastries. Chicken spring roll would be my pick from the lot. The pastries are just average, nothing to write about. In all this place caters to those in mood for a light snack, not meant for a heavy meal.

মোমো খুব ভালো লাগবে। চিকেন রোলটাও ভালো খেতে। ফিশ ওরলিও খাওয়া যেতে পারে। মঞ্জিনিস বা সুগার অ্যান্ড স্পাইস -এর থেকে খাওয়ার কোয়ালিটি অনেক অনেক টেস্টি।

Visited their bagbazar outlet quite a few times. My pick always included their garlic chilly chicken. Also, chicken bone kebabs and rolls are good.
