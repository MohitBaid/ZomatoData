This is a¬†hookah parlour having some vegetarian snacks and drinks. The¬†Ambiance was average, service wasn't that quick. We tried the Brain Freezer flavoured hookah and it was too good. With that, we had the coke¬†and few snacks.
1. Crispy Chilli Babycorn
2. Mixed Sauce Pasta
And i must say they are really good in the snacks. they taste delicious better than many hyped places in Kolkata. The Pizza and sandwiches were not available when we visited
You should give it definitely if you are on a really tight budget. Then this place won't disappoint and your inner foodie will definitely be satisfied with the food

Being a Hookah place it is dim light and loud music, the ambiance is of any other hookah place just the space is a bit short. The best part here is the food (mainly snacks and drinks) they serve. It's amazing, yummy food at most affordable price.

We had the Mixed Sauce Pasta and Chilly Baby Corn both were one of the best we get in the city at such an affordable price.
So¬† whenever you are broke and have those hunger pangs, do make it a point to try them.

It's an hookah parlour with some vegetarian snacks and some drinks. Been here today to try their hookah and the visit was worthy. Located in little Russell Street in front of Chowman in the ground floor of same building were the tea factory was. Ambiance was good. Hospitality was okay. Service wasn't that quick. Staff was friendly. We tried their Brain Freezer flavored hookah and it was damn freezy, perfectly made and just amazing to have. With that I have KitKat shake which was heavenly delicious, full of flavored and tastes tasty AF. Nice place to hangout recommended.
PS - There's no Combo option and happy hour here. 
         Hookah cost ‚Çπ 300/. Snacks and drinks were
         pocket friendly.

This is a small restaurant and a hookah parlour with ordinary food and ordinary decor. The sitting capacity is small. The restaurant provide few small eat items to go with hookah. The food is ordinary and so is the decor. The combos are good and named in the name of IPL teams. The combos include hookah, pizza or bread items or noodles and mocktails.

Only issue with this place is space, the previous green apple had a better space, now its restricted to a small room. Recommended if you are nearby and much hungry.

Went there few days back, its below TCC building. Its a very small place with small chairs and tables. Low light and music. But its a nice place if you're a bit tight on budget. I tried the combo menu: 2 coke with 1 hookah and coal change, with veg fried rice and baby corn at just rs499. Its very cheap in my opinion. Best for college students like me to go and hang out. Even the food tasted good too.

If you want to control your budget but still want to have good food & hooka then you should try this place. Noodles were amazing, so was hooka, drinks were nice and bonus not so expensive. Good for those days were u just want to chill & dont want to showoff by spending much, for me its most of the days :-P

Ambiance - Okayish. The entrance is not so catchy. The seating area is small but the cafe is air-conditioned.

Music - Good.

Staff management - Disappointing.¬†

Food - Nice as compared to their prices. We ordered their grilled cheese sandwich which was good in taste and masala cold drink was ordinary.

Pocket-pinch - Reasonable.

They serve only veg items and this cafe is mostly famous for their hookahs.

Great place for some really good sheesha.Haven't had this good sheesha anywhere in India so far.We were new to the place and the guy running this understood that, so he helped us and choosing some in-house favorites.We tried the brain freezer (some concoction of probably citrusy flavor). We experimented with milk in place of water. On that sheesha were 3 heads consisting of a mix of orange and blueberry and lemon (mostly) and a bit/hint of paan somewhere thrown in.Even their plain rose, grape and melon are very very good.Long lasting flavors, coal was hardly ever required to be changed. Friendly staffNot bad at all. Another great place for a try when in Kolkata.

A nice little place near TCC, though small, is a great place to hangout. The location is good but the interiors need to be worked on. Coming to the hookah, it's really good and a special mention to the Chilly Mushroom. This place is good for both hookah and food. The prices are decent enough and a special mention to the staffs who ensure customer satisfaction at every step. The best part is, the music is played at a comfortable volume unlike most of the hookah joints where the music plays so loud that carrying out a conversation becomes painful.

I Would Never Recommend Anyone To Visit This Place.

Had recently visited this joint with an old friend of mine and to be frank was surprised by the size of it. Situated just opposite Buzz, one of my all time favorites for its taste/quantity. The place is dimly lit as it should be and the music seems to be overbearing sometimes, too loud for one to hear those on the other side of the table.  Coming to the food, it was nothing much. the food tasted mediocre. The hookah was really nice and there was no choking at all. One of the best hookahs that i have had over the few years. The staff is friendly and suggestive. Recommended only if you are going for hookah.

Well to start with, its an awesome teeny tiny place in the middle of russel street. and if you are not searching for it, you may just miss it..
Went there on a weekday for small bite during lunch time from my office..
Place is cozy, comfy, nothing great about it but still is really cool..

I found the music okayish.. 
Its more of a hookah place. people around you will be busy with their sheesha.
Food: tastes good, smells good, decently priced.
Ambiance: Proper fora place like that. don't go with colleagues.
Service: well there's a catch. its homely, but really really slow..

from my side a thumbs up to the place.. 
an advice to them: "Please work on the service time..!! hungry customer may freak out someday..!!"

Cheers.

Located in russel street,right below TCC,(next to the post office) green apple is a small place for sheesha and snacks.I went there on sunday evening (15.06.2014) with a friend coz we were craving for a good sheesha.On entering i found the place to be dimly lit and small.The seating and decor is very simple,nothing worth mentioning.We ordered for a 3 paan sheesha and it totally bowled me away!Probably one of the BEST sheeshas i have had in a while.I also ordered for a chocolate shake which was pretty good(no art there) and my friend ordered for a masala tea.The service was good,little slow but the staff was really warm.The asked if everything was okay.A good part of this experience was that they were present when we needed to order and they gave us ample space to chit chat and didnt barge in to ask if we want to order more.
Service is a definite plus and so is the sheesha!I am yet to try the food here.Goodluck team green apple ÔÅä

I adore some dishes but not all. Cajun chicken and Chicken Cheese balls are good here. Cheese garlic Bread is good to taste. Ambience is average and food quality is mediocre. 

Prices are affordable and staffs are good too. 

I would rate 3.0 for GREEN APPLE.

well after reviewing the feedbacks posted here i was hoping for something good but am disappointed.there is nothing good about this place other than the hookahs.although they are pretty average.most of the foods which have deserved mention in other posts as the chicken cheese balls,the kebab sticks are "ready to fry" frozen food items available in any supermarket/departmental store.they just fry and serve them.the cajun chicken was good,so was the crispy chilli babycorn.the shakes deserve special mention especially the kit kat shake.

the lows :  the service is horrible.they made us wait for 1 hour to dish out the first order on all 3 occasions we visited.the staff are very slow,mostly not interested in whatever you are asking for.not even interested to take orders.
basically a place preferred by school'/college goers to kill time,reluctantly taking a puff or two over their fav hookah

Going through Little Russel Street area, Kind of felt the need to have some tea. Found the place, Green Apple. From the outside, it looks to be a cafe. But as you enter, through those shady doors (through which none could see inside), there actually runs a complete hookah bar! It has the area of a garage, and ambience could not be worse. I'm supposed to understand that it's a two level thing- ground floor is a common area and upper level (I wouldn't call it first floor, there's hardly a couple of stairs) is meant for hookah loving people, with all "18+ only", "beware" and other nonsenses written on it's door. But to my surprise, it had lesser number of people than the number below. Apparently, a cricket match between India and Pakistan is a reason good enough for non-hookah lovers (like me; if there was ever a rally against hookah consumption, I'd lead it) to enjoy passive smoking here. (Because the only television here is at the lower level). By the time I had cleared the smoke with my hands and sat down, i felt as if I had entered a hippie colony full of people doing coke and marijuana. And after so much of trouble (and risks of lung cancer), they proudly announce that they're out of tea. So, I hastily take my bag and walk out.


I'm probably writing this in too much of heat; but all I ask is be true. If your running a (hopefully legal) hookah joint, at least mention it somewhere on your door, so that customers like myself are saved the embarrassment. You'll definitely get your smoking customers anyway.

Don't know about the food, so won't comment.

Heads up: If you wanna eat something, head over to Saima or Buzz just a step away. Trust me, it's a better deal.

Green Apple.. Located in Russel Street in The Kenilworth Lane just before the Jyoti Vihar Crossing.. It is a Cafe divided into two levels.. The steep fleet of stairs leads to the Hookah area.. The ambiance is very okayish and could have been much better. Coming to the food.. We ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn which was good.. Cheese Corn Balls were okay and Schezwan Rice was above average.. The hookah - Vanilla Pan Salsa was good enough. This place is very pocket friendly - thumbs up for that. Parking is a huge problem. Overall its an above average place which good for students.
Two and half stars from me.

The two best my Fav item is cajun Chicken and Russian Sandwich- best of ever had. Apart from that I had order Chilli Milli and Moussaka, both are unique and taste good. Finally ordered Paneer Footlong and Kit kat Shake.. To end my perfect food fiesta. If you are food lover and looking for cafe with a good food, ambience and service, then this is place for you and for group, it is perfect adda point with smoke and unique food. They also provide the place for Birthday Party also..Must try place..Thanks to Green apple for your food and service..TM
