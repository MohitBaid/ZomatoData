We were in gariahat for some purpose and visited this sweet shop. It is located in dover lane.

Place was clean and hygienic.  Place is small. Limited sweet items were available. Sweets were fresh and delicious. Specially taalsash was very good. Pocket pinch was very reasonable.

This sweet confectionary is located at Gariahat near Dover Lane.
Service is nice.
I have tasted their sondesh, rosogolla & singaara. All were fresh and nice but nothing special.
Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A small sweet ( mishti) shop but with quite a variety....The usual Sandesh, rosgollas,etc. They also have singara and kachori. Not bad, reasonably priced but nothing great either. It's like a local, " para" go to shop. People come and have sweets standing here or take a packet home to have later.

This sweetmeat shop is my aunt's favourite and every time she comes to my home is with one huge pack of sandesh from this shop. I have got the opportunity to taste their various kinds of sandesh. All of them were really good. But the best ones are nolen gur er sandesh . Yummy

This place serves pretty good sweets. Don't know if they are the branch of the much revered Hazra one. Love their kachoris. Among the sweet spread, I like their chhenar jilipis and rossogolla. As it is located very near to my school, I used to have my afterschool tiffin whenever I was low on the pocket. Recommended.

A decent Bengali sweet shop located at Gariahat. It is near the Gariahat PS near Dover Lane.

I had taken some Rosogolla and singara as a part of quick snacks as a take away to enjoy evening Adda at friend's place nearby. Both the items were fresh and tasted nice too. Liked it. Wide range of sweet products are available in their offerings which looks attractive.

Located at the entry of Dover's lane, been here only once. It is a quaint little shop with a decent variety of sweets. I was passing by the area and was kind of hungry. Tried their Kochuri and Cholar Daal, which was pretty good. The Cholar Daal was sweetish as it should have been. Did not try any sweets as such. Staffs were humble and prompt in their service.
