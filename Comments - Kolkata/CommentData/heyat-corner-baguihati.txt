If uou are a localite & wanna grab a roll/chowmien/mughlai, then heyat is good option in raghunathpur & jyangra. I loved paneer roll here. Being a takeaway counter(no seating facility) its quiet hygienic. Service good & fast. Just imagine when you tell ur frnds that, come let me giv u treat in Hyatt oops Heyat ;)
