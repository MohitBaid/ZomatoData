I GOT SICK FROM THEIR PIPING HOT DOSA. NOT. NOT. NO.  I ADVISE OTHERS TO BEWARE OF THEIR FOOD AND OF THE RUDE BEHAVIOUR BY THE YOUNG MAN HEADING THE ORDER COUNTER.

They used to make some amazing and cheap mutton rolls a few years ago, but now they have increased the cost.
Momos and rolls are decent. Nothing fancy.
Not much of a sitting area per say.
But if you're standing there waiting for a bus or auto and getting hunger pangs, this is an okayish option.

A small food joint behind nagerbazar bus terminal. Chicken soup of this hotel is awesome. Several times I had chowmin, rice and biriyani. Price is reasonable and quantity is sufficient.

I had placed an order for dinner today from this place. The order was for home delivery and was placed at 9.30 pm. Even after 1 hour the order didn't reach me so I enquired at the restaurant only to find that they were closing and so they cancelled my order. I mean how dare they just cancel a customer's order without any notice? And that too they are telling me after an hour. I wish I could rate this place minus five stars. Pathetic.

This place lists many preparations in it's menu..South Indian, tandoor, chinese etc but none tastes good. The Chinese is nothing above average, tandoor is so so.. but the South Indian dishes are the worst. They served me the worst Dosa I've ever had. It's so bad that now whenever anyone suggests to have dosa from wherever maybe.. the Gurudev experience pops into my head and I decline the proposal.
The only thing good about this place is that the price is very cheap. When one's hungry and have little money with him/her then this place can help... But I would strongly suggest the readers of this review to avoid the Dosa of that place if possible.

Ordered Fish pakora and Fish Fry through Swiggy. The Pakora was surprisingly good but the fish fry was awful and had very scanty fish and was stale.

Old fast food centre at Nager bazar before the big brands came in. They were closed for about an year or more. Someone else took over and opened with new look. Recently I took Tadka(daal fry) from here for home. Although I do not like Tadka, I felt It was really testy. They have Chicken 65 as their speciality as well.

Ordered home delivery for the first time from this restaurant through swiggy. The food quality was quite good at the given price range and the quantity too is appreciable.

Food I ordered included:
° Chicken Fried Rice
- the rice was not at all oily which is the case for most road side stalls and it had a generous amount of chicken pieces in it at a price of 110 INR.

° Chicken 65
- it is a dry chicken preparation with capsium, onion and chillies with 16 pieces of boneless chicken at 160 INR.

Had a great experience of ordering from here for the first time.
Looking forward to trying other dishes!

UPDATE : On my second order from this place I opted for 
》 Chicken Mughlai Paratha
》 Chicken Gravy Noodles

I was not disappointed either. The food quality was really good again. A must try place for everyone who wants to enjoy quality food at dirt cheap pricing.

If you want to feed the dogs of your locality, this so-called Restaurant is the perfect place to order from. :)  They would very happily wag their tails and chew on the food offered. 

Thank you.

Dont know why this place is rated so low! Maybe the reviews are based on the outward appearance of the restaurant..but considering the quality of food it is one of the best in business.
This is one of the busiest of fast food joints in Nagerbazar. Located near 202 bus stand, the place is crawled with customers during evening. Chicken and mutton moghlais are their speciality but they also provide good indianized version of chinese foods lyk fried rice,chicken 65,mixed chowmin ,etc. The only thumbs down is their seating capacity,but it never bothered me as i take parcels at my home from this place... :)
So, if u r looking to have good food without a pinch in ur pocket u cant give this place a miss.

I ordered through zomato and got my parcel.  I ordered mixed gravy chow and chicken 65.
The food was good in taste and the chicken 65 was in huge quantity specially when you compare with the price tag. The quantity of noodles was good as well.

Nice and decent place. Serves good food. Price is also quite. One of the oldest food joints in Nagerbazar. Used to come here during my school days when the area was not that developed. The food quality has not changed. I love coming back to this place.

This is a very tiny restaurant which is behind Nagerbazar bus stand and I use to take away my food from here. This place is best known for its mutton roll. But few items of it is just superb. I personally recommend you to have its momo, rolls, chicken pokora, mixed fried rice chili chicken and chicken 65. The quantity is very high in rice items and noodles. 450 for 2 luch.

This is rather a fast-food center serving rolls and  cold drinks. The service is okayish. But, don't ever think of having your food here. The ambience is aweful. But, the food is good. Take away us a pretty good option. One should try chicken 65 and fried rice.

This eatery is one of the oldest in the Nagerbazaar area.It's located near the 202-221 bus stand and it serves a wide range of foods ranging from south Indian to Mughlais to momos to rolls and many more . After a new get over their food tastes better than before. I love their chicken mughlai. Their South Indian dishes are quite decent .But I'm not a big fan of their momos,I feel they need to make their momos a little more tastier. I frequently take away their chicken dishes which are quite nice and I must say this place is quite under rated.

Keeping up with its heritage this restraunt makes some of the best rolls and snacks in the Nagerbazar vicinity. Take a bite out of the chicken 65 and schezwan chicken and you won't be forgetting this place anytime soon. Amazing food. Great value. Fast takeaway. Thank you Gurudev !

The name might not be interesting,but believe me it is one of the oldest restaurant in Nager Bazar & it's the only restaurant where you will find cucumber in the roll!! They have recently added Biryani to their menu,you can also try the chicken 65 :)

Seriously! Am I the first to do the honours! Its an institution in nagerbazar, known for the superb rolls that it dishes out. Its around the corner from the bus stand and therefore easilt approachable. Today, since we were passing by that area decided to pop in for a bite, to our surprise the little roll shop has been converted into a decent and clean sit down joint serving quite a few things. We saw  ppl lapping up south indian fare, so we ordered a plate of idli n vada, quite decent must say! The Vada was soft and yummy! We packed away a plate of chicken chowmein and chilli chicken, and they were the yummiest! I saw some guys having rumali roti and chicken 65... thats going to be my next order for sure! :)
