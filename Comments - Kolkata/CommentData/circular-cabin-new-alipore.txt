This outlet is located just opposite new alipore petrol pump. Quite an old hotel, it doesn't have any kind of decorative and cozy interiors. It is a simple and medium sized restaurant with a basic and shabby set up(nothing luxurious). They offer plain and basic Bengali cuisine to cater the daily needs like steamed rice, daal, vegetable curries, different fish curry, chicken/mutton curry etc; it only operates during the afternoon and serves ideal lunch thalis for the local workers and commuters based in this area. It stays closed during the evening. I have taken food from this joint a couple of times for lunch during some uncalled situations and my expectation was sufficiently fulfilled. This outlet provides simple home-like Bengali food of decent quality and in reasonable price without any fuss.
