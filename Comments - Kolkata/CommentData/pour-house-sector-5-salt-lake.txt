Nice place and great DJ music and dance floor. Price is on the higher side for drinks and food. Service quality is not up to the mark. The place is quite spacious.

Located near sdf building, Salt Lake, this is yet another booze joint in the it hub of Kolkata. Loud music, dance floor, high price and special discounts for women makes it a lady friendly place. Music is mostly dj based and does not have the old school rock charm that Opium brings in. It is a pretty much pricey bar and food also, by no stretch of imagination, is within the reasonable limits. Food is good though, they have a lot of saucy fried options, which are pretty good.

However, in the morning, they arrange buffets and they come at a price much less than the legendary Bar B Q nation. It is definitely good. They gave 6 non-veg starters and 4 veg starters along with around 5-6 main course options. The cuisine varied from continental to Indian to Chinese and was pretty good although service wise they were a bit slow, and needed to be asked for the assistance every now and then. Overall, the morning buffet, I would say, was a good value for money option and was better than the evening experience.

Visited this place a few days back with my friends. I must say its a huge place, great decor, a lovely outside seating area, nice food and great drinks. We went there for buffet and honestly i loved it. It was quiet reasonable and the food was great. The starter was very different which we are used to in buffets and the main cource was good too.

This place is a bit expensive but it is worth it. You can have a couple of drinks over munchies and let your hair down at the neon dance floor where all your white clothes shine blue temporarily. And my female friends got lucky as it was ladies night and tequila shots were on the house for the ladies.

Visited the place on New Year's, on the 1st floor of Meghatherm Tower. You can also look for the Pantaloons store to locate this place. The entirety of the first floor belongs to them and the entrance was decked up prettily. 

However, a constant foul smell made it difficult to stand there, which was a huge turn off for us. The interior didn't have such repellent smell, and we got ourselves those high tables to start our drinking expedition. Got going with the Black Dog Centenary and a Draught Beer. Their collection of Scotch and Whiskey is appreciable. Up next was the Mojito and Teachers 50. The former was light, but left a lasting effect. 

They have shisha available as well, but the place was too dim and a little swamped for such a happening place.

Thank you Pour House for an amazing new year's eve. Came there with my cousins. The starters were delicious, especially the non-veg ones and the corn cheese ball. The ambiance was good. The DJ was pretty good too. The songs he played after 10pm were the best. All in all, my year end was amazing because of you guys.

Visited on Christmas evening. 

Ambience :  A ittle clumsy. 

Service : prompt. 

Smoking zone : perfect! Absolutely awesome. 

Food : Begining with the chicken starter, it was good enough in taste,though there was nothing surprising in it. 
Chicken was tender,vegetables were perfectly boiled and the stuffing was also pretty well.
In the main course i ordered mutton rogan josh,which was served by daal makhni, peas pulao and onion salad.
This  dish was worth the pay,i tell you. One must try it. The gravy was delicious.   
I also tried liquid cocaine which was quite effective üòÖ,along with kingfisher ultra . 

Overall had a good experience there.

P.S. - overpriced foodüò•

I don't know how to begin this review. If you are single male ( Do find a women) and if your wife or girlfriend wants you enjoy with friends do bring them or you can hire one just like Uber to get into the pub.

The concept of stags is still hard to gulp. Men are being referred as lion or lone wolf , bull and even pig. Why stag ?? Does it mean that this animal is luckless with women.

Stag entry is not allowed and pay cover of 2000 INR each apart from bill for being male ( we were five). ??? So you mean being male is sin and you have to carry a women if it's very unsafe to roam around with one late night.Change the rules or your name. "Pour House not for stags" Never came in so can't actually comments what's inside.

Terrible experience at Pour House on Christmas Eve. The speakers were placed right above our heads and we almost died from  the blasting music. After paying 6k as cover charges we were told that half of the things on the menu weren't available. Would request you'll to ask and then pay. The only thing that stood out was the food. Not going back for sure.

This is one of the coolest place to hangover with friends..The ambience will definitely help you to relax and forget all the stresses.. We went there sometimes back & we opted for weekday lunch buffet (non veg)..Quite affordable and foods were also great.. They offered Blue Lagoon as complimentary mocktail..There were around 5-6 types of starters which were really tasty  (specially chicken tikka kabab and chilli fish)..Mains were also good.. But one thing, which we didn't like, was that they couldn't serve us ice cream, and they said that there was a party previous night and hence it was out of stock.. Though for that they considered some amount from the bill..Leaving that one thing everything was perfect.. We must visit again soon..

Pour House, Sector 5, Salt Lake. It's a cafe. I Have always been there before the night hours. The place is cool and silent. Service is top notch. Food tastes amazing. Not an alcoholic person so can't say about alcohol but the smoke or the sisha is available at affordable price. Must have Panner Tikka and Thin Crust Pizza. Best memory when we went there and when the bill came, we only had to pay 5% GST üôà

On my visit to Kolkata, I got a chance to visit this place. It was very spacious and the ambience was fine but the food unfortunately was overpriced and the taste was average. We ordered the non-veg platter and my friend went for the buffet. The platter was good but we were really disappointed with the buffet, the food was not at all good, it was cold and some of them were bland. They really need to up their game with franchise like BARBEQUE NATION around. It was a real disappointment for us.

Pour House is located at the 1st floor of Pantaloons in Sec 5 area.

Entire place was spacious and big. Ambiance was nice. Seating arrangements were done perfectly.

We wanna try their set menu but when we try to asked our attender that what comes in the menu and he just went dark and he couldn't tell us actually what comes in the buffet menu.

From drinks we had orange mojito and Watermelon mojito. Both were good

Also We tried Chicken cheese kebab from their kebab festival menu card and it was good. Later we tried non veg kebab platter and that was a huge disappointment to us. Mutton Kebabs were cold and like it was made before that day. 

So It was not expected from pour house.

Have been to this place couple of time for lunch. Food is good out here. This time went for a buffet lunch. It wasn't impressive as the service was veey slow. We had to literally ask 4-5times for another plate of starter and babycorn which was a part of the starters list was not even served even after asking thrice. Taste of the starters was good specially the chilly fish was yummy. But the main course was not good at all. The biryani,noodles,etc were not tasty at all. The dessert included brownie whichbsaves my mood. A good place to party have a la carte but not buffet unless they improve the service and main course.

Location-2nd floor in the same building where we found pantaloon in sector5 salt lake.INTERIOR-bar come RESTAURENT,totally follow this.staff-co operative.but little bit moody.food quality-we go for buffet.but they are specialist in starters.they serve you 6 non veg and 4 veg item with a delicious pizza.all items are equally upto the mark.but when we go for main course,it gives you disappointment,lack of varieties in main course.just 4 to 5 items,not upto the mark like starters.then buffet is also not upto the mark.only 3 items.but taste is good.i think they should increase the variety of their ice cream,only vanilla flavour ice cream.OVERALL,GOOD PLACE BUT REALLY NOT RECOMMEND.

Some hooligans were troubling us throughout the night and the waiters / security personnel did not do anything about it, instead, they were listening to the guy who was complaining about us not being "responsive to their desires". It was an unsafe experience for us and I do not recommend this place for a girls night out. This is the perfect example of stereotyping girls according to what they wear and what they do in India .

Some hooligans were troubling us throughout the night and the waiters / security personnel did not do anything about it, instead, they were listening to the guy who was complaining about us not being "responsive to their desires". It was an unsafe experience for us and I do not recommend this place for a girls night out. This is the perfect example of stereotyping girls according to what they wear and what they do in India .

A happening place in sector. Crowd is good, Sheesha is average, DJ could do a better job. Food is average.
Have also tried their Lunch buffet, in case you have a larger crowd for lunch, better tell them in advance. We came across such a situation when it seemed that they were not expecting 22 people together for lunch. 
P.S - Very limited options are available for buffet.

Awesomeness in everything. Food is good. Drinks are good. Good selection of Hookah. If you want to enjoy good sports or just dance the night out, this is the place. Watch out for Saturdays when it is open till 2 am. The DJ is awesome and so is the crowd. Yes they allow stag entry on Saturdays (which is awesome as we faced issue at Grid).

It was a saturday night and we were in a mood to grab quick bites in a happening place and this one attracted us as it had some Halloween party going on that day. We found the ambience catching saturday night mood completely. We ordered for beer and cocktail with some snacks and we were satisfied with every bit of it. Other than good food and ambience the polite staff also grabbed our attention. -1 is for the price and the choice of music dj had.

Must visit place in weekend time.
Pros :-
1. I literally tasted the best pasta ever , courtesy -Pour House
2. Nice interior and decor and lighting
3. Selfie zone for selfie lovers. üòÇ
4. I tried the crispy chilly babycorn and lemon coriander along with Draught beer. All were pretty good.

Cons:-
1. Price bit on a high side. Although u can find some coupon in Nearbuy/Lil app , as i did. üòâ
2. Could add some more veg food items.
3. The service is bit on a slower side.
Overall must visit atleast once especially for their Yumm Pasta, which you will never forget. !üòÉ

The restaurant is located at the first floor of pantaloons, sector v near RDB cinemas. The place is known for pouring wild cocktails and beauty of its taste of food. I have always been there in a large group for lunch buffet but they were really quick in service. The starters and pizza just taste yumm, infact all the items in the menu is just amazing and is a treat for your tastebuds , good music and if ever you have a surprise to plan then do order a cake from here it's beautiful and delicious too...keep up the good work guys and keep pouring more and more

Suffocating and price is too much high. Though the food quality is average ;Quantity, they serves , is just horrible. Hookah price is also high despite there is nothing special in it. Don't know who gives idea for the placement of their sound boxes??? & their choice and collection of music is also very pathetic. Service is poor. One plus point is there is a open space for smoking where at least you can breathe.

Worst ever experience at a restaurant in my life. 
We, a group of 6 went on Shasthi night. 
The guy at the entry initially stopped us because one of my male friend was wearing ethnic(note it was shasthi). Then when we started arguing he told we have to give a coverage charge of 1000 per male. 
It was the most disgusting experience ever. Never coming back ever.

I believe in scope of "bettering the best" hence a .5 less. Had heard from a couple of friends its a good place to be so upon meeting a couple of friends from school decided to hit the rock here. Dimly lit interesting set up for sure. Loved the place at the instance we entered. Greeted with a smile by Sudhir who waited upon us for the evening from arranging our table till the time we left accompanied by the 80's melodies with cocktails beer and single malts along side smashing food to go.....i must say it was good to be there and then. Special mention the Shisha.....it was smooth cool and not choking lasted for bout an hour without a coal change bursted flavour till the very end. Well done on the ambience however if you wanna flaunt ur legs to dance this isnt the place to be.
Its all about slow sips clouds of smoke and chatter clatter with pals.

This place is situated in the Sec V area Saltlake in the floor just above the Pantaloons. This is a lounge cum bar with dance floor. In a post Durga Pujo depressive afternoon we visited this place to enjoy their lunch buffet. They serve the starters on table with veg Manchou soup and one complimentary cooler e.g Blue lagoon. In starter we had dry chilly chicken, chicken wings, chicken tikka kebab, fish finger and chicken nuggets. We also tried their veg pizza-thin crust cheesy pizza. The starters were tasty but best was the fish finger. In mains there were Nun, veg biryani, veg noodles with schezwan fish, chilly chicken, kadai chicken, mutton rogan josh and salads. Soft butter nun with tender mutton pieces were the best of all. The mutton pieces almost melted in mouth. In desert there was Chocolate brownie with ice cream and mishti doi. There were not thousands of items but the dishes were decent and we enjoyed.Lastly the best part is the price- 579 INR inclusive of GST per head, so really pocket friendly.

The food was not at all good. The service was so poor and still we were charged service charge. Even that's not the main problem. When you charge so much on an item and it isn't even worth eating then there is a problem. The food was one of the worst foods I have ever tasted. I guess they are only running  business on the basis of brand name and not the quality of food. According to my point of view, you may charge whatever you want for the food but it should be tasty.

Visited this place a few weeks back. We were looking for some nice place to hangout for the night and we ended up here.

Location & Ambiance: Located just above "Pantaloons" 1st floor near RDB cinema. The place was sufficiently crowded for a Saturday night. We heard some good music as we entered the place. The place was dimly lit which was perfect for the atmosphere. Nothing special as such.¬†

Staff & Services: No doubt! Staff was courteous. They were responding well and had given us good suggestion. Though every one of them were in a hurry and running around the place.¬† Services were good and quick.¬†

Food & Drinks: We didn't had much to eat. We ordered Panner Tikka which was awesome. Had a few Drinks and hukka and danced.¬†

Value for money: This place is of moderate range. I found prices satisfactory compared to what we have in other popular bar and pub. It will cost you around 2000 for two with normal drinks and food.¬†

Verdict: Well, I liked this place. Although, the crowd was not as great as it should be. I found rather older people in the pub than from my age. The liked their services. We didn't get the seat @12:00 to sit because of the crowd. But it was okie because we enjoyed our time. I suggest you to go to this place and have a great time.

Had a bad experience. I went there in durga puja 2k17. Believe me guys i am giving the points only fir the ambience. Ambience is good but the price is not worth enough. Too much price without service. On top of that they add service charges with asking to you and also bills gst on that service charge also. matlab Had hai kamine pan ki yaar. don't go. just waste of your money.

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. So again we went to this new place when I was in Kolkata earlier and I must add sector 5 has some really good places.

Ambiance is dark with loud music so it's good if you want to hang out with friends over a couple of drinks, not ideal for a date as you can't hold up a conversation.

What we had-
‚àÜ Crispy chili babycorn- crispy, light and full of flavour, this was basically our chakna
‚àÜ 6 bottles of pint- Around rs-1400 there was some offer going on as far as I remember we had Budweiser and they get all the bottles together without any ice bucket so I was like how will my next bottle be chill so they said they'll replace with another one n this was how they keep a count so it was a little unusual for me but as far as the method works who are we to judge.
Didn't eat much just enjoyed the music over a couple of drinks and tried talking little which was different as the music is too loud. 
Will I come back? Probably not but the experience was good so Il recommend this place as a one time thing if you are in the neighborhood. 
Photos unavailable sorry guys.

Perfect ambience. Great music. More than enough space. Great quality cocktails and food. Perfect for groups. A bit pricey though. Also the unavailability of many brands of beers, even the most common ones, was a bit disappointing. But the aura of the space totally made our night. Would visit again for sure and definitely with a larger group.

My first visit to the place on 29th night, "Morning shows the day". We gave cover charge of 2.5k for a couple.
You will need to train the staffs on the basics of customer handling/support skills.
Incidents to mention:
On the bar counter ( after 25 mins of standing) the support staffs response while asking for availability of the liquors was like " this is what we have if you want to take it,go for it or else don't waste our time"
Then since we were not able to find anyone to speak to, we came out at the entrance and told the person who was collecting the entry fee that please refund the money or please call the manager, his response " I can't go and search for him you go and look for him"
His next comment " I know you guys went to 10 Downing Street and then came here since the prices were high there"
It's not his look out where we went or not and secondly I wanted to see this place and that's the only reason we went there because I live in Bangalore so I was curious to check out this place.
Whenever I come to Kolkata we mostly spent time in 10D and also was there on 28th night so another reason to go for Pour House ( definitely my first and last visit).
Please train the person at the gate he is not doing favor to the customers by letting us in, he is doing his job and no right to speak to the customer in that manner. We just consumed whatever we paid for cover ( only that much) and left the place and went to some other place and then had food and all.
I really now found the difference between 10D and Pour house which my friend told me before entering the place. No matter how much you are stressed out you can't misbehave with the customer. I m not sure if there is one in Bangalore but honestly never count on this place again on my hoping list.

One of the best high profile pubs in the Sector 5 area I have come across. The price tags of the items are on the higher side. So expect a pocket burn in case you decide on a visit. But food quality is awesome although quantity could have been better. The ambience and vibe is very much up to the mark. Quite spacious and exciting. Waiting and service is also quite appreciable. Overall a very good option for a friends hangout once in a while.

They are charging 2000-2500 per person for entry to the pub. Now this ia totally unacceptable. Looting during the festive season!! On normal days one rate and on festive season 5x rate !! Really disappointed in them! Will never suggest this place for office parties ever!!

Visited for the first time yesterday for team lunch,had made a prior booking due to the rush. And I am glad that I finally did. My expectations were at peak and this I tell you did not fail. The ambience is just wow!! The set up is excellent. Farid the floor manager was friendly and his service is really appreciable. The starters were just unending and the main course was too good.
As per the food the price for buffet was just 579 inclusive of taxes. Really happy to have visited. :)

The most amazing thing is the ambience.Its very soothing with low light dinning.We went there for lunch buffet and each and every dish was nice.The starters require a special mention here, there were about 10 starters and all of them were too good.
Main course was also tasty with many options.
The desserts included only brownie, vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun, each of dem was good but 1 or 2 more desserts if added then this place will be a great place for a pocket friendly buffet.

I went to this pub for the sheer hype that has been created, but I am totally disappointed with the overall experience I witnessed there. We went on a Saturday so I expected to get a real flavor of the place but once we enter the lounge we were made to sit at a table which was full of light and so I requested the waiter to dim the light a bit or turn off the light in that section. He refused to do so and further argued that the light will remain on till the DJ starts the music. After getting disgusted by his words we got shifted to another table. We actually wanted to get serviced by another  waiter but the sadly the same waiter came to that table and once we asked about the happy hour offer, without informing us about the offer, he replied in an aggressive way that '10 mins for happy hour so give the order now'. Then we called another waiter and gave @our order. We ordered Mac n cheese pasta, tandori alu  and Margherita pizza. The pizza and the pasta was decent but I felt the alu too spicy. I was expecting a wow experience from this place but the behavior of the service personnel made my experience a forgettable one.

Came across it when we few friends were looking for a better hangout option in Salt Lake. Setup & ambiance is promising with good seating capacity.
 Sheesha and cocktails were good but the food we tried was just average. Looking at overall quality and quantity of food, I think they need to improve a bit on that front to deliver the money's worth. The quantity is very less. Overall, a fine place to have those hangout evenings.

Pour House is most happening place in sector V, we reached out this place and the crowd and staff are very cordial , Tabish Alam is the best person to have a conversation with , he make sure that you enjoy , as well as he take great care of people, I liked this place a lot but nowadays the problem is they dont filter the crowd anymore and the crowd these day make me less interested in hitting this place.
If you like filtered crowd this is not your place for weekend¬†
rest the food & drinks are thumbs up

This name now need no introduction. Situated at the heart of sector 5. This joint is basically known for its electrifying atmosphere, food and drink. But this review is totally based on the food and drinks we tasted here. We have visited it in day time in weekdays. And it just remind me of the fact.. some things looks good in its own conventional way. So, no loud music, no electrifying atmosphere like the evening.

Location:
____________
I think this is not required to mention even. But those who yet to go, this is just beside the RDB cinema hall, upper floor of sector 5 pantaloons.

Atmosphere & Decoration:
_____________________________

Decoration is just appropriate for a pub. They have d bar counter and hookha is also available there.

It will be injustice to mention about the atmosphere, as we visited in day time.
It was calm, soothing, only our group was presented there at that time. So, it is just the opposite vibes what you can ask in pour house. üòÅ

Food & Beverages:
_____________________

¬© starters:
_____________
‚úì Prawn Salt and Papper : it was okay type. Prawn could have been more soft and Juicy.
‚úì Junglee Masale Ka Murg Tikka : it was nice. Chicken was well cooked and juicy. But nothing extraordinary in taste.

¬© Main Courses:
__________________

They offer very little types of main courses. I would say it is better to skip the main courses if you visit there.

‚úì Chicken Lababdar Platter : this offer laccha paratha , with two pieces of chicken Lababdar and tarka Dal. Chicken was good. But I found the Dal was more tastey. Overall the dish was nice, normal what you eat other places also.

¬© Beverages:
_______________

‚úì Danzon Martini : Martini with Kahl√∫a. If you like coffee based cocktail you will love this one. It tastes very nice, though felt the dilute portion could be less.

‚úì Watermelon Margarita : very very nice. If you want cokctail on milder side. This is just appropriate.

‚úì LIIT - long island iced tea tastes nice. But yes nothing superb in this.

¬© Dessert:
______________

They have very limited dessert option. We choosed their special jar.

‚úì Special Jar : basically its a brownie with ice cream , bit a touch of Monte Carlo also, presented in a glass.
So, we expected a jar by the name, but the presentation disappointed us. But tasted nice.

Overall an okay experience. Food and beverages are good. But there is nothing extraordinary to clap for.

It cost 3804 for 3 people. Price is on very very higher side compare to the tastes of food.

Yeah, you can try it once though, specially in evening. :)

And till my next review happy fooding :)

Pour House, at the heart of the Sector 5 just above the Pantaloons, has a life of its own when you enter the place from service to decor it was all great. Pretty lights all around, Big giant  screening in the corner for sports lovers and upbeat music. This place is cosy for couples and for Hookah lovers. This place is quite spacious as it has a Dance Floor, hookah zone, restaurant, smoking area and a dedicated Bar section. The staffs were very hospitable and courteous.
 
What I ordered ...!!!
Non- veg platter Jungli Masala Ka Murg Tikka
Hot Garlic Spaghetti
Mongolian Noodle with chicken
Bira Blonde
Sangria- Tropical White and Tropical Red.

The dish was tasteful and succulent .

Meal for two :- 1500 - 2000 approx (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, market rates )

Food Quality :-  4.5/5

The starters had soup, 6 non veg and 4 veg starters with a complimentary starter.The drumsticks,chilli ckicken,fish fry and Tikka were very well cooked.The other two were a bit bland but overall was great.The main course was limited and nothing much to talk about but the starters can fill you up well.The dessert had gulab jamun,ice cream and brownie.Overall a good experience and always the music is good at Pour House.Do go for the nightlife as it is more famous

First of all I had an impression on my mind that this place is more kind of disc or something. But guys most part of it comprises of dining place unlike places like BSE. I went on Saturday night but the crowd was a great disappointment to the distance I travelled for the place.

The only good thing that happened with me was I got my mobile phone back after I misplaced it inside the bar. A member of the management team was honest and responsible enough to keep it in safe custody.

This place is located just adjacent to RDB Cinemas in Sector 5, 1st floor of Pantaloons. This place is quite big with long chairs, normal chairs, sofas, live bar counter in short whatever you are looking for a bar.

Best place to hang out with friends in a group or that special someone and grab a drink or two. If you are catching up with your friend and all you intend to do is talk, I wont recommend this place as the music is bit on the louder side.¬†

Perfectly lit floor. There a few LCDs where you can watch the match and also the same is projected on the wall so if you want to catch a match with your friends along with drink, this is your place to be.¬†

They also serve hookah.

I chose this place on a fine holiday, the 15th of August 2017. So, as expected, ths place was not crowded because of DRY DAY. We took a table and started scrolling our fingers through the delicacies that the place was offering. We ordered a Mixed Sauce Pasta, a pizza which had 3 toppings ( unable to recall the name) and crispy chilli babycorn along with a watermelon mojito, a regular lime soda and an italian smooch (which again is a mocktail with ginger syrup as the hero in the drink)
I loved the pizza since it was nice and crisp. The babycorn was made just as we asked for, however, I would chose to not comment about the pasta as we ate it after a long time.
The ambience and the decor of the place was suited to what it is promoting itself as.
However, the shisha that we ordered was not upto the mark.
Hope to have a better experince if I decide to give this place a second visit.

A great place to party but if you want to meet a friend to catch up, the music is a little loud for that. ;)
We went on Sunday so the place was packed with jolly people who knew how to have a good time.
The drinks are a little expensive with few offers and lesser choices.  The music and dance floor is amazing. You will be forced to shake a leg whether you can dance or not. Try Grilled Chhicken Pizza if you are looking for something light.

Excellent ambience with pretty cool music. I would rate the music played as 5/5 as I grew up listening to Bollywood songs during the '90s . The inside is quite spacious and would give you enough freedom to shake your leg . The smoking zone is a highlight as it's in the open and also has got seating arrangements. The only con I noticed is you shall have to order food to go with your drink as they would serve any complimentary munch. But nevertheless it's a good place to hang out with your friends over the weekends.

Price : yes its a bit costly ,atleast on a saturday night they do not have any offer

Food : we ordered a lot of food and all were tasty

Stuff : very quick and approachable,we wanted to change our table and they prompty did it ,even though there was a huge crowd but we always got someone around for placing the order

Music: dj sandeep is one of the best.
The song selection,music mixing were too good
He has picked the best songs from 90's till date and the best part was "it was bollywood night"
You guys r getting an extra star for that

Manager : that bear suits you ;)

1* rating less coz its tooooooo costly
Music is toooooo loud and doesnt allow you to talk to  the one next to you , may be you can keep the volume a bit low in one section where people who wants to talk with eachother can seat

So, being a regular sector 5 IT employee and an ardent GOT follower, we have decided to visit Pour House last Sunday to envisage a GOT themed party as they say first of it‚Äôs kind (read name) and the pun is completely intended. Pretty disappointed to start with as my friend already booked a table in the morning for two of us which they ensured shall be reserved, but reaching there we found out it was a full house and the receptionist asked us to go and have an environment check of that counter(also with a condition of having only one person enter), which my friend did and she asked one of the waiters there if there are seats available to which he said a yes and then we entered paying a redeemable cover charge of 1.5k only to find out there was not even a single chair available to sit even in the bar area, not sure why the waiter nodded with conviction when my friend asked the same. The party was completely disorganised, some chairs were vacant throughout the evening maybe because it‚Äôs not yet decided who will sit on those iron thrones and most of us had to stand throughout, ¬†out of whom some overzealous people pulled chairs from here and there and self declared themselves kings in the north! In the party event it was mentioned that there would be some GOT special cocktails but when my friend asked the same the bartender asked her preference and took the burden on himself giving a condition that she can't care about the price as the cocktails are not mentioned in the menu! The cocktails were nothing extraordinary costing 500 each! So we had to redeem the cover charge with those two cocktails and only one okayish starter paying 400 more and had to leave the place without the thrones!

It was a very bad experience there leading to my friend renaming the place to POOR HOUSE!

Pathetic place... I went there with my friends... the music was unbearable... we ordered for few drinks and after 20 mins the waiter came and said it's unavailable... when we complaint about it to the manager, he insulted us and asked us to leave... the manager is ill mannered... the concern person should take immediate action regarding this otherwise this place is going to loose a lot of loyal customers. Highly disappointed...

8500sq ft of lounge space is a luxury in the heart of IT city, sector 5, Salt Lake. Pour House caters to a huge amount of hanging out and relaxation demanded by the fast-paced youth of today. The space is balanced between an enormous bar, lounging zone, dance floor, a private section and an open-to-sky hookah area. The decor is spaced out, modern and funky with enough bright spots and selfie backdrops in cheerful colour streaks. Lunch offers a flat buffet, while early evening sees after-work bingeing and late night gets the DJ pumping it hard. The bar actually pours a classic cocktail mix of Singapore Sling, Long Island Iced Tea, Whisky Sour, Bloody Mary, Margarita et. al. chilling with Tropical Red and White Sangrias and peps up to¬† power shooters like Hell Shoot, B52, Kamakazi, Bullet along with regular¬† spirits and beers. The menu complements with Paneer Cordon Bleu, Parsley Paneer Tikka, Mozzarella Cheese Stick, Nanu Pizza, Bhuna Jeera ka Fish Tikka, Adrak ke Panje, Prawn Salt and Pepper, Chicken Supreme, Penne Alfredo and one meal platters like Mutton Rogan Josh Platter, Masala Fish Platter or Paneer Lababdar Platter.

This place was suggested by one of my friend who stays In Kolkata and is the best of all the places I have been till today. The ambience, food, service, people were so perfect. They serve alcohol+seesha.
We ordered for 
mac and cheese- best of all till date. It was made with perfection, the flavours and the consistency were great.
Grilled vegetable pizza- it's a thin crust pizza with grilled vegetables on top. Crust was over cooked but the taste was amazing.
Paneer labdar platter- this platter serves 2 naan's
Paneer curry and a dhal with onion salad. Taste is out of the world. 
Parsley rice- herbed rice with freshly made salad on side and also vegetable patties on top with melted cheese. The Taste was good but can be made better.
Paneer corden blu- paneer stuffed with cheese and deep fried. It was so perfectly cooked that just one bite and you will be like wow. This is there signature dish.
Love in pour house- a mocktail made with orange juice and cranberry juice. 
They should probably open one outlet in chennai.
The rates were also so reasonable according to me.
Just a small thing I dint like was they were very careless about the bill. They charged us extra for the drinks we dint have. Was it intentionally or unintentionally we don't know. Apart from that we loved each and everything. Will definitely visit again.

Good ambiance. Live music is good as well. Food is tasty. Cocktails could taste a bit better but not bad actually. Sheesha is good as well. Dance floor is rather modest space. Overall a very good place to hang out.

This seems to be one of the hottest places to hangout in the city now a days, especially on Thursdays when its ladies night. Two shots and glasses of wine free for the ladies, with a dance floor, loud music and a hookah bar in a microbrewery, what could be more crowd pleasing? I went to catch up with a friend over here (which turned out to be a not-so-good idea as the music was too loud for us to actually do some catching up), but we had a fairly good time. We ordered chicken cordon bleu and Thai chicken (which was chef recommended). Presentation of both dishes were nice. The cordon bleu chicken was pretty good to taste with the right amount of chicken and creamy cheese. The Thai chicken was served with kaffir lime leaves, which when consumed together hits you with a burst of flavor. Then again, it could be an acquired taste (my friend kept his leaves separate). ¬†I just wish that the sauce with which they served the dish had been an in house created sauce and not the sweet chili sauce available in rack shelves.

The choice of music was also just right. Service was fairly good.

Overall a good experience, would like to return with friends.

This place is located near RBD salt lake..
This place is really big in size and has a nice ambience but personally i would like a more dimmer lighting..
They also give happy hours..
Service of the staff is very good..
And also serves some amazing cocktails nd tasty food..
But my only concern about this place is it's hygiene..!!
As i ordered a pizza when i went there, after few bites i did find a hair in it..!!although the pizza was changed but i had a very "Yuck" Moment..!!!
Please guys do work on it..!!

Iv been to this place twice.The food is nothing special according to me but is seriously overpriced.Interiors are good but both the times I went,the place was relatively less crowded.I guess,they would really need to work on their menu anytime soon.The food is good,but obviously if I am paying more,I would want better and not good.

Been there few times , the food we had was all done well from CHICKEN CORDON BLUE , PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH to CHICKEN LASAGNA, the cocktails are even better , we tried BLOODY MARY , COSMOPOLITAN and WATERMELON MARGHERITA . The dessert CHOCO LAVA was honestly a let down. The service is appreciably good even in a full house. The outside open air set up proves to be too beneficial for smokers and shisha lovers and the selection of tracks played lifts up the mood in minutes . Little bit on the expensive side but overall a great place for partying over sessions of booze and food in sector 5 area.

Hip n Happening Place at Sector 5

Ambience: Located beside the RDB mall, on the Megatherm tower above the Pantaloons outlet in sector 5, this place is currently the most happening place in sector 5 area. It is very spacious with an amply sized dance floor and very plush seating arrangements. The walls are filled with quotes about life and another wall contains all the miniature iconic monuments of the famous cities across the world. Live TV keeps on playing desi Bollywood numbers. And one side contains a very well quipped bar. Place remained pretty empty (probably because it was a weekday afternoon). Parking is available.

Food: The food prices are extremely high with an Aloo Platter costing Rs. 479/- without taxes.!!! However, the buffet price was reasonable and hence we settled for the buffet as it was already lunch hours. The buffet menu was simple with 5 types of kebabs in the starter and Blue lagoon as complimentary drink. The main course contained noodles, rice, nan, dal tadka, paneer, fish, malai kofta and chicken. The dessert included brownie with ice cream and darshan. There was thin crust pizza in the veg buffet. Food quality was okayish. Nothing to complain but nothing to praise either. Kebabs were well cooked and the pizza was tasty.

Service: Staffs are extremely well behaved and helpful here. They are very attentive and try to make all possible changes to suit your need. Extra brownie points for the most polite and well-mannered staffs I have come across in recent times. Cash and card both accepted.

Overall: Very expensive if you choose a la carte. Buffet is good. Looking forward for a weekend visit to try their dance-floor and specially the silent disco.

This place is offers good ambience and has a good capacity. They  should take care a little more about their maintenance. We had cocktails and a non veg platter. The platter items were delicious where we were served four types of starter items. Among cocktails we had watermelon martini, sweet 21st and Cosmopolitan. The best among them was cosmopolitan. Overall a nice place to chill along your friends.

After repeated attempts to visit this place on weekends I finaly decided to drop the idea.On a quiet monday afternoon our destination changed its way to Pour house , first floor of Pantaloons, sector 5.

As the name suggests the place has a great ambience and even better drinks.We settled ourselves in a comfy couch beside the bar.The well lit and spacious bar ,quirky trunk shaped box tables and walls with quotations kind of give a very modern vibe as you look around.The servers are prompt having their attention always on each table.Since it was quite an empty house we took our time to order .Finally with suggestion from our server our order for the evening :

1.Assorted Nonveg platter
2.Grilled chicken pizza
3.Cocktail fish finger

I liked their option of the platter where one can customise the kebabs from individual chicken and fish sections from the starter.So we opted for

Junglee chicken masala tikka
Chicken reshmi kebab
Chicken 65
Cocktail fish finger

To wash down all of these we had quite a few mojitos.They had a one on one offer for mojitos for that evening .The drinks were well made keeping proper proportions of alchohol. Coming to the food we loved the fish fingers.They were fresh and soft oozing out flavours.From the assorted platter the chicken reshmi kebab and fish finger would be my top picks so much so that we ended up ordering a separate cocktail fingers.The pizza was thin crust with chunks of chicken and a layer covered with cheese.The decor is very well thought and eye-catching from the lamps in the washroom to the ultra trendy smoking zone hand painted.I would personally recommend Pour house as a lounge because of their food and cordial service.Team pour house deserves brownie points for that.

Situated near RDB cinemas,on the first floor atop the pantaloons building. 
Dropped in with friends with high expectations,and we weren't disappointed. The long island iced tea , mint mojito,and non-veg kebab platter was good, and the hookah was a delight to the senses too.
On the pricier side,but recommended.

POUR HOUSE has been one of the best experiences that i have gathered along with my friends. everything about this place, from the ambience, to the services, along with music, decor and the best part "THE FOOD", had been totally outstanding!! we enjoyed delicious mouth watering cuisines such as Reshmi Chicken Tikka, Drums Of Heaven, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Jungli masale ka murg tikka, along with the relishing mock tail, Green Apple Martini, that was one of a kind. in the end we had POUR HOUSE special jar with BROWNIE!!!!! kudos to the POUR HOUSE team! Keep up the good work. Keep pouring and keep rocking!! :)

An overhyped place!
Ambience is not that great!
Food prices are overcharged!
Service is also not good..
If you are a food lover then this is not the correct place to visit..
Food is also not upto the mark..
Think twice before visiting this place..
A glass of coke will cost you 130 here(including taxes)!
Though its not worth to be charged..
U r not in a 3 star..

Overall:
Food: 1

Looking for a place to hang out and dance your heart out? Well then this place checks your list.
The food being really average, sometimes below average, this place is 'on' due to its alcohol serving and the dance floor.
The staff is courteous. They respond to the orders immideately.

Pocket pinch - slightly high.
You can go for its few starters. Would have been a better experience if the food was worthy to taste as well.

Pour house was on my bookmarks from the very beginning. Located at sector 5 this is truly a luxury lounge space. This place offers a huge amount of space for hanging out and chilling with probably all your favorite songs being played. Went there during the ipl season so could enjoy the live screening. It was not much occupied at that time so the place offered enough privacy. Ambiance all over is made for relaxing but if you are there to click pictures you will find this place a little dim. Went there to have a hookah and beer so don't know much about the food. Staff was polite and friendly. P. S. The Babycorn was just so yummy.!
Will soon be visiting again =)

Disgusting place. The floor manager is extremely rude and unfriendly. I guess, it gets crowd Bec of the location and the DJ. So, if u wanna pay for music, this is the right place. But, keep your expectations low wrt the service. And yes; don't disturb the floor manager.

Been there back in December'16 and again in May'17. This pub provides an wonderful ambience to just forget everything and chill out!

Compared to all else, food is probably the weakest link of this pub. The dishes we tried ranged from rather meh to almost good. Buck up guys! Competition is fierce in this space now.

Interiors and arrangements are quite cosy and comfortable. Provides the usual variety of sitting options - high tables, cute little chairs and laid back sofas. THe floor is quite large and can accommodate quite a few guests at a time.

The usual wide variety of flavours are available on Sheesha's - ranging from the evergreen triple paan to exotic mixes on water, red bull or alcohol bases.¬†

Coming to the highlight of any pub - the dance floor is tucked away in a corner and is larger than it looks as it extends beyond the part usually visible from the dining area. Strangely music was wonderful the first time I was there but not so entertaining this time round. It consisted almost wholly of punjabi pop or hip-hop and felt monotonous after a little while.¬†

Staff are courteous and quick footed. Thanks Danesh for the wonderful service!

Full marks for service and arrangements but certainly need to improve on the food and music fronts.

When you find a place like this, one expects it to be perfect. ¬†Places like Pour House are a rare sight in Kolkata.
The food was a little over average, and the ambiance was top notch. However, the service was awful. The staff did not know the menu well enough and when asked about a query, he said he will get back to me, which he never did. One will not mind spending money here if the quality of staff improves. Don't get me wrong, they were not rude at all. They just didn't know their stuff.

I just loved Pour House, situated at the sector 5 in saltlake area. The ambiance was pretty good. I loved their sitting arrangements. That pub had a separate smoking area which was basically an open roof where they had also sitting arrangements which was good. Hospitality was damn good I must admit. Above all, Foods were awesome.

After a good movie went in for a buffet lunch . It was very cheap covered it within 1200 for two and the starters were very good which made us ignore the main course however the paneer was rubbish amonst the main course dishes as it was of an inferior quality , veg biriyani was okay . Did not like the dessert collection , only shows stopper was the starters which included tasty veg pizzas , spring rolls ( delicious ones ) , some patty made from spinach which was too dry and the non veg starters were just voila üòõüòÖüòÅ

Located at Sec 5 above Pantaloons! Location is quite easy to find. They have vallet parking available every day. The place is a huge one with nice combination of sofas and chairs. They have an LED lit up dance floor which is a cherry on the top.
Going to the food, they have great varieties of various cuisines. I tried Panner Cordon Blue, Niligiri Seekh Kabab and Melted Mushroom Cup which were of great taste. They even serve alcohol alongwith various Cocktails which is a perfect blend. The service staff were very courteous and the DJ was excellent.

Had a team buffet with my office colleagues. It is a type of retro bar. After being to many restaurants earlier, I find this Bar to be good and serving great food.
The starter tasted great. The service delayed for a bit, but then they came to the pace and the starter was unending.¬†
The ambiance was awesome, with music and great food. They have a dance floor which looks great.¬†
In place like Sector V the buffet price is competitive.¬†
The main course was also awesome and my team loved it a lot.¬†
For desert the brownie was soft and tasted fresh.
For lunch the also added prawn as extra which also tasted good.
I know they have recently started the buffet, but as of taste it was awesome but they have to work on the service.
I will be looking to visit this place again.

Hello people, Today I got the opportunity to visit this Restaurant for lunch with my colleagues to treat them. We went for the buffet which costs Rs. 570 and booked it 2 days prior to our visit. As barbeque has the best buffet around but still we wanted to try something different as we visit BARBEQUE too often.Here is my GENUINE UNBIASED review

I will come to food part later, lets give you a brief about the experience...

First thing, this place is not for meals, not at all, from the sitting arrangements or the decors. You will be provided tables that has similar height of a tea table or less than your knee and small area. Believe me its gonna make your back pain and will make you uncomfortable. It is good for the liquor service but LUNCH!!! No way..

There are NO FORKS when you are served. And amazing thing is there are no individual PLATES while STARTERS are served. All has to pick the starters from one plate using small sticks/hand. Problem arises when the dish is too hot or large.There is no scoop to pull ice cream, instead there is a large spoon, you need to be very skilled to put ice cream in your plate....Its a joke of eating system surely, too pathetic.

LATE, LATE LATE LATE... 20 to 30 mins were wasted just to start the serving.. Imagine if you come during packed office time and half n hour is lost doing nothing.. But its not the WORST, the indian BREAD came when I paid the BILL and they were like Ooppss!! Sorry.. LOL.. STILL ITS NOT THE WORST.. So i am coming to the WORST PART OF THE ENTIRE TIME, that is, one if my colleague has to leave early and asked the servers to bring the desert as it was not there beside main course and it was almost the time when we had started our main course... He waited for 20 mins and then left with a disgust. Finally the dessert came after 20 more mins... Imagine how EMBARRASSING it is when you throw a party and people has to leave like that.. Another incident was, one person asked for cold drinks instead of mocktails and they said its not an option in buffet so I asked him to serve it additionally..half an hour passed and when we asked about the drink he again said the same thing.. Then again we ordered and finally got it..

Now coming to FOOD part,
There were good amount of variety in starters... Mocktail, Soup with noodles served initially, then came dishes of chilli Potato, Fish, popcorn chicken, drum sticks, thin crust pizza ... All tasted good specially Fish.. Liked it very much
On main course there was veg biriyani, Paneer masala, tadka dal/ dal makhni, chilli chicken, potato, fish, mutton roganjosh with additionally salad.. Naan was there but it came very late.. Main course was OKish, nothing extraordinary..
In dessert, ONLY 3 options were there, chocolate brownie, ice cream and gulab jamuns.. I came to know from the waiter that it was kept in fridge and then served to us after heating those...so NOT FRESH at all.. But taste was fine, no complain.

Summing up the experience, good foods couldn't save the management blunder. Felt irritated throughout the time.
So if you have plenty of time or want to spend time with someone for prolonged hours without much effort and ignore staff management blunders then also dont come, rather go to 10 downing street opposit to RDB :D

I am still it giving a 2 star rating instead of 0 just because of the food which was as whole better average. Also very few option in dessert.
The people who told me to come here, i dont consider them as a well wisher anymore..
Thank you for reading. I will be glad if it helped you.

Went to pour house with office colleagues for team lunch. The buffet is quite reasonable compared to other restaurants. The ambience reminds the local pubs in London. Nice decor with good music. Can be good if visited while there is any big sports tournament going on. The starters were quite good specially #panfriedchillifish, #broadwaywings, #chickenhardyballs #babari aloo these are must try. However, the veg pizza served was very thin with lots of cheese, but did not find much veggies like bell pepper or olives etc. I guess they could do much better with their menu. Although the staff's were quite friendly and was trying hard to meet the refill pressure, but I guess they are not quite accustomed to serve large number of people together. The service was not up to the expectation. Since they started the buffet recently, should be much faster than they are in serving. The restaurant is a perfect mix of lounge & pub. Also, the seating arrangement is not at all comfortable for buffet or eating purpose. Now to the main course, the prawn (special order) and the mutton Rogan Josh was quite good rest need to work upon. The desserts did not excite my taste buds much except the brownie. It was very soft and warm and tasted good. To be in competition for the buffet they really need to work hard on the quality of their service and the main course. To the bar menu I found that it's too costly. Since I appreciate their hard work, I wish them all the best for the future. üëç

I have been in so many places but never wrote a review, this time I cant resist myself. This is surely the worst buffet in town. Nothing to mention specifically, It was a complete horrible experience and waste of time and money. I went for lunch buffet and options are very less and every item was smelling bad from inside. They were not at all fresh, they cooked them 1-2 days ago. I was the only customer that day so you can guess they obviously will not cook for one or two person everyday. Staffs are also very rude and were behaving very badly specially one guy named 'Sahadeb'. So never ever go for lunch buffet there.

Another new age pub at sector V, Saltlake and I quite loved it. Pretty big place, loud music, floor for dancing, area for smokers, offers my fav LIITs and Hookahs - serves perfect for party mood. 

But pricing of the food bit up, but while on partying will you mind? I don't think so.

Pour House is one of the most happening gastropubs in the Saltlake area which requires no introduction! Famous for its beautiful interiors and dancefloor, you can't just give this place a miss. Located a floor above Pantaloons, Sec V, this place is a party goers paradise! Excitingly, last week I was invited here to try out their mocktails, cocktails, and their newly launched buffet menu.

On entering the place, I was awestruck at the size and beauty of Pour House. It's huge! And when I say huge, I mean almost a mammoth sized clubhouse! Loud music, and neon lights - this place is a win!

Let's start talking food now. Within a few minutes of arrival, the food started coming in. We were given platters of appetizers, and coolers, after which we moved on to their buffet section.

Drinks :

‚Ä¢ Love in Pour House - This was the first drink that was served to us, and was a mocktail which was a mix of Orange juice, Mint, Strawberry crush, and Cranberry Juice. This was my favourite from the afternoon. Do give this a try, and soothe your soul!

‚Ä¢ Pouring Wildcat Cooler - Another mocktail which tasted really good. This was a concoction of Guava juice, Lemon juice and Tabasco sauce. Special mention to the cardamom stick which gave a unique taste to this drink. Honestly I've never tasted anything like this before and this drink was a win!

‚Ä¢ Watermelon Martini - Aah! The cocktails had finally arrived and I was oh so excited! This was an elegant looking cocktail, which had Vodka, Watermelon juice and Lime cordial. Tasted out of this world, frankly! I enjoyed this drink so soo much!

‚Ä¢ Mexican Cool - This was a cool blue coloured cocktail, which looked so soothing! This had a Gin and Vodka base which was infused with Blue Curacao and Lime cordial. It was salt rimmed and tasted excellent!

Appetizers :

‚Ä¢ Non Veg Platter - The first platter of the afternoon arrived and it looked so good. This platter consisted of Pan Fried Fish, Chicken Lollipops and Chicken Tikka Kebab. Each of the items tasted really good, but the Pan Fried Fish deserves a special mention for being excellent!

‚Ä¢ Fried Non Veg Platter - We were served another non veg platter, but this was fried. This had Fish Fingers, Hardy Balls which is a chef's special chicken ball, and Fried Chicken. Here again the Fish Finger stole the show!

‚Ä¢ Veg Platter - We were served the Veg Platter and we weren't disappointed in the least bit. All the three items tasted fantastic, which were Tandoori Babri Aloo, Falafel, and Veg Spring Roll. Each of these platters came with a number of dips, and was a good start to an excellent lunch!

‚Ä¢ Veg Pizza - Next we were served a cheesy, thin crust veg pizza which was loaded with broccoli and bell peppers. I loved the taste and the fact that the crust was perfectly baked, neither too crispy, nor too soggy. Recommended!

Main Course :

After hogging so much, we made our way to the buffet section, which had extensive variety. Starting from Manchow Soup to Dal Makhani to Chicken Sweet and Sour, you name it they have it. Honestly I was very impressed with the spread. As I was almost full, I couldn't taste all the items. These are the dishes that I had had from the buffet section.

‚Ä¢ Veg Biryani
‚Ä¢ Veg Noodles
‚Ä¢ Paneer Butter Masala
‚Ä¢ Chicken Sweet and Sour
‚Ä¢ Fish Schezwan

There were a number of Indian dishes like Mutton Roganjosh, and Kadai Chicken too, but I was almost bursting at the seams. Hence couldn't eat all the items.
Coming to the dessert next, they had moist Chocolate Brownies, and Warm Gulabjamuns. After creating some space in my stomach, I devoured 4 pieces of brownie and 2 Gulabjamuns. Ah! It was divine!

There goes my dining experience at Pour House, and honestly, I'm very impressed with their newly launched buffet. The buffet is quite vast priced only at Rs. 479 plus taxes. Definitely worth a try!
I would like to end my review by saying that the ambience + the drinks + the music + the food = A Big Win!!

A very funky place. Has valet parking. Located on the first floor of Pantaloons at Sector V. Offers hookah as well. For drinks, Had ordered a mocktail-- Love in the Pour House and a cocktail-- Long Island Iced Tea. The mocktail was tad too sweet for my liking. The LIT was nicely made. For food, ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu. Well prepared. Overall nice place

- Location & Ambiance :
Located in Sector 5 Salt Lake, Pour House is the perfect place if you are looking for a place to have a really good time with friends/family.
Ambiance is quite quirky, neither too dim nor too lit up, just perfect.
The DJ is awesome as well.

- Food :
Order anything from the menu blindly and you will not be disappointed.

I tried :

Chilli Mushrooms 4/5
Paneer Tikka 4.5/5
Paneer Cordon Bleu 4.5/5

For main course, we had Dal makhani, Paneer lababdar, mix veggies, garlic naan.
All the curries and breads were perfect.

The quality and quantity of food is good, no compromise done.

- Staff & Service :
Staff is friendly and always alert even after the music being loud.
Service is quick!

- Value for money : 4.5/5

- Will I visit again?
CAN'T WAIT!!!

A nice place to hangout with friends. Was greatly impressed by the ambience but disappointed by the veg food items. Non veg dishes were good though. Overall it was a good experience.

Pour House doesn't need any introduction. It has been acclaimed by many as the finest gastropub in Sec V, Salt Lake. It was time for me to finally give this place a visit for the first time. I was invited here for a food tasting session with Nilanjana Bagchi , mainly to try their newly launched buffet.

Pour House is located in the first floor of the same building where Pantaloons is. The place is huge and very skilfully constructed. The decoration is very quirky and goes well with the theme. It was time for some munching to begin.

We were initially served two of their special cocktails and two mocktails. Among cocktails, we had Watermelon Martini and Mexican Cooler. The Watermelon Martini had gin and was very refreshing. The Mexican Cooler was done was a tequila base. It was salt rimmed and tasted wonderful.

Among mocktails, we had Love in Pour House and Wild Cat Cooler. The former had orange, mint, strawberry crush and mango juice. It was sweet, chilled and refreshing. The latter had a very unique taste of cinnamon and was refreshing as well.

We moved on the appetizers, which were served in platters. The first platter included Chicken Lollypops, Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Chicken Tikka. These were really tempting. The lollypop was well done; so was the chicken tikka but what impressed both of us a lot was the fish. The fish was soft and fresh and tasted brilliant.

The next platter was the one that can be enjoyed with some wine or beer. The platter consisted of crumb fried items. It included Cocktail Fish Fingers, Hardy Chicken Balls and Fried Chicken Supreme. I loved the entire platter, specially the chicken balls which were their speciality and tasted out of the world. The fish fingers and fried chicken were equally excellent.

The third platter was a veg platter which included Falafel, Tandoori Aloo and Veg Spring Roll. The veg items were good as well, specially the Tandoori Aloo.

Our platters were followed by a veg pizza which was topped with chesse, bell peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, onions, etc.

We walked towards the buffet section to savour the main course. The Veg Manchow Soup tasted well, the noodles being perfectly crispy. The veg biryani was actually something that surprised me with its amazing flavour. Kudos to the chef ! In the Chinese section, I tried the Veg Hakka Noodles which I paired up the fish and chicken options. Once again the fish particularly impressed me with the amazing texture. The dessert options included gulab jamuns and brownies.

Overall, the new buffet menu at Pour House is worth a try. I loved the entire spread from the appetizers to the main course. I'm definitely going back to try the drinks and the other items on the menu.

In a party mood? A√±d Bollywood music and remixes makes you tap your feet big time. Just plan for pour house. 
With humongous space for a bar the place a got a dance floor which you can always rock with dance moves. The music system is loud but good at the same time and the songs will definitely make you tap your feet.
Food is nice unlike other bars where it is served just for sake of serving. Staff is good and seating space is ample. 

So next time want to rock the evening with family or friends and more into Bollywood style this would a place to be...!!

Worth the money and worth the time..!!

This place is located near Infinity Benchmark Building above Pantaloons. Went there for buffet lunch. The price for buffet per person is Rs479 plus taxes. 
The ambience of this place is good. The staffs are good and courteous, however I found out the service to be a bit slow. 

Now coming to the food, this place has no such buffet arrangements done. The waiters serve everything to your table itself. We opted for both veg and non-veg buffets.

Starters : the veg starters included thin crust pizza, spring rolls, tandoori potato. The non-veg starters included drums of heaven, chilli chicken dry, crispy chicken, fish finger, reshmi kababs. The thin crust pizza was good and the drums of heaven was just awesome.

Main Course: veg main course consisted of a paneer dish, chana masala, dal makhani. The non-veg part consisted of chilli chicken, chilli fish, butter chicken and a mutton dish. Apart from this they had noodles, veg biryani, butter naan and butter roti. The taste was average. But the Dal Makhani with Veg Biryani was soo very good. 

Desert: There was not much options in desert. They only had Gulab Jamun and Chocolate Brownie. I felt that these options are too less for the desert part in any buffet. They didn't had any ice creams as well.

Overall a good experience.

Big place, in fact, vast compared to most other lounges - thats the 1st impression. ¬†Comfortable, spacious seating and many TV screens add to the ¬†impression. The place has a dance floor too, which is awesome.¬†

I ordered for a whiskey sour, and it was well done. Drinks and food menu are quite extensive, but i found both overpriced. Even a 30 ml Old Monk rum (cheapest stuff in market) costs Rs 189.
Ordered for both burger and sandwich, and i think they were ordinary. Would not trust on the quality of food too much after my experience.¬†
Music was loud, its difficult to have a conversation. By the ambiance was electric.
With the kind of space around to shake your legs and food/drinks at your disposal, Pour House is a good place for group hangout.

A sudden plan to visit a pub with college friends; and we ended up here on a Friday evening. The first impression was quite impressive with stunning interiors and IPL matches telecasted LIVE in as many as ten-fifteen screens. The DJ was on his usual groove playing some cool music almost inviting everyone to hit the then empty dance floor.

We started with beers (Heineken) and ordered Mutton Sheik Kebab with it. A friend ordered a cocktail Luckey Lolia Margherita which was simply stunning with a blend of tequila and pineapple. Next up, we ordered Bhuna Fish Tikka which didn't taste as good as we would have expected.

It's chicken counterpart, read drumsticks, drew quite some responses from our tongues and we ended up ordering two plates of it. Meanwhile drinks flowed in the form of more beer, VAT 69 and the "good Old" Monk (for myself).
For main course we had Chicken Kung Pao Platter and Cheese Risotto Non Veg both of which were really tasty (I recommend both actually to someone who's wondering what to book in a platter full of starters).
Overall a cool place, perfect weekend destination with friends of you are up for fun. Loud music might be a problem for someone who has heart ailments. Location wise very convenient, just adjacent to Pantaloons Sector 5.
Go for it; the reason I rate 3.5 is bcoz the food tastes don't justify the cost.

Went here around a month back. We had movie tickets for evening show so went to pour house for lunch. It was not quite full n the music wasn't loud. Thank god for that!! As after reading various reviews, i thought I'd find deafening noise, but i guess they play all the loud music during the dinner time ;) pheww!
Now coming to the food, we had ordered make-your-own veg platter. It was quite delicious. We had also tried north indian main course items (paneer, kulcha etc) which were surprisingly great! 

Honestly speaking, i had expected to find a lounge kinda place with too loud music n average food. 

What i instead found was good food, nice music, friendly waiters. 
Cool! Loved it!

We ordered bear and Thai chicken and another chicken dish which had 4 different types of preparation. I loved the ambiance. The food was also nice. This is the only pub I liked in kolkata after Irish House. Nice place to spend a Saturday evening with friends. The price of food and drink is high, so don't visit at the end of the month.

Nice place near infinity building sector5. Heard a lot about this place and it totally Lived up to its expectations. The inside wall art is good of London tube stations. The drink menu is nice but most of the beers were not available. Hoegarden, Budweiser, etc was on the menu but not there. The food was worth mentioning. We took spring rolls and they were delicious. Only one thing that could be improved was that the music was too loud and can be toned down a bit.

It is one of the worst place I have visited in recent time , Usually I don't write review but this time I can't control my self every thing was pathetic we ordered for strawberry mocktails which taste like strawberry blossosom in weeding of worst caterers , then we ordered lasagna which is worst we had in my whole life the presentation , the taste every thing , them we ordered pizza which was supposed to be crisp but it's what like 'Roti'
We paid almost 5093/-which has almost 25 % taxes and they charged 79 for mineral water which they charged for normal Kinley whose MRP was 20/- which we realised very late .  The staff was poor they charge service fee 5% but they seems nowhere we have to call them even for the bill we have search for him ... very sad experience can't have pic just the  words ...

Pour House has been the buzz of sector v for a long time now. Situated just beside RDB Boulevard, this place hits all the right chords with simply the way it looks. Quite spacious with a medium sized dancefloor, bar counter and seating area, good music and casual decor makes it a proper Saturday night place. Especially the place has done some excellent and unique work with their lightings. Coming to the alcohol section, as we were having a small bachelorette party of a colleague their 1:1 happy hours till 7 was a boon for us. We had the Red wine sangria, Long Island Iced Tea, Margarita, Watermelon Martini, Breezer everything. Out of their drinks I found the LIIT the best, the wine was good, but the martini was a sheer disappointment. As far as the food is concerned, their Paneer Condor is ahmazing. Do try it whenever you check into this place. Because it was so good in spite of being a hardcore meat lover we ordered another two plates of the same. Their chicken tikka kebab was tasty too, so was the Potato Broccoli balls. The hot wings were comparatively okay and the thai fried chicken and cocktail fish fingers were just. Their dancefloor was all filled with funky neon lights, vampire filters and what not! But there was no DJ and they even didn't change the track on request. The service here is satisfactory, staff is courteous but sometimes they are too aloof to hear you calling. Pour house would be a great stress buster during the weekend which has got good food, good drinks and a dancefloor for heavens sake!

On returning back, found them rudely removed and placed somewhere else. Strongly disappointed at the incident, will specifically point out the same to my other fellow diners, friends and colleagues. Extremely disappointed at the bad courtesy shown by the staff.

One of the best place for partying and hangout at Kolkata. 

Went for a office party at Friday night. Decoration & ambience is very good. DJ was also not bad. 

Coming to food. It was started with blue legun, fresh lime and coke. In starter they served paneer kabab, baby corn, chicken pakora and fish finger. Each of them was delicious. In main course, there were roti, rice, dal, paneer, kachkolar kofta, vetki fish, mutton. Paneer and mutton was best. Fish was not bad. In desert there were gulabjanon, icecrm and pastry. Overall food quality is very good.

Enjoyed lot and recommending highly.

Pour House is near my office in sector ¬†5 and its seldom that I like going to my office area during weekends.¬†
Therefore when we arrive here last Saturday my mood was already groggy. From groggy to going ga ga over the restaurant is purely because of the sheer level o service and food it offered. Every item and drink was something unique or utmost classic.
Food : Must have(s) : Classic chilli chicken
Chicken cordon blue(One of the best items that they have)
Pan fried fish
Thai green curry(as authentic as it can get)

Cocktails : LIIT
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Trash Can

Excellent service. Good Hookah. Dance floor. Sound is a little loud. Great cocktails Great Food.

Hope you guys Keep up to this level.

Firstly, it was the heat of the moment and I decided to try this place !
It was Saturday evening so I expected a good crowd but the club was almost empty and quite. The lighting could have been made dim to soothe the ambience but anyway. I loved the dance floor and the London background.
Coming to the food, we were in a hurry so we ordered a Chicken Lasagne with beer! I loved the food, wanted to try some more dishes but couldn't.
The place would be lovely when its crowded!
Pocket friendly too, must try

Visited the place on Sunday evening.
Seating is comfortable and the dimly lit ambience was really nice.
The staff was courteous and service was amazing.
They have a projector to screen sports.
They also have a balcony area, that is away from all the hustle.
The music was really nice; it was initially retro pop songs but around 9pm the dj turned to masala bollywood songs to spice things up a bit.
The dance floor's good with neon lights.

We ordered:-
Fried Veg Dim Sum - Good.
Falafel with Pita bread - served with chickpea hummus, Nice.
Hot and Garlic Spaghetti - Good.
Chocolate Mudpie Tart - Good.
Chocolate Rum Moose - Rum was a bit too much, but overall nice.

A tad bit overpriced, but worth it.
Would definitely visit again.

To be very precise.. it was an incredible experience. The ambiance is mind blowing. The food is finger licking. ¬†Expertise in service. All-in-all, it was a great time and worth taking your fiancee for a lunch-date (which obviously I did). The wine was marvelous and they do serve hookah (though I am not sure if it is locally banned). They are very cost-effective. The quality of food served was superb, neither to spicy nor to rich and yet too tasty. The quantity was just perfect, which I loved the most. Because when I compared with a few other experiences, I noticed some food being left-over and wasted, which certainly is not a good sign according to be. You would not need to worry about your appetite to visit the place. And to add another silly point..the table-ware that they used caught my eyes. I definitely would improvise to some extent after marriage.¬†

So..to summarize, I would say, if you are a foodie, do not just browse-compare-plan and ruin your meal. Just visit them, and you would not regret, for sure.¬†

A glass of red-wine, the breezy city view, and a romantic ambiance.. what more would you want or your partner expect, for the idea of a perfect date.

Set in the busiest part of Sector 5, I had heard of this place from few of my friends.. I must say I like this place... The music, the food and the d√©cor are all on the positive side.. One of my fav places to hangout with friends on a weekend..

My personal one of the best place for a guys hangout, or sports match. The Dj is excellent, playing the masala bollywood songs, especially on weekends eve. - 0.5 is for the food. The kitchen is nothing to boast about.

Ambience, crowd, food, drinks everything was amazing.. You must be wondering why is my rating so low.. 
Sometimes one small bad experience can negate all the good experience. The one small experience i had was with one of thw staff. We went on a Sunday evening and the place was fairly empty. There were people sitting outside in the smoking zone as well and were served there. We sat inside and the music was too loud for me so i politely asked the person who was waiting on me to help me take my food (one bowl of risotto) outside as i wasn't enjoying the loud music. 
The guy outrightedly refused saying it wasn't his job to move the food. If i have problem with the music i should move myself with the food.. 
It was appalling the way he behaved. I don't think the request was so out of his league that he had to behave this way.
My sincere request to the management would be to train the staff properly

One of the ultimate party hotspots in Town, and surely the next big thing in the culinary map of Kolkata.. If you like clubbing and swinging to the tunes of pop music in the weekends this is the place to be.. A huge establishment in the heart of sector-5, in the same building as Pantaloons.. If your motto is to drink in a posh set-up, dance to the tunes and even indulge in a game of pool, look no further..

The moment you enter the restaurant, you need o fill your details in a tab, the interior is modern and chic, huge led screens displaying football matches, dimly lit interiors and beautiful lanterns hanging from the top overlooking the huge Bar at one end.. Surprisingly the prices are not as high as the d√©cor suggests and given the proper occasion, you can actually keep on pouring till you drop.. Service is just top-notch and highly professional and service time is not long.. I went there last year during the festive season, when only a limited number of items from the menu were available.. We sampled:

Fresh Lime Soda: As good as it can get.. No scope to dissent..

Thai Fried Chicken: Loved the presentation of the dish.. Thai spiced deep fried chicken cubes wrapped in lemon leaves and hold with a tooth-pick.. The chicken was crisp and soft and juicy, tastefully done..

Fish Schezwan: Spicy fish saut√©ed with schezwan spice and tossed with onion, capsicum and lemongrass.. Loved the spice quotient which is not too pungent like some places..

Hakka Noodles with Chicken Manchurian: Basically served as a platter, served with Kimchi salad.. The noodle was a bit too salty to my liking but the Manchurian tasted quite good, balanced in flavors..

Overall, though we didn‚Äôt venture in any drinks but surely I would love to go back to this place with friends to sample more innovative dishes from their regular menu.. Adding to it the presentation of the dishes give you an aesthetic pleasure making the experience even more memorable.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1638/- (all incl.) for 2 people..

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 4.5/5

Ambiance: 4.5/5

One of the places i liked hanging on to but always have waived off the behaviour of the staffs here but its high time to see off this place.. There is nothing wrong with the place but the hospitality and the staffs here are having sooo‚Äã much of attitude of i don't know wat for. The tables here are freezed all the time whether or not it is booked for the whoever customers i don't know "hoping" to come , avoiding the present customers who might need to grab on to sum table.

2.5 rating is just for my love to this place. 0 for the staffs that excludes the manager who is really cooperative but rest of them are shit u wont like to debate to.

Talking about the open area it has according to some staffs its a no service zone but for regular customers it is a service zone they get served there and yes you will feel the partiality in the air. Well this post is not an outburst to anything its just wat i feel for the place.

Visited on Monday, around 9 pm mostly empty, Dj not available, and even the staff‚Äã unsure of his absence.
Ambiance is pretty cool, servers are knowledgeable.

Ordered 'Paneer cordon blue' which was layers of paneer and cheese in a Nugget, liked it.

Also tried 'Nanu dal makhni' which was a pizza with dal makhni as a topping, it was unique to anything I have tried, liked it as well. The dance floor looks good, will visit again on weekends when the crowd in there, so that the Dj plays his set.

Had went to this place with such high expectations, but got only disappointment in return. Located just nearby RDB cinemas, the interior of the place is decent and comfortable. Dark, cushiony and okayish. Tried their pan flavoured hookah and it was so bad. As me and my friend opted for their buffet, we expected atleast a decent amount of spread. But got just two starters, soup, a chicken and fish dish, both Chinese in maincourse along with plain steamed rice and noodles, ice cream, brownie (acc to them but it was just a nutty cake) and gulab jamun. Firstly, chinese and plain rice(which was supposed to be peas pulao) just doesn't go together. Except the starters every item was way below average. On top of that, they lacked tremendously in service. With a bill of Rs 2000, i regretted coming to this place.

Probably, the best place to hop in and party in Kolkata. When we hit this place on a Friday evening, we were told that they don't have enough place for 8 guys. So we had to adjust with the bar counter. Believe me, that didn't make us uncomfortable. It's got an amazing environment. The pub is spacious and has a good dance floor. Food was pretty good and they have good collection of liqours. The dj was amazing. He knew when to pick up and when to drop the beat. 
The only thing that needs to be improved is the service. It was good but they need to be faster. Probably it was due to the huge rush but that can't be an excuse.

Another new feather in the already growing list of pubs and lounges in Sector 5, Pour House stands out in being a great lounge bar. The ambience along with the drinks are quite good. However their food needs improvement although the Chicken Cordon bleu and chicken thai fry are pretty delicious.
The lounge is very spacious and they have private rooms too. The dance floor is fantastic with the neon lights which is the USP of this place.
One gripe is that the service is pretty slow and needs to be looked into. Also the place is expensive than its peers in the locality without any happy hours. 
Hope they keep up the good work....would be back soon there!

Easily the best bar cum hookah lounge that i have been to at the sector 5...they have a huge seating area comprising of couches, tables and chairs and you can also sit on raised tools adjoining the bartender's area....even though its a huge place the service was quite good...staffs are well behaved and attend you properly,recommend and ask for the feedback as well..the music inside is the best i have experienced in any such place till date and i am saying this both on the basis of the choice of music and the sound level at which it plays..it absolutely added so much charm to the ambience..they have a dance floor too which can accomodate many at a time...we had ordered a sweet 21 cocktail, a candy flavoured hush and a cream of chicken soup...I don't have a single complaint whatsoever and really enjoyed my drink,my hookah and my soup served with bread and chunks of 2 different varieties of butter..i went there on jan 1st and was really glad that i chose this place...had a great experience..will visit again in the future and will highly recommend it..is a bit pricey though,this place but its worth it..

Visited Pour House for a get together, and the ambience really triggered us. Loud music, a decent dance floor is their forte. They have buffet option as well. We tried ala-carte, and had ordered broadway and fried chicken in starters. They were good. They had variety of options in their drinks menu. Had Margarita after a long time but was not satisfied.
Coming to main course and service, both were disappointing. They have these combos, out of ehich we ordered noodles with kung pao chicken, and the quantity was not enough even for one person. Same goes for hot and garlic spaghetti. Service was very slow even though there were less customers. We had to call them multiple times to clear our plates and get new ones.
Not an awesome experience as expected.

Service is good and I like that concept of their glowing nameplate

I wanted to book this place for a semi-private party. First I speak to their manager who tells me that he is available from 12pm-12am at the place. But when I went there was noone to attend. After a wait a very young boy comes out claiming to be the owner(and who had no idea about the rates and packages). This guy vaguely shows me the place and asks me to wait for his manager to come(this was already after 30mins of waiting). In the mean while this owner is gone because it seemed like I had interrupted his own party with his friends.
All in all a very unprofessional behaviour and unpleasant experience.

It was a sudden plan when we went here and so were not exactly prepared for it.
The ambience and music is good. The dance floor with its neon lighting makes it good too. 
We didn't order anything to eat except paneer tikka. But the tikka was good. Properly cooked and served.

The drinks are as usual little costly. 
I was left wanting for service though. Would look around and find no-one to call to. Only if that would have been better.

Went with my hubby.... place is fine. Nothing great types. It has valley parking but no board on entering so keep looking around n finding.
Music: was okay types... in between few good songs were being played.
Food: quality and quantity wise good. But taste wise nothing great. In patao broccoli balls... i could hardly find any broccoli. It was just cheese n patato.
Drinks: bad experience... i had 2 shots plus large whisky but still no effect.
Hookha: it says alcohol hookha but no effect though. Only positive point was it was not dry.
Staff: there wont be any attention given to u.. if u want anything please call staff and tell them. We even had to ask for tissues. Only positive point was karthik .. a staff person ... he was always smiling.
Over all ... not a good experience.

Pour House.... a place near RDB boulevard sector 5 salk lake above pantaloons and just beside barbeque nation.... this place is pretty widely spread with nice decor,  gives you an instant feeling of a typical European pub with giant screen playing sporting channels..... the menu is not too big but enough for a pub.... we were a group of 4 and took our client out for some drinks and dinner.... we kept it simple and went for beer pints... ordered some snacks, one of which is a couple of platter for chicken cordon blue.... another fried chicken,  french fries and then dinner as fish and chips,  stuffed chicken breast,  a couple of chinese gravy with noodles and rice.... the cordon blue tasted great specially due to the quality of cheese inside but it's not the traditional cordon blue since it doesnt have ham inside.... the chicken breast stuffed with spinach was good but the rest of the food was average to okayish considering the price and 40% tax that is charged.... the customer service too is not the best and we struggled throughout to get the attention of the staff to open the beer bottles or get the menu card..... the lighting is too dim and the music is too loud with bad choice of songs....the worst part is that i called them and they confirmed a 10% corporate disc which they vehemently refused when we asked for the bills.... i was fine if they would have refused at the beginning but this behaviour and attitude left a bad taste at the end...

Situated above Pantaloons in Salt lake city sector 5, Pour House is a comfortable place to spend an evening with friends over a drink or two.
The food is top notch...special mention for Melted Mushroom Cups which was a show stopper for me. The mocktails were made and presented beautifully.
All in all, its a good place to visit and worth the money spent.

Very good place to hangout with friends. Ambiance is superb, small chair with couches and music makes the the environment amazing. Crowd is found also find very behaved and you know this place is best for organizing birthday parties as I did the same on my birthday. They really played birthday music for me as everything was planned by my buddies. Thanks Ravi, Sagar, Abhik & Vikash.

Nice decor. The lit badges of the staff looked really cool. There was a private party when we went there. And before it started, the balcony was the smoking zone. After that, people had to smoke outside the washroom. So that's a bummer. The management should think about that.

Food is okay. Nothing stood out as such. We had chicken fingers, a chicken cutlet kind of a thing and the Jangli Masale ka Murgh Tikka, which tastes like Chicken Tikka Kebab. Simple as that.
Also, they only had Heineken and Budweiser. That's just inexcusable.

I would love to go back to this place again. It's a nice enough joint to hang out at every now and then. But there's another thing. A couple of us went out to get my friend a cab, and when we came back, the bouncer wouldn't let us in. And refused to even check the register. Had to call one of my friends inside the bar to come to the door and prove that we already have a table inside. And this happened to a lot of other people waiting outside with us.

The music was good though. They played a retro-pop playlist with songs like Cecilia and Mysterious Girl üòÅ

I'm not going back there until I hear they've corrected those things. But overall, recommended. The place has a very cool vibe.

Went to this place during Durga puja times.decor is quite average.But the food taste superb.Better then any leading restaurant.But, the worst part is d service.Butlers r way too rude n dishonest.At first dey will refuse d drink which u order n ask you order an expensive one.Wen we didn't order dey said oh we have a last peg of dat drink which u asked initially ..n dis happened multiple times with us.dey take cover charge n make u enter den inside den dey say we don't have tables so u have to wait for n hr.Bullshit...while we were inside a major fight took place n guess Wat dey had no security bouncers for help..dat was soooo scary.their card machine do not work.its a pain if u want to settle ur bill via card.Overall, not at all a good place to chill.

one of the worst places in sector 5. they as if make sure that their playlist just turns off your mood. and even if you request them they will give u all lame reasons like the dj is just on his way and so on and so forth finally making you feel so bored and frustrated that you will be bound to leave the place.

Yesterday along with my office colleagues I visited that place.I was so excited about Pour House but this place disappointed me a lot.People never expect visiting a pub on Saturday night to hear sad songs.We asked them to change the songs but they said Dj will come at 7 o clock.But till 9pm there was no Dj.An expensive place with lot of disappointment.

Could see the way the designers have worked to make every tiny bit of this place stand out. From the lit badges of the staff to the to the bill dishes etc. Cheers.

What hurt my eyes ? - The harsh blue lighting in the Verandah | Balcony. Really really sad.

What hurt my ears ? - ¬†The extremely loud music even when there is nobody dancing. Noise pollution. Hard to have a conversation without hurting my throat. Wouldn't go to a place just to drink and look at my mate's face.

What hurt my bum ? - The seating arrangements.

Food - Nothing great. As normal as it could be.

Would I visit again ? ¬†- Can't think of a reason.¬†

I'm sorry.

Word of Advice - You definitely should do something with the lighting outside in the balcony.

Lookin at the rating of pour house..my expectation was on a higher note though...
Overall the experience was a good one...(cannot say a great one)
The ambiance is good , music ok...I found the DJs standing ‚ò∫ 
Coming to food ...thumbs up to that ..and the service as well
We had ordered pan fried chilli fish...was nicely made...tangy and delicious..bt yes ..the fish was not too fresh
We had 2 platters ..one chicken korma and the other chicken lababdar...both had 2 kulchas (very tasty), chicken dish, dal makhani, onion salad...
Chicken lababdar was very tasty ...would recommend..the chicken was so soft and juicy...and the onion salad needs a special mention as it was so tasty that we had it even after our dishes were finished.
Service was prompt ...

Went to this place yesterday with a friend of mine and it was a rainy evening! It is situated in the same building as where Pantaloons is, sector 5. We went there around 6pm and it wasnt crowded. They play good music and the service is prompt. Unfortunately we didnt order for food cause we were quite full. We ordered for teen paan hookah and some beer. The place is really nice. However, the washroom could be a little better. It had a smell there so it wasnt pleasant. Would like to come back here again.

Good place to hangout with friends. Amazing place to party. Though being a restaurant for drinks and hookahs, the food needs a lot more improvement. The quality and quantity of food was good. But keeping in mind, the price was excessive for such foods. The variety of food was also not there. Even the hookah variety was also not upto the mark. Needs a lot improvement.
We had ordered chilly mushroom and chicken cordon blue along with iced hush hookah and a bottle of  Heineken.

So in case u decide to throw a party think twice Coz if suppose the bill amount is 10K u might end up paying 1K to the waiter.. Changed menu.. Bad music.. Pretty average food...

This place is just one of those pubs in Kolkata that r highped unnecessarily. I went thr with a group of friends at around 10.30pm on a Saturday nyt. First of all the receptionist told us that it would be open upto 2am. N that was the reason we went inside. But around 11.30 one of the staffs came to us asking to give the last orders if any as the bar would close at 12!! Leaving aside this confusion if I talk about music.. it was just pathetic. The worst I hv ever heard anywhr across India. The dj was just not ready to play the choice of songs ppl wanted. Plus playing sad romantic n heartbroken songs in a pub!!! Who does that? Last it was just the ok ok food n drinks that helped us sustain that place.. Not worth the money u spend here... Need to improve a lott

I have visited this place a few times. The interior and the decor is really nice. It's very fun and fresh. I visit a hell lot of places so I honestly feel that the rates could have been lower. The music also needs to be way better. Bad music can totally kill your vibe. Though I like their sufi nights and the fact that they are trying to bring a change in the genre of music played. But I visited on one Sunday night and honestly I was highly bored. However the place is nice and I'd definitely visit again, just hoping for better music.

We visited Pour House on Nabami and we just loved the way they  welcomed us. The place was awesome and the ambience was mind blowing. But coming to the food part, the options for drinks and food were too less and it was quite expensive. Whatever we wanted to order was unavailable there. We ordered Alfredo Chicken Pasta, Mozarella Cheese Stick, Prawn Salt and Pepper, Cocktail Fish Finger and Thai Fry Chicken. The food tasted average  and nothing was special about any of the dishes.

Pour house is one of the most talked about pubs in sector V. It is located on the first floor of the building beside chai break. We went there on a weekday and found the place to be decently crowded. At the first sight the interior and ambience just seemed to be ok and below my expectations created by the hype by people. Place has a huge seating area with a mixture of high chairs, couches etc. We decided to start with couple of beers and chili babycorn. After a while we started feeling bored maybe for the dull music they were playing or maybe cos we were only two and don't prefer sheesha. Place is very expensive and not the worth the money they are charging. One time visit is ok. Food menu is not very extensive.

A number of new joints have come up in the sector 5 area of the city. We thought of giving it a try since it had made a good rep in a short period of time. To begin with, the first major disappointment is that its neither a pub where you can have your weekend night outs nor a lounge where you can have a few drinks with good music. I believe they messed it up trying to find a good match of both. The music and the choice of songs was definitely a big turn off. Coming to the food, the dishes were served well, the portions were less though considering the amount they charge for it. Taste was ok, we tried a couple of dishes on fish, which turned out to be good. Service was prompt as well. But the very fact that they are unable to find a good balance between what they want to serve and what they are actually serving is a big disappointment.

"HAPPENING" this is how i would describe this place in one word .
How do i start to write about this place  because already i have too many things to say about Pour house

Ambience:
This place describes a true finesse, the dim lights, high chairs, couches , couple seats , chandelier, the neon theme etc, also the diffrent quotes and drawings on the walls will add the woo factor in this place. As i have already visited most of the lounges in kolkata but i found the ambience in pout house is best in all.

 Drinks:
They have the regular drinks but what caught my eyes and the reason for me to visit that place is Baileys irish cream,creme de cafe, liquid cocaine not only the name but some of the drinks are good and also the plus point is presentation like danzon martini is presented very well.

Food:
Menu is extensive yet selective, best of indian and international cuisine.  In starters i had Lasuni jhinga and that was so yummy, I'll refer to everyone please try that and than cocktail fish finger tastes very yum and melted in our mouth. In main course chingri malai curry platter is good. 

Music:
The music is quite cool and also the neon theme on the florr which will forces you for dance also the rocking floor and dj is also quite good.

Final verdict:  
Overall i would say nice place to unwind, tealax and have the lounge feel and get into a good mood even though the prices are not so high also the location is quite cool...so it was good experience.

Well ianmolguptaa will recommend you to visit this place

It was totally a worthwhile experience to visit this place on a wednesday night.
They had a live performance of a band so we sat down and enjoyed our drinks which was worth enjoying and it dedicated the uniqueness of this place
After a while we had the dj who pumped up the beats with bhangra beats which you would not get in any other nightclubs. Worth visit bcoz they have a different concept than the other clubs in calcutta
P.s.-its too huge so you dont have to wait for your turn

Would not anyone love the idea of eating awesome food sitting in a spacious restaurant which has a good ambiance, that too within your budget? The lunch buffet here is to die for. Crispy chili baby corn, jungli masale murgh tikka, honey coated chicken, fish fingers (really juicy fish fingers), tandoori style aloo, each and every dish was very good in taste. Main course was good too, which had one chicken and one fish dish along with roti and fried rice. In desserts, the chocolate mousse was good. Brownies were a tad dry, but was okay if you eat them with ice cream (P.S.- They won't serve you the ice cream, you have to ask for it, which they will cordially accept). Angoori hot gulabjamuns were good, as usual. Everything was unlimited, mind it. The staffs are friendly, they will come to you and ask if everything is going right. They will ask you for more food. We had kitkat shake and pina colada mocktails too which were not included in the lunch buffet menu, though. Those were good too. I loved the kitkat shake. The ambiance was too good too. For a lazy afternoon buffet, anyone can go and experience. Lunch buffet: Mon-Sat, 12 noon-3 pm only. Around 555/person (including taxes).

I went to Pour house on a Friday evening with my friends and had a good time there.
We ordered,hardy ball and Reshmi chicken kebab,both tasted heavenly.The price of the beverages and food is on the affordable side.
The ambience is hep.The place is very spacious.The dance floor is nice too.
The DJ doesn't take requests and on asking his reply is rude.

Poor place with least importance to customer  experience.

We reached there at about 11:45 pm on a Sunday evening and after confirming from the Valet parking guy that the place is open we went in. The reception first denied entry saying it was closed and when we approached the lift they called us back saying its open.

At the time of placing we confirmed if the place would be open for some time as we would be ordering a hookah and it would need some time to consume the same. They confirmed the same and asked us to place the order at once so that they can close the cash and kitchen. We were absolutely fine with that as well. 

In the next few minutes they switched off the AC and music and got us the bill saying we need to pay the bill as the food is on its way. We repeatedly asked to atleast switch on the music so that we could sit there for some time but they just forced us to pay the bill and 3 goons kind of waiters stood infront of the table to collect the payment. 

All through this the owner was sitting on the other table completely ignoring the entire episode. This showed why the others were least about their service. 

They must understand that experience is the most important thing. If they were supposed to switch the AC and music off they could have denied the entry right away, but they just want to bill us and take money. They least bothered about the experience we would have.

Awesome ambience, fine service and amazing food choices!! We were enjoying the soulful Sufi music of the band along with some tasty food- Starter: crispy chilli baby corn; Drinks: Cosmopolitan (being a fan of 'sex and the city' series, always wanted to taste a Cosmo ;) ) , Margarita; Main course: grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes, gravy and veggies, chicken Mongolian, veg Kung pao platter and veg biriyani combo.... I took a bite of all the dishes and all were tasty!!! Highly recommended for chilling out with friends!! :)

Nice sports bar .. one of the best in secV. Spacious yet dense. Food is too good , giant screens of live spots , nice music and a dancing floor .. just above the newly created pantaloons beside RDB. A must go if you're in secV .

This place is the most talked about place of the city..Everyone wants to visit the place atleast..
So it was also in my bucket list...
The ambeiance is very good...i think one of the best in the lounge..
It is beautifully laid very spacious and has a super interior..
The lounge on the other hand has an avergae hukkah and normal menu..it does not give u anything else which u don't get in other hukkah parlours
It might hurt ur pockets so plan on occasions
Ther service needs to be improved as they keep u waiting..
But yes its worth a visit once..

We visited this place for a non-alcoholic lunch. The ambience is more like a pub with a dance floor and live music stage and loud music playing round the clock. We were 4 people and ordered cocktail fish finger, salt and pepper prawn and pan fried chilli fish as starters. Serving time is on higher side. Food quality is impressive. In main course we ordered non-veg spaghetti in hot garlic sauce, grilled stuffed chicken and Thai red curry in chicken. These foods were served pretty quickly. Taste wise these were good but not awesome as the starters. It costed around 550 for each of us. If u want to hangout with friends in the evening time and grab some tasty finger foods along with drinks, this is the best option in the area. Only for food, you may visit this place also. But if u want best in class food for a specific cuisine, there are lot of better options available in the area within same price range.

My office hosted a party here and we had a great time. Nice ambience and very good service. Loved the hookah and the drinks too. The food we had was not up to the mark though, only the fish fingers were noteworthy. The Brownie with ice cream was probably the worst (both totally bland) and every dish was unnecessarily over spiced, even the pasta! Nevertheless the overall experience was good.

Pub like ambience..... lovely music. Good for a drink after office with friends and colleagues. So their location is spot-on, sector 5, above the newly opened pantaloons. I had visited the place with colleagues on a thursday afternoon for team lunch. Food was decent, we had opted for buffet. Spread was good with a mix of indian, chinese, continental salads etc. However, i felt this place is more suited for a chilled out drink along with some nice finger food. And yes the decor is good. PS. There is a small dance floor.

I visited this place a couple of weeks ago with my besties on a Saturday.
The place is a must visit as the ambience is good, it has got a medium size dance floor with neon light which adds to the attraction.
The food is good both veg and non-veg as we ordered both.
The place has got a separate open area for smokers.
And the price is affordable but a bit on the higher side.

Finally visited this much talked about place. To start with the ambience is amazing. The loud music and the well done interiors were quite impressive. We ordered for a Pan candy gum sheesha - it was amazing, all of us loved it thoroughly. For food we ordered for Paneer Lababdar Tikka - it was excellent. For drinks we ordered Long Island iced tea - one of best I have had till date. I am definitely looking foward to visit here again. However, since we had gone on a weekend, the service was slightly slow. 
All in all, I would rate it as follows - 
Ambience - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 5/5
Drinks and sheesha - 5/5

You enter this place and you are amazed with how big this place is. Irrespective of the large spread the place is very nicely done. The staff is good, and food is nice but usually comes very late. The crowd is not the best of the lot but not bad either. But when you goto a place what matters the most is music, music is exactly where this place kills it. 

Warm hospitality, this place is a must go.

Pour House is unarguably the best place to hangout in the salt Lake area. 
This place is huge and it got everything you might be looking for,  right from a swanky bar to an awesome open air smoking area. Feel free to dance at your table coz u got a lot of space, or head to the dance floor. Unlike a lot of other pubs, staff here was very courteous. 
I went there on a Friday night and would definitely recommend it to everyone.

The drinks are at a very fair price so they dont pinch your pocket
Music blows away the stress of the entire week as it gets higher and higher at every part of the night
We are in love with this place

Visited this place once. Frankly i thought it was over hyped. It's very dark inside. Interiors are not at all attractive..it is loud and a mix of different themes. Music is very loud and a very average playlist. Service is quite bad..we had to wait for the waiters to notice us and give us the menu. We had to walk up to a waiter and ask for water and cutlery. Food was ok but the mocktails were below average. Overall extremely disappointed and am never visiting again.

Pour house was a last minute decided plc we ended up for this Friday aftr wrk.
Was here wd my frnd to catch up on sm good music wd sheesha,beer and food..
Sec5,beside Rdb,abv Pantaloons,newly opened plc but has been d talk of d town fr a while and nw i knw y..
Ambience superb.
Choice of music was fantastic,
D waiters and management was extremely welcoming and warm.
The crowd was a mix of IT and colg and corporates..
But d best was d food,n sheesha..
Jad ordered fr a Indian chicken platter n salad and everything was cooked to perfection..
Pocket friendly. 
As we had 3 pints of beer,1 sheesha and d food.
All in all bill summed up to 1750rs dat was quite reasonable comparison to the quantity and quality of the good..

They also have a private section whch can b booked fr private parties,
And nt to forget I love their idea of open air smoking section which was simply done up..


Do visit this plc..worthed it.

I think some of the best places in Rajarhat area to hangout with buddies who love music and booze :p. Located on the 1st floor of the pantaloons bldg adjacent to RDB Boulevard in Sec V. I hopped in there on a saturday evening. They ve cover charges for couples @1500INR,  stags also are chargeable single girls be happy you go scott üÜì. 
Any ways just go thru the pics for a feel of the inside of the bar. Its has this western feel to it.  Yes they have a dance floor with all UV lights so get high and have a blast. Music is all EDM and latest tracks with a DJ playing them all. You can request songs for any one you like to. 
Food - We ordered the Quattro formaggio (thin crust pizza) which was just OK. Potato brocolli balls was just great though!! 
They have offers on drinks as well 1:1 but the prices are for 30ml of hard drinks so pl note. 
But I would recommend ppl to make a visit and bang it off!!

I visited this place last to last week with my friends,and I must say this is something new and unique.I personally adore this place because of the humongous space inside with a large bar compartment as well.This house has cozy seating and boasts of a lovely chic decor.It is not overdone.The service is immaculately polite and professional as well.I am rating this lounge mainly based on hookah.The hookah is really one of the best in town.Did try pasta once & it was really good.And the best thing I found was the kitkat shake.It was thick milky broth of pure chocolate and kitkat,perfectly sweet and refreshing.And ofcourse girls there's something for u all.The manager of Pour House is one of the cutest n sexiest guy of townüòâüòÄ.This lounge is more than a cafe or a bar or hookah parlour.This is awesome. üòçüòò

This seems to be one of the more popular lounges in this part of Salt Lake. I haven't been to a bar cum lounge before, so I found this place extremely dark on entering. But with the good music, it sort of elevates your mood before a drink.

We had a Cosmopolitan and a Pina Colada. The drinks were good. The colada was great actually. We also ordered some finger food with the drinks. First up was Chicken Corden Blue. Not the classic big chunk, but in 6 small pieces. It was great! Then was Fried Chicken Supreme, which were shaped like fish fingers. Again 6 pieces, and it was good but not excellent.

Sometimes the music can be too loud, and the lack of proper light might get irritating, especially while reading the menu. But overall a nice place. One advice though would be to expand the menu. More choices needed.

Went with a lot of expectations but it didn't turn out to be a fruitful experience. 
The starters were average types , a lot better are available at nearby outlets at much cheaper prices.
The cocktail was just okay.
The staff didn't respond whenever needed for.
With the type of service, the prices of alcohol is way too much. They will further add 27% wb vat on alcohol which is generally included in the menu price in all standard restro-pubs. 
Such a high charge for such service is not warranted and uncalled for. Not visiting again for sure

If u are organizing a party in the salt lake area, this should be in ur list of places to consider. 


Incredibly tasty food (they gave a mutton preparation which i was too high to remember the name of, but damn it tasted fantastic! And no one will give mutton with booze at a medium budget party.. its generally chicken kebab always), sprawling floor space, a pretty big dance floor, ear throbbing loud music, and very good service. Also, unlike many places (underground) where they would dilute the alcohol in a party to save some dirty bucks, this place delivers on promises. 


They have an open terrace also, and since we were a large enough crowd, about 30 people.. they gave us the entire terrace. Pretty nice of them.

Relatively new addition to sector 5, restro map, located on the 1st floor of the new pantaloons building. This lounge has got a proper dance floor with DJ setup. The space is quite big. Food they serve is quite toothsome. They serve a wide variety of drinks. However, they haven't got bar license for everyday of a week. So if you are going for a drink then make sure it's not a dry day for them. Hookah is also available. The bar counter is quite spread. Illumination is properly aligned with the vibrant young crowd here. They have got a nicely decorated open terrace part where you could lit cigarette. All together a proper place to party hard and groove to beats of the evening!

Conveniently placed near infinity in sector v,salt lake . A definite all rounder of a restaurant. This place has it all ,  namely a dance floor , a lounge area , private loungers, private party room and a huge place to unwind .Brilliant setup in a place like sec v. Now coming to the food , it was good but the proportions were less. None the less it was tasty. The footfall is quite good on fridays . So if you are looking for a place here,  do come early. Cheers to pourhouse!!!!

The place is not just another new addition to sector 5's growing list of spots. It has everything you would want for chilling on an end of the week evening. Located just above the Pantaloons outlet near RDB, the place is easy to find. The hookah this place offers lasts almost an hour without a coal change and is easy on your throat with its diverse mocktails. The food is pretty nice as it offers the traditionals as well as innovative dishes. I personally liked the paneer cordon blue a lot. The ambience is amazing, filled with nothing you wouldn't want to see (including dim lights, a selfie booth and neon painted walls). To add to the growing number of points, it offers an open area and also a dance floor with a dj that sure did make us shake our legs. And yes, the music is the best part! I am sure it's easy for anyone to become a regular here! - with Manisha Choudhary Akshat Agarwal Pikul Bidawatka

Been there on a Sunday Evening. 

Reading 4-5 star rating on zomato, paid Rs.1500 for cover charge. Stepping inside it left us wondering how come someone charge cover charge for this place on a Sunday evening.  The place was a chaos, looked more like a house party filled with strangers. Sitting arrangement was disappointing. 

The music sucks, it was not music it was simply a loud system. We sat there only for Rs.1500 we paid.

Ordered for pasta, it was below average and beer. Tax and service charge amount on the bill aggregated to 33% (inclusive of service charge @10%), which was like way too much for this place.
            
Not recommended for a nice evening at all.

The moment we were about to enter, I saw this board with 1:1 on Bacardi, Smirnoff and Teachers which instantly uplifted our moods :) So Friday 6 PM onwards, they had this offer. Not sure if they offer this always.

We had made a call for table reservation but they said there was no reservation by that name. We had to take a seat in the bar, which was good too but then a table conversation is what we needed. So I requested the manager and within minutes, we had a 6 seater for the three of us :) Impressive!

Table reservation is totally recommended for this place. Most tables were either occupied or reserved. I hope such reservation mistakes don't recur from their end.

The DJ was great. Right from playing smooth romantic Enrique numbers to kaala chasma, he played the right songs at the right time.

No complaints for the food too. Mozzarella cheese stick was the yummiest. Pizza and Mongolian noodles were delicious too.

Overall, a place worth visiting and then revisiting :) :)

The dining experience here was quite bad. The staff are quiet confused. You have to ask them to repeat everything and the service is very slow. The buffet experience was quite weird. We were having to ask for everything , which includes even refilling our glasses is water. The ambience is also very poor. The maintenance guys started working while people were having their lunch. That was out and out very disturbing. The management was very irresponsive towards whatever we were complaining about. Out and out a very very very poor experience. And would not recommend this place to anyone. This place is outright poor.

A recent favourite, this place has definitely become a weekly Friday evening haunt!
The first thing that hits you once you enter is the space. Seriously, this place is Huge! Such a welcome breather from the cramped crowded pubs we are so used to!
The drinks are decently priced and they regularly have offers which save you from the pocket pinch.
The cocktails taste pretty good.. highly recommend the Margarita and the Mojito! The chicken burger is pretty tasty too.
And if you are as bored as I am with the same old EDM playlist that every pub in our city plays, this place goes back to good Ol' bollywood tracks after 9 every friday! And the separate dance floor is a definite bonus!
Must visit place for all the techies in and around sector 5!

Visited the place on a Saturday night and was really disappointed. Music was too loud to even place a order. Service was worse and the quality of cocktails and food is horrible. The hype is all created by teenage crowd who go there for drinking beer and dance. Shimmers and backstage are better options. Even the owners are not ready accept criticism at this pub. Highly overpriced compared to the quality

My experience of pourhouse has been amazing. The ambience, the music and the service is great. I had the watermelon martini along with a non veg starter platter and a Thai fried chicken. The latter is a must try for meat lovers. The platter is a choice of four/five starters, I tried the chicken lollipop, reshmi kebabs. Thai fried chicken, chicken cheese nuggets all of which were really delicious. The lounge also serves hookah.

It has all the elements and extravaganzas which can make this place happening, just a little bit of proper management is required. The food was very good, specially the stuffed grilled chicken and cocktail fish finger. Chicken popcorn is a must try. This is a place which is good for finger foods, but not for main courses. The mojito and the LIIT was good. Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

Pour house is a great place to party. We booked the place for an office party on a Friday night. So they had dedicated a specific area for us only which was nice. The bartender was couteous and ¬†served us whatever drinks we ordered. The snacks which went with the drinks were lip-smacking. The chicken kabab, fish tikka and cheeseballs were brilliant. The hookah flavours they had there was also very nice.

After jamming on the dance floor, it was time for dinner. I tried their butter naan, dal makhani, peas pulao, mutton rogan josh, brownie and ice-cream. All were good especially the dal makhani.

One thing which I did not like about the ambience was that it was too dark. It was very difficult to see persons or objects at the darkest of places. At least some mild lighting should be there.

Overall, it was a brilliant experience and a perfect place to go to for booze and party.

Let's start with the positives : 
1. Courteous staff, they spoke politely and made you feel comfortable except this one bartender at the bar.
2. Good ambience, with TVs all around. So could catch a glimpse of the score at regular intervals.
3. Good service.
3. Music played by the DJ was decent.

Now the negatives : 
1. Little pricey
2. They don't have pitchers. They were ready to serve me sangria by the glass but couldn't give me a pitcher.
3. Since it was over crowded, getting a table took lot of time.
4. Happy hours for one on one was on, however I got this offer only when I was seated at the table. When I ordered drinks at the bar I was charged in full and the offer wasn't applied. I found this weird. If happy hours are on shouldn't it be applicable for all guests irrespective of whether they are seated in a table or standing by the bar ?
5. The bartender at the bar asked for my card at the time of ordering the drinks (before being seated). When he returned my card, it was broken. Luckily I had carried cash otherwise it would have been embarassing. I even told the manager the same, but no action was taken. The bartender should be more responsible with valuables such as debit/credit cards.

The most perfect place for partying . State of the art interiors .. Well equipped bar.. Some really amazing tracks played by the DJ.. The food tasted amazing .. Had opted for Mongolian Rice ... It had the perfect blend of spices and sauces . The Paneer Tikka tasted good .. The size of the Paneer cubes were pretty big and it was filling .. The quantity of the tandoori aloo was also good.. For the Shisha I would recommend teen paan candy . The drinks are also well priced . I would like to mention the Mr Saikat who was serving us was quick and served us with a smile even though the place was jam packed . Keep on serving with with smiles .. Way to go Pour House !!

Oh whatta fun place to be to!!Most importantly it was the day when Sindhu played for Gold. So you bet the importance!Pourhouse offers screens (big n small both) to enjoy your fav' matches.
Food: We went for Pan fried chilli fish,Jungli masala ka murg tikka.Both the finger food were awesome. Tender chicken cubes,tandoor was optimum.The pan fried chilli fish was spicy,tantalising and make you yearn for more.
Booze: Sadly no happy hours and extortionate prices.We went for Budweiser and Daiquiri.Daiquiri was well blend.
Aura: Astounding!!A catchy groovy mix of both English n' Hindi numbers are played.Mostly thronged by young IT crowd.A small dance floor is also present for a spin.
Synopsis: A must-go for all the party peeps.Throw away your stress shoes and chillax!!!The groovy music and good finger food would definitely drive you take out your dancing shoes for a spin.

Heard a lot about this new party place in IT township. Managed to be there on a saturday evening and i was just amazed by it. The decor, ambience, dim lights, loud music, foods, drinks everything is perfect for a booze party. It was pretty much crowded. we ordered thai fry chicken, pan fried chilli fish and cocktail fish finger along with drinks. All the items were very tasty. The staffs were very courteous  and service was awesome. But the price was little hig. Total bill amount was 2700/-. I will strongly recommend this place.

We went there yesterday afternoon for lunch after reading good reviews on zomato. We were group of 4 people and as soon as we entered we loved the ambience. The place was spacious and well decorated and had a dance floor too. One should go there in the evening to enjoy the ambience at tht foolest.
We ordered buffet (fully served on the table) and additionally some beers and cocktails. 
The food tasted good but the service was pathetic. The waiter serving us was not at all professional and even forgot what we ordered.¬† We waited and waited for a single item being served.
I we called up the manager and complained him about the pathetic service. He was curtious enough to apologise for the inconvenience and deployed a full time waiter only for us afterwards.
After that everything was just fine.
So if you want to have drinks and hookah and some pub food to accompany then you can visit the place but if you want a full fledged lunch then I would not recommend this place. 
And beware of the service.

Had it bookmarked for a long time to celebrate my b'day there .. but unfortunately they did not have a dj in the house then .. they have a dj only on wed, fri, sat, sun.

So this time we chose to visit it on a friday to watch the finals of PV Sindhu. Loved the whole experience. 

We ordered chicken corden blue, hardy balls, potato brocolli balls, chicken lababdar, and biryani combo. In mocltails a bar tender special and strawberry pouring moon. Every single platter ordered was cooked to perfection. 

And the dance floor and th DJ was rocking. Loved the neon lights. I will suggest wear something white here. Just one turn down they play hindi music only after 10 and wont change the rule even on request.Hope the next time you can mix it up a bit.

Went at 2 pm today with two friends. Nice ambience. Unprofessional behaviour : as we were two initially and waiting for one more friend, I ordered one buffet, they have asked TWICE that we can't share it. (THNKS but I am aware about it).

Later I realised that most of the staffs are not well trained. They missed couple of dishes in buffet despite several reminders. 

There menu was not available. It was a print out they gave.

Most of them seems confused.

This place was always in my wishlist ever since I have heard of this place and finally i dragged my husband to take me to this place and it is needless to say that it din‚Äôt disappoint me and my friends at all..We were pack of fifteen friends and each one of us came out with a smiling face as the food and ambience was just outstanding.Its located in Salt lake near RDB building .Its a must visit place for all the music lovers and long drive lovers.The music played inside is too good.The red and white bus  in the entrance  was the first selfie point for all the people.As soon as you enter, you would love the sight of changing lights and the paints all around would take you to US and UK tour.Its wonderfully made and well litted.

Being a hardcore lover of London city, first thing that admired me the most was the Wallpapers which had Big Ben and the menu card which was designed in the London station stops style‚Ä¶It was quiet unique and different‚Ä¶The neat bar, well litted dance floor with neon colour lights and lastly the Newyork prints on the wall just culdnt be overlooked.The entire house was based on UK and USA prints on its walls.This house has a private dance floor that can cater to around 100-150 people for a private party with a private section just for your guests.The music of the place is also excellent specially on the weekends!
Lastly, the washroom was also quiet vibrant-in the sense the wallpaints were quiet colourful and funky and worthy enough for a selfie‚Ä¶hahaha yeah selfie at the pee-point.

 
The place was quiet well crowded and the tables and chairs had all vibrant colours on them.Few tables had the UK flag imprinted on them while the corner  tables were in the  form of huge drums.


All the vegans, you just cant miss on the starters of this place.The potato brocolli balls is a must for brocolli lovers.Its cheesy  and crispy at the same time.

 
The Mozarella cheese sticks should also not be missed by the cheese lovers.We also ordered for hot pouring nachos which was sizzling and delicious.
 

Coming on to the main course, we ordered for Mix sauce pastas and the hakkah noodles which were both tongue licking.The portion was good enough for three to four person and the food was quiet adequately priced as well.

 
The mocktails menus surely ruled the entire food menu.The pouring kinky bubblegum was quiet fresh and soothing.It was sweet but very very cool coolant‚Ä¶.

We also ordered for kiwi blast which was yet another smooth drink for a kiwi fruit lover.With each drop of the drink, you would get the fresh pulp of kiwi to satisfy your bud .


When you are with so many friends and that too on a saturday night , you just can miss on having fun, right?‚Ä¶.we were told by the owner to order for these fusion mocktail shots served in test tubes and they were just mind-blowing.They were four flavoured shots which were tangy and tasty too.They were bubble gum flavour, orange punch , raspberry flavour and lastly kiwi pinch which were too good!

 
This place had sadly got no deserts to serve that day so we could‚Äônt order for any sweet dishes.

THis place is surely worth a try.Its bit far but it is a place that one should go with your favourite gang.

So hurry and plan your visit soon to this lighted house and have a great week ahead!

The worst and the most unprofessional venture I have ever encountered with. These people misguided us continuously for a week. Planned to host a dinner party for around 50 odd people and when we contacted them, they were eager to serve us. Even 3 days prior when we went to do a recce of the place they showed us around happily and assured us of the accommodation. But the very next day we were informed that they will not be able to host the party (mind it, we called to pay advance and thats when we got to know about this). Such severe unprofessional attitude and malpractices are not at all acceptable. Never ever am I going to visit this treacherous venture or refer anyone and will always discourage anyone who wants to visit this. BIG ZERO from my end.

Newest entry in Sector V, and probably the best. I couldn't find anything wrong at this place, food is amazing most of the beverages are prepared nicely. The interiors are something which has been done to perfection. On my three visits the place was almost full packed they could add few servers during rush hours and make the orders quicker. 
All in all a good place and a must visit. 
Cheers to the management.

We decided to visit the place on Sunday evening, being Sunday the place was averagely crowded, music and the ambience was good. Coming to drinks they had a good option to choose from, and food we just ordered make your own platter in which we selected tandoori aloo - below average, chilli cheese toast - good, fajeta- average, and paneer cordon - good, it was the only spicy food though staff was efficient and suggested us a good deal.

This is a new bar / lounge in town and it is really doing well. This is another place in Sector 5, which is coming up as the new hapening location in Kolkata
Its ambience is pretty cool and spacy, though the footfall is pretty high and gets crowded.
Table booking is a must.
Food options are plenty and the quality is ok
We had a veg platter, which gives a huge list of all the standalone items as well, from where i can pick any 4 of my choice, so this is one unique idea, where am not restricted to items in my platter.
Service needs to buck up a little but the with the amount of crowd its pretty difficult to manage.
Above all i had a nice time there.
Looking forward for more visits in future.

Location. Ambience. Decor. Perfect!!! Hookah was smooth and well-made. Food was okay. I wish the portion of vegetables served in the Paneer Lababdar platter was a little more. Pour House Special Mocktail was RockOn!!! One big complain: No desserts in the menu?!! The waiter at last managed to serve us brownie with ice-cream, but it should definitely have more options available! Also, though it is a lounge, and the music does play an important role, but it was too loud for us to barely talk or rather listen to each-other.

The place oozes electrified ambience and sets your mood just right ! Located at sector 5 and trending a lot these days. Go with your group and you will enjoy to the core.
The decor and neon lights are really attracting.
On weekends its crowded, food was satisfactory, they can improve on its quality, LIIT was not good, other places offer much better LIIT. 
The only suggestion, they can hire a better DJ with crazy songs on his list !

Went here on a weekday and they had just opened. So things were a little slow. We ordered for a Paneer Corden Blue and Audi rings along with a Basil Lime Cooler. First to arrive was the Paneer. The portion size looked good. It is served with a small salad portion and dip. It looked perfectly fried. As we took the first bite, we loved the crispness of the batter. It was amazing so was the flavour of paneer, cheese and herbs. I am not too fond of fried food but this is a must have any one who visits the place. Basil cooler was nice and chilled and the Basil was used generously. Very refreshing. Audi rings were average. 

We then ordered for a wild cat cooler which was nice too although I don't remember what flavour it is. Mongolian Platter was served hot and full of flavour although it was on the spicier side for my palate. 

We were disappointed with the lack of availability of desserts and ordered a Kit Kat shake. It was probably one of the best chocolate shakes I've had although the quantity could have been better.

Sector 5 has some good options now. :)

After hearing a lot about the ambience of this restaurant I finally went there yesterday.
First thing first- they don't serve alcohol on Tuesday!
Limited options in veg starters.
Coming to ambience- reminded me of the pubs in London. Awesome to hangout with friends after a stressful day at work.
I wanted hookah to be on sweeter side and not the usual teen paan or rasna. The waiter said he will combine few flavours and to trust him with it.
I didn't regret on that. It was a good flavour!.
In mocktail tried Italian smooch, and I loved it.
A must visit to pour house.
Will visit again for alcohol and to try non veg food there.
Happy Eating!

Pour House has came down pouring heavily. It has taken the city by amaze. You want to party like crazy, come down to Pour House. Your evening will be nothing less than rocking. One of the best pubs in town, excellent dj, an unconventional huge open smoking place and a strategically placed dance floor. You want to dance, but you feel shy, no worries, Pour House has made it easier. Located at the corner, you can dance as if no one is seeing you. The dj has an excellent taste of music. It gets too difficult to sit and enjoy. Your feet start tapping, your hips starts shaking...the music is so addictive.
Only a small piece of suggestion, please provide the details of the cocktails in the menu. Everyone is not so conversant with the preparation and in such noisy ambience, it gets even more diffcult to communicate. Apart from these, every other thing is perfect. The dim lights, the large spread out are, the variety of seating options available is perfect for a happening evening.
I will always recommend this place for partying. I am not commenting about food because i hardly tasted. The ambience and the muci made me busy with other options. But the food is ok, nothing to complain. The open smokjng area and ita vast size with chairs to sit and chit chat is the one of the USP apart from the DJ and the spread out area.
Well, places like pour house, hoppipola has changed the meaning the partying and hope the numbers will keep on increasing....!!

Well for being first time visitor in a disc i was quite thrill and excited and after being in to the house i was pretty pumped up, it was loud ,ambiance was cool and jazzy , Thanks to one of my friend who is a regular in the house Anusua Mukherjee  

Crowd was zeppy and zestful the floor was utter electrify , Music was hard rock with desi tarka. the DJ was superbly awesome .

Now lets talk about the booze we started with few shots and mocktail and few buds . 

over all it is one of the best and as being for the first time in a disc i would say its a trendy and most happing place in town #Kolkata #Nightlife. what could have been more fun spending #friendshipday at #pourhouse for celebration .last but not the least sitting with Luna Chatterjee  who is a food blogger , reviewer and critics was an awesome Experience and who happens to be a Good Friend.

A place to give a good competition to the Salt Lake giant, Backstage. Prashant's doing a good job with his PR and management. The bar's got license for three - four days only, if i'm not wrong.¬†
Wonderful outside sitting area. Ambiance is good. Food was good. I somehow, did'nt like the fluorescent floor. Makes the whole ambiance go for a toss.¬†
And management if you're reading this, please do something about CROWD CONTROL.

Waited 20-25 minutes for a table even though there were empty ones. The waiters were confused. Each one was leading us to a different table. Food was good but the service was poor. We had to literally shout our hearts out for them to hear us as the music was too loud and the waiters never stopped to see if we needed anything. Besides that, its a nice place. Great music. Separate area for dance. Great seating arrangements and amazing lighting.. Rates for food and drinks were reasonable.

This is a place to party. I went here on Friendship day and my, the place was alive like anything. Absolutely stunning music. Swank dance floor. Huge bar. And a very precarious toilet signs. Check out my photos to find out. 
Coming to the food, it was very good. They'd mustard onion rings as condiments with the starters. Love them. For the starters, we had tandoori aloo, crispy chilly baby corn, kebabs and nachos. I didn't like the kebabs, it had too much almonds. The rest of the starters were amazing. 
Great time we had, thanks to Pour House.

We ordered lasagna, Pasta and few drinks . Food was amazing . Serving time is less , only drawback is seating arrangements, the stools and tables are not comfortable and very less in numbers. Overall my experience is good .

We went here on a weekday, but they were hosting a private party of about 300 heads, so it was a pandemonium. We ordered for a regular hookah and a mushroom risotto.

The hookah was good, and lasted us the 1 hour plus that we were there.

The mushroom risotto was not the authentic type- was actually an Indian-ized variant- spicy, and servers with tandoori sauteed vegetables on skewers. We didn't really mind the taste, so went ahead without complaining. 

There were a number of items on the Menu that they said they can't serve as it's not in stock. Surprisingly, one of them was Jacket Potatoes, due to which they denied serving the Mexican platter.

My rating
Ambience: 7/10
Food: 5/10
Value for money: 6/10

A veryy trending pub .. In the heart of sector 5.. On the 1st floor.
Very trendy.. You actually open the door to a beautifully decorated pub... English interiors . The walls, seating are different from the regular.  Also the waiters name flashing was a different concept.  And the music is good and really loud.  

Coming to the food I tried tandoori aloo.. Well grilled.. But I wanted a more peppier dip with it... So missed a little on this ..

Paneer cordon blue was a recommendation and yummmyyy... Loved it.. Crisp from outside.  And cheese melting inside....

However what I didnt like was that he served both the items together ...
Next visit expecting better.. :)
Its 2500 for 2 with drinks and hookah.

I went to Pour House yesterday evening. This visit was much awaited after all the good things I had heard about this place. And believe me I found it even better than what I had heard.

This is my idea of a complete package. Yummilicious food, superb interiors, foot tapping music, the way they have played with lighting, creativity, presentation, the staff uniforms, the variety of liqour, staff courtesy, taking feedback eagerly; everything was just adding to the persona of the lounge.

Immense attention has been paid to minute detailing. Seating is ample, they have a longish bar, a room for private parties, a selfie booth and a neon area for the dance floor well decorated with a neon graffiti wall on one end.

We ordered
Tandoori Bharwan Aloo
Assorted Bruschetta

Tandoori paneer pizza
Green Thai Curry platter
Paneer Lababdar platter

Beers
Shisha

Food was really tasty. I was impressed by the texture of the veggies in the thai green curry. It was just perfect. The wooden platters used for serving get full marks too.

The Tandoori Bharwan Aloo was really well char grilled and well marinated as well.

Assorted Bruschetta was placed in a longish platter. There were three variations. All were appetizing and the base had the perfect crunch.

The pizza had a great twist flavour wise, a must try.

The shishas are smooth and well made.
I am a fan after my first visit. Will check for consistency and even a higher level of innovation on my next visit.

A place with a great ambience. The food quality was good. Hookha is not up to the mark. If you are visiting this place for hookha, you must not go. But the food is good. We tried some drinks that was also a bit disappointment. The best part was the music being played there. We just sat another half n hour because the music was so good .

Yet another shady hookah place in Calcutta..
It could have been made so much better. Ambience and sitting arrangements inside is very dissapointing. Outside could have been well utilised in rains as well but they didn't put plastic sheets. 
Coming to food. How can lemon slices have hair on it?
Food tastes below average. Didn't try shisha so can't review that.

Pour House is currently like a split personality - there are days when it serves alcohol and then days when it does not. Wednesday, Friday - Saturday are the days to remember if you plan to visit this place for drinks. Located above pantaloons in sector 5 near RDB and hence very easy to locate. Guess it is waiting for a permanent alcohol license and hence the place and the ambience turns out to be disappointment on days when alcohol is not on offer. Otherwise the ambience and the music would really compliment your drink. Food is not bad. Service was good but the staff could have been much more educated on the menu and the food especially the mocktails. Would want to visit this place when alcohol is on offer and avoid on other days!

Staff was helpful n service was also good.. Hukaah n Bar at one place so definitely vl attract d young guns.. Many options for Veggies.. V tried many from Broccoli cheese ball, paneer cheese starter, n cheese Nachos.. Mocktails n cocktails had many options.. One can also try test tube shots.. In main course pastas n noodles were nice bt were disappointed as v didn't find Pizza in d menu n even no Desserts.. So vl ask d management to add it n nxt time vl try d Combos which looked yummy.. Ys it's a costly outin wid approx 1k per person.. Bt wid d dancing flor n even separate area for grps who wana njy among themselves it adds to the whole atmosphere.. N Ys 1 more thin d sound system was nt upto d mark as it was cracking lik anything.. One must try dis place n spcly if u hav a huge grp to rock n roll.. Hi

I have tried The Grey Goose its a new thing and I loved it. The best part is it has free Wifi, parking, smoking zone and you can also watch live sports on TV. Place is neat and well maintained.

The desserts here looked spectacular and the taste matched up the expectation created by the look of them. My favourite was the Chocolate Mud Pie with Vanilla Ice-cream, where the salty, toasty base, the fudgy chocolate filling and the creamy scoop of ice-cream created a party in my mouth! The Red Velvet Cake looked brilliant but the frosting was a bit too sugary for my liking. The Rum Chocolate Slice had a good hit of alcohol and is a good option for dark chocolate lovers. And the Mousse-y Dessert in a Jar, with clean layers of chocolate-y components is the perfect thing dig into, any day, any time.

Having heard so much about the city's latest Heartthrob, I just had to visit POUR HOUSE and I wasn't disappointed.

Located right beside RDB Boulevard on the first floor of the new Pantaloons building, the entry itself intrigues you to what could be in store inside. The red and white Pour House bus extrusion with headlights is a perfect photo spot by the way. Once inside, the ambience gives you a sports lounge feel, only bigger and minus the excessive television sets. Even the servers have digital name tags! Cool or what!üòâ

My friend and I were not too keen on heavy eating so we stuck the entr√©e and relished till the last morsel! Would recommend trying the Hardy Balls from the Chef's special. Please don't go by the name (I know it's hilarious) but the idea of smoked Chicken Tikkas wrapped in a thin crust and deep fried, served with Tarter Sauce and Salad is indeed what food porn is made up of!üòâ
Also DON'T give the Chicken Cordon Blue a miss. The oozing cheese with generous portion of crusted chicken is a sure shot hit!

Pour House unfortunately has a temporary liquor licence so alcohol is available only on Wednesdays (for Ladies Night) and Weekends, so those wanting to go that road think again.

Although the mocktails weren't that bad. We tried their special "Love At Pour House" - Orange, Mint, Strawberry Crush and Lime Juice - and honestly, I would have preferred my drink with a less of the strawberry crush.

Pour House has Hookah too and we tried something called Hushed up. How is it different? Well the name itself justifies the hookah being served to you- Only the hookah maker knows the flavours being mixed to conjure the same; not even the server,let alone you.

Pricing is a bit steep for my liking but I would still recommend this place for the good food and excellent service.

Pour House has been the best experience in recent times. Period. This is not only in terms of the food, but also the ambience that the place has succeeded in owning. It is a restaurant and a pub, all at once and does complete justice to both these aspect wonderfully. The sight of the neon lighted dance floor itself is enough to lighten the mood and urge you to edge towards it. We did too, right after we went bonkers with the first course.

Location and ambience:

Pour house is nestled on the first floor of the building right opposite to RDB and is fairly easy to spot. Hence, reaching this great establishment should not be an issue at all. The moment you step into the place, you are greeted with beautiful leather quilted doors, that open up to this magnum area that has been tastefully decked up with beautiful couches, high rise tables and tool tops. The bar on the right is neatly decorated and is sure to attract a lot of attention, especially during the great 1:1 offers that are going on right now.

The Food:

Like a number of other religion stricken friends I too have days (one day precisely), where I succumb to parking myself on the herbivorous side of the yard. This sadly was one of those days. While my fellow friends and foodies gorged on some of the most wildly tempting chicken, fish and prawn kebabs, I had to settle for paneer. But, the food was a complete surprise.

Appetizers-

The veg dishes on the table included-
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Paneer Cordon Blue,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Audi Ring,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Corn Salt & Pepper and
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†The basil Paneer tikka.

The lightly crusted paneer Cordon Blue has this fascinating crust on the outside, teamed with the oozy cheese on the inside. The Audi rings are basically cheese stuffed onion rings and are a great hit with the bar hitting crowd. I then moved onto the Corn Salt and Pepper. This was one of the best dishes on the table, without a doubt. The dish is made out of crispy fried American sweet corn kernels, which have then been tossed in some lovely assortment of onions, peppers and sauces. Easy on the ear, but exceptionally hard to make. The best part of the first course was without a doubt, the basil paneer tikka, soft and melt in the mouth. I could go back again just for another bite of this.

The first course was well supported by a wide assortment of wonderful mocktails. They were-
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†The pouring wild cat cooler,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†The Pouring Strawberry moon,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†The Virgin Orange Mojito,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Love in Pour house, and finally the king of all the mocktails,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Pouring Basil Lime cooler.
I had two serving of the last mocktail alone.

Main course-

For the main course, the table was yet again bombarded with a mountainous amount of food. Right from Rissoto to Green Thai Curry and the Paneer Lababdaar platter to the Mutton masala platter, nothing was missed. I settled for tasting the Veg Rissoto, the Veg Thai Green Curry and the Paneer Lababdar. Mind you these are all platters and hence are good enough to serve two.

The risotto is cheesy, yet well balanced. The thai curry has the perfect harmony of flavours and is not overpowered with coconut milk, which is the case in most other places around the city. The paneer lababdar platter is served with a wonderful masala kulcha, which according to me is a must try, not only for the vegetarians, but also carnivores like me.

Desserts-

The best part of the meal according to me, were the desserts. If you though a pub only concentrated on their appetizers and their booze, Pour House proves you wrong and how. We settled for the-
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Hot chocolate mud pie with ice cream,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Red velvet cake,
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†Fusion mousse, and
‚Ä¢¬†¬† ¬†The Flavour Mousse cake.

The desserts are fresh and delicious. They bring a killer end to an absolutely beautiful meal.

When coming into Pour House, you are sure to leave with a beautiful series of pics, a very satisfied tummy and an exceptionally happy face. A total thumbs up to the food, the service and the all over ambience that the place boasts. Will be definitely dropping by soon again.

Finally visited this place, thanks to a friend for asking me out. This place is definitely the new buzz in town and now i know why! Spacious place with beautiful interiors, lots of couches, bar stools and a dance floor! Loud music with peppy tracks really made me go crazy. 
Servers are good, honest but on a weekend service was a bit slow(quite obvious).
Loved each and every item we ordered. We started with pan fried fish watermelon martini and budweiser, we took kiwi salsa flavored hush ( they have kept hookah with that name) too. Started of well with melt in mouth basa fish and eastern flavors.
Next we ordered supreme fried chicken, chicken wings and an indian chicken starter (some sort of kebab). Chicken wings coating became a bit hard with time but the flavors in all the dishes were at par. None of it disappointed us, the guy who served us was very polite and asked us every time feedback for the dish. 
In cocktails we took carribean cruise, trash can, singapore sling, long island beach tea we also got black dog whiskey and B52 shots. Trash can and singapore sling is a must try here! In mocktail a friend took Basil lime cooler suggested by a foodie friend it was the best mocktail ever tasted in terms of flavor and presentation. 
Over all experience was very good. And definitely coming back here for more nightlife and amazing drinks! A bit pricey but its justified, the outdoors was very classy too.

Here's the new kid of the block and undisputedly touted as the next big thing in the salt lake arena , this new pub has made a lot of noise and grabbed a lot of attention . Situated at the most happening place of sector 5 , amongst the big guns like BBQ, chai break  this pub has the option for the it people to unwind themselves after a grueling day at work . Had a bad week ? Just get out early in the evening the enjoy the Friday night by letting yourself loose on the dance floor after grabbing a couple of drink . Booze are served in weekends but they will be soon served everyday and then Friday nights will have another hot destination.  

¬∞ Location :- Located at the 1st floor of the new pantaloons building.  This building is located just beside the RDB boulevard . They have valet and free parking . So, just get out of the car and have a branch .

¬∞ Ambience :- This is the part that has impressed me the most . It has a got a huge floor space , the seatings are a cross between US and UK styled decorations . You will absolutely love their bar area . It's huge and the seatings are perfect I.e on high tables. Once you will look at it you will feel like having a seat with your buddies and grab a drink . The walls are beautifully decorated with neon lights . They play these songs which are sung by YouTube artists in the projector and really the mood lifts . If you are planning a party night out this has to be the hottest place in the silicon valley of Kolkata .

¬∞ Food :- Now comes the test of their mettle . With all the glitz and glamour there comes the responsibility of getting good marks in a very important department and that is the food . We basically went there in lunch hours . We were neither looking for hookah or a drink . Rather we had a movie to catch so we hopped in for a quick lunch . We had the following :- 

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Cocktail Fish Finger ( 3 / 5 ) :- Not the best if starters . The presentation is good , similar to the presentation in scoop . There are 6 pieces . But , the first problem was that there were not enough fish . Secondly because of the basa it tastes ordinarily . A better suggestion would be to cut the quantity and go for vetki . The old monk flavor was just in the name , they were more like batter fried . Anyways, not that bad too but I was expecting a lot because of the hefty price .

2. Stuffed grilled chicken ( 5 / 5 ) :- The best grilled chicken I have ever had . Generally I donot vote a 5, but for this I had too. They took almost 20 minutes to serve and boy it was worth the wait . 2 big breast portions with stuffed herbs cooked in white sauce and bell peppers  and also served with white sauce. The mashed potato and grilled veggies were perfect and complimented the dish well . We ended up almost licking every portion of the dish . It's a huge hit for us .

----------------------------------------------------------------

Although we were not here for the best part of the place , the ambience was enough for us to let us plan to come here again with a bigger group and the hope of creating a lot of noise .

The following points are to be noted :- 

1. Pub with lot of bang located the the busiest part of sector 5.

2. Excellent ambience .

3. Good food.  

4. Hookah available  , free Wi-Fi .


Will come back surely with either the office colleagues or the friends group and I m sure everyone will have a gala time .

Pour House is a wonderful gift came in a gr8 package for Kolkata... I'm requesting you to give it a try... it's so spacious... that you will never feel suffocated with all the smokes coming from the Hookahs, sorry they said it Hush... also the seating arrangements are so well planned that you can enjoy your private space without get disturbed by others... The awesome music will surely attract you towards the dance floor... and the eye catching bar will help you order some drinks too... ha ha ha... there bar didn't started in full-fledged till now... but they will hit it soon...

O boy... what can I say in service... it was fantastic... Saikat was doing it wonderfully... also the tiny LED batches flashing the name of each servers was an awesome addition to the ambience...

Yes... the ambience is just Fatafati...

We tried there "Kiwi Spring Water" flavor form there Hush section and it was amazing...

So we started with some mocktails... I'm not going to describe all the mocktails... only because each and everyone of it was stunning, refreshing and have an unique taste of there own... go for anyone of it...

#Mocktails#
‚ô° Watermelon bom¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
‚ô° Pouring wild cat cooler¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
‚ô° Pouring strawberry moon¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°
‚ô° Pouring basil lime cooler¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
‚ô° Pouring dark inverter¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°
‚ô° Love in pour house¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°‚ô°
‚ô° Virgin Orange mojito¬ª¬ª¬ª ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°

So you can understand na how was the mocktails??? Ok, now moving towards the food...

#Starter#
Veg:-
‚ô° Paneer corton blue¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent...
‚òÖ Audi ring¬ª¬ª¬ª Good...
‚ô° Corn peeper and salt¬ª¬ª¬ª Perfectly done... right proportion of salt and pepper was used and it tasted heavenly...
‚ô°‚ô° Basil paneer tikka¬ª¬ª¬ª Mind blowing presentation... a must try... Excellent in taste...

Non veg:-
‚ô° Wing's broadway¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good...
‚ô° Janglee masala ka murgh tikka¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome...
‚ô°‚ô° Bhuna jeera ka mahi tikka¬ª¬ª¬ª It was just mind blowing... perfect blend of spices... and the fish was melting in the mouth...
‚ô° Cocktail fish finger¬ª¬ª¬ª Again very tasty...
‚ô° Thai fry chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome...
‚òÖ Pan fried chilli fish¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish...
‚òÖ Hardy's balls¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... but can be improved as far taste is concerned...
‚ô° Mutton sheekh kabab¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent...
‚ô° Lasuni jhinga¬ª¬ª¬ª Quite good...

After having so many starters... we were not able to have any more dishes... but some of our fellow foodies still have some craving for main course.... so we had to move on...

#Main Course#
Veg:-
‚ô° Paneer lababdar platter¬ª¬ª¬ª Came with a bowl of dal makhani, one bowl of paneer lababdar and two butter nans... Excellent in taste...
‚ô° Thai green curry¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome... a must try for green curry lovers...
‚ô° Risotto¬ª¬ª¬ª What a presentation... tasted as good as it looks...

Non veg:-
‚ô° Mutton masala platter¬ª¬ª¬ª The combination was same like paneer lababdar, only it consists of mutton masala and kulcha... the mutton was soft and tasty gone well with kulcha...

#Desserts#
‚ô° Hot chocolate Mudpie with vanilla ice cream¬ª¬ª¬ª Superb...
‚ô° Red velvet cake¬ª¬ª¬ª Just perfect...
‚ô° Fusion mousse¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome...
‚ô° Chocolate truffle cake¬ª¬ª¬ª It was so chocolatey...

So ultimately we end and there was not a single space left in my tummy... but I fallen in love with the place... Will visit there again...

Wish best if luck to the whole team of "The Pour House"...

The name gives you the idea that this is THE¬†place to be to quench your thirst. Thirst to drink some really innovative mocktails, cocktails with beers and vodkas thrown in between!. This one month old pub is making all the right noises in the IT hub. Situated in Sector 5, beside RDB Cinemas.To be more specific this is on the first floor of the Pantaloons outlet that has opened in sector 5.

The name is catchy enough for you to hop in. The interiors are fancy, dimly lit and gives you an international level pub feel as soon as you step in. A place you can be comfortable enough to be JUST YOURSELF !!!
Food : They have loads of variety with both veg and non veg options. The "paneer cordon blue" is a must try. The serve the best "dal makhani", believe me, just like zaranj.. And the other items are good too. 
Drinks : Wed, sat and sunday, with happy hours around, you are sure to Live it up! The music they play will surely groove you! Best collection of songs..üëåüèªi mean it!
What attracts most here, is the happy vibes you get.. And the hospitality you receive! 
Surely a place, kolkata needed!üò¨

This is the newest place in sector 5 that's gaining all the attention these days. Fusion restro-bar with american and british fusion interiors is astounding. The place is huge with ample number of seatings. They have a separate area for private parties and an open area too. Live DJ and a dance floor for the jig freaks.  I went on a no liquor day so could not try their cocktails. But the art in mocktails was extravagant. Shisha was good too. For starters we tried paneer cordon blue and Audi rings. Crisp and evenly cooked. Paneer tikka was great too. We tried their food combos. Paneer lababdar combo, serving indian bread with paneer and dal makhani, dal makhani was great. Thai green combo, serving rice and Thai curry with kimchi salad. I do not prefer Thai food much but this one was amazing. They had some desserts for the day, chocolate mudpie, chocolate mousse layered in a mason jar and a slice of red velvet cake. Simply sinful. Service was prompt. The team has put up a great show of hospitality. Highly recommended.

Recently been there and this restaurant located at most happening place in Sec V...it is just one floor up of newly Opened Pantaloons Showroom. The building name is Megatherm.
Yes the entry is quite interesting as you have to cross to two boundaries to enter the restaurant. The out side decoration is too good followed by LED Logo Projector... Protected the restaurant logo on Ground.. Inside is quite interesting and spacious..different different sitting arrangements are done and all are quite comfortable. Music is too good and reflected from Giants screens and Projectors.
Let's come to the main part..that is food..Yes it is good and tasty. We have ordered Chilly Chicken and Junglee Murgh Tikka...Yes both satisfied our taste buds.. Presentation is too good also though service can be done more faster.
Now come to the Biling part... Here we are not at all satisfied as there is an additional 10% service tax was imposed on total Bill amount..I dnt know the reason..also waiter informed if we served liquor then it will be 27 %.. OMG
This is very pathetic they can't impose these extra charges on the food bill. I dnt know how others take this matter but a BIG NO from my side if I am planning to arrange a big party or team gather. As I have found no answer on that additional part of expense.

The most happening place in sector 5 these days!! Went here soon after it's grand opening. Loved the american-london fusion ambiance, the awesome music, and the groovy dance floor.

Talking about the food, I had dropped in for a quick bite with friends. I had the cocktail fish finger, jangle masala ka murgh tikka. Both were delicious and fresh. The chicken and fish were well marinated and throughly infused with flavours. The flavours were strong but not overbearing. I also had mutton masala platter. Love their concept of main courses in the form of platters/thalis. A complete meal with roti, some salad and a good portion of mutton. I'm giving them a 4.5 for their diversity in cuisine.

Hope to try their hookas soon. Service was amazing. Cheers team Pour House!!

Located conveniently above the Pantaloons near Infinity Tower in Sector 5, the place does have a feel good vibe.

Small details such as the trippy entrance where you get confused for a second due to the Kaleidoscopic reflections add to the fun factor. Drinks and music (Even cocktails are great). The Mozzerella Cheese Sticks were cheese-licious. The Veg-Kung-Pao was good, but not extraordinary. The burgers are really well made but are not so unexpectedly difficult to eat and pass across the table when tipsy.

Why would you want to go to Pour House? ¬†

Great Music. (They also play Hindi/Punjabi music as the night falls and all of us love that sort of music  while we may be afraid to admit so) ¬†
¬†Biig Dance floor. Good drinks. Decent Food.¬†

Reasons why you might not want to go-

Music can be too loud as there are blaring speakers everywhere. Some of the tables are inconvenient to sit.¬†
Waiters can be inattentive due to the loud music. You might end up burning holes in your pocket.

One of the bigger turn offs here is the sexism on the Bathroom doors when the Men's bathroom has a beer bottle and the women's washroom has a wine glass. Now come on- you cant tell a lady or a man ¬†what to drink!¬†
But by the end, you might just be too high to care about anything or everything. So give this place a shot for a group binge.

I would say over hyped place!! Not so good food, Not so good service, Not so good staff, we were 11 and did billing somewhere around 8k it's not worth, Over priced beverages ..the only good thing in the place was music..Cheers to DJ. I believe this place will not survive for long untill and unless they revamped the menu, staff and chefs.

Nearby: One Sports Lounge will manage to pull more crowd after they get the liquor license soon same with 10 Downing Street.

The Place is highly priced and lacks cordial waiters. 6 of us had gone and had ordered for around 2500, hoping to spend a lovely evening with my friends. Unfortunately, Pour House isn't a place as such. We ordered for 5 smirn offs, but they delayed to get 1 and got us only 4 smirn offs. We cancelled our 5th order. We wanted to go to the dance floor and so asked a waiter to shift our Hukkah to that place.  He refused. We again took a chance and the other waiter agreed. He then brought us a bill of ‚Çπ2700, including 5 smirn offs. On putting our point that we only consumed 4, he started shouting and refused to listen. The waiter's name was LINKAN. He fought with us at the dance floor and refused to listen to anything. This is what Pour House is doing. Cheating their customers and practicing unethical measures to deal with their customers. Ultimately, we had to pay the entire amount, we paid for something we didnt consume. 
I hope someone takes action otherwise I am going to take this issue to all social media platforms and tell everyone about my pathetic experience.

I had seen this poster  Pour House "opening soon" a number of times whenever I was near RDB ,and last Friday we finally  visited this newly opened lounge.It was an absolute delight to visit such a wonderful lounge in sec v area.It is huge in terms of space.When we visited the place there were three private parties going on and still it never felt crowded.To add to that,it has got live sports screening and open air smoking zone.And much to my surprise,we found our favourite  Saikat working there,who took really good care of us!! We ordered beer,Mojito,singapore sling,watermelon martini,potato wedges,chilli chicken etc.The food quality was good,Mojito was really really good.Apart from that,the dancing area had a really nice decor and  LED lights.DJ could have been better I guess. Nevertheless,we enjoyed a lot and will be visiting again pretty soon!!!

Newly opened lounge-pub just beside the Rdb boulevard building sec 5. 

Ambiance is grt so is the decor. Hookah was standard. Drinks are nice. Virgin Mojito was one of finest i tasted. Didnt order food mayb will do next time.
But the music played out was all bolly flicks which doesnt go well the kind of setup of the pub they have put out. Play some country-pop, EDM, club-house along with bolly hits would have done just fine. Earnest suggestion to them if they are reading this. 

Sport screening is big bonus !

Right opposite to RDB,makes it easier to locate.
Fancy interiors and really spacious place.
Really liked the concept of this caf√©.
Collection of music is catchy.
Tried their signature starter
Basil Paneer - Paneer was hell soft and succulent and the basil sauce was just perfect. The baked cheese on top twisted the taste and made it all the more lip smacking.
I visited this place twice or thrice and that's because I was really impressed with my first visit.
However,the second time I was really disappointed. Before visiting the place had made a call for the booking and I was told that they don't need booking for two people. And when I reached the venue,I was asked to occupy either the bar section or just a Casual Sorry.
Again I made a visit ignoring what happened and yet again I was treated in a similar way.
We occupied one sitting area and there was no label of freezed or reserved tag. So we sat there and was waiting for the waiter to approach us. We called for them around thrice and then they had come and that too without the menu and all they said us was this section is reserved for this that people and u guys have to leave before this time. I got really agitated looking at the way they approached us. Still,I told them politely that we gonna leave the place by that time. And when we were done with the food l, we asked them to get the bill and I was so angry with them seeing they way they handed over the bill in our hands rather than getting it in proper way. They were in so hurry for us to leave the place. Felt so unwanted at that time.
Management should definitely pay attention to it. They should treat their customers with attention and a lil more focus even if they are two in number.

Located in sector 5. Variety of sitting arrangements available. Ambience and decor were amazing. Music keeps you grooming. Parking also available. The LED name tag on the staffs looked different and nice. Food was delicious and presentations were good. Quantity and quality both were good. Pocket pinch is not friendly. Service was very poor, in pour house. I had told one thing to every staff, but still they they didn't respond. Food they served, after 45 min, I gave the order. We had ordered for Tandoor bawari potatoes, Audi rings, Pouring Nachos, and cocktail with mocktail too. Shisha was also good, long lasting. Only because of the service the rating went down, that need to improve.

Beyond expectations. The place has got good energy , music keeps you grooving all the time, the food is decent , staff is courteous . The LED name tag badges on the staff looked different and nice . Also valet Parking is available adding to the convenience of the visit.

Went there is Friday for the very first time after work, well, we were 16 of us. So yeah, definitely reserve your table if you have a huge bunch coming in. I totally loved their decor and ambience. The DJ wasn't that great on that day so a little bad on the music but the food and drinks compensated for everything. We ordered pitchers of beer and L.I.T and sangrias , mixed sauce pasta, hardy ball chef's special which is basically crumbed chicken tikka balls and cocktail fish finger which is old monk flavoured in fish which was amazing. And vegetarians naturally went with crispy chili babycorn :3
The hookah wasn't that great but it didn't matter. We were a huge group and ordered almost anything we could so the bill amount didn't surprise us. The per person charge was pretty good so it didn't really burn a hole in our pockets.
And even if it did, we didn't care cause that was our pay day. :)
All in all, a great place.

I have been waiting to reach this place for a long time and finally it happened..Firstly amazing ambience and decor.Owners have done a wonderful job in designing this place with such a huge dance floor..Music perfect along with the food..Only issue is with the price as you cannot charge so much as we are not in a club..They should be review it once or introduce some other offers maybe happy hour concept!!

Went here last night. Was too excited to visit this place. As expected the ambience is good but the music is too loud,this may be because they have a dance floor too. If one is planning to come here with friends and have chit chat with a bottle of beer then they would find it very difficult to talk. Couldn't even hear my own voice.
Coming to food . It was delicious and presentation was also good.
If the volume of music is taken care of everything will be perfect.

One of the worst places visited... Poor service and pathetic food... It is Poor House.... Will never visit & recommend to anyone... The manager was disrespectful and waiters did not bother to listen.. Took 30 mins for starters to come... Poor House... On top of that charged Rs. 1000 as service charge... Dacoits on house...

Horrible place with weird staff. I called up in the morning to know about the happy hours. They asked me to come at 7. When we were there , they never informed us that the happy hours were only for ladies. After the orders were placed , they told us about the same. That's horrible. This is sheer stupidity. Never recommending it to anyone.

Newly opened place in sector 5, this is just amazing. Surpasses the coolness level of its so many competitors in 1km radius. D√©cor 5/5, food taste 5/5, menu 5/5 music 5/5, hospitality 4/5, value for money 4/5.. Do go for pour house special mocktail in which they gv u 16 test tubes shots of 4 different flavor. Bad that they don't have alcohol shots like that. Bar is loong. Huge sitting space. Give it a shot techies.

A great place for you to hangout with your friends.
Coming to the ambiance, they have the interiors beautifully decorated as if you are in London or New York.
A dance floor and DJ is ready for all the dance lovers during the evening hours.
They have got a really nice bar section for all those who love mocktails.
A perfect party area!!!!
I came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends and we really enjoyed being here.
i could have given it 5 Stars but I'm not giving coz i did not find the food upto the mark.
A Must Try: THE POUR HOUSE SPECIAL mocktail which was tooo gooood. they serve u this in 16 test tubes comprising of four different flavors and you're gonna love them.
Since the place is new so u might not find much crowd but you're surely gonna enjoy.
Hope to visit this place again!

Sector 5 have been a region which provided Kolkata with one of the finest places where¬†one can go for their eateries and chill outs. And with the addition and Launch of Pour¬†House on 17th June Salt Lake is going to be one of the most wanted place in near¬†future. Talking about the Pour House so this place is what you call a place for Fun¬†Friends and Food. A with the cherry on the cake they have got a big Bar section for¬†all those Mocktails and Cocktails Lovers.
                                                                ...

Entertainment !! Entertainment !! & Entertainment ...  That's all I can summarize POUR HOUSE quoting the famous dialogue. And believe me guys I am not kidding at all. 

##Location:
An all new place located at the busiest part of the city at sector v Saltlake. It's on the 1st floor of Megathem towers just beside the RDB building. Easy to find.

##Ambiance & Decor:
London dreams and New York times.. Wow what a combination and this killer combination has been brought alive in Kolkata by this place. Having quite a long bar station inside , projectors all around with DJ station and dance floor this place sets up your mood for party and will loose your stress just at a quick succession. Wow.. Impressive.. 

##Food &Drinks:
Well with their lively ambiance and decor it set my expectations bar high for food and drinks as well and I am happy they haven't  disappointed at all.

Food:
Among their list of kebabs and starters I loved the following items mentioned. They were well prepared and tasted really yummy.
#Lasuni Tangri Kebab
#Junglee Masale ka murg
#Audi rings
#Potato Broccoli balls
#Basil Paneer tikka
#Paneer cordon blue
# Tandoori Mushroom
#Fish finger

Drinks:
Drinka were refreshing and presented well too. With interesting names the drinks were pretty cool. The gastronomical experience made my experience even better.

#Kiwi blast
#The wild cat cooler
#Cosmopolitan
Overall the food and drinks are nice and quite good with the presentation too.
Note:
Alcohol is served from Friday to Sunday as of now.

##Service:
With their cool ambiance the service has also worth mentioning. All the staffs are quite attentive and responds to your need and queries with commendable management skills. I liked the uniform with the LED name plate added to it. 

The owners Rishav , Varish and Vedant are a bunch of cool guys started up with one of happening place in the city. With their interactive nature and warm hosting this place is ready to experience new highs in future. 
I wish Team Pour House all the best for future endeavors.

Had come to this place with some expectations.. but they all turned negative and an evening that just went from good to bad..
Points remain galore... right from floor personnel to seat allocation.. with no sign of reservation.. ad-hoc seats were said to be reserved for no rime or reason.. false promisies were of music being started in 15 minutes.. and as i write this .. no music on a Saturday night till 8:45.. more than an hour into the place..
Inspite of all this when called for the floor manager inspite of being told by the serving personnel didnt turn up. Had hoped for another better place from the many that have mushroomed in sector 5.. was thoroughly disappointed..

Salt Lake, Sector V is home to some of the biggest business houses with upcoming headquarters of budding companies. The area, being the ultimate commercial hub of the city, records a footfall of over a million people on weekends, both office goers and party enthusiastic teenagers. So inevitably there is a huge demand for an extravagant party den to be located conveniently in the zone. Backstage had been holding up its end, but only for so long, as its services have degraded gradually. After this squalor, Sector V was in desperate need for a quintessential alternative.
                                                                ...

Stressed out??!...... Bored?!!......Tired of monotony??!!!!...
Sick of targets & deadlines??!! Frustrated with boring powerpoint presentations and excel sheets???!!!

All you need is some fun, some foot tapping steps with the trans vibes, and as the time passes by with the flickering lights and the DJ music turning loud, you get the feel of the night getting the heat turned up with colourful energy vibes and there you go..........The Freaking MADNESS!!!!!!

Sounds Interesting??!! Pour in at "POUR HOUSE" and your expectation as above comes to reality.
Located right beside RDB at Sector 5, this rocking place by 'Chowdhary brothers' is perhaps a new dimension to the city's nightlife, where you can leave all your worries and agony behind the corridor and move on to a journey to power packed madness.
The floor is huge with quirky signage on the walls reflecting the perfect environment and charm for all the nightlife seekers out there, and the flickering lights along with the DJ music is perhaps the best concoction of the quintessential party madness and ultimate stress busting nightlife charm.
To add upon, every sip on a drink and every bite of the food is like some heavenly notes rolling down the taste buds. So altogether, the entire combination of food, drink, and ambience can be claimed as a miracle that takes you to an eccentrically exciting level of life. Even, a middle aged person will start feeling young at "Pour House".

Adjacent to the main floor, this place houses an open air terrace, which bears a psychedelic charm for the way it is decorated with lights and all. Perhaps the best place to enjoy a fag break while enjoying the party. Comparatively calm and quite, the open terrace is  ideal  for smokers to enjoy some quiet smoke, and refuel themselves to get on the party shoe once again.
In nutshell, it is a heaven for the party lovers and nightlife seekers and a rocking destination for sure.

Thanks a lot to

We went to Pour House on a Monday evening. This place does not have a liquor license. We were told they serve cocktails on Friday to Sunday, but not on weekdays. The ambience is nice. The dance floor looks amazing,yet everything was quite lifeless as very few people were present there on a Monday evening. Food was good. We had ordered Thai Chicken, Hot and Garlic Pasta and nachos. We have tried some mocktails - Passion nook and Brain Freezer Margherita. Both were average. I am sure this place will not be the same once they have liquor license and publicity. Looking forward to come back soon! 

I visit Pour House very frequently and have never been disappointed. Food, music, service - everything is amazing. Yesterday, I had gone to Pour House with my friends but had a really unpleasant experience. The ladies washroom doesn't have proper doors! Either the locks don't work or there are no locks at all!! Trust me guys, you don't have to organize special events for women on women's day. Just get the doors repaired in ladies washroom. It's more than enough.

This place is the current buzz in town for lounge experience. Situated next to infinity in the megathron towers first floor; this place is like endless. Spacious, comfy  seating arrangement with covered and open seating options. The food menu is well decided and priced and the food Tastes good. The liquor license is still pending. The hookah is also pretty decent and can accompany to add the smoke of joy. The music selection will take you in its vibes and take you to the dance floor. 

Without making it further complicated or deep inside. Do try out the place. Worth the visit and exploration.

Newest pub in sector V, overall it doesn't disappoint. The place has a bit of a confused feeling when you look at the interiors. The place is too lit up. The posters of new york and uk seems a little cheap and not in fashion. Multi coloured sofas doesn't provide a pub like feel, rather looks kiddish. The neon area is a bit shabby. The bar is huge but looks a little empty. There are no tvs for the people sitting at the bar, a little disappointed on that note.
Food is really amazing. Chicken tikka, chicken cordon blue, pan fried chilli fish, paneer cordon blue, crispy chilli baby corn, grilled chicken and the navaratan korma and paneer lababdor combo was all that we ordered. All the dishes were delicious.
The cocktails were good. Mocktails still to work on. Music too was satisfactory.
The show stealer were the staff and the service. Excellent. That's what we are gonna come back for and the food too.

Pour House¬†had a mega launch on 17th of June, 2016. The who‚Äôs who of the food fraternity were present at party which was covered by t2, organized by xfactor and anchored by Rohan Arora.

At 10,000 sqft, with a private area close to 1000 sqft, a gigantic open terrace area, Pour house is your new ‚Äòone stop shop‚Äô when its Madness you‚Äôre looking out for.

"Pour House" is a name which is I connect to premises outside India. I am glad to see that Kolkata's finally reached such standards to match up to places to this! Thanks to the commendable efforts by the Chowdhary brothers! The place is huge, like really huge. It is a restaurant cum bar cum lounge cum pub n what not! Impeccably done up, awesome ambiance. This place is the place to be and to understand why, you have to pay them a visit!
We were lucky enough to be invited for their "grand opening"; the entire event was well thought out, attended by the who's who of the town. It was the place to be....!
To cater to so many guests they would opt for a buffet and so it was. Apart from that we were greeted with drinks like passion knock, strawberry colada, basil avalanche,. Their best drink was love in pour house..loved the name and the concoct! Their cosmos are recommended as well.

Coming to the moving starters:

1. Junglee Masale ka Murg was amazing!! A spiced chicken starter, cooked in the tandoor. It was perfectly marinated, the taste lingered and you would want to try more!
2. Audi Rings - The name resembles audi wheels, the dish is onion rings with a cheese mash!
3. Lasuni Kalmi Tangri Kebab: Yumm chicken drum stick pieces cooked in the Indian spices, wrapped in the silver foils to give it a royal feel. Looks good, tastes even better!
4. Potato Broccoli Ball: The best part about this place is the fact that they have thought about everyone! The vegetarians should be delighted, the vegetarian starters give stiff competition to the meat! Loved this starter.
5. Basil Paneer Tikka: I love paneer. And the pesto paneer with cheese filled centers tasted out of this world!!
6. Paneer Cordon Bleu: Well...who would have thought of a cottage cheese cordon bleu! These guys definitely did...and the filling was oozing out and could be tatsted with every bite made my evening!

This is the new place to be, if you have visited them yet, go for it! They have something for everyone, and you will not be disappointed! The weekends are already seeing heavy crowds speaking about their popularity in volumes!! Cheers!

Sector V always needed a quintessential pub, and probably Pour House has got the essence to become one. The place is big with different isolated sections, like section for private party, outdoor and indoor seating. The interior is perky, arrangement of the lights are well thought and the graphics on the wall will set your mood right.

We went down to the place to grab few beers but unfortunately they haven't got the liquor licence yet. So we decided to order Thai Fry Chicken and pan fried chilli fish and non-alcoholic beverages. The food was beautifully garnished and delicious, watermelon mojito was insanely refreshing, pour house special was okay. The presentation of food and drinks is gonna win your heart for sure.

Speaking of the most important thing - service - it seems like they got it right. Its important for a hospitality establishment to know how to serve customers and they had not given us a single chance to doubt about it. Its worth every single penny of the 10% service charge üòÇ

Just one suggestion, Bakstage kicked off the same way you have done, but they were not able to keep up the reputation. Dont be BakStage.

I am totally in love with this place.

Opened in an area full of cafes, pubs and discs. This place is sure to stand out. The ambiance and the interiors of Pour House is so amazing. You would love the pour house display that is just on the entrance. The ambiance again is very soothing. It has a huge seating capacity and also to compliment with, it has an open area. 

To talk about the food, we ordered tandoori paneer tikka, white sauce and red sauce pasta, north indian platter, potato cheese balls and in the mocktails we ordered orange mojito and mango berry.
I loved each and every item except the potato balls and risotto. There's scope for improvement in both of them.

The orange mojito and mango berry were so refreshing and we enjoyed both of them.

Also, the hookah was nice. The smoke was dense and the flavour was also in the right proportion.

Definitely a must visit place. Planning to visit again soon.
