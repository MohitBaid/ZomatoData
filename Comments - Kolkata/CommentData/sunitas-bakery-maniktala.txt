Best homemade cake had by me till date. The talented chef behind these amazing cakes Ms. Shradha is very passionate about what she does. I got this cake on a short notice of just 3-4hrs without any hassle. She kept all my requests and prepared the cake just as I wanted it to be! Extremely satisfied with the service. Kudos to you Shradha. Keep up the good work 👍

I ordered the cakes quite late but got the delivery the very next day on my mother's birthday. I'm so glad that she loved it. Thank You! ❤️

Hi, Anne! I just wanted to thank you for the AMAZING cake! You'll get lots of pictures when we get them, but I have to tell you, not only was it the coolest wedding cake in the world, but it was absolutely delicious! There were more pictures taken of the cake than of Jimmy and I. I wish I was making that up. In fact, someone at the wedding is friends with the guys from E-Town Concrete (a Jersey hardcore band) and apparently, the cake went viral! Jimmy is going to put it on Iron Maiden's Facebook and we'll see what happens, but it was a MASSIVE hit! I can't thank you enough for putting the time and effort into something so spectacular. You took our silly idea and made it into a work of art, and it really meant a lot to us. And the cookies! OMG were they GORGEOUS! We saved three of them, and my mom and I just split one at her house. They looked so cool and they were just as tasty! Thank you for making them, they were amazing! I'd love to take some classes, because as much as I love to bake, my cakes and cookies kind of come out ugly, so I hope to check out some classes soon! Again, you'll get pictures, and thank you, from the bottom of our heart for the wonderful job you did on our Eddie the Trooper cake! You are the best! All best! Lisa and James

Sunita's Bakery 🍰
If you bored of mio amore, rose,sugar and spice, Kathleen and other bakeries then sunita's bakery will be the right place to get something new both in taste and design..  For the first time I ordered a cake from a bakery and guess what? they made my celebration outstanding 😊
I have ordered dark chocolate cake with blueberry frosting, chocolate baskets, chocolate leaves cake and strawberry vanilla cake.. 
It tasted wow and price is reasonable.. 
Thanks to my Baker aunty.. 
Highly recommended and appreciated 😘
I'll keep on ordering.. 
Kudos team!
