Visited this place with friends on  a tuesday afternoon for lunch and quiet liked it. Prices are reasonable compared to the other places in the area. Food was delicious. We had tomato and manchow soup, schezwan chicken and chicken chowmin, chicken biryani with raita and gulab jamun with ice cream. It was yummy , well made and the proportion was sufficient.

The Accord, a restaurant attached to the hotel Corporate, is located in the interiors of the Park Street area, in the alley opposite to Mocambo restaurant.
The restaurant is small but classily decorated, with a small garden. The seating capacity would be around 15-20. There is a choice for buffet breakfast.
However, we came here for lunch on Boxing Day. It was quite empty, with only one staff member present to serve.
We ordered Manchow and Tomato Soup, which they served with crispy buttered breadsticks. For the main course, we ordered Chicken Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken with Gravy. We also ordered a plate of Chicken Biryani with Raita. For dessert, we had Hot Gulab Jamun with Butterscotch Ice cream.
The food was quite delicious, with reasonable quantity and price. Special shout out to the Schezwan chicken, which was very well cooked and soft, and the Biryani, which was very tasty.
The service could have been slightly prompter. But overall, a good food experience.

Went there for lunch. It was definitely not a great experience. The snail slow service and average food was not what i expected. The starters were fine that included Chicken 65, Salt and pepper chicken and dry chilli chicken. The schezwan noodles, chilli chicken and garlic chicken was not worth it. Somehow the mixed fried rice was quite tasty.

The Accord is in the ground floor of The corporate building, just the opposite lane of mocambo.
Its a very tiny joint with limited menu.
The staffs are okay, the ambience is also just fine with no music.
Coming to the food, all of the menu we tried were all okayish.
We ordered salt and pepper chicken, egg fried rice , chilli chicken and gulabjamun with icecream.
Pepper chicken was minced fried chicken with black pepper. It was little better than the other dishes. Both the rice and chilli chicken were tasteless. Gulabo jamun had a weird smell which and the taste did not go well with the icecream they served with.

Overall,  they should add some more variety to their menu and work on both the quality and hospitality.

We found this restaurant through Zomato and immediately wanted to try their Chinese dishes.
This is a very small restaurant attached with "The Corporate", located in the lane just opposite to
¬†"Tung fong" in Park street area.The ambience was awesome.Since it's mostly done with glass, the interior was beautiful and the seating arrangements were comfortable.

We ordered : Crispy chicken,Mixed Fried Rice and Manchurian Chicken.

crispy chicken was nicely made with good amount of chicken pieces.
Mixed rice was good but they put very less amount of prawn pieces in the rice and also the quantity was lessfor the price.
Manchurian fish was 8 small pieces of fish cooked in a well made gravy.Nothing special.

However the Service was quick and efficient. On one hand, the staffs are courteous but at the same time.Zomato should update their menu card because the prices did not match with their menu card.
Overall a decent restaurant to try if you are in Park street area......

I have tried Reshmi Kebab several times earlier but their's was the most innovative one. We tried only Indian dishes. Even now when I am thinking about them my mouth is watering.

Yes, I REPEAT FOOD with CHEAP PRICE. The taste of foods are delicious. We have ordered as starter Barbecued chicken and in the main course we want to try some Indian food. So we have decided to order lacha paratha and paneer karai, mutton masala. And we just have to pay 831/-  . Stuffs are suggested so well, if u confuse wat u should order then please don't hesitate to ask there stuffs. They'll tell the perfect one. 


THANK YOU BOYS FOR MADE MY SUNDAY EVENING. Want to come again ur place and also I'll suggest my all friends to visit here. :) :D

This is not a restaurant by size. Although it have a good ambience and they also offer varieties of North Indian food.
Service is very very good they always make you feel you're special. 
In terms of my experience I would say try to avoid food which are the sweet by nature like chicken butter masala for Mutton butter masala.

So the bottom line is it's a good option but of course not a choice.

The name of The Accord was on the list and found it lest costly also. So planned to visit it which was the best thing.
The food, ambience, service and everything which u want for a peaceful and lovely lunch or dinner was available here. We ordered Schezwan Mixed Chow, Drums of Heaven, Chicken 65.
Each of them had an unique touch to their taste and was a treat to the tongue. This is a must visit place.

It‚Äôs situated at park street and attached with the 4-star hotel ‚Äúthe corporate‚Äù, an 8-min walking distance from the park street metro station. The food is good but more importantly the place is very well arranged and decked up. The staffs are very well mannered and gave us full liberty to click pictures all around the place. The food was good so it should definitely be visited for once at least. I had mixed Cantonese chowmein, it was very well cooked. Those who love traditional Chinese food should try this dish. Pay a visit, you are going to have a nice experience.

Located in Park Street. This place is a part of THE CORPORATE. 

The way this place welcomes you is something really commendable. The ambience is awesome. Since it's mostly done with glasses, the decor is beautiful. 
Seating arrangements are comfortable. Pocket Friendly. 

*Fresh Lime Soda was made well but it was too hot for this summer. Must check on the icy part. 
*The Accord Special Soup which is a good combo of Eggs, Prawns and chicken were good to the taste buds.
*Honey Pepper Chicken was good.
*Mixed Fried Rice was disappointing. The Rice was half cooked. And tasteless !
*Ginger Prawns looked as ugly as it was in taste. Could have been much better. It tasted real bad. 

However the Service was quick and efficient. On one hand, the staffs are courteous but at the same time, they are unaware of the stuffs about the place. So this must be looked upon, very soon.

So with some ups and downs, this new place in the town is okay to visit. Cheers ! :)

Sometimes you need to look beyond the obvious to find something worthwhile. The lane to The Accord is guarded by Park Street legends like Tung Fong and Mocambo. Hence in can rightly be called a hidden gem. The decor and ambience is absolutely stellar. The full view glass window, the seating arrangements, the lighting are delightful. The sweet line soda was spot on and the honey chicken was delicious. The manchow soup was a delight on the taste buds. The Cantonese mixed noodles could have been better. Some of the cucumbers in the gravy were bitter. The garlic chicken was however sufficiently palatable. 
          Lack of dessert choices did leave us a tad bit disappointed, but the vanilla ice cream with ample chocolate sauce did lighten the mood again. The staff was warm, prompt and extremely hospitable. The highlight was the ridiculously low pricing for such a great ambience and quite decent food. I would absolutely like to visit it again. Park Street has got a new star and we need to notice it ASAP.

Located in the lane opposite mocambo, part of THE CORPPRATE hotel

Ambiencr and decor- a small 25seater place but the decor has been done properly with a full glassdoor view of the road putaide, basic but comfortable chairs and table an neat and clean paint

Food and menu: Indian and Chinese cuisine is offered
We had speciall accord soup which ws a gud mix of prawn chicken and egg and midly spicy

Fried rice and ginger prawn were bad to be honest

And honey pepper chicken saved the bet and tasted nice

Staff and service- courteous and prompt staff and average speed of service

Overall verdict-taste wise not good but pocket pinch is very satisfactory

[Intro]
Sometimes you need to notice some of the great places where price us very reasonable but the food is excellent,you went pass by the place may be many times but never found it or didn't thought that there is may be a restaurant.well this thing happened to me quite a few days back,while crossing the park street area I was going towards bata more from the Tung Fong,all of a sudden i noticed there is a big hotel.but never thought in that place a hidden gem restaurant there.the restaurant inside hotel The Corporate,went for the dinner set course meal.the place was not big but good sarrouned by the glass wall,very comfortable sitting arrangement.20-25 seaters,along with chairs and tables.some of them tables along with sofas too,which is very comfortable.time was around 7 p.m.place was totally empty.awaited outside around 10 mins.it was very clean and well maintained place,a buffet section already ready for the full up.welcomed by the restaurant stuffs.this place offered you chinese and north indian meals.
[Location]
Just get down in bata more,walk towards tung fong,from where the mallick bazar autos coming from,just cross the road and left side you will fund this place.better use google map help me a lot everytime.
[Ambience and Interior]
Very classy decoration with very normal ambience,the interiors were good,the thing you will notice first colorful stones inside a pot or spread a small portion of corner of the restaurant,wall hangings there too,overall it was good.
[Foods]
1. Fresh lime soda sweet and salt - a great combination of sweet and salt,nothing lacking with this drink,both the amount they used was perfect soda and the lemon combination excellent,had tried this drink many places but this one is unique. 

2. Accord special seafood soup - started with soup,this one accord special mixed soup,consists small portions of prawns along with finely cutted chicken portion mixed with the spices and spring onion,taste was good and it was very thik,not liquid type.really loves the soup as a start up. 

3. Pepper fish - a kind of starter before start the main course,went for the fish one.the fish they used for this one is basa fish,coated properly with the flour and fried very well the crunchy coating you can feel from the first bite,tossed with pepper powder,bell pepper,freshly cutted onions with the spring onion,the texture was good.taste was really good,properly fried inside portion was soft the flavour reached inside the fish,full of spices and this one a real spicy one.
   
4. Butter naan - started with butter naan,full of butter all over it,sizes were very big it was very soft,you can easily part it with your hands.

5. Polau - white colored rice mixed with cashew nuts along with carrot,beans,raisins,cooked very well full if flavour,rice was boiled well mixture of sweet but it was really good taste,come to the quantity portion it was real good,easily good enough for two people.

6. Chicken tikka butter masala - thus one my all time fav dish,whenever come side dishes always choose this one,i had a high expectations from them and yes fantabulous.taste was really good,comes four portions of chicken sizes was good,buttery filling all over the gravy,very good quality as well as quantity,gravy was very thik.

7. Gulab jamun n rosogolla - dessert part started with hot gulab jamun,it was very good but the rosogolla is not like that it need to be more soft it was frozen totally and hard too. 
[Service]
I was expecting a lovely service,and they were excellent,very attaintative start,everytime asking how was the food,vest part was their service is very quick,the foods tried there hardly awaited for 5-9 mins,the foods almost going to complete the next dish came.i really appreciate their hard work that's why this type of service i had there.

Well this is quite a new restaurant and hard to find even in zomato. When I was searching a place for a weekend brunch, I could have missed it if Sayan Mitra didn't draw my attention towards it. After my very first glance, I selected this place for that particular meet. Truly saying, it did satisfy me.
The accord is in the royd street, opposite lane to the mocambo, in the ground floor of the corporate hotel. It has a classy ambiance with sophisticated decor. We were a total of 12 people that day and we were nicely accommodated all together. As this restaurant has not yet been in lime light, it was no one present other than us. The staffs gave us a worm welcome as I informed them earlier that we are coming. We ordered everything one could. Chicken hot and sour soup, crispy chicken, fish fingers were elected by us as appetizers. The soup was tangy and tasty. We ordered a lot for main course from where I could remember navaratna pulao, chicken biriyani, mixed fried rice, chilli fish, mutton dopiyaza. The food was not bad but the mutton pieces were stiff. The staffs apologized to us for that and promised us a better mutton next time :)
I gave this joint 4 because it has many points to look at. Those are,
1. Delivery time. A hungry man will loose his temper.
2. Food quality. Fish fry, mutton items, biriyani were below average. 
But, the bunch awesomeness with the accord are,
1. The ambiance. I just loved it.
2. The sober and sophisticated interior.
3. The friendly staffs.
I will definitely visit this place again. Good wishes and love for them :)

Menu card of this restro is offered generally two cuisines one is Chinese & another is Indian. We'd started with some delicious starter like Crispy Chicken, Crispy Baby Corn, Fish Finger etc. Some of us were taken Hot & Sour soup, which was very tasty. After that main course we'd selected from both the cuisine & more or less every item was upto the mark. Specifically the taste of Chicken Do Piaza was fabulous. Staffs of this restaurant are very friendly. They were help us to capture a group photo. üòÑ Finally me with my best buddies had spend a beautiful weekend evening at this place which is unforgettable. üòÉ

Came here with my friend on a Tuesday evening. This place is located inside THE CORPORATE.When you enter prepare to be,let me put it this way,have a smile that reaches up to your eyes. The place has a lovely ambience and a wonderful staff.I was surprised ,how come this place had no pics and ratings. It was 6 pm and we were the only customers, so it was kind of nice for us,we got special attention
Well coming to the food,we had ordered north Indian, chicken butter masala and butter roti.The chicken was soft and delicious and the Rotis were soft.All in all a delightful experience.
Plus point - It's quite affordable.
