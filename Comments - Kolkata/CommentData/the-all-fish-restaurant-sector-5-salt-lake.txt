One of the best fish restaurants I have ever visited..the food was so yummy I forgot clicking pics after the 1st one and gorged on the food the moment is arrived.
The restaurant is managed by girls mostly so it's very noisy as all the girls are always chatting and laughing..but overall leaving apart the ambience..food is perfect..
Ordered 2 fish fingers and fish fries each..in the main course had prawn fried rice and sweet and sour prawn..dessert included sweet doi..and every food was just up to the mark..@
Price is so low that I was in doubt whole ordering as to the quality of food..but to my surprise everything was almost perfect..
Very glad I found such a place..where only fish is served at such price..being a bong fish has always been my 1st preference..

After spending a long time in Nicco Park we are planning to come on this place. We thought we can have food like home style. 

But it was really disappointed for us when we visited place, the quality of food was not up to the mark.
We ordered plain rice  aalo vaja macher matha diye daal chingri malai curry and they gave chatni papad as complementary. The rice portion was good daal was ok type. But the chingri malai curry was horrible the fish was not fresh. That's chatnei and papad was good which they served  as  complementary. One of a member ordered fish momo there is also the same thing the fish was not fresh, cannot complete a single piece of momo the soup was also pathetic which they  gave with momo. 
The Ambience of the restaurant was very normal.
Service was good but when we complained  regarding the fish we didn't got a proper answer.

It was really disappointed for us because we went for fish item and the fish was pathetic

Located in Nalban Food Park at Sector 5, this restaurant is managed by State Government personnel.

The restaurant is neat and hygienic and does not boast of extravagant ambience. The only focus is food with a very simplistic Bengali and Chinese Menu.

Went there for a lunch. Ordered the Rice, Aloo Bhaja, Mug Dal with Fish Head, Chingri Malaikari and Katal Kalia.

Omitting the usual stuff - Rice and Aloo Bhaja, the Mug Dal with fish head was amazing - it was thick and flavoured with bits of fish. The Katal Kalia was also tasty, fish was perfectly cooked, only issue being the gravy was a bit sweet. The Chingri Malaikari was delicious as well, with the fish being juicy and fresh and perfectly cooked.
Papad and Mango "Chatni" (the Bengali Version) was complementary.
Finished the amazing lunch with soft Rosogollas.

The service might not seem very professional but the staff are very cordial.
It's a must visit place for fish lovers and food is inexpensive.

Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5

Repast time!

Nothing can be better than a perfect delicacy with crunchy starter in monsoon. As time is unavailable when you work in MNC so plans have to make before hand to meet the pleasure of your life. And to spend time with it you gotta plan it proper.

Destination was the hub of MNCs, Sector V, however, for food we hunted the fish abode, Nalban Food Park. To satiate our tooth we ordered for one fish cutlet, one plate fish Momo and one combo of polao including bhetki fish paturi. Trust me they prepare it in different style. So if you're a fish lover, you must visit this abode of fish to provide different options to your tooth. Though the problem you face over here is, maximum dishes is unavailable doesn't matter what time is it. This is the 3rd time it happened with me. And everytime I gotta change my options. Nevertheless food is tasty.

The eatery is located bang opposite to McDonald's in sector 5. It's a air conditioned area with too little space inside. Considering that this is a government initiative, the decor was not A grade. 

Coming to the food. We ordered the following: 
1. Fish Paratha: The item is nice, it is a Paratha with basa fish stuffed inside. The quantity of fish is not very great but does contain the flavour. 
2. Chilli fish: Very Indian styled gravy. Had 4 medium sized pieces of basa fish. 
3. Rice thali (x5) : It had rice, gondhoraaj lebu lonka and jhur jhure alu bhaja. The quality of rice was commendable
4. Macher matha diye mug daal (x3) : This is daal with fish head. Tasted great. 
5. Doi katla: The size of fish was small and the gravy was a generic gravy, tasted alright. 
6. Shorshe Pomfret: Again the size is disappointing considering they charge Rs 200 for a single fish. Anyway the gravy had the pungent nature and was good 
7. Bhetki jhaal : One of the better dishes. Tasted good. The bhetki was fresh too. 
8. Chingri malaikari : a decent sized prawn with the generic white gravy. 
9. The aam chaatni and papad were complimentary 
10. Mishti doi (x4) : Alright 

All these items costed around â‚¹1216 for us 6. I think this is just averagely good in terms of quality but not at par with the likes of them established Bengali cuisine chains.
