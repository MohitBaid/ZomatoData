It is a pocket friendly place with nominal taste in food. We had french fries, crispy chicken and crispy chilly fish for starters. I loved the food and the booze is super cheap.The place looks decent, comfortable seating arrangement but I was pretty disappointed by the behavior of the waiters It felt like they were forced to serve us there. Except for that it's a nice place as the location is very good just opposite RDB cinemas and attracts a huge office crowd.

This is really a nice place to hangout. I had that Kingfisher Draught beer and it's really pocket friendly over here. They also gave me a complimentary beer mug for free with this draught beer. However, the ambience can be improved to some extent as the place was too silent. May be they can play some nice playlist. Furthermore, the other thing I didn't like about this place is that they don't expect table booking.

Visited this place innumerable times because its located just opposite to RDB cinemas. The best part about this place is alcohol is priced normally which makes it worth a visit. And the food is also quite tasty.Quantitu of mains like rice or noodles is less,Apart from that all is okay.

If you are looking for budget bars, this should come at the top of the list. Food quality is okay (I absolutely don't mean bad) ,service is not satisfactory but prices are there to make you feel happy. Don't go there making it a destination, but visit it if you're around sector 5 and looking for a place to spend some time over some booze. 
Thank you

Everything is good here except the staffs, they are really non-friendly,rude, careless...
We ordered tandoori chicken half, drums of heaven (foods)
 60ml of JW, 30ml & 60ml two signature rare, 30ml of Bacardi white (drinks) ... Total bill was 800 and something which was really satisfying...

Go where, salt lake
Location: Bang opposite to RDB cinema hall, sector 5.
Basically this restaurant has 3 parts AC, NON AC & smoking with drinking zone with good space and comfortable couches.. 
Decor is nothing to die for but it's clean and simple😄
One of the cheapest price bar in Salt lake.. 
We ordered :
*Kingfisher strong 
*Fish Fingers(8 pieces) served with mayo dip - This is one of the popular dish over here I loved it too.. It's a must try dish 👌👌
*Mixed Hakka noodles- Thin noodles tossed with veggies, egg, chicken and shrimps.. 
Noodles was tasty but  0.5/5 was deducted due to shrimps because it was stale.. (Improve this please) 
  Staffs are really helpful and quick on their service.. Music on TV. 😎
Menu is same as given on zomato no change.. 
Love to visit again!

They also have happy hours which I found out great like 1:1 in beer and other drinks.
Their takes on food is also good. But a bit less quantity as per the price.
Heading towards saltlake with some boozing mood and not enough in your pocket? Visit this place :)
Spacious ambience inside !

Convivial Toast!

When the climate  bars you to honour the festival, then you pick your own way to revel it. Exactly, that's what we did. We had gone where we wanted, thus, that was Go Where. 

Ambience was itself tipsy. And the food we ordered were fair. However, more orders were capable enough to fill our tummy, nevertheless, they were served hot and tardy. Our choices were dragon chicken in starter. As the weather were tipsy, thus we wanted to fly as hot as possible. Though could not and crashed ourselves into it. And the options for main course were Schezwan fried rice, chicken rice, with hot garlic chicken dry and chilli chicken. Thus as said, all cuisines were fair to eat except those liquids we decreed for. One Carlsberg was a catalyst enough to trigger your dopey mood. 

Tipsy might not be the tip worthy, however, acceptable in barred weather to accompany your mood.

I am more or less regular at Go Where....mostly order straight drinks as per my choice....today visited this place with my few friends they ordered LIT which is ok but much less than our expectations as there is no flavour of Cointreau which is not at all there, even there is lack of a good tequila and overall the lack is in making this amazing bilt up cocktail....the first LIT that we got is completely worthless as it was made with crushed ice which is not at all acceptable even the bar man doesn't even know how to make it and the most amazing part is that they are charging an LIT @750 which is a completely worthless of the money....please don't order any cocktail over here....its just valueless....even in kolkata we can get a much much more better LIT at much less budget price...my view to the GO WHERE Management please don't try to cut your customers with such an exorbitant priced up cocktail with such an worthless output....pls don't....

After your order you have to wait like 20-30 mins for anything. They are bit slow. Overall i will say this is good bar at this cheap rates . Will visit again .

A place where you should go only when it's month end or you are broke. The drinks are cheap and the food is average. Nothing adds the zing to the place. Some people might just feel that the place is too shabby. So if you are planning a drink cum food date go somewhere else.

Being a frequent visitor of the place. I have nothing less than absolute love for it. It has no happy hours, but don't let that deter you. The prices are extremely reasonable and the staff is very nice. The seating area is great, having three separate rooms big enough to seat atleast 50 in each. Very comfortably so. Also the smoking area is a beautiful room with bright yellow walls and posters. Definitely worth a try. :)

Go Where serves as the de-facto watering hole along with Opium of Sector 5. Gunning for both is the affordable pricing and easy location. Located opposite RDB, this place is an easy find. Ideal place to have a pint with your buddies and watch a match while munching on some snacks. The food is nothing to write home about, the finger foods are generally the best sellers. 
Go there (or where?) for the dirt cheap liquor and a laid back feel on the comfy sofas. They also have an attached smoking room so you don't have to leave the restaurant for your mid-drink puff.

We sit in the middle section quite good ambience but the most disappointed moment was service guys were not so much attentive, service guys were sitting infront us they should know common etiquettes need some basic training, restaurant decor well.

Let us count the positives:
▪located across the street from RDB Boulevard
▪food tastes good for the prices charged
▪availability of smoking area
▪charges lower than most bars around for drinks 
▪space available to accomodate quite a few guests at a time
▪usually has great 1:1 or 2:1 offers running on drinks
▪has a separate quick snack outlet outside for quick bites in a hurry
▪has an off shop in case you need to leave and are not yet feeling done with the booze

Now for the not so perfect:
▪uninterested staff and service (food orders eventually arrive though very late)
▪not so clean washroom with so many people   visiting the place
▪lighting is so low as to make it look seedy/shady to first timers
▪decor is just about some furniture plonked around

Visit if you are just tired and need some booze and food and not looking for an experience.

If you want to hangout with your friends and wants to booze too but in a cheap rate you can obviously visit this place it's pocket friendly and good too.. I am giving this rating only the quality of the food..
First comes to the embiance it's a large space but the sitting arrangements is not good the sofa is dirty you can find dust particles also.. rats will roaming around..
2nd comes to the behaviour.. you will not get any kind of warm welcome over there.. the waiters r so casual that they will not notice that you get a sit or not if you didn't ask them to get it.. and it's irritating you know that you are standing in front of everyone and you are getting any sits..
Now come to the main point the alcohol is cheap in rate.. and seriously the food is awesome... They takes time to serve you the food.. when they are taking time to serve it naturally I get irrate but when I taste the food it's take my all anger away.. I order chicken drums of heaven it's spice mouth watering taste.. I just loved it.. as starter I also ordered fish finger and trust me it's awesome.. full of fish not with batter and fillings..Crisp and soft.. and in main course I ordered mixed fried rice and dry chilli chicken.. and both are good in taste.. I like the food too much..

This is a regular place for me due to the low priced drinks. They also have different offers on different drinks like buy 1 get 1 or buy 2 get 1. These are highly beneficial considering the price of 1 drink.
Do try the fish finger. Its one of the best dishes of this place. Otherwise most of the items are good value for money.
The problem with this place is  the waiters. Its very difficult to get hold of one who will come at regular intervals or atleast be visible enough for you to call. Most of the times I have to wait for quite sometime to order something. The serving time for food is also a tad too high.
However considering the price and location of the restaurant, its not a bad place to visit when you are a regular. 
Another word of caution, you dont get all the drinks mentioned in the menu. Also cocktails are mostly unavailable.

The problem with this place is  the waiters. Its very difficult to get hold of one who will come at regular intervals or atleast be visible enough for you to call. Most of the times I have to wait for quite sometime to order something. The serving time for food is also a tad too high.
However considering the price and location of the restaurant, its not a bad place to visit when you are a regular. 
Another word of caution, you dont get all the drinks mentioned in the menu. Also cocktails are mostly unavailable.

If you love Friday night techie crowd the sector 5 is the best place for you all the major IT  companies are nearby, there are many good bar around the RDB area of sector 5 but this one is very reasonable with good crowd, ambience is also upto the mark. Staters are tasty but the best part is the crowd as many of  them are  techie guys so some serious techie talks and gossip you will be able to here the best one I have heard "bhai aaj meri bandi ka code nhi chal rha tha tere bhai ne debug kar ke chalaya hai bndi impressed hai bhai aaj beer meri taraf se bhai" and the second one many of you can relate to "bhai ek baat to smjh mein aa gai ki IT ki job krke hum swift desire le sakte hain Audi nhi chal kuch startup kholte hai , dekh yaar Oyo ola uber kahan paunch gae bhai aur hum 10 se 8 waale hi reh gae (talk pauses) are bhaiya beer laana discussion karna hai  👍😉😋😉😋 " if you love this type of ambience this place is perfect for you.

Cheap watering hole, mainly filled with office goers of the area. Staff is kind of casual and have an obliging attitude which is highly uncalled for, rest is okay. Drinks are cheap, food is moderate. 

Will be great if the staff behavior changes, come on we're not your enemies but your guests (who pay :P lol) and please keep your washroom clean, the most important place for people after they're done with boozing. Otherwise, a good place for a hangout without shelling out a filthy lot of money.

Cheers!

This bar doesn't have any floor manager to offer you good assistance. I throughly recommend everyone to add some little bucks and enjoy a good times at some other bar at Sector 5. The saddest part was my driver was harrashed. The worst bar in that area.

Have been to this place yesterday. Initially was bit apprehensive to enter given the shabby looks at the entrance. But once inside the joint has descent looking interior with woodwork decor. There is a good seating arrangement in terms of space. Lots of 6 seater  couch to cater groups. The drinks are reasonably cheap. The service is very prompt. We liked Hot Garlic Chicken and Fish Finger. Even Paneer Tikka was good enough. The food price is also damn cheap. I think this is the cheapest joint in that area. But not very crowded thanks to its shabby entrance ! On the whole we were pretty happy with quality of food and service vis-a-vis price. 

Pros: Cheap, Good Food, prompt service, wide range of food items.

Cons: Spotted a couple of rats doing the rounds ! (Not joking). Dirty restrooms.

It is just opposite RDB... Mostly people from the nearby offices go there... The decor is okaish with Bollywood music playing in the background... they have a smoking room which is nice. We had crispy chicken, black pepper chicken and pan fried chilly chicken and drinks... The quantity is less compared to other outlets that serve these dishes. The food was average. But crispy chicken was really good. Appropriate place if you want to hang out with friends for a drink or two...

Well, I don’t know if I am doing justice to this iconic place by reviewing it on the basis of just a Veg paneer roll I had here!

Was determined to dine here and reached them at some 12:30 pm, only to see that they haven’t yet opened up for the day. However, they had a running take-away counter established, which serves a decent variety of rolls!

I went for their Veg paneer roll, which was prepared in no time – priced at just Rs. 40/-. Roll was pretty decent, good size, good taste, good veg content (capsicums, tomatoes, potatoes etc), good paneer content, good preparation and modestly priced!

Kudos to the food presentation as well as quantum served!

They also have a bar and a restaurant. Since I don’t drink, I will not be visiting the former, but since I love good food, I will definitely be visiting the latter someday, as well re-visit their rolls take away counter!

Foods are satisfactory. Chicken drumsticks and fish fingers are good munchies to go with alcohol. They have a smoking room also though it's very suffocating.

Well this is a relatively cheaper option at Sector 5. Service is very slow and nonchalant. The service providers sometimes coax you to order some specific stuff from their menu. It seems that they are more interested in serving stuff that they are most comfortable with in the kitchen (colloquially known as the running items). So after a lot of yes and no, they finally serve you what you want. But definitely the food they serve is good quality, no doubts about that. So if you want a cheaper option at Sector 5, this place will certainly serve your needs but be prepared for the downsides too.

Crispy Chilli Fish was moist and had a sweet aftertaste.
Chilli Chicken Dry on the other hand was crispy.

The food along with 2 cokes and 3 beers cost us 1013/-

Well we like our drinks and sides so Go Where suits well for us because it has both in very reasonable prices. We ordered 3 beers with Dry Chilli chicken and Chilli fish. The food was  unexpectedly satisfactory for a place where people go mainly for the alcohol. The fish was well cooked and soft so that's a plus. The Chilli chicken too was well prepared with very thin cornflour coating which is rare to find at this budget. The service is a little weak. It's good for some drinking and chilling for people who stay around the sector 5 area and are too lazy to go south.

One of my worst experiences ever, I mean seriously, why hasn't this place shut down yet?
The staff here are horrible, we entered the place in a group of 8, and there was no one to attend us. When asked for table for 8, they blatantly told us to sit separately with even being apologetic. We sat there for like 15mins, and none of the waiters came to give us the menu as they were busy watching the television. Pathetic.
When told to do so, they gave excuse that, food would take time so they weren't giving us the menu. We simply walked out of the place, without even having any food.

Go Where has been my saviour on many occasions when the other bars in Sector V were too crowded for a seat. The ambiance isn't that good and they used to allow smoking inside, don't know if they are allowing it now. But then again, isn't alcohol without "sutta" is somewhat incomplete !! The quality of the food is okay and the price of alcohol is lesser than the other bars around. Overall, a good place if you are budget conscious and not so much bothered about the quality of the food...

Awkward place to go with a girl by your side. This place generally invites people aged 40+ and looking to have some drinks without pinching their pockets..

Located at busy area of Sec-V, Salt Lake. Kind of a average bar cum restaurant with nothing great or nothing very bad. Visited many times with colleagues and friends. This place mainly caters to people working in near by offices and students of this area. Nothing much for food and bar selection is very restricted.

Go where is an eatery which serves alcohol as well. It is located opposite of the RDB cinemas. It as bit shady and difficult to find. The ambience is not good at all. There are no interior decorations or any decoration at all to make the place look attractive. They have three different seating arena. The staff behavior is good but the service is quite slow.  The food tastes moderate, nothing extraordinary. The only good thing about this place is that it serves alcohol at quite low rates. So go where is good only for those beer craving days when the pockets are tight. :)

I wouldn't like to comment on their ambiance. Coz they have put no effort on that. Food is good and ok. Service is on the slower side.
The restaurant is ok to go for casual dining and drinks.

Now I don't really know what else to say. Alcohol sold at very cheap rates. But no. Just don't go there. Not worth it......

I wish I could give a negative rating to this place. I went there with two colleagues of mine on Aug 19 evening. No one there bothered to ask us to take a seat. We found a place in a corner. After 15 minutes of waiting a waiter came and asked us to leave the seat as they want another group to accommodate there and asked us to accompany him to another seat. But there wasn't any seat over there. The waiter was very rude when I asked him for a place to seat. Even the person there at the cash counter who introduced himself as manager was not willing to help us. He did not even bothered to listen to our grievances. Such is the customer service at this place. We then left for another bar.

If you don't have that much budget and you still want to eat something really good then you have to visit this Place once. Food are really good, specially starter items. And if you are here then have to eat Crispy Chilly Baby corn, it's really spicy. So u can visit this place once with your loved once or with your friends.

This multicuisine food joint has become one of the most favourite hangout destinations for office It crowd and nearby college folks . The food and alchohol rates over here are generally average or cheap and this is the main reason why it remains crowded on most weekdays and weekend evenings. The music they play is sort of okayish . They allow smoking inside the restaurant which can raise a few eyebrows and can be a disturbing thing for others. Indian and chinese dishes like chili chicken , chicken drumstick, crispy chicken, crispy chili baby corn , reshmi kabab etc will make your tummy happy 
Service food and quantity are okayish

This is a place you go at the end of the month. We went to this place because of cheap alcohol . There there 3 rooms and this bar is spacioys though lacks the ambiance. They serve peanuts with alchohol and the dru myshroom, dry pepper fish was pretty decent. The lime soda that i had was well made, so if you are out with friends and planning to spent less but drink a lot then this is the place.

go where is bang opposite to rdb cinemas. the space is big enough. pricing is okay. ambience and lightning are okay too. service is good. we ordered for 5 beers, schezwan chicken dry, crispy chilly babycorn and salt n pepper fish. the baby corn was awesome, sadly the chicken was not, it was more of fried chicken wd onions and capsicum and so was d fish, spoilt wd excess black pepper. the beer was chilled wdva small bowl of complimentary peanuts. my personal opinion is that tge food quality and taste is not upto the mark, for which the "opium" seems to be a better bet. pleaase work on the food go where.

This is one of the oldest pub around that area. Before it was renovated drinks were superb cheapand food was tasty too. But after renovation it has has changed the price too much. I compared its price with opium its competitor and it was also high than opium. Thats why it has lost its customer. Service is not good. Have to ask many times to the waiter to remind that you have ordered something. Only go if you are left with no option.

The most pocket friendly bar in town. Awesome environment, great service and the food is really good. The most catchy thing about this bar is that its very calm and quite. You can have a nice group drink-adda session or you can have a quite drink by yourself. Opposite to Barbeque Nation, it gives the alcohol lovers a good treat along with foodies in Barbeque Nation. A must go !!!!!

No doubt these restaurant serves liquor and food at cheapest rate in salt lake sector v, but when it comes to good ambience, hygiene and hospitality it is getting a 0 out of 10 from my point of view. 
Today as we were in college uniform they completely asked us to get out of the place. How can they do that? They could have offered only food but i dont get this logic behind not serving anything to uniformed college students( that too legally eligible to drink). Today the moment we entered the place it was stinking like a public latrine. The kitchen area was open too, which horrified us even more. Anyhow couldn't have beard the smell and the so-visible thick layer of dust on couches. 
Not going to this place again.

Most pocket-friendly bar at Sector 5. It's located just opposite to RDB. It's again one of those medium-end pubs where the food served is also tasty. Paid a visit a numerous times but they never let us down. Service time differs during peak hours, mostly on Friday evenings. Ambiance is okayish.

Located just opposite RDB Cinemas and its a "khoofiya" place. I was surprised to see how spacious and big is that restaurant considering the tiny and shabby look from outside. The seats are good though the ambience is not that good to go "wow". Food is awesome specially the fish finger. Its the best I have ever eaten. Prices of alcohol and food is cheap and reasonable and the amazing thing is that the final bill always comes reasonably low compared to other restaurant bills at same food and drinks prices(i dont know how). There are tvs at every corner of the room which makes a perfect place to sit and relax with a beer and epl match on weekends. There is even a separate smoking zone which helps for the smokers. The staffs and their service is quite good and fast. But the only letdown is the restroom. Its very badly maintained! All in all a good place to chill!

Situated just opposite to rdb cinema hall, this is a nice n cozy place. It's pocket friendly. Though the service is not very prompt n attracting the waiters attention on a busy Friday night is a bit difficult, but who cares as long as they serve ur first rounds fast.. the food is good. One of the saviours of sector 5 which helps cleanse the hectic week tiredness.

I sincerely wish I had found this place earlier. All those 4 years of engineering life spent on finding good bars which won't burn a hole in my pocket. This place clearly wins the prize in budget drinks. 
Located very close to rdb it offers quite a nice area to Sit down comfortably and drink. This place offers no fancy shit, but good old alcohol and spicy meat dishes to help you with it. I opted for A fine glass of Jim Beam and a plate of Pan Fried Chilli Chicken .
You may compare it to Olypub, but I feel personally this place has greater varieties of liquor and the staff here are very well behaved unlike olypub. 
It also has a smoking roof and an area inside for private bookings. 
Only thing that Is that it doesn't serve food before 2.30 pm. Rest is just fine.

Go Where is one of the Cheapest pubs you would find in the Sector 5 area. The place has quite a hefty accommodation and would mostly be filled in by 7 PM on the weekends and the Fridays. The decor is okayish and nothing too fancy. The ambiance is vibrant but a tad below quality because of the rates at which their cater liquor. 

Coming to the food, I love their Chicken Lollypop and Chicken Wings. The chicken is tender and succulent with red sauce tossed with it making the outer coating a bit crispy yet perfectly tangy and saucy.

The place is well managed and the service is okay. I would suggest to refrain from dates or chilling out with female colleagues at this place as it is not suitable for the same.

If you compare this to opium this place is not up to the mark. It has a very big space. But the room near to the washroom is kinda stinks. But anyway it has an extra space for smoking.
Coming to food the starters were very good. We ordered the different dishes.
But main course was horrible. Noodles was bad and it was stinking, while complaining they didn't even changed it. But the waiters were very fast specially they guy name Tanveer. It's an average place, cheap near to IT park. Nothing special.

Every time me and my friend think of a relaxing time we know that "Go Where" is the apt place for us. As known properly its a Bar cum Restaurant.

The Ambiance of the place is just awesome, its comfy and the dim lights create the exact environment  one could require for relaxing.

The Food which we have tried till now has been simply awesome and a highly recommended one. Special mention would be "crispy baby corn" just couldn't get enough of it.The service is quite good and they don't keep you in huge delays at any point of time. 

The smoking zone is separate and the laboratories are clean and well maintained.Would highly recommend this.

Go where is one of the popular restaurant and Bar among the office goers in that area.

**Location**
Located at the sector v saltlake just opposite of the RDB adlabs entrance gate.

**Ambiance**
If I have to say about the ambiance it's purely a bar environment and a pure boozing place.
Interiors are a bit dark and simple one.

**Food**
Whenever I have came here I tried their Chinese items and kebabs along side.
Pricing is quite good and food is just about ok. Nothing fancy just usual ones. You get lunch combos in weekdays as well that's specially has been designed for the office goers and pretty nice.
They have happy hours as well on the hard drinks as well.
Pore value for money stuffs all around.

**Service**
Service here is pretty quick and very responsive as well. People serving there will always be on their best while serving you liked it. 
Good place for chill and relax for long time and most importantly budget friendly too.

At the entry we felt it would be a shabby bar, but once we entered the staff kept on taking us inside while realising how big actually this place is. Great affordable prices for alcohol and food prices are quite cheap considering its location at Sector 5. Do try its Fish Fingers as its one of the best at the outlet. Ambience is not great but of an orthodox bar and restaurant,additionally with TV which can be viewed from almost all seats you can have fun watching live matches in a group.

We generally visit hing and thought about changing the destination and thank God that we did. 
This place was big and the seating quite comfortable. 
They had an mind blowing offer on jim beam. With 2 large pegs for just 250 INR! :-o
We ordered the chilli mushrooms and pan fried chilli chicken. 
The chilly mushroom was full with mushrooms and instead of just onions that you get in other pubs. The chilly chicken was crunchy on the out and soft inside. Yum. 
The server was very jovial and warm. 
Am i coming back?  Yup, go where is now the friday night place.

With the increasing craze for opium, Go Where can be a substitute for the same...but only in terms of getting a chance to grab a seat! You won't be getting a good ambience or some nice music playing around.. But you gonna get good food n drinks at affordable prices. That's something that actually counts for, when u r craving for drinks but unable to make out somewhere...! I thank the management can really work upon the interior n some good music..

* UNFORTUNATE FACTOR : SIMPLY OVERSHADOWED PUB BY MANY POPULAR BAR AROUND THE AREA. BUT THIS BAR IS WAY BETTER THAN THOSE AT SEC 5 AND IT HAS BECOME MY FAVOURITE PUB FOR LOT OF FACTS. ✌✌✌

* THE FACTORS I LIKED MOST : 
* Ambience : we entered into the bar at about 7pm and few people were scattered over there. It has large space inside, 3-4 big rooms can afford many people. Comfortable sofas, large tables, not so much dim light....over all ambience was perfect for friends, for partners even for dating. After a tiring day at sec 5, this outlet was like a fresh breeze to me. Liked the ambience so much. (rating 10 on 10) 👌👌👌

* Price : We took so many drinks and foods,but the price WAS UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP comparing their quality and quantity of food. 👏👏👏 I think sec 5 people are very less bothered to pay a lot in drinks and food. So they don't visit here. 😁😁😁 (rating 10 on 10) 

* Best liking: No bothering loud music could interrupt your chatting or if you are only romancing a little bit. Romantic ambience I must say. (rating 10 on 10) 👍👍👍

* Food : 1. I liked most the BOURBON SCOTCH they provide @ so much low rate. And also they have offers now in BOURBON WHISKY ( 1 PEG FREE WITH 1 PEG YOU TAKE) 🍷🍷
 2. Fish fingers ( 8 pcs) as starters were very very good. they smooth, hot, full of quality fish and perfectly made. After a long days I ve tasted so much beautiful fish finger at any bar. (rating 10 on 10) 👌👌👌
3. Chicken pahari kebabs were also smooth, well cooked and perfectly matched with drinks. (rating 8 on 10) 👍👍👍
4. Vietnamese basa fish : This preparation is very carefully and perfectly made. You ll be delighted to have their fish items. (rating 10 on 10) 👍👍👍
5. Crispy chickens were very crispy,fresh and hot,you can easily understand they just cook it when you order. (rating 8 on 10) 👏👏👏
6. French Fries : I haven't tasted so much beautifully fried French fries ever in any bar. (rating 10 on 10) 👏👏👏

* Service : Service was fast and all items were hot. Service staffs are very well mannered and when one of my friends was keeping him asking about the preparation of any kind of item, he patiently was explaining with a smiling face. Perfect attitude. I liked this attitude so and so much. (rating 10 on 10) 👌👌👌

* Recommended : Any fish item....anything you take,those are lip smacking and fish finger is heavenly. I m not sure,but may be the main chef is very well trained in making fish items. Must be taken item is FISH FINGER. 👌👌👌

* FEEL BAD : I really felt very bad when all pubs around Go Where gets over crowded, then only people takes this pub as a NO WHERE TO GO,SO THIS option. The management should look after this, they should really do something for their promotion. I think this the best pub at sec 5 in all ways. ✌✌✌

I don't like to go to any bar. Once I had to join some of my Frnds in opium. All were smoking around us. But there was such system I didn't felt suffocation. I enjoyed with them with some French fries and cokes. My Frnds enjoyed beer. Had lots of fun.

We had visited Gowhere recently on Valentine's Day this year. This is situated in Sector V, Saltlake, just beside the Barbeque Nation. Easy to spot, this pub is one of its best because of the finger licking fish items that they serve and the incredibly low prices.
*SEATING ARRANGEMENT*
Well, this pub is of a compartmentalized nature. It has 4 compartments which can be entered one after the other, as they are situated inside each one of them. For eg, if you enter one compartment, there is a door through which you can enter the second compartment. Once you enter the second compartment, you have a door to enter the third compartment and the same repeats for the fourth compartment too. Each compartment has a seating capacity of around 50 people.
*AMBIENCE*
There is nothing much to talk of the ambience. There was no background music played. The place had adequate lighting. One thing that I would like the staff to give some attention to is the cleanliness of the place. I found that there was food and liquor bottles lying on the table, when we went for the table.
*FOOD*
Delving into the food talk, as I had mentioned before that this place is famous for its fish items, we opted for Crispy Fish. Since the item was unavailable, so we went for Fish Finger and Crispy Chicken. Both the items tasted delightful. Fish Finger especially won my heart, the fish used here was the Vietnamese Basa Fish, which was very carefully prepared and was crunchy.
Crispy Chicken had a crispy feel, as the name suggested, and it was finger licking good.
*STAFF BEHAVIOUR*
The staff was polite in behaviour and the service was quick and prompt. Hats off to that because there was a good crowd on that day, so they really handled it well.
*PRICES*
The prices of the items here was unbelievably low.. So it is always a good option when you are craving to visit a bar and want to go easy on your pockets.
I would give a rating of 4.5, as I feel cleanliness is a factor the staff really needs to work upon.Apart from that, this bar is definitely a go-go for all. :-)

This was the first restro I went to after getting my first salary in Sector 5, so a bit biased towards this one, like the tandoori chicken , food is good, service and décor is okay.

I have visited only once. All places were full and this was the last option. Service was okay but the main turnoff was smoking being allowed inside and there is no "no-smoking"  area. Hence if you are a non-smoker, stay away!

I've been to this place just once. It was 26th Oct'13. The entire Salt lake was floating. We looked for so many places around. Go Where was almost under renovation, still the staff let us sit in there and provided us Emergency Lights. It was one of the best outings I ever had with friends.

We go down here once in a while mainly to have a drink with buddies. Its near to office and conveniently placed, we even come across many friends or friendly people , its always nice to have a great conversation.

Food: Nothing special in terms of taste or make, we usually have kebabs or chrispy chili babat corn, schezwan paneer with lots of beer and few pegs of whisky . Food is not that costly but needs major improvement in the cookign department. Booze is moderately costly.

Service: Its understaffed clearly, they have a tough time on busy evenings and he staff is not helpful, they get tired of drunkards i guess

Ambiance: Typical bar ambiance, not too hygienic, they have a actual smoking room but its less than ill equipped, with less than a foot diameter exhaust fan for smoke filter.

Verdict: Can go here to have a few drinks on a reasonable price(compared to other of course). Not recommended for girls or dates.

Located at the ground floor of SYSTRON building, opposite to RDB, this pub is a neat, nice and descent place to hangout with your friends/colleagues over a few drinks. And importantly the pricing of the drinks are pretty reasonable, so it does not bore a hole in your pocket.
And so far my experience is concerned, me and my friends went there to spend some quality time over a few drinks on the eve of our convocation day after the ceremony(we  were students of UWSB and the convocation ceremony was held at EZCC auditorium). The pub was not crowded at all, and the ambience was so pleasing that we were enjoying each and every moment we spent there. Moreover the application of dim and colorful lights in the interior decor were creating a psychedelic effect which was making the ambience more and more mesmerizing. And adding up to it, there was a smoking zone inside the pub. So we never had to go outside to grab a fag. Staffs were polite, well behaved and efficient while providing service.
A pub worth visiting and it deserves a 5 star.

Saturday evening, long waiting at Opium, the name Go Where is suggested by a friend as a second choice. I had never been there and heard they have Happy hours on Ultra Max so I was naturally curious. The ambience was decent, nicely lit and English rock posters hanging around. Sadly the music being played was very disappointing. Drinks were served promptly but the food service was slow. We ordered 2 non veg starters Drums of Heaven and Roast Chilly Chicken. What came was not what we pictured in our mind what the food will be like. They have their own version of all items on menu. The taste was okayish, a bit bland. We ordered another chicken starter but the taste further detoriated so we cudnt finish it. Overall an OK second string place.

Hate spending Big Bucks, u will Love this place. The ambiance has changed over the years, making it better. Food quality is not that pretty, but is somewhat ok. Waiters are cordial, at least for us (we 4 or 5 who were regular for our Eristoff or Baccardi Black sets), they have always been so. Cheap liqueur, excellent Mutton Keema, Smoking provision, what more can you ask for. Most importantly, the place is never overcrowded, which allows you to enjoy your drinks and spend some quality time. 

PS: The washroom was and still is horrible, good that now they have a separate washroom for the Female guests. To cut short, Highly Recommended, if you aspire for cost effective merriment... Hic...  :)

A average restaurant cum bar. Food is average. Service is poor. Price is bit less compared to Opium or Hing. Smoking is allowed in the restaurant. There is a non-smoking part also. You will die suffocating if you sit where smoking is allowed. Unfortunately we went there 4-5 times. It is the only place you will get a table on a Friday evening.

One of the most pathetic places I have visited in Kolkata. A friend of mine is frequent and he suggested for a panchami get together here as they offer Jim Beam 1:1. The place is dirty including the sofas and the toilet is worst than a railway station one. Coming to the food, its very very ordinary. Mutton keema was good, crispy Chicken was literally dry, the fish fingers were good but the pepper chicken was burnt. Portions are also small. They lacked staff and the captain who was attending owing to absence of waiters was extremely rude. When he goofed up an order and we caught him, he went on to say 'you guys are drunk, not me so don't tell me'. This was terrible and I didn't even have alcohol while my friends were having. And they take last order at 10.15 pm. Overall very bad experience and will recommend avoiding.

N.B. the mosquitoes inside will give all very nice company.

I visit Go Where with my office colleagues, its a decent bar and the prices are good. They have a separate smoking room inside which is a plus point as one doesn't have to go outside to light up. The entrance is always under repair it seems. Order only starters here. We usually take crispy chicken or dry chili chicken. I would avoid having main courses here. But a pocket friendly place. I saw other reviews where some people have written that rowdy crowds come here, but I have visited 4 times here in the past 6 months and I have not faced any problems. ( Touch Wood) !!

" Go Here " Probably the most economical place you will find in sector V. Food is average, ambience is nice and cozy, waiters are well behaved. Its good that they have recently introduced a seperate smoking section as before one could smoke inside while drinking. They have renovated the place recently it seems however the biggest drawback is the toilets are extremely dirty filthy and stinking all the time.

Its quite a nice place to be. Maybe a little less happening but gives a cozy feeling. You can have a talk with the person accompanied. Food is alright nothing extra ordinary. We ordered tandoori rotis and paneer dish and tandoori chicken. Chicken was succulent and well marinated. Paneer was just normal like any other north indian food. Best part cheap alcohol and wide space to Chillax.

The most horrible experience in my life. I was like in a gas chamber of nazi concentration camp.. This happens when you allow smoking in a non ventilated closed room. 
Besides this the service is too bad. I had to beg for my drink... One good thing is the quality of the side dishes provided, which made our day.

This is one watering hole for the techies and students who frequent these localities. It often gets filled up when the waiting time outside Opium exceeds by leaps and bounds :) This is no doubt the second-choice bar-cum-restaurant in the area, since there is Opium in the vicinity which eclipses Go Where in almost every department except price, which can also be justified. Now let us delve deep into this review to check out the pros and cons of this place. Recently the interiors of the place has been renovated, specially the air conditioned non-smoking area. On certain days I have found this place to be absolutely empty at around 4PM when there is a long queue outside Opium which is just a few metres away operating in the same domain of the business. Often people get irritated after waiting for a long time outside Opium and settles down here at Go Where. But often there are male group of friends who comes straight to this place, and to them this is the first-choice only because of the price factor.

LOCATION ----- The place is located near RDB Boulevard where Barbeque nation is situated. You need to come to Saltlake Sector 5 and take the first right after SDF More while you are facing College More. After you take right you need to walk/drive a bit till you reach RDB Boulevard (BIG Cinemas), Go Where is located just beside this place, you may ask anyone if required after reaching this place.

AMBIANCE ----- The place has got a bit tattered entrance. As I was saying previously, the interiors have been revamped recently and the AC section now looks a lot better though the final finish is still not there which will boost that x-factor. The wooden finished walls now look really good, but they should next adorn few catchy posters. One large LED TV and pics of some musicians, rockstars, etc will add to the mood and ambiance of this joint. The temperature of the AC is comfortable and the washrooms are very close by, but they should be kept clean to keep attracting customers, specially the beer lovers who definitely use the washrooms. The place is dimly lit and it is really hard to click any pic without the flash, such darkness is suited while having the drinks but not when you are having food. Also the place needs some good music to be played, hopefully this new A.C. section will have all those features in near future. I would recommend to visit this place at around 4 PM to 6 PM because it mostly remains empty at that time. The non-AC section really has no ambiance and you might not feel that great if you sit there.

FOOD & PRICE ----- We have had multiple visits to this place and on few occasions the stress was strangely more on food, I wanted to try out their Chinese fare and I would say it was mediocre, goes well when you have some drinks along with you. The noodles are bit soggy at times, but they taste quite okay. The Chilli chicken is also nice to go with the noodles or fried rice. So if you wanna go for food at this place, then Chinese is a safe bet. When you are here at this place for couple of drinks you can go for starters, mutton preparations are good and my friends often prefer those. There is one down side when it comes to dry snacks that is provided with drinks, this place provides only groundnuts and you may get as many refills as you like; but then you will crave for Chickpea Flour Noodles / Bombay mix (chanachur) which is provided readily at other pubs/bars. Prices are really cheap here, especially for foreign liquors. Final bill has got tax component though.

SERVICE ----- This is one big negative for this place. The service is laid back, the waiters are not that prompt and is hard to interact with them as they prefer to stay busy in a dream world of their own! Couple of years back when there used to be a television at this place, they used to stand and watch the television and won’t even care if you are calling out for them or what is going on around them. Also during the afternoon/early evening hours if you visit this place you will find them sleeping on the couches in the non-AC section which at times is quite embarrassing for the guests! Overall the persons serving are pretty disorganized to say the least. 

OVERALL ----- Here are my granular ratings for this place:

Food quantity: 3.5/5
Food quality: 3.2/5
Ambiance: 3.2/5
Value for money: 3.5/5
Service: 2.7/5

Overall rating comes to around 3.2 out of 5 which will be rounded off to 3 out of 5 here. The place is surely a savior when lady luck denies you an entry to Opium or when you are short of cash but still want to let out the anger on your boss. If you want to just visit this place for a sumptuous meal or for your date then you are hitting a wrong place! This is one of the cheapest places of its kind in Saltlake Sector-5, but then you need to judge yourself when you want to visit it and with whom :)

Cheers!

Take your girl friend / female friends there and you are screwed for life 

Go there for lunch & dinner and you are screwed for life 

BUT ..... BUT .........FOR ALL GUY GANGS  ........ whether it be college gangs or after-office fun time gangs ........there is no cheaper place than GO-Where  in sector 5 ....

in order to get optimum / maximum benefit  from  Go-Where you have to  follow certain guidelines ............ let me list them 

1) WHEN TO GO :    3PM to 6pm ( afternoon to early evening ) 

Why ???? : because  NO ROWDY crowd NO RUSH  during this period  .... Also you get the best seat of the house 

2) WHAT TO ORDER IN DRINKS  :  Imported beer pints ( Hoeggarden , Sol beer & stella artois beer ) ......... usually avaible in AFTERNOON but not during PEAK RUSH HOUR ( after 6 PM ) 

JIm Beam & jack Daniel's in Hard-drinks  ( american / bourbon Whisky ) 

3) WHAT TO ORDER IN FOOD :   Mutton & Mutton only ...... From mutton keema  in starters  to Mutton rogan josh with peas pulao or Naan . One can also try prawn & fish ..................... Chicken is A NO NO here .

4 ) HOW TO GET DISCOUNTS : Call them up before reaching to check availability  Of IMPORTED DRINKS ( THIS IS A MUST DO FOR ALL ) .

Now Coming to My experience : reached there 1.30 pm in afternoon today  with a friend 

Checked with them beforehand to know that here is an 1:1 offer on JIM BEAM ( MOST POPULAR BOURBON WHISKY IN AMERICAN WEST ) 

therefore  ordered TWO large pegs ( 60 Ml Each ) of JIM BEAM .........price 220 for TWO ...............i.e Rs 110/ 60 ml  each .......... I asked them How they can sell JIM BEAM BELOW COST PRICE ??? .......... COST PRICE is  160 Rs / 60 ml PEG ............. the answer was prompt .............. JIM BEAM is one of the sponsers of the BAR ............. I Got Suspicious ........... Asked them to bring the JIM BEAM bottle before serving .......... They did Just that ............. They Brought a NEW  SEALED bottle of JIM BEAM ............... I checked the Bottle ........... PURE AUTHENTIC JIM BEAM SEAL ....They opened the Seal & served in front of me ............. ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC .....................Why should I  Care WHO is the SPONSOR ....... as long as I get Authentic Bourbon BELOW COST PRICE ??? ............ couldn't care less ................ I was in seventh Heaven after this ............

It was a couple of days back when a group of us just finished watching a movie at RDB and were hungry enough. Go Where is located right opposite to RDB beside kwality walls kiosk. It has undergone a full changeover with neon lights hovering and wooden walls. Looks really great. We ordered a couple of beers to start and afghani chicken with semi gravy to start with. Next we ordered chilli chicken and that too tasted delicious. It's budget friendly and the quality is good enough. Worth a try.

Located just opposite to RDB, this place attracts sizeable crowd from the IT firms nearby. Upon entering, you might feel like you're in one of those shabby bars that they show in films. Ambience isn't really the strong point for this joint. An ideal place to hang out and chill with your friends... not a good place to take your date  along with you. The food is pretty average and heavy on oil. So if you're looking for a bar where you can have a gala time with your friends and get drunk... this is the place for you. Pro - Unlike it's neighbor Opiumm this one allows you to smoke inside.

Not a cozy place to hang out over a drink, emphatically not recommended if you are with your girl/ boy friend or close friends. The interior will give you some 'Chandni Bar' kinda feelings. The interior and staffs are equally disordered. Nothing much to say about food, its just like 'at least' something to gulp after some pegs. Only recommended for budget conscious people.

Drinks well that's makes u feel like a real man..I had 3+3 combo white rum and I was just getting in the mood
I wanted to burn the place down with their own alcohol but couldn't. .It was pumped to such a degree of dilution that the water was hindering the fire..

Cheapest booze in Sector 5.

Located opposite to RDB, this place offers booze at a low price compared to other bars in the locality. Ambience is average, sofas are mostly torn. They allow smoking so this place is popolar among smokers, and a pain for non smokers. Although they have a non smoking section, it is small. Service is really slow. Waiters are friendly.

Although booze is cheap here, sometimes all the items on menu are not available. Ideal place to booze, smoke and let loose. Sometimes they give offers like buy two get one drink free. Starters like dragon chicken, dry chili chicken, chicken drum stick etc are good! I really like their huge cheese nuns. Main course is average. So if you are in for good amount of boozing then this is a good place. Dont visit for food only.

Go Where is located opposite to RDB cinemas in Sector-5..This is perhaps the cheapest bar in the locality..Normally when we are low on cash or don't find a seat at Opium we would usually end up at Go Where..Cheap booze with regular average food at pocket-friendly rates and long hours of conversation marks the importance of this place..
Coming to the ambiance, it is really shabby and dimly lit with blue lighting..the sofas are mostly torn,though last time I visited there was some renovation work going on..The hygeine issues is one of the biggest disadvanatge..Also inspite of being air-conditioned they allow smoking inside which makes the atmosphere really unpleasant for non-smokers like me..Do try to get a seat in the inside room..still better but not apt for family visit..The service is pathetic to say the least..Firstly you have to ask the servers to serve drinking water,then to clean the table and wait for long to place your orders..
Coming to the food just decent enough with your booze,don't visit this place solely for food..Still the starters are better..quantity is generous..Pepper Fish, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Kalimirich or Lat Me Kai Chicken taste better..In the main course I would say their Chinese tastes better than their Indian spread..Try their Thai or Sinapore Fried Rice..However all the items are not available all the times making your choice limited..Also major brands of Beer are not available all the time,making it worse..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 5/5
Service: 1.5/5
Ambiance: 1/5

They deliver on what they promise - the cheapest bar of salt lake where there is no bar on smoking. This alters the picture posted here of the place as it is possible to find cigarette stubs on the cushy seats and even burnt holes on sofas. But the drinks are served fast, and the non-veg fare is pretty good. Vegetarians have very little choice in main course. 
The staff takes time to warm up to you, and they seem to know their limitations in what food and beverages they can offer. But for a pub, the biggest downside is that there is no music playing. If you go there, go for the cheap booze - if you are a tankard, the bill is easy on your pocket.

Food quality is too good except few starters like Tangri kabab. Main course food tastes awesome. It is idol place for smokers and drinkers. The place is one of the best at month ends as it is pocket friendly. But the service is never meet the expectations. There is nothing kept in ambience. 

Still I will suggest to try this place for its delicious food.

located just opposite to rdb cinema, sector 5, it's the place you are looking for if you want to spend a friday evening having fun with friends over few drinks and want to relax after office stress.

this is a no fuss bar/restaurant with absolutely ordinary decor. from outside it might look like a small joint but inside they have 2 big halls which can accommodate at least 40 customers at a time. they have lot of tables with comfy sofa which can seat 4 per table. if needed, they join tables to accommodate bigger groups.

alcohol here is cheaper than the competition around. plus, they often run various offers, e.g. we got 1:1 on jim beam @ rs.220, so one 60ml peg of the whiskey effectively got priced at rs.110 only. now that's an awesome deal i must say!

coming to food, we had chicken tikka kabab, tengri kabab as well as chilli chicken. these are basic items and i found they prepare tandoori items better than the chinese items. both the kebabs were served hot with big pieces of chicken and they were very tasty. chilli chicken was a bit too dry to my liking.

service was ok, nothing to complain about. they were quick to bring our orders to table. and, no complaints here as well.

overall, it's a good place if you don't care about the decor. otherwise, it's perfect for a budget evening to be spent with friends.

It is the Oly Pub of Sector 5.

Food: Standard taste. Good enough to go with the very affordable drinks available in here. Most of the times they give good offers on drinks. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: Do not expect a great ambience. They have not invested on fancy decors or lightings. They just provide you a decent sofa and a table where you can have a gala time with your friends and not dig a hole in your pocket. People openly smoke in it. But be sure, the crowd is not cheap... Mainly you will find there office-goers chilling after office hours. I rate it 3/5.

Service: Extremely high in demand so pretty low in speed. You have to literally shout to grab the waiter's attention. But never mind that as long as they keep those attractive offers going. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Lower than most restaurant cum bars with a decent crowd. That's its USP.

Overall I rate it 3.5/5.

One of the reasonably priced and crowded bars of the Sector 5 area,of Salt Lake City.
It is the ideal place for the College goers and the regular office workers who work tirelessly the whole week and like to crash on Friday evenings.

The interiors is nothing to be boasted about but the ambience is pretty good compared to the other bars of that area. Most of the times I would opt for the Opium Bar(which is almost right next door),but the crowd of Go Where Bar draws me even more.

Having been to a lot of pubs and bars across India,I still believe that bars in Kolkata should start thinking on how to expand the menu when it comes to liquors.
Of course over here you get almost everything from Budweiser to Heineken,from Chivas to Old Monk,and the happy hours is simply the best.
For the food one may find it stereotype and a little unpleasant, but you can settle with the tandoori kebabs/chicken noodles for a change.

Only problem with this place is it keeps getting noisier in the evening and first timers may have an unpleasant experience over here.Even I have seen at times that noisy groups throw around food and litter the place.The Management should be even more vigilant and take steps to put a 'no-no' against all such nonsense.

I used to be a regular at this place in my college days where we gossiped for 8 hours on a stretch,and in those days the bar was also quite good.We have had tequila shots over here quite often.
All in all this place needs a makeover now and lots of things need to be changed in order to keep up with the steep market competition.

This place is located in Sector 5 salt lake, and it did not create much of an impression on me. The only good thing I can say about this place is drinks are cheap compared to other places nearby. The food is average and the ambience is more or less fine. But what I didn't like is the service. Its horrible, the first time I had to wait for 40 mins to get the order of drinks. Overall its an average place where you want to drink and your are short on cash. the give some offers at times, but if you are looking for a great ambience, I would not suggest this place.

This is the perfect substitute for oly pub! The only thing-  you will not find beef steak!  I went with my friends after office and ended up hogging more than drinking. The booze was cheap compared to other places in that area. But the food was even better. We ordered for 
Fish Finger
Pepper chicken
Dry Chilli chicken
Szechuan chicken
garlic chicken
dragon chicken

We also ordered for tandoori rotis just to fill ourselves up! 

Service: Its a bit slow. 

Ambiance: There is a smoking zone and and a non smoking zone. The sofas and the seats are pretty comfortable. So u can relax and enjoy ur drink and meal. Perfect place to vent out ur stress after a tough day at office

One of the places in sector which remains a full house even in weekday evenings! Thanks to their low cost food bites and happy hours for alcohol.
Firstly ambiance is baad and dingy, the lighting is blue or low yellow making it difficult for most to see that the sofas are torn and tables are not clean.
Coming to service: The waiters behave as if they have more important work than answering to your calls but once they do the food / drink is served aptly.
Crowd: The crowd that you most certainly are to encounter is of drunk people or about to get drunk people. If you meet with any altercation or rude  people think it is normal.
Food is average -- dry chilli chicken or reshmi kebabs seems okay at first and good after a peg or two :P Once went for lunch the quantity was good , taste pretty pretty average!(like jhoops only)
Drink: Whenever I went they had happy hours for something or the other, whether bacardi rum 1:1 or smirnoff 1:1, the beers are always served chill to my friends' liking.
The restrooms can be pretty disgusting at times( as per men say) for women it is quite clean (owing it to lesser women crowd there)
Visit when you are low on cash but want to enjoy, definitely have a group of people to tag along with.

Only thing I dint like about the place is its interior. If you plan to go out for a romantic outing this is not the place then. But if you are in a mood to hang out with your friends and go high on drinks and food then it is one of the finest place in the city

Whenever I am at IIP with friends and we feel like doing 'adda', a question pops in our mind, 'Where should we go?' and the answer is GO WHERE! Jokes aside, this is our go to place for beer and passing time. Crispy Chili Baby Corn and Chili Chicken are a must have everytime. Ambiance is nice...waiters are courteous...good place to have a few drinks with friends. Fun story : This one time we were hanging out there and a mountain bike was displayed in front of the bar area that could be won. You got one entry coupon for every *forgot the brand* beer you ordered. There were 4 of us and we ended up drinking 16 in total and one was not a drinker. Never won the bike.

This place is recommended for only a group of boys who have come to only booze-- drink like a hell paying less--if you have this in your mind than only visit this place, otherwise avoid it.
Firstly ambiance is of too inferior quality--the sofas are torn and you may have to come across intoxicated insane people , so rude and loud.
Coming to service, the waiters will only attend to regular customers with whose faces they are familiar.
Food is not good--many starters only we had there--but all worthless.
And what I disliked there were those white-collared job holders--they are so decent outside and behave like a person without backbone infront of managers of clients, the same people will be like ba**** inside the restaurant causing commotion.
The restrooms are equally unhygienic  and for that solely responsible are those people coming inside.
The management should restrict the entry of people and kick them out those insane who does not know their limitations of drinking.

It's Friday night where you need to go.? It's GO WHERE. It's seems like question but it should be your answer. Hanged out here couple of times with my friends. Very cheap bar reasonable price. 2+1 (60ml)offer is special here for hot drinks. About the place two areas one with smoking and another without smoking. Who sees interior and Ambiance in bar, if so then you have to find it here because I don't find any here very very noisy and dark in smoking area. The service is very worst on coming days with us because they remember their customers who keeps higher tips too. About food tandoori and hot garlic chicken is best try it.

You cannot find a bar this cheap in sector 5(when you are surrounded by shimmers, xoxo, troya etc)....opium and hing was crowded and so decided to check dis out...
Pros: Price is too much pocket friendly
Convenient service even on a friday afternoon(dont kno weather i was lucky coz other reviews say sumthin else)
Cons: Ambience is below average, can even rate it minus
Food quality can b good, but they use the same sauce n spices in every other preparation.
Verdict: Heaven for college students, corporates can think twice

Actually this is the place to have 'MAAL' with friends as they have the comfy sofas where you can just sit back and relax and have your drink.
Coming to the food, I can't comment much on that as I only had starters here. But out of all the starters I slightly prefer Chicken lat mat kai...which you can try. Although its nothing great!
Service is little disappointing but this is expected from a budget bar!

Even though it don't look that great and it's not that fancy but this is where we used to let it all out and shout and bitch.
Affordable and the food is pretty good too.
But most of all its great for bunking classes.

If you are a regular drinker, and are on a budget, this is the place to be. The booze here is very cheap and when I say very, I mean VERY! They have this offer of 2+1 on Bacardi white rum, so you get 2+1 large pegs for Rs. 220 plus taxes! The food here is pretty decent. Having said that, the service is pathetic. You have to wait for upto half an hour on a busy night before the waiter even takes your order, but then for prices like these, you wouldn't exactly be expecting a royal treatment!
All in all, you get what you pay for. Period.

Went there on a friend's recommendation. Was a lazy tuesday afternoon around 2.15pm by which time the lunchtime of Sector V was over. So we entered to a deserted place. Sat down on a sofa.
Pros :
1. Service was good
2. Food was nice
3. Drinks were cheap

Cons :
1. Too dark.
2. Bathrooms smelly

Overall a nice restaurant. And might as well add very cheap.
Verdict : One visit is must. After that is your choice. I would surely revisit

This is not the same place that it used to be since I first went there. Ambience is below average, food.is average, service is pathetic. This is one of those places where the waiters are repulsive mainly because of their arrogant and careless attitude. The place is bit too shady, with torn sofas and wet patches on the walls. The only good thing is that it provides a buy 2 get 1 free offer on vodkas and white rum. So unless you want to get sloshed with those, this is not the place to be.

Drinks and ice-creams are really good. The Hyderabadi Murgh Rolls are good too.

Tried this joint for lunch back in 2010 and landed up w/ infection. Avoiding lunch/dinner since then.

Its a shady joint. As you walk in you are welcomed by a fowl smell, very shabby appearance, it was dirty so did not even have the guts to try the food here.

it reminds you of the olypub that used to be but with better decor and friendlier staff. the food is good. only problem like olypub is that all brands are not available. but they make up with the offers they have. a place that can be frequented...

Food and Drink: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

This is my one of the favorite place to hangout with friends and colleagues near my office at Salt Lake sector 5 just in front of Big Cinema entrance. They serve drinks and multi cuisine foods. Drinks are real cheap here, literally cheap. During weekends this place becomes too crowded with people coming from their office to quickly grab a table. Visit during the early hours of evening and you might be lucky enough to get a table for yourself or else you end up standing in waiting queue.

Ambiance is nice  and dimly lit with couches to relax and enjoy the drink. They have a big TV in the middle of the room too in case you don't wanna miss a ball of cricket match.

Food is really good and reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in that area. Try their "TENGRI KEBAB", it's just awesome for just 150 bucks 4pc in a plate. Also try crispy chilly potato and baby corn. They have a wide range of desi and videshi liquor including premium scotch whiskey. They always have some offer going on for liquor to attract their customers. Service is average and you can't really complaint because of huge number of orders. They serve drinks immediately but food takes a long time. Over all this is an ideal place to chillax and have a break after a long tired week.

located exactly opposite to RDB Big Cinemas this place offers drinks at amazing prices. bacardi white rum costs around 120 per peg n an amazing 2:1 offer ensures 3 pegs of rum for 250..a similar 1:1 offer on eristoff ensures 2 pegs of vodka for 110. 1 thing I don't know is whether they have tequila. n they should try to include basic cocktails. but for the prices they offer, this can be excused. n the food is quite good. lastly u can smoke inside, which is good. love the place

In sector 5 behind RDB boulevard, this place is located quite conveniently. Been to this place couple of times with my friends. Its a great place to hangout with friends. Cheap drinks - they offer 1:1 on Eristoff and 2:1 on certain other drinks! and great food along with it too. What else do you want. I'd be coming here again and again!

A brilliant place, an amazing place. Good food and cheap drinks, what more could you ask for ? I have been here many times and loved it always. The food menu offers a lot of choices and the food is really well prepared. The Black Pepper Chicken is one of note. The drinks are probably the real attraction, and you get most domestic brands at real good prices. Also, there are offers like 1:1 or 2:1 on Eristoff Vodka or Bacardi White Rum. You could try this out with your friends, you wont be disappointed.
