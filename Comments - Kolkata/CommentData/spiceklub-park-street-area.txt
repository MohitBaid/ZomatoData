Spice klub is a vegetarian restaurant serving varieties of north indian dishes . I tried their hot selling dishes n drinks like Cheese Rumali , Three flavours of mushroom, hara bhara kebab  i also tried their famous tomato soup . Masala mojito is a good drink to go with starter . In main course i tried paneer tikka Masala with Masala kulcha it was yummy guys . The best part was trying Volcano which is a gastronomic chocolate cake and is also one of their hot selling desert . They also serve you chocolate paan for free üòÄ sounds great Overal .........
Food is delicious 
Ambience is perfect 
Staffs are friendly .....

After a long time had a different experience in food presentation and style - Different Molecular themed foods.
Service too is good and quick. 
1) Roomali roti Pappad - Its with cheese
2) Vada Pav - Molecular spice, Masala is liquid and not the normal solid one which is amazing to eat & light - with different types of Chutneys to try upon. 
3) Soap cake - it's a soap based dessert for chocolate. 
4) Dahi kebab- The Dahi is molecular sitting on top of Tikka , totally amazing in taste and style

Super innovative and delicious dishes. The appetisers were too good. Highly recommended are: vada pao, dahi kebab(with a pop of hung curd), nanza and rumali roti papad. They serve 7 different dips with the appetisers which are superb. Among the desserts : bubbling kulfi with 5 different syrups which was crazy. The best part was the staff was very courteous to explain each dish and how to eat each of them. Mr. Prashant was my server and he did a fantastic job to enlighten with the minute of details. Worth spending an evening here over delicious food and warm staff with your loved ones.

Excellent food. Every dish ordered was unique and extraordinary and at the same time it was exciting to see new ways of presenting a dish. Pav bhaji fondue, Papri chaat, Vada pav are a must to be ordered and for beverages -mango on the rock, seasonal lassi, kala katha mojito. And not to forget for deserts -soap cake and bubbling kulfi. Overall it was a lovely experience.

Awsome presentation of simple foods. First we ate with our eyes then we actually ate. The innovative Ness and the uniqueness quotent was so high that you actually don't notice the little aberrations in tastes. The menu is as innovative as it's presentations. All traditional Indian dishes are presented in such a a beautiful and unique way that someone actually need to tell you that this is chole kulche. Quantity is ok and quality is good. Service and courtsey of staff excellent. Giving 4.5 because there is always a scope for improvement.

The woman at the service desk is so incompetent. It took her 2 hours to give us a table, because she clearly couldn't handle the crowd at the restaurant. She was so confused that she didn't know how to give out the tables and people who came after got place before we did. I would recommend that if you are going here to eat then reserve a table in advance or else you'll wait and waste your time. Therefore, even if the food may be great and all that, such incompetent staff really can make the experience quote wasteful and not worth the wait time.

This place is a heaven for vegetarians. Situated in Park Street amongst an array of other eating joints, it's a happy change from the usual old school dishes. We tried around 5 different starters and each of them had an innovative twist, be it presentation or the preparation as whole. Vada Pao, Naanza, Hara Bhara kabab, Dahi Kabab and paneer tikka, everything was simply WOW. The portions were also generous. But the highlight of our meal was the desert, Bubbling Kulfi.. This place is a must try.

So this was my first time at Spice klub and when I entered the place it was lovely ...a perfect family destination.
Everyone from the team was so helpful and ready at your service.
Food was fantastic, quantity perfect (if you are a group of six this place is perfect for you)
The part which I really liked was every dish was served with a little description which gives you the knowledge of what are you eating exactly with it's speciality.
Keep up the good work.
My order-
Roomali Cheese Papad - 9/10
Galoti Kebab - 9/10
Paneer Lapeta - 9/10

The food really does justice to the tag line-street food with a twist. Their desserts are particularly lovely & delightful. The service, however was not very impressive. Had to switch table thrice & the staff was not even apologetic. The server kept on insisting to order a particular dessert when i had already told him I‚Äôm not considering recommendations. Also, a bit more pricey than comparable restras in the park street area.

Each and every dish be it starters, main course or he dessert was very well presented. Just by looking at the dish the hunger bone went on a rampage. Very well explained by the person who was serving the dishes. Very calm ambience at the heart of park street. This restaurant was the best thing that happened to us on our Anniversary. I highly recommend it to all. Go and explore this place for a gastronomical adventure.

Spice Klub, Your food and service were much premium from my expectations, you have set a level for veg restaurants and molecular gastronomic food in Kolkata. 
The service the staff the courtesy everything was just promising and welcoming. Definitely a double thumbs up for it. 

Now coming to food : We ordered
1)  Roomali Cheese Papad - WOW for the concept and the cheesy fusion. 
2) Vada Pav - This is one of the best molecular dish i have tasted, the tikki in mousse form or the cooked plastic which surprised me more its hard to say. 
3) Paneer Tikka - Nicely Cooked with the minty foam for the touch. 
4) Naanza -  Was Good, can expect more in upcoming days.
 
 In main course Its hard to find a lip smacking Dal Makhani and Spice Klub proved its worth with the Dal ‚ù§Ô∏è and also the Chilli cheese garlic naan

Keep up the good work!

Before visiting this restraunt better research abt molecular Gastronomy food ,in which they specialise, or else you would feel like a fool in front of the waiter who would keep boasting abt it (it's a bit annoying). Anyways, the restraunt has an interesting concept and I would say you should try once atleast (don't shy away frm spending or else it will be worthless). For me the desert -snow ball- was the main attraction it tested good, looked grt and was worth the money they charge .

This was my 2nd visit to the Park Street outlet. It's always lovely to be here. The food totally rocks. The ambience , subtle and cosy , adds to the attraction of this place.
What I absolutely love about Spice Klub is the service. The staff are so friendly and prompt , you definitely get a homey-vibe here. They have complete knowledge of what they are serving , what goes best with what. The place wants you to give them the control of your taste buds. Trust them to surprise you.
No alcohol and pure vegetarian , is a plus point for family outings and you realize veg food can be so much fun. The presentation kicks the ball out of the park. New and different experiences are what we live for so molecular gastronomy with food should be on one of your bucket lists.
Whatever I had here, be it the 8 delectable chutneys, Naanza, Pav-bhaji fondue, Roomali Cheese papad, Paneer lapeta, Coconut water with caviar, main course , desserts all were so delicious. I think I will end up recommending the whole menu. The Papads of India and the complementary pan chocolate is lip-smacking too.
Let Spice Klub spice up your taste buds,ignoring the hole it burns in your pocket. Well I am surely visiting again!

Went here on a friends recommendation and without a doubt it was good.
They serve tonic water instead of the regular one which is definitely not a usual practice.
We tried the Romali papad, vada pao, dahi kebab, hazari panner tikka for starters.
The server told to skip the main course and it was like any regular restaurant and try the drinks and dessert straight away.
For drinks, the coconut water with assorted caviar was quite different from the others at it was in sorbet form with rose caviar.
The only disappointing dish was the dahi kebabs which was not as good as the other dishes.
Also, we didn‚Äôt try the desserts as there was no space left in our stomach.

It was my sister's birthday when we decided to have family dinner at SpiceKlub which a friend highly recommended.

Entering to a Simple and poised ambience, we took the seat straight to entry to the last row where we could see the park Street main road vehicles movement. We were served detox water which was quite surprising and interesting idea (personally I am too fond of it so a great start for me already).

Coming to food which is the important and the best part. We ordered their popular Rumali roti papad with cheese, which was a super hit specially for kids.
For starters we had 1) Paneer Lapeta - treat for a paneer lover the most intriguing part was it's presentation (picture added) 2) Naanza - super soft naan with cottage cheese amazingly good for my taste buds, a must have item.

For main course we had 1) Masala Kulcha which itself was a dish to me I loved it's stuffing 2) Kali daal, 3) Malai Kofta and 4) Classic Paneer sabzi all were apt as it should be with unique style of presentation.

Now comes my favourite part of the dinner i.e. Deserts, we ordered Bubbling Kulfi which was rock served with five different toppings namely blueberry, caramel, srikhand, rose and Belgium chocolate. We were very well explained about how to have this kulfi due to its unique rocky element with disclaimer that we should not have it directly. We are suppose to a mix our desired topping/sauce a with the kulfi and then have it says the staff, also he recommend to have Belgium chocolate at the end to have best in the last which was very very much true though *I am braised to dark chocolates* but other family members also agreed with me.

During the whole dinner experience we were well attended or I would say personal attendance was given inspite of the rush, glasses were filled before we could even ask. Service was quick and staffs were well mannered and trained.

At the end the end our bill arrived with complimentary pan flavoured chocolate.

The only thing one could at all say, "may be" on the pocket pinch but trust me it's all worth it at the end.
I am definitely looking forward to visit the place again.

Thank you for the great experience.

My second visit (on my parents anniversary) was as good as the first one.. tried few different dishes like Palak soup (amazing), kadhi soup (typical homemade kadhi taste), tamato soup (Okish) , fried onion with peas and corn rice (nice flavour), puchka (unique presentation but I missed aloo mix they served moong mix instead), kadhai paneer and THE SOAP CAKE - super amazing treat for my taste buds it's dark chocolate super dark (my favourite) attractive to watch in soap shape and size with malai foam, the inside was so very soft and perfect in taste. 
Thank you for the great experience for the second time too.

The first thing that strikes you as soon as you enter is the smiling faces of all the Servers.We took a corner table overlooking the main road which was quite nice. We started off by ordering the cheese rumali papad Which is actually a rumali Roti turned into a crisp papad with cheese onions and green chilies on top. We really loved this dish. we also had their signature Vada pao which is simply awesome. We didn‚Äôt quite like the dahi ke kebab. Interesting factor was the staff making us explain the Correct way of eating the special items

The food is truely amazing. Perfect use of molecular science. The Vada pav is a must must have. Pav bhaji fondu, chola kulcha, dahi ke kabab, cheese papad everything above Ur expectations. Service is a lil slow. But I guess it was worth it.
N last but not the least there mouth fresher which is a pan chocolate will for sure take Ur breath away...
Can't wait to visit again n explore another bunch of recipes. üòä

Out of the world experience! Shekhar Chakraborty greeted us as if we were there to attend a wedding as baraati. He explained the contents of the menu in such a manner that we were gastronomically excited to try their range of molecular gastronomical items. To start with... The appetising drink possibly Iceberg (the name of the drink) was mind blowing where one literally has to break the ice to bring out the drinkand  add in house soda to make the drink fizzy. The Rumali converted Cheese Papad was the next bombshell which was excellent followed by Cream filled veg galauti kababs associated with fried spinach and green sauce with caviar (vegetarian). We were too full to try anything else but couldn't resist trying the Bubbling Kulfi prepared at ( - )196¬∞C and served with several sauces to give it separate tastes all of them being excellent. Rose Caviar Sauce, Rabdi Sauce, Belgian Chocolate sauce, etc to name a few with complementary add on fill up. We were floored by the hospitality too. It's a MUST TRY VEG RESTAURANT. Please don't miss the opportunity of being there and enjoy the hospitality of Shekhar and team while satiating the gastronomical appetite.

A well deserved 5-point rating. We knew we were in for a culinary feast as soon as we saw the first item on our order being served. 

We had ordered for a Rumali Cheese Papad, Paneer Lapeta, Dal Makhani, Methi Malai Matar, Paneer Moti and an assortment of Indian breads. 

The presentation and preparation was excellent and we were duly explained the molecular gastronomy techniques for each preparation. 

Our meal ended with the signature Bubbling Kulfi which comprised of deconstructed kulfi frozen at sub-zero temperatures given with a variety of dips such as Salted Caramel, Rose Caviar, Blueberry, Rabri, Chocolate, to name a few. 

A bit steep on the pocket but totally worth every penny paid. Cheers to the management! :)

If you want to learn about food, and enjoy a meal with fill enjoyment then you should definitely visit this place. Something very new they have in there menu. Things recommended by there people were absoluetly great and tasted very well. 
Things we had:-
1. Vada paw- amazing in presentation and tasted exactly like vada paw. 

2. Paw bhaji fondue-  I really didn't had to chew the vegetables,the whole thing was completely in liquor format with a true fast of paw bhaji. And to enjoy it further they give a good amount of crispy bread on the side.

3. Panner lapeta- it had green chutney marination with a sphere that should burst/pop inside your mouth. Good one again.

4. Cheese papad- Amazing to look at and heavenly in taste. 

5. Ice sphere- very refreshing.

6. Kokum magrita- spicy,tangy, chilly. Good.

7. Fruit lassi- 6shorts with different flavour. Very different.

8.  Mango on the rocks- pure heavenly mango lovers made for. 

9. Main course - good again, not much to present, but tasted good. 

10. Bubbling kulfi/soap cake/pan mousse. (DO NOT MISS)

P.S - The thing which was really amazing was they have not explained much in there menu about the food, and after getting it explained by there staff I got it why. Very well trained. 

Had a great time and looking forward to visit there much soon.

tl;dr - excellent place. Do try at least once. 

Full version:
Very very few times I will say this for any food serving place ever in my life - Forget about the high price and the almost sloppy service and the plain interiors of this place; go to this place for the concept! The concept of fusing cooking and presentation techniques in modern world cuisine, with the mind boggling diversity of spices, flavours and textures of Indian Food. The theatrics of liquid nitrogen with your mango kulfi being made from oh-so-good fresh alphonso juice/syrup frozen right infront of your eyes with smoke coming out! The refinement in the presentation of green and red chilli "caviar" on your humble bharwan stuffed tandoori aloo. The extremely subtle and delicate hit of saffron foam on top of your kesari paneer tikka. The childish playfulness of the chhola kulcha burgers. The added texture of crunchiness introduced by means of a bed of "soil" under your snow globe dessert. Molecular gastronomy is understanding the concept of taste, smell, sights, textures and flavours of various ingredients and putting it all together to stimulate your senses providing an out of the world eating experience. We Indians have had it easy with our thousands of years old recipes of the various masalas and whatnot bombarding our tastebuds with a lot of clashing yet synchronizing flavours and smells, instead of western cuisine where they are generally more complementary and bland. In this day and age of Masterchef and the likes, these guys have taken our very general, humble Indian dishes and modernized the entire damn thing to the next level of drama.

I really wanted to bash and troll them in this review for the amount of frills they have introduced to simple dishes like tandoori aloo, and charged us a bomb for it. But two days after eating here I figured that most of their dishes were flawless in terms of the taste. Their chhole is out of the world and eating it was an extremely satisfying experience - I think their chhole won me over. It would not be fair trashing them for something I should be giving them credit for. I probably wouldn't go here regularly for my weekend restaurant dinner binge but I would definitely come here every chance I get to show this place off to all my vegetarian outstation guests.

Only negative was our server was a blabbering, blumbering idiot. Also they should really just serve Bislery or Aquafina packaged water instead of some Kim Kardashian-Paris Hilton-esque "premium Himalayan spring water" which I feel is the biggest scam of our lifetimes.

The best thing I liked about this place was the special Gobi ki sabzi and the lachcha paratha papad or nachos. Apart from that, everything else just had a fancy name. In monetary terms this place is on slightly expensive side and the menu does not justify the price. Just by adding a "spice klub speciality" statement, the price can't be Increased.
Also the waiter Incharged was a bit annoying.

Travelled to kolkata after a long interval of time and happy to see that so much has changed and it has so many new things to offer.
This is truly a game changer and foodie's paradise to be in most importantly if you are a vegetarian - YES this is a pure veg restro.

First of all it provides Valet parking - a big plus for the travellers. The entrance is a bit clumsy and dim and it is situated at the first floor - need not worry as escalator service is provided.¬†

The space is medium size enough to accommodate around 60-75 people at one go.¬†
We ordered Paw Bhaji Fusion and then a Paneer Tikka . Both were quite different from the traditional taste. Paw bhaji had a lot of cheese and the paw were cut into small bits. We were provided long forks to dip the paw bits to the bhaji and enjoy our supper.¬†

The provided Paneer Tikka - Our mistake we told them to make the spicy panner even more spicy so it burned our mouth with a lot of green chilli in it. They also provide around 6-7 different sauces with them which can be added as per requirements.¬†

The food we ordered was paneer dumplings and malai kofta - both of which had traditional Indian taste with finely filled gravy. The roti / naan were served in attractive vessels which made them look a little different and attractive.¬†

The service was very good and they kept on guiding us about the different type of servings they could offer and the difference between normal food and their food - this made the food even more exciting.¬†

If you are in kolkata - DO NOT give this place a miss. It's hot it's happening.

The presentation of food was good. But the service was pathetic and the staffs were ill mannered. Even the taste of the food was not that great. In between your food ; they offer you the finger bowl and surprisingly they don't look after the service once the order is placed.

The best thing I liked about this place was the special Gobi ki sabzi and the lachcha paratha papad or nachos. Apart from that, everything else just had a fancy name. In monetary terms this place is on slightly expensive side and the menu does not justify the price. Just by adding a "spice klub speciality" statement, the price can't be Increased.
Also the waiter Incharged was a bit annoying.

This place is THE place if you want to have awesome and innovative food. 
The place offers normal food modified into something spectacular by molecular gastronomy. 
We ordered:
Coconut caviar- those rose caviars on the top of the frozen coconut water looked so pretty. 
Mango on the rocks- this tastes heavenly. With real alphonso mangoes. 
Cheese Rumali Papad-who would have thought a rumali roti and a papad could be combined with cheese to form something this cool. 
Vada Paw- i have probably never had vada paws better than this. And It is a must try. 
Dahi ke kebab- another presentation of their talent- spheres of dahi was the eye-catcher. Tastes really good.
Naanza- a combo of naan and pizza. Awesome in taste.
Chhole bhature- eye catcher was mint foam and the burger style in which it was served in. And tasted really very well. 
Paan mousse- a must try for people who love paan
Bubble kulfi- an awesome dessert to have. One kulfi but you can have it in 5 ways. Tasted awesome.
Been there twice, looking forward to more. 
PS-do not forget to try the varieties of chutneys they serve you with in the beginning. 
This place is a must visit. And the foods a must try. 
The staff is also courteous and explain you how you are supposed to be eating the food. :)

The service was fantastic, they will guide you how to eat your food. I was mainly impressed by their service. The food was amazing. One must definitely visit this restaurant. They serve street foods in their unique way.

Probably the first place that serves molecular gastronomy food. Great ambience coupled with amazing food, spice Klub is the perfect place for a family lunch or dinner. One must try their mango on the rocks, nanzza and bubbling kulfi. Their food and service is highly impressive. I just live this place !

‚ÄúThere is no sincere love, than the love for food‚Äù and so we start the page with a take on food. Actually this is the kind of food that forced me to get out of bed leave my laziness aside and write. This is where science meets food and creates a modern era food- Molecular Gastronomy. 

Have been to a couple of restaurants recently, but I woukd take on a specific restaurat today. SpiceKlub  is a small dimly lit Indian Vegetarian restaurant which has started its journey in Park Street, Kolkata. Making the most of Molecular Gastronmy with Illusion creates fusion food. This is a recently opened outlet  after Dubai , Mumbai , Hyderabad.    

Restaurant Detail 
Restaurant Name ‚Äì SpiceKlub 
Address- Part Steet , Kolkata 
Type of Food ‚Äì Indian Vegetarian Fusion Food 
Cost ‚Äì Approx Rs1800-2000/- for a couple

Restaurant Ratings 
Enterance and Booking ‚Äì 2.5/5 
Restaurant Ambience ‚Äì 3/5 
Service ‚Äì 3.5/5  
Food ‚Äì 4/5
First Time Visit ‚Äì Absolutely Must 
Second Time Visit ‚Äì For a change from other menus, in a while.  

We had a number of dishes but would specifically mention two dishes which stood out for us. 

Fusion Vada Pav 
Pav Served with Potato Mousse, Green and red Chutney, Masala packed in edible Plastic. Assemble and first bite takes you surprisingly to the same authentic Mumbai Vada Pav taste. The ideation is about the Potato Mousse and the use of edible plastic.  

Coconut Water with Assorted Caviar 
Creating a coconut water sorbet and topping it with all vegetarian caviar made from fruit and vegetable extracts make this a must have drink.

Ambience was quite soothing with soft lights and decor.
Food was something that took my heart away.It was at it's best.New concept of presentation...and yet apt for my taste buds.
One can satisfy his or her craving for delicious food over here.
Service was so prompt...staffs were all well mannered and trained.Not only this...they were even explaining the details of their items and their speciality.
Last but not the least..a must go restaurant in the town.Advantage for the pure vegetarian lovers.

They don't serve food. They serve experience and delight. All I want to say is if you don't visit Spice Klub when you're in Kolkata, you've left it unfinished. I took three of my hard core non vegetarian friends to this place and they found even penny worth it. I can vouch for each and every dish written on their menu. Amazing display and even more amazing food.

First glance of hotel was v.good ambience was also quiet not v.noisy friendly staff and captain was v.helpful he suggested to try appetizers 
First we ordered tomota soup which was smoked it was good
Then we ordered papad it was ok ok. 
Then panner lapeta, vadapaw, Aloo Bharwan, papdi chat, panipuri and it was not stopping than we ordered Kulcha chole it was like Burger looking stuffed with chole
For beverages we ordered Ice Sphere which was superbly delicious and dramatic and Alphanso
For desert we were sure that it has to be bubbling kulfi and it was not enough so we ordered Rosoogulla Cheese cake
I was the best experience we had and finally when we call for check they served chocolate filled with pan flavour as mouth freshener.. We all njoyd alot... :)

Gastronomical heaven, that's the only word I would use to describe this place. Being away from the city, checking out new places has been a bit late but this place was worth the wait. We just had the appetisers and I was in food coma. So let me begin with the deconstructed vada pav- loved the fact that I could the packet in which the red chutney was served. Genius idea really and totally unique.the cheese papad was delish and quite a healthy portion too. The nannza is a unique Indian take on the pizza and I loved the flavour of the cottage cheese filling. The papdi chaat served with the green chutney foam was superb and the burst of flavours from the yoghurt bubble was balanced. The paneer tikka was quite decent, I've had better but then I can't complain because the balance of flavours was there. The most buttery galouti kebabs ever. My god they were so smooth and delish. The butter naan was extremely soft and the motion paneer was great. Loved the creamy tomato gravy. Coming to the drinks, the coconut water sorbet was out of this world. A completely unique concept and the taste with the rose water caviar was frankly orgasmic. The ice sphere was another hit@ and the loved how they had to use a hammer to break the ice and then the goodness of fresh fruit came to the forefront. The Jakub punch although highly recommended wasn't really to my taste probably because the Pina colada was on the sweeter side and did not let the Jakub flavour to really come out. The soap cake was presented so uniquely that I did not have the heart to really cut it but the Belgian chocolate mousse cake was great and a must have for chocolate lovers. The bubbling kulfi using the concept of liquid nitrogen was amazing. Came with unique accompaniments like salted caramel, blueberry compote, chocolate, Malawi kulfi and rose water caviar was a great side to this amazing dessert. Like I said at the beginning, gastronomical heaven. 

I frankly did not pay any attention at all to the ambience because I was with my family and when that's the case, everything else ceases to exist. The place is slightly on the pricier side but then I guess good things aren't cheap so yes you can shell out the cash once in a while.

All in all a great experience and I might go and visit the place again when I'm in town next.

We went there on recommendation from friends and was upto the mark. The food is out of the world. Ambience is also very good. The presentation of the dishes is really worth mentioning. 
We ordered Paneer Tikka, which was so soft that it melted in our mouth. The Dahi ke kabab was perfectly prepared. The best starter was Bharwaan Aloo and is a must haves. Kashmiri Alu , in the main course will set your taste buds tingling. 
Overall worth going to the place !!!!!! Will come again for sure.

Located near Mamagoto in Park Street.
I felt it was a little over rated since had heard a lot from people.
The ambience was good. Calm and soft music with sober lighting.
Had ordered a number of dishes,
In starters- 
Vada paw- the signature dish- a must try. Very different and good to taste. The presentation was excellent.
Roomali roti cheese papad- an average dish but again something different. Chillies and cheese on top of roasted roomali roti.
Naanza- A combination of naan and pizza. 
Paw bhaji fondue was bad. Some things taste best when authentic, and variations are good only till the taste is better. Cheese is overloaded on the fondue turned bhaji, which I did not much like.
Galauti kebab- a fresh taste, refreshing and flavourful. With a little bread beneath every kebab, it tasted good.
Hariyali paneer tikka- again a very average dish, the staff thought it was a must try, however I don't much agree.
In main course, the regular daal makhani, paneer butter masala and veg mix was ordered. Everything was simple but good.
Paneer could have been better.
In soups, I had ordered chilli spinach soup which was good and creamy.
In desserts, I had ordered flower pot, it was bad. I recommend to remove it from the menu itself.
Paan shots, they were okay. With the use of liquid nitrogen, ice cream paan was served. 
Volcano however was delicious. A must try. With several elements, it was good.
Overall a mix of good and average but very over priced.

Its a decent restaurant situated in Park Street. Too many tables are cramped in a small space to accommodate more guests at a given time. The tables are so close to each other that you can comfortably hear what's happening on the neighbouring table and sometimes even their neighbour.

Food:
Suddenly there has been a flood of places serving molecular food or fusion food and spice klub is an addition to the list. I'll review the stuff that we ordered.

Nanza - A fusion pizza which was very saucy and I personally didn't liked it much.

Roomali Roti Papad - It was very good, a semi circular crisp rumali roti with melted cheese and herbs on it.

Dahi ke Kebab - OK, was very tangy and not what I was expecting.

Aloo Bharwan - Nicely baked potato jackets with cheese and veggies in white sauce filled inside. Tasted quite good.

Bubbling Kulfi - This I would say is a must try and best of the lot we ordered, crumbled kulfi served with 5 unique sauces, amazing desert. 

Service:
It was really disappointing, very slow and unprofessional staff. Staff was not ready to listen to what we were trying to tell them, instead they were going on with what they were feeded by the management.

Ambience:
Strictly OK, no background music made it a chatter box and filled the environment with sounds of cutlery.

Overall if you are going for decent molecular food, you might visit this place but overall experience will not be very satisfying.

Every thing served with a twist but I believe molecular gastronomy here is limited to NO2, foam & gel. There is way much more that can be achieved with this food science. Having said that, with limited use of molecular gastronomy they were able to deliver in terms of taste. Just order starters cause that is where the science. Mains are served just like in any other place but it too does taste great. Must have Papri Chaat, Pav Bhaji fondue & Vada Pav.

Park Street restaurants can do no wrong, unless of course it's Spice Klub. I'm not saying the food was not edible, but then again we don't go to a restaurant to fill our selves. We go there to enjoy a new flavour , to add to our palate and no matter how much molecular gastronomy you use to pull in the crowd, it's the taste that is the king. I feel Spice Klub got it right in terms of location, cuzine and catering only to the vegetarian fanfare , but they also failed to impress in terms of difference in flavour and good taste.

SpiceKlub is the much talked about food joint in Park street. I had visited there quite some time back when it had newly opened.
Location: Very easy. It is located just behind Marco Polo and Mamagoto on the first floor.
Food: The roomali cheese papad is a must have. It was crunchy on the sides and soft and cheesy at the centre. A perfect start to your meal. The size is huge. For drinks we had taken the Punch on the Pier which is basically a mixed fruit mocktail. There lies fruit chunks at the base. The malai lassi was just amazing. It was creamy thick and superbly delicious. You must try this. 
The aloo bharwan looked tempting but I didn't find the taste too good.
Also the naans and rotis are very soft and tasty. The dal masala tadka was fine.
For desserts the rabri cheesecake was fine but nothing too extraordinary. 
Pocket pinch is on the higher side. A full course meal for two will cost around 2500-2800 bucks.
But nonetheless this place is worth visiting.

One of the most prolific and remarkable restaurant of Kolkata.

Right from the word go, this restaurant won my heart. The host is great. The staff is absolutely on their toes to serve you and make you understand the dishes. The restaurant is a veg one with all the food here being molecular. The concept food is just bliss full to watch, I took a great bit of look before munching on them. Since we were short of space in our tummies, we still went for roomali cheese papad, bharwan aloo and chole kulche. The roomali cheese papad was exotic and full of cheese, coriander and green chillies. Bharwan aloo was topped with green chilly and garlic paste caviars which I saw for the first time. Chole kulche was topped with a green foam of coriander , again prepared molecularly. The presentation is what took me asking for more. Each time a dish came, the waiter prolifically made us understood what we were having. 
For the mocktails, we went for the ice sphere and mango on the rocks. Again presentation was over the top. 
Psst: chole kulche were not good. Rest everything was lip smacking and wow!!

I think people who have crazy notions and embrace new possibilities in kitchen are called chefs. They invented ideas which nobody would imagine. One such invention is molecular gastronomy and the word is that it's running smooth coz the preparations are Smoking(read nitrogen) hot!
SpiceKlub tells the tale of cooking methods with help of technological innovation and equipments. And how the taste & texture of simple food enhances!
Leme start the Gupshup:

Roomali Cheese Papad: crisp Roomali baked with cheese and 6 dips as condiments was served. Twas ok! If savoured hot it would be crisp and if not then it will be stiff.

Bharwa Aloo: This was served on the tandoor hot platter and the potatoes were stuffed with veggies and oozing out cheese.! This dish was yum.

Palak Soup: This looks like garden fresh spinach soup. Tempting colour! Soup was high on spices but it was good!

Ice Sphere : This mocktail is worth watching the preparations. There's the ice sphere which is full of orange syrup and the fruits. The staff hammers this sphere and pour the fizz and that's how this drink is made. Must try!

Sweet Lassi: Dollops of curd served in varieties like pineapple, mangoes, strawberry and lime. Have it and this will burst in the mouth! Twas nice.

Vada Pao: this dish is a stunner. I'll tell you how. They dont serve basic aloo fried. But has a concoction of cheese and potatoes in a dip form. And they had slider Pao. The vada pao masala was packed in the edible starch. So while placing the masala you can actually have it packed. Loved it to the core.

Pao Bhaji Fondue: very basic Pao Bhaji served in an amazing hot pot. It failed to entice me flavour wise.

Soap Cake : the chocolate cake with some edible foam making it look like the soap. It was ok.

Bubbling Kulfi: So this is kulfi dipped in dry ice. Loved the caramel and malai dip out of other 5 dips.

Paan mousse : The paan is sprinkled with loads of nitrogen gas untill it froze. And after its frozen one actually has to wait to devour the paan. It is not worth the wait.

Paan jelly Chocolate : this is served as a mouth freshner and it tastes super yum. The paan flavours are the filling for this chocolate.

The service is good and the staff are really helpful. However this place is exorbitantly priced.

Kulfi solidified in the form of popcorn using liquid nitrogen, under -196¬∞F, served with five different toppings- (from your left) rose caviar, rabri, blueberry caviar, molten chocolate and a thick caramel sauce.
Do not miss this!

The place is a must try, though in a group of about six to eight people. This is in order to get a taste of almost all the major specialities of the restaurant.

Mr. Shankar, our server, was the show stopper and made our dinner exciting as well as memorable. His presence made it unnecessary for us to even look at the menu card. Brilliant service by the gentleman.
Kudos!

Its been a privilege having lunch here this saturday afternoon... I.e. 15/07/17 ... that too on the occasion of my birthday treat..

When the lady at the door welcomed us with pl√©asant warmth... We still dint have a clue that we are at a pure veg restaurant... 
Then we were handed over with the menu.... & BooM !
What! A all veggie restaurant !
& Its quite late to leave the restaurant at that point...
So we chose some dishes in main course - steam rice - paneer etc..

N then the attendant came up with his helping ..... Saying the speciality of this restaurant is hidden in the processing n preparation of food scientifically.... N that speciality can b availed through appetisers n dessert !

Then with his suggestion....
We ate (dint drink) coconut water with assorted cavier - the coconut water frozen to crystalize & we ate the water with spoooon.....
They server a tray of 8 pickles... Wonderful taste !
Then appeared : Pav Bhaji - where the bhsji is scientifically converted into a mousse... & The spice is served in edible plastics... Which u eat all.. coz they are made of starch !

Lastly... We had Paan Mousse..,.. beetle leafs with mousse within it... Then frisen in front of us with liquid nitrogen being poured onto those !

This was indeed an unique eating experience !

Not to mention: the restaurant staffs were very hospitable....

Spiceklub excels in each department!
If in park Street area, then you must visit this place.
Roomali cheese papad must be in your order.
Surely you will never forget the taste of it.
Service is welcoming.
Don't have to wait for the food for a long time.

Went to this place with my husband. It's one of the finest all vegetarian family restaurant. Everything about this place is worth the wait which is certain if you go there without a reservation. The staff is so courteous and the food so innovatively presented . My personal recommendation is coconut water with rose caviarry. Even though it's a drink , It's no less than a yummy desert . I would like to go here again and again until I cover each and every item from their menu .

A pure Veg. restaurant with a wide collection of food items to choose from. Molecular gastronomy in Kolkata has struck the right chords with SpiceKlub in the frame. Each and every offering is distinct with one another. FYI, I love the #PavBhajiFondue. Appetizers/ Beverages/ Desserts are the top 3 categories to indulge into. A very courteous support staff adds to the charm. Highly recommended.

Wow is what comes out if you are dinning with them. There presentation, taste, quantity and quality is just what a lay man searches for, and being me the one it ends here today.
1. Vada paw - one of the best to have with great taste and one of the best presentation I have seen in the resent time. üëë
2. Fruit lassi- I totally see can't find a better than this. Lassi into sphere and rabadi into foam. 
3. Paw bhaji is a fondue - a complete liquid way bhaji with crispy breads on the side. Gives you a complete taste of a Mumbai bhaji,which difficult to get in Kolkata. And the quantity and cheese is amazingly given inside. Thumbs up for this too. 
4. Bubbling kulfi - I really won't say anything here. Just a request do give it a shot ND this will change the idea of a kulfi. The BEST
5. soap cake - begiam dark chocolate. If u want to eat something in begiam dark chocolate and just get lost for few seconds. I guess this is what u go for. I was quite for 10 sec and ordered a second one after a bite.
P. S - a great service with explanation makes a great experience for me and my friends.

Spiceklub - A remarkable experience.
=====
Location & Intro:

Spiceklub is already there in Mumbai. However, it was not late when it started its operations in Magma House, 1st Floor, Park Street. It is not at all difficult to locate. Head from Au Bon Pain towards Barbq Nation and you will see it on the same foot.

I had gone here with my family when my brother had arrived from abroad. We were quite late in the night and wanted to have a different experience of food. Those of you who does not know about Spiceklub, it is a molecular gastronomy restaurant whereby everything except the main course is having a touch of molecular gastronomy. On asking their steward, i was informed that even their soda is made inhouse (they don't purchase soda from vendors) which is quite impressive.¬†

The ambiance of the place is little dimly lit when you go there at the night time. It does not look shady though.
=====
What i ordered: 

Beverages
‚Ä¢ Mango on the Rocks - I personally felt that it should have been into the dessert section rather than beverage. It tasted more like ice cream.

‚Ä¢ My brother ordered another fruit juice drink. I don't remember the name but it tasted better here. ¬†

Starters
‚Ä¢ Roomali Cheese Papad - On asking the steward, i was informed that the roomali roti had been made into these cheese papad by using techniques of molecular gastronomy. It was interesting to hear all the technicalities but more interesting to dip into it. Loved this one too.¬†

‚Ä¢ Aloo Bharwan - Cylindrical pieces of aloo stuffed with cheese, green and orange caviars and bellpepers and presented over a burning charcoal stand. It was lipsmacking and tasty. Totally relished it. ¬†

Main Course
Dal Makhani ¬†- It was way too creamy. It did not have any molecular gastronomy style.¬†

Mix veg - It was fine too.¬†

Tandoori Roti - The usual tandoori roti you get. Nothing fancy about it.¬†

Dessert
Bubbling Kulfi - A kulfi served in molecular gastronomy style with a lot of toppings on the side. The presentation as well as the taste was excellent. Liked it. :)¬†
======
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Unique food experience due to touch of molecular gastronomy.

‚Ä¢ Decent service.

‚Ä¢ Hygiene is maintained. 

‚Ä¢ Serve vegetarian and jain food only.¬†

‚Ä¢ Large seating capacity.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Expensive affair.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 1000-1500 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4.1/5

Food Quantity 4/5

Taste 4/5

Presentation 4.2/5

Hospitality 4.1/5

Ambiance 4/5

VFM 4.2/5
=====
Conclusion: 

I had a good experience here. Though, the amount paid was hefty but the molecular gastronomy and the unique experience makes up for it. Complimentary chocolates were served at the end. Bon Appetit!!

One of the most craziest restaurants i have ever been to.
Their presentation, the food quality is like ultimate !
I would recommend to all to have only starters as their starters are their catch.
Main course is mainly the same probably everywhere but the starters which you will get here will be very new & fascinating.

Must try - vada pao, aloo bharwan, paw bhaji fondue, fruit lassi

My favourite - bubbling kulfi

Perfect man there - shankar da

I visited this place JUST for desserts after a sumptuous lunch on Nobo Borsho.
Being mostly full, we decided to order a few desserts. The two which stood out are:

Soap Cake- It was SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!! The chocolate melting on your taste buds leaves you in a trance. The amazing presentation adds to the delight. Honestly, they charge a tad too much for the quantity.

Rabdi Panacotta- This was another mesmerizing dessert. The flavours blend right in and the milk cake makes it even better. Again, it is a bit pricey.

I strongly plan to visit this place again and try their main courses. I'll update my review based on my future experience as I believe that would only be fair and complete

Visited yesterday with a reservation. And I must admit, it was a delightful experience. The dishes looked so different and interesting, the presentation was undoubtedly very well done. 
And obviously thing that matters the most, the taste was amazing‚Äã. As different as they looked, theu tasted super yum. Not a single dish can be pointed out to be better than the other one. The ambience was simple and great. The waiters were really nice and well behaved. They knew their job perfectly.
The desserts were also amazing. Specially the Bubbling kulfi with six flavours. It was unique and tasted really good. 
Completely recommended. Well done. Keep it Up! üëå

We went to SpiceKlub for a family dinner. The ambience was calm & comfortable, the seating also spacious. Upon entering it seemed like any other restaurant sans the machhua bazar noise. We were attended to by steward Mr Shankar, who suggested the best hors d'veurs and mocktails. 

We did not expect the attack on our palate and senses....!! Right from the presentation to the taste, everything was just fantastic. The food I had here was the best I've had in a very long time. I kept wanting more..... The kids went nuts and wanted their next bday treat here. Perfect place for family & friends...... Everyone.... go try the place.....

Spice Klub was much awaited on my list and it fulfilled my expectations! Food was great! What I loved was how they have innovated all the dishes!! We ordered Vada Pav(better any Vada Pav you've ever had!), Nannza(amaaaazing), aloo bharwan(well presented and delicious) and Pav bhaji fondue(very innovative and yummy). For beverages we ordered Coconut water with assorted caviar and ice sphere! Both the drinks were well presented and mind blowing!! 
And finally, we ordered Cheese Cherry Pineapple Delight which was good too(could've been better though)
They also served a complimentary set of 6 chutneys. Each of it was finger licking good!! 
Apart from the food,
The ambience was quite serene with soft background music. 
The quantity was good enough for 2-3 people. 
The pocket pinch is a bit high but it's worth it. 
The staff was well mannered and guided us for each dish. 
The service was prompt. 

My overall experience was great. Though, - 0.5 for the excessive cheese in each dish. It's a little too much unless you're a die hard cheese fan!

The concept of molecular gastronomy is unique and nice.
The starters and main course were pretty decent and tasty.
We order vada pav for starters which was deconstructed (we had to compile all the elements by ourselves) and roomali papad( a huge crispy roti with cheese on top).
Main course was the usual dal makhani, veg makhanwala and variety of rotis.
For the dessert we opted for Bubbling Kulfi and it was amazing (Recommend by the server).
Service is pretty decent but the kitchen is slow.

A spacious place with sumptuous food for someone with a big appetite, spiceklub was a pleasant experience. You quite a bit feel like an inquisitive visitor to a food museum. Watching them prepare dishes right at your table is interesting and appetising. I loved the fact that they have varieties of options for Jains to choose from. All the dishes that we ordered were delicious and filling. The starters here rank higher than the main course. If you're planning a visit, my advise would be to focus more on the starters. 350/- for puchkas or 400+ for papri chaat may seem way too much but the method of preparation and the final dish that they serve does justice to the price. It is not the usual puchka or papri chaat that they serve. The prices overall are a little on the higher side. If you're looking for a different kind of an experience without wanting to compromise on the quality of food, this place can be your best bet. üòä

We ordered for the following :
1. Roomali cheese papad - 3.5/5
2. Paneer lapeta - 5/5
3. Mango on the rocks - 3.5/5
4. Hara bhara kabab - 3/5
5. Olive naan - 4/5 (this is very heavy)
6. Masala kulcha.
7. Paneer butter masala - 4.5/5

I had gone to SpiceKlub for dinner. The ambience is good and the serving portion is also enough for 3-4 people. We ordered their dahi kebab which was explained to us by their manager and it was too soft and salty. We didn't like it at all. The dips on the table were also not good. 

For main course we had their paneer tikka masala and dal makhani. The dal was good but not the subzi. We ordered churmur naan which was recommended by the manager and garlic naan. We had to get our order replaced as it was highly salty and inedible. The replaced order was also not upto the mark.

SpiceKlub is a Theme based restaurant in Park street, the theme being Molecular Gastronomy. It's a place with a good ambience and the Magic lies in the way they recreate and present the simplest of street food in a completely innovative way which might awestruck you for the first time. The staff is pretty helpful and you can simply ask them for suggestions under appetisers,beverages,main course and dessert. Definitely do give it a visit if you're in Kolkata and want to try a new place! It is on the expensive side but worth it for a try!

Good food with different music and more over a very different presentation of food. They explain the tits and bits and I guess that's really hard to find in places. Being a Saturday, they were not in that hurry as you feel most of the time, that was a bit surprising. Worth of wait, because I got the table here after several trys. So we visited this place sharp at 6.30 the time they open,üòÅ and I was lucky because at 7 they were almost full.. 
Food you should give a shot are - 
Hazzari panner - green chutney with onions and garlic, and cooked in tandoor. Way they present is in a bar b q style. Appealing to eyes and good to taste. 

Cheese papad- must try. Crispy papad with different cheese, and chutneys (on the house) goes really good with it. 

Vada paw- deconstructed Vada with sweet little paws was great in taste, but the presentation stole my heart away. These plastic they give which is edibeüòØ
"Please try"

Beetroot spheres - I literally never thought something like beetroot will be so so tasty to eat. Again it goes really good with there chutney s. 

Icesphere - refreshing drink with chilled soda on the top. 

Soap cake - desert to die for. Belgium chocolate with true taste of it. 

Bubbling kulfi- I have never seen a better unique master piece than this till now. If u ask me for it's taste it was the most awesome thing I ever had. 

Special thanks to a person who helped us suggesting this great food.
Cheers to the team and i am not that a reviewer person, but u made me write such a long one, because you totally deserve it. Thank u :)

Do you find yourself having the same boring looking food over and over again? Do you need some entertainment? - look no further! SpiceKlub are the kings of presentation. With liquid nitrogen‚Äã smoking food, you will find molecular gastronomy in almost every dish. I absolutely loved the presentation. I loved how innovative each dish was.
The lassi shots are amazing! So is the deconstructed vada pav! These two are truely amazing. It was really a unique experience to be eating our beverages, that included the mango on the rocks and the coconut bombshell! It was a treat to the eyes. The kulfi in the end was out of the world!
That being said, I feel they get 5 stars for presentation but only 3 stars for taste. The dishes tasted just about right. Taste wise, none blew my mind. The ambience makes up for it.

A lot of flaff and nothing else. Not an impressive ambience - read: music, and interiors. The north indian food is very average. I would definitely prefer one of the classic restaurants serving Indian food over this one. Not happy with the overall service and the unnecessary yapping of one of the main stewards impressing on the extraordinary food experience they provide, while their plate really doesnt offer much.

Went to this place on a Monday but still had to wait for approximately 40 minutes. So one can imagine the rush. Coming to the food, for starters we ordered naanza, roomali papad and kebabs. All were really delicious! Main course was good as well. We ended our meal with the bubbling kulfi which was outstanding and a must try. Didn't really like the drinks. Things like serving eight chutneys, serving flavoured water, describing each dish and giving paan flavoured chocolates deserves a special mention. With only one visit, this place has already become one of my favorites.

Its take an hour to get repeat orders
Breads served were not warm
No decency on the part of the manager
He was so rude that he didn't even apologize
When asked the no of the owner, he does not know the owner
When asked his name- " They are not allowed to name them" Superb privacy
When i was taking photo of the manager(man) , he ran away.
I don't know who is accountable here
God save the owner

Gastronomy is a concept in food which gives very tempting presentation.. So this place has taken it very seriously and has introduced hell lot of items under this roof.. Starters till desserts nothing can be wrong over here.. Try vada pav,nanza,cheese rumali papad,mango  on the rocks,dum biryani,rabri etc..I have only mentioned some of the names as I forgot many of them.. No issues and I would say a fantastic place for a meal

Ambience is great. When the food is served the waiters make it a point to let you know about it's components. The presentation and style of serving is unique and fun.

One may fall short of words to describe the awesomeness that Spice Klub is. Without indulging in the condescending 'but for a vegetarian restaurant this is extraordinary', let me say that the place offers some of the best dining experiences you will encounter in the city, irrespective of cuisine.

Located in the heart of Park Street, twinning with Mamagoto, Spice Klub has slowly established itself as the go to fine dining place for people looking for vegetarian food. My mom was in town and it was the Tuesday of the bengali joistho month (I'll not pretend I understand much of this religious mumbo jumbo but I respect everyone's choices all the same) and she wanted to eat out but have vegetarian food. So off we went to SpiceKlub. The place was already bustling with life on 7 pm of a sordid summer evening in Kolkata, a testament to the diner's popularity. ¬†We were escorted to a table for two by the really courteous and ever helpful staff.

Before our ordered food arrived, a set of 8 chutneys/dips were placed on our table ; each of them unique, each of them really tasty. From the savory tamarind dip to the quirky purple cabbage paste, this was a wild assortment of flavors right from the go.¬†
First up was the deconstructed Vada Pav. Let's just say it was one of the best dishes, ever! A set of 8 pavs, served with tamarind and mint chutney, boondi, a fondue to die for and packets of pav bhaji masala (the packets which resembled plastic were apparently made up of potato starch and hence edible) were served. When everything comes together in your mouth, it is almost certainly going to unleash a fervent foodgasm that will be etched in your memory.

The papdi chaat with fancy molecular gastronomy techniques like mint chutney foam, rose petals and spherified curd was a tad disappointing if only because it was the follow up act to the pav.¬†

Another rather interesting dish was the frozen coconut water served with rose caviar. This, while placed in the list of beverages, is to be eaten with a spoon, is refreshing with zero added sugar and looks very, very pretty. I do not know what they used to make those rose colored beads of caviar but they looked like the real deal.

¬†Finally for dessert (their dessert menu btw is going to make you feel cornered as there are so many amazing choices and if you are not with a group there's only so many you can choose) we had the bubbling koolfi. The milk based koolfi base is served in a glass kettle like utensil cooled by liquid nitrogen and there are 5 dips with which you can mix and match and make the koolfis of your choice. One of their dips were not available so were given 2 dips of the same flavor : one blueberry, one salted caramel, one chocolate and two rabri. Again full marks for the innovation as well as the taste.¬†

As a sweet ending, two pieces of complimentary dark chocolate with 'pan' flavored filling were given to us. The price is steep, but the food, ambiance, staff and everything else is so good that it feels like money well spent.

Modern Indian food with too much drama and even more Amul cheese.Great to come for the first time but don't know whether the same drama will excite me the second time
Pricing and portion size are decent and it is interesting that inspire of being pure vegetarian it could place itself in the fine dining league.

The way they present and serve the food is wonderful. Don't go there for a main course, but for appetisers, mocktails and desserts. There was this guy "Vicky" who explained to us almost each and every dish in detail from the ingredients to the way they were going to present it by putting in so much effort that we thought "This is what deserves a good service charge." Try the dishes suggested by them (for us, it was Vicky), you will love it.

Been here today itself. We had ordered the starters as soon we sat.
Starters arrived after half an hour! We had to sip on the mocktails till the starters arrived!
To top it all we had ordered bharwan aloo. After half an hour they informed us that it is out of stock and had to cancel it!
After having our starters, had to wait for another 45 minutes for the main course!
Ridiculous service . Not expected from such a renowned brand!
I had very high expectations but was extremely disappointed!
Food was good but overall experience was very bad due the poor service

I have fallen in love with the place...it is simply awesome. Well Kolkata needed such breadth of fresh air!! This place is a perfect example of gastro molecular concept. We were sufficed with starters ..n there was no room for main course. Bubbling koolfie was a cherry on the cake..the staff is really interactive and explained us the concept of each dish with zeal and enthusiasm!! A must go and I would love to visit again...although price is on a higher side but it's worth it.!!!

Went this place for lunch. Can talk about its ambience and interiors, but it's all insignificant when the food is so good and grand. So we just had whatever the server recommend us. Actually most of the tables were having the same things that we were having. I recommend that they should try and sell other dishes too to the customers. And just one more thing, all are dishes were brought to the table at the same time, so it became clumsy and we couldn't savour each dish. Now finally coming to the dishes, they tasted good, but the concept and presentation was fabulous. We had two mocktails, coconut water with assorted caviars and mango on the rocks. It was like eating actual coconut and mango respectively. Then we had the rumali cheese papad and bharwaan potato and vada pav- all are must haves. The naanza was different and delicious. The pav bhaaji fondue was okayish, nothing great. For the dessert we had the bubbling kulfi. I don't like kulfi but even I would recommend it.
Overall, definately worth a visit.

So you have to book a place before you go. The dishes here keep you awestruck throughout. We ordered a roomali cheese papad which is a must try. We ordered a nannza which is a naan recreated like a pizza. We‚Äã ordered a mango on the rocks which is a mocktail. It is super icy and you can't miss the creation of this mocktail. We ordered coconut water with assorted caviar which is extremely refreshing. Pav bhaji fondue is also good. The bhaji could be better. Bharwa aloo is a must try. It had cheese and assorted veggies in it. Vada pav is superb. Its a hit. Bubbling kulfi is a must must must try. It had salted caramel, blueberry, Belgian chocolate, rose, rabri dips. What disappointed me was the service. The service was so fast that they literally bombarded us with all the dishes at a time so we couldn't enjoy the food initially. 
I look forward for another visit. üíñ

SpiceKlub is one of a growing number of Indian restaurants spreading the gospel of molecular gastronomy in Kolkata. Itself a branch of SpiceKlub Mumbai, the franchise today boasts outlets as far away as Dubai (which I have also visited). Located next door to powerhouse Barbeque Nation, on the 1st floor of the Magma House Complex on Park Street, the interior is far simpler than the hocus pocus cuisine it represents. Speaking of which, the food is superb, and far better than many of the dinosaurs of Park Street.  So is the service. Worth a visit.

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

Another molecular gastronomy restaurant, this one is my current favourite for 2 reasons: 
1.pure vegetarian
2. Foooooood‚ù§ 

Decor- Very simple and elegant decor, overlooking towards the main parkstreet road and just about right. 

Starters- even if u dnt try the main course it isn't a big deal but you should try the starters and the desserts!! 
We first ordered for 
1. Roomali Cheese Papad which was great and so delicious. It was a Roomali roti made into Papad style with cheese and chillies and herbs on it. It's one of thermic signature dishes. You gotta have the Papad with the dips specifically the garlic, green chutney and red cabbage dip!! So many dips they have but these 3 are my favourite.  5/5 
2. Deconstructed Vada pav- Buns served with green and imli chutney along with a Vada which comes in the consistency of a mousse, with garlic potato starch paper (edible) and so many yummy points!!! 
It's a different avatar to the normal Vada pav, the mousse is so delicious, I dint even the Buns to relish it! 5/5 
3. Dahi Kebab- soft kebabs with Dahi in sphere shaped on top of them alongside salad. The traditional kebabs, super in taste but different in presentation. 4.5/5 
4. Main course- Their Dal makhani is to die for! The man serving us told us that it wasn't made on open fire instead it was made in tandoori and just by eating the dal u could tell how different it tasted.  The creamy, buttery flavour was hitting the correct taste buds and it was amazing! 5/5
5. The other vegetable that we tried was veg tawa khada masala- and it want like a regular mix veg. Nope. It was different- made in onion sauce with a smoky flavour and correct balance of sweet, tangy and spicy!! The flavours just exploded in my mouth! 5/5
6.Roti- We ordered for masala kulcha and wholewheat roti (tandoori roti) - served hot and fresh I specially loved the tandoori roti Cz it was only thinly made and neither too hard nor too soft. Just correctly made. 
7. Drinks- I ordered for ice sphere and gola!! The ice sphere was basically an orange drink with living and apple and grapes in it. The sphere and soda was brought to my table and then the ice was just hit once to make a hole in the sphere and then poured over with the soda made by the restaurant! Very nice tnlangy and sweet drink.
The other was gola- 4 golas with 4 different flavours- Kala khatta, Rose, orange and green! Old school but great!! 
8. Lastly, my another favourite- the dessert!! Cheese cherry pineapple delight-  it was a very dramatic dessert!! 
Basically, it's a cheese filo pastry with Pineapple mousse and cheese cubes and Cherry cream and served on the side with blueberry cheese icecream!! I loved it!! Just loved it so much!! Full points for that!! 

Lastly I would mention the staff and their courtesy- They ll make sure u choose the right dishes and cater to u so well. They will definitely make u have a good time and enjoy ur meal!! Very very Happy with the service and the food.

A delightful experience. A must try at this place is the kulfi. The concept is of serving it with liquid nitrogen and five different flavours. The flavours are really authentic and natural. No doubt their signature dishes actually stand out. 
Along with great food they welcome you with much humbleness. Shankar is one of the staffs who shall make your visit more worthwhile.

Bringing elements of molecular gastronomy to Indian vegetarian food is Spice Klub Kolkata. An offshoot of the Bombay branch, the food at Spice Klub is more of an experience. 

Take for example their Aaloo Bharwan. A popular starter in the menu, these are potato cylinders marinated in yogurt and spices, stuffed with cheese and peppers and reduced caviar; served sizzling hot in a marble grill.

A delectable celebration in the mouth though highly priced at 325 INR; the quality is top notch and the money that you will be paying is worth it.

Another amazing experience is their molecular gastronomy rendition of the vada pao and the fruit Lassi.

Heads up! Your order will take atleast 20 minutes to come to your table, so it's best you make your choice at the earliest. It's totally worth it.

Went for lunch last Sunday. Had heard about this place so thought of trying it out. For starters we ordered Spiced Tomato soup, Paneer Lapeta and Aloo Bharwan. Paneer was made differently, soup had a rich aroma but aloo bharwan was bit sweet. The mocktail, which they mentioned as their speciality, Punch on the Pier was dissapointing. The main course included Malai Kofta, Veg Tawa and Dal Makhani which were well prepared. In breads we had Tandoori Roti, Cheese Garlic Naan, Black Olive Naan for breads. The Black Olive Naan was bit burnt and tasted bitter. Else rest were fine enough. The Bubbling Kulfi, again their speciality, tasted very good and stood out. Though the restaurant is on the expensive side given some very good restaurants in the vicinity, the unique food presentation coupled with good taste and nice ambiance doesn't dissapoint and makes a perfect outing.

SpiceKlub is a gastronomical Indian cuisine restaurant located in Park Street in Magma House complex. We were 12 went for dinner on a weeknight. We had made prior reservation so didn't have to go thru long waiting times. Decor is quite good and the ambience is soothing. Since this place is popular for its innovative Indian regional cuisines so we decided to order various kinds of appetisers like vada paw, aloo bharwan, roomali cheese papad, paneer lapeta, nannzza etc. Presentation of dishes get 5/5. Out these vada paw and nannza were the best. All others too were worth trying. Since we were already full with appetisers we decided to order only breads, dal Makhani and veg Kolhapuri for main course. Again one of best dal Makhani I have had in town - perfectly spiced and creamed. Service is very quick. Staff is courteous. Recommend visiting this place once in a month atleast. Little overpriced that's why 4.5/5.

OMG!! This restaurant has everything that one looks out, to get a break from the mundane. Great location, valet parking, fantastic ambience, lip smacking food and fabulous service.

I recommend that you visit in large groups to really enjoy the variety that this place has to offer.

We were a group of 8 adults and 4 kids. We ordered almost all the appetisers in the menu. Each dish has something new and unique to offer. Aloo Bharwan, Hazari Paneer Tikka, Roomali Cheese Papad and Dahi Kabab were really delicious. We skipped the main-course and went straight for desserts. Bubbling Kulfi was absolutely phenomenal.

A shout out to Shankar, who helped us throughout and made this experience of ours a truly memorable one.

The food is unique, the service homely and the ambience soothing. I feel it's a perfect combination of what a restaurant must have. 

Ordered Nannza which was delicious. But what really stole my heart was the Nitrogen Kulfi. With 6 different dips which hits every taste bud along with the novel presentation, it's one of the most perfect deserts after a scrumptious meal. 

Special mention for the staff which let us stay beyond the closing time and did not create a fuss about it at all. 

Will definitely visit again!

There are times when you feel adventurous and for those times, this is a place you must visit. Defining molecular gastronomy aptly, these people have well trained staff who will be your food guide. Vicky was my food guide and he made sure I ordered according to my taste! So in case the management is reading this, make sure your man receives his compliment. Mango on the rocks is a must try. You will feel like a child again while your food guide makes this on your table. Overall it was an unique experience.
P.S. So much adulation for a vegetarian restaurant coming from a loyal non vegetarian person must have taken some effort. :P

I have been to SpiceKlub thrice and it has never failed to impress me.  So this time with starters and main course I had 5 different types of desserts. There is just no comparison of the way they do the presentation of the dishes. 
"Soap Cake" is the perfect dessert for chocolate lovers. It's even served exactly in the shape of a soap with a towel just to make it look better. 
The star of all the dessert was "Bubbling Kulfi" where they have used nitrogen to make stones of kulfi ice-cream. It is served with five different flavors of sauce. All the sauces are yum and gives a feeling of 5 different ice cream. 
Then there was Pan Mousse which is solidified using nitrogen but I think the taste of it can be made better since it becomes too hard to eat. 
I loved the Rasgulla cheesecake. It didn't have that fancy presentation but it the most apt dessert for all the rasgulla lovers.  
I also had "Flower Pot" which had Rasmallai as its major ingredient. I loved it's presentation but I think chocolate with rasmallai didn't make that a great combination for me. 
Overall I had an amazing experience with the food and friendly staff.  I will specially like to mention about a staff there: Shankar who was amazing in recommending dishes to my family according to their taste and explaning about each and every dish.

We then order bharma Aloo, nanzza, galauti kabab,chola burger and in desserts we order the cherry pineapple pastry. Let me tell you something that everything was extra ordinarily and out of the box.

Well looks like a plain old restaurant on the outside but the real fun starts once the Menu is handed over to you. Based on the art of Molecular Gastronomy, this restaurant is surely a eye, mouth pleaser.¬†
We were served by Shiv, and he truly is the right man for the Job. Their Service is meant to generate interest in food, with they not just explaining their servings before its arrival but also how to Eat it.¬†
It is surely a good experience at first visit. But as goes with all thriller movies, one finds hard to enjoy the second time ! With their Artistic food- seen and swallowed , there is no charm left the next time you visit. Inside ambience is average, Place is rather small with just a single Washroom, all of which leaves nothing but the Food to look forward to.
Must Visit for the once who haven't and cheers for bringing In something new to the city.

What  I have always seen, is that you go in a fine dine place,eat your food, enjoy with your family members and go back home with Galla time with the people u had your food with.
What in here u get to spend great time with your family but more than that u spend a best time with there food from the time u get explained and eat it. The taste is exactly what there staff explains, my table was served by there operations manager, and he just asked "what is the table is looking for in taste" and bang he gave us what we were exactly looking for. From the beverages to deserts he just got our taste. The food we had were- Nanza, sphere chat, Burman allo, hazari panner, cheese papad, &vada paw. In drinks again we were served just the best ones, mango(a pure bliss) , kokum, jammun punch, ice sphere. He asked us to come for main course again and go for deserts. So we had bubbling kulfi, flower pot. I guess it not only about food, it is how U present it with love, smile, and the way to enjoy it the most. Thank u so much. Loved till the pan chocolate.

Situated in the heart of Park street. Great concept in food. New variety in Veg food.. was much awaited in Kolkata.

Only if the helpings had come one by one, would have savoured the taste better.

Would love to visit again.

SpiceKlub is a restaurant which will not only want to serve you good food but will surely make your hearts filled with warmth and love..
We were here for  birthday lunch on a Sunday afternoon and we loved our visit here..
So, on entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by the staff and then we settled down at our desired table.
The staff will first explain you the whole concept and the history behind SpiceKlub and will also explain you about which dishes to opt for according to the taste!

Now, moving straight to our fooding experience..
We ordered Paneer lapeta kebab and mushroom & spinach shashlik for starters.

Both the dishes were really good and the hint of molecular gastronomy in the Paneer lapeta kebab was fantastic. They serve a small sphere of coriander chutney which will burst in your mouth! That was something mind blowing..

For mocktail we ordered Mango on the Rocks which totally rocked our minds.. This drink was prepared in front us and the presentation is pretty cute. This drink tasted like a semi solid Mango ice cream or cream based slush. Truly exciting flavours..
Still there is a drawback about this drink and that is one has to eat the drink and not drink it ,due to which it gets very messy to drink it with a small spoon(which is what fits in the glass it is served in).

After the starters, we were almost full and did not feel like moving over to main course, as the restaurant is famous for its Appetizers with the gastronomical touch!

We enjoyed eating here and food served is delicious! The chutneys that are served in the starting while one is waiting for their meal to arrive were also yummy! Ambience and services are top notch and overall we had a nice time there!

Would surely visit again to try out more starters, main course and also the most talked about desserts! üòä

Finally I got a chance to visit this so hyped place.
The ambience was average but the show stealer was its food. I have no words to describe the food. It was jist wow. Main course if you want to have then you are surely not in the right place but if you want to enjoy the starters and desserts, then SPICEKLUB is the place to be.
All the starters we ordered was amazingly delicious. As a result of which we finally had a debate among our friends as to which starter was the best with everyone having different items on their name. But then when we started debating about which item was not good, silence was what which prevailed.

Starters that we ordered was Paneer Lapeta, Aloo Bharwan, Nanza, Rumali Cheese Papad, Chole Bhature and few more were there which I dont remember by name but then all were amazing.
There was one coconut drink, it was amazing and yes desserts was like a cherry on the cake. Simply Amazing.

The interiors are well done. The seating arrangement is comfortable.
The USP of this place is the way they serve all of their dishes.üòçüòç
The quality and quantity is good. They serve eight types of chutneys which cater to the myriad tastes of people.
I tried Mango On The Rocks, Pav Bhaji Fondue, Naanza and Bubbling Kulfi.
All the items were very appealing and delectable.üëç
The service was top notch.üëå
At the end they serve you with a pan filled chocolate which is very refreshing.üòäüòä
A little bit on higher side but totally worth it.

Lovely place with experimenting at its best. Simply awesome food and experience. You not only eat here you experience food. You are explained each and everything because everything served is new and fresh. Thanx to Mr. Shankar for managing things well for us and suggesting signature dishes to us and also explaining us as to how to eat and enjoy. Hats off to the whole team. For the first time you know that food is science and needs to be explained to enjoy properly.

Reservation was super easy. We called up and booked a table and instantly got a confirmation sms message. We were the first ones to be at the restaurant and we were there for more than 2 hours.

Simply minimalistic decor and enough light on the tables. Cool service. Vallet parking available. Located in the heart of the city in Magma House, Park Street.

As complimentary around 8 types of chutneys/sauses were served on the table and were refilled time to time whenever required.

We tried Galauti Kabab and Paneer Lapeta as starters. I specially liked the Paneer Lapeta which you had to savour one at a time without breaking it to pieces.

Cheese Papad - Simply awesome. basically roomali roti made crisp with cheese served in shape of a dome. Simply wow taste.

Dal Kabila, Veg Kadhai, Multigrain roti, Tandoori roti - These were not the signature dishes as main course does not have anything signature but were simply wonderful. I was in doubts if they would be able to keep up with the main course meal but they did it tastefully and deliciously. We enjoyed them till the last drop of dal.

Bubbling Kulfi and Rabdi Panacotta for the desserts - No words to explain. These are 2 of the most famous signature desserts here and we ordered both. Bubbling kulfi was brought in very fast and u can very well understand how it was by the pictures. Simply a wow new concept and out of the world experience. The Rabdi Panacotta took 20-25 minutes to come and we were duly informed about this time before hand. We decided to go for it and it was worth the wait. Every millimeter of the dish was superb. Simply new and fresh flavours.

Must try, highly recommended, must visit. I usually do not go to one place twice but i can break my own rule to come here again and again to try the dishes which are left to be tasted. Trust me they are professionals of food and whatever they are serving.

Nice place to visit... Been there for Sunday lunch... Good experience... Innovative presentation.... My suggestion in short n sweet : Go in just for mocktails,  starters n desserts... Avoid main course coz it's nothing unusual from the lot.... Instead try a lot of starters n desserts which are actually different n have been worked upon hard... bit highly priced... the staff is humble n have full knowledge of the food that they are serving... They explain u well about each dish n the best way to relish it's taste... Shankar was the guy who was serving my table... Overall nice experience going there n a must visit for foodies who love to eat different n think out of the trunk...

You cannot judge a place, until or unless you visit it more than 2 times.  
So as with Spice Klub.  This was my 6th visit,  and the quality and quantity is the same as it was the 1st time. 
Good food is what we crave for, and I guess this is the place where  my crave stops.

We visited this restaurant after seeing so many positive reviews, but was very much disappointed, foods were not upto  the mark, the steward was very rude and when we told him that the main course paneer had onion in it he argued that it didn't have and then we asked for the chef to meet us, they said it was not their policy to let chef meet the customers! All in all a very bad experience and definitely no future visit. And also a service charge@8% which you did not mention while making the Reservation.

Of course SpiceKlub is the talk of town at the moment, and for good reason so. Being amongst the pioneers of molecular gastronomy in Kolkata, the Park Street outlet of this chain lives up to its name. 
While the service host  tries his best to explain the dish in a typical SpiceKlub style, he ends up giving a faint imitation of Geoffrey Boycott and after a while it does get annoying. 
The service is fast and fantastic, so one has to be careful to order one dish at a time so as to fully enjoy it without being rushed with another dish at the table. 
The condiments served at the beginning are galore, and are varied to the taste of different palates. 
The Roomali Roti Papad was recommended by the host, and was really tasteful. 
Though not a typical example of molecular gastronomy, the Nanza was also pretty decent too. Though it was a bit bland to our taste, we couldn't do anything about it since the restaurant doesn't keep salt and pepper on the table along with it's appetisers. 
The Mango On The Rocks is definitely a recommendation for all the mango lovers, and is a really fine example of the 'scientific' method of gastronomy. The only caveat being that it is really filling for its description. 
The food is filling and the service is good, as is it's Pav Bhaji Fondue. The Fondue on its on stands out in its taste and quantity. 
The best time to visit the place is when one is in the mood to experiment, and has worked up an appetite. Also, to try the maximum number of appetisers one should visit with as many people in a group as is possible. 
The main course, if one still has the appetite for it, is ordinary and one can't differentiate the taste between the flavours that one gets in the dishes here or any other restaurant.

So.. I walked into a low light peaceful looking cozy restaurant.. and honestly EXPECTING a typical food experience for a vegetarian with the dals and paneers.. but I was pleasantly surprised by the thought process that has gone into the Menu.. it definitely has Variety..
Don't just fall for the names.. definitely try them.. I was BLOWN AWAY by the food quality and preparation style!
The best part about Spice Klub is the continuous stress on the food preparation for every item that they bring in.. and their versatility in food..
Yes.. it is modern Indian cuisine as it incorporates the various forms of preparation that all of you might have seen in Masterchef.. 
I am extremely pleased!

I have come here quite a few times, last night however we had a bad experience. Everyone understands that this is a restaurant which serves unconventional food and a major part of the success of this restaurant is the entire experience it sells which is different from other restaurants. However there is a fine line between being cocky and trying to explain the food. There was one dish which the waiter was trying to explain to us and in the process he was really overdoing it. When we weren't able to perhaps catch-up or understand what he was trying to say, he went like "pcch." and making disappointing expressions to us. This fine line I am sure has been crossed a lot of times at this place but people are sometimes scared or shy about addressing these concerns. What one must realise however is that the hospitality industry is based on interaction between the customer and the one curating the experience. The customer is still the ultimate king and no matter how fancy/uncommon the food is, this doesn't imply that in the process of explaining the food you end up disrespecting and ruining the experience. Have still given a 3 because the food was really good!

The table by the road, enjoying the park street lightings and the cars on the road. The generosity of the waiter 'Sabyasachi', suggesting us the best dishes and explaining its scientific way of preparation was unique of his style.

We ordered -
Dahin Kabab for starters and its small bubbles on top just melted in my mouth within seconds and is very different from any other place.
Followed by that we ordered-
Nan style Pizza with toppings of cheese, sauces and base of Naan and again filling of Pizza. Very different again.
Last was the dessert-
Kulfi with varieties of flavour.

The new concept of Chocolate Pan along with the bill was delicious and different. 
Completely loved the place.
Thank You "Sabyasachi"

The edible plastic that the extremely polite and helpful Sabyasachi served with the vada Pav was indeed the catch. The kulfi from 'the back of the house' was like the ultimate finisher to our extraordinary and extravagant lunch there.

I was just a scrolling through Zomato and found out about spiceklub , which is located at the centre of the city . It is famous was their use of molecular gastronomy to present the dish. I searched and saw the pictures and was highly impressed. 
I went to spice club on a Sunday afternoon . It was a nice place with good ambience and of course amazing staffs. We ordered cheese papad, Kulfi, chole kulche, vadapaw , litchi syrup mocktail and lassi . But to my surprise all of them were not presented in the conventional way it is usually presented. They changed the whole look and idea of the dish . The taste was amazing . While serving the dish , the staffs were also explaining the idea of the dish and demonstrating how to have it. A thumsup to this place . It has definitely come in one of my favourite places in Calcutta. Do visit this place , coz each time you go , each time the thrust to visit this place again will increase.

In the beginning came the containers with different kinds of chutneys..Most of them were wow..
Next the romali roti papad style with cheese..
And then deconstructed dhokla..
And then came mango on the rocks..It really rocked ya..
And the final icing was the kulfi platter..
Guys the food here and the experience was phenomenal..
Though the service part, it's a little annoying coz you guys are really really really slow..
But then the food is much more important here.. :)

Located near Bar-B-Q Nation, Park Street.. Locating this place isnt a big deal

The ambience is good, dim lights with music..

The staff is very interactive and are well trained to market their products

Starters - Roomali Cheese Papad, Palak Cheese Cigar, Hazari Paneer Tikka & Nannza

Beverages - Masala Chhas

Deserts - Old School Lollies & Bubbling Kulfi

Roomali Cheese Papad - A big Bowl shaped Papad with Cheese filling. It would have been perfect had they added onion and other ingredients of a Masala Papad in it. But it was nice and something different.

Palak Cheese Cigar - Cigar shaped rolls, filled with cheese filling. A must try for cheese lovers. Loved it.

Hazari Paneer Tikka - It was normal Paneer Tikka that is served in other restaurants, nothing new. The paneer was soft and taste was good.

Nannza - Its a combination of Naan + Pizza. A new concept. Liked it.

Masala Chaas - Loved it, perfect quantity of ginger, pudina and other ingredients. Was chilled, just loved it.

The starters were so heavy that we decided to skip main course and have deserts directly.

Bubbling Kulfi - An amazing dish, one should definitely try. Ice granules are served with Chocolate sauce, blueberry sauce, Caramel, Rabdi etc. The ice (kulfi) needs to be mixed well with these sauces before having them. Tastes good, recomended to others.

Old School Lollies - Out of the Box concept for me, but the dish is not worthy enough. Chocolate Sauce and 2 other similar liquids are given with Ice Cream Sticks. We need to place the sticks o@n a freezing ice box which they provide and make our own lollies.Liked the concept, not the dish though.

A pocket pinch of 5k for these, the restaurant is very expensive.

Overall a great experience, worth spending here for food.

An absolutely mind blowing experience.  A must visit ! A bit on the expensive side, but worth it. It would be a wiser choice to order starters and desserts and skip the main course. The presentation is beyond imagination. The taste is equally good. Paw bhaji fondue and romali cheese papad are an absolute must. The presentations for pani puri and papdi chaat was amazing but the taste was pretty average. We ordered paan mousse for desserts. The serving was an amazing experience. This particular dish steals all accolades on presentation and preparation, the taste was however just okay. 

Special mention: The waiters are a delight. Extremely polite and offer a lot of help with the menu, and will also guide us how to eat the served dishes in order to enjoy the most.

Great food. Just out of the box concept even the presentation. Loved each and every bit of it.  
The staffs are well know to the Menue and they give you a very correct suggestion regarding the same. I was assisted by Shubhankar and he is a really good with his Menue. 
Coming to the deserts, as we were full with there heavy starters we went for bubbling kulfi as recommended by Shubhankar & I must say i couldn't stopped by self. Amazing

This restaurant is filled with molecular gastronomy. Honestly too much of it. We were served by Sabyasachi and thanks to him for all the suggestions and interactions. We started with Roomali cheese papad which i found on every table, it was indeed the best we had. Than came vada paw and chana kulcha. Vada paw was below average. Nothing good about it neither the Vada made into paste through molecular nor masala in edible packet can add to taste. Further chana kulcha, again the green chutney was turned into foam using molecular but the taste was average. Finally we hopped to paan mousse for desserts. it was a good one with nitrogen infusion, mousse tasted good. we were served with complimentary belgian chocolates with paan again but that was too sweet to be good.

Today had dinner at spiceklub..It was amazing experience.Got chance to taste different type of flavours with different presentation and quite unique preparation. starters are the show stopper of the restaurant. really worth visiting this restaurant and recommend if you are foody and like trying out different food variants in different unique way one must try it out this restaurant. My special thankx to Mr shankar one of the restaurant staff who was suggesting us and we tried quite very good varieties of the restaurant.Hats off to him as he has proper knowledge about the menu items and thr ingredients and preparation. Slight improvement in the ambience recommended. As it look bit dull and casual.But food will get you attracted so much that you will forget ambience.

A new fine dining restaurant ... a mof molecuar food and some innovative dishes ... the molecular mocktails were ok... nothing to write back home .. except the molecular ingenuity can avoid ... to start with a free set of dip and chutneys and achaar were good ... the roomali roti papad is a must have ... a good innovation ... the poochkas were without aaloo ... but overall good ... vada paav was without the vadas but tasty as a dish ... the spinach c8gars were ok ... paneer lapeta was ok can be avoided ... by this time we were too full and we skipped the main course to order their signature dish .. molecular koolfi. Which came with 6 sauces ... was really worth it ... overall good experience will come again to try the main course .

The word to explain it will be "awesome". 
Taking food, service, pan, everything in count. The best thing about this is, they do make Jain food too.
We tried ice sphere, paw bhaji fondue, Papads of India, and there signature bubbling kulfi and soap cake. The portions are quite filling and good. 
Lovely food with good experience.

So there is quite a hype around this restaurant and thats what made my experience average coz I expected some really amazing food . 

We ordered the Paneer lapeta for appetisers which had molecular spheres of green chutney which was tasteless . The portion is too small when you compare  it to the price they charge . 

For the main course we ordered kadai paneer , dal makhani , and an assortment of Indian breads which was very average. 

After not having  a great experience , we decided to skip the dessert . 
The food is very average . The waiters explain you the food with so much appreciation and when you eat it , it just falls flat.

And a amazing time spend here. I am going to start with the deserts, i have not seen such superb names of the deserts anywhere & they taste really awesome. 
Starters are different in presentation and have the true taste as there names.  I guess for vada paw I don't have to go or ask my friends to get it from mumbai! 
I loved the mango on the rocks. Tastes completely like seasonal mango. It is like some one has made mango into small popcorns or rocks. 
I have to visit there place again and again as the menu is quite intense.  Happy fooding! :)

TL:DR (Too Long Didn't Read) Version - GREAT service. Mindblowing food. B-E-A-utiful desserts. Absolute must visit. Do let me know how you liked it if you do decide to visit. :D
Have you ever had that moment in your life, where you took a bite of your food, and you just stopped, just to savour the taste. It had never happened to me until I visited this restaurant. With every dish, I had the same reaction, stopped right in the tracks with every bite. This one is going to be a LONG review, and you must read it through the end cause this restaurant deserves it. I shall start with the food ordered:

Roomali Cheese Papad - An innovative dish, and as everyone in my family enjoys cheese, we straightaway went for it, it was a rumali roti, crispy as crispy can be, with loads of cheese and green chillis (we opted out of the green chillis and the restaurant obliged). It was absolutely amazing!

Aloo Bharwan - This was what the name suggested but served in a different way, the aloo was cylindrical in shape and had cheese and pepper stuffings inside it, it was absolutely amazing and tasted really nice, it was a bit spicy but definitely a must try dish according to me!

Vada Pav - This was a show stealer, Small little buns, green chutney and imli chutney, with a potato mousse and some crispy fried batter pieces, this even had small packets of chilli powder with an edible plastic packet, no idea with what that was made. But this dish was absolutely stunning, PLEASE TRY THIS. The mousse was absolutely amazing and we couldn't stop eating just those.

Naanza - As the name says, a perfect combination of naan and pizza, its the best of both worlds combined together in a match made in heaven. Usually fusion foods is not something I try, but this one went together perfectly well, whoever thought this up, kudos.

Soap Cake - We ordered this after reading the description and being ardent chocolate lovers, the chocolate was mind blowing and had the perfect taste to it (leaned towards darker side a bit). The texture was like a piece of soap and the server advised that we must eat it with our hands, the dairy foam was also pretty great but didn't make too much of a difference to the overall dish.

Bubbling Kulfi - THIS. IS. ULTIMATE. Nitrogen frozen kulfi with Rose, Chocolate, Salted Caramel, Rabri and blueberry toppings. I won't talk more about this dish, cause I can't. I was left absolutely phenomenal and I was left speechless. Please try this.

The service was absolutely fantastic and the servers even helped us with the correct way to eat all the dishes, were always smiling and were more than happy to clarify any doubts we had about our food. I usually prefer non vegetarian food but if vegetarian food like this was available everywhere, trust me I'd become vegetarian.

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

Was here with my family. The place has got a good ambiance. The food is delicious out here but a more interesting fact to visit this restaurant is the way they present the food. This time we had ordered all different kinds of starters and beverages which we will not find in any other restaurant I guess. It was Monday and we thought that the place would not be crowded. But people had to wait. The rush and that too on a weekday made us astonished. We got some little problem with the service. But this is a place that should not be missed. A must visit place in kolkata.

Really nice to have a place like this in kolkata. Making your own paws with vada, is something different and good to taste too. There staffs is also very well mannered. I was severed by Malik, and he suggested some really good food from the menu. 
Don't miss there deserts, really innovative. I tried bubbling kulfi, Rabdi panagota.. all were more than what I expected.

First visited SpiceKlub in Mumbai. Was very thrilled when they came to Kolkata. The food quality was nearly as good(they do need bigger pavs for the vada pav since the tiny buns make it a very messy dish to eat.)

However, the five star rating is for the cordial staff. If you are going to visit, then you specifically ask for Shankar ‚Äî you will certainly not be disappointed!

Great hospitality by the staffs from welcoming to pan chocolate. Explaining each and every item in a Sunday's rush like this, is really good to see. The amount of time they are on the table.. makes you feel special. You can say by the smell of the food, how fresh they prepare. 
good job Spiceklub and big thumbs up to you guys..

So happen to cover this place after hearing real good reviews. Its easy to locate and is more of a fine dining restaurant. Gone are those days when we used to bank upon main course. This restaurant will give u finest starters and desserts worth relishing.
Would definitely suggest to try more of those.
We tried all signature dishes as recommended by their chefs and to my surprise all of them had its own tinge of uniqueness. Chole Kulcha with a foam of chutney on top was piquant to core. Even Paneer lapeta with a refreshing minty chutney (made out of molecular gastronomy technique) was delicious.
Not gonna talk about bubbly kulfi as its something which u should discover on ur own. Main course wasn't that great. Would not recommend to try main course. It was just average. They have varieties of chutneys which they offer as complimentary and which is really amazing in taste with a sharp flavour in it. Warm welcoming restaurant, a bit on the expensive side but worth the price if chosen selected items.

Went to this place for dinner and the experience was too too bad! This place serves you the food which has been over experimented! Trying to convert an Indian dish into something else and calling it molecular doesn't really satisfy your taste buds. Over it the server kept on taking about molecular again n again! Ordered 4 dishes and a beverage- 

Lassi- horrible! Don't even try! Who serves a Lassi in a spoon?

Pav bhaji fondue- bhaji churned and topped with cheese. You will start hating the cheese fondue after this. 

Naanza- Naan with cheese (ok)

Alu Bharwan- again with cheese and spoils the crave for a tandoori dish!

Roomali with cheese- the only good item here!

Overall not recommended!

Didn't get too much time, neither had a great appetite on my first visit but the hospitality was one of its kind after very very long which is why this rating. We went expecting a casual dining experience as marked on zomato but it is actually a fine dining. So, we ordered for a rumali cheese papad, it is amaa√†aaazing. They serve 8-10 kinds of condiments to each table to go with the food served which was again a class apart. Since we were just 2 and our appetite also was not much for that time we couldn't eat beyond this one dish. So we ordered a kala khatta mojito. This again was amazing and was presented in a very unique way. Have planned to revisit with a big group and a bigger appetite soon!

Spice Klub is one of the best restaurants for dining in Kolkata, for the simple reason that it offers a perfect all round experience. The servers were excellent, who took great care of us throughout the meal, an ordeal that was necessary given the nature of the dishes!
The food tastes excellent, but more than the taste, it was the presentation that was to watch out for! The dishes were themed in quite an innovative fashion, and were designed to blow our minds away, and they did!

I have been eating in park street since long, so I'm familiar with many vegetarian restaurants over there. In search of new taste i entered in this restaurant SPICE KLUB. It is opened couple of months back. First thing first, nice cosy ambience, comfortable sitting. Going through menu they have variety of appetisers and chaat, and a nice menu card ( though alu dam was missing from it, but still they kept it good) well in main course I ordered moti paneer makhani, veg makhanwala and dal kabila with veg dum biryani and in breads garlic cheese butter nan, butter nan and wholewheat butter roti. Order was served in satisfactory time. Main course was awesome, specially paneer dish and veg makhanwala was spicy treat. There dal was not up to the mark and so was there breads. Veg dum biryani was nice, perfectly blended with spices and vegetables. Thats why i was planning to give them 3, but at the end they asked to have the dessert bubbling kulfi. And man that was some experience, regular kulfi upgraded into something very unique. Must must go for this KULFI. Overall for a wonderful dining experience, visit it once.

If you've been to a Fancy restaurant before. You'll know that this restaurant is nothing better than a restaurant with an average kitchen and is extremely overpriced. It is a pleasure to your eyes but not your palettes. The ambience is good. But the complexity of the food takes away the fun of having a casual meal. And there is this one certain waiter who is completely obsessed with the food and menu there and is going to repeat this line "All the food here is gastronomic molecular food" a million times when you ask him anything. I'd suggest you go and ask for Hussain who serves you like a normal waiter should, and better your experience to some extent. 
Coming to the food. It is too complex to eat. A normal pani puri with so many complications just kills the beauty of the simplicity of the dish. 
But the "Kulfi" is to die for. I could just ignore all the above and go to the restaurant for the Kulfi.

Hm, Spiceklub!!
Was waiting to go here for a long time, but was not getting a table for 5 constitutive attempts, which made me think on so what's so great here! 
At last I got lucky and landed here. The food is the best till now I have tasted, take quality, quantity , freshness all together. Taking service on the other hand, was again positive. There way of explaining good, dressing manner, there responsiveness towards the guests all were great. 
There starters are in a heavier side, the beverages are sorbet style, main course is regular, good in taste and quantity, and deserts are in stone rock style. Makes you wait for everything but you can make it out with the freshness. 
Coming to deserts which is my fav, they serve you molecular deserts, some that you can have without spoons and have to use your hands (soap cake), where as bubbling kulfi you can't have directly without mixing with there in house flavours. It seems there deserts have long history and goddam you have to remember it to get into love with it. 
Decor is good, simple, elegant, but can be worked on in future.

‚ÄúSo are you going to SpiceKlub on Thursday? Been a long time since I‚Äôve met you and I‚Äôm really looking forward‚Äù The response was ‚ÄúYou going to a¬†pure vegetarian restaurant? Wow! Your wonders never cease to¬†amaze me‚Äù This is an excerpt from a conversation I was having with Shikha a.k.a Sorelle Grapevine after we were invited to lunch at SpiceKlub, the latest restaurant in Park Street specializing in molecular gastronomy and pure vegetarian food. If¬†you know me well, you will not find Shikha‚Äôs reaction surprising because I pretty much¬†never go to a restaurant to eat a pure vegetarian meal. Why did I agree to go to SpiceKlub? Because 1) I‚Äôve heard good things about the¬†food and read reviews praising it¬†2) I saw the IG stories of a couple of bloggers who went before me and¬†what they posted looked really delicious. To find out if the¬†restaurant¬†is as good as people claim it to be, I decided to go and try it out myself.

I have already been to Spiceklub Mumbai and I had high expectations from this Kolkata outlet as well.
Me and my family went there on the 31st eve and got seats within 15 mins of arrival. 

As soon as you arrive they give you 8 sorts of chutney / pickle / salad . Loved the taste of the 
cabbage salad which was there in it.
The impression about its ambiance ,its¬† just average compared to its Mumbai Outlet. Nothing much to ride home about . 

The place is known for its molecular gastronomy dishes.¬† We had ordered 3-4 starters . All were good as its the USP of the place. Highlighted one was cheese papad .

Then we ordered main course . Paneer curry , Black dal , cheese garlic nan , masala kulcha .
I really loved the taste of the Cheese garlic nan . The curry and dal were just ok , they need to work on this department .

Lastly we ordered roomani papads . For just 4 portions of lil papdas I guess 220 + bucks is a little too much. 

I know there deserts are awesome but didn't try it this time as our stomachs were already full.

Overall its a one time visit place considering the uniqueness .

SpiceKlub - Also known as molecular gastronomy is one the 3 brands run by the Guptas. The other 2 being Quattro & Rolling pin. 

Being in the food industry for over years, they know exactly what is innovation and taking hospitality to a level where only few can match upto them. 

Our server was Shankar and we were pretty impressed with his knowledge on each every dish and also his suggestions where lip smacking.

Fantastic, Awesome and lots of new dishes to look forward to. Had one of the most memorable evening yesterday at Spiceklub. We were ¬†Attended by Wiki ,who had great knowledge about the dishes available and suggested few ones seeing our taste and likes. For Beverages we choose Seasonal Fruit Lassi and Kokum Margeritta with Chilli Cavier. We also ordered Roomali Cheese Papad. The Seasonal Fruit Lassi is an Extraordinary Dish.Never had one like this .Would Very Strongly recommend every one to try . It is ¬†very similar to the signature dish of The Greatest Indian Chef Gaggan on his documentary which I saw on Netflix . Starters like Hazari Panner Tikka was very good and Galouati Kebabs matched the Galouati ¬†of Peter Cat ,the one we have grown up having at Peter Cat. ¬†
The Desserts were to die for . We had Bubbling Kulfi. I will tell you I am great foodie and practically eat 3-4 times outside every week but never had something like this. It simply made our Dinner memorable and worth remembering. Though we were full but mind wanted to try more which we will do again when I visit them again.Do try their new items instead of going for Safer Choices .My suggestion At such places with fantastic new times main course can be easily left and replaced with Only Drinks , Starters, And Desserts.The Manager is worth mentioning as He was taking very good care of All the guest and helping them in choosing their items and explaining how to enjoy them. I would certainly visit them again and again.

Date of Visit ‚Äì 09/12/2016

Location ‚Äì  Located on the 1st floor of famous Magma Building near park street-camac street crossing. Best part is that they have valet parking without which its a headache to park car in park street.

Ambiance ‚Äì The interiors are classy with dimmed lighting. Seating capacity is about 90 to 100 seater.

Service ‚Äì I felt staffs were well trained. They need to explain each item they are serving which was very well done. Special mention of Mr. Shankar who had taken care of our table, suggested us their speciality and made our experience memorable. 

Food & Description ‚Äì It was my anniversary and I decided to try this newly opened restaurant at park street. This place is a molecular gastronomic destination which serves pure vegetarian food in north indian cuisine in a modern style. Molecular gastronomy is all about igniting your taste buds with visual treats and amazing tastes. In most of the reviews I saw it suggested to have starters and deserts and skipping the main course. The same was suggested by Mr. Shankar. But we tried main course too and we loved it. Food we tried :

Chutneys & Dips ‚Äì We were served 8 varieties of chutneys & dips like mint chutney, garlic mayonise, raw mango etc before our foods were served.  These were different and they also suggested which dip will go with which starter.

Roomali Cheese Papad - It is a thin and crispy rumali roti topped with grated cheese, chopped corriander and chillies. It tasted great but paying 225rs for a papad is little too much. Portion size is good. Try it for a different flavour. 

Hazari Paneer Tikka - It is paneer tikka served in SpiceKlub style on a marble box covered with grill and the vapour coming out of it.The paneer cubes are marinated with hung yoghurt and topped with onions, chillies and coriander. It tasted good but the dish was served that hot.

Pav Bhaji Fondue ‚Äì Its a big bowl of bhaji converted into fondue topped with melted cheese served with small cubes of semi roasted pav. We loved the taste of bhaji fondue. I felt portion of pav was less. We had to order for extra pav to complete the fondue. To keep the fondue hot, a candle was lit below fondue. Highly recommended.

Mushroom & Spinach Shaslik ‚Äì This is divine for mushroom lovers. One of the best mushroom starter I have ever had. Mushrooms were too soft to melt in mouth, stuffed with cheese & spinach, marinated in three styles with three pieces each. Must try for mushroom lovers.

Chole Kulche ‚Äì Its mini breads cut into halves with chola in between topped with foam. It was a visual treat but failed impress my taste buds. Not recommended.

¬†

Dal Makhani ‚Äì It tasted great. I love the creaminess, though it was less on salt.

Moti Paneer Makhani ‚Äì Small cubes on cottage cheese in makhani gravy. It was very tasty. I would recommend it for those trying main course.

Cheese Nan ‚Äì Nans were soft and cheesy. I believed that this softness in nan cannot be done without putting egg into it. But to my surprise they did it without it. Highly recommended.

Chili Cheese Garlic Nan ‚Äì I had first of this kind. Cheesy nan topped up with garlic n chillies. Loved it.

Mango on the rocks ‚Äì This mocktail was served in a large wine glass. In the wine glass liquid nitrogen in poured on some elements and is stirred well to make it a semi liquid form. There is also mango juice that can be added. This mocktail is drunk with spoon rather than straw. Loved the taste and presentation.  

Bubbling kulfi ‚Äì I had heard a lot of this dish and trust me it didn‚Äôt disappoints. The dish has a kulfi converted in small chunks with help of liquid nitrogen. It is accompanied with 5 different flavours of concentrates i.e. Rose, Blueberry, Caramel, Rabri, Chocolate.They recommend us to try the kulfi with different flavours in the order stated above so that tastes don‚Äôt override. I loved the desert to the core. A must have at this place.

Overall loved the place. Pure vegetarian place serving North Indian food in modern techniques is a rare combination. Though tried so many items would love to try other items too. Its pricing is heavy on pocket. Will surely go back for the varieties of items they serve and for the experience.

Walked into the place assuming it's just another restaurant in Park Street (it's literally wedged between Marco Polo and Mamagoto) and I was so wrong. The food is surprisingly innovative and extremely well made (cannot say enough good things about the vada pav & bubbly kulfi). The staff is extremely cordial, our server was Sabyasachi & the man was great as a good guide. Definitely worth going for the 2nd and 3rd time.

Molecular Gastronomy Epitomized @ SpiceKlub, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Event: SpuceKlub's One Month Anniversary Celebration + Food Tasting Session 

Date: 23 Nov 2016, 2 pm - 4 pm

Located at the high-street Park Street, SpiceKlub is a recently opened 100% vegetarian restaurant which serves modern Indian Cuisine in fancy and breathtaking molecular gastronomy avatars. 

It is a 100 seater, dim lighted and well furnished eatery, sans any jazz and frill, located on the first floor of Annexe Building, inside the Magma House complex. It's interiors are classy, comprising of - comfortable leather and wooden seatings in the form of chairs and couches hued in red and brown, wooden thick top tables, black patterned false ceiling and pillars, and brown tiled flooring. Bustling view of Park Street is visible from the windows lined on one whole side of the wall adjacent to the kitchen. Background music soars all the time. Loo facility is available.

"Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking.

This term is commonly used to describe a style of cuisine in which chefs explore culinary possibilities by borrowing tools from the science lab and ingredients from the food industry."

The tools used to create the effects of molecular gastronomy are - liguid nitrogen, dry ice, dehydrator, siphon etc., which bring about the magical creation of fog, ice crystals, spheres, caviars, foam etc. out of assorted food items.

SpiceKlub's menu is divided into the following categories - soups, papads, appetizers, main course, dal & rice preparation, raitas, indian breads, desserts, and beverages. The magic of molecular gastronomy is reserved basically for - beverages, appetizers and desserts. An average of 20 food options are available in the beverages and appetizers categories, while 10 plus options are available in the desserts category! The management has wisely kept the comfort food i.e. the main course sans any physical and chemical transformation, which again has around 20 food options. 

The lavish and spectacular food tasting session, that took our breath away, comprised of the following food items -

Beverages -

- Kokum Margherita with Chilli Caviar (Rs. 225/-): A big chilli flavored and frozen chunk of kokum beverage, topped with green and tangy caviars, dipped in icy cold transparent liquid, was served in a glass rimmed with salt. The serving was icy cold, with a dense presence of chilli, and more on the lines of khatta-meetha-teekha ice gola. It was impossible for one person to finish it on his own. 

It was an absolutely new and nice beverage.

- Masala Mojito (Rs. 180): It was a masala shikanji like mojito topped with a lot of coriander leaves. It tasted nice.

- Jamun Punch (Rs. 195/-): Presented in an oversized martini glass, it was a thick and sweet dairy based mocktail, served with a big plum perched on the rim, with some plum concentrate placed alongside. I was required to stir and mix in this concentrate before sipping the beverage. It tasted divine, filling and very freshening.

- Ice Sphere (Rs. 190/-): It was a full of drama mocktail, wherein the whole mocktail is entailed in a beautiful red-peach hued ice sphere. The serving staff broke this sphere with a metallic hammer right in front of us, and gradually the whole thing turned into a drinkable liquid! I did not taste this one, but fully enjoyed the dramatics.

Appetizers -

- Papdi Chaat (Rs. 395/-): In true SpiceKlub style, 6 portions of papdis were served in a long and curved etched glass. Each papdi was topped with yoghurt sphere and green chutney foam, along with the usual tamarind chutney, sev etc. We were required to pop one whole portion in our mouth, to feel the nice burst of all the flavors. It was a beautiful looking dish.

- Pav Bhaji Fondue (Rs. 425/-): A big metallic bowl of bhaji converted into cheesy fondue, and further topped with a healthy dose of melted cheese was served with small portions of semi roasted pav/bread. Small metallic skewers were handed to the diners. We were required to insert the skewers into the bread pieces, pick them up, dip them into the fondue, and finally insert them in our mouth. The food portion was quite large, so the fondue pot was equipped with a live heating mechanism, so as to, keep the fondue hot. 

This dish was a great conversation starter and very addictive, specially the fondue. It had all the qualities of a nice group meal, as it was - good in taste, non messy in eating, easily accessible from all seatings, and served in abundance.

- Vada Pav (Rs. 425/-): This dish was served in quite an interesting manner. It consisted of 8 small pav buns, two small bowls of green and tamarind chutneys, 8 triangular see through and edible sachets of garlic powder, a generous portion of roasted boondi, and 1 big bowl of potato mixture turned into a porridge! I was required to flip open the pav, pour some potato porridge over it, place a garlic powder sachet over it, garnish it with boondis and chutneys, close the pav, and pop the whole thing inside my mouth! 

To be honest, I was not really sure of gulping down a sachet, but the serving guys well explained that it was made of rice and will dissolve instantly, without any discomfort.

This dish tasted quite nice. Inspite of being in the deconstructed form form, this vada pav tasted exactly like the ones that you get in Mumbai!

- Hazari Paneer Tikka (Rs. 375/-): "Cottage Cheese cubes marinated in hung yoghurt and topped with onions, ginger, chillies and coriander, barbecued in a clay oven with onion and capsicum." It was a cylindrical shaped and uniformly charred paneer tikka, served on a straight lined marble boat, which was floored with a metallic jaali. For the ease of serving, the dish was diced at regular intervals. The whole dish looked very beautiful and tasted very rich. This was one of the best paneer tikkas that I have had till date.

- Dahi ke kebab (Rs. 350/-): "Hung yoghurt blended with gram flour and flavoured with spices served with mint and curd spheriphication." 8 delicate kebab portions were served in a long curvaceous melamine dish. 

They looked like mini utthapam and were quite soft in composition. They tasted nice.

- Hara Bhara Kebab (Rs. 325/-): "Favourite Indian appetizer made of spinach, green peas, stuffed with soft processed cheese." 6 kebab portions were artistically presented on a thick black rectangular glass dish. A squared cheese slice was put atop each kebab and a thin fried spinach leaf was arranged between two adjacent kebabs. The accompanying green chutney was arranged in the form of three spinach leaves, which were again topped with tamarind chutney caviars! 

The kebabs were crisp from outside and well cooked from inside. They tasted nice.

- Deconstructed Dhokla (Rs.275/-): SpiceKlub simply nailed the art of deconstruction with this dish. Crumbled yellow khaman dhoklas were served on a thick off white colored dish with opaque icy chunks of coconut chutney placed alongside! The dhokla crumb was artistically topped with an assortment of green chutney foam, tangy green caviars, mango gelatin etc. 

I was required to mix the entire assortment before eating. It tasted simply wonderful. 

Papads -

- Roomali Cheese Papad (Rs. 225/-): Thin roomali roti was topped with grated cheese, chopped chillies and coriander leaves, and roasted. Obviously, the portion was quite big for a papad. 

We ordered this dish to pair it with the remaining pav bhaji fondue. It tasted quite crunchy abd nice.

Desserts -

- Bubbling Kulfi (Rs. 525/-): "Indian Kulfi made into rocks served with an assortment of toppings." A big glass goblet with an attached glass pipe was served with kulfi, which had been transformed into chilled and opaque chunks of ice. The attached pipe fumed off the icy fog that evaporates out of the liquid nitrogen. This kulfi came accompanied with 5 differently flavored semi liquids and concentrates. I was required to place some kulfi chunks on my plate, top it with the flavour(s) of my choice, mix them well, and consume without delay. I tried caramel and rose flavors. 

The whole dish tasted extremely nice. The kulfi tasted like those authentic mawa sweets. This dish was a revelation, both in terms of look and taste!

- Volcano (Rs.425/-): "Chocolate mousse with Peru jelly and Saffron milk." This dish was like a mini-show. It consisted of a chocolate dome, with a hole in the centre, and Peru jelly caviars placed around the bottom, at one end. 2 long and uneven pieces of dehydrated chocolates filled with gulkand were placed at the other end. Somewhere in the middle, 2 miniature egg shaped chocolates, with gold dust patterns on top were placed. The whole dish was dusted with chocolate powder.

The server kept on pouring the saffron milk in the hole of the chocolate dome, which resulted in emergence of dense fumes from the dome's centre. This continued for some time. Then the saffron milk was also poured over the dome. The whole visual effect was that of, oozing gases and lava out of a volcano! 

This chocolatey dish, along with the accompanying chocolates tasted extremely nice. It was a super fancy and spectacular dish.

SpiceKlub uses an assortment of expansive and custom designed utensils, so as to keep the user's dining experience interesting. Most of their serving plates are imported from Europe. The entire staff is well trained to handle the myriad queries and confusions of diners, who need assistance in understanding a dish before ordering and/or need guidance to know the manner of eating a deconstructed dish.

Molecular gastronomy is present in few other city restaurants as well. But noone has mastered it like SpiceKlub, both in taste and presentation.

SpiceKlub is a new place in town. 

There are several places in town which have tried out molecular gastronomy, but SpiceKlub is one of the finest places to visit. 

Recommendations: 
1. Have the appetisers , mocktails and Desserts. Try not having the main course since it's the same as any other restaurant a person goes to.

2. They have a special dessert known as Bubbling Kulfi. This kulfi has been frozen (obviously) but at -196 degree Celsius. Try it with all the flavours they provide. 

3. Rumali Cheese Papad is delicious. 

----
Price is a bit on the upper side and comes to ‚Çπ1,500 for two approximately!

The new place in town. Right in front of the Magma building. Serving modernized Indian Cuisine. You wouldn't want to reject the place only due to the Menu which wouldn't capture the essence of the place.

The food has freshness written all over it. Having said this, the portions are extravagant and to try a range here.. better take a group along.

I would seriously advise you to not take a look at the menu before you go.. just go.

My Order :

Naanze: Would recommend them to cut down on the overhead cheese and improve on the sauce. However the Naan Filling...*Left speechless*.

Hazaari Paneer Tikka: Paneer was home made..Hence was extremely soft. Loads of garlic on the outside. Overall a bang.

We were just 2... were almost full.. :(

Dessert:

Flower Pot: Just have. No questions asked.

Rating :

Food : 5

Decoration: 2

Service: 3

P.S. The food serving is unique..prepare to be amazed..even if you see all the pictures here.

A treat to the eyes as well as the taste buds..
Truly a wonderful experience..
We ordered pav bhaji fondu very cheesy yummy nd filling, chana kulcha which was served to us in form of mini burgers not much to say about the taste.
For the deserts we tried faluda (on suggestion of Mr. Shankar one of the server there) which I will say a must try item, it was super delicious.
The servers here are so nice and friendly, almost everyone maintaining a smile. Overall a nice experience.

Visited on a Sunday, with prior reservations but still had to wait for 10 minutes. They provide vallet parking services, definitely bonus points for this, because of its location! 
Ambience: Not at all good. Feels like you have been made to sit in a congusted and unorganised room! Nothing impressive about the interiors.
Starters:
CHILLY PALAK SOUP: A little thick soup, with perfect combination of flavours. A unique soup! Try if you like tasting new things.
ROOMALI CHEESE PAPAD: a huge papad,topped with four types of cheese. Would have tasted even better if accompanied with some chaat masala and salad. But a good one!
PAPADS OF INDIA: basically a papad platter which has 7 different types of papad. Order if you are a PAPAD FAN!
PANEER LAPETA: quite unique and tasty in its own way. Small portions of hot paneer  wrapped with tiny pieces of papad accompanied with a cold jelly spheres of mint chutney. Must try!
BHARWAAN AALOO : Normal stuffed potatoes served in a sizzling platter. A very fancy way to present it.

We couldn't manage much space after eating the starters so ended up just ordering Dal makhani and Garlic naan which were quite average.

Although we did order two drinks! And both of them aced their game.
SEASONAL FRUIT LASSI: cannot be expressed though words. Just order and be surprised! 
MANGO ON THE ROCKS: do not judge the drink because it has MANGO! The drink is presented in the most stylish way possible and tastes amazingly good. 

A good place overall! And also they give you paan flavoured chocolates and the end. Don't miss that.

In Spiceklub they do not want us to only have the food and leave..... they want us to have a complete and satisfying experience right from the word go....starting from the crockery, the water jug,the ambience and their awesome Food presentation. The service staff are courteous and helpful, suggesting gently what we could order,not pushing too aggressively.Their specialties are their drinks, starters and desserts and that what we went for. It was molecular gastronomy at its best and all the dishes had that WOW moment when it was presented. Starting from the galauti kebab, the paneer tikka, the vada Pav,the kulcha Chana and the rumali cheese papad.... fabulous in presentation and great taste too. Also loved the fruit lassi which was served in small starter spoons and was just too good.. Nothing like the ordinary lassi, in fact wasn't a drink at all!!! The other drinks too were awesome,with the Peru mousse one being my favourite.We wanted to try the bubbling kulfi but we're so full that we decided to bypass it and postpone our tasting to another visit to this place, hopefully soon.
Definitely recommended for a great experience.

Had been willing to come to this place for a very long time but frankly the wait was not worth it. Tried Naanza which was just average, Chola Kulcha which is supposed to be one of their molecular specialities which looked very good but did not taste very well which got me a little disappointed but the Bubbling Kulfi just made it up for everything, the dips, rabri, the rock hard kulfi were all perfect making it a must try for all those stepping up this place next. The place and the ambience is just average nothing very great but the staff here is very helpful and the service is also equally good.

I wish u could rate in negeative.  They dont even deserve 1 star rating.

One of the worst dining experience i ever had.. irritating waiters. They think we are pre school kids who need to be taught how to stir our drinks , dip our fondues or bite the bread. 

Imagine the odacity of the waiter serving us. When he served a drink to one of my friend. He literary tried to teach him how to stir the drink to enjoy the drink. Like seriously .. 

It doesnt ends here. Afta serving the paw bhaji fondue he explains us how to dip the in the fondue. 

Virgin mojito was masala sikanji.. soup was cold , thick n tasteless. , food was pathetic. It is restro which cant even prepare thier dal or roti well.. n they charge u a premium for it. 

Upon callin for the check afta havin the most disgusting food in my life. 

The waiter tells us " sir , itne dur aaye ho .. desert toh lena banta hai " 

Which restro asks u for it like this. ?? I felt i was sittin in some roadside dhabba on some national highway n the chottu askin me klitne dur aaye ho. Icecream ya meetha toh lena banta hi hai. 

You guys really think u belong to a premium location . If u ask me. Spice klub was a joke. This is kinda place which spoils ur entire dining experince n then makes u feel why did i tried something new. 

I never ever wish to see it again in this life time.

After reading all the mixed reviews, was hesitant to try the food, but it was definitely worth the try! 
The frozen mango drink was very good and so were the starters, namely paneer tikka, chola kulcha, papdi chaat, galauti kebab. Had ordered masala mojito which wasn't good at all. The portions of starters are small but the main course quantity is pretty good. I found the mains very tasty especially the breads are perfect. Onion kulcha and garlic naan are a must try. All in all good experience, ambience also good.
The only thing to be mentioned is that the food was a bit too spicy and not for the faint hearted at all. Kudos for a good comprehensive and elaborate menu!

Newly opened place in Park Street has valet parking, which most of the restaurant in the area lacks.

Interiors and the ambiance is ok, nothing extraordinary.

We ordered cheese papad, smoked paneer tikka for starters both of which were nice. 

For the mains the dal was horrible, it was almost not edible, the mixed veg ordered was not bad, but nuthing gr8 also.

They had a variety of breads and we orders 4-5 different variety, and all of them tasted the same. They just tasted butter.

Was disappointed trying this place as had very high expectation. Would give it a try once more sometime later hoping for better food.

After wanting to try this place since it opened, we finally went yesterday. And we left saying we have to visit again as one can't fully explore and experience all that the place has to offer. We tried soups so we missed on the mocktails which from the look of it (at other tables) seemed very interesting. And starters, there's a whole lot of options so its difficult to choose what to try and what to forego. The presentation and the molecular gastronomy punch definitely speaks for itself. And thankfully, the staff is well trained and they know what they are serving. Main course also tastes well but one should try more of their starters as that's their USP. The portion size is pretty good. Now desserts, after a wholesome and delicious meal we were more than full but had to try their signature dessert - the bubbling kulfi. It was something. I couldn't get enough of the rabri and the caramel that came with it. The taste still lingers in my mouth. This place is a vegetarian paradise and i am so glad about it. Kolkata needs more such places for sure. Until then, i will keep going back to this place for sure.

I went yesterday (26/11/2016) for my pre birthday celebration.. it was my first visit and I was overwhelmed by the ambience of the place.. the serving style is just out of the box.. Steward named Ronnie was serving us and he did his job professionally and with grace..! The food is just too good.. we had starters ( ordering 8 dishes) and by the end of the starters our stomach was full and missed out on desserts..
Will surely visit again ..!

Vegetarians have always had this thing to crib ¬†that Kolkata doesn't have good vegetarian joints. But off late they can't say so as they have too many options, be it Mumbai Local in Ballygunge or SpiceKlub. SpiceKlub brings some great innovation in the food industry. SpiceKlub Mumbai is said to be one of the pioneers of molecular gastronomy so how can you expect anything less with its Kolkata counterpart. Try their Molecular Vada Pav or their Pav Bhaji Fondue and you will understand what I mean. Probably there are many restaurants that offer molecular food but I bet no one can do it as good as SpiceKlub

A long wait for before an authentic Indian restaurant came to town, their secret of success lies in the food they serve. Exemplary personalised service and an attractive presentation is a plus. 

Called for an Ice Sphere, was wondering how it would be. Eventually turned out to be a great burst of fruit flavours expressed with Soda. Found the name of sundried tomato and black olives naan to be interesting as I wanted to see how far it has travelled from the pizza, actually it is a completely Indian form of the Italian bread. It couldn't be distinguished in taste because the flavours of the veggie overtook in all regards. 

Don't know if I would rate it that high to other restaurants but it certainly deserves acknowledgement. Very simply decorated and just well lit too. Subtle ambience I would call it. 

Unfortunately my non-veggie friends would not like to come here as they serve molecular food and NO ALCOHOL either.

Chocolate paan burst in the end was just wow!!!

I was totally in love with SpiceKlub Mumbai last year. When I heard its coming to Kol, I was absolutely amazed. The taste was the same here wanting me to come again and again. The fact that its pure veg is a total plus point.Food no doubt is awesome especially the presentation. All the items we ordered were unique as well. Highly recommended .

They totally deserve a 5. The food is brilliant. They have gastronomy based items but its very few,  still compared to what others offer its amazing l. The cheese papad and naanza (panner naan made in pizza style) is must. Other starters are also good pav bhaji and all.  We dint order the paneer tikka but we saw the way they presented it,  and it was really good.  The main course the dal makhani was too good,  a must have along with sun-dried tomato and olives naan. Even the malai kofta was good. Their beverages were also good. The best part is desserts.  We wanted to try everything but we were almost full.  But do try the Volcano absolutely brilliant and outstanding . The cone-o-mania dessert was not that good,  it was bad. Mr. Vicky was very helpfull and he was eagerly explaining us everything what they are and all. I deducted. 5 points because i found a strand of hair in one of d items,  they were apologetic and it was fine. Not to miss -  dal makhani,  volcano,  cheese papad. 
They accept cash and card. Very friendly staff a big thumbs up to them.

SpiceKlub is definitely a one of its kind restaurants to have opened its doors in the city of joy! First things first, do not expect very fast service nor should you expect the ambience to be out of the world. But what you can definitely expect is a new taste palette, very interesting menu and some really tasty food! 

Since we were just the two of us, as advised by the staff there, we stuck to the starters drinks and desserts. This was something I'd never done before but none the less it was worthwhile. 

We ordered for the Paapdi Chaat, Hazari Paneer Tikka, the Fruit Lassi and the Flower Pot. All the dishes were really nice, though the highlight was definitely the Paneer tikka! 

On the whole it's a bit overpriced but it has a menu every food lover must explore! Looking forward to my next visit soon.

The place is not lighted at all . The food is only for show and not for taste try the food on your risk and the staff is not well behaved at all one has to ask multiple times for a order and still they get no reply . 
I would suggest that don't visit this place at all its a spoiler and waste of money and time .

We dined here yesterday and let me state that it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The service is slow and by slow i mean sedated, time consuming and painstakingly lengthy. We ordered for three starters and the main course. By the time we were served out food we completely lost our appetite. We had to call the manager thrice just to get our food delivered to our table.

The food is very average and the ambiance is boring. Would not recommend.

The vegetarians of Kolkata have a reason to celebrate as more and more quality fully vegetarian restaurants are opening up in our city. The latest to join this bandwagon is the SpiceKlub off Park Street. 

Part of the famous Mumbai chain this is a fully vegetarian fine dining restaurant with Jain options. The cuisine is basically North Indian and chaats but with a twist. 

Here they have tried molecular gastronomy with the regular Indian appetisers giving a quite exciting form. The regular items like pav bhaji, puchkas, papdi chaat etc have all undergone molecular transformation and presented in a very innovative manner keeping the traditional taste intact. 

We enjoyed all the appetisers like the roomali cheese papad, papdi chaat, bharwan aloo etc   Since the appetisers were quite filling and heavy, we went straight for the desserts one of which was cotton soft rasmalai inside tempered chocolate pot. 
The only downside is the serving time for each item which is bit slow. 

Overall a great gastronomic experience with an average of 300-400 per dish.

Booked a table for 9.30 and as we reached were asked to wait along with many others who were facing the same situation . First signs of overbooking and mismanagment . Anyways was made to feel obliged as we took our table after a while . The ambience inside has nothing to write home about and moreover the table placement is too close for comfort . Yet another negative that is . The food well starters were poor and the main course average with no stand out dish in our order atleast . All in all a difficult to repeat venue unless they really change something drastic . The good part was the prompt service on the table

North Indian food with a twist. The place is grt. Yummy food,inovative way of presenting it. Have been to other gastronomy using restros bt this 1 stands apart from the lot. Must try u will love the place. Management and servers wer very helpful. Reservation is a must and visit the place with time in ur hand as dish takes time to be prepared. Would have given 5* but 1* deducted due to service and half added due to management.

Was searching something new in parkstreet and then bam, here i was!! Having the same menu in other resturant i thought it will the same experience as the rest!! But i was totally wrong!! From the time i had the bottle of water and chutney caddy (with super 8 flavours) till my last bubling kulfi desert, and a flower pot with rasmallai inside that ( seriously), it was marvelous experience!! 
A peaceful environment with super curious staffs, awesome presentation of food, with sinful taste, what else do we can ask for!! On the top the complementary  chocolate pan was cherry on the top! Waiting for last 45min to get a table it was worth every second!! 
Shankar a super hilarious and a great knowledge in food was the guy who helped me to choose the best from all!! But what he said was "caution any food will be coming in 30 to 35 min as it is a molecular kitchen! I was like OK!! But when it was there in my table we were like, wow!! It gives you a complete fine dine feel! 
After everything the best part was when u get treated like a king and the operation head attends you saying how was the food, and asks for your suggestion if any improvement can be done!! Cheers guys!!  üëçüëç

I have never cared for writing reviews on Zomato though I enjoy reading them, but my experience at Spiceklub has compelled me to do so. 
In one word - fantabulous.
It's everything I would probably expect from a Michelin starred restaurant - amazing food, excellent presentation along with very courteous staff. Our host was extremely jolly and recommending us dishes right from the starters to the drinks to the desserts.
The service was spot on and so was the food. 
These days a lot of restaurants try to focus a lot on fancy presentations but sadly lose out on food quality and taste. Spiceklub, however, stood out on both these counts and I would recommend it to everyone looking out for a great dining experience.

Location-Park street,Kolkata.

Atlast the most awaited restaurant on our wishlist has opened its gate to Kolkata.This place is a molecular gastronomic destination which serves pure vegetarian food in north indian cuisine.We were just astonished by the amazing creativity that they do with the food using scientific technique.Along with the creativity the food and service were also of top notch.

Service-The service at this place really surprised us.Their way of introducing each and every element from the chutneys and pickles to Appetizers to dessert was very enchanting.Believe us that our whole order was their recommendation and it didnot disappoint us a bit.Along with that the food service was also extremely fast.All thanks to "Sabyasachi" who was our host for the day.

Ambiance-This place has a really calm and soothing ambiance and can accomodate approximately 40-45 people at a time.The interiors have been kept quite simple to keep the focus on food.

Food-The food recommended and served was excellent.The presentation was just of top notch.We just skipped the main course and had the appetizer.Beverages and Dessert.We had-

‚û°Hazari paneer tikka-This dish is a sort of paneer tikka served in Spiceklub style  on a marble box covered with grill and the nitrogen vapor coming out from the sides.The paneer cubes are marinated and grained with chopped garlic which just make the dish worth having.

‚û°Rumali cheese papad-They have a good and unique variety in papads.The one we ordered was a thin and crispy rumali roti wholly covered with different varieties of cheese and chopped corriander and chillies.This dish tastes like a thin crust pizza prepared in an Indian style.

‚û°Mango on the rocks-This was the beverage we ordered.We have seen such kind of beverages but it was the first time we tasted it and trust us that the taste was divine.In a large wine glass sort of thing there will be some elements in which liquid nitrogen is poured and stirred till the mixture comes in a semi liquid state.

‚û°Galouti kebab-The texture of the kebab is so soft that it just melts in the mouth.It comes on a small roti sort of thing topped with onion but is quite bitter to taste.

‚û°Bubbling kulfi-We were looking for some chocolate flavoured dessert but our host just advised us to try this Kulfi styled in Spiceklub style.The dish has a  kulfi converted in small pieces of stones with help of liquid nitrogen and comes with 5 varieties of dip(Rose,Blueberry,Caramel,Rabri,Chocolate).They recommend to try the kulfi with different dips in the order stated above.

‚û°Dips and chutneys-This was not like the usual chutney and dips we get in other restaurants.We were really impressed by its variety and taste.They serve 8 varieties in chutney from garlic to corriander to raw mango and many more.All tasted extremely well especially the raw mange one.

All the above dishes were extremely good in taste and presentation but one dish that we loved the most was their"Bubbling Kulfi".We were just carried away by its concept and taste.

Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Ambiance-4/5

We highly recomment this restaurant and really appreciate their different experiments with food.We hope to see some more new experiments in near future.

I went there for the 1st day 1st show, the day they opened in Kolkata along with my wife and 2 yr old kid. I read about them in an introductory article in Telegraph and decided to give it a try and what a decision it turned out to be!

Great place, amazing hospitality and service (special mention to Mr Sabyasachi who attended us). Every item that we tried on his recommendation was a delight for a foodie and vegetarian like me. But the best part was that my wife and kid, who prefer non veg outside, loved every bit of their lunch that day.

Recommendation - Please plan a group visit to this place so that you can try the spread of varieties they have on offer. Among the items we tasted, please do try - special lassi, Aloo bharwan and multi flavored kulfi.

Eagerly looking forward to a repeat visit here soon. :)

All the best for their new venture here.
