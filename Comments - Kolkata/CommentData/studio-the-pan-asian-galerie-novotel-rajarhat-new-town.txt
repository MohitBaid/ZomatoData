We had our 31st, Pre New Years lunch at Novotel Kolkata. We had a table reserved at the Studio, but later we were requested to shift to The square since preparations for the New Year’s Eve party was going on at the studio. 
The staff was courteous enough to arrange for a table and the same studio menu for us at the Square. 
We went full on Japanese with a tinge of Chinese for our lunch. We ordered torikatsu, tori teriyaki, chicken chilli garlic noodles, prawn chilli garlic noodles and tiramisu. Torikatsu was one of the best starters I’ve ever had and has definitely become one of my favourites, tori teriyaki with the chilli garlic noodles tasted absolutely delicious, the meat was tender and perfectly cooked. All in all it was a filling meal, and the food tasted so good that we ate more than usual. 
Mr. Sanjay C was very courteous and looked after us very well, no negative marks. 
I’ve been to probably every luxury hotel in Kolkata, and I must say the Novotel staff stands at par with all the top hotels!

Awful food and service. Food experience couldn’t have been worst. 
Management should look into the food being served, as instructions are not followed, cold food is served even after taking an hour to serve the starters. 
Not expected from hotel property like Novotel

Was searching for an Asian cuisine restaurant in Rajarhat and saw this place on Zomato and thought of trying it out.

Location - Inside Novotel Hotel in Rajarhat.

Ambiance - Very classy and beautiful. Its a proper fine dine in place and gives a very calm and comfortable feel. We reached around 10.30 pm and we were the only people there.

Service - Good in terms of staff behaviour but very slow. The food took forever to come. Given we were the only people it should have been faster than regular time, instead it was quite slow.

Food - This is what we ordered

# Tom Yum Soup - Okiesh. Tom Yum is supposed to be tangy and that tanginess is brought by using tamarind extract. Instead it was make with tomatoes used for tanginess. The flavour was compromised.

# Pad Thai Noodles - Decently good. I felt there was a tad too much on tamrind in it. Its supposed to be tangy but not so tangy. All my friends however loved them.

# Jasmine Rice - Superb..it's rare to get the authentic jasmine rice fragrance..the fragrance itself was tempting

# Thai Green Curry - Very good..full of flavours..winning dish from the order

Overall a good place to go for enjoying some authentic Thai Cuisine. Yet to try other options of Japanese, Malaysian and Indonesian cuisines from the menu.

Recommend - Yes

This was my first visit to the place along with some of my foodie friends for our monthly meet. For my veg starter I had some vegetable fritters, grilled pineapple and tofu satay. I liked the pineapple but the rest were not something to write home about. They did have veg sushi which the others quite liked. Seeing that I cant have seaweed I gave them a miss. The Wo Tip dimsum was really nice and I loved its presentation. 

Personally though the mains were quite nice I feel that the desserts were the stars of the show. We had Galangal Poached Pear with Mascarpone Cream and Studio Garden.

I have a story going in my family through generations, one where a great grandparent once went to dine in a five star some 70 odd years ago. We never were city folk and it is said that the flabbergasted grandparent after taking his seat was presented with a menu which was as alien to him as commonsense to media persons these days.

I've been to this place numerous times- over food tasting sessions as well as my family paid visits. Now, over this time, I've seen a strange characteristics of this place and let me write on the same this time. Let me be frank, the food is damn good here- in fact excellent and moreover, the presentation is breath-taking. The baos are good and so is the satay. In fact this is one of the very few places in town where a chicken supreme is used rather than chicken breast. So, basically, the details are taken cared off minutely. But the problem is the portion size- its very very small for Kolkata palette. There might be some reason with the management, but this problem persists. But, if somebody is looking for quality over quantity, Studio wins hands down.

I have a soft corner for Studio, especially after they made a stunning tempura vegetables one rainy day. It is with this wonder I sat down to a meal which turned out to be a series of fantastic finds. We started the meal with an assortment of starters - a log of grilled pineapple segregated some crisp tempura, and chicken satay, grilled to perfection and served with a terrific peanut sauce. We moved on to the Sushi - I was  a fan of the  vegetarian version, with a pungent, fresh wasabi that cleaned out our collective sinuses, and made us thankful for being alive. This was followed by a pair of dim sums - the Wo Tip had a lovely burnt bottom while the Char Siu was something I wished was made with pork, because the chicken version was nice, but needed more body, for the lack of a better word. In our main courses,  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the vegetables - crunchy broccoli and snow peas with a touch of sesame oil. My other favorite was the Malaysian Stewed pork belly (and I forgot to take photos of it). Desserts were superb, and I might have loved the "Studio Garden" more than the poached pears.

Went there for our anniversary dinner. ordered two starters - Chicken Dimsums and Korean mangchis chicken. Both were good, not exceptional. When it came to main course, we were utterly disappointed. As my wife is pregnant, we didn't want to take a risk, and requested for suggestions. We wanted something tasty as well as something without basil. The waiter served Yaki Soba noodles and some chicken dish not listed on the menu, which they claimed to be a chef special. We expected that the waiter would consult before finalising the order. However when they said its chef special, we thought of taking a chance. However both the noodles and the "chef special" chicken dish seemed like cooked in the same soya based gravy. Moreover one of them had too much salt. The combination of both the dish was too bad. We couldn't finish half of the serving and requested for the bill. The staff apologised and offered a desert to make up for the bad experience. The desert was equally disappointing. Overall, friendly staff, good starters , disappointing main course and grossly disappointing suggestions.

Highly disappointed with the restaurant.
Today evening,I went there with my friend and we ordered just desserts: chocolate mousse and a lime tart.
The waiter asked if we wanted any starters and anything in main course to which we said No. He called the manager and the manager told us that we can't just order desserts, you have to order some main course or starter item too. We said that we only want the desserts and he asked us to leave the restaurant. 
I am never ever going back to that restaurant.

I have no shame in admitting that I’m a carnivore to the core. Not that I don’t eat veggies at all. I do because I obviously have to take care of my health and we all know how nutritious vegetables are but that’s pretty much the only reason why I have them. And eating a pure vegetarian Oriental meal? Never in my life prior to our lunch meet at Stud!o, Novotel Kolkata’s newest Pan Asian restaurant. In fact, Stud!o is actually much more than a restaurant. It is more of a club with a youthful vibe, electric music, happening events and eclectic F&B offerings under the same roof. I had gone for the launch event of Stud!o and loved the food that was served so was really looking forward to trying out their Pan Asian specialties.

Dined out here to try out the oriental flavours of Asia and can vouch for the fact that they serve one of the most authentic flavours of the region available in Kolkata. The ambience is great with quite a relaxing level of lighting to authenticate the setup. I liked the fact that the restaurant has been kept away from the hustle-bustle of the Novotel Hotel's lobby and family restaurant, providing the much needed privacy to dine in.

My Recommendations : Piña Colada Mocktail, Ebi No Tenpura from Japan, Chicken and Glass Noddle Spring Roll, Uramaki, Har Gow, Char Sui, Chocolate Mousse and Salted Caramel Kaffir Lime Tart. Their lady bartender is spot on with the drinks. You can either go ahead with your regular drinks or give her your flavour recommendation and she will come up with an array of cocktail & mocktail suggestions for you. I tried out their version of Piña Colada mocktail which was infused with a strong essence of Lemongrass and was absolutely spot on!

We ordered the chef deaigned 1.. 

The starters and the soup were very good.... Loved them. . We were served two kind of sushi.. one was very good .... did not like the radish sushi at all.  The main course was okay.. in dessert we had poached pears .. i will suggest people to go for ala carte instead of chefs designed.. the ordered food was a lot for us ..

My wife and I visited this place on the night of 13th August to find that it was turned into an discotheque/lounge with loud music and drunk men all over the place. I thought I had reached the wrong location but the staff told me the place had been converted into a disco for a private party. 

I think Novotel doesn't take this restaurant seriously, why else would they shut down a restaurant on a Saturday night??!! 

Hugely disappointed! Better call the restaurant before coming or be ready for such rude surprises!

Food prices reasonable...offer 1:1 offer on drinks!

They were kind enough to offer shots as complimentary drinks! Food is top notch. The offers are available on Fridays with some live music! Amazing ambiance, amazing people...they are a 5 star property but with a lot of humbleness.

Yesterday after a harrowing week, I wanted to relax and catch up on life with my family and therefore headed towards this place as it's closer to office. Honestly I did not expect much from this place but yesterday, everything was absolutely ten on ten! From the vegetarian dimsums that they served to the tossed chicken, taste was simply yummy! Yes, the chicken spring rolls were not really up to the mark. Nonetheless special brownie points for the chef's recommended dimsums, the taste of which is absolutely out of this world! They had an offer for brewed drinks which we tried and again, service and service style was amazing! The special mocktails that they tossed up for my 7 year old were pretty good 👌 The ambience was really cosy and warm with few people dropping by for a drink or two, lovely decor and soothing music. Not a lullaby and neither a head-banger! Overall I had a lovely experience and could end my week on a very relaxing note! Good job guys 👌

The best view  of the swimming pool if you are sitting beside the window panes.Speechless on the topic of Ambience .
Very spacious restaurant selling some authentic japaneese sushi :) 
The dimsum we ordered were served in 6 pieces.
Sushi was adviced to have with a vinegar like liquid they had provided. It was wrapped with rice and the fish within. Came in a plate of 6 pieces..
Then we had ordered some taiwanish rice along with lamb . And they were beautifully tasty.
Coming to the value of money, sushi and dimsum might seem little costly but yeah the main course was as per its quality only 😊

It was my birthday dinner and studio being long in the hype list , i was pretty excited to treat my best mate on the special eve. The restaurant on the first floor is very spacious providing dining tables and couches that allows to exchange glances with the view of the pool. The pool view itself could have been improved with better lightings like the one get at aqua the park or at the taj.. however even this was pretty a good one.
My friend informed about the special occasion that day  while making reservation and inquired about  cake availability, when he was assured that the bakery is open all day and we can get a cake from there. However we finished the cake cutting ceremony elsewhere and headed towards studio for dinner.

The only problem i found was with the a.c. it was during mid april and i was literally sweating as a section of air conditioner was not operating. The staff however arranged for a standing fan on the second half.
Coming to the food, it was happy hours going on , we got some miller pints from the beer  list with ASIAN STYLE CHICKEN & GLASS NOODLE SPRING ROLLS WITH STUDIO DRESSING, which were crispy and tasty ones.
Then we ordered for PHAD THAI and a lamb side dish.. the flat noodles toasted with vegetables chicken and roasted peanuts tasted awesome. But the lamb was rubbery and chewy.. on complaining the chef was apologetic and replaced it with some SICHUAN CHICKEN .
Lastly they surprised me with a cake and birthday tune which was a nice touch. What behold us from appreciating their effort was that cake was taste wise not upto the mark and did not seem to be freshly baked at all..  Later on seeing the bill , we found that an extra charge of Rs 750 was added under name of some prawn dish which we didn't have. The waiter whispered that it was the cake that was chargeable! How idiotic! I have dined at taj, itc and hyatt on special occasions where a complimentary cake is given , even if we dont ask for! And here i had to pay for something not worth.. not even asked for!!

Studio has a great ambience overlooking the pool. The service is good and the staff cordial and helpful.
Now for the cuisine 
I recommend theTom/Kha coconut floured Limey chicken soup.
WaterChestnut delights ..  Dim sum 
Bit over rated .. Perhaps not as expected. 
Barmee Kar ( Thai fine Hakka style noodles done with prawns and plenty of vegetables .. Delightfully done.
 Chef's compliments sugar free Rosogollas  .. We were lucky .. Otherwise available with notice.
No one would know such a well appointed hotel exists from the outside.   
Request to management wifi should be free for diners.

I had dinner here recently with my family. I really liked the decor and ambience. Service was top notch. The welcome drink shots were wonderful. I loved the Tom Kha soup and pork belly with mushrooms. The pork was so tender that I asked the waiter where they source it from. He checked with the chef and informed me that they get it from New Zealand.

Thai green curry, sticky rice, noodles and wasabi ice-cream were also good. The only thing that I personally found below par were the dim sums. They were too bland for my liking. 

The bill for 3 of us (without alcohol) came to Rs 4200.

Food was good. Ambience is fresh and new. Music seemed loud. Portion sizes needs attention. The welcome drink shot might not be a fun element for all. Looking through the glass wall on to the swimming pool is a great way to spend time. Overall good. XO rice was nice. The menu is pretty elaborate too.

It was my birthday dinner and studio being long in the hype list , i was pretty excited to treat my best mate on the special eve. The restaurant on the first floor is very spacious providing dining tables and couches that allows to exchange glances with the view of the pool. The pool view itself could have been improved with better lightings like the one get at aqua the park or at the taj.. however even this was pretty a good one.
My friend informed about the special occasion that day  while making reservation and inquired about  cake availability, when he was assured that the bakery is open all day and we can get a cake from there. However we finished the cake cutting ceremony elsewhere and headed towards studio for dinner.

The only problem i found was with the a.c. it was during mid april and i was literally sweating as a section of air conditioner was not operating. The staff however arranged for a standing fan on the second half.
Coming to the food, it was happy hours going on , we got some miller pints from the beer  list with ASIAN STYLE CHICKEN & GLASS NOODLE SPRING ROLLS WITH STUDIO DRESSING, which were crispy and tasty ones.

A perfect blend of authentic continental cuisine and soothing ambience 
We went there for lunch and were delightfully satisfied
Their welcome drink just sets the right mood 
The staff was extremely courteous, well informed and helped us greatly in selecting the dishes from the menu card
The chef himself visited us post lunch to take our reviews on the food
Though it is on the expensive side but the food is surreal and worth every penny spent
A classic fine dining experience in all.

Every one is aware being 5 star hotel how the ambiance it could be. The ambiance is really nice and cool before we entered into the Studio.
The welcome drinks was nice the cocktail, the bartender's special was aweasome. 
Coming the food in the main course, we went for Chinese. The fish item was not at all good, it was having some raw smell. The chicken item was full of sauce so it was not tasty at all. The same have been informed to chef and he is very obedient and took feedback positively. He immediately provide us some special pron items and that was aweasome and at last the dessert, its kind of a drink with coconut flavour and that was too good, which actually made us to forget the massacre done with the fish item. 
4 rating only for the last 2 preparations.

Few colleagues decided to hit to new oriental specialty cuisine and enjoy couple of drinks on Friday evening. Located next to pool side of Novotel, the quite a posh pub with live band. They have happy hours 1:1 option on selected drinks. One can also opt to relish their fixed set menu apart from regular ala carte menu.
On entering the Studio we were guided to a corner table with view of pool and fountain. Thai shot welcome drink with cold towel were waiting for us. The shot of welcome drink and chilled towel refreshed us. 

In 1:1 cocktail we had Thai Shots and Amigo. Thai shot is vodka based punched with cranberry juice, chili syrup and lemongrass. It has refreshment of lemongrass with heat of chili. Amigo is gin based mixed with pineapple topped with fried star anise. Both were interesting combination not tried before and of course had its kick.
 Bartender here is an expert mixologist.

In main course we ordered Pan-seared Bekti and Tori Teriyaki accompanied by Xo Rice and Spicy Garlic Chicken Noodles. It was disappointing when server came and updated us after few minutes that the 5 star establishment is not having Xo sauce in their kitchen. So the order was changed to chicken and shrimp fried rice.

Pan-seared Bekti is the fish dish with lemon garlic sauce with sauteed bokchoy. The fish dish was the another disappointment of the evening,unmarinated just steamed fish topped with so called lemon garlic sauce. The sauce neither had fragrance of lemon nor taste of garlic, in other words was complete tasteless with raw smell of fish. A bong can never be wrong about fish. Tori Teriyaki is grilled boneless chicken in teriyaki sauce however this was overdose of soy sauce and overkill of various sautee vegetables.Chicken and shrimp fried rice was a pretty ordinary preparation and has no specialty of a 5 star establishment. Spicy Garlic Chicken Noodles again another popular dish and complete disaster by the chef at the kitchen. Again no presence of garlic in the preparation.

While asked for bill the restaurant manager Mr. Arup Panda seek our feedback and was taken aback by our disappointment. He immediately called for Sous Chef Benjamin understood the feedback in detail and offered us compensation by presenting his specialty water chestnut and prawn dimsum. Chef offered us Tab tim Samsee dessert which is delicious chilled coconut cream topped with water chestnuts. This however bought little smile back on our face from a complete disastrous dinner.

The band performing was a complete waste and don't know how to bring life in the room. Air conditioning was not working and they had to put stand-by air cooler by the side of the table. Can you imagine this in a 5 star property?! Lastly while collecting the car at valet parking it was extreme frustration to me to find the parking guys has parked the car with windows rolled down. This property has long way to go to justify the number of stars next to its name. Only good thing the price in menu is cheaper compared to other 5 stars establishment but at the same time quality is cheaper too.

This year, Citibank Restaurant Week started from April 22nd and we decided to commence our gastronomic voyage from the restaurant nearest to our work. Studio is the Pan-Asian restaurant of the Novotel Hotel, Kolkata.

The first thing you would notice is the two storey tall racks having large glass jars filled with colorful cookies! Though the entrance of the restaurant was not so impressive but the décor of the place had minimalistic elegance with the sophistication of a five star and the jazziness of the youth.

We were greeted by Arlene at the entrance. She offered us a table with the best view! We ordered 5 starters, 4 main courses, 2 staples and 3 desserts from the three-course “prix fixe” menu.

Starters

“Kai Phad Khing” – Ginger and Kaffir lime flavored Thai spicy chicken. The dish was quite good. Two portions were more than enough for four of us.
“Nonya” – Crusted fish with dark soy sauce. This was one of the best dishes of the day. The outer crust was perfectly crisped keeping the fish soft and juicy inside.
“Prawn Tempura” – Large size prawns cooked to perfection with freshly grated ginger and tempura sauce.
“Lamb Satay” – Regular satay with a piece of grilled pineapple and a fresh peanut crème. The lamb pieces were a little chewy; still I could not help but had four of it.
“Gnocchi” – The best among the best! We were surprised to see the translucent cubes of potato starch fried with chili garlic sauce. We met Benjamin, the Senior Sous Chef of the restaurant. He explained us how they made the dish. We were amazed by his innovative ways of cooking and his vision to transform the restaurant.

Main Course and Staples

We ordered “Hot Basil” Bird’s eyes chilies chicken fried rice and “Spicy Garlic” chicken noodles with “Cashew Prawns”, Pan seared Kolkata Bhetki (with lemon garlic sauce), “Tori Teriyaki” (grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce) and “Slivers of Lamb” (lamb glazed by Oyster sauce).
All the dished were cooked to the ultimate delectable perfection. The vegetables were fresh, the meats were succulent and the sauces were ravishing. Just add a dash of soy sauce in the fried rice or a rub of the spicy chili sauce in the noodles and you will reach the savory heaven of your journey.

Desserts

Imagine an innings with the last over having three match winning sixers! Probably that’s the best way I can explain the last course.
We ordered “Dark Chocolate mint Mousse”, “Galangal Poached Pears” and “Coconut cream with Samee water chestnuts”.
The last dish (“Coconut cream with Samee water chestnuts”) was unimaginably palatable! We never thought that the concoction of coconut cream and Kaffir lime sitting in a chilled bath of ice would take us to the Paradiso! Hell, we were ready to die and go to heaven for this!

Sanjay served us throughout the dining. He was so attentive that we never had to ask him to fill up the water goblets or to replace the plates. His sedulous attitude and professional service made our whole dining experience delightful.

The total bill for four of us were around Rs.4,500. This was the special fractional rate for the Restaurant Week. However, I took a quick look in their menu card the normal prices looked quite reasonable considering the five star property, the food taste and the portion sizes.

Studio is undoubtedly one of the best Pan-Asian restaurants in Kolkata at this moment. I would recommend it without any dither. I will return to Studio soon to meet Arlene and Sanjay again. Hungry, and for another unforgettable experience.

This restaurant is very close yo my heart, so i took a lot of time to write this review. I was invited to this restaurant on a Saturday, for my first zomato metup. And OHHH what an experience it was !! Well to begin with Novotel is very easy to find, right beside Axis Mall. And once you enter its a world of it's own. The ambiance of Novotel is itself very warm and welcoming. Once i was guided into Studio i was spellbound by the decor and beauty of the place. It overlooked a pool and the view was amazing. The interiors were beautifully done. they call themselves the studio rather than a restaurant is because they are an assembly of different things- food, fashion, shows, etc. I loved this concept. The moment i walked in, i was greeted by the Anumita and Aparna from the Novotel team and Samridhi from Zomato. And almost immediately the waiter served me a bright yellow colored tropical welcome drink with pineapple flavour. It was thoroughly refreshing. Then the bartender made us taste a few of his own concoction : 19th of march(especially made for this meet up, since it was the same date. It was made of gin with lemon grass) and summer breeze(this was made of vodka with aisan flavours). There were a few delicious looking mocktails(cucumber crush and rain forest) that my friends were served. Then we were introduced to chef Neelabh Sahay and his team. He is a very pleasant man and he was kind enough to explain each and every dish to us in details. His dedication towards food and taste is completely engrossed me. And while we still relishing our cocktails a sumptuous meal was served.
Now for the mouth watering food.

Mini's :
1. Yasai Kakiage six flavoured vegetable tempura : six flavoured vegetable tempura. Delicious and fresh.
2. Crispy tofu, numbing 'sichuan peppercorn' sauce : the tofu was very fresh and blended well with the sauce.
3. Asian style chicken and glass noodle spring roll : best spring rolls i have had in a long time. The coating was just right. The chicken was soft and delicious. A must try if u visit this place. Lovely presentation.
4. Prawn 'tempura', freshly grated ginger & radish with tempura sauce : this tasted simply exquisite. The combination of fresh prawn tempura and the tempura sauce was superb. The prawn was fresh and well marinaded.
A must try if u visit this place.

Dimsum:
Water chestnut delight (veg) and Prawn manti(non veg) :
Both the dimsums were extremely palatable. The coating was just right. The fillings were juicy and enriched with asian flavours.

Sushi :
Futomaki, cucumber, carrot, pickel radish roll (veg) and 'Dragon ball' tempura prawn, crunchy tempura crumble(non veg):
I had never liked sushi much, but these were simply mouth watering. It was so good, i re-ordered another platter of it. Especially the prawn sushi with the wasabi tasted simply out of this world.

Soup: roasted chili and lemon grass, tom yum 'caviar', cherry tomatoes, lemon juice :
This had a completely different presentation. While it was extremely delicious, i loved the way they made the soup. All the ingredients were in caviar form, like tiny granules, and when the hot water was poured into the bowl the soap got created. Loved the concept.

Main's :
1. 'Cashew prawns', cashew nut, tri color pepper and ma la sauce: another prawn preparation that was totally delicious and definitely a must try. Its asian flavours will engulf you. The cashew nut and bell peppers totally complemented the prawn. A must try if you ever visit this place.
2. Fermented 'beans chicken', water chestnut, Chinese mushrooms: its delectable flavours will keep you wanting more. The mushroom was fresh. The flavours blended very well.
3. Thai 'green curry' sauteed with sweet basil, lemon grass and bird's eye chilies: i love thai. And i have had it at many a places in kolkata. Hands down, this is one of the best in the city. The delicate flavours of basil and lemon grass totally captivated my taste buds.
4. 'Yasai itame' , mix vegetables, butter garlic sauce : a very delicious mix of veggies. Even though I'm a strong meat lover, i found it to be great. The veggies completely blended with the sauce.
5. 'Spicy garlic' noodles, sesame oil, fresh garlic: I'm very fond of garlic. This preparation was so subtle and yet so distinct that it completely enraptured me.

Sweeter ones : ( All of these are a MUST TRY)
1. Spearmint and dark chocolate mousse: while chocolate mousses are common at all restaurants this stood out because of its rich dark chocolate flavour. One of the best mousses i have had in town.
2. Salted caramel kafir lime tart : while most of us expect our desserts to sweet, this was salty. Primary ingredient was salted caramel. This was just plain heavenly. The presentation was delightful.
3. Tab tim samsee: this was the most delicious thing on the menu. This was cold liquid dessert made with primarily coconut milk and lemon grass. It was served in a beautiful bowl upon a bigger bowl of ice. I loved the presentation.

Thank you my buddies from Zomato for an amazing experience, Samridhi from Zomato Management for inviting me, Anumita and Aparna from Novotel PR for their food suggestion and friendly behaviour and chef Neelabh for his enthralling creations. -with

Probably among the last few reviews trickling in from the fantastic experience that was the Zomato meetup a couple of weeks ago. 

The highlight of the meal was the finger food. Artfully presented, the veg tempura, spicy tofu and dimsums (water chestnut and tofu) were all very very good. I also loved the flavorsome tomato soup with a hint of lemongrass. First time with sushi (pickled carrot and radish is all I remember) and I have to say they single handedly made the meal a hit. Truly a burst of Asian flavors and they looked exquisite. The way I discovered Thai red curry and got obsessed, the same is likely to happen with sushi. Calcutta is well and truly opening the doors of Asian food to me :) 

The main course faded in comparison; with nothing memorable, it was a melee of rice, noodles and gravy. For dessert, I chose the sea salt caramel tart. Don't see why the slice had to be that big! Two spoons and it was overwhelming. A word about the mocktails! I had a watermelon and grape combo (match made in heaven) which was delectable. I finished mine way too quickly :) 

In terms of experience, I understand the restaurant is putting its best forward and showcasing itself. Probably being politically incorrect, but I felt they came on too strong. Otherwise, it was well-organized, with details taken care of and exemplary service. Happy to see that they curated our menu from their regular menu, so no false promises there. Also happy to see an improved rating from say a month ago.  

Once again, thank you Zomato :)

Thanks to Zomato I enjoyed a lovely foodie meet at Studio-The Pan Asian Gallery at Novotel some days back. It was my fourth or fifth visit to Studio and as always, I was stumped by the excellent food. The concept of Studio is very interesting. It is not just a restaurant but more of a club. They have events regularly and every day there is something special going on. If you are a fan of music, you should definitely visit on Fridays because that is when they get individual performers or bands to perform live at Studio. I've been to a couple of Studio Live Fridays and it is a great experience.

Coming to the food, the restaurant is manned by Chef Neelabh who comes up with some amazing creations which are not your run of the mill oriental cuisine. For the Zomato meet, we were presented with an extensive menu that featured a special cocktail made for us called 19th of March. Other dishes included a crispy tofu, prawn tempura, chicken and glass noodle spring rolls, water chestnut and prawn dimsums, tom yum caviar soup and a sushi platter. Hard to choose a favorite out of these because all of them were so good but I would particularly recommend the prawn tempura and the spring roll. 

For the mains, we were served hot basil fried rice, spicy garlic noodles, cashew prawns, fermented beans chicken and thai green curry with steamed rice. I usually steer clear from vegetarian food while out dining but this thai green curry is an absolute winner. I also loved the basil fried rice with the cashew prawns. 

For dessert, I tried the spearmint and dark chocolate mousse. Not really oriental but again, Studio is known for its inovative take on traditional dishes. If you love chocolate, this dish is for you. Pure indulgence!

I've always been a fan of Studio's food and would definitely recommend a visit. Thank you Zomato and Novotel for inviting me.

To start with, I would like to thank Zomato for inviting me to The Studio, Novotel at the foodie meet-up which happened to be my third Zomato meetup! I had been to Novotel couple of times before and it happens to be very close to my place! There is very little to say about Novotel which has its headquarters in France with around 400 hotels and resorts across the globe! My words are not enough to describe the high standards of quality and magnificence of this place which has started its operations couple of years ago in Kolkata.   

Location - - - - - This sprawling property is present in Newtown (action area-1) just beside the Axis Mall. Locating it is not an issue and you obviously need not worry about the car parking either since you get valet parking here. 

Ambiance - - - - - The grandiose interiors leaves you mesmerized whenever you are inside this property and of course the ambiance of Studio (which is said to be an Asian culinary gallery with five Asian cuisines, rather than just another restaurant), is also very classy and urbane. The huge glass walls overlooking the pool, the wooden-step walls and ceilings, the classic furniture and pretty cutlery sets uplifts your mood whenever you walk into this place. And of course, for the Zomato meet-up the place was all decked up and ready to greet all the guests for the event. Also in general, the seating arrangement is very spaced out and the overall ambiance is pretty relaxed and warm. 

Food - - - - - There were loads on the menu frankly speaking :) and I strived hard to taste most of them, here are the items I had tasted –

1) Studio Mist – This was the welcome drink, one of the most refreshing welcome drinks I have had, it had an unusual mix of Asian flavors and ingredients and had cinnamon, pineapple juice, kaafir lime, hint of basil, etc.

2) Summer Rain – It was an orange flavored cocktail served in a martini glass loaded with some huge kick, that’s all I can say :) One of the tastiest cocktails I’ve had in a long time!

3) Rainforest – It was a watermelon based mocktail with pieces and bits of watermelon in it, very refreshing and presented quite beautifully.

4) Coco Cucumber – Intensely flavorful refreshing drink for the summers with fresh cucumber bits in it, surely try this out if you are here during the summers!

5) Crispy Tofu – Well, it was nice and fresh but served in small quantity. We were told that most of their dishes have small quantities so that you can taste many dishes at one shot or rather in one single visit. I found that to be one nice thought but some may not appreciate it since that will make your bill amount go up!

6) Yasai Kakiage – It was fried six flavored vegetable tempura, nice and mild; add some red chilli paste and have it!

7) Chicken and Glass Noodle Spring Rolls – Oh man I loved these! It was an Asian style spring roll loaded with chicken and glass noodles with a typical sauce that they call the ‘studio dressing’.

8) Prawn Tempura – Again a must have at this place, golden fried crisp prawns in freshly grated ginger and inimitable tempura sauce!

9) Water Chestnut delight Dimsum – The dimsums were the winner for sure and this water chestnut delight dimsum was flavorful and green in color with a pomegranate bit topping.

10) Prawn manti Dimsum – One of the star items I had at this place, it has got a yellowish tinge to it and an out-of-the-world taste, maybe I could have had 10-12 pieces of this at one shot :) It had a fresh piece of prawn sitting inside the dimsum with one amazing overall flavor! Also it was presented very well. Must try if you are here!

11) Tom Yum Cavier soup – It was a lovely soothing tom yum soup with cherry tomatoes, lemon juice, roasted chilies, lemon grass and garnished with coriander leaves.

12) Dragon Roll Sushi – Though I am not a fan of Sushi but I am glad that I had tried the dragon roll sushi here at Studio, it was very soothing with a piece of prawn in it, served with wasabi, soya sauce, tempura prawn and crunchy tempura crumbles.

13) Cashew Prawns – Very fresh preparation of shrimps which were handsome in size and drenched in ma la sauce, cashew nuts and tri color pepper!

14) Thai green curry with steamed rice – One of my favorite Thai dishes which I try and cook at my home as well! Anyway, here the flavor was fresh and beautiful and very aromatic as it should be. The tastes of sweet basil, fresh coriander, dash of bird’s eye chilies, kaafir lime, lemon grass was irresistible and you can surely have some good amount of steamed rice with this. Loved this!

15) Fermented beans chicken – This one nice and spicy dry preparation of chicken to go with the fried rice or noodles with water chestnut and Chinese mushrooms! 

16) Hot Basil Fried rice – It was again one amazing preparation with spicy bird’s eye chilies and basil leaves. Loved the intense flavors it offered.

17) Spicy Garlic Noodles – Again this was a nicely prepared dish with sesame oil in fresh garlic that gave the aroma and spicy kick which I always prefer.   

There were many more items on the set menu along with the desserts (like tarts and mousses) which I could not end up having since I had to rush for another appointment :)

SERVICE - - - - - The service was really amazing out here, I had been to Novotel before and I know this great service is not because of the Zomato meet-up; service is always top-notch here at Novotel, very courteous, helpful, warm and friendly. Would like to specially thank Neelabh, the master chef behind this amazing lunch! 

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quality: 4.1/5
Food presentation: 4.2/5
Food quantity: 3.3/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5

Overall rating comes to 4 out of 5. The great ambiance, service, food and beverages combined together  gives you every reason to visit this newly opened Studio at Novotel! This was a complementary meal from Zomato and I would like to thank Kaustav, Samridhi, Diptak and everyone at Kolkata Zomato team for arranging this wonderful event at this amazing venue! For every foodie and lover of Asian cuisine this place has got all the ingredients to satisfy your soul and is the perfect spot to make great memories. 

Cheers!
                                          ...

“Gnocchi” – The best among the best! We were surprised to see the translucent cubes of potato starch fried with chili garlic sauce. We met Benjamin, the Senior Sous Chef of the restaurant. He explained us how they made the dish. We were amazed by his innovative ways of cooking and his vision to transform the restaurant.

Main Course and Staples

We ordered “Hot Basil” Bird’s eyes chilies chicken fried rice and “Spicy Garlic” chicken noodles with “Cashew Prawns”, Pan seared Kolkata Bhetki (with lemon garlic sauce), “Tori Teriyaki” (grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce) and “Slivers of Lamb” (lamb glazed by Oyster sauce).
All the dished were cooked to the ultimate delectable perfection. The vegetables were fresh, the meats were succulent and the sauces were ravishing. Just add a dash of soy sauce in the fried rice or a rub of the spicy chili sauce in the noodles and you will reach the savory heaven of your journey.

Desserts

Imagine an innings with the last over having three match winning sixers! Probably that’s the best way I can explain the last course.
We ordered “Dark Chocolate mint Mousse”, “Galangal Poached Pears” and “Coconut cream with Samee water chestnuts”.
The last dish (“Coconut cream with Samee water chestnuts”) was unimaginably palatable! We never thought that the concoction of coconut cream and Kaffir lime sitting in a chilled bath of ice would take us to the Paradiso! Hell, we were ready to die and go to heaven for this!

Sanjay served us throughout the dining. He was so attentive that we never had to ask him to fill up the water goblets or to replace the plates. His sedulous attitude and professional service made our whole dining experience delightful.

The total bill for four of us were around Rs.4,500. This was the special fractional rate for the Restaurant Week. However, I took a quick look in their menu card the normal prices looked quite reasonable considering the five star property, the food taste and the portion sizes.

Studio is undoubtedly one of the best Pan-Asian restaurants in Kolkata at this moment. I would recommend it without any dither. I will return to Studio soon to meet Arlene and Sanjay again. Hungry, and for another unforgettable experience.

This restaurant is very close yo my heart, so i took a lot of time to write this review. I was invited to this restaurant on a Saturday, for my first zomato metup. And OHHH what an experience it was !! Well to begin with Novotel is very easy to find, right beside Axis Mall. And once you enter its a world of it's own. The ambiance of Novotel is itself very warm and welcoming. Once i was guided into Studio i was spellbound by the decor and beauty of the place. It overlooked a pool and the view was amazing. The interiors were beautifully done. they call themselves the studio rather than a restaurant is because they are an assembly of different things- food, fashion, shows, etc. I loved this concept. The moment i walked in, i was greeted by the Anumita and Aparna from the Novotel team and Samridhi from Zomato. And almost immediately the waiter served me a bright yellow colored tropical welcome drink with pineapple flavour. It was thoroughly refreshing. Then the bartender made us taste a few of his own concoction : 19th of march(especially made for this meet up, since it was the same date. It was made of gin with lemon grass) and summer breeze(this was made of vodka with aisan flavours). There were a few delicious looking mocktails(cucumber crush and rain forest) that my friends were served. Then we were introduced to chef Neelabh Sahay and his team. He is a very pleasant man and he was kind enough to explain each and every dish to us in details. His dedication towards food and taste is completely engrossed me. And while we still relishing our cocktails a sumptuous meal was served.
Now for the mouth watering food.

Mini's :
1. Yasai Kakiage six flavoured vegetable tempura : six flavoured vegetable tempura. Delicious and fresh.
2. Crispy tofu, numbing 'sichuan peppercorn' sauce : the tofu was very fresh and blended well with the sauce.
3. Asian style chicken and glass noodle spring roll : best spring rolls i have had in a long time. The coating was just right. The chicken was soft and delicious. A must try if u visit this place. Lovely presentation.
4. Prawn 'tempura', freshly grated ginger & radish with tempura sauce : this tasted simply exquisite. The combination of fresh prawn tempura and the tempura sauce was superb. The prawn was fresh and well marinaded.
A must try if u visit this place.

Dimsum:
Water chestnut delight (veg) and Prawn manti(non veg) :
Both the dimsums were extremely palatable. The coating was just right. The fillings were juicy and enriched with asian flavours.

Sushi :
Futomaki, cucumber, carrot, pickel radish roll (veg) and 'Dragon ball' tempura prawn, crunchy tempura crumble(non veg):
I had never liked sushi much, but these were simply mouth watering. It was so good, i re-ordered another platter of it. Especially the prawn sushi with the wasabi tasted simply out of this world.

Soup: roasted chili and lemon grass, tom yum 'caviar', cherry tomatoes, lemon juice :
This had a completely different presentation. While it was extremely delicious, i loved the way they made the soup. All the ingredients were in caviar form, like tiny granules, and when the hot water was poured into the bowl the soap got created. Loved the concept.

Main's :
1. 'Cashew prawns', cashew nut, tri color pepper and ma la sauce: another prawn preparation that was totally delicious and definitely a must try. Its asian flavours will engulf you. The cashew nut and bell peppers totally complemented the prawn. A must try if you ever visit this place.
2. Fermented 'beans chicken', water chestnut, Chinese mushrooms: its delectable flavours will keep you wanting more. The mushroom was fresh. The flavours blended very well.
3. Thai 'green curry' sauteed with sweet basil, lemon grass and bird's eye chilies: i love thai. And i have had it at many a places in kolkata. Hands down, this is one of the best in the city. The delicate flavours of basil and lemon grass totally captivated my taste buds.
4. 'Yasai itame' , mix vegetables, butter garlic sauce : a very delicious mix of veggies. Even though I'm a strong meat lover, i found it to be great. The veggies completely blended with the sauce.
5. 'Spicy garlic' noodles, sesame oil, fresh garlic: I'm very fond of garlic. This preparation was so subtle and yet so distinct that it completely enraptured me.

Sweeter ones : ( All of these are a MUST TRY)
1. Spearmint and dark chocolate mousse: while chocolate mousses are common at all restaurants this stood out because of its rich dark chocolate flavour. One of the best mousses i have had in town.
2. Salted caramel kafir lime tart : while most of us expect our desserts to sweet, this was salty. Primary ingredient was salted caramel. This was just plain heavenly. The presentation was delightful.
3. Tab tim samsee: this was the most delicious thing on the menu. This was cold liquid dessert made with primarily coconut milk and lemon grass. It was served in a beautiful bowl upon a bigger bowl of ice. I loved the presentation.

Thank you my buddies from Zomato for an amazing experience, Samridhi from Zomato Management for inviting me, Anumita and Aparna from Novotel PR for their food suggestion and friendly behaviour and chef Neelabh for his enthralling creations. -with

Probably among the last few reviews trickling in from the fantastic experience that was the Zomato meetup a couple of weeks ago. 

The highlight of the meal was the finger food. Artfully presented, the veg tempura, spicy tofu and dimsums (water chestnut and tofu) were all very very good. I also loved the flavorsome tomato soup with a hint of lemongrass. First time with sushi (pickled carrot and radish is all I remember) and I have to say they single handedly made the meal a hit. Truly a burst of Asian flavors and they looked exquisite. The way I discovered Thai red curry and got obsessed, the same is likely to happen with sushi. Calcutta is well and truly opening the doors of Asian food to me :) 

The main course faded in comparison; with nothing memorable, it was a melee of rice, noodles and gravy. For dessert, I chose the sea salt caramel tart. Don't see why the slice had to be that big! Two spoons and it was overwhelming. A word about the mocktails! I had a watermelon and grape combo (match made in heaven) which was delectable. I finished mine way too quickly :) 

In terms of experience, I understand the restaurant is putting its best forward and showcasing itself. Probably being politically incorrect, but I felt they came on too strong. Otherwise, it was well-organized, with details taken care of and exemplary service. Happy to see that they curated our menu from their regular menu, so no false promises there. Also happy to see an improved rating from say a month ago.  

Once again, thank you Zomato :)

Thanks to Zomato I enjoyed a lovely foodie meet at Studio-The Pan Asian Gallery at Novotel some days back. It was my fourth or fifth visit to Studio and as always, I was stumped by the excellent food. The concept of Studio is very interesting. It is not just a restaurant but more of a club. They have events regularly and every day there is something special going on. If you are a fan of music, you should definitely visit on Fridays because that is when they get individual performers or bands to perform live at Studio. I've been to a couple of Studio Live Fridays and it is a great experience.

Coming to the food, the restaurant is manned by Chef Neelabh who comes up with some amazing creations which are not your run of the mill oriental cuisine. For the Zomato meet, we were presented with an extensive menu that featured a special cocktail made for us called 19th of March. Other dishes included a crispy tofu, prawn tempura, chicken and glass noodle spring rolls, water chestnut and prawn dimsums, tom yum caviar soup and a sushi platter. Hard to choose a favorite out of these because all of them were so good but I would particularly recommend the prawn tempura and the spring roll. 

For the mains, we were served hot basil fried rice, spicy garlic noodles, cashew prawns, fermented beans chicken and thai green curry with steamed rice. I usually steer clear from vegetarian food while out dining but this thai green curry is an absolute winner. I also loved the basil fried rice with the cashew prawns. 

For dessert, I tried the spearmint and dark chocolate mousse. Not really oriental but again, Studio is known for its inovative take on traditional dishes. If you love chocolate, this dish is for you. Pure indulgence!

I've always been a fan of Studio's food and would definitely recommend a visit. Thank you Zomato and Novotel for inviting me.

To start with, I would like to thank Zomato for inviting me to The Studio, Novotel at the foodie meet-up which happened to be my third Zomato meetup! I had been to Novotel couple of times before and it happens to be very close to my place! There is very little to say about Novotel which has its headquarters in France with around 400 hotels and resorts across the globe! My words are not enough to describe the high standards of quality and magnificence of this place which has started its operations couple of years ago in Kolkata.   

Location - - - - - This sprawling property is present in Newtown (action area-1) just beside the Axis Mall. Locating it is not an issue and you obviously need not worry about the car parking either since you get valet parking here. 

Ambiance - - - - - The grandiose interiors leaves you mesmerized whenever you are inside this property and of course the ambiance of Studio (which is said to be an Asian culinary gallery with five Asian cuisines, rather than just another restaurant), is also very classy and urbane. The huge glass walls overlooking the pool, the wooden-step walls and ceilings, the classic furniture and pretty cutlery sets uplifts your mood whenever you walk into this place. And of course, for the Zomato meet-up the place was all decked up and ready to greet all the guests for the event. Also in general, the seating arrangement is very spaced out and the overall ambiance is pretty relaxed and warm. 

Food - - - - - There were loads on the menu frankly speaking :) and I strived hard to taste most of them, here are the items I had tasted –

1) Studio Mist – This was the welcome drink, one of the most refreshing welcome drinks I have had, it had an unusual mix of Asian flavors and ingredients and had cinnamon, pineapple juice, kaafir lime, hint of basil, etc.

2) Summer Rain – It was an orange flavored cocktail served in a martini glass loaded with some huge kick, that’s all I can say :) One of the tastiest cocktails I’ve had in a long time!

3) Rainforest – It was a watermelon based mocktail with pieces and bits of watermelon in it, very refreshing and presented quite beautifully.

4) Coco Cucumber – Intensely flavorful refreshing drink for the summers with fresh cucumber bits in it, surely try this out if you are here during the summers!

5) Crispy Tofu – Well, it was nice and fresh but served in small quantity. We were told that most of their dishes have small quantities so that you can taste many dishes at one shot or rather in one single visit. I found that to be one nice thought but some may not appreciate it since that will make your bill amount go up!

6) Yasai Kakiage – It was fried six flavored vegetable tempura, nice and mild; add some red chilli paste and have it!

7) Chicken and Glass Noodle Spring Rolls – Oh man I loved these! It was an Asian style spring roll loaded with chicken and glass noodles with a typical sauce that they call the ‘studio dressing’.

8) Prawn Tempura – Again a must have at this place, golden fried crisp prawns in freshly grated ginger and inimitable tempura sauce!

9) Water Chestnut delight Dimsum – The dimsums were the winner for sure and this water chestnut delight dimsum was flavorful and green in color with a pomegranate bit topping.

10) Prawn manti Dimsum – One of the star items I had at this place, it has got a yellowish tinge to it and an out-of-the-world taste, maybe I could have had 10-12 pieces of this at one shot :) It had a fresh piece of prawn sitting inside the dimsum with one amazing overall flavor! Also it was presented very well. Must try if you are here!

11) Tom Yum Cavier soup – It was a lovely soothing tom yum soup with cherry tomatoes, lemon juice, roasted chilies, lemon grass and garnished with coriander leaves.

12) Dragon Roll Sushi – Though I am not a fan of Sushi but I am glad that I had tried the dragon roll sushi here at Studio, it was very soothing with a piece of prawn in it, served with wasabi, soya sauce, tempura prawn and crunchy tempura crumbles.

13) Cashew Prawns – Very fresh preparation of shrimps which were handsome in size and drenched in ma la sauce, cashew nuts and tri color pepper!

14) Thai green curry with steamed rice – One of my favorite Thai dishes which I try and cook at my home as well! Anyway, here the flavor was fresh and beautiful and very aromatic as it should be. The tastes of sweet basil, fresh coriander, dash of bird’s eye chilies, kaafir lime, lemon grass was irresistible and you can surely have some good amount of steamed rice with this. Loved this!

15) Fermented beans chicken – This one nice and spicy dry preparation of chicken to go with the fried rice or noodles with water chestnut and Chinese mushrooms! 

16) Hot Basil Fried rice – It was again one amazing preparation with spicy bird’s eye chilies and basil leaves. Loved the intense flavors it offered.

17) Spicy Garlic Noodles – Again this was a nicely prepared dish with sesame oil in fresh garlic that gave the aroma and spicy kick which I always prefer.   

There were many more items on the set menu along with the desserts (like tarts and mousses) which I could not end up having since I had to rush for another appointment :)

SERVICE - - - - - The service was really amazing out here, I had been to Novotel before and I know this great service is not because of the Zomato meet-up; service is always top-notch here at Novotel, very courteous, helpful, warm and friendly. Would like to specially thank Neelabh, the master chef behind this amazing lunch! 

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quality: 4.1/5
Food presentation: 4.2/5
Food quantity: 3.3/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5

Overall rating comes to 4 out of 5. The great ambiance, service, food and beverages combined together  gives you every reason to visit this newly opened Studio at Novotel! This was a complementary meal from Zomato and I would like to thank Kaustav, Samridhi, Diptak and everyone at Kolkata Zomato team for arranging this wonderful event at this amazing venue! For every foodie and lover of Asian cuisine this place has got all the ingredients to satisfy your soul and is the perfect spot to make great memories. 

Cheers!
                                          ...

To begin with the review of Studio - The Pan-Asian Gallery is indeed a great pleasure for me and this will always reamin a special place too.

Thanks a lot Zomato for giving me this oppertunity.

Location:

Studio is a pan asian restaurant in the Novotel(A reknowned hotel group by Accor) which is located at Rajarhat,New town near Axis Mall.

Ambience: (4.5/5)
As soon as you enter Novotel you need to walk through the lobby and reception area and then you reach Studio passing through the poolside.
You have a poolside view inside the dining area which gives a perfect classy touch to the ambience.
The people here call it Studio as they believe in unique food experience for the customers through the art of cooking which is not only mouthwatering and tasty but also displays their passion of sharing visual impact which is a big USP for them.

Decor: (4/5)
After you enter the place you find a very nicely decorated bar counter on your right side and also a big dining area very neatly decorated.
They have the classy wooden finished decor comfortable seats with pleasant music in background gives you a royal feel.
They have a huge collection of rare single malts in the city compare to other places,So if you are a single malt lover definately a place to be.

Writing a review for Studio - The Pan-Asian Gallery will always remain to be very special to me.
I was invited at the Zomato meetup over here last Saturday and this place is rather special as it was my first meetup, one of a kind itself.
Located at The Novotel, near Axis Mall in Rajarhat New Town, Studio caters Pan Asian delicacies. But they differ from calling themselves a 'restaurant' and prefer being called a 'gallery', where foods are created with a touch of uniqueness. 
Located by the pool side, it offers a picturesque view brightening up your mood for a brunch or dinner. Entering, we were greeted with a wonderful welcome drink, created by their specialist bartender, 'Studio Mist'. The flavour was great infused with kaafir lime, pineapple juice and cinnamon. 
Next came the starters, a wide range to choose from. Crispy Tofu, numbed with Sichuan Peppercorn sauce, Asian style Chicken and Glass Noodles Spring Roll and Prawn Tempura. Each of them were excellent. Next came the sushi - the veg and the prawns sushi. Generally, I don't like it very much, but yeah, this one was too good. Next came the dimsums - Waterchestnut Delight and Prawn Manti. The Prawn Manti had a flavour of mustard, I don't known if I am right or not. But yes, all the starters were delectable, super yummy and worth eating! The soup they served was a very unique way. First they filled the bowl with cherry tomatoes, roast chilli and lemon juice, then poured in the Tom Yam Caviar. Generally, I do not like Tom Yam that much, but this one was very unique infused with a very different flavour of caviar. 
For the main course, they served Fermented Beans Chicken with Waterchestnut and Chinese Mushroom and Hot Basil Bird's Eye Chilli's Fried Rice. The rice was spicy and as I like flavoured staples, this went in my favour. The chicken was a bit spicy but good. And cashew prawns tossed in tri colour pepper and ma la sauce. The quality of prawns was very good, they were medium sized ones, soft  and tasted great. And also some spicy garlic noodles. I didn't like it much because it seemed to bland. 
Oh yes, apart from all these, they also served Steamed Rice with Traditional Thai Green Veg Curry. I didn't opt for it as I was too full.
Every good meal deserves some great dessert. Here at Studio, it wasn't different either. There was Dark Chocolate Spearmint Mousse, Salted Caramel Kaffir Lime Tart and Tab Tim Samsee. I chose to have Tab Tim Samsee, which is basically waterchestnut soaked in coconut milk and the waterchestnuts were flavoured with kiwi and rose syrup. This was light and great, but the proportion of crushed ice was more than the waterchestnuts. The mousse and the tart was also good. The praline served over the mousse was like the cherry on the cake. 
The overall experience at Studio was unique. This was not only eating at another place, rather it was a milestone in my gastronomic journey, sharing experiences with many other fellow foodies, who talked food and food and everything was perfect!
This place is somewhere where I am surely going to come back again and again. Happy Dining! :)

A hidden gem located inside the novotel in Rajarhat. I was here for my first zomato meetup. The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the hotel. A quiet walk through the cafe and bakery and the pool side view gallery lead me to Studio- the pan Asian gallery. They called it a food studio and not a restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful and has a contemporary feel to it.
We were greeted by the zomato and the Novotel team with much warmth!

-For the welcome drink we had a pineapple spiced mocktail @with star anise, cinnamon and a hint of Thai basil. Was quite refreshing.
- The tofu tossed in Sichuan sauce was an absolute delight in the mouth
- The vegetable tempura was amazing, crsipy fried, and served in cute steel fryers
- The veg tofu stuffed with vegetables (rice wrapped and weed wrapped) were both delicious. They were served with house house, wasabi and a side
- Veg fried wanton stuffed with water chestnut with a sweet apricot chutney was something I really enjoyed! And it was beauty on a plate.
- I also tried their special cocktail prepared for us specially named 19th of march ( the day of the meet) which was essentially vodka with orange, a dash of lime and an orange peel dunked in for a rustic- feel drink. Was served in a martini glass and was very very tasty

I had to leave soon so unfortunately was unable to try the main course and desserts, which from the pictures of my fellow foodies looked like a million bucks.

What really remarkable about the Studio is that it is a contemporary approach to Asian cuisine (they serve 5 types of Asian cuisine) with an experienced chef and a sprawling bar!_

Overall a very very good experience!
Definitely coming back here very soon.!

A big thank you to team zomato for the wonderful opportunity and team Novotel for the wonderful hospitality and a delicious complimentary lunch!

The decor that reflects the vibe of an artistic creation, the ambience that leave you mesmerized, the hospitality that makes you feel special, and the art of cuisine that let your taste buds lose in the world of heavenly delights......That's how "Studio-The pan-Asian Gallery" can be summarized in nutshell, which is located inside "Novotel".
Yes, its a place that leaves in your heart an impression, that lasts forever and is sure to bring you back to revisit this place again and again.
So far the quality of service and hospitality is concerned, the service persons deserve a standing ovation for the way they receive and attend the guests, not only with warm and cordial greetings, but also with a very generous and friendly charm, which makes you feel honored. "Novotel" should should be proud to have such a great team, of which

Writing a review for Studio - The Pan-Asian Gallery will always remain to be very special to me.
I was invited at the Zomato meetup over here last Saturday and this place is rather special as it was my first meetup, one of a kind itself.
Located at The Novotel, near Axis Mall in Rajarhat New Town, Studio caters Pan Asian delicacies. But they differ from calling themselves a 'restaurant' and prefer being called a 'gallery', where foods are created with a touch of uniqueness. 
Located by the pool side, it offers a picturesque view brightening up your mood for a brunch or dinner. Entering, we were greeted with a wonderful welcome drink, created by their specialist bartender, 'Studio Mist'. The flavour was great infused with kaafir lime, pineapple juice and cinnamon. 
Next came the starters, a wide range to choose from. Crispy Tofu, numbed with Sichuan Peppercorn sauce, Asian style Chicken and Glass Noodles Spring Roll and Prawn Tempura. Each of them were excellent. Next came the sushi - the veg and the prawns sushi. Generally, I don't like it very much, but yeah, this one was too good. Next came the dimsums - Waterchestnut Delight and Prawn Manti. The Prawn Manti had a flavour of mustard, I don't known if I am right or not. But yes, all the starters were delectable, super yummy and worth eating! The soup they served was a very unique way. First they filled the bowl with cherry tomatoes, roast chilli and lemon juice, then poured in the Tom Yam Caviar. Generally, I do not like Tom Yam that much, but this one was very unique infused with a very different flavour of caviar. 
For the main course, they served Fermented Beans Chicken with Waterchestnut and Chinese Mushroom and Hot Basil Bird's Eye Chilli's Fried Rice. The rice was spicy and as I like flavoured staples, this went in my favour. The chicken was a bit spicy but good. And cashew prawns tossed in tri colour pepper and ma la sauce. The quality of prawns was very good, they were medium sized ones, soft  and tasted great. And also some spicy garlic noodles. I didn't like it much because it seemed to bland. 
Oh yes, apart from all these, they also served Steamed Rice with Traditional Thai Green Veg Curry. I didn't opt for it as I was too full.
Every good meal deserves some great dessert. Here at Studio, it wasn't different either. There was Dark Chocolate Spearmint Mousse, Salted Caramel Kaffir Lime Tart and Tab Tim Samsee. I chose to have Tab Tim Samsee, which is basically waterchestnut soaked in coconut milk and the waterchestnuts were flavoured with kiwi and rose syrup. This was light and great, but the proportion of crushed ice was more than the waterchestnuts. The mousse and the tart was also good. The praline served over the mousse was like the cherry on the cake. 
The overall experience at Studio was unique. This was not only eating at another place, rather it was a milestone in my gastronomic journey, sharing experiences with many other fellow foodies, who talked food and food and everything was perfect!
This place is somewhere where I am surely going to come back again and again. Happy Dining! :)

I start off with a thank you note to the management of Novotel and Zomato for having organized this Zomato Meet-up @ the Studio - the latest feather in the cap of the Novotel Group of Hotels. I also sincerely thank Jai Kishan (GM @ Novotel), Surajit (F&B Director), Aparna & Anumita (Marketing team), Samridhi (Zomato Executive) and finally, Neelabh (Master Chef) and his entire team whose skills and efforts were instrumental in making this Meet-up successful!

To begin the review, Novotel needs no introduction - 1 of the best 5 stars in the city. Have visited it's bakery (Delice) and today, got the opportunity to enjoy a complimentary meal @ Studio - the Pan Asian Gallery - their latest initiative. It's quite remarkable when the GM and F&B Director themselves come and personally meet and greet you - a gesture very rare! Otherwise also, their service is of exceptional quality.

Was offered a rose petal hand-wipe and welcome drink (Studio Myst) on arrival. For mocktails, I had Rainforest (Watermelon/ Black grape base) and Coco Cucumber (cucumber base) - both outstanding. The latter has literally changed my perception about cucumber based mocktails - which I earlier disliked! For starters, Crispy tofu with Sichuan sauce was available - which was to die for. However, I did not like the sauce very much. Tempura was served which was also very nice. Then came the Dimsums – simply the best I have ever had in my life - Mmmmmmmmm...... should have eaten scores of it! The most balanced vegetable content ever with the tastiest sauces and mind-blowing presentation! This was followed by Sushi - can't comment too much on it since I don't quite like Sushi and have almost nil idea about it.

Thereafter, we had Tom Yum soup and it was perhaps the only item on their menu, which I did not like - tooooooooo sour - although service etiquette for the same was unprecedented. Instead of blatantly serving the soup, they served the bowls 1st, followed by some raw vegetables into the bowls, which was lastly followed by serving soup. Coming to the mains, basil fried rice was out of the world - one of the best I had in the recent past. It was perfectly under-cooked to an extent to keep the rice crispy. Noodles - again were mind-blowing. Broccoli gravy was there which was good but not great. Steam rice with saute vegetables were available which were also nice!

Finally, the path to heaven - the desserts - the choco mousse (with cherry) was to die for. Further, their lime tart was brilliant - but I believe that the salt content diminished it's taste.

I don't exactly recall the last time I spent 3 hours at a dining table, eating heavenly food and spending quality time with friends. So, I express my gratitude to Novotel & Zomato for having provided me this experience and also a platform to meet and become friends with new people.

Overall, an almost perfect experience and a must visit place for people who are looking for varied cuisines under a single roof. For foodies looking forward for a heavenly dining experience, the pool side view, the LCD TV, private dining facilities, cool ambience, superb service and exceptional food might just do it for you!

We went there for our first zomato meet in Kolkata. This studio (they called that instead of a restaurant) is situated at Novotel Hotel beside Axis Mall.
According to me ambiance was spacious and very neat and clean. The poolside view were good and gives you fresh filling.
Zomato meetup had some special menu from prepared by Sous Chef Milav Sahay and Team Novotel, which includes belows foods and drinks:

1. Studio Myst: It was a welcome drink for us by the team Novotel, flavour was pineapple with a twist of cinnamon. Very nice indeed.

2. I opted for another drink called Rain forest, its a simple drink made of Watermelon Juice with crushed ice. Not very unique atleast compared by its name.

3. Crispy Tofu in "Sichuan Pepercorn sauce": Tofu tossed in Sichuan peppercorn sauce and taste like heaven.

4. Prawn Tempura: Freshly fried prawn served with Tempura sauce makes my day. Served three pcs but after eating two pcs a lady server came to me and took my last prawn and remove the dish before I can complete. That was so heartbreaking.

5. In the ocean: a coacktail which I wanted to taste it but after approaching two times they forgot to served that.

6. Asian Chicken spring roll in Studio Dressing : it was the best chicken spring roll i had til date.

7. They served two dinsum which are prawn manti and water chestnut delight. Good in taste specially the water chestnut delight.

8. I skipped the sushi because I dont like it.

9. The roast chilli Tom Yum soup was too sour, I tried couple of times but left the dish for another one.

10. Fermented Beans chicken was good in taste.

11. Hot Basil,chilies fried rice was good also,served with chicken.

12. Dragon Roll tempura was very good and well cooked.

13. "Yasai itame": was a thai curry cooked in butter sauce and mixed veg served with mixed veg rice with a flavour of lemon grass.

14. Spicy garlic noodles was very average and I didn't liked a lot.

And here comes the desert, they were offering 3 desert and as a foodie I wanted to to try 3 of them so first I took spearmint and dark chocolate mousse which was just amazing and I assure it was the best choco mousse in town, pure choclate and no cream was used in it, after that I tried tab tim samsee which was a thai desert made in coconut milk and that desert was taste like heaven and last i treid salted caramel lime tart, which was good but not great as its predecessor.

This place isn't a restaurant, it's a STUDIO. That's what they call it, that's what I would prefer calling it. With large glass windows giving you beautiful views of the pool and the hotel, a well decorated private dining, a common dining and an extremely packed bar with whole lot of single malts and so many other choices available.

The bar is not only well stocked but also handled by a very talented bartender. We were served with a welcome drink specially made for us which was simply amazing.

The starters kept coming in which were were as follows:
# Crispy Tofu numbing "Sichuan peppercorn"- very crispy with veggie filling.
# Asian style chicken and glass noodles spring roll - surely the best spring rolls I ever had. Very well made chicken wrapped in the leaves and fried well. 
# Prawn Tempura - Another amazing dish that needs to be mentioned.
# Prawn "manti" dimsum - Fried prawns served in a small steel basket. 
# Sushi : (Veg) Futomaki with cucumber and carrot; (Non veg) Dragon roll stuffed with prawns - Really well made served with Wasabi and soya sauce. Truly amazingly made. 

Then came in the soup. I loved the way they served it. The empty bowl came in with spices and herbs. Then they poured the liquid on it making the soup in front of you. Amazing flavors, spicy and surely tasty. 

Finally the main course came in. 
# Cashew prawns served with a Thai style fried rice. The aroma in the rice and the slightly sweet prawns came in so amazing together. 
# Fermented beans chicken served with noodles. This was a little spicy combination but again amazingly prepared. 
# Thai green curry served with plain white rice. Beautiful but very light combination which surely arouses your taste buds. 

Lastly the best part of the meal. Comes the desert.
# A chocolate moose with spearmint and caramel nuts. A heavenly desert which takes you to a different universe. So smooth yet so amazing.

A big thank you to Team Zomato and Novotel for this amazing lunch.

P.S. Yes, it was a complimentary lunch and everything that I wrote above actually happened.

Located exactly opposite to the Axis Mall, Rajarhat, Novotel offers you a luxurious feeling right from the entrance. In most of the 5star properties the staffs are taught to be nice to their guests, but for the Novotel guys, they were not only nice but extremely genuine - from the lobby receptionist to the restaurant staffs.

The Studio has a perfectly arranged decor with lighting textures. Located just beside the pool, it gives you a good view and makes you feel "up". Adding to this was the warmth of the restaurant guys who made it sure that we enjoyed our time and felt comfortable in the restaurant.

Coming to the food part of it, it GENUINELY was amazing. 
If you are planning to start off with a bowl of soup (and if you are on the non-spicy side), do try the Kaffir Lime and coconut broth, galangal foam soup. 

They dont make it /2 as the quantity in one portion is perfect for one individual.
We tried some prawn tempura as well. It was yum too.

In the main course, we tried Slivers of Lamb, glazed by oyster sauce and Tenderloin Rendang beef with some Hot Basil Bird's eye chilies fried rice. 

The beer was absolutely fresh and crisp.

I am not going much into the cost as we all have a fair idea.
But whatever the cost was, it was absolutely worth it!

At the end, both of us were handed 2 20% discount vouchers for our next visit.

The Studio- was, absolutely one of my best fine dining experiences.
Definitely recommended.

Novotel Kolkata Hotel & Residences, has recently come up with yet another interesting offering - Its Pan Asian Gallery - Stud!o. Yes, that's how they choose to describe it ! Because it offers much more than just food. The newest Pan Asian Restaurant in town offers live music, art exhibitions and so much more while serving the best of Pan Asian Cuisine to the guests. The best part is the chic decor of the place. The outlet plays with natural and artificial lights in the most efficient way, with light reflecting through the steel sheets in the ceilings and the prismatic kitchen. The prismatic kitchen offers a sneak peak of all the action in the kitchen. Overlooking the beautiful poolside of the property, the Stud!o is elegant in its own unique way. Stud!o offers a lot more than just the regular dumplings, Thai curries and noodles.You will start seeing the Pan Asian cuisines in a new light once you go through their menu. This time, I sampled the vegetarian offerings of Stud!o. A hardcore non-vegetarian since childhood and a fussy eater than I am, I have always been extremely picky with vegetables. However, Chef  Neelabh assured us that we will love it :P What was on the menu?

The first, Japanese centered asian offering from the novotel family in India. And i must say. Am impressed. The service is rarely found in most kolkata properties.
Food was great too. Dimsum are signature. So the wok stuff...
Highly recommend.

Only negatives.
The shushi could be much better. Recommend using a better soy sauce brand and the mosquitoes can be avoided. 

I would definitely rate it as a  better cousin of the competition ie pan asian/zen in kolkata.

Awesome food and very warm reception and service,  a must visit for pan asian foodies.  You might find it  better than the best that is available in Kolkata. I tried only the veg options in Chinese,  Thai and Japanese.

This place is a must visit in Kolkata if you want to try some really good Asian food along with live performances that too on weekdays (and weekend)... What I love most is their pot meals which are just perfect match for the ambiance and theme of Studio. Last but not the least, I found the food price quite reasonable and presently they are offering 1o1 drinks too!

A great experience unfolded in celebrating our anniversary in the month of December 2015. Have been to various star categories in town, and have seen this a bit unmatched when it comes to the inner ambience and the view you look from the Studio. 

Though the space is not as big as others, but it is calm and cosy which you need to have when you want to stay a bit out of the groove. Have fingered into the Japanese delicacies though more into the Teriyaki preparations. Was pretty excellent in terms of the Chefs choice if you go for. The most unique which i experienced - Mocktail of the house by the Bartender. It just increased my expectation to a wider spectrum.

Studio is  the city ’s first outlet with live kitchens, music, flamboyant cocktails, dramatic food courses and sensational desserts. Studio presents to Kolkata and its trendiest crowds, an unmatched welcome and vibe as they walk into this uniquely designed outlet overlooking the verdant poolside. The dining experience begins with tapas-style mini eats and fusion cocktails served in an informal setting with the accompaniment of a live DJ mixing youthful music or live singer/s belting out jazz/soul chart-toppers. The décor is Japanese minimalistic chic. Studio  seeks to create a niche market among the sushi and sashimi lovers as well as the discerning and well-travelled vegetarian population of the city. Chef Neelabha Sahay, Executive Sous Chef at Novotel Kolkata Hotel & Residences, made a beautiful lunch Pan-Asian Veg Spread for us. It was started with Welcome drink 'Lychee Delight', contained Lychee Juice, Cranberry Juice, Sweet n Sour Mix & American cherry. Followed by Thai Spiced Vegetables & Kaki tempura, six flavored tempura as appetizer. Then Vegetable Baoji & Water Chestnut & Chive dumplings came in Dimsum section. Asian meal is incomplete without Sushi, so 'Cucumber & Pickled Radish Maki' was served. Then Udon noodle broth came in soup section. In main course Thai Green Curry was served with Steamed Jasmine Rice, Yaki Meshi & Chili Garlic Noodles. After the main course Jasmine Tea was served , as an Asian tradition. Last but not the least, it's dessert time. I'm not a dessert lover, but still I can say Tab Tim Samsee (coconut cream based dessert)  was awesome. After the lavish menu, I have no place for dessert, so had 1 spoon. But after having 1 spoon, I had to finish the whole. It was the best item of the whole lunch. Then the 2nd dessert came, Glangal Poached Pears in mascarpone cream, chocolate soil was pretty good. It was a very nice experience there. If you are looking for a romantic dinner date or for a special occasion to celebrate, this is the right place for you.

This is one of the new place opened with pan asian cuisine. The decor of the restaurant is classy and the food is pretty good. We tried chicken dim sum and prawn sushi.
The quantity of dim sum is just 3 and the size is also small. It is not worth the money. Sushi was very good.

Great ambiance, good service but a wee bit overpriced. The Thai Green curry was excellent and is highly recommended. The environment is hip and trendy and they let you choose the music you like to be played!
