Visited the century old shop after a long time. Ordered Rose soda and idli, masala onion dosa, masala dosa and cheese masala dosa.. Rose soda was great, not extraordinary like it used to be. Idli was good to, the sambar was good. The onion masala dosa was extremely good. The down was cheese msala dosa, the amount of cheese was quite less. An average experience..

‚óè Location: Near esplanade metro.
‚óè Description: Went there for having a light lunch. The place has a small dining area. Near the entrance, they have their juice center and after that the cash counter. They do not give individual table for individual group. If they have some vacant places in the table, you have to share it with other customers. 
‚óè Order type: Dine in.
‚óè Menu: They offer veg snacks and different types of beverages and kulfi also.
‚óè Item: 1 dahi kachori, 1 rose lassi and 1 chocolate cold coffee.
‚óè Price: ‚Çπ170.00/- (No gst applied)
‚óè Staff and service: Quick service 
‚óè Ambience and decor: This place needs a makeover because colour on the walls has faded away.
‚óè Food description:
‚óÜRose lassi: The flavour of rose syrup and the flavour of sweetened curd, both were strong in this lassi. It was very tasty also.
‚óÜChocolate cold coffee: The flavour of chocolate was very strong and it was dominating the flavour of coffee. For me it was like a chocolate milk shake. But it was also very tasty.
‚óÜDahi kachori: The kachori was a little hard outside. But with the curd, bhujia and chat masala it was creating a great taste.
‚óè Food recommendation to other foodies: Rose lassi

Went there with Maa today after so many years.. For Maa it's been a decade!! & as per my mother's recommendation we ordered the "Special Kulfi" which is a speciality of Rally's!!
But we were disheartened üòë
The quality has deteriorated tremendously!! But still it is better than others!! As per the recent menu card it costs 70/-.. Nothing to recommend as such! But there are other veg dishes which you can definitely try ‚ò∫

It is one of the oldest joint in Kolkata probably. I used to come here with my Dad a lot when I was a kid. It serves delicious south indian food , chats , lassi and various other shakes and syrups. I had their dosa which was really good with a good amount of masala. The lassi was really good as well but was a little thin. Other syrups and sherbats are also good. A great place to hangout without burning a hole in the pocket. The decor is just basic nothing fancy but very clean. The service was also upto the mark.

This place is really a big treat for snack items during tiring shopping time. They generally serve all kinds of snack starting from North Indian to South Indian. We have ordered Chola Bhatura and a Dosa which was served hot and deserved a thumbs up. And the variety of soda and lassi is also awesome to have after a snack time. Overall this is a must visit place for all the shoppers without any additional pinch to your pocket.‚ò∫

The best place to have some sherbets or drinks at a low cost in Kolkata. The variety in their drinks is vivid, the quantity is good enough for the price and the tastes are so true to their names.

If you are thirsty and want the healthy way out, try the lassis and milk shakes here. A very old outlet in Esplanade. I ate here many times since childhood. Last time I went with my friends, thirsty after shopping (& more window shopping), ordered a strawberry lassi, 2 rose lassi, & a cheese paper plain dhosa. The lassis were great but I think the golpark outlet serves in a bigger glass. The dhosa was also upto the mark. Overall a nice Non-AC place for reasonable priced food.

Ralli's is the iconic name for syrups and sherbats which the people of Kolkata adhere to. They provide you with wide range of beverages and almost all of them are satisfying to the core.

I have had visited this place during the time when Zomato ceased to exist but couldn't visit in the near future as it was off market. It opened few months back, after almost a gap of three years.

After the long wait, I planned to revisit some old memories and hence decided to try Ralli's along with a friend of mine. Upon entering we found buzz of people flocking for orders and searching for seats. None of my nostalgia kicked in as the place looked way different.

The decor and ambiance lacked a great deal owing to the fact that they opened after a decent gap due to supposedly legal issues and they got no time to renovate. However, if they serve such mind blogging beverages and desserts, we don't mind compromising.

After about ten minutes of wait, we found a seat and ordered two kinds of drinks, which they took another ten minutes to prepare. The behaviour of the staff and the owner who sits at the counter is appreciable. They take orders with smile and doesn't show a tinge of frustration even after getting mouthful to listen from few customers.

Ultimately, the beverages we ordered, were served cold which gave us a soothing feeling. Upon completion of our drink, we ordered kulfi which they served with red toppings and damn - it tasted really awesome. After satisfying ourselves we prepared to leave.

It is a recommended visit!

ralli singh - some one said had rallied to hold standards here since ages. 1st tryst with this wonderful relax bar was in the young 80 s and the fizz has been been retained still. The special ralli s syrup and the rose water mix are absolute delights and takes away all exertion spent on the streets of dharmtala.

My first visit to this outlet was with my father in the year 2005. Having attended my WBJEE Counselling nearby, we dropped in here as I was pretty much hungry. Walked in through the Non-AC Section, while leaded to an empty barren place and further to their AC Section. Ordered for a Masala Dosa. Filled with potato mixture, it was heavenly. Had made several visits later to try their Lassi's, Soda's and Syrups. Sadly, the place closed down in between and got relaunched, but only with the Non-AC Section. Had dropped in again to their Masala Dosa and a Syrup. The Dosa had lost its touch and the Syrup kind of missed the zing. Hoping for a quality upliftment in the near future.

Searching for cheap and amazing, go to Ralli's. The syrups here are legendary and famous. I tried the black current and masala soda syrup and both were extremely good. I have had lassi too during my previous visits and it tasted well everytime. The mixed chat, dahi vada, dosas all taste as good as they can be. The place has been renovated and people are really friendly.
Visiting again? Surely. Why not.

Chat, syrups, milk syrups, thandai, floats - all their specialties. You don't need an ambience when you love the food & beverages. A place for quick drink ( non alcoholic) in hot summer. Very affordable. Literally anyone can go for a syrup. An old favorite for many Kolkata residents !

Easily, one of the most popular street food restaurant, serving innumerable veg delicacies. For a person searching to have foods like Raj Kachori Chat, Mix CHat or Dahi Vada, this is the location he must seek, when he is in Esplanade. The price is on the reasonable zone and after finishing with the delicious food , a glass of flavored lassi or Kulfi will sum up a decent yet wholesome meal.

Ralli's @ esplanade is a well known name in the city for its veg fare and variety of syrups. In the scorching heat of Kolkata, ralli's comes to your rescue with its chilled drinks. I personally like their south indian fare and kulfi falooda. Yummy is the word. Pricing is reasonable too. Overall a good place

You are tired after your shopping, walk a little to reach Ralli's...in the summer heat, try their cool drinks. Their kulfi is also good.
Location easy to find, crowd is more or less consistent.

A much celebrated shop, known for its Thandais mainly. Many of the holis have brought us here. Rest of the year, we have hardly visited this place. Also love their rose syrup which is also sold at the retail outlets. Love the place.

Located right in the heart of Esplanade,Ralli's for me is iconic.When it comes to street food there are few better places.And when it comes to syrups and juices,it is second only to none other than Paramount.

This place offers mainly street food and various types of syrups and juices.There is also Dosas and other South Indian items available.The chats here are very good.They are very tasty and served quite hygienically too.The ingredients in the chats are always generous.

But the main attraction of this place is undoubtedly its various syrups and juices.All of them are very very refreshing.Just the type you would want after shopping or any visit in the always overcrowded Esplanade area.I personally love the various types of milk shakes they prepare.The Milk khus,milk badami,milk kesari are to mention a few.The syrups are very good and they are the speciality of Ralli's.They also serve a wonderfully tasty kulfi with generous amounts of falooda and rose syrup.

The prices here are quite reasonable.The service is fast.There are two sections-one non air-conditioned section outside and one air-conditioned inside.The non air conditioned section outside is always very crowded.The ambience is expectedly much better in the air-conditioned section.But the path leading to this section is very dirty.The prices are understandably little higher in this section.

Overall if you are looking for a quick meal in and around Esplanade,look no further than Ralli's.It is sure to satisfy and rejuvenate you!!

P.S. I had found this to be closed on the last few occasions I have visited Esplanade.I just hope they have reopened.It simply deserves to be up and running...:)

Ralli's is an old memory lane for me. Dad and I loved their kulfi with oodles of falooda and the syrup on top.
I still recall that day, when Dad and I went to Ralli's because of  dad's fetish to have kulfi all of a sudden. We landed up ordering two chaat before we surrendered ourselves to the tooth hurting sweetness of the world.

The papdi chaat was nice and tangy. I have always been a fan of papdi chaat and ralli's did not dissapoint us on that either. The chaat was nicely made and we were almost full after we consumed a full plate but the love for kulfi was so huge that we could even eat a full meal and even then eat the kulfi.

So, when the kulfi finally reached our table , with oodles of falooda and the glistening on them the red syrup, we cudnt resist ourselves.
Once we popped a piece into our mouth, we were simply blown apart.
They were delicious. I feel, Ralli's only got better and better.
So yes, there we were - father and daughter getting smitten by a mere kulfi! :D

For a quick bite and the love for Koolfi, this place is a MUST :)

Happy eatiing guys,
Cheers! :)

Talk about Esplanade and a visit to Ralli's is almost always a must for me. I am a die hard fan of their sodas, especially the Rose soda, Kulfi with lots of falooda on top and a lot of syrup , and the Milk Khus, a lovely green drink which always reminds me of my childhood and fascination with everything green. They also make a decent chaat, especially the Dahi Tikia and the Kachori Chaat.

Ralli's is quite a landmark in the growing up years. The crushed ice in the rose soda or the numerous other sherbets.
Rallis has come a long way. As children it was always just rose soda. and then in the school days the experimentation began 

Have always loved their samosa chat. They were close for sometime. Hope they have opened again. 

The Raw mango sharbat too is very refreshing in the sultry kolkata afternoon. 

Hygiene... is a major issue here .. thus i deducted a mark .

Ralli's is a name I'm introduced to from the very beginning of my childhood. People know the name of ralli's especially for it's large variety in syrups. But if you ever go to a stop at ralli's, dont forget to taste the chats. Dahi vada is very delicious, kulfi is just yummy, fuchka is also awesome over here. And of course, you will never leave ralli's without having sips from it's soothing syrups. In this case, what i will prefer to taste is kalakhaatta. This is a unique, spicy, cool invention of ralli's which you cant get anywhere else.

Its one of those places that I have come to love since my childhood. As my mum and I would venture out for our random escapades from the daily grind of life, we would almost always end up in here, if we are visiting New Market. There is something oddly infesting about old Calcutta. My mum made sure, I caught the delirium, well enough. So coming to the quintessential Ralli's, it is a typical vegetarian eatery with the most unpleasant entrance to begin with. If you are super hygienic, you may get freaked out. The place is small, and hardly accommodates around a couple of dozens atmost! Yet, the food is to die for. From chaats, to chole bhaturays, to tikki chanas, to dosas and vadas; each and every dish would make you go for more and more and more. Its is cheap, pocket friendly, and merrily affordable! Food around well out here, and dont forget to end it with the kulfi-falooda!

this ain't no high figh joint. just plain old calcutta place. rallies is famous for it's snacks and juice section. the juice and syrups provided here are of standard quality though i must say a bit pricy considering the restaurant and food and siiting arrangements and everything. the snacks are also ok. not very good nor uneatable. maybe thay've got some kinda problems or something cause the last time i checked the shop was closed with people or maybe the stuffs selling juice and syrups out side the shuttered doors.

Ralli Singh's fast food joint has become an icon in the food culture of Kolkata. The fruit syrups..especially the pineapple syrup and khus is awesome. Among chaats, the paapdi chaat is delicious and you will end up asking help from ur friends to finish it off!! Among the sweets, the kulfi is the best choice!
