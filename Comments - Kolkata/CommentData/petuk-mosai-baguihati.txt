Amazing food, at extremely reasonable prices. Have been a regular customer, right since their inception, and have been satisfied each and every time.

I ordered Fish fry and Chicken biriyani at today evening. Both items tasted was upto the mark. The raita offered with Chicken biriyani was too good. Only the main drawback was biriyani little bit oily otherwise thumbs upüñí.

A decent Chinese eatery option in Baguiati. Reasonably tasting food. It's a take away joint, or call-in for order. Had tried the staple:
1. Fried Rice (non-veg, mixed) - 3‚≠êÔ∏è
2. Chili Chicken (gravy) - 3‚≠êÔ∏è

An overall 3‚≠êÔ∏è for this place.

Ordered Chicken Reshmi kabab and Chicken tandoori yesterday. Who knew they will serve such stiff , tasteless kababs. It seems they have sent 2 days back left overs. Horrible experience.Never expected.

Even being a small outlet they have not compromised with hygiene. Taste is pretty good.
Have all the facilities of payment.
 
Must try Biryani and chicken tendoori and chicken bharta.
