Very casual dining restro beside sodepur station..went there last night for dinner...no body came out to attend us..we had to search the menu card..could not understand who is the waiter,as everybody wear casual clothes,and all were busy in their phones or adda....ordered lacha Paratha,mixed Chow,chilly chicken... chicken was very low in quantity,as other nearby restaurants serve double quantity on that price.. noodles tastes like a road side food...Paratha was average...

This small hub of variety of dishes is situated just opposite to the platform number 1 , of Sodpur station. They also have a sitting arrangement which is cozy and comfortable. 

They just make some good set of rolls. Their biriyani is average. Staffs are not so cordial as you should expect.

Pocket friendly restaurant and the biriyani is quite good and health friendly at a cheap rate. The mixed fried rice is one of the best item you can have here.

Here rolls are the only thing that someone should order for take away. The rest are just untouchable. The staffs are also too much lazy to work. Atleast they should find some workers who can clean the tables properly.

The best part when i visited this place was the excellent quality food along with the quick service and low prices. I am a regular here and love their Bengali fish thali, Chicken kassa, Mutton Biryani and Chaap. I would recommend you to Try the Balti Chicken and Chicken Chaap for non veg and Veg pulao and mouth watering Paneer Butter Maaala for veg.

situated  just opposite of sodepur platform no 1... worst experience ever... we have ordered crispy chicken at first.. but it was not avilable .  then we have to ordered two plates of chicken pokora as if we were 4. one plate contains 4 pcs of pokora... its awful...  just yaak. full of cornflour...  chicken was less in these... and the price is too high.. one plate's price is 90 rupees! I don't  know how... our local  'televaja shop' serves better chicken pokora...

Just like another road-side hotel, rolls are pretty delicious, a good place to have some snacks on the run. Nothing extra-ordinary. Food to eat: Egg-chicken roll, it's tasty.

Located just opposite to the sodepur station. They serve Indian and Chinese dishes. They also have a roll and fast food counter. They've a thali system between 12:00-04:00pm
It's not a posh restaurant but it serves it purpose.

Delicious rolls, specially the chicken rolls @ 35 is a must-have takeaway deal.Â 
Located just outside the station premises, you'll notice the place while coming out of the 1no. platform of Sodepur Railway Station.Â In addition to the takeaway roll counter, they have a casual dine-in space (not very spacious) with minimal decor. Pocket friendly, I would say, but not extraordinary in taste. I like their Chicken tikka masala and Chicken Bharta most.Â Never tried, but as per my knowledge, they serve Bengali cuisine thalis for lunch as well.
