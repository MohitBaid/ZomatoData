New Delhi Hotel is close to Shovabazar Metro. I have been to this place long ago with my father. The place is decent with good seating arrangement. Food is cheap. Mostly casual dining available. We had our lunch here and I remember everyone was very satisfied with the quality.

Try their tarka with roti.. you will not be disapointed.. I have tried reshmi butter masala once but it was not good.. the price is also very cheap..
