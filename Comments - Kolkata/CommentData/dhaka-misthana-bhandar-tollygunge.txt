Located near Ashok Nagar Park, Tollygunj. Variety of sweets but lack of that bengoli sweetness that you found in the streets ok Kolkata. Tried their Gulab jamuns and Milk Cake. Cake was good but thumbs down for Gulab Jamun.

Firstly, the point which needs to be highlighted is they have two outlets in the same area (one in Ranikuthi ,the other one,the main branch being in Malancha) ;
Second of all, Zomato authorised shop is the one in Malancha ,beside the cinema hall and fast food joint Subal's ;
Thirdly, hence the reviews have gone down drastically !
Now coming to the main course, the quality of sweets, their wide range of delicacies, etc are matched with a snacks bar selling evening snacks like singara(s), kochuri(s),dhokla(s),etc ! Then have a high chair for visitors too;
Frankly speaking, the price of sweets needs to be checked(highly overpriced); But the motichur burfi(s) and rasmalai(s) were mouth watering !
Service was altogether good,hygienic, ambience(NA), food quality moderate ; Anyways continue the good work !!!

I have been a customer of Dhaka Mistanna Bhandar since past 20 years but sadly the quality is deteriorating day by day. What they still good at is the Rasogolla. They have introduced many fancy looking desserts but I would suggest them to stick to what they were good at. The Kachori is not considerable at all, however the Radhaballavi is better you it is available.

I've not really tasted much of their sweets. 
I've only turned their rossogolla and some chaapa Misti. It had s nice flavour of camphor and bits of coconut. 
Average taste of the rossogolla.

Not anything great, cheap quality sweets available here. The sweets don't look fresh, and they don't taste fresh either. I don't know what else I should say, very poor quality of sweets.

Not too much of top quality varieties. 
Sweets are average. 
I don't find my favourite bengali sweets here. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

Good value for money sweets. They have 2-3 shops around this area. The stuff arrives pretty fresh and is fast moving. They sell Poori and Kachori in morning which is signature Bengali breakfast ( well not so up on health) breakfast. Samosa at evening- have grown on them. The shop has passed its owner batton through to 3rd generation now. Absolutely cant say the sweets and snacks here bad. Good value for money.
