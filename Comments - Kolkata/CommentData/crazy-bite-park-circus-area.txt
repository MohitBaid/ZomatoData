Just a roadside snack place .The fish pakoras were a bit less cooked and the other items were so.Only the Fish batter fry was worthy of a second time try.
As the area lacks a quality snacks parlour this is a popular place among the college goers and frequent snack bar!

I happened to visit this outlet more than 3 years back when it first made its mark in the Ladies' Park Area.

It is an extremely small outlet with varieties of fish items available. There are other non veg items too which I do not remember now.

I have had tried fish finger and pakoras which did not impress me a lot. Also, since those days it was a new outlet, people used to flock from all round to have a bite of it and in this process the staffs used to get frustrated. But, that is never an option to not be courteous to your customers.

Overall an okayish one.

You must not expect a great consistency in a food-centre like this. This a very small road-side shop with no proper sitting arrangement. 
But I wish to recommend the following items...
1. Matar-suti r kachuri
2. Fish fry
3. Chicken Drum Stick
4. Fish Batter fry
5. Fish Finger...

It is really difficult to get such a good quality food in extremely low price in Park Circus area.
Two people can have some good snacks in Rs. 150/-...

I often visit this fast food joint for their Fish Batter Fries. This particular item is only available in this place, as far as I know, around my area.
The coating sometimes gets a little thick but otherwise it is really good.
Other stuffs like their Chicken Lollipop, Fish Cutlet and their Momos are also recommended.
