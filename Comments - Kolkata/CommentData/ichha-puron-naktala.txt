A famous take away counter in Naktala.  A pocket friendly and tasty food center for quick bites or afternoon snacks like momo,  chow,  rolls,  moghlai etc. A must try if you don't want a hole in your pocket eating in big restros.

It is a small takeaway counter. Serves good roll, dry chili chicken and momo. It takes a little time for them to serve as it is a small counter with loads of crowd
 But still a hoof place to eat when you want to munch on something good and you don't want to burn a hole in your pocket.

Finally this place has been listed on zomato. A small takeaway counter which serves tasty & pocket friendly food. Their rolls as well as chinese items are worth trying. One should try their dry versions of chicken side dishes specially chilli chicken,hot garlic & crunchy chicken. They use pure chicken pieces instead of battered ones. So do try out their food. You wont be disappointed.
