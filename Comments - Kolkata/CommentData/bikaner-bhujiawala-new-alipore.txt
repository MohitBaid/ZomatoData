Located at the Taratala crossing, this os one of the oldest sweet shop in the area. Frequent visitor to this shop to get the gift packs - sweets and dry fruits for my relatives. Lassi and the kaju barji are my favorites.

Bikaner Bhujiwala is an age old shop, known for its history and quality of food.

This particular joint is located at Taratala Crossing. With its huge, red name plate it is hard not to notice it.

Bikaner Bhujiwala sells all sorts of manufactured items like shonpapri or bhujia. Besides these, they have a veg menu which has a decent taste.

This place is moderately crowded most of the time because of its small floor spacing. But on the brighter side, the staff here has quick pair of hands. Service is fast, and they definitely leave customers satisfied and full.

I visited this place a lot of times most recently last week. Their taste is deteriorating day by day. Most recent tried their Dani vada, not good as if I was trying something tasteless dipped inside curd. Lassi was good but not great. I will recommend everyone to visit tewari brothers in Taratala for this kind of food. Can't comment on their sweets haven't tried them evr.

Sweets are quite average here...my mother used to get raw paneer from here and it used to be of the best quality and the most tasty one but unfortunately with time the quality has detoriated drastically.... my all time favourite here is the paneer cutlet which is a must try here

It is a typical bhujiawala shop with snacks and tiffin for a quick bite grabber in the busy Taratala Junction. My hunger pangs aggravated and tortured me as I entered the outlet and was lifted off the ground by smells of someone digging into Chola bature here and someone else indulging in a samosa/shingara the other end. Standing and eating has never been my cuppa tea so I did not like the standing arrangements! Oh the samosas I did order. Portion sizes of everything was bigger than our regular Gupta brothers and all. Bigger samosas and bigger Dhoklas charmed me from inside the counter. Was also impressed by the dosas here. Hot and crispy. Above average among this area eateries I'd say however not as great as Tiwari Brothers. Definitely easy on the wallet for a stomach full! Service is quick for that location. Go for it and grab a packet of bhujia also for munching during a ride!

I m surprised to see this place has so less reveiws. Its quite old shop. I was introduced to this shop by my father. I am a great fan of their paneer cutlet and dahi badas. and so m i. they give spicy chutneys with the paneer. Paneer items are generally very good here. Panner cutlet is soft , juicy  and succulent.with small pieces of capsicum! And perfect dahi bada chat!. their masalas n chutneys are the best!                                                                                                                                               They have some unique sweets which looks as well as tastes very good. A bit costly. Don't hesitate to visit atleast once. Their bhujias and chanachurs are also good.

Its located right on taratala crossing and is very prominent.It is a completely vegetarian take-away and sweet shop.The veggie snacks here are great , my favourites are The Stuffed Capsicum/Chilli pakora, Paneer pakora the Aloo paratha is also excellent which they serve with potato or channa curry.They have a variety of sweets of which the best is chocolate mithai and pineapple mithai.

   I always buy mixtures which in bengali we call chanachur from here TANA BANA the mixed that is the khattta meeta and Sab Kuch which has everything mixed.Overall a nice joint infact better than some branches of Haldiram.The prices are also quite reasonable.
