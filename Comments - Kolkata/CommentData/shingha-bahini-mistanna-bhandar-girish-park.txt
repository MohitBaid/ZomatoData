Situated in girish park crossing. Very old sweet shop. Serve delicious sweets at very decent price. I prefer their rossogulla and chum chum. The sweets were fresh and healthy.

Located right beside sharma sweets outlet, is this sweet shop. They are a very old shop and serve decent sandesh. The pricing is very reasonable. The stuff sold is always fresh and shop is neat, clean. I like their ice cream sandesh, plain sandesh. They have these murabba that sell like crazy but i am not so fond of them. However they lack variety in the soft chenna sandesh which i dislike about them.Â 

Overall a decent sweet shop but i would suggest one to walk down a bit to surendra nath dey and sons, who offer a greater and better variety !!!
