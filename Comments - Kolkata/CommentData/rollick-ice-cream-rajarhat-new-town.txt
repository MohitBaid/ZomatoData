The special and attractive offers are the main attraction. Variety of cones, sticks, cups are available. Combos and all are missing but dual scoop will be readily available.

Just another outlet inside Rajarhat CC2 but I never tried this flavor combination- a scoop of coffee and a scoop of first love. It was too delicious. The moment those two scoops started melting and the flavors mix, you have a flavor that makes you wanna have more.

Desserts and Ice Creams have always been the best part of the meal for me. It's a small outlet with very little place to even stand properly but there are a large number of flavours of ice cream at this outlet. The "Nolen Gurr" ice cream has always been my favourite and it is the only branch where my favourite one is always available. Ice cream lovers out there can give it a try. :)

Highly overpriced.
I ordered two fizzy cola floats and it tasted soo boring. They had put a scoop of vanilla and added cola in it.... Simple... I didn't like it at all.

It saddens me to share my experience today that is
( 5/02/2017 ) between 5 to 7 pm at the Hangout food court section of City Center 2 of an extended Rollick ice cream counter .
What i had thought it to be and what it turned out to be was some serious moment of concern for me. Let me elaborate exactly what happened with me. At first i had passed that counter and saw many banners hanging and screaming DOUBLE SCOOP FOR RS .60 ,which was completely an attractive offer they displayed rightly. Now to my excitement i went to the counter and little did i know that such weird people were appointed by such an old and great brand ROLLICK for the service to customers. Ok so as i mentioned i saw that offer and told the guy at the counter to give me the 60 rupees double scoop offer that you have displayed and to my surpise this guy takes out two cups and starts filling both the cups and i interrupt him saying i asked you to give me a single cup of a double scoop you have displayed as an offer .He disinterestly looks at me and says can't you be clear and says in vernacular AAP KYA KHULKE NAE BOLSKTEHO AAPKO KYA CHAHEA ? I immediately in a polite tone told him BHAIYA AAPKO MAINE AAPKA DISPLAY BANNER DIKHAKE BOLA MUJHE YEH CHAHEA 1 CUP OF DOUBLE SCOOP FOR 60 . He then started correcting me that you should say that why are not saying clearly about it and i was taken back with his confusion or his arrogance that he was trying to humiliate a customer just because i corrected him that you are not understanding that i need just a cup of double scoop . He was very loud and very unmannered as a person of service to be honest i felt he was not fit to handle the counter as he does not understand that he is not sitting over there for himself but for a customer. However i kept my calm till the moment i lost it and told a single line that ARE YOU IN THIS COUNTER NEW OR SOMETHING CAUSE WE HAVE BEEN EATING QUITE REGULAR AND AS FAR AS I SEE YOU ARE GETTING SO ARROGANT CLEARLY MAYBE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT BRIEFED ABOUT YOUR JOB PROPERLY BY THE COMPANY. And he told me in return that I AM NO ONE TO TELL HIM THAT. I literally laughted inside yet showed an annoyed look at that moment cause i was feeling so bad for his lack of sense that he is talking as being part of service sector to a customer that our comments and feedback isn't valuable . I asked him how will you think you will get money if you don't treat customers well, just sitting and looking at the Ice creams ? .

Neways that was a very bad experience and at the same time it was stupid also but then as a Food Blogger and most importantly as a normal customer if you see too which i actually did not reveal to him at all the service was very unprofessional and nasty indeed.
.I threw my slip , did not bother to click pictures and the ice cream serve was of such bad quality it seemed he was taking revenge and gave me the most terrible scoop i had ever seen in my life so finally could just forcefully eat it even though did not like it but then after that i opted for Mama mia in the ground floor for a better and decent experience.

Note for the management : If my incident is treated serious you will surely not lose many customers and yes as a proof you may check the CC2 hangout section CCTV between 5-7 pm on 5/02/2017 the person out at the counter that time is the one who needs some serious help of understanding things and being more behaved , we are not your friends we are your customers we pay , eat and look forward to be happy not listen to your rubbish gyan.My name is Jude Martin and i was wearing a black t shirt and a black jeans just incase you show concern as i gave 1rating for the colourful setup nothing else inspite of a terrible evening.

Rollick used to be a popular name once but now they have decreased much. They haven't upgraded themselves much serving mostly the ordinary flavors, but no doubt their quality is really good. I took a ice cream from this store in CC2. It was very good in taste. Pocket pinch is hard.

Rollick Ice cream is an old icecream brand, this kiosk is located at CC2, Rajarhat, New town .

Ambience us ok with no sitting arrangenents.

Service is quick with well mannered  staffs.

Tried their Tutti fruity sundae, chocolate overloaded and cotton candy. Cotton candy was decent but the icecreams were above average, nothing to praise.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

They have very ordinary flavour stuff in which strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, are common with ordinary taste. Rollick ice cream gives right to sale its ice creams to ordinary pedlars also, from which you can determine its level of standard and quality. In this kind of selling process, don’t expect it to be a big restaurant type establishment. It’s a very small ice cream parlour where you will find very few visitors in entire day. There will not be more than two persons to serve your stuff. Approach of the staff is very casual in his filthy dress.

Rollick is one of my favourite brand of ice cream and based on my expectations from rollick , I grabbed a hot chocolate sundae from this parlour once during a visit to city centre 2,kolkata. And it was nothing but disappointment. That was one of the worst ice cream I have ever had.

A nice discovery – this small Rollick kiosk @ the ground floor of City Center 2 mall. I went to CC 2 with my friend for some addabaazi and noticed this outlet as well as the displayed advertisement – double scoops for Rs. 50/- (Any flavour excluding specials). I immediately went for the kill – bought 2 scoops (in cup) for myself and 2 scoops (in waffle cone) for my friend. The waffle cone cost us a few bucks extra – which is ok as this is the standard industry practise for ice creams! I went for their cotton candy as well as mint choco chips, whereas my friend had chocolate orange and black currant. Prices seemed reasonable, till the time we realised that size of the scoops served was pretty small.

Coming to taste, cotton candy was outstanding, but my joy was reduced by the mint choco chips – which had no choco chips at all – a complete contradiction to its name. Moreover, it had more of flavours and hardly any taste, so, it was cotton candy, which ultimately made my day. Nice to see that around a dozen flavours as well as shakes etc were available.

Service is fine and no seating arrangements are possible as only a limited space is available.

Rollick hardly needs an introduction, the brand has been their since a long time. Their scoops are reasonably priced and as usual ice creams are very nice.

I was really happy when they had the other outlet in City Centre 1 , Salt lake but  its long gone , i guess this is the only rollick outlet left in Kolkata , during the 90's Rollick was loved and cherished by all but now it has lost its sheen and popularity.
Went for Chocolate Overload and Icecream Sandwich , delicious and yummy indeed.

Unlike other brands Rollick being an old one they have finally came up with their kiosk as well.

**Location**
Located just outside the city center 2 Rajarhat behind the inox box office.

**Products**
The products need to be improved and it is very usual in taste. Nothing extra ordinary.
I tried the black forest sundae from here which was just about okay and the normal scoop of the ice creams tasted very ordinary nothing special to mention.
For me it is just about an Okay.

My sister and I had the Mango Crunch from this counter. The ice cream was flavoursome, all laced with the sweet taste and scent of a pulpy, juicy mango in a creamy soft scoop that can never be stopped licking incessantly. This kiosk of Rollick's sells some rollicking good ice creams and sundaes.

The dessert scene in Kolkata is really hitting a mark but since our chikdhood days sugar rush after lunches came in the form of icecream,Rollick being the foremost brand in the department.City centre 2 houses an astounding number of dessert/icecream/gelato places but me and my sister keep gravitating towards this unassuming counter to beat the heat.I love their chocolate overloaded,Ferrero rocher and hot brownie sundaes.No complaints with respect to service,taste or prices.Highly recommended.

rollick is a familliour & trustworthy name in kolkata..as a result i can see there is much more crowd in rollick store than other(except swirl's)..
i used to a regular customer there when they started @ cc2 rajarhat in my school and early college days..
i am a great fan of there black forest sundae for ever..
i could recommend everyone to try it before anything..
though they don't give the cherry now & give cashew nuts & choco chips instead of that,but i would love to get back that cherry presentation.

Rollick is a familiar name among Bengalis, before mama mia, swirls, gelato italiano Rollick was like a Monopoly Ice cream Brand in Kolkata. There were times when this brand was overlooked because of new companies but now Rollick has again started to make its own mark again with its variety of ice cream which they offer at such a low price. 
I visited this place a lot of times n have tried out every single item on their list
Bon Bon, Nutty Roll are some of my fav
But Belgian Chocolate which would cost around 40INR is my fav
Brownie with Ice Cream is also a great choice
So in conclusion if you are on a tight budget but want some really good quality Ice Cream, Rollick is your place.. 
Rollick was my favorite Ice Cream brand when i was growing up, so its always a great feeling to visit this place and try out my old favorite Ice cream brand..

Rollick has been one of my favorite ice-cream brands besides Kwality since my childhood days. So when this new stall opened up at CityCentre2 ground floor, I had to visit the place to beat the scorching heat of Kolkata summer. Though I believe this small stall here can still be a bit upgraded but as of now they do have got some good stock. But some seating arrangements here would make the place even more attractive and buzzing, I believe. But as we know, Rollick has one big plus point, and it is the price which is always very reasonable. I really love their Black forest Sundae, Fruit n Nut, Mango, chocolate or black current cones/cups, etc. So I would say - if you are at this place on some hot summer afternoon, then just take a break and indulge in some cool sweet cravings and feel the bliss!
