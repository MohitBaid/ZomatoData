This is a very small but popular fast food joint near the back side of kasba new market. There are plastic tables and chairs in front of it in the open air but most people seem to option for take away. The owner is convincing and friendly. Not much can be expected from a street food outlet. But the food quality is quite good. And the foods are reasonably priced too.

I have no idea why this place is rated so poorly. This place used to be frequented by me quite often when the locality did not have much fooding options. 

I have tried the following from their menu :

1. Chicken fried rice - Did not like it at all.
2. Chilly chicken- Quite nice
3. Chicken Hakka noodles - Definitely recommend 
4. Egg chicken tarka - Now this is one dish i LOVE LOVE LOVE from this place. It has white gravy and succulent pieces of chicken and a whole egg
5. Chola Batura - Very filling.

Overall, the place is not a bad option for takeaways.

A very small eating joint. Resaonablly priced snacks like rolls , chowmine and lunch combos . The egg rolls and chicken rolls are moderately priced. Good to taste and the fast to deliver. Bad point is that Mughlai paratha does not come with the traditional  potato curry. Sauces used are branded and foods are light and safe for stomach. The owner is convincing and friendly.

This is a popular fast food joint near the back side of Kasba New Market. There are plastic tables and chairs in front of it in the open air but most people seem to opt for the ‘take away’.

We ordered for a home delivery – Chilli Chicken Boneless (Gravy), Chilli Chicken Boneless (Dry), Veg Fried Rice,  Veg Hakka Noodles and Egg Chicken Gravy Noodles.

We liked all the dishes except the Veg Fried Rice. It lacked sufficient quantity and variety of vegetables, however for just 60 bucks that may be justified.

What we liked most: The Dry Chilli Chicken. It was not fully dry and with the red and green capsicums and onions in it, the taste was liked by all of us.

I recommend this place for good Chinese food within a tight budget.

What to say... Went there to have biryani and was disappointed to the core. The rice wasn't properly cooked, the potato was hard and difficult to cut in the first place plus the chicken pieces was too chewy... 
A very bad experience.

Street food wise good. Craving for a bite while out with friends or sitting with relatives watching a movie? Go for it. The snack items are good. Some unprofessionalism and no proper sitting place but who cares when you are going for street food. Also they give home delivery nearby for bills over 200.

Nothing to say. We had tried the chicken biryani with the rice uncooked, potato also chapped and chicken completely bland. The owner is howling at his staff. No specific seating arrangements as there is no space to sit inside. I'll think twice before eating here.

Normal street food. Not to expect much. Have chairs to sit. To save some cash when hungry, this place can be visited usually. Service is fast enough.

They opened again... after a long break... my rating was solely on there food... as because they are very unprofessional... they also never bothered about these... remains closed uncertainty with out any reasons... also the the service was very lagging... but apart from that... there food was good... I am a huge fan of there tarkas and rumali rotis... also there Chinese section is quite decent... deco was so so... good for take away... otherwise you have to eat on there unhygenic ambience... pocket pinch was ok....

Not much can be expected from a street food outlet,  but yes..service is fast and food quality is quite good, but only if you ignore the mosquitoes and try enjoying the food.
Have some fond memories here with a few close friends though.
