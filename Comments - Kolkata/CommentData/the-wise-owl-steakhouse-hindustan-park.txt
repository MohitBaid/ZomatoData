I visited this place on 3rd Jan for a get together. Honestly both the service and food quality was highly disappointing. It took 1.3 hours to place the order as there was only one waiter who was busy attending other tables. Even the masala teas were served cold and that too with tea bags (the tea bags were of inferior quality). Coming to the food part- we ordered one chicken breast steak, one sizzler and one chicken burger. The chicken steak was served cold and the chicken was uncooked from inside. The sizzler chicken was so hard that it could be chewed properly. If after waiting 1.3 hours to place the order and another 45 mins to get the final dish is it worth it if you are being served with this kind of food? Although the ambience was good but the entire waiting episode killed all the interest.

I visited this place along with my friends for a get together and we took our seat at rooftop.Decor is good though bit dark but overall ok.Food quality is average. The service is really very slow and they need prompt action to take care of this negative point as they do not have enough hands to serve their customers.

I had visited The wise owl steakhouse today with a friend of mine for lunch. The place is on the rooftop of The wise owl cafe.It has a great ambience.If u want a quite place with cool breeze,this is the place for you. We ordered ice cream soda first with cheesy fries. The ice cream soda is a soda flavoured like vanilla ice cream and it went really well with the potato wedges drowned in cheese. We loved the dish. For the main course we ordered Grilled fish steak and Chicken sizzler. Both the dishes were delicious and the portion of protein in each dish was huge.
Though the wait time for the dish to arrive was around 40mins,it was worth the wait. The grilled fish had four pieces of bhekti with lemon butter sauce over a layer of mash with boiled vegetables. The chicken sizzler was served on a bed of lettuce with a tangy pepper sauce and chunk of chicken breast with two chicken sausage and boiled vegetables and garlic bread.Both the dishes had just the correct flavour.
The pocket pinch was around 1300 and we will surely revisit the steakhouse.
P.S.- I even packed fish finger with tartar dip for take away which when my sister had at home, she found it really tasty.

The Wise owl steakhouse was one of the places on my bucket list for a very long time ! The place has a coffee house on the group floor and an open rooftop restaurant!  The ambience is nice with an average view from the rooftop! 
Coming to the food , we ordered :
Chicken tex mex : It was a tangy chicken dry dish. 
Chicken Breast steak : The steak was a little chewy but had an amazing flavour . It was served alongside with a mushroom sauce,  some veggies and mash potatoes. 
Pork Platter : Contains 2 sausages , bacon , 2 slices of ham with 2 toastes, hash brown and grilled tomato . The platter was good ! 
Fresh line soda (sweet) : Nice and refreshing 


We found a strand of hair in our Chicken tex mex on complaining , we weren't charged for it ! So kudos for that !

Went there yesterday for dinner and I must say, I am glad to have found this place. Being a rooftop restaurant with wooden furniture and yellow lights, it has the perfect ambience for chilling with people who matter for as long as one wants. Coming to the food, we had ordered
Drinks: 
Blue Lagoon- Not that great. Was too sour and overpriced. Had to order this because they had run out of mojito.
Cold coffee: Was not disappointing or great. Just okay.
Food:
Pork Chops: The best I've had in recent times. It was absolutely delicious with well balanced pork meat and a slight strip of lard with it. The sweet sauce was amazing that topped the chops. Only the mashed potatoes accompanying the dish is capable of having more taste than it had.
Steakhouse Special for all meat lovers pizza: This was a marvel in itself! With a smoky flavour which I've failed to get in any of the other pizza places in town this was heaven on a dish. Only I would not mind a little more cheese on pizza ever but I don't know if that's too much to ask for. It is great value for money too as it come as a 12 inch Pizza which is quite big (8 slices).
All in all, my verdict is if one wants to eat at a not-very-crowded-place, this is the place they should come to. Their food is good but  some things can be improved for.sure. I'll definitely go back to try out the other dishes again. .

Last sunday finally made a visit to this amazing place and no wonder i wasn't surprised to see the place as it is a perfect combination of indoor and outdoor decor ...simple cozy and straight. Coming to the food,we ordered veg burger,caramel latte, and fish florentine and all were good...loved the consistency in their food taste....lovely...needs another visit to try a few more items

The food sucks and the dishes took eternity to be served to the table. We were appalled to be served a grilled fish after 40 minutes only to be plated with spoilt fish. 
Unacceptable service. Come over only if you have a taste for all things stale.

I ordered a rib eye steak (beef) for dinner and had the worst meal of my life. The steak had a weird smell. I just hope that nothing happens to me ...I mean food poisoning or something. I will definitely make sure that the restaurant is sued if anything awful happens to me  because of the quality of the food.

Just visited this rooftop Wise Owl Steakhouse. Firstly the ambiance and lighting is not that impressive. We ordered two dishes
1. Penne in white sauce- It's normal penne pasta in white sauce with cheese. It tastes pretty decent. Too cheesy. But overall nice. 
2. The Calcutta special steak- Since it was our first time over there, we decided to go with this by it's name. As described in the menu it's gravy cooked tenderloin served with poached eggs, mashed potato and veggies. The taste of the meat was good because of the sauce or gravy. But not happy with the quantity of the steak.
Overall the quality of the food was good. 

Now coming to the staff over there. We did not see adequate staff over there. Plus they took a lot of time to serve our food. They even mistakenly gave someone else's order to us. So they should hire more prompt waiters who are willing to serve properly. 
 
But the place is not that expensive.

I have only one word for Wise Owl Steakhouse: "SERIOUSLY???!!!!!". I mean, you are meant to be a respectable eatery. Food of such utterly pathetic quality wasn't expected from you. We ordered Farmer's Market salad, fish fingers with tartar sauce, chicken breast steak, and tenderloin steak in pepper sauce. For drinks, we ordered Cucumber Mojito, as Virgin Mojito wasn't available. 

They took about half an hour to serve the starter. 

The fish fingers were extremely bland. Fish fingers need to have a hint of lemon, black pepper, ginger and garlic. What they served were tasteless fish fingers, which were only marginally salvaged by the tartar sauce. There was the overwhelming odour of the fish, which we suspected to be basa.

Now, the cucumber mojito. Too sweet. Also needed a lot more basil to balance that heavy sweetness. 

The chicken breast steak. Dry. Absolutely dry. Absence of any kind of sauce on the plate was a heinous crime. What they provided was a thick mushroom-in-aioli dip in a tiny ramekin which could not be poured. It was basically a thick dipping sauce. The result was too dry chicken without any sauce to lubricate the whole dish.

The tenderloin steak was way too thick and dry and stiff. We asked them to make it medium-rare, but they said that medium-done steak was the way to go. The result was overcooked dry steak. The pepper sauce was okayish, but we've had better.

The veggies accompanying the steak was properly seasoned, but needed to be boiled a bit more. The mashed potato wasn't smooth and had lumps in it. *Sigh*

I've saved the best for last. Their Farmer's Market Salad. Oh My God. I've had many a salad in many a eatery in the limited time life has offered me up till now. I have never ever had such a horrible salad, EVER. You want to punish someone, you go ahead and feed them this salad. I mean, just thinking about it makes me shudder. Wilted lettuce and radicchio/red cabbage. Absolutely no crunchy element. But that doesn't matter. The first spoonful of that salad, and my palate was paralyzed by overwhelmingly awful dressing. They had completely doused the salad with a vinaigrette that's immensely incisive in its salinity. That's a fancy way of saying it was too goddamn salty. And oily. We couldn't but point out the problem to the waiting staff, and they asked whether they should cancel that item or replace the dish. We asked them to replace it. Well, fool me twice... What they did was to add more lettuce. They also added something that made it sweet. Don't know what it was. We couldn't finish it. Which is saying something, because we've finished our fair share of awful meals. I just can't put my frustration in words about that salad without cussing. What amused me even more was the description of the item on the menu. "... with a delicate dressing. Refreshing and healthy." If this is delicate, then so is Tusshar Kapoor's acting. The only palatable things they served were the french fries that came with the fish fingers, and the drinking water. That is it. Thank God for that, because we really needed that drinking water.

The ambiance is nothing to write home about. I would have loved it if it was a bit more well-lit. On a wintry evening, we were the only customers in a dimly lit rooftop. It felt like the beginning of a horror story. Well, if the food was anything to go by, it actually was.

My fiance and I decided to drop in for a romantic dinner date on 14th of February. The rooftop allows for cool breeze, but I'm not sure how it fares during summer. We took a table towards the inside, but unluckily for us, our table didn't have a proper lighting.  They had opted for lanterns at every table, and while it was romantic, it was inadequate.

Coming down to food, we had pasta and chicken. The plating was average, and the taste - nothing mind blowing. I have had better pasta elsewhere. And the portion could have been bigger.
 
We had pudding for dessert, the only dish that I really loved and would want seconds of.

Pocket pinch: INR1000 to 1200 for 2.

Located at purna das road near golpark, this place is the paradise for steak lovers. It is a rooftop restaurant above wise owl coffee shop and is highly recommended for people looking for sumptuous continental cuisine. 

The ambience is good and the food quality as well. Quantity is as par the menu price. Cucumber Mojito makes you totally refreshing. Barbeque pork ribs are heaven but the fat portion is a problem to eat. The assorted fried platter can make you feel full while the fish steak is a turn off.

One can spend hours here with friends or loved ones. And its a must visit place. Looking forward towards my next visit.

There is an Old saying, "all that glitters is not gold".
Frankly speaking This was not that good or that delicious 😋. It was an Ok and Preety average food quality. Its a long way to go, though they tried well. I. Must say they have attempted some exotic preparations but it turns out to be an ordinary one. And one more thing to add, how much time it takes to serve food though I agree this kind of food takes time to prepare but if you take so much time, people coming to your place will lose their apettite. There are lots of Steak Joints coming up in Kolkata, and Wise Owl have to strive hard. If you continue with this kind of food you will not be in the run. For sure they serve good coffees and Snacks but I am sorry to say The prices doesn't match the Food quality. 
If you have thought of Satisfying taste buds of People then you have to act and serve like one. Its not that easy. Subarna Bhowmik

Wise Owl steakhouse is located on the rooftop of Wise Owl coffee shop. A few metres walk from Hindustan park Puja Pandal, we visited this place during the pujas. The coffee shop is neat and tidy just as the steakhouse. It is airy and spacious and the view is nothing extraordinary. The decor is minimal with owl paintings and the seating is of wooden furniture. The staff were a bit indifferent although we were the only customers at that point of time. Coming to the food, for starters we had ordered barbeque chicken wings which tasted good. Then we had ordered pasta, fish in lemon butter sauce and chicken steak. The pasta was good, however the chicken steak could be improved upon. Fish in lemon butter sauce stands out among the rest. 
A bit overpriced, recommended for a one time visit.

If you have thought of Satisfying taste buds of People then you have to act and serve like one. Its not that easy. Subarna Bhowmik

Wise Owl steakhouse is located on the rooftop of Wise Owl coffee shop. A few metres walk from Hindustan park Puja Pandal, we visited this place during the pujas. The coffee shop is neat and tidy just as the steakhouse. It is airy and spacious and the view is nothing extraordinary. The decor is minimal with owl paintings and the seating is of wooden furniture. The staff were a bit indifferent although we were the only customers at that point of time. Coming to the food, for starters we had ordered barbeque chicken wings which tasted good. Then we had ordered pasta, fish in lemon butter sauce and chicken steak. The pasta was good, however the chicken steak could be improved upon. Fish in lemon butter sauce stands out among the rest. 
A bit overpriced, recommended for a one time visit.

Had been wanting to go here for a long time.So somehow managed to navigate the bylanes to reach .Travelled from rajarhat just because id heard good reviews taking more than an hour,cause in the end im willing to travel any distance for a a good steak!!....once u enter it was a bit confusing coz they have a sit out then a cafe inside then a reception of some sort till u ask where the steakhouse is,nobody seemed interested!!Anyway .took a lift up to the 3rd floor,then climbed a staircase to a terrace sit out,which was nice ,however i wonder who would visit her in the  humid summers of Calcutta!!There is only one attendant ,for 12 tables.I ordered a T-bone steak..well done with  A POTION OF PLAIN GARLIC BREAD.It took 50....YES 50 minutes for the steak to arrive,..it looked beautifully plated...Unfortunately was extremely rare with blood juices flowing out...Extremely disappointed,ate the mashed potatoes and veggys  with  bread only.I showed the attendant,Mr.bibau,the blood red steak and he said he would recook it...Recook a steak which took 50 minutes.!!said no thanks,,paid up and left!!and yes whether u want ur garlic bread without cheese or with cheese u have to pay the same price!!Lets see and give them time to Redeem or respond And will surely visit again if they realise what went wrong!!

If you have nothing else to do in this world you may consider choosing this place. They do not know that starters are meant to be given at the begining of a meal. They took more than one hour to serve all the food items (3 main dishes plus a starter). We had a take out item ordered at the beginning and  for that they kept us waiting 45 mins even after the completion of meal. The quality of food was however okay. I think, they don't want to hire enough number of people in their kitchen. I would never recommend this place to anybody.

A perfect place for a date on a lazy autumn evening.. The wooden furniture and simple decor relaxes you immediately.. Now coming to the munchies. We had ordered a jacobean burger which i really liked since the beef patty was oozing with its own juices.. The junior one was really huge.. Also a filet mignion medium rare was quite a chunk of juicy meat.. I wouldnt say that the service was slow because i know it takes time to cook beef.. Coffee was good too.. And the bill doesnt burn a hole in your pocket.. Happy to have found another hub for beef lovers like me..

Never come across such a awful service in any restaurant. No one to greet you when you enter the place. The order was taken in the most unprofessional way possible, without knowing what is available and what is not. The ordeal just begun like that which followed extra delayed service, no napkin in the table and so on.

After such brilliant welcome we ordered for California crumb fish, Hunter's chicken, Sirloin steak, tenderloin steak and chicken sizzler. Among these, only the chicken sizzler was eatable ..... Crumb fish was so so. All the steaks are wrongly cut and over cooked, and so is the hunter's chicken, we have taken away about half of the portions to fed Street dogs  ..... The result is extra tough and tasteless meat. Will never return to this place.

Worst ever Service. So horrible. Only 1 waiter and 1 Chef.  We ordered rib eye steak - 3 plates for me and my family. After 30 min they came back to say, this is not available. We had no other option but to walk out. It was on the roof top, and during rain in 3rd week of Oct, the rain water was entering. The floor was flooded. No air conditioning and it will be heated during summer. The tables were not properly cleaned. I shall never recommend anyone. Horrible service. Please avoid.

I visited this place on a weekend afternoon. Since the timing was odd, the rooftop didn't have a lot of people. However, I wanted a quick snack and the place was soothing enough for my taste.
The staff was diligent and attended to us dutifully.
We ordered a Mermaid burger (picture given) and something like a baked cheese toast (I can't recall the name!)
The food was quote delicious, and so was the presentation of the food on a wooden platter.
The interior is warm and simple with a huge Owl  canvas at the head of the room.
Next time, I'll make it a point to visit the Wise Owl Cafe downstairs, which has some really great interior decor.
Cheers!

I happened to go to this place with my friend during the Durga Puja, after a lot of pandal hopping. This is a good place with nice ambience and open and airy surrounding. The food, we expected to be costly, but it turned out to be quite cheap for the portion size. 

We ordered one beef steak (medium rare) with wine sauce, and one penne pasta with white sauce and chicken, with sides of coke. The steak was good and pink in the middle, but it was a bit rare in some parts. The sauce was good and added taste to the steak pretty well, and was not overpowering. The pasta was good too, however, it was a little greasy due to the olive oil drizzle. Overall, the food was good. And the total bill was just of 700, so didn't pinch the pocket, and we were full. 

So I would say its a pretty decent place to have dinner or lunch with friends or family.

I had gone to The Wise Owl Steakhouse on Panchami for lunch. The decor is completely wooden. We ordered for the Tender Loin Beef Steak with brown sauce and cooked rare. We had also ordered their ice tea. The food was brilliant and so was the service. The steak was a bit dry but that was compensated by the extra sauce that was served with the steak. This place definitely serves one of the best steaks in the city.

This place has since long been in my wishlist. So dropped in here last night for a birthday dinner. What I mostly loved about the place was it's ambience. 
We ordered battered prawn fry, chicken breast steak, tenderloin steak, fresh lime soda and cold coffee. The prawn fry was superb.  
The chicken steak was perfectly cooked and I particularly loved the mashed potato.. Can't say about the tenderloin as I didn't have that... A comfortable rooftop experience it was and I would love to visit again.

After seeing alot of people visit this place and hearing about it , my friend and I entered with huge expectations. The ambience is simple with wooden chairs and table and gives a very warm feel in the rooftop. 
The service was good but we ordered 3 dishes and he got all three together which was a bit disappointing. 
Now let's come to the FOOD. 

1) Southern fried chicken : Tasty and Simple. Fried yet it wasn't very oily. A thumbs up for that but the chicken pieces were very thin. Could have been a bit more fleshy. 

2) Hunters Chicken : A good breast piece with Rice. Delicious with the rice but a bit overcooked. 

3) Pork Chops : Amazing quantity with 2 prices of pork chop with some mouth watering Mash potatoes and veggies. The pork chop was cooked in butter and had some good aroma when it was served. 

The biggest drawback of this place was both these dishes were very dry. Some amount of gravy with both the dishes could have been perfect. A good place to visit not a great one considering the prices.

If you want to chow down on a hunk of meat in relative solitude then this is your best bet. I mean this was Saturday night and there was only one more customer in the entire joint. For most parts, we got the place to ourselves. The food was pretty good and the open rooftop seating played well as it was a cool windy day. I ordered the batter fried prawn, cheesy fries,  pork platter, T-bone steak, cucumber virgin mojito, and caramel custard. I thought the platter didn't have enough food to be called a platter. We had to split and divide the sausages and ham slices to make sure everyone got one. So, if you are 4 people order two. The service was descent but the waiter who served us really needs to work on his confidence and speech. He was literally whispering. However, this is nitpicking on what was a wonderful dinner. Would definitely consider coming back.

When you search for a specialty restaurant, the expectations tend to go high. The challenge with that is, if the food is even slightly off the mark the difference seems huge.

Food: Cheese Penne Pasta, GRilled Fish with lemon butter sauce, and a rib eye steak.

What works: 

Well, clearly, the ambience at the rooftop is quite appealing.The service is okay, the steward was reasonably well informed about the menu. The hygiene is well maintained and the presentation of food is above average.

The winner was the Beckti grilled in lemon butter sauce. It was almost as fresh as a morning catch, cooked with the right balance of lemon and butter and garlic, no one trying to overdo the other. Because of this, the fish was soft and delightful in the mouth, melting away in a  hurry.The presentation was good as well.

What could've been better: 

The chicken cheese pasta was over done with olive oil and quality of the penne was rather dull. I wouldn't dismiss it off as bad but there was nothing to write home about. They can certainly up the pasta inventory a bit, which should make it a bit fresher, and balance the olive oil so that it does not cancel out the cheese and pasta fragrance. 

The Rib Eye was a terrible disappointment. I could only eat less than 15% of it. About 25% I chewed and chewed till my jaws ached and rest I discarded.  A prime dish like this needs to be thawed before being cooked, otherwise, the meat tends to become tough. I had asked it to be done medium rare, and it was perhaps closer to well done. 

So there were multiple areas of improvement. When the chef came by, he acknowledged that it was not his day to cook and that the actual person had gone on leave so it was not done well. Huh? So much for a signature dish costing 450 bucks plus taxes!

Net of it, I wouldn't just write them off with one such visit, it would be unfair to them, but certainly some points to think about.

I was quite regular to wise owl cafe for my short meetings and evening coffees. This was my 1st visit to their steakhouse with my family. Find my experience below...

1) cream of chicken soup - I found more of maida than cream.
2) batter fr prawn -  hard tasteless batter separate from the tasteless prawns. 
3) grilled chicken -  a piece of grilled breast chicken with scattered around some sauteed vegetable and  unfinished smashed potato.
4) chicken burger - this was the only dish i shared with my 7 years old son.
5 ) roast pork - i ordered for a roast pork for myself which was mistake. It was almost 80% fat and less than 20% meat.I want to ask the management can any one eat 200 to 250 gms fat ?? I have returned the dish after tasting one or two pieces. But it was charged. I am uploading the pic of the roast pork for managements review.

My families evening was spoiled. Although I went with very high expectation. However, I ll definitely go back to wiseowl cafe but not upstairs. I would like to tell all zomato follower that it might  be one of bad days...
I also wish to advice to wise owl management with all my 24 years hospitality industry experiance that you must consult a good chef. 

Thanx

The Wise Owl Steakhouse had been creating quite a buzz among people recently and that's when I dropped in for my very own experience.
Open seating arrangement up in the terrace sets a great mood for a family brunch together. However, some people might not prefer it as it tends to get hot during the noon when the sun is at it's peak.

We started with a bunch of starters that included Cheesy Fries and Fish Fingers.
Both of them were good but a bit of seasoning would be great.
The drinks - Cucumber Mojito and Ice Cream Soda -needs improvement. I'd suggest them to use more of the natural ingredients.
This, followed by main course which had the amazing Chicken Steak accompanied by mash and sautéd veggies. Also Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce which, for me, was a little sour. The fish was good, however.
Not a big fan of Caramel Custards but this one was so perfect.
Overall a pretty good experience for my first time!

Dropped in for dinner with family.Now a days there are lot many stand alone European restaurants has opened in southern part of the city. 
Ambience - Good ! Cozy and roof top is nice breezy and wooden furniture sparks a rusty dusty feel
Menu - Nice decent choices though on enquiring found out pizzas were not available 
Service - Awful ! No water was served ; no bread rolls were offered before food! Server was not attentive ! Asked for grated Parmesan , never got on table . Billing took lot of time !
Food - we ordered Mushroom soup , Caesar salad , Penne in white sauce , chicken bar be que steak, cheese stuffed chicken breast with pilaf , Fish and chips , Roast Pork belly ! Let me go one by one 
Mushroom Soup - Texture taste was spot on . Temperature was not as a soup should be served at. 
Caesar Salad - served with ice berg not romaine ! Too much dressing ! shaved  Parmesan was missing !
Penne in white sauce - was average ! Sauce lacked flavor ! 
Chicken bar be que steak- Chicken was tough , chewy ! Cold mushroom sauce was served with it . Who serves a cold sauce with a hot steak ?
Chicken Breast with pilaf - This was was good ! Little indianise , chicken was cooked perfectly 
Fish and chips - the worst on the list ! Batter was not proper and not coated well ! Potato wedges and fish both was soggy ! One word 'disaster '
Roast Pork- pork belly was cooked to perfection ! A well balanced dish 

Over all not a very remarkable experience ! Service needs to improve a lot ! Good luck

On the third floor of wise-owl coffee shop is the steakhouse with an open enclosure. A true American  style steak house with wooden furniture and nice ambiance. The decor is simple yet soothing. 
Definitely a joint to go gaga with your friends and family over a beautiful meal and chit chat session. Oh yesh don't forget to click some pictures for your Facebook dp, hahah! 

When you meet your old friends after a lot time sure you have a lot to talk about, but first some delicious food to start with. 

For coolers we ordered- 
1. Cucumber Mojitos ( recommended) 
2. Ice-cream soda 

For the starters we had- @
1. Cheesy fries - salted french fries loaded with cheese and who don't love cheese.

2. Fish finger 
3.bangers and mashed - beautiful pork sausages in spicy sauce served with mash. 

4. Tenderloin strips

For the mains- 

1. Pork chops - pork chops are always my favourite I can drool over it again and again. Delicious pork chops in special sauce served with mash and veggies. 

2. Calcutta special steak - what makes this dish fabulous is the beautiful sauce. The beef steak was tender and melt immediately in you mouth. Definitely lip smacking. (@Recommended)  

3. Chicken steak

4. Fish in lemon butter sauce- what possibly can go wrong with the lemon butter sauce? Definitely worth a try. 

For dessert - 
Caramel custard.

Thank you wise-owl Steakhouse for the fabulous hospitality and mouthwatering  foods. Will definitely come back for more, till then cheers!

Located in the lanes of Hindustan Park,this steakhouse is a rooftop steakhouse with an open view,the decor is impressive with wooden tables and a lot of open space and a lot of trees around are soothing to the eye.I visited this place for lunch with a few of my friends and we ordered :-

•Beverages
Cucumber Mojito - It was really refreshing,sweet and tasted great.It was very well served in a large glass with some mint leaves and lemons.

•Starters
Cheesy Fries- The fries were quite impressive with a ton of cheese on top,the potato was well cooked and went well with the cheese,there were a few potato wedges also in it which was a added bonus.

Fish Fingers- They were served with a mayo dip and some fries,the fingers were crispy.Decent.

•Mains
Chicken Steak -The steak was the best dish in my view,really tender chicken which tasted heavenly,served with mashed potato and veggies.It was a perfect steak.

Pork Chops- The pork chops were really huge and were served with some veggies and mashed potato,the meat pieces were huge but with a lot of pork fat so it tasted quite different.

Fish in lemon Butter Sauce- It was really well presented and the fish was well cooked and tasted pretty good.

•Dessert

Caramel Custard- The custard was not too sweet and tasted good,It was like most other caramel custards but the impressive part was that they they did not make it overly sweet which most places do.

Coming to the service,it was quite good the staffs were courteous and the dishes were served on time. Overall a big thumbs up to the place.

This American style steak house is located on the 3rd floor of Wise Owl coffee shop. It has an open air space with wooden dining tables and a very soothing decor to make you feel delighted in a pleasant weather day. I went in a group of 6 people.
What we ordered-
1. Cucumber Mojito- This one's very refreshing and is well-presented.
2. Cheesy fries- This contains French fries loaded with cheese, some fried till golden brown and some having yellowish tint. A must try.
3. Fish Fingers- they give 6 fish fingers with tarter sauce and French fries, apt for a starter dish.
4. Bacon and mashed- The bacon pieces are soft and together with an unique sauce makes it taste even better. The mashed potato underneath the saucy bacon is nothing but bliss.
5. Tenderloin strips- I am a beef lover, so I had to order this. I was immensely impressed by the presentation of the dish. It contains veggies on top, beneath which has poached egg and under it lies minced beef pieces. The meat could have been cooked better as it was giving a rubbery feeling. Overall it's a good catch.
6. Pork chops- Two thick and huge pork chops with mashed potato and veggies makes you drool on them. They taste even better. The pork chops are perfect with the sauce and the mashed potatoes compliment the dish well.
7. Calcutta special steak- this is a chicken steak dish originating from America, but made in Calcuttan style. Contains a thick chicken breast covered with steak sauce and served with mashed potatoes and veggies. 
8. Chicken steak- The usual chicken steak presented uniquely by the Wise Owl. Taste is commendable.
9.Fish in lemon butter sauce- soft and juicy minced fish served with mashed potatoes and veggies melts in your mouth in no time.
10. Caramel custard- A good meal can't end without a good dessert. Caramel custard is an all time favourite. Perfectly shaped custard, soft and together with the caramel sauce is a perfect dessert dish for everyone. 
The dining area is solely an open air one,hence the weather must be suitable for people to sit and enjoy the food. The service is impressive, presentation of the dishes is top notch, the quality and quantity of food gets full marks. The food is quite reasonable in terms of price. Highly recommended from my side!

Went for a weekday lunch with few of my bloggers friends. The restaurant arranged special menu for us out of their vast menu options. They gave us selected and best out of each entries that were presented.

Ambiance : The Wise owl steak house is located on terrace of the same building which has wise owl cafe in the ground floor. Its a wooden flooring with big wooden tables and chairs. I have seen few of this kind of setting earlier but not with a terrace view. I felt ambiance would be super romantic with all the soft bulbs hanging around. I would love to explore that one day. Ample space is maintain between the tables which doesn't make the place clumsy.

Food: We were given watermelon mojito and ice cream soda on drinks to start with. Ice cream soda is one thing you should definitely try.watermelon mojito was on sweeter side which many would love who loves things sweeter. Starters we had cheesy fries which is probably the best I had recently. I mostly order this intem during pub hoping but I found this cheesy fries among the best I had ever anywhere.fish fingers were good too. I dint had pork chops and tenderloin steaks but pork and beef lovers would go crazy to have that. I heard from the one who had that they are among the best beef sand pork items they had. Trust me! They looked amazing and I know how did I stopped myself from having that. Chicken steak and Fish in lemon butter sauce were juicy and soft which is the best option for one who doesn't have beef and pork like me.
To end with we had caramel custard which ended on a high note.

Service : The service was super fast anf the staffs were really courteous. They always had a smile on their face which makes u realise they are in love with their place of work.

I would definitely recommend not to miss this one if you are around hindustan park and craving for some steaks.

I'm actually happy to give this place a five star.Firstly the ambience at the rooftop,we visited at noon but im sure it would be even better in the eve.Coming back to Food.They will make me coming bavk for more.A must Visit place serving superb steaks .

For Drinks we had Cucumber Mojito and Ice-Cream Soda.Both were superbly refreshing and you can't go wrong with either of these.

For starters we were spoilt with Cheesy Fries,Fish Fingers,Mashed Tenderloin Strips.

Main course started with Pork Chops,Calcutta Special and Chicken steaks followed by Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce.

And we ended on a sweet note with their signature Caramel Custard.

I always wanted to visit this place and finally i got the oppurtunity. Went there with my friends for lunch. The place,located at the top floor, is decorated elegantly. Perfect place for any occasion.

Coming to the food, we had at first cucumber mojito and ice cream sode. The first one is quite good while the latter one okhayish.

For starters we had cheesy fries, bangers and mash and fish fingers. The starters stole our heart. The cheesy fries were heaven in a plate. The fries were beautifully cooked and the goey cheese was just out of this world. Coming to the fish fingers, they were served hot. It was fresh and yummm. Bangers and mash were basically pork sausages with mash. The sausages were tasty. Loved the sauce it had.

Coming to the mains, we had pork chops, chicken steak and fish in lemon butter sauce. The pork chops came in huge portions with side of veggies. It was a visual treat to the eyes. The pork was cooked beautifully. Loved it. The fish was soft. Loved it with the butter sauce. Coming to the chicken dish, it was good too. The chicken was tender. Overall i loved all the main course dishesh.

For desserts, we had caramel custard. It was yummm. It was not too sweet and had the pefect balance of flavours.

I loved this place and will definately visit this place again. Recommendations: startes obviously and those who love pork and fish, do try their pork chops and fish in butter sauce. You wont be disappointed.

On the 3rd floor of wise owl coffee shop is the steakhouse. It's an open air enclosure, with wooden furniture giving it a rustic appearance.
The greenery around the place was extremely pleasing.
However, a pleasant weather would be cherry on the cake. Nevertheless, the food compensated for the weather.
For coolers, we ordered for ice cream soda (recommended) , and Cucumber mojito.
Starters comprised of , cheesy fries, fish fingers with tartare sauce, bangers and mash(recommended) , tenderloin strips with a sunny side up.
All the starters were extremely tasty.

The mains, included the Calcutta special steak (tender beef steak) , pork chops (recommended) , fish in lemon butter sauce (recommended) .
Very well prepared and the portions too were sufficient.
For Desserts, we selected the all time classic, caramel custard.

Great experience. :D

This place was in my wishlist for a really long time until recently when I got to visit the place for a lunch scene with my best friend. It is a rooftop restaurant with very simple decorations and cute wooden chairs and tables. Although the day we visited the weather was very pleasant but coming to this place during a summer afternoon can be a bit sweaty as there are no ac sections available. 
Now coming to the food we ordered for two starters and two main courses. 
First came in the Southern Chicken Fry. 5 pieces of beautiful Crumb fired chicken served with mayo and a lemon wedge. The chicken was succulent and cooked to perfection with a perfectly crispy ouside. An amazing choice we made by ordering this dish ❤️ a must must try here! 
Then came in the California Crumb Fish. 5 pieces of extremely soft and well cooked fish crumb fried and served with mayo and lemon wedge. It was more or less same as the southern fried chicken. But it was also very good. The fish was of extremely good quality hence the taste came out so well. Another must try from this joint ❤️
For the main course there was-
The Calcutta Special Beef Steak- a big fat steak perfectly cooked in a brown sauce served with mashed potato, sauteed vegetables and a sunny side up. It was the first time that I tried beef and boy I chose the right place to try it for the first time. It was juicy and exploded such amazing flavours in the mouth just after taking the first bite. Surely justifies the name Calcutta Special ❤️
Pork Chops - at first we wanted to order pork ribs but before taking down the order we were informed that the pork ribs contains 80% fat and very less meat and whether we are ok with eating that much pork fat. We skipped ordering that and instead ordered pork chops which had plenty of meat. It was again served with sauteed vegetables and mashed potatoes. The chops were a bit overcooked so the meat became quite dry but taste wise only the word amazing could describe it. It was awesome 😍 
Now talking about the service, it was prompt. They didn't take much time in serving our orders. One thing I would like to mention is that it is a very appreciable act to inform the customer about what to expect from a dish which they are about to order as we did with the pork ribs so that they can change their order as per their liking. A big thumbs up 👍
And another thing that I would really want from this place is that they should include more dessert options in their menu. The choices are very limited which is kind of disappointing. 
An amazing experience that I gained after visiting the place and will definitely visit again to try out the other steaks and starters. 
Happy Fooding ♥

Four of us visited the place today. We ordered Chicken Al-a-Kiev and Bbq chicken wings alongside cola float and cucumber mojito. The Bbq chicken wings was the best part of the entire stay at the cafe. The host was quite good. But, the steakhouse couldn't provide us with most of our first choices as far as the dishes are concerned. The ambience was, however, pretty good.

Me and my friend went for dinner here in love for steaks, but HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED with the quality of the food.
1. Caesar Salad- Mentioned in the menu caesar salad with romaine lettuce but there was no romaine instead it was iceberg when asked the server said, " Romaine being a bit bitter our chef do not add it"
2. Mash Potato- not strained well, grainy and not seasoned well.
3. Butter Tossed Veg- French Beans and Broccoli not blanched properly.
4. Steaks- we ordered for Rib Eye and Sirloin, to my goodness the steak came pre cut, then what's the point of giving a STEAK KNIFE along with it???? for the first time in my chef life got the chance to see that steaks can be served pre cut that too a "RIB EYE...."
5. Jus- it was so thin and watery that instead of pouring the jus onto the steak we resorted to dip the meat into the so called "JUS"..
Request to the MANAGEMENT: PLEASE HIRE TRAINED STAFF AND PLEASE SERVE WHAT ALL IS MENTIONED IN THE MENU...

Was in town and was craving a nice steak. But boy oh boy was the experience disappointing. 1. The Caesar salad had iceberg lettuce which was strange, as the menu said that its supposed to have romane lettuce. Once we asked the server about this, he said " well romane is a little bitter so we don't add it". 
2. Mashed potato was grainy, not a smooth and creamy delicacy that we are used to.
3. The steak came pre cut! WHY!!!?? I like to cut out my own portions thats the whole experience of eating good meat. The sauce was runny and watery, not the consistency of the jus that we expect. It was so thin that instead of pouring it on top of the steak we had to resort to dipping it on the sauce.

To the management: Please hire a better chef, and write things on the menu that you are actually serving.

The Steakhouse is located at the rooftop of wise owl cafe. Address is same as that of wise owl cafe. Ambience in okayish with wooden chairs and tables. The cafe remains always full where as the Steakhouse is rather empty. We went on a Sunday afternoon and we were the only guests. Nevertheless food quality was quiet upto the mark and quantity is also ok. We ordered cheese garlic bread, green tea, roast pork and Anglo Indian burger( minced beef patty and pork) overall a nice experience but I would suggest to add some more options in beverages.

The wise owl has 2 parts.. a cafe downstairs and the steak House on the rooftop.. we went to the steakhouse at around 5 p.m. we were the only ones there.. we initially ordered tenderloin steak, pork chops and bacon wrapped sausage.. first came the sausage.. it was superb.. and just according to the description.. next came steak and pork chops.. I liked the steak a lot.. it came with mushroom sause.. it was juicy and cooked just the right amount.. one improvement here could be the taste of the mashed potatoes.. it was kind of bland.. for eating the pork chops u had to get your hands dirty.. literally.. but it was all worth it.. then we finished off with the big beef burger.. it was simply awesome.. hands down.. and all these amounted to a bill of just 1400.. I loved this restaurant.. will surely visit again..

Wise Owl has a lovely ambience. It's filled with, no surprises there, owl based decor that I love. 
The service is ridiculously slow.
I love their penne pasta with parmesan cheese and meat wonderland, which is exactly what it's called. Didn't really like their pizza. 
Brownie points for the rooftop seating. 
It's quite expensive, though, especially if you want to have a filling meal.
It's good but not extraordinary food at a heavy price.

Worst service.After waiting for 45 minutes we were told that no chicken sandwich was available. Would not visit again or recommend. Even the drinks ordered were nothing special, nothing to gush about. I still don't see how it could take 45 minutes to relay the message that sandwiches aren't available.

Went to this place the first time..though I went to wise owl a couple of times. Firstly the fans are placed in such a way that you wont get any if it. The food we ordered were absolutely terrible. The potato wedges we ordered were of huge size. Capresse salad was disgusting and the last one southern fried chicken tasted shit. It's like the chicken was frozen for many days, did not care to fry it properly. And when they served us it was not even hot. Pissed my mood. And on top of that very slow service.

Located in the bylanes of Hindustan park the easiest way to go is to follow the lane of Kimadanti from Gariahat or heading straight from Golpark.
The setting is on the rooftop of 66/2B guest house.Yea the ambience is cool being a rooftop place but in a hot humid summer the crisp cool AC really beckons.It would have been cool had there been a small Enclosed Air-conditioning place.
Wooden tables , hanging bulbs gives the place a nice look.
Since we visited for just a snack wr only had Chicken Barbeque Wings , Virgin mojito and Choco lava ice cream.
The chicken wings were too good with its crisp tangy taste.
The chocolate lava ice cream with Sizzling hot brownie tasted superb.
Only complaint was the service was painfully slow.
Definitely it awaits a next visit to indulge in the other gastronomic experience.

It's a medium rooftop restaurant. The ambience is sort of ok. Decoration is simple Neet but not that good I would say. Behaviour of the workers where excellent. We had salads in the entree, with ice tea and in the main course we had two different kind of steaks both being a beef Steak they tasted good good actually. Both well medium rare you could see the pink colour inside the meat when you call it which seemed satisfactory. After dinner we had two different kinds of coffee 1 was simple cappuccino another Cafe Americano. I wouldn't say that they were excellent but wasn't the worst you can have. Overall the experience was good I would say, the price was reasonable. I would like to add one miner point that you are supposed to give tip to the workers there which is not included in the bill.

Steakhouses are a hit in this city . With the recent trend of a number of continental and steakhouses opening in the city , it is now a fact that the people of Kolkata are hardcore for meat lovers and will not shy away from the idea of going for something adventurous . Starting with some tender pork slices to a big chunk of beef tenderloin , the new age Bengali will have it all . There is a common trend of menu selection that goes on into these restaurants . They mostly will have some starters consisting of a fish and bacon . Main course will have grilled items , pizza , pasta and the much covered steak . What's interesting is that most of these restaurants have pulled off the gig by serving good quality items most of the time . Wise Owl Steakhouse is not new to this scene . They have been a go to place for steak lovers for quite some time inspite of having mixed reviews . So this Saturday evening I decided to check their outlet out to satiate my meat cravings . Please note that it was meat cravings and not only steak cravings since i am not just a lover of a particular dish. Every dish is a different adventure to me and when I looked at their menu , I was impressed with the variety of meat offerings it presents to it's patrons .

° LOCATION :-  Okay so this steakhouse is located at Purna Das Road . If you are coming from Gariahat or Rashbehari you need to take the lane which is closest and located opposite to the City Style triangular park . Then you have to walk past the lane which also houses the " Good old days " , and then take a left turn . Once you take the left turn you will walk some few steps and you will reach Wise Owl . The ground floor houses the Wise Owl cafe and the rooftop has the steakhouse .

-------------------------------------------------

° FOOD :- As I already stated earlier I was impressed with their unstylish or should I say unkempt menu card presenting some nice meat dishes . I don't think you will ever find so many varieties of steaks in any part of the city . The dissapointing part is that the not so conventional steaks are offered at a much higher price . Since this is my first time I decided not to experiment much and went for the below items .

1. The Pork Platter ( 4 / 5 ) :- I was impressed when I saw the offerings from the menu . I was delighted when they brought the platter to the table . I was content on having the items in the platter one by one . The platter has similarities to the breakfast platter served at Kaventers . It has 2 toasts served with a bowl of chunks of butter . The idea is to have butter toasts along with the meat which is yummy . 2 large pieces of sausages are served which were yummy . I think 4 large slices of fried bacon were there which tasted heavenly with the butter toast . 2 huge slices of fried ham was there which were again lovely . I rubbed some butter and pepper in them and the result was yummylicious . The meat and toast were also accompanied by a fine roasted tomato and the supposedly called hashbrown which tasted good but didn't seem anything like it . Overall , it is a superb​ dish to have if you are a pork lover . The toast added a breakfast feel to it and I loved it . The only missing item was a poached egg but that's okay . Highly recommended if you are a pork lover .

2. Chicken Spaghetti Bolognese ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Not a Bolognese sauce expert but the dish could have been so much better of it had been spicier . But then again maybe it was meant to be that way so that the original flavours could be felt . Firstly the quantity was huge . Enough for 2 people . The spaghetti pasta was excellent . The meat was a mixture of chicken cubes and keema which was complimenting superbly with the pasta and that was the highlight of the dish .The sauce had a clear blend of garlic , oregano , red chillies and cheese . While the sauce was tasty , I felt like adding some more pepper or chillies to it and that's where I deducted some points . But still ,a good choice for the meat lovers .

3.The Calcutta special beef steak ( 4 / 5 ) :-  So finally came down to the main event and that is the beef steak . Was very interested from the name and the description . It said " gravy cooked tenderloin " . Here the gravy is nothing but the steak sauce which is smeared over the steak as the meat is grilled . The steak is served with a poached egg , mashed potatoes and sauted veggies . The veggies included broccoli , beans , bell pepper and corn . Firstly , the steak sauce felt a little salty . But as we progressed it was better . The size of the meat was impressive and larger than many steakhouse . The mashed potatoes and veggies were good too .Its not the best steak I have ever had but it was certainly good enough to satisfy our steak cravings .This steak is recommended from me .

4. Virgin Mojito & Cola Float ( 4 / 5 ) :- The 2 drinks as choose were a bit on the costlier side but that was made up by the quantity . The mojito was served in a large glass and the flavor was proper where the lime didn't overpower . The cola float was superb . Once again it was served on a big glass . The bottom of the glass is basically cola and the top has ice cream . The good part is that they will also give you the bottle where the cola is still left . I was really impressed that they honestly gave the left over cola after pouring some into the glass . Both the drinks were nice and recommended .

----------------------------------------------

° AMBIENCE & SERVICE ( 4 / 5 ) :- The 4 is mostly because of the ambience because frankly it is really superb . The asbestos covered roof houses the open air restaurant . The tables , chair and floor are all wooden which gives a unique vibe to this place . Due to the height , a sudden rush of wind is not rare and you know that when that happens a rooftop experience is simply enhanced . Since , we went in the evening the lighting was to our advantage . We simply loved having food there . Another advantage of being in rooftop is that you can smoke with your food . Go for a dinner date in this restaurant as you will definitely have a good time . The service was okayish . It was not that bad as it was mentioned in some reviews . Yes the serving time was a bit more than expected . But they were very amiable and was courteous to our every need . 

° VERDICT :-  Yes it is worthy of a visit and I have the following good reasons :- 

1. Classy and nice rooftop ambience . Great for dinner dates .
2. Excellent varieties of recipes for meat lovers including pork , beef , chicken and fish .
3. Nice basic tenderloin steak .
4. Many varieties of beef steak.  

This place is worthy of a second visit mainly because of the stunning ambience . Next time I will surely try one of the fish dishes and maybe some other variety of steak .

The food here is indeed very good and there's no denying that. The tenderloin steak I ordered was cooked to perfection. Housed on a terrace on Purna Das Road, this place has the perfect ambience and a very well thought-out decor. What didn't work for us at all was the service. Although the staff were very polite and apologetic about the lapses, it was clear that they are understaffed. As a result, our order was placed after waiting for half an hour. Another half hour for the soup and bread to arrive. Another half hour to place the order for the main course. It was a weekend and we weren't in a hurry and we wanted to try this place, but on any other day I would have surely walked out.

Accidentally landed up there a week back. It was a nice with the live band performing and the cool breeze of saturday Kolkata evening.   The ambience is rugged, not suited for everybody's flavour, but it was good. Food is good but somehow I was not satisfied with the quantity of portion they served me. I think they should reconsider their portion size.

Overall, if today the Kolkata weather is not quite humid and you do not need an air conditioner .... this is a great place to spend an evening with your loved one. 

Oh! another info.... you can smoke there and if you are out of cigarettes, they will arrange for you against payment.

So today was the day I finally decided to check out Wise Owl Steakhouse and I have to tell you that I regret not checking it out before.Located on Purna Das Road, the place isn't  difficult to find. The restaurant is located on the rooftop. It is open air and you are allowed to smoke. The service is prompt, but that may just be because we went during the afternoon and the place was empty then. The staff was courteous and helpful. Coming to decor, it is minimalistic and  mainly wood based and it goes with the feel of the place. The ashtrays are tiny metal buckets and it's really cute. The place would be better if visited in the evening it felt.Coming to the food, we ordered Bacon Wrapped Sausages, The Little Hog burger and two Tenderloin Steak. The bacon wrapped sausages come with garnished  mashed potatoes and the it tastes beautiful. The sausages were soft and melts in your mouth and the bacon just adds to that. The burger was tasty ad filling and served with potato wedges. The tendeloin steak was my main course and I had ordered it  with Mushroom and Creme Sauce.  The steak is served with herb  tossed veggies and mashed potatoes. My only complain was that the  veggies here were a little hard, a little underboiled and they should look into that. The steak was cooked as medium done  and that's how I like it. But to my surprise it was the softest beef steak I have had in Kolkata.  The meat is  soft and the aroma itself is  something one can fall in love with. And the sauce went very well with it. The meat tasted great,  juicy,  soft  and a pleasure for  your taste buds. This is a must try for anyone visiting this place.

They serve good food.
BUT
They have pathetic service, and ill mannered stuffs.

The ambience is okayish.
Liked the little lamp they keep on tables.

We ordered BBQ chicken wings, tasted great.
Steak House special pizza was good as well.
Chicken Steak was good, could have been better.
More tender and better flavour is expected.

4.5/5 for food
2.5/5 for Service
3.5/5 for ambience.

Very good food. We had gone there a little late ,so we wanted to order before reaching. When we called, the owner personally spoke to us and kept the place open for us to reach and place our order. Extremely good behaviour from the staff too.
A 'must go' if you love steaks.

I went here for the 1st time with my family and was apprehensive about the steak since we had a British guest with us. But wise owl exceeded all our expectations. The quantity as well as the quality of the meat served was just beyond culinary paradiso. The doing of the meat was perfect according to order and the sauces were simply superior . I enjoyed the steak like never before.

Just came back after our visit. Friends got together for some fun time. Left with a pukish feeling!! Had ordered Fish & Chips & Virgin Mojito. The fish was like fish Orly only with litres of oil oozing out of it.... Couldn't have been more repulsive. The Mojito tasted like sugar syrup!!!! How worse can it get than this.?? Used to love this place...used to visit often with family. Still pondering whether the chefs ever tastes their own food or have they grown beyond their name!!!!! Only points for their ambiance and service...

This Steakhouse is located at the rooftop of the Wise Owl cafe. It has a very good ambiance with only wooden chairs and tables being available and most of the time the place is very dimly lighted. The ambiance is ideal for a steakhouse. Food quality is also good and the Mixed Grill Sizzler is surely one of the most delicious items one can come across. Though the waiters would suggest that one portion is more than enough for two but that is hardly the case as two hungry souls would definitely be needing much more. Pricing is a bit high but that is expected. Overall just like the cafe below this place is also recommended, may be not as highly as the cafe though!

Let's divide everything in pros and cons.
Pros: 
1. Good ambiance.
2. Good view(as it is on the roof).
3. Could be easily located.
4. Got steak and grilled foods(mmm good news for steak lovers)
5. The starters are good(you can try any of them).
6. The fish steak and grilled fish is awesome.
7. Staffs are very polite and friendly.
Cons:
1. The beef steak is very chewy. Not so tender, be it rare, medium or well the steak remains very chewy.
2. The pork chop tastes good and stays soft and tender as long as it is hot. The moment it starts to cool down it looses it's tenderness. 
3. The price in comparison to the quality you get in here is not very friendly(except for the starters, fish and chicken steak). For two it might cost around 1400 to 1500.

Verdict:
I would recommend this place for some particular food items and for the ambiance. If you choose wisely your day/evening might turn out nice and beautiful.

After our exams got over.
My friend and me decided to go there.
I took mixed tandoor sizzler and my friend took beef sizzler.
Mine was good but the beef sizzler wasn't that good enough. It was very hard and not well prepared. 
Ambience was very nice. I like rooftop concept so much.

The fish and chip was absolutely not classic style.. Fish was very soggy.. We dint enjoy it.. I had better pork sausages then the one which was served to us.. And spaghetti bolganese was edible..

Pretty rooftop with decent food in its price range. It was a couple outing and we went straight to the main course. Pork chops and grilled fish was our order, pork chops was almost perfect except the fact that the meat could have been a bit more tender. The grilled fish had a little fishy smell which was more than usual. Overall a decent experience if you are looking for a rooftop where you can enjoy ur meal with a smoke.

Couple of friends and I came here for a random lunch outing. Ordered a Pork burger, chicken spaghetti and a steak. Quality of food is really good, tasty and filling. Prices are a little steep, but standard for the kind of food they serve. The place was fairly empty, so the service was non fussy and smooth. The man servicing us was very polite and gracious. But, one thing that you should absolutely come here for is the ambience. Out of all the things that I used to dislike about the wise owl was the pseudo intellectual ambience. But here, you're on a rooftop, with a view of the city and cool spring winds gushing. It's absolutely the best. Recommended.

This place has always been good to me, and the addition of a rooftop steakhouse is a bonus. The decor is really simple - hardtop wooden benches and chairs, roughly polished, a wrought iron lamp on each table, large space and fairy-bulb lightings..I love it !
The menu is well structured, mainly Continental and Italian cuisine. I get the idea of attaching sheets on a board, put the oil patches on them look dirty :/ Anyways. The food here is really good. Be in in taste or quantity. 
I have been here three times already. And the dishes I have had are -
#California Crumb Fish - much like the fish cutlets we bongs love, but with a crunchy thin crust and tartar dips :)
#Morrocan Spicked Chicken wings- the spice rub they use on the chicken gives it a good hit of 'jhaal'. The meat is really tender,  almost like kebabs ! 

#BeerBatterPrawns- Big sized prawns, coated lightly and deep fried. Served with dips. Classic finger food. Recommended. 
#TenderloinSteak - I took medium rare with pepper sauce and the other time with bone marrow reduction. They did justice to both the sauces. The steak was cooked to perfection, served with mashed potatoes and blanched veggies. I only wished they could serve it in a sizzler. That would have enhanced the taste even further. The quantity of the dish is more than enough for a single person! 
#Spaghetti with Meatballs (chicken)- a good preparation indeed. Huge meatballs tossed in tangy sauces and it really fills you up. 
For Dessert we had their Caramel Pudding, which was soft and served with ample Caramel sauce. Loved it. I'm eager to try out their burgers the next time I visit !

When craving some tenderly cut meat from the loin and rib, grilled yet succulent, on your plate, you can trust The Wise Owl Steak House. They have an exhaustive list to quench the craving of steak lovers! The juicy medium-cooked, flat cut piece of meat comes with mashed potatoes, sauted seasonal veggies and a lip smacking cream of mushroom sauce! Also try out the grilled fish platter. Bhetki comes with veggies, that melts in your mouth in no time! The seating is comfortable and the evenly spaced, airy rooftop is just perfect for a laid back spring dinner, while sipping onto some tangy fresh lime. The staff is prompt and always ready to serve. Would love to try out the rest of what they have to offer!

I wasn't aware we have a lovely roof top dining area in Hindustan Park as this place. 
Decor/ambience - bags full point as rooftop is a major perk to have during winter. 
Food - average
Service - good
This is home away from home for stake lovers, albeit being a vegan I cudn complain much! Ordered cottage cheese stake which was well cooked.

Now, there are places and then there are Places. The former is usually a blip on the journey. An itenary of sorts. The latter is soul. With food, I have this sort of a relationship and the places I visit are usually the places I visit most often. Wise Owl coffee shop has been a haunt and with the addition of the steakhouse it became a pilgrimage. Any rooftop venue is a 'to die for' premise for me especially if it's located within the leafy neighbourhood of Purna Das Road. 
The steakhouse has a charm of its own. The service is a tad slow but then that comes in as a perk since spending time is a favourite past time here. What they make up with is great behaviour. The servers are polite and extremely too and one is allowed to amble along. Wise Owl steakhouse is not only  about the food, which though good, but not grand yet and I am certain that they will get there soon. Their steaks are mouth watering but at times, very rarely, does the meat feel tough. They have a great assortment of gastronomic delights and with time most of it will certainly top my list of 'soul food'. The thin crust veg pizza, needs a special mention. Try it to believe it. 
Now I can go on forever for that's how good the ambience is. If you are nearby and wish to hit the breeze, get up to the terrace and plunge into the many wonders of the Steakhouse.

I went to this place in quest of delicious steak and it did not disappoint me. I asked them to prepare tenderloin steak as medium and warm. It was really tasty and mouthwatering. Talking about its ambience, it is on the terrace of a guesthouse with all sides  open. Anyone will like its openness on a soothing sunny day or light rainy day. The interior is bit offbeat (it reminds me of the tables and chairs of our high school .. :) ) yet beautiful. I am definitely coming back in some rainy day.

As the name suggests , they are famous for steaks. If you are smitten with steaks, then you should definitely visit this place. 
Apart from steaks , they serve amazing varieties of entrèes. We had ordered barbeque chicken wings. Amazingly decorated and tasted out of the world. Juicy pieces of chicken wings with barbeque sauce, perfect start to a dinner 😍
Coming to mains, we had obviously ordered a steak, it was Calcutta special beef steak, served with mashed potato, a perfect sunny side up and veggies. I did not taste the steak, but according to my friend it was perfect, she was so pleased that she literally wanted to kiss the chef. Apart from the steak we had ordered spaghetti Bolognese and Caesar salad. I know the salad sounds weird, I mean who orders  salad in a steakhouse, but trust me the perfect combination of lettuces, olive oil with amazing seasonings and great deal of chicken chunks made it just mind blowing. And coming to the spaghetti , it was equally loved by all of us. We had even ordered 2 glasses of cold coffee which quenched our thirst and perfectly blended with food. 
The food tasted best with the amazing ambience.  Perfect rooftop lounge to enjoy the food with the cool breeze kissing your face. 
I'm only disappointed with the late service of the food. They literally made us wait for 45 mins. Otherwise the staffs were really good and friendly. 
Definitely worth more visits.

It was late afternoon in early feb that me and my wife were in Gariahat area for some time and due some reason could not manage a timely lunch. So on our way back home we decided to stop at this restaurant for a snack.
The rooftop is nice and the casual decor also went with the theme. The staff seemed very well behaved. We order a grill sandwich and mixed grill sizzler. Food portions were good enough. The sandwich had too much of raw onions to my liking. They could have caramelized the onions before putting them in the sandwich. The mixed grill sizzler was okay, the garlic bread that came with the sizzler didn't taste good. We ended our afternoon meal with a molten choco brownie with ice cream. This one was really bad... It was salty. I could make out that it was due to the use of salted butter in the brownie. When i told the staff about it they called the chef. The chef kept arguing that a brownie is supposed to be made of salted butter! ! I decided to end my discussion hence paid the bill and moved out.
Above average experience. Loved the ambience and the staff behavior.

Hi Wise Owl. Ordered the Big Pork burger for home-delivery (via Swiggy). Thanks for sending in a horrible burger with a raw pork patty in the middle, and then charging me 350 bucks for it.

Am I the only one one who knows that pork has to be cooked all the way to be safely consumed? Does your cook need to be taught that?

Photo attached.

Wise owl is a popular name now, thanks to the cafe. And now there is a steakhouse from the Wise owl banner. Okay fine, it wasn't until Pujo'16 that i realized that there's a rooftop restaurant in the same building as Wise owl.

Nevermind. Last week at around 9pm, three of us decided to visit the place to check it out ourselves. The pictures seen on Zomato does not do justice to the real beauty of the place. It is a beautiful beautiful place (yes, I repeated that!). The lights, the ambience, the rustic furniture, everything adds to the beauty of the place.

It was cold and breezy the day I decided to visit this steakhouse and you can very well imagine what a lovely experience I had! I'll give them a full marks for their ambience and infrastructure.

Coming to the food directly.

• Barbeque chicken wings - the presentation was really good. And it tasted brilliant too. 6 pieces of tender, saucy wings. Started the lovely dinner on a lovely note.

• Caesar Salad - my very diet conscious friend insisted on ordering this as his dinner for the night! No amount of coaxing for him to order a steak budged him from his decision. So be it! I was really annoyed that someone would actually come to a steakhouse to order a plate of stupid salad. But hey, when the plateful of veggies and chicken arrived, I'm guilty of tucking in 4 big spoonfuls! The lettuce was sweet, there was ample of chicken chunks and the aroma of olive oil was tantalizing. I've never tasted such better tossed salad!

• Spaghetti Bolognese with Chicken Ragu - Another of my friend decided to order this. The pasta tasted amazing to say the least. This is the ultimate recipe for any pasta lover, complete with a truckload of chicken mince. The item was made perfectly and the quantity was overwhelming. Even after an hour of voracious eating, the two of us couldn't finish it! Yes, we had to pack the remainder home. This dish is absolutely recommended.

• Calcutta Special Beef Steak - this was my order, and needless to say the best dish of the night! It had a big chunk of steak with sautéed veggies, mashed potato, and a sunny side up. The spread can light up any foodie's face! The steak was tender and the mash was perfect, so much so that my friend kept stealing the mash from my plate! The sunny side up and the beef steak was a classic combination and I would really go up and kiss the chef for this brilliant preparation! Recommended a thousand times!

• Cold coffee - this was the perfect drink for the perfect night. The ice-cream was blended really well creating the perfect frothy drink that it was. It was so amazing that I ended up devouring two glasses of it! Yeah I'm quite a glutton, thank-you!

Bill - 1798, or almost 1800. The food was worth every penny.

Now you must be wondering why this beauty of a steakhouse didn't score full marks. That's because, my friend, they made us wait for a ridiculously long time for the food. More than 45mins. We were the last to leave the restaurant, somewhat around 10:35pm. That was because they served the food late, and then we took around an hour to finish the food off.

The servers are friendly and helpful but the time taken to serve is ridiculous! I mean who waits more than 45mins for a plate of chicken wings?

However this place deserves a visit definitely for its beautiful ambience. I'm definitely going there again!

I have known this place for a very long time, but lately, I've been frequenting it quite often. It's on the 4floor on the WiseOwl Guest House. Love there logo n basic Interior's, very rustic with solid wooden furniture and open air on 3 sides. 
I just keep going back for there garden salad 🥗.. it's just fresh lettuce n veggies tossed with a great dressjng. Food has always been good but sadly no alchohol is served. Prices are pretty reasonable. Other dish I have here not mentioned on the menu is sautéed assorted vegetables with garlic.  That's my mains 😉 My other fav is grilled fish with lemon butter, comes with mash n veggies, good by Kolkata standards. At least no Basa 😃 My friends tried pork spare ribs(big portion), Calcutta steak, fries platter, fish n chips, Caesar salad etc all were good. It's a hidden gem and I see it finally picking up. The service is very slow and the kitchen struggles when it's a little busy. Other than that a great place to hangout with lots of privacy, fresh air and good food..

The Wise Owl steak house is an almost famous food joint near Gariahat , right opposite the Azad Hind Dhaba. They have a cafe downstairs , which , again , I have heard is better than the restaurant itself.
I went there with three of my friends for lunch on one winter noon , and guess what , the fun started right after we entered.
I came to know previously that this classy joint is a real go-go for local celebrities , actors and models. As soon as we were about to enter the joint , a random guy came to us and yelled unnecessarily about how good the place is and what awards did it win , only to make us realize that he was high! Entrance is decent with outdoor accommodation , and the restaurant is on the roof top.
When we reached the restaurant , it seemed to be empty and waiters seemed to be pretty ignorant about our presence. Water was served a while later , without asking whether we will take regular or mineral. Still , these can be ignored as in most places , attendants do not have formal training about how to greet a guest.
We ordered an all day Chicken Breakfast , a pork platter , a mushroom cream soup , a Chicken Al-a-Kieve ( fancy spellings ) and Barbecue Pork Ribs. Soup was okay. Pork ribs were not even close to tender , a piece of metal wire was found the butter served with the breakfast and Chicken Al-a-Kieve was under cooked. We made no delay to send it back , only to listen that this was how Chicken Al-a_Kieve is cooked.
However , a Chicken Breast Steak was served for us , and finally , two Caramel Custards , which they said , were served as they wanted to say sorry. Apology would have definitely be accepted guys , only if the Custard would have been tasted good.
So in short , I would like to say , you guys can do better. Until then , I am going to stick with The Steak Factory.

The search for handsome steaks with awesome taste ends here!
The rooftop ambiance is decent and neat. We had tried their pasta i.e yummy! We wanted to have more of it. Anyway next came the steak platter. The platter was perfectly grilled and sauteed with mushrooms, veggies and mashed potato. It was divine bliss for us.
Burger was plain. Didn't like it actually.
Staff was friendly and attentive too :)
Would love to visit this place again :)

Good place to hang out with friends and family. The rooftop is simply done, no big deal about it. Dim lights and all (although some table lights were not working).Yet, the ambience of the rooftop is endearing. Service quality is fluctuating, sometimes seems pretty good (to the service provider taking care of our table), other times pretty nonchalant (what can you say when you are given the feedback page to comment on the various aspects of the place , yet no pen to write with....most good places provide you the pen too). I would say forgetful service at the end. The absolutely top places take care of the minutest details. The food was good...although I believe the Chicken Breast steak could 've been a little more on the softer side. The Big Porky was good. The Feisty chicken was good too. A mixed bag, I would say (with more pleasant experiences rather than the not so pleasant ones). Will be back to try out the other stuff in the menu.

I went to this place unexpectedly and I was glad I did. I ordered the Tenderloin Steak & The Jacobean Beef Burger with extra bacon. They were both a treat for my taste buds. The beef patty was extremely juicy and the extra strips of bacon made it taste much better, I did feel a bit of cheese was needed though. 
This was my first time having a proper steak and this place has set some high standards for other places to live up to, it was cooked medium-rare and the sauces were just amazing, I wanted more and more.
So, if you're a meat lover like me, definitely visit this place!

Wise Owl has become a favourite place among youngsters to hang out with their friends. However, being a cafe, it has a limited menu and no scope for dining. So, the owners decided to go for a steakhouse, located right on top of the main Cafe. 

The idea of a rooftop Cafe is indeed brilliant, even though the surroundings do not offer much of a view. It is especially beautiful at night, with beautiful lights adorning the sides of the terrace, and lamps hanging down on each table from above. The kitchen is located at the other end, and you are entitled to have your private moments in the serene place. The entire thing seems extremely romantic and beautiful unless the food arrives. Even though they get nearly full marks for the ambiance, they really have to improve the quality of the food they serve. Here goes my order:

Appetiser:
1. Chicken Croquettes(I am not 100% sure if I ordered this one only, since am writing the review after a gap of 3-4 months, but I think the name was this only) : This tasted like the usual fried chicken nuggets in a larger size, with a crispy outer coat and soft chicken inside, with the accompanying mayo. 

Main Course:
1. Tenderloin Steak: I had ordered it to be Medium Steaked and a little bloody. However, I felt it wasn't done properly, and remained chewy. As a result, I could barely enjoy it. 

2. BBQ Pork Rib: We started having this after the tenderloin, and it had become a little cold. Consequently, it was extremely difficult to cut it, as it had become too hard to eat. We asked them for a change, and the chef offered to toss it again and serve us. However, in spite of that, the dish wasn't really impressive, with a little too salty. Also, it was too dry and the Iced tea we took alongside didn't help much. 

Desserts: 
1. Caramel Custard: There's nothing to say really about this. This is pretty much the usual. Even though they have a couple more, they weren't available that day, and hence we had to settle for this.

I came here with my wife and ordered a Chicken steak and Chicken Cajun Pizza. Chicken Steak was absolutely below average. I wonder how this restaurant is so overrated. The worst was still awaiting us in form of the pizza. It was served to us after 40 mins (no exaggeration) and was the saltiest pizza I ever had in my life. My first and last visit to this restaurant. Not recommended to anyone.

Great ambience with dim romantic lights and open air seating on the roof. Not so much impressed with the food, however. We had ordered the Tenderloin Steak, the Rib eye Steak and the Calcutta Special Steak. We had asked for medium but the meat was very chewy, so that was a disappointment. Would like to go back for the ambience and maybe order something else the next time.

First and foremost, the quaint location of the restaurant (close to the main road but a little inside in a residential area) adds to it's advantage. The rooftop ambience along with the quintessential quietness of an urban residential area results in a cosy experience for diners. We found a table for two on Christmas evening without having to wait so that just makes the restaurant more appealing to us. It's perfect for a first date. 
Unlike what I heard, service is quick. We were served our medium rare sirloin steak cooked to order within just fifteen minutes. The mushroom and crème sauce and red wine sauce comes highly recommended. I have a peculiar milk allergy that gets activated only on consumption of liquid milk that comes straight from the cow. This confirmed my belief, that their milk based sauces are cooked using proper liquid milk. While that may sound like a negative, it is not. It's actually a genuine compliment because most restaurants cook milk based sauces using evaporated milk, thereby cutting down on production costs and compromising on texture and taste. My pre-assumption that they would do the same is entirely my mistake and not a reflection on the quality of food that the restaurant serves. On the contrary, in the eyes of a food lover like me, it comes as a pleasant surprise. (So lactose intolerant individuals should stick to the other sauces offered and should definitely clarify if the sauce is milk based or not. Don't make a wrong choice and then blame the restaurant. They aren't supposed to know of your food allergies).
And honestly, cooking medium rare beef sirloin is difficult and they nailed it. A must visit. 
I rate it 4.5/5

If you have time in your hand ---- then this is the place for you !! Very cosy ambience with the wooden tables which are not very close together. We had chicken keiv, chicken sizzler and pasta. Chicken was tender but very few variety of vegetables in the sizzler and keiv. Service is slow too. But the good food and ambience covers up the flaw in service.

This rooftop restaurant really looks nice with wooden decors and pretty lights.
But the service is totally sluggish here.😞
The food quality is good which just compensated the delay in serving it.
We had Bolgeian chicken penne pasta and the fish fillet steak.
The food is certainly lip smacking. 😍
Drinks variety is less in their steakhouse.✌

I am giving this restaurant a rating because there is no provision of negative rating. This is a horrible place to eat. Ambiance or service does not matter if the food is bad. And here not only food is bad, it is actually disgusting. We ordered one barbeque pork rib steak and chicken sizzler. In the pork rib , 80% was fat,  meat was like 20%. Yes, you read that right. They actually served that horrible food there. And the chicken sizzler was no better. All in all food was completely disgusting. It was a total waste of money. I am never going there again and I suggest you don't also because food in kolkata is quite tasty which you will not find in that horrible place.

Longed for it and made it finally. Those in the neighbourhood appears at a distance I guess. This was on a September evening yet we decided to seat in the opens bearing the sultry weather for the love of steak. The place is quiet with lights that could have been a bit softer. Ambience was perfect and would be excellent during chilly winter evening. I wish they served beers or wine which usually is paired with steaks world over. We settled for chicken hamburger steak and had a piping hot cream of chicken soup. The steak was well done. Food quality, quantity and appearance was all very good. It's definitely a recommended joint for steak lovers.

Located on Purna Das Road, this is a good place to have food. The wooden chairs, open roof restaurant serves good food. We had for entrée BBQ chicken wings which were succulent and tasty. The sauce or the glaze was itself very delicious. For main course, we had The Calcutta Special Steak which is a actually a beef steak with masted potatoes, sauté veggies and a poached egg. It tasted good but since I am not much of a beef lover, hence according to me, the beef is still hard and difficult to cut. We had Penn and Cheese Pasta which is actually pasta done in white sauce and pieces of chicken added. This is was quite tasty and one if the best pasts preparation, I have had till now done in white sauce. . The only thing I did not like about is, they serve their entrée and main course together. As a result, by the time we finished our entrée, our main course dishes had already gone cold. As a whole, it's a nice place to visit and I would surely like to visit again, someday.

I had the world's worst burger the big porky more like miniature and  salty , a really chewy sizzler and over fried crumb covering an undermarinated beast of chicken,  namely, the chicken Ala Kiev. 
The positive 's were :
 the tomato sauce and the tobasco.  The beans and carrots were also very nice. I'd love to try the water next time. Service was good.

First word that comes to my mind - cosy. Wise Owl is a perennial hangout of my mine  , and it never gets old. Situated in the residential leafy bylanes of Purna Das Road , it's reminiscent of any European bistro. I especially love two items served here : Fish and Chips as well as the Chicken wings. The ambience makes it really special , no wonder it's filled with the millenial crowd. A perfect comfort joint :)

Wonderful ambience is the first thing that strikes the mind. The entry looks like some cafe from Paris. The rooftop is well decorated with nice view of the surroundings and dim lighting. The service provided is great. Seatings are comfy. Coming to the food, we ordered beef steak in wine sauce, pork ribs in bbq sauce,fresh lime soda. The food wasn't that great and totally not worth the price. Was a bit disappointed from that aspect. Otherwise they provide a wide range of menu to choose from. Will recommend the place for its ambience.

Clean eating. The food was great especially the cordial behaviour of the staffs. Presentation was pretty good. The steaks of the place is highly recommended especially their calcutta special beef stick.. served with poached egg and seasoned vegetables. If crazy for cheese  one can definitely try the combination of pastas and pizzas. Mine cheese penne pasta was lip smacking toppes with parsley.. overall great food.. open air ambience.. but don't try the place during scorching summers i would suggest.. i would surely give it a second try for the steaks

The service is really good but not everything that is on the menu card are worth it. We tried the pepperoni pizza and it wasn't anything great. The burgers,(not in picture) however, are pretty decent. They do not use the regular, dry patty in the burgers but they cook the minced chicken in BBQ sauce and use that for the burger filling. The tax is a little over the top though.

Do you want to test how strong your teeth are, how tough your jaws are?? Is your love for meat greater than personal comfort?? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you must visit the WiseOwl Steakhouse..located close to Vivekananda Park, just above the WiseOwl Cafe, this place boasts the biggest steak in the market, a massive T-bone steak, costing 700 bucks..me and a few friends decided to try this place out, and needless to say, were very disappointed.. it is a rooftop restaurant, so the view from the top is nice, but the fans:tables ratio needs to be improved drastically..on top of that, the electricity went out for a good 20 minutes, and without any arrangement of a generator, we were left to sweat in the heat of the afternoon..anyway..

Now let's come to the food..starters, we ordered barbeque chicken, chicken nuggets, and beer battered prawns..nothing extraordinary about them, though I must mention that the prawns were among the best dishes of the day.. now the mains: Calcutta Steak, Ribeye, the famous T -bone , Pork Chops and a Jacobean burger..Jacobean burger coz it is what we were called at school, Jacobeans..anyway, as it turned out, my burger was the saving grace of the day..the Calcutta steak was miniscule for one person, the Ribeye and T-bone were so chewy that one of us just gave up trying to eat altogether..also here i must mention tha T when one orders a T-bone, it should be presented nicely, with the bone!! Not here, where they took the extra trouble of cutting it for us 😵.. simply spoilt the fun of having this humongous steak..and they also managed to make the Pork ribs chewy!! How, i wonder..
Finally we reached dessert..caramel custard and ice cream with chocolate was on the menu..thankfully the caramel custard didi not disappoint, but the vanilla ice cream surely had water in it, it was not the consistency that ice cream has..all if this and then the bill came to 4000+ for 5 people..not worth it, i feel.. i think places like #Steak Factory seem to be a  better option for people wanting to have a good steak in Kolkata..
Don't know if I shall visit again..

I checked into this place in a haste but also with high expectations from the menu card. The steakhouse is located on the terrace of the building and its nice to visit on a windy evening, not on sultry or rainy days. 
Although the staff is quite well behaved and orderly, there was a slight mix-up with the orders. 
The pasta was good enough, but the biggest disappointment was the Pork Chops. The meat was raw and very much undercooked and not at all close to tasty. The price is low yes, but that is no reason to serve undercooked stuff. So all in all, WSO did not live up to my expectations and i would be happy if the restaurant managers look into the issue i pointed out. I saw many others facing the similar problems. Thanks.

So yesterday I went to this place with two of my friends and here's what happened :
We ordered one BBQ pork ribs and one Rib Eye Steak. When we started having the Rib Eye Steak(Beef) the first two-three pieces were decent, but then when I had the fourth piece, I almost felt like throwing up because of the extremely weird taste. When we examined the remaining two pieces, we noticed drops of blood with the meat and the bone, it was raw, and not cooked properly(you can see that in the picture, sorry for the poor lighting) and that's how they served the dish.

Then when we called for the manager and informed them about the situation, they were very reluctant about it and initially didn't believe that it was blood, then after the initial argument one waiter came and said sorry sir, maybe the upper portion of the bone was not cooked properly that's why the blood is there.

Seriously?
First of all you don't cook the meat properly before serving it, and even when we could clearly see the blood drops they were still acting as if it's a very minor thing and there's no issue with it.

Extremely disappointed with the service, I will suggest people to avoid this place if you really don't want to fall sick and feel disgusted after having raw meat.
Learn to take your customers seriously.

I have visited this place situated at the roof of wise owl cafe in Hindustan park about two times now and both these times I had a great gastronomic experience. Although the service is slow the food is worth the wait especially if you are a meat lover. The chunky burgers are worth a try and so are steaks. However the best I have had here are the pork chops and the Calcutta style steak (beef), they are delicious and gorgeously brought in a platter. The pizza and pastas are good too but the burgers and steaks are a must try.

Got a gift voucher from Zomato for this place... Thanks zomato and Samridhi for the voucher... it's is situated on the top floor of Wise owl restaurant... the all wooden deco with hanging lights given it a perfect steak house ambience... Staffs are very courteous... service was bit lagging... whatever I tried there...
★ Cold coffee»»» very ordinary...
♡ Cheese garlic bread»»» Awesome...
♡ Russian salad»»» Very good...
♡ Pork chops»»» Also very good... but I found it to be bit sweet...
Also they served me a complimentary milk shake...
♡ Banana caramel»»» Excellent...
A very good experience over here... recommended to all... Pocket pinch was bit on the higher side...

Heaven if I may say.

My most fav food joint.
It's rooftop and the furnishing goes with the food they serve.

Pork Chops are savage.
So are the steaks.

The sizzler was at par.

It is quiet coz the humdrum is concentrated in the cafe below...great place to spend some leisure time.

Please do visit.

Visited their  SteakHouse roof top restaurant located on the 5th floor. Ordered Calcutta Steak Tenderloin served with poached egg, veggies and smashed potato. The steak sauce was a a bit blunt in taste , but the steak itself was very temder and juicy from inside. The cucumber mojito tried for the first time was yummy. Sevrice and ambience is okay. They took too long to serve the steak on the table. Bcoz this an open roof top without air conditioner , its not airy - bit hot.

I had been wanting to visit this place for  a long time as I had heard about it a lot from friends. The place itself is pretty great. The open air seating, wooden tables and soft lighting is something that I personally love. The food is good but not great. I had pork ribs, and it was not exactly as I had expected. It lacked the charred smoky flavor and was oozing with sauces, and was a little too salty for my liking. My friend had the tenderloin steak which he said was good, but a tiny bit overcooked. I would like to visit this place once more though as I really like the ambiance and the service.

Order- Greek salad,hot chocolate,mushroom caps
I went with my sister.The place seemed different than when I last visited.The chocolate shake was good.Tge mushroom caps were yummy( cheese and mushroom combo is my forever fav).The moment u take that mushroom cap filled with cheese and a lil spring onion in your mouth it's just supper yummy.The Greek salad was plain basic though.Nothing great.The garnishing was also very simple with no special flavours.Will never order again.They have outside seating in open too which is a nice feel than the always Ac packed and decked cafes and restaurants.Can give it a try, one will enjoy

The Wise Owl Steakhouse, I must say,  has a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The waiters and even the manager himself showed our family such honest and warm hospitality. The architecture on the rooftop was truly a beauty. The wooden tables and chairs gave off a Spanish feel.  The timing of the arrival of the food was fairly good. We had the Chicken Cream soup as our entree along with Garlic Cheese bRead and Plain Garlic Bread. The two breads were simply scrumptious but the soup wasn't as good as the bread. Their seasoning wasn't even and it didn't really wow your tasted buds. Moving onto the main course, The Fish Fillet Steak was a complete delight. Most restraunts do not pay any heed to the plating of food, but The Wise Owl did, the plating was stunning. The Fish Fillet softly melted into our mouths and it truly was something to eat over and over again. We also had the Beef Steak which was cooked in Red Wine along with vegetables and mash potato. Unfortunately, the quality of the beef was very poor. We asked for a medium but we received a medium rare. It was hard to cut in and we had to saw through the steak for the first the minutes. It was like working out for our fingers. It was quite a disappointment as the Fish Fillet Steak was really a wowing plate. Overall, we felt like eating at home was better than coming here.

Order- Greek salad,hot chocolate,mushroom caps
I went with my sister.The place seemed different than when I last visited.The chocolate shake was good.Tge mushroom caps were yummy( cheese and mushroom combo is my forever fav).The moment u take that mushroom cap filled with cheese and a lil spring onion in your mouth it's just supper yummy.The Greek salad was plain basic though.Nothing great.The garnishing was also very simple with no special flavours.Will never order again.They have outside seating in open too which is a nice feel than the always Ac packed and decked cafes and restaurants.Can give it a try, one will enjoy

The Wise Owl Steakhouse, I must say,  has a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The waiters and even the manager himself showed our family such honest and warm hospitality. The architecture on the rooftop was truly a beauty. The wooden tables and chairs gave off a Spanish feel.  The timing of the arrival of the food was fairly good. We had the Chicken Cream soup as our entree along with Garlic Cheese bRead and Plain Garlic Bread. The two breads were simply scrumptious but the soup wasn't as good as the bread. Their seasoning wasn't even and it didn't really wow your tasted buds. Moving onto the main course, The Fish Fillet Steak was a complete delight. Most restraunts do not pay any heed to the plating of food, but The Wise Owl did, the plating was stunning. The Fish Fillet softly melted into our mouths and it truly was something to eat over and over again. We also had the Beef Steak which was cooked in Red Wine along with vegetables and mash potato. Unfortunately, the quality of the beef was very poor. We asked for a medium but we received a medium rare. It was hard to cut in and we had to saw through the steak for the first the minutes. It was like working out for our fingers. It was quite a disappointment as the Fish Fillet Steak was really a wowing plate. Overall, we felt like eating at home was better than coming here.

When the Wise Owl Steakhouse opened its gates I was as excited as any other foodie. A steakhouse at a walking distance from home seemed too good to be true. Since then I have been there several times, but never reviewed it for some reason. The first time I bit into their little hog burger, a little liquid spluttered out from the other side. I know that sounds disgusting, but it gives you an idea how soft, tender and juicy their burgers are. Their barbeque pork ribs are a heart attack served on a platter- but like all fattening food- oh so tasty! It has a layer of meat with an equally thick layer of fat cooked in delicious barbeque sauce. In fact, I am yet to taste something that I do not like in this restaurant. The grilled chicken breast and the ala kiev are also worth trying. The mashed potato that accompanies these dishes is made to perfection, however the lettuce in their salads is sometimes a little bitter.
The open air seating and the wonderful service just adds to the charm. It is moderately expensive but totally worth the price.

i have regularly visited the wise owl during breakfast and is impressed with the management. yester-night was my first visit to the stake-house which is located on the rooftop. the decor and ambiance is minimal what with its wooden tables & chairs. thoughtfully, they have charging points for cellphones/laptops which most places don't offer. the rooftop arrangement is sprawling and the aisle generous for passing by without tripping on other customers.

I had initially ordered for fish n chips - the fish used for this specific dish was bassa. [over a period of years i have realized that there's nothing to substitute for the taste of bhetki. however, more and more people are shifting towards bassa mainly for the ease of pre-cooking: less time for marination, bassa rarely emanates any foul smell, one doesn't have to be extremely careful during its marination, there's not much bones hence making fillets are easier. bassa is an ideal fish for those who are short-changed for time not for the real connoisseurs, period!]. there were two medium sized portions of deep fried fish on a bed of potato wedges. i wasn't very happy since i have had better fish n chips elsewhere. this was way too oily both visually and for my taste buds.

the dish that floored me was their rib-eye beef steak [at this point, without sounding condescending to my readers, the correct pronunciation is NOT as in STICK but as in STAKE]. they have a whole lot of options to choose from for their grilling process - medium, medium light, medium rare. since i wanted my meat to be juicy and soft the one taking the order suggested that i go for the medium-rare as against well-cooked which is what i had in mind. i opted for the pepper sauce.
what appeared before me was an absolute delight replete with rectangular cut pieces of the meat arranged stylistically along with a huge bone laden with meat on a bed of mashed potatoes and pan-tossed vegetables[beans, carrots etc]. this i downed with fresh lime salted which was followed by cold coffee.

the only thing missing might have been some soft music [which nevertheless i didn't miss since i had been carrying my own obsolete ipod] and an option for air-conditioned space since in recent times the weather is quite humid and sultry. the price though slightly high from the kolkata point of view is still reasonable from a delhiite's perspective. this place should be a case-study for upcoming delhi restaurants of similar genre - how to serve excellent food while maintaining  a fantastic service without charging a bomb!

Ambiance - Rooftop. Open air. Seating could have been a little more comfortable . 

Service- Average. Nothing exceptional.

Food - we had a fresh lime soda. Sweet was ordered but we received salty. They offered a change but we didn't want a replacement. 
Beer battered prawns-right amount of crisp and crunch. But extremely greasy. Could have been less. 
Chicken Ala Kiev - Stuffed with mashed potatoes and veggies , good try to match upto the traditional dish . 

Chicken Breast Steak - Nicely grilled. But the pieces were too chewy. 

Being a steakhouse , should have a little more options of them. We are not the red meat fanatics so the choices were too less. 

Overall - recommended only if you want a little privacy with a rooftop view of the Hindustan Park skyline as it's mostly empty.

I had hear a lot of chatter about the place and mostly good things, but frankly was really disappointed when  I actually visited the place. Despite of being the only customers there the server took approximately 30 to 35 minutes to get our food. We had ordered two dishes the pork ribs and the fiesty chicken burger with a fired egg. The pork ribs were undercooked , a bit raw and extra chewy. On the other hand the chicken patty wasn't fresh and was frankly not chewable. The chicken patty was very hard and ultimately we weren't able to finish either of the dishes. All in all expect the ambience, the place over all failed to impress. The food was a utter disappointment.

Was with 3 friends at the Wise Owl Cafe. Suddenly the temptation of having a steak and pork ribs crossed everyone's mind and we ready jumped on to the train. Initially thought of going to steak factory but 'the wise Owls' were just too lazy and so we decided to give Wise Owls steakhouse a try. The décor was nothing great, just normal wooden chair and tables. The first shocker came in the form that the steak house doesn't have Pork ribs. Second came when the fish and chips was served. A kind of fish butter fry (extremely oily) and normal potato fry (oily again) was served as "Fish and Chips". I believe the management and the chef needs to taste fish and chips first before attempting to prepare the same. The Kolkata special beef steak and the pasta was ok in taste but compared to the price the portions were not that great. I would say go here at your own risk. I would go here again if all the other restaurants in Kolkata are closed (including the roadside ones). Sadly disappointed.

Came for a quick bite one Monday evening, no table was occupied on this terrace restaurant while ground floor was buzzing with people. As I had a cold, ordered a chicken sweet corn soup and chicken a-la-kiev. Well the soup was just hot enough to soothe my cold throat, taste wise bad as we could taste cornflour. The other dish was nice crisp fried batter chicken served with creamy mashed potato and cabbage n cherry tomatoes, flavor was great. Though only fans were there and seating was basic wood furniture, since it was evening and not too unbearable hot, we could stick around and have a nice time. Service was ok.

We had been there just two days back. We went in a group of four n had ordered chicken steak which was too tough n very disappointing the portion size is too small. We had ordered the beef tenderloin which we had mentioned to prepared medium but that too was way over cooked.the pork chops with over an inch thickness of fat was OK ...they dint have any desert option other than ice cream.However the cucumber mojito n virgin mojito was refreshing...the ambience is good but service very slow...not going back...

Visited this place today. Loved the ambience of this place. Ordered ice cream soda, iced tea, some fried chicken strips and pork sausages. The food was excellent except for the pork sausages. It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes, which was completely blant. The brown sauce which coated the sausages was too bad in taste. Would recommend visiting this place again but to choose the items carefully as not all the items are good to eat. The service is a bit slow, so please be patient after ordering.

Visited the steakhouse for the first time. Rooftop setting with a great view and amazing atmosphere. Very relaxed and languid. Had the meat lovers pizza, BBQ chicken wings and cheese garlic bread. 
Pizza was filled with toppings which actually made picking up the thin crust slices hard, but you won't hear me complaining. Only problem was service took quite some time, so if you're extremely hungry, it might test your patience.
Chicken wings were tangy and delicious. 
And can't go wrong with garlic bread. Overall, we had a delicious meal at The Steakhouse. Will be back soon.

Yesterday, had my first tryst with this place with some of my friends. The experience was disturbing. After an okayish spell of iced tea/mojito... ordered calcutta spl. beef steak and pork chops. The beef was way overcooked, the knife did nt go through..the pork chops had this grave layer of fat attached to it tasting like grease... had to discard a fair portion.. reported this to the manager who listened to the brief with a deadpan face. Not going there again. Utterly disgusting .

I wanted to visit this place for so long. Finally could visit here one afternoon. This is a rooftop open-air restaurant located on top of the wise owl coffee shop. 
I liked the ambience as the weather was good. However during the hot summer days of Kolkata I don't know how comfortable this place will be. 
Coming to food.
We ordered banana caramel shake and fresh lime soda.To our surprise  Both of them were served at room temperature to us.So we had to ask them to add ice.
Next we ordered the chicken steak and the pork tenderloin steak.
I was literally craving for the pork steak .
But the steak they served us was extremely dry.
I had to ask them to add more sauce to it,to which they gave us a tartar sauce which did not go well with my steak at all. Obviously because it was not the sauce used in the steak.
The chicken steak was fine.
I had really high expectations from this place but I have to say I was rather disappointed! :(

Heard a lot about this place - especially was recommended by friends as the best place to go to for a good steak in Kolkata. But had a horrible experience when we went for a family meal last evening.  The menu has 5 kinds of steak on the menu but only one portion of one variety (T bone steak);and one other variety (rib eye) was available on a Friday evening with only two other small group of diners present. The food arrived after 1 hour and the meat was just unsuitable for human consumption - it was so tough that it was not possible to eat by average human being. The T bone steak has two pieces - ordered medium rare - and only one piece was edible - and tasted like a nice steak should- the other was almost tough fibrous raw meat. The rib eye steaks were just as bad - so for 4 portions ordered only half a portion was possible to be eaten. When the variance in preparation was pointed out the staff there just kept looking with vacant faces and didn't even offer an apology - forget aboit a discount. It appeared that there were only junior waiters with no one in charge. We paid 3000/- Rs and could eat only the mashed potatoes accompanying the steak. Just brought the remaining meat in a plastic bag and distributed it amongst street dogs in my neighbourhood on returning and had a magi before retiring. Either the chef or management has changed or they can't bother - from the quality of the only edible piece of steak it would appear that if they try properly they can make a good steak, but good reviews have gone to their head. Sheer waste of time and money!

The name of the joint is really cool. Kinda raises your expectations sky high. I felt like I am going to
find my meat craving Nirvana here. But I had a very bad experience. People like me who love good food, don't mind the money if the food is really good (even if almost good). I had ordered bacon to start with. Just plain bacon. My bacon arrived quick, but was underdone. It was far from crunchy, but I forgave that. I will call it a decent attempt, though the shredded mint leaves in the garnish were not fresh and had stains. Next up on order was 'Pork chops' and this is where the horror starts. The pieces had half of them as thick pig fat. A little fat is necessary for it to taste good, understood. But it was a fatty nightmare on my plate. Now I didn't know how to eat it, and I couldn't. The total bill was about Rs 800, including the price of two glasses of soda (I tried to eat the mess and help it down with the fizz of soda, hence two glasses). The dollops of pig fat stared at me and mocked. All in all, the Owl has flown away with all the wisdom. And I had to go to a Chinese restaurant to "eat".  I won't recommend this place. Not going back in there.

The setup is ideal. The terrace is well utilised. The rustic bare bone furniture are an absolute fit. The menu is stunning. As the name suggests it has every variations in steaks. So you can choose the portion of the meat as well as the preparation level. The food is good, but could have been better. I have serious questions about the hygiene. My Caesar salad was decorated with dead red ants. I brought this to their notice but with not much effect. My smartphone was not smart enough to zoom into the ants, so you would find the pictures gorgeous.
I still rate it generously, and that's because I hope they improve the next time I go. The place definitely has the potential, and if it meets with the proper intention from the management then we have a winner over here.
Steakhouse, I hope you are listening.

I just love this place. Its my comfort zone.
A proper steakhouse, which is a break from Kolkata's love for Chinese and Indian food joints (not that any love lost between me and them), but its was a great move, great concept and well executed. 

I go in to get my fix of great meat and a nice dose of calories (worth it).

The location is awesome, the open air with wooden themes, along with surrounding greenery makes it a whole experience.

I suggest the Porky burgers (don't hold back from the extra bacon) and the chicken ala Kiev (served in an unusual but bloody good manner).

And note, be ready for a bit of a wait time, making this food isn't a quick job, but the patience usually pays off.

I was pretty excited to go to wise owl.. i went their yesterday. Ambience was very good.We did not order much only cold coffee, sausages and chicken sandwich. Chicken sandwich was very bad, you can hardly find chicken,tasteless, highly priced without any reason.Other things were so so. It utterly@ failed to satisfy me. They should change their chicken sandwich preparation!!!!! My rating only for ambience not for food......

Phewwwwwww! My exams got over finally and I can write fully loaded reviews as I wish to with pictures and a detailed description, not writing by finding things from the memory lane.
We had plans for going somewhere else. On reaching there, the place was found to be closed. Hence we landed up here.
The Wise Owl Steakhouse is a nice rooftop restaurant on the top of Wise Owl Coffee Shop, or the 66/2B Guest House. It was easy to locate the place.
It was so windy yesterday. The weather was perfect to enjoy a rooftop evening course. It felt so perfect to be there.
Wooden chairs, the view everything made things more perfect. We snuggled up in a corner table. It was 5 in the evening. We were the only one to be present there.
Batter Fried Prawns and Pork Chops with Wilted Greens and Mash were what we ordered along with a Caramel Custard.
The battery fried prawns, five in a portion, medium sized prawns were very good. They served tartar sauce with it. But I think a sweet chilli sauce or tomato ketchup would have gone better with it.
Pork Chops were thick and succulent. Too delicious to devour after you have missed outside food for a month almost. It was sauteed with a sweet kinda sauce on top and the mash was cheesy and delicious too! The veggies were a little undercooked. One more thing that I have to say, the fatty part is more than the meat part. I am a big lover of pork fat, still it gave me a nauseating feeling at the end. So, they should look after this.
For desserts, came in the caramel custard. It was soft, yummy and made perfectly balanced with the tinge of caramel syrup and the custard.
Staff behaviour was good. They were courteous. Suggested us properly and came in eagerly whenever asked for help. As we were the only ones to be present there, we wouldn't have liked anyone standing by our table. That would surely have hampered our privacy. They came in right there just when called for and helped us out.
The overall experience was good apart from the pork fat thing. I specially loved the ambiance. It was windy outside, no need of aircondition and almost perfect food on your table to enjoy a beautiful evening date. Loved the place. Will be coming back soon sometime. Have got to try the Jacobean Burger and all. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

No doubt the best steak house in Kolkata. Every thing was super fresh and cooked to order. The steak was perfectly juicy and tender and the veggies crunchy. Their spaghetti bolognese deserves an award and even the Caesar salad is bomb. Nice relaxed ambience to round it out. This restaurant has no competition in Kolkata.

The ambience is awesome. Really takes the edge of the week when i visited this weekend. But to my disappointment the t-bone steak didnt live upto its reputation. However the sir-loin steak was pretty damn good. Didnt get to try out much but 1 piece of advice: "before ordering the steak hear out the different types of preparation they have(nearly 10 types) for each steak. If u dont understand their preparation then describe to them how u like it in your own way and let them handle it from there".... dont go for rare steaks(unless u r a vamp) 😉

Nothing extra ordinary about the ambiance. It is very evident that the management did not lay much emphasis on the decor. The menu is just a normal print out on A4 sheets clipped into a exam clipboard. The food is good. My personal favourite is the pork chops. Their chicken steak is very ordinary. May go there again to try the others dishes

Sprawling, spacious and sunny !

Well, the biggest mistake that one could've made was to visit this outlet on a hot. sultry, Sunday summer afternoon. 

But that was our bad.

Talking about the place, the service was good. The food, overrated; it was good but I didn't find it worth the hype.

We had ordered California Crumb Fish (280 INR), it had 5 pieces of bonelss fish in crust. And, Chicken Breast steak, which I found thoroughly overpriced given that we were provided just one chicken breast piece. 

We had taken sweet lime soda(90 INR), which was very refreshing and soothing to our senses and coke(70 INR).

The bill for two came to 905 INR, including VAT.

In a nutshell, the place was just okay. I was not unhappy with the first visit, but would probably not consider paying this another visit.

The place has a really cool name and the ambience on the roof top is pretty alluring! I ordered Chicken Steak which was not at all upto the mark, the chicken portion was succulent but the mashed potato was rather tasteless! Overall I didn't like the food and pretty expensive as compared to the food served.

Steakhouses being not so common in this part of the country, people tend to misjudge and misread these places, their charm and their offerings. These rustic heavens for meat lovers are rare in the culinary landscapes of Kolkata that used to revolve around Indianized Chinese, North Indian, basic South Indian, Mughlai, and west Bengali cuisines until the recent gastronomic revolution that is sweeping the city for good. Steakhouses or chophouses are eateries that specialize in serving individual portions of meats, primarily beef steaks that are served along with sides like mashed potato, sautéed veggies, baked potatoes, etc. Most steakhouses also offer other cuts of meat as well such as roast prime rib, veal, etc.  

If we go by history, then these steakhouses date back to London in 1690s, serving individual portions of meat called chops. These places were in general open only for men. Then the steakhouses started in the US in late 19th century near New York in addition to the existing bars, motels and Inns. And now Americans flock to these places, whether they are expensive chains or a local joint whose décor hasn’t changed since the Progressive movements of late 19th century :) Whatever the case maybe, steaks are a happening thing and an institution in the US. Chophouses also started serving diversified food items apart from beef steaks, like pork chops, lamb kidneys, strips of beacon, baked potatoes, apple pies, etc. 

Anyway, coming back to Kolkata, our very own laid back city of joy got its first chophouse that was so unlike the restaurants spread across the city. Wise Owl Steakhouse is the palace of meat we are talking about. The place is located on Purna Das Road just above the Wise Owl café which has earned goodwill in last few years. When you are approaching from Gariahat you need to take left near the Triangular park where you will find the Raymond’s showroom to get into this Purna Das Road. You can park your car easily in front of the Wise Owl café on the street, but not for free :). You need to walk past the café and take the lift to reach the top floor, and then you need to take the stairs to get to the roof to check-in to this western country looking steakhouse. 

The ambiance is surely out of the box when compared to other Kolkata eating joints, but very apt and common when we think about chophouses. It is open air, covered on top with asbestos, with wooden flooring and trademark rustic coarse-looking wooden chairs and tables with planks clearly visible giving that vintage artsy look. The overall ambiance is very close to a country ranch eating joint with the woody warmth filled in all the nooks and corners. But this ambiance reminds me of beer gardens and it’s a pity that you won’t get beer with your steak here (it was not available at least when we were here), that’s mainly because of a school which is there beside this property. The music which is being played is also perfect, mainly they were playing John Meyer when I was here for the lunch. All in all, the ambiance created with these custom-crafted furniture, wooden flooring, open kiss of the humid city air (!) and mostly western country songs give the right kick to dig in to your favorite piece of meat with some not-so-hard aerated drinks to go with. 

Now, coming to the crux of the matter – lets discuss about the food and beverage. To start with I quite liked the clipboard menu, kinda felt tensed recollecting my school Exam days during this March-April period :) But when we opened the menu it was filled in with names and descriptions of lip smacking items. Out of those I ordered for: 

a)	Pork Chops

b)	Chicken Breast steak

c)	Sweet fresh lime soda

Well, let me be frank, the portion of the regular pork chops was huge! I really struggled to finish it off. These were real slow cooked pork chops, grilled to finish with mushroom and crème sauce spread all over it. I was pretty hungry when the food came in and with the first bite it felt that I was there at the right place at the right time. Though I was keen to hug the chef but I unconsciously went on to finish my meal :) The pork chops were served with butter-herb tossed veggies and mashed potato. Though I felt the mashed potato could have been creamier but anyway the entire dish was just close to perfection. The pork fat was served in generous quantity along with the meat, and the meat was not at all stiff and felt amazing to consume! If not melt-in-your-mouth type, but it was surely one dish I can recommend to others. From my past experience, I found that these are best done if use baby back or the usual pork ribs that will be tender and moist. Here also the dish was flavorful and the meat was moist to satiate my soul and my taste buds. Infact I ended up consuming a bit too much fat than I usually do since it had a smoky and that ‘cooked on the grill’ aroma. Not sure, but I guess the marination with the spice rub can be done taking a bit more time. Sautéed veggies served included tossed brocolli, beans, carrots, and babycorn which went well with the pork chops. Overall, I can safely go ahead to recommend this dish to pork lovers! The Chicken breast steak glazed with herb extracts, had the mushroom sauce served separately; the stake was done perfectly with the signature smoky aroma to the chicken that made things interesting. It tasted real good with the sautéed veggies and mashed potato. Overall the steak was firm yet juicy in the center with tender fibers. Though I felt the quantity could have been increased a bit. Overall a nice option if you are not in to try pork or beef. This visit of mine was kinda left mid-way since I couldn’t try the beef stake after all that hogging. Well now I needed some drink to wash down the stuffs and sweet lime soda with that correct amount of fizz did the trick (only one suggestion – please get the tough black straws).
                                          ...

I wanted to visit this place for quite some time. Finally managed it last week. The ambience is good, though it was pretty empty with only guests at 3 tables including us. It is basically a covered rooftop, very spacious and though it is vey hot now in Calcutta, it was windy in the evening. I initially thought that probably the heat deterred people from seating outside.

We ordered virgon and cucumber mojito and caeser salad to begin with. The mojitos were good and refreshing but the salad completely spoiled my mood. It had only leaves, and croutons loads of cheese and some salad dressing which was not remotely close to ceaser salad. And I say leaves because those were not lettuce. The salad was a big let down. We also ordered grilled prawns which were good, but arrived quite late.
For mains we had chicken steak and baked fish. The chicken steak with boiled veggies and mashed potatoes was OK. The fish steak was good but with it came lots and lots of lettuce (no mistake here) which was cooked and was tasteless. The proportion of fish to lettuce was 40:60. It could have been served with something else. Overall a very avergae experience. And after tasting the food it makes complete sense as to why this big place was so empty. Am not sure if I want to come back here again.

Food isn't good. The chicken was stiff and might even have been stale. Portions are very less (not even sufficient for one person). 

Ambience is really nice. Open room with nice music. 

Not going again though. 

Suggested - Improve the quality, serving time and the portions.

If you are a pork/beef lover and want to taste steak ,this is the perfect place for you.

We chose this place given the good reputation  'The Wise Owl'  has made. But hugely disappointed.  We ordered southern fried chicken,  fish and chips,  pork chops and tender loin steak with mushroom and creme sauce.  The taste was a huge let down except the tender loin steak.  But there are plenty of places in Kolkata who make better steaks.  None of the other dishes were special.  I would say it was pretty disappointing.  
I hope they improve.  Because  they have got a pretty promising menu.

And this was such an disappointing experience. Open air was what attracted me... Located right above the wise owl this place I thought would be good enough.  We called for fried fish, a thin fillet, loaded with breadcrumbs.... A chicken steak which was under done. The server seemed disinterested in our complains. We left the place,swearing to never come back.

Since my friend was obsessed to have Steak we decided to stop by this place on a Sunday evening. I was a bit confused to consider this place since its known for serving steak and would not be favourable enough for a vegetarian. 

Finally i took the gamble and we arrived at the roof top dining located on the top floor of "Wise Owl Cafe". Since its an open air dining restaurant visiting during summer afternoons should be avoided due to less efficient air circulation. It is spacious and accommodates around 30 people. The service is satisfactory since its not overcrowded like the cafe located in the basement.
As I hovered over the menu I could only see one or two vegetarian options available in each category. I was disappointed but considering the fact that it is a steakhouse, the veg options are expected to be slender. 

It took no time for my friend to order a Sirlion Steak for which she was craving for past few days while i had to spend time judiciously and finally order a Cottage Cheese Steak. Fresh Lime Soda and Cucumber Mojito were also ordered to kill time until the arrival of the dish.
The Steaks arrived with a decent presentation with two large pieces of Cottage Cheese along with boiled Brocolli, Babycorn, Beans, Carrots and mashed Potatoes for the sides. The dish looked quite promising and colourful. The cottage cheese was covered with a thick layer layer of sauce (I suppose barbeque or schezwan sauce). 
The dish was very good in taste beacause the sauce was able to curb away the bland taste of the cottage cheese. I liked the dish a lot and thankfully it was not as bad an experience a vegetarian would expect.
Unfortunately my friend did not have a pleasant experience with her Steak. To restore her mood we then proceeded to the cafe to try out the desserts.

P.s.:  4 points based on the food I tried but considering the fact that the place is known for its Non Veg Steak I would like to give it a 3.5.

I have always loved their ambience and have preferred the natural breeze at their rooftop to the cafe at the ground floor (which is hugely popular, no doubt). It seems to be getting more popular as I see more people ever time I go to the Steakhouse.

We were a group of three, tried out their Sizzler that has Chicken, prawns and sausages this time along with Chicken steak which amounted to be quite enough for three.
Have had their Pork chops earlier (tip- ask them to trim the fat). Food and presentation was great. We discovered to our joy they serve Icecream soda (yes, they still make those)!

Its a place to hangout, you can smoke too without inconvenience to others as its open air seating. 

Service is leisurely, be prepared. But goes with the mood of the place!

Located on top of Wise Owl, which happens to be a cafeteria, its sister venture, 'The Steak House' has really made its name by creating delicious steaks over the time. Situated on the rooftop of a building, this place offer comfort food within a solitude of peace and ease of mind.

Finding the place is very very easy. If you take the lane opposite to Basanti Devi College, walk straight till you come across Azad Hind Dhaba to your right. From there, take a right turn and keep walking straight. Wise Owl should be right in front of you. Be careful though, the ground floor is a simple cafeteria. To reach the rooftop, walk straight into the cafe till you reach the lift. Take the lift to the 3rd floor and then take the stairs to reach the rooftop.

As soon as you reach the rooftop, you would see wooden chairs and tables spread across a huge area. This restaurant has actually been setup on the rooftop of a building and hence is quite spacious. When I entered, the restaurant was almost vacant with just a few people indulged in their own personal talks. I grabbed up a chair and ordered for BBQ Pork ribs. This is where, the person attending to me suggested to go for Pork Chops, instead of ribs, to which I readily agreed. To quench my thirst, I ordered for a Banana Caramel Shake.

First came the shake. A huge glass, probably capable of holding 400 ml liquid filled up with banana and caramel shake was right infront the eyes. As I dug in the shake, it felt extremely relaxing. Thick smoothie with perfect balance of banana and caramel. The water content was very less and hence proved to be a perfect value for money. Unable to resist the temptation, I finished the entire shake even before the steak would arrive.

Succumbing to gluttony, I ordered for another one to be served along with the steak. The steak gradually came within the next 10-15 minutes. Two succulent portions of pork, served on a bed of mash and accompanied with certain veggies. The pork was extremely tender and not the hard chewy ones I usually find elsewhere. One of the two pieces had just the right alignment of fat and meat and it was extremely easy to cut down the meat along with the just amount of fat I would need to make the combination delightful.

The other piece, was a bit smaller in size and the structure was also a bit messy. I found it slightly difficult to handle the same and also the quality of the meat appeared to be below par when compared to the other one. Coming to the sauce, it was beautifully done. Although overtly sweet, it didn't actually hurt my tastebuds. Topped with apple cider, the combination of meat, fat, mash and apple cider created a holy alliance. Although, the hint of burnt chocolate was missing. Personally I would prefer the sauce to be less sweet, if I am talking from the point of view of a perfectionist, but then the entire thing wasn't that bad as well! The mash appeared under-salted and also devoid of any butter.

The main plus point of this restaurant is that it offers a smoking area. Once, I was done with my food and second round of shake, I didn't had to go down the life to the road to take a puff in order to calm myself. I politely asked for an ashtray and a small bucket sized ashtray was served. Even though, I was done with my meal, the waiters did not bother me nor did they barge on me with the final bill.

I appreciated this gesture comparing to the fact that is most of the restaurants you are handed over the bill even before you could finish your eating! Being a Non-AC restaurant, there isn't any Service Tax (No Service Charge either). The place offers an open area with cool breeze coming from all around you. This place needs some high standd pedestial fans to cope up with the heat as the ones placed on the ceiling are positioned erratically, and I felt it does not cover the entire area proportionately. 

I would certainly come back here again but then I would expect the quality to be slightly notched up by then as I can see multiple complains here i the Zomato page one after the other complaining of sauces overtly sweet and particularly some disappointing steaks! Also, the prices needs to go down slightly if one prefers to attract more customers!

The Wise Owl is one of the very famous restaurants in the South Kolkata. Rather I would call it a famous hangout place and café. On my visit, I totally found it to be a over hyped place. The sitting arrangement, the decoration, the service and whole lot of owls were really praiseworthy but then the food and the drinks that were served were pretty obvious and normal made ones but were over priced. They had this item named "Putin" which is really expensive but was basically a dish of French fries covered with a sauce consisting of shredded chicken.
So if you're not really interested to go there for the sake of the big name, this isn't really a recommendation.

As my friend and I scouted for a table that would have maximum exposure under a fan on the open rooftop on a sultry evening with inadequate air circulation, it took me no time to order a Sirloin steak, which has been on my wishlist for a while, with pepper sauce. The sauce was watery, and bland, and even when I had ordered for a medium rare, the meat was chewy, bland and not seasoned well. The side vegetables and mashed potato were just about average. Overall, a very disappointing dish !

The menu had few options for starters and salads, with the vegetarian option limited to about five dishes across all sections. My friend ordered a cottage cheese steak which was pretty good. The paneer was coated with an indian-chinese tasting sauce which my friend and I loved. Strange that my vegetarian friend

We Also ordered the Mixed Sizzler......Should Come with a sauce .....I asked for some sauce & was told there was an extra charge .....Fine......or else the Sizzler would be tasteless

This is a terrace-top restaurant modelled into a simple steak house, on a 3 storey building near Gariahat Triangular Park. The ground floor houses a confectionery-cum-cafe. One needs to walk right through, to the lift lobby to reach the steak house. The other floors contain rooms dedicated to the Wise Owl guest house. The steak house gets visitors mostly at lunch or dinner, when you need a sumptuous stomach-full.
I visited with my brother, he had his first steak here... And boy!! He loved it..! So did I. We ordered Sirloin steak, BBQ pork ribs and Chicken a-la-kieve. All the preparations were tasty to last morsel.. Grandly garnished with grilled vegetables, mashed potato and a (creme-mushroom) sauce of our choice. The bill was 1.3 K.
A few cons to note.. Serving time was 20 mins after placing the order. The beef was quite fibrous and difficult to knife-upon. The Pork did not have any additional garnishing with assorted vegetables or mash, unlike the others.
Otherwise I am just so happy that steaks are finally here in Kolkata. Keep up the good work.

The owner was an extremely friendly guy!!! He even sat down to have a chat and explain where the ''Wise Owl'' name came from. The staff was very attentive and service was good probably cause he was there.

Late evening a friend and me were in for something light, the Prawn Entrée was very appetizing and being a Xaverian I don’t know why I am saying this but the Jacobean Burger was quite exquisite. Topped up with the delightful ambiance of the open air of the roof top and the sylvan seating, it’s a must visit.

Still haven’t tried the steak yet but the experience definitely sets things in motion for a comeback.

Hopefully there will be some wine added to the menu.   

Strongly recommended for a late evening bite and conversation!

Sneaked inside on a Saturday afternoon after hearing some good reviews from friends. It's a rooftop joint with ample sitting arrangements. However it can be bit uncomfortable during the famous Calcuttan Summer. On the day I went a cool breeze was blowing though.
I tried the Chicken Breast Steak which was served with grilled baby corn, carrots, beans, broccoli & smashed potato. Taste was good. I plan to try out the actual beef steaks during the winters. Felt that the items are bit overpriced.

The music was good and played at a low enough volume to be heard. The menu had a great selection of meals at a reasonable cost. I can recommend the chicken patty burger and any of the salads as I ate there several times during my stay in Kolkata from the UK.

Very good food but their service is very slow, their pizzas are really good, but their service was drastic we waited their over 1/2 an hour for a coffee they need to improve that.

The reason I am giving 2.5 is because I liked the ambience,and the fact that you can sit there with your friends for a long time without disturbance,as the place is quite empty.
But,the most important part,the food is,well BAD.
We ordered the starter of fried fish medallions with parsley batter.A very very thin layer of fish between thick breadcrumb coating,which was falling off.no hint of parsley at all .fish was smelly,not fresh at all.Extremely disgusted.

Pork chop was tough and overcooked.Same with the chicken breast steak.The accompanying sauce was a bit sweet and quite tasteless.The chicken portion was also too less.They never asked for our opinion about how well cooked we wanted our steaks and brought them overdone.The best part was only the mashed potato.

For the quality of food,the prices seem exorbitant.no wonder the place was empty on a sunday evening.

Will I return?not anytime soon.I do not wish to waste my hard earned money.

Really chilled out roof top ambience, wooden furniture coupled with John Mayer music- totally works for me! Absolutely LOVED it. Tried the Beer Batter Prawns, which were heavenly, and the Jacobean junior Burger which was really delicious and nothing close to junior!! Great place, great food, good music, good vibes - definitely frequenting this place. Brownie points for plug points near the table.

Very few people know this place exists. This restaurant is based on the rooftop of #TheWiseOwl. U have to enter through The wise owl and take the lift to the 3rd floor and then the stairs to the rooftop. This place is mostly empty coz very few people are aware of this place. 
This is an open air rooftop restaurant with a rustic look which serves great steaks and burgers. 
However the ambience and food will reach another level if they start serving beer too :))

I truly dig this place. One of the few places in India that can really do a medium rare steak as well wiseowl. 'The Jacobean Burger' is a superlative to beef burgers anywhere. Also, the ambience coupled with some good ol rock and roll makes it unavoidable.  Your also likely spot some pretty ladies while your digging in 😊

I really do not know which part of the offering was not liked by the people to rate it so low in zomato. The food was yum.... The choices for a beverage, soups are very limited I agree... But it's very heavy. My suggestion would be to order in tranches and not all together.
There is no service charge which is a good thing.

I've been to this place twice. Very nice ambience - it's a rooftop restaurant in Purna Das road. The Wise Owl also houses a guest house that's quite popular among medium budget travellers. 

The steakhouse is quite enterprising - has continental dishes of various tastes - and I am really fond of Indian steakhouses that serve both pork & beef. You'd get your chicken a la kievs and pork ribs at one go. 

The beef steak is not out of the world, but then you can't blame them as Indian beef is bound to be fibrous. The pork is good, but the quality varied on our two visits. The last visit got us a slightly 'harder' variety of pork. 

Overall a great experience.

Since the time this steakhouse opened I have visited it four or five times. The food here is pretty good, mainly the steaks, the pork chops and the spare ribs. The quality of meat too has been consistently good. In short I love the pork and beef items (all the steak cuts.)

Ambiance here is always great. The terrace being breezy even a sultry summer evening doesn't feel as hot and humid as usual. The music too on most occasions is good and there is enough space in between the tables to carry on a good conversation. 
 
Their biggest drawback, each and every time for me, is their quality of service or lack thereof. The maître d' takes a really long time to even come and take the order. The food arrives on the table after almost 30minutes of placing the order. The last time I visited (Jan 2016) we had to wait for 75 minutes. No kidding.

The prices here are pretty reasonable given the quality of food they serve. I have rated it a 2/5 only because of their painfully slow service.

With open air seating the place promises a lot.Tried the Pork Rib Steak,the waiter forgot to ask our preference for meat and fat and what we got in return is a chunk of fat only.Very unattentive waiters.Yet to try out the rest of the menu,will surely give another chance to this place.

Fantabulous ambience with outstanding food in justified price. 

We had pork chops as baby ribs were finished, fish, chicken al a kieve, and burger. 
I expected the burger to be more juicy, still it was tasty.
Loved the place.
It was a wise choice to be in wise owl.

Visited the place for the 1st time and tried pork ribs. The portions were of were size with only 10 %meat and 90% fat. Now who pays that amount to eat fat. I think they should know which portion to be used for what. Very disappointed. Had gone there with high expectations. Another thing service is too bad. The waiters don't know what kind of knife to be given with a pork rib. More or less they told they usually ask what amount of fat is necessary to the customer. But they didn't utter a single word while taking the order. Bad experience.

The ambience is cool but the food sucks beyond comparison. Low quantities , shitty cooking, overpriced menu. I ordered pork ribs in BBQ sauce , the sauce was basically ketchup and oil of some sort. No flavour , nothing. The Bhetki was salty , the vegetables were under seasoned and dry and basically it was no good. I was so disappointed. :/

The first experience here has been utterly disgusting. We went there at a friend's birthday party and were quite excited about the new rooftop arrangement. We ordered four items- A chicken steak, one penne formagio, another fried fish starter and grilled chicken fingers. Unfortunately we found all the food to be horrendous. Extremely neglible portion of food, stupidly bland and lacking any sort of taste, over over over cooked pasta and not so good hospitality.
I mean who does that? This place has a beautiful rooftop, posh area, already established name and this kind of food? Not desired at all. The whole experience was B A D.
Wise owl team please do something about it. Exploit your resources and give your customers a worthy experience.
P.S. The photos provided here by me looks nice. Just for the art of photography maybe. But please don't judge. Looks are deceptive! The food gave us a bad shock.

This is one of the best places in Kolkata,India if looking for good quality steak. I ordered the short ribs and rib eye steak with mushroom sauce. I told them that I like my steak medium rare...it was nice but it was a bit over cooked. Instead of medium rare it was medium though it tasted brilliant. But the pork ribs were an absolute no no. As they presented the pork to us...I just saw three thick slabs of fat on the wooden board. I am a person who loves pork fat and probably can't survive without it in a pork dish...but that was waaaay to much for my soal to handle. Otherwise the ambience and the service is lovely and fast.

Being an ardent wise owl patron after much deliberation I visited Its new appendage steak house. Its situated on the roof top of The famous Wise owl n I liked its minimalistic decor and open air ambiance. We ordered A cheesy fry and a grulled chicken for starters. It took them 45 minutes to get us the food and it seemed they where not interested to take the order. Well the gheesy cheese fries where soggy and there was nothing cheesy about it. An advice I believe they are using gouda for the cheesy part of the fry but I believe normal processed cheese or traditionaly cheddar should b used for the famous Philly Classic. A grilled chicken I believe can never go wrong. But the one i had was just like Tar in my mouth. I dont know what they wanted to concoct but the experiment failed. The sauce in which the chicken was grilled was Bitter to the point it was it was non edible. And the portion was almost like a coun in a beggar's bowl. I was so disappoibted that the intent of hsving dinner evaporated. Overall a great disappointment

Went here during pujas and it was all messed up. The food served left a lot to be desired as the salads were just horrible. The burger however was above average. The service set up was just not there and so was the condition that I had to go up to the kitchen to cancel an order as I was getting late. I even had to travel to the cash reception counter in order to plead for my bill. :)
All in all, if I consider that the first impression is the last, then the outlet is not worth a second visit ! So they need to work on a lot on their service first and then food to an extent !

Our first visit to Wise Owl Streak House for lunch today went off reasonably well. 
We began with Louisiana Cajun Prawns & Beer Butter Prawns for starters. Then, we graduated to the main dish - Pork Burger, Pork chops, chicken breast streak & fish filet steak. For deserts, we selected a Ferrero-Rocher pastry, a chocolate mousse & caramel custard. 
Food was excellent. Wish I could say the same about the service. It was slow & sloppy but friendly if you know what I mean. Although there were only ten diners for the lunch, it took us nearly two hours to finish our lunch, complete the payment & leave. 
It's a new restaurant so it's yet to put in place a proper system to serve its customers efficiently. It took them nearly 15 minutes to present the bill & clear the payment.
It's also irritating when you're told that certain items on the menu are not available, like Oreo pastry.
Finally, for a non-air-conditioned eatery with Spartan furniture, the price's a wee bit on the high side, about 1,700 for two.

The craving for a good Steak took me to this restaurant. Went in about 10.30 PM and was greeted with the waiter saying" We are closed" where as the time mentioned on the board read " Open till 12"! Anyways the good manager came forward and agreed to "open the restaurant for me". Ordered for a T-Bone which was flatly refused. Settled for a Sirlion - Medium rare. What came to my table was more like a cold salad...veggies were cold, meat was pathetic...mashed potatoes were also slimy....and to add more salt to my open wound the sauce was Watery with an attempt to spice it up with Tabasco! Overall a VERY BAD Experience. Would advice Steak lovers to stay away.

The steakhouse was a welcome addition to this popular joint. Finally,had the chance to visit this roof top venue. The ambience is pleasant with wooden furniture and soft n soothing lights. However, the food leaves a lot to be desired. We had ordered Fish & chips with tartar sauce and Chicken ala kiev. Fish & chips was a huge disappointment as the fish was not properly cooked and had a lingering stench. The tartar sauce was not upto the mark. Chicken ala kiev was average with little amount of molten butter. The service was slow and the attendants seemed a tad confused about the menu. Overall, a disappointing experience. AVOID!

A great place for an evening snack. Located on top of the legendary wise owl coffee shop. Food is good. Fish and chips with tartar sauce is a must and the icecream soda was an icing on the cake. Staff is really cool. It is a rooftop but the place needs to be insect free in order to attract people like me for the second time.

A pleasant saturday evening marred with an unforgettable trip to the "coveted" Steakhouse.
Greeted by smiling faces & a dining area empty enough to encourage ploughing. 
We ordered for Pork steak to be informed "no pork". Next option was "T-bone steak", to be informed they could only arrange for one portion, expecting us to share it amongst 4. Next order Chicken Al a Kiev, "not available" was the common repartee. 
Final option  - EXIT.
A highly condescending experience.

Didn't find the option to give rating less than 1..The worst experience in a long long time..quality of food is NOT good..quantity is even more annoying, it will not even fill a kid's appetite..only the open terrace is good..
Pork chops had only fat,no meat..when we pointed that out, the attendent said that this is what they serve..another item is Grilled Chicken Strips..this contained 5 pieces of bitter chicken so small that you can't even pick it up with a fork..seriusly spoilt the mood..

Love the food and ambience. It's the perfect place to hang out during the winter months; has a lovely rooftop view. My friends tried the cottage cheese steak, cheesy garlic bread and I had the quarter pounder Jacobean; yummy, enormous quantities of fries. Will visit again soon.

This is probably turning out to be one of the best food joints in Southern Calcutta. 

A must visit for people who prefer a quiet atmosphere. 

Honestly, The Wise Owl Steakhouse has a very positive vibe about it. The location, the ambience, everything has a very attractive feel.

The food is pretty good. I would recommend trying the spaghetti bolognese with lamb curry, which I believe is one of it's specialities, apart from the luscious steaks.

And yes, I would definitely want to come back to The Wise Owl Steakhouse over and over again.

With so much of expectations we decided to pay this particular place a visit and it disappointed us badly.. We were 6of us and for starters we ordered tenderloin strips, chicken strips and farmers market salad.. And three of them were delivered at an interval of 15mins.. And they didn't give us any plates rather expected us to grab the food with fork and share among the 6of us! When I insisted on giving us plates they provided only 2plates and left! 
Next for main course we ordered grilled chicken, chicken ala Kiev, fish fillet grilled and fish and chips.. Fish and chips particularly had a smell and the fish was not fresh! While fish fillet and ala Kiev was decent but could have been much better.. And lastly all the main courses ordered for 6people came at an interval of 15minutes, what are the other persona were suppose to do, look at others plate while the other person have their meal!! Ridiculous.. 

And last but not the least, they absolutely forgot that they didn't serve the chicken steak! And when nearly after am hour, one of us went in the kitchen to complain, they came back to enquire whether they actually delivered it or they forgot!!! What are we suppose to do?? Have it and hide the plates under the table??!! 

Horrible simply horrible

We went there for a casual dinner and was extremely disappointed with every aspect of service that a restaurant should provide its patrons. The service of the waiters was appalling, starting from their glum faces to their inability to fetch cold drinking water. The "crisp" Calamari starter was rubbery, drab-looking and utterly tasteless. Even the grilled chicken was under-cooked and poorly seasoned. 

And finally came their masterpiece. The renowned Steakhouse served a T-bone steak which was more chewey than Chewbacca of Star Wars. Less said about it the better.

The rooftop ambiance saved the evening from being a total waste.

The basic etiquette in the F&B industry is to serve your customers with a smiling countenance. The staff at Wise Owl's SteakHouse fails miserably in it. With their bored looks & indifferent attitude they won't survive for long, not with many a choice for foodies all around the Purna Das Road area. We had lunch at the SteakHouse today, had ordered for a couple of entree dishes, that came without accompanying plates. When we asked the attendant, he nonchalantly answered "we are short of staff". We'd also ordered for 5 main dishes. 4 came, but 1 took such a long time that 4 had already had finished theirs, & one was left playing with his knife & fork. Their reason for the inordinate delay? - paucity of staff ! With such callous attitude & impertinent conduct, the restaurant will find it tough getting repeat customers. I wouldn't recommend this place to others.

I visited the Steakhouse after a long day of Pujo shopping and was completely satisfied when i walked out of the beautiful rooftop. The way to the rooftop is like a little adventure where you follow street signs to get where you wanted to go. As soon as I entered the roof, I was warmly greeted and given a table. The view from that height is just amazing and so picturesque it took my breath away. Our order was very promptly taken. We had the beer battered prawns for appetizers and sure enough, it did leave us wanting more. The prawns were succulent and delicious and there are no words to describe the delicious batter. Next, we ordered a chicken steak for my mother, a tenderloin steak for my father and The Big Porky Burger for me. The steaks were lovingly topped off with mushroom creme and had a generous side of fresh vegetables and the meat was ample. The chicken was cooked to perfection but the tenderloin was quite chewy and dry. The burger, however stood out. It was eye candy as well as soul food. The bread was juicy, the pork patty was huge and so tasteful, the extra bacon i asked for was crunchy and had a beautiful smoked flavour while the extra cheddar cheese had been melted and toasted to perfection. A bite of each of these heavenly counterparts together was paradise. There were french fries to go along with it which were amazing as well. After the main course i wanted the chocolate mousse but it was not available. Instead, we went for a caramel custard which, unfortunately, was disappointing. The caramel was like runny cough syrup and the custard was lacking that extra awesomeness. It was pretty ordinary.
The staff was very prompt and friendly and the ambience was just perfect. The Wise Owl Steakhouse did deliver on whatever it promised (except dessert) and we had the perfect ending to a perfect day.

Generally I don't write reviews unless the food and service  is exceptionally good or bad. I just had dinner here. Service was pathetic, and food was bad. We had ordered some starters and 5 different steaks. Each item was served at an interval of 15 minutes if not more . They completely missed one item we had ordered and started preparing when we complained. And it was empty so they can't be busy with other customers. 

Coming to the food, the fish was not good it was not fresh . I am giving 1.5 for a decent  chicken steak. Really disappointed.

I quite liked the rooftop experience. Scuffed wooden tables and chairs, dim but ambient lighting, food is quite good too. Service is much more prompt than its cafe counterpart downstairs. The food is quite as good and the beverages, at least the iced tea, is better. We had the chicken breast steak and garlic cheese bread, iced tea and the ferrero rocher pastry. It all was tasty and satisfactory. I would certainly go back.

Ordered a rib eye steak, medium rare, with mushroom and creme sauce. The steak was done perfectly to my taste, but the meat slightly chewy. Just a bit more tender and I would rated this place a 4. We also tried the chicken breast steak and cheesy fries. Both of them were satisfactory. Will visit again.

Pictures will uploaded as and when I finish editing them. :)

It's basically an extension to Wise Owl Cafe with a rooftop setting. Wise Owl steakhouse as the name suggests, will satisfy some heavy meat craving souls. I gave this place a visit after doing some pandal hopping near Hindustan Park area this afternoon. The place was completely empty, don't know the reason behind this as all restaurants running full these days of Durga Puja. The ground floor Wise Owl Cafe was crowded though.

Anyways, the food we ordered was Caesar Salad with Sliced Chicken, Chicken Breast Steak and Fish 'n' Chips. First came the salad, which was basically a creamy lettuce salad with some other veggies like cherry tomatoes. It was topped with sliced chicken as ordered and the quantity was overwhelming. Then came Chicken Breast Steak, which was grilled chicken steak with mashed potato and other veggies. Fish 'n' Chips had two pieces of fish filet and several potato wedges kind of chips accompanied with tarter dip. Overall everything tasted superb and lip smacking.

Cheque came around ₹1200 for 3 persons which is standard these days. Quantity was quite nice and was enough for all of us. Ambiance was just about average, though it's a rooftop setting hence decoration is minimal. Tables and chairs were very basic and decor felt a bit cheaply done. There was a music system there which was not playing unfortunately. Overall, ambiance not as good as ground floor cafe. Service was on the quicker side, order came within 20 minutes and billing was done promptly.

In a nutshell, I would say it's a nice steakhouse, I would recommend visiting during night time as dining rooftop at night just feels great.

Severely disappointed with wise owl steak house. Went there to have dinner and came out having  possibly the worst steak I have had in my life. Had ordered chicken steak. Steak is supposed to be juicy but all I had was a dry slab of meat which lacked in taste as well succulence. 
 Thoroughly disappointed

A horrendous experience totally..pathetic food. Bad service..had ordered a bangers and mash which consists of pork sausage and mashed potatoes. Sausage was good but the mashed potatoe totally tasteless. Sauce tooo sweet. Main course we ordered chicken breast steak and pork ribs..pathetically tasteless. Pork chops were dry. It seemed it was pre boiled and then grilled.. the meat was hard and the sauce again toooo sweet... chicken steak was a nightmare. Again extremely dry and had no sauce at all.. lastly the caramel custard  was a tiny piece and tasted ok amongst the other horrific dishes. We are definitely not coming back.

The quantity for the garlic bread was a bit less, but taste was superb. For dessert, caramel custard gets a high five.

If presented between the choice of having food from here or going to bed hungry, always go to bed hungry. Always.
 

It pains me to see such a beautiful location, being put to such ill use. 

Went with a party of three, ordered the Calamari and Tenderloin Strips for starters, and Rib Eye, Sirloin and pork chops for the main course.

The Tender Loin Strips were nice and juicy. The Calamari was horribly overdone and chewy. (Almost a chewing gum like consistency, thoroughly exhausting and flavourless) 

The pork chop was essentially over cooked meat with a lard of fat. The fat showed no signs of rendering or even the minutest touch of the grill. I am curious as to how this monstrosity came about? Perhaps what they meant by slow cooked is “Microwaved”.

The Rib Eye and Sirloin had been asked to be well done. The rib eye was left pink, but was not bad for most parts. The Sirloin smelt like last year and the meat tasted terrible and had to be sent back. The only explanation which was given is that the steak was possibly underdone. I cook quite regularly, and even raw meat doesn’t smell bad. I was billed for it, never the less.

The steak places at Alipore and Mudiali are a far far better option, and as I mentioned earlier, even going to bed hungry is!

Overall the  trauma/experience was unforgettable, in its own way.

Go to bed hungry. Seriously.

We ordered a Jacobean beef burger, bangers and mash, and a farmer's market salad. The salad came first, then the burger, and later the bangers.

The salad was leafy greens and red capsicum with a light dressing and a little grated cheese on it. It was good, but pretty boring.

The beef burger had some presentation issues. It's served on a wooden plank (bad idea), which they generously drizzled with spicy mustard (worse idea) before plopping down the burger and potato wedges. So the bottom of the burger was soggy with mustard, and ended up tasting too much of mustard. The meat was tasty, but over-salted. Overall the flavors didn't quite work. But it was the best part of the meal.

The bangers (pork sausages) were seasoned nicely, but had an dry quality to them. To make good sausages I think the fat needs to be ground thoroughly with the meat to give it that juicy quality. These seemed low-fat, except for a few large cubes of fat mixed in. The bangers were covered in a thick blanket of BBQ sauce. I like BBQ sauce on BBQ, but it didn't really work here.

So I finally visit the place which is supposed to host yummy steaks this side of the city and is new in town. 

And guess what!!

Completely disappointed. The meat was dry, the quantity was average, the mashed potato wasn't creamy enough, the cream and mushroom sauce was watery, too much oregano and too little vegetables for one plate. 

The meat should have had more flavour and juicier, the vegetables should have been much more in quantity (with the 400 bucks per plate they are charging), the cream and mushroom sauce needed to be much thicker to be spread on top of the steak as is the case usually, all these to say the least.

I appreciate their effort and wish them luck. I agree the open ambience and casual look on the floor has a charm of its own. But end of it all, it's a food joint and am really disappointed and wouldn't suggest the place to anyone who wants to dig into some steaks.

This restaurant is conveniently located on Purna Das road, on top of Wise owl cafe. It's a rooftop place with nice view all around. Picnic chairs and table with nice music. It wasn't too crowded on the Saturday night that we went. We ordered Bangers and mash and Sirloin steak. Food was served on a wooden plate which was unique. The bangers and mash was awesome. Succulent pork sausages infused with secret herbs. The steak was a bit hard even though we asked for medium rare. Nonetheless it was tasty. The bill was quite reasonable too. Overall a nice place to dine out, only qualm is that they should add some mocktails to their menu.

Wise Owl is one of the renowned coffee shop. Few days back they came up with a new steak joint on their roof top. Wise owl Steakhouse. My first impression, it is not suitable for summer time coz they don't have Air Condition.. The service is also not very professional. Food is okay.. I had Chicken Burger and Pork Ribs.. Pork was bit stiff.. But they have a availability issues.. Lot of item was missing.. Experience was okay from my side.

This place is simply but well decorated with artifacts. They also now seem to have rooftop service of continental items. The Steak items are prepared for dinner only. Rest of the day it is mainly breakfast and Lunch items - non gravy.
Went for breakfast today. Here they serve a variety of breakfasts particularly continental. Ordered toast and Spanish omelette. Served in 10 minutes. Brown Bread two slices toasted and Spanish omelette done with cheese served with side items of Finger Chips and baked Tomato. Tasty Not too heavy and filling at the same time. Cooking is good.
Recommended. Must visit.

Sunday evening...@ 930pm...with 7 buddies...thats the way you dine out on a weekend..half of the items not available on the menu...after taking orders we were faced with a solicitation as they have run out of vegetables and cud only provide french fries... to my utter surprise they declined at the time of ordering that they have their t-bone steak exhausted..twas a pleasant surprise to be served a t bone steak when you order a tenderloin... this place fails in basics... they dont have staff to take orders properly leave alone suggest an item... being co owner of krystal chopsticks and tero parbon this place is a big let down... now can i fathom why charcoal grill left this place

There are better places in town where you can get decent steak. Ambience is moderate, there is no air conditioning, fans don't spin that fast either. There is only one waiter who takes orders, the other two only serves, and it takes forever to take order. Food is ridiculously costly, few potatoes worth of French fries cost 180. Steak is costly too, over 400. There are very few vegetables served with steak. Unless you are really in for trying out places you haven't tried, stay away.

One of the most overrated places.
The ambience is great to hang out with friends. 
The food maybe good and service prompt, it is terribly expensive.
The quantity is too little to make a proper meal.
It might actually prove to be an unwise decision to visit Wise Owl Steakhouse.

The good things first

1.The only restaurant brave enough to call and classify itself as a steakhouse in Kolkata

2.Nice wooden seating in a covered terrace.With the hanging lights the ambience is nice but the trek through the cafe to catch the elevator and then trudge up one level is cumbersome.

3.Nice wholesome menu,with Beef,Pork and Chicken occupying pride of place

Now,the bad part

1.Totally mixed up ordering system.There were four of us.Two of our orders went to the adjoining tables.Twice.

2.Management of K.O.T ( kitchen order tickets ) was terrible.Two of our dishes arrived for individual dining orders after two of us finished dining.

3.Attitude.After a frustrating wait for 30 minutes when I asked for the manager,one smart alec waiter said ' I'm the manager'.When I walked up to the kitchen to complain to a gentleman trying to look busy,he brushed me off saying ' I'm the owner '.

We ordered Bangers and Mash ( pork sausages on mashed potatoes ).This was seriously good.Also a chicken steak which was served cold and the accompanying sauce which they billed extra( no idea why ) came after 15 minutes.The Rib Eye steak which we asked for well done ,came rare and so could not be eaten.The tenderloin steak again came cold and was too salty though the cut was good as was the grill.The sauces were obviously done in a hurry and forgettable.

In conclusion,a very disappointing experience especially as steak lovers,the joint lost some would be loyal customers.30% by the food,70 % by their behaviour.

Had heard plenty about the Wise Owl Steakhouse, and had been planning this visit for a long while. Based on this experience, I shouldn't have bothered. We went in a group of five. It took 15-20 minutes for our order to be taken. We were warned that items would be served one at a time, because they had just one oven (why?). They were true to their word - items did come out one at a time, with the appetisers arriving LAST - close to an hour after we had placed the order. It took us 10 minutes to get ice for one of the drinks ordered and around 15 minutes to get grated cheese for the spaghetti. The quality of food wasn't even average, the half-pound burger couldn't have been more than a quarter and the pork ribs were 70% fat (see photos). The less said about the dessert, the better. Eminently avoidable. The service staff were eager, yet totally inept and lacking in numbers. A very disappointing experience, and I'm struggling to understand how the good reviews happened in the first place.

To the accompaniment of the rain drumming an incessant tune on the tin roof, we made our entry into the famed portals of Wise owl steakhouse!  
This is a rooftop that has been converted into an eating place by erecting a tin roof over the top and khus - khus curtains hung all along the sides. The basic, bare feel of the place looks good and instantly sets the mood for an extended adda session over food. Everything about the place has a bare, spartan feel-it's simple, straight - backed woodgrained furniture, the archaic canopy style, military green light shades hanging from the ceiling and the menu card- a sheaf of papers clipped to an examination hardboard, which is fast becoming obsolete under the impact of gaudy plastic ones. If the intent of the owners is to transport the diners to a slightly older, back-to-nature period while having their steak, then I guess they have succeeded in their endeavour.  
I ordered a pork chop which came loaded with mashed potato and sautéed vegetables; all those extra accompaniments that make a steak really worthwhile and wholesome meal.  The pork pieces themselves were juicy with  the edge layered with thick lard which provided that extra bit of grease that moved right down into the crevices of a heart, hungry for satiation. 
The pork chop at the wise owl steakhouse, eaten to the accompaniment of the music of the rain beating down on the tin roof, was pure bliss and I made a mental note to come back and try it's other offering mainly pork ribs and beef steak. 
There's just one thing which might make me think twice about going back to this place. While there are ceiling fans, there are no air-conditioner, which makes me wonder what would it be like to dine here in the daytime when the  heat and humidity combine to make life uncomfortable in Kolkata. 
Do I then presume that this place only intends to be a "fair-weathered" dining destination to we Calcuttans?

I've visited this place twice and both my experiences have been terrible. The pasta in pesto sauce is absolutely tasteless. The service is so second rate, it is third rate.
On my second visit I tried a burger - The Jacobian Burger. The patty wasn't that bad but the bun was like saw dust. It disintegrated as soon as I took a bite. But that wasn't the worst part – the food took about an hour and a half to arrive – being the only vegetarian on the table I was made to wait that long for the only dish I ordered.
Horrible experience. I'll never visit again.

Went to the Wise Owl Steakhouse for a family get-together this Saturday (Aug 29, 2015) and was sorely disappointed. We were a party of 15, including 2 small kids.
The staff is not capable of handling a crowd - in fact I think they should cap the number of seats at 12 or 15. It was almost painful to see the skeleton staff (both kitchen and waitstaff) run around cluelessly throughout the evening.
The portion sizes of the starters (teeny tiny cheese garlic toasts and tiny pieces of grilled chicken on a bed of lettuce) was disappointing. A steakhouse is not for dainty food, right?The other starter we ordered, the bruschetta with tomato and basil was underseasoned. The bread was not even warm, much less toasted. 
Among the mains, only the Chicken a la Kiev was good. The rest (mostly rubbery Chicken steaks, tasteless overcooked pasta dishes, a disgusting fish and chips dish and a veg cheese casserole) were either burnt (not "charred" mind you), mushy or just plain tasteless... very very sad with the quality of food turned out that evening.
The tables were dirty (with bird poo) and were only cleaned after multiple requests. Requests for glasses for drinking water and cutlery were ignored several times. In fact, at one point, we were running back and forth, setting up the table and putting in orders for our dinner at the kitchen pass.The place can be so much better. They really really really need to work on the service....Request the management to please sit up and take note.

How I wish I could give them a negative rating.. Extremely bad experience. We went there today around 6:30. After waiting for 10 minutes or more we had to call up the waiter who was standing far from us as if he was not in mood of taking order. We ordered chicken croquettes in starter and tenderloin steak in main. Then we asked for coke, but seeing the price of one glass coke we immediately cancelled it. The waiter without confirming our order ( generally what every waiter does before taking the order to kitchen) went off. After waiting for more than half an hour chicken croquettes arrived along with coke. We were shocked to know that he didn't cancelled it. But as the order has already arrived we didn't return the drink. But this is not the end. After finishing off the starter we kept waiting for our main course - tenderloin steak. After waiting for a while we asked the other waiter about our order. He came back after 5 minutes to inform us we have never ordered for tenderloin steak. We were so so shocked to hear that. He told us to wait for 15 more minutes and steak will be ready. But it was already 8 by then. For only starter and coke we spent there 1 hr 30 minutes and we didn't want a new drama anymore. So we told him to bring the bill. Again we waited for few minutes. Bill came. Next the waiter who took the order came with the balance amount and instead of apologizing for his mistake he started arguing that we didn't order the steak at all. I really never seen this kind of service before. Highly disappointed as I went there to have steak mainly. Will never visit this place.

Its a perfect place for adda n fun wd frndz.
Coming to food we had ordered grilled chicken strips as starters and chicken breast steak n pork chops as main course.all of them were fantastic.although we felt pork chops could hav been cooked a lil more.we had also ordered ferrero rocher pastry but it had a typical strong smell of spirit and probably it was stale.on complaining though the management showed good gesture by not charging for the same.overall its really a nice place to be in.only thing they need to work on is the service quality.its a let down at the moment wd only one person serving all the guests it takes a lot of time to place the order and get the same.

The wise owl steakhouse being the new addition to the increasing number of steak joints in the city lives up to your expectations. Though I waited a bit too long for the food to arrive but nevertheless I was quiet impressed by the quality of food. The starters and pasta needs a special mention. 
More over the rooftop ambience and soothing background music creates a light hearted mood.

Best part of the meal though was just the starters. Beer batter prawn 


We ordered a t bone steak along with the fries. The meat was supposed to be medium well done but was really really rubbery. 

Our friend ordered a bacon burger which was pretty good and juicy.

Well where do I start.... When one's favourite Cafe opens a rooftop steakhouse what is one to do.... Of course.... Go and dig in.... So after what was a very long day.... A friend and I found ourselves on the ranch like rooftop resto... With hanging lights and rustic wooden tables and chairs rendering the place a ranch like charm. The menu came on a clip board... Interesting... Though calamari with tzatziki dip was not available .... We tried the Bangers and Mash... Pork sausages on a creamy mashes potatoes... The sausages were laced with herbs and were delicious. For the main course I had the chicekn steak... Succulent, Aromatic and loved the side of creamy mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.... My adventurous meat eater friend went for the sirloin steak with barbeque sauce .... Well done... And as with most beef steak it was tough .... I wish he had settled for medium rare .... Juicy and tender.... That is how I like my steaks....
Washed down with fresh lime soda and iced tea it was on the whole a wholesome and soul satisfying dinner.... Yum....

I'm so glad such a nice place has opened right near my house. The pork sausages were yum! It didn't have the artificial cold cut feel, had a great texture, there was all sorts of grounded goodies like Garlic and Ginger in the meat. 
The ambience is so simple that's it's refreshing for a change, I love the taste in music there. Totally compliments the food. Only if beer was allowed only for the winters, definitely a meat lovers paradise!

Wise owl has always been a super favourite place to hangout with friends (^__^) now this new addition is like an icing to the cake.. ambience is sooo amazing.. i couldn't stop smiling the entire time.. basic wooden furnitures and minimal lighting with good music and the amazing breeze.. should be added to the romantic section of zomato. As far as food is concerned .. we tried ice tea, coke , cheese garlic bread and grilled chicken breasts and rib eye beaf steak. Ice tea was good. The chicken breasts weren't bad.. the beaf steak in comparison to th Oly pub's was a disappointment. Desserts were all exhausted by 8pm.. Staff isn't very attentive. Overlooking the food , which isnt quite impressive.. the ambience is "the big reason" why you should drop in for sure.. towards the evening preferably.. with your beloved 😄 
I  really really in love with this place and would loove to visit again but ofcrse would try something different next time.

Visited this awesome place today. Must say that the starters were great. We had an assortment of those. The fish and chips were good too. Especially loved the fresh lime soda salty.  The place is great to hang out with friends and the staff is very helpful too. Set on the rooftop it has an excellent ambience. The decor is minimal- all bare wooden but  comfortable nonetheless. I only wish the segment for non-smokers would be larger so that nobody would be disturbed. An excellent choice for dining out.

Wise owl has been one of my favourites for quite some time and with my first visit to Wise Owl Steakhouse I am sure it will get added to my favourite soon.

Ambience good. On the terrace. No AC/Only fans but you dont feel the heat. The open air terrace is good enough. Seating simple with music in the background. 
Ordered a chicken breast steak, the mermaid burger and lousiana cajun prawns. Loved the chicken breast steak. Better than most other steaks I have had in the city. The mermaid burger is good but may not fill the stomach of someone with a decent appetite so you may have to order something as well. The prawns was something I had expected better. I am not very comfortable with prawns with shells hence personally i didnt enjoy it as much. 
Has more beef options than chicken, fish and pork. Will want them to increase their menu on these as well

But overall loved my experience. Will surely go back there. And a place I will surely recommend to you as well. Pocket pinch: You can manage in Rs1000-1200 for two people with drinks and desert as well

Every thing was going great and smooth until that happened. We were a bunch of 6 brimming with excitement as finally we will probably have affordable beef steak apart from olys. And it started great. The chicken croquettes were really good, followed by pretty well done and presented rib eye steak and a little chewey sirloin steak. The Chicken steak a friend ordered turned out bad...but the burger was pretty well done. And all this while we waited for our final order. Spaghetti Bolognese...and which came another half hour later. And when it did it was still not cooked well. Half cooked and super late. That took everythng down. Anyways,they did the right thing by not charging for that without us telling thm. But still a bad experience that bit. Thats that then. Hope they only improve from here

The place is awesome with good food to b true it's pure value for money...
We ordered for pork steak and grilled bhetki...
Both were good specially the pork steak it was awesome...
The food as it was fried in olive oil it was also a bit healthy in nature and about the ambience nothing to say it was raining like cats and dogs were were sitting in the covered roof top having fags and our dishes...
The only thing which was a disappointment for me was the fresh lime soda, it was not atall prepared correctly like the mint flavor was not at all there with too much tulsi leaf...
To b true as a part of Wise Owl group I have enough belief on it that it will improve a lot...

Ohhh!!! Miserable experience. The restaurant was not at all crowded but still the people their  pathetically failed to manage the orders. We had to wait for an hour for food but atlast came to know that they had served it to somebody else. For that they didnot even bother to apologise.Not only this,the fish in the steak was also not fresh. Kolkata has too many steakhouses. Will never ever go back to this place.

Spent Tuesday night here, eating a leisurely dinner. The steakhouse is on the rooftop. Wooden seating welcomes you along with good music. They were playing Coldplay, Aerosmith, Bryan Adams and some other great bands. The minimalist decor is a welcome break.

The menu is interesting - different steaks, seafood, white meat, prawns - they have it all. We skipped the entrée and went straight to the mains. We had the pork chops, tenderloin steak and chicken spaghetti polpetta. Everything was cooked well and service was fairly quick. Unfortunately they had run out of dessert.

The steaks are a definite recco and the tab goes easy on your wallet. Good place to spend a peaceful night out.

It was a cloudy evening and the roads were wet with rain from the afternoon when we trooped into Wise Owl and proceeded upstairs to the newly opened Wise Owl Steak House! Let it be known that I am partial to rooftop places, warm yellow light and light coloured wooden furniture and this place ticked all these three boxes. 
We ordered iced tea and sweet lime soda while we waited for the rest of our group...these were average. Once all were present and accounted for we ordered the following: Chicken Kiev, Fish and Chips, Mac n Cheese, Caesar Salad and Chicken Croquettes. The only issue was that despite repeating the order our server forgot the Fish and Chips and one member of the party had to awkwardly wait for 15 minutes and pick at the salad while the rest of us had our dinners in front of us. 
The food was exceptionally good. Be it the croquettes made of mashed potatoes with cheese and chicken mince or the kiev which gloriously oozed garlic butter or the Caesar salad which had a generous scattering of parmesan and tasty dressing-soused croutons. The star of the show, however, was the Mac n Cheese! It was like heaven on a plate for my cheese-loving friend who enjoyed it thoroughly. I heard from the fish -eaters that the fish was fresh and fried to a crunch.
Suggested areas for improvement: More beverage choices to attract the cafe crowd, having wi-fi will ensure that patrons can post online pictures and praise the food while at the eatery and to ensure desserts....we were told they were all out of desserts at 8:30 pm which was very sad!

But just for the food alone I shall be visiting again.

The Wise Owl Steakhouse is the newest addition to an increasing array of steakhouses that's coming up in Kolkata. Conveniently located on the rooftop of Wise Owl cafe, the place can accommodate 40/50 diners at a time. However, the place lacks air-conditioning. Monsoon or autumn evenings are fine, but the place may be a tad bit uncomfortable in summers. 
Coming to the ambience, it's minimalistic. There's nothing other than a few neatly laid out tables and chairs. The menu is limited, but I would say, it packs quite a punch for non-vegetarians. We ordered for a Rib-eye steak with BBQ sauce and and a Spaghetti Bolognese with chicken. The spaghetti was ok-ish I would say, nothing extra-ordinary. The steak on the other hand was absolutely delightful. I prefer to have well-done steaks and this one didn't disappoint. However, the portions are a bit humble I would say. 
The waiters are polite and courteous, but the service is excruciatingly slow. Maybe the management needs to employ more waiters. It took us almost 45 minutes to get our steak and spaghetti. It was overall a decent experience and I would like to try out the fare on offer.

We were the first ones there today. They have spruced up the roof real nice and the place looks good. It's quite spacious. The music wasn't playing when we entered, however, it started playing after a little while - good songs, too. We ordered a Pork Ribs in BBQ sauce and Sirloin Steak in Brown Sauce. The Sirloin Steak came with mashed potato and veggies on the side. The pork was good, the beef was too dry for my liking, therefore the mashed potato with brown sauce was the highlight of that dish. :P The dishes we ordered, each dish could be shared among two people. We were four people in total. So roughly, the pocket-pinch was Rs 250 per person.Overall, we had a good time, but the beef failed to impress me.

I wanted to visit this place for a long time and today despite of the bad weather I went to this place around 6. The decoration is nothing extraordinary but the ambience is good. It is quite spacious. The service is fast unlike the wise owl and staffs are friendly. We ordered pork sausages with mashed potato and it was sooooo delicious 😘, next we ordered fish and chips because my partner is a big fan of the fish items they serve and it was well made. I ordered a slice of cake with hazelnut and it was not at all good. Overall a nice place to satisfy meat cravings but they should improve their dessert menu and must add some good beverages. 😀😀

Having heard good things bout the place, i decided to do a takeaway since its next door. I was absolutely disappointed with the fact that a order which was to be ready in 25 minutes took 55minutes. Which means I had to stare at people eating, the walls, the boarders going up,etc.,while waiting for the takeaway. Mercifully, the food was good and the grilled chicken in mushroom sauce,chicken steak & the caramel custard was very well prepared. I hope they enhance their service delivery standards to that of the quality of the food..

Value-for-money food, one plate of any item being enough for two.
But service not among the best. Ambience is good no doubts. Definitely, one must visit for the good taste at least.

Visited the Steakhouse last night. Feeling is mixed. We ordered the cajun prawns as appetizers. Although it tasted well, but the prawns are served whole with the shell on. It was very messy taking the shell off with hand plus they don't serve small plates to keep the shells takeb off. We ordered the rib eye steak and the sirloin. Both were excellent. They should add more mocktail options though. One major negative is only two people serving aroung 10-12 tables. Therefore service is a little slow although the gentlemen who serve are extremely courteous and helpful.

Visited this restaurant today,but was very unsatisfied with the food,firstly I ordered for Tenderloin steak,which they didn't had,this was their first negative point as under the name of steakhouse all types of steak should be kept.Then I ordered for chicken steak which was not so good n the preparation of the steak was very poor.my partner had fish n chips, which was horrible just horrible.

Last saturday i have visited this newly opened food joint.this restaurant shares the same address with wise owl. It's the rooftop restaurant of wise owl.i was craving for russian salad but unfortunately they failed to serve the dish.then as per counsel of the staff i had fish n chips,spaghetti Bolognese,fresh lime soda. 
Fish n chips : very oily,taste was moderate,quantity was adequate.
Spaghetti Bolognese : acceptable quantity,taste was mediocre.
 Lots of refinement should be done in sitting area.xtra fan should be added to make the place more cosy.

While i am already a huge fan of wise owl.. a steak house under the same banner was too much for me to resist.Recenty visited their steak house on rooftop ... while the rooftop idea always flatters me i was kind of disappointed with their food as the steak we ordered was served almost like a cold salad ! hope they improve on their food section upstairs as i would like to dig into a wholesome steak on a rainy evening in their rooftop !

Lovely place. Awesome Ambience. Food is tasty and they offer you a variety if steak items and the best fact is it won't burn a hole in your pocket. Was looking such a steakhouse for long and here it comes. Hope to see some more variations in the menu. BBQ Pork Ribs-TBone Steak-Spaghetti Bolognese are some of the must try dishes.

Another good continental eatery in South Kolkata, that notably serves excellent beef and pork dishes. The steaks are better than most and you won't go wrong with medium or medium-well. The quality of the meat here really is that good. The Chicken Kiev served here is also very nice. The bangers and mash was just alright, but I gotta say the garlic bread was a bit ordinary.

The restaurant is on the terrace roof of the building Wise Owl cafe is in. Since it is outdoors there is no a/c. The kitchen seemed quite clean so that is a huge plus. The furniture is wooden and it all adds up to a charming rooftop ambiance. I don't recall our orders taking longer than usual.

One minor problem is that they seem to run out of items fairly quickly, so you have to get in quickly. Perhaps such teething problems are to be expected in a restaurant that opened this recently. They didn't have pork chops when I got there at about 9:30pm, and they ran out of desserts. They don't have many lamb dishes other than burgers from what I saw.
But that's all fine - the quality of the entrées more than made up for this, and I look forward to visiting this place again in future. You won't find steaks of this quality and at this price point in many other places in Kolkata.

Update: Revisited this great restaurant a few days ago, this time they had everything I missed out on the last time - pork chops and rib eye steak. Both were excellent, and the quality of the meat was top notch. Although I must say the veggie sides could use some improvement. We also ordered a dish of grilled calcutta bhetki which was excellent. The leafy green based side that came with the fish was nice.

I'm not sure why the rating is so poor.The food is just great. 
Love the burgers and the Steaks.
The simplistic decor adds value.
Would love to see more Dessert options though.

Great continental food. Absolutely brilliant to chill out, especially if you're not interested in having alcohol, just great food and the weather thanks to their outdoor seating section.

The service is delayed. Then again this is a place to go with good company, so it did not bother us. Do ensure to check the specials for the day. I don't try all but whatever I have tried is fabulous.

The ambience is very simple. I like it. I prefer sitting outside than inside, except when it's really hot.

I've never had a parking problem ever. So that's a convenience.

Five of us visited this place this weekend. We ordered chicken Spaghetti Bolognese, BBQ Pork Ribs, Chicken Al-a-kieve, sirloin steak and Bangers & mash (Pork sausage stuffed with herbs and spices). Firstly, they took more than 40 minutes to serve the food and when the food came, all items other than Chicken-Al-a-kieve and spaghetti tasted bad. The pork ribs were half done. When asked to change the dish, they obliged, however, served us with pork ribs where 90% of it constituted of fat making it impossible to consume. We had asked for “medium rare” sirloin steak but the steak was chewy and had a bad smell.

To top it all, the washrooms did not have water. We had to arrange and use a bottle of water to use in the washrooms!!!
