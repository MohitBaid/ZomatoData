Ego has a vast variety of hard drinks as well as cocktails to offer & the staff there are well equipped with what kind of drinks should go with a particular meal.
I wish I could visit the bar every alternative day. The ambience is as perfect as the bar staff.

At peerless inn Â a cozy lounge bar EGO has its own style of service for drinks and food. I enjoyed the dimsum which is being served from the basket to plate . Service excellent staffs are very good Â and friendly. I like this place and will visit in the large group.

I had an offer where i supposed to get to free beers when i buy two.  They ignored me completely and then told that couldn't provide me that offers. No reasons were given. Utter nonsense service.

I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was the first time i was visiting to this place. Though i have heard about it so much before. The place was fine and can be visited no doubt.

Awesome.. Kudos i must say. It was my first visit to a 5star restora. The best ever corn soup i have eaten here.. And the rice chicken everything was too worthy in taste. But one problem is there. The quantity is very low as per their price,.ðŸ˜“

This is one of the restaurant in Peerless Inn among the few. The varieties and food is decent . Service is a bit slow and the good thing about this place is its ambiance. Overall an average restaurant but definitely worth a try.
