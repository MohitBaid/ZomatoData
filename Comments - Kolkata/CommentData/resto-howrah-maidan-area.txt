I ordered food from here via swiggy. Chicken burger And swarma were good but the fried chicken was tasteless (no taste at all) and very oily soft though. And chola bhatura was a disaster , it had spilled all over , 4pc bhatura was missing and the WORST part was it had GONE BAD and was SMELLING BAD. How can a restaurant serve food that has gone bad ?? Very disappointed with the quality and packaging . Swiggy played a good role and they refunded me the whole amount I spent when I refused to take the replacement (as the food was smelling).

It tastes good according to the price. Noodles are good and the burger is really good. And the burger's price is just 25. So it's really cheap and tasty. .

I have tried chicken burger. Two medium size chicken, some onion, c√†pcicum, little butter inside a paw. Not too good, but OK for rs. 25.
Outlet is not so spacious.

Ordered combo of chicken burger+ fried chicken+ chicken swarma roll.
1.Best was CHICKEN BURGER , a junk piece of chicken at inly 25 INR. Tastes delicious. (5/5)
2. Fried chicken was also good , a little but dried but taste was awesome. (4.5/5)
3. Chicken swarma roll was not so impressive. Wrap of the roll can be improved but filling inside was tasty at the price of 25 INR(3.5/5) 
OVERALL goid experience.
