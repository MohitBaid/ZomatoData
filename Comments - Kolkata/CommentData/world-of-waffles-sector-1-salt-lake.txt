Location : It is located in Quality, Salt lake. This place is right opposite to the Titan Eye Plus showroom, squeezed between Hollywood Dry Cleaners and Samsung showroom. 
 Food : I visited this place with a friend of mine who has equal love for waffles like me. We ordered Nutella Nudge half and a Hot Chocolate Candy Waffle.  Yes, the price varies according to the quantity. They have sizes ranging from  quarter, half to full. 
Now the Nutella Nudge Waffle was very crispy crunchy and fully loaded with Nutella. Unlike other places that serve waffles this one is not chewy and soggy. I really liked it. Coming to the Hot Chocolate Candy Waffle it was too sweet for my taste buds. But my friend loved it. It comes in a stick just like candyfloss. This one is rather chewy like those gummy bears. Another reason I didn't like it. 
Personally I found this place over priced. They charge way too much for half a plate of  waffles. I also wish the place was more bigger and spacious. It feels really cramped. Otherwise the waffles are really good. If you love waffles and haven't visited this place yet I recommend you visit it yourself and see if you like it .

A new outlet for waffles in Saltlake- The world of Waffles. Its in Kwality opp to Titan Eye. 
A small outlet but very well decorated to grab attention. 

Got to know about it from family and friends. Also, the pictures were tempting enough to pull chocolate lovers like me to the outlet :p :) 

They offer waffle in three sizes- quarter, half and full. Tried the WOW special Oreo & Cream(size half) which was overloaded with chocolate syrup and loads and loads of oreo and served deliciously with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Heaven for chocolate lover and tastes super delicious.

What i found new was the variety in the base- the plain and the brownie. I opted for brownie base as wanted to try something different.

Recommended once for every waffle lover and Must go for every chocolate lover + waffle lover. 

All the best to the team and thank you for bringing such delicious waffles to us!! :)

Located near kwality, Saltlake city. Went there late night on Christmas eve. Had seen in zomato about the timings, so it was time to get closed. But the owner itself welcomed us as well as staff and kept it open. Staff was courteous and welcoming. Small kiosk. Had ordered for candy waffles which is uncommon till date, as many waffles brand dont serve in candy, they also serve snacks. Pocket friendly.
Had ordered for hot chocolate and Nutella candy waffleüç°. It was delicious and yummyüòú.

I wished to start 2018 with something warm and sweet , waffles seemed to be a perfect choice hence headed towards this newly opened waffle shop at sector 1 swimming pool area.
Seating is available on couple of plastic tools essentially spoiling the decor of the shop , We ordered a quarter each of BROWNIE EXPRESS( waffle topped with crumbled brownie and chocolate sauce )and BANANA RUMBA (topped with banana slices and caramel sauce) , along with a BLUEBERRY CANDY WAFFLE . What i didn't like was the blueberry jam and the pricing which seemed high. The waffles easily score a 4 on 5.
The staff showed a cold behavior. We were the first guests on a new year morning , none of them greeted us with a new year wish , not even a good morning . The lady who seemed to be the owner wasn't warm as well , started counting bills after she got in. No one to take a feedback or to ask for visiting again , the staff were less interactive than we find at other waffle shops. Waffles are like emotions (alteast for a waffle lover like me) , ensure to serve them with a smile :)

Another new waffle place in the city. They have a wide variety of choices with options for original or brownie based waffles. We tried blue fantasy, which was really good. So was Oreo and cream, a chocolatey sin! Also tried the Ferraro Rocher and chocolate overload, but they were not that impressive.
The place is really small, with no seating arrangements. Service was quick and it's really cheap too.

Great taste. Reasonable price. Highly recommend the nutella waffle.
Just a suggestion: the caramel waffle turned out to be a tad bit sweeter, maybe some people would love this but I'm not that of kind. I just think that the amount of butterscotch kernels could be reduced or adjusted based on preference.

The city has got a new outlet for the waffle lover - yes, the world of waffles just knocked on the door of Kolkata, and it's just before the Xmas in the winter - what can you ask for more.

Came to know about this from the FoodZaph food group. The FB live was tempting enough for me to give a visit there on the next day.

Location:
____________

It's at BE block. Well this is on the same road where the Fly Kuzina is, just a few minutes walking distance from there.
If you are having balle balle bhaba ( cc1) on your left, go straight, cross the island. Then on the next island turn right. Follow the straight road, it will be on right hand side after some distance.

Decoration:
_____________

Very small outlet, but well decorated to grab your attention.
1st is the dark wooden color of bench ( to keep your food) and the white wall gives a fresh look.
2nd is the painting on the wall of different type of waffle n all will surely catch your attention.

Food:
________

Every waffle was tasted of quarter size and plain base. They offers three type : quarter, half and full size with two type of base plain and brownie.

Personally I feel waffle is always good with plane base , that give you the actual taste and texture of the waffle, so I went for that only.

¬© Waffle:
____________

‚úì Choclate Overloaded Waffle : it's literally overalded with dark chocolate. Heaven for choclate lover. Owsum one. Presented with one scoop of ice cream.

‚úì Blue Fantasy Waffle : this was just pure magic. The waffle with blue berry was just owssum. Yes this one also presented with ice cream.

‚úì Rock Side Waffle : if you want to taste something on white chocolate, this is for you. Waffle with crushed Oreo and white chocolate. Insane. Just mind-blowing.

¬© Shakes:
____________

‚úì Sniker Shakes - very nice one. To me it was not excellent but yes very nice for sure.

¬© Refreshner:
________________

Well this section also blown me away.

‚úì Peach Passion Fruit Iced tea - superb one.
‚úì Masala Lemonade - damn refreshing. Another superb one.

Overall a very nice experience. Not only the taste, but also the hospitality of the people there is that warm.

All that cost 740 INR.

Team world of waffles Kolkata - the owner (the lady - I forgot to ask the name ), Suman & Pritam ( two person who makes the waffle so delicious) - it's a real pleasure to be there. Wish to see you in this year again. The waffle candy and choclate fondue is still pending.

One small suggestion:
________________________

You can have other option in fondue.
Like maple sauce fondue will be superb.

To All
_______

I think you can make out how much excited I was to be there. So don't wait, be there. Enjoy waffles :)

Last year I had tried World of Waffles in Mumbai and now the same brand opens up in Calcutta.
Located in Sector 1, Salt Lake.. it has hardly been a month since this place opened up.
Along with the waffles we also wanted to try their shakes. We tried Vanilla, Blueberry, Brownie and Oreo.
In the Blueberry Shake the flavour of vanilla was more dominanting than the flavour of blueberry. I loved the Oreo Shake.
We also tried one of their Iced Teas - Peach Passionfruit. It was very good.

Now the waffles.
Candy. Sandwich and regular.
Regulars had Oreo and Cream, Ferrero Rocher and Chocolate Overload.
Candy Waffles - Blueberry, Nutella and Maple Syrup.
And the only Waffle Sandwich - Blueberry Cream Cheese which is their signature and also turned out to be my favourite among the rest.

I'm a big fan of desserts and waffles and have a huge sweet tooth. World of Waffles was literally "WOW" for me. Definitely coming back again for the Blueberry Cream Cheese Waffle Sandwich!

Being a waffle lover, this place soon caught my attention. I absolutely loved this place. Their menu will left you awestruck. I was in a conflict as to which one i should order(my soul wanted to have all of them üòç). So finally rested upon a few of their offerings. 

Candy Waffle-For the first time, they have introduced candy waffles which is unique and at the same time quite delicious in flavour. The flavours were maple syrup and hot chocolate. Just one word "wow". Guys you need to try this asap for this is beautiful. 

Waffles- among the waffles, had ferrero rocher, oreo & cream and blue berry waffle sandwich. Each had its unique potentiality to amaze you. Ferrero give you the hazelnutty sweetness whereas oreo & cream give you that crunch chocolatey punch while the blue berry sandwich has the ability to give you a flavoursome tangy yet sweet wala experience.

Iced Tea/- coming to the shakes, well i took blue berry iced tea. Trust me guys the best iced tea i have had till date. Its refreshing and soothing. The blue berry flavour is just awesome.

Loved their waffles. They are beautifully cooked- crispy outside and beautiful inside. Had an oppurtunity to meet the owners and they were lovely. I will definately come here for sure. They have stole my heart. Fo visit this place guys. They are just ‚ù§

They are just 1% of Belgian Waffle (better not to copy ). Fries are pathetic , don't even think of trying . The lady at the counter is rude.

Located in salt lake, this place is perfect for spending some dessert time with friends and family. Brightly lit with perfect ambience and minimalistic decor, this place let's you unwind after a long day. The beautiful owner Vidushi Bajaj makes sure to help you melt away all your day's stress with her charming smile.
They have two categories of waffles, original base and brownie base, for all it's chocolate lovers. A wide menu to choose from and a perfect taste of each variety leaves you craving for more and drags you back to this place before you realize. I tried 7-8 kinds of waffles and an iced tea. Each waffle had its own unique taste, Blueberry Cheesecake Sandwich being my favorite. The iced tea wasn't a usual one either. It had a perfect punch to tingle your taste buds. 
Ecstatic taste and light on pocket makes this outlet perfect for all waffle lovers. Must try!!
