Ambience is average, service and hospitality is good... But the thing u r looking for, that's food, will really disappoint you... They really have no idea of flavours and dishes...

Great ambience light, music, beverages, delicious foods and of course a wide range of shisha flavours ... Nice place to hangout with friends...I would love to come here on every weekend as it is very pocket-friendly... I would request you all to come and have a look.

It's a small cafe, mainly a hookah bar. It has a so-so ambiance. The food is okayish, but it is unreasonably priced. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone... I'm reviewing this from a vegetarian's point of view.  :)

Location : Rajdanga, Take the orad right next to Acropolis, head straight, turn right as you approacha bridge, you'll find this café!

Went there with few of my friends for a casual hangout and I loved the LED lighting. Décor was clean and minimalistic.

We ordered :

2 hookahs : pretty decent.

chicken finger : Tasted pretty decent. I Liked it.

chicken mix herb pizza : The pizza was a let down. The base was super thick and biscuit like, the cheese used was not that great either.

The special chicken burger had one chunky cold piece of burger bun (esp the lower one, which i discarded), stuffed with a chicken patty that's as good (or bad) as the ones in railway canteens, with a processed cheese sheet inside, and basic mayonnaise (most likely) and even the french fries werent salted enough. To make a burger this uninspiring these days takes a lot of effort - given how the burger scene has seen exponential growth in Calcutta in recent times. 

The chilli garlic cheese toast was equally forgettable - it was over toasted and too crisp, the garlic too subtle and the cheese too scant. And then, both of ours Fresh Lime Sodas lacked lime and tasted predominantly of soda. 

The staff was really nice, and so was the ambience and it doesn't make me happy to mark down a newly opened place this low - but please, please don't serve burgers like that.

Had a brain freezer with an ice base and wow it was awesome! Beautiful ambience with affordable prices, one of the best places for hookah I must say

Kasba, being an area booming up with lots and lots of hang out joints, and fine dining options as well, its not quite hard nowadays to look for a place in the locality, to spend some time chilling out!!
And one such option happens to be the "Turning Point", which eventually justifies its name to some extent while one walks through the twists and turns of Rajdanga main road, a few minutes from "Acropolis Mall".

A nicely decorated interior, with cool application of lights and signage makes this cafe cum hokkah parlour, a peaceful yet charming place, where the owners Mr. and Mrs. Pental, welcomes everyone cordially, and are pretty hospitable to all the guests walking in!! 

However, on the other hand, the service team seems to be utterly confused and undertrained with sheer lack of professionalism. Huge improvement needed.

Coming to food and accompaniments, the taste is nice and descent, but way too overpriced if the quality and portions are taken into consideration. Management needs to look after this issue on a serious note.

Overall, a descent place to chill out!! But the scopes of improvement should be taken into note, so as to sustain in the competitive environment.

This cool Place is located near the ICAI at Kasba is a small gem which is to be found walking a long inside. 
Basically their food is very famous among the School and college students and that is the reason they have come up with this place which only 6 months old.
Reached there with some of my friends finding it with the Google map. A very cozy and cute looking place it is which is run by a cute and friendly couple. The ambiance is quite colourful with tables and sofa sitting arrangement. To make the experience better with the hookah they have kept the light a bit dimmer.
Tried few of their drinks in forms of Green Apple, Blue Sky and Fresh Lime soda. Green Apple was a great one very refreshing and tasted really well rather the two other drinks were pretty average. Tried one of their kebabs which is specially meant here only in the entire city named as Magazze Chicken Kabab. The fried chicken was coated with Magaz tasted decent. Later we tried the Cappucino as well that was also decent enough.
Service was really good, the guy serving was very polite and sound. So Thumps up and i wish them all the luck for the future. Cheers!

TURNING POINT serves tasty and yet light food. Its "Special Burger" is a must try item. In dessert "Monte Carlo" is my favourite. "Mutton Shammi Kebab" is a rare and yummy dish. Its definately a cafe no less than a restaurant.
Of course....the hookah, coffee, frappe and shake lovers shall not be dissappointed either....;))
Gr8 place to hang out!!

Such a cute little place! Been there twice in a week's place. The staff and owner is so warm and welcoming you'd love to go back again and again. 

Chicken fingers: the best is part they are made fresh. Crunchy on the outside and juicy inside . Burst of mild flavours with each bite. It is served with chips and ketchup. A must try ! 

Chicken shammi kebab : four huge pieces of kebab on a plate. Mildly flavoured and so very juicy you'd not want them to get over ! 

Potato nuggets and wedges : sufficient quantity and great quality . Served with ketchup. A must try for veggies out there .

Cappuccino: I judge a place by how they make their cappuccino and my judgement is pretty positive for them .

Chocolate shake: thick chocolate shake with chocolate sauce . Sufficient quantity and doesn't lack flavour. Love this !

Ive tried hookahs too and they were good as well.

What a lovely Cafe, amazing food and beverages and service and atmosphere, the ambiance was wonderful, 1st time tried Hookah and it was a pretty amazing experience. The  Chicken Shaami Kebab served here reminded me of the Lazzez Lucknowi kebabs. The seating arrangements are very comfortable along with beautiful music. You will definitely wanna try the Hookah there because of its funky names. Well looking forward to visit Turning Point again. :)

When I entered the place I noticed that it's quite spacious and the seating arrangements are really good... The music they play is nice and sets your mood.... Now coming to the food I ordered chicken shaami kebab along with a black current soda... I loved the shaami kebabs and the drink went with it well... I would try other combinations next time for sure... I ordered hookah their Turning point special... And was impressed.... The proximity to the acropolis mall and easy parking around the cafe makes this place a must visit if you're in the locality ..... I'm definitely going to visit the place  again this time with the whole group

Look they are not at all in a hurry... They are developing the place slowly... I'm a hookah lover, so I was pretty excited when I found these outlet so near by me... perhaps these one is the first place serving hookah in the area... but as I landed over there... I found it was not at all a hookah place... it was primarily a cafe and optionally serving hookahs... also the music was not going to the concept of the place... at first these make me feel little disheartened... but after starting conversation with Mr. Pental, who is the owner of the place my doubts beguns to clear... They mainly want to focus strongly on there food... they want it to make it a cafe where you can have hookah... so that everyone from old to young can come and spend a quality time over here... Also the retro kinda music they are playing was pretty intentional... yep to catch everyone's attention... They had quite a nos of very comfortable seating arrangements... They are working on there deco... but the hookah section was very well done... Hummm but you can have hookah at any part of the place no restrictions about that... So coming up to the food... I had...

♡ Mango ice soda»»» Very well prepared and extremely refreshing...

♡ Egg masala mini toast»»» Awesome... the egg was very well made and when it came over the crunchy toast... it becomes heavenly...

 According to Mr. Pental they didn't use dalda or any other animal oil... they use pure refined oil... Also he said that there kababs are not prepared in tandoors they used to have it on Tawa... that's why Tawa kabab... so I set to try one of them...

♡ Chicken shami kabab»»» These one is a hit... excellent in taste...  
I had tried one of there hookah too... forgot the name... but it was just ok... need to be work on that...

There staffs also need to be more trained... although there behavior was very good... and the service was good going too...

I really want it to give 3.5 but giving them 4.0... so that they can maintain there standards in food and also for motivating them to work on there other aspects where they are lagging...

Pocket pinch was very reasonable here...

Aaahhh.. In love with the concept of this café

 Liked the lighting and comfy colourful sitting arrangement. Place is so warm and welcoming.

The food to die for is the delicious TAWA Kebabs  and the Montecarlo dessert which is yummy. 

I loved the ambience and the latest collection of music  which really rocked the café.

They've got a good collection of hookah also.

Totally impressed with the Shisha, Food and Devils Own Frappe, all which does not pinch your pocket.

Overall it's a good place to hang out with friends and highly recommended for a date too!

Pros:

1. Prominent location behind Acropolis Mall

2. Good for hookah lovers

3. Nice decor.

4. Mood Lighting.

5. Tasty food.

6. Lovely Music

7. Priced very reasonable.

8. Friendly Staff

This place is situated very close to the Acropolis Mall near Ruby. The moment you step in, you will be completely taken by the atmosphere of the café. The decor and the setting are contemporary but cozy as well. The music along with the lighting give it an almost jazz like feel.
The best part about the café is the food. The kababs and the finger food ( especially the eggs on toast and the burger ) are amazing. The milk based drinks are a must try as well - overloaded with chocolate and ice cream and everything decadent!
The staff is very friendly and make sure your experience at the café is pleasant and they make a pretty mean hookah!
All in all the place is worth visiting at least once ( and by once I mean maybe a couple of hundred times 😉 ). A big thumbs up to this place!

Really great place to relax after a hard day at work. Kudos especially to the cool tracks that play in the cafe cum hookah bar from Adele's 'I'm gonna love you ' to John Mayer's 'Slow dancing'. A refreshing green apple soda and some fabulous hookah the cafe sure does make it easy to 'tune in to turning point'!

This is an amazing place to hangout with friends, comfortable ambience, extremely good music, lovely hookah and the best part is the FOOD!!!!!! the food here is different and refreshing. Please try the delicious kebabs, sandwiches and short eats, these go very well hookah or a smooth mocktail. Its also very reasonable and doesnt pinch the pocket at all.
A one of a kind place in Kolkata. :D :D :D
