Itz on my way so I frequently visit here.. I love the food quality.Being a freak about Sandwiches I really have a crush on them.So on my way home many a days itz the one stop solution for me.
The veg cheese one is really good..specially bcz they customize them according to u. Like I always prefer Green-chutney in sandwiches,so it is customized that way.

this is a very wonderful place for snacks.... healthy and sanitary requirements are strictly followed. Moreover, this variety of snacks available are pretty good... But price level too costly to offer for a snack time...

A small shop with very choosy menu in veg. Ordered one corn cheese sandwich for breakfast today. It is nice and tasty. The price is very much pocket friendly and the taste is very good as well.

Great taste at affordable price. Try the cheese corn toast sandwich. It's pretty tasty. The service is really quick. The best part is it's pure veg. Try their cheese burst pizzas as well.

I and my sister went here to grab a few snacks as we were really hungry .. I have visited this place for the first time and the people here are so humble ... We ordered Italian Vada Pav ... It was so delicious and loaded with cheese ( A must try ) ... Next we had Veg Maggi which was equally tasty ... Yes I would recommend to go for their milk shakes as they are really refreshing ... Neither too sweet not too heavy ... Moreover it is pocket friendly ... Loved the food ...

Today i ws going through zomato and came across this place. And then I thought of ordering something, so I ordered Supreme Veggie Pizza and Fusion pasta (little different taste). You can improve pasta‚Äôs taste. 
Both of the item were worth for money. The taste and quantity was enough to fill ur stomach. And a poctek friendly place for youngesters and the delivery was on time ü§óü§ó

Nice joint. Hospitable and friendly staff. Had a cheese corn sandwich, costing ‚Çπ50. It was tasteful, just toasted, served hot and fresh. It consisted of two full sandwiches (ie, the rectangular breads, not the half triangular ones.). Two full sandwiches, sauce and chips altogether at‚Çπ50.. Yup, value for money!üòé
