Situated near Sealdah BOI. One of the worst food corners. Provides you with fermented cakes and stale food. Neither the service is good nor the ambience. They really doesn't deserve this rating as well.

One of the worst services I ever received. We ordered a cake and was to receive today around 8 in the morning. When we reached there our order was delayed by four hours hence we decided to buy one of the cakes which was on the display. We bought two instead of one and they looked absolutely fresh but one of the cakes was fermented. We repeatedly asked them whether the cake was fresh and they went on telling that it's absolutely fresh. I have never experienced such bad service before. Really disappointed.

One of the worst experience... I taken home a lebeness roll and brownie... The roll was stale not at all edible... We had to throw it out... Also the brownie was hard like a stone... It's one of the busy place in the area... Nothing special about the ambience n service... The staffs are very mannerd though... But they obviously need to look after the quality of the products... The rating is only for the service boy who served all this with a smile...

Decoration of this place is too pathetic mainly the non veg corner  .  Foods they offer are average but they seriously need to improve their non veg corner .

Quantity is poor actually the main matter is quality is very poor... As well as the service is very bad . That's why I can't rate this restaurant above 1.5 out of 10.

Situated in Sealdah area..
Went there 4/5 times..
And each time I experienced some thing horrible..
Behavior of the owner is extremely bad...
Pestry is okay there.. but Cakes are not good..
Biriyani is average in taste.. Chowmin is okay type.. Once I ordered Kabiraji.. and It was something crispy ridiculous thing.. Totally wastage of money.. Dosa is also just average..

This place is situated near Sealdah station. The restaurant had different non-veg and veg sections in upstairs and downstairs respectively. I had vistited this place for a few times before and tasted their veg items like masala dosa, puri etc. The Dosa tasted pretty good as well as the puri. Today for the first time tried their non-veg section. Ordered half chicken fried rice and half boneless chilli chicken. Nothing to say about the ambiance. Prices are pocket friendly. The foods arrived after 15 minutes of ordering. It tasted just good nothing extraordinary. Though the gravy tasted good I felt that the chicken served was most probably not fresh as it was hard to chew. Never trying again the non-veg section. Giving 3 for only the veg items tasted before.

Some pieces of items are stale in the non veg section upstairs. They are cleverly mixed with fresh pieces. But the vegetarian section is still good. You can try dosa and ice cream downstairs to be on the safer side ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž

Situated beside famous suruchi and aviruchi snacks joint. This place sells roten pastries and bad cream cakes... But what they serve good is south Indian.... All south Indian dishes are good... Have tried their Chinese and biriyani also but they are not so good and bad for your gastronomy...

Their quality of food is very poor. They even sell stale sandwiches. The pastries are hard and tasteless. And i don't know why they call their pizza, which is full of onions only, as chicken pizza. So my advice to you is that if you want to stay healthy please avoid this place.

A very basic restaurant serving pretty average food. Came here once because we were too hungry to walk to a better eating joint. Had taken a basic chicken meal. Didn't like it much. But there were Sorbhaja and Gulab Jamun at the end. They were pretty good.

Located near Bank Of India , Bowbazar. 
Was really hungry so decided to give this place a try. It is spacious but not properly ventilated. Service is slow as well , ordered Steamed Rice , Dal and Chicken Curry. The Chicken Curry was extremely oily but tasted good. Try this restaurant if you have no other option.

I love this restaurant to the moon and back and whenever I cross sealdah I don't miss the chance to visit this place. Dosa is their speciality. The restaurant is extremely spacious as they have kept a separate sitting arrangements for veg and non veg foods. The price is really reasonable. Super like.

If u r so hungry, pocket pinch is low, n u don't have any other options.. Then u can go to this place. They have a so called multi cuisine restro at the first floor. Though many of the menus r not available. They possess a confectionery too,at the ground floor. During my stay of 4&1/2years at sealdah, I had their food for twice/thrice. What I remember is that the food was very much oily. Taste avg. Last night we bought a cake for birthday of a senior. It was not fresh, seemed rotten..It tasted sour n the smell was just terrible.. So an advice to u.. Try at ur own risk.. It z totally a gamble.. :-p

Probably a great quick bites location in the bustling Sealdah Station are. Yeah you can trust their quality. They have a confectioners howroom in the ground floor while a proper multicuisine restaurant in the 1st floor. The ambiance may not be pleasing but you can try this out if you are hungry and nearby.

Been here yesterday. 
well lit and arranged. 
since we were five in number, they made a pretty neat arrangement for us. 
we ordered two bowls of mixed fried rice and chicken fried rice along with Cantonese chicken.
the first thing about the rice-
absence of vegetables. 
second- scanty presence of chicken pieces and prawns.
on the positive side, the rice was light and wasn't oily. the quantity was good.
coming to the Cantonese chicken preparation, the taste was good. 
enough chicken pieces.
the gravy had a subtle taste although a little more in quantity would have pleased us.
the disappointing part was the presence of mushroom. we didn't expect to find mushroom pieces and when we did find, it led us to searching for some more. there was just 3 thin pieces of usual mushroom. 2-3 pieces of undercooked red and green capsicum, with scanty pieces of onions.
we ordered for hot garlic chicken to finish the rest of the rice. 
it wasn't hot nor sweet (which is the usual problem with garlic preparations). and finally, there was good amount of gravy. 
overall, the food took some good time to arrive. the staff was courteous and the food was really light.

I was coming back to Kolkata from Kashmir, & our whole family was hungry after the journey. We Reached Sealdah station and found this at the very edge of the street behind a watch shop. Now coming to the my review, the dishes which we had were awesome and also The worker working there were helpful. Moreover, it's also a cheap place. But only thing is that the place is very noisy and Not properly ventilated

Had been to this place while I had done work at sealdah . The place is amidst the crowded lanes and cramped up shops of sealdah. 

There is a seating area above which accommodates around 2-3 tables . We took our seat and ordered chole bhature and dahi papdi chat. Orders came in Abt 10 mins . Food was average  and so was the service . They should maintain more cleanliness which would be my only suggestion .
