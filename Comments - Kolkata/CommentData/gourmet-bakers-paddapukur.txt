This place is located opposite to Dugout near My Big Fat Belly otherway.
The entirely interior of this place seems to be well decorative with pretty decors. 
This place serves for a wide range of confectionery starting from cakes to kulfi's one can find.
We ordered for some Chilly cheese sandwich which was extremely good. The cheesy layer and the filling of veggies were too good.
You can also try out Strawberry milkshakes and oreo milkshakes which are quite amazing and great in tastes. Prices are reasonable. i personally liked the taste of strawberry milkshakes more though.
In chocolate section one can go for the Chocolate cone which is one of the RECOMMENDED and the Red velvet cakes. The cute red velvet i could rather say💗
One can opt for kulfi's . Try out the recommended watermelon kulfi's which is amazing i must say! The unique taste of the watermelon is rare in found in case of kulfi's.
There are other variant like mango,kesar,pan masala.
Had a wonderful experience and more than that I mood of getting some chocolate was fulfilled.

Would have given it a negative rating if there was an option.  Had called up the restaurant two days prior to the occasion to order a cake. They were supposed to be sending the cake at 5 in the evening but the cake came at 8. Wayyyy beyond the time.  All this after repeated polite calls from our side. Pathetic. Never ordering or visiting again.

I had visited gourmet baker's with a college friend for trying out desserts. We ordered the red velvet cupcake because of how delicious it looked. Unfortunately the taste was not at par with the appearance. The sponge was too dry and the frosting wasnt sticking to the cake. It just came off as soon as we dug our forks into it. The prices are high as well. For such prices I'd prefer going to cakes or cookie jar specially when the quality of pastries there are way better. The only plus point here is that the place is decked up well.

I am a big lover of desserts but this place is nowhere like it's name suggests . I liked the interior though. I tried there chocolate tart , rainbow cake , chocolate truffle and chocolate avalanche. All were very regular nothing exciting about the place neither the variety nor the taste. All over an average experience.

Didnt knw about this place.
Last sunday...wen i went to visit dugout..
But didnt get a place dere as it was over crowded just noticed this cute cafe at diagonally locatd to the resturant My Big Fat belly or just beside the dugout.
A cute little place..
But not much stock of food dere.
A very tiny place .
Hardly it can accomodate 8 people max.
Yeah they have great party cakes.. great design cakes.
For the place and the environment  it is more costly..

This bakery is located just opposite to the Dugout. We went in today and had a chocolate avalanche, brownie with ice-cream and a paneer patties. The brownie with ice-cream was very much average ( have tasted much better brownies elsewhere). The chocolate avalanche was very disappointing though. It looked beautiful but tasted just the opposite. I felt it wasn't fresh. Though the paneer patties was good.

The pretty little bakery shops around the city, happen to pull me a lot. Gourmet Bakers caught my attention the I day I'd gone to My Big Fat Belly and I had to make sure to drop by this place the next time.
So here I went, with a bunch of my friends and ordered a whole lot of sweet stuffs and savouries.

Appearance-wise it's a typical bakery shop with cute and colourful stuffs hanging from the ceiling. There are inedible themed cakes on display to advertise that they prepare themed-cakes as well.
Seating arrangement is an issue but the staffs are very friendly.

Food :
Mango Mojito - A very refreshing drink. There are tiny green mango bits which, on sipping, gives a sour taste.
Pina Colada - I always love anything that has a flavour of pineapple.
Oreo Shake - Topped with whipped cream, choco stick, an oreo and chocolate sauce, this shake was a clear winner. Heavenly!
Strawberry Shake - Too good! I was enjoying the strawberry crush which was a little sour as compared to the drink and was complimenting it.
Chocolate Cone - It was decent.
Oreo Cheesecake - It was more like a mousse and less like a cheesecake. But whatever it was, it tasted so good.
Matar Puff - While having too much sweet stuff, it was a wise thing to order some savouries for a change of taste. I liked the Matar Puff a lot. It was mainly a quiche.
Paneer Tikka Sandwich - Filling was full of flavours. Bread was crisp.
Paneer Chilli Cheese Sandwich - Happened to be my favourite one. It was spicy and leaves you wanting more.

I had an amazing experience. Definitely coming back to try their red velvet cupcakes which was on display and quite tempting!

Desert parlour cum bakeries have thronged most of Kolkata's lanes, but how many of them manage to actually satiate our cravings for a sweet tooth? Well just a handful of them maybe? Gourmet bakers surely makes their presence felt in this scenario!

This place brings alot of diversity to their menu which boasts of a number of lip-smacking delicacies ranging from the ever favourite oreo shake, the vibrant strawberry shake and if you have a sweet tooth for coffee, they have a caramel coffee shake too. Diversity, taste and quality - that's gourmet bakers for you.

This place surely won over my heart over its varied range of pastries, ranging from mango pastry, oreo cheese cake in a cup, chocolate corn, avalanche and not to forget the butterscotch mouse roll, give this one a try, rather give all of them a try, it would definitely leave you craving for more.

You thought this place just serves deserts? No not really, you could grab a quick bite too over here, they serve one of the best sandwiches ranging from matar puff, paneer sweet chilli to paneer chilli cheese sandwich, for the spice lovers mind you!

So still In two minds? I guess this review would clear your doubt to some extent, go for this place, it surely wouldn't disappoint you. Oh i forgot to mention! This place makes some of the loveliest cakes too.

Was around the area and looking for a place to have some desserts on the go. Spotted Gourmet Bakers and decided to drop in. Had the Oreo Cheesecake and the Strawberry Milkshake. The cheesecake was quite good- gooey chocolate and lots of whipped cream layered with yummy cheesecake with an Oreo on top ❤❤. The strawberry shake was thick and frothy. Upon learning that the store was about to launch Kulfi as a new part of their menu, they suggested to try some flavours of Kulfi. I tried the Pawn and Malai Kulfi. The paan was excellent and the Malai was good too. I would have preferred for the Malai one to be a little sweeter but I guess that's alright. They also have other flavours like strawberry and watermelon Kulfi which I am eager to try now. Good time spent with tasty desserts at a pocket friendly price ☺☺

Among the many things that they have to offer, I personally liked their Mango Mojito, Oreo Shake, Strawberry Shake, Oreo Cheese Cake in a Cup, Chocolate Cone and Paneer Sweet Chilli Sandwich the most. Besides these, you may want to try their Pina Colada, Caramel Cold Coffee, Mango Pastry, Butterscotch Mousse Roll, Avalanche and other sandwiches. Service here is good. Price is reasonable.

Gourmet Bakers is located just beside Dougout. I visited this place today and the experience was heavenly. Their pastries impressed me the most.
We had their Strawberry shake and Oreo Shake, both were delightful.
Then we had Mattar Puff and Panner Tikka sandwich and I would recommend you both as each of them were very good.
Then comes the better part. Loved their pastries. Oreo cheesecake in cup, Mango Pastry, Chocolate Corn and Avalanche. Each tasted better then the previous one. Each of my friends also liked them very much.
Prices are reasonable enough and service was good.
Will surely visit again.

Well lit, tiny place with good decor. The colourful kettles and chalkboards add to the quirkiness. I bought a red velvet cupcake, fresh fruit pastry and abalanche to home. The abalanche was simply awesome. Red velvet cake was in it's usual taste and fresh fruit pastry had a good portion of fruit filling within. I didn't remember the name of the bread.. Cheese garlic may be.. Can be served with good home-made dips..  I recommend both veggies and non-veggies with a sweet tooth to try it out

After having an icy dessert from Icy Fusion i visited this place and packed a brownie and chocolate truffle pastry. Before coming to the food, lets talk about the atmosphete and place. This place is located beside dugout,opposite  My Big Fat Belly. The place is brightly lit up.The behaviour of the staff was okhay. Coming to the food, i loved the brownie;crunchy on the outside and soft goey inside. I am in love with the brownie. Coming to the truffle pastry,this too was good; the pastry was dense and so chocolatey. 

Overall i loved these too products and would come to this place to try more.

Situated just beside The Dugout, this cute outlet offers the best cheese maggi i ever tasted. Very rich and creamy in taste and smooth in texture.They have a huge variety of cake and pastries which i am planning to taste on my next visit.

Their cakes look so amazing that you would think twice before you bite on them. The frosting bove the cakes are very innovative, though I think the lower cake portion is bit dry, could have been better. 
The place is very good, be it about food, ambience, service or decor. Interiors are very spacious and neatly done. 
I liked the double cheese sandwich and the also the cookie and cream milkshake with ice cream.

Gourmet bakers is amongst the newest eatery in the padmapukur area. I chanced upon the eatery one afternoon with a grumbling tummy... The decor of the place is French, and the red velvet cupcake I ordered was great!!! Soft and moist! The veggie puff was also good... Only problem for meat eaters like me is that the place is vegetarian! The price moderate! And it is rather good for quenching sudden hunger!

The person who packed dint have common sense. He packed the savories and the chocolate tart together in the same box. The tart became soggy and uneatable. Secondly the veg patties,the corn puff etc did not have enough filling at all. It seemed that we are just getting to eat the puff without anything inside. Pathetic and not gonna try the second time.avoid it guys.

Dropped into Gourmet Bakers a bit late one evening after dinner to meet the usual craving for some good dessert after a good meal. 

I had only a cupcake in mind since I was already quite full, but the initial miniature craving soon lead to a full on dessert demolishing experience, thanks to all the great offerings at Gourmet Bakers. 

We started off with the chocolate and the butterscotch cupcakes, bit our sweet tooth soon forced us to try some more things. The black forest pastry is soft and flaked with chocolates. While both the cupcakes and the pastry were very impressive what floored we completely was the brownie.

It is a magnum sized brownie, dripping warm chocolate sauce and topped with creamy vanilla ice cream. I can come back just for that. Nutty, chocolaty, fudgy, the brownie is immensely delicious.

We have some good to fine bakeries around the city of joy, but keeping aside the love for your favorite one there are lot of other places to check out for. I am talking about Gourmet Bakers located at Sarat bose Road, Chakraberia Crossing just beside The Dugout. After a mind blowing dinner dropped down here to try some of the delicious desserts that they provide. Though a bakery shop  they have made the ambiance worth a sitting for once. The staffs are very friendly and attentive. Coming to the main attraction the cakes, pastries and other items. Tried few of the cakes in form of butterscotch muffin, red velvet , praline pastry, black forest  and brownie with ice cream. Each and every one was bang on and meant business with their distinctive taste. I wish they open more of their outlets and serves these mouth watering stuffs all over.

After a sumptuous dinner with friends one day, came here for some desserts. Located diagonally opposite to My Big Fat Belly, this is a cute dessert place with a quaint white ambience. I loved the décor, presentation and the outlook of the whole place. Windows being converted to sitting areas, the ceilings, the lighting, everything was classy and elegant. Had the brownie with with ice cream. It was really good. The brownie was fudgy and nice with bits of walnuts. After a long time, I had such a good walnut brownie. Got home the praline pastry which was highly appreciated by my parents. I liked it as well. The chocolate was very good. The owner asked me to put that in the microwave for half a minute before having it. We did that for the praline pastry. It tasted very well. Recommended. Do give it a try. Happy Dining! :)

This boutique bakery is easy to locate at the left corner of Chakraberia - Sarat Bose Road crossing while entering Chakraberia road. Visited last Sunday evening to this boutique bakery. Like their ambience with an innovative idea of small quotes on slates hanging on the wall and the kettle style lamps with nice cozy seating arrangements. Bought red velvet muffin, chocolate truffle, strawberry mousse and muffin topped with butter scotch cream - which tasted very yummy with reasonable rates.

This bakery is located near The dugout in Paddapukur. I had gone to purchase pastries for a friend I was visiting for Diwali. 
The bakery has an attractive exterior and interior. 

The small slate boards with quotes hanging all over the cutesy bakery deserve special mention. I took chocolate tarts , brownies and the blackforest cups for my friend.

And chocolate tarts, red velvet and chocolate cupcakes for home. 

The prices are reasonable and at par with other bakeries. Taste wise the goodies except the red velvet cupcake were good but failed to impress me with any exception in taste.

The brownie was the best, the black forest cups were really fresh  the red velvet cupcake was a disappointment.

I had placed an order here through swiggy to try the chocolate tart but more importantly the Pina Colada! 

I had mentioned recently that I have not found a decent (Virgin) Pina Colada so far in the city but I think that's changed!

The Pina Colada here is pretty good! The flavours of both the pineapple and coconut are in perfect harmony! Something which I haven't seen anywhere. I loved it more so because I was just relieved to finally taste one which got the basics right! 

The chocolate tart was also pretty good! The tart shell was soft and crumbly. Perhaps a little too soft for my liking but good nonetheless. The filling was really good! I was quite happy with the tart as a whole. 

So in conclusion, this is definitely a place to try out if you happen to be anywhere around paddapukur! 

Happy Dining!!

This is a good place to satisfy your sweet tooth with the price being really reasonable. It is located exactly beside the Dugout ( Lansdowne outlet ). Was not aware about this place until one day while passing by I discovered this cute little bakery hut. 
It has a small sitting arrangement with an overall chic and neat look. The items are freshly baked and the sandwiches and mocktails  are made then and there. 

What I have tried : 

Coleslaw Sandwich.
Chocolate tart.
Watermelon Mojito.
Chocolate bowl with nuts and brownies.
Chocolate muffin.

Got a black forest and a chocolate avalanche packed for my sister. Was in a super hurry and the cab was waiting so they packed it super quick. Thank you for that.
The black forest was really nice and tasty. Priced at rs 50 this is a good option.
The avalanche is rs 70 a piece and had rum inside it I think. It was a chocolate bowl with nuts and chocolate mousse inside.
Could be made better.
The interior is clean and lit well.
Was surprised to see a cake shop open at 10:15 pm  in the night. So kudos for that. Prices are decent.

There are some long tiring days after which you just want to snuggle up in your bed and indulge yourself with sweet treats.Today was like that for me.Hence I went through some dessert places in Swiggy and found this bakery enlisted there.They are also providing 15% discount for ordering via Swiggy.I ordered a brownie and a red velvet cupcake.

Brownie-This was under recommended dishes in Swiggy.It was one of the best I had in a long time.It had that perfectly fudgy consistency with crunchiness from loads of nuts in it giving it a great texture.I heated it a bit and what can be a better comfort food on a rainy evening.I loved it to the fullest.

Red velvet cupcake-The size was big.Frankly at first site I was turned off by the too much brilliant red appearance of this cupcake.It had buttercream frosting instead of cream cheese which I prefer in a red velvet cupcake.I dared to take a bite.The cake was moist but the taste was average..I had much better red velvet cupcakes in other places.Moreover as I was biting into it the red hue inside was more artificially bright type which made it very unappetising to eat forcing me to waste almost half of the cake.Its understandable why it wasn't recommended.

It's better to stick to chocolate based desserts here(I saw them being recommended in Swiggy).Doesn't burn a hole in your pocket at all.

A newly opened bakery in a city which still lacks behind in terms of French baking. This outlet is located at paddapukur, right at the landsdowne,- bhawanipur junction ( near dugout).
The outlet is relatively spacious with three tables for people looking to chit chat over snacks and desserts. 
The bakery is done in subtle shades of white with a colorful ceiling display and cute blackboard messages.
On display are cupcakes, pastries, mousse and some saviory snacks. They also stock fresh breads and other bakery produce. 
They also have a menu offering sandwiches and mocktails.
I sampled their praline pastry and the chocolate avalanche.
While the former was good, I was missing the crunchiness of praline in the pastry.
The chocolate avalanche came loaded with mousse, chocolate sauce, peanuts and choco chips. 
What's more? The entire cup is edible.
Overall both the items were good.
I was eyeing on the cupcakes which looked amazing.
The owner was extremely warm and personally attended to us.

PROS- location, pricing, taste
CONS- lack of innovation, lack of many options ( may add some fruit based like peach, orange or passion fruit)

Nonetheless, a good outlet!

I accidentally stumbled on this place after a class and decided to have breakfast here. The decor is very nice and I love the big windows, but the food was unfortunately not impressive. The strawberry Mousse was probably the best of the bunch, nicely creamy although too sweet, with the shake being the worst due it's really thin consistency. There's not a lot of seating so better only stop for a quick bite. No bathroom either, but then again, it's a bakery, not a cafe.

With recent increment in bakeries in Kolkata here comes a new name called Gourmet Bakers.

Located at Sarat bose road near Landswone this one is a quality bakery option in this area.

Best part about this place its they serve you very fresh and quality products.
Tried their red velvet cake which was tasty and the cream used in it is not too buttery at all which I liked.
Also they have a wide range of variety in pastries ,cakes and savouries as well.

Located at a very prime location on sarat bose road(beside dugout).
A small outlet but has a lot to offer, great italian decor and lip smacking pastries and gateaux cakes. Most importantly it is purely vegetarian. The best service that they offer is that they give home delivery at midnight and the outlet is open till 1 at night so its easy to get cakes on birthdays and anniversary @ 12'o clock at night. Surely a nice way to surprise your loved ones.
"Red velvet" , "brownie" & "truffle cake" is a must try.

A neat and cute bakery at the Chakraberia crossing. Very very close to Dugout. A pretty red and white awning and glass windows make this bakery look like it's right out of a fairytale! 😊 Full marks for utilization of the small space. Who would've expected to also make comfortable seating arrangements at such a small joint. Good job! 👍 Plus the chairs and tables are constructed next to the glass windows which is again a plus.

Coming to the food...it shall certainly not disappoint you! They've got pastries, sandwiches, coffee, shakes and brownie with chocolate ice-cream. 🍧 You can also pick up varieties of breads to take home. 🍞 It's a pure vegetarian joint. The pastries are reasonably priced. The red velvet pastry is a must-have. 🍰 It's not at all over-sweet and is soft and nice! It's open till late in the night. You've got other options for pastries around such as Skyline and Krrazy for Chocolates at Forum. But, if you're looking for a place to hangout with your cousins or buddies over brownies and pastries, this will prove to be more convenient esp because of seating options (privacy is nil though). They also have birthday cakes. The staff is courteous goes almost without saying. They can play some soft soothing music to make the experience even better. However, since, it's very very close to my office, I'm sure I'll be back here many more times. Plan a weekend outing with your close buddies and watch the rain pour outside as you nibble on some warm brownies and take a sip of the heavenly coffee. (Me not a big fan of coffee though) ☕ Life's good! 😊

As soon as I entered I fell in love with this place.In all honesty,I  have never come across a place that lures you with just the aroma of their pastries,cakes and shakes.So you can definitely brace yourselves for what will be hitting your tongue once you order your flavour of sin.The thing I loved about the place was interior.Next thing that I will really appreciate is the fast service. Overall this place is really worth going. That red velvet shake made my day. ❤️❤️Awsome place,awesome food and awesome service!!!!

This is the first outlet Of Gourmet Bakers in Calcutta ...A perfect cute place giving a distinct Italian look and feel to the way the interiors are done here in white , wit a prominent slate board effect ..The ambiance somehow gave me a royal feeling :) ! The seating arrangement , the appropriate lightings and definately the decoartion is worth complementing! Its one of those joints in south calcutta whose business model is all about taste and clientele ..This place is a pretty decent place to satisfy one's sugar rush craving , only because its  desserts are simplly awesome .. One shud not come out without tryng the red velvet  n praline pastry and the red velvet shake and oreo shake .. They are simply awesome ....they have large variety of desserts ...Worth tastng .. The staffs and the owner are pretty friendly .. A place worth visting ❤️Had a great experience ❤️

Located exactly at the Lansdowne-Chakraberia crossing, this new bakery is located within a stone's throw from my office. This place is like an oasis amidst the local Gujarati eateries, Bengali sweet shops and expensive sandwich joints. This is by far the best thing that has happened to this place in the last one year. Adjacent to The Dugout Restaurant, if you are coming from South, this bakery is at the next traffic signal from the Paddapukur crossing. Although this is place is located almost in the middle of Netaji Bhavan and Rabindra Sadan Metro Stations, but I think Netaji Bhavan is closer and will save a few minutes of walking if you are well aware of the shortcuts from the Jadu Bajar exit.

This used to be a smartphone store previously. So when they shut down the store and started renovating the place, we kept our fingers crossed! Good things come to those who wait! The Skyline Confectionery is within a five minutes walking distance, but considering their stock, they are no match to the Gourmet Bakery. From the first look, it resembles a bakery in Boston or Texas. Remember those pretty and nicely decorated bakery photos you save on your Pinterest boards? This has a similar look and feel!

The staff here are polite and well mannered. This is a turn-on for any customer! Make your customers feel important and they will return. Even though it still got the shine and luster of a new bakery; but their decorations are strikingly distinctive. Especially the quotes and sayings on the walls using chalky fonts and those colorful kettle turned lamps hanging from the ceiling. I did not expect seating arrangement inside as the store is not very spacious, but they have managed to squeeze 3-4  seats, that too right by the large glass windows. Full marks here!

We ordered their Red Velvet Cake, Brownie with Ice cream and Chocolate Truffle initially. I would recommend the Red Velvet Cake; it's their specialty and when we visited the place there were just 2 pieces left in the counter. Most of the pieces are within 60 - 90 rupees which is slightly expensive but if your let your taste buds speak, the price is worth it! Although each pastry item isn't expensive, the bill can rack up easily if you are visiting as a group or purchasing a large amount.

We had never-ending queries about the flavors and toppings, but the people behind the counters answered all our questions patiently and politely till we decided what to order. The counters looks great, filled with displays of baked deliciousness. What's missing to me is labels and pricing. I couldn't find that other than the menu cards.

When we were about to leave, someone from the counter came right to me and asked politely what do I think of the place, the decorations and food. Upon seeing a satisfactory smile on most of our faces, he looked happy. This place to dangerously tempting and way too good for my waistline. Everything I expected and more! Go ahead, put it on your bucket list.
