This is a shop serving really good sweet delicacies. Being a sweet-tooth I am usually aware of all the places serving good sweets in this city. But this brand was not known to me. Hence, I was actually surprised when I started tasting the items we had ordered from here. We had ordered Dahi Vada, Radha Ballavi, Samosa, Gulab Jamun, Veg Stuffed Kachori, Ice-cream Sandesh, Butterscotch Sandesh, Nolen Gurer Sandesh. The Dahi Vada, Veg Stuffed Kachori, Gulab Jamun and the Butterscotch Sandesh are a must try. The other items were good too, but the abovementioned 4 items were extremely good. The Dahi Vada was one of the best items and certainly better than that of many other more renowned sweet shops. The Veg Stuffed Kachori was very delicious and quite filling. The Radha Ballavi was a little dry due to the dry alu sabzi served along with it, but there was no compromise with the taste of it. Hence, you would love that too. The Gulab Jamuns were fresh and when served hot, they taste heavenly. If this dish is being served to you cold then make it a point to ask the concerned person to warm it up. This place flaunts many innovative sweets and Ice-cream Sandesh and Butterscotch Sandesh are two of the new sweets in that category. Both were very tasty but the Butterscotch one tasted slightly better to me. 


A pocket friendly place with sweets of good quality are served. Do try the must-try items that I have suggested, you won't be disappointed.

Jalajoga is fine sweet shop in chandni chowk area. Visited couple times for a quick bite. The place is small but the  decor of the place is very nice, the place is clean and hygienic. No seating arrangement is there. Varieties of  sweets are available and sweets  are fresh and tasty. Delicious snacks like puri, singara, chaats are also available. Amriti and amsatto  sandesh were very delicious. Pocket pinch is reasonable.  Overall a good place to have some sweets and snacks.

Jalajoga is a sweets and snacks store which is opened in collaboration with Mio Amore. This outlet is located very near Central Metro Station, a few shops after Mio Amore. As the place is close to mine I keep visiting here and trying foods.
Here are are the things you should try:
• Vegetables Stuffed Kachuri : Very good in taste.
• Mango Patties : This is a sweet which has mango layer between the sweet.
• Dhokla and Dahi Bada : Both of them are excellent to taste. I often visit here for the Dahi Bada.
.
Well these are just few. There are other items too which taste really good. Prices are very reasonable.

Jalajoga is a part of  Mio amiore.It is located beside Mio Amore store beside Central Metro. I visit here often as it is close to my house. I have tasted their Kaju Bari, Rosogolla and many other sweets from here. Sweets are good in taste. But I think a bit can be improved. Prices are also reasonable as their quality is fine. And the new thing you will get their baked rosogolla.It tasts amazing.I often try here Dahi bara,which is perfect blending of sweet and sour.And you will love this one.Best part is Each item here never compromise with their quality.

Has been waiting for this to get listed for so long and finally it is done. Went to this place months ago when it was newly opened. Located just next to the Central Metro station beside the Mio amore Shop. 
I met the owner itself and he told about the place and what to try. We tried the Dahi Vada and one patties as well. Dahi Vada was quite good and dont properly remember about the patties as it was long ago.
