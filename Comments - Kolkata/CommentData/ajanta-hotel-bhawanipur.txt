Had no clue that this place was zomato reviewed!!!

very normal a place with very normal food! There is no way I can think of this place if I am in Bhawanipore and I want to satisfy my hunger...

The only thing good about this place is hanging out with friends over a cup of tea and a chitchat!

This is a small eatery in bhowanipore which serves great tadka and dal makhani. Please do not focus on the service, but only on the food.
Try the butter tadka and dal makhani with tandoori roti and then a cup of tea.

The alu paratha is pretty decent as well.

If you aren't very hungry, you should definitely try the chowmein or the Momos. They are very good too.

Ajanta Dhaba has been a part of my life since my childhood and I have seen it grow from a humble dhaba to a restaurant which is still popular after more than 25+ years of its existence. Their tadka is to die for and has been their trademark item since long. They have started serving several other items out of which I did like their noodles and pav bhaji. A great place to have vegetarian food at budget friendly rates.

Good food and pure veg dhaba... Ajanta is a landmark today in bhowanipore as it is the only Punjabi dhaba that is pure veg. The food is great and lives up to the dhaba style. Service could be better but is great for a dhaba . AC on the first floor only and seating is comfortable and cozy. Must try the Shahi paneer , even though you won't find it on the menu order it and it will be served. It's thick juicy soft pieces of paneer in a tomato based creamy gravy.

Located amidst the lanes of Chakraberia bhawanipur, this vegetarian food joint is one of the best places for college students like us!
They serve the best tea(P.S : if you are a smoker, team it up with a smoke and you'll be highly satisfied)

They also make some lip-smaking snacks like samosa which goes well along with a cup of tea.
Coming to food, I haven't yet tried the Chinese dishes but the North Indian cuisines are pretty tasty. Also, the prices are pretty much affordable.

Tired of Jai Hind dhaba round ups. Land here and u will see d difference. From eating noodles sitting outside by the stove to savouring north Indian dishes upstairs,everything is so good about the food they serve here. A regular and crowded hangout place for the locales and a chit chat zone for the friends this place has heard many a stories. They serve the best tea in the locality and also the best of memories. No ambience to tell u about but the food speaks for them. The staffs are so cool and friendly too.
Love visiting this place everytime.

Not worth spending your bucks.
Only Tadka is tasty and worth your money. Also veg thali is quite good.
The place is not at all value for money. 
I have tasted almost all the items from this place since its in my neighbourhood.
And literally even the fried rice cooked in the stall beside restaurant is tastier and less oily. Also the decor is not good. The place remains crowded with localities.

Special Butter Tarka, Kashmiri Aloo Dum and Veg Mongolian are the best of the vegetables and curries in the menu. Quick service and good staff. Quantity enough for 2 people.

Well, this place deserve a mention from me as there are loads and loads of memories and its one of my regular visiting place. This is one of those places where I love going because of few reasons:
#The adda ambience is just too good: You will see groups of every age sitting there with a cup of tea and having a lovely adda session

#The tea here is just lovely: Well, if you are here what you should do is order a tea for yourself and enjoy it. I love their tea.

#Memories: Well, I love this place because its too good a place to bring my moments back.

Location:
Chakraberia- Paddapukur crossing and you will get this place. And if you are confused and don't know much about this place the Zomato map is there to help you out.

Service:
Fast. The behaviour is good from the staffs.

Food:
You can go for few of their lovely dishes. It is a vegetarian place which I mostly avoid, but its good enough to attract me again and again.
They make some good snacks like Samosas. The tadka here is just too good. Avoid the chowmein to be honest. The paneer recipes are worth trying.

Quality and Quantity , Pricing:
Quality is good.
Quantity is lil less.
Pricing is reasonable without tax.

Last word:
A really good place where you would get so many things in a very reasonable price.

3.5/5 for this place

This is a roadside Punjabi Dhaba style restaurant located in Bhawanipur and it not for good ambiance seeker or sophisticated people. It is a small food hub with very average food & services. I had disappointed too much while taking breakfast here with there foods. I can recommend this Dhaba for its Tea only which is fresh n hot everytime, You can enjoy it's hot tea in a Kulhar (earthen port) in roadside.

Located in Bhawanipore.
Had been there with one of my friends. The two hungry souls ! Found this on our way.
The ambience is okayish. And the seating arrangement should be made more comfortable. The place is a bit small.
However the turning point was their food and the service.
We had ordered the thali and liked it.
 This place should be noted when you don't want to burn hole in the pockets and at the same time would like to gorge on food. Give a try ! 
But there are rooms for improvements, keep working on it. :)

USP: tasty food, timings and location. Tea and food tastes excellent. If you are with guy friends then would recommend to dine in the hotel. But if you are with family then do a takeaway. They parcel it well and you can enjoy food at home. They can work on their ambience but don't think it is a deal breaker. With the low price that they charge it's all worth it. Thanks for the tastieee Punjabi food.

This place never seems to disappoint us in terms of  providing delicions north indian food. However being a dhaba there does arise a question of hygienic ambience which the hotel should work upon. Nobody likes to see a cockroach even in the farthest corner while eating butter nan and dal tadka. 😝😝

✔Delicious food. Go for north Indian even Chinese is good.
🚫The hotel needs to work upon Cleanliness

Location: Near the Four-Way roundabout of Paddapukkur-Chakraberia Road.

This age old hotel can be reached either by traveling across the lane adjacent to Netaji Bhawan Metro Station (through Jadubabur Bazaar/Jaggu Bazar) or by traveling straight for a few minutes in the lane opposite to Forum Mall. 

This hotel has been here for years and has been serving its customers with great food throughout. 
The AMBIANCE here is nothing but, a chair-table arrangement. It is a Ground+Mezzanine type hotel wherein the mezzanine is an air-conditioned dining area. The stairs to the mezzanine are quite steep and is also a testament to the age of the ‘purely vegetarian’ hotel. 
The hotel needs a makeover though, bole toh renovation, a bit not much!

About the FOOD, I visited this place over lunch (a bit late though, thanks to work which also made me super hungry) and ordered the following:

- Special Butter Tarka
Black lentils cooked overnight and tempered with tomato and butter, bole toh makhan wala tadka. Delicious!
Recommended.

- Tandoori Butter Roti
Crisp Tandooris brushed with generous butter.

- Garlic Naan
The Naan here got a reaction from me, that was, “O teri, Yeh toh stuffed hai re!”. Yes, here, the garlic isn't on top of the bread, instead is stuffed inside the Naan. A twist, yet no compromise on the taste. 
Recommended.

- Papad
Perfectly baked. Needs no description though.

- Onion Salad
Needs no description. Does it? Yes, was fresh. :)

The SERVICE was prompt and the well-informed STAFF was polite and friendly.

The COSTS wouldn't burn a hole in the pocket. 

Overall a good place to drop in! :)
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due.

Ajanta hotel is a dhaba situated in paddapukur,near the crossing(close to the petrol pump).I am particularly fond of their paneer pasinda and kashmiiri aloo dum.There's is an all vegetarian affair and my father has many a times got food home from this place. The food has always been good,though sometimes inconsistent.Their special noodle roll and lassi are worth mentioning and so is the dal makhni with buttered nan. Cheers to good food :)

Long Long Long Pending Review! 

This is a Pure Vegetarian Dhaba! A No Frils place the serves up some of the most amazing dhaba food I have ever had....!
You could easily miss this place as it is tucked away in a lane in bhawanipur, and looks extremely shabby from outside!

My experience with this place started 15 years ago.... you read it right 15 years ago .... just out of college had started with a job ... and this was a good place for a rendezvous.... especially when you have told at home that you are still at office but you are actually out for a dinner ;) .... the reason I say the place is ideal is because you are sure to never get caught ..... ;)

Well but the food definitely is some of the best dhaba food ... post moving to Bangalore, whenever I am at Calcutta I do pack food from here for atleast one meal.... I would recoomend you order for car service because the ambience is pretty poor and you wouldn't really like even the A/C part of the restaurant... 

Here is what I ordered when I was at Calcutta and this is the lis tof things he never messes up on:
1. Masala Kulcha really soft and the right amount of fluffy.... and butter Naan (gets rubbery If you are going to take Away)
2. Paneer Butter Masala / PAneer Pasinda and Paneer Badsha
3. Dal Makhani
4 Stuffed Capsicum

Oh yes he also has a paneer Tardka Fry which is Dal with Paneer - this is also finger licking good! 

Well on food 20 / 10 
on ambience 1 / 10
Service 9 /10
Value for money 10/10
overall 9 / 10

I cant think of an alternative to this place in Calcutta - yes you have the bigger dhabas the azad hinds and gurudwara etc .. but this guy is truly amazing in terms of taste and service....  Also the food is not too oily like the other dhabas I wouldn't call it health food but much lesser on impact as compared to others... 

Do remember his lassi and also there is not a list of Rolls available looked good but never tried...

I would keep visiting here whenever at Calcutta!

They serve pure veg food and is a very old hotel and provides food basically for the people living in PGs nearby. 

I had tried chowmien roll(speciality) , sizzling hot dal makhani, paneer butter masala with naan and roti. =====
Pros:-
1) food is hygienic 
2) quality of food is decent not too oily
3) ambience is well...ok. 
4) service is quick
5) decently priced 

Cons:-
1) ambience can be improved and renovation required
2) can provide a better and a quicker service. 

:) chowmien roll is a must try

17th june 2014 - went here with couple of my friends. Ordered Dal, Aloo do pyaza, and even Chilly paneer with Butter Roti and tandoori Roti. All were superb. We went near 1 am. One of the oldest dhabas and pure VEG!

2016 - On my visit recently, i had chowmien roll and thali. The chowmien roll was consistently the same. The thali was filling and satiating. Must try.
