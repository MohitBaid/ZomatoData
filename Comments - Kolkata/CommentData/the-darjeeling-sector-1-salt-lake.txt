Are you finding a very pocket friendly restro ? Okay! Here it is. I often visit this place & do love their ambience to food. Being a fan of tibetian food I will choose this place over any top rated restro. Everything is much perfect here.

Well i finally decided to review this place after visiting it so many times. 
Stationed bang opposite city centre 1, this joint serves some amazing set of Chinese and Tibetian Dishes. 
We'll usually when i am here. I try out their. 
Red Pepper chicken,  Chicken Lollipop, Garlic Pork and Chilli Pork. 
Well the pork dishes here are undoubtedly the star performers.
A pork lovers den for sure. 
So if you've got a bunch ready to spare some bucks over some good food and pork as well you should be here. 
This place definetly gets a ' Must visit' tag from me.

Visited the outlet twice, the last being for lunch on 31st December last year. Had to wait for sometime as all the tables were occupied already. With good English music and dim lighting, the ambience was nice and inviting. Ordered Hongkong rice, Chilli garlic noodles and Fish mandarin for the two of us alongwith cold drinks. Food both in terms of quality and quantity stood out. And the good part is that this comes without a considerable pocket pinch. Overall a satisfying experience and would look forward to come back again for sure.

On the ground floor of Gorkha Bhavan, Sector 1 stands Darjeeling with it's mesmerising Chinese and Thai spread. Honestly it needs to and moreover deserves to be much ahead in terms of it's current rating on Zomato keeping in mind the value for money and quality of chinese served. The seating area is quite small and cosy for around 25 people to be seated at once, ordinary d√©cor. We had to wait for around 20 minutes to grab a seat given a 31st Dec afternoon. I went for a plate of my favourite dry chilly pork which tasted amazing. The pork was delicious, 8 pieces @200 was a stellar deal. So was the hot garlic fish dry. Service was fast, prices are on the cheaper side and there's no tax section on your final bill. No wonder this place is always stuffed with people, Darjeeling makes you come back for more!

This place is in a building where no one would think this can have such an amazing treasure inside it. They serve amazing chilli pork and pan fried momos which one must try. Apart from the amazing food, the place has kind of good decor as well and it would be nice if your looking for a cheap lunch with friends or a quiet date with your girlfriend with some old school rock music which is constantly on their speakers.

My old school friends and I had gathered here for a winter reunion dinner after having heard of this place from others. Finding it wasn't that difficult.
There were seven of us. Six reached early together and one came late. The ambiance was nice and the managers (probably owners) were extremely polite, helpful and ever-smiling. Due to the crowd, there was quite some delay in taking the order. We had Mixed Meifoon, Mixed Schezwan Rice, Mixed Singapore Rice, Double Fried Pork, Chicken Rangmatang, Pork Shapta (dry), Chilli Pork (gravy) and Chilli Garlic Pork (gravy). I really liked all the dishes especially the pork and chicken side dishes. The quality of meat was really good. But I expected more of a spicy kick to the Pork Shapta and Chilli Pork.
There was some inconvenience since cash and Paytm were only mode of payments and so we had to access the nearby ATM to get the cash. Overall the price and everything was quite reasonable as per@ a middle-class pocket in Salt Lake.

The place is specially known for its north eastern cuisine. I visited this place for lunch and was pretty impressed by the restaurant. Starting from the interiors to the service, everything was standard and upto the mark. Do not expect too much of premium services. The food was good. If you want to try pork or duck meat, this place is a nice option. I ordered Mixed Singapore Rice with Chilli Duck. Both the items were tasty and praiseworthy. The chilli duck was slightly on the saltier side or else it would have tasted better. Overall, I can give this place a 3.5 star rating.

This was my first time here. Visited with my parents on this Christmas' eve. Had to wait for half an hour which was inevitable, considering the occasion. But the wait was worth it. All of the items ordered, were super delicious. Quantity and quality both are great. Service is pretty quick and the staffs are also friendly.

Food ordered: Chicken steamed momo, wings on fire, capsicum and ginger rice, mixed hakka noodles, hot garlic chicken.

Ambience: So-so. The place is not very spacious but the food is great!

It's absolutely pocket friendly. 
Thumbs up to this place! üëç

You may find difficulty to locate the restaurant. But it's better to go with the landmark as mentioned in the address. But at reasonable price you can enjoy their dishes. The service is very good and the manger was well behaved. We ordered wings of fire which really satisfied my tastebuds as I was desperate to order something crispy and juicy. It was really awesome. Then we ordered Kung pao chicken with chicken pork prawn rice. The rice was cooked perfectly with the key ingredients. It was the first time I tried pork. But the fear won successfully as pork did not trouble at all. Will visit again to try their other dishes.

Nothing special about the ambience rather you may find it a bit dingy.But we found this tiny food joint which is actually the part of the canteen of Gorkha Bhawan as the only place in the city serving authentic Tibetan food .Apart from regular chicken momos we tried  chicken thukpa,Shaphalays and Shapta and all had that touch of perfection that we found only in Kunga (at Darjeeling)and in Snow lion(at Gangtok).Service is a kind of easy going type as staffs are courteous but not very professional .We were enjoying it as it was kindling the  memory of our Darjeeling and Sikkim trip.Not Only 
they don‚Äôt charge GST but also the original pricing is very low for every item specially considering the taste and the quantity they are offering. So this hidden gem is a must  try to taste the flavour of the hill while being in the city.

This place remains close to our hearts, and have been dropping by since 2011-12 maybe. Previously named as The Blue Poppy (not sure whether it belongs to the same owner or not), The Darjeeling is the best place to have Tibetan dishes in Saltlake. One of those places where the Zomato ratings never go above 3.5, still remains to be one of the popular ones. 

Situated on the ground floor of Gorkha Bhavan, bang opposite to Farina Bar, The Darjeeling has always been dimly lit with hardly space for 25 people, but you won't feel cramped. You will find a TV hung up on the wall, and a small passage which leads to a basin (bathroom isn't available). 

Much like any other Tibetan place, their pork dishes are amazing to say the least. Pork Thukpa and Pork Kothay will always remain on our menu, occasionally we tend to order Shyaphalays while Chilly Babycorn is succulent and sufficient among veg starters. Mixed meifoon and Chilly Dry Pork, an excellent combination although you will find a lot of bacon and little meat at times. In poultry, Devil's wine Chicken and Chicken in Black Bean sauce are two delicious dishes. They have day by day specials as well written on a white board. 

Always easy on the pocket and ready to satiate your hunger, The Darjeeling is the real deal in Saltlake, and you just cannot miss out on it.

The Darjeeling,sounds more like a tea bar than a Chinese restaurant but thankfully it is the later. Situated in Gorkha bhavan near city centre 1 it's a bit hidden from plain sight but not that much difficult to locate.after listening many a going gaga over this joint I finally decided to put it to test.
Ambience- nothing flashy or extravagant. Very simple and cosy. The dim lights add nicely to the aura and smell of great Chinese food. Seating is also very basic but overall not a bad endeavour on the part of management.
Food- ok easily one of the best Chinese food I have had the privilege to have in our fair city. Though I didn't get much to try but the chili garlic noodles were bang on target and the pork is soft and succulent and well cooked. the food had a character of their own which they screamed loud and clear. So in short food is amazing.
Service- very basic not bad neither good. The servers were gracious enough but the personal touch which usually makes ppl more feel at home was missing. So overall warm enough environ.
Price- dirt cheap is the word for it. The prices are in similar vein to blue poppy. U can eat Ur heart out for as little as 500 INR.
So what are you waiting for just rush to here to satiete Ur Chinese hunger. Overall double thumbs up from me.

Went there few days ago,for lunch.I heard a lot about their pan fried chicken momo so we started with that.and I think it was one of the best panfried momos I ever tasted,a perfect mixture of tangy,sweet and sour flavour.then we ordered chicken Mongolian fried rice and hot garlic duck..the rice tasted good but the duck was below avarage.there are 6pcs of duckmeat,with bone and the bone parr is maximum in account of meat.
The good thing about the resturant is its tax free.the staffs are polite and very decent.the decor is nice.though the duck was quite  disappointing but all the other foods they serve are in good amount and tasty..so I give it 4.5 rating over all.

Much like the blue poppy these chinese joint is set inside a guest house..With a variety of noodles ,pork  ,dimsums and a lot of Tibetan and Sikkimese dishes. The thukpa is amazing so is the meifoon. The garlic pork served hot is my favourite side..And the pork momos are soft and infused with great flavours. 
Located just opposite the city centre mall in slatlake..Save the parking options not much of an hassle about its placement. The service is slow but homely. And honestly it's worth the money you are spending(comparetively cheaper than the other joints.)..
If you have been to kunga's in darjeeling you might fall in love with this place.

Ambiencewise a cosy comfy little place..with low illumination giving u the uphill vibes..
Started off with pan fried chicken momo..well..had better ones of course..but this one was above average..juicy..full of meat..tossed in a perfecrly balanced sauce..loved it..
Then..chilli pork dry..well
Big pieces of extremely soft well cooked pork..tossed in a gravy of capsicum chilli and onions..i loved the pork..but..wait this was not exactly wat we expected wen we ordered chilli pork dry..however i loved the meat..
The 8 treasure soup was pretty average..less chicken..tasted a bit bland..
The hakka chicken noodles was good..as it was meant to b..liked it..
The cantonese chicken chowmein was good with all veggies balancing the flavours of the noodles..
Now..a big disappointment..we orderdd hot garlic duck..the dish was perfectly cooked..but somehow i felt i was having chicken only...not duck..
Overall a nice experience from my side..

A very pocket friendly option for the students. The place is too clumsy I felt! The place was averagely decorated as you can find these lights in nearly every restaurants nowadays. There was a white board which displayed their special dishes for the day. Had the Mixed Mangolian rice with Pork, Mixed Hakka Noodles with Pork and the last and the horrible part, the Smoked Chicken. We ordered Meifoon at first but had to shift to Hakka Noodles because after few minutes they reported that Meifoon was not available. The Mixed Hakka Noodles had a regular taste. The Mixed Mangolian Fried Rice was too spicy which I loved though because I love spicy dishes. The only thing which I disliked was the excess amount of largely diced cucumbers, broccolis,bell peppers,capsicums and other vegetables in it. They were too much in quantity than the rice. The most disppointing dish was the Smoked Chicken which had just no taste of smoke in it and moreover there were shredded chicken pieces instead of solid ones and was overpriced also. But yes don't forget to try the Saunf at the end that was too good. The best thing about this place is it is tax free and budget-friendly.

I have been here several times but forgot to pen my thoughts on this place. It's a place where you should stick to snacks only. Quality starters available at very reasonable price. I have tried their chicken steam momo, mixed thukpa, Mixed noodles and red pepper chicken. All of those were nicely cooked,the red pepper chicken was a bit extra spicy.
 Above all, The chicken steam momo is something that makes this place very special. This is the only place where the momo tastes exactly similar to what we get at the hills of Sikkim. So a recommended pocket friendly place for momo and great starters!

We ordered :Chicken Fried Rice (just beacuse the Chicken Noodles was already finished) : Good taste, non-spicy, great in quantity.Chilli Chicken and Schezwan Chicken : Okayish. But, the size of the chicken pieces was not at all satisfactory.Chilli Pork : Good taste. But felt like the pork was fully boiled or cooked; it was hard while having it.Very slow service.Friendly Staffs.Very much pocket-friendly.

Weird place. The server made me change my table thrice,based on no apparent reason. We tried to order the sausages but were told it would be late to arrive at our tables,about 20 mins. We were extremely peckish so ordered a chilli pork dry and noodles with garlic pork. They took half an hour to serve our starter anyway. Then they bring the main course and they had served us garlic chicken. They claimed they had misheard,although how one can mishear after hearing the order thrice is beyond me. The food was very,very mediocre,nothing to write home about. 
Overall verdict: Disappointing with a capital D.

Located on the side of city centre,inside government guest house, previously was the blue poppy. Anyway the old quaintness and cosyness has been retained. Simplistic decor with a bit of budhist riff raff thrown in. Ordered a double fried pork, a triple style chicken noodles and a honey lemon duck. There are some unique items of the north eastern mountain cuisine like kawari, shapta, shaphalay. The waiter made us aware of it, hence ordered a take away shapalay too.
The double fried pork was spicy, tangy and great in quantity. The triple noodles also unique in its mix match of 3types of noodles and had sufficient chicken and egg. The duck, although perfect in its gravy was a downer on the meat. It was really stiff and was very difficult to eat. This being the only downer, i rate the place 4, otherwise its a 5, as theres no taxes too, washroom is available, staff are very courteous. They have a huge tv going on and although card wasnt accepted, paytm was available.
The shapalay opened at home was well packed, with momo sauce, was like a stuffed pita pocket with taste of fried momo! 
Highly recommended, pocket friendly place.

We were looking for a pocket friendly place to have dinner and I guess this turned out to be our biggest mistake.. the place was small with dim lighting.. nobody was there when we arrived.. we took seats on our own.. frankly speaking, it gave me a typical low grade bar feelings.. the prices were comparatively cheaper.. we ordered chicken Hakka noodles, mixed fried rice and hot garlic chicken.. and now comes the terror part.. a fly in the chicken side dish.. or that's what I thought.. I took it out.. placed on the table and we all inspected it.. it wasn't a fly.. an insect we couldn't identify.. we raised it with the management.. and they were polite enough to change the dish.. surprisingly now, the same side dish was now prepared with capsicum and onions.. then what were we served earlier? The food was good.. but we all had become very sceptic by this time and couldn't enjoy the food at all..

This place is located bang opposite City Centre,Saltlake. It is the Gorkha Bhawan that houses this restaurant.
Decor wise it's as minimal as it could get with near about 6 tables with nepali handicrafts on the walls but their playlist and promt service needs mention.

We had gone on a Durga Pujo day but to our surprise we didn't have to wait at all. The menu was changed due to festive days and to meet the huge demand so we went on to order the following items:
‚óèChicken steam momo
‚óèMixed fried rice-the mixed fried rice comes with pork as well so if one has an issue with that then it should be mentioned while ordering.
‚óèChilly Duck- This was a Durga Puja special of the day. We went for the gravy version to go with the fried rice and it was great to taste. The gravy waa absolutely delicious.

Pocket pinch is reasonable for such quality and quantity. They do not take any GST so brownie points for that.

You won't get any professional atmosphere there but the place is too good and cheap and serves quality food. You get authentic darjeeling flavour and my favourite there is Pork chow,  meifoon,  and momos.

Yesterday me &my partner went to this restaurant. Small place, bt nice. This place was just opposite to City center 1, ground floor of Gorkha Vawan. Already visited more than 2times, pujo rushes start so menu was limited. Yesterday we ordered Mixed noodles, chicken hongkong rice & sezwan chicken. Foods was good, not up to the mark. Best part is separated GST bill not take here. Pocket friendly restaurant.

They are really pathetic. After taking Mushroom I was about to die. Their behavior , I mean consumer behavior is very bad. They don't know how to behave with the customer. But here also they don't take any GST charges. So cost will be decreased if you go there.

This place is a hidden gem , situated just adjacent to the city centre in saltlake. The ambience is dim lit , with live sports played more often than ever. This place however, is famous for its authentic Chinese food , and trust me ; there's not a single taste bud it'll fail to win over with its intense and rich flavour and aroma. I've been to this place a multitude of times , but their pan fried momo is something I order everytime on a customary basis. Meifoons are a bit oily to be honest but the sides and other gravy items are just downright delicious. They have specials on a daily basis and if they make prawns , then order them without a hindrance , you'll surely love it. An added bonus is that no tax is charged extra and is already included in the menu, definitely a place that would always be visited whenever Chinese food is craving.

Situated inside the Gorkha Bhawan, opposite city centre. Its has tibetan and chinese cuisine. Service was slow. Was too much crowded. We had waitied for half an hour, but it was worth waiting. Food is delicious and tasty. Staffs are cooperative. As well as the owner was very much concerned. We had ordered for veg. Steam momo, veg. Fried momo, chilli Paneer, veg. Thukpa. 
If you love to have momo then you must visit this place.

Came across this place for a late lunch with a group of friends. It is located in Gorkha Bhawan, just opposite City Center Salt Lake. It is accessible from any of Salt Lake's main junctions such as Ultadanga or Karunamoyee. The dim lighting and Chinese lanterns with the slow and old rock songs creates a perfect atmosphere for cheap and MSG filled Chinese food. The seating capacity would be around 15-20. We sat at a long table with a very pretty garden view.
Coming to the food, we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Pork Fried Rice, Spicy Coriander Noodles, Hunana Chicken and Garlic Pork. I have to say the service was very prompt even after the lunch hour had passed. The plates on which they were served were a little unhygienic, but that didn't matter when we saw the food quantity and quality. It was perfectly filling and delicious, and even with a party of eight, we had to struggle to finish it all up. The price was more than reasonable and absolutely suitable for college students like us who never seem to have enough money.
Definitely coming back whenever I have a craving for Chinese food!

After having read a lot about this place thought of paying a visit for a weekly dine out. To start with the description, its a small place with 6 to 7 tables placed very close to each other and nothing special about the interior. They could invest to upgrade it. The staff are prompt to service and behavior is not bad but you will get a glimps of the negetive side when u read through the review. The serving plates and bowl gives u a feeling of a road side food stall. I ordered Chicken Manchow soup which didn't grab my attention as it was very ordinary. For the main course the waiter suggested Triple noodle which is basically a combination of rice noodle, normal and fried noodle, with pork shyapta. The noodle was pretty bad and was served cold. This I figured was previously made and was a cancelled order. When I complained about it to the manager they got it sorted. They were even out of beverages at around 8pm. Couldn't even get me a cold drink. The pork shayapta was good but nothing out of ordinary. They don't charge gst extra though its written on the menu that all govt. taxes apply.

Visited this place a few days back as I heard from my friends about an outlet serving Chinese food with cheap pricing. But the expectations went downhill ever since I entered the restaurant. Despite having many staff up front, and an almost empty outlet, I still had to call out a couple of times before someone came to take the order. Secondly, the corner where i was sitting had an air-conditioner above which after repeated requests was not being switched on whereas I started to sweat badly. I literally had to shout at the front desk for their irresponsible behaviour towards neglecting their duty. After all the fuss, their personnel came to take the order. The order included a plate of Chk. Momos, Chk. Fried rice and Kung Pao chicken. It was decent enough for their pricing, but this was the first and last time that I'll ever step foot into this place.

Located in the ground floor of gorkha bhawan.
The then blue poppy, now Darjeeling.
Dining hall converted into restaurant.

Dimly lit. Not so spacious. Waiters make you wait. Ambience is good. Hygiene not so much.

Food is very good. Authentic Chinese flavours lingers in your every bite. This is the typical Chinese or tibetan or Bhutanese flavour which you will get on the shops cum restaurants beside the roads of kurseong or kalimpong or phuentsholing on the way to darjeeling or gangtok or thimpu respectively.

The taste is very true to its core and extremely likeable for any hardcore Chinese quisine lover. Bliss.

Momos are very very good. Well steamed and very flavourful. Soup was also very nice.
Mix fried rice along with hot garlic chicken was awesome combo.

Pocket pinch is ok.
Quantity is fulfilling for two but.. A but little MORE would be appreciated.

MOMOs are overpriced.

Must visit.

One of my personal favourites in Kolkata especially when it comes to Chinese food. Every item they cook is almost perfect and their services are very prompt and the prizing- "My God, where do u get such good food at such a low cost?". I generally order Babycorn, momos along with chicken Fried rice. Every food here is a "must taste". Only short coming is that they accept only cash, but that should not be a problem. They play good music too which again is a great attraction if you are are music lover especially Blues and rock genre.

This place is located just opposite CC1 in Salt Lake, in Gorkha Bhavan.

So the place is very small, dimly lit and sort of crowded. The ambience isn't much, this place isn't your well built up restaurant, it's for the food that I really like this place.

This place specializes in pork and their chilli pork is to die for. The other items range from average to really good. It's a really cheap place and the quantity is really good for the price. 

I personally will reccomend this place only if you are near the area. It's a cheaper and better place than many other costly options in the area. For the buck, it's a really jolly option.

It feels bad personally to rate someone bad, but the whole experience with my last order was terrible. I had ordered a delivery (chicken sweet corn soup, sweet and sour chicken, chicken in hot garlic sauce, Szechwan fried rice, chicken Hongkong rice and chicken meinfoon). I had to wait for more than one and half an hour on top of that the food tasted pathetic and disgusting. Never again ordering from this place.

Thukpa   tastes like hot and sour soup with noodles, cumin pork was too salty. Oh and if you have plenty time for waiting such horror food then only go. 
BTW their day's special was over by around 8pm. Momo they told need 30 minutes at least to prepare. Khawari wasn't available. And they don't take card. 
I'm not concern about ambitious but it's untidy, plates are dirty, smell is coming from glass. 
Never going back, a disgusting place...

Have been ordering to this place for a last few months .. have been a very decent experience. The food is delivered on time.. food quality is very good specially the rice and the garlic chilly noodles( if u luv spicy). For the sides, pork preparations are exceptionally good , would recommend the cumin pork .. however there can be some improvement in the chicken section .. nothing exceptional, piece size can be improved along with the preparation. However chilly chicken in oyster sauce is better than the rest.

Dragon chicken hits the taste but in all right places. Its tasty,spicy and was cooked to perfection. However the Korean rice tasted blant. The gravy was tasteless . The same goes for the smoked chicken. There was no Smokey flavor to it . 
The sevice was awful . The waiters were busy watching tv.

The food is mostly tibetian and it tastes good whether you order momos, thupkas, noodles or any other dishes. The drawbacks are that the staffs are not that professional and their service is pretty slow too. So all in all, if you are a fan of tibetian food, then you must visit it!!

The restaurant ambience is quite average and prices of each dish are quite reasonable . The food was not that great and as per the price charged, hot garlic chicken which we ordered had only taste and pungentness of too much soya and Ajinomoto. Chilli garlic rice had too much of red chilli flakes making it unable to eat it all . Deep fried corn was average and singapore rice. Veg Munchurian was a good option at the price charged. Service is not that great, the staffs forget that you ordered and are waiting for ur item . Received my starter after 50 mins of ordering.

i think its my fourth or fifth time i dined in this restaurant. four times on weekdays n unfortunately once on weekends. Let me tell you all about it systematically.
1. Food
If you consider its cost food is good in budget. Chinese is good. It is spicy. But do go for regulars like noodles, Momo,rice. i found them good enough seeing the budget. But when i experimented having something new i was highly disappointed. Chicken there is quite stiff and fibrous. It gets even harder when your food cools. If you ask my favourite there i would say chilli garlic noodles. It can make you cry trust me. There isn't too much in menu to experiment from. The quality of chicken is disappointing.
2. Ambience
Restaurant owns a dark and shady feel. lights are dim. Chairs aren't sufficient to accommodate crowd. Swiggy and waiting queue all wait inside. So there is space problem. Corner seats near Tv feels airless as its far away from ac. I have been visiting restaurant since two years but i almost hear same music playing even today. I don't know weather they like those tracks so much or they simply don't care. 
3. Management
The worst thing about this restaurant is their management. I won't say manager wasn't friendly or obedient or was¬† rude. They were good in behaviour. All they lacked was working hard. They weren't working to feed their hungry customer rather they were working because they are struck there. You may get a feeling of government office in which you are standing ( here sitting) in queue and praying for your number to come. We can't see how inside works. But before me 3 tables left just because food was too late. i waited for 45 minutes to finally feed myself. They do work but not as they should . Swiggy gets high preference than sitting customers. One more highly frustrating con THEY DON'T ACCEPT CARDS. paytm and cash are the only modes of payment. So demonetization victims beware :p

To conclude i would say food is not bad when you compare with budget. The chefs do have taste in their hands. But there are still many faults. 
The one thing i would recommend to restaurant is please please look after management. don't take customer for taken.
My recommendation for customers yes its nice restaurant , food is good.¬† that's why people queue up there. If u have tight pocket,chinese lover,have enough time you surely can eat here. :)

In an effort to make a choice between this place and the shabby Blue Poppy Express in Laketown, I'm disappointed to say that I'd choose the latter. Out of the 3 items I ordered, 2 graced the bin with their presence and the third gave me smelly farts. I didn't even have to patience to take pictures. Using the summer season as an excuse is unacceptable, because if you're unable to serve clean food to your customers, you should humbly choose to close shop over possibly causing someone mild diarrhea - or worse, food poisoning.

#Egg Schezwan Noodles - This was the only dish I was able to consume fully, if only because I felt guilty for wasting money. On the flip side, this is something you can easily recreate at home and thus be assured of quality. Hence, not tempted to give even a mediocre score just for this.

#Drums of Heaven - The coated-in-spicy-marinade cousin to its fried counterpart - chicken lolipop - was inedible at best. Why you ask? Chicken smelled like it ate it's own poop. 'Nuff said.

#Chicken Steamed Momos - It's truly a rare place in Kolkata that can make momos juicy; I don't want to feel like I'm eating a steamed pakora. So if that's what your momos taste like, in to the bin they go.

I'm not sure if this performance happens occasionally like with some other restaurants, or if it's perpetual with this one, but with so many above par Chinese restaurants out there, this one needs to step up its game to deserve a better rating.

Tremendous dirty. I have seen several rats are just roaming around and even sometimes below our table.
Had to wait for 40 mins.
Coming to food quality - just as road side taste.. ordered hakka chicken chowmin, hong kong rice, scezwhan noodle with chicken black bean sauce and hong kong chicken.. Sorry to say noodle quantity was very very less and tastes dull.
What I liked most there is the packaged drinking water üòÅ
Now the bill- as the bill was handwritten so when I cross checked the item amount and their final sum I found out another ghotala in the final bill amount.

Anyway first and last visit to this place...

Never been there personally, however last evening as a starter with the beer, we ordered crispy chilli chicken and fish finger via swiggy. The taste of the fish finger was truly nice, it was softer than expected. The crispy chicken was also good. Will plan for a visit at the venue some other time.

I ordered a delivery last night. The delivery was delayed by 30 mins, but the food seemed to be warm, although not hot. The packaging was neat and the food tasted okay. 2 thukpas, 2 fried rice, 2 sides and over momo cost me ‚Çπ850. Most of the food tasted a bit bland for my taste, but I guess that's how the authentic Tibetan stuff would taste. But what did surprise me and deserved a rating of at least 3.5 was that the food didn't taste oily, heavy or unhealthy. It looked as if it was prepared at home, and pretty much tasted that way too. I know when someone says ghar ka khana, it brings diffrent memories, but imagine it to be a ghar ka khana location for Tibetans maybe.

Overall, nice place to order from but not too great on taste. Less pocket pinch. So if someday, if I want to spend less and feel a little health concious while ordering my food, I may order from here.

Okay! Let me put a disclaimer before I start. This is not like normal/usual reviews; it will portray my experience when I visited for the first time. 
The time was around 3 p.m. Few hungry Homo Sapience entered the restaurant. Don‚Äôt laugh! So let‚Äôs start with ambience as when you order the food you only can do two things usually meanwhile (I repeat: usually), either you take selfies or you stare around. 

Ambience:¬† Not that good. It‚Äôs so so. It‚Äôs not that specious either. Suppose you go there with a group consisting of 8/9 folks, it might be a challenge.¬† AC normally doesn‚Äôt make you feel comfortable, at least when we visited.¬† For Ambience- 2*/5.

Food: I am a vegetarian. Don‚Äôt get shocked please. We ordered Veg,Chicken,Pork dishes. So I can only comment on veg dishes. Starting with ‚ÄòChilly babycorn‚Äô. It was quite good and spicy. But don‚Äôt go for gravy one if you are taking as starter. One can easily finish that just within a while. Then we ordered ‚ÄòSchezwan Rice‚Äô and ‚ÄòChilly Paneer‚Äô. A single dish is enough for two normal people.¬† It was quite spicy and mouth watering (Paneer). I tried ‚ÄòVeg Rice Noodles‚Äô as well but it was little smelly. 
For Food: (Considering the Veg dishes)¬† 3*/5 .

Price: Lastly! Be happy, as it is the last paragraph. We ordered a good amount of foods but at the end it was like the reality shows finale. That ‚Äòdhik-dhik dhik-dhik‚Äô moment where we didn‚Äôt know how much we‚Äôd pay. And it was 250 bucks per person (ONLY)!!! So now be happy! :D

Wrapping up:¬† Have a visit at least once. One last thing that I could not be resisting myself mentioning that it was their break time but still they attended us with smiley face. 

Overall it‚Äôs: 3*/5¬† (BTW it‚Äôs my first food/restaurant review).
Thanks for staying tune!

Authentic chinese (well, none of the Chinese joints in India are truly authentic Chinese. If you want authentic Chinese, you have to go to China. And it's quite inedible) food at very pocket-friendly prices. Ambience is good, and there are always ample seats available. A good place to spend time with friends over a plate of momos or chilli pork.

This is one of my favorite place for Chinese cuisine.
I am  in love with this place and the food they serve.
The service is also good.
You can and should definitely visit this place if you love Chinese cuisine.
Situated at sector I near city centre.
Food that we generally order are :
Panfried momos : The momos are perfectly fried and aren't oily at all over it is the sauce which is made up of onion, garlic, ginger and tomatoes. Totally lip smacking.
Hakka noodles : How exactly noodles should taste, ask the chef of this place and you can also order chilly garlic noodles but do ask that the noodles should not be too spicy if you cannot eat too spicy food.
Thukpa : trust me I like this dish too, I appreciate the cook who always makes the dish that tastes exactly like the one I had the first time.
And the best thing about this eatery is that it's pocket friendly.

The Darjeeling is a small cosy place near city center 1. We have been to that place several times but I must say the quality of food and the services both have just gone worse day by day. Last time¬† when we went their, they served spoil food and covered it up with spices but the smell says it all . Quantity is reduced as well. I am never going to go to this place again. 
Must say a NO to this place if you don't want to spend 4 digits on medicines after eating from this place...

I visited this place with an intent to have kewa datchi.. A Bhutanese dish.. Never found in Kolkata and I am fond of it.. But got disappointed not finding it.. And the waiter said there is no fixed time it would be found.. So more disappointed

Ok, next I thought.. I will be having those dishes I didn't hear of.. So I began with chicken shaphalays..
It was really very yummy.. I loved it a lot

Next I had chicken kawari.. The Tibetan soup.. I didnot like it at all.. It was to healthy to be tasty.. Full of veggies.. Ofcourse boiled, few pieces of macroni and chicken.. Honestly my comment after eating it was.. I don't like so much jungle

Next I had chicken shapta. I was expecting it to be served with rice like the pics I saw in its Mumbai outlet. But it wasn't like that. I didnot like this also at all. I don't know how it should actually tastesl but the burnt smell it had felt quite revoking. The chicken was on the harder side. And ofcourse the amount was very less.

Next a known dish that I knew I should not miss in this restaurant was momo.. So I had it and it was amazing. I had steamed chicken momo.. It was better than the momos of wow momo. I would have given a 5 rating if I only had the momos. It was really yum... However I didn't have the soup because it simply tasted of salted water.

Overall view. Not a pinch at the pocket at all. And if u r seating at cc and u want to kill your choti choti bhuk in choti choti budget than u should go here and have the momo and shaphalays. Which I will be doing very often

Small cosy place inside the Gorkha Bhavan near City Centre 1. Dimly lit ambience with red lighting‚Äã, very few sitting tables, good western music. For food, we had pan fried momos. Tasted good with spicy sauce they provided, other wise bland. Schezwan rice was too spicy. Hot garlic chicken and chicken shapta were ok type. Honey chicken was sweet enough. They took too much time to serve, even much more time to produce the bill. Only good thing was pocket friendliness. Though its a small place, they require more staff to give quick service.

Totally pathetic experience ,all the items lacked taste .Such bland food are really hard to find ,even the basic salt was missing. After today I would rather settle for a chilli chicken in a roadside shanty than Darjeeling.

Stopped by here after a meeting and really glad that I did! Located close to city centre 1, this outlet is on the ground floor of Gorkha Bhawan. 
We tried the following-
‚Ä¢ Veg steamed momos which were steamed beautifully and the sauce was fiery enough to compliment the momos.
‚Ä¢ Chilli garlic noodles were garlicy, with slight heat and a little sweetness. One if the best noodles had in a while.
‚Ä¢ Chilli Mushroom which came in a soya gravy and was tasty.

Overall, really content with my meal. 
The place has very minimal ambiance and trust me you wouldn't mind because the food makes up for it

Usually stop by here for a quick lunch on weekdays. I've ordered the chicken curry, the pork curry, the emadasi, the subzi of the day (which was this simple cabbage one, at the time), steamed rice as the accompaniment and the occasional momo order. 

The food is very nice. Simple, homey flavours and very filling. 

The decor is a refurbishment of the Blue Poppy that existed there previously and the prices are about the same. What I particularly like about the emadasi is that there's not just cheese and chilly but also has tomatoes and onions in it, adding more flavour!

Oh take me back. 
That's the nostalgic feeling you'll have every time you walk into this place. 

Location : Inside Gorkha bhawan.
Really secluded place. No big posters or advertising of any sort. Walk straight into the building and take the first right and you'll walk into 'The Darjeeling'.

Warm ambience and great music.

Must tries:-
Pork momo.
Chilly Garlic Fried rice.(Absolute winner)

Pro:- Extremely good value for money. No tax of any sort.
Con:- The only con is that side dishes aren't anything great.

This place is perfect for a quick bite for students and also momo lovers like myself.

I have been to these place for years. Previously the same place used to host the Blue Poppy which was definitely a nice restaurant. The quality has been degrading since the last few months. We ordered the Pepper Garlic Chicken, that really tastes bad. We had to return the Chicken fried rice, smell of stale rice. The other items, Lat Mai Kai Chicken, the meifoon were okiesh! The portions are too little. Understand it's a budget restaurant but it need to have some decent quality. I will avoid this restaurant from the next time.

I tried this place for the first time today, and am not sure that I shall try it a second time. Ordered Lemon Coriander Soup and Garlic Pork for home delivery. Delivery was about 15 minutes late, apparently because they had mixed up my order with someone else's. I could live with that, but what I didn't like at all, was the quality of their garlic pork. At least one-third of the "pork" consisted of pure, unadulterated pork fat cut into slices. Also, they had clearly paid no heed to my request to make the pork dish as dry as possible.

i forgot to add the review..i visited the place 3-4 months ago.its near from city centre 1.first i would like to suggest if anyone want to visit it be sure that its inside gorkha bhaban,a very small dark place.if you dnt keep ur eye like a detective you cant find it out. when i reached in front of sikkim hoouse,someone told me its upstairs so i took the lift and a man came angrily and scold us a bit as if we didnt notice it intentionally..that was lame.
anyways lets come on the topic of food.i took chilly pork and mixed fried rice.quality was good for two people if they are not dieing out of hunger.chilly pork had slices of small pieces and lots of oil and chunks of pork fats.it was quite spicy not recommended for people who cant take too much red chillies.overall taste was good but the quality of the rice was low.
ambiance with small red chinese lanterns and dim lights was really apealing...
thumbs up for small dates and good ambiance and its pocket friendly too..food not upto the mark....

A quaint little place opposite to cc1, offering tasty Nepali and Bhutanese dishes at prices which would put a smile on the faces of foodies on a budget like me. Footfalls here on a Sunday evening is unexpectedly high and we had to wait for half an hour to get a table. Basic and minimalistic decor, nothing much to say about it. The service was bit slow and it was completely understandable as the Sunday evening crowd was overwhelming. The place is clearly understaffed to handle such huge orders as it was only 9.00 pm and half of the items on the menu were unavailable. But the silver lining was the friendliness of the waiters and the good food. We had the day's special dry chilli fish which came with right amount of crisp coating the tender fresh fish. The hot and sour soup was good too. The meifoon though a bit oily, but was delectable. Only the chilli pork didn't taste as it should, the gravy tasted slightly bland. The best part-- all these for just 600. Tips-- be early on Sunday evenings.

Ordered from this place yesterday. Placed an order post 1, through swiggy. we ordered a pan fried noodles (mixed), garlic chicken gravy, szechwan chicken gravy, chilli chicken gravy, hong kong noodles mixed, mixed meifoon, and butter lemon rice w/o pork. 

We faced a huge hassle in terms of ordering. After we placed the order and paid for it, we were told there was some confusion regrading the order. when we tried to resolve the issue, both swiggy and the restaurant were extremely rude. they refused to correct the order, and insisted on charging us more for the errors on their part; whoever was responsible for noting the orders down and relaying the information to the restaurant took down different items. after a long, heated discussion with both swiggy and the restaurant, we were told the order is being cancelled, and that the refund would depend on what swiggy decides. we offered to come down to the restaurant and collect the order, but the contact person, from The Darjeeling this time, refused that as well. after i assured them that this would call for a really bad review, and asking whether i would go to the restaurant and check with them, our order was finally confirmed. 

Order arrived ‡±©0 mins late, 2 hours after we had placed the order and paid for it. when it came, it was disappointing. the quantity was abysmal, half of what they usually provide, and I have ordered from this place before, so I know. None of the items tasted their usual good selves, and was mostly lacking in salt, condiments, any taste in general. only the garlic chicken tasted somewhat edible.

tl;dr: terrible service by restaurant, noncooperative staff.
late delivery. 
bad, tasteless food.
very low quantity.

A hidden gem just opposite to City Centre 1 and located in an unassuming spot inside the Gorkha Bhawan.. If you are low on your balance and still looking for some delicious and fulfilling option in the area, then look no further, cause Darjeeling fits the criteria perfectly.. The restaurant is basically the dining hall of the Gorkha Bhawan which has a decent enough stay options with a number of rooms.. The d√©cor is minimal with wooden panels and Chinese lamps but clean, hygienic and well maintained.. I was surprised to find out their sober taste of music being played in the background.. Service is lackluster, something you are accustomed of in budget eateries and they took a bit longer even in the lazy afternoon hours to serve the food.. You should visit this place for the Tibetian dishes as the Chinese flavor is pretty basic and commonplace.. We sampled:

Pork Kothay: An unique Tibetian momo variant not served everywhere in Kolkata.. Basically a half-fried pork momo with only the upper half deep fried in oil.. The filing was tasty but they didn‚Äôt seem to soak the extra oil after frying which spills from the plate.. Not a healthy option per se..

Chicken Shapta: Another famed Tibetian style curry.. We ordered the dry style, it was tangy, spicy and saucy with a lots of capsicum and onion.. Again oil content could have been lesser..

We were not in the mood for any heavy lunch but surely I would visit this place to try more of their fares.. An ideal place to come with a larger friends group and suits the pocket money constraint of college-goers.. Food seemed very basic but given the prices and the fact they don‚Äôt charge extra VAT definitely an economical alternative.. Our total cheque was just Rs.310/- (all incl.)..

Food:¬†¬†3/5

Pricing: 5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5

Momos were great.  But the pathetic experience with the chinwse main coarse. 
We ordered  Chicken burnt garlic rice and chilly chiken in oyester saus. 
We asked for the staff's suggestion about how the taste will be those items.  But he had just no idea. 
Though we ordered for a try. 
But the taste is below average for both of the dishes. 
Chilly Chiken in oyester saus was a bit undercooked and not spicy at all. 
Rice was also had no taste. üòû

Was my goto food joint for many months, but an incident changed my complete outlook. Once, while having their chili pork, i found pig hairs in the food, and i went on to complain to the waiter, he said its nothing, so went to the owners to confront, but he seemed cool about it, and said its nothing. they don't have enough time to remove every  bit of hairs, from the pig skin. 
I don't think, the owner knows the health hazards it may, cause to us, thus i want to warn all the others to avoid this place, and if you really want to, still then don't even try the chilli pork. 
and frankly, their food quality degraded so much in the past few months.

Economical and pocket friendly.
It can be difficult to locate this restaurant. It is situated opposite City Centre Saltlake inside Gorkha Bhawan.
A small and cozy place serving Chinese, Tibetan and Nepalese delicacies. The quality of food is good according to its price. The service is okay. The quantity of food is also remarkable at the given price point.
My favourite dish is Dragon Chicken, it is really tasty, spicy and also a little crispy. The fried rice served is also good.
But never try their soup, it will taste like water.
It is best for student hangouts as this place is cheap and affordable.

Just two steps away from the crowd of City Centre 1 Saltlake, The Darjeeling is situated inside the Gorkha Bhawan. It might be a bit difficult to locate the restaurant as it has no such prominent signboard which can be seen from a distance. But if you feel to fill your tummy for a reasonable and pocket friendly amount then this place can be placed in foodie's list.
The ambience is not up to the mark though, but the taste of their dishes are palatable. Chinese cuisine made by Nepali chef adds another different flavor to the taste. Meifoons and Momos are must eat dishes here. But if the Restaurant Management can put a little effort to grade up their ambience quality, utensils quality then who knows it can be the foodie's paradise in near future!

Been there a couple of times and also ordered online for home delivery. Love the dining experience here. A very cosy restaurant situated opposite city centre, perfect for an outing with friends or bae. The music and ambience is great.
Authentic bhutanese and Tibetan food along with the usual Chinese fare at pocket friendly rates. My favourites from this place are, steamed chicken and pork momos, shafaley, shapta, chicken thukpa, chilli pork, cumin pork with crushed chillies and dragon chicken. 
My only disappointment would be that I've never been able to taste their ema dasi or kewa dasi. Every time I order for them, they seem to be over already. 
Hopefully I'll be able to taste them someday.

This place has most amazing Chinese food I had in really long time. The place is little small but the food is surely worth a try. The price is well worth, the food portion is also huge. Their starters are really mouth watering and with a wide range to choose from. The quality of food is also good.

Opposite the cc1, its attached to a sort of resort or hotel for people..
A small place and not very much decorated, the warmth is somewhat missing
But the tibetian atmosphere is there, only a bit though.
Ordered pork steamed momo and schezwan pork noodles
Steamed momos seemed to have chicken in them rather than pork and the soup given was mere water with veges
The noodles were tasty but too oily.
An OK experience.

Now this restaurant is a substitute to the earlier Blue Poppy restaurant which was inside the Gorkha Bhawan; but it does offer some delicious chinese and tibetan food. The restaurant is very pockey friendly and one can visit this for a quick yummy plate of momos! 
We have tried veg steamed momos, crispy chilli mushroom, chilli babycorn gravy and hakka noodles here!
We loved all the dishes, they were light and less oily! Amongst all the best dishes were the Steamed momos and Crispy chilli mushroom!  Do try it out if you are here! :)
There is although a drawback about this place, that its very dimly litted and the interiors are just very moderate!

Borderline delicious, economical and pocket friendly eatery.
Visited there 3-4 times, mostly on account of various reunions and birthday treats and had a decent, satisfactory experience each and every time.

Located inside the Gorkha Bhawan in Salt Lake, it has a very convenient location, owing to it's proximity to City Centre.
The ambience and staff behavior is okayish, the only turn off has to be the shady interior and comparatively slow service.

I mostly order either Pan fried fish, chilli pork, mixed meifoon or American Chopsuey.
Their pork dishes are really good and the food quantity is really impressive, considering its relatively cheap price range.

All in all, I must recommend this pocket friendly, yet noteworthy restaurant to others.

A very decent place to enjoy some oriental cuisine. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from and based on my personal experiences plus word of mouth from other friends who have been here, I can safely say that their dishes are top notch.

I had a Garlic Pork, a Mixed Hakka noodles, and Chicken Shaphalays. The main dishes, that is the noodles and pork were good. Nothing too special but quite a delicacy. The Chicken Shaphalays was simply amazing. I had never eaten something like it and I was delightfully surprised. Highly recommended.

Today afteenoon it was a again a foodies' meeting of us! The very mandate festive lunch. It was after 3 pm. We went there and found the place full. The manager told to wait for sometimes. Near 3.30 pm we were told to get in, but we couldn't get our own place for three person üòí. Still It was okayüòÖ as we were dying of hungerüòÇ. But no one came to take order. Found the management so poor. Called a boy who were putting the glasses on our table, to take the order and he replied he couldn't. at least he could call someone to us, what we've seen in other places. After 3.45 pm a boy took the order and the food was served near about 4.15pm. The decoration is pretty dim and beautiful here. From city centre 1, it's not also too hard to find.. From the front gate, walk straight and turn left, you'll find gorkha bhawan. It is located inside of it. 
Now coming to food.
We ordered - 

1. Hong Kong chicken fried rice - an okayish normal dish..neither too spicy, nor sweet. A little blunt dish.

2. Szechwan chicken fried rice - damn spicy üëå a mouth-watering dish. Just go and have it.

3. Chilli chicken in oyester sauce - the flavour of oyester made this dish delicious.

4. Devils' wine chicken - a must try. The wine flavour felt so good. 

But, don't expect too much high quality of food. I'm giving 2.5 rating only for the little likings about the dishes I've mentioned above.
As you can see, they made us waiting extremely. The dining area is congested actually. They couldn't manage so many people and their orders. Poor staff behaviour. The worst thing, the plate was made of plastic and it was defective actually. for its unequal surface, we couldn't fix it on table. they should increase their management services.

A sudden cancellation of plans led me and my friends to this restaurant. You have to enter the Gorkha Bhawan building, located on the same lane as City Centre 1, to get to this restaurant. It's a rustic eatery, with the specials written on a small black board. We ordered a dish each of chilli coriander pork, pepper chicken, rice noodles and fried rice. I'll start with the taste - each dish was tasted quite nice, and different from each other in terms of the gravies. There was nothing remarkable about it, and I could hardly taste the coriander or the pepper in the two dishes, despite what the names said. Of course, there isn't much to say about rice and noodles, of course. But the one thing that was really weird was their problem dish. The meat tasted, and looked like chicken in every possible way. It took a lot of convincing by the staff, and a lot of careful chewing, to realize that it was actually pork, overcooked till it had lost all its flavours and been reduced to white, chickeny meat pieces. It was not too heavy on the pockets, but not too inexpensive either, especially considering the food. All in all, it wasn't a satisfactory experience.

Have been there for a light lunch. The best thing about these places are the prices are inclusive of the taxes!
We had ordered chicken momo, pork momo and dried chilli chicken. The pork momo was fantastic, no doubt! However chicken momo tasted a bit on the lower side, tastes not being so flavouring. The soup even was bland. Also the chicken from the dry chilli chicken was hard, not so succulent, and not flavouring, as compared to the ones tasted in contemporaries of places such as this. 
It is a worthy try, definitely, but not the best of choices among it's contemporaries. 
Service and ambience proved to be good!
Thank you!

The very first thing that you notice is dim light with ceiling decoration. Love the dark effect. I ordered pan fried momo and chicken drumstick. Both were incredibly tasty and spicy. I mean it was totally worth it, atleast i loved the momo better than Wow!momo. The quantity of both the mentioned dishes were more than suffiicient for me and my friend. Only sad thing is they dont accept paytm or any sort of cards which is a major turn off. Hope they start doing soon.

This gloomy little place is located inside Gorkha Bhawan, just opposite City Centre. Visited this place quite a few times and  also ordered their food alot via swiggy. I didn't quite like the d√©cor and ambiance, but in the end, flavour matters. And i do get good food here. Their Crispy chicken, Chilli Garlic chicken noodles are my all time favourite. The chilli garlic noodles are really spicy and has that distinct flavor on garlic in it which is awesome. Their schezwan fried rice is also very yummy. But i do feel that their quantities are little less compared to quantities served by other chinese restaurants. Service is Okay-ish, as they do take a lot of time to serve their orders. Overall a small food joint with very average interiors and okay-ish staffs but with good food. So getting ur food delivered to you at your doorstep is the best option i suppose.

Pathetic seating arrangement.... for every table there is a capacity for 6 to 4 people.... whereas 2 to 1 people seating on each table and the rest of the place is wasted..... for example say they have a accommodation of 30 people... but they can only provide service to 10-12 people.. with no empty table left.... people queueing outside.... and they dont even prioritize the people who came first.... so if you have a lot time then come to this place... i waited for 1 hr without getting any table eventhough the people are scarce.... so their management is really bad. Although the food is good here... but they need to work on their other services

Location: Gorkha Bhawan, Sector 1, Salt Lake. Enter the road right next to Bhikaram(adjacent to Citi Center) this will be on your left hand side!

Ambience & Decor : Shabby, shady & gloomy place. There is literally nothing much to say about their decor. Ambience is okayish!

I've been to this restaurant twice. The first expeience was so bad, I went there again to check if the food quality and taste is that bad. And yes it was!

¬†

After reading rave reviews bout this place, and after having disgusting food at this place, I went through all the reviews to check why others have praised this place so much. 

Well, according to others the 2 main areas in which this restaurant scores is :

1) Food quantity.

2) pork dishes.

As far as food quantity is concerned, yes it is pretty decent at that price point but is it really so? I'll explain. I've had 3 pork dishes here. 

*Hunan pork

*dry chili pork

*dry schezuan pork

Hunan pork was absolutely disgusting! I've never had anything so pathetic before. It was basically boiled pork pieces and bell peppers in a white gelatinous sauce. Disgusting!

Dry chili pork and schezuan pork were still palatable!

Now, quantity wise these dishes were nothing out of the world. IT might look a lot at first glance but wait! As you start eating, you'll realise that there are hardly any! Then why does it look like there is a lot you ask? That is where  Onions and bell peppers come into play. There were literally 3-4 proper strips of pork, other than that it was either pork fat or veggies.

Other items I had :

chicken noodles, chicken fried rice : Okayish!

Drums of heaven, chicken lolipop : I'd rather call it drums of hell. And I'd rather have candy lollipops!

People who have given this place 3.5 or above have wither never had good pork or had pork for the very first time.¬†

Darjeeling is located just beside City Centre, inside the Gorkha Bhawan.
I quite miss the Blue Poppy outlet that used to be here. 
I gave it 3 only because the service staff are extremely polite, always greeting with a smile (though on one recent visit, the place was full already, two other group that arrived after us were shown their seats while we were still waiting), and the music played here is nice.
But the food here is not at par taste and quality wise, with the Blue Poppy that used to be there.
The momo, like any Tibetan joint is delicious. But since there is no derth of momo places in Kolkata and every crossroad has one these days, paying anything beyond 50 for a plate is futile. 
Fried rice is okay. Nothing fancy. 
Gralic Chicken is horrible. Please don't take chicken stock, add corn starch and garlic to it, and call it garlic chicken. It lacked seasoning, and I had to gulp just the chicken pieces after mixing the momo's dalle or chilli paste-sauce thing, and left the gravy behind. 
Needs a lot of work in terms of food and hygiene.

Quaint little place located on the ground floor pf gorkha bhavan. The place reminded me of Darjeeling. The ambience was simple yet it had a hilly feeling. Well lit keeping in mind the festive seasons. Staffs were courteous and sweet. Also gave me an extra pouch of their dalley( momo) chutney. Price is very reasonable and i must say the menu does have good variety compared to blue poppy. 

Now coming to food: i parceled chicken momos and chicken thukpa.  The momos were nice and moist and the filling was really good. Usually restaurants try to cut down on the chicken filling but "Darjeeling" momos were fulfilling in true sense. The only drawback was their momo chutney. It wasnt authentic as it lacked garlic and real dalley ( tiger or cherry pepper-hottest in the world). A real dalley chutney has a little more pungent taste and smell yet it tastes awesome. Only those from the hilly regions will understand but nonetheless it was good. 
We get it in blue poppy. My only momo stoppage.

The chicken thukpa was superb. The soup in it was delicious. Very authentic and quantity was good enough for 2 people. 

Loved every bite!!

This little joint has overtaken what once was blue poppy. A pretty difficult place to spot amidst the concrete and that it being located on the back side of the city center. Just at the ground-floor of Gorkhaland bhavan

Coming to the ambiance. I being from Darjeeling itself, there is a feeling that makes u feel you are in the hills with one of the typical Tibetan eatery feel all around. The choice of the music is great, and they play some amazing songs fitting both, to a group of friends or to a quiet date night. I wish they had the bar option as well.

Coming to the food that we ordered, the service was a bit late, compared to what we expected even though there was not much rush and the staff was not very enthusiastic. We went for

Dry chilli Pork

Dry chilli Duck

Pork shapta

Chicken Momo

Pork Momo

Chicken Schezwan Noodles 

The pork and duck were exquisite, but i deduct half from them owing to the fact that we had bones in the duck and mostly fat in the pork. and i believe they took the idea of chilli a bit too seriously, as they were burning hot and literaly burnt our throats and even our stomach. The noodles was good, the typical stuff that u generally expect and it satisfied out hunger. The pork shapta was something new for us and we did like it a lot. Hoping to come back soon to try out more of such delicacies. 

Only if they had beer alongside, and the facilities to take cards for payment.

Its a small restaurant just near City centre. I visited here for the first time with my friends. Its moderately decorated. I didnt think at first the food will be so good. 
In starters, we ordered pan fried chicken momo which was quite delicious. 
In main course, we had Scheizwan rice, Hakka noodles and Chilli Chicken. Of these, the noodles were my fav.
The only problem is dont have any dish for desersts otherwise food is quite good at an affordable price.
And this restaurant deserves the qoute: "Dont judge a book by its cover" :)

Well, have been to ‚ÄúDarjeeling‚Äù (the hill station) may be a dozen times, but have never ever been to ‚ÄúThe Darjeeling‚Äù (restaurant) based out of Sector 1, Saltlake.

Was surfing office delivery outlets @ Zomato and came across this restaurant, which serves both ‚Äì Chinese as well as Tibetan delicacies! I straight away ordered their veg fried rice for office delivery. 

Voila! They delivered in some 35-40 minutes ‚Äì hugely exceeding my expectations.

Rice was nice, finely chopped carrots and beans, piping hot as well as great on quantity. They obliged my request for low oily food and prepared it with pretty low amount of oil. You can‚Äôt expect more out of life, when such an experience costs you just Rs. 130/- (Rs. 100 for rice, Rs 10 for packing and Rs 20 for delivery).

A 4-score was definitely on cards for them, when a small hoggin was discovered in my meal ‚Äì a gesture completely unacceptable and a minus half for that.

Rest all is fine, I recommend them nevertheless!

i had heard quite a buzz about this place recently and hence went their to hog and yes literally hog cos we love pork you see... we first ordered for momos, steamed chicken and pork.. the chicken was certainly better than any of those brands you see pilong up on each and every street nowadays... but but but the pork was certainly to kill and die for... next was cumin pork.. it was good but no taste of cumin at all.. it got me comfused and so i had to ask wat dish was served to me and i was confirmed that it was cumin pork.. next was corriander pork.. it was good too.. but let me tell you if you cannot handle hot dishes then please make sure to instruct them on the same... although i can handle the heat pretty well but this needs the heart of a dragon.. i had also ordered a soup called kawari which is a tibetan delicacy wherein u get macaroni type small diugh balls in the soup along with veggies.. they serve a lot in one portion of the soup and i had to literally stuff myself up.. i am going bk soon very soon for those pork momos for sure...

Horrible is the word for this restaurant.
We had ordered for an american chopsuey and a veg fried rice.
The fried rice was so so so so bland. No veggies except carrots and totally tasteless.

American chopsuey's noodles had a stale smell of oil.
The gravy was hopeless. Tasted too sour( its supposed to be sweet) and just had carrots and cauliflower.

Never ever will order or eat there. The quality has detoriated from what i had about an year back!

Been there twice. One of the many pocket friendly restaurants in salt lake. Located at gorkha bhavan, opposite city center Bhikharam. i liked the dimly lit interior. We had chicken hot n sour soup, chicken steamed momo, chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian, red pepper chicken. The red pepper chicken was really good. The staffs are good. Its a nice place for enjoying Chinese & Tibetan dishes without spending much.

Situated just across the City Centre, it is perfect for group of friends to hangout. Dimly lit, pocket friendly, fresh food, they don't have a huge seating capacity. We had ordered duck, mehfoon, momos, and chicken. Nothing superb, but decent. Service is a bit slow. The behavior of the staff was good. A ¬†good place :)

I have visited this restaurant twice in a span of two years. And nothing has changed since my first visit, hence it brought back the nostalgia. This one is located on the ground floor of the Gorkha Bhavan and is famous amongst the students since it is located near the City Center. They don't have a huge seating capacity but the decor is nice. It is decorated in the traditional Tibetan fashion, dimly lit. The food is okay.. not something praiseworthy but still okay. The Chicken pan Fried momo is lovely. That's a must-try item here.

It's an average place with good and cheap food. The momos were well cooked and the filling was delicious. We had the Chinese chopsuey also which was made Cantonese style, hence was white. It tasted good. We also had chilli pork where he pieces of pork were really tender, and has fried onions and capsicum and chillies. The crispy chicken that we had was also good, with the sweetness of tomato sauce and the spice was of chillies. It was salty too, due to the soya sauce. It had fried onions and capsicum too. The chutney was runny and spicy to be had with the momo and made a great accompaniment. All in all a good place but they offer no drinks except water and service is a bit slow.

After going through with Zomato reviews searching for good chinese joints, visited on Ashtami Evening. Small place, more or less good ambience. Tried chicken fried momo as ordered Seriously nothing special. Although, I prefer steam momo always. The burnt garlic mixed fried rice was awesome and a must try. The chilli fish as suggested by the waiter was not at all good. The mixed hakka noodles was also ordinary. May try again. :)

Located just opposite Bhikharam Chandmal (City Centre), this outlet provides a surprise package for the customers. You might feel a cramp for space, but these people are running a fabulous job out there.

1. Ambience - Most of the reviews I read on Zomato mentioned the atmosphere and decor. You can't help but mesmerized by the feel inside. Small Chinese lanterns hung over each table; light music in the ears; everything sorted. Do not miss their special-item-of-the-day, which will be written on a whiteboard, on the opposite wall of the TV. Perfect for a late night dinner. Have to give it a 5/5.

2. Staff - One of the best services I received till date. The order was taken within minutes after we were alloted our table. The food was served just in 5 minutes. One of the items I ordered was recommended by them; wasn't surprised it was delicious! Pretty impressed, 4.5/5.

3. Food - Absolutely top-notch. Food was served steamy-hot. Preparation was fine. The Chilli Garlic Mixed Noodles had set taste buds ablaze! Undoubtedly a burst of flavours in your mouth. No objection regarding quantity. A lot of unconventional items, will surely try them some other time. 4.5/5.

Chinese lover? Do not hesitate. Visit this place at once. Pocket-friendly menu, with a sensational taste will leave you satisfied. I, on my half, am going to visit this place again.

The ambiance is good and the hanging decoration of light is so beautiful. Staffs are nice. A perfect place to hangout with friends. Ordered dragon chicken which is so tasty and spicy and chicken steamed momo which are just like the momos that I had once tasted as Sikkim. It's totally amazing. I want to visit here again and again. And lastly staffs behavior is good.

Unfortunately I have not actually personally come here to sit down and eat but I have ordered from here via Swiggy thrice now. For me, The Darjeeling is kinda perfect when I suddenly get Chinese food/ momo cravings but it's the end of the month and my pocket money is running low.
The steamed momos, though a little oily, are great and they actually give 8 of them as opposed to the standard 5/6 (imagine my surprise), which pleased me a little too much. The mushroom soup, the fried rice, the Manchurian Chicken are pretty standard in both quality and quantity. 
Honestly at the price they're charging, it's hard to imagine another Chinese restaurant in sector 1 with the same kind of quality of food.

Ordered for home delivery for steamed chicken momo via zomato. Delivery is very efficient and speedy.
As for the taste of the momos they were too good. Better than many I've tasted so far. With solid fillings of chicken the delectable Tibetan dumplings when dipped in sauce reminded me very much of momos I've tasted in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, some of the serene hill stations like Lava, Lolegaon, Rishop, and in parts of Sikkim. 
For Chinese, Tibetan, Nepalese and North Eastern cuisine I would recommend The Darjeeling as a good choice! üëç

The decor is simple and home-ly.. Ours was a large group. So we had ordered almost everything off the menu. While the quantity of the food served here was less than that what's served in other such restaurants here in Kolkata, I was quite satisfied with the food otherwise. Delicious and balanced in spices. 
This place goes easy on your pocket too.. Worth many visits.

Situated right opposite City centre 1, where there used to be the restaurant Blue Poppy. They serve Chinese and Thai cuisines. The pricing is very lenient, particularly considering the fact that its is in the poshest area of Salt lake. The special Chilli chicken was beautifully made. Crispy Konjee chicken was good as well. Ambience is not a plus point. The rating is purely based on value for money.

If you are looking for a place where you can just hang out with friends and have a lovely time chatting....then yes Darjeeling is a perfect place. Good food with a standard pocket pinch is what Darjeeling offers to its customers. Ambience is not very good if you visit the place with your family. Meifoon (Rice noodles) , momo and drums of heaven (Shanghai Style) are very tasty.

This place is located at Gorkha Bhavan, beside City Centre 1, where earlier Blue Poppy used to be. The prices are quite pocket friendly. For starters, we tried the pork momo which was quite yummy but the shredded chicken and another pork starter failed to impress. We then tried the mixed Singapore noodles, which were cooked really well. We also tried the pepper duck, which was terrible and the garlic pork, which was average. All in all, not a place I will be frequenting again soon.

The Darjeeling boasts of providing it's customers with the taste of the hills.With the red lighting and the tibetian paintings on the wall they give the feel of a quintessential tibetian food joint. The seating area is not too big and the tables are placed not far from each other.We had ordered a dragon chicken and a schezwan rice.The dragon chicken was spicy and instantly gave our taste buds a lift.The schezwan rice on the other hand was not spicy at all and lacked the flavour of an actual schezwan rice. We had also ordered the chefs special for that day which was fish in white sauce. This preparation was extremely tasty and  we savoured it for quite a long time. 
Located opposite city centre inside the gorkha bhavan this place is extremely pocket friendly and provides you with a good value for money.Though the    service is sometimes slow this place provide you with a taste of the hills at a very affordable rate. :)

This place is located at the same spot as the erstwhile Blue Poppy that was situated inside Gorkha Bhavan , right opposite Bhikharam , outside City Centre 1. The restaurant seems very popular as there is always a queue waiting for their turn near the entrance .The tables are closely placed to each other , and they sometimes add chairs for additional members on a table . The service is a fairly quick , but there is a shortage of staff . The lighting and the ambiance inside is pretty awesome for a joint that's easy on the pocket ! The pan fried pork Momo tasted good , but Blue Poppy does it better! The pan fried mixed gravy noodles (with Pork) tasted very  good , and so did the Chilli Pork (gravy). But the Hot Garlic Duck we ordered had tiny pieces of duck meat that had bones in it , as they do not offer boneless options in Duck meat . The Hot Garlic Duck tasted average , but overall the meal was scrumptious, and we were left full and happy , with an "authentic taste of the hills" , as their board announced ! Check out the white board that's situated on the opposite wall of the TV to find out what's the dish of the day , and just sit back, relax and  enjoy in this wonderful pocket friendly joint with a friendly owner and staff .

Probably one of my most favorite places when it comes to being pocket friendly. Located near City Center in Gorkha Bhawan, you will always find people standing in this less spacious outlet to find a place to sit and have food. Being a vegetarian, I usually end up ordering Veg Steamed Momos, Pan Fried momos, Hakka noodles, Chilli Garlic chowmein and Thukpa. While the steamed momos are a bit higher on the oily side, the pan fried ones are a must try. Noodles are generally cooked very well and served in large portions. Thukpa is probably one of the best items they serve. It has always been on my to-be-ordered list. 
Coming to staff, they are pretty courteous. This place has an overall nice ambience with soothing music being played in the background. The lighting during the night time makes it look more beautiful. Would recommend the staff to brush less oil on the steamed momos.

This place was known for The Blue Poppy restaurant which was there till last year. Then I was quite a regular at this place inside Gorkha Bhawan..
Then after The Darjeeling opened I haven't been there until few days back and I was like wow!!
It seems like that the name has only changed, other than that the food is just the same like Blue Poppy.

But there has been a good improvement in the menu as the number of items has increased and the d√©cor became a bit good and most importantly they have installed Air Condition...

Now about the food I have nothing to say because it is the same as blue poppy. Good Chinese food at a pocket friendly rate.. :)

Went and was disappointed as hell. I dnt knw wt happened to the quality.. it seemed like it fell from d sky.. Fried rice was most disappointing of all as it was just rice nd topped with some scrambled eggs. That's it with no other piece of Vegetable in it, same was the condition of Chowmein.. I mean what the hell? If your short of Ingredients then say that you can't prepare the dish... RUBBISH!!!!

That's all folks, until next time if there is any :)

This is my personal favourite..
And possibly one of the best Momo joints I have come across in town:)
Their chicken steam Momos, thupkas, shaptas are incredibly delicious.
(I somehow feel the Momos are outstanding)

All I wish is they do something about their air conditioner. For it gets too stuffy and uncomfortable inside at certain times.

To sum it up:
Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Ambience 3/5
Cleanliness 2.5/5

Happy eating! :D

This restaurant is close to cc1 in d gorkha bhawan. Its a small restaurant with dim lighting. The ambience is okay. We ordered panfried gravy noodles with red pepper chicken. The waiter recommended us this as we wanted something spicy. The food arrived after sometime but d most shocking thing was they never served it. Moreover as we ordered one plate of noodles it was served on my plate nd my friend had to tk d noodles from my plate to his. Disgusting. Coming to the food  it was average  nd d starter which the waiter said would b spicy was nt at all spicy. It was very normal. The chicken strips were enuf I quantity but it was so rubbery nd uncooked we had a tough time tearing it with our forks nd evn chewing them!! Evn d veggies especially the capsicum was uncooked. The experience was not good nd I would not visit it again.

Tag line is "pocket friendly". We ordered Pork momo, Dragon chicken, Fish pan fried, Mix meifoon, Hot garlic duck and Pork shapta. Dragon chicken, pork shapta and mix meifoon are quite good. At the same time, pork momo and hot garlic duck are not upto the mark. Fish pan fried is also tasty. Ambience could be better. Serving will not disappoint you.

'The darjeeling'...situated in the first floor of Gorkha Bhavan( Just opposite to the city centre parking exit)...a small restaurant to start with only 6 tables...polite and courteous staff...with english pop n rock numbers playing in the background..now coming to the food...authentic chinese cuisine with a tinge of darjeeling(the taste one finds if they have chinese in Darjeeling)...tried fried rice n meifoon, fish in green vegetables and fish manchurian...liked it very much and most importantly its not at all extra spicy and rich...it has that perfect blend of sauces and spices. Prices are reasonable compared to the area in which it is situated. But one thing...it takes a lot of time to prepare the food, so hold your patience if you are going for a take away.
My suggestion - you can definitely give a try, the ambience is real soothing so is the food. 
Happy Eating!! Cheers!

I visited this restaurant today to satisfy my momo cravings. I really miss blue poppy's food although the Darjeeling is not so bad either. My friends and I were happy with our pork momos and pork kothays but the chicken momo was bland and the pork shapta was not up to our expectations. It tasted more like chilli garlic pork and the quantity was less too. I think the service could have been better as the place seemed understaffed. Overall its a good place for momos.

Almost certain of the possibility of getting lost in the many circles of Salt Lake, a quick call to the place later, it turned out that the Darjeling was bang opposite City Center Mall. Relieved at being non-lost, I reached the place and as I entered, I felt at ease with the dark lit red chinese decor with nice english numbers in the background like any quintessential tibetan food joint, only if the snow capped mountains were outside.

Since they were out of Ema Datshi, I settled for my favourite from The Blue Poppy - pork momo and then Pork Thupka, both to be carried home. Pork momo was as good as the TBP, equally silky skinned and deliciously stuffed. But the surprise dish was the Thupka, which I hadnt tried at the TBP, and ended up really liking. The soup was flavoursome, and the roast pork added a new depth to it.

Overall, my meal was a happy one ! And with so many branches of TBP and Darjeling spread across the city, I have little to complain about.

Amazing food at affordable prices....burnt ginger or garlic ( I don't remember which) rice is a must try and I heavily recommend Devils wine chicken. The service can be improved a lot however.

Went there on a Wednesday noon. Ordered non veg chow chow rice with the gravy and roasted chilli pork. The rice was good but the pork was a huge disappointment. The quantity was tiny and neither it tasted that good. I have seen places serving triple that quantity at a lesser price. Moreover when we complained about the quantity to the owner, he seemed to have no idea about it.

i was shit bored yesterday as it was raining cats and dogs and so there were no patients in my clinic..so i thought of wandering here and there,as i was planning to check out the sector 1 wala santas fantasea for long,but  my kora kagazesque luck did not let me do it and it was closed..the time was 4.35..so i thought of checking out the darjeeling ,just opposite the superbly overhyped cc1,inside the gorkha bhawan(yes that gorkha bhawan which once had blue poppy)..like everyother shady chinese theque it welcomed me with plastic chairs and plastic tables,neon lights..but i knew it was gonna surprise me..as usual i ordered something which i have never heard of it,pork shapta and i asked the chef(take that all you gourmet loving peeps) to make it as nonspicy as possible for the tastebud of a all things sweet fanatic ghoti..ordered pork hakka chowmein too..after 15 minutes the dishes arrived with all the aromas you people cant even think of..and i did not wait and pounced upon the shapta..it was second best thing the god ever made,large chunks of pork meat ,as soft as it can be and literally melts within your mouth,the red sauce was finger licking good..pork hakka chow had gracious amount of pork meats and loads of noodles..it was hard for me to finish it off..but the shapta and the coke helped...so guys dont waste your money at cc1 or other overhyped chinese restros,go and check out this awesome place.you can thank me later..and the pocket pinch is so less it just made me happy...

Situated inside Gorkha Bhawan. Earlier the place was known as Blue Poppy which used to be my fav place for steam momos. Unfortunately, the place and their style of preparing has changed. 
Today I hopped in with a friend to try the momos again and to my surprise I was not happy with the momos. I used to love momos especially because of their special spicey chutney which is no longer same. Even the momos was too oily even after ordering steamed momos. 
Even ordered hot and sour soup which was decent enough and loaded with raw veggies and chillies.

Located at Gorkha bhawan near City Center, Salt lake, Sector - I. 
The Darjeeling is a nice small outlet.. Not spacious but gives you a warm welcoming feeling. 
Before " The Darjeeling " Blue poppy was previously located here. 
Their food concentrates mainly on Chinese, Nepalese and Tibetan cuisine .
They don't have huge menu spread.. Which I like about them.. It is short and simple. 
Food is by far amazing whenever I tried and very pocket friendly. 
Service is fast and people over their are very friendly and polite.

The outlet serves good Chinese and Tibetian food at a very reasonable price. The quality and the quantity of the food is also worth the money.
We had ordered for chicken steamed momo, veg mushroom soup, burnt garlic rice and chicken in black bean sauce. All the food items were quite flavourful and the quantity was also pretty good. If you happen to be in saltlake, do try the food here for sure.

I think one of the best and reasonble in price chinese restaurant in salt lake area . Very hard to find out as its located inside the gorkha bhawan .    Went there in a rainy evening and ordered for mixed fried rice with chilly pork ... I must say i never had such a beautiful quality of fried rice with a lovely aroma ever in kolkata .. It was just fantastic with maximum in quantity with a new and different taste. Now coming to the chilly pork portion ... It was soft tender and juicy ... Taste was totally dffrnt from other restaurants... Ambience is awesome .. U can enjoy low light dinner with English music .. Staffs behaviour were also very much hospitable with always a smiling face ... Kichu khonrr jonno bhabchilam.. Sottie bujhi darjeeling e eshe porechi ... Khub sundor culture .... I will again visit this joint .. Cheers .. Only problem is dey dnt accept any credit or debit cards ..

Located in ¬†Gorkha bhavan,just opposite city cente 1, The Darjeeling is a great ¬†place to try out Tibetan Cuisine.It is one of its kind considering there is not much option of such cuisine in Salt Lake.
Small outlet on the ground floor of Gorkha bhavan with decent seating arrangements.
The best are momos,thukpas and meifoons. Kothays are a must try...!
My personal favourites are Pork kothay...chilli ¬†pork...and mixed Korean rice..Darjeeling always does justice to my  appetite for Pork at a pocket friendly note.My everyday office lunch is from Darjeeling via Swiggy..!
Well,the staff service and preparation time does ¬†need attention...!

It was a hot afternoon we were at CC1 and decided to have lunch here. I have been meaning to try this restaurant for a very long time, finally got the chance to. The place was moderately cool, had good music. We sat down and browsed through the menu and to our surprise they have started selling pork, we were happy to see that. We Order Non Veg Chow Chow rice with pork and Chilly pork Dry. The service was fast. But we were utterly disappointed with what arrived. The Chow chow was very good, good portion, good taste. But the chilly pork was poor, had eight pieces of miserably small sized pork. I was shocked and asked the server was this half plate or not. The taste was also bad, so much soy horrible.
This last bit surprised me the most when we complained the manager/owner of the place, he had no idea what the staff member are serving, he said we serve good portion pork, when we said how much we were served he was completely surprised.
I have had pork at many places, I love pork. This was the most SHAMBOLIC display ever.

Small and cozy place, I liked the lanterns there. We ordered chicken kawri, chicken shapta, both were good, mixed meifoon, again good, and pepper duck, not that good. Service was not upto the mark. They took quite long to start serving after we placed the order but served all the menu at once. Again no refilling of water after it served at the very beginning. Food is good but there is a scope for huge improvement for service. And yes, I must add at the last that this is a pocket friendly joint.

A very pocket friendly and cozy hangout. Simple decor. Food is great. The pork sausage is very, very yum. It is different from the pork sausages available in the market. The pork sapta is sinfully delicious. Among the other items pan fried noodles, dragon chicken, Hunan pork, baked fish, hot garlic duck are awesome. Chicken lat ma kai is tasty but a bit too spicy. They have selection of desserts which are not on the menu. Tried the darshan. It was good but nothing extraordinary.

Being a such a good place they should provide some good quality food. I had chiken hakka there which was to oilily and the chicken gravy was also not having any sort of Chinese flavor.. Sorry to say they can't justify the name of the restaurant üòõ

A sudden unplanned dinner date and hunger drove us to this quaint restaurant near City Centre ,Salt Lake. The interior was cosy and comfortable. It is a small eatery with a homely feel to it. We loved the lighting ( so much so that we asked them where to procure it from!) Food was served after a while and our gustatory senses were treated well. The pork was delicious,to say the least. 
Food,ambiance, interior- we loved it all. Delighted at The Darjeeling!

It has the place where Blue popy was located previously. It is a not so spacious and dense olace for chinese foods at moderate prices. Numerous times I have been there. They really serve excellent Kothays. Once there was a special menu called Shangdong chicken, which was semi spicy but tasted awesome. They must increase the no of staffs cause there were always a long time gap between ordering and receiving the food.

I believe that the restaurant resued me from the hunger I was suffering one day.Ordered Chicken Momos and Thupka online.A tad over-priced,but that might be due to the online tag.Proper preparation and holistic serving.Just the right amount of onions and garlics,as I like.The thupka was homogenously oiled,spiced and cooked.Certainly recommended.

I have been a customer of this place since a long time . It used to be blue poppy located at the ground floor of gorkha bhavan . Then they changed the name to Darjeeling . Its a decent place when you want Chinese and your pocket is little tight . Try their dragon chicken . Soup . Pretty much all the dishes are good .

Located in gorkha bhawan near city centre 1. 
Found it on zomato. Since then it became one of the most visited restaurant for me and my collogues. 
This little, cozy place is decorated with various colourful lamps, wooden panels. Neat and tidy decor is accompanied by good music all the time, which makes overall experience more pleasant.   They serve Tibetan, Nepalese, Chinese dishes. Loved their pork dishes. Wanna try duck but it's not available all the time. Among pork items I've tried chilly pork, pork hot garlic, chilly coriander pork, pork with vegetables. All are yummy, though my favourite pork hot garlic and chilly pork. 
Also tried pork kawri, it's basically a soup. 
Quality of chopsuey is not as I expected. 
Must try butter lemon fried rice, panfried noodles.

The Darjeeling is actually like a kitchen and dining place for people living in Gorkha Bhavan. Obviously it's also a restaurant, open for outsiders. Anyone can guess from the name that it serves Chinese. Did not have a great experience out there. Zomato said it opens at 12 noon, the people at Gorkha Bhavan said it opens at 1 pm, but they kept us waiting outside in the heat till about 1:15 pm, with no shades nearby. They gave an excuse that they cannot open till the owner arrives. We were one of the first customers and after we entered we had to hear the manager scolding others for not opening the gates. Then they started the music system, which featured some loud music at first. Anyway, finally we settled for the lunch and ordered American Chicken Chopsuey and Dragon Chicken. Though a bit too spicy, liked the Dragon Chicken, noodles and chicken tossed together, this preparation was new to me. But I felt that the Chopsuey tasted a bit dull. But the quantity was good and so was their service. A pocket friendly place to hang out with buddies. The place has a dark ambience with some Chinese decorations hanging over the tables. In all will give a rating of 6.5 out of 10 to this restaurant.

An authentic place to have delicious dishes from the hills apart from other delicacies. I love this place to the extent that everytime I visit Saltlake I make sure to drop down at The Darjeeling.. may b with family, friends, or even alone. Today ( 3rd june) I took the opportunity to visit the place on my birthday and have lunch with my family. The serene ambience is what attracts me the most. My favourites are chicken mushroom soup,chicken schezwan noodles, also the veg hakka noodles, hot garlic chicken and last but not the least chicken momo. I would definitly recommend this restaurant to other folks.

This is one place in saltlake very much adjacent to City Centre that is very much reasonably priced. Whether veg dish or non-veg dish both are equally satisfactory. Though being an ardent lover of chicken and fish recipes, well today I had Veg Meifoon with spicy chilly mushroom. And it was really a nice choice. Folks you'll can try it out.

This joint has come up where blue poppy once used to be in the ground floor of gorkhabhawan near city centre 1. 
I had huge expectations from this one, because it kind of replaced our favourite blue poppy where they serve some of the best lip-smacking delicacies in the town.
Average ambience. Dim lights are good. Decor is simple yet homely.
We took one steamed chicken momo which came with a soup as well. Well the soup was pathetically tasteless. The sauce that they gave along with the momo was bland as well. We asked them if they have anything spicy and the guy quickly got us a much better super tangy sauce. With that sauce the momos tasted much better. We took one burnt garlic rice and cumin pork for the mains. Quantity was good. Tasted equally good if not better. The prices are very nominal. 
Give it a try.

The following is a true story. Just bear with me on this. 
This restaurant is a true testament to the word 'slow' and 'woeful'. My friends and I, we went to this place one fine evening and we got in and sat there at one of the tables. After a few minutes (like 10) they made us change our seats and after a few moments later they made us change our seats again. The whole process took around 15-20 minutes more, all this while they didn't take our order. Finally, after 10-15 mins of more waiting they took our order. We ordered chicken momo and thukpa. From the time we came in & the time we placed our order I probably would have finished an entire episode of game of thrones. But the worse was yet to come. We waited and waited. But wait, we waited some more & after much waiting for about and I am conservatively estimating here, say 30 minutes at long last our food came. The thukpa was here. Yaay we thought but wait, what about the momo. We had our thukpa and waited and waited for our momo to come and much to our dismay it never came. By this time we were pretty underwhelmed by our change in circumstances and misfortunes and we just cancelled the momo. They readily agreed. In hindsight, I am never stepping into this place again even if this is the last restaurant on earth. What an evening. But the thukpa was nice.

This is situated exactly where Blue Poppy was previously situated inside Gorkha Bhaban( Opp to City Center 1). Three of us went there to try out their starters.
So we ordered 1 Red Pepper Chicken, 1 Chilli Mushroom , 1 Lat Ma Kai Chicken and 1 Crispy Chilli Babycorn.
All of them were outstanding specially the mushroom dish and the Lat Ma Kai chicken.
And yes regarding ambience, it is a very calm and quiet place with light music playing in the background.
The hospitality of the staff is also worth mentioning.

Checked into the restaurant a little late. Was relatively full. It took them a lot of time to take the order, even longer to get it. Food is tasty. Had the garlic pork, chicken with mushrooms and greens, meifoon and fried rice. The dishes were very tasty. The quantity of the pork was less for a full dish. The interior is dark and a little shabby. And you should not go there expecting good service. Just go there to eat. Very economical.

The decor is average. There's just one air conditioner and it becomes unbearably hot when the restaurant is houseful. Service is slow. Food is pretty average. Quantity of pork shapta was so bad that we felt someone had just slapped us. The prawns were smelly. Overall, not recommended. The rice noodles was the only good thing about the restaurant.

Not much of a restaurant ambience wise but some of the items that I've tasted here were really good. Special mention for their momos, the rice noodles and some of the chicken starters. They also serve up some decent duck preparations I've heard, would love to go back and try them soon.

So one lazy afternoon i ordered lunch from this restaurant. Kudos to swiggy, they are doing an amazing job at providing food to the lazy people. :P
Anyway, I ordered mixed fried rice, lemon chicken in my main course and also order chicken coriander soup and pork momo in starters. 
Loved the momos, it was amazingly cooked. I will probably going to have it again soon but here is the reason  why I am giving such a low rating. The lemon chicken and the soup! Why was it so sour?  It was so sour I couldn't eat the gravy and had to throw it away same with the soup. 
The rice was okayish nothing separates it from other ordinary restaurants. 
To conclude, a pocket friendly restaurant. Steam momos are a must try

There are a few tricks to this place:

1) Reach before 10 PM. By the time it's 10:30, most of the kitchen starts to shut down.

2) Get to know the old man and lady who manage the counter. They are kind, and helpful. They also happen to have a rather eclectic sense of fashion.

3) Be nice to the waiters, and tell them exactly what you want, and how you want your food to be prepared. They rarely disappoint.

The prime highlights of the place are the chicken lollipops, the soups, and famously, the pork. The Darjeeling is located on the ground floor of the Gorkha Bhavan. If you miss it, it is right next to the petrol pump to the side of City Centre 1. Can't miss that!

Before I move on to the food, I should mention the music. Imagine the kind of music that'd play in the bedroom of a rock and jazz addicted dreamer, and you'd have the kind of music that plays at The Darjeeling. From The Doors to Alannah Myles, they have it all. Not a bad range of songs too!

The food is authentic, and made with a good deal of care. You may just land up there on a bad day and get that half cooked lollipop, or find your favorite item out of stock. Then again, follow the three rules of the place, and you should be quite safe from such pitfalls.

Now, the food is really worth coming back for. Pork and chicken are the obvious specialties. However, The Darjeeling always will remain on my list of those very few places that know how to cook duck. Try the duck curry, or the chilly duck, and you will be nothing short of ecstatic.

You can start off your meal with chilly pork or lollipops, and clear soup.

Follow this up with the Chop Suey, or noodles. If you like rice, couple it with any of the curries. An ideal side dish would be Lat Ma Kai Chicken, Garlic Pork, or Chilli Fish (I know, I'm not a vegan. Blame me, ok?).
Follow this up with the cold drinks, always served cold.

This is a place for those days when you feel moderately rich, and aggressively hungry. If you have any money left after the meal, and thirsty for a beer, there's a liquor counter right next to petrol pump too.

Cheers!

Pocket friendly place for students.Good meal is what you will get at low rates,which will make your tummy happy.The place is peaceful,with dim lights and soft music playing in the background.The AC was not working properly,so felt bit stuffy.
The food was good.The hot and sour soup was warm and delicious and dragon chicken was lipsmacking. Schezwan chicken and Chicken fried rice was yummy,not too oily but, i would have preferred a bit more salt and chilli in their dishes.
Overall,a very satisfactory visit after a busy and sultry day.

Darjeeling.... The name attracted me to this place. It was once a regular joint for me when Blue Poppy was operating after which we migrated to Sikkim House.  One fine late evening we reached this restaurant hearing a lot about the momos. We placed order for Pork Steamed Momo which was out of stock. Finally placed order ;-

1. Shredded Chilly Chicken- Awesome tasting fine pieces of chicken tossed in traditional sauces. Its a dry item and perfect as a starter.
2. Mixed Fried Rice- Little blunt in taste, had a handsome portion of eggs and prawn in it with some chicken. We avoided pork in it which is a standard ingredient of their mixed fried rice.
3. Chilli Pork Dry- It is a must eat item for me. A gentle request helped me to get fat free pork. The taste is to die for.. Shredded smoked pieces of fibery pork in ample capsicum, green chilli and onion flakes. 
Pocket pinch - Rs 490/- (1 cold drink added).

PROs-

1. Pocket friendly.
2. Superb taste.
3. Typical tibetan decor.

CONs-
1. Low on quantity. Chilli pork had only 5 shredded pieces.
2. Set amidst no parking zone. One has to park in CC1 or beside IOCL petrol pump and walk to till Gorkha Bhawan.
3. A stronger AC would have been better.

Food- 5/5
Quantity-2/5
Ambience- 4/5.
Service- 5/5 (for the smile they serve with food)
Value for money- 3/5.

Was looking for a pocket friendly place to have a quick lunch near cc and zeroed in at this joint. Located in gorkha bhavan just beside cc, it is very easy to locate.
The place is small but not too cramped up and the ambience is just about average and clean.
When you come to places like this, you really dont care much about the ambience but only the food, service and hygiene.
Coming to service..it was very slow and sloppy. They are disorganized and serve you very late especially if it is crowded. Evn the bill took more than 10 minutes to arrive.
Now the food is strictly average. Quantity was decent.
We ordered steamed chicken momo, chilli garlic chicken noodles and dragon chicken.
The food is on the spicier side. I love having spicy food, still i found the spice quotient in both dragon chicken and the noodles to be quite high.
Dragon chicken was average. Fried chicken tossed in some red sauce and coated with fried noodles.
The noodle was preety average. Scantily scattered chicken and very similar to the chowmein u ll find in any roadside kiosk.
The momo was quite good.however they use lot of diced onions in the filling which mars the taste of chicken. Good thing is that it is accompanied with a bowl of clear soup.
This place is dirt cheap actually. Not extra taxes as all prices ar inclusive of tax.
However if they improve service and quality of food a bit, it ll do wonders. Its USP is its cheap pricing , that too in a place near cc, saltlake.

This place is located at a 2 mins walking distance from Salt Lake City Centre. Mainly Chinese and Tibetan delicacies available. We had casual chilli chicken and chicken fried rice. Food tastes good here, but the place is mainly for guests who stays here,i.e The Darjeeling. Unlike Sikkim House, this place is not a good place to hang out

If you know where Blue Poppy was located nearby City Center, you wouldn't have trouble finding this restaurant! They have come as a replacement for all the foodies in lieu of Blue Poppy which now houses themselves opposite to SAI, Salt Lake Stadium at Sector III.

There isn't much of a difference in terms of the menu. You get the same offerings of Pork, Chicken, Noodles and Momos. The Momos here are almost to die for. If you want to try something else, you can go for Noodles and Chicken or even one of those Pork Dishes to have it alone, for your meal! Although, the quality of Pork isn't that great, the preparations are delicious!¬†

Considering the pocket-pinch, and the close proximity from my residence, this always remains on my top priority list incase I do not want to venture away far!

Recommended Items: veg fried rice, chili pork, garlic pork, Chili Fish, Chicken Drumsticks...

Do try this place, especially the pork lovers.Dim light atmosphere and the staffs were very helpful too.
A good place to hang out with friends and also a low pocket-pinch.

I have been planning to eat at The Darjeeling since ages and finally it happened yesterday. It's a small area but comfy and clean. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn for starters as it is a safe bet everywhere. For main course we ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Momo and Pan Fried Veg Noodles. The Momo was suggested by a friend and it turned out to be pretty good. The quantity was too much for one person to eat by themselves. I would say I was pretty satisfied by the end of the meal. A happy stomach, a happy me. üòÅ

The Darjeeling seems to be a restaurant that will keeping growing on me. Taking up what The Blue Poppy didn't finish, this food joint will make you feel an inherent need to eat. Like it's predecessor at Gorkha Bhavan, The Darjeeling combines excellent food with great service and lovely ambience.

There isn't much more you can ask for from a restaurant serving up Chow and Chicken at 300. The Darjeeling does what very few other places manage to do -- put up a proper, good playlist. I'd like nothing more than to listen to Kravitz and AC/DC while I enjoy my steaming hot bowl of soup and thupka.

Their service is very good. Quick, accurate and friendly. It's almost as if The Blue Poppy never left. But nothing speaks as much about the restaurant as their food does. Serving up immaculate chow and rice, pairing it with fantastic plates of pork and chicken, The Darjeeling provides every customer the chance to live a dream. Granted their portions are a little smaller than what the Blue Poppy used to serve up, but they make up for that with the general quality of things.

Absolutely delighted with how well this restaurant has taken off. If they can make their Lime Water and Masala Cokes a regularly available item on their menu, very few restaurants will be as complete.

Tremendous!
Good food. Great experience.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made

I usually take away food from this place as it does not offer home delivery..the taste, portion and quality of food changes each day.

On one instance, the vegetable soup and chicken soup were very tasty due to which I placed a similar order on some other day..but this time chicken was stale and the vegetable soup also tasted different..I have also tasted momos, babycorn and panfried noddles from this place..all these items were average..

May be food is better when served hot at the restaurant itself..I would not like to visit the joint unless it changes for the better.

In the mood for Chinese, Tibetian or Bhutanese. Step into The Darjeeling. Located right opposite to City Centre 1 , inside Gorkha Bhawan. This place is a gem for people looking for authentic Chinese cuisine.
The place is small with seating for about 20-30 people and is very cosy. The place has an array of items from duck to pork and the staple chicken and mutton. 
Today was my 2nd visit to the place and being a Saturday I had to eat vegetarian. 

I ordered the Pan Fried Veg noodles and the Pepper Mushroom. And I must add I was very impressed with the noodles prepared. The dish did not have unnecessary gravy. It was just right with a good amount of Pok-Choi being used. That is something you only get in places which offer fine dining.

The mushroom was average. Needed a bit more salt but then again authentic Chinese is not always very tempting to our platter. 

The ambience was nice with good English music being played. The pricing is unbelievable. I mean you can have a classy meal sitting down in AC for the price you would pay to sit and eat roadside. 

I loved the whole experience. Looking forward to my next visit.

Inside the perimeter of Gorkhabhaban, opposite to CC1 is the joint named The Darjeeling. The place can accommodate max 30 people at a time. Chinese foods with few options of Indian items are served here. I ordered veg fried rice and chilli pork. Fried rice tastes average and the quantity was 75% of a standard plate, hence does not worth 90 INR. Pork tasted really good, but again the quantity wasn't up to its cost of 160 INR. Foods were served in cheap plastic plate. So, there are many issues to improve on.

After a long walk and hanging out for some time at City Centre 1, we both got really hungry and tried to find a reasonably priced restaurant nearby to dine in. As always, Zomato came to the rescue and we zeroed in on The Darjeeling. 
The place is on the ground floor of Gorkha Bhaban. The ambiance was that of a typical Chinese eatery with dim and red lights. The english retro songs being played on the background was a nice added touch.
We were mighty hungry, and ordered Singaporean Chilli Potato, a Veg Fried Rice, a Hot Garlic Pork, and a Shredded Chilli Chicken as an afterthought.
The potato starter came soon enough, but the rest of the meal took a long enough time to arrive. We saw other people arriving after being served before.
I was not too fond of the chili potato, the masala on it for me tasted a bit like the one we get with Maggi. The rice was very well cooked, with lots of onions and bell peppers. The pork and the chicken were both very average. I expected a little more fat on the pork, as there was absolutely none. The chicken was also dry and a little tough.
So, all in all, not a very enjoyable meal, but a reasonably priced one, with a bill coming to 580 with all this and coke. Not sure if I'll visit again though.

This place was a pleasant surprise. I went here with mother on Christmas, expecting nothing special. But I left with both my tummy and my pocket feeling rather satisfied. It was a rather sparse meal (I was saving room for dessert), but it was delicious.

1. Steamed pork momos : for 100 bucks a plate, these are the tastiest momos I've ever had (the steamed prawn ones of Wow Momo and the cheese ones of Chalte Firte coming in close seconds). The outer coating was thin but held its shape. The filling was moist with fat. The table beside ours had 3 plates of just this. 
The sauce they served was very fiery -- as it's supposed to be. We kept licking at the bowl till the end of our meal. It also added a spicy flavour to our thukpa. Hot, but flavorful.
The soup was a disaster. Didn't touch it. No salt, warm water in a bowl. Yuckky.

2. Mixed thukpa : it was good, but not as good as the momos. Tasty, but portion is much lesser than Blue Poppy. It's also a little too light, and they skimped on the proteins. Might have been the Christmas rush, but unless you want something super healthy, I see no reason to order this one. 

We had to wait for 10 minutes till we got a table. Ambience is just lovely. I love the red dim lights, and the place is bustling with happy people. You can't hear people's conversations, so that a plus. But service is slow unless you're prepared to keep poking and prodding the waiters.

I want to go here just to have a plate of pork momos all to myself, in cosy Chinese light. This is definitely my kinda place. If you give it a try, who knows, you might just be surprised!

I can't rate the place more than this, it has taken the place of very famous blue poppy at the ground floor of gorkha vaban!
Went few days ago with two of my friends..
Ambiance is still great, they have maintained that old decor added few special add ons.
The service was pretty slow.
We ordered Singapore noodles, Shanghai rice, lat me kai chicken for starters, devils wine chicken to go with main course.
I have few complains-
1. The chicken was not well marinated, was rubbery
2. Only flavour that hit us was religious use of red chilli in literally everything..

Please check this management!

The quantity is pretty less..
Still at that region one can visit the place if has no where to go.. Still not bad

Located on the ground floor of Gorkha Bhawan, The Darjeeling serves pretty decent Chinese and  Tibetan delicacies. A plate of momos have 8 pieces which are tasty and succulent but does not quite live up to its hype. The soup that comes with it is very edible though. The Chicken Fried Rice is a welcome change from the regular Chinese fried rice I've had been having for some time now at all Chinese restaurants in the sense that it is delicious in a different way- very flavourful and palatable. So is the Chilli Fish. Extremely soft, savoury pieces of fish in a delicious gravy. The portions are good too. 
Coming to the ambience, it has red low lighting which gives the place a romantic but somewhat spooky vibe in the evening. The chinese lanterns are cute though. But they can do better in terms of seating arrangement, cutlery and tidy it up a bit to make the place more presentable. Not that it's bad altogether. And I guess it's okay given that the prices of food are extremely affordable. And tasty food at cheap rates is always a boon. The service also is fast and neat.

It was a weekday afternoon. The three of us were at city center for a much needed adda session. And we were all ready to have some evening snacks. We found this joint out on zomato and since none of us had visited it, we were eager to go to this joint. It is located at the ground floor of Sikkim house exactly where the blue poppy used to be. A small joint with very simple d√©cor. Beautiful lamp shades and colorful danglers,stars were hanging from the ceiling. 
            We ordered steamed pork momo,chilli duck and chicken kawri. Momo was served with clear soup. The outer covering was very soft, thin and well cooked. Filling tasted great. Chilli duck was spicy and really hot. Our nose and tongue became runny and watery respectively. But this dish was just delicious. Duck meat was well cooked and soft. And since it was my first duck meat of the winter season, i totally enjoyed it. Next came the kawri. The name made us curious about the dish. On asking about the ingredients, the waiter informed us that it was basically a soup with home made Tibetan macaroni in it. The taste was very new to me and i just loved it. Next time i would love to try their kothey and thukpa.
           Service was fast enough and price was reasonable and pocket friendly.

Don't visit this place with sky wide expectations, especially regarding the interiors but no doubt they serve really good food. My personal favourite is their chilli garlic noodles and dry chilli chicken.

Been planning to go here for long.¬†
Lately, we could implement our plan of ours and we weren't disappointed. Ended up going twice in a week.¬†
The quality and quantity of food is amazing. Its twitchy to find, but the ambience inside is good.

P.S. Do try the baked and pan fried fish items. and, pork isn't that good here, I have had better.

Nothing extra ordinary..overall an average place for chinese delights. Though the food doesn't taste that great but it isn't bad even. I would say taste of food is so-so. We ordered Konjee Crispy Chicken in starter, which I didn't like much..& in main course we ordered chicken meifoon & hot garlic chicken. The hot garlic chicken was indeed tasty n again the meifoon was so-so. The staffs were very courteous..the place is small & the ambience could have been better with a little bit of management. Prices are comparatively low. A good place to hang out with a low pocket-pinch ;)

The special new year lunch with my parents and a dine in experience at a new place- that quite made my day. The Darjeeling situated inside the Gorkha place is a small but cosy place. We had ordered mixed fried nice, the mandatory gravy noodle, pork with vegetables and sweet and sour chicken. Well other than the pork I really liked the other dishes. My father loved the rice and so did I. The staffs were really courteous. All in all a good experience.

We Indians love our neighbours' cuisine so much.. üòã How easily became such popular and restros like 'Darjeeling' are pulling us more towards them. They serve awesome momo with thin layer and sufficient, delicious fillings. Pan fried is an attraction i would say. Their noodles varieties are also tasty and quantity wise 'paisa wasul'. The chicken dishes also are good in terms of both quantity and quality. I would recommend gravy noodles. When served hot, it was awesome.

I have had momos quite a number of times at this place. The plates in which they serve the momo is nice but the quality is inconsistent. I have tried the fried rice and chilly pork once but its no Blue Poppy! The rice was a little smelly and the pork was full of fat! The waiters are courteous but service is very slow. I prefer not going to this place if I have other options. P.S. Prices are pocket friendly!

The relatively new restaurant which replaced Blue Poppy in Gorkha Bhavan somewhat failed to impress me. Yesterday after watching Bajirao Mastani we six hungry people dropped in here for a late lunch. We ordered Chilli Duck and Stir Fried Pork for starters. Had mixed meifoon, mixed fried rice, American Chopsuoey, Garlic Chicken and Hong Kong Chicken as main course. The meifoon and the pork was the life saver. Everything else that we ordered were not at all good. The fried rice was flat in taste. The garlic chicken was way too salty. And the Hong Kong Chicken was sour. But the chopsoey was the SWEETEST thing I have ever tasted. Seemed like they emptied there sugar cans while making that dish! I am not going back here. And even if I go back, i ll just have the meifoon which was indeed good with VERY good amount of chicken, prawn and pork in it.

This is very close to my Institute and my preferred place for a quick meal. Me and my colleagues often try out the Tibetan delicacies here. The chicken momos are tasty and prices are quite cheap actually. I prefer the pork dishes here though. The decor and ambience aren't their strong points ....the sole reason for your visit should be the quick and good food. Keeping in mind the high price rates of food joints in this locality, The Darjeeling is a boon to food lovers of Sector 1.

i will try to break down the review for you.
First, minimal lighting creates a soothing ambience for having lunch or supper or dinner at this place.¬†

Second, the food, if not seen from a critical point of view, tastes amazingly good at the listed prices.¬†Besides the quantity provided is ample for sharing unless you are a shark or something.¬†

Third, the location. Situated close to a mall, it can fulfil your shopping wishes alongside a good meal for the day.

Lastly, the music. :)

The good old blue poppy at Gorkha Bhawan near City Center 1, Salt Lake is replaced by this place. Apart from the few changes in the lightings, interior, the ambience there remains the same. We had taken Steam Chicken Momo served which tasted good but the sauce  that they served along with it was little to plain  so we asked the waiter to provide any other spicy sauce. He was quick enough to get another flavoured spicy tangy variety of sauce and then after that the momos tasted very good. They also provide soup along with momos. Well to be honest I found the soup little too bland . Then we had Garlic Fried Rice with egg & chicken which was really good and I liked the taste very much. In side dish we had Cumin Pork with chilly which also tasted good with jeera flavour. Overall it was a nice experience.

It is alright. The price is low enough.
The chicken and pork dishes taste good. The noodles were not satisfactory. The ambience is that of a 90's bollywood movie restaurant studio! If you have money in your pocket, cross the road and a little away from the main road is the massive City Centre. The ambience will set your mood and Kaafila/Afraa/Haka/so many other places will satisfy your tummy.

Not every momo joint can nail the pork momo to,perfection, but kudos to the chefs of Darjeeling you succeed in making one of the best pork momos I have had. 

The Darjeeling is situated bang opposite city center 1, inside the Gorkha Bhawan. We did get confused after entering the building to,spot the joint. Nice ambience, reasonably priced food with great taste. The Darjeeling is a must visit to everyone and anyone who loves Tibetian cuisine.

Great food. Nice ambience. Good hospitality. Just that the quantity of food is too less for you to fill your appetite. Cost is reasonable though, yet the quantity is what lacks.

The Darjeeling is a small restaurant in the ground floor of Gorkha Bhavan, right next to City Centre. My friends and I decided to pop in there for some momos. The ambiance is pretty soothing and though it is a small place it doesn't feel cramped. We ordered three plates of steamed chicken momos for the three of us, which were served ¬†pretty promptly along with soup and a deliciously spicy sauce. The momos were pretty damn good. The food was cheap too, they serve eight small momos per plate for a hundred rupees.¬†
I'm coming back again to try the other dishes!

Well I visited this very nice restaurant situated opposite City Center Saltlake and it was really an experience to remember as I have three factors to point out , firstly the ambience was superb and when I say superb means literally it did justice with its interior decor with red dim chandeliers hanging making the restaurant cozy and an average size TV for entertainment viewing was also a plus point , then there was music with a good playlist looped up making you feel very alive .
Now coming to the second thing is the service which i will classify it as fast , energetic ,courteous staff and always ready to help and improvise in orders as well clean service with food as well as table polishing . And finally what hit me hard at this restaurant was its food as it was very well and fresh prepared as I ordered Chicken steam momos , Chicken thupa , Egg Hakka chow and two soft drinks and at the end of the day the damages rounded to RS : 330 , I mean that's a steal for deal with great food and well behaved staff as well as atmosphere at its best .

My verdict - HELL YEAH !!

My order is based on the three dishes I ordered via #swiggy . Before I begin this review , I have to say that I am a momo snob and didn't have many expectations from this place . So I ordered a chili chicken, garlic chicken and chicken hot n sour soup . 

The soup was good . The heat and the sourness were balanced . And the thickness of the soup was perfect too . The meat in it was super tender . 

Both the chili chicken and the garlic chicken were made with boneless chicicken but not dry , and the sauces as requested they made it low oil and dry . The seasonings were perfect . 

Just a suggestion , well is just what I prefer . If the chicken would have been made with leg meat or Thigh meat , it would have tasted way way better and I would have rated u higher .

If u r hungry and don't want to spend much on ur snacks and dinner then this is the best place to be. You will find probably every kind of tibetian stuffs right there at a very affordable price. Personally I love the honey lollipop and pan fried momo. Though the no of tables is much less and given the space there is less probability of expansion the eatery is a hit for it quality and price of food it offers. Added to that is the amicable behavior of the owner and waiters u would certainly love to visit there. I have visited this joint for more than half a dozen times and every time it has delighted me by its sheer good food. So if u like Tibetian food then you can surely visit this place. Promise it won't dissapoint you.

It was on my wishlist for a long time now and I finally visited during the Puja days. The service was way to slow, but I'll attribute it to the heavy pujo rush. Now coming to the food. Some dishes were average while some were absolutely delicious. The must haves that I would recommend are :
1. Cantonese noodles - For someone who likes veggies and gravy noodles. 
2. Singapore fish - The fish was extremely soft and well cooked.
Talking about the prices, all the dishes are minimally priced given the quantity. We were a group of 6 and were billed a sum of 1430/- including 7 bottles of coke. Now that's really cheap, isn't it ? 
The only drawback would be that they don't offer any home delivery.

Starting with the ambience its really cosy with the dim light soft music, bit small in area which causes little bit of sitting problem.except this its a nice place.
Coming to the Foods now ordered Honey lollipop for starter,for the main course we had chicken fried rice,chicken hakka noodles,dry chilli chicken,garlic pork & Chilli duck.The best of the lot was the Honey lollipop,the worst was the Duck as it was very stiff as well it only had bones for us.pork was also a okay dish as it was only the fat 99% & 1% meat.so over all the food is okay, but surely they can make themselves better.
Next coming to the service the waiters can improve as they lack quick response to the used plates to be removed from the table.
So over all its a nice pocket friendly place to hang around for some good food.

All this time we'd been going to City Centre and eating the same old food at Hangout! Conveniently located inside Gorkha Bhawan, The Darjeeling is definitely one of the hidden gems of this city. Food is amazing - if you love pork, do not forget to order AT LEAST ONE plate of their steamed pork momos. Service is swift, friendly and somewhat informal (which is a plus in my books) and the ambient music selection beats that of most other places in this category.

Went to this place on a recommendation just today with a bunch of friends.The management was very efficient, in that we didn't really have to wait for long (The staff told me 25, it didn't take longer than 15) to get a table, even during Puja timings!¬†The whole atmosphere was awesome! In the backdrop they played songs from artists like The Scorpions, which, personally, for a music lover like me is a big plus! The staff were really nice and friendly!Coming to the food.

I really didn't expect much from the food as we had come during Pujo time, which is as it is, rushed and hence food may not have been optimal.But:1) Crispy Chilli Babycorn: We had ordered this for our vegan friend. However, it was so good we ended up eating most of it :P2) Pork Momos: The only time I had ever had momos with that explosion of juice whenever you take a bite was in Darjeeling itself, Kunga Restaurant. It had forever set the bar for me when it comes to Momos. I'm glad I found a place for momos just like it!3) Hunan Chicken: This was really tasty. Spicy, but not too.(TL;DR :Ambience: 5/5Food: 5/5Hospitality: 5/5
Overall: 5/5)Whenever we go to CC, I'll make it a point to visit this joint instead of the stale food court. :)

I had bookmarked this place since a long time, and finally visited on my birthday today.
Both my friend and I had assumed that it would not be up to The Blue Poppy's standards, but we were proved wrong for this place surpassed all expectations.
We visited in the evening, and were welcomed by the smiling staff and a pleasing ambience, hanging lights and soft music.
Coming to the food, we ordered non-veg kothay, a kind of a momo, which is steamed on one side, and fried on the other. It was perfectly done, soft and succulent on one side, and crispy on the other. It came with a spicy momo sauce, which, I regret to say, was better at The Blue Poppy's. For the starter, we ordered Chicken Taipei (on the house's suggestion) and were totally satisfied. It was medium spicy with a tangy zing, and was garnished with chilli-garlic sauce, fried onions and bell peppers.
For the mains we ordered Chicken thukpa which was great, except for the fact that they had used eggs with chicken, and I felt the eggs lent a slightly foul taste. But overall it was pretty good. We also ordered Chicken burnt garlic rice and chicken with stir fried vegetables, both of which were great.
I was interested to try out their pork items, but my friend wasn't too keen, so I hope to visit again for their pork dishes.
The prompt and pleasant service along with the reasonable pricing (they don't charge taxes) and AMAZING food made it a great experience.
Overall a must-visit for all the foodies out there !!

One my favorite haunts. The place is quaint and unassuming. The lighting could do with some attention though. The mixed meifoon is my pick of the litter. Come winter you want to order the rai ka saag with pork.

Now since I am talking about pork, let's get one thing clear. The pork served here can be a bit daunting though. They serve it like back in the country side, you know the rind,the fat and then a tiny sliver of meat.

Five stars today, they served me pork minus the fat on request. 

Make sure to ask for the gota dall√® chilly to go with the mono sauce.

This is the place where blue poppy used to be . I was very unaware that everything has changed . I landed at the place expecting that it's still run by blue poppy management but with a different name . The ambience has surely improved but very sadly I was not so happy with the food . 

We ordered for Veg wonton soup and pork thukpa . Veg wonton soup was delicious . Wanton sheets had perfect filling . I don't know about the pork thukpa as I am a vegetarian but my friend who tasted it said it was nice . Coming to the momos we ordered for 3 plates of steamed momos which were served with thukpa.  The momos at blue poppy were more to my liking . 
The veg thukpa was just OK . 
The momos had usual onion filling but we're little raw from inside unlike blue poppy whose onions are clear and soft . The momo sauce was a turn of . I loved the super spicy sauce of blue poppy and this one was a bit tangy . Overall a nice place to eat but not particularly on my favorites list .

We went to this place quite by chance. Had stepped in to the Gorkhobhavan thinking it is Blue Poppy but was notified that it had shifted elsewhere in Salt Lake- near Building More. Although hesitant, we thought to give this place a try. And we were not disappointed in the least. It served north eastern ad oriental cuisines, quite in the line of Blue Poppy. However, I choose to say this- that barring the momos- which Blue Poppy can still give trumps to any other eateries in Kolkata- the food here is better. The coriander lemon chicken soup that we ordered turned out to be an exceptional preparation. It was a riot with the taste buds. 
The pork pan fried momo was good- but I still prefer Blue Poppy‚Äôs ones. However, to their credit I would add that the dish here was not swathed in sauce as it is in Blue Poppy. Sorry, the constant comparison here is unintentional- but unable to overcome it. 
The other items we ordered were Chicken American Chopsuey, Gravy Noodles, Red Pepper Chicken and Lemonade. Everything was cooked to satisfaction. 
Update
Since my first visit, have made some more expeditions to this place quite drawn by flavors. Around the next times- had tried out Chicken drumsticks in Shangdong sauce which was a mind blowing experience. Also, liked their Chicken sweet corn soup, the Chilly Pork, and Cumin Pork with Crushed Chilly. I liked some of what was served although my various companions who had visited with me were of differing opinions over various items in the orders.

Embarrassment! That's the word which is actually playing in my mind right now. 
The Blue poppy was heaven and am truly missing it's flavoursome Chinese dishes.
Well to start with , we ordered Drums of Heaven with shongkong whatever... It was really a nightmare of a dish. There were some seeds provided with the Drumstick dish which they call something in Nepali that was yuck!
What we liked was the Cumin Pork with Crushed Chilly that tasted good.
Then came all the Mixed Hakka noodles and Fried rice which had nothing special in it to taste something exquisite. The Chicken was not boiled properly and it actually lost its tenderness when served in Garlic Gravy. 
Only Service was courteous! 
I would say better avoid this place unless and until it's necessary to eat Chinese dish with pocket friendly price.

Read a lot of good things about this place in reviews but I'm disappointed to say it's not worth it. The ambience is poor and so is the food. The price is very low and the food tastes quite bad.

Visited a few hours ago. Actually this pocket friendly place is one of our most favorite restaurants for its convenient location and more or less good food at moderate price. We ordered pork momo, which is the best momo we've ever tasted. It was as usually awesome. Chicken schezwan noodles and Fried rice were also good. But that particular dish which spoiled our evening is Duck Manchurian. It was overcooked and burnt with salt, which was a complete mess. Quite disappointed.

Yesterday evening,I was supposed to go to Paris cafe with a friend but since he was in a hurry to go back to santoshpur we decided to go to "the darjeeling" a new joint which has come up in place of the amazing blue poppy... The decor has changed ...a little too dim but I liked the chandeliers ...they brought an Oriental feel in the overall ambience.. We ordered pork momo and chicken shapta along with pepper mushroom.. The momos were tasty but their predecessors cooked heavenly momos..and these were a far cry from tbp momos... The chicken shapta was exemplary... Succulent with that Tibetan flavour...it made my day!! The pepper mushroom was a treat too...crispy and yummy its one of the best I ever had...and yes,we also packed chilly potato for home and it was unanimously voted as excellent!! Small glitches aside the service was good too...just employ some more staffs... üòá all in all,a good gastronomic experience...

Four of us went there for a snack and it was my first visit after The Blue Poppy was shifted. The Darjeeling almost maintains the quality of food. Soups were decent, though the presentation of food was odd. We ordered two types of momos, one steamed chicken and another fried pork. Being a pork lover, the fried momo was a delight.
I would suggest everyone who is going to visit this place to try cumin pork with crushed chili, and any of the meifoons ( read rice noodles ).

After reading the reviews and reading the low rating, I decided to take the risk and visit the restaurant. 
That was my big mistake!!!
My experience: The restaurant entrance will freak you out!! Dirty, not lighted properly. Inside the restaurant again it's dim, which makes it appear shady.  
They don't know anything about presentation, so you don't get any confidence from there. 
I don't think the food is freshly prepared, as it appeared that they reheat and serve you. May be the old stock which was prepared for the whole day. 
My advice: 
1. start offering buffet. 
2. Please reject the old stock.

We went to this restaurant last to last week ¬†for a quick lunch between office hours. Wanted to try a new restaurant, so we thought, at the location like Saltlake, beside City Center, what could go wrong?

Well, we were wrong. The food was horrible, to say the least. In fact, this is by far the worst Chinese I have had in recent times. The cutlery was dirty, food had a bad smell and the staff was inattentive.

Those who are looking out for newer restaurants in this area, please avoid this place. This is not worth your time or money.

To start with, I had been several times to Blue Poppy which used to be here at the place of The Darjeeling restaurant. And I was pretty heartbroken to learn that Blue Poppy is no more here at Saltlake Sector-1. But then when yesterday I had my first lunch at The Darjeeling I realized that I am not going to miss the magic of TBP to that extent. The food remains all the same here, in addition to it the service and ambiance has improved to a great extent (in comparison to TBP) that is indeed pretty exciting in itself!

LOCATION -----  It is located just beside Saltlake City Centre Mall, at the ground floor of Gorkha Bhawan. For old TBP loyalists, you surely know this place very well :) You can safely park your car inside City Centre. 

AMBIANCE ----- The place is not that big, but still it is not cramped up either. The tables are bit spread out, and with less crowd around you feel a lot relaxed here. It is a neat little place serving great Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. There you will find wooden plank ceiling with red Chinese lamps hanging all over the place. The music deserves a special mention since they play very chosen Western soft rock numbers which are always pleasing to the ears like that of Coldplay, Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, etc. Considering it is a budget eating joint the ambiance is really commendable. The place has a black-board where you will find special dishes of the day written with chalk, infact we went for a newly introduced Pork dish after reading from that board itself (which was not there in the menu card). The owner Mr. Lalit was very polite and friendly, it was great having a candid conversation with him, he even came up to our table to enquire about the food and overall experience!

FOOD ----- We went in for a mix of Tibetan and Chinese dishes. Here are the names of the items we ordered:

a) ¬†Steamed Chicken Momo: ¬†The steamed momos were served in a custom made plate with attached bowl for the red chilly sauce. The sauce was really well made, I would have liked it to be even more spicy though :) Also a separate bowl of clear chicken soup was provided with this plate of momos. There were total 8 momos in this plate which were very good to taste, but they were bit less juicy and the filling was tad too tight with bit tough skin at the edges.

b) ¬†Chicken Kothay: ¬†I just loved this plate of Chicken Kothay. It is basically streamed momos with a fried base, but it tasted quite different and much better than the momos. It had one typical aroma and was very juicy, served with red chilly paste. I will surely try the pork variant next time.

c) ¬†Chicken Shapta: ¬†The chicken Shapta that TBP served couple of years back was much better (that was mostly prepared on high heat so that the oil used to come out oozing more aroma and taste) than what we had here. The gravy here had very little characteristics compared to that old Shapta which I had tasted. But if you are trying this dish out for the first time you will surely love it. It actually tasted good, bit tangy and medium spicy. The sliced chicken slices were very well cooked and were pretty juicy. 

d) ¬†Cumin Pork with Crushed Chilly: ¬†This was one of the star dishes I had at this place, surely they serve lovely pork dishes. The pork was extremely well cooked and cut into thin slices. It was really spicy and tasted simply amazing! Overall the dish was dry and the little onion and red chilli paste which was all over the pork pieces was just heavenly. This dish has been newly introduced and it is not in their printed menu as of now. Do remember to order this. Must Try!

e) ¬†Chicken Meifoon: ¬†This was another star dish, loved every bit of it along with the Cumin Pork. The rice noodles used were of high quality and it had ample quantity of sliced veggies and chicken chunks.
f) ¬†Cantonese Mixed Noodles: ¬†It was bit different from regular gravy noodles that we have, it has a consistently mixed gravy which was not so thick, neither the noodles were bit fried. It was just normal (bit thicker) noodles in a nice light gravy. I loved the overall taste and the plenty of veggies in it. The dish had pork, chicken, etc which overall made it even more interesting and palatable. 

g) ¬†Soft Drinks: ¬†Nice to wash down the food with some soft drinks. We went in for Thumps up and Coke, but we were bit let down since the soft drinks were not that chilled.

SERVICE ----- The service is really prompt and the waiters are extremely courteous. The person serving us, called Chandan was one of the best servers I had come across in such a budget eating joint. He was extremely polite, well-informed, warm and helpful. Just a note - Prices in menu are inclusive of taxes are are extremely reasonable. 

OVERALL ----- Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.9/5
Food quality: 4.2/5
Food presentation: 3.6/5
Ambiance: 3.8/5
Value for money: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5

It‚Äôs a big thumps up from my end. A fitting replacement for TBP with much better ambiance and lovely music. Try out the Pork dishes if you are here, they are amazing and really well prepared! One of the best budget eating joints around, do visit them soon and you won‚Äôt regret!

Cheers!

We have visited this place twice and would love to go back again.. A taste of mountains in a small cosy place with a college canteen like decor.. The decor is something they can definitely work on, but who cares when the food is good, value for money. On our first time we tasted Bhutwa ( dried chciken in cumin and spices) , a week's special, chciken shaplay and thukpa. On our second visit we had cumin pork ( nicely fried pork slices in an array of spices ) , pepper chicken (which tasted more like crispy chicken but was nicely made), both being the week's special and chicken shapta. I really loved the bhutwa and shapta and looking forward to trying their momos next time!

After reading the reviews here on Zomato I was really looking forward to going there to this restaurant. But was extremely disappointed. Have been wanting to have some great momos for a very long time. But either the stuffings were too less or the dough was too thick. Something just went missing here and there. Hence after reading that the momos here were excellent and light and juicy I couldn't control myself but force a friend to come and join me for lunch @ The Darjeeling. 
To my disappointment they couldn't serve me pork momos that too at peak lunch time. So we had to settle for chicken whose stuffing was dry, and the dough soo thick and chewy that I had to struggle cutting it with my fork. The Thukpa was watery but decent till I ate a prawn which was again not cured as it stinked. 
As far as the place is concerned it was hot outside and no relief inside either as their single AC was not working properly. 
The only saving grace was the service. Very polite and well mannered and the food whatever it was, was served without too much of waiting. Hence the rating.

This new joint opened in the place known for the blue poppy is doing proper justice to Chinese and Tibetian Cuisine. Proper destination to have Chinese without hurting your pocket. Their Konjee Crispy Chicken us awesome. The Manchow soup was really worth it given the price they come at. You will get very friendly waiters who will help you with the menu selection. They offer tibetian foods as well and are delicious. In short you just won't regret a visit. In fact you will just love it given its price and rich taste.

The name first of all is so so apt. Small and cozy with dim lights but a great homely feeling. May not be proper for a big family dinner/lunch but for a hangout with friends it's great and if you are a foodie, this is the place you need to be in. Had momo, chopsuey and pork shapta each better than the other.. So the pork shapta . The most important thing is , the place is really pocket friendly. Plus you get all the regional North East local delicacies along with bhutani and nepali food.

Overall rating should be 3.
Good points-
Location is good
Service is promt
Extremely reasonable price
More or less good taste in average

Bad points
Problem in parking
Ambience is below average. You can see lots of unnecessary things spread in the restaurant itself like torn curtains etc.


Food experience-
Ordered dry garlic fish as a starter but the waiter came back after few minutes saying they will not be to serve the same because they are running out of fish stock.
So order chili pepper as starter. Which was okay.
Then ordered chicjen thupka & pan fried chicken chow. Thupka was better than the pan fried one. The materials used was not up to the mark.

Verdict -
Chinese lovers will not miss something important if not visited this place.

Because I am a momo lover, I always love to come over to this place. Earlier "The Blue Poppy" was in this location, which got shifted to Sector 3. But the food didn't change, only the name and cook did.
One of the best joint for Tibetan food in Sector 5. This is a very small joint, with dimly lit Chinese lanterns and they play some good music as well. The food is as always very goodand it is pocket friendly too. A must visit for the momo lovers. :)

On my colleague strong¬†recommendation I visited the place last Saturday. I tried vegetable steam momo's¬† and I can assure you these are the best momo's in entire Calcutta as I tried with other momo brand and restaurant.They serve steam momo's with soup and chutney.¬†The soup is¬†equally good.Along with this I also¬†ordered ¬†yumtom soup which was amazing, had a good soup after a long time. The soup is prepared fresh and was having good texture.The ambience is nice and calm. They don't bother you much by asking your order repeatedly. The staff lets you take your own time to decide what actually you want to order and on request from you he will advice you best in the menu. The place is little small and cozy but it does not mean that you have to cramp your self and find a space.¬† The layout is done nicely. The music played is soothing to ears and does not hit¬†your ear drums at the same time you can talk to person next to you easily.I strongly recommend this place if you really wanna try authentic Chinese food, I bet this is the right place .Thanks.

Darjeeling is located right outside City Centre-I, in Gorkha Bhavan (where the old Blue Poppy used to be). Last week, after hearing good reviews about this place, I decided to visit this restaurant with my friends. 

It's dimly lit, no decor, with good country music in the background. There was just one server manning around 7 tables. Heavily understaffed! When the server finally came to us with the menu, he made some suggestions and we ordered Steamed Momos, Singaporean Chilly Potato, Chinese Salad, Burnt Garlic Fried Rice and Chicken Bhutwa (specialty of the day on the board).

The food took a while (read 25 minutes) to arrive. The Momos were served with a Clear soup and Momo Sauce. While the Soup was filled with coriander, to my utter distaste and the sauce was too dilute and watery, the Momos just melted in my mouth. They were so soft and succulent, unlike the Blue Poppy ones which of late, have become thick skinned with less filling.

The Burnt Garlic Fried was very good, and the Chilly Potato was fine too,-although it was a tad bland and didn't taste anything like Chilly Potato, but more like an Indian dish, it was good nevertheless. The Chinese Salad was crispy fried noodles, tossed with some bell peppers and lots of chillies in lemon juice. It was good, nothing exceptional. The Chicken Bhutwa, again, tasted like an Indian preparation, but it was good. The server told us that it would be Dried Chicken tossed in cumin and other spices and sauteed.¬†

The serving portions are decent, but Darjeeling has a lot of catching up to do if it means to compete with the likes of Blue Poppy on the counts of VFM, taste, service, etc. (Prices are similar to Blue Poppy)

So, the ratings for Darjeeling would be as follows:   

FOOD: 3/5

SERVICE: 2.5/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 3.5/5

"The Darjeeling" took over this spot from "The Blue Poppy" recently after they moved and has done absolute justice to the old place.

The ambience remains to be almost the same as it was earlier but now it's a bit more dimmer. The food here never disappointed me and this new brand is doing a good job in terms of quality and customer satisfaction. The people are polite and humble but the service is a bit slow compared to how it was under TBP. I'm sure they'll get it taken care of with time. It's a good option for people looking for good Tibetan food at reasonable rates.

PATHETIC FOOD. I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW AT 3:42 IN THE NIGHT AFTER HAVING THROWN UP TWICE.

I was at this place today visiting after work along with three of my friends catching up after a long time.
As soon as we entered and sat down we tried placing the order. There was no chicken available in the restaurant and the waiter told us that all the chicken stock was in the ongoing food festival at city centre. We ordered 3 steamed momos (chicken) and my friends being pork savvy (personally, I hate pork) ordered a plate of pork momos along with it. The waiter told us there was no pork momos but there's pork dish available opposite to how chicken momo was available and chicken dish not. Since we were 4, we thought a plate of rice and noodles along with 2 side dishes would suffice. The waiter insisted that we order 4 plates of noodles / rice. Finally we ordered 3 - a plate of garlic fried rice, egg noodles and mixed noodles a chilli fish and chilli pork. The order arrived after 35 minutes after a lot of pestering, requesting and pampering. Also, water wasn't served to us right from the time we sat till the time we got up. I pestered all the waiters (there were just 2 in number) to give me a bottle of mineral water which I got right before 10 minutes we were served with the order. Yes. 25 minutes after we sat and that too by another waiter who didn't take our order. The rice / noodles didn't even seem sufficient for a single person to consume. Perhaps the lack of heart in making the dish was also reflected in how it was served and the quantity too. The egg noodles seemed to have been cooked together and there was smell of uncooked eggs all over the noodles. The fish had a very weird smell and made me doubt after every bite I took. I felt uneasy on my stomach and was getting these weird acidic burps after we finished eating. I couldn't sleep till 3 in the night and finally threw up twice seeing all the shitty fish on my sink along with the cabbage and carrots that was served in the soup along with the momos. The reason why I am giving 1.0 is for how the momos were served (0.8) and their taste (0.2). If this is the kind of food that is served I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemies too. 

Yes. Till 3 in the night I couldn't sleep deciding whether to Puke or not to Puke. Finally I puked around 3:10 and then around 3:50. 

There was a swimming pool outside the place that was stuffed to a garden. They should do the same with the restaurant.

This is a small resturant¬† opposite to the city center near Gorkha Bhawan Saltlake.we made our visit there today for a team lunch from office. The staffs there are well behaved¬† and ambience was good.We ordered some starter starting with a soup(lung-fung soup). It is more or less good.Then we tasted kothai,a kind of momo dish. It is worth to taste¬† all kind of momo there.Baby corn,Tigh chicken were there and more or less not bad(That means not too good as well). But What I liked most was Hunnun pork, believe me it was superb......

Then come to the main course . we ordered Hongkong rice and chili chicken .They¬† took too much time to serve the foods. All over good.But to be fair if you ask me to rate Darjeeling, I cann't give more than 2 out of 5.But Price is pocket friendly that I must say.

One more thing,You cann't have card payment option there as of now, so be carefull in that case.

A small place that recently introduced itself before me. This restaurant is located near cc1 and has made its name very fast. We encountered this place on our way to cc1. Beforehand the area was occupied by the well known 'blue poppy' which i never got a chance to visit before they closed down here. Now the darjeeling has took this place over and are serving their customers pretty well which actually made up for my sorrow of not being able to visit the blue poppy. Pocket friendly restaurants with good ambience is very rare around the salt lake area so this place has actually attracted more customers due to its location. We were literally hounding for such a place and the darjeeling happened to us just when it needed to.

Till now i have visited this place many times but never got to jot down my experiences.
The place from outside itself looks very attractive and romantic with all the red Tibetan lights hanging up. It has a very dim lit ambience which is perfect for casual dates. They have outside seating arrangements even,though not very vast with only 1 or 2 tables. We preferred to dine inside every time we dropped in here. The inside of this place is really soothing with beautiful tracks being played on the background to cool you down and loosen you up. Though the place is a bit cramped up still we manage to be comfortable every time. The air conditioner doesn't work quite well and is mostly humid inside. A big stand fan in the middle only cools down the people sitting on the adjacent table so if you are lucky enough you may manage yourself a seat beside the fan.

The food here is incredible..simply awesome. They have a wide range of tibetan and chinese delicacies. Among them we love their chicken pakora which is totally tempting and attracts us each time we visit there therefore differing us from trying their other items among starters. Still have tried their crispy chicken,among main course we have had their chicken burnt garlic fried rice,traditional chicken fried rice,chicken meifoon and etc. Each and every item here are upto the mark. No single item disappointed me. Every chicken item made are stuffed with generous amount of chicken pieces and are cooked perfectly with everything in its right amount. The quantity is enough for 2 people and too much for a single person. Quality of rice,meat everything is brilliant.
The service is not that prompt. Waiters need to improve on their pace of service. Water is not always provided before you ask for it. Since they are going high on their demand,hiring 1 or 2 more people is suggested. The waiters for now are very polite and always serves with a smile and are ready to help whenever you ask for it.

In a nutshell,the place is improving on its work day by day and is highly recommended whenever you want to go easy on your pockets but at the same time want to fulfil your cravings. A bit improvement on their ac during summer days and adding on people for service would be a cherry on the cake.:-)

Any kind of food tastes a lot better than it actually is when one is hungry. I have had the experience of eating at The Darjeeling when I was both hungry and wanted to sit at one place where there was good food as well as very economical for us, the students.
The restaurant is a little tardy when it comes to its service but at the end it is the food they serve that matters. For a non-gastronmic person such as me, a visit to this restaurant is something that I look forward to. The Tibetan cuisine is flavoursome and is served hot and fresh. Ranging from thukpa to dumplings, momos to the usual main course, everything is spot on.
It is very pocket friendly. All that I and my friend had to pay was around 450 total. I hope they can keep it up in future.
The decor is something that they need to work on but then again why judge a book by its cover?

The Darjeeling has been around for quite some time now at the Gorkhaland Bhawan, occupying the space vacated by The Blue Poppy. The decor has been done up with a mellow ambience and red chandeliers illuminating the tables. There is also the option of sitting outside in the lawn.

I have been thinking of visiting this restaurant for a long time now and so ultimately we did a takeaway. The menu is pretty similar to blue poppy albeit the items are less in the tibetan and nepalese section. We ordered and our meal was ready in about 15 minutes.
Coming to the food - the steamed chicken momos were good but could do with a little less salt. The mixed meifoon was ok. But the star of place went to the Mixed Burnt Garlic Rice and the Chicken in Oyster Sauce - both of which were nothing short of awesome.
Would definitely recommend as it is also easy on the pocket. Will try out the tibetan and nepalese cuisine when i go there next time. Bon apetit!

After my return to Kolkata we decided to go to a new place for lunch, and since we were around salt lake, the Darjeeling popped up in the nearby restaurants search. It is actually located inside Gurkha Bhavan...so it shouldn't be much of a difficulty to find. Our expectations were raised once we read the reviews praising the food there...but unfortunately it didn't turn out so well for us. We ordered pork momo and dragon chicken as suggested by the waiter, but we were soon told that the pork momo was not available then. We opted for chicken which arrived quite late and was nothing to write home about. Although other reviews suggest otherwise, i was not delighted with the momo. And then came the shocker. The dragon chicken which the waiter suggested would be less spicy turned out so spicy i nearly burned my mouth. We requested for a modification of the dish but even after that it was none the less spicy. We eventually took it home but it ultimately ended up as waste. We had later ordered chicken fried rice and chilly chicken but the food was not what we expected. The service was not satisfactory since i had to repeatedly ask for water and prices are mediocre. I would like to visit it once more to see if we had a one bad day there and if its actually good, but my first experience at the Darjeeling was not a happy one.

The Darjeeling is located where The Blue Poppy was located before, the decor is a little too dark for my liking. The food is below average and the Chilli Pork served with Bell peppers was not at all up to the mark. Infact the thickly cut prices were little under done. The chicken preparation Hong Kong chicken was coloured with a crazy red colour.... Only thing that was good was the Kawri, hand made Tibetan macoroni in a soup. Pretty delicious. Wish they would improve their standard of food.

A restaurant in place of Blue Poppy. The ambience is definitely ebter, with the new air conditioners in place. Food wise, Blue Poppy had set a standard, hence these guys have to catch up with that!

Staff behavior is upto the mark.

Blue Poopy to the Blues... And in comes Darjeeling. The same menu and same taste. The staffs are different though. They have weekly specialities now which I dont remember was there earlier.
Momo tastes the same, at its succulent best, even after the change of names. The pork shapta was on a deteriorating side but still great.
I would say, Blue Poppy is known for their pork but Darjeeling just may not be.

The entire staff is very friendly and polite in behaviour...coming to the food it's simply awesome......u cannot imagine such yummilicious food in such price. It's very pocket friendly it won't burn a hole in your pocket...would definitely visit there next time to try some tibetian cuisines. :)

My friends and I went to this restaurant as an experiment. We ordered a mixed fried rice, a chicken rice noodles, a sweet and sour chicken and duck. The fried rice had TOO MUCH SALT in it! And the duck was TERRIBLE. I mean, first I tried slicing it with my spoon, which turned out impossible, after which I tried lifting it up with my spoon and tearing it with my teeth and failing to do even that, I tried lifting it up with my hand and pulling it with my teeth and finally managed to seperate the meat from the bones after which I found no use trying to chew it as I tried doing so for an entire minute, after which I had to swallow it whole! And after complainining they offer to boil it again which to our dismay made no difference!

A nice, cosy restaurant with a good ambience. Chinese dishes that we tried were okay-ish. But the problem lied with the Duck we ordered; it was undercooked. Apart from the Duck everything else was at par. Nothing execpetional.

The darjeeling, a newly opened tibetian joint which was formerly occupied by The Blue Poppy.. Since blue poppy was shifted from Sector I, budget friendly quality tibetian/chinese food was hard to find in this area,but with the addition of Darjeeling the problem has been reduced to its minimum..

Located inside Gorkha Bhawan in Sector I, Salt Lake, very close from City Center 1.

This place is dimly lit with small bulbs covered in red lampshades hung from ceiling,scattered all over the place. A single AC along with a few fans are installed to give a more comfortable dining experience.Famous tracks starting from Nirvana to George Michael, Savage Garden to Bryan Adams are played all the time to provide a better experience at this place. A small TV is also hung on one side to leisure you some moments from sporting events. Seating arrangements are found in both either sides of the resturant.

Staff members are well behaved but they does take a lot of time to serve you. Loss of work efficiency is widely noted as they take up more than 10minutes to even serve you water and approach your table for noting down your orders.

Now coming to the quality of their served items. I have been a frequent visitor and had the opportunity of trying out some of their awesome recipes. Their items are not oil rich and Rice Noodles, Chicken Pakora, Crispy chili chicken are some of my favorite at this place and also some of the items i do recommend to my fellow readers. Main course items like Rice Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice and etc are crafted in the best possible way with healthy dices of chicken with ample amount of vegetables shredded to add an extra flavor to the served dish. Each and every item i tasted here was crafted with sheer genius  and i would rate 5/5 on all of their items (which i tasted)

A healthy meal for two would cost 350-450. And yes this place is also a tax free zone.

So to conclude--

==PROS==

QUALITY OF FOOD 

Ambience

Pocket friendly

Behavior of staff members 

A special mention to their choice of music,which does help to add an extra point on their ambiance

==CONS/TO THE OWNERS==

Work efficiency and promt service are missing.

Serving of warm water,they should try to install a cold water filter specially during summer days.

Earlier this place used to be The Blue Poppy but after they moved out the same place is taken over by The Darjeeling.
The moment I moved in realised nothing changed but the name. The menu is almost same. 
Ambiance tend towards shabby side and very basic. However staff were courteous. Nice music quality too. Live match screening option also there.
Tried here Chicken Steam Momo and Pork Steam Momo. I will blindly recommend pork momo due to its lip-smacking taste. 8 pieces per portion cost only INR 100. One of the best momos in town. They have options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner. Timing is mentioned in one of photos uploaded in review.
I will say top 3 momo joints in Kolkata will be Momore, The Blue Poppy and The Darjeeling.

This restaurant is at the ground floor of Gorkha Bhavan, opposite to the city center, salt lake. We have come here numerous times before, but then it was ‚ÄúThe Blue Poppy‚Äù.¬† After shifting of ‚ÄúThe Blue Poppy‚Äù to the Sikkim Bhawan, ‚ÄúThe Darjeeling‚Äù took its place. Blue poppy is one of my favourite pocket- friendly restaurants for casual dining.

So, after noticing the new outlet, we also decided to check it out. And here is what we found-

1.¬†¬† ¬†Interior and decoration is better than before.¬† A beautiful Ganesha at the entrance, colourful Lanterns, and good music made a good set-up, though the light should be a little brighter.
2.¬†¬† ¬†Ambiance and sitting arrangement is cosier.
3.¬†¬† ¬†Air-conditioners are well distributed.
4.¬†¬† ¬†Menu is more or less un-altered, though there is addition of one or two new dishes and taste is also like previous times. Little more tidiness is added, but service should be more prompt.

We ordered ‚Äì
Mixed Chinese choupsy ‚Äì It is a dish containing Pan fried noodles with mixed white gravy, containing boiled oriental vegetables, Prawn, chicken, egg and pork. A dash of pepper and salt would make it perfect.
¬†¬† ¬†
Konjee Crispy Chicken ‚Äì It contains crunchy (not crispy) shredded chicken strips tossed with shredded onions and capsicum with sauce. It tasted little sweet and little salty, nice dish.

Pan-fried Chicken Momo ‚Äì This is the best dish I tasted this day.¬† I ate this dish previously too, but this time it was awesome. Perfect chicken stuffing, not over-fried yet crispy and the sauce overlaying it had the perfect combination of salt, sweet , chilli and sour, also the mild scent of garlic was attractive.

Another thing to mention here, that the stuffs are more polite and wait time for common Chinese items is shorter than the previous restaurant, though it could take a little long for serving thali.

Surely you can check-in and have a quick refueling without hurting the wallet that much (Rs. 400/- to 500/- should be enough for two).

Starting with the ambience, it totally fits in a hill state kind of a feeling, with soft rock playing in background and having red dim light. Coming to the food, we had ordered chicken steam momo, chilly fish dry in starter , and in main course was cantonese mixed noodles ans schzewan chicken. I was honeslty highly impressed with the momo as it gave an authentic taste of the north east and thus rose my expectations for the next course. The mixed cantonese noodles was great, stuffed with alot of vegetables. But sadly, the chilly fish was very bad in taste. Couldnt have it much and this dish was quite a bad experience out there for me. This place wins a brownie point in the pricing system of the menu. It goes very easy on the pocket. Overall, a must try for chinese lovers in reasonable rate.

I know what all of you are thinking: Is it as good as Blue Poppy? Your answer: Definitely yes,and some dishes here are better than Blue Poppy.I've tried their Chicken fried rice,Chinese chopsuey,pan fried momo,chilli babycorn and crispy chilli chicken. Loved every dish. Crispy chilli chicken is amazing,a must try. Really low prices too,around Rs. 10 more or same as blue poppy. 450 more than enough for two,including a starter,main course and a drink.¬†Service: really nice and welcoming staff. Food arrived within 5 to 7 mins of ordering.¬†P.S. Opens at 12:30,not 10 as mentioned here.

As they are at the same place of blue poppy .... I was little sceptical about their quality. Believe me it is really good. Maybe not the service but obviously the taste of the food and the price point which is really wonderful. Though it is not a fine dine restaurant but still if they maintain the food quality and can improve the service a little bit.... Surely it will give you the taste of North east Chinese with total value for money.

This place began with a huge disadvantage.. That of living upto the lofty  standard of the blue poppy. 

Walking in, one can easily make out that the decors have been given an uplift, but sadly that's where the positives cease. 

Coming to service, it is woeful. The tables are cleaned after half a dozen reminders ;the order is taken  nearly 20 minutes after we stepped in and settled down. And well, the food took a full one hour to get served. 

After such an ordeal, had the food been good or even decent, it would still undo most of its shortcomings. 
But the food was no better than roadside Chinese fare. I came to dine with  a strictly vegan friend, and sadly my friend couldn't have beyond one morsel of mushroom as it was indeed very smelly. 
The prices are higher than blue poppy,but why would one pay restaurant rates for roadside quality. 

One big mistake this restaurant.. One that never should have happened!

Ah! This place is a real gem!
After months of whining for Blue Poppy getting closed, finally planned to visit this place.
And, I am surely going to be a regular here. Three visits in less than two weeks suggest nothing else.
The d√©cor is pretty much the same, but now it looks pretty, neat and cosy. They have introduced curtains and very charming lightings. Also, sitting arrangement is more convenient now.
Now, FOOD. We ordered pork steamed momo, pork kotheys, pork chilli garlic noodles, pork shapta, pork sausage.
They serve EXCELLENT momos. The delicate skin, the luscious pork filling, the juiciness, the aroma. They serve momos with a beautiful soup. What else do you want? You'll always keep coming back for their momos.
The pork shapta was pure gem.
Pretty great noodles in great portion with succulent pork pieces.
I didn't enjoy the kotheys much.
Pork sausage was enthralling.
And you'll get that feeling of having very fresh dishes.

Service is fast, clean, courteous.
Price. Um. This place is delightfully cheap.
Oh, and, they play real good music here. :')
Making your visit more worthwhile. I'm giving extra 0.5 for Hinder and Coldplay!

This place is surprisingly underrated and I fail to understand why. With it's dimly lit lamps and lively music, it reminded me of the small but cosy food joints of Darjeeling indeed. We had mixed thukpa on our minds but ordered pork sausages alongside on seeing that on the day's special menu. The sausages were served in onion and capsicum dressing and were delicious. The thukpa too was packed with flavours and was on the spicier side. I believe that this joint deserves an inclusion in the pocket-friendly section as well!
