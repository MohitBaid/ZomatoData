Yet another sweet shop stop with my friends in a pre planned evening. 
Went to this place and asked the sweet shop person about their specialty and they gave us few of their special ones for a try.
all the three items tried were very nice and satisfied my love for sweets.

A small quaint shop, tucked atRamdulal  Sarkar Street. Popular for their spongy Roshogollas and delicious Rabri's, I must admit that these guys excel in these two items. Although, am not a big fan of Roshogollas, but whenever I am around, I do not hesitate to try some from them. The pricing is reasonable, but only if the ambiance could be worked upon!

A not so popular sweet shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street, located bang opposite to "Hedua Chaat" is "Kalicharan Das".
The offerings/variety is limited, but the sweets are no doubt good.
So, if you are looking for an option to savour your sweet tooth at North Kolkata, a visit to this place will not disappoint you.

This shop is located exactly opposite hedua chaat and is a small shop without seats or benches . Though the sweets lack variety , they are good to taste and reasonably priced . Their rosogolla is sponge and the gurer rosogolla is priced at rupees 7 and tastes good. They also have a variety of chocolate sandesh . The shop  is in the same lane as nalin Chandra das and girish Chandra dey sweet shops .
