Noticed the small joint on the way to my friends place in Kalindi. The menu had all food items, vegetarian! We were quite hungry but they did not have any snacks item as such. So we tried their dosa and chutney. It was really good! The other time we packed their roti and dal fry. Prices are extremely reasonable!

Pure Veg : Tasty and Healthy Aaloo Parathas and Tawa Roti's from Kalindi to Nagerbazar. Ideal for Bachelors as well as anybody for takeaways: rotis and Parathas are good . They also serve South Indian dishes like Idli and Masala Dosa. Had aloo dum along with Parathas which was good . Food is also relatively nominally priced. Strongly recommend .

Short on money ? Delicious Vegetarian food ? Then this is the place to be . I'd advice take away though . Very ground to earth staff . Bachelors in Kalindi rely on this place believe me .

Great dosas, vadas , but very uncomfortable seating.  With some bit of involvement of the proprietor things can improve .  Parking not available and credit card not accepted.
