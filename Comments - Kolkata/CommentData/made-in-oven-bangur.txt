I bought red velvet cake and caramel pastry from this well decorated cake shop. The red velvet cake was really nice and lived upto our expectations, but the caramel pastry was not at all good and quite disheartening.

This cake shop is located at bangur.
Here you will find an array of insane pastries and cakes.
I generally order items from here on swiggy.
I tasted mud cake, Mio special, truffle mocha and black forest.
Each and every item tasted good in their own way.
You might be thinking that the truffle mocha and Mio special are same by looking at them but there is slight difference in their tastes.
I would recommend you guys to taste their mud cake which tasted heavenly .

A cute little takeaway joint in Bangur, this place has won my heart thanks to their insane pastries!
I've ordered from this place mainly via swiggy and never been disappointed!
The mio special and truffle mocha pastries can give any reputed patisserie a run for their money! They're just out of the world. Not only is the pricing reasonable (2 pieces for 100), the size is pretty large! The chocolate they use tastes unique somehow and known flavours are used in a delightfully surprising way! Love this place, just pure joyous food!

I had visited the place a week before to order the cake. I took a few truffle cake as take away which was delicious.The girl who took the order was really sweet and took the order carefully.I had ordered a 4 pound 2tier cake with a crown on the top cake.The bakery charged reasonable pricing of 850/lbs for us.The taste was good as many of my guest praised it....though it was a little too sweet to my liking.However I have only one complaint I had given them a design asking them to write 20 on the crown as shown in the picture I had provided them as template design,which was not done.Since it was not exactly in accordance to the order,I am rating a 4/5 but taste wise if you have a sweet tooth you will love their collection.

Eating a Made in Oven caramel pastry is like a dope trip in which you're kissing Benedict Cumberbatch* while listening to his voice whispering in your ears. It is creamier than a cream roll's belly, but also fluffy light like ice cream. The butterscotch heart has crunchy surprises when your tongue gets past the caramel top. Licking it off your fingers is Kama Sutra level bliss, definitely Rated A if you're being watched.¬†
And when it's over, it's like a dream slipping away, so you desperately reach out to grab...another one. To spare yourself the heartbreak, order at least 6 even if you don't intend to share. They stay soft for a long time so you can have them all at leisure. ¬†
If you give them to your mother, she will forgive you all your vices & nag you for more pastries, forever. #truestory¬†

*This is just my choice. Also works with whoever you think is the most attractive being alive.

I found this name in Facebook. RJ Mir posted a photo of cake in the occasion of Poila Boishakh. I liked the design very much. Then I searched the name in Zomato and found that "Made in Oven" is near to my home. So, I decided to order a cake here.

My son's rice ceremony was there in the month of May. So, one fine evening, me and my husband visited the place. The shop is tiny but very neat and clean. The person who was in the shop, was very polite and helpful. After knowing our requirement he showed us numbers of designs. We liked a design (pic is uploaded) and ordered it. It was a 6lb two tier fondant cake with chocolate mousse filling.¬†

The delivery time was appropriate and packaging was good. Everybody in that party (near about 250+ people) liked the design of the cake. (Specially the cot, top of the cake, was made of wood). Now it was the time for tasting. It was a-w-e-s-o-m-e. Each and every person told me that "The taste is too good. From where did you order this cake?" I also tasted a tiny piece (because nothing was left then, everybody finished it!), it was such yummy. The blend of chocolate as well as level of sweetness were absolutely perfect.¬†I am very happy with the end product as well with their professionalism. I will order a new one very soon (may be in my baby's birthday)...

A small shop with big surprises, this is how I describe MIO. Their pastries are to die for. All the pastries are priced around Rs. 40-50 and everything there has a homely touch. I have tasted almost all the pastries and each of them is uniquely delicious in their own way. Their Chicken and cheese corn quiche are out of the world. You can also get party theme cakes at MIO.

I was really excited when one fine evening I received a hamper from Made in Oven. It was efficiently packed and looked great. As I opened the hamper, I was amazed to find a box full of diverse pastries. There were two small boxes, each of which contained a quiche. 

Firstly, let me discuss about the quiches. I received a corn and cheese quiche, and a chicken and rosemary quiche. Both of them were brilliant and very well baked. I loved the corn and cheese quiche for its amazing texture.

The pastries had a lot of variants. There was Made in Oven special truffle pastry which was my favourite. The  Mocha pastry is also a must have. The flavour of coffee was very well balanced. 

Next, I tried chocolate walnut brownie which looked very appealing and tasted great but was somewhat dry. The Extravaganza was a chocolate pastry in a spongy texture, which once again turned out to be excellent.

Now, I'm not at all a fan of lemon tarts or cakes. Infact I stay away from them. But the lemon tart I tried from the hamper was excellent and somehow managed to impress me. The caramel pastry was soft and had layers of cream and caramel. 

Overall, I was pretty impressed by the packing, delivery, taste, texture and variation of the pastries and savouries. So, don't forget to order from this place, be it a pastry or a cake on your birthday or an any occassion. I'd like to thank Made in Oven for pleasing my sweet tooth on that evening. Would definitely visit the bakery/outlet soon.

The city of Kolkata is, at the moment, filled with bakeries. And, why not? We love our sweets, after all! And, one of the newest ones is Made in Oven. I recently received a lovely package of some of their products, for the purpose of tasting and reviewing, and I have to say I was quite impressed. My hamper a rum ball, black forest roll pastry, MIO chef‚Äôs special, truffle mocha pastry, chocolate mud cake, caramel pastry, red velvet cake, lemon tart, chocolate walnut pastry, and chocolate orange cointreau pastry. I loved the variety, and how each item presented a different flavour and taste. 

I love rum balls, but hate how most places tend to make it extremely sweet. But, this one from MOI had just the right amount of sweetness. It was soft and melted in the mouth. The black forest roll pastry had all the goodness of freshly beaten cream and rich dark chocolate, with the twist of being made to look like a Swiss roll! It was beautiful to look at, and absolutely delicious. The chef‚Äôs special was a chocolate pastry that had a very common, triangular look with a creamy flower on top. But it tasted quite extraordinary. Soft, chocolaty layers of cake with gooey layers - it deserves to be called the chef‚Äôs special. The truffle mocha pastry is a must-have for anyone who loves the sinful combination of chocolate and coffee. I absolutely loved this one, because of the dominnt coffee flavours and the incredible texture. 

The chocolate mud cake was more of chocolate ganache in a tart base. I found the tart base a little chewy and hard, rather than crisp, but the gooey, sticky chocolate made everything better. The caramel pastry was something that truly impressed me, even though I am not a huge fan of caramel! I am always afraid of desserts being too sweet, but this one was absolutely right for my palate. It was a welcome change after all the chocolate so far. I tried the red velvet cake next. I found it a little dry, but the layers of cream balanced it out and saved the day. The lemon tart was an absolute delight. I love lemon tarts in all forms, and this one had just the balance that fits my palate perfectly. I tried the chocolate walnut pastry next, and it was so gorgeous, I didn‚Äôt want to touch it. It was quite tasty, and loaded with walnuts, but i found the cake quite dry. The chocolate orange cointreau pastry was again a nice combination of flavours, playing with orange and chocolate together. It was creamy and delicious, and I loved this one!

Altogether, I think MIO has huge potential to be counted among the top bakeries in the city. It is a recommended option for those who are looking for some good desserts and cakes and bakes at a reasonable price, MIO is an excellent place.

If there's any phrase as "Love at first bite", it's applicable for Made in Oven. This is a bakery which needs to be visited ASAP by anybody who has a  sweet tooth.

I was overjoyed on receiving a goodie box from Made in Oven, and I have to thank Ms. Kamalika Ganguli for it. Thankyouuuu so much for making my day.

Since I haven't ever visited the outlet I can't comment on that, but I can vouch for their pastries - Amazing would be an understatement!

Coming straight to the cakes. I received a cutesy box which had 10 killer pastries, about which I'm going to write just now. So let's begin :

1) Lemon Tart - Honestly I detest lemon tarts. But this one is another story altogether! I've never loved any lemon tart this much and I could rate Made in Oven a full score for making me fall in love with it. So now if you hear me saying "I'll have a lemon tart ONLY from Made in Oven", you know the reason why. This was perfect, the balance of the lemony flavour is commendable. Love love loved this one! (Can't believe I'm saying this about a lemon tart!)

2) Caramel Pastry - I LOVE CARAMEL IN ANY FORM!! So this one was a huge hit according to me. The pastry was fluffy and gooey and the had the perfect amount of caramel ganache.

3) Black Forest Roll Pastry - Trust Made in Oven to make the ordinary extraordinary for you! Black Forest Pastries are very common, but have you ever tasted a black forest roll pastry? I assume no! So here goes one of best black forest items I have ever tasted. With every bite, I could understand how fresh the pastry was. Absolutely heavenly!

4) Chocolate Boat - This was a chocolate tart which was loaded with sinful chocolate ganache. Another item which needs to be tasted by every chocoholic. Believe me you can't help but fall in love with this one!

5) Rum ball - I have always avoided rum balls because I always feel like I'm about to die of sugar rush. But hey, this was one piece of good cake that I loved. It was gooey and slightly bitter much to my delight. The perfect rum ball evvvverr!

6) Mud cake - I loved how it looked! And also how it tasted ofcourse! But the glazed chocolate ganache layer made it look gorgeous. This too was presented in a tart shell. Sinful!

7) Chocolate Walnut Brownie - I loved it! Although it was a little dry, the presentation made up for it. Loved the fork impression with the powered sugar.

8) Mio Chef's Special - If you love chocolate pastries, this gorgeous piece of cake has to be on your eat list! It was extremely gooey and left me wanting for more.

9) Truffle Mocha Pastry - Another gooey and sinful creation from Made in Oven! This pastry had 6 layers in total with a layer of coffee cream which made it outstanding. If you love anything which has a tinge of coffee in it, this is the best you can ask for! Absolutely loved it!

10) Red Velvet Pastry - Here comes the BEST of the lot! Having an extreme soft corner for red velvet, I saved up this pastry for last and my oh my! It stole my heart with every bite. This triangular piece of gorgeousness was one of the best red velvet pastry I've ever had!

In conclusion I would like to say that Made in Oven is a must visit! If you want to indulge yourself in perfection, look no further. Made in Oven is here to satisfy your pastry cravings in every possible way.

All my love to Team Made in Oven! Keep baking these amazing cakes!

Kolkata is blessed to have so many adorable bakeries spread across the city! And these days the home bakers have completely changed the scenario for good. They have added that extra sweetness to the ‚ÄòSweetest part of India‚Äô! All these home bakers are extremely talented, passionate and bake with that extra bit of care and love. Recently I got introduced to one such amazing bakery called ‚ÄòMade in Oven‚Äô which operates out of Bangur area. Though I haven‚Äôt been to this place but I had received one amazing hamper from them which stole my heart away! They have got yummy cupcakes, cookies, chocolates, cakes (including designer birthday cakes), breads, pastries, savories, etc. Only one point, I felt the packaging can be made a bit more robust for home delivery, etc since the base of the box was tad wet when I received it. I am sure they will work on this in near future! But keeping in mind their rock bottom pricing, I must say their products are worth every penny. And yes, they do not use preservatives and the products are always prepared fresh. Quality never ever gets compromised here, at any cost! I am sure everyone looks for one such bakery that they can completely trust, especially when they are buying stuffs for their kids!
                                          ...

I cannot thank MADE IN OVEN enough for making my husband's birthday special with the custom-made 'movie-buff' themed cake (pic attached). I am really touched by the way they listened to my requirement and fulfilled it. I ordered for small egg-less cupcakes and they gave me just that. There was no bar on the minimum order amount or anything at all. The packaging was totally tamper-proof and the cakes were soft, light-weight, and tasty. The delivery was right on time, as promised. Keep up the good work!

Secondly the cakes are very nice within the cost especially the customized one. I bought three cakes from here. One 2 lb, and the rest 1 lb.
I'll always order my customized cakes from here. They are made very nicely and the amount of sugar is just sufficient and the sponginess is also at the right amount overall a nice experience :) 
I'll rate 4.5 only because they don't deliver outside :(

The quilling cake was beautifully made, simple yet elegant, something which suited the occasion. Must say, though there wasn't much of complicated designs, but was a bit jeopardize whether it was good enough to order customized stuffs. But I guess we can order some more in near future and hope #makeinoven can blend it in the same way. Would take a point, as I believe the prices are a bit high than usual (compared to other cities and states) moreover taking into consideration the relative cost @kolkata is quite less than others. Usually it's 750-850/kg and designs extra, but the pocket pinch for the qulling was 950/kg.
I hope it gets noted!!
Nevertheless thanks #Kamalika & #MadeInOven

It is located right beside the 'Foodpath' restaurant and opposite of 'Bangur Boys school' in Bangur Avenue.This is a very small and well decorated outlet, but don't judge this place based on that.They serve some delicious desserts at a very affordable price.
We tried Red velvet cake and though it was a little hard but tasted delicious and we
bought some hand made chocolates and they were great also.
Staffs were very friendly and helpful and maintained proper hygiene.
This can be a good option for your Birthday cake, so do give it a try........

We brought a chocolate truffle cake from here once... for celebrating one of my sister's birthday... Did expected more from it... although it looks good... but still I have doubts regarding the taste... after cutting the cake when we put a small piece of it in the mouth... o man it was so delightful... so tasty... and it got finished nearly totally but we controlled ourselves because their were our members to get served... so you can give it a try... Pocket pinch was very reasonable...

Very good cake and pastry shop. We tried Mio special chocolate cake, caramel pastry and red velvet cake. Each was awesome. Will visit again to try out other items. I am deducting 0.5 necks they said their 1 pound chocolate truffle cake costs 600 which seemed a little over priced to me (if I compare even  with kookie jar). But in this locality this seems to be the best shop.

Cute little outlet made me order a theme cake for one of my friend who once demanded to cut watermelon in her bday instead of cake... Was impressed enough with the preparation.. infact it was the first ever bday without a chocolate cake in the never-ending bday parties in my hostel and where the chocolate cake was not being missed. Thanku kamalika for all your efforts. (P.s the mio special chocolate cake pastry was yummy... Loved it.) Only two recommendation first one is a easy to reach location would have been more appreciated and secondly if possible think about home delivery... üòä Thank you again kamalika for your sweet hospitality.

Well, coming straight to the point without much hullabaloo ‚Äì I was grossly disappointed at my experience at this popular outlet! Walked almost a mile (from Lake town to Bangur) in search of this bakery after I read positive reviews about it on Zomato ‚Äì since this is a pretty new joint, bypassers are not much aware of it and you are pretty much on your own to find this place, although, you can locate the same at the Bangur entrance. The outlet is quite small and seating arrangements are just impossible and thus, customers are left with the only option of take-aways (unless, of course, you want to stand outside the outlet and eat). However, it is nice to see that a decent variety of pastries, savouries and cookies are accommodated in the limited space available.

I went for a parcel of their Mio Special pastry and Chocolate pyramid ‚Äì both of which looked very promising, so was the packaging ‚Äì which seemed a brown cardboard box and not the regular cheap paper ones! The Mio Special ‚Äì I guess translates to ‚ÄúMy Special‚Äù - quite lived up to its name ‚Äì and was indeed just toooooooo special ‚Äì I hated to share it with my brother! An almost perfect pastry ‚Äì deep layers of rich chocolate toppled with great choco cream ‚Äì an experience which catapults you to heaven ‚Äì albeit just for a few seconds. Next came the pyramid ‚Äì which also lived up to its name (sarcasm) ‚Äì as it was so stale and sour as if prepared millions of years back by the Pharaohs who also build the ‚ÄúPyramids‚Äù in Egypt. I can still feel that sour flavour in my mouth ‚Äì an experience which just spoiled my entire dinner and the low ratings to this place are entirely owing to this.

Ambience and service are fine ‚Äì and prices not high.

Request the management to serve only fresh items to customers to uphold your brand name in the highly competitive Bangur food market!

My friends got my birthday cake from this store. This small outlet is located in a by-lane of bangur, beside Foodpath Restaurant. Well the cake looked classy & yet pretty at the same time. It was a solid looking chocolate cake, embellished with chocolate stars. They taste was truly delicious. The portion of chocolate was thick and the quality was commendable. Definitely one shop that can give other famous bakery chains of he city a run for their money. A definite recommendation from my end.

This is one hell of a dessert heaven!Situated in Bangur, this is a tiny little dessert shop that has got some of the tastiest treats around.I have, till now tasted the Red Velvet Cake, Black Forest Roll, Lemon Tart and the Chocolate Mud Cake.All of them were a delight to the senses.The red velvet pastry and the black forest roll were very soft and melted in the mouth, the chocolate mud cake was divine and the lemon tart, ¬†well, where do I begin?! I am not much a fan of lemon tarts but having tasted it here, I flipped.Now I am a true blue lemon tart digger and as long as I get lemon tarts from here, I don't think I would ever crave for any other desserts.The chocolate mud cake, another brilliant piece, was very much endowed with gooey chocolate filling and was so sinful.All in all, this tiny marvel of a dessert parlor has charted to the very top of my favotite dessert joints in the city, with numerous more sinful visits, happening soon!

"Made in oven" - with that catchy name they have just stepped into the world of bakery in the city of joy. 

**Location**
Located at the starting corner of bangur avenue block D lane which heads towards the bangur boys school ground.

**Experience**
A small cozy shop where you can find variety of bakery items starting from cakes , pastries and savories etc. All were smelling so fresh and was looking so good that you need not to taste it before choosing the same. 

I was there to buy a birthday cake for a friend without any expectations just for a change in regular brand options around. Took a truffle cake as a parcel and tasted it later on. Yummy rich chocolaty flavor which enriched our taste buds so well that one small piece was never enough for us and had to go for a second one.

**Service**
'Piku'- the boy serving in the outlet has immense caliber and skills in customer service. He was absolutely superb. One thing a had to mention about his honesty which I truly admired. While buying the cake in a hurry I did the payment twice and the guy immediately refusing the payment second time which is really very very commendable. Now that's what I call an example of honesty is the best policy. Respect for him, and I am sure the owner should be the happiest person after discovering this incident.

Hoping and wishing this place all the very best for their future endeavors. Kudos !!!

Ok so I was recommended by a friend regarding this place and as I was running short of time I had to do the booking over the phone. I asked for a half pound butterscotch egg less cake with chocolate toppings. So when I received my delivery this is what I got and it was absolutely superb. Frankly better than I expected. It went far beyond my expectations. The dough was soft. The cream did not stick to the tongue. A perfect blend of butterscotch with caramels. It was also very pocket friendly and was delivered to me at the right time and exactly at the place they had said. 
In short "Extremely Satisfied". Shall try it again. Keep baking :)

I finally got a chance to visit this bakery. Its quite small and has no seating arrangements. 
There is a small display unit and a shelf to display the breads. 
I picked up the lemon tart, mocha cake, chicken quiche and a cookie. 
The cakes are nicely displayed and i liked that the person who packed the pastries was wearing gloves. 
The mocha cake was really nice. The lemon tart was a bit too sour for my taste with a eggy aftertaste. I didnt really like it. 
The cookie was heartshaped and looked really cute. It was quite hard and didnt have a buttery taste which u get with freshly baked cookies. 
Overall its decently priced and has a variety of fresh pastries and the staff was very frendly.

I have been ordering from made in Oven for a while now. Till mio it's been a rather disappointing search for a good baker.

While I haven't tasted all their offerings , the ones I have are delicious. My favorites include plum cake - Soft, moist filled with fruits and just the right amount of sweetness to get you hooked on it.
Almond barquette, truffle cake and lemon tart is yummy.go for their Masala breads and quiches as all. To me it is very important that my baker
1. never compromise on quality And quantity of ingredients. That can significantly alter the taste.
2. Get the right balance in flavors.
3. Always fresh
4. Rich taste but makes you feel light after eating.

And as an added bonus they are rather affordable. So top knotch quality at attractive costs makes mio a must try out for all.

I've been a fan of Made in Oven goodies for a while now. Right from the decadent Christmas plum cakes to the pineapple cake that's not only delicious but a feast for the eyes, to the yummy garlic bread and chicken. 
I had been meaning to have chicken quiches from here for a while now and finally managed to get my hands on some today. It's sheer divinity, to put it simply. Creamy, with succulent pieces of chicken, it's very flavourful. The being pretty big, it's very filling as well. I really enjoyed it, as did my family and in no time all 4 were finished. Being an ardent quiche lover, all I can say is I am very sated and will be ordering again very, very soon! I recommend it highly to everyone. Thank you, Made in Oven!

A shining example being this one. the baked goods are some of the best i have had, and i have had quite a few.¬†The lemon tart and the almond boat are easily my favorite. but what took the cake, was literally, the cake. My family got me a birthday cake, and it was so good, i don't think words can justify it.¬†if you are thinking of visiting this place, don't think twice. or you might be missing out on some of best baked stuff in the city.

Mush was delightful! Tasted amazing and different perfectly tangy and sweet! 
Tart was one of the best I ever had, definitely tops my list!
Tiramisu wasn't up to the mark, lacked coffe but presentation was good!
Behavior of staff was warm! Would love to visit, to try other stuffs!

You can't go wrong with either their savouries or their sweet offerings. Be it the soft, cheesy quiches with a hint of rosemary or the masala cheese bread loaves, everything is just perfect.

Everytime I have ordered from Made in Oven, they have always ensured it made my day. Personally supervised by the owner who is a baking specialist and enthusiast, each of their items are to die for and are absolute value for money. I have been ordering my sister's birthday cake from them for the last 3 years and every year, they have never failed to surprise me. Most importantly, they never compromise on quality and use the best available ingredients for all their products, which assures me about their commitment to their customers. Who said, only home cooked food has a dash of love added as an ingredient? Try them out and I am sure you will be left wanting for more! Thank you Made in Oven for making my every ocassion so special.

I loved the masala bread which was so scrumptious and filling. Also superbly tasty. Just the right masala filling in the bread. This xmas had their plum cakes and then had to reorder twice because my friends kept asking for more. I think Made in Oven could be the next big thing for confectionaries in kolkata. I wish them best because i am a big foodie and i love good food. Must try.

Ordered a hamper of masala breads, lamb strudels, lemon tarts and cheese and ajwain cookies. Order appeared right on time on November 14. The food was perfect, especially the masala bread, which tasted heavenly. I highly recommend everyone to try the masala bread once.

Awesome, fresh and yummilicious cakes. One of the best customized cakes, I bought recently. Had ordered a 10 pound chocolate Birthday cake for my little nephew, who has a crazy obsession about cars. The baker, Kamalika, not only baked one of the best cakes, but was very thoughtful in suggesting a racing car track themed cake. She made it all so easy and accommodated my last minute scheduling. Needless to say, that the cake was an instant hit, appreciated by all guests, especially my nephew who was delighted to see so many cars! Very satisfied with service, budget friendly and highly professional. I will love to go there for future events and highly recommend Made in Oven to everyone.

Chemical free, preservative free and absolutely fresh from the oven cakes, pastries, savouries and deserts are just out of this world. Some of their must try includes Bacon and Cheese Quiche, Almond Barquettes, Truffle Cake, Tiramisu, Panna Cotta, Mudcake, Macaroon, Black Forest Swiss Roll etc.
