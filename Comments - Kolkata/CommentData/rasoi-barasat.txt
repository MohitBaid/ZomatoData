Ordered chicken tikka masala and butter roti. Chicken was very soft like it will melt in your mouth and so was butter roti. Delivery and packaging was good.

'Rasui' is another fine dining restaurant in Birati,my hometown area.'Rasui' is located just opposite of Mahajati Clubat on the 1st floor of Sunshine apartment in birati.Today I've visited here for lunch with my nephew.Ambience is good.Seating arrangements are also good.We have ordered here one plate Chicken Biryani & one plate mixed hakka noodles.Chicken Biryani was little cold,but taste was good.Chicken piece was very good & rice quantity was not good.Mixed hakka noodles are delicious,but quantity is not so good.Try to improve your food quantity.Overall good.Price is also reasonable.

Well decorated. Decent ambience. Good service. Reasonable price range. Food quality can be better. But Mutton Kasha was actually good - spicy yet tasty. Great for a casual meal with family & friends.

Finally a Home Delivery via Zomato with Online & Card payment option restaurant arrives in Birati. Ordering food was quite hassle free & the food arrived before time. The cost of the dishes are quite pocket friendly & worth money. Taste and quantity was decent and by far one of the best restaurant in Birati .
