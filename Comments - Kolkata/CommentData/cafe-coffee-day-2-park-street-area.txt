CCD is Everyone's favorite in town. I don't need to say much about it. But the park street outlet is really cosy. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting area. And is quite big. The coffee designs are so cute, that it makes you go "awwww".

Environment is nice. The upper floor gives you a bit of private space. Well the menu of CCD, though appears to be with plenty of variety but according to me they all taste more or less the same!

Cafe coffee day is everyone's favourite for coffee but what i think is yes it's true. Be it cappuccino or regular tea we crave for it's taste.
Well yes CCD is a bit overpriced but still the coffee is just yumm.

Been here numerous times. Has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements and is good if you wanna chill for a while. Had a watermelon with mint and a cool blue with mint. Both were good. Really love the chilli cheese toastizza and devil's own. Downside- high wait time.. which is not a downside if you're there to just relax with friends.

Located opposite to Au Bon Pain in Park Street... CCD is a wrong choice. This outlet is not so cool, not so good and lot over coffee won't happen here keeping in mind the other outlets. Not disappointed with the sitting arrangement or the staff.. just that this place is boring.. tedium and monotony reigns here.. Also from coffee's to combo everything is expensive here.
Has to work in terms of quality, quantity since Starbucks is opening soon to give CCD a tough competition.

This outlet of CCD is 'not-so-cool' keeping in mind the other outlets. But still it's fine.
Staffs are efficient,ambience is nice....but billing was a bit lagging. Tried out the burger with the hot chocolate. I opted for the Afghan Chicken Burger,the taste was moderate but the hot chocolate was heavenly.
But still this outlet is not up to the mark...
That's it.

despite not so good rating still gave it a go. And I wasn't disappointed. The ambiance is good,staffs are polite. we reached bit early and one of the staff allowed us to sit inside. Ordered the Hot chocolate and Frappe along with smoked chicken sandwich. Tasted really good. Billed amount was around 400. One of the best CCD branch in town.

So I went to this very famous outlet where I ordered Regular cappuccino (which is usually without sugar ;supposedly) and Cold coffee with ice cream. First the AC was not working. After n number of requests to the staff, they kept on telling us that they are resetting the AC. And we had to have our beverage in total humidity. Moreover, let aside AC episode more worse experience was on its way. The cappuccino was heavily loaded with sugar *refer to the first line*. 

When I went up to the manager, he said "mam we don't put sugar in coffee, I hope you know that" I mean first you give unbelievably poor coffee and treat your customers this way. The coffee was lip sticking sweet. Thanks for the bad experience CCD. I will never visit that outlet again.

Worst CCD experience in terms of both food and service!
Like many of the other reviews here, I have the same complaint that this place overcharges you without your knowledge. Moreover, they do not have proper knowledge about what is available and what is not. One attendant said the Magical Brews are available and the other one who took over him said it's not.
They charged me almost ‚Çπ600 for a hot chocolate and sandwich in the name of extra toppings and chips.
The Grilled Chicken and Cheese Sandwich had just a slice of cheese and chicken which wasn't even warm and had no veggies or anything whatsoever! It was just too dry and choking me. Whereas, my experience with the same stuff was better in the other outlet.
The banana chips were awful! Had I known it was banana chips I wouldn't have agreed at all.
The hot chocolate was okay.  Though, overcharged with whipped cream and chocolate sauce (which I couldn't find)! 

I was very impressed with CCD the first time I tried it at the Chadni Chowk outlet. Since then I have been disappointed so many times and now I'm losing my faith.
The food they serve is not consistent over different outlets. At some outlet they will rightly charge as given in the menu and for the same stuff in a different outlet they will charge extra without even explaining why.
I even wonder how can the quality of food and ingredients vary so much from outlet to outlet of CCD! They really need to fix this immediately!

Place- This place is really awesome with fabulous decorations and amazing music. ¬†And is quite good in size, to accommodate enough people in rush hour. I loved the fragrance of the place.

Food- I've tried their ¬†Classic Veg Combo; accompanied by Cappuccino and a mango shot with extra cheese, which makes the feeling totally awesome.

Service was just okey. Although could've been better. If tried by staff in a much faster way.

It isn't something unusual for a coffee lover to drop at Cafe Coffee Day. Also,It isn't unusual to find an outlet at any place. ‚òï

Ambience - Since we headed there for breakfast, the crowd was less. Seating spaces are huge and well maintained. Good musics were being played. 

Food - Had a combo of Chicken Burger and Nachos along with Cold Coffee Frappe. 
*Burger was okay. Could have been made much better. It was slightly disappointing there. 
*Cold Coffee Frappe was really good. 

Service - Service time is really quick and staffs are courteous.

Overall, It's a nice place to visit. üòä

Alert!! We had ordered the cool blue drink which is 130 rs. But when the bill came it was 230. I was so surprised!! Walked to the billing counter and they said coz the waitress asked for flavor they added three of them. They never say its extra and added three of them. Why would I pay so much for a blue drink which I had ordered to kill time. Guys please ask for the 'unknown' charges before you order.

On 15 Jan 2017 at about 10 pm a group of 8 of us  ordered a total of 8 items and were billed a whooping cost of 2400/- On reviewing the bill we found that while the 8 items hardly costed 1200, the add on and extra flavors and ice creams were billed at about 1000 bucks extra! We distinctly asked them not to give any add ons and yet we were presented wit a bill naming so many add ons we never ordered. Also we ordered a black coffee which showed as 130 in the bill and to make the black coffee strong they added another 150 to the goddamn bill! When questioned the guy at the counter instead of apologising and admitting a mistake was giving incredible explanations to the dishonest bill .. ultimately after much argument we were reversed with 600/-
Management pls take note of the dishonest practices in ur flagship cafe .. ur surely losing customers!
And customers pls be wary of their billing.. check and double check and make sure u ask them the cost of the add ons .. add ons cannot be more expensive than the drink/item itself!

Sit with your friends on a lazzy day enjoy some coffee, brownies, smoothies chilli cheese toast... I prefer Devil's own... Ambiance is good.. neat and clean. Little crowded as it is in Park Street. Service is good. Disappointing part is that it is detoriating it's quality of food. Though the price is going up the taste is going down cappuccino has just a frothy layer at the top but it's watery when you start to sip it. Smoothies used to be tasty but to my surprise it has also lost it's charm a little. Don't know why this is happening I would like to request the management to take care of this fact and maintain their quality.

What does one say about this outlet of CCD, other than the fact that the staff manning it need to brush up on their customer service skills!! They need to learn that interaction with customers in the proper manner is crucial in  the F and B industry. If there is a combo offer then they should inform the customer. Moreover they shouldn't try to inflate the bill by the addition of add-on flavours by duping the ignorant and gullible customers.I have always found them inconsistent in their coffee making, sometimes it's good but other times it's bad and I'm unable understand why?? CCD menu and prices are the same everywhere yet there is a difference in the ratings becoz of the staff employed therein.

What to say..... no doubts their coffee espcially the cold coffee ( devil's own ) are to die for but they charge very unreasonably. Went there during puja and ordered one lemonade(which was about rs. 94) and one green apple drink(which was about rs. 112) , when they made the the bill the total amount was about rs. 455
When i saw the bill i noted dat they have added some flavours to the drink each of which was rs. 90 or something. Plus there were taxes.
So be careful while placing your order.... if they insist you about adding anything simply say no.
They are sort of robbing people which i hate about them

After a long walk in park street, we wanted to sip on some magical brews by CCD and entered this outlet. This is a quite spacious outlet with ample seating arrangement. We had ordered the inverted cappuccino and one Ethiopian coffee. The inverted cappuccino was nothing special and it's better to stick to the normal cappuccino. The Ethiopian coffee is one of my favorites and it was made properly by them.

The staff at this branch will try to fleece you so always ask for the bill.
I went with my friend in the evening and ordered a vanilla cappuccino with chocolate sprinkles and an ice tea.
After saying will be provided table service was asked to pay the bill at the counter.
I was told the bill amount is Rs. 520 anyway I paid the amount.
But they refused to hand over the bill even after I paid. And again on asking the third time was I given the bill and was told to wait while he prepared the bill while I was standing there.
The errors in the bill was too many.
1. Whipped cream was added but we never asked or received whipped cream as my friend in weight conscious.
2. Instead of cappuccino was billed for latte
3. And apparently I ordered and received four nutrition bars. ( Guess they were having difficulty coming to 520) 
And finally a bill was given Rs. 518. 
Management please look into it cause you and the customer are both getting duped.

I have recently been to this particular branch and a series of disappointing events occurred to me.
1. when i ordered for a strawberry slush the waiter told me that it wouldn't taste nice without my asking for his opinion.
2. Finally i ordered a strawberry pom smoothie and a cafe nirvana.but when my beverages arrived at the table they were both strawberry pom smoothies and the waiter requested us to overlook as it was a rush hour mistake. 
3. When I got the bill the total amount for one 145 bucks and a 155 bucks serving had come up to 771 bucks. On asking for a clarification they said that the extra charge was because of the ice cream and the whipped cream that i hadn't asked for. The bill showed 290+350+ taxes=771 where as i had received two identical smoothies on my table ( clearly the bill was completely purposely disputed)
4. On a little bit of haggling on my part the cashier suddenly handed me a 100 bucks saying it was for the ice cream. Finally when I burst out with anger,r refused the 100 bucks and asked them to make a proper bill of what i had ordered,they suddenly all got a little scared,offered me a seat and after a few minutes they returned 350 bucks back.
I have been to a number of ccd branches but have never come across such a situation. Please be very careful with your bills and orders if you're visiting this particular branch.
PS . The payment was already made through card.

But the food is average. Coffees are below average if to count the price you pay. Buying two Coffees with ice creams will charge you around 600-700.
No value for money.
Not good quality of food.
You can only have a quality time chatting with your friend and enjoying the ambiance and privacy.

I never leave reviews but decided to write one for this because of my negative experience here. I had to wait for ten mins before any of the staff even acknowledged my presence. Then after I ate (food wasn't anything out of the ordinary), went to pay the bill. Staff was not polite to me at all (here, I noticed they were super polite to all the local people but to me, a Naga, they were very dismissive) and charged me for two items I hadn't even ordered or eaten!!! Very disappointed with this particular CCD. They need to learn to be respectful to all of their customers, not just the locals.

Went to this outlet on a Wednesday afternoon to meet a friend. It was raining hard and the place was around 60% occupied. We ordered Espresso & Cafe Mocha. Espresso was as usual. Cafe Mocha had less proportion of chocolate/ chocolate syrup than the required amount.¬†
Service was fast. Price: The normal CCD rates.

The prices of all coffee standardly billing to around 200 rs, this cafeteria offers more flavour then the price! I found the park street outlet more comfortable than the others. For those who think the pocket pinch may be high you can try out the app. It offers free beans if u get a referral code! And on offering your referral code you'll get an extra 50 beans once your referral has been used! (1 bean= 1 re) 
P.s.- don't have a referral? Use mine's. It's MRIN55 !

The only thing worth it is the choco or mango shots.

Went there for a quick bite. Had a cappuccino and Belgian chocolate shot. Both of them were as usual good. This place really needs innovation when it comes to the food.

I'm a big CCD fan. This outlet is big otherwise ordinary.  They presents same beverages, sandwiches and desserts as other CCD outlet across the city does :). Best part of this outlet is - quite spacious. You don't have to go to counter to order your choice and pay in advance. Staffs are co operative.

Now areas of improvement - service is not prompt, they take a little longer to serve the order. They never maintain a queue while serving the food, I have seen it many times. last but not least there is a sharp difference of price of all beverages and food items than rest of the outlets. ¬†They charges extra service tax not sure why :-|

Its good for a warm cosy evening with your friends or your boyfruend/girlfriend .
I have tried almost every type of coffee thy have on their menu.
Love their Vanilla Capuccino and Cafe Latte. These are my two personal favorites from this CCD outlet!!

Also; the 149 Non Veg Combo is filling and economical.

I always order their garlic bread. No matter what (I love garlic breads)

Cocoa Fantasy and Nutty fudge brownies are a must-try!!

Though CCD has always been one of my anytime choices, this outlet left me disappointed, the reason being their staff behavior.
Firstly, we were seated in the upper section and the AC there was not working and was under repair right in front of the customers. 
Later, as the clock struck 9, we were the only ones seated upstairs. That is when the waiter told us that "apparently" their upper section closes at 9 (no such information had been written anywhere). I told him we weren't going to move. And, yet after 5 minutes another waiter came asking us to shift downstairs. I had a row with the waiter and made it clear that we wouldn't budge.
The food was as good as any other CCD outlet, but this weird behavior wouldn't take me there again.

Have had the most horrible experience here. Had got myself a card from the BD Block outlet at Salt Lake. While I was waiting for my take-away order at Mocambo, I decided to kill some time and dropped in here. Ordered for some Shake, and in the name of toppings and feel good factor, the bill came to around 550 in place of 200 (approximate). I was so astonished, that I literally gave the waiter a good speech before making my way outta here. Although the location is prime and CCD is expanding like dogs and cats, their brand ethics has gone for a toss.

This CCD outlet is located just beside the barque at the park Street and quite a popular one. 
Ever since they have started operation in Kolkata this is one of the oldest outlets of them. 

I have been mentioning this quite a number of times that CCD needs to improve their products and variety in their offerings. It is now a necessity for them from my point of view. Increasing of outlets has made them popular but on the other hand they are loosing their charm which is in a negative for them. I hope management will work on this and live up to the expectations and will raise the bar high.

Though I am not a fan of CCD, went there for some cold beverage to combat the hot summer. Tiramisu smoothie was a nice experience. The name came from the favourite Italian dessert. Actually it's a cold coffee topped with cream, spongy cake and  cookies. Veg cutlet was soft and less cripsy.I had a better experience about it previously.
Staffs are co operative and service is prompt.

I am nothing quite a fan of Cafe Coffee Day, but I must say this is a nice outlet. I had been there with my friends and we had a nice time. I remember having the blue frappe which was really amazing. It was sour and I love sour drinks. The smoked chicken sandwich is also very tasty. I loved it a lot. I think the food they serve is quite decent and nice, but the prices often seem bizarre, particularly for the coffee. Love the shots too, and there price is definitely not an issue. If everything gets priced a little less, I am sure this place and all other Cafe Coffee Day outlets are bound to flourish!

I do not know whether it is the right outlet or not becauae I cannot find it on the list. This review is for the CCD outlet which is adjascent to Tung Fong. This is clearly the worst CCD in town in terms of service. It was horrible and the staff were horryfying.

You order something and they give you some other thing and when you point it out to them they become arrogant. This is such an embarassment. The hot coffee arrives cold and they do not bother to give you the change. This outlet is a big disappointment for the cafe chain.

On a different note, CCD should stop stealing money from its customers. It something charges extra then say that before you forcefully include it in the item. They never tell you if something charges extra and you find it on your bill. They add it without telling you that it is separate and carries extra charge. This is purely dacoity. They must change this. Shame on you CCD.

Its raining and you're in park street , the first thing hits your mind is coffee, and coffee means cafe coffee day.

This outlet is just beside McDonalds and barista.
It is quite spacious and soothing.

So I ordered one combo that has hazelnut hot coffee with a choice of pastry Carrot cream/ chocolate brownie.
I went totally chocolaty and ordered hazelnut hot coffee with chocolate brownie and Oreo crushed cold coffee.

‚Ä¢ Hazelnut cappuccino was nice.
‚Ä¢ Chocolate brownie was extra sweet.
‚Ä¢ Oreo crushed cold coffee was amazing.

They're about to introduce new beverages in menu.

Every CCDs have the same services and foods available and so this outlet. What makes this outlet a class apart from others is its location and its ambience. Its a small place but very smartly decorated to accommodate quite number of people. I felt from other ccds; staffs here are quite in number. Service is good. Nothing else to get special mention. Everything is like other ccds.

I visited this outlet of ccd with my friends for a small hangout.
The first thing that caught my eyes was the layout simply because of the ample space given to this outlet but unfortunately we couldn't get a seat in the upper level so had to settle ourselves in the bottom level.
So our orders comprised of:-
1. Cocoa frappe= 1 of our friend had ordered it so cant comment upon it.

2. Cappuchino= Again a friend of our's had ordered it & she found it good enough

3. Crunchy frappe= This was for the rest of the gang but i was personally very disappointed with it simply because it was very runny & wasn't thick like the usual frappes. I even felt sorry for my friends since most of them tried it for the first time based on my recommendation.

Another thing that i felt inadequate about this outlet was the staff service. I found them to be inattentive & aloof. Hopefully they can improve on it.

It was a warm sunny day and i and my friend wanted to chill at some nearby cafe. This ccd oultet was close and we visited this. It is similar to the other outlets. My friend made the order coz she had been to ccd several times. We ordered for two deserts. One item was chocolate fantasy. Both were very tasty and we loved every bite of each item. The prices are expensive but the food makes up for it. Its a nice place for a hangout !!

An OK place just like other CCDs these days. Same old menu. The coffee taste has deteriorated since I came here last time. Staff behavior is also not that friendly anymore. Just the seating arrangement and privacy is what I'll give them some good rating for. They really need to improve on things like menus, service and behavior.

I am usually quite a proponent of the CCD sandwiches, and the coffee is ok; so that's what I go there expecting. A decent cup of coffee and something nice to eat.¬†

Unfortunately a few days ago, we strayed from our usual orders and asked for a couple of iced teas and a red velvet cupcake.¬†

I've experienced crappy cupcakes (which are muffins really, in disguise) before, but this was out of this world crap! Hard, and dry, and completely tasteless. It was bright pink and tasted like something that was vaguely bubblegum/chewing gum (that pink big babool kind) flavoured. Covered with a sweet layer of something that definitely was NOT icing/frosting. Ok, I thought to myself, these guys don't know what cupcakes are. Fine.¬†

The CCD iced teas also suck by the way. They're way too lemony and taste like a concentrated shot of lime cordial with some flavouring. But that was no surprise.¬†

By this time a friend had walked in and she asked for another cupcake. Soon after this the first one arrived, and after that trauma, we asked the waiter (quickly, barely a few minutes had passed) to please cancel our second order. He responds by saying that he is sorry and that , "Its been put in the computer." So I'm supposed to understand that a billing machine doesn't have a delete/ cancel option? He did offer to parcel it for us, although what I would do with a parcel of inedible cupcake, I don't know.¬†

Terrible service, terrible food and drinks, and a very annoying experience.¬†

For people with a sweet tooth, just walk across to Au Bon Pain and spend the extra amount (trust me it is WORTH every rupee) | or just stick to your regular coffee and sandwiches (ps - make sure you're certain of what you're ordering, cos once it's 'in the computer' ... it cannot be changed!)

Additionally :: They didn't have classic lemonade. Unusual for someone not to have lemonade in stock. What could't they find I wonder, lemons? or sugar? (ugh)

Been here quite a few times with my friends. While I like the seating arrangement and the privacy on the 1st floor, I had an unfortunate incident here once.

It's high time CCD does something about their boring tasteless food options and the shame of a coffee they serve! Visuals and branding does not catalyze if there is no taste or innovation or variety! Buck up guys! Local cafes are doing far better!

An OK place just like other CCDs these days. Same old menu. The coffee taste has deteriorated since I came here last time. Staff behavior is also not that friendly anymore. Just the seating arrangement and privacy is what I'll give them some good rating for. They really need to improve on things like menus, service and behavior.

I am usually quite a proponent of the CCD sandwiches, and the coffee is ok; so that's what I go there expecting. A decent cup of coffee and something nice to eat.¬†

Unfortunately a few days ago, we strayed from our usual orders and asked for a couple of iced teas and a red velvet cupcake.¬†

I've experienced crappy cupcakes (which are muffins really, in disguise) before, but this was out of this world crap! Hard, and dry, and completely tasteless. It was bright pink and tasted like something that was vaguely bubblegum/chewing gum (that pink big babool kind) flavoured. Covered with a sweet layer of something that definitely was NOT icing/frosting. Ok, I thought to myself, these guys don't know what cupcakes are. Fine.¬†

The CCD iced teas also suck by the way. They're way too lemony and taste like a concentrated shot of lime cordial with some flavouring. But that was no surprise.¬†

By this time a friend had walked in and she asked for another cupcake. Soon after this the first one arrived, and after that trauma, we asked the waiter (quickly, barely a few minutes had passed) to please cancel our second order. He responds by saying that he is sorry and that , "Its been put in the computer." So I'm supposed to understand that a billing machine doesn't have a delete/ cancel option? He did offer to parcel it for us, although what I would do with a parcel of inedible cupcake, I don't know.¬†

Terrible service, terrible food and drinks, and a very annoying experience.¬†

For people with a sweet tooth, just walk across to Au Bon Pain and spend the extra amount (trust me it is WORTH every rupee) | or just stick to your regular coffee and sandwiches (ps - make sure you're certain of what you're ordering, cos once it's 'in the computer' ... it cannot be changed!)

Additionally :: They didn't have classic lemonade. Unusual for someone not to have lemonade in stock. What could't they find I wonder, lemons? or sugar? (ugh)

Highly disappointed due to their lumbering service and let me just remind you that we are talking about a CCD at a place like Park Street. And the bar of expectations is always high at such places. What good is a sizzler if served all cold? The only saviour is the ambience. My advice would be to avoid this particular outlet.

This branch of CCD has captured a tiny place in my heart, for it has been the venue for a huge number of informal meetings, random discussions and personal chit-chats as well.
I particularly remember being caught in a sudden, heavy downpour with my camera and lenses when CCD came to the rescue.

Located just opposite Flurys, this two-storeyed outlet is undoubtedly my favorite among all the other branches of CCD I have been to.

The staff is extremely courteous and always smiling. The menu does make your wallet a bit tensed, but the quality of the food goes unparalleled. Sandwiches are good and enough to satisfy the hungry soul. The blue Tropical Iceberg is there to chill on a hot day (do sip slowly unless you want your straw to be stranded in a glass full of ice!) . Though my personal favourite is the combo of cappuccino and the 'sensuous' Hazel Karat Pastry, I drool over the Belgian Choco Shot as well.

Good food. Good place. Good people.
Cheers!

Cafe coffee day is one of the restaurants where you will get taste one of the most premium varied coffee flavors. The sundaes are tasty. Snacks are crunchy and well cooked. About the restaurant the ambiance is very good. The well lit room is well spaced, and very well maintained. The counter is very responsive and well responsible. The place is well decorated and scented. Hazelnut karat, is just the best of cakes i have ever tasted. the coffee are well sweetened and and very high on calorie. Diabetes patient please avoid. The staff  members are not so good. The place needs a little cheering up. otherwise if you need a small snack break, or a light date , it is highly recommended. It lacks the Calcutta flavor, so anybody looking for Calcutta flavor in snacks must avoid.

Well, the good thing about this particular outlet of CCD is that the place is quite large( 2 storeyed t o be precise) and is extremely spacious. However, it's location among many other coffee shops, food outlets does enthuse its competition. But the reasonable rates of any CCD probably gives it an upper hand. The order for your food is also taken at your table without you having to visit the cashier's counter. The employees/waiters here ,nevertheless, add to its cons. They are not aware of the various vouchers and coupons offered by websites like snapdeal, flipkart,etc. I, myself, had an embarrassing encounter here for this very reason.

OMG...wat a dish. it is a hot soft chocolate cake over which hot molten chocolate is flowing like lava and over it a sweet nice round white vanilla scoop of icecream. Eating this was an experience. I just llloved it and shall visit ccd over and over and over again for this deadly sinful bliss. I am literally *intoxicated* with this dish.

Anything can happen over a coffee. We should say any price you could be paying in your bill if your not smarter. Their staff are trained well and they keep you getting things added in your coffee or cakes without mentioning that its chargeable.

The park street caf√© is my favourite of the numerous CCD stores we have strewn all over Calcutta. The layout is different, the first floor affords much required quiet and privacy. The ground floor is hip and the vibe of being in some place trendy juxtaposed with just watching the world pass by is something to relish while here.

The coffee is made efficiently and the cream whipped coffees are as usual par excellence. The devil‚Äôs own is a personal favorite especially with all that chocolate sauce. The cappuccinos are not that bad either, if a bit too strong for my taste. However you can customize and add or alter cream, sugar, sauces are per your requirements which gets the thumbs up from me. 
The new combos which CCD has introduced are a very smart tactical move to capture the pressed for cash youth, and certainly does a good job of pairing great coffees with decent food bits like sandwiches etc. The chicken tikka sandwich is a good bet to ask for in the combos. 

Overall a good place to hang out with your besties or a group of friends. Not too bad for a casual date either.

Situating an outlet next to Barista was a bold move on CCD's part. But the layout of this cafe really is a pleasant change from the usual ones. I love the quietness and privacy of the first floor. The seating arrangements are nice too. The food is usual CCD fare - on my last visit here I ordered a cappuccino and a brownie, both of which were served promptly and were well-heated, as they should be. The upper floor is great for study groups with friends - and nothing helps me battle an endless syllabus like a hot cuppa! 
Will be coming back for more. :)

Visited this outlet many times and i love visiting here for chilling with friends. The ground floor remains packed up while the first floor is calmer and quieter. Have nice cushions to relax and few magazines to gain knowledge. The service is good with the staff being friendly.. They come to you and take your orders and even serve you unlike other CCDs.. Ambiance is typical CCDic with the typical coffee bean flavored smell all around.:)  They serve fresh foods as usual but unavailability seems to be an issue sometimes due to large number of customers...

Okay this chain of Amalgamated Bean is pretty sprawled all across the city catering to a million office goers and college friends to chill.
This particular outlet is preferable because if its location. It also has a first floor which is again a positive.
Now, if you sit on the ground floor, you can see the rush of park street right from the big glass door which is an amazing view.
My favourite items in CCD are :

Cappuccino, Latte, Irish Coffee, Chocolate Donut (Yes, with the cream on top), Belgian choco shots, Smoked Chicken sandwich.

But today, I though if trying something different so I ordered a veg 109 combo which consisted of a tex mex veg cheese sandwich and cappuccino.
The sandwich was awesome :D

Yes, I am a sucker for meat for this sandwich is really great. I would suggest you guys try it out. Its corn cheese, corn and capsicum finely mixed which definitely goes very well with the bread.

Cappuccino was good as usual :)
Goes without saying.

Coming back for more.

Cheers! : )

Arguably one of the best outlets of the chain of cafe outlets in the city, you can rest assured that this is the place to be for good coffee, and in case, you wanna spot some foreigners come to town. With a view of the famous Park Street in front, one can simply catch up on some leftover reading, or chill with a friend. I'd ordered the Sizzle Dazzle Brownie, which consisted of a warm brownie with hot chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream as toppings. It was quite delicious, needless to say, and we could doodle over the food for quite a long time without any wary glances from the waiters.However, they said they were out of the Belgian Choco Shots, which we were quite lloking forward too, so that was a dampener. Overall, here are the ratings:
Taste: 4.0
Quality :3.5
Ambience: 4.5
Value for Money : 3.0

A very happening place to be at. Also the free wifi is an add-on! 
Me and my girlfriend had Cappucino and Chocolate Frappe ,and a smoked chicken Sandwich. We laughed at the cream moustaches we both  had after tasting our refreshments. We clicked pictures and took home some awesome date memories. :)
The service was good and the whole atmosphere of young people huddled in the top floor was nice.
The 1st floor, I think is meant for very large groups and the business crowd. 
I would definitely visit the place again.

A regular hang out for me.. When ever I visit Kolkata, I spent a lot of time there for obvious reasons. Ambiance is good, food is fine and service is up to the mark as well.

went there on 2012 Christmas...  Disgusting service quality... have to wait for so long after ordering... they won't even say that they don't have this item ...they will just serve the other substitutes without even asking

The only thing that goes right for this place is its location - right in the center of Park Street. Otherwise,  the service and the decor is nothing exceptional. It is a very contested outlet and especially when its crowded, it becomes a little too uncomfortable.
