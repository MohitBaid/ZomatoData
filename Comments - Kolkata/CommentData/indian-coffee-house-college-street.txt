Have been there many times. They are very familiar to their customers and very loyal foods they use to serve. Very old and classic. Love their tea especially and their fish kabiraaji. It's more a place to have a great adda with your friends and have a good time over there...😃

Being it's a Heritage place of kolkata many people come and spend their time with friends and family. I visited this place many a time and yesterday also I visited this place with my school friends and had a gala time over there,  though it is coffee house but none of the coffees taste good and I found each of the coffee as water with a pinch of coffee powder and may be a few drop milk to bring the color and with lots of sugar which makes it a syrup apart from that we ordered chicken sandwich which I found very simple yet tasty, and fish kabiraji and which is being served with salad but it is too oily and can find oils over plates and overall its a nice place to hangout but no food is good as per both quality and quantity!!

" Coffee house er shei Adda ta ar nei"-  because they just don't serve good food. They've got staff who are egoistic, they don't even bother to behave nicely and have an attitude like they're doing a BIG favour by serving us! All of these would still have been digested if they sold the food at cheap rates. Their items are priced quite moderately. Indian Coffee House is just a heritage now! I am absolutely astonished at the behavior of the staff! They feel like they can say anything or behave in any manner they wish to!! My point is that if they don't like walking up the stairs then why don't they install a rope and climb it. 

It's a shame that this place has turned out to be a center to click pictures for bloggers and also a place to provide shelter to college students.

A must visit for the ones who would love to soak in its old world charm.This institution is way much more than its food.So if you are planning for an adda with your friends ,this is the right place.You can consider yourself lucky enough ,if you can get a seat without  much waiting.Would like to suggest the Chicken Afghani here , among the other dishes i didn't quite like the Noodles here.

It is one of the heritage of our kolkata...I feel nostalgic whenever i visit this place...It is commonly called, has been a favourite hangout for young college-goers and gossip-lovers in Kolkata for a very long time....

The place is always moderately packed...

Last time we took INFUSION,CHICKEN CUTLET,MUTTON CUTLET...The food was not good...I didn't like it...

Now coming to the service..And it was quite fast on that part...The ambienece is not good...

Why people will visit this place???Just for nostalgia?Not really...So they should improve all the things...

The restaurant has absolutely gone down the drains.Be with food wise or service wise.Extremely awful behavior from the staff.The word "vintage" is no more associated with this so called "Coffee House."
The waiter's are arrogant for no reason altogether with repeated misbehavior towards girls. Absolutely disappointing and embarrassing from such a vintage "adda'r jaigaa."
Shameful to see that it's in such a bad condition.We literally got into a spat and all they did say was "yaha aisah hi hota hai."
Indian Coffee House er shei byapar tah aar nei .Learn to respect people,then probably we can "think" of going back there,although I know it hardly matters because "vintage" but chodeh keh? Bolte hoto tai bollam.

You don't go to this place for the food or the look. You go here because this is THE Coffee House where "adda ta aaj aar nei." Although I really like the light and healthy Chicken Sandwich along with the minimalized Cold Coffee, the otherwise taste and health quotient is not so good anymore. The whole place has a Retro Renaissance look and whether your stomach is satisfied or not, you'll surely have an epiphany about the great minds that had sat on the very same table once.

Have been there multiple times to feel the old world charm. The place remains packed on all days. The coffee and the kabiraji are the only two items I find tasty to be honest. I have tried their sandwiches and stuff, but did not like them at all. If you are tight on a budget and need a place to chill with your friends, don't look at any other direction.

Nothing to complain about this historic establishment. 

I stare at the ginormous inner structure in utter awe, wondering how many generations has it served incessantly. 

As the name suggests, coffee and snacks makes it famous.

Pakoras, sandwishes with a few cups of warm infusion with friends will forever be etched in your mind.

P.S. patrons smoke in this place and there is no restrictions or regulations of such activities. So if you have an aversion for second hand smoke, it maybe difficult to avoid such situations. 

But definitely worth a visit in your lifetime.

This place needs no introduction to any true Calcutta boy. I have nostalgic memories of my father taking me to this place for it's vintage old school ambience which blends with the feel of my favourite College Street.Had their Hot Coffee, Singhara and Veg Sandwich which was pretty average in taste.This place is more about the reminder of the Old Calcutta then the taste of its food but will always hold a special place in the heart of a true Calcuttan.

Famous by the evergreen song by Manna Dey, this cafe is synonymous to nostalgic adda and flavour of culture of Kolkata!
From our student days, we used to go there whenever we went to college street! 
Though the place haven't changed much by appearance but the food quality has went down pretty drastically for the past couple of years! 😢
The black coffee which is known as 'Infusion' are renamed by us as 'Confusion' demonstrates the current situation of this century old cafe!😢

Supposed to be "legendary", this place has fallen quite since its so called "legendary" status. Been here a few times especially when hovering the lanes of college street. Although I must admit, this place is a heaven for adda-baj people (like me) but in the light of recent events, I am quite irritated with this place. 

Though the ambiance is still vibrant and 'warm' (literally), what caught my attention is the immense drop in the quality of food and the despicable behavior of the staffs. Yeah, I get it what can you expect to get in ₹20 coffee, right? But even a ₹2 instant Nescafe tastes better than this! Not to mention the immense amount of sugar added to it. It tastes more like 'rasgulla syrup' than a coffee. 

Now coming to the service. It's pretty fast (no judgement) on that part. But the behavior of most of the staffs is utterly rude. Yesterday, I faced a similar situation with one of the staffs. He was rude with us for no reason whatsoever. We're shocked by his behavior. 

Just providing people with a space to chat (and smoke) doesn't make a place worthy! I know my review won't matter to them (they probably dont even know what zomato is)! But I needed to clear my conscience.

After our last 5th sem exam went to an institute for some training related stuffs, and on our way back, we entered to have our lunch. 

Ambience is a bit noisy and not like any normal cafe or restaurant. You will see people smoking. 

Service is okay. 

Food
Chicken Chowmein(8/10): It was good, very close to homemade tastes. Decent amount of add-ons. Quantity is sufficient for 2. Not very rich, accurately spicy. 

Chilli Chicken(6/10): This wasn't a good buy. Very bland. Decently sized pieces and some veggies were uncooked. The gravy lacked taste. Expected better for that price, can serve 3.

If u wish to visit the place, for the name of it, please do. Do try the fish kobiraji, fish fry and the coffee. 
One time visit, but please do keep your expectations low not to be disappointed.

This place is iconic. It has found a mention in song, stories etc.. A regular haunt of my student life was revisited. The place is divided into 2 floors.. The upper one selected by us this time.. Even at 12:30 the place was teeming with people.. We had cold and hot coffee... Very ordinary stuff. But nostalgia beckons with low prices.

No air conditioners, no lavish interiors and no ornamented delicious looking coffee glasses. Welcome to one of the oldest and classic coffee place in the city of joy. This place is nothing like the modern coffee joints, it is just a modest place, which has been able to survive from the pre-independent period till date. Since its establishment, this place has been a meeting place for the intellectuals and learned from the world of art and culture. The coffee house is famed for its adda sessions and intellectual debates, and as the breeding place of several political and cultural personalities and movements. Many people come here just for the sake of adda and to be a part of the long talking sessions. With a remarkably huge space, one can sit in the coffee house for as long as one wants and no one would ask you to leave or even place an order. Open from 9 in the morning to 9 in the evening on all weekdays (Mon-Sat) and for a few hours on Sunday (9 am – 12:30 pm), this place serves affordable Chinese and fast food to accompany coffee. It is undeniably the most affordable coffee shop in town. It is one place that is always jam-packed and attracts all age groups equally. In Indian Coffee House, you can find the waiters and servers in a typical white dress with a unique style of hat, offering menu and serving food. The ones sitting on the upper floor can have an easy view of the space on the floor below. Smoking is also allowed inside the premises.

As much as Coffee House belongs to intense conversations, it also serves as a must visit dating site for the local lovebirds. As long as there will be the culture of Bong Adda, coffee cup, cigarette and friends, the Indian Coffee House will be awaiting you with its glory and nostalgia in the narrow lanes of College Street.

So we finally got a chance to visit this legendary place called the Indian coffee house where legends have come out with great ideas. The interiors and the ambience of the place still remains unchanged which is a great thing to bask in..coming to the food it has deteriorated..even the famous coffee of the coffee house is less than an ordinary coffee..yet this place is a great place to pass hours at affordable rates. Veterans and college/university students were all seen jam packed in the hall passing time..

Yesterday, I went against all my judgements and strolled through this idyllic rut which I thought I'd never enter again. The heritage status of this place can be compared to the magic lamp but sadly the genie has left and all the rubbing of the status throughout decades has corroded the lamp itself.

The smoke addled hall and the narrow balcony atop it with signs of smoking being prohibited, which can barely be seen through the mocking grey clouds, host the perfect microcosm of the middle class society...some college students chatting their weariness off with a stereotypical singer in the mix strumming his guitar, some white-haired heads basking in the memories of a bygone era, a couple tables with new customers who have grown up with the tales and want to understand the nostalgia which Manna Dey immortalized, a group of friends long lost and meeting after ages...and so on. And there were we, trying to while away our time in utmost financial restrictions.

We ordered a Hot Coffee, a Cold Coffee with Cream, a Fish Fry and a Chicken Hakka Chowmein. The food came to grace us in its own time, irrespective of when it was ordered, on the oblivious hands of a white-turbanned staff...well, not at the same time. Chowmein sat on the table for 20mins before the coffees made it there and the fish fry came a long 40mins after the order. By now we were choked by the smoke, well we signed up for it though...the gravely throat wasn't at all soothed by the coffee. The chowmein was like the ones found in roadside stalls for 30Rs a plate and one can dig through the fry to find the fish in there.

Indian Coffee House...oh Coffee House, I wonder if the song was never sung. Maybe the adda should really have faded into the sands of time and our next generation would stroll by the place, never looking up to see the worn out bricks or the probable twigs pushing through them!

P.S - I didn't have the mood to take pics amidst a quarrel two table away, a breakup on the corner of the balcony(no, I wasn't eavesdropping... No one had to) and loud laughter of a group throughout my 2hr stay.

Your college life in Calcutta is incomplete unless you have sat down at the grand Indian Coffee House and had a chat or "adda" session with a cup of coffee and kabiraji or cutlet or perhaps a mutton sandwich. Definitely not the best food is served over here but the atmosphere makes it a must visit for Calcuttans and tourists. A centre of intellectual importance and definitely a budget food joint for students this is a gem of the city.

Food quality has fallen badly!!! Service is not too good even. But the ambience is all that keeps the place wanted and loved. An awsome place for youngsters and elderly people to enjoy with one and many others. The atmosphere is best to sit under a roof yet play cards and smoke ;)

It is less about the food more about the ambience😘, friends and making memories. The legendary place of kolkata this place has it's own vibes. But the sad part is if u looking for food never go there 😢 all the items are average and bellow this quality...
***3.5 ratings only for the ambience..

Visited this historic coffee house for the first time . This place serves cutlets and sandwiches at affordable prices. All coffee shops are expected to serve coffee which would taste absolutely perfect. But i was really disappointed and disillusioned after sipping from the cup of cold coffee with cream. It tasted utterly bitter and watery. Chicken cutlet is worth the taste insofar as the price of the cutlet is concerned. All the more, this place allows you to smoke up and gossip with your friends for hours. Now coming to the staffs,they are absolutely reluctant in their service and will make you sit for half an hour or even more . So if you wanna gorge on some snacks you may drop in but never go for cold coffee.

A popularly crowded Indian coffee house is a must visit if you are in college Street.This place has an ancient feel to it with portrait of Rabindranath Tagore hanging on the walls.Although it's a very historic place,you should not miss a chance to visit this place.This place offers food at a reasonable price.
We ordered egg sandwich,chicken pakora and cold coffee.
The price is very cheap.A nice place to have snacks and hangout with friends.Mostly the place is crowded with students.Service was slow because of the crowd.A must visit.

Cognitive disposition!

If you are walking down in College street seeking for the books you desire, then you might not only sense it as a center for intellectual activity especially, the Indian Coffee House, a café that has attracted the city's intelligentsia for decades, but also it's culture that is cultivating its colonisation for books from more than a century I assume. Therefore, after purchasing what I was looking for, I went straight to its signature place, Indian Coffee House, accompanied by my maternal aunt. 
However, this place might be famous for its inherited history and intellectual discussions but food quality is still the same. Not a single bite has been meliorated. We decreed for Mutton cutlet and Mutton Kaviraji. And both were unsavory. Their coating were so thick that hardly we could taste the meat. And whatever we got the taste of it, it flavored like leather. Thus, again discontent was satisfied.

Keep low expectations for tge taste of food so you won't be disappointed. Food wasn't good but the ambience is that of a native Calcutta hub, which is an attraction.

You donot need to read a review to pay a visit to this place. There is nothing great about the food or the service they provide. But its all about the ambience. Step in and and take a while to look around. You will notice people of every age group. From college going students to old grandpaas all busy in their respective groups. Thats kolkata for you. This is a must visit because it is one of kolkata's heritage places to hang out in.

They need to improve food quality to keep the heritage alive

Ambience as you know if you can bear the smoke of cigarette and loud adda voices then it’s fine for you :)

'Coffee House', as it is commonly called, has been a favourite hangout for young college-goers and gossip-lovers in Kolkata for a very long time. Anjan Dutta has honoured this place through his song too, as we all know! But is it worth all the attention it gets?
I have been here on multiple occasions too... In my opinion its a very polluted place, with multiple chain smokers at every table, creating a canopy of tobacco!
Food is quite average to taste, and sometimes it may disspoint you too. Waiters don't bother much about their customers, in the process they end up serving wrong items, and instead of apologising, they actually persuade you to have what they have brought from the kitchen. In the end they may shamelessly ask for a tip.. That is what has become of our beloved Coffee House.😥

Rating this based on the historical significance this coffee house has in Bengal.. otherwise there is nothing worth trying.. the coffee is not at all tasty which should be the signature of any cafe.. the ambience has a touch of culture and art of bengal.. its quite crowded be it any timr of the day.. a one time visit for any person.. but dont expect too much regarding the food and beverages.

Came here for snacks on a Saturday ! The look and feel of the place hasn't changed an ounce and remains one place in Calcutta which transports you back in time effortlessly ! The food is not that good, neither too bad! Ordered chicken kabiraji, onion pakora, and veg chowmin , along with two cups of coffee ! The service is not that good and you may have to wait long for placing as well as having your orders served! But then who goes to the coffee house for the food! The ambience more than makes up for it !

Sheer nostalgia compelled me to rate a 5. Amidst all the hustle and bustle of “boi para” there stands this age old Coffee House. This place is replete with old Kolkata charm.  Our history is made of all the irksome noise and smoke. At first, like most of the people, I was also sceptical. Then it started to grow on me. For the most part of my university years this has been the only constant.

Coffee house is not everyone’s cup of tea (or coffee). You don’t go there for food. I can understand the disillusionment for first timers.  If you are already here try some kobiraji and cutlets.

This is the ideal place for people of all ages. You'll see a couple of old people sipping on to cups of tea and talking quitely and again right in the next table you'll see students having chowmein over squeals of laughter and gossips.

Just located at the College Street , this isn't hard to spot  The greatest icons have visited this place. Though now Indian coffee house has lost its vigor and glory yet it still exists amidst the growing popularity of The CCDs and Keventers.

For a true Calcuttan this place is love. I would say that the food they serve is average. The only thing I like here is the mutton Afghani. Coffee is average but the old hall takes your heart away. Sandwiches are good given the price. The kabiraji is good enough. Cold coffee is okayish. Multiple visits made to this place by college goers. An extra 0.5 for the emotional attachment :')

Location : At the centre of college street, beside bankim chatterjee street this Legendary place is situated.

Exterior, Interior & Ambience : From the outside it looks old and horrible to be very honest. It could be reconstructed better atleast from the outside.
The Interior is old as well but it doesn't feels bad once you enter but very crowded.
Ambience of this place is something which is superior in every points I've jotted down here. In a word it is INCREDIBLE! You will feel like you've time-travelled to the 1970's Kolkata. It's beyond elaboration how this place feels. It's not modern, doesn't have much modernization but it feels so classic and traditional. You should visit this place if you haven't already.

Service : I visited this place thrice & frankly the service is average. One of those 3 times I visited the service was very poor. There are so many servicemen and your table will be randomly selected by one of them. Some are very helpful, some are diplomatic but some are so pathetic that if your order doesn't go upto a certain price they will be like this dish isn't available. But other two times I visited it was decent.

Food : Well had Chicken Kabiraji, Cold coffee, regular coffee, tea and Chicken Sandwich. And every thing was decent. The Kabiraji was excellent, coffee was okay, tea was kinda meh and sandwich was good. So overall food was decent. As this place is very traditional among Bengalis & quite traditional so if you like classic places this place is your sweet spot. Even if you don't like classic places I'd say you should atleast visit this place once in your life.

Coffe house is a place which gives you feelings of nostalgia. Having heard nothing but compliments from my parents and their friends I decided to give this place a visit.
This is the best place to visit for addas and chats. People of all ages and even some foreigners can be seen gossiping and having a good time. College students as well as middle aged and old people can be seen here reminiscing old times. 
It's pretty much crowded every time which is not unexpected as this place is famous. The place has two floors. The upper floor is  a balcony filled with tables and chairs. Smoking is not prohibited inside.
Coming to the food I had a chicken sandwhich , cold coffee and chicken cutlets all of which tasted pretty good.
This place is definitely a must visit especially for the young generation as they can get a glimpse of a time long ago.

A PLACE FOR ALL. It’s not only a place to have food or hangout, it’s more than that. People came here to feel that nostalgia, the essence of the song “কফিহাউসের সেই আড্ডা টা.........”
This place has huge pressure all the time. People have to wait for tables everyday. No time limit is there to sit. One can smoke, hangout and have food all together at a same place here.
Typically waiters takes too much time to take your order and for serving too. Food quality is decreasing say by day. But after all these, the constant facts are- price, আড্ডা, nostalgia

Heritage and ambience... nothing else..
..
This is not a place for delicious food..
..
This is a place where you can get a round table with six chairs for all of your friends and can spends six hours just ordering few cups of coffee... provided u r ok with fragments of goldflakes or local bidis coming from side tables

But.. as a restaurant... considering present quality.. it should get below average rating...

Poor slow service.. dealing with those non cooperative reluctant staff.. u just feel lyk u r in a government office....
..
Regarding food quality.. its too ordinary... better satisfy ur tongue and stomach with putiram's kachuri, mouchak's sweet and paramount's dab sarbat and then spend some quality time @ coffee house with your friends over a cup of coffea...

This has been the favourite place for everyone be it the old generation or the newer college going people. Everyone sometime or the other have visited this place at least for once. Just located at the College Street , this isn't hard to spot and is also a part of history. The greatest icons have visited this place, this place has witnessed a lot in India's Independence. Though now Indian coffee house has lost its vigour and glory yet it still exists amidst the growing popularity of The CCDs and Keventers. Since my University is located at College Street so I often visit this place to hang out with friends and you will find people from different spheres over here. There tea or coffee isn't so great but the feeling of sitting at the place where our greatest stalwarts have spent their time is something a kind of an emotion in itself. Coming to the food, you can try the coffee or the cold coffee and along with that the bread toast or chowmein. This is much cheaper than any other cafes in the city. If you haven't yet visited this place then visit it soon. 😊

We ordered Chicken Cutlet and Chicken Kabiraji. The food was not very tasty. Also, the cutlery were greasy. The price is reasonable and the service isn't very prompt, but the staff here is courteous. I wouldn't recommend this place for quality food, but definitely a cool place for chatting with friends over some snacks and a cup of coffee.

This place never fails to amaze me. Whenever I think of college street, the first thing is this place that comes in my mind. This place does not need extra appreciation from me. I have been here quite often. Of all, my favourite is Infusion and baked fish. Everyone should try them. Still I am giving two star less because of a bit slow service.

Service is kinda slow and honestly was not satisfied with the Chicken kaviraji we ordered. The cold coffee was good though. Prices are cheap and staffs are courteous but. It really holds on to its true essence of being an age old popular coffee shop, and you feel it right when you walk in through the door.

Of living in Calcutta for 22 years, this was my first visit to The Indian Coffee House. This place stands strong and firm for about eighty years. The Indian Coffee House try to hold the old world charm. This is the ideal place for people of all ages. You'll see a couple of old people sipping on to cups of tea and talking quitely and again right in the next table you'll see students having chowmein over squeals of laughter and gossips.
The place has two floors. The upper floor is basically a balcony lined with tables and chairs. It remains pretty crowded almost all the time. It has a certain homely feel in it.
As for the food, we tried Kabiraji Cutlet and Cold Coffee with cream. We were a bit disappointed with the cutlet though. It was not how we expected it to be. The price is extremely reasonable. The service is slow here. But the staff is courteous and polite.

Coffee house had been my regular hangout destination during college days. It's ambiance reminds me of old Calcutta days and you'll hear everything here! However, foods are not upto the mark specially the Chinese dishes. My recommendations would be their cutlets.

Visited this place twice, once in 2013 and second time took place a few days back. Went their just to chill and gossip and ended up drinking two cups of infusion, one cup coffee and Fish kaviraji. The place feels absolutely perfect to chill out (except for a bit humid and heat issues). Food was good and service was prompt. Will surely visit again for more #addas.

Coming to the food.. i won't say it's great but according to the price, its good..
We ordered mughlai parantha and chicken sandwich.. parantha was delicious but chicken sandwich was not upto the mark..
It remains crowded always and so food takes time to be delivered..

The chicken cutlet was absolutely tasteless,rather I should say it was bitter in taste and the egg sandwich was just too ordinary..It has nothing special..The behaviour of staffs was rude...I wont go there again !!

Over-hyped place. People basically visit this place for heritage and all. The food and cold coffee (too much sugar was added to it) they prepare is so disappointing. Nice place to gossip with your group.
They must look into their food section.
Service is mediocre. Staffs are rude. Spacious. Ambiance is too noisy as the place remains crowded. Pocket friendly

Apart the historical importance this place holds, there isn't anything more. The food, especially, disappoints tremendously. The service is slow but manages the crowd well. The cold coffee with cream had no cream and was too sweet. The mutton kabiraji and cutlet also disappointed greatly. Great place to have a conversation, not much for appetite.

Definitely not those restaurants where you are welcomed by the staffs, definitely not the one where you will have a comfortable seating arrangements, definitely not the one where you will get very very tasty food but still the most loved places here in Kolkata!! While the whole world is in the rat race of developments and moving forward THE INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE will definitely make you nostalgic,the paintings on the wall,the fans etc will take you back to the 90s where intellects used to come and have their addas. Being in Kolkata,visit this place with your friends- not for the food but for its heritage :')

The place reeks of tobacco, the food served borders on the average... U won't be greeted and treated like dukes and ducheses the way it happens in the high-end restaurants of Kolkata... But sumthing makes u fall in love with coffee house... This sumthing I believe is what pulls Kolkatans time and again to this cafe. The looming history of Albert hall, the paintings that have adorned the walls for ages now, the VOICE OF KOLKATA board where u find beautiful messages written all make u believe in the "Kolkatar adda" culture that originated in this very place... U sit there and ur mind automatically starts reeling back to the time when Sunil Ganguly wrote his materpieces while puffing out smoke from his Charminar probably sitting in the very chair that u r sitting in right now... Or maybe u feel ur favourite Samaresh Majumder characters speak of the ambitious ideals of communism as they sip on the same flavour of coffee that u r sipping right now... Well... This is what I felt today as I munched on sum fish fingers, chicken kabiraji and fish fry after a tiring day at college... The meal ended with the compulsory cup of cold coffee... Truth be told, the food lacked perfection in flavour and the coffee lacked an adequate quantity of milk in it... But I guess, me being an inveterate lover of my city love everything about this place... Its humid atmosphere, its chatter and clatter of noise, and most importantly, its addas... Here's to everyone who loves coffee house with all its imperfections... Here's to the "coffee house er shei adda"😇

This place is no less than a heritage of Kolkata. A perfect place to hangout and spend some quality time with friends over a cup of tea or coffee. The ambience of this place gives u the typical bengaliyana feeling. The food out here is really good and tasty and fits in your budget too. But they really need to work on the hygiene factor as you would find cats roaming around. And service also needs to be worked on. Other than that this place should be on your checklist of must visit.

Just okay! I used to tell myself, "If you're a Bengali and you've never been to The Coffee house, what have you achieved in life?" After being there a few times, I can vouch for the inadequacies of my emotion. It's just not what it used to be. At least that's what I'd like to believe. Coffee houser sei adda aj ar nei just like the good food they used to have. The cold coffee was somewhat good but Cutlet, Noodles were really nothing to rave about. They all taste mediocre. Won't visit again. "Much ado about nothing." - Shakespeare.

The great Manna Dey had sung a song dedicated to this cafe. This is the oldest cafe in Kolkata and a hub of intellectual people in the city. Artists, poets, writers, thinkers, political leaders all flock here and brew grey matters over cups of coffee and mouth watering delicacies.

Located in the heart of College Street, Coffee House is flocked in numbers by students of Calcutta University, Presidency University, Scottish Church College, Medical College and other educational institutions in the area.

You get cold coffee in glass bottles with straw. You get hot coffee and tea as well. The entire cafe was a smoking zone, now there has been bit of restriction.

Food lovers can delve into Mutton Afghani, Chicken Stew, sinful Sandwiches and others.

The waiters still adorn the age old white traditional uniform with head turbans.

If you are in Kolkata and are hunting for the spirit of the city, just be in Coffee House and experience it once.

Every Visit to the Indian Coffee House always turns out to be a good visit. Though this place is gradually loosing its charm but due to the heritage it holds there would always remain a stroke of nostalgia everytime a Calcuttan visits this place.
I have been here multiple no. Of times and I have Seriously lost count of it .. 😂
I remember people telling me how the quality of the coffee has gradually decreased over time and that nothing is same as it was in its initial years.
I know everything is adaptable to change and so is this place. The coffee here might have decreased in quality but trust me there are few things which is worth the taste.
First there is my personal favourite Chicken/Mutton/Fish Afghani. These three dishes are prepared in the same way but they greatly vary in taste. My Second favourite item there is Chicken Fried Rice and Chili Chicken. It tastes great. Thirdly Chicken/Mutton cutlet is also my favourite. Then Chicken Chowmien ,Moghlai and Chicken and Egg sandwiches are some of the items which I like here.
There are few items there that I personally dislike such as Cold Coffee,Mixed Chowmien,Onion Pakoras. The Cold Coffee can only provide an exception in such situations where you're in dire need of something cold and sweet then it is surely going satisfy you.
Now coming to the decor the place is large with upper and lower floor seating accomodation.
It is located just opposite to the Presidency University. This place is perfect for both quick bites and lunch. The rusty look of this place bears witness to all the nostalgia associated with this place. A cat also lives there who is very cute and you can even pet her. ❤
Now coming to the service it lags very much. You will get to know once you visit this place. You have to pretty much wait for everything. Whether its water,menu card or food. But if you start going to this place pretty often you will get very much acquainted with every bit of Coffee House. This place is great and is Seriously one of a kind.
I would very much recommend everyone to check out this place atleast once. ❤
Cheers 🙌👌❤

It is one of those iconic places of Kolkata which you don't tend to miss...it right in the heart of college street and is always choc-a-bloc not only with students from CU but also by some regulars who are visiting this outlet since a long time...
The coffee house is divided into two levels...and it has been witness to some political nerve centre...one can still find handbill stuck on the staircase...
It is also a common meeting point...and this place became famous after the famous singer Manna Dey made a song based on this coffee house...I guess all bengali knows the song...many celebrities have been to this place...
Try out the sandwiches or baked fish...and if u r not that much calorie conscious then go for Mughlai Parantha, Chicken/Mutton Kaviraji, Afghani and ofcourse cutlets...just to feed everyone's hunger they even have Chinese food...and all at throwaway price...very competitive pricing...
Since it's an old heritage place so don't expect ac...
My personal favorite is Mutton Afghani...

The Indian Coffee house in college Street has aged like fine 🍷 wine and still manages to be in the hearts of the people of Kolkata. Let's not forget how "coffee house er shei ADDA ta" by Manna Dey was one of the main reasons of it's becoming such a famous place.
Coming to the ambience, very crowded. But also, I guess it has the highest seating capacity in all of college Street or North Kolkata for that matter. Although there are several "no smoking" boards inside, you're however allowed to smoke and yes you'll see a lot of people smoking there.
It's probably the heart of hippie culture in Kolkata.
Waiters, are all well dressed. No matter how intense the crowd becomes you'll never get wrong food on your table!
Also, sadly the washrooms don't have water supply and this is the last thing you'd expect from a place like this.
Coming to the food - I tried the fish cutlet which was amazing. And the fish kobiraji too.
The Coffees, however are really disappointing as they don't even use milk and instead replace it with milk powder which causes detoriation of the taste.
And the cutlery, I doubt how it's cleaned or if it's clean at all.
Ice coffee comes for RS 40 without cream, fish cutlet comes for about RS 70. Around 200/- would suffice two people's hunger.

Well this place is more about 'adda', hearty smokes, heated discussions, nostalgia.
I won't suggest this place for food or coffee either. But if you want to soak your soul in the deep, shabby, unmatched typical 90s Bengali intellect, you will find no better place that I guarantee!

One word ... Nostalgic. You get those typical north Kolkata vibes. One of the favourite places in Kolkata. Amazing food and even services. You'll be mesmerized by the "purono Kolkata" feel. Not easy to locate for the first timers but people out there will help you. Located just few meters ahead of presidency university an extremely blissful place for adda with your gang. We ordered chicken pakora, chicken afghani, chicken kobiraji, cold coffee with cream and a hot coffee. Amazing food, amazing service, amazing place. Always a 5 for me.

Well I think this one doesn't need any introduction, it's an iconic name. This place in kolkata has a legendary status. We don't go there to have great food. This place itself will make you feel nostalgic. Food is average. Cold coffee tastes like some sweet cold water. And waiters were pretty rude too.

This is the place I always wanted to visit after listening to the song "Coffee house er shei adda ta aaj ar nei". But once or twice is enough and I never ever want to go back to this place again. 
First of all the ambiance. It looks good and nostalgic but almost all people smoke even if there are no smoking boards hanging around and you cannot say anything to anyone. I've seen people shouting and using abusive words and no one tellst hem anything. It was like an alley in a locality where you smoke while insulting your friends with foul languages.
Then comes the service, it's the worst. The waiters are so lazy and take so much time to bring anything you order. They behave as if we owe them something. They get angry if one asks for an extra straw or an extra spoon and then if you don't tip them for their rude behavior, they get furious.
Finally, the food and drinks were OK, no good and you'll easily get this quality in any other local shops.

People visit this place primarily for the feel and ambience that has been created by the history surrounding the place. The place is frequented by college students from the vicinity, office goers and other middle aged and elderly people.
The sandwiches and coffee here are basic, the Veg Hakka Chowmein was good.
The place is good if you want to relax in the apparently intellectual environment (provided you get a seat) and don't want much of a pocket pinch.

This is a every old coffee house of Kolkata from the colonial times. When you will step in to this coffee house thst takes you back to colonial time. The food is average, the chicken and mutton kabiraji are good and mutton Keema sandwiches are good and coffee is really nice. This is one of the iconic place of Kolkata.

Went there after office with my friend. It was just full packed up, me and my friend was waiting for about 10 mins to literally grab two seats and finally we got that.

As I entered there was remembering that song of Manna Dey.. "Coffee House এর সেই আড্ডাটা আজ আর নেই".... Buuuuut.... The "আড্ডা" was in full force!! It was too crowded, intact me and my friend were literally shouting while talking to each other, otherwise our voice was not audible enough there.

Now coming to the food, though it was my first time in "Coffee"  house, we both had tea, and Chicken Afghani and Fish Fry.

Chicken Afghani was a bit spicy, but it was literally yummmmmy! Fish Fry was so so.

But still I have to taste other dishes there...

It's less about the food and more about the ambience , friends , cigarettes 😇 , nostalgia , making memories.  Heritage place of Kolkata . Must visit if you're in college Street . Have cutlets , coffee and seat beside the window to enjoy the afternoon with your old friends. I had Afghani chicken , very much spicy based on mustard oil , chicken sandwich , and infusion . Food is not very good . But as I said , food is not important here . Always full from day to night , you may not get a seat immediately .

One of the most popular site of Kolkata. Ordered Mixed Hakka Chow and Hot Coffee. I think this is the only restaurant where you will get egg and chicken,mutton pieces (no prawn) in the mixed chowmein. Quantity is very good with respect to price. Ambiance is purely nostalgic but non-smokers may have problem as no one follows the rule. Serving takes time as it stays housefull maximum time.

If you go by the food: it's pretty average. But the place itself will make you nostalgic. It shows you how still in this race of well decorated restaurant, some one is trying to hold the legacy.

Now coming to food and beverage:

1. Hot coffee: not good.
2. Cold coffee: decent.
3. Chicken afgani: nice one.
4. Mutton kabiraji: nice one.
5. Chicken pakora: avarage.

All that cost 500 INR

Now if I only go by the food, I would have rated it 3.5 but yes extra is the legacy, the journey of Kolkata u found in the restaurant. After all Bengali, and yes biasness for Kolkata and it's heritage.

Going from my college life and fond of their cold coffee, fish kabiraji and gravy chowmein ... Just few days earlier visited this place once again and want to take the flavor of this Kolkata famous old coffee shop where essence of food mixed up with the smoke of cigarettes...After renovation the seating area of upper floor is now available and we managed to take a table in all time crowded coffee shop.. But we got disappointed when start to order our food as waiter told us that gravy chowmein and kabiraji were not available..We ordered fish cutlet and hakka  chicken chowmein and cold coffee.. previous taste was also missing from chowmein...We enjoyed the ambiance more than food, after all it's​ a Hangouts place with no time boundaries where u can continue ur gossips after paying ur bills..

Does it need a review?You can see history on the walls,if you can actually see through the thick putrid smoke emanating from the lips of intellectuals who would be either reading or writing in solitude,or college kids who would be a part of the history.Besides the delicious Cutlet that I ate,the coffee is not that intriguing.The chowmein and tomate omelette were fantastic,on the greasy side.The Onion Pakodas were something different from the regular stuff we normally eat.
Soak and drool over the heritage.Kolkata has things to offer.

This is one among those heritages... The evergreen song "Coffee house er shei adda ta aaj r nei" have made this place immortal among the hearts of all bengali people...

But sadly enough coffee house ta bdh hoi shei coffee house r nei... The only thing left of this place is heritage.. With a no smoking placard hanging, unfortunately enough u will suffocate yourself in here if you are a non-smoker like me...

The staffs are sloppy with no interest at all.. service is slow like hell... the food is also nothing to be talked about...

All and all the ratings which i have given is only and only because of the heritage and the special place it has in our hearts... Otherwise this place is not worth anything...

Food - Truely speaking the food is average or can be even rated as below average. The cold coffee tastes like some sweet cold water, infusion is also sweet. Sandwiches and cutlets can be given a try. But after all of this, it's THE INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE!
Visit the pace for it's heritage. History and the location of this place doesn't decrease it's customer number. 

Ambience - An old house giving you the feel of some ancient heritage.

Service - Attendants are really rude. Don't expect some pampering here!

Rates - Cheap.

If I would had reviewed this place 3 years back, I would have rated this 3.5(pretty decent!) but the quality of food has deteriorated drastically! We had ordered chicken and fish cutlet and coffee. The coffee wasn't up to the mark at all! The cutlets were stiff. It felt as if breadcrumbs had been fried sticking around a small piece of chicken just to make it look bigger. 
However, the ambiance remains something to be soaked into. It's unique undoubtedly!  Given the crowd, Service was okay-ish.
Food-1/5

Indian Coffee House has a long history which can be spoken about but there is nothing that can be spoken about their food and beverages.The Cold Coffee was so bad that we could not even finish half of it,it was just water and sugar syrup with a spoon of coffee.The enivronment was very shabby and the service,really difficult to find anything good about this place.The only relief I got was the gents washroom which I needed to visit urgently.
P.S. Biggest irritation was its written it's a no smoking area still people were smoking away to glory.

A place for Bengali intellectuals. Every bit of the old coffee house is seeped in tradition and history. Foods and beverages are OK but the environment and decor is unique. I have never a seen a coffee house empty . Its always brimming with people and the room is always full of energy and a tremendous buzz. Service is prompt and you can gossip with your buddies from morning till night . Rating? Well actually how do you rate heritage?

One of the historical place in kolkata....very old place and a quite big area...
If you going to compare this place to other restaurants then that will be a wrong idea...
The behavior of the staffs are not good at all....
Whatever you will order that is already finished and you have to decide from their available options....

We ordered two cold coffee...chicken pokora....nd fish fry.....
Chicken pokora: quality is poor....hard and less chicken....

Fish fry: average....same taste as any local food stall...

Cold coffee: too much bad. No evidence of milk....just horrible.....

Bill was 235....no taxes.....

So why i gave 3.5 rating?
Just because you can feel a inner connection of old calcutta in that place which you cant find anywhere....
This is one big reason to visit this place....

Let me clear first ..whenever u are going to somewhere special u have  some expectations of yours ..Indian Coffee House ...such a renowned place ...have visited before but haven't yet face that much uneven food ever ...First we ordered Baked Fish ...didn't even think this item only contains gravy ..apart from this what we have ordered in the pics ...clearly picturing a so called "fish Kaviraji" ...without any feeling like kaviraji which was not expected from here .....kindly try to serve when u have right things to make us eat ..thank you!!! ...

Indian Coffee House has a special soft corner in every Bengali's heart. Its history and to the charm of this place. Highly recommended hang out area. Kobiraji fish cutlet is a must try. To be on the safe side do not try the coffee here.

How amazing my visit to coffee house would have been, only if the food was a bit palatable . Though by reading reviews on zomato I had a idea about it but still . . . We ordered a plate of Muglai Paratha [which comes with an aloo-cholar dish] , a plate of onion pakoras , a plate of chicken sandwich and 2 cold coffees . Well, to begin with, the Paratha was "just okay" , nothing extraordinary, there are road side stalls serving better Muglai Parathas than this . And the "aloo-torkari" was simply bland, even an amateur youtube learner can cook better than this one . But the worst dish was the onion pakoras, it was hard, not fried properly, hardly three pieces of onions in one pakora [note : the size of the pakora was pretty big] . The only saviour was the cold coffee, though pretty small but it had right amout of sugar, milk and coffee. I gave 2.5 based on this cold coffee and 0.5 because THE COFFEE HOUSE, is not just a name, it's a legendary outlet in the city of joy . It's just depressing that the food is so bad . And btw, our server forgot about the chicken sandwiches, which was like a cherry on top . So, yea, this sums up my experience. Hope you guys have a great time here, feeling the nostalgic waves buzzing around .

We don't actually need to comment on the ambience of this place if we know kolkata well . To get the deal of kolkata about its literature, politics,college life, adda ... it is absolutely necessary to visit the place . And coffee here is the main attraction ... I loved the chicken sandwich and fish kabiraji was amazing . Even the cold cofee is great ....

This is a must visited place when you're around College Street. If you're looking for an "adda in a coffee house" then this is the right place for you. This place will never disappoint you. They offer delicious foods with reasonable price. Even they don't charge any service taxes. I visited this place many more times. We tried chicken kabiraji, fish finger, cold coffee, tea, chicken cutlet. All the foods are tasty. Please visit this place at least once in your lifetime!

"Coffee House"-the name common to every "adda-priyo bangali" is indeed a great place to hangout.If "adda" is the main object then coffee house is the best place in kolkata but please don't have high expectations from the food section.This rating is exclusive of the quality of food they serve.

This place is only famous for its heritage and nostalgic atmosphere. That's it. Food is ok ok , not up to the mark and especially the behaviour of the staffs are very bad. You have to shout to get some assistance from their side. Although they are around you but will not respond to you until a special person will come and take order from you. So not a very good place.

If you love coffee by heart I will never recommend Indian coffee house. You can make better coffee at your home. This place is not at all worth it. People are here just because its now a part of heritage. Environment here is nowadays is full of smoke (cigarette) which is suffocating. Nice place for a gossip IF YOU FIND A PLACE FOR YOUR GROUP coz its always full. They don't have enough waiters for attending customers and who are there they act like they are millionaires. Waiter comes to you after one decade just to take order. Food comes to you after another decade and if you order coffee at the coffee house then after having one sip you will definitely regret of entering coffee house. And coming to food all come either from their cold storage or is made in the morning. Cold coffee if simply sweetened water with a lil bit of coffew powder. I have visited it once and will never ever make the mistake of visiting again coz waiting for my food for more than an hour or so doesn't suits me or any or my friends.

Stomach is filled and you want a break up with your girl. Visit this place in a hot sultry afternoon. 

I had a cup of hot coffee because they were out of cold coffee at 7pm. I know it's hilarious but I am just sharing my experience. I had a veg sandwich which was decent and a plate of onion pakora which was poison . Avoid this place. If u wish to CHK out the Heritage just have coffee and leave.

This place is an institution in itself. But one wouldn't even wish to take the stained stairs to the restaurant. I was told the Indian coffee house attracts a highly intellectual crowd. It's a sham, Trust me. The stairs are filled with paan spits. People smoke inside the restaurant. I would suggest the India coffee house adminstration to look into this. This place has got a glorious and priceless history. They can turn this to an attraction easily.

 They stop taking orders at 7:30 pm. They have a rude staff. They fail to understand that hadn't this place had a history no body would have cared to drop by this place. So wouldn't rate their sevice above 3.

Taste: 3
Service : 2
Ambience : 2
Value for money: 3

This is a heritage place and needs serious care. The place is dirty and lacks upkeep. The service is slow and the servers can be really rude.
The food is average. The coffee is just bad. The afghani cutlet and kabiraji is okay.

I have been to this place for the first time few days back. The atmosphere is good with people all around hanging out. Everything was at its best. The worst part was instead of the "No Smoking" posters all around, people are found to be smoking endlessly and no one is there to stop them not even the authority. This is creating a bad impression on the foreigners who visit to this place often. I think they need to increase their waiters and service man too because when I visited there with my friends, I was made to wait 1 hour to get a 'Menu Card' and asking them they point at other waiters. "Poor service" I must say.

Indian Coffee House: The name itself is a cult. I went to College Street to purchase some books and dropped in. The ambience is shabby and unclean. The service is a little slow. The best part is that the attendants come to take orders in a regal attire. Coming to the food, we decided to order Chicken Kobiraji, Fish Fry and two cups of hot coffee. The coffee was like a heave of relief on a rainy evening. ❤ The chicken Kobiraji & Fish Fry tasted pretty blatant and dull.

Suggestions:
1.The malarial environment needs to be changed as soon as possible.
2. They also need to improve the quality of their delicacies.

I am going there since college days, it was a normal place for adda. Three Storied building with two storied restaurant including library. Tables with plastic chairs, waiters dressed in maharaja style, high ceilings, cold coffee with silk cut, everything there is nostalgic. But they should work more in providing adequate fans as it is very hot without a fan above. Our constant orders are cold coffee, chicken sandwich, chicken pakora. CCD Coffee lovers surely wont love this coffee if you don't have any nostalgia attached to the restaurant. It is really thin but tastes good and served with a long straw. Chicken sandwich is one of my favourite dish there. Four sandwiches with shredded chicken and butter perfectly blended with salt and pepper. Chicken pakoras are also tasty, it has 5 big pieces of chicken along with salad and two sauce. Their Hakka noodles is also good in taste but much spicy so you should mention to make it less spicy if it is a problem to you. They also serve good moglai paratha and chicken afghani. Services are prompt and okayish. With so many customers coming and leaving they may miss to serve water at first so you can ask them for that. It might be a bit late but they will definately answer. With such huge place and open enviornment you also should wait for good service. One more thing i was checking the reviews of many CLASSY PEOPLE saying that the place is not cleaned and it stinks and complaining about the chairs and fans. Please try to understand that it is not a place for fine dining. It is a heritage in kolkata and attached to many people's emotion. It is not there to serve you with acs and sofas. There are more restaurant which you will like, leave this place for people lile us. And non smokers, you may have problem with the smoking environment for that you may ask a the waiter who will come to take the order and change your table before giving the order. And if you want a smoke free area then i think you should check another retaurant.

One thing that you absolutely cannot miss while in this place is their coffee. It's a absolute delight! The service at times is a bit slow, but that is because this place is almost always houseful.

The oldest coffee house in India. It's not a place for sophisticated coffee lovers. You will enjoy this place if you love adda with your friends or you are a college going guy or if you want to spend some "me" time with yourself with a cup of coffee and some really pocket friendly food. Avoid this place if you hate smoking or you don't like too much noise or you can't sit without AC. Opposite to presidency college, easy to locate and has two floors. Food and coffee - nothing is extraordinary but it's just nostalgia, it's all about ambience  (you may like it or not). If you want to feel the city of joy - just feel it ! 
Among food items i have tried many over years but in my latest visit I tried chicken afgani which is a big chicken cutlet in  some spice gravy and a piece of potato with cold coffee with cream.

The food is just okay. Kabiraji Cutlet here goes well with coffee. If one comes here, I would suggest to keep food not as a priority. This place gets good reviews because of most of the things except food. I am not going to make an exception. Location wise it is situated in the heart of College Street, the 'boi para'. The ambience gives one the good ol' feel charm of addas and intellectual discussions. This place survives on its own heritage, it doesn't need a review to prove its' worth.

Heritage place, though it should maintain some amount of standards. U will have to just wait for ages for a table unless you are lucky. Fans from yesteryears don't even provide adequate cooling! Food quality has detoriated a lot. Cold coffee with cream was just cold water with a bit of coffee taste with slight foams on top :(
Mutton kobiraji was OK, but still not compared to how it used to taste before. 
And please avoid using the washroom.. Ul die from the smell!! 
 A big disappointment

#MoodCatalyst is the word to best describe this place. #Iconic #Legendary are few other synonyms.
Food is below average ('below" may be coz I am a veggie). If you are depressed or in a jovial mood then the mysterious environment will add the fuel to further deepen your feelings.
 The #OldWorld charm with high ceiling and a balcony (1st floor), the "Maharaj" (air India mascot) styled waiters and the service quality will take you back in old British-India era.
#MyExperience - in a 80-90 table (eatery), I waited for approx 10 mins to get a table, then waited for 45 mins (read ONE HOUR) to wait for "Maharaja" (extra "a" for the treatment I got from him) to take my order again another 20-25 mins passed when I got my food (asked for coffee with cream but received without). Taste was ordinary but again the environment was a #MoodCatalyst.

I had visited this heritage restaurant at 3 PM a couple of days ago. There is nothing likable about this restaurant apart from the fact that a great singer sang a great nostalgic song with reference to this restaurant and the restaurant is really huge is size. The place is extremely congested and people smoke freely. Non-smokers like me will find this place not suitable for them. We found some noodles on our table even after they cleaned the table! Waiters have attitude problem. Food is not that good. I had ordered a fish fry and a cold coffee with cream. The fish fry was decent. The tomato sauce (read pumpkin sauce) and kasundi served with it were of poor quality. The cold coffee tasted very ordinary (can not even compare with that of CCDs)! Overall, not a good experience. People may visit this place on the basis of its historical value. But if you prefer food quality and hygiene over anything, this place is not for you.

Heard a lot of good stories about this place but all the expectations were immediately shattered ones we entered this age old historic restaurant. Its shabby, tables are not clean, tea stains all over the place. Ironically the coffee of Coffee house is just not worth it. Even the pakoras were cold and stale. Much disappointed.

This giant cafe speaks for itself. Rather, the historic odour that it holds in. From its floor-stretch and portrait-adorned walls to its uniquely suspended fans, IHC is an added joy to the city of joy. It was the palatable taste that added zing to the no-frill coffee cups. Black-coffee shot was appealingly stimulating, too(as told by a black-coffee addict beside me :-p).There was this small dose of cutness loaded in a miniscule can holding milk, which flanked the cup. Onion pakoras that we ordered to munch on was good,too. And yes, the turban no. 6 was too cordial to be a part of our selfies and serve us his uncharged smile as well.To put straight, it's a place to be in. It's Indian Coffee House, and that says all. Period.

Went to Coffee House for the first time, depsite living in Kolkata for so long. Great place, old buildings have that aura that no good restaurant can have. Got a place just beside the payment kiosk. The food is very good, lots of choices available, pricing is very good but the only thing I noticed today is that the behavior of the attendants are wrong. One attendant shouted on the customer to move their bags which were occupying the other two empty seats on a table. Coming back to food I ordered chicken sandwiches and Hot Coffee. The sandwiches were seasoned beautifully and simply with cracked pepper and butter the chicken was shredded beautifully. The coffee was strong, just as I liked it. Overall a first time good experience on the food .

Place pretty much basic. Service seems pretty slow maybe helpful for couples and friends for whiling away their time. Foods seems OK. The Setup protrays Kolkata about 60 yrs back, not much of a must visit places......

The legendary coffee house... Heritage of Kolkata.. I have nothing new to say about this place.. People love this place mainly because of the nostalgia and ambiance..  Love the Infusion (black coffee),cutlets,fish fry, chicken pakora.. Good place to feel the old Kolkata vibe..

The nostalgia feeling drives  a true Calcuttain over here. 
It's  been almost 131 years foundation for Indian coffee house. The coffee  has degraded  big time and the food does not taste as good as in Cafes and other places.  There is nothing  good about this place yet  there is everything  so peaceful  about this place. 
A place to hangout, a place to do chit chat, a place where  the heritage of Calcutta lies. Simply nostalgia, nothing else.

It is a place for pure nostalgia.One of the oldest eateries in the city and has its essence.Students-writer-poet it is a place for all.The  intellectuals of the city found to be hanging around here.You can sit there as long as you want for chatting or with your newapaper or your new manuscript or a novel.

Good
1.The big clamoured hall can give you privacy amidst all the crowd.
2.Serve simple and tasty munchies

Staff is nice but at times like strict uncles😛.
But that can be taken with a pinch of salt

The legendary Indian Coffee House is all about its heritage and its culture. But in recent years the heritage of this place is degrading day by day. You will find smokers almost everywhere in this place and being a non smoker the smell  of it was very disturbing. We ordered fish kabiraji,mixed fried rice,sweet and sour chicken. The kabiraji and chicken preparation was good but in mixed fried rice in place of prawns they used boiled mutton which was not at all going with the taste. Hopefully the authority try to revive the originality of this place very soon. The experience was disappointing.

Personally for me this one place will always deserve a special mention. Okay I admit their food is nothing special, but the nostalgia associated with it will always make Coffee House one of the famous spot of Kolkata. Here food means debates and meetings, I think it's the only place in Kolkata where our mental appetite is pleased rather than our stomach's. A high five from my side, will always find ways to be here with my pals.

Urged by a couple of my pals, who wanted to visit this supposedly 'heritage' eatery of the city, which is 131 years old now, I reluctantly visited this place, a couple of weeks ago, when we went to the Presidency University, for a conference. The place stinks, and of course I never expected anything out of it, but sitting on dilapidated plastic dusty chairs with uncleaned tables piled with left overs from the previous orders was enough for me to walk away without ordering anything. Also there were rampant rodents here and there. Guess, some heritages are best explored over the internet!

There is an old saying if u don't find a book in college street, probably it dosen't exist n in the heart of college street we hv Indian Coffee House.

Now some of u who never been to this part of the town ( i.e. North kolkata) coffee house dosen't mean its just serves coffee n tea it is like a restaurant which serves diff. kind of items, for more details see this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Coffee_House

I hv so many memories over here n when few days back i came over here again the place ws same as before, the feeling ws a bit nostalgic.

This is one of the legendary eating/hanging out place of kolkata.The fun part of the coffee house is when ur ready to order n call a waiter for the order: "dada order ta neben" from distance the waiter listens to u n when u see he is coming towards u to take ur order he just walk right past u n go to another table n no i'm nt critcizing it, u hv to think in a diff. way cause they are giving u time to talk wid ur frnds or whom ever u with to hang out with them (in bengali just simple "adda")n this is the part i like the most

The food is average but pocket friendly must try:
Cold Coffee n Pakoda n if ur a bit hungry u can try chinease items also.

P.s. so many famous people came over here if i start to say there name this review won't be completed so i stop over here, u guys go n see it for urself😊

Located in the heart of college Street, this is Cafe probably as old as the city itself. the decor has that old vintage feel. They have kept the place intact with almost no changes. The service is very slow, and the food quality is also not good. The food tastes less than average. Good for hanging out.

This place holds a special importance to every bengali. The joint to the legends once to the "adda khana" of supposedly every bengali now. 

You know you get the essence of Bangaliana and a strange dominant pride for being a part of this rich culture  and you will find yourself in Indian Coffee House. 

The mutton kabiraji , chicken cutlet, fish cutlet, chicken sandwich , egg devil , coffee with creme are some of the items we order more often.

I'd say that Indian Coffee House appeals more to the history enthusiast in me than it does to the foodie persona. It is a fact doubtless that this place has played a huge role in Kolkata and people remember it for all its significance but well, let me just say that history doesn't always save the day, especially when it comes to matters of food.

Had a Vegetable noodles, a mixed Hakka noodles, a hot coffee, and a cold coffee. The noodles were good and their quantity was rather too much. The Coffee, however, wasn't good. I didn't like it one bit. I felt that I was merely drinking cold water with a pinch of coffee powder in it. 

The ambience is actually pretty nice with an enormous open space. Prices are reasonable and the service is okay.

The reason people love this place: Nostalgia. And... that's about it. Nothing else. The decor oozes বাঙালিয়ানা. You might have to wait for minutes to get a seat, and there is a fair chance you might bump into your professor here, if you are a student of CU.

The Cutlets, Fish Fry and Infusion are a staple here. The sandwiches are way too dry and you need a couple of cups of beverage to wash it down with. The chowmein and the other chinese items are nothing to write home about. There isn't anything wrong with them, but they are not delectable either. Sometimes, they are not even available.

Coming to the service, the waiters have an attitude of school headmasters, and you are likely to get a scolding if you call them more than once.

If history means nothing to you, don't come here. You will be disappointed. If the thought of you going somewhere where luminaries like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Subhas Mukhopadhyay and Shakti Chattopadhyay once frequented gives you goosebumps, then you are wasting your time reading this review. Just go there.

As a kolkata fanatic always wanted to come here.  I was overwhelmed with the size of this place and the people too.  Friendly staff and numerous addabazi people is what I immediately came across.  Got myself a seat next to rhw window.  Tried the substandard coffee and a decent mutton chop.  But somehow my second cup turned out to be better. Coming here is more of an experience for the history buff in you.

Visited this place quite a number of times. It has a old world charm about it. It's huge and replete with the nostalgia of its golden past. As far as the food is concerned I have tried almost everything on the menu and I would say it's nothing extraordinary. Though the coffee they serve is decent. The room is filled with smoke and is a bit suffocating. The service is slow and the staffs behavior is not up to the mark. Something should be done for a better experience.

What's the difference between Calcutta and Kolkata? Some say that it's the same and there are some who believe that Calcutta is an emotion. I believe I fall under the category of the latter.

If you're in Calcutta and not visit this heritage, you're truly missing out a lot!
This place is sheer nostalgia of the yesteryears, of the rich cultural background of the city. While cafés like CCD and Barista has opened up in almost every corner of the city, the amount of joy and happiness you'll get it in here is 100 times more than those cliché places. Coffee house is a place where you can sit with a cuppa and a cigarette to indulge in deep conversation for hours. And the best part is, no one will bug you to leave. 
I keep visiting this place over and over again, yet I cannot get enough of it :)

I know there are many people who are going to be shocked by my rating but this is honestly the maximum rating I could give this place.

I know it is considered to be a heritage place of Kolkata and everyone makes it a point to visit the COFFEE HOUSE atleast once in their lifetime. So even I visited it once.

The experience was horrible. The whole seating area was filled with cigerette smoke and I felt claustrophobic. The waiters were taking a stroll all over the place and attended the tables they wished to, no matter how many times you make efforts to grab their attention towards your table.
Then finally when we placed our order, it consisted of :-
FISH KABIRAJI : very poor quality of fish provided.
CHICKEN HAKKA CHOW : the worst I ever tasted in my entire lifetime. God knows what they serve in the name of hakka noodles. The street vendors make better noodles.

This was my first and last visit to the great INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE.

Indian Coffee House - this is a brand in its self. A brand that signifies the heritage of the rich colonial past of Kolkata. 
I didn't really visit the place to taste the food, it was more to feel the old world charm that this place excudes. 

Unfortunately I've only visited this place once, and that was enough for me to understand why this old old coffee joint is so very celebrated. 
Located at a stone's throw from my university, it definitely is a place that remains a crowd puller even after 75years of its initiation. 

It is so spacious inside, and one can easily occupy a window seat and smoke while sipping on hot coffee without any interference. Sounds perfect to me!

Now, the coffee tasted really good. So much so that I had 3 cups of it in a span of 1.5hrs. The other thing that my friend had ordered was the very famous Infusion, or the black coffee. We coupled our coffees with Onion pakoras and it was a delight. The pakora tasted quite good frankly.

So our bill was 140 bucks. Hah. Nothing compared to the ambience of the place. I loved the ambience. Seriously. I'm definitely visiting it again.

P.s. the service is quite good (that's what I experienced atleast), and the servers were more than happy to serve us cup after cup of coffee.

Definitely coming back!

A place you visit solely to take in the atmosphere. This place has a charm to itself. Even though the coffee isn't that great. The food too is just ok. But still you will visit the place just to take in the essence and pride of the gems who were regular there. The food price might be a shock. For Rs. 100, you can fill stomachs of two.

I have never tasted their coffee or tea,but my friends said they didn't like it,n some said they did,so it's upon you to decide :D. But they should focus a little upon the cleanliness,they should strictly not allow the visitors to litter over the place. Its good that they allow smoking,first i was nervous,then i found its completely fine with them:P. But this message is to the visitors,please don't dispose the ashes on the cafe floor.

Yes , visit to coffee house once is a must . You can smoke freely,talk and,laugh loudly.For those who dont know about this place ,this is not a dine in but a very decent ,sober place to have "adda" . Now its not like old days where senior citizens even chatted, laughed , it was a delight to see them but now teenagers and kids are mostly there smoking and hovering over the place . Some waiters quarrel ,comment but few are very polite as I have seen .Food is cheap but taste is not that good ,sometimes very bad. Still the feeling of being in a heritage and reminding sometimes ago it used to be purely bangali "adda" is over the top which we can get anywhere ,its not what everyone calls 'hanging out ' nowadays. Still now their too old , 'anytime you may fall ' furniture feels comfortable than any sofas. Sure to visit a lot more no. of time .

Loved this coffee house. Mostly the coffee houses I have been to, in South India, are normal mundane restaurants serving normal local dishes. But here, the environment, the elegant surroundings, everything inspired me. It gave me a feeling of being in an intellectually intense surrounding.

 We just had coffee,  bread toast and mutton cutlet. Taste was very good and the price is very cheap. 
Some might not like the smoking in the restaurant. But otherwise, a wonderful place for good evening hang outs.

I've been there quite a lot of times. It's undoubtedly the  best place for adda with your close ones. But my last experience was horrible. Went there on my birthday with some friends on a Saturday and the service I got was disgusting. 
The quality of the chicken cutlet and fish fry has surely gone down. I could not eat the fish fry at all since it was literally smelling like raw fish. 
The waiters didn't behave well,  they didn't even bother to respond before we were like begging them to come and take the order. 
Not at all satisfied with overall service. 
They should at least serve good food and fulfil its basic purpose.

a gem at college street 

 a hub of intellectual 

 a place for worship for new lovers 

 a coolest place to hang out with friends 

 a shelter house for a person who wants to spend a complete day over coffee ( where coffee starts at rs.10)

Memory, song, nostalgia, price, the dress of the waiters   

the youth  the energy the discussion 

 even the advertisements at the door of many arts and cultural programmes   

coffee house is a darling

Coffee house has become a place for people to chat up with friends whilst smoking a pack of cigarettes. The restaurant only runs because of its name and the food they serve is pretty bad. The only thing I recommend you guys to order here is the infusion. It's sweet and a mixture of coffee and tea. Sounds bad i know but that's the only thing bearable available here.

If you take the road opp to the gate of Presidency college, just in the left hand side stands the heritage building.
Indian Coffee House with a big board on the top of the small,clumsy entrance...and the stairs inside welcome you. As enter this famous eatery of kolkata your eyes will catch a big hall with huge number of seating arrangement, with another floor on top, tables are almost full always, huge no of people having fun and chat with coffee, cigarettes and snacks.
An old heritage building with the old cafe charm of kolkata... the waiters with their  white uniform and turbans makes this heritage feeling more lively.
👎 Though the charm of this place is best in its own way.. but in compare to today's market the food quality is not value for money. Neither good is now there service...waiters are slow and inattentive. This place needs proper maintenance to keep their charm and popularity intact among youngsters. If I really rate,

Food quality : 2/5
Food quantity : 3/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service : 2/5
Decoration : 2.5/5
Location : 3.5/5
Recommendation : Must visit once.

Heritage eatery! Has been dominant spot in many major literatures and bengali songs. What i like about the place is how waiters dress , their turban (cap ) reminds me the old charm we see in the bengali movies of those days. The two tier coffee house , however needs much more maintainance and a mojor renovation to maintain the legend of its own. Another major thing i disliked is the way waiters keep compelling guests to share tables and asks other people for sitting opposite to your table , specially during weekend rush hours. Recently on a visit had one chicken cutlet , fish fry with cups of coffee. The prices as kept low would do justice to the food that came , but the coffee wasn't tasting like coffee at all. So in my opinion Coffee house needs major changes in terms of establishment maintainance as well as food to keep on dominating as one legendary cafe in calcutta .

Been here for more than 5 times in a row, nope u guessed it wrong not in here but in College Street. Alas! 😑 It's my first time,so me along with my friends want to make it memorable. Well, the moment I stepped my foot in it ,there was a strange  wonderful feeling as if I am in 70s or 80s.The ambience is too free, service is praiseworthy,food(only coffee)is also good. Oh! and of course how can I forget, a perfect place for gossip and petpuja at the same time .

Been here several times ! Heritage place. Feels different. Food served is tasty, service is speedy. Staff is pretty amiable with superb memory! 
We ordered chicken sandwiches and mutton kabiraji and cold coffee. We were 2 people and that felt more than enough. 
Standard was great. Tasted good too. 
Ambience is noisy but you'd go there anyway knowing the facts. 
Looking forward for further visits. ✌

Want to feel the heart of Kolkata, you are in the right place. You will definitely catch up the most interesting, indulging, intellectual topics around you just cropping up over cups of coffee. It's a legacy,a reflection of its history over years. From adda to gossips, from poems to language of love, from politics to socialism, from right to left, it has seen all and still experiencing. Amidst all the chaos, all the crowd you can feel its charm.
Coming to food, you will find variety in cutlets, pakoras, chowmein, sandwiches. Coffee is a must here.

So it turns out I still haven't reviewed several favourites in Kolkata, including the Indian Coffee House. And then I call myself a Bong. Tsk, tsk. Ideally, a place like this shouldn't require a review. It's not a coffee house, it's a legacy. It's housed more intellectual discussions than college seminar rooms and it's part of the essential Kolkata identity. To my surprise, however, I noticed that it has a pretty low rating on Zomato. 
I get it. It's not your bright, spotless little cafe. It's crowded, messy, sweaty and mostly filled to bursting point. Attracting a waiter is a task in itself and you have to wait forever for your order - not to mention that the seating arrangements follow the spirit of the communism so beloved of Bongs and you are quite likely to be joined by a whole bunch of other customers just when you were getting sentimental with your special someone over the coffee. But that's what this place is all about. You don't come here for the cafe experience. You come here to savour precisely this chaos. And honestly, the food is worth it. For astonishingly low prices you get some great chicken sandwiches, chowmein and onion pakoras. And the milky coffee isn't half bad either. And the best part (for me, at least)? It opens right onto the first floor of Chuckerverty and Sons, one of the oldest bookstores in town where you can sit all day amidst the teetering piles of classics of all description! Buy yourself a volume of poetry and peruse it over several cups of coffee. Or discuss it in the most highbrow terms possible with a long-haired wannabe Keats, again over several cups of coffee. This place is perfect for it all. 
Kolkatans and non Kolkatans - you haven't really seen Kolkata if you haven't dropped by here yet. Do. :)

Gist: Recommendation is must for your enemies. Can be used for achieving inner peace. 

I visited the place on 26.03.16 around 4.00 PM. The placed is very big and can accommodate large groups, only positive side. Washroom is big also. Getting a table was easy. Then problem started. After 10 minutes of giving order for 2 items (Chicken cutlet & Fish Fry) they informed with attitude that items were unavailable. Then asked the waiter what we else can we order and with his recommendation ordered fish finger & chicken pakora. After 10 minutes again he came and said that was unavailable also. So ordered hot coffee and by mistake that was available. That also served after 20 minutes. Nothing special there. Nonsmoking zone should be there. Waste of money and time. Would rate with -5 if possible.

If u r looking for an AC option .. with comfortable sitting , impeccable service .. and a great coffee as per the name then this is not the place for you. 
But if u r looking for discovering the intellectual side of the Bengalis ... their heritage ... the debates ., the start of a college love story ... the political discussions and where the food becomes secondary to all the things I have mentioned then u shouldn't see any further. This is the place. A place which owns the entire college street area in terms of its name ... u will fall in love with this place just because of the people visiting here.
Food is just secondary. Nothing to boast for except few. The simple coffee was even very unimpressive .. But as the saying goes you may not fall in love with the food here but in no way u can ignore this place. This place has a rich historical presence.

India Coffee House = Bengali nostalgia. Once the favourite hub of bengali college students, intellectuals, artists, thinkers is now way past it's bygone days. Stepping in its first floor cafe invokes memories of that era when renowned Bengali singer Manna Dey sung in his soulful voice "coffee houser adda ta aaj aar nei"😢 

Running this historic establishment in itself a big achievement. Food is nothing droll worthy. Apart from the nostalgia, and Pre-Independence era architecture, nothing special anymore.

Though it attracts like a lot of crowd from all over calcutta and india and its a really nice place to hang out,chit chat,grab a smoke or two with ur friends and all,but being a resident of college street and being a regular here i would suggest not to try any kind of food here,just sit back and relax with ur pack of cigarettes.Have tried a lot of dishes here,starting from baked fish,moghali patha,sandwiches.But nothing is up to the mark.I also once found a bone in my chicken cutlet.I really like the fried egg though.But the best that this place has to offer is its ambience and infusion along with a plate of onion pakora and yeah dont forget to tip ur waiter because if u are a regular here and they remember your face they will not so not be intersted in coming and taking your order from next time on.

So I'm not a big coffee guy,i like the cold coffe better here,and the fish , mutton chicken cutlets all are fantastic,i had an toast and omelet breakfast here which was very good,but the sandwiches were not that good.its an paradise for smokers who miss smoking in posh dining places,and for non smokers like us the adda with friends makes it up.

INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE:       Heard about this place a lot from the famous song of Manna Dey and some other sources, so I had a wish to come here.Now I have visited it several times, when have been in College Street for buying books.

ADDRESS:          
      15, Bankim Chatterjee Street, West Bengal 700073. It's located opposite the Presidency College, College Street. The nearest metro station is M.G.Road, I think.

SOME WORDS ABOUT THE PLACE:       
     Serving since 1942, this place has a serious historical significance to it, many legendary people like Satyajit Roy, Amartya Sen used to come here. This place is good for regular hangout and is a meeting place, for intellectuals, students of Presidency College or other nearby colleges.

MY EXPERIENCE:            
        So it's a hub of intellectual debates, with some coffee & snacks. That's it, don't expect delicious food here. Everything in the menu is pretty average & there are many places with better coffee or snacks. I tried their chicken hakka noodles, pakoras, sandwiches, infusions, all of them are average. I, personally didn't like the atmosphere that much because, some intellectuals can't have debate without lighting up cigarettes. Some of the staffs there are also rude. 
                         
CONCLUSIONS:           
       Doesn't matter how good the food is, how nice the staffs are, one living in  kolkata must visit this place once at least,because being the meeting  place (or place for regular adda) of many famous poets, artists, literati it has played an important role in kolkata's cultural history.
                            I am uploading some good pictures from Google to give a feel of it!

There is hardly any Kolkataian who isn't aware of the Coffee House. Ask for any spot near College Street, they will reply you with, 'this many' minutes from Coffee House. Yes, despite being a coffee shop, it greatly serves as a landmark. Situated at the heart of College Street, just opposite to Presidency University, stands this decades old heritage.
Spread over two floors, it has high pricing for upper floor customers serving them no extra benefit. The lower floor is a large hall with tables and chairs circling around the table; the upper floor is more like a balcony of a movie hall with seating arrangement like lower floor.
If you are expecting the place to be like a café in the likes of CCD or Barista, then my dear you are greatly mistaken. The ambience here is highly chaotic. People talks here in rather high pitches and each tables pours in vast amount on knowledge. The walls warns about risk of smoking and prohibits smoking too. And, like all other warnings, they smile at it and continue doing what's prohibited. Yes, the whole hall smells of cigarette adding to the discomfort a person already is in.
Kolkata, known as the City of Joy, is also the city of surprises. The coffee shop of this city probably serves the worst coffee. Even, the roadside vendors makes way more drinkable coffee than the coffee house. Though the coffee is pathetic, other items available on the menu are comparatively better. The sandwiches are good to eat, so are the onion pakoras. People tend to like cutlets and other items too, but, I haven't tried them. The staff always have those boring glances and always ready to gnaw in the name of tip.
This is also a near perfect place for couples as they feel less troubled at this junction of people who mind their own business and hence can carry on their romance at perfect pace.
Even after these many years, this iconic place, popularly known by ICH among the youth, continue to buzz with people from all the ages, society, groups. It is a place perfectly capable of defining diversification.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) A visit surely to experience the place and its traditions where many notable scholars once had their blueprints poured over a cup of coffee.

Qs) Why have I rated them 2.5 stars?
Ans) I tried my level best not to rate them 1.5 stars. They really do not deserve stars, but, considering the history linked to it, I have added a star.

Simply GREAT!!! Why? The best thing about this place lies in its charm, authenticity, and history. This place is so authentic that you can simply sense the glorious days of age old Calcutta (Not Kolkata!). And preservation of old style is also a positive points for them. They were never the best and top in food part. But they were the best to offer a perfect hang-out place for all ages, all time. There is something in the air which will fill u with nostalgia when u take the first sip of their chai or coffee. Heritage and History is something that u can't buy with money. It has to survive through ages and pass the age of time. Bengali's are never complete without it. It's wall have seen many lives, felt many emotions and heard many stories from different period. Hope it survives!!!

This place is legendary and an institution by itself, over many decades it has hosted many intellectuals and their adda sessions. Eminent film makers, writers, artists,musicians, revolutionary thinkers all have come to this coffee house and partaken in the adda there over cups of coffee and some snacks. The place has retained its old world charm, somewhat!! They have spruced up the place slightly but not much. The tables etc seem to be the same. The servers dressed in their white uniforms with old style head gear are charming to look at but lackadaisical in their attitude to serve.
"Before the dawn of Cafe Coffee Day 
Intellectuals spent hours here making gay
Sipping drinks made from finest beans 
Long before girls started wearing jeans".........
You feel that you are in a place that witnessed a lot of intellectual activities and as you sip a cup of tepid coffee or munch some oily snack it is not the food that enraptures you but the thought of being in a place that witnessed history. 
Thereon lies the charm of this Coffee House which the swankiest new cafes with their delectable drinks and food cannot replicate.

It seems weird reviewing Indian Coffee House, how can you review something that is a legend and has a legacy as long as my arm. It has been the centre of intellectual intercourse through ages and it has got a face lift while it has retained its old charm some years ago. Now it harbours thinkers and non thinkers alike over cups of infusion ( a black brewed coffee) and cigarettes and plates of food... Chicken sandwiches, fish fingers, pakoras and breast cutlets and Afghanis. Indian Coffee House runs in the veins of all true Calcuttans!!

You can see college students handing out here! Quite a spacious place! But might get crowded since students love this place.

I have so much to tell about this place I don't really know to start & end. My college being located nearby, this is the go to place for my gang for adda over cups of coffee. However the coffee is actually highly disappointing. I have tried the hot coffee, the cold coffee & have finally come to terms somewhat halfheartedly with the infusion & this comes from someone like me who is a coffee addict & can survive on coffee for days. There is lack of maintenance & the crockeries are actually stained at times (which is so unhygienic). The waiters still dress themselves in uniforms with the turban & all which is quite interesting BUT they are very rude at times. We even got scolded once for being loud :(

As far as food is concerned, I have tried their chowmin, chicken pakoras & chicken sandwiches.. none of them are anything noteworthy. The mutton afghani will be the only dish I would somewhat recommend. Also my friends sometimes have cutlet and/or kaviraji which taste good but I find them really oily & hence avoid.
Anyways, summing up.. the sole reason you would want to go back to this place again & again is the place itself with its nostalgia, old world charm & the heritage it carries with itself as it stands stall with head held high in the heart of College Street.
 My college is about to end & despite the bad coffee, I am going to miss this place.

The hub of tradition and a heritage place, coffee house is all about nostalgia and never ending adda sessions...ambience is its usp as no other joint can provide such an environment...it is always crowded and finding a seat is difficult even though the seating area is huge comprising of the main hall and balcony...food pricing is reasonable...

To be honest, during my initial days in Kolkata I heard  A song By the legendary singer Manna Dey which went ---"coffee house er sei adda ta ajj ar nei ajj ar nei". This made me want to visit the coffee house.
Situated in College Street, The Indian Coffee house , like it's legendary name, has an ambience of a bygone era. The place is full of College Students from the nearby universities. As soon as you enter into the main hall, which is huge, you will be embraced by cigarette smoke and a cacophony of various noises ranging from the tunes of a guitar to the tapping of tables.
On to the food now. Fish fry, Fish Finger and Chicken cutlet were between average and good. But the cold Coffee that I ordered was pathetic. I wasn't very happy with the staff behaviour. They seemed indifferent.
Coffee house is more of a heritage cafe than one that makes you really fall in love with the food. It's good for a get together with college mates, for going back in time and recollecting memories only until you do not order food and drinks.

The only reason you need to visit Coffee House is the long old tradition it holds. 
I personally do not think the food to be the best one. But definitely quiet a decent one especially when you have your group of friends with you. 
Huge Huge spaced interior.. and because of the x factor of being "coffee house", this place feels very welcoming. 
Have tried the shingaras, I liked that. The mughlai didn't go well at all. Gelusil to the rescue, maybe? 
Recommended for sure, keeping in mind you order less oily food.

The Indian Coffee House is a heritage building located on the heart of the City of Joy. Very few eateries have such history associated with it as this one! We didn't actually plan to visit the place; we were passing by and thought of dropping in. There is huge space for accomodation but still it was very much crowded. We had a hard time finding a table. Reasonably priced. Service was quick. We had hot chocolates and samosas. Samosas were delicious. Hot chocolate was one of the best I have ever had. There's a constant buzz over here with people chit chatting over a small bite.

In one word this is Kolkata's heritage brining the concept of coffee shop anow in the modern days we call it as cafe. :). Most legendary place in terms of food, adda, political discussions, the attire of their staffs, the furniture. in the most recent days the food quality has detoriated.

After a long wait, visited the oldest and classic cafe of Kolkata. This place is one of the heritage places of Kolkata. The place has a sitting capacity over 300. There is a hall and balcony section. Ambience is okay. Went there and tried their Mutton Kaviraji and Chicken Cutlet. The sauce which was provided with both the dishes was amazing as well as the small potato served with cutlet. The Kaviraji and the cutlet was an average one. Price is also reasonable. So was a good experience for me. Thank you to Zomato for their valuable food suggestions.

Okay,so this place is considered legendary because it's a very old cafe house initially specialising with finger food n ofcourse their coffee.
As time passes by things go worse and the waiters are horribly rude but at the same time it's amazingly pocket friendly.If you ask me now I'll strictly tell u not to be there until and unless you hv a terrible pocket crunch and don't feel like sitting back home.
I just wishes things go back to where they r

The place with a rich history. This place is about nostalgia and not the food. A legendary place, the first to introduce cafe culture in the country, coffee house is famous for its infusion coffee. The chicken afghani, the sandwich and the mutton cutlet, should be on everybody's "must try" list. Sitting there and having a chat with college friends is a different experience altogether.

 But the Nostalgia of Kolkata that you get when you sit there a pictures on the world the stars and their dresses the cigarette stains on the cigarette smoke that's all that you need to remember that you live in one of the best cities in the world.
Catches of the modern day trends where go and order some chocolate brownie some shakes some lattes, but nothing can beat coffeehouse.

heard a lot about this cafe, and had good expectations.
the food and coffee is of low class.
there are a couple of distinctive "no smoking" boards but lot of people ignore that and smoke carefree.
when i objected this behavior to the staff, they brushed it off with a lame excuse that its a public place and they care not about smoking.
staff are very arrogant and hardly take orders and serve in sufficient time.
overall, not a single good experience.
the staff is there to just hang out and not to do their duties.

The heritage place in kolkata maintaining the Calcutta tradition..the place has got a lot of significance and emotional attachment among all bengalis..the place is old fashioned,with a huge sitting area..perfect to hangout with friends..staff is little arrogant and they hardly care what u say or call..the place holds a special place in everyone's heart..visited after hearing a lot..should visit to to discover old Calcutta tradition.
For not having a separate smoking area,the place becomes a little problem for non smokers..so the rating 4

Cigarette butts everywhere. Didn't mind it though, as long as the vintage feel made us feel totally nostalgic. The chicken kaviraji was on the okayish side, have had much better cutlets before. It wasn't served too hot, but served quick and is of course pocket friendly. However, I don't appreciate the food served. And umm the cold coffee, was not really coffee! Don't make the mistake of ordering it. Indian Coffee house is thus for the feels. Extra points for the very well mannered waiter who served us. I don't see why there has been such complaints against their staff before. Oh and the washroom is super filthy.

everyone are much aware of this place very well..

the only thing I can do.. is to share my last experience there...

I've been here after such a long time...
the changes I noticed is the chairs.. they are using new Plastic chairs instead of the Traditional wooden chairs now a days..

environment is as usual.. busy.. crowded.. lively..

the tastes and quality of food are also same as before..
I've ordered Egg Sandwich, Mutton Afgani & Cold Coffee with Cream..
both food dishes are good, but I felt the Coffee a less densed.. it would be better if made a bit stronger..

in a single word.. Coffee House mentioned it's Quality & Tradition till date..

Dear foodies, I am going to take just 2minutes from your valuable time to share a true story of my life.
I was a regular visitor of Indian Coffee House, the quality of food was not up to the mark there. But, to me it was a place where I visited to chat with people, so I overlooked the issue regarding the taste of foods there. Recently I went to I.C.H. and that was the worst experience, after ordering a simple coffee, I had to wait for 45minutes. Moreover, I have to call the waiter (of my table) as there was a clear mark of lipstick on the cup, but instead of changing the cup, he started arguing with me. So, I will never visit that place again, and will not suggest anyone to go there!!

A place of heritage... Located in the centre of college street, The Indian Coffee House is a story that we've heard throughout our childhood and has longed to visit it. Visit the second floor one instead of the first floor one and soak in the atmosphere. I loved the Chicken Kaviraji. At 65, it was worth it. The Moghlai Paratha could've been better. We also had cold coffee with cream and felt it was moderate. Awesome experience altogether!

As a presidencian, this an every second day visit. Once u get a seat, start ur adda and order some pocket friendly filling food. Baked fish is the best item on the menu and by most evenings its finished up to get one. Egg sandwiches and kabiraji are my favourites too. But coffee house coffee is not that great! Lemon tea is better option

Visit this place with a heart to visit a legendary café. You may have to wait for sometime to get a table. When inside, you are definitely going to feel like a part of history. Classy decoration yet simple. The walls are adorned with classic paintings by legendary artists.
But one thing you should definitely not expect from here, i.e. good food and drink. Just walk in to gather a lifetime experience, the experience of different flavours and hues of the city of joy,Kolkata...

Neither a resident nor have any business in this central part of Calcutta. No other restaurant that I know of around this area. Coffee House was the one that could save us from being starved after hours of buying books in College Street.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: Since it was my first time here, I was amazed to see so.. SO many people under one roof! Probably the biggest cafe/restaurant in town! Such a lively place with people's chatter all over the building.
Service is below average. Staffs are very busy and rude.

FOOD: Chicken Kobiraji and Fish Cutlet were nice. The cold coffee with cream was good too.

Coffee House is barely a place for those who are looking for proper food here. It is a place where you can give hours of 'Adda' with a cup of coffee and some snacks, may be.

Imagine yourself harking about CCD, barista, Costa cafes to your kids. Surely, 20 years from now these places world be relegated to oblivion.The reason you would go gaga over these places would be because they are associated with your memories and have become a part of your psyche and self-identity.

One such place is this iconic one. Only this time it's not associated with your memories but that of your predecessors.A flight of stairs with grafiiti-laden walls welcome you in. If you are alone you share your seat with some stranger and perhaps strike up an interesting conversation.

Your mind also wanders & wonders how the not so popular celebrities & intellectuals might have brainstormed their ideas here.

Be here if you have an imaginative and open mind. Soak in the atmosphere. I tried the chicken cutlet and cold coffee here but haven't anything to honk about.

Visit this place after your sweaty sojourn at college street and get refreshed..

I drop by this place quite a few times when I am buying medical books with friends at College Street.Every bit of this place express the essence adda in Kolkata discussing everything starting from politics, sports, movies over a cuppa and few puffs of smoke.The servers are bit arrogant here and they at times pressurise for more tips even after u give them some.But I don't pay much heed to them and come back here for the nostalgia and heritage this place is enriched in.Ambience is loud with people of all age chatting loudly with each other but that gives the adda vibe which I like a lot.
I tried the following things here

Coffee-Average
Chicken sandwich-Very buttery and tasty
Chicken afghani-Spicy and good.A bit oily though.

Visit Indian Coffee House more for the sake of Old World Kolkata charm with friends more than the food and hospitality.

Coffee house stands tall amidst  college Street. The food is not what you would call the best, but if you want to hang out with your friends over cheap coffee, sandwiches and take in all that college Street has to offer this is your place. An amalgamation of old and the new, with grandparents having a nice chat over few cups of coffee to youngsters taking selfies over few puffs of cigarettes, coffee house offers it all.

Buying several books, we eventually got tired so we entered the very well known place of college street, The Indian coffee house. Coming to it's decor, as always the hall is well lit with the bangali appearance everywhere. As the famous bong 'adda' starts here the place was filled was people of all age groups. Tea cups filled the table and on almost every hand a lit cigarette burnt. We ordered a chicken cutlet, chowmin some sandwiches and cold coffee with cream. The chowmin drastically had salty sauce which destroyed the entire chowmin dish. Rest was nice. Had a nice time spent there!

You don't go the coffee house at college Street for its food,you go there for the 'Legendary' tagline of this heritage establishment. This place is always filled with lots of people and huge amount of cigarette smoke. You are bound to inhale smoke even if you aren't smoking. The staff isn't very polite here but they serve you your order within a short span of time. The coffee here is alright. I had once ordered cold coffee from here and it was the worst I had ever had in my life. The sandwiches can be presented in a better way,although they have ample filling of the chicken. Hence to sum it up I can say that the food doesn't make you come here,but the idea of adda over many cups of tea or coffee at the same place where many great names of Bengal have come before,sure does lure you here.

Anyone living in Kolkata for quite some time has visited here once or twice , and college goers like me has visited tons of time . And it's not about the food than about the sentiments of coffee house , the adda , the excessive smoke of cigarate or the waiters fighting with kids for some weird reasons ..It was same as always but Haka chowmin we had today was surprisingly good than other day and sandwich was dry and tasted like foot ..

it's undoubtedly one of the historic and oldest coffee house in the country.. not rumoured but obviously the place has witnessed minds of great and common.. from tagore to satyajit and kavi suman to prosenjit.. old interiors that once sniffed the independence  to the renaissance.. its story is magnificient.. 
Laze around amidst the commotion with a strong coffee in white cups along with a book or even the guitar.. 

Be patient with the service and leave some tips for the old waiters.. trust me they have withered all weathers..

If you are a Bengali you know what Coffee House is all about.
For me it was a place where I can have good food with nominal rates and can smoke without those staring Uncle & Aunties after a tiring day of book shopping.
Its huge space wise.
Sad part is I hate the coffee there, however the cold coffee with cream is nice.
The fish kabiraji  is good.
The sandwich is really bad. Apart from the coffee and the sandwich all the other options in the menu card are good.
Great place to hangout with friends. The noise of people talking and the crowd will never make you feel lonely in-case you plan to visit alone.

Indian Coffee House is something every college goers (or College Street goers for that matter) can relate to. A haven for time immemorial "addas" with an exquisite feeling that the same chair where you are sitting and churning up a smoke is the same chair where your grandfather may have done the same, is something which sums up the charisma of the place. 
Coming to the food, it is as basic and blunt as it gets. We ordered for a Fish Kabiraji and a Cold Coffee both of which seemed below ordinary to me. The price however was as cheap as ever. The service as of date too didn't remain that extraordinary, which was once a topic of demonstration of restaurant service for my father. 
All in all, a 3.5 from my side only because of the innumerable number of seasons it has passed with pride and remained distinctly in the Kolkata food scene.

The Legendary Coffee House of Kolkata.
Vintage interior. Classy looks. Old Architecture. And hours of adda. Thats sums up the Indian Coffee House.
We used to go and seat their for hours when I was in my first year in Presidency. And we used to have a good time.
But apart from all this Coffee House is really poor at service. The waiters aren't efficient nor well behaved.
The food is horrible. I can suggest you to only have coffee and nothing else. I never found any of their food proper.
Go only to hangout with friends and chat for hours and enjoy the ambiance. :)

"Coffee house er shei Adda ta aj r nei..." Being a bong this song pulled my attention towards this place... A real heritage of The City Of Joy...!  Evry single bong living atleast once in Calcutta hav visited this place for sure...! It's been here since ages...! But with time EVRY SINGLE THING  abt this paradise has degraded..! It used to be a place for the intellectuals...wich now have become a place for d cheap crowd of the city... Food is just WASTE....! Horribly bad...but if ure college is near College streat area then u can hang out wid ure buddiess out hea wid a cup of coffee...
Recommended Dishes - coffee and cutlets..!

The Indian Coffee House. Ah.. feels nostalgic while entering the place. A famous place where lots of famous people have been to.
The place is in College Street which is very famous place for School and College students. It's just opposite to Calcutta University. The place is always crowded lots of college students visits this place everyday. I can easily enjoy the place by going there with friends.
I have tasted Mutton Kabiraji and Mutton Afghani as well as the most common thing for which coffee house is famous for is coffee, infusion and some other thing. The quality is very good as per the price. You will definitely love the place along with food.

Visiting this restaurant I was thinking about the famous song of Manna Dey 'coffee houser sei adda ta aj r nei' . For the bengalis this is not a restaurant bt a heritage of all great memories of historic personalities. The waiters serve here in their own old unique traditional uniform. But coming to the food its not atall good apart from the hot coffee....bt as I have said earlier it is a heritage nd we all should go once ideal for #timepass nd #adda

Not a place for a foodie but definately a favourite  "adda" hub for all calcuttans. Whenever one speaks of coffee house, sentiments run high and no matter how bad the coffee tastes we never fail to shed a tear of nostalgia. Talking about food and coffee, I have tasted coffee wayyyyy better than what is served here. Last time I visited we ordered a moghlai which was quite good but there is a BUT coming in, they served it after 1 hour. No kidding,  1 hour they took to serve 2 moghlai parathas.

If you are in kolkata., it is an offence if you miss Indian Coffee House . The old heritage reflects the image of a few generations , the long ceiling fans and the wooden table chair, brings a magical feeling. 

The cold coffee with cream tastes much different than that of CCD and all, but it has its own beauty. 

But do not miss the fish kabiraji. It is like a must have .......

So one should have his/her mind blown atleast ones over here.

Seeped deep into the history of Kolkata, this place is not so much about the food, but all about the ambience. It is certainly the best place in town if you are looking for adda without spending much money.
You can spend hours over a cup of coffee without anyone shooing you out. On the other hand, usually the waiters take their own time before even taking your order. 
I like their chicken sandwiches, which is pretty much the only thing I have eaten there. If you want something to drink, go for the black coffee, or infusion as it is called. The stuffed omelet and the baked fish taste pretty good. It is best not to eat the Chinese they serve. The place is a smoker's paradise. However all said and done, Coffee House never fails to awe me simply because of its grandeur and the atmosphere that has remained constant over decades.

The famous adda spot in the city. But honestly the place is only good for adda but not the food.. we ordered a chicken kaviraji, mutton afghani, fish fingers and coffee. All were average in taste.. still the hot coffee and the cold coffee were better than the rest. The best place for adda for hours and hours over cups of coffee .

Disastrous food.
Ambience isn't something you should be searching at coffee house.
It is a legendary place for adda n simply the infusion or normal coffee,which are consumable to say the least and yes the onion pakoda as well.

The cold coffee is actually like a cup of hot coffee set aside to cool down and then served as cold coffee.
And the rest of the food item arn't much of a delight either. But if you have to you can give the fish fry or afghani a try.

But as I said it is just a place to hang out with coffee,pakoda and cigarettes with all the ancient hype and some so called intellectual visitors and a huge and at times irritating college crowd.

Nostalgia... Only word I can say about this place, in my college time we used to hang out there & always ordered coffee with onion pakora with sauce, once in durgapuja times ordered noodles with chicken, can't remember, anyway....the food quality is average, if u r a bong culture lover & know what is a typical Bengali Adda pls go there, non AC, only with long celling fans, big window, witness of many incidents... Service is too bad !!! Well if u enjoy the place, that will become a habit :D

Coffe,onion pakoras and loooong adda ,tha's what u need to do. A place I like and miss (not the food but the memories)a lot. Though I have given it a 4 star but Coffee house worth a try.

'Indian Coffee House'......Yes, the name is enough to recollect some memories with your friends! It the place where traditional mixes with modernization and old memories dipped into new ones!

Two floored place with traditional sitting arrangement and remains crowded during School or College hours!
It is a place which is famous for its Adda, politics, Debates, Nostalgia, History rather than food! Yes, the Cutlet, Kabiraji, Coffee changed its taste by day to day but the adda is still there!!

You will hardly find any bong, who don't ever heard the name of Coffee House! Donno how much it will attract a person with its food, but if a person is a 'adda' loving person then he/she will definitely come to this place once!

In conclusion, I can easily say, if you love to hangout with your friends, a real fan fan of adda, golpo nd political discussion then come to this place just for once and Coffee House will be in your hearts forever!!! <3 <3

Today's review is jus not a review but a warning for the future visitors. It was a family breakfast cum lunch out. Keeping in mind bout d historical background n charm of this place we checked in although we found it was a hamartia on our part to visit. Coming to d main stream now, the behaviour of the waiters were extremely rude, annoying and disappointing. Loads of senior citizens were employed as waiters( so I guess it's quite evident how much delay they might create in every spheres). Aweful, dull and suffocating ambience as cigarettes were lit up almost in every tables (forgetting about how much harmful effect it can create). Neither the staffs possessed that much courtesy to serve at least a glass of water to the customers nor there were any kind of arrangements to do as such. Delay in taking down the orders which at last resulted in serving wrong dishes. Except the chicken sandwich nothing was up to the mark,not even the coffee (as it has acquired 'fame' for coffee itself). Their serving of the low quality foods with disfigured cutleries made us mad and disappointed simultaneously. Really since childhood from songs to adults whatever I had heard about this place,today after experiencing that in person I somewhere felt that it was such a waste of time, money and mood. Do avoid this place its an ardent request only if u feel that ur money, mood and time is worth.

Reviewing Indian Coffee house is just not the Cup of Coffee for people like me who were born in the 90's and use their smartphones to locate new-breed of restaurants growing up in the city.   The indian Cofee House as of today is a legendary place, carrying an enormous  quantity of heritage and history along with it. The food quality, service, staff behavior might not go more than 1.5-2 out of 5, but the ambience, the life and the long bracket of customers starting from 8 years to 80 certainly deserves more than 5 out of 5.

For the people who have never been here, should try atleast once just to see the Life, and not always the quality of the service or food.

P.S: The Indian Coffee House belongs to the part of the world when its was knows as "Calcutta" and not Kolkata. :)

Indian Coffee House in college street is not just a restaurant to get an accurate hair splitting review in Zomato. They are not to be judged with the cost and quality of food, cold hearted behavior of staffs and not even with totally messed up service! :)
It is a heritage of this city with a soul. It is the place where so called intellectual Bengali grow up puffing cigarettes, sipping tea and onion pakoda (Piaji). Though it is around 3/5 for ambiance, only 2.5/5 for food not so different food quality, just 1 for their messed up service and 3/5 for their food quality, they deserve 4/5 overall. It is getting extra marks because you are good student and teachers just cant let you fail even if you are spoiled now a days.

What pulls me to this place is d history associated with it... once a hub and platform for d intellectual and d seeding ground for socio political movement has now sadly reduced to a smoke chamber. I request d management to provide atleast a smoke area if not able to ban smoking in d place... there are many non smokers who kind of avoid d place as especially post noon d place so  damn reeks in cigarette smoke... 
D nostalgia pulls to for coffee the only stuff I like there and yet d smoke drives me out everytime I stop at d place. There is a board to voice ur opinion at coffee house  which nowadays goes empty... as if d voice of d city is dying..
M in tune with Manna Dey though in a different context-

Staying in Central Kolkata amidst the buzz of thousands of students in College Street this is one of the most popular places in the whole of Kolkata. Notable people have been there and Manna Dey's 'Coffee House er Adda' also shows you what this place means for Kolkata. Generally filled with students and the old generations who realize that adda here is mich more precious than any malls or other food outlets. The infusion, a pack of cigarettes and long hours of discussion and adda with friends is what Coffee house is all about. If you stay in Kolkata or you are a Bengali from any part of the world Coffee house is the place where you have been atleast once in your life.

This is a real tough place to review. For a certain visit the rating might be 1, while another visit might fetch a 4.5. And this not due to their inconsistency. No, they are consistent in whatever they do. It depends on with what expectation you visit the place, when, with whom and several other points.

If you are around and want a quick bite, or a heavy meal, don't visit this place. If you have all the time in your hand and don't know what to do, if you are looking for a place to sit and spend time and if you don't really care about the food, but a long adda - this is the best place to be.

If you are lucky you will get a seat quickly, if luckier your food will arrive within minutes, and luckiest if you find whatever you order. Servers are cold, but if you are a regular, they will treat you well.

Most of the items are not available most of the times. Coffee here is nothing fancy, but then we spend 100s on rubbish coffee at some swanky chain of cafes. So when I get a cup under 40 I wont complain much.

If you are lucky try the grilled fish, fish fry or tomato omelettes. These are among the best foods available here and they taste quite good. The Chicken Sandwich here is old school without mayo. Dry but not bad. And with long adda sessions the best item to order is the onion pakoras.

Nothing new to say. Heritage of Kolkata. Best place for adda with friends. You can sit here as much time as you want. Just in between you have to order something, at least a cup of coffee. As well as the food is concern, they have cutlets, kabiraji, fish fry, noodles, rice etc. Once I have tried chicken afgani and it was delicious, though it was quite rich in masala. But best place to spend time with friends.

Birthplace of the intellectual adda of all Bengali's. This place is not only a coffee junction or a restaurant, this is heritage, history of the progressive Bengali culture. If you are looking for a cozy luxurious cafe then don't visit here. But if you want to experience a noisy, full of nicotine smoke place with a offbeat experience then this is the right place for you. I have visited numerous times with my family friends. Tried there hot coffee, cold coffee with cream, onion pakora with sauce, chicken hakka chowmin, chicken cutlet. Food quality is not too good but it does not really matter.

Visited this legendary place in college street quite a number of times but it never failed to impress me (may be i am being partial :P). The prices are very less and it holds the yesteryear charms till now. It has a huge seating capacity spread across 2 floors. People come here and the chit-chats continue for hours over a cup of coffee. Surprisingly none tells you to leave the table. Rather than concentrating on food only, I think one should focus more on its glory, its legacy, and its cultural connect. The kobiraji, cutlets and sandwiches here are quite good. A must visit place for one n all at least once, considering it to be a heritage of the city.

The oldest place for Adda. Now it's mostly dirty, full of smokes. well aging brought the cons. pros includes the still rocking black coffee. Though it is suggested to to have any coffee item in coffee house, black coffee without sugar is bearable. The onion pakoras are fabulous. The chowmein is worth a try.

This time I am planning to venture into mother of all the coffee shops in Kolkata- The Calcutta Coffee House, college street. Seldom comes a food-joint which can rise above the stature of a food-place and becomes epitome of cultural history. This is one such place. Calcutta Coffee House is known as the hub of intellectuals in Calcutta, but sadly, hardly anyone has looked into its gastronomic offering other than coffee. This is an attempt for the same. Much has been said about this place by a lot of wonderful writers, this write-up is purely on the food aspect of this place. So, let it be…..

How to go and where to go:-

This is opposite to Presidency college on college street. The albert hall was found in 1876 and Coffee Board had decided to start a coffee joint in 1942 there. Since then the intellectuals and college students have flocked to this place. The reason primarily being cheap coffee and most importantly, here if you occupy a table for 4 hours with one cup of coffee, nobody’s going to ask you to vacate- such is the legacy here. But the main challenge here is to get a free table (though they’ve got a huge huge sitting area). Still, try your luck and go for it.

Ambience:

Its a legacy here in Kolkata. And, the saying goes, if you haven’t been to this place in your college life, then you’ve not reached. Basically its on 1st and 2nd floor of the same building (I personally prefer the view from the 2nd floor but sitting on the first floor- your choice now !!!). Comfortable working sitting arrangement, good number of ceiling fans (yes, coffee shops can be non-AC too) and experienced, seasoned waiters- that’s Coffee House for you. Oops, did I forget to mention- they allow smoking inside- even today…

 Here, the biggest catch is to catch a waiter and order. They’ll try to push you with chowmin and all the nonsense, but I would suggest not to go by it- go for their house specialties. We went on ordering.

We ordered numerous cups of cold coffee with cream.It was actually old fashioned which I personally liked. No heavy dosage of cream and ice-cream etc and pure, chilled coffee served in a water tumbler with a straw (thankfully).

Next was chicken kobreji cutlet and Mutton Afgani cutlet. This first item strangely, has nothing to do with the particular style of medical practice. Its that the while the chicken cutlet is getting deep fried, whisked egg is put on it (in the same deep frying state) and the egg is transformed in a crispy yet fluffy coating over the cutlet. Hence chicken coverage > chicken kobreji. Mutton afgani cutlet is simply mutton cutlet covered with a hot, thick tomato based brown gravy with some vegetables. Both are pretty heavy and tasty.

With all the dishes here, we ordered buttered toast as a standard side-dish, which kept on coming. Next was fish afgani cutlet (again with buttered toast). I personally preferred to wipe the last of the gravy on the dish with the toast piece and not to waste anything- you may try the same. The fish given was Vetki (and thanks, not basa) and was quite full-bodied.

My friend, on the other hand, didn’t like this messy, gravy thing and went for the coffee house famed chicken cutlet with buttered toast. Sadly, it was not quite up to the mark. The omlette was heavily oily and the chicken stuffed inside was tasteless and chewy. Didn’t like it.

Cursing, he ordered some chicken sandwich and again cold coffee to gulp it down. The sandwich was a revelation here. Its the old classical chicken sandwich with butter and seasoned boiled chicken inside. We were recently fed up with an overdose of all the mayo, cheese and what not in the standard sandwich joints. This version is an welcome and needed change from the same. We were full, but next time, I am going to order this only.

 We were full and definitely happy. The pocket pinch was not really much and adda was priceless. Shall we come again ? Definitely yes…..

 Bon apetite !!!

This place is located in college street . This place reminds crowded throughout the day . service is very slow , food is low priced And regular. A very low maintained place , keeping it's value from the past in mind they should keep it clean and maintained. Overall average,  rather a good place for snacks.

Coffee House and bangalis have a connection which is not only for the food served there but it's the ambience the nostalgia which one feels on visiting there. This place is the ideal place for a lunch time or coffee break adda. It was never about the quality of food it was always the feel which draws everyone to this historic place. A must visit for everyone.

The place is more than just a dine out place.. People go there to meet friends... to talk, to smoke, coffee was not really up to the mark.. Kabiraji, pakora etc are ok.. But it is Hetitage and Pride of north kolkata and every student who have been in college street during their college days..

Don't judge this place on it's food quality or ambience, it's all about culture and heritage. It is the place where the "no smoking" board is just a joke. Lol.
I have been here many many times, with parents, with friends, alone etc.
Sometimes I waited for long just to eat their oily cultural moghlai, I like that. Hehe
Adda is the main part of this place and cigarettes too. Thank you.

Well, rating this place only as a food joint will be grossly wrong. There is lot more emotion attached to this place. Each and every corner of this place has nostagia attached to it. Earlier it used to be the dining place for many prominent personalities if the city but now the charm is gone. It has become a adda rock for presidency students. One can hardly breath the air at this place as its filled with tobacco smoke. The food quality has also degraded.

A sheer adda zone, with some decent time pass experience. Have been there many times, impressed with the tea/coffee. And yes lot of cigarette smoke in the air.

Of late when i visited there, it was amusing to note that the billing/collection was still on manual, hand written ledgers, time to upgrade this state centric co-operative enterprise. Never the less nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia.

I can't possibly say anything that has not been said before. Kolkata would not be Kolkata without this legendary cafe. 
I have lost track of the number of times I've visited this place. Needless to say I love it. 
Among all the beverages they serve, Infusion is the most famous and is commonly known as the 'buddhijibider panio'. I personally prefer coffee over tea and cold coffee with cream is my favourite. I've tried their piyanjis, cutlets, and kabirajis but among these cutlets are something I'll go for any day. Frankly speaking their Chinese items are below average or average at max and can be skipped. 
Being a reviewer I must not let my fandom dictate my review so let me get started with the flaws:
First of all, being very crowded it is very hard to get seats.
You might have to share ur table( though very small) with strangers.
The waiters take heck of a lot time to take your order.
The order takes considerable amount of time to arrive at ur table.
Some items are a bit overpriced and not all the items are tasty. I know some of you may hate me for saying that but this is genuinely what I feel.
But overall this place is nothing short of amazing and has held on to its rich cultural heritage and have seen many a generations grow old while having their favourite cup of tea/coffee.

3 factors that make coffee house so special are:-
1-Bong Nostalgia
2-Legacy
3-The famous song by Manna Dey
Other than the above mentioned factors there is no other reason someone will choose coffee house avoiding the lavish coffee chains of the city...Somehow overrated by bengali's (time to brace myself)...Big space,old fans,lots of crowd and rude waiters are symbol of this place...I will surely visit coffee house again when my bong nostalgia will be at its best(otherwise no chance).....

I dont think this place needs any intro! Located at the hub of college street opposite presidency college. This place is totally a students hangout, and if you are a cleanliness freak or need your order served in time then absolutely avoid this place. It's an adda joint where time passes by carelessly. Speaking about food i like the moghlai paratha, chicken sandwhich & coffee.

Indian Coffee House is a place that truly defines the essence of the city. The passion in the addas, the air of intellect, the coy glances, the new and old friendships all co exist. It is all there. What perhaps has been missing is the quality of the food served. The coffee seemed diluted, the sandwich, a bit stale and the fish fry is no good with the good old bhetki being replaced by basa.
The chicken omelette is far from being enjoyable. 
Go to this place to feel one with the city, grab a black coffee (the only thing that has managed to hung on) and enjoy endless hours of adda.

4 for nostalgia, 3.5 for ambience,2.5 for food.

You don't get good food in here. This place offers nostalgia. Many of the dishes don't really taste good. However, who cares, when you can have smokes and infusion, sometimes a sandwich to go with it. Rating this place on the basis of food is unjust. However service could definitely improve. The waiters are often very rude, which is not a plus point. Then again the rush is mammoth.

A really nice place to hangout with friends. Cool and relaxing atmosphere (if you are comfortable without the AC). Menu is not too elaborate but the foods are served quick, but then who visits this place for food. It is known for a place to chill and do a lot of adda. Gathered a group and looking for a place to chit-chat, then this is the place you are looking for.

Needless to say, The Indian Coffee House near college streets possess a legacy of being one of the most vibrant cafeterias for many generations. A regular visitor for many years, the food quality has gone down drastically, to a point when it was considered of having numerous finger licking delicacies. More than the food, the ambiance is something that will set the mood of a good chat sessions among the friends.

Go for the nostalgia if you were around during the period that this joint represents. It is a very simple coffee shop where the likes of Tagore and Ray have sat and drawn their inspirations from. The waiters roam around in uniforms that were probably designed during British Rule. Slow service, slower fans and no restriction on smoking. It's a great place for just hanging out with college friends as it's pretty cheap.

A heritage of Kolkata. The atmosphere here feels history consolidated and nostalgia. The steaming cups of beverages, the swirling cigarette smokes and the endless chatter from the occupants of the table. An out of the world and a perfect place for hours and hours of 'adda'. You won't even know how the time flies.The servicing is average, and the food is below average and highly overpriced.But Coffee House is not about the food, it is about the 'adda', the nostalgia, the heritage.A must visit place with close buddies. Go as a foodie, and your appetite, mood, everything will be ruined. Go as an 'addabaj', and you will have the time of your life.

This is in everyone's list of visiting just because it is Coffee House and you have heard the name so many times from your peers and seniors isn't it? This place is very near my house, I have visited this place many a times and the purpose was to spend some time without a pocket pinch. Do not keep any other expectations out here. 
If you want any recommendations the only thing I can suggest is the chicken sandwich and that's it. 
There is nothing called a service, you have to ask and ask for anything you need.
But then again just to be a part of a place that is there for so long one should visit this place at least once.

Another visit to the famed. Have tried almost everything from their menu. This time I went for chicken hakka chowmein. Good to quench my hunger at a meagre price. More than enough in quantity okay in quality. Don't go for the meal, look for the past here. Look for what others are looking for. Not those young ones but the old souls with young hearts discussing their old life and this dying state attracting the centre stage at the corner. Those used to discussing revolution in a bygone era.

This generation growing up on food courts and pizzas may not associate with coffee house's addas but like the song from Manna Dey, this epitomizes the culture of Kolkata. A must visit for anyone visiting the city.

Indian Coffee House is one such place where you would never say no. One of the heritage food places of Kolkata has maintained its legacy. You will never find this place vacant or less crowded. The best thing about this place is its awesomely unique ambience. People of all ages come here and talk their heart out. The chirping sound of chit chat is what differs this place from all other places. They have kept the interior same as what is was years before. The place has never changed , it has been the same place for years.

Location:
Well, I am smile writing this. You just go to College Street and ask any person. You will get your place. And I don't think people staying in Kolkata really need that option.

Ambience:
I just love the ambience. The vintage Kolkata style. "Adda" over a cup of coffee, this place is just the perfect place.

Service:
Service is little slow but its negligible as there is a huge crowd and they still manage everything so well. 

Food:
The food is pretty basic. The coffee is good what they are giving in that price. I love the coffee,chicken omelette, chicken kabiraji, mutton kabiraji.
The other chinese dishes are pretty ordinary.

Last words:
A must visit place for everyone in Kolkata. This place will definitely make you feel you are in vintage City of Joy. A perfect place to have a good "adda season" by spending very less.

Indian coffee house or  coffee house is situated jst opposite The Presidency College main gate a landmark where history oozes from each & every inch of that place...since I did my graduation frm a college situated in college Street ...this used to be the place where we used to skip our classes & engaged in adda session for long hours. Taste of Coffee here is not out of the world but ordering one cup of coffee actualy allows you to sit there for a long time. Onion pakora is less of onion more of coating...singara is OK...chicken kaviraji taste good but they lack consistency...Main drawback is that U hav to wait for a long long time before the waiter actually comes to you & take your order & even takes it longer to deliver what you have ordered...My ratings are high since this place has sooo many happy memories.

You go to coffee house for the experience not necessarily for the coffee. Do not try the infusion I repeat do not try the infusion. The kabiraji and Afghanistan cutlets are excellent and take long to come out of the kitchen which is good because you get  to soak it all up longer. For most of us it is a nostalgia trip , lamenting bygone days and college prems. It's always full so be prepared to browse books at rupa while you wait.

It's not the food here I go for, it's the atmosphere. Ive tried mostly all the sandwiches & fish items(which is my goto for most places), but mostly would stick to a simple sandwich & a hot coffee rather than experimenting more. 
Yes, it's pocketable coz mostly targeted to the college goers & book buyers. I.M.H.O if the menu is broadened & the quality is upped don't think people would mind paying that much extra. 
Still a spacy & beautiful place to get a true Calcutta vibe.

Indian Coffee House is the perfect place for you if you are looking forward to inhale a lot of smoke, without even lighting a cig. You might end up with a year's worth of tar in your lungs, within 15 minutes or less.
The food served at this legendary establishment is below average. We tried the mughlai paratha, chicken sandwich, chicken pakora and the cutlet. None of them were good enough to deserve special descriptions. 
The place mainly runs on cheap prices, nostalgia and service. The service is the best part of this place. The waiters do not even note down your order, even when the place is jam packed (which is almost always). They just listen to your order and leave, only to return with your complete order in minutes.

This place is a heritage for sure. Just opposite to Presidency College and 2 mins from Calcutta University main branch, this place is always filled with students. Students having fun, coffee and cigarettes is common. Yes you are reading it right, smoking is allowed inside. They also serve Chinese food. There is a high probability that you will come across few creative minds.

No need to say anything new about their heritage or their coffee! Everyone knows they simply cant make coffee or tea or anything. Some foods were good a few years ago, but my last visit was massively disappointing. None of their dishes are orderable. Yet its an open smoking zone, and a total messy place. And their service, the worst I have ever faced. I would rather stay hungry but wont go inside again. And that's my opinion to you to..

Not that the food is very good or something. But this place is like a heritage of our city. It makes all of us nostalgic and we visit again and again. Have been here many times and given a chance will visit again. The cost is low. The food at times is good.

This place is known for keeping it's originality. Great place for evening snacks for all people enjoying in a group. Very affordable. From butter toast to chicken pakora. In non veg kabiraji and afghani is my personal favourite. And yes infusion no one has just one cup of infusion. Gossip over a cup of coffee with guitars, friends this place is awesome. Can change ur mood anytime such awesome this place is !!!

Well, the Indian coffee house is known for its environment rather than its coffee! 😉 
College street is full of 100year of legacy restaurants... Coffee house is one of them 😃 
Surely you can't get the best coffee in town here, but absolutely no place in Kolkata can't ever get you a warm affable atmosphere like this.
Do try out their kobirajis n Afghanis. 
RECOMMENDED!
***** Stay away from this place if you've asthma or you're allergic to smoking!

Well..legends need not be reviewed. We just feel..coffee house is one such place. After an exciting tour of books in the book para and the typical old Calcutta feel, its mandatory to visit the coffee house. It will make you feel nostalgic. I ordered a cold coffee and chicken sandwich which has got the same old taste as it had since the first day I went there. Anyone who goes to college street should definitely visit this place, to have a feel of Calcutta and its people, books, universities and more.

The place is still holding the heritage of our Kolkata. It's the main hub for "adda" in North Kolkata. The Coffee and other food are average. It's often crowded,lucky to get seats. Be ready for late service,go there when you have a lot of time to spend. If you are seated on the balconies then the price of food will be little bit more. In total it's a great place for living the heritage of Kolkata...

For me it's a serious old school place. Spend so much time since childhood as it was beside my school. Nobody goes there to have good food but to enjoy the ambience. If you have time.. and want to spend it with adda , black coffe and memories, you should visit at least once. No other resturant can take it's place.

Pricey, bad food. Rude waiters. Unclean crockery. Terribly noisy atmosphere. I wonder how successfully this place has milked its "nostalgic and sentimental value" for decades. Even for those of us miserable plebs who have none of that, many wouldn't dare say a thing against this place because that would mean one isn't truly an aantel bangali.

This is not only about food, this is about a nostalgia! Almost a heritage with great history speaking a lot about Calcutta and her golden days. The first thing that comes to my mind about this place is infusion! Had uncountable cups of infusion over the years. If you are looking for food here I would suggest you 3 dishes, chicken afgani, sandwiches or my fav chicken omlet! Maybe the food ain't the tastiest still it will be an excellent experience!

The thing about Coffee House for me is surely the ambience. The dim hubbub inside that high ceilinged hall, skirted by balconies is something you might want to sit there and experience. 
I don't know if they were better in their good old days, but they surely have maintained a certain vintage feeling what with the wardi of the waiters and all... There's a strange melancholy into it. 

Getting a seat here is still a trouble. Took about five minutes even in a sweltering summer afternoon to grab a table for two. 

They allow smoking. And I can't tell if it's a good thing that it's one of the rare places where smokers can sit freely and smoke or a bad thing that non smokes has to suffer through this ordeal of smokes. The place is so huge and airy though, that it doesn't get much stuffy and suffocating with all the smoke. It was tolerable alright, for me. 

About food, the mutton/chicken afghani is a mutton/chicken cutlet with a tomato based gravy poured on top. The cutlet inside is nice with perhaps a little less filling than agreeable but then the price is somewhat low too, so I didn't mind. The gravy has an interesting sweet taste, the tomato being very dominant. I didn't hate or love it. 

The mutton or chicken cutlets, when not presented in the Afghani manner, comes with a thick stick of fried potato, crispy outside and heavenly, buttery soft inside. That, with the mustard sauce along with the cutlet has the potential to make you happy for some time. 

Prices are on the lower side. No taxes. 

Overall, as a bong, or rather a Calcuttan, you should probably have one experience of this place and if you are one who comes to college street for work, you're gonna wind up here pretty often to grab a cutlet and coffee, all under 100rs. :)

Indian Coffee House is a place which doesn't serves nice food, located in College Street, Albert Hall. Yes! but the location,the ambiance,the complicated service structure is just over the top! The restaurant serves a nice cup of coffee at 20 bucks but actually you would have have paid for is the ambiance.
 Yes, people smoke there despite of the " No- Smoking" tags but who cares when you can dip in a mode of serious "adda" for just 20 Bucks!!!

The ambience and service of this place is commendable but the food is not up to the mark though the price of the dishes is quite reasonable. Especially baked fish disappointed me a lot but chicken afgani was quite tasty. I would suggest not to try the coffee of this place because it's too sweet. This place is more like a hangout place for college goers.

This is a place that borrows heavily from its legacy to keep going. They make sure that it gets more dilapidated with each passing day. The stairs leading to the place look like a slum. The interiors are in ruins. The stench from the toilets make you want to barf. The food is stale. People smoke violating the norms a stray poster tries to enforce. But this doesn't stop anything. The place is always houseful and attracts marquee customers. The sum of all the bad things is apparently good.

Going to this eatery on a hot summer afternoon is a big no-no; if it's crowded, or you get a seat which isn't under the dangling fan, then you've had it! The attentands were out-dated just like the infrastructure, they were quite rude too. Food was good, I tried out fish fry, cold coffee and my sister chose chicken haka chowmein. However, a person who is in love with bengali tradition and culture would love this place. Honestly, I would have loved it during a cool winter afternoon. :)

I like to eat the kaviraji here and will give 3/5, rest about hot or cold coffee i will just give 1/5, the chicken sandwich smells raw chicken and i will just give 1/5, it's always crowded with people from the age group of 18 to 80 where the beauty of Indian coffee house is different... service is poor...

Coffee House is left with fewer things to offer you with except for the ambience, the legendary charm and the nostalgia. Those who study at any of the institutions in the College Street area have surely dropped in with a group of friends to chat and spend some quality time. You can come here when you have loads of time in your hands as the waiters are not in a mood to take your order or serve you really soon. Half of the dishes on the menu are just not available and the ones that are available are not really tasty or anything special. The only thing I love to have every time I go there is the Coffee House Infusion. I love that unique flavour of the coffee. They could surely show some development in terms of food and the behaviour of the waiters. Otherwise, Coffee House at the heart of College Street is a place where you relive the charm of the bygone days, time travel into the past and have some dear addas with your friends. Even if you do not like the food or the service, you just cannot hate this place.

This place is located at college Street. It's maybe the oldest and most famous cafe of Kolkata. This cafe remains crowded most of the times and the ambience is very average. The food quality is nothing special and to ne honest i felt that they need huge improvement in food. The staffs are not very much friendly and most of the time they would take a long time to come and deliver the food.it's a pocket friendly cafe.

I guess I've tasted almost all of their items one time or the other. Being a student of Presidency univ gives me the privilege of dropping by at this age old iconic College Street coffee hub that has inspired the golden song by Manna De. A bohemian place for painters, artists, students, book lovers, politicians, office goers, foreign tourists, film makers, intellectuals, photographers, journalists, couples, families alike to gather for discussions, banters and addas, the effervescent character of this eatery with its classic coffee house culture and uniformed waiters still manage to attract crowds every single day. The balcony view and walled paintings add to the old world charm of the ever popular coffee shop that defines Kolkata and Bengalis. Note: their cold coffee and chicken pakoda are worth tasting. Also the cutlets and kabiraji are notable. Not to forget their special chicken/ mutton Afghani.

Not sure why this doesn't come under the tag of 'Legendary Restaurants'. Truth be told, 'Legendary' is the only tag which saves this outlet from closing down. Horrible food, not-so-good ambiance, there is absolutely nothing which is good about this restaurant.

Situated opposite to another legendary institution Presidency University, and between stacks of book stores all around, this is a 2 floored cafe serving mainly coffee, tea and snacks. This was the place where many freedom fighters used to gather regularly to discuss, plan and coordinate their attacks and strategies against the British Empire. This place has given birth and laid wings to numerous poets, activists, social workers, freedom fighters and people of popular stature.

But, as 'Manna Dey' had said, 'Coffee House-er shei adda ta aaj aar nei'...
The coffee here tastes bland. The snacks are not worth it. If at all you need to visit here, do it for the nostalgia and the heritage. Hop in with a group of friends, order some Cutlets or Kabiraji along with a cup of tea of cold coffee and engage into friendly discussions over puffs and suttas! That's all Coffee House has to offer to you.

The place is all about the history associated with it. The ambience, the waiters' uniforms,  the building itself, takes us back to the old times. I wish the food was good, it is already a booming business but if the food was good, things would be even better. Even the coffee tasted bad. And baked fish was nothing but fish cutlet with a weird tasting gravy all over it. Really disappointing food.

Once upon a time it was a talk of the town. But it has degraded its quality. Now it is popular only because of it's heritage. It is a huge spacious restaurant having two floors. Uniquely designed. It remains always crowded. U will find a lot of students over there. Even it is very popular among the aged people. Basically they serve snacks. Overall not bad.

I have been to coffee house since i was a child. This place has definitely remained the same over the years.
Location : right opposite presidency university. Ask anyone, every body knows coffee house.

Ambiance : well coffee house is primarily about its historic ambiance and the nostalgia of having renowned Bengali's sitting on those very chairs. But coming to chairs, they have bugs. And i have more than once had allergic reaction after sitting on them. So, i have mixed feelings. Its definitely spacious and its nice to see so many college goers together all engrossed in their own worlds.

Staff: the staff have been working at coffee house for years and hence they kinda rude.

Food: Cold coffee is decent. Mutton kabiraji was yummy. I love their chicken cutlet too. 

You must visit this place at least once just for its heritage, if not anything else.

" Coffee houser sei adda ta r ache ki ?? .. "

For us bengalis the beautiful song bring us so much pride and nostalgia for many people who have been to this place many times and have spend so much time here.

But what for the first timers ? How good will be the experience now at this time of the year . The answer will not please a lot of people . It's summer , the temperatures are rising everyday and with no AC inside its pretty like being in an oven . So, quite frankly this is not the time of the year if you are really looking forward to a visit .

But that has not crushed the charm of this place , in a hot Saturday evening it's awfully crowded and people seem to going pretty well with the addas and the suttas and the cold coffee. Was a little dissapointed as the fish and mutton items were not available . This was a huge downer . We settled for 

1. Chicken cutlet 
2. Chicken pakora
3. Cold coffee with cream

The 3c s were not much to ponder about . A very ordinary cutlet accompanied with very average pakoras but thankfully pretty decent cold coffee. The waiters donot have the best of mood but if you are good to them they will be pleasant to you .

All in all its a one time experience nowadays for those who donot have much of a memory . But one timers are very important so go ahead enjoy the charm while it's still there .

The Indian Coffee House, situated just across the Presidency University, amidst the multitudes of book shops and educational institutions,in College Street, has been a part of Kolkata's history and almost qualifies as a heritage place of the city. It's a place frequented by college students and professors alike, and is a place of intellectual discussions as well as casual "adda" with friends. This place has inspired many songs and poems and has been etched permanently in the books of Bengali culture. However, over the years, the same cannot be said for the food and drinks served here.
The place, supposedly famous for it's coffee is a major let down in the hot beverage department itself. The coffee is bland with a diluted taste and is at best, below average. If you want coffee, you're better off going to a CCD or Barista outlet. Coming to the food, fair warning, you are going to be disappointed no matter what you order. The mughlai dishes are a major let down. So are the Chinese dishes, especially the noodles. The ketchup can literally make you sick. The only thing that exceeds the qualities, albeit minutely, of the other food items served here are the cutlets. 
Coming to the staff, their service quality is average. however, after all's said and done, I'd still suggest visiting this place as this is a hotspot of cultural activities in the evergreen city of Kolkata. The only pointer that I can offer, is don't go for a pricey or a heavy meal. One should visit the coffee house solely for it's ambiance and it's rich history.

An institution itself,inspite of the omnipresent Ccd's,barista and several other coffee shops,the Indian coffee house stands still and proud amidst the 'boi para' college Street just opposite to the Presidency university ,the place for adda for every bangali,composing songs to the budding love stories of the college students,and there famous infusion (black coffee)...which tastes nothing extraordinary but with a group of friends you hardly care for the taste because it seems worthy...they have hot coffee nothing like latte or cappuccino so please order by seeing the menu,don't simply tell waiter to bring a mocha..:p

From sandwiches to regular noodles etc are their items in the menu which people relish...I have been there maybe twice and had only the infusion,so can't say about the dishes,but go and give it a try for one relaxed evening without thinking about maintaining the etiquette and order the coffee,like with or without cream etc...an old charm to visit in North kolkata the real kolkata...

This is undoubtedly one of the heritage places of Kolkata.
Poets to singers to writers, this place was an 'adda' den for all.
Go there just for the feel of the old world Calcutta, just to imbibe in the essence of old world charm which Coffee house has not lost yet.
This place isn't one of the greatest cafes of Kolkata, true. Ironically, the coffee here sucks big time. Every form of coffee. Hot ones are still edible.
I'm a huge fan of their "fish kobiraji" which is the sole bestseller of coffee house.
Cutlets and sandwiches are good too. "No smoking" banners are pinned on all of the walls but no one cares, u can smoke and eat while having an 'adda' session.

The oldest proper coffee place in Kolkata. This place hasn't only been a part of Kolkata's history but also it's songs, poems, stories and so many memories. Coffee house is there in every Bong's memory.
Starting from their simple tea or coffee to their omelettes to their other dishes, everything holds a real Kolkata's history in it. 

If you're a Bong in Kolkata and you haven't been to this place, you're not a real Bong from Kolkata yet. And if you're visiting Kolkata do visit this place. You'll feel the royalty of the city.

This week I have visited coffe house.It's not the first time I am visiting this place , ambiance  and nostalgia is still the same ,once you get in you feel like sitting for hours, I was there with my friend , everything was fine apart from the food part ,I think over the period of time the quality has gone down, we had mutton sandwich and cold coffee.

I think this place is by far the best place to hang out with friends. You're a college kid with limited money? That's the place to be! Food is not always great (although I only hated the onion pakora in their menu). At that price, the food is actually pretty good. I mean you can go to the top coffee places like CCD but being there and sipping a fair cold coffee of 22 bucks while having a good laugh and time, its totally amazing! Have some great memories of that place. :) TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.

Coffee House is not a cafe, it's a culture.
They don't excel in anything, not a single food item.
You can make better coffees, sandwiches, noodles at your home.
But, it's the ambience, the legacy, continuing from generation after generation.
Class bunks, cigarettes, stray cats, white uniforms, Tagore on the wall, hundreds of faces- you simply can't hate coffee house.

The one and only reason i rated it way above its deserving level,is because of the history and bengali culture attached to it.It  stands as an epitome of the conventional bengali way of life.
As for the food,the chicken sandwich couldn't be more worse.One expects a better quality of chicken to be served when one pays a 40 bucks for it.
The coffee.Oh well! I can make better coffee.
Atleast it won't be cold and stale.
But...even after every negative aspect that i can bring forth to the readers,there's something magical in attached with that place.Something only maybe hardcore bengalis can experience. An existence of vibrant culture in the coffee house.
Thank you.

Went there with 6 of my friends. Nice place for adda. Good ambiance. Great north calcutta feelings. Tries chicken chow and infusion.
Chicken chow was average. Infusion was good. 
Overall nice feeling. Ine should try once in his/her college life, who are from kolkata.

Many malls have formed. many people may like to hangout in food courts. But the  adorance for Indian coffee house can't be deemed. 
I visited several times in my college days with lots of friends. But not I rarely find time to make addaz. 
When I am writing review for this place I must say I have lots of memories along with this. so I am not going to explain any single day. :-)

Coffee is typically homemade(not espresso) but nice.
There was no trace of mutton in mutton kabiraji, tasted ok.
Ambiance: old calcutta charm.
If you are looking for a good place to chill over a cup of tea or coffee it's ok, but not a good place for food.

A place of heritage in Kolkata.A visit for atleast once is absolutely needful.Though there is nothing to brag about the food.I don't like any of their cutlets.The sandwich is nice and light.The chicken pakora they serve has good quantity chicken in it.The cold coffee,i personally like the without cream version.Those who don't like the thin layer of malai on your milk,better go for the non cream version.It is a good place for hanging out with long adda sessions.

ADDA!!!! Only thing that comes to my mind, before and after visiting this place numerous times. 

My first - well standard 8, I was on the hunt for the rare gem of a commodity NCERT books. Those days, getting hold of these books were, like digging a diamond mine. Story aside, what's in store there - here is my opinion (writing a review just won't do justice) of this Legendary Coffee Shop. 

Huge, airy hall structure with two levels, one for the poets and artists and other for the chokra's and chokri's...... Just kiddin' 😂 There are no such division. It's just a big big adda house, with menu options that will complement your ADDA. 

Fish fry/fish cutlet, chicken or fish kaviraji commensurates the service and the rates. 
Cold and hot coffee is Bangla style. CCD or Barista is incomparable. Avoid the main course if not absolutely you need to. 

But if you wish to revisit Bengal adda culture, please don't miss out in this place!!!!

People visit the Indian Coffee House for nostalgia rather than food. It's essential to stop by, soak in the old world charm and smoke a few cigarettes (you can buy Charminar near the entrance, the brand Feluda smoked). The cheap price tags don't hurt either. There's always this clatter of plates and cups in the background. I'm personally fond of the Cold Coffee with Cream (₹40). It's pretty light and one can drink more than a few glasses while chatting. The Chicken Cutlet (₹55) is decent. The Chicken Kaviraji (₹60) is gravy based. Mutton Sandwich (₹55) isn't that grand. So, keep ordering something unless you want the bill handed to you by a slightly grumpy waiter and enjoy the nice collection of paintings on the wall or maybe a book?

The name itslf sounds lyk a royal heritage.
It has a vintage look wth old interior... 
It has the ambience of typical north kolkata. A room always full of life. One could hardly get an empty table. The food is good..  I personally love the chicken  sandwich... it's healthy and yamii.

I use to go there often. But the coffee 🍵 is not too good, it's okay. We tried the chicken sandwich, onion pakora, fish finger etc. Among them I liked the fish finger thing. Everything is okay in coffee house. Yet people should visit there as it's an antique place. Nice for spending casual times.

Indian Coffee House, where do I begin?
The very setting and surrounding of this place transports me back to the days I didn't even exist in. It's spectacular, to say the least! No wonder the place is full any day of the week. Most simply put, I absolutely love the food. I would suggest you go for either of the Afghanis and Moghlai Paratha; the Kabirajis are also the crowds favourite.
Coming to the coffee, you might want to skip the cold one. Other than that, all of them are more or less on point. I'm always gulping down about 2-3 cups of hot coffee or Infusion.
You might find some of the staff to be a little on the rude side, but I suppose you could definitely overlook that given how it's always busy enough to test anybody's patience.
Coffee House is the perfect setting if you want to engage in rich conversation over some coffee and a bite or two, or if you want to just hang out with the college buddies and not be harsh on the pockets.
Have a good one :)

This place doesn't actually need a review. It's a heritage place of Calcutta and a popular location for film shooting. Earlier called albert hall it's a big hall with wooden and plastic furniture...food is nothing special... only their chicken omelette is worth mentioning though it's not always available. Staffs/waiters are rude... this place has it's own aura. The ambiance is incomparable.

The legendary Coffee House is not really a place for food. Neither people can sit and chat for hours over coffee as the crowd pressure remains intact most of the time. I might have rated it more if I was writing it three years ago. Presently the quality of snacks decreased somehow; one of my old favorite, the onion pakoras are always cold and dull. But I still love the infusion coffee they serve, my all time favorite. 
Apart from the infusion, the ambience is lovely, nice paintings, very high roof, skylights, tall wooden doors are interesting.

The name "Coffe House" itself is enough to visit... One thing I believe this place can't be judged by any ratings or reviews ... coffee house has its own heritage, a nostalgia and emotions attached in four walls of this place... Eating on the table & Sitting on the chairs where once Bigger famous personalities used to sit gives a throbbing feeling ...
This name makes its place in Every Bengali's mind after Manna Dey's "Coffee house r sei addata ..."
This place is perfect for gossiping, adda with friends... Whenever I go to buy books at College Street with friends , We stop here to have some addas with some petpujas...
I tried Moglai Paratha, Mutton Kaviraji, Chicken Cutlet, Mix Chowmin and hot coffee...
Taste is good in general... not too tasty...
But this is not a place just to eat... It is where you can have perfect adda...
Now talking about the service... every waiters are always dressed with pagris and suits... but they take too much time to take orders, to serve foods, even to give the bill... but may be it's a trick to give more time for having more addas!

Being a Presidencian this place is the closest to our hearts. From the old north Calcutta feel to the antique decor. You don't come here for the food or coffee, you come here to get the feel of the rich heritage and legacy this place boasts of. I love there baked fish with butter toast. The food items are reasonably priced and are not very tasty but a plate of kabiraji with a group of friends is all you need to appreciate this den of bookworms, film makers, pseudo-intellectuals, college students, and many more

This place would take you back to the long lost years and hence nostalgic. Good to visit and chit chat with fellow mates. Must Visit for the nearby college students (Being a Goenkan, I surely do ! :P)
Coming to the food, it's OKAY types. (Cold Coffee was just yew). And personally, I feel that the food is over priced in respect of it's quality. Needs to be better and their service too.
And found it a bit unorganized too.

This rating is simply because of the heritage value of the place and has nothing to do with food quality. Every time you visit here, you are in awe of the cultural value of this place. The ambiance is super, take a cup of coffee and sit for ages. The food quality is average but you don't come to coffee house to eat or take selfies, you come here to be a part of history.

The name says it all. This is a place which is nostalgic for many people. One of the heritage places in Kolkata. This is the hub for intellectual debates, casual words or even a chitchat session. Went there for the third time today. However since the first visit ended in utter disappointment, I sticked to ordering coffee this time. The cold coffee with cream tasted good. However the staff seemed to be walking with an air of arrogance over there.

This place brings back fond memories of childhood. Though The Indian Coffee House is synonymous with the intellectual lot of the City of Joy along with students and teachers of Kolkata's Boi Para stopping to catch up on their lives and also discussing how their day was over a cup of coffee / tea.

For me this place brings back memories of visiting it with my mother and grandfather after a whole afternoon of books shopping. My favourites were the mutton afghani and the fish kabiraji. 

The food is simply awesome. The bill doesn't even pinch you and the charm of the place is the whole place buzzing with gossips. The pre Independence feel can be realised in the furniture and the waiters uniforms. 

All in all a lovely place to be too and relish.

I have both hot and cold coffee and also the infusion... in foods I tasted chicken sandwich, chicken kabiraji, moglai and chowmin... all are very ordinary... staffs have a hankering about trips... service was very slow... but the historical nostalgia makes me to visit the place again and again... except food it's a very good place for hangout with friends... try to have the 1st floor seating it's fab... pocket pinch was still very low... I got sad while writing this review, because my mind was in flash back... recalling the moments I have spend their with my friends...

Coffee house means never-ending adda sessions of college & office goers. After almost 8 long years I went there. During college days we used to go frequently. The faces in the crowd might change but that familiar humming sound of large groups of people talking loudly is still there and one thing that hasn't change is their taste of food. The mutton Afghani, mughlai paratha, onion pakora are still the same and so is the taste of coffee. Overall a great place to catch up with lost friends.

I guess you can't really call urself a Bengali without having once been to this place.. Located amidst the hustle and bustle of  Kolkata's 'Boi para' is this well known cafe where famous writers and poets of the city were once known to have occupied. The owners have kept the theme the same with the ringing Bells to signals the waiters for order and the waiters uniformed in white attires. The classics are kept alive and u immediately feel nostalgic once u enter. The food is prices very reasonably and the crowd is immense. I didn't like having go share my table with unknown people.. One would think and being a legendary coffee house they would have amazing coffee, that wasn't true in this case the coffee lacked both milk and taste.. Also the food was fried in pretty low quality oil.. The fish kabiraji had a thick coating and very little fish inside. I feel that the place is purely running on its nostalgic factor and cheap prices.

The rating is not for the place but for the food. The place is great for hangout. But the food and their prices is simply pathetic. The menu needs to change with time and the crowd. The only thing that's changed seems to be the prices. Chowmien is not available at all times. The sandwich is mediocre on the lower side. Coffee tastes like warm diluted sugar water. Samosa which is inferior to the ones sold on street stalls at Girish Park and MG costs 8-10 rupees more than those. The Baked Fish tastes like its been marinated in sugar and vinegar syrup. I could go on but one gets the idea.
The place screams for new management, especially in the kitchen department. Still the feeling of the bygone days lingers on and it does give you the feel of old Kolkata. However, I feel that smoking should be strictly prohibited within the premises as is the norm for every public place.

Books, College, Bohemia, the bong adda and Gluttony - all five together lead to this one place - Indian Coffee House- a place which serves both as the youth lounge as well as the thinker's den! Being a frequent visitor to this place during my several literary pursuits, my two most favourites happen to be mutton kabiraji and chicken omelette - the signature dishes! The chicken sandwich which is made in a style indigenous to the erstwhile calcuttian taste is a change from the classic chicken-mayo variant! The coffee doesn't need much mention..the place has a flavour of its own which will linger with the very Bengali spirits for eternity!

This is not going to be one of those reviews where I will elaborate the nostalgia or the rich heritage of this place, in fact it will be quite opposite to that..
The reality, the dark reality of this place now..
If you're one of those people who happen to be a mad fan of this place, please don't read ahead..
Well I'm quite a regular customer to this place and the fact that I'm criticising this place not because I hate this place rather I'm concerned that this place is losing its charm.
People smoking and even drinking alcohol (not openly though and in the night of course) is not good for its image. Girls smoking around openly and guys kissing in the public what is this..it is not your bedroom nor any park..I know adda means cha-biscuit and cigarette but still yaar come on if you don't respect something or some place, you're showing your class. Well I'm not one of those people who don't support the extrovert youth group and their radical thoughts but still I smoke and drink that doesn't conclude that I sit with with my dad and share one..is that?

Sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings but I'm not sorry for expressing my thoughts..

Rest the coffee is ok now..degrading day by day..and the foods which were once very tasty downgrading day by day.. still chowmein and chicken kabiraji can be tried.
Sandwich is good here..delicious types.

Cleanliness is still an issue to debate and staff is extremely professional.

It is hard to find someone from Kolkata, whose college life memoirs is devoid of a slice of Coffee House nostalgia!! And it is one such place which people like to visit again and again. Not only for the food but also for the fact that its one such place where you get to see an assembly of intellectual minds from different walks of life. Be it literature, politics, music or just "nikhad adda"(purely chat for time pass), everything meets here to create its signature ambience, and obviously, that's too over a cup of "Infusion"-the signature black coffee of this place and some delectable tasty bites.

Perhaps, this is the root or origin of the cafe culture that we witness today. 
So, anyday "Indian Coffee House" deserve to be an indispensable part of Kolkata, which keeps the history of the city alive and cherished.

The place carries a tradition. Deep down in the Bengal intellectual circuit the place is next to home. I went there many times on many occasions. My last visit was with my family. 
The place is huge , but non air conditioned , moderately clean , serves coffee , fries and Chinese. 
The menu is normal and many of the things are not available all the times. 
We wanted chowmine but that basic thing was unavailable . 
Anyways we ordered onion pakora, mughali paratha, fish fry, mutton cutlet. Taste was nothing phenomenal , not bad either but decent.  The good thing is that you can sit as long as you want even after you finish you food. I had infusion which is the black coffee . 
Good place to sit and chat with friends and have good food.
A must visit , visit for nostalgia, visit for old taste of Kolkata fries.

Indian Coffee House is an iconic place and therefore I need not write much about it. This is not a place where you go to satisfy your palate, rather one goes there to enjoy the ambiance of nostalgic. The menu is a standard fair, having Noodles, Fried Rice, Fish Fry, Chicken Cutlet, Pakoras, Sandwich, Moghlai and various other items. The taste is quite okay and acceptable considering the price. The only problem are the waiters who look at you, see that you are calling them - but somehow fail to make their way to your table in good time!

Review? For Coffee House? Is that even possible?!?!?! -_-
People, sorry. I am reviewing this not to rate their food or beverages, but for the feeling one gets, as soon as he/she enters the place.  
It has it's own world. The history, the 'adda', the ambience, the air of smoke in front of 'no-smoking' boards, the freedom to discuss anything and everything at your highest pitch- Coffee House is more than all this! 
Even if you are alone, here, you never feel so.
One thing which should be mentioned- Every 'Bangali' must visit this place at least once, but yes, it won't limit to such an odd number! :)
Sometimes spend less, but make sure to enjoy whatever you have spent.

Nostalgia!!!!! That's what describes this place... Very ordinary food, bad service and bad coffee... Still.... The place has the old world etheral charm... And loads of memories dating back to when we had just a penny in our pocket , and not a care for the world, the world used to be a simple place for us school or college goers.... A heritage place in a heritage building in its own right!!!!

When ever I visit College street I always come over here. I had been over here several times. Interior decoration, seating arrangement and ambiance will take you to late 80s and 90s. To be true I cant rate this place as its an iconic place with lots of historical memories. You can easily spent 2hrs without any hesitation. Now come to service part and food quality both are OK. And if its come to price range then simply I would prefer Indian Coffee House rather than CCD. Coffee+Cigarette(yes you can smoke inside)+Gossip=ICH. And yes don't forget to taste cutlet and chicken sandwich, I just loved them.

Giving this rating might get me kicked out from the Bengali community, because, this place is sentimentally attached to every bong. But, hey, lately, I came across a phrase, "Don't judge a book by it's cover, and Coffee House by it's coffee". Spot on. The coffee couldn't have been more dilute, and they charge double for coffee with cream(it doesn't have cream at all, you're given milk in a separate container. And the service is pathetic, the waiters don't seem to care. 

It is  a good place to hang out, though and addas and fun. And, the place has its own charm, intoxicating. But definitely a shitty place for food, or coffee.

So finally I paid a visited to this legendary place with my flatmates for the first time. There's nothing very pompous about the interiors but you still fall in love with the place because of the in built ambience with students,scholars,the chirpiness of youngsters, the picture of great legends and old portraits hung on the wall, each contributing to add to the charm of this place. 
Since it's a big place (really big), service gets delayed because the waiters are not sufficient. The things to definitely try from the menu card are the cold coffee with cream, the normal filter coffee, the vegetable cutlet (believe me it's the best I have ever had!) . On my second visit, I was quite disappointed by the fact that when I ordered egg Hakka chowmin, I could also see lumps of mutton in my plate, something they should take care of . The vegetable sandwich is just plain bread with butter smeared inside with a piece or two of cucumber and tomato. 
Nonetheless, the price is not high at all, and whenever you visit college street, this place is sure to lure you inside for a cup of coffee at least.

With so much of history connected, you cannot ignore this cafeteria.. Actually it is more than that. The ambiance is amazing, it has got a feeling of nostalgia, having witnessed numerous friendships and other such emotions. You have to be there to understand this.
Coming to the food, I happen to like the chicken sandwich and the chicken kabiraji. 😁 the sandwich is really simple yet relishable. Every time I am in kolkata, I make it a point to visit this place.

Probably the oldest adda destination for every bong irrespective of age group.. This is a place where one will find a group of college goers and side by side a group of senior citizens, all sharing their thoughts..
This place allows you to smoke freely without any restrictions..
And another good thing is that they will never say you to get up and leave even if you are sitting without any food and gossiping..
.
Now the food which they serve might not be upto the mark for many people but once again no one goes there for food..
The biggest Irony is their coffee itself which i does not find good at all..
Though one can find the chicken sandwiches good.
The other fried dishes are way too oily.
.
The staffs are well behaved but sometimes they are too reluctant to even come and take your order..

I'm coming to this place after almost 5.5 years and I hardly find anything has changed.The same waiters,the coffee tables,the same cashier,everything seems to be moving at it's own pace,through all these years.
Coffee House is a very nostalgic place for me,and to every person in this city who has been there.Many intellectuals,song writers,film makers,script writers have written their lines by sitting here sipping the coffee.
This place thrives via a charisma which I find extremely tough to define.In simple words a vintage place thriving amidst a busy city,of the 21st century.

Pay careful attention to the walls,the decoration,the lights, the portraits hanging on the walls,the more you look into them, the more you seem to get absorbed in the charm of the place.At times maybe you'll get into a gossip with some gentleman offering you a cup of coffee/a smoke(luck matters a little if you're a bachelor) or if you're with your partner you'll bless the place for its food.

Infusion,hot coffee, cold coffee are the best you can have if you're a coffee biased person like me.If you're the gossip person just keep them counting,and if you're a diabetic request the waiter not to add sugar to the coffee.
This place serves a plethora of snacks:Fish/Chicken/Mutton Cutlet,sandwich, kabiraji cutlet;almost everything you'll get here.

We had opted for some chicken sandwich and infusion(black coffee) which killed our sleep.Once finished we settled for some Chicken cutlet.I need not mention about the awesome taste of the food this place serves.
If you're a college goer and a hungry buff settle for some chilli chicken and noodles/some chicken pakora.I swear it will leave a mark on your taste buds.

The service is good,the waiters are also polite and have a sharp memory.This is one place where nobody makes a note of the food ordered.Once ordered,it is served correctly.It is indeed an art to work with such accuracy,even when you have hundreds of customers a day.

Coming to this place has always been great,and every time I visit Calcutta I would love to keep coming back to this place.On a serious note this is one restaurant that doesn't need any change.Believe me...

Let's get this straight, this legendary coffee outlet is not for food lovers. Quality or taste of the food is actually mediocre. If you want a place in College Street area to hangout or "adda" with friends for long hours, this is the place to be in. In addition, you will surely get a historical/nostalgic feeling once you enter here.

This is a place which has a constantly deteriorating quality. The coffee tastes really bad and costs 35 rupees!!! And beleive me neither the quality nor the quantity is worth that. The snacks are okayish. And the waiters are always in a bad mood. The only good thing about this place is adda. You can have coffee, chat and also smoking is allowed(probably one of the main reasons the place is still runing).

All point goes to ambiance itself. Service gets negative point, food quality and quantity follows. Even the coffee is watery and tasteless. The well-dressed employees come for the order when your hunger has died down, then food comes an hour later. It is only a great place for adda. Though the place is supposedly 'non-smoking area' but it is a paradise for the smokers and choking for the non-smokers.

A place for intellectuals? Or a place for cheaper food? It is an adda zone in the educational hub of Kolkata. For delicacy one shpuld not expect the best taste. Rather treat it as a cheaper option of food in a plce famous for gossip. The choking smoky atmosphere is a big negetive.

Writing a review for this place is really tough. This is place for adda what we Bengali love. Sitting for hours with your friends. Discussing from Satyajit ray to salsa dance. A cup of coffee cigarette and a group of friend,its all you need. Been to this many times. But with the change of time our coffee house has also changed. Now you really can't have that prolonged adda. I am not talking about the food. But it will remain as a special place in our hearts.

It looks so old that it will immediately give you the feeling that "yes, this place had a lot of memories".  Even the servers wore really old British-era guard uniforms. The food was okay, reasonable price. But it's the sight that matters.

A historic snack joint frequented by quite a number of eminent personalities a few decades ago, but now, the place is overcrowded mostly students who themselves would vote negative for the food served there. Don't go by the name - don't order coffee. The food too isn't up to the mark as the name claims its popularity however you can try kabiraji which seems to be the only edible dish they serve.

Today am having my decent tasted Chicken Sandwich with another friend of mine... but am not even bothered about the taste or the service... am just floating in the memories... coz this place is the bucket of memories and it will remain as such forever...

This place is more about feelings than features i guess. Much of an adda place since ages. 
Food, quality , promptness of service.. none of the yardsticks fit in i guess.
The infusion along with a cigarette is what most opt for . That. Your friends. Long hours. Kolkata and nostalgia. A lethal combination.
i too have visited this place quite often. Didnt really like the food to be very honest. The tea was cold. The much famous kobiraaji cutlet was more of uncooked bread batter than meat stuffing. The pakoda was soggy and bony. 
But i dont want to judge this place and break the heart of many. Many a love story took shape here. Many noble men spent hours here. Its not just a cafeteria.. its literature unfolding before you :)

Contrary to all those good reviews I find this place not really upto the mark. The nostalgia is good. But the food & service is equally bad.
The behavior of the waiters are colder than the cold coffee they serve. Not to mention the add on cream which is actually creamy milk & not the foamy cream one would expect.
Cutlets are horrible. After all this the waiters actually expect a tip!
The only thing good is that you can sit & chat with your friends but its better not to eat much from here.

We ordered Mughlai apiece followed by my personal favourite Infusion while my friend went for Hot coffee with cream. The cream was nowhere to be found but the steel milk truncated cone was sexy. The horrible part was the slow service, ours was waiter no. 10. A single waiter in Banquet wing signifying poor management. The coffee was fine and the ambience excellent, with a tinge of past we sipped our coffee in a lazy afternoon.

It has this Old 'Calcutta' Charm, which very few places have now.. We took Chicken Hakka Noodles, Mutton Afghani, Chicken Cutlet, Fish Fingers & Cold Coffee. The food was decent. The coffee was bad. But the experience priceless. The ambience takes care of all the other shortcomings. Will definitely go back again just to spend a few lazy hours with the hope of having a better gastronomical journey.

The Indian Coffee house is an epitome of Kolkata's heritage. It provides with a silent anecdote of "Student life er adda" & intellectual discussions, and above all it perfectly portrays "bangalir nostalgia" for the college street...
    Been here many times... The ambience is almost always chaotic, with saturation of their ample seating arrangements. We ordered Hot coffee with cream, Cold coffee with cream, Tomato omlette, Chicken kaviraji, Baked fish and Onion pakkora with sauce. Both the coffees lacked Coffee...preponderance of milk really disappointed me. Onion pakkora was not good, although Baked fish and chicken kaviraji were able to make it up to a few notch.
     Overall I must say that this place shows signs of degradation over every aspect of a foodie destination... be it quality of food or ambience or servers' attitude. The vintage feel even is on the verge of disappearance due to chronic non-mantainence...

Whenever I hear the name of 'Coffee House', the Manna Dey's song "coffee house er sei adda ta" comes up in my mind. Yes! This is a right place to gossip and smoke. The food quality is not good. If you are a foodie, then coffee house is not a right place for you. If you want to sit here, order a cheese omelet and enjoy your adda. Again I am mentioning, this place is suitable for adda only, not for having food.

If you are a pseudo intellectual, this place is perfect for you.
If you are a foodie, kindly stay away!!

Nothing about the present Indian Coffee House reminds you of 'Coffee House er shei adda ta'. The only thing you notice about this place are a terrible least-interested group of waiters, overwhelming smoke from every direction and 'aantel' lokjon (Bengalis will know what I mean)

True, this place has rich heritage.
Also true, that heritage has been spoilt by the wannabes present here.
So ambience, Bad.

Ciming to food, fish kobiraji was bad. Chicken kobiraji was okay-ish. Moghlai was terrible.
And the irony of it all, the Coffee in Coffee House is the worst thing in the menu!

For foodies, this is just a one-time visit (Fir the heritage, you know!)

I had been there many many many times. It's a heritage place of Calcutta. The best adda place in,whole country. But food quality not up to level. We guys used to go there just for adda and infusion. That's all.

Apart from the vintage feeling you get, there is nothing more to say!The coffee here is disgusting! Same with the food! If you want atleast decent coffee do not go there..Same goes with the food!But yes the heritage and vintage feeling of The Indian coffee house is the only plus thing!

My first visit to the legendary Coffee House..
I am someone who would always prefer coffee house over cafe coffee day..
Reasons being it's loud, noisy, cheap, entertaining, a great place for adda etc. It has huge sitting capacity.
It was sudden plan of visiting this place with those buddies who are absolutely nonsense ;) Our Meet was a total bawaal n this place added more craziness to it. The funniest part was while eating n gossiping,we started throwing sauce,salads nd whatever we had infrnt of us at each other, (madness) :P nd i thought we would be thrown out of the place :P but nothing such happened rather the staffs didn't bother, every time we ordered some item,they came nd cleaned the table.. We were there for more than 2hours without disturbance. [ i don't think i can have such a great experience at CCD, people there are so serious, quite nd calm, just the opposite i@ experienced here n enjoyed every bit of it]
We ordered the hot coffee [extra sugar too], infusion [which i didn't liked much], mutton cutlet, chicken afgani, chicken sandwiches, fish fingers. Food was good enough to make us happy. But i would like to add that chicken/mutton afgani of Mitra Cafe is way more better.. :)
I'm sure from now onwards I'll visit this place more often.

A Calcutta institution, that takes you back because of its yesteryear feel. If you are a Calcuttan and are in love with your city, don't miss this one out.
We had the mutton kabiraji, fish fry and chicken omelette. The cold coffee with cream was quite okay too.
Go for the feel of the place, and treat the food as a bonus treat :)

A remarkable and quintessential heritage of India's colonial past, this cafe despite mushrooming cafes across the length and breadth of Kolkata, stands as an invincible giant.
Keeping in mind the size of this cafe, I surmise it's very forgivable if you take it for a restaurant over just a cafe. Besides it offers wholesome meals too.
The inside is one of its own kind. If you climb up to the first floor and walk up next to the cemented walls and then look down, the entire ground floor will stand bare to your view. It's like a large well, just without the water!
Now now the dishes include almost all the snacks to main meals. You can have from egg sandwiches to noodles and chicken items aside from everything in between.
My favourite though has always been the cold coffee with cream. I don't know why but I feel they make the best cold coffee in Kolkata. Now that could be my unavoidable predilection too!
Now regarding the eats there, I would like to say that this is not really a restaurant let alone a to notch restaurant hence do not have too high an expectation from them. People who mostly frequent here are the students from hard by university and colleges. The food is, exercising ample candour, only average nothing extraordinary or ultra. 
Anyway this place oozes historic enigma. People from all walks of life come here. This place has been filmed several times for documentary purposes too.
Well now time for cons!
Firstly the entrance is seriously uninspiring and uninviting making it an easy miss. Next it has no lifts and the staircase was constructed in olden days hence imaginably in an olden style with broad, thick and high stairs. That makes the climb arduous for little feet and wobbly feet too. Finally I don't like the restroom, period! It's simply malodorous.

The place may earn a lot of kudos for the history but not much laurels for the food. The hot coffee tastes good. Rest of the items in the menu are just ok. Not a very comfortable place to sit and dine. As the place is full of smoke (tobacco smoke of course) and there are only few ventilation points. Striking feature is that educated people still smoke in this public place oblivious of the government rule. More surprising is that the younger crowd takes pride in puffing out smoke at Indian Coffee House. I hope the Coffee House authorities could do something in this regard and atleast enforce the law.

Reminiscent of my University days. This place deserves a mention for the sheer display of "bangaliyanna" and the legacy that it carried over time. Food is not the reason for most of the visitors but the candid addas and long hours of chat session. I have had chicken cutlet and kobiraji. Didnt find it satisfactory. The coffee was ok. Only bonus perhaps is the long hours they would allow you to sit down without bothering.

Just love this place. Visited for many times whenever I have visited college street. A nostalgic place for typical friends #adda. Most of the times we have ordered Chicken cutlet or Kabiraji or fish fry. Also tried chicken hakka chowmin and chicken fried rice along with chilly chicken. If you judge on the basis of food then it is up to the mark, but the speciality of this place is the ambiance.

Ah! This place comes with a bag full of nostalgia! "Coffee house-er sei adda ta" aaj o achey, I bet. Have spent so many lazy evenings of my life here,gossiping and chatting with friends and strangers together. Their infusion coffee is a must must have. I add loads of sugar into it but still. That's a Hallmark of Indian coffee house. Try their fish afghani and chicken omelets. #nomnom. Don't drawn conclusions regarding this place by the way it looks, strictly. Ambience is what attracts us to this place. You get to meet some of the best minds and some super *aatels" there. Not to forget the life-size portrait of rabindranath! Go there and just breathe in the tradition, the nostalgia and everything that comes with it. It's one of a kind and how!
P.S. you can seat there for hours, nobody will say you anything. Just keep on ordering infusions at regular intervals. :-P

Even a review is less for this place. I prefer the nostalgia of the place more than the food, second obviously comes the food, it's cheap price, fantastic taste, the hot coffee and the amazing service that is provided. 
The place is just out of the box, no air-conditioned five star hotel can come close to this.

No matter how old i become..i always visit this place to know my roots my love for my city,its kindah my little time machine place where i can sit with my cha n recollect all those priceless memories amidst all the negativities that surround our city.

Must visit for all travellers who visit kolkata,its a legendary place if you want to see the real bong charm of kolkata,the addas,the laughters.

These are those priceless gems that you dont find in restaurants or hotels with its grandeour or modern ambiance. ^_^

I hope my review entices more ppl to visit this place more often

I don't really understand why this place is so popular. I guess this place was much better a generation ago. They really need to renovate. The ambience is okay.

I had chicken sandwich which was extremely dry for my taste. The Mutton Kabiraji is quite good. The Moghlai Paratha tastes good but it is extremely oily.

Food takes a while to be served. This is probably because this place is always swarming with people.

Ambience : 4/5

That basically sums it up.  The coffee house is a place to hang out with friends, chat, and have something to eat meanwhile. Not a place to go just to sit and eat. It is an iconic cafe as it was once renowned as a meeting place for poets, artistes, literati and people from the world of art and culture. However for food lovers it might not be a favorite dugout. I like their chicken omelette and the infusion which is basically black coffee. Smokers would be delighted to know the place has no smoking restrictions. The coffee house is a good place to jabber around with a bunch of friends over coffee but food is not one of its upsides.

It is one of the most oldest restaurants and coffee outlet in Kolkata. Hence whenever you get in there will find a smell of old kolkata. It is the best place for adda and timepassing with friends. Now coming to the dishes they serve most of the time you wont find your desired dish. If by chance you get that and order that it would take a lot of time to reach you. The quality of the food is okk not that special. But the most disappointing fact is that their cold coffee is very bad. Snacks like chicken pakora and kabiraji are bttr.

Historic place in Kolkata. I guess previously known as the Albert Hall where who's who of the country used to come and deliver speeches. Kolkata's very own coffee house. Place which knows no boundaries. A place where a film buff may be lucky enough to bump upon his favorite director or a passionate reader may meet the writer of favorite book. A place so cosmopolitan, so historic, filled in with memories. Old architecture surely going to talk you through a time journey. Right at the heart of books paradise... College Street...a hangout zone for youth to oldies. It has special place in the hearts of every Bengali...

Lovely food , good coffee and puff of your favorite brand makes this place the most happening hangout zone in the city. Fish fry, chicken kabiraji, chicken afgani needs special mention.

Dropped by here at this legendary hangout place after book hunt at college street. Got a table for 2, waiters wearing white uniform with turban took me by surprise since it ws my 1st visit here. Hall is huge with high ceiling n air from fan unable to reach the table hence use of stand fans, huge windows. Also caught a glimpse of the kicthen which again wasnt renovated. Lot of hustle bustle with chatter of people, smoke etc etc. Got down to ordering 2 cuppa coffee, chicken pakora, chicken sandwich and omelette. Food came soon, pakora was just usual in taste with chicken being in bones, batter being a lil thick, sandwich is normal chicken grated with cheese sandwich, omelette was another usual. I guess this place has more to do with nostalgia attached to being an adda for book lovers and avid book buyers, hence food quality or quantity is just kept at being pocket friendly for all ages.

In this ever-changing world, places like this serve as a time machine to take you back to a journey full of nostalgia. No extra decor, no special combo/discount offers, nothing fancy - and still this place gets a full house even in a busy weekday afternoon. Good old charm and the memories- these are the only things people keep coming back- and those scribbled names on the wall with dates saying they were here time and again is the proof (not encouraging the act though -_-).

However, coming to the food- it was really average. The cold coffee was watery and too sweet (Like the sugar they've used for one glass would have been more than enough for two glasses). The grilled fish came with salad, tomato and mustard sauce. According to my opinion it was a bit under-cooked, though better than the cold coffee experience.

Well, no complaint for service though, we got served pretty quickly considering the crowd at that time.

Coming to the pocket pinch, it's extremely pocket-friendly. Come on, where on earth can you get a grilled fish for INR 65?

While I really enjoy the 'some things never change' atmosphere they've maintained, a personal suggestion would be to look into the quality of food. From what I've seen, they're doing some good business, and people will keep coming back. So if they can increase INR 5/10/15/20 per plate and serve something better than this, more people will be interested in visiting again. I am fine with this no-fancy appearance, but not compromising my food.

Foods are delicious.
Environment is nostalgic, but it should be declared as No Smoking Zone.
Entrance is very nasty, unclean.
Seeing people smoking all over the place is not apposite to a cultural, intellectual rendezvous where Big guns like Manna De, Shyamal Mitra, etc. been once.

Coffee House is still alive today, I say,  only because of its heritage. Whatever you do please don't have a coffee at coffee house, its really bad and watery. 
The service is bad and the waiters will serve you only when they want. 
The only good items are the Mutton and Chicken Afghani. 
If you're looking to hangout with friends and chat for as you want, this is the place for you. Otherwise for food I would suggest Dilkhusha or Tasty Restaurant just a few steps away.

This place only survives because of nostalgia and the ambience it has. The moment you enter the place you'd absolutely feel like you've been taken back into the 90's era, where you would hear a lot hustle and bustle, creaking ceiling fans hanging, historic circular wooden tables, basic white tubelights, if you are keen enough you will also notice the old black switch boards on the walls. There is nothing great about the food, neither the waiters are attentive. The service is slow, very slow! Finding a vacant table is hard during the evening hours. The place allows smoking and thus can be a bit uncomfortable for non smokers like me.

We had ordered 3 plates of mutton hakka noodles for 4 of us, the quantity was okay but the noodles were cold and stiff. It had no salt and was tasting like noodles boiled in plain water. After finishing with the noodles we ordered 2 cups of Infusion which is a form of Black coffee they serve. And this thing which actually tasted good after it had cooled down a bit was served HOT! :D

All in all if you are in Calcutta and want to tick off the right places, I suggest you can give a visit to this place considering the prices are cheap and won't burn a hole in your pocket.

But as the song says "Coffee house er shei adda ta aj aar nei, aj ar nei" true. The place has lost it's charm. The place requires more maintenance and I hope they preserve this place as a heritage and bring back the quality of food :)

Your reaction to this place depends upon the category you fall in:

1. Born in Kolkata, brought up on College Street :- a nostalgic homecoming induced orgasm that tends to not understand that others dont give a damn to your stories.

2. Havent been to ICH ever but read about it:- old world charm that you feel nice thinking of while you sip that 15 buck coffee in the cups and plates of yesteryears. Transported to your college life by the infectious energy of the students addamaaring there. Lovely experience.

3. A friend of category 1 above dragged to ICH every fortnight:- dirty, stinky place with the rudest, most inefficient waiters but cheap slightly below average food and coffee.

A must visit but strictly infrequently.

আড্ডা আর মান্না দের গানের ক্ষেত্রভূমি.
ভাল খাবার বা কফি কোনটাই আশা করা উচিত নয়
  যেটা পাওয়া যেতে পারে তা হল খানিক ভাল সময় আর নস্টালজিয়ার অনুদান.কলেজ স্ট্রীটে হাতে বেকার সময় থাকলে অবশ্যই ঘুরে আশা উচিত.

Ambience is good, with a nostalgic look and feel.
For a restaurant calling itself as "Coffee House", the coffee is totally junk. Tastes like someone dipped a paintbrush into hot water.

Waiters are rude, asking us to leave immediately once we finished our Coffee.

Overhyped, not coming back again.

Indian coffee house is under the category of Legendary . Great place for hangouts. This place is not famous for Food or good decor but it is famous for " bong special adda". Nostalgic place. Taste of Coffee was not good & chicken fry was so not cooked properly. But This place is very Pocket Friendly . 
Service:  very slow
Ambience:  Good 
Taste:  Average 
Cost:  excellent ( cheapest )

The main thing about the indian coffee house is the ambiance. Though I am from Calcutta university I am a frequent visitor of coffee house. The infusion is the coffee house special. Apart from it chicken sandwich is also very light and good. Hakka chowmin( veg/ non veg) are also tasty..

I went here because of the legacy.... Manna Dey's famous song "Coffe houser adda"...
It is perhaps the only Institution in India where Public smoking is allowed and the number of female smokers is more than the number of male smokers....
One thing I really appreciated was that majority of the waiters are handicapped, I appreciate this initiative to give employment to physically challenged....
Service is slow and often gets mixed up....
Try the chowmien and the chicken cutlet.....
Budget friendly.....

The Indian Coffee House survives because of nostalgia, because of the Bangali's need for cha and adda, because of our longing for history. The food is disappointing (barring perhaps the kabiraji and cutlet), the beverages are average, the service is poor. Yet, Coffee House'er adda will live as long as College Street lives.

Ambience: Awesome, You'll feel like having coffee in an old museum with extraordinary interiors. Rare for modern day cafés.
Place: Made for Students and adda-baazi, speak as loud as you can, smoke, chill out and  do whatever you want to do with groups of students all around.
Location: Perfect, The book stalls of College street and Colleges all around makes it a preferable place for such a magnificent cafe.
Hospitality: ROFL, Don't expect waiters to come to you rather you've to ask them to write down the orders. At every reorder and no tip expect a inaudible murmuring from them :p.
Food quality: Nice and reasonable, There menu is not versatile, still whatever there in menu is served Good and quick.

So it is regular place to hav the adda..I've tried almost everything here..the only food which gave me taste was chicken afgani.. but the others failed. The coffee tastes like horlicks... the chicken sandwich is plain bread n chicken combination wid no spices..I can make onion pakora even better. But actually when u talk about this place, its nt d food.. its d memories which bring me a smile..

Coffee House is no longer what it used to be originally. The waiters have gone rouge and rude, the tables are not cleaned properly and most importantly the quality of food has dropped by manifolds. But still, if you are visiting Calcutta and are in a mood to 'tick' off the quintessential places to eat, then a customary visit is in order. The Moghlai porota, the chicken/mutton cutlets, fish fingers and some coffee hot/cold should help you achieve your goal.

A historic place indeed. Its very crowded mostly by college students & office goers. Their Mutton Kaviraji, Veg Cutlet, Mutton Cutlet & Chicken Omelette are quite descent. I personally prefer their cold coffee & cream. The place is full of hustle & bustle & as they allow smoking it is sometimes quite uncomfortable for the non smokers. The quality of the food has decreased in recent times.

This place is a testimonial to the word LEGENDARY. Bengali culture is quite synonymous to this place. Reason,  most of the stalwarts that this city has produced has visited this place with their friends to discuss philosophy, life, politics over cups of infusion and a cigarette. My rating solely goes for the nostalgia this place echoes of and the old school feeling that this olace evokes in your heart. The food is not much to be spoken about, most of them tastes bland. The infusion is the must here. Although there are NO SMOKING signs pasted on the walls, you can smoke as much as you can. The behavious of the wauters is something to see. They put on the air of someone who is not serving you, rather you should be serving them. Cheeky bas****s they are. But one or two of them are well mannered and if you are served by them you will feel contended. Must visit for every kolkatan and every tourist who visits this city. Am proud to call this place my second home. Oh yes, tipping is a must. Otherwise be prepared to hear some under the breathe curses from the waiters who intentionally fail to make them inaudible. Funny place.

One can see why the place is so popular with the college kids here. It has cheap food and coffee and a large area for seating. Of course, being Kolkata you can smoke with total abandon inside the cafe. And the din of the place makes sure your discussions and arguments at the table stay private. But that's about it. The food and the coffee is below average. The cold coffee will make you kill yourself. And the waiters are totally apathetic. Visit the place only if you're in the locality.

It has a special place in my heart for all the time spent with friends during our college days, whether be it a birthday or a successful proposal to a girl or just to kill the time between classes, coffee house was our place to be. Still remember having the onion pakoras along with infusion cost us only 14bucks. The food is not special neither is the service but its the whole ambience with buzz of the students putting forth their thoughts, debating or discussing studies,politics etc or jamming along with their guitars or the septuagenatarian people meeting to relive their gone by days...it had its own charm. U can try any food there, but it all tastes awesome due to its nostalgic vibrance.

This is one of the most iconic places of Kolkata. The cultural importance it has is beyond that if an ordinary restaurant. Anyone visiting can immediately see that in the crowd gathered there and the atmosphere of the place. 99% of the ppl are here not for the food but for addas and discussions. Iv visited this place many times, mostly on Sunday mornings. Most of the ppl here on such days are philosophers, writers and that category if intellectuals. They have discussions, read newspapers and the least important thing is the food ! Overall the place is grandeous, gives u a feeling of pride , all this not due to  the food/ service or anything. 
Pros :
1. The atmosphere n the grandeur of the place.
2. The kind of ppl you get to meet here is just an experience. The conversations u strike up.
3. Locating this place ain't a prob. It is iconic.
4. Perfect for photography. Essence of Kolkata in one shot
Cons :
1. Food/ beverages - way below average
2. Service - bad
3. That horrific annoying bell that rings in between.
Must try items :
Chicken/ mutton kabiraji, cold coffee with ice cream, mughlai paratta

A cult restaurant of Kolkata where people go only for the ambiance. The place has a rustic look because of poorly maintained  premisses and dilapidated infrastructure which surprisingly attracts people.
Place is like a smoke house as smoking is allowed and your eyes would start burning after few minutes. Here you get Pathetic oily food and hot  beverages looking like mud water from a puddle. Service is horrible as staff are very very rude and  they treat you like dirt ,which seems to be the norm and supposedly adds to its rustic feel (as the localities claim  ).  And not to forget that most of the dishes from the menu are never ever served.

This place has been on my list for long and finally i did get a chance to be there. Little difficult to locate but everyone knows whr it is so wont be an issue. Has 2 seatings, one overlooking the other like a balcony. Truly takes you back a century into the history of Kolkata.
Even with all the history it is still damn cheap. Had the chicken sandwich (soft, fresh and yummy) and the mutton cultlet and chicken kabirazi (must trys) along with cold coffee. The complete pinch on the pocket, only Rs220/- which is awesome by todays standards.
You will find Kolkata's college n intellectual crowd in the perfect adda here. Smoking is allowed hence anyone who doesnt smoke may feel a little out of place here but its bearable and definately worth multiple visits. Go ahead, visit n enjoy

If you are finding good food or classy ambience then this is not the place but you are up for a great 'adda' with pals then this is the ultimate place. With a cup of Infusion start your gossips or adda or whatever you want to do. This is the favourite place for the students specially the college goers. It is alwyas packed in the evening. As a student I am a regular visitor of this place with my friends whether it's 9 a.m. or 6 p.m. There is no limitation of time...seat there as long as you want. The ambience is great for chatting. The view is great from the second floor but there they charge a little higher price than the first floor.

Besides the nostalgia which sets in when you step inside the coffee house, the place also reminds one about the endless chat over cups of coffee. The quality of snacks has deteriotated over the time and the service should be enhanced given the history and the reputation of the place. The cold coffee, pakora and kabiraji are the regular choices for me. Getting a seat is difficult here as it remains crowded all the time. But once settled, one is bound to have a good time with or without the food.

If u r in college street nd not paying coffee house a visit just fr its coffee nd adda spot, u surely r missing smthng.       now let me reconstruct my own words... If u r in college street nd u r hungry, nd u visit coffee house fr food. Simply NO NO!!! About turn nd move on. 
I do still visit this place fr its heritage, infusion, smoke nd adda. 
Don't even think of having food frm here its horrible. Restrict urselfs upto coffee nd pakoras or sandwiches. Oh yes pls stick to hot coffee or infusion, a big no to cold coffee as well. 
This place is considered to be a adda spot... Bt not now... If u r finished with ur 1st cup the waiters wld knock u again nd again to know whtr uvr done or not. Nd yes the waiters r really rude I don't know y.. Nd don't even ask fr extra ketchup.. Its a tabboo thr... Once u ask they stop serving u even water (joking) bt seriously they give a heinous looks as if u have committed a crime.  Most of the items are unavailable frm menu nd don't even expect a mark of regret frm the waiters, u r lucky they r serving u atlst.
In short the rich history nd heritage is still working fr them in this competitive market otherwise its not worth a visit at all.

Reminds me of Manna De's "Coffee houser adda" every single time I step into this mecca of adda. Though the coffee isn't something to crave for but yes do try the fish kabiraji and chicken afgani.

The coffee is not so good,  though I always have this Infusion which is a black coffee. The mutton cuttlet and the chicken sandwich is a must try.

An adda zone it is.
With coffee and finger food it is the perfect place for discussing important and not-so-important things with anyone and everyone.
The hot coffee is a must with some other finger food if your hunger pangs are too much. Cutlets and Kavirajis are good, so are the pakoras. Avoid the sandwiches if you can and also with the cold coffee.
And last thing, please don't complain about punctuality.. It's coffee house and time flows very slowly here.

ICH gained its repute n popularity due to the patronage of eminent personalities of 1970s. Coffee House served quality good in those days.

However, today, ICH, College Street is marked with;-

1. Horrible interior- Upgradation of interiors were required long back but da management doesnt care and shuns da idea on pretext of maintaining heritage.

2. Poor service- ICH is marked with poorest quality of service and rude behavior of the bearers/ waiters. Their attitude has defeated employees of govt run hotels / restaurant.

3. Poor food quality- None of the food item commensurates the brand name. 

Hence- 

Food Quality-2/5
Service- 0/5
Ambience- 1/5


Highly not recommended... !!!

This place right now is just running because of the history associated with it..the food quality here is just average or may be below average in case of few items but their price is very much on the higher side.
Speaking of the coffee of this place I have never been very fond of the coffee.(I feel we can make better coffee than this place on our own)..But still a good place to hang out with your friends though it remains crowded most of the time and you need to wait a little to get seats.

This is one of the oldest cafeterias of the city, standing tall since the British rule. This place is synonymous with 'adda' and is not the place to be if amazing food is what your expectation is. The culture of the old Calcutta still shines through each brick and inch of the place from the old painting of Rabindranath Tagore hanging on the wall to the old murals to the traditional dresses of the waiters. People often grumble about cleanliness of the place but considering the size of the place, it isn't the worst that you'd get to see.   
The best thing about the place is you can have endless addas and gossips without the fear of being thrown out of the place after an hour or so. 
The worst thing is, since they accomodate a lot of people at the same time, they keep uncovered water in glasses and place them next to the counter in the balcony area and the same water is served to the people.
Food is simple and ordinary. Prices are low and no vat charges are included. Mutton cutlet is one of their best snack items. Chicken sandwiches are bland and parched. Cold coffee with or without the cream is not the most brewed but still manages to taste well nonetheless and is my personal favourite. 
Ambience is good if you can soak in the atmosphere of gossiping amid thousands,otherwise you may find it utterly disappointing. 
Like it or not, this place surely cannot be ignored.

I still remember my first day in the university. After the marathon of classes, we got a breather and together we went to the legendary Coffee House.
This is the place where my parents, my uncles and aunts have spent their slices of student time, and I was thrilled to enter its premises.
The first floor was jam packed so we went to the second floor. We ordered cold coffee and pakoras. We did not care about food, though. Gossiping was more important. 
Later during my tenure in the university, I went there several times with my friends. Little by little we came to know of its details. We came to learn that second floor is less crowded than the first floor. We came to learn that cold coffee with ice cream tastes better than plain cold coffee. It is from here that I developed my love for cold coffee. We also realised that boneless chicken pakora tastes much better than plain pakora. We learnt to be patient for the overworked waiters to bring us food.
Lots of memories are there. So many hilarious moments, moments of serious discussion, giving farewell to my then best friend and missing of a heartbeat or two flood the memory while thinking of Indian Coffee House.
In the later stage of my life, I went there twice, once with my mother and another time with my colleagues. With colleagues it was like back to university days, singing, joking etc. together with food. Like in old days, the quality of food was of least importance. It was the company that counted. It was bindass. With mother however, it was different, like visiting a proper restaurant. With her by my side,it was for the first time that I noticed that the pakoras are too small and the coffee too sugary. She also lamented that the pakoras in her days were larger. 
Anyway, if I get a chance to visit it together with my friends, I would do it.

You just do not review legends, and this place is one for sure! Got the old Calcutta feel in its every brick. Right from the waiters' attire, to the menu, to the ambiance- everything gives you a feeling of being a 'bangali'. A perfect place for adda while having snacks like the kabiraji or the cutlets which are rather nice here. To be very honest, the food is not top notch. But then, that is not why you come here. Come here to sit back, smoke a cig, drink a cup of coffee and have an adda session- be it before college, after or during (yes, we all bunk!). This place is a must visit for every bengali who has ever hummed the tunes of the great Manna De classic. 
Coffee house er shei adda kono din chole jabe na. Kolkata-bashi jete debe na. :)

Who am I to review this legend? I do not care how well my coffee is brewed or how well my cutlet meat is cooked... I only care that I had them with my dearest friends, at a place as legendary as the Indian Coffee House! It is just another dimension of existence... With all the deep intellectual conversation going around, your coffee and cutlet just becomes something else. You just can't help but reflect on every piece history that is associated with this place. It is the Mecca for every addabaaj that lives. Finally to the lesser important things, feel free to try the cutlets and kabirajis along with your coffee (conservatives can go for the quintessential Peyanji). Coffee Houser adda ta aaj o aache, chiro kaal thakbe...

So, this place doesn't need much introduction. I would say, it is surely going to disappoint you if you haven't been there even for once and you're expecting too much out of it. Located in the heart of College street/Boipara. This place is famous among the college students and the retired, precisely . I have been there many times but never been really contended with the service. Service is very slow. Quality of food is moderate. I had hot coffee( it's really not a good one), cold coffee, cream coffee, lemon tea in tea and coffee. Besides, I had mixed chowmein in chinese with small egg and chicken pieces in them and non fried cabbage leaves and other veggies hidden in them. The good one that I've had there is the chicken sandwich with extra cheese with tomato and chilli sauce. Ambience is good. That's it!

"Coffee houser shei addata aaj ar nei....aaj ar nei...". Everytime I see this place this song gets stuck in that silly part of my brain! Was a place I used to frequent during the years I went swimming at the YMCA club. Rs. 3 plate of "peyaji" (onion pakoras) and cold coffee. The dressed up waiters with the decorative turbans and the crowded floors inside once you take the incredibly inconspicuous entry or the stairs into the large floor. I suppose the prices I mentioned sound like a joke now but it isn't really an expensive affair to have something there even now. Want class? Not the place. Want okay food at lower than usual prices and a round about lesson in the famed Bengali "adda"? ......still the place. Definitely recommend it.

Coming to Kolkata for the first time , I had heard a lot about ICH. The colonial aura filled with intellectuals , college students and smokers was expected. I was extremely disappointed by the service. It took the guy 20 minutes to come take an order. He was extremely rude and grumpy. We had ordered 3 cold coffees and an onion pakora plate to satiate our stomachs in the humid evening heat of Kolkata. Calling it coffee would be a huge blunder. Forget being frothy , it tasted more like Irani chai with coffee sugar. The onion pakoras were another disaster. They neither had the indigenous taste nor were fried properly. The coffee house was badly maintained with a peculiar smell surrounding it. The irony was that there was a board of NO SMOKING put all amongst the chain smokers!! To sum it up , an avoidable experience!

This place is in itself a heritage.......student politics, debates, discussions all seem to make this place very ambient. Its been only a year that i have become a student of Presidency, yet i somehow manage to visit this place at least 4 times in a week... As for the food its good, although service maybe a bit slow. Kabiraji, afghani cutlet etc. are its speciality. If u ever come to college street pls give it a visit. The atmosphere is nostalgic!!! (made me remember that Manna Dey song :) ) ...

Not a place if you want to have some luxurious food to celebrate some event in an extravaganzas way ... Coffee House is the heritage place of the Thinking Man and Woman. It's not a place where you go to have food but where you go to feel the old Calcutta flowing with the new Kolkata. It is where you just sit with your friends on a lazy afternoon, relax, get emersed in some old memories and plan to create some new ones . 
Technically, the location is excellent for those who know the place and a bit difficult to find out for the new people. The service is very slow, but that's how people likes it and expects it to be. Food quality is good enough and pocket-friendly as many college students come here. So don't visit here if you want to fill your tummy in hurry. The best part of the place is its ambience...
If you are a bong but haven't visited Coffee House yet, well, this might be good time to take a sip of coffee...

I have been to this place many times before,but today was a bit different because I went with college buddies whom I met after 4yrs. We waited for an hour as on Sundays the joint opens at 5pm. The waiters were a bit rude,but then that's how they have always been here. The food wasn't too great as such,it is always about the charm n ambience of the place. Chicken Kabiraji was good!

One of the most iconic spots of the city, this place is known more for its history and heritage than its food. However, it is still thronged by students of the colleges in the vicinity and book shoppers, besides the veterans. A smoker's haven, this place, noisy and boisterous as it may be, is perfect for a "bengali adda". The food overall, to put it subtlety, is appalling, though they do serve fine Cutlets and Kavirajis. Visit this place for the people, the culture, the milieu and reminiscences of old Calcutta.

The ideal place to visit if you're looking for a taste of the rich culture and heritage of the yesteryears.. trying to soak in the history dropping from every nook and cranny of this place. But definitely not a good place for having some quality food. Awful service (we practically had to beg to get our order after 30 minutes or so) coupled with below average food will leave you utterly dissatisfied. The cutlet is a saving grace though. Not worth a second visit certainly.. not for the food or coffee anyway.

I was a student of Hindu school, so Coffee house is just opposite from my classrooms. When I and my school friends were very young, we decide that our first get together will arrange in Coffee house. I can not remember how many times I visited here, The only rules follow here that is, you should take any items like tea, coffee and no one ask you to leave the table for at least one hour. The coffee and fish fry which is common in all bills. The waiters are really good if you give him some good tips. I love to visit at there more and more times.

As a bengali, u r bound to feel nostalgic in this place but the only safe thing to order there is their infusion(black coffee). If u r feeling adventurous u can try the other "items" in their menu but u r going to be utterly disappointed given that the waiters can actually cut out time from their busy life to take your order. I give 2.4 for its heritage and value and 0.1 for their high quality and attendance of staff.

As a reviewer, I'd think of Coffee House more as a part of kolkata and it's history rather than a cafe.
The large windows, the table and chairs, the waiters, the ambiance speaks of the old kolkatan charm.
You come in groups, spend countless minutes chatting away over cups of coffee or plates of onion pakodas, or make new friends, or just puff away your blues.
As there's no personalized seating, you will see others coming and eating and drinking coffee with you, some might find it uncomfortable.
The coffee is not that good, the pakodas oily, the cutlet barely enjoyable, the moglai not tear-able, the waiters really laid back and rude.
But people never visit coffee house for great food, for them it's a place where you go on having "adda" and for some, an item in the bucket list.
If seeing and experiencing the old kolkata's charm is on one's mind, coffee house will surely fulfill that.
If having food and coffee is on one's mind, just skip the place, ride a bus to park street and have your time in one of the cafes out there.

No matter what I write here, I am sure, people will continue visiting Indian Coffee House for its heritage tag and the "Coffee House Adda" experience :D

Their hot coffee with cream is great and so are the fried items. During my Presidency days, I used to have their baked fish. In a word, delightful! Sadly they have stopped making it.

If this is your first time, then do try the hot coffee with cream, cutlets and sandwiches. The mutton sandwich in particular.

The waiters may appear a little rude and snobbish at times (perhaps 'cos they're overworked). Also, don't be surprised when no-one comes around to take your order for thirty minutes after you are seated. In fact, getting a seat may take you thirty minutes during peak hours!

One of the heritage places of Kolkata to have a cup of tea or coffee and some snacks and spend hours chatting with your friends. And its history speaks for itself. 
But somehow its lagging behind in the race of cafes.
Its true that people still prefer to queue there everyday,but one thing is for sure, the service has degraded from before. Also you dont get enough value for money.

One of the most famous places in Kolkata. Almost a heritage site with old people still discussing politics and famous Kolkatans coming every now and then for interviews and reminiscing. 
But if you consider it as just a place to go and have food in,I would say its one of the worst,at least now.
The worst thing about coffee house is the coffee,  and I never  really get why.The prices have been hiked but are not too much.The quantity they serve is filling.The onion pakora is good but should be less oily.The chicken and mutton cutlets are okay but huge.The chicken sandwich is disappointing and the one thing you must never have is the chicken omelet,its completely tasteless and heavily fried and oily.
The noodles served though is not bad.
The other problem is the management,I don't know why they don't put in some effort to keep up the reputation of the place.I have been going to Presidency University for 3 years and this place just doesn't change.The washroom stinks and you get the smell from far.People get in and start smoking right under the no smoking sign and are never rebuked.The staff though old (in age) are very efficient (maybe for that very reason)but look sullen.They have huge space . .two floors. .and the upper one is never fully open though there are people waiting to get in.I think with better management and some conscious effort this place can be and should be improved.We have a song on it for God's sake.

Indian Coffee House, one of the legendary place of Calcutta, situated in College Street, has to be visited, for the sheer historicity and the vibe of the place that still reeks of the old-world charm, giving an envious imagination of what our previous generations might have had a treat of. In the present, the dishes are a bit over-priced in comparison to its quality and taste & the time they take for the orders to be delivered... Oh boy! I've had some sandwiches and they were not that great. Just good enough to salvage.
But then, a visit is recommended if you wanna be a part of a bygone history.

So the historical place of Kolkata has it's own significance & glory. But in recent times the service of coffee house is really poor. The quality of the foods is an issue & the behaviour of staffs is not at all good. Case in point- smoking is not allowed in the upstairs from the inception when I had started going there but what I find is the college guys are free to do smoking in the same restricted place. If u have not give any order & wanted to seat & spend your time their, you will face the rude behaviour of the staffs. 

I had ordered chicken sandwiches which were cold & there were merely chicken pieces available in it. The cold coffee is average & the kabiraji was too oily & no hint of chicken on it. 

But it's a place where we can spend time even giving away any order for hours & it has some historical values & memories attached with almost each of us who used to visit in College Street areas in their student life.. That's why I'm giving it a 3.0 rating.

When it comes to Indian Coffee House, this place needs no introduction or explanation. This place is more about adda, hearty smokes, heated discussions and most importantly,nostalgia. The waiters still adorn the age old white traditional uniforms and hear turbans. Located in heart of College Street, Indian Coffee House is flocked in numbers by students of the surrounding educational institutions in the area. I won't suggest this place for food or coffee either but if you want to soak your soul in the typical unmatched Bengali intellect, you will find no better place.

The name speaks for itself. Coffee house has been the arena for intellectual gossips and debates since times immemorial... Give the place a visit basically for the rich history and legacy it has carried for so long. Food might not be as good as expected but certain dishes like chicken cutlet, kabiraji, afgani and mutton cutlets would definitely won't let you down. Stay away from the coffees but if you are into black coffee then go for infusion. Servicing is indeed horrible. You just can't get the waiters to take your order quickly.

Every time I am in College Street, I feel like getting pulled towards it. Walking into the Coffee House feel like living in those 80's. The look, the feel still gives me goosebumps. The get-up of the waiters working there have a touch of tradition in itself. There is a touch of elegance in everything around. I forget about everything else after I reach this place. And every time I visit here, I make sure to have a cup of coffee at first and it sets on the mood! If you are in College Street for books, I would recommend you to hop in atleast once everytime you come here.

"Adda ta akhon o ache" in this heritage restaurant. It is very popular restaurant in Kolkata. Restaurant is very big but it's hard to find table because it is always full. Balcony view is nice.

This place is still in the talks only because of its heritage and nothing else. Coffee house- the name itself is not valid now as the quality of coffee served here is nothing better than a roadside tea stall. The other food items are equally oily and bad. We ordered onion pakora, coffee, fish kabiraji, mughlai, chicken omlette and mutton.sandwich.
Lets come to individual reviews..
As i have said earlier, coffee was utterly disgusting. They said cream coffee. Didn't find a single trace of cream in it
Onion pakora- very little onion and loads of besan, absolutely no taste
Fish kabiraji- this is the only good item i ate that day. Though the fish was bombay bhetki and not the real one, the taste was nice and decent though a bit extra oily
Mughlai- didnt taste much but was too oily
Chicken omlette- this dish was also kind of decent
Mutton sandwich- boiled mutton( still not full boiled) between two slices of bread. The look was itself not appealing. The mutton was not properly boiled and so had a typical smell. 

The ambience is still the old one with an old calcutta flavour to it. If this place makes its food a little better, we foodies can count it as one of our favourite eateries.

The perfect place to be if u want a fill within a budget! An experience of a lifetime! :) one of the most nostalgic places to visit in Calcutta! 
The coffee is out of this world! Hot or cold! Whatever may it be! And the sandwiches are equally amazing! 
And the kaviraji's will leave u speechless! :)
The foodie's paradise!

The thirst for quintessential Bengali's Cha-Cigarette & Adda is fulfilled over  here. This is a cult place and has witnessed the birth of Political Revolutions, Oscar Winning Cinematographs and what not. From Ray to Ghatak, Buddhababu to Momota,this place creates a concoction that has managed to spellbound Calcuttans since timeless eternity.

Ambience- The ambience has never changed since its establishment.Wooden Chairs and large hanging fans accentuates the rustic 'parar dokan-parar dokan' atmosphere.

Service- Extremely laid back and the waiters make sure they don't disturb your "adda".Wait for an hour until the Kobiraji reaches your table.
Food- The coffee was definitely better 3 years ago when I last visited this place.Now it is way more diluted.However it still continues to maintain the aroma of the freshly roasted Coffee and the brewed coffee is quite strong.

Definitely a place you should visit to understand the lifestyle of a Bengali and how "lyadkhor" we can be.Also the rustic ambience of this place can attract any die hard lover of Calcutta. However beware of the wannabes flaunting their first puff and engrossed in their quest to click a candid photograph out of it.

The most iconic cafe of Kolkata, this place, needs no introduction. This isn't the place you go to simply drink some coffee or hangout. This is the place where you discuss ideas and make your grey cells run into overdrive. And while at it keep them sharp with their signature infusion which is a brew of coffee and tea, or their black coffee, coffee or tea. (Note: Don't go for the cold coffee). The food here is average to say the least and the service is slightly slow. But the staff here is honest and once when we mistakenly left a wallet, they kept it safe and returned it to us when we came back looking.

This place is constantly buzzing with noise of chatter and an odd outrage. Any talk here turns into a discussion. This place is to be visited for its people and the collective nostalgia for the old Calcutta.

This place is one which cannot be rated solely on the basis of the food served. You walk up a winding staircase on the ever busy College Street, and boy-oh-boy, what greets one is something out of the 19th Century. The ambience of this place is amazing, with nostalgia and times of the years before written all over it. One can't help but sit and reminisce the Bengali movies set in the 19th and early 20th centuries when you are here and waiting for your Mutton/Fish Kaviraji, which is a delight. Barring the Kaviraji, I am told that the food is average, but as I can't emphasise enough, this place is more than the food and the service offered. A place stuck in a timeless epoch, Coffee House is all what the city of Kolkata is, explained succinctly within two floors of wood, smoke and shy glances.

ICH defines Calcutta. It signifies the fact that Calcuttans can take it easy in their life without really getting worked up in the intricacies of life.
A visit to the famous college street isn't complete unless you slip into ICH,for an infusion, cutlet and adda, and Hell yeah these addas have defined this place, ranging from revolutionary expressions, matters of political importance to sweet nothings,it provides one and all with an uniform platform. 
The place has marginally improved over the years although service can be shoddy occasionally,but then ICH IS NOT A CCD. You pay for The lackdaisical atmosphere.
Sit Back, enjoy an infusion, adda,and take time to soak in history when you visit ICH

This  place is about heritage,students, politics,nostalgia etc.To pass time with colleagues or with your loved one's that too in a pocket friendly cafe in kolkata is none other than Indian Coffee House. It's a place where all age group people's meet together,chat,have coffee and make alot discussions. Famous Personality's are often used to come in this place. Though it's written "Smoking is Prohibited " but yet smoking is allowed.
Black coffee is famous for its taste in Coffee House and it's known as Infusion which is available just @10. Also cold coffee is available at cheap rates.

Had this place been in some other part of the world, they would have understood the value of it and preserved that too by continuing on and building on the legacy. But, this being Kolkata, I guess its too much to ask for. In the name of being the cultural capital, it has really come a long way in de-culturing itself. The people of this famous city just keep pushing culture to the background still claiming to be cultural capital. 

The attittude of the waiters...if they do want to be called that....is like they really want you to wait. :P Nothing on the menu is ever available or dished out from he kitchen. The battered pages of the menu with half-torn laminations should make it to the Calcutta mesuem. The tables are still a century old (which I love) but unmaintained. The food is ....well...not human food....even dogs would turn back on it...The ambience ...well...is there any left of it? 

A board displays Smoking there is an offence and declares the cafe to be a non smoking zone whereas people blindly take out their cigarettes(and even bidis) like they are Kurt Cobain or Netaji contemplating on the country's future :P I would not be surprised if they started snorting marijuana or cocaine some fine day. The only positive aspect is a fresh coat of paint that makes it look whiter than it was ...say a decade ago...and the balcony seating (without the food) with the windows open...Transports you back to the british days...

There is also an Irani cafe in mumbai that is similar to this place and I believe that the government should actually take care of these heritage spots.  Maybe the UNESCO can help them. But these places should be treated well. They were the ones standing up when the rest were asleep. 

Only marks for the fresh coat of paint and the white plates(at least they are washed well :)) and the waiters' uniform...still a 100 years old stuff...Unless the government takes care of these places...they would run like the present times and hence its definitely not recommended. No wonder no foreigners flock this historically rich place whereas Indians still flock the Ritz for the aura.

The historical significance of this place makes you overlook the service, the sorry excuse for food and the really terrible coffee. Ironic since it's a coffee house. Just soak in the ambience and sit on one of the tables and try to imagine the Indian Freedom struggle being discussed on that very same table several decades ago.

The place holds history within its closed atmosphere and reveals with every painting on the wall to the delicate structure, the balcony seating and a big painting of Rabindranath Tagore, waiters in their classic attire with turbans keeping intact the earlier method and weaving everything into a classic experience.

What you can expect from this place is traditional bengali fast food along with the coffee or tea, whatever suits you the best.

Along with that you may also try some light dishes where in you can also light a smoke along and enjoy the ambience where everything is moving with a snail slow speed.

A great experience altogether !

 But for me it's the sheer nostalgia of that generation of Kolkata which I could not see. The ambiance is just out of the world.

Not only the brewing Coffee but also the chicken omlet,Mutton Kabiraji, Chicken Afghani and Mixed fried rice make it Awesome.....

This is the cafe where you can chat for 2 – 3 hours, this cafe is the place of ‘adda’ for bengalis as well as by the people of out side bengal.
You will found many common food items which you can be found easily in the road side food stalls. like cutlet, kabiraji,
sandwich, chowmin, samosa, moglai parota etc. and the main attraction their is Tea / Coffee with pakora ( onion ).
One must go their and have that item. ☺

This place is for what we Bengali's call NIRBHEJAL-ADDA!!! A great place to hang out with friends over a cup of tea or coffee, Bengali style with cigarettes on the counter....having discussions ranging from local politics to ones love life to real intellectual stuffs!!!

Food: 4/10
Ambience: this is for which you come here!!! Just for the ambience of the place!!! :)

People crave over this place a lot for its history, the heritage etc, but in terms of quality, Coffee House is one of the worst coffee joints. The cold coffee with ice cream exactly tastes like toothpaste, the black coffee is too bitter whereas the others just cannot be finished when ordered only one cup. Otherwise, their chicken sandwich is good. Once, we ordered for baked fish and it had a stinky smell in it. You shouldn't visit coffee house for its food, but visit the place for its heritage. Once famous as the Albert Hall, it has housed some of the most famous congresses of the country. Once you enter the place, the ambience, the nostalgia will take you back to the glorious ages of students' movements of Bengal. And the College Street branch of Indian Coffee House have given birth to many of them. Not only this, it was one the centre of practicing the intelligentsia of Bengal's art and culture for ages. To enlighten yourself about the centre of Bengal's culture, Coffee House is a must visit for you. But remember, this should be a part of your heritage tour, not a culinary visit. And beware of the tremendous misbehavior of their waitors, because they are government employees and they have to show their true colours.

Coffee House at College Street needs no introduction. Manna De made Coffee House immortal in every Bong heart with his timeless "Coffee House er shei addata aj r nei" . Coffee House holds a very special place as the boiling pot of Bengali culture , heritage ; the crucible for artistic and literary creations, for decades proving to be the perfect rendezvous for the great Calcutta intelligentsia. Sheer history as you walk into the Raj style Hallroom and it's extensive sitting arrangement, the balcony seats being my favorite choice. The huge portrait of Rabindranath Tagore hangs right across the wall and stands like a colossus , guarding the root of the creed , once known for it's progressive thoughts and revolutionary ideas. 

Coming to the food and beverage : Their Kaviraji cutlets are to die for and the coffee is excellent. The prices are very reasonable. 

Having said all these things, I would still stay away from giving it a perfect 5, as the lack of renovation is too obvious... and the staff have to be more courteous .. maybe they are under-paid !! 

All in all you have to experience Coffee House... you just don't 'go' there.

Visit Indian Coffee House for the nostalgia.

Visit it for the retro feel that you're gonna feel right when you enter through the doors.

Visit the place just to sit at one corner and observe people of different ages engrossed in their adda sessions with a cup of coffee on their tables.

Indian Coffee House is one of those rare eateries in Kolkata which has hardly gone through any modernization ever since it was built. So there is that ethnic old Bong feel you'll get to experience. Every time I went there, Coffee House didn't fail to awe me..be it a light meal after book shopping at College Street, or a re-union with an old friend or just a lazy adda session in the evenings. 

All the variants of the coffee are good enough; the Mughlai Paratha is tasty; the chicken sandwich is okay and the cutlets are fine, all of which are pocket-friendly.

The song " Coffee House-r sei adda-ta..." by prolific yester year singer Manna De testifies to the historic greatness of this place.

A must go venue for visitors in the city ! :)

If you are going to this place for the food or the coffee and rating it on that basis then you have got everything wrong in your head..... I love going there and sitting there with a watery coffee or an equally watery cold coffee (at one tenth the process of a ccd) and smoking... Rules don't apply at India coffee house... It's always been the coffee house of the artists, academics, rebels to the system... Go there to see friends... With over hundred tables you will be lucky to get a place... Ask a person and share his table.. They will allow you unless he is being joined by others and then chat with you like an old friend...
I can go on and on about coffee house... But you just visit the place... Try the mutton kabiraji or any chicken cutlets.... And remember the song... Coffee house er adda ta aar nei...."

It's unwise to review Coffee House as a restaurant or cafe or any such entity. It is, primarily, an experience. It's a slice of history, a relic that connects us to past Kolkatas. Another reason why Coffee House shouldn't be reviewed in terms of its food is because mostly the food is shit. The Afghani cutlet is good, the chowmein is edible only if you order the gravy one (the dry one will choke you), the sandwiches are decent to go with your coffee, and the chicken omelette is a risk - some days they mess it up by putting too much salt in, some days it's ok. 

But what Coffee House offers you is the pleasure of good company and conversation. Or if you're the loner sort, then just an opportunity to sit in a quiet corner of the room, surrounded by the smoke and buzz of nearby gatherings, and read a book, or maybe even write one. 

Also, important tip: - do not mess with the waiters. Make no mistake, these dudes own the place, and it's pretty easy to piss them off.

It's crowded (obviously), with cigarette smokes all over the place. The stuff is horrible. They make you wait ages to take your order, they make you wait ages to serve you the food. 
AND THE FOOD!! They don't really charge you that less to give you that bad food. 
So, if you want to experience the historic place, by all means go once. If you are thinking about food, no never..

Rated only for history and heritage attached to it not for food. Coffee House is part of Bengal's glorious and dynamic past, its ambiance tell Bengali culture is still alive. Coffee House is birth place of so many creation, so many movements, so many ideas.
But if you want to rate it as restaurant then it will not get even 2. Except coffee and variations of coffee which are just average only good thing is their sandwich and that's all. All other foods are dipped in oil, afgani and cutlet taste same and i can go on and on. Go there with friends for purpose of pure chat with coffee and toast pr sandwitch not for eating purpose. And not to say hostile behavior of there waiters, okay they are proud of being part of such heritage but that doesn't justify rude behaviour to customers who are as well part of it. They even cut money for tips themselves before party approve.

So i love coffee house and go again and again only to feel Bengali me. I don't regard it a restaurant at all

Rated only for history and heritage attached to it not for food. Coffee House is part of Bengal's glorious and dynamic past, its ambiance tell Bengali culture is still alive. Coffee House is birth place of so many creation, so many movements, so many ideas.
But if you want to rate it as restaurant then it will not get even 2. Except coffee and variations of coffee which are just average only good thing is their sandwich and that's all. All other foods are dipped in oil, afgani and cutlet taste same and i can go on and on. Go there with friends for purpose of pure chat with coffee and toast pr sandwitch not for eating purpose. And not to say hostile behavior of there waiters, okay they are proud of being part of such heritage but that doesn't justify rude behaviour to customers who are as well part of it. They even cut money for tips themselves before party approve.

So i love coffee house and go again and again only to feel Bengali me. I don't regard it a restaurant at all

When Visit I was nostalgic about the old Kolkata. Where there no AC, no modernization but there is amazing feel when I visit with my girlfriend with Samosa and Cold Coffee. Amazing Aadda with friends with Chicken Kabirirazi and cutlet.

My very first experience here, was in 2004, when me and a few of my batchmates had skipped a first year class in college (Presidency, which was a stone's throw away from this place), and were sipping on Infusion and contributing to an adda session. Days passed, and over the years, those very batchmates became my buddies, and Coffee House became a second home, of sorts. My first date, my birthday, my bestie's birthday, more dates followed here. In the days of meagre pocket money, when we did not have smartphones, Apps or even Facebook, this place made us feel lively, and has made a special place in my heart. Have spent days of joy, sorrow, despair, excitement and solitude, here. Over the years, I became a fan of their Grilled fish, Baked fish, Chicken cutlet, Chicken Kabiraji and cold coffee (watery, but then again, it's Coffee house). I have had many friends who compared this place to 'Howrah station', called it filthy, and claustrophobic. True, Coffee house is not CCD, and the waiters may not be very friendly, or may not  have the sugar-coated, fake smiles that waiters in modern cafes exude, but, Coffee house is part of Kolkata's heritage. Period. Have loved, and will love this place, forever !!!

This place is best for people like us who get minimum pocket money.....The behavior of the waiters are not so warm......but the manager was quite nice.He had allowed me and my friend to celebrate his birthday there.......
    now comes the food.....
         I love " Mixed Chowmein ". It was just yummy..."Sandwich and "Infusion" is good for people who are dieting.:)And one of my favourites................"Chicken Fried Rice" and "Chilli Chicken" were not so good.....it was just ok........."Chicken Omelette" was good try.....But I just hate "Onion Pakora" and "Fish Kaviraji".The dishes were quite disgusting

During my last Kolkata visit, I was looking forward to an evening in this particular location. I must mention that this place has a charm of its own. Like, even though the place remains quite crowded, that too on a Puja evening, it never feels unpleasant. Sitting at our table, I took note of all the different kinds of people sitting around me. Most of them actually didn't visit the place just for coffee. They went their for some other reason. But in spite of all that I have written so far about the charm and the ambience, this place lacks quality food. The food served is usually far from good and the quantity is very much trivial. If you're a foodie, this place might not be good for you. Even the coffee is very ordinary. Looks like the owners of this restaurant do not focus on quality food as their joint is immensely popular and will remain so due to its history and due to the word of mouth of native Bengalis. I rate it 3.0 stars only because of its charm, history and heritage.

Bang opposite to Pesidency University you get to see " Indian Coffee House". As I own a house very close to this area, I've often been to this place and have tried almost everything here. The ambience is good and you will never feel lonely out here even if you are alone. 

There is no A/C, no WIFI like all other cafes but the old fashioned comfortable chairs give you a wonderful Bong feeling. Sometimes there is a huge queue and you are asked to wait but once you get hold of a seat, you can sit as long as you wish to. 

Some of the dishes here are really good at very low prices. Chicken cutlets, Afgani chicken, chicken sandwiches and the heavenly cold coffee are the ones I want on my table when am in. I've tried out the chinese dishes like fried rice, hakka/ gravy noodles etc but they were not all that good. They say that the quality of food has fallen off, sometimes I do feel so but the mentioned ones are always nice I feel. 

Sometimes the attendants do not pay adequate attention but at a crowded place like that you can't bring such complains. If they mop up the plates before serving I will really be glad. 

Anyhow, I like going to this place and suggest you to visit too.

I used to visit this place when I was eighteen. That was a different Kolkata called 'Calcutta'. Of the late seventies. It was a city of violent, collective dreams and Coffee House was a part of those dreams. I went to the Coffee House day before yesterday. Since those dreams have been bought off it has become a 'foodie place with a heritage tag' with its iconic oily pakoras, dry and tasteless chicken sandwiches, watery coffee and ill-mannered waiters.

This was my first visit to this heritage food joint and it made me fall in love with it completely,as this does to everyone. The old Kolkata ambience,the British style of service and most importantly the mouth watering cutlet and kabiraji makes this place an all-time favourite. I've never eaten such chicken cutlet and fish kabiraji which just melts in your mouth in a long long time. Talk about adda and food,this should be your first choice anyday.

It's a place that takes you through time, to the colonial era. It is famous for being the rendezvous of innumerable eminent personalities. The house receives guests ranging from students to working class & is always buzzing with energy. The food was above my expectations and extremely pocket friendly. With seating capacity in hundreds, the service was quick. People looking for rich interiors & fine dine, stay away; Rest must pay a visit!

This is one of those places which strike a chord with the city Kolkata and its people. Mostly cold coffee with cream is our preferred choice. Also with non-veg snacks and smokes the late evening gossips are a common source of pleasure to us. The more you will ask about it the more I will talk about it's legacy rather than food quality or price.

This place is always crowded but is perfect for a lunch or dinner. The signature dishes are chicken chowmein, chicken afghani and cold coffee with cream. The cold coffee i had here was better than the one i had in kfc. But the fish items aren't up to the mark. But definitely this place is a must visit for all bengalis.

Intellectual Kolkata's heritage!! Chicken cutlets and chicken afghani are the decent ones on the menu. Among the list of coffees, not all are good but the one served with cream is better off. Its really surprising how the waiters remember so many orders en mass without noting them down and don't jumble up the things. Just the opposite of Rachel Green!! I have tested their talent by ordering in a haphazard way addind, cancelling and changing the orders, yet they never go wrong and neither does the bill.
Ambience is noisy. You might spot someone sketching or writing, discussing politics, thesis etc. You go in empty headed and come out as a gainer of so much knowledge.

If you want to visit a legendary place, be in a historical place, to enjoy the feel of it, adda with a bunch of friends, this place is perfect for that. But don't go with too much expectations about the food and service. 
The service is, well, not good. It takes hours for them to come around to you. And only a few food items are good. Stay away from coffee and sandwich , if you can. I've been here innumerable times, and every time I ordered coffee, in the hope that this time it will be worth it, It wasn't, ever. The cutlets and kabirajis are quite good.
I rated 3.5 only because I'm nostalgic about this place. It's more like a 3 star.

As legendary as it is depicted, one gets a colonial feel as we enter the compound. The area is almost at any time crowded with a blend of people ranging from students to the working class and not to mention the typical 'hangout' junta. The additional beauty lies in their service. Each of the waiters are assigned their own tables and will take the orders in one quick motion. They seem to have developed a sense of quick deliverance of the orders. The food is ok (had Chicken Omelet and Mutton Cutlet). I would recommend the place to anyone who needs to hang out, eat, read or retrospect.

My friends and I visited Indian Coffee House once. It is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata, considered legendary. But according to me it is much hyped. You get super diluted cold coffee there. Does not even taste like a coffee, I think it is just water with a pinch of something which colours the water close to coffee. Even pakoras didn't taste good. The service is awful. Waiters have their nose high up in the sky all the time. If you have a problem with smoke, this is not the place for you. It is a little difficult to find a place in here where someone is not smoking. Only just fine thing about it is that it is a hangout spot for people specially college people to sit down and chit chat for quite good time if you have no problem with smoke all around.

A very nostalgic area specially among the senior generations. Indian Coffee house has been there for every generation & has seen every moments of addas & happiness!! Located just opposite of the presidency college. Been there quite a few times to have some refreshments after book shopping :P. Well the food quality has fallen off in my opinion,for example I've had inconsistent coffee tastings over & i found the pakoras cold & stale everytime I've eaten there.

In spite of all this it still & will always be a place of heritage among the college students.

A symbol of the Grand old British Calcutta,now almost at its demise.
The ambience is excellent,a reminiscence of the Bengali intellectual mindset and rich cultural heritage.However the food is a disappointment.
The coffee is average.The chicken cutlets and mutton afghani donot tease the palate.The fish fingers are okay-ish.The mutton omelette was below standards,oily,bland.
The sandwiches,however,are still light and tolerable.
Point in mind,donot go there for the food.Go there for the ambience,and a rendezvous with what British Kolkata looked like.

The Coffee House- One & all has heard about this place. Located at the College street, just opposite to the Presidency University, this place is a fav hangout for college goers because it is essentially a cheap eatery. It covers a huge area with main hall & balcony seating arenas. This legendary place has been a rich heritage of Kolkata. Once you climb the stairs, it gives you a feeling of the old Kolkata with big fans, dressed waiters and plenty of tables. Though the name bears 'coffee', Indian coffee house do not make great coffee at all. So it is advisable not to go for coffee. In the food segment, they definitely have good options. Chicken and mutton cutlet, fish finger, fish fry, chicken hakka chowmein, chicken fried rice, chilly chicken are really good. Do not expect gourmet stuff but the food won't disappoint you either. They serve you decent proportions but don't expect a prompt service as it is a large place and catering such a huge crowd is difficult for the staff so there will be an obvious service delay. The prices are really cheap with respect to other restaurants so eat till you are full when you hit this joint. Visit coffee house asap because it is worth a visit. :)

I visited this place on my friend's suggestion and was literally cursing myself. The waiters wear untidy uniform and were unprofessional. The food was pathetic. The beverages were a blunder too. In 21st century you just don't expect this from any place where you pay for food. So what.... if its been there since ages??
I would highly recommend some changes here....!!

Most disgusted place ever..heard what not about it and was very disappointed with what experienced.. the cheapest crowd take most of the place..leaving hardly any place for others to sit..most of them are from the so called best colleges in Kolkata.. there is at least 2 or 3 boards of no smoking.. and the management doesn't even bothers to stop people from smoking...the room is filled with the smoke of cigarette making it so stuffy an atmosphere...its sickening and I even got a headache..them comes the food..which is like any road side snack stall..and the so famous coffee? Its like you are having nothing but water...i can myself make a better coffee from what they serve..a big 'don't go'

This place is located in the middle of one of  the most busiest localities in Calcutta, college street. It is noisy and u will find everyone speaking at the same time. They serve good coffee and egg sandwich. A complete mystery visit to this place coz it's a legendary place in Calcutta. It is mostly filled with college students.

What to say about this place.....heard about it since a toddler from my father....a cool place to a have a "adds" over a cup of coffee ????....and some yummy snacks.....and with a fag between your fingers...

       My personal favourite here is the black coffee ???? and fish fry...although sandwiches needs to be mentioned too.
     
    I don't think this place need any reviews & if anyone hasn't been to this place.....he/she missing out a big nostalgic experience of one's youth.

This place has been on my wishlist for quite some time.
And I made sure to be here when i was in Kolkata this time around.
It's quite unassuming from the outside but this place is huge and it was packed to the brim.
And also has a balcony section which has a smoking area,where we choose to sit.
The ambiance is of a govt. office canteen and old school.
The servers were hard to get a hold of which is understandable.
We ultimately got him to take our order which was a couple of Chicken Sandwiches,a Mutton Sandwich,the famed Mutton Kaviraji,a Mutton Cutlet,some hot coffees and a Chicken Omelette.
The hot coffees which came with a small can of cream was the right amount of sweet.
The sandwiches i wasn't impressed with as they were bland and had boiled chicken and meat in it.
The Mutton Kaviraji which is a small twist to the cutlet was definitely worth the wait and was soft and mildly spiced.
The cutlet was similar with deep fried goodness and both came with ketchup and mustard sauce for a change.
The Chicken Omelette was oily and bland which i didn't enjoy.

The service was fairly quick compared to the wait time for our order.
This place is legendary and rightly so.

Cheers.

Okay this place has got the bestest ambiance of all eateries all over Kolkata!!!!!Come on that's the reason this place is legendary.But,I'm very disappointed to say that I'm compelled to rate this place only on the basis of that.Talking about food,that department needs serious consideration over improving the quality.Even the "COFFEE" did not impress me for which it is so famous!!!The only food that seemed only okay was the chicken sandwich.But then this is "THE COFFEE HOUSE".whatever happens,we'll all love this place.So I would personally love some changes coming through.

I agree with the "Legendary" tag that Zomato has placed on this restaurant. But that's it. You can't associate any bit of food review with this place other than eons of nostalgia and the never-ending stories of how (and when) the SunilGangppadhyays and the Jibananda Das's used to visit here - not for the coffee, but for the free adda zone that it used to offer. And of course, you'd have Manna Dey's song beig discussed in some corner or the other. 

Since this is a food review, at least a couple of lines have to be written. But then it would be all about the extremely-diluted drink on offer, called coffee. You wonder whether it's been prepared with the same sample which the Brits had left behind. 

The ceiling fans and sky-high, to keep up with the tradition and obviously the air never reaches you. But what would irk you the most is the disgusting attitude of the waiters. They are seriously 'sarkari-naukars' and they'd make you grateful if you are lucky to have your order served by them during that evening. 
Long live snobbery. 
Long live Coffee House.

You will have to bring your own table and chair to have a breakfast here. Prices are really low. Taste is average. I have been to few ICH in india but here it seems like the cook really don't take interest in cooking anymore. Seems like now days it runs only because of its low prices.

What better place to have endless hours of chatter and gossip with best of your buddies with glasses full of cold coffee! This place is full of energy,ideas( and lots of smoke ;) ) all the time.Must try mutton kabiraji,mutton cutlet and chicken afgani!!!
What is really funny about this place is that you will see 'no smoking' boards hanging on the walls but this place has probably got more smokers in a single room than anywhere else in the world! Also you may run out of your patience waiting for your order! Having said that there is no better place just to sit and keep chatting the whole day with your friends!

Undoubtedly the best place to hangout with friends…I am in love with the atmosphere out here…enjoying with friends sitting here is one of the memories i'll cherish forever.Even the quality of food is quite above standard.i still remember one incident-i was sitting here with my class 10 group…one of them thought for 15 mins about what to order and then finally ordered a boiled egg for himself!! XD XD
I think very few restaurants would be able to match the atmosphere out here.I'll always have a soft corner for this place and it would definitely have a place in my 'fav restaurants' list.

This is a legendary place of kolkata and was once the best place for people to hang out over a cup of coffee and chit-chat. But with time this place has really lost it's value,it's charm and everything that used to attract people. I have been to this place a couple of times but each time i visit i come out with more and more disappointments. First time it was only the cleanliness,the hygiene..but still keeping in mind the age of this place(though they should take care of each and every part considering that the place was once something that kolkata was proud of) i let this point go. Next time it was the food. The sandwich and chicken cutlet we ordered were totally cold and felt stale..we thought of complaining but no1 was even there to attend people properly. The sandwich was okay,you can have a cold sandwich..at least it won't taste such a disaster as the cutlet would. The flesh in the cutlet was chewy and one could easily tell how stale it was. I was really disappointed...since i had never been to coffee house before my expectations were to such a high level after i heard about this place from my father...all my expectations were shattered. I still would like to pay them a visit again to check out if they have improved on their preparations or have deteriorated more..

Located just opposite to the gate of Presidency, it is barely a 10-min walk from college street bus stop .

Indeed, this place is 'heritage'. Not the kind of heritage which is carefully maintained with the motto of cleanliness, but the one that gradually succumbs to the pressure of the modernized generations .Surprisingly, this place still pulls the crowd despite all the flaws and is 'actually' one of the perfect places for some adda.

If you're a smoker you will love this place, if you're not , you might as well not survive here.

Food : The coffee is awful. I think you could have better coffee in some nearby tea-stalls. I do like their 'singaras' though. Kabiraji is good. I disliked the chicken afghani , way too spicy for me. Chinese is a big NO for me. 

Ambiance: Smoky. Loud. crowded(always). Honestly, no matter how good/bad the ambiance is ,if you're with a group of friends, you will actually 'feel' the bengali vibe here. Not really a place to be frequented with family.

Service: The waiters are really rude. They won't let you sit and take awhile to order. They won't even let you stay awhile after you've paid.

Overall, no matter how awful this place actually is, you may just fall in love with it . :P (or not)

To anyone who has heard the song " Coffee Houser shei adda ta..." my the legendary Manna Dey, knows about this LEGENDARY place. 
For a first time visitor, it appears totally like a huge conference room, two floors, about 50 or so 4 seater tables and an endless buzz of chatting and fun. 
I liked this place for the ambiance it has. Its not a place where you go and cosy up with your loved one and talk in hushed romantic tones, its a place where you have debates with your peers, and exchange ideas. 
I had coffee, black, which was pretty strong and had a chicken cutlet, very well done. The service is not exactly top notch, but then again, catering to around 200 customers, does take some time. This place is a must visit during the Kolkata tours beyond a doubt.

A heritage place 'coz of "Cofee House er shei adda ta aaj ar nei..." Song....The students of the nearby colleges & others seldom visit there. A nice place to gossip for hours. But the food & service quality is as bad as the outer structure of the Cofee House Building. They give roasted uncooked mutton in mixed fried rice, while makes a Rs.20 cofee with Milk Powder. They often hesitate to give water (which is free by the way), even when we order stuffs.

Ok, I get the whole 'taste of history' thing but this place makes you question whether history sucked as much as their coffee! The tables weren't wiped clean, the menu card was in a sorry state but interestingly used by customers to pen down their grievances and getting a chair to sit is difficult too! While trying to keep it safe, an order for cold coffee was placed which arrived after an eon. The coffee seemed so bubbly (even though cold) that it got unapologetically spilled on the table and on my friend by the reluctant waiter. He dragged over to sleepily wait on the next table while we dipped straws to taste history (didn't want to kiss the 'historical' and dubious coffee beakers). All hell broke loose when it reached my mouth. It did seem like coffee, diluted to the power of several ice cubes. I just could not finish it. The 1.5 I awarded is for the bustling environment (unlike any other place) and for the interiors of the building; that is history to relish.

Now how does someone objectively review a place of great heritage like the Coffee House? It's got that ambience that makes people take selfies with the uniformed waiters and go up the stairs to take shots of folks chattering by, ostensibly to write that dramatic book or play, or simply to stir up yet another revolution. But Zomato is also about food, and in this regard, the Coffee House just, well, sucks. The cold coffee is a soup of sugar. The grilled fish Kabiraji has seen better hands to cook. The mutton cutlet had bacon-ish pieces of mutton (which was ok) but not chewy enough. The eggs in the omlette were traditional deep fried, which I dislike. All in all, come for the check-ins and the photos and of course the "experience" but never the food.

As a north Kolkatan i have visited this place multiple times. It bears a lot of heritage and is a perfect place for some adda. But as the name suggest coffee house, their speciality should be coffee. But it is not. They taste more watery. Cold coffee taste like cold water. Infusion is on bitter side. Some food are good like moghlai, chicken omlete etc but the sandwiches are super flop. All in all one should visit this place for its heritage and to enjoy the bengali adda and not for its coffee.

Indian Coffee House is only popular among the old poets. The ambience of this place is very bad, while sitting here eyes burn owing to the smoke of cigar. people smoke immensely inspite of it a no smoking zone. Food served here is very bad, poor quality, tasteless. waiters here dont respond after repeated caling. they dont feel like taking orders. Servicing is very bad. overall coffee house is bad.

Needless to say this food destination is known for its old charm and authenticity. Inspite of being a conjested place I love the ambience. We, a group of five visited it today. We ordered for hot coffee, chicken kaviraji and chicken cutlet. Must say all of them were awesome! The hot coffee was just too good, simply love the pure flavour of coffee which actually misses in other coffee joints. The chicken kaviraji was just mouth watering, even better than the cutlet. Moreover we had a great time over such authentic food. It remains one of my favourite. And talking about price, it's damn pocket friendly. Will visit it again soon.

The ambience was amazing and very much like Bangalore's koshys. Slow service and somewhat impatient and rude waiters are part and parcel of this old Kolkata experience and I loved it. The fish fingers were okay and the onion pakodas were quite terrible. The coffee was abominable. Anyhow. It was part of our Kolkata experience and we were happy with it.

A legend?? Hell YES!!
If you are a native of Calcutta or if you have come to visit Calcutta but never stumbled upon this place, then its a big shame on you. The oldest coffee shop. Rather, the inception of the idea of a coffee shop is The Indian Coffee House. Numerous Bengali movies have been shot here and even after generations have passed, this place has kept its essence in-tact. Though it still maintains its old structure and ambiance in this era of the new generation, they have a full house every evening.
Though you won't find sassy, classy, posh dishes, you will definitely fall for the ambiance which is effortlessly created and is unique. It is nowhere else to be found. The experience is for a life-time and once you have been there, it's impossible to forget the place.

P.S.: Please visit this legendary place at least once in a lifetime to understand what the people writing these reviews are talking about.

The fact that this place is filled always and people are talking about different things make a excellent ambiance.

CONS - 
COFFEE ( That is not coffee )

I rate this place very highly just because this was once home to me. Its kind of a ritual for every student of Presidency college to be here. Earlier we all could smoke here too but sadly that isn't allowed now. This is the intellectual hub till date. Authors, film directors, professors and politically aware students sit here with black coffee and snacks. Although I personally hate almost every food dish here, my usual order has always been Chicken sandwich or egg sandwich or the chicken kabiraji with a cup of coffee. Simple bread butter toast with egg poach is good enough for breakfast. Too many memories are attached to this place. The casual and serious addas are truly missed.

This place is legendary indeed when it comes to food & adda at which we Bengalis rule. Best for hanging out with friends. However, currently the worst thing about coffee house is the coffee itself. The taste of coffee they serve is simply horrible. But I love the tit-bits. Fish fries and fish fingers are great. Overall I love the ambience there.

Customer service might be the worst in Kolkata. The pride of the house made non friendly waiters.

Definitely This legendary place is one of the most famous and historical one. And the place is really really huge and for the first time going there I was stunned. It has also two section, one is the ground floor and another on the balcony though all the sections are non-AC but the right place for 'ADDA' with your friends. But if we really have to deal with the foods then Te quality of the coffee or chai is average and the pakora or kaviraji is really poor. But the cutlet and the fishfry were avergae. So to live the history and the heritage , culture of Old Kolkata you should definitely visit this grand grand 'The Indian Coffee House'.

Tip: A good place for spending an hour to 2 hour with friends . But not a good place for food. And the unique thing is that smoking is allowed inside.

This place is more of just one word rather than food "AMBIENCE". With the crowds age group ranging from "College Students" to "Dadus" , this place has been there since those dadus had been college students.

My personal fav there is the Tomato Omlette and Coffee. A remarkably best bet for a group looking out for some good time , unlike CCD,Barista or Starbucks (No offense intended) this place is raw which is the best thing I like about it.

The place which makes every true calcuttan nostalgic. You can order few cups of black coffee and some sandwiches for the gang and spend hours over discussion on anything on earth without being interrupted for anything else. Still the best place for the purpose.

A historical place, an integral part of Calcutta's heritage, a hub of my parents' generation. Been there only once, because i was passing by. Was curious and dropped in. It was around four-five years ago. I had obviously their coffee and something with chicken. It was awesome. The ambience is probably still the same as it was during inception. I wish more efforts are taken to promote the indian coffee house and i do hope to get more varieties the next time i come.

Well, who doesn't know this legendary place The "Indian Coffee House". It has been an integral part of Kolkata's heritage and has an immense contribution towards the cultural infestation of this jolly old city of joy. This cafe has been serving the people of Kolkata for around a century. Various eminent personalities of our city and country started their journey from this place. There are uncountable number of urban legends about this coffee shop. This is the place where our grandfathers' once used to hang out with their friends. It has dictated all over the city during its glorious golden era. Everything in this coffee house from the chairs, the tables, the vintage ceiling fans, everything has a history of its own. The people those who used to be regular at this coffee house, whose colorful presence and their gossips used to echo all over the house half a century ago, are now a handful of ashes, but this "Indian Coffee House" is the sole witness of their youth, their excitement, their golden era and this coffee house still preserves them will care. Every brick of this joint has a story to tell. Every people of Kolkata has an integral connection with this coffee house bonded by their ancestors. I am not discussing about the foods, its quality or other similar things as I am not worthy to do so. "Indian Coffee House" is a living legend, it is here where the generation meets.

just came back & too much disappointed to say anything about this place.. We ordered "Chicken Kobiraji" & those were filled up by everything but Chicken- now that sounds like a joke. They even dint give us a knife to cut those off. They dint serve a single glass of water. The food plate was messed up with sauces & salads. The "Hot Coffee with Cream" was without any kinda cream & tastes too light. Same goes for "Cold Coffee with Cream". Now, if there is something worth praising, that is the ambience. It's really nostalgic to have seat here & feel the vibrant atmosphere. Time actually stops here & yes, I really had great time with my partner.

Nothing of its glory is left, and the place is totally unfit to go with a female friend, coz all the people there (don't know where they come from) just keep staring till you feel embarassed. Food quality is simply horrible, the worst dish being the coffee itself. The waiters also ask you blatantly to give them tips. Please avoid this place. I had been a student of Calcutta university and hav spent 2yrs in that area, and its my sincere recommendation that you don't go there just because of its history and heritage.

We friends wanted a place where we could forget time for the being over a cup of coffee...whats better than this place..Before anything about the food or coffee... What takes your heart away is the sheer feel of history related to the place... Built somewhere in the 18th century is the same place you would be dining where our indian independence heroes had their snack.. What astonishes you are waiters all dressed up in white.. Who never take an order before you almost have spent half an hour waiting...

Food... Quite cheap compared to "coffee houses" downtown... 15 bucks aa coffee that is what it takes.. Coffee quite nice.. So was the food... We had chowmein... But the snacks weren't up to the mark.. We had samosa and pakoda..  

Thing to enjoy is the feel of home and friendship.. This is what you get here.. Saw people in their 60 cooking in gangs of 15 enjoying the same I was doing with my buddies..

A legendary place where word fails to describe. A place where I have spent almost every weekends when I was in University. I never ever planned to go to coffee house, it was an add-on right after I bought books. An ideal place for adda, making new friends, talking about love, poetry, butts all around, and innumerous other stuff.

I always ordered for mixed noodles and this is one place where they put mutton pieces besides chicken and egg. The famous cutlet and fish fry is something one shouldn't miss. Non-AC yet the most visited place with lovely memories embedded in those bricks of the walls.

The last time i went there with a friend of mine during the rainy season. it was drizzling outside and by the time we reached there it was totally full and after waiting for sometime we got a corner table near to the kitchen door. i wasn't happy with the sit. whatever... we were exhausted and waited for the waiter to take our orders. he came and we ordered 2 cold coffees, onion pakkora, fish kaviraji , and chicken afgani, and chicken hakka chow. the food was more or less good. pakkora was good! kaviraji was very average, the afgani was not so good abit on the sweeter side. i didnt like it! :/ hakka chow was good but the chicken pieces were bland and seemed to be pulled rather than diced.  its a very cheap place to satisfy your hunger. one should go there for the 'adda".  had a great time catching up with my friend! :)

The history associated with this place speaks by itself, this is not just another place where you come to have your food. The walls, tables boldly speak of the great Bengal heritage.
The ambience is always vibrant, people of all groups relive their nostalgia.
The food is good enough, to meet the taste buds of the bengalis, even others.
Visit this heritage place atleast once, whenever you visit Kolkata.

College street coffee house was one of the oldest cafe situated in northern kolkata. Few days ago visit there after a long time. When enter there we founded that not a single table is empty there all are occupied due to its immense popularity. Feeling a little disappointment we decided to leave the cafe then suddenly a table was became empty and we take that place. Now the main story begins we appoint a waiter to give water but he did not respond for 5-7 minutes then he serve us water and take our order. We ordered hakka chicken chow & chilli chicken boneless. After a long 10 minutes waiting we got our food. The food was mediocre but the chicken pieces were too good. Above all a good place for giving adda due to which sometimes seats are not available. But above all a good place.

A phenomenon where every Calcuttian can proudly behold his hereditory right as our parents their parents even if for once have visited this Great and probably the biggest coffee house in india. I was privileged enough to calendar my first visits to this mamoth enterprise with My Grandmother Gita Ghatak who is a known name in India along with great poets like Shankha Ghose whom is used to call Shankha Dadu, Sunil Gangopadhyay and many such giants in their own stature in one of their many cultural addas. I was a mere girl of 5 or 6 and this place seemed nothing less than a palace to me then. And even now after good 23 years this place holds an aura which is simply uncomprehensible. A lil bit of history lesson: in 1936 Started by Coffee Cess Committee there are over 400 Branches all over inf=dia first being instilled in Bombay. Now though since 1950 The Indian Coffee House is run by The worker Cooperative independently. When you visit Indian Coffee House you immediately get transported to the British era with the Waiters attired in their red and White clothes and Pagri. And what holds all of it together is the quality of the food. Chicken Sandwisch, Grilled Fish Baked Fish laden with grilled tomatoes and onion gravy and ultimately the coffee. The price is unparalleled and so is the environment. I am ahuge fan of their Black Coffee and Their Cold Coffee with extra cream. Mind it the service is bit slow...but then as they say all good things prosper in good time.

this place is all about nostalgic ambience, & the food served is surprisingly good.. as i don't fall in that age group,so it is an apt place to experience the 70s & 80s culture of polics, adda, intellectual & definitely the food of then Calcutta..
but till now i'm amused by the memory of the waiters here.. they take the order of atlst 5 tables at a time but don't note them down yet every table is served with their respective meals.. even during the time of payment they are present with the correct add-ups for each table.. long-live their memory :-D

One of oldest place of kolkata. Very less college kids of kolkata have not been to this place!
The place involves lots of nostalgia,memories for many. It has been background for a number of songs and movies in bengali....
The ambience is typically old kolkata bearing that old smell and rings of fumes that seems to get imbibed as soon as one gets sitted.
Clock forgets to tick once friends are there... Well am too getting a bit nostalgic here.
Food is very reasonable, as its meant for college people mostly.
Its a part of kolkata's heritage.

It was on panchami this year. After pandal hopping we were really hungry and therefore decided to go to coffee house to grab a quick bite. My friends and I seated ourselves in the balcony section. Obviously the place was overcrowded,infact we did not get a seat at first but thankfully the waiters managed a table for four of us after 5minutes. We had to wait another 20mins before the waiter came to take our order.The order was simple- chicken chowmein nd chilly chicken and cold coffee with creamWe had to wait for an hour for the food to arrive. I don't know whether its normally so late however I would blame it as simply puja rush.Coming to the food, the noodles were really tasty..enough in quantity for 1 personthere were 5pcs of chicken in the side dish...the gravy was really delectable..very satisfying and filling.There isn't much ambience..i mean the place definitely doesn't look attractive..no plush chairs and all..but as people say they go there mainly for nostalgia and adda..well that's very true. And as I always feel an adda should b accompanied by some decent snacks and food..in that context coffee house surely doesn't disappoint. The waiters are well dressed which gives an old world charm to the place. However one thing shoud be noted: coffee house isn't a place for having coffee. The cold coffee with cream might be okay to a particular crowd..but if u are a CCD or any other café visitor..then avoid it..u will find it to be pukish. It is strictly okay to the"bangali" standard. The price is quite reasonable and one can smoke openly (which I obviously hated) which makes this place a hub for students to visit.

This place is purely about nostalgia n the old world charm. The moment you enter u get a back to the roots sort of a feeling because of the ambiance. Obvoiusly with CCD n Barista popping up in almost every locality this place is no longer THE place for having coffee anymore. Still none of the posh n well maintained cafes have been able to replace the place of Coffee house in the hearts of the people of kolkata.

I especially loved the way the waiters were dressed up. The balcony section is great for having an adda with friends.

 Coming to the food i liked the Cold coffee with cream n chicken sandwich. 

Would love to revisit time n again.

The fact doesn't matter whether it is a 5star café or an average one....the main factor that attracts the people from 8yrs-80yrs towards it,is its heritage.No matter how many luxurious coffee houses are introduced....Indian Coffee House will always be the best place to hangout with your friends...whether you are of 18 or 80 :)

First of tell you today I am very happy and nostalgic also after getting back to one of my favorite adda destination the great Indian coffee house. Its the only place in the modern Kolkata which refuse to change its own style against everything. The same old laziness, same old adda, the trademark of Kolkata, lots of discussion about every inch of the world from Romanian economy to Ronaldo to Rahul Gandhi you'll find all in these adda sessions over a cup of coffee, its amazing.
First I should mention that if you want a waiter with good etiquette and you will get a great service from them then you should try some where else, there are lots of good restaurants all over the Kolkata but Coffee House is not for you. 
The waiters will attend you whenever they will get time, you can't complain about that. They will bring the food little late but that is ok. Nobody bothers about that, every body is busy is their own group adda session, and the more the waiter get delayed the more time you'll get for the adda, hahaha that's the fun. Its not about the food or service or the decor its beyond that. Everybody is so busy that the person beside your table is laughing out so loud get unnoticed. Its the place where you can easily put aside the formal so called etiquette and lough your heart out, have fun with friends.
But the food has its own old Kolkata flavors, the Mughlai Paratha, All type of Cutlet, Kaviraji is a must try except the traditional Coffee, but please don't compare it with the CCD, Barista and all that.
Today I tried the Mughlai Paratha and Mutton Cutlet both are my personal favorite, the Cutlet was awesome great crisp, hot rich with spices served with mustard sauce (Kolkata's own style), the Mughlai partha was equally good, the crisp crust, filled with spicy egg, chicken and other fillings full of spices, and last but not the least the Aloo Tarkai (Sabji) served with the Mughlai paratha it has its own flavor, truelly speaking you'll never find this taste in other places I bet, I simply love this one. 
All in one " had a great time after coming back to Kolkata after a long time".

But I love this place not only because I love their ćliche way of serving and maintaining their heritage or for legendary singer like Manna Dey coined its name but I also had my first ever date here when I was in eleven. I thought she would left me after being here opting CCD. But she hugged me and kissed me after I took her there. Well althought she left me but INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE will be always with me remembering her.Now I regularly visit my first date place. And love this place of not being Any hi-fi CCD or Barista.

Awestruck, I was awestruck when I visited Coffee House, for the first time. The place where nostalgia stands still in Kolkata. I couldn't believe, personalities such as Netaji, authors and poets such as Sunil Ganguly, Shakti Bondopadhay had once regenerated Bengal here. It takes a while, to let the ambience of that hallowed building to set in. We ordered Fish Kabiraji, Chicken Pakoras and three steaming mugs of coffee. The quality of food, is average. The price, unbelievably cheap. Eating was the last thing on our mind, while we were there. The sheer magnanimity of the thoughts that has seeped into the mortar of this building, makes it worth a visit. Time and again.
Kolkata would be incomplete without this building.
The food, the air, the atmosphere were akin to each other.
Simple and old-school.

Indeed a legendary place. Kolkata's heritage. A symbol of a never ending adda. People come here when they are young then in their teens after marriage and even after becoming senior citizens. Cherishing memories and looking back at the past and getting lost in the nostalgia. *Sheevers* Food is sbove average too.

Some restaurant are known for their heritage. The Indian Coffee House is one of them. The state run coffee house serves the best drink for a coffee addict. Infusion- the cheapest and the simplest to make on it's al-a-carte is highly recommended if you visit coffee house. Set in 100 year old house, this gives a perfect location to meet up with old friends, escape from the busy life and discuss things that drive the world in a way it is moving today. This is a perfect spot for"adda" and surely can be considered as one of the places to visit if you are in Kolkata. If you are in Kolkata and haven't visited this place, visit this place next thing in the morning. Special mention is to be given about the chicken afgani they serve.

Apart from being a heritage site, there's not much to say about this place. It's awe-inspiring to sit at the same place where the greatest of the great stalwarts of Bengal and outside chatted their time away and inspired and were inspired. Now-a-days, the quality of the food has deteriorated so much that even with the pleasure of good company we are reluctant to go there for a sip n' bite. But the place is always crowded, packed mainly with university students, puffing away happily. Venture inside only if you want to visit a landmark of Kolkata and not for good food!

This is THE place to hangout.. Inspite of multiple coffee shops and bistros coming up all over kolkata, yet this remains to be the best place for a traditional adda..
The chicken kabiraji was good, the chowmein was decent, and the quantity was more than enough for one person.. The grilled fish ib this place is also nice..
As all the people know, go to coffee house for adda and not for food!!

Heart of Kolkata, opposite Presidency University. 
Its the place where documentaries, films of Tollywood (Kolkata's film industry) usually features. Directors can be found sitting here with the famous coffee & their scripts, drowned in their thoughts. 

Fish/chicken kobiraji alongwith the famous coffee is a must try. The price is reasonable.
Management isn't that good, the waiters don't care much about you. Its very difficult to grab a seat here, as its always crowded throughout the year whenever you come. 

The uniqueness of this place is that you can smoke inside!! :D

This is one of the oldest and most colorful heritage sites of Kolkata. Again, the safe abode of the pocket-pinchers, college-goers and young unemployed lovers. This is where famous poets and writers of 90's Kolkata used to sit and debate and discuss over themselves and the world. The coffee isn't too great but it'll do for a price that low! The fish cutlet is legendary, simple and tasty. Best thing is no ones gonna hurry you with the bill, or to order something. Once you gain entry and some seats, you can stay daylong. That's your Sheldon spot..no ones going to claim it from you! It's not for the elite so Much now as for the youngsters. All the same the echo of the past speaks up to you. I love that place..

They do call it a heritage site or a place you should visit, well the quality of service and the food makes you feel otherwise. Surely, keeping aside the historical and cultural connotation of the place the service needs to be literally begged off rather than being expected to attended to. The food quality is rather average and so is the coffee.

Indian Coffee House has great historical value in Kolkata. Bengali people has a very special place for this place. From Politicians, Artists, Cinema Personalities to Enthusiast People you will find every sort of people at this place. Now coming down to the quality and service. There is a serious problem with the "waiters" here. They are very reluctant and thus service is very poor. They can take a lot of time to come with the Menu card if you dont call them up. Leaving out Coffee and some other fast foods, the rest are not that great. The price is also a bit high. The place is huge though you may find it difficult to find a place for you at times. Must Visit

quite dissatisfied with the service. as soon as me and a friend went in and sat at a table(after standing for a while as it was crowded) some rude member of the staff came and tried to tell us to leave because he thought we were customers who had finished our meal. after that was cleared and our order was taken, the waiter fumbled it up and got us 2 coffees instead of one even though he was clearly instructed to get 1. after he was told we didn't need an extra coffee he tried to get us to take it anyway. food was ok as a whole.

It was a Thursday. And a very humid one too.
I visited Coffee House after quite a long time and though much has changed, the quality of the food didn't disappoint me at all.
The order was simple: Egg Chowmein and Chilli Chicken.
The staff is always polite, though a little late. But we didn't mind.
The noodles were in really good quantity and tasty. The chicken was simply awesome. Soft, tender chicken pieces with an aroma that reminded me of the biscuit coatings used in Fish fries and chops. I never imagined boneless chicken could be this soft and tender.
Unfortunately, nowadays this place has just become a joint for youngsters to smoke. I don't like the acrid stink of cigarettes, specially while eating.
But it's the tasty fare coupled with the decades of nostalgia that stays on each time I leave.

Coffee house--one of the most important aspects of our traditional bengali culture...from the day of its establishment, it has been the witness of the hardcore 'bangaliana'- gossiping for hours, debate, infusion, political doctrine and dissention and intellectuality..from the famous song of manna day it is quite clear that once upon a time it used to be one of the most sophisticated institution of bengalies, but now a days it is losing its charm..maximum among the people visiting to this place start smoking and leave the environment stuffy..again service from the waiters is a little bit slow..apart of this it is a 'must go' place for all kolkata people not only because of its heritage but also to smell its old kolkata flavour..

This place needs no introduction. . People do not go their for food. . This place is all about nostalgia. In  Coffee House you will not get CCD BARISTA type atmosphere. . But what you get; you will never forget that...
Food (4/5)-》 we were a group of four.. waiters here will give you old kolkata charm.. order was taken after 15 mins.. we ordered cold coffee with cream, egg sandwich and chicken kabiraji as we were low on budget after book shopping.  I really like the sandwich and kabiraji. Coffee was not that much impressive.  
Location-》 Coffee HOUSE itself is a landmark in college street area.. near presidency college.. or you can ask anyone. .
Good place for smokers..as smoking is not prohibited here..

Once it used to be a legendary place with both of its great heritage and coffee making skills ... But now it has got nothing left except it's renowned name . The quality of tea and coffee is nothing but s***.  Once I saw some group of foreigners came together with great enthu ( must have read it's name in some review or something ) I was rt there sitting with some my friends , believe me it was a sight,  looking at there pretty pity faces when their orders arrived at their table and they tasted it ... 
Either the govt. or some private sec. Should definitely take over this place rt away and renovate it from top to bottom starting with food n beverages quality to ambiance .

This place is nostalgia for every kolkatan . but the quality has detoriated. All of the fries are super oily and some of them are inedible. Coffee is okayish , sandwiches are good. Tables are dirty and oily. Serevers are bad and slow 
The atmosphere is very claustrophobic with a smell of strong coffee and cigarettes.

This place needs no introduction. The place is as old as bangali cultural consciousness (well, almost ;) ) and is located at the heart of college street , right opposite presidency university. The first floor is the preferred spot for a lot of us , though some prefer the balcony ( for better DPs , I presume) . The staff here are dressed in their trademark whites with a hat , and the place is never empty ! The cutlets here are great , though most of them taste the same , weather you order fish, chicken or mutton! The chicken/ mutton Afghani is a personal favorite , though tad spicy and sweet but yummy nonetheless! They coffee served with milk comes in one of the cutest utensils I've ever seen, that looks like a tiny jug! If Adda is your thing , you probably wouldn't even need this review!

The word ambience goes out of the Window when you visit this quaint cafe, steepled in the history of this old city..

P. S- i forgot to mention about food.. Bunk food..  Its better to smoke and sip tea or coffee!

The main utility of this place is typical "adda" with friends.The food is sometimes good sometimes average, but obviously overpriced. The Cold Coffee is a typical item along with katlets.The main enjoyment is eating lazily with lot's of talk and fun. I just rated the place low because of the quality of the food. Nevertheless awesome place for get togethers.

I love the history attached to it... I mean, it's an antique place and the feel is great.. Just for having food... I admit... It's really not  a great place. But the entire college street somehow pulls me to visit and revisit... It is the oldest part of north Kolkata.

Food is not really up to the mark. Decor is pretty simple. But what really attracts crowd to this place is its ambiance heritage and history.
Surrounded by some of the oldest institutions in this country, this place is pretty much a mecca if you want to spend an evening filled with intellectual conversation over a cup of coffee. During its prime, it was frequented by the who's who of academic and artistry world. Although it has lost most of its charm, it still remains a hot spot to hangout. The architecture was so designed as to differentiate between first class and lower class of diners. Although the discrimination does not remain anymore, still the charm remains.

If you must try anything on the menu, go for the Infusion and Fries. If you are a student, go there with a friend, and just enjoy the conversation, some not so engrossing.

Coffee house-the place of adda, intellect and Bengalis. As its located within the college para, so it's always filled with people especially college goers. Being no exception, I was quite a regular here during my college days. Well can't say much about the coffee. It's just average. Mutton and chicken kabiraji is really good. The chicken cutlet also tops the list. But other than this nothing is extraordinary. Well, this pace is legendary so people looking for great food would be really disappointed. But I would say, you should pay a visit to this place once in your lifetime and see it for yourself

Indian Coffee house may not seem the most exotic of places, but there is something about the ambience of this place that pulls me there over and over. Sitting with a cup of black coffee, chatting, making acquaintances_ The Indian Coffee House is the best place for all of the above. The food here is pretty good. I would recommend Baked Fish, which is probably the one of the finest. And importantly its pretty economical and therefore an ideal place for us college students.

This rating is not for the food neither the coffee.. It's for the heritage. Coffee house is neither ambient nor spacious nor it serves good coffee. So what's in it well its the cultural epitome of Kolkata, used to be.. If your not in to Bengali literature or heritage you can't understand why this place gives goose bumps to every true bengali. From here the fates of history has been made, our culture is brewed here with its coffee.. 

Saying all this it's sad that this place is losing its value day by day.. It should be renovated and made up to the mark..

I have heard of Coffee House since childhood. It is one of the oldest cafeteria of Kolkata. It is definitely big. But frankly speaking it has no management. Poor service. And i didn't like the coffee or any other item. They don't maintain cleanliness. But there is a positive point that you can sit there for hours, no one mind it. You can speak loudly with your friends and have BENGALI ADDA. So it is a very noisy place.

I used to come here as a kid with my grand dad and my mom. 
She used to tell me about her college days   
I have a total special corner and full of nostalgic place for coffee house in my heart. 
Quick review. 
What to order ? 
The very famous chicken omelette is the delicacy here 
Otherwise you can always order the chicken pakora 
And have cold coffee or the normal coffee. 
If you are a smoker , then get your smokes from the shop downstairs. 
Don't have really high hopes with the food but yes it yummy! 
The chicken omelette is yummy.

This place is one of a kind. Do not keep high hopes related to the ambience, Atmo or crowd. For some places you must overlook these. This place is only for coffee lovers or to get a quick snack when you're around buying books or in the breaks from your college or tired up shopping fanatics. But inspite of that many come here especially to sit here relax with coffee and some snacks (smokers would love this smoking zone outlet) and rapt looking at the ceilings, fans, windows, the people and the noise. It's something you won't see anywhere else in town. The food is cheap and decent. The service is slow coz it's always so crowded. Highly recommended.

I am amazed how I havent yet reviewed coffee house. Every bangali is characterised by college street er boi para, dhuti , football and coffee House. More than anything else it is the legendary feel that makes this a regular place of visit and u feel a significant part of bangali history. Whenever we are in college street, coffee house steals the show. With rhe huge seating arrrangement. The casual ambience . The huge potrait of rabindranath tagore. U feel u r in bangla. The waiters dont have half the urge to even ask u for the order giving u a feel, u have the whole day to do nothing but sip coffee. Typical bengali adda with loads of lyad n the excellent coffee infusion is what u will find over here. The cold coffee with crème is good according to bangali standards. But u ll feel like spitting it off after having tasted café latte at barista. The fish fry, the onion pakore, the fowl cultet is good. Do not strictly try the sandwich. Its not even grilled. But the chowmein is good. Just to be a part of kolkata u must visit coffee house, but good food shouldn't be expected.

Quality of food has  gone down to the lowest point in the universe. Management n service is very poor. Cost is friendly. Only reason of visit, its a legendary arena where greater minds of Kolkata used to gather ''once". U can smoke inside, only +point. From me its a #TryOut.

What can be said about this place which others don't know. Nostalgic, awesome, fun, songs, adda... Everything can happen in here. The first time I entered, the awesome sounds of gossips were a pleasure to my ear.. I feel so nostalgic.. This place is just for everything, a romantic date, gossip, foolish adda, serious business... Everything.. I felt every item in here is perfectly priced and par quality. I would love to revive my memories anytime in this place.

A heritage place for Calcuttans......food is not very mind-blowing....just a great place to hangout with friends for a looong adda session over a cup of coffee and snacks .....and the best part is the waiters never ask you to empty the table no matter how long u sit without placing an order. Good for once a while and cheap too!!

It may be legendary it may be a famous place where you will find people of all age groups chilling chatting... And obviously  its a great smoking joint....
But if you talk about the food its not that great... Everything is average and its not that delectable... The servings are late....  Overall its a fine place to chill and hangout thats it...

The place needs no introduction!Anyone in Calcutta is familiar with the coffee house.Its a place where people of all ages hang out and no one would actually regret bunking their class and be here :)
It marks the heritage of Calcutta.I love the chicken sandwich and the cold coffee.Not that the fish afgani would disappoint you. Buying books is an excuse to visit the place and of course buying books from college street wouldn't complete your expedition if you don't visit Coffee House.It wouldn't offer you great service or a variety of food like the other cafes,but it has its own charm which is why people go back there :)

Whatever the current status be, whatever the quality be, whatever the service be, but this is a place which has place in every Bangali's heart - Coffee House, The place where the great and the greatest sat together, which is still carrying the huge memory of glory and of royalty... The cup plates and the chairs, the balcony, the same walls and hanging fans all witnessed the Golden era of Indian history. If you feel nostalgic at Indian museum, I feel the same over here everytime i come......
The only thing common I felt was the resonance of the Coffee House song of the great Manna De.....

This is the place where "Bangali" go for Adda or if i can put in a better way its about intellectual orgasm :p A place which is always bustling with people of all age groups. This place has a nostalgic charm of its own and it is a must visit place during your college and university days. Located at College Street it is frequented both by students and teachers all across West Bengal and serves as the place to sit over an economical cup of coffee and snacks. The Chicken Afghani is one of the signature dishes available here which is served with white bread loaves. There is nothing special about the coffee here... its all about sitting, chatting and sipping.

Coffee house is that one old school cafe , an adda of the antels of Boipara :) ... a heritage in its own sense.. Coffee house is that old school buliding, generally we head upstairs whenever we visit that place.. Chicken kaviraji is the only thing that has some taste, cause anything else you order is plain bland. Service is time consuming, and not tasty either. :/ But a really good place to sit and chat up.. perks being the fact that they let you smoke :D :P

Location and Description: The Kolkata Coffee House at College Street. It has a very old history. A very popular place. People from places comes to this place to just have a seat and enjoy the atmosphere. Lots of kolkata's old renowned people were here before. This place is at the main College Street which attracts everyone who comes there to buy books. 

Ambience and Staff: This is a very old and traditional place right from from 60 years or more. The walls of 1940s so are some fans. The entire design memorizes the 1947 scenes in mind. Lots of round and square tables with chairs. With also gallery above. Always crowded with people and difficult to find tables sometimes. The staffs are dressed with white uniform with white cap just like old days hence very polite and attends you quickly.

Food: If you reach this place and don't have a coffee then you are a foolish person. You can have all sort of breakfast to lunch items here. Specially the coffee with egg omelet and butter toast. The non veg items are also well made not so well as big restaurants but according to the place it is nice. Prices have been cheap always here. very affordable.

QNQ & Prices: QNQ is the same. not much to be expected. Prices are very reasonable

The Conclusion: It's a well known place from all. Even TV ads, Movie shootings and t.v serials are also shot here. Be a part of this place. Its a Adda for all the youngsters out there.

The ambiance of the balcony seating was the saving grace of an otherwise disappointing visit to this branch of ICH. Being an avid ICH fan and having visited the Bangalore, Jaipur outlets I was eager to check out this one, especially because of its heritage and history. The walls are filled with paintings and pictures that signify the heritage of ICH, its famous frequenters and its british architecture. There is nothing to write home about the fare they serve. The coffee which they call "HOT" was absolutely not and the cutlets were actually cold. But the place warrants a visit just for the old world charm and an experience of heritage

P.S.: I was especially disappointed with the coffee since I absolutely love the ICH Bangalore's coffee and am an unofficial ambassador of it.

Popularized to the rookies by a famous Bengali song by Manna Dey, the place is famous for accommodating the erudite (and the lesser ones too..!!!) and serving as an abode to intellectual and philosophical discourses. The coffee served here is revered to be the best in Calcutta by the inveterate coffee connoisseurs. If you are in here for a heated discussion on any subject and if you have ample time in your hand, the sandwiches and the cutlets would serve as the requisite snacks to strong beverages like coffee and tea. The behaviour of the staffs, dressed anachronistically but elegantly, may appear a bit boorish and conceited at times, but what more do you want when they don't, even for a single occasion, ask of you to "be considerate enough to vacate your table"...!!!

Visited it quite a number of times but this time I thought of writing a review.
This is not a place to talk about food or scrutinize the ambiance or the decor but it is all about the heritage  and that song of Legendary Manna Dey which will keep this place immortal.
Paid a visit last month and ordered Chicken Kaviraji and a glass of Infusion after that. In fact apart from Chicken Kaviraji, Cutlet and the Sandwiches there are really nothing that you can order to get a taste of the food. The Kaviraji platter is as usual was of okay type and the Infusion was nice to accompany our discussion which continued afterwards. The cold coffee with cream there is just like Bournvita mixed with milk and nothing else so please think twice before ordering it. Nothing special to mention about the ambiance as it remains noisy all the time with the tables being closely placed making the place a congested one. Al-tough the staffs aren't that polite and serving time is about 15-20 mins after you place the order, I like the waiters' uniform which gives a traditional feel to the place.

The Culinary intelligentsia of Calcutta. The Legacy defines its food. But not now, in that case. The special thing about Coffee House is that, after hitting the taste buds........the food directly hits your brain and activate your grey matter.

A MUST visit if you know about the legacy of Bengali intelligentsia.

This place is not about good food, great ambiance, warm welcome, quick service. This place is about heritage. It has been standing tall at the heart of Kolkata for god knows how many years. There are few places where college goers love to visit and Indian Coffee House is One such place. My mom's face gets a glow when she hears about me going to this place.

Its a bit tough to get a place and the waiters makes the visit more irritating with their late service. The "No Smoking" sign boards doesn't seem to matter.  I have tried CHICKEN CUTLET, MUTTON CUTLET, CHICKEN SANDWICH, COLD COFFEE WITH CREAM. The cutlets were served cold. The coffee may seem overpriced if you are not a CCD/BARISTA LAVAZZA goer. The sandwich was soft and better than those of monginis.

A place to dive into pool of old memories... School days, College days.... The place itself is historic, still maintains the old charm.... But finding table at time becomes difficult.... A nice place to rest and enjoy bengali snacks after hanging around in college street.... Food prices have increased which is justified but the quality has deteriorated little bit.... Good but I must say, "Coffee House er sei addata aaj aar nei..."

How can a place be the same from ages? From taste to ambience to the smoke in the air! Some places are stuck in time, and thank god that they are! As a change would have made it a player in the rat race of 1000 other places! The chicken afghani is to die for! Even the cold coffee, though served in a humble way, tastes really good and refreshing! The way to go and be!

Other than the charm and nostalgic feel nothing is good here.  The quality of the coffee has dropped down too low. But again just like you cant judge a book by its cover and never judge coffee house by its coffee. Just a place to hangout with friends. Food is too average quality. Its just a living legend. Its a place where even your parents went to. The staff is really fast and efficient but really weird at times.

Nostalgia, nostalgia and nostalgia!! The only reason why you should visit this place. The food is average and the ambiance might not appeal to you if you are a modern age CCDBarista goer. The prices are quite cheap though and perhaps the only place in Kolkata where you get a cold coffee for 30 bucks. Also, be prepared to inhale lots n lots of cigarette smoke since they do NOT have any kind of anti-smoking policy. 

My Suggestion: Try their Kabiraji and Cutlet, they still taste better than the rest :)

I have passed 19years of my life in college street and counting..so ts a second home for me.. Coffee House remained a special place for me always.. It made me feel like an adult.. All those bhat we had there.. now come to the review.. Food very average, service very much poor,and it's always hard to get a seat there.. So if u want to have some delicious food don't go there but if you love to chat endlessly then it's a must visit for you with all your best buddies... And as a youth you should visit coffee House once at least to relish the charm of coffee House and humming the tune of Manna Dey..black coffee and pakodha is a must pick three..

The most celebrated Coffee Shop in the city...the beverages and food they serve may not be liked by all...but Indian Coffee House has its own style. Infusion is simply tailor-made for the city intellectuals. You can have pocket-friendly glass of Cold Coffee with Cream here. But one must have the Mughlai Parata here. Among other dishes Baked Fish and Mutton Afghani are really tempting...but above all...it's a place where you can sit for a 'nikhaad bangali adda'...

Being ex-presidencian, we were frequent visitor of this place. We have tried here, fish kabiraji,cutlet,various sandwiches, cold coffee, pakora (veg and chicken ) etc. All were equally bad in taste.No no wait,their cold coffee was worst.To be honest, cutlets were not so bad in taste but they would mostly serve it cold.Pakoras had no taste, even after dipping those in sauce.
 Don't even dare to ask about their service. Sometimes they would even forget to take our orders and sometimes they would get on ours wick so badly. So unprofessional.
Price was affordable.
Don't want to go back even if get hungry at college street.But if want to go for a long conversation , this is the one place.But only after 2 p.m when the seating arrangement of the above portion will be open.

This place is only for people who wants to sit n talk for hours n hours nothing else i.e adda in bengali .
I have heard so much about it from my dad but i personally don't like this place . Though the balcony sits are really nice but so much more can be done with place like this .

The Indian Coffee House or formerly named The Albart hall is a heritage place of kolkata.
Brings you back the yesteryear.It was the place for intellectual and political addas (Hangout) . In the 70s student politics and the famous song by Manna dey made this place much more hyped.
The large wooden doors, a time worn staircase opens into a big hall buzzing with a voices with a hazz of smoke...the place for college goers.
This place has seen many of the well known personalities spending there time here over a cup of coffee. 
But the present scenario is totally different now coffee house lost its old charm. The place is very dirty.. The staff is very rude.
The food we ordered was chicken cutlet,chicken sandwiche,and hot coffee.. Very average in taste.
Its a sad think that one of the legendary place has lost its value..i went there with a expectation but eventually i was disappointed.. Maybe its my first and last visit over there.

A narrow door opening into a dark, paan stained staircase opening into a large airy room with ceiling fans dangling down from a room two floors high. Square tables and red plastic chairs. A suggestion- exit the room and climb up another flight of stairs for the balcony seating. Bag the seats next to the windows if possible. A fair bit of hand waving and calling later, you might luckily flag down a waiter. The plastic menu is neither extensive nor expensive. Ideal for the student pocket and for a quick (or maybe not that quick) bite after a hectic day haggling on college street. 
First timers tend to make the mistake of ordering the too-dry-sandwiches and sugary cold coffee (like I did) , look instead towards the oilier cutlets, samosas and chai that the regulars order. (I learnt it the hard way) I'm not promising you good food. But I will promise you an oddly good experience.

The first time I visited the Indian coffee house was in the winter of class 11- missing sports day in school to run away to college street and update my reading list with worn second hands. Maybe it was the situation that made it seem more romantic or just the charm of coffee house working on me, but sitting next to the wooden windows with warm afternoon sunlight pouring in and the bustle of the street below me floating up and through the windows is still one of the most distinct school memories that i have till date. 
To sum it up:
Slow service? Yes.
Poor quality food? Yes.
Too noisy? certainly. 
Will I be going back? Absolutely.

there cannot be a single bengali who hasnt visited Coffee House atleast once in his life. It was a hub for free & intellectual thinking men in the 50-60s. Uttam Kumar, Manna Dey, etc many celebrities have been frequent to this place. Its that nostalgia, that brand name that stills keep its running in the ages of Starbucks or CCD. Honestly, I never liked their Coffee but their Dishes are great, specially Chicken Afgani....

Coffee House also remind me of the 1st Generation Ceiling Fans, the sloppy & sloth waiters who wil take 15mins to wake up and take your order, 5mins to walk through the floor to the kitchen and then after 30mins come out with your order. People have accepted it to be that way and hence hasnt changed much. 

In the world when people are talking about Quick Service Restuarants, Fine-Diniing Resturants they always had their own attitude and niche

The classical Indian cofee house is very special to all college students. Its the naustalgia and authentic flavors of kolkata. Taste of food is average. Taste of coffee is also average. But, wat u get there is an ambience of history and naustalgia.Time spends in seconds if u r with ur frnds or mates. Gives a good feel. Must visit this place at least once.

There are some things one must do before one dies, and doing coffee house is perhaps one of them, especially if you have the Calcutta Connect or if you happen to visit this city. Its a city which lives and breathes an overpowering never-ending colonial nostalgia. Its like a stupor which gets to you easily and stays with you for long, and coffee house is one such place which will induce this feeling into you - whether you are the ubiquitous Calcuttan or otherwise.
I studied at the university so I have fond memories of this place. Those were the days when I was just exploring the city, and needless to say, an adda with friends here meant the world! The fun came at a very low pocket pinch too, hence it became a haunt for the new university-going clique.
It is a big place, don't be daunted by the rickety staircase, and also do notice the posters on the walls as you take the staircase. Each moment is to be inhaled and felt and remembered, mind you. So soak in as you walk in. There are two floors, the house of commons and the house of lords. The place is mostly packed to capacity so you may have to wait till you get a place. The old post-colonial building will grin back at you with crestfallen grandeur of the bygone era. The waiters will greet you dressed in white turbans, they are snooty mind you, for this is a heritage place!
Well, by now you well know that coffee house is really not about coffee. Actually the coffee here sucks! It is watery, sugary, often luke warm, served in glass tumblers, and comes in late! Try the mughlai paratha and chicken cutlet. They are quite good. My favorites are the gravy chow and the mutton kabiraji cutlet, it is eggy, oily, sinful and comes with an awesome gravy - nothing like anything that you have tasted before! 
Expect a very slow service and rude waiters. But like I said, it is really not about the coffee or the food! Enjoy!

Yes, definately this place is in itself a piece if history. A favourite hangout place for the CU college goers.... it has seen many of the well known personalities spending their time here over a cup of coffee accompanied by cutlet. But come to present scenario and you will find this place very dirty and in need of upkeep. The stairs leading to the hall are stained with paan spits. The coffee cups and the dishes are dirty and some them even chipped. The staff also  seem to have come out of history books...no sense of hospitality. I went there once and probably that was my last visit as well.

Coffee house is more than just another eatery to colg street goers!! Hours after hours of chit chatting over cups of coffee, the pretty nice omelettes and pakoras, its a joint of a diffrnt nature that only frequent visitors can appreciate!! One of the bery few places that nevr prohibited smoking! :-P 
But yes, there are cons. The service is pathetic, too crowded throughout the day and food is of mediocre quality, nothing much to write home about!!

Have been here many times when I was in Scottish Church College. Well, this place is famous amongst students coz you can order 1 coffee and sit for hours n chat. And its very very light on the pocket. Try their chicken omlette. Once many of us went there n ordered 1 plate chicken sandwich. Each one of us paid 7 rupees in changes and the waiter collected it on the tray on which he was serving......imagine sooo many coins he had to pick :D old memories! Visit here for its atmosphere and typically for an intellectual one! :)

Visited Indian Coffee House yesterday at around 2:40 pm.
It was very crowded but the waiters promptly found us a table.
Coming to the ambience, nothing great but gives you a feeling of nostalgia. Tha paintings are good though. :)

Now. The food.
We ordered :-
1) Mutton Afghani - it is just a mutton cutlet ( big portion) served in a tomato gravy. The gravy is sweet amd garlicky. So if you dont like sweet curries and you are not a "Khati Bangali", don't try this. You wont like it. But I found it delicious.

2) Bread and butter : This is not the kind of bread we get from the bakeries. The bread is the kind which is generally served in tea stalls. Goes great with Afghani.

3) Chicken Afghani : Same gravy with a large piece of chicken cutlet.

4) Chicken Kabiraji : Good.

5) Moglai Paratha : Now this is a heavy stuff. One person cannot finish it alone. Very heavy and very oily (yes that is how it is supposed to be) but tasty. I did not like the aloo r tarkari, which was served with it.

6) Fish fry : Not bad.

7) Hot coffee : Nice.

8) Cold coffee with cream : Dont miss out on this. Its different and tasty. The aroma of the coffee is superb.

All this had cost us only 315 bucks.

The food is very heavy. So think before you order.

Recommended. :)

I visited this place a few days back for the 1st time (ya I know, being a kolkatan this comes up as a shock, but be that as it may). Had heard of this place since childhood and hence was always curious what this place would actually be like! Well as it turns out, it was just an ordinary coffee shop, no fancy decor or anything, but it would b foolish to judge it by that because its ambience is in its history! I went with a couple of friends and we ordered a chicken omlette, a chicken kaviraji,mutton afgani and 3 cold coffee. Oh here one thing that needs mention is getting the attention of the waiter to take the order can be a bit of a hassle as it happened with us! So anyways, after placing our orders we chatted for a while as the order took some time to arrive and our chats are pretty loud mind you but no one seems to mind, so this place gets a point from me for being a good place for hanging out with friends! When the orders arrived, a bite from each order made it clear to us that the mutton afgani was the best of the lot! The chicken kaviraji was good, but even its thunder was stolen by the afgani and the chicken omlette did not even come close! We found the afgani so good that we ordered another one! Then we turn our attention to the cold coffee and that was a bit of a disappointment to be frank. 1st of all, they serve it in glasses which are used typically by road side tea stalls along with a pretty ordinary straw! The absence of a more presentable glass and the bendable cousin of straw did sting us a bit here. And then when we took a sip of the stuff, it didnt do anything to improve its impression on us. The coffee was nothing extraordinary and we wondered whether we would have been better off ordering the cold coffee with cream. Another thing I noticed is that people violate the "no smoking" sign openly, but I won't hold it against the place cause that just might work out in my favour some day! ;)

So all in all its an average place with no fancy ambience and pretty ordinary coffee, but I would still go back to this iconic coffee shop of kolkata even if its only for the afgani and hanging out with friends in carefree way!

I wish I was living in the 50s-60s... when people were real and knew how to behave, dress up and eat. Elegant ! And Gentlemanly ! And women were burlesque and had an air of charm and seduction around them. This place would have been just the place then for me. To drink my tea, to eat, to indulge....

Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata, Indian Coffee House has featured in my trip everytime I come to Kolkata, unforgettably. The old rustic charm of the place, starting from the stairs to the hallroom, where the walls are adorned with little pieces of art from not so famous yet creative artists. The place has been there since the British colonial times, and it has been a favourite with many a cinema artists, actors, directors, authors, journalists and always the young college students and lovers.

The food here is still so delicious and absolutely perfect all the time !! And for that price to get that quantity without compromising on the quality is just amazing ! We were 3 people (2 big time foodies and a non foodie) and we wound up our bill in just 330 bucks !! I'm sure if I had gorged to my capacity it still wouldn't exceed 350 for 2 people. And the taste in all of these ! I just loved it.

College street and shopping for books is in itself a delight, and good books along with great food always make the day much better and the trip worthwhile. A must go !! ♥♥♥

Service- Good (don't make you wait for hours) 
Ambiance- Good enough

Was a good experience in total and is a really good and pocket friendly place to sit down with friends or family. Sometimes it might get hard to get a seat for some time but wont cause you much of trouble. A must visit place if you are in Kolkata for few days.
But the coffee needs to improve :P

To visit the Indian Coffee House and not have coffee would be a sin. Even if you aren't a coffee fan, you should try out the cold coffee and may be, with cream. It's really nice. The chicken omelette and the chicken sandwich are my favourite. One may try out the chicken kaviraji or the same things in mutton. Unlike the generation before me, I don't have any nostalgia attached to this place. But I am sure if I studied here at Presidency, I would surely visit this place regularly.

Large wooden doors, a time-worn staircase opens into a big hall buzzing with voices in a haze of smoke - the Albert Hall, famously known as the Coffee House. Coffee House is located just opposite of the Presidency College on College Street. It’s crowded throughout the day & finding a place to sit will be a real challenge here. Now coming to the food ... I always went for Hot Coffee with Cream along with Chicken Sandwich or Tea with Onion Pakkora / Singara. You may also try Veg Cutlet but avoid Chicken Afghani, as it was just a Chicken Cutlet in tomato ketchup gravy. Chinese section was more horrible. Taste of the food will never satisfy you, but you are here not for the food, it’s the ambiance you are going to eat.

One of the city's heritage restaurants. Love, friendship and what not has blossomed here over the years. Songs have been written and sang in its grace. That's the image of Coffee House people will hold in front of you.

However in my experience,
One of the most overrated places in the city. 
Over priced food served in decent quantity. 
Nothing great worth its hype. 
Good service however.
Visit only for the feel of antiquity.

One of those classy old calcutta coffee places in the city. Nothing to extraordinary or extravagent about this place. The place is filled with the old calcutta feeling, the old chairs, artistic people and lively college students. The coffee here is too good for me. So is the grilled fish. Prices are like too affordable. One of the best place in the city for a group adda. 
ONE WORD OF CAUTION THOUGH : If you don't smoke or are concerned about passive smoking avoid this place. 
For adda and coffee and evening snacks there couldn't be a better place and lets not forget the legendary song by Manna Dey about the place.

I rated it 2.5 just because of the memories. Spent my 3 years in college having great memories here. The less said about the food is better. It is probably the worst you'll ever find, even the coffee is something to pass on. But the great thing about this place is the heritage, tha adda culture, something you'll find nowhere else. You order cups of coffee and spend the entire day with your friends looking down memory lane. Nobody bothers you here. I would'nt mind going back again ana again (not for the food though).

The food is average (competent enough, and quite cheap, but nothing special), but the ambience is amazing, and unique, especially if you opt for the balcony seating, as we did. Be warned, though: This place is very popular, and the wait for a table can be long, no matter what time of day it is. Food wise, unless you enjoy faux Chinese (nothing wrong with that), I'd recommend you stick to the traditional Calcutta snacks like fish fry and mutton cutlet. Visited this restaurant in the month on April 2014 on an official visit to the city.

No body goes to Indian Coffee House for its food or beverage. It is a part of Calcuttans'  lifestyle to visit the Coffee House once in a while (or everyday during a particular phase of their lives). A huge hall, interspersed with table-plus-four-chairs units, which eventually grow into one-table-innumerable-chairs units as friends add up to each group. The tallest ceiling I have ever seen in any form of restaurant with ceiling-fans drooping down from long metallic rods: whether the fans revolve or not catches no one's fancy! White uniform clad waiters with turbans, walking past and peeping subtly at each table and ever-ready with their pink order-slips. It is a different world in the Coffee House. You breathe a mixture of smoke from various cigarette brands, and bidis as well, and all you hear is a constant buzzing mono-tune, which actually is a concoction of the most important discussions that probably are taking place in the given time in Calcutta. 
I would never stop if I start about Coffee House. Let me just say that Coffee House taught me to become a connoisseur of black-coffee, and never miss the chicken omelet of this kitchen.

This historical place serves its unique blend of coffee in all over kolkata. It is unknown to many people that this is the only place which supplies coffee to the governor of west bengal. Apart from its coffee, this place carries with it innumerous nostalgia from the past. Starting from eminent writers,directors to poets, freedom fighters...evryone had a frequent visit to this place in their times. Even now, the inside environment hasnot changed a lot. Those square tables with 4 chairs, the bulletin board, the large oil paintings and moreover the traditional signboard outside still attracts thousands of people every day. The college life would be rather incomplete if one hasnot visited coffee house once or twice in their entire college or university life..spcially for the CU pupils.

Well, it seemed that they prepared a normal cuppa coffe and put it right inside the fridge and voila ! there's your 'cold' coffee. The sandwiches were average, you can do better with some more chicken and cheese. Please dont visit this place for food. Go there if you are looking for some place where you can sit and enjoy long hours of addas.

Coffee House is all about Heritage, it sums up all. I have spent 10 years in College Street area but surprisinly haven't visited the place even once that time as I was just a kid that time! But after that I have visited the place number of times, don't go here if you are only a fooddie without some emotional attachment of Bengal nostalgia or can not tollerate people who smoke. Because food is not everything here. This time we went for signature cold coffee with cream, it was good. Egg sandwitch was Ok, so was the chilly chicken and fried rice.

I have been here twice during my college days. This place is special to many people and many memories associated with this place. My grandfather aged close to 90 still has fond memories of this place, so u can guess that its one of d oldest and probably one of the very first cafes of Kolkata. Now, the interiors are nothing worth mentioning and these people have not taken much effort in revamping the place. Probably this is the USP of ICH as it maintains the flavor of Old Kolkata. I cannot comment much on the food as i had only tried thier chicken cutlet both the times. Service is a bit slow. However, its a good place to catch up with your friends and you can sit here as long as you want.

Everyone from Calcutta must write about Coffee House and I cannot be an exception having spent many a lunch hour there during my 3 years while a student in Presidency College.
The primary reason why I used to go there along with the rest of the assorted journeymen is the cost effectiveness of the food - Indian Coffee House was and still is a middle class person's oasis. But it doesn't mean that there is nothing about the food - it was a treat to be indulged on - for a middle class young student, with little money in his wallet, once upon a time.
What were the delicacies that I used to indulge myself in? Chicken/Mutton Kaviraji, Moglai Paratha, and if I am not mistaken, they used to serve mini Hamburgers too. Before leaving Calcutta in Feb'14, I once again paid a customary visit to the college and the Coffee House - I noticed that they don't serve those tasty mini burgers anymore. I tried out Chicken Afghani for the first time - it was Chicken Kaviraji in thick tomato gravy. But the prices and the quality has remained the same. What has also not changed is the poor and highly delayed service of the Coffee House waiters - it's just perhaps that they are too few in number compared to the mass of humanity which trooped in then and now...

There's a reason why you keep coming back to coffee house. Certainly not the food or service but for something more. Chat away your hours, smoke, throw the butt on the floor. Endless cups of infusion, chicken sandwich to accompany it. It is shabby dirty but then again your graduation days lingers thick in the air. Yes, you guessed it right, you keep coming back because they serve memories and nostalgia too.

They take almost eternity to serve food. We ordered Chicken Afgani and Grilled Bhetki... but to be frank both tasted more or less same. We ordered cheese omelet but they said that they were running out of egg... I mean seriously. The tomato soup was not bad. Finally we ordered coffee.. normal coffee...and after 40 minutes it was served that too not hot rater just warmed coffee.

I am all for upholding the heritage and culture of my city.   (Kolkata) Indian coffee house certainly bears testimony to all of that rich culture that Kolkata has. I am sure it was a great cafe during its time, but now it really puts all that great legacy subject to disgrace and shame. The food is extremely average and the crockery they use has probably been there since India achieved independence. The waiters are extremely rude and come to take orders after you have spent an half an hour trying to get them to hear you. Even after all this, they hover around for tips and make you feel irritated. Since my university is nearby, I am sometimes forced to accompany my friends to eat here. The only good thing of coffee house is its fish fingers. The rest is just awful.

If you are a bong then the name " Indian coffee house " shouldnt be anythng new to ur ears.. 
Famous for its coffee and adda , the coffee house has managed to keep up the same spirit of people chatting up over a cup of coffee and cigarettes.. the food however is just okay... you get a plate ( 4 pieces ) of chicken sandwich for just rs38 .. which is very pocket friendly indeed.. the mutton sandwich disappoints highly though .. being tasteless and lacking spice... the coffee ( we ordered cold coffee ) was just enough to beat the heat.. nothing extraordinary... the service is poor and u wud have to wait fr 15-20 mins or sometimes even half an hour for a waiter to attend you... we had to ask for water thrice before it was given to us... 
Overall its a good place to chitchat wid frnds over a cup of coffee ... expect anythng more and you ll be disappointed .

I heard about this place from my childhood and always wanted to go there. The got the chance when I was in class eleven.

I was buying some books and decided lets go to coffee house. We waited for about 10mins before getting the our seats and we have only infusion. Till then i visited that place a lot times mainly when i was in clg street or meeting some friends from presidency or medical college.

If you want to eat/drink here this is not the place for you, in that case walk few minutes more and go to paradise for some sharbat. You will be blown i bet. Once i met a journalist there who is writing about various coffee places throughout India and she told me this was literally the worst coffee she ever had.

There is absolutely no ambient. The place is dirty. The traditional dressed waiters are slower than a snail. I always wondered how they get there jobs here and someone told me they got it through the generations.

If you want to smoke and have a long chat with your friends, this is the place for you. You can have cigarettes after cigarettes and order a coffee in between so that the waiters don't show you the door. My first cigarette was here. I am not a smoker but i smoke when i am in coffee house.

But this is Coffee House, and honestly my ratings do not matter here. The name evokes nostalgia in any Bong, and myself being a student of Medical College it's a very nearby place to hang out and for endless hours of adda. Some of the food like the kabiraji cutlet, the cold coffee are tasty too. 
An ideal place to forget your daily life complexities and lose yourself in the old world charm of our wonderful city.

Indian Coffee House a big place both in terms of name and also by size.
It is popularly known as the Coffee House, located just opposite of Presidency College(College Street) and is a regular hangout for students,ex-students,scholars,directors,artists,writers. 
The coffee house is famous for its adda sessions, and as the breeding place of several political and cultural personalities and movements. Many people come here just for the sake of adda and just being a part of the long talking sessions.
This place achieved a position in almost all the Bengali's hearts after Manna Dey's special "Coffee House er shei addata" , a real tribute to this historic place.

It has seen many ups and downs and currently its not that much famous as it lags far behind in the competitions of the CCDs,Baristas etc. But the charm,curiosity and the very "name" of Coffee house is the base of its existence.

I had visited this place for about 50 times :P
Just made a visit today, as usual got myself comfortable in the balcony section. The servers dressed as ardalis(in white) were  just as late to take an order as possible. :D The time of making an order to getting your food served is a good 30 minutes long, which gives you a good time for addas. Today was also no different, I ordered a chicken kaviraji,a muglai paratha,a chicken sandwich and 2 cold coffees for myself and my friend.

The muglai paratha was very oily but yet tasty enough and the vegetable attached with it was real bad. The chicken kaviraji was also way oily but very crispy and really yummy :) The mustard and tomato sauce also added to its taste. Chicken sandwich was soft and had some proportions of chicken but it was a bit salty for my taste. I liked the cold coffee though, its nothing special but felt really nice to the throat. 


This place is just not about the taste of the food or the decor or the server's behaviour but its about the history and charm behind it. Sitting in the tables where once some famous personalities used to sit really makes me have a thrilling experience every time I come here. A 3.5 pointer just for that only. A must recommended for people having similar thoughts like mine.

Enjoy :)

I have first heard about this place from manna dey's song.. since then wanted to visit this place. My wishes came true in college when i finally decided to go there withy friends. The place is dirty.. not not pleasing to the eyes. But it has an ambience.. dnt know if i should say good or bad.. bt a little different.. u will see people of all age sitting together and eating something.. the noise of that place makes it uniqui. Chinese food is average. Fish finger, fish fry, moghlai paratha,kabiraji are good.. price is readonable.. but ironically one will get the worst coffee there.. irrespective of cold or hot coffee...

This place is a heritage place of Calcutta as far as the intellectual tradition of Kolkata is concerned. it was the hub of student politics during 70s and Manna de's famous song on Coffee House made this place much more famous, i think. 
We five people went College street to buy our book from JU. The architecture is similar to that of British heritage buildings. The ceiling is quite high. 
Now coming to the food. We had cold coffee, chicken sandwich and Mutton Kaviraji. The sandwich was not bad, only one item I liked over there. Cold coffee was not up to the mark. and Kaviraji was too oily and the tomato sauce was horrible. Service is not prompt as Waiters don't care to be prompt and swift. If you have enough time to enjoy your leisurely meal, then you may like your adda over a cup of tea and cigarette. Otherwise, the food quality is not up to the mark.

where do i begin ??
heard a lot of this place from dad about how the  many famous people used to visit this place ( either they had no sense of taste or they were too engrossed in their own affairs or the place was actually good that time ).......
first time i went there ( mentally singing coffee houser shei adda ta aaj ar nei ) .ohh the place is dirty .... come on akarshik its an old reputed place like antique like ... well considered that ....
finding a place to sit is a real headache here 
thanks to presidency, Sanskrit college and so many more nearby the place is ever crowded with college students smoking and chatting .....no they r not asked to leave if not eating . its the best chat room ill give you that !!
so many times we friends had to stand for 10 -20 min to get a table 
the waiters are somewhat traditionally dressed ... but boy are they slow.....
it takes them over 30 min to deliver orders and many a times they are out of supplies 
the price is reasonably low ill tell you that 
but the greatest irony lies in the fact that the coffee they serve is ONE OF THE WORST YOU'LL EVER HAVE
stupid pansa coffee
the chow mein i can safely say is good 
so is the kabiraaji 
but i got furious when they got me my chicken sandwich ........it was nothing more than bread butter and a few boiled chicken stands ..pathetic !!!!!!
-----------------------------
in a nut shell
bad waiters 
bad coffee /sandwich 
fairly good chinese 
not so eager to visit a lot

Four friends had a plan to go to Coffee House. Scratch that.

Four Friends had a plan to THE Indian COFFEE House, because they were thinking of past, and wondering what's become of the place. 

One me tried desperately to stop them. She enticed. She cajoled. But the remaining three were smarting from a Mohan Bagan defeat, and the sole East Bengal girl was ignored in favor of infusion and chicken omelette. 

They reached, seated themselves, and waited for the server to bring in the menu card. The server was least bothered, and showed them the wall where the big menu was hanging. They chose the following - Fish Fry. Chicken Omelette, Chicken Sandwich, Cold coffee WITH ice cream, Hot coffee with cream, cold coffee WITHOUT ice cream. 

Waiter said - "Nothing but the coffees and fish fry is available." Reluctantly, the quartet told him to bring the same.

After fifteen minutes, he came back, and with a burgeoning sense of pride told them that Fish Fry wasn't available either, and do they want Onion Pakoras?

No thank you, and thanks for the generally tasteless coffee too! Especially the hot one, which was the worst of the lot.


----- 06 Mar, 2013 -----

This is a piece of Kalchaar. Kolkatan culture to say the very least. I have had virtually everything on the menu, and apart from the chicken omelette and at times the chicken sandwich, nothing is really worth recommending. During my college days, this was a place for nonstop cigarette smoking, infusion drinking (cheapest item in the menu) and eating chicken sandwiches. The quality of adda has gone down and the service is BAD to say the very least. However, come here to be Kolkatan, feel what being a part of a cultural whole is like. There has been so many occasions when I have come here and started arguing with someone over Kafka or Foucault, without knowing that individual's name. That is Coffee House... the essential place for the Bengali to show his cultural inclination.

This heritage place is a usual fanfare among the students of Calcutta University, Presidency and other schools & colleges in and around College Street. It was a bright, warm and sweaty summer and I was tired as hell shopping for books, when I decided to visit this rich Bengali heritage for a quick bite. Old tidy staircase, big crowded room, and it's a bliss to find it in its originality. I had to wait for 15 mins to find myself a table, sat down comfortably, and took me 5 more mins to realize that I would have to get the attention of the waiter to place my order. I ordered a Cold Coffee and a Chicken Sandwich which took 15 mins to arrive. However the taste was usual fare, but I went there not for the food but for the feel of the warmth of this heritage place. Honestly, there is nothing much to write about the food , apart from the fact that it should be tried out once... Reviews are certainly not for the food, but for the old world charm woven in it, which i would ever cherish...

Coffee house is one of the most internationally well known places in Kolkata. Till date,I have been here three times and have had different experiences everytime (my last visit being today itself). 
My first visit was 2 years ago with my parents, and the experience was bad due to various factors. It was rush hour and as it was crowded inside,we had to stand for half an hour just to get a table. The waiters werent the least bothered to take our order,thereby wasting more time. All we ordered was coffee and after yet another half an hour when we got the coffee,it was not upto the mark. There is a fleet of stairs leading up to the eatery and I must say,the betel leaf stains on the walls,over a hundred meter boxes coupled with thousands of wires alongside the stairs can easily put anyone off,in a scary way. There are "No Smoking" signs all over the place but none of the waiters,nor the officals say anything to those who openly flout this. Being a non smoker,passively smoking for as long as I sit inside coffee house,is a bad experience.
The second time I went there is on 15/01/14 around noon, with my friend and the experince was much better than before. Not only were gutka stains removed,the walls were replainted,though the mess of wires remained same. Coffee house opens at noon,each day and within 5 minutes it surprisingly becomes full. Unable to find any place in the main area,we went to the balcony which is a bit less crowded as each item costs Rs2 more there. A waiter took our order shortly after we sat. We ordered cutlets and cold coffee. After half an hour, came the two cutlets,presented surprisingly well. They were cooked just then and fried really well,served with mustard,sweet tomato sauce and salads. It was a delight to have and we liked it a lot. Before we finished eating the cutlets,came the cold coffee,topped with natural cream(not processed) this was again,a delight to have. The bill came to Rs148(for 2) so the pocket pinch was quite less. The waiters always expect to be given tips and dont leave unless they get it from you. The problem of passive smoking was always there whenever I went,including this time,so thats another downside. Overall the experience was good,so I went again today. We tried the fish fingers(most expensive item on the menu) along with our favorite cutlet and cold coffee. The food was a delight to have but the enjoyment was spoilt when the waiter brought another family to our small table (due to lack of space) while we hadnt finished yet. I feel that coffee house is good for its pricing and heritage era feel but it has downsides too,making it an average place.

Stopped by at Coffee house after a tiring day of buying fat academic books. I have to admit, the staircase can put people off, especially the betel leaf stains and the political party posters. Plus at times shady looking people loiter at the entrance to the staircase. The first floor was full so my friend and I had to sit in the balcony area. I personally felt that the first floor offers more of an old world charm than the balcony. the balcony was filled with mainly college students.
Throughout my visit, I basically had to passively smoke the cigarette fumes of the people sitting in the surrounding tables. Being a non smoker, that was kind of irritating. But then smoking is part and parcel of coffee house.
Service is very slow. Another trademark. We ordered two cold coffees with cream and two chicken cutlets.
The food arrived after about 30 minutes. The cutlets were piping hot. They were presently quite well, with sauce, mustard and freshly chopped onions at the side. It was quite tasty, but I personally felt that it was fried a bit too deeply. I had a hard time cutting it with a fork and knife.
The cold coffee with  cream came in a small glass tumbler with a straw. My friend and I both liked the taste a lot. I only wished they cud serve in bigger tumblers; the quantity seemed a little too less.
The bill came up to be about 148 rupees, quite reasonable as compared to CCD. The prices of the food in the balcony area is  2 rupees more than that in the main area.
Coffee house is a nice place to revisit the old times, to relax and unwind after a hectic day of buying books. However, it would be best to avoid it during the rush hours.

I do not have the courage to review this hallowed institution. Hence sharing my experiences only - it was a cold December morning that took me to College street for buying books. I couldnt resist a visit here. The food was impressive - sandwiches, mutton afghani, chicken kabiraji, grilled fish and samosas. The ambience extraordinary. One humble request - please replace the plastic chairs by beth er chairs or wooden ones. Will greatly enhance the old age feel.

Coffee house is one of the " 1001  things to do when in Kolkata list ". One of the oldest cafes, yet a favorite among all the teenagers as well as the elders. You will never find this place empty however, Ever jostling with all sorts of people . Though there has been inductions of various new cafes like cafe coffee day, costa coffee etc. This place never seems to run out of business. With a wide array of snacks to choose from starting from fish friers to gravy chowmein, one can be sure to satisfy their taste buds and of course quench their thirst with milk coffee or cold coffee or infusion.
If you are in Kolkata and have not been to the Indian Coffee House, well then you have not seen Kolkata.

About the food, it just average and ok for it's price, and the coffee isn't that great also, it tastes like the one we get at Indian Railway. Ideal place for adda with friends.

I gave this branch of coffee house a 3.0 against a 2.5 for the other branch simply because of the excessive space and the number of customers. This place is filled with the "aatel"s of Kolkata and the discussions held here are good enough to reform our country. How they people carry out such discussions over such quality of food and coffee is my personal engima. I mention this because just like its Jadavpur counterpart, the only good thing here is its warm cofefe and chicken sandwich. The fish fry has a hard thick coating that you should ideally not eat and the cold coffee is not nice. But hey, who needs food when you have food for thought?

I hail from a place where I can find a good number of Indian coffee houses. So I am the part of coffee house tradition. The place is essentially famous for its amazing coffee. The food menu varies from place to place in coffee houses. Kolkata served good fish dishes along with the traditionally famous coffee. The place looks great just like u saw them in photographs. And people should never complain about the cleanliness of this place, it  should be in this fashion.
But surprisingly the coffee served here the day I went was unhappily bad. Maybe the days luck. But I always recommend coffee house for the best coffee around.

I f you are in college street and want to spend some quality talking time with your friends or anyone, be here.

Highly recommended.

Having lived outside Bengal for years, I belong to the category of people who have only heard about Coffee House (from my parents). I very well understood at that point of time, that it's something like a chip imbided in the system of a Kolkata-baashi, even if he's not a foodie.

So, on my recent visit to College Street to collect some brain-jamming and spine-breaking books, my parents took me there. I had heard about the place so much that I had read the reviews here and so, knew the place is in its era of decedance.

But surprisingly, I wasn't disappointed. Rather the place really lifted my spirits. Yes, the entrance of the building is a big turn-off and so, are the betel-stained staircases (one never expects a heritage Kolkata place, talked about in connection to the intellectuals, to be in this state) but when you enter the place, you are definitely struck by a feel of good ol' Calcutta. 

We settled on the second floor...as the first was fully packed. The crowd was a pleasing one...from college-goers to corporate people, from housewives to love-birds. It truly seemed like an assembly of Calcuttans.

We placed our order : Chicken Kabiraji (mutton was unavailable), Fish Fry, Coffee, Cold Coffee with Cream. The service is damn slow. They made us wait for around half an hour and my parents even said, their coffee was cold. I enjoyed mine. It was truly delicious, served in a simple glass tumbler, but was really so less in quantity. The Kabiraji was delicious too, and so, was the Fry but it was fried a bit too deep, making it hard. 

I also, truly agree with the section of reviews dealing with the smoking issue. There are "No Smoking" boards visible all over the place but people are constantly seen doing the opposite.Even there were butts under our table. Folks! please remove those boards. You are ridiculing yourself. 

But, the most pleasing sight is the uniformed waiters with their turbans. Actually, its these people who bring out the charm of the good ol' city. They so genuinely and warmly smile at you.

The place really needs to pull its socks up and focus on renovation and hygience and then, they are way to go. Restore the charm through ambience and decoration and you'll do wonders!

The nostalgia has been smudged totally!
No more of that old charm works here.
Of broken building and chairs and dirty plates, Coffee House has almost debarred me.

I really do not like the food here. I only stick to the cold coffee with cream which I feel is decent.
The fritters and fries are uncooked or burnt , wont suit your palate.
Coffee House more or less only emsembles for a quick adda. The worst part is the waiters even ask you to leave the table which is pretty rude :(

Happened with me many a times and I seriously DID NOT like it. Let alone the food, this kind of behaviour calls for a complain but sigh no one to even care!

Thats how Coffee House has now become hence, I seldom visit.

Worst service!!! Even the food was okay given the price, the staff serving us was too rude. Even after telling him a number of times to take the order, he did not pay much notice and top of that when he came finally he came he told rudely he did not heard us calling though we were sitting at a table right next to the reception. Then we had to wait for around 45 mins for just a plate of mughlai paratha and chicken kaviraji. It was not as if the whole place was streaming with crowd. Unexpectedly that day on the first floor most of the tables were empty.

One of the oldest joints in the world. You find people from different walks and professions coming here for intense adda sessions which never seem to stop . Ambience is one of the best no doubt.
Coming to the staff , they are horrible and rude so you gotta give them the same things in terms of behaviour. Food aint that great Cold Coffee was  pathetic , Mutton Cutlet and Chicken Afghani were good.
Overall an average experience.

We had gone in with a lot of nostalgia related expectations, and perhaps to go there for the heck of it. Having done PG in Calcutta, I had never visited the place. My wife, a C.U. grad, had visited once with her dad. So, it was imperative, even if only for the cultural and heritage aspect, to pay a visit. We walked up the staircase on a pre Puja 2013 afternoon.
The place was a bit over crowded, but that was par for the course. We managed to find a 2 seater on the first floor. Several groups and individuals were blissfully puffing away, under No Smoking signals. May be that could be expected, too, we said to each other. After all, this is a joint for the fertile brains of this city, who could perhaps, be allowed to violate a petty law.
The cultery and the glasses were not too clean, but we were on a book hunting trip, so thankfully, we had our package water bottles, and could avoid the oily glasses.
We ordered fish cultet, mixed noodles, mixed fried rice, chilly chicken (as no other variant from the menu was available) and cold coffee.
The food was, well, made of below average ingredients, but the price, too, was on the lower side. The cold coffee was okay.
But the most irritating part was the service. The waiters, at least two of them waiting on the left balcony, were both chewing pun and nuts, as is wont of their particular community. As our waiter confirmed my order, a few pellets of nut and betel were hurled towards me, and one landed on my right forearm. Later, as he served our food, he loudly introduced each dish to us by its name, all the while deftly but brazenly holding the betel leaf concoction in the crevices of his buccal chamber. We prayed our food be spared any betel flavoured spray. I looked hard, and thankfully, as far as I could see through my myopia-reducing spectacles, no visible particle came out of his mouth.
In the end, when I complained about the experience to the manager, he sorrowfully chuckled, but could not assure or promise to improve the situation. Clearly, he had no authority over the waiters.
To anyone willing to pay the first visit, I would advise him to visit there with the expectations befitting a railway platform eatery, albeit boasting a sepia tinted culture.

Finally had the chance to visit the Indian Coffee House on College Street in the course of pandal hopping on Oshtomi. For a first timer like me who had heard about 'Coffee House' all her life and had visualized it as a place brimming with the intelligentsia, Coffee House in its new avatar with the present crowd was a bit of a let downer. However, I decided to let that feeling pass and started noticing the crowd around me. Most were dropping in for a quick bite in the middle of pandal hopping. However I was intrigued by a few tables of men in their late sixties, clearly catching up on old times and that's when I realised, the Coffee House is less of a cafe and more of an institution in itself. For the old timers, catching up with friends sitting around the same table week after week is nothing short of a ritual. The staff were modernly dressed, and the one serving us was pretty prompt and had a smile on his face all the while. We ordered for the chicken sandwich, the chicken cutlet and cold coffee with cream. The chicken sandwich was a plateful and with generous amount of chicken, however, with just salt and pepper. The chicken cutlet was a bit too deep fried, and had started to get really hard at the corners. I liked the cold coffee, though it came in a small glass tumbler, and kind of finished even before you can take the taste in. However, as I said, being more of an institution, Coffee House is more about the experience than about the food. Only one complaint, I felt they should not put up 'No Smoking' signs all around the place when smoking is a cult thing here. The 'No Smoking' signs are made a mockery of, and there's no use putting them up if the same cannot be strictly enforced. Overall, Coffee House was a good experience, with the bill coming to Rs. 510/-, and doing considerable good to our tummies.

A decent place for passing time with your friends. The food is not that good. Even the coffee is nothing special. I cannot understand why the onion pakodas are always cold. The chowmein also is decent. I visited this place a few times but never had a chance of tasting the non-veg dishes (since I went with vegetarian friends), but I’v heard that their kabiraji cutlet and the mughlai dishes are good. They really don’t have a lot of options for vegetarians.
People do complain about the staff, but I feel they are not that bad. I never had a bad experience with them.
Apart from all that, the environment is nice. Specially the second floor of the building. And do take note of all the paintings on the wall. I feel that the paintings really build up the ambiance of this place.

This is the umpteenth time I'm attempting to review this outlet...my previous attempts have led to successive spells of YAAAAAAAWWWNS and eye rubbings...which led me to opt out..well,there's nothing new to go gaga about this place..the same o'l giddy intellectual ambience..encompassed with a VAST SEPULCHRE of fumes(from u know what)...the same o'l cacophony of variously pitched voices,in which your conversation with the person accompanying you becomes a dumb mime show..(because your voice is drowned)..

Well,regarding the food..I only ordered a cup of coffee(did I,did I not?),...
No,I'm sure I did order coffee...but what I was served..tasted like a "very popular Malt Health Drink",with a mild aroma of coffee..Trust me,it was that bad

They say first impression is the last one...I guess,I'd go with that.For once atleast, as far as Coffee House is concerned...
You'd probably be able to relate  this place to the famous Manna Dey track...or  breathe in the air of decades of nostalgia..at one go..but if Your looking for something decent to chomp on...its not a commendable place ...

After all,when you hear,different ragas emerging from your tummy,do you really bother about culture,heritage etc etc etc?????

A Beautiful place !!  Brings you back  the memory of the lovely  yesteryears . 
Formerly named The Albert Hall it still lives up to its name. Time has done no harm to this place, it must have been quite the same earlier too.

I was difficult to find its entrance in the crowded college street and I crossed it many times only to come back to it. 
I and my friend had reached pretty late at around 7:30 in the evening and had a tough time finding ourselves a table. After shuttling between  the upper and ground  floors we did get one. People were refused entry after around 7:50

The only option we had for ordering at that time was fish fingers we we promptly did and yes coffee too.
Fish fingers were good and the coffee was a bit too sweet but I enjoyed the ambiance more than the food.
The beharas (waiters) were  well dressed and trained and reminded me of my childhood days spent in the tea bungalows of Assam.

Overall a nice place to spend time and unwind.

this place is nothing but a place of sheer nostalgia! have been frequenting this place since the last year of my school..and currently it is one of my favorite hang out place. a cup of coffee, some cigarettes, a good friend to talk to (yes i do have a coffee house friend..we go only to coffee house for our adda..haha).
 the best place to have infusion (or as the waiters say..'kaalo toh?') and gorge on the chicken sandwich ( i so wish that one day they will start adding some grated cheese in it and make the price a little higher).
their mughlai porota is no doubt god..though it is much more on the oilier side... and their kabiraji cutlet...yummm. rest of the food..i have not really tasted as this is not really a place for me to treat my tummy. 
the onion pakora is also good..not the sauce though..lol.
and no..i dont like their cold coffee!
i will be rating this place 4 because of the lovely atmosphere! :)
ting!

The historical Albert Hall turned to famous coffee house. To express about coffe house there is no word for me. Before coming about food and beverage I must come to the glory n nostalgia of coffe house. This was and also is a nest of all intellectualism. Lots of legends had visited here and gave birth of fantabulous ideas. Still present days genious also come here. Not only them but also hungry college students visit here to refresh themselves. Food is very delicious and healthy hyginic too. I personally mogai paratha,kabirajis and obviouslu cold coffe with cream. You want to spend some good times with your beloved one or friends? Pls visit here and enjoy.

What more can be said about the Indian Coffee House, the Anadabazar patrika and the various other newspapers have covered it all! Yes, the intellectual debate going around the walls of coffee street, yes, many of my friends, i've made it there! Yes, where else can you sit all day long with a 25rs coffee, and chat about the universe on end!
But it's the food which matters and ICD fails where it should have striven! - it is bland to say the least! The Chicken Kabiraji is the only thing we have when we viait the place, the attendants are old and take like forever to take and make you'r order! The chicken omelette is good though, if you're into half fried chicken strips!
Over in all, a good place to hangout - a terrible place to eat!

This historic place is located just opposite to the Presidency College. It is like a gazillion years old and one of THE most famous hangout spots in Kolkata for the college-goers ( but not for the quality of the food). Coffee House's history and list of famous customers is enough to make any other place in the city jealous. It has two floors and you will always have to snoop around for a seat. There is always a euphony of voices as this place is always alive. 

Now coming to the part where I have to talk about the food (I really don't want to)...the food is pretty bad with a few exceptions. The price is cheap. The coffee - its namesake product, is nothing special. The service is really slow and the attitude of the waiters is not something to brag about.

So, if you are in College Street and  you really have no place to go, you just want to sit and relax and if Paramount is full then Coffee House is probably your place to be. The ambiance and nostalgia is what keeps this place ticking.

I won't elaborate all the nostalgia and the addas I am suppose to rave about because a) I was born in the 90's and b) the times I went to this place there were hardly any intellectual debates waging and I mostly saw cozy couples or bored looking college-goers lounging there. So, here's what I thought about food (my rating, too, is based on only that)-

We ordered fried rice and chilly chicken and coffee. First off, the fried rice came topped with ketchup (I just... don't even... gah!). The chilly chicken had more chillies than bell peppers, and the chillies were very hot, so this dish was like a minefield for someone with a mild taste. The coffee had way too much sugar in it and even though I stirred half the amount of sugar deposited at the bottom, it was too sweet for me to finish. I had the Mughlai at the Jadavpur Coffee House and that was too oily and tough. The crispy dry chilly chicken is marginally better than the rest. You could argue that the price is convenient for students' pockets, but considering the amount they serve, it would be plain exorbitant if they charged a rupee more. 

So, basically if you belong to the generations who feel it's their duty to keep visiting this place to honour their uni/college days or uphold some tradition or keep a part of Kolkata alive, feel free to visit for the sake of less than average food. Otherwise, you won't miss much.

This place has its own charm. Eveything about it is basic and may be that is why common people like me like to go there once in a while. It would be nice if they have larger size of coffee cups, that is, have the ones that are being used now, additionally have coffee mugs. Sometimes I feel my coffee has finished too soon. I can order again, but then the continuity is broken. Also if people were considerate enough not to smoke, it would become the perfect place to sit and spend some time alone or with friends.

A sense of old Calcutta.... A romanticism with heritage.... A reference to popular folklore... A feeling of being part of the history..... The long hours of chatting & flirting over a single cup of coffee....

A badly managed cafe.... Some inert non-responsive waiters.... Some over-friendly tip-mongering ones too!!!.... An extremely dirty entrance and stairway.... Some mediocre food.... 

In summary: Go there for nostalgic reasons, not for anything more.

In the generation of Cafe Coffee Day or Barista or any modern adda hubs, my journey starts from one of the oldest adda joint and eatery in Kolkata. Situated opposite the Presidency College within the hustle and bustle of College Street some great minds surely did meet here. When we come to the food and beverage section the coffee both hot and cold are not  up to the mark. The only thing that one would find good is the snacks section is  the Mughlai Paratha. Though a bit oily but are a must have along with Chicken or Mutton Kabiraji. The chinese menu with chichken hakka chow and chilly chicken is average, but the quality and quantity are compromised with. The sandwich menu is also worth a try.

When it comes to the ambiance, it beats all the other adda joints. The Coffee House is of historical significance for being the rendezvous of innumerable versatile people, from its inception till date.  The sheer nostalgia of the place , to be the part of a place which has been the  silent witness of the marvels of people like Satyajit Ray, Manna Dey to modern day youth.  It has retained its old world charm with the British architecture still being the only decor. The long fans, the airy grounds and even the waiters with their well crafted dresses and turbans turns back time. 
The only piece of advice stop compromising with the quality of food and a bit of hygiene would be really great for starters.
My ratings
for food- 2
and the ambiance- its beyond the known scale available..

The Moghlai Paratha, despite being on the oilier side, appealed to me for its crunchy taste and the potatoes offered alongside. It was unavailable on my last visit here and we settled for Chicken Hakka Chow, Chicken Cutlet, Mutton Cutlet, Chicken Omelette, Cold Coffee (with Cream) and Infusion, and at the end of our meal, Infusion remained the prizewinner. Service was somewhere in the grey area between 'quick' and 'delayed'.

While the prices slowly inch higher, the quality of the food here is severely compromised upon. Critically speaking: Chicken Omelette was terribly oily and the shreds of chicken were undercooked. Chicken Cutlet was sparsely laden with chicken while heavily coated with the crust of the cutlet. Chicken Hakka Chow was unpalatable and the quantity was miserly. It was oily, undercooked and strewn with chunks of inedible chicken. Mutton Cutlet was surprisingly somewhat tasty. Cold Coffee was much too thin and before you realise, it'd be over. Infusion (black coffee), probably the cheapest item on the menu, is decent.

The reputation and the ambience of "Coffee House" precedes itself by leaps and bounds, and I can add no more to it. It remains to be a hub for 'adda' (while most ignore the No Smoking signs) but never for food.

It is a heritage place and it is located at a place which is a heritage site in Kolkata...Though it has a crowd pull which can't be beaten by the top restaurants of Kolkata but this heritage place has died and decayed over the years due to lack of maintenance..Stalwarts and men of honor usually did visit this place over the years but now it lacks true quality...Generally now the crowd pull are the college goers....It is always crowded at any point of the day due to cheap and affordable price and prompt service...Hanging around with friends for adda and chitchatting for long hours is what pulls the crowd...Don't try out the Chinese dishes but Chicken omelette is a must try...

Very bad food and ambiance,only the coffee and drinks are good..
pakora is cold and don't even dare to try the chowmein, it's better in the streets than here..
Though it's cheap the food isn't up to the low price mark..
only once here and don't want to come here again..

The only suggestion,take a cup of cold coffee and chit chat with your friends for hours..
Though the place is a cult and historical,it's still a coffee place and I did not like the food..
So only 1.5 from me..

Sorry for coffee house lovers..
 try CCD instead..
1.5 because of it's historical background..

Coffee house is not a place to eat or even get a good cup of coffee, perhaps it is the only coffee house in the world where only one variant of coffee is available, no espresso, let alone cappuccino or mocha! you do not get pastries or other things that go good with coffee
But! as I said it is not a place to eat it is a place to have a good time with friends, a hangout place for Bengalis and to get really cheap coffee and food to keep your battery charged! If you have a sensitive taste bud, a canine nose and you are expecting a royal treatment from the staff - DON'T GO THERE! but if you like to see the reflection of Bengals intellect, chat for hours with a 20Rs cup of coffee, see various kinds of people and above all just have a good time - PLEASE VISIT THE PLACE :)

The Indian Coffee House (or the Albert Hall as it was formerly known as) is located just opposite to Presidency on College Street. Although the building looks shabby from outside, it has been quite well maintained on the insides. The place is more or less crowded, with people from all age   groups catching up with their dear ones. It surely is a wonderful place to be with friends.

Coming to the food. The menu is quite impressing. To cater to the demands, they have incorporated even noodles, rice and some other delicacies in their menu though I haven't tried any of them till now.

The coffee is nothing impressive.

The chicken sandwich offered is good. Worth the money. I had hear much hype about the chicken omelette, but didn't quite like it. 

The chicken kabiraji and the mutton cutlet were good, and one must try them.

I was expecting something 'grilled' when I ordered grilled fish. But what I received was some sort of fried fish, but it tasted good nevertheless. 

Keeping the prices, and the quantity they serve in mind, Coffee House is a good place to hang out with friends.

The Indian Coffee House- a restaurant chain run by worker cooperative societies has been operational since the pre-independence period and even today its ambiance exudes the British influence on the Indian society (especially the waiters' uniforms).It is a regular hangout joint for collegiates.  The menu is like any normal regular cafe's and the prices are reasonable too. However, the service can leave you irritated and the food quality can spoil your mood a wee bit more.

Historic place. Home for the "aantels" of the land as my friend has said. I've given this place a try quite a number of times but came out frustrated every time. You don't a proper place to sit.The place is loud. the waiters are outright rude. You food comes after an hour- cold keeping you wondering whether it really was cooked today. Would not want to come here unless I have no other choice.

Location and a brief description : Indian coffee house is located at college street opposite presidency college. As you enter the place, you see a cigarette shops which serves people with cigarettes though not a cigarette smoker so not much idea about it. Nevertheless, as you go to the first floor the stairs are dirty but it gives a very nostalgic feeling everytime you visit Indian coffee house. I visited the same after years so. The place is the same. You go up on the first floor. You get a feeling that this place is made long ago during the British time. The proof is high ceiling, long fans, and the wide area coffee house covers. I heard stories of various famous authors and writers visiting it. Though not much idea about it. 

They even have the second floor basically looks likes a closed balcony with light coming in from all sides. What I found strange about the place. Staffs are wearing designed turban like things serving in white coat like dress. But aren't polite. Everywhere there is written no smoking no smoking but people are smoking in front of me? Don't know. It was strange for a new visitor to swallow how is it possible. 

Let's not talk about the pros and cons of this place. 
Pros
1) located at a very good and old place- college street. Will attract customers who are tired and are in for a snack. 
2) high ceiling and long fans which helps in proper ventilation even If someone is smoking on the room. 
3) food is cheap and  delicious - you get Cold Coffee with Cream and Chicken Chap, Chicken Sandwich and all at very affordable prices. I haven't tried Chinese though 
4) Can accommodate a large number of people(still there is seating problems at times due to huge population our india has :p) 
5) people who want to sit and chat and pass time eat a snack- best place for them. 
6) attracts many foreigners don't know why.( will find next time) 
7) service is moderately okay. 
8) One can see multi-faces i.e. all types of crowd - college students, parents, old people, foreigners. 

Cons:
1) They do not provide quality food
2) place is a big unhygienic and floors are not cleaned on a regular basis
3) in spite of 'no smoking' board all over the place , how can they allow smoking ? Smoking is something which even affects other people too and is very injurious to health. They should understand and divide the place rather into smoking and non smoking zone. 
4) lacks innovation and not maintained properly
5) staffs even after wearing proper dress they are not polite and do not serve with a smiling face(why don't they understand, it's a big turn off) 
6) such a big place, still just run as a commercial business why? Repair innovate and grow! That's how it works. 


A 3.5 from me.

This place is still surviving due to its historical significance, when great minds would come over for a cup of coffee and intellectual exchanges and sit there for long hours. Obviously, the scenario is totally different now. Once you enter the huge hall, you'll find nothing but a bedlam of confused customers, waiters and different kinds of people. The place is almost always crowded and people have to wait for a long time before they can run and get hold of an emptying table. These days you can't even sit there in peace and try to have a conversation over a cup of coffee as there would be at least 5 people wanting you to vacate the seat as soon as possible. The bored faces and nonchalant attitude of the attendants make things even worse.
   When it comes to food, I think, more or less everyone is disappointed with it. The so called "french fries" served with the chicken cutlet tastes rotten and none of their dishes are worth mentioning. Even if the sub-standard food quality is forgiven, you can't really forgive if the coffee also starts tasting abnormal. Given then it is a "Coffee House", one can at least expect the coffee to be of good quality (and for that, not much effort is required). 
  So, at the end of the day it's just the name that triggers a feeling, which I wish, was not getting less warmer day by day.

All the brouhaha about this place and the coffee itself will leave you utterly disappointed! The waiters treat you like dirt! Case in point- I once asked for a bit of tomato sauce, they refused rudely and made a face as if i had wanted his Kidneys!! 
Half of the items in the menu are not available most or all of the times! 
Go if adda, smoke, rude waiters and nostalgia fill you appetite. 
I won't go there again if i can help it!

I don't like Coffee House. Yes it's still a place for adda, I'm sure. ...but honestly, nothing about the place seems attractive to me.
The food is way too oily. The coffee itself isn't worth the visit here. The place is waaaayy too crammed up and always filled with smokers (yes, I can't bear it,  so sue me). To top it all off, the waiters have always been uncooperative. I've been here a couple of times in my first year of college, and the enthusiasm died down real soon.

I believe this is the oldest coffee joint in the city, and the Old Calcutta feeling that you get inside is amazing. People from various backgrounds, with different philosophies are seen sitting, smoking (officially it is illegal, haha!) and sharing their ideas on different topics.
It is the perfect place to hang out and catch up with friends, but honestly, don't expect your taste buds to be too happy with the food. The only items i would order are Infusion coffee, Chicken Sandwiches and Chicken Afghani. Prices are quite on the lower side, that is a good point.
Talking about the service, the waiters in their white uniforms and white turbans are not very cooperative, but it does not affect once you get on with your adda.

Many would be heard saying "You cannot be a true Calcuttan unless you have visited The Coffee House." I recommend it for the ambience and the ADDA Factor. :)

Now coming to the food...my advice is dont have any kind of food...still if wana taste something then go for chicken sandwich, it is somewhat good. The service is awful, if a waiter comes up to you for order then order all the things you want because if you wont find him the second time!!
Lastly, Coffee house is a nostalgic place to be in as it will remind you of your college days.

Some more coffee at Indian Coffee House! 

Any person living in Kolkata who is acquainted with the popular food joints and coffee shops here must have heard about Indian Coffee House. Frequented by the 'bhadra lok' - intellectuals, activists, writers, students, etc. Indian Coffee House is one of the oldest cafes in Kolkata (if not India) and a landmark in North Kolkata. 

Established in 1942, over the years Indian Coffee House has been frequented by eminent personalities including Amartya Sen, Utpal Dutt, Uttam Kumar and many more. At one time, Indian Coffee House was a rendezvous for well known teachers, artisans, filmmakers, and journalists. Much later, a new branch was opened at Jadavpur.

Although I have been living in Kolkata since birth and have my office nearby, I never got a chance to visit Indian Coffee House on College Street. But once I got an opportunity to visit Indian Coffee House, located at A/2, CIT Market, Jadavpur Kolkata. I went there with a friend of mine for some refreshments and got a feel of the traditional Coffee House that people often talk about. Although the place was bit stuffy and smoky from cigarette stubs I liked the atmosphere and the old school ambience. 

I heard that the chicken pakora, Bombay chicken and Moglai paratha offered at Indian Coffee House are very delicious! I didn't even check the menu and ordered these items and some Infusion coffee. Everything tastes awesome with their infusion coffee! The food was quite good, and prices were really reasonable too as you can get some tasty snacks at very reasonable rates. A must visit if you are in the area.

The College Street Coffee House has been held up as a bastion of Calcutta's "intellectual" culture, and paeans have been sung about the conversation people have had (and overheard) in this place. The quality of the food or the beverages have rarely been mentioned, except the "Infusion", which is feted as the drink of choice for the intellectual.

However, such conversations are a thing of the past, and the food and beverages are terrible. I have been to the Coffee House several times over the last decade, and I have always come away disappointed. The service is slow, the waiters are rude (I had to walk out once after a friend got incensed on account of the waiter's behaviour) and the food is pedestrian. The coffee served is terrible - one can actually do better at home (a hoary adage that I usually avoid, but it is true in this case) and the tea equally bad.

I would recommend that whoever runs the place does what I have listed here:

- Clean the place up. The place is spacious and still has some wonderful furniture and wall decorations, which can be put to good use. Most of the tables and chairs used, though, need to be replaced.

- Improve the attitude of the staff. They seem to wallow in complacency, and they imply that "I served Satyajit Ray, and who are you to him?" Sadly, Ray is dead, and we happen to be paying customers. The speed of the service also needs to be improved. I suppose, though, that there is an obstructive trade union in place, so this might take time.

- Ensure that all items on the menu are available. I have never had the Afghani there (though I'm told I've not missed anything) and the only decent dish I had (once) was the Baked Fish, which was unavailable every other time I went there.

- Use proper coffee beans/powder, not the sawdust that currently goes into the cups. I suppose the same should apply to tea leaves.

- Reduce the number of tables and raise the prices. They are too low to be sustainable, and I say this as someone who is not flush with funds and prefers places that serve cheap food.

This is not the place to talk at length about the "intellectual" heritage of the place, since it has little reflection on its current status. However, I have always found that the quality of food/tea/coffee is directly proportional to the quality of a conversation had over them. Perhaps the management ought to keep this in mind.

A complete contradiction and shame to its name 'The Indian Coffee House' . I shall come to very soon. Having had the chance to be in another city of the country where old eating establishments such as our Coffee House produced artists such as M.F.Hussain and others I am sad that Kolkata lags far far behind in its quality of food at the same rates. Staunch supporters would argue that this is where the mind explores its creative side but just because the mind is having a gala time does it mean the stomach has to suffer miserably. Well from my experience in another city I can say that old establishments can still whip up the best food possible only if they try a little bit. The budget is pocket friendly for students and the moment you enter the building in which this iconic name is housed you are transported to a world of protests against different topics stuck all over the walls in every size of paper possibly available but instead of giving it an old world charm it just clutters the walls and make it look dirty. Now the architecture is magnificent with a space in the middle of the house and huge balconies surrounding it. There are two storeys which houses the establishment. The staff is curt and doesn't really welcome anyone since students flock to this place. It is definitely not charming when the host is rude.  As for conversations I appreciate those who get creative ideas in the middle of cacophony. The place is loud and from the conversations of  a few students seated around our table I can assure you it is far from being intellectual. One group was discussing how to use an illegal drug in their 'Presi's Campus' (The prestigious Presidency College). I am hoping they never got the chance to do it in public.                                                                                                                           I should talk about the food since i am compelled to do so as it is supposed to be a review of a restaurant. How would one like to gulp down the weakest coffee possible which has a strange taste and tastes nothing like coffee or even coffee flavoured water? Hence the contradiction of the name and product. The cutlets were cold and the coating was bland and yet hot enough to burn one's tongue with unwanted amount of ginger and burnt garlic. My friend's cold coffee was watery. Coffee house neither has the 'adda' (chatting , talking with friends and family) nor the food. The only saving grace is that the money you waste is not a huge sum of money and the bonus of having seen the place where the great minds would be at work and where the legendary people would meet is worth it. Even with all the negativity I still recommend visiting the place for its heritage and past glory and well as far as the Omelette goes I am hoping no one can make bad omelette. so enjoy the omelette and reassure yourself that it is a place worth visiting once.

The Indian Coffee House is much, much more than a place you go and have food. In fact, the food is an insignificant part of it, so to speak! Located on College Street Boipara - the official destination for all your literary quests - it is bang opposite Presidency University, the erstwhile Presidency College. It has been the seat of the city's intelligentsia for more decades than I remember - and is still legendary. To share a seat where the Hungryalist Poets shared thoughts, where the legendary artists visualised many of their masterpieces and where the soul of all great addas of the father-figures of our society lies .. is thrilling, enriching and rejuvenating. Immortalised in Manna De's classic song, your experience of Calcutta is incomplete without a visit to this place.

Once it was said that to be an intellectual in this chaotic city, you should read the dust jacket of Grundrisse, follow Marxism at some point in your youth and spend a solid six hours daily creating thunderstorms over your cigarettes and coffee and tea at the Indian Coffee House. The word 'Indian' is often dropped in popular conversation.

There is nothing exceptional about the food, and the service is slow, to be frank. It is always crowded, but you will be readily welcomed into a table which can accommodate one more person and slowly, as you sip your coffee, you will get drawn into debates ranging from Jamini Roy to the politics of Industrialisation and Surrealism and the famous Khalashitola exploits of the poet duo, Sunil and Shakti.

Coffee House is all about experiencing vintage, classic, adda-baj Kolkata at its very best. When you step inside here, you are entering into a microcosm of a world that has stayed the same for a long time, with revolutionary ideas brewing all about you in the smoke of the cigarettes or the frantic wave of the hands.

Verdict: It's an experience. Enough said.

You cannot compare this place with any other cafe in town - this place is legendary because of the people that have graced it over the years. Indian Coffee House is known for being the hub of Kolkata's intelligentsia for years, and the atmosphere in here is very different from any other commercial cafe in the city!

Food wise, the quality is just above average, but then again, Coffee House was never about the food! If you are visiting Kolkata, this has to be one of the places you need to explore!

I am sure it is a nostalgic place for many and a decent hangout place for college goers in the area, however nostalgia and fame apart food wise this is one of the worst places i have ever visited. The food though priced favorably  is however very poor in quality. And the service is even worse. Almost everything is over oily and over fried. Granted the coffee house is targeted to be budget friendly, however a lot of other budget friendly places provide far better food at the same price with better service.

The only good thing about the place is its unique ambiance and the feel of bygone days.

This is the place where people come to dream. I always wanted my college to be in the college square area but it did not happen actually. Though I have been visiting this place since my schooldays. Its a place of nostalgia to me. I am connected with every chair, table, ashtrays, waiters over here. The ambiance is just addictive. The fragrance of infusion, smog created by cigarettes,  all these create a perfect ambiance for people. 
I used to come here with my friends, and spend lots of time gossiping, smoking and having coffee. I love the mutton afgani of coffee house.

everyone should visit the place once to live the aura of the place and feel the legacy, the aristocracy  attached to the intellectual heritage called Coffee House. i'll recommend you to taste the intuition coffee which is actually black coffee but not the usual sour one. anything else you order will be served too late. prepare to wait atleast 10 minutes for the waiter to take your order, another 40 minutes for the food to arrive, another 15 minutes for the bill to arrive and atleast 7 minutes for the change that will be returned to you. so, enter the place only if you have atleast 2 hours in hand. but i'll say it's a great place to hang out with friends for the famous bangali adda or for couples. boys, if you want to spend less but enjoy the company of your girl friend, take her to coffee house

Touch of many Bengali's who has been worshiped by the World can be felt here. Though the coffee has no comparison with the road side tea stalls or the cutlet is also substandard but a pride you will always feel that you are in The Coffee House.

Now for the outsiders of West Bengal, this is a cafe with a lot of smoke of cigarette with substandard service, few tasteless dishes without any variety and a lot of chaos.

SUB STANDARD is the only word for it...and even that doesn't do proper justice to this place....Made famous by the age old bengali song "coffee house er shei adda ta aj ar nei" by Manna Dey,this place seems stuck in a time warp...the waiters are bedecked in colonial style uniforms,with elaborate headgear that used to be sported by the native attendants to the british gentry.Service is very slow..at least half an hour will pass before an attendant reaches you with the menu card...food is ughh...the cutlery seems oily,and the food tastes funny...the cold coffee seems like thin syrup...but the charm of this place lies in the typical bengali adda zone that everyone swears by....people spend hours sitting around the tables chatting away on a myriad of topics.After all,they have hours to burn.Could this be a reason for the slow service by the staff?Given its location,this place is often frequented by students of Presidency college(now University),Scottish Church college,Vidyasagar College,Calcutta University and Calcutta medical college,making it a meeting place of the supposedly intellectual elite:although given today's changing times,I'm sure they would have gone elsewhere if given the opportunity.In a nutshell...poor quality food,appaling cutlery and slow service make this a 1 out of 5 in my book. It might have nostalgia associated with it,but that doesnt earn a restaurant its michelin stars,does it?

Food!! Are you mad??!! We never go to coffee house to have food. It's simply because the nostalgia I come here everytime. The forst time I came here was in the year 2003 and till then, it has become my part of life. A perfect place for gossiping with a cup of infusion and a cigerrate. Yes, they allow you but do not provide you an ash-tray!! who cares? Throw it on the floor. A must visit place who want to catch the perfect mood of "Calcutta". The paintings, the waiters, the gathering.. Ahhh...

By the way, my personal favourite is Infusion (as I have said before), Onion Pakoda, Mutton Afgani.

Forget about the food, the deteriorating quality of Kabiraji, the newly introduced non-smoking coffee house.. go there to feel nostalgic. The ambiance is absolutely unique. The essence of the place lies in it's originality, the white dressed bearers, the way they collect cash, the dirty toilets, the hidden smokers, the lovers, the poets, the so called humanitarians and politicians. You feel absolutely elated the moment you enter this ever-crowded, ever-noisy coffee house. Truly a heritage to have food.

On a recent visit to College Street with my cousin i dropped in for a quick cup of black coffee or infusion as it is more popularly known here. Service,ambiance,crowd all remain unchanged as expected. I also tried out the veg cutlet.The outer coating of the cutlet was pretty thick and tough-not to my liking at all.Some people prefer a thick coating for their cutlet but i prefer my cutlet to be different from a brick :) Each to his own i say. The veg stuffing was fine though.Freshly made and served with generous amount of sauce and salad. The infusion was really good and charged me up given the nip in the air in the evenings. Prices have remained the same and pocket friendly.
I had been to this place for precisely the only reason people flock to this place- that is the quintessential bangali adda session. Noticed that the crowd composition has changed and the average age of the coffee house visitor has come down drastically.In fact most of them seemed to be kids in their first year of college enjoying their new found freedom of bunking classes.The elderly crowd was surprisingly missing.
Well no one goes there for the food-mainly snacks that is, as most of the items on the menu are barely edible.Had onion pakoda,fish fry and chow mien. All the dishes were strictly OK.Black coffee-known as infusion here among the pseudo intellectuals was fine.The waiters behave as if they are doing some social service to the visitors.Service is slow,rude and hygiene does NOT exist here.
Would give 2-stars only for nostalgia and nothing else.

If your looking for fine dining and a gastronomical experience then the Indian Coffee House is not for you ! However if you wish to soak in the "feel" and ambience of a bygone era when this place was a hotbed of political debate that heralded the renaissance of change then drop by for a visit. Smokey , noisy , crowded .... best describe this place but very pocket friendly. The coffee of Indian Coffee House is nothing to get excited about and the onion pakoras, chicken or mutton cutlet and kabiraj is halfway decent.The best part ... no one rushes you and "adda" is the order of the day !!!

The service is slow, the place is too noisy and people smoke despite the no-smoking signs hung there. But despite all of that, the place has a certain charm to it. And the food isn't half bad too boot, also, it is cheap. The cold coffee I didn't not much care for, it was okay, but the chicken sandwich was surprisingly good.
If you are new to Kolkata, or are just visiting then you should definitely go there, at least once.
I think it is a great place for students to relax and grab a bite after a hard day of haggling, buying and selling books are college street. Wish there was a similar place in Delhi's equivalent of College Street, Nai Sarak.

When I shifted to Kolkata last year, somebody took me to Indian Coffee House...'just for the experience though'.. I was warned, don't go by the name!! I love the fact that its huge!! with a high ceiling, wall paintings and those big glass windows on the first floor!! Its almost as if u r in the British era, even the waiters in their same costume! 
The food is very average, even bad at times. But it doesn't pinch ur pocket so u don mind one chicken sandwich n one cold coffee to supplement ur conversation. U can sit here for hrs..probably that's the reason the waiters are so slow!

Coffee House - This heritage intellectual hub of Kolkata does not need any introduction. It is a famous hang out place not only among the youth, but also the old timers who keep on frequenting the place.
To me the place reminds of those days when we hopped in there for a refreshing break after a long boring class at college. What better way to catch up with friends than over a cup of steaming hot or cold coffee and that too when the adda session doesn't burn a deep hole in your pocket.
While chit chatting if you feel you need to munch, there are snacks like onion pakora, chicken sandwich ,chicken pakora and chicken afgani.
Coffee house has its own charm since the walls, bearers and smoke filled room reminds of old Bengal.

Indian Coffee House..... a place for nostalgia, a place for non-stop adda, a place for no-nonsense hangout. This place forms a core part in bengali nostalgia. This place never wanted to be a place for a die-hard foodie neither people want it to be. This is more like a friend's house , where you can hang-out and have tea, coffee and of course smoke cigarettes without any botheration. What's more....you may find some well known people and celebrities hanging out just beside your table. The place is cramped and crowded most of the time. You can have infusion and cold coffee with cream if you want something to have.Altogether, a great place and a must-visit place!!

Coffee House should not be judged by its quality of food or whatnots, coffeehouse is not a restaurant, its a landmark, where a true to the heart bengali can perform the tradition of exploring in the magical world of adda and truly enjoying intellectual discussion about politics, science, art and absolutely whatever while looking at paintings which are delicately placed and not worrying about the clock that ticks in front of the nose. The price here of any food must be well within the range of any average Bengali. The service is slow. You just don't go to the coffee house while in a hurry, its against their definition. Most famous for hot coffees which turn out to be cold and has a better reputation for the kaviraji, the best coffee you can order here is the infusion. This place has a very special space in my heart and will hopefully visit every once in a while every time I'm near!

Indian Coffee house fills me with nostalgia every time. If you ever visit the college do drop by this place. 
The place has no ambiance to offer but the ADDA and the food is awesome. Try the Mutton Cutlet, Fish Finger, Chowmein and Chili Fish. There are 8 small pieces, but for 135 bucks a plate, they are well worth it. Finish your meal with a cold coffee with ice cream. 
If you are a student of Kolkata uni, you ought to love this place. 
I would've given it 5 stars, but because of the ambiance, will give it 3.

Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. That's the word that comes to mind when one thinks of this old place. A place for school or collage goers, a place for the young and the old, a place for the common and the intellectuals. Coffee house has it all. The place is rather old fashioned and they still allow you tio smoke inside the joint. The food and coffees are nothing outstanding or anything, but who cares? Whenever you enter the premises you feel different and that's what's special about the place. I wouldn't say that their service is very warm or anything but the place is worth it by it's own standard and history.
P.S. it's not a place for romantic hang-out. rather it's a place for friends and screaming 'addas'.

I could boast of this heritage Bengali intellectual hub, I could make huge statements about its legacy . But then, I won't be doing any sort of justice to this vintage place. The dirty corridors and the dull plates could easily make way for a much more sparkling appearance. Why they don't renovate it, is beyond me, The coffee house enjoys the patronage of so many of the famous college's students. I've often dined here with my friends and reflected upon the fact that this place could have become a spectacular free mixing zone. A little bit more hygiene wouldn't have done them any harm, but that isn't happening anytime soon, or so it seems. The two floors are always choc-a-bloc with students, so, despite the many drawbacks, coffee house holds forte. Hope to see it become better.

If you want old school Calcutta addas, this is the place for you. You can kill time here, and the waiters won't pester you much. On the contrary if you are hungry or in a hurry you might get irritated at how late they take the order.
The food is not very good, sandwiches are just ok, stuffed omlettes are fine, afghani and kabiraji dishes nice. A word of caution, the coffee here will truly disappoint you. Between hot coffee and cold coffee though, you are better off with the cold one. One advice- carry water for yourselves,because hygiene is not the top priority when they serve water over here.
Truly a smokers delight and a favorite hangout place for many veterans as well as the youngsters, the place has a very laid back attitude hard to find in today's world.
I will rate it good because it lives up to its traditional fame.

"coffee house er sei adda ta aaj aar nei" by Manna Dey...
Coffee House..!! Landmarks of Kolkata. i think everyone at least once went there. This is the Place to be hangout with ur friends. Every items here are special. Must try Hot coffee, mutton sandwich, chiecken kaviraji. I dont like hakka noodles here. What i can say about its ambiance..!! Its a landmarks itself. U can smoke here freely. But only worst part is the service. u have to wait minimum 30 mints or even 1hour for the service. Staffs with its White pagri always wait for the Tips at ur table when u gonna pay the bills. But Overall i like coffee house and often go there because of its historic names. Great place for hangout and u can become nostalgic here. Dont expect goo quality foods and service. Except that everything is just awesome. Worth a visit.!! Sorry!! u have to visit this place again and again.
