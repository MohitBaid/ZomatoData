Not at all bad... hoping for more improvement! Though price is reasonable. A good restaurant for pick-up-one place. You can bring family there.

Nice food with great ambience.Went there a couple of times with whole family.Try their tanduri,tangri kahan,chilli chicken,Mixed fried rice.Even the tandoori rotis are very nice...
Only demerit is the wait time.If you have enough time in your hand and want to enjoy the food then only you go there.And compared to other resturants in Andul price is on a higher side....

Most worst home delivery services..One of them say that they can provide home delivery near morigram station then another person of them say that there have some problem so no one want to go there and he say that " dada oto dur jete minium billing 300taka hte hbe" though my billing was over 300rs and they are started arguing with me ....They don't have any quality manner how to speak or deal with customer...

Great staff and impeccable food.
Just happened to pass by Andul and thought of trying this place out.
Foodie's delight.
Their Reshmi Malai Kebab is truly the best out there.
Will come back for more.

Been there multiple times and the food has been fantastic every single time. Chinese and Tandoor cuisines are divine.
The decor has a cozy ambience with some great music picked by the owner.
Andul needed such a joint.

Average Restaurant with average food quality and well-mannered staff.... Quantity was adequate but taste of some items were not up to the mark.... Must try if you are passing through the Andul Road....
