I have visited this place 5 or 6 times. This is located just opposite to the Tata Medical Center for Cancer Research, and adjacent to the New Town Police station. It is terribly easy to find, as it is just beside the road. Now coming to the review of the restaurant and the food.

1. Service (5.0): The service staff, by my experience have been very polite. I have also experienced quite some promptness in their service.
2. Ambiance (5.0): Fully air conditioned restaurant, with nice chairs and tables. The ambiance is absolutely good, with bollywood music running on the TV. This might help you enjoy your dinner.
3. Food¬† (5.0):¬†I had their chicken Biriyani thrice and once I had fried rice with Paneer Butter Masala. The quality of their food is very good. Talking about the biriyani, it tasted really good, better than most other restaurants. The biriyani they served was quite less oily, with one huge piece of half sliced potato, one egg and one HUGE piece of chicken. And the quantity of food that they provided was huge, more than sufficient to fill up ones stomach. The price was set at 155+GST the last time I had it. I would say, considering the taste and the quantity, the food they served was well valued for money. I don't think someone would regret having their food.

As a personal note, I would rather have Dawat's biriyani than Arsalan's. This is because, biriyani served Dawat's was as good as Arsalan's, except for some minor specialities that Arsalan has. And the quantity they served was enormous. Also, the price was much better. So, considering both quality and quantity, my vote would be for Arsalan.

To be honest I have tried this restaurant only for ordering food at Office. So whatever rating has been given is purely based on the quality of food they provide. The ambiance of this place is unknown to me. Service for delivery is quite slow. It always take more than an average time to deliver their food although my office is within the vicinity. Mostly tried biriyani of this place and it tastes average. Only advantage that you get is this place is very pocket friendly and in comparison to that their quality of food is satisfactory.

Visited this placed once.. but ordered several times from here, as its near my office. I like their mixed chowmin, chicken manchurian.
But the most unpredictable dish of them is Biriyani. Sometimes they make good one, but most time they r flop on biriyani.
So i prefer chinese more from their kitchen, which is good. And yes the quantity they serve is good...

Located to the opposite of Techno India Rajarhat campus, we saw this place grow up in front of our eyes on our way to and back from work. One fine day we wanted to give the place a spin so we went there on a lunch-out. We tried their Tandoori Chicken starter and then Mutton Keema and Chicken bharta along with an assorted bread. The food was good, especially the tandoori, the Keema wasn't up to the high standard of our expectations. We wanted to give the Biryanis a try but we were already full. So we left with a promise of returning soon to sample the Biryanis. A good place very close to office, a very big plus.

Dawat restuarant is very adjacent to Infospace now Candor,popularity known as Unitech building.It is just opposite of TATA Medical center.
The restuarant is not much spacious.It is a three stories building with ground floor having toilette‚Äã.First floor is having couple of seats and second is a well good for 20 members team.Foodbquality is average.

Try for Garlic Nan and Chicken Tikka masala.

Apart from that ..no other speciality ..Good for low budget office party.

Since my office is situated quite near to this place, and with no other restaurants in the vicinity, on the occasional weekend support this has kind of become the go to place for us for lunch/dinner orders... The delivery does not take much time and the quantity and quality are both satisfying... The prices are rather reasonable as well... I have tried their Biriyani, which is decent, and their mixed fried rice and noodles, which are really good as well... The side dishes, Indian or Chinese, however, have more than generous quantities of oil and it is one area they can work on... Till newer options come up, Dawat would still be tried time and again...

Been here today first time ... That too for a very late lunch !
Nicely decorated interior... Food quality is average ... I wont say very good or bad ... 
Quantity over price could not satisfy me.
Service is not so commendable.... 
And the service tax was 6% .... (Which happens to b 4% in general cases as i have seen)
We took half tandoori chicken, jeera rice, hong kong fish...
The jeera rice was good to taste but the quantity was not enough for 2people.
Moreover we had to ask for finger-bowl...

Besides, heard another group of customers expressing their dissatisfaction over their waiting of 1hr 5mins before their orders was served.
But for our case we were lucky in this & dint have to wait much to get the food on our table.

Last Sunday visited this place. Our fifth visit. A very loved place of our family. We were 16 heads. This place is very conveniently located near New Town Police Station opposite to Tata Memorial Hospital. First the ambience. Very nice, specially as we visit with family and elderly persons. Second, food. Just awesome. Biriyani preparations needs some modifications, specially Chicken Biriyani. Tried both Chinese and Indian. Third, price. It is also moderate considering the quality and quantity. Fourth, the staff. Very well behaved and neatly dressed. Over all experience........... Superb. Will visit this place again and again. Wish them all good luck.

We were looking for a quick dinner late evening last week and went across at around 2230 to grab a bite. We ordered on the way so that the food was ready and the restaurant doesn't close. Restaurant is probably a fancy word for this place - it's more of a dhaba in the guise of a restaurant. Food is edible and served real quick. Alright to go if you're really hungry and looking for a quick bite.

Went for office party.The place is near to Newtown police station. The staffs are not cooperative.  Service needs to upgraded. Ordered drums of heaven, chicken tikka kebab and mushroom.  All were good and well cooked. In the main course ordered masala kulcha,  veg fried rice,  garlic fish,  chicken reshmi butter masala,  chicken tikka butter masala and panner butter masala. The reshmi butter masala was best if the lot. The fried rice was very dry and the fish garlic was made too soupy. Tikka butter masala lacked the correct ting to taste. The gulab jamun was good for desert.

Located in an isolated place, faaaaar away from the Narkeldanga bus stand stand. The space isn't much big. The staffs were still good. We went for a success party of our college's fest and were like 30 people. So we had booked the place. Coming to the food, we had Crispy Chilli Baby corn and Chilli paneer for starters. The baby corn was delicious and the chilly paneer was a total disaster! Then we had Naan, Veg Chowmein(The spelling of chowmein is wrong in their menu card), Chilli Chicken and Chilli Paneer. There are two different chilli paneer-s here, one separately for starters which is dry and the other for main course that comes with gravy but 10 rupees extra. And it was a disaster yet again. The chowmein lacked taste. The naan was hard to tear. The chicken was still okay. Didn't opt for desserts. Even the washroom was hard to locate as it was downstairs and you have to walk through some maze to reach there.

Based on my experience, this place deserves a better review. The service is a little slow, but the people are well behaved.
We happened to be nearby and looking for a place to eat, when one of my friends recommended this place as we were passing by it. We ordered the reshmi kebab as a starter, which was good. Then we ordered butter nuns, chicken tikka butter masala, chicken reshmi butter masala and a biriyani. The food was more or less good, but the biriyani was not upto the mark, though I appreciated the fact that they still serve an egg with the biriyani. The price point is very low though, so compared to the price, the food is pretty good!

I agreed and later called @ 9.19pm post selecting the menu; however the number provided for the restaurant ¬†(033 68888560) was busy, so I kept on trying until it was responded @9.32. The service boy on the other side right away disregarded my order and ignored my conversation stating that I have called after 9.30, which was absolutely not my fault.

Well first of all I am amazed at such a poor rating to this place which feeds you well ...Guys,please consider it's location and rates while judging it.
The place is like a standalone building in the midst of all types of construction buildings which are grooving this area.The interior is normal like a normal restaurant.We ordered Tandoori(by default choice for any bhukkad) for the starters.Since we are non veggie people,we sticked to the non veg items and guys it didn't disappoint(surely didn't blow us too).
The non veg dishes(fish finger,chicken butter masala,hundi mutton,mixed fried rice,garlic nan,fish do pyaja)were good considering the price tag and the location(nearest food hub is axis mall where restaurants charge more  tax than the govt and the food surely makes you vow never to come back).

If you are on a casual(strictly casual) dinning,please do visit here...eat your food...satisfy your tummy(they provide healthy quantity...a plus) and go on with your business.

An okie dokie place for us techies to grab a quick lunch/dinner before we bang our heads again on the ever silent keyboard.

I happen to visit this place with my buddies as we were famished and all we needed that time was grub. So it was a decent place with decent food. I wasn't expecting the food to be that great but it was decent enough considering price and everything. Its a lil ahead of new town before Infospace. One can visit here for casual dining. 
Friends had ordered Tandoori Chicken for Starters which they really liked it.
For main course we ordered Dal makhni which wasn't a good selection. It was below average.
ALU Dum was decent and properly made. Tasted decent enough.
Chilly Mushroom was even good to taste.
Breads were fine too.
So all in all,this place is suited for causal meals.

Dawat opened last year and has been very close to my home in Rajarhat. Its located just beside the NewTown Police Station at Unitech square. The restaurant is on the 1st floor of the building. They serve mostly non - veg indian dishes. Yes some vegan dishes make to the menu but not good enough. Well I have had kebabs and biryani and they are OK. In case you are hungry then hopp in. The experience wont be unpleasant. People who have been living in this part of Kolkata are happy about new restaurants popping up of late. Its just a regular normal eatout place for office goers of the area as well the residents. They have free home delivery services within 2-3 kms radius of the area.
Food - 3.0/5
Service-3.5/5

A BIG No to this place.
We ordered Tandoori Chicken tikka masala..the taste was like it was cooked yesterday night ..taken out from the fridge today and cooked in gravy...taste was awful and stale..waiters argued with us..epic reply when asked to call the manager ... "manager ake kya karega ?"...finally got us another plate of chicken tikka masala and the difference between previously bought place was noteworthy...masala coldrinks actually felt like masala water.

They even gave a feedback sheet at the end for ¬†those who complain and I feel it is finally thrown away and not taken into consideration at all.

one of the Faltu Restaurant. Don't Prefer for this restaurant whether you are with some one to offering or treating. on the same location just from 500 mtrs distance from Dawat Restaurant. Mehek-e-Punjab one of the finest location than Dawat. My experience was very bad & i hope never hapen with any one. we were 5 on last sunday dated: 12/06/2016. ordered 3 chicken biriyani. but ate force fully Mutton biriyani. even after giving chicken biriyani. and changed by force. like " muh se nibala chin lena". we were shocked & offended infront of other customers. we believe for food never quarrels. SO we didnt argued just asked. but they behave like hash. omg !! felt like we are eating in free of cost. whether there is minus on rating* then i would given -5 star****. please prefer on same location " Mehek-
punjab or Azad Hind" ¬†near by from 1 km surrounding from newton

I have been to this restaurant a number of times as it is near to my friend's house so decided to review it here today. Dawat is a nice and decent place to eat that offers ample amount of food choice with reasonable rates. Both the service and food quality is good which makes me visit them again n again. The place is known for its biryani but you van explore the menu as most of their dishes taste good.

Our office being at Rajarhat Unitech building, we order from this place pretty often but never had a chance to sit and eat in the restaurant there....the biriyani has excellent quantity and taste but uses the kewra water a little too much at times and the chicken bharta (something we mostly order) is good too alongwith a reasonable price....service is pretty prompt and so is the food packaging....

Paid a visit during lunch hour. Crowd was Ok, enough to get a seat.

Pros: 

The d√©cor and ambience was good (would have preferred songs instead of a boring football match on TV screen but that is a different matter altogether!!!)

Good service.

Price is inclusive of tax so what you see is what you pay.

Cons:

Food was Ok. Not that great but not bad as well. We had ordered Chicken lollipop (too spicy), Chicken fried rice (a bit drab for fried rice however it had egg in addition so that was little bit helpful), Hong Kong chicken (tasted good but the chicken was not soft).

In a nutshell: Can be tried if one needs to eat restaurant food and there is no good alternative available.

What we found that Chinese cuisine are better here..
Chicken shiknji
Mushroom chili ( very good veg chinise)
These are d must try :)

Nothing special.. But if u r hanging around and little bit hungry .. Can visit this one :)


2nd time: it's worse, it's worst.. We have ordered parcel.. In the office.. 
Baby corn.. It's was not baby at all :P seems to be the worst baby corn I have ever had

Tengri kabab: what was that, you guys use yellow color for that .. This is simply not expected

Drums of heaven : trust me it was taste that it was cooked long before

A big no.. When it comes to percel..
To the management: please try to respect the customers trust on you.

Well, It was a delivery from this restaurant, hence my review is restricted to food and delivery efficiency.
We had ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Noodles, Hong Kong Chicken and Szechwan Chicken. 
The food reached us in no time, as the place of delivery is very close to the restaurant. The Fried Rice/Noodles is sufficient for a person, if you are too hungry, else can be shared by two people also. 
The Szechwan Chicken was a bit spicy. than what it is in other restaurants. Hong Kong Chicken was mildly spiced. Both the dishes taste flavorful.
The best part of Dawat is that they do not charge any taxes on the total bill, which indeed serves to be a pocket friendly affair :-)
All in all, I would recommend this place who is in search of some Chinese or Indian food, and does not want to shell out a lot of money for delicious food.

And adding to that,  we were amazed to see that chinese dishes were equally tasty.  Bottom line,  must go!

Near my office, opposite to Tata Medical Center. Thought of picking up a couple of items for a casual dinner at work, so visited the restaurant. I was impressed by the decor and nice n neatly done tables, good behavior of the waiters. I ordered Butter Naan and Mutton Rogan Josh. To my utter disappointment, the mutton dish was too bad. Full of oil, hardly any masala gravy I found inside the container. The mutton pieces were poor, like a little amt of meat stuck to a few bones. The prices seemed high compared to the quality and quantity served. The Naan on the other hand was pretty okay.

Biryani is fine, but the rice is drowned in oil. Way too much oily. Not for the diet conscious. Please avoid having Chicken Chap, smells keora essence.

If you're caught up in the New Town zone, and looking for a place to eat, this is the sole option you have got.
A decent eatery, with a nice ambience providing a peek into the ample greenery outside, it offers Chinese n North Indian cuisine at a very reasonable rate.¬†
All the office peeps at the Unitech Infospace complex usually find this as a recluse, mostly on Fridays :D ( cuz the party begins the day after ).¬†
One can order their Chicken n mutton biriyani, quite value for money for an average restaurant.¬†
Their mixed chowmein is one of my personal preferences. The veg Manchurian, Chilly chicken n Reshmi butter masala is quite average. The kebabs spell nice and tender but not heavenly. Also,, I do not find the pulao upto the mark. Service is okayish, though the waiters are courteous enough.
Despite the pretty average settings, this'll continue to be a haunt for me with no other options available nearby.

Value for money and tasty; exactly this is how I would describe this restaurant. Have tried mutton and chicken biriyani, chicken tangri kabab, chicken tikka butter masala,veg chowmein, veg Manchurian.. I was overwhelmed seeing the quantity for the price paid.  The biriyani was tasty, couldn't finish a single plate. The kabab was nice so was the tikka masala. The trump dish for me was the veg Manchurian, it was hot, full of flavours, yummy. People residing or working in new town area definitely go for a bite here..
P.s. The wrapped plastic spoons they provide in take away is an added delight.

This restaurant is just opposite Tata Medical Centre and very close to Unitech Infospace and New Town Police station.

This place is just a normal restaurant with decent interiors. The biriyani which costs Rs. 150 per plate was okay. Starters like chicken 65, Crispy konjee chicken were okay as well. Tandoori roti was just 'thick maida sheet' which was no were near our expectation!

Though Dawat serves chinese main course in their menu, North Indian dishes are recommended. Hope they improve the quality of chinese main course, very soon!

This place is at a convenient location near a bus stand and in proximity to Infospace, DLF 2, Ecospace, Rabindra Thirtha, Techno India college, residential complexes like Green Field heights, Jalvayu Towers etc.

Main attraction here is the price shown in menu includes taxes. So, no additional taxes to paid above the charges shown in the menu

Horrible Experience...I am rating 1.0 as lower rating is not possible. I went yesterday with a couple of my colleagues as I work close by with the idea of a quick lunch at a new place. It was a horrible and most awful experience. We went and sat down and the waiter appeared almost 15 minutes later to take the order. and once we placed the order , it was around 45 minutes that we waited, a couple of group arriving before us got served. I went and inquired on the counter and the guy there was almost deaf to my requests. He did not pay attention to my questions till I asked thrice and then he handed over our order slip to the kitchen staffs. It was the kitchen staff that asked us to wait for 5-7 minutes. Another 20 minutes passed and by know we were getting restless. we went down and informed the counter guy that we are leaving and he did not even pay attention and said..ok..no problem....leave.That counter guy was so discourteous, and arrogant and I cannot comment on the food because we did not get any. I will not recommend it to anyone and have discouraged a lot of my other friends and acquaintances to go there. Please improve your service and take care of your customers.
It was a horrible and awful experience and living close to that place I had an idea of being a frequent customer but I will never be visiting it again and discourage anyone else who intends to do so

Dawat is a small joint that can serve as a desperate option in the bleak food scene of Newtown. Go with the right expectations and you will be fine :) Crispy chilli baby corn, navratan korma, rotis - all serviceable. The service is decent as well.

The quality of food might not be excellent but it's no way bad.. Given the price they charge the food provided justices it.
The service provided is also very good and friendly.

I have tried dawat now 3 times, and goodness me have they delivered!!! First time it was veg fried rice,  chilly mushroom,  and mix raita.  The fried rice was above average. The rice quality good and cooked right too. The mushroom used was canned. The chilly mushroom was dry as per my liking and instructions.  Nicely tempered chilly mushroom. The dahi used for mix raita was fresh and so the raita was also good.  Second time i had ordered a mushroom masala and it was above average. Good mushrooms  and good masala. Third time i ordered mix veg and the quality of vegetables was food and fresh. Masala was right,  not too spicy not too bland. Dawat might just surprise u. Waiting to try some non veg now.

It was the farewell lunch to our team leader and since our office is located at Ecospace, this is nearby. We ordered mutton biryani, tandoori chicken and chicken bharta. They delivered right on time. The biryani was really good both in taste and quantity. Bharta was also good. I would recommend the tandoori. It was really tasty, juicy and tender. Overall very nice and would recommend to all my friends.

Value for Money...the hard earned money is well spent here. Neither the quality nor the quantity is extraordinary. But...now here's the catch...its an all-rounder sort of place. Right from the staircase....it gives you the feel of a motel on the side of a highway.... :) now you know what I mean...A request to the authorities..please keep the blinds open...the view is much more appreciable then. Also the location is cool...A red krishnachura tree and some cattle grazing make it a shutterbugs' place. Now you might be wondering why I have described all about the exteriors and uneventful interiors without concentrating on the food. Well, there was not too much on my plate. Being a vegetarian there are not many options you can get here. I liked the laccha paratha very much. Its not dripping with oil as in other places. Its buttery and heavenly soft. The Paneer masala was well cooked too. And the biryani was too sweet for my liking. The raita was good though. Will visit this place next time only fo rthe laccha paratha dose :)

P.S. Service was painfully slow. But hey, its like a motel, so wont complain. At least they accept Credit cards. That too without the VAT and dreaded ST :)

But as ill luck would have it, what we found were almost 1.5 hours of wait for food!
Worst service ever,the waiters do not even keep track of the orders. The food quality was pretty bad! The garlic nun was no less than papads!
The funniest part is they do not have enough cutlery.We had to return the glasses used for waters, to get our lime sodas in those!!
Weird location ,plus hell of a service and bad food...makes Dawat a No-Never-Again place for me and my pals!
Good luck if any one opting !

We ordered from this restro for our one birthday celebration purpose and also we did not order much varieties. Only a few packet of mixed fried rice and chicken Manchurian and chilli paneer, this was all what we ordered.  Cost wise the food was okay, I would not say there was anything special to be highlighted, rather I would say the quantity was good. The fried rice could be a little more cooked as I found the rice a little hard. The Manchurian is definitely very good sonas the paneer.
The mixed fried rice could also have a few more prawns in it and what I dis not like is that they do not use card readers for parcel deliveries

This is the restaurant version of the very popular take away biriyani joint in Rajarhat, Biriyani Bar. Very uncharacteristic of its name though, it has Chinese in its menu as well. I had been here twice and had their mutton biriyani ordered. Accompanying it with chicken reshmi butter masala the first time, and chicken bharta the second time. The biriyani was rich and flavorful. I expected the mutton pieces a tad softer though. The chicken bharta was something worth mentioning, which came with finely shredded boiled egg on the top. You do not have enough restaurants in this locality, and thankfully this is not that bad.

the service was fine as the number of customers was not also very much that day. value for money is good i can say.

Very quiet and lonely place just opposite to tata cancer hospital. Ample parking place with very nice looking restaurant.
But visiting evening is a nightmare because of the flies and mosquitos around the new town area.
The restaurant was cozy the food was also good specially the tandoor dishes. The service is just ok and cannot expect much as there are not any taxes on the bill yet.
Worth to give a try once while on a long drive.
