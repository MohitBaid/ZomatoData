Like many students of the neighbouring school, South Point, I have spent countless afternoons at the shack's counter slurping away Noodles and Gravy. I do not have much experience with the menu here but i would definitely recommend giving it a try. Especially, Chilly Chick and Fried Rice. One of my best buddies, who currently is studying outside Kolkata has made a ritual to have the above mentioned dish whenever he comes to the city. For us its not just great food that lure us, but also great memories and nostalgia. 

PS- LOOKS RISKY BUT ISN'T ðŸ˜‹

I heart this place. <3
In the same lane as my school,Eats is a reminder of those days when we used to save money(10 rupees a day,everyday) to have the dry chilli chicken or the fried rice or chowmein,of those days when happiness was this cheap. :')
Glad that it's here on Zomato. :D 
And we have eaten here everytime we have gone back to the lane,whether for a Pujo re-union or the official 'Back to School' re-union.

Unexpectedly good ..particularly for south pointers its a place where they fill up there empty stomach with some tasty Chinese food within there small budget that they spend out of there pocket money :-P..Dry chilli chicken and fried rice has satisfied hungry me ample number of times. :-p

It's a pleasure to find this in Zomato. Visit the place more or less everyday, either have my own food or snatch it from my friends after school.
