One of my favourite places. The pork spare ribs is absolutely phenomenal and the clear soup with dumplings is something which I can have every single day. The portions are also appreciable. The staff is ever smiling. All in all a nice experience.

I visited here in December, and was presented with a ‘Christmas-special’ menucard…in other words, a curtailed menu. I was aware that many restaurants come up with a limited-option menucard during the Pujas, but this was the first time I experienced it during winters, despite the fact that it wasn’t New Year’s Eve/New Year’s Day or crowded…in fact we were the first patrons to step into the place that evening. Talk of ‘Jishu Pujo’–a la Durga Pujo–for Kolkatans!! 

It did lead to some disappointment, since I was hoping to try out some of the unconventional Chinese cuisine I had shortlisted from its Zomato menu. We ordered mixed Malaysian noodles which, we were informed, were flat noodles. When served, I found that it was different from the usual flat noodles served in Thai cuisine…the cross-section of this noodle was slightly square-ish. Its taste was also dissimilar, and except for the excessive diced onions, I quite liked it. The side dish of Mongolian chicken was done as per our instruction of medium spicy, and was delicious. So eventually, the food here did manage to bring the ‘Buddha’s smile’ on my face :))

The place is easy to locate and the food was good. But could be better. We went during durga puja so we did not have access to the full menu. Only limited options were available. The staff were well behaved.

Visited for a quick dinner on a weekday. It's a small place and was almost empty. It's beautifully designed and decorated with sculptures of Buddha and bells. I could just see one waiter. We ordered for a wonton soup. It was tasteless. It had spring onions and celery and 4 boiled wonton which lacked taste. 
For starters we ordered spring rolls - 8 pieces which was good and the chilli garlic paste which is a condiment. 
For main course we ordered mushroom fan rice. It was on the spicer side but was good and flavoursome. We ordered vegetables in manchurian gravy which was average. 
Would love to visit the place if they increase options for veggies.

Situated in the lane next to city life shopping centre, this is a very cozy family restaurant. The interior decoration is nice and the manager and other staffs are very warm and courteous. Tried dragon chicken, Singapore rice noodles and pepper schezwan chicken. Both the chicken dishes tasted great. The noodles needed to be prepared a bit more. Overall a nice experience.

I've already visited this place and reviewed too. As the place made me feel good with it's food,Ambience and hospitality. Now I ordered my lunch online . Let me share the experience. First of all, food quality is good as they always tey to maintain that. But if you provide a good hospitality at your place then please try to provide the same while you are sending your representative for home delivery. The address and every details were mentioned clearly while ordering. Still the delivery boy called at least 7-8 times . As he was not able to track . I mean they should have a gps tracker at least. After that the boy appears with a very very rude attitude. This was not at all expected man. I will think twice before ordering food from your restaurant.

Perfect place for chinese lovers. Though it is less spacious, the decor is attractive. Ambience, food and service are great. They provide huge quantities of food like one plate of fried rice can be easily served to three people. The starters and soup are finger licking good and one should definitely try grilled chicken hot basil.

Visited during the Puja Days on Panchami. It was a crowded affair, although we were lucky enough to grab a 4-seat table within half an hour of booking.

The interior has a decent look with pretty decor items and dim lights. Since we had a tight schedule due to pandal hopping in south, we didn't get much time to order starters but went straight with fried rice, manchurian chicken and a fish recipe.But what really disappointed me was their very slow service while taking order, bringing our order and also while taking the payment. We understand that there was Puja rush but bringing the bill from the counter couldn't take 20 minutes!Coming to the food, it was okay with less quantity. The fish recipe was delicious but nothing more to write about it.

Hopefully after the Puja, we might get a warm welcome from Buddha Bites for the next time.

Fantastic!! I really like this place.  Small joint but packs a punch with some rollicking food. 

Thumbs up : The feel of the place,  the place does give u a mental peace and relaxes u with the soft music. Coming to FOOD starting from soup to main course everything is a delight.  Manchow soup is awesome a must try and in the main course pot rice and egg wrapped fried rice.  Both are just wow :). 

Thumbs down : Prices are bit on the steeper side thus China calling,  tek Heng and mandarin could be a better option as food is equally good and tasty.  The place is small had it been bit bigger then it would've been better. 

My experience was very good there. I really love this place.

Visited tonight to meet our hunger pangs while puja pandal hopping. It was located beside tridhara puja pandal. They offered us the puja special menu. We ordered moon fun chicken fried rice which consisted of star anise and some other spices and general taos chicken. Which consisted of 10 pieces of boneless chicken. With medium spicy gravy. The food was tasty even in these rush hours. Might come back for more. The pocket pinch was also reasonable.

Buddha Bites is a well known Chinese  restaurant in kolkata. This gariahat outlet  is not very spacious, yet it's cozy. Three friends of mine and I have gone there today. It's  a festival day as it is durga puja saptami. so they have taken a little extra time to prepare our order. we have had dragon chicken as starter which was obviously  not enough for four people. In main course  we have had mixed fried rice, shezwan pork, and tawa chicken with brocoli. I want to order roasted chilli pork but it was not present  in the puja special menu. I will give the pork dish 5 out of 5. The pork was juicy and tender.  A must try place for the Chinese lovers.

Went to this place for the first time to avail the offer of Unlimited Chinese at Rs 235. We waited outside for 15 minutes before we got in. The decor inside was pretty good but the restaurant was dimly lit. The service was very slow. We were kept waiting for around one hour before we were actually served. This is a big disappointment itself. In this menu of unlimited Chinese we were served hakka noodles/fried rice, steam fish, chicken manchurian, veg/ fish manchurian and soft drink. The food tasted decent. The noodles and the steam fish were the star among all the dishes. So, apart from the waiting thing the overall experience is good considering the price and the quality of the food.

We dropped in here with 8 friends on the ongoing unlimited Chinese offer on Friday.It's a joint which can accomodate 26 approx at once and less spacious but well decorated.
At first it was absolute nuisance that they kept us waiting about 45minutes even after warning twice irrespective other people late to us were served first.It seemed on observation people present their for the unlimited offer were given less priority and attraction than others.
Coming to food,menu was assigned like for Rs.199 one can have egg noodles/fried rice;veg manchurian though were,but not served instead 2 fish dishes(Steam fish,Hong Kong fish) were provided in place of 1,and one garlic chicken with one glass soft drinks.Noodles was better but the fried rice was not upto mark.Steam fish was so-so.Else it satisfied our hunger with quality,and were served for extra time when wanted.
Would have given 4 star but the lack of service and management stopped me.

I loved the taste of each of the dishes. The quantity is satisfactory. The pan fried chicken noodles deserves special mention. We were so hungry that we finished the food within no time happily. Will definitely visit again. Have to try their fried ice cream which we couldn't due to health issues. The ambiance is nice as well. The service is prompt.

Buddha Bites is a well known Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. Went there for lunch last Sunday with friends. This brunch looks not that good from outside...I would recommend to renovate the outaide area. This brunch is not that big, can accomodate I guess around 20-25 people at a time. Ambience is nice and decor reminds one of a Buddhist monestry. We had Chicken Wrapped Prawn and Dragin Chicken as starters. Both the dishes impressed us. Specially the Chicken wrapped prawn was great. For the main course we had Roasted Lamb Fried Rice- tasted great , loaded with Lamb chunks, Singapore Rice Noodles- it was good, Fish in Schezwan Pepper Sauce- really good, fish was soft and fresh, Chicken meatballs in Spicy Oyster Sauce- only disappointment, meatballs were very dry. Servuce is good and quantity is really good. Price is not that high. Overall it was a good experience.

As good reviewed dishes we ordered a dragon chicken for starter, and a roasted chilli lamb with pork and mushroom fried rice for main course. The starter was just top notch with a great quantity. But the next two dishes were just a disaster although the quantity remained satisfactory. The service is good and quick though.

A nice chinese joint, which looks clean and serves good food. The preparations are similar to what most authentic chinese places offer, and the quantity is fair as per the pricing, we ordered dragon chicken for starters, followed by mixed haka noodles, mixed fried rice, and lamb in claypot sauce, the dragon chicken was really well prepared, but the lamb was a bit chewy, and not as good as other high end Chinese restaurant, would definitely order some other dish in lamb befor judging, overall a nice place to have dinner with your family.

A nice cosy place. Food was quite good. Though the service was late but the taste of the food made it worth while. 
The Soup was pretty tasty, perfectly thick with the right amount of seafood.
The Dragon Chicken was also quite tasty but a littke spicy and salty. Even after asking them to make it less spicy they didn't- so a setback there.
The Chicken Fried Rice was also good with a little extra salt.
The Roasted Chilli Lamb was again a good preparation but the salt was a bit high here too. 
Apart from there very slow service and there inclination towards salt, they were ok.

The noodles tasted like rubber bands to me. The decor is soothing and reflects Buddhist ambience. Music and TV played add to it. The waiters' appearance also give a similar feeling. A good experience.

✳ Miami Beach (drink) - Refreshing but not quiet appealing.
✳ Dragon Chicken (starter) - This dish absolutely bowled me over. The chicken shreds were tender and oh so succulent! Must try👍
✳ Seven Jewels Rice - It was pretty good. Generous portions of veggies used. Standard cooking.
✳ General Tao's Chicken - This dish didn't send any sparks since mom cooks better than this one. It was a slightly variant version of regular chilly chicken.
The ambience is really very pretty. The staff are cordial. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but it's okay for visiting once in a while :)

Food was okayish. The jazzy names of the dishes makes it difficult to understand what it actually is. Atleast the time i went the menu was like that. And no value for money. Very limited quantity at a  high price. However decor and ambience is good.

We ordered for a Chicken combo. The taste okay-ish, nothing special and moreover the quantity wasn't even sufficient. Don't ever go for a combo.

Ordered 
✳ Miami Beach (drink) - Refreshing but not quiet appealing.
✳ Dragon Chicken (starter) - This dish absolutely bowled me over. The chicken shreds were tender and oh so succulent! Must try👍
✳ Seven Jewels Rice - It was pretty good. Generous portions of veggies used. Standard cooking.
✳ General Tao's Chicken - This dish didn't send any sparks since mom cooks better than this one. It was a slightly variant version of regular chilly chicken.
The ambience is really very pretty. The staff are cordial. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but it's okay for visiting once in a while :)

A place with average food and excellent interior.
I liked the pork there but didn't really love it.
Oh well loved the mojito though!
So as the noodles were good but lacks to hit the right taste bud anyway.
Its not that expensive and yes one time visit is okay.
Its a nice restaurant but there are better.

A great place to start your day with. If you fancy a typical cool and calm place this is where you should go. The place is relatively small but comfortable enough for a group of 2-4. The must try starter is "Chicken wrap prawn" the rest of the foods are okay-ish.

First and foremost, there's a space crunch. A party of 7 - 8 cannot be accommodated. After much debate and planing and jostling around, this was sorted. Service is slow, the reason behind this is probably they are understaffed. Food is somewhat basic, we did not find anything worth mentioning. Portions were good.

Buddha Bites is a casual dining restaurant and one of my personal favourites. I love the ambience and the magical vibes that it generates when you enter the restaurant. It looks like an authentic Chinese dining area. They keep introducing new offers from time to time in food and beverages. I love the mocktails and the chicken starters. The main course includes the best Seven Jewel Rice I have had till date. Chicken Satay is good as well. It offers a wide range of Chinese dishes with a creative touch. Last but not the least, do not forget to try the fried ice-cream- it's their signature item.
The service is really good and impressive. Presentation of the dishes is average. The food is top notch and the price is more or less reasonable. A recommended dine out place from my side.

Went to this place for lunch. The size of the dining space is small but their interiors are beautiful. Coming to the food, we ordered :

•Thread spicy chicken - long pieces of boneless chicken wrapped in a crispy covering of fried noodles . Very tasty and crunch. I give it a 3.5/5

•General Tao's chicken - Chicken gravy with boneless pieces and vegetables. It has broccoli which is my favourite vegetable. The gravy is also tasty, not something very typical of the Chinese dishes served everywhere else. I give it a 4/5.

•Chicken fried rice - This is the plain chicken fried rice that's signature of the Chinese cuisine. Best part was that it wasn't oily at all. I give it a 4/5.

With tasty food being served at very good quantities, this makes for a pocket friendly restaurant.

I visited this place during a busy festive afternoon.
It is obvious that with enhanced business during festivals food quality drops below standards.
But after hearing much appreciation from fellow acquaintances about this place I ended up at this outlet of Buddha Bites. The ambience is sober with minimal decor and soothing. Coming to the food.
The food was not *wow* worthy. But it wasn't bad either. Among the dishes I liked and would recommend is the chilli mustard prawn, roasted chili lamb and pan fried noodles.

Walking from the city style end which is opposite traingular park. You find the place on left. 
Buddha bites has already made a name so far.  
Quantity and Quality are rich and nice.  Meifoon is awesome as well as the chilli garlic chicken.  
Lots of varieties but still better to stay with the standard food types.  
Service is attentive and well behaved.  
Always a happy visit.

Buddha Bites is located at Gariahat , which serves Chinese delicacies.

Ambience is very nice, almost like a Buddhist Monastery .

Sitting arrangenents is moderate.

Service is bit slow but staffs are cordial.

Tried Dragon Chicken, Mix fried rice and Kartisod.

Dragon chicken was tasty, juicy & spicy.

Mixed fried rice had generous fillings and was well cooked.

Kartisod is a dessert ( homemade coconut custard with vanilla icecream ) is mind blowing . A must try item.😘

Pocket pinch is bit high, but food is awesome.

My experience at Buddha Bites was quite decent although it cannot be compared with the the experience of having Chinese at China Town or even at a Tibetan restaurant. The food is okay for the price although it can be lower than what they offer. Quantity wise, it is decent enough to fill your stomach but they can offer more if they wanted to. On top of that, you are so overwhelmed by the ambience of the restaurant that you start expecting same in regards to the quality of food which is unfortunately not the case. It is a one off restaurant if you want to try it.

Long way to go...

Tried home delivery. Peking duck and Cantonese pan fried mixed chowmein.
Peking duck was terrible at 550/-.duck was right from the stone age:( no taste, stiffest meat in my life (almost numbness in my jaws!)..and not the least- they provided ordinary maida roti as bread!!
Then the chowmein - rubbery shrimp and crushing chicken in it, may be from frozen packet, eh?
I didn't understand why and on what basis Zomato grouped both these items as 'recommended' one??

.. foodies, be aware! Demonetization effect cripples in, especially upon non-selling, mindless restaurants!

... really long long way to go..

4. Stir fried chicken with broccoli with veg rice~ It was nice but not excellent... 
However overall it was good... will try their other items in future... till then this is it... yeah pocket pinch was considerable...

Cozy, comfy, plush,the three words that describe the ambience. I loved the decor and the soft Buddhist chants that surprisingly arouse an enigmatic feeling for food lovers. I ordered pan fried noodles, salt and pepper chicken, mustard chicken, fried rice and fried ice cream. The last one, strange as it may sound for some, it undoubtedly titillates your gateau tongue. My honest advise is pls try and you will revisit

Location: next to the lane beside City Style in Triangular park.

Decor: amazing, in a word. Gives you the feel of some monastery. Lord Buddha's sculpture greets you at the entrance. There are prayer wheels adding charm to the place and even bells hanging from the ceiling.
Food: we ordered 3 chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, 2 spicy chicken, 2 fried ice cream. Each and every item proved to be really good.

Quantity: Decent. All our ordered dishes were good for 4 people.

Pocket pinch: acceptable. Our bill was 1832

Recommended, definitely.

I was quite eager to try this place out and I managed to get myself to make a move on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks back. 

Now, I had at the time seen a special menu on Zomato of Bowl meals but to my disappointment, they didn't have it. 

So I ended up ordering a Prawn dish with fried rice. 

I must say the taste was really good. I quite liked it and ate quite a lot of it. There was still some left and I got it packed. 

I was very keen on trying their fried ice cream so I ordered that for dessert. 

The Ice cream was really tasty and it was really filling. However I feel it could have been a little more refined in presentation. Also the crispy exterior seemed to break off from the ice cream so that too was a minor disappointment. 

The prices are a little bit high, not too high but high enough to feel a pinch. 

As a whole though, I had a good experience but I'm not sure if I'd be back anytime soon. 

So only recommended as a trying out experience but not as a "go to restaurant".

Rating-

Food: 2.2/2.5

Pricing: 0.3/0.5

Ambience: 0.4/0.5

Staff Behaviour: 0.3/0.5

Other Intangibles (based on my personal experience as a whole): 0.6/1

Total: 3.8~4!

Happy Dining!!

This place was in my wish list from a lonnnnggg time. So at last I do visit this place..and it was a first salary treat from my elder brother..So I was very happy. 

Situated at gariahat,u will find no difficulties to locate Buddha Bites...just go through the lane beside Citi Style.. And it is situated at the last to the lane.

Ok so we visited the place on weekdays,and I found the place not to big..hardly 30-40people can eat at a time. But their ambiance is excellent... With dim lights,mild music at the background..tibetian decorations..just loved it. 

Now comes the main part...the Food. For starter we ordered dragon chicken and chicken wrapped prawn. And  kung pao chicken,pan fried mixed noodles and roast chilli pork for main course.

First comes the DRAGON CHICKEN...it was just delicious and mouthwatering, perfectly cooked with proper spices. The quantity was sufficient too. Just loved this one. 


CHICKEN WRAPPED PRAWN was a big surprise for me. Because I was not sure how prawn and chicken would taste together..but it proved me wrong as well. Eight big pieces of prawns were nicely coated with chicken and cooked to perfection..where the prawn is not rubbery and soft,juicy inside so as the chicken outside..It had some ginger sauce coated.. And the quantity was very satisfying. 

Now comes the main course. 
KUNG PAO CHICKEN was another signature dish of their authentic Chinese cuisine. What they served was beyond my expectations... With lots of cashews and spicy tangy chicken chunks...it was light but spicy at the same time. Delicious.

PAN FRIED NOODLES had a good quantity..with lots of small chicken,prawns..veggies inside...pan fried well with spices & sauces...had a mild taste but flavourful. It accompanied well with my chicken.  

I didn't tasted the chilli roasted pork though..but it was good in quantity and looked tempting. And my brother said it was good too..tasteful & satisfying if you love pork.

So that's it. I was so full and happy at the end of our meal...double happy as I didn't had to pay for the day..Ha ha.. 

The staffs were very much well behaved,and attentive to us...which pleased us really. So overall for me a great experience, I will highly recommend this place if you wanna satisfy your Chinese taste buds.. Go for it.

When it comes to have chinese in a speciality group of this bandwidth, i shall still recommend Chowman over Buddha Bites, though never can i acknowledge the latter to be worse in any segment. Food quality is really good, awesome interiors too; though prices are a bit high. It serves pork and beef equally of good quality. Overall satisfied.

One of the best chinese joint in Kolkata now. They have many outlets and take away counters across the city. Try their chicken dishes in different sauces, it's amazing. Soups are also great. The best part about them is their hospitality and soothing ambience and pocket friendly menu. Must try for chinese lovers.

The decor was quite good,dim lighted
Now let me speak about the food,they offered us delicious food..we ordered sweet and sour chicken,the chicken was very tender, Singapore chilli prawn ,that was the best thing it was so delicious and fried chicken rice which was delicately cooked

Highly recommended:Singapore chili prawn or anything in prawn

Might be the there was too much rush due to Puja and hence not a good time to judge the place.

Although the space is a bit crunchy and hence the comfort too is a bit compromising, nonetheless the food quality and quantity is very good. I first visited this place on Saptami, Durga Puja and surprisingly they have maintained the taste of the food. Usually the restaurants compromise a lot on the taste when the rush or crowd is high. Loved the ambience, the food and the service. Good experience.

This place was on my wishlist for a long time and finally paid it a visit on Saptami.There was a long queue as expected and we had to wait for an hour to get a table.On entering the place I found out that it was small..nevertheless ambience was nice.The best part about the place was its food! In starters we had Pan fried fish and it was absolutely awesome! It was spicy though and had a lot of green chilies so not recommended for people who do not like hot and spicy food.In the main course we ordered Moon fan fried rice(chicken) and Five spice chicken.The rice was good..though not great..tasted like normal fried rice only.The chicken dish was good.It was mild and was different than the usual Chinese chicken dishes.Quantity was also very good.Service was not bad despite being crowded.But the thing that struck me the most was the difference in prices of the food items in the normal menu and the Pujo special menu.According to the normal menu,one can have a chicken side dish+rice/noodles at 400Rs, but they charged us 360bucks for just the chicken dish..we had to order the rice separately for 185 bucks.The starter was priced at 250bucks.The way how they loot people on such festive days is really disappointing.

This review for one of the prestigious brands of Chinese food in the city comes at a time when there are a lot of options for this type of food. But the selection of the right joint is very crucial if you are really looking for the right kind of quality at the amount you spend . At buddha bites you will get the perfect quality of food that can be available at that amount . 

° Location :- You will have to pass the gariahat triangular park and get down at Citi style gariahat .Then you will have to take the lane which is situated just beside Citi style , walk at the 4 point crossing and you will reach Buddha bites .

° Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Not a big restaurant but I was very very impressed with the ambience . The dim lights , the soothing Tibetan music and the seating is ideal for couple eat out . The restaurant is beautifully decorated . As for the service , they are really very cordial , attentive to all the customers and will serve you to the best of their ability .

----------------------------

° Food :- I had already visited the behala joint so i was aware that there was little chance of getting dissapointed . We were there as a couple which is sometimes problematic in a Chinese restaurant as they really serve a quantity which is good for 3 to 4 people . But to solve this issue we ordered the items that are perfect for 2 person  outing :- 

1. Chicken wrapped prawn ( 10 / 5 ) :- The rating speaks for itself . This is probably the best Chinese starter in the city and Mark my words , if you have not tried this out yet , you are really missing out on something . I think this starter should be inside the top 10 things to eat in the city . It is that good . Priced at 375 and touted as their signature starter , they serve 6 pieces of prawn wrapped in succulent chicken and cooked in spicy ginger sauce . The size of the prawn is really big and we absolutely loved the dish . Everything was perfect about the dish and i will suggest all the Chinese lovers out there never to miss this one . Forget everything else , just order this .

2. Pan fried noodles mixed ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Once again an impressive dish . Once again perfect for 2 people dining . The quantity of the noodles is huge as you will notice once they serve it from a big square bowl made of glass . The quality is stunning , the noodle us fried perfectly with non soya gravy . The amount of chicken and prawn was perfect to our liking . And the veggies were perfect too. We loved every bit of it and once again it is highly recommended .

3. Fried ice cream ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Had a lot of expectations but not that impressed . It was a big scoop of ice cream coated by a layer which tasted like tiger biscuits . Still a good enough desert to try out .

-------------------------------

° Verdict :- Oh, no doubt that it is a must visit for all Chinese lovers . Try to order their signature items as they are really unique and are truly very very tasty .Following are the main points :- 

1. Decent ambience . Small and cosy .
2. Awesome quality of food .
3. Almost the best starter in the city . The chicken wrapped prawn . yummy .

This is one of the must try outs of gariahat .So, in this puja season just go for it , if you still have not tried out .

This restaurant is located to the left at the end of the lane that lies beside City Style , Gariahat , and is easily recognizable with its facade resembling a Buddhist Pagoda ! The staff are warm and courteous and the ambiance takes one immediately to a hilly area to the north east of our country , with accompanying music . The interiors have a warm and ruddy appearance , soothing the nerves as you dig into your favourite dish ! The Duck with pineapple and spicy sauce was the best  I have ever had, with perfectly cooked pieces of boneless duck meat , cooked in a sweet and slightly spicy sauce , giving it an amazing sweet and sour flavour that lingers in the mouth . The singapore  rice noodles tasted equally good , the amount being just about enough for three . The fried ice cream we had for dessert tasted great too, with a thick crispy outer layer , holding inside  it some good ol' vanilla ice cream . They even serve extra chocolate sauce on request ! Whereas most restaurants serve fennel seeds (mouri and michhri) with the bill, these people gave us a handful of mints , which was unusual ! Overall , had an awesome experience and would love to visit again !

I tried this resturant before but recently i visited but i'm very dissapointed by their food and their service. Before also i hsve ordered their pan fied noodles that was yummy before but now they only serve noodles, less veggies less prawn less chicken, and even before they used to serve pork with that now that also has been excluded from the mixed panfried noodles. Taste is so poor. I had ordered for lemon corriender soup that was also so spicy, taste was also detoriated. Buddha bites you need to improve your food quality to serve well.

We visited this place today afternoon. It is a small, cozy place, about 30 seconds walk from the main road. The inner decor strives to project an Oriental feel. A soft Chinese folk music started playing in the background after about 30 minutes of our stay in that place. We were the first customers. The staff was courteous. We ordered
1. Chicken wrapped prawn (375 rs)-starter
2. Chicken Buddha feast (200 rs)-main course
3. Seven jewels rice (160 rs)-main course
We got a choice of a complimentary rice to go along with our main course and we chose Egg Rice.
The starter was good. A little spicy. You get a choice of the sauce- schezwan or manchurian. We got juicy prawn pieces wrapped in spicy chicken and we found it quite likeable. Chicken buddha feast was neat, good to taste and very salubrious. We very much liked the preparation. The seven jewels rice was decent. 
All in all, we had a very pleasant experience. And a funny thing- we got chloromints in stead of the usual mint which is offered at the end of the meal.:)

I have been to Buddha Bites a number of times.
Small and organized place, decent background score, well mannered staff and mouth watering food are their specialty.
Please look for chicken wrapped prawn and pan fried fish for starters, whole steam fish, fish in garlic sauce, duck meat and Chicken Buddha feast, pork preparations along with seven jewel rice for main course and fried ice cream for dessert.
A little overpriced though.

Horrible main course food. We had ordered crispy chilli baby corn which was OK. then we had gen tao's chicken with chicken noodles. Noodles was without any taste, just tasteless stuff and we had to find chicken into it. The chicken dish taste was ok, BUT THE PIECES OF CHICKEN WERE LIKE BIG SIZED SOYABEANS....nothing very tasty, quantity wise so miser, it is totally waste of money. we should have gone to a different chinese restaurant...only the ambiance was good......horrible experience, money gone to drain.......

This restaurant is located on panditia road,just a few steps from CITI STYLE(garment shop ,triangular park). Car parking would be a very easy affair as there was ample space for parking.The interior was classy & the soft back ground music would definitely set the mood.
The food was just pathetic!Yes you read it right.This eatery should be named BUDDHA SWEET SHOP.I had asked for chilli pork,double cook prawn,chicken in basil,gen tao's chicken,mixed rice & noodles.Each & every dish was sweet in taste.the mixed rice had a sheer resemblance with POHA(read chirer polau in bengali).The total bill amount was over 3000.The attendant had guided us wrong with insisting us to take one more bowl of noodles.The so called PARAR DOKAN has a better sense of taste than BUDDHA BITES.Moreover me & my three companion had a stomach upset on the very next day.I should have spend this much money on a proper chinese restaurant.

quantity wise, quality wise this restaurant is worth visiting. soothing ambiance and warm reception are some other good things to be found here. to me it's awesome to dine out when exploring oriental cuisines. under the expert recommendation of the waiter uncle, we dug in many items of which the starter too good, the combo meals were fine, so were the main course and desserts (specially fried ice-cream, exceptional)!
so, let the pictures do the talking!

This place is located in the lane opposite to triangular park, gariahat. The dining place is a bit on the smaller side but the ambiance is sure to surprise you. The food was too delicious. We had chicken fried rice with schezwan lamb in a combo for just 200 ( best part is it even includes the tax). Alongside we had pan fried mixed noodles which was in ample quantity to serve two of us. 
A nice place to have chinese food

The place is really small,the ambience is okay,the food was really great and the rating is solely for the good taste of the food,the waiters were efficient but not much amicable...they do not provide 'mukhshuddhi'(like fennel seeds) after the lunch which I think was bit depressing,they provided chlormint though(but that totally spoilt the taste).. Their recent introduction of nonveg meal in a bowl is really pocket friendly and the taste is really good,we also ordered for a bowl of pan fried noodles,which is enough for two people and taste good too.. Overall it's a good experience and worth a try :)

Buddha Bites is one of the premier affordable Chinese joints in Kolkata. A frequent deliverer of Chinese food, they make really good noodles, which is a rarity. Often Chinese restaurants make good rice, but falls short in terms of noodles. Also, the pepper schezwan pork is absolutely brilliant. My favorite Chinese dish is Kung pao chicken, which I'm afraid is not their best. Still, great pork dishes, good noodles, fast delivery- good enough for a 4.0 rating!

I had wishlisted this place for a long time. Finally I ordered food from here, thanks to Zomato food delivery!

The location is spot on - the street adjacent to Citi Style, right at Triangular park. 

Since I've not visited the joint, I can't say anything about its interiors but it seems to be pretty decked up from outside. 

Coming straight to the food :

• First, and foremost I would give them a thumbs up for their amazing quantity. It's more than enough for 2 adults. 

• Each of the items were beautifully prepared. Authentic Chinese food at very affordable rates. 

We had ordered :
• Pan fried fish - this tasted very good with the right amount of spice and tanginess. The fish was prepared so well that the pieces were melting in my mouth. And not to mention, the pieces were big fat ones. 
• Five Spice Chicken with Egg Chow - I really liked their concept of the combo meal. At 400 bucks you get the main course which is sufficient for 2! Really a money saver. The chicken dish was good, but it tasted pretty mild after the spicy pan fried chicken. Nonetheless it went well with the chow. The quantity of chow, too, was very good. With ample amounts of egg, the chow has a beautiful flavour. Kudos to the chef and his team. 
Really amazing food!

Another point that I would like to highlight is the behavior of the man who I had talked to over the phone to get info about the food items. He was really well behaved and very patient with me and heard out all my doubts. Thank-you so much for an amazing dinner!

Pocket pinch - 650!

I'm definitely going to visit the much decked up outlet at Triangular park to relive the awesome food experience!

Buddha Bites is a cosy Chinese diner near Triangular Park that serves decent Chinese fare at affordable prices. I have been to Buddha Bites almost 5-6 times, but could never wrote up the review. However, post a recent visit to the eatery and the good food that we were served, I took it onto myself to do the needful at the earliest. 
The decor is simple and elegant. The restaurant can sit about 30-35 people at the time. Statues of Buddha and wall graffiti give the interiors a nice touch. The huge Buddha at the entrance is certainly something to look at. 
It was a weekday and we wanted to keep the dinner simple. We started with the seafood spicy lemon coriander soup. However, the soup was anything but spicy. We expected it to be somewhat spiced up, but sadly it was a lemon favoured broth with a dash of coriander sprigs and seafood. The soup was accompanied by Dragon Chicken. Now this was certainly tasteful and spicy. It had a slight gravy and the chicken was thinly battered and nicely stirred up with the sauce. The main course was a chicken in black bean casserole. Now Buddha Bites does an interesting this here. You only order the chicken or the vegetable or the fish or the seafood mains and the staple noodles/rice comes with the mains; you dnt need to order that separately. However there's a catch. The portion of the noodles/rice is barely sufficient for two moderate adults; but if you want a spoonful more or you are in a group of three willing to share the mains, then you are in a fix. You need to order the staples separately, at least for one person. This is something I found dicey about Buddha Bites. Let the customer order the staples separately. Buddha Bites let's you choose between veg of non-veg rice or noodles and if you want anything different, you order for it separately. This isn't really a welcome thing always as there maybe people looking to try something other than the supplied staples. 
Anyway, the place is extremely economic. A meal for two shouldn't set you back by more than 1200-1400; and I mean a full 3 or 4-course meal. The service is decent and fairly fast.

While returning from a wonderful musical concert, me and a friend met up at gariahat with a common friend. Though there were a plethora of places to go to we decided to go to this place.
Since all three of us were famished and it was drizzling outside we went for a seafood coriander soup which was awesome and quite rewarding. The wait time was amazingly short and the waiters well versed with the menu. The ambience was very cosy, though I feel the tables could have been spaced out a wee bit more to prevent conversational trespassing!

The grilled chicken hot basil was really good.The Chinese greens or something similar was quite sumptuous. It would be sacrilegious to cook up the other dishes which we had ordered since my memory fails me now.I know it requires another visit to the place.

Commonly mistaken to be an everyday, regular, small Chinese restaurant, Buddha Bites actually is just the opposite. Entering this place immediately takes us to a distant place in China- the subtle, relaxing hymn that plays in the background, the bronze looking bells hanging from the ceiling and the skyscraper-like investment done on the Buddhas; a miniature Shaolin Monastery at a small corner of Kolkata.

Speaking of location, Buddha Bites is concealed from the buzz of the street. This little place is located on a more residential area which makes it difficult to spot. When you're coming from Desapriya Park towards Gariahat, look out for a City Style and enter the lane that runs beside it. Your destination would be a few minutes walk away.

Coming to food, the price range may be on the higher side but they also have a combo meal menu for people with less heavier pocket. And the best part about this restaurant is that they don't charge you with tax.

*Spicy Wanton Soup: This soup may not be the most prettiest soup you'd lay your eyes on, but trust me it tastes pretty darn good. A light, clear soup with cabbage and basil leaf with stocked up flavour. The broth is watery and the wanton is perfectly steamed and seasoned well. (3.5/5)

Combo meal
*Chicken Fried Rice: Fried rice with chopped carrot and spring onion. Neither too oily nor too dry. Decent in taste. (3/5)

*Five Spice Chicken: Four pieces of chicken served with gravy and big chunks of capsicum and onions. Chicken pieces were a disappointment. The meat was tough, thus it was difficult to chew. There was also an overpowering flavour of Chinese spices. This dish is not recommended. (2/5)

Few food items here may be a let down, but the dedicated staff team almost makes up for it. The service is noticeably faster than your regular restaurants. I got my entrée served hot and fresh in five minutes. I'm pretty happy with Buddha Bites management team. Well wishes to them!

One of the elite places in Kolkata to have Chinese delicacies.... I absolutely loved their decor which gives a Buddhist monastery vibe.. Ambience is lovely with slow sax instrumental playing in background.
Perfectly neat place ...I loved the glasses 😉

Coming to food, we had a full meal course :
Started of with the soup, VEG MANCHOW it was - thick and well prepared with generous amount of veggies in it. They served it with dry crispy noodles. Presented it with scallions over it. Portion was humongous. 😀
.
In main course we ordered KUNG PAO CHICKEN & MIXED STIR FRIED HAKKA NOODLES - kung pao was proper n authentic ...with loads amount of cashews n nuts in it...making it very rich...totally loved the savoury dish..and it had eight pieces of chicken in it.
Mixed hakka tasted as usual. Again portions were nice.😇
.

We ended the meal by ordering ice- cream with darsaan in desserts which is my absolute favourite. Darsaan had the perfect crunch. 😄
.
So I loved each n every dishes I ordered, therefore well enjoyed!
.

Waiters were smart n prompt and service was quite quick, and proper hospitality was maintained all through. 😊
.

There won't be any vexation regarding the recommendation of this restaurant from my side. Hence, RECOMMENDED! 👑

This is a cozy little restaurant near Triangular Park. You have to take the lane next to Citi Style and the restaurant is at the first turn to your left. A few years back the same place used to be the office of the theater group Charbak. The space inside is small, but the decor is nice. The waiters are efficient and friendly.

The food is good, but not great. I like their Kung Pao Chicken and salt and pepper chicken. They used to make great barbecue pork ribs, but that is no longer available  on their regular menu. They still make it sometimes on special request.

If you are looking to eat out at a place with good ambiance, Buddha Bites is great. But if you are looking for really good Chinese food, a much cheaper option is available at a stone's throw distance.

The place is a bit congested due to less space availability. The decor is good. Coming to the food, we ordered for stir fried lamb with bell peppers n it was truly disappointing. The quantity of lamb was too less as compared to the price which was shocking to us. The rice n chicken was blunt in taste. My experience will certainly not provoke me to visit once again. Overall its not worth u spend for ur food here.

I have ordered for 2 plates of Seven Jewels Rice through online booking. The first order no was 6250 & it was supposed to be delivered at my residence at 8.15-8.30 pm which is a stone throwing distance from the restaurant(Panditiya Road). On enquiry at 8.30 pm, I was told that the order was cancelled as I opt for on line payment which it did not processed. I again had to place the order (order no 6254) for the same & I told them that I will collect it from the restaurant. I was denied with the bill as well the payment thru card. I collected the food on payment of cash without any bill. The food was no doubt good as I am a frequent visitor.The staff decline to provide the bill & said that no bill is provided for on line payment. I am really surprised to hear such thing although VAT & price of the container has been charged in the price of the product??? Is it because the restaurant is offering 40% discount thru online booking?

I ordered pepper schezwan lamb in casserole for delivery. The delivery was on time.

As for the food, this item is a lamb and vegetables cooked in a gravy, served with veg rice or noodles - I had opted for noodles. The noodles were nicely done - great texture, and it wasn't too oily. The pepper schezwan gravy was very good too. However, what spoiled the dish was the chewy pieces of lamb. Had the lamb been done better, this would have been a great dish. The quantity was good for one adult and a child.

For home delivery, given the quantity and the quality, the price seems a bit high.

Overall, the food is interesting enough to make me think of visiting the restaurant sometime to try out some more dishes.

#ambience: its a small place but well decorated one. Ambience is really nice. Soothing. Peaceful. Eating becomes more joyful for their lovely tunes music.
#food: well I tried chicken hakka noodles and kung pao chicken. The chicken was really good. It was slightly on the sweetish hot. Really good. 
But the noodles was too dry, which could have been much better.

Overall nice experience. I will go back to try some lamb dish next time.

I really haven't tasted such stiff chichken and supposedly stored for a while which made it so stiff and dry!!! I think I have been generous in rating their food!!!

A cozy place to hangout... Love the interior which goes well along with the name of the restaurant...  ambience is good.  coming to the food,  its just awesome..  They have a unique taste of their own.. I loved the kung pao chicken..  Just one thing to remember, the spicy items are little more spicy than other Chinese restaurants

Buddha bites!!! Yes, you will get to know here buddha will literally bite your pocket after seeing the bill you'll have to pay... I visited this place and had seven jewels rice, chicken broth and fried ice cream... Don't know whether or not they named the preparation of rice as "seven jewels" keeping in mind of the seven wonders of the world or of the seven kingdoms in GoT.... Nevertheless, I had found no such "jewel" thing in that rice, rather the rice smells of something like fart! The prep of chicken tasted like half cooked chicken  dipped into uncooked soya sauce and decorated with fresh nd raw cabages and some veggies you will get to see cattles having those in the countryside... Only the fried ice cream was something good to be noteable... Hence, I would like to say, if you want to taste chinese, NEVER EVER visit this place...

Awesome food ..!! The lamb dishes are delicious and I'm gonna compare lamb dish of every other restaurant or food lounge to Buddha Bites', going forward! It's kind of set a different parameter of savouring lamb dishes for me. I'm so delighted .. I just wish it had a few extra acre of space for accommodating more foodies!

Had visited the place quite some time ago. The restaurant is located on Panditia road just opposite Triangular Park. Take the lane adjacent to City Style and you will reach in 5 min.

Décor: Once you enter the place you would have a feeling that you have entered a monastery because of the large Buddha statue, a big karma wheel and place full of painting. Beautifully done up place. Comfortable seating arrangement though the place is small with about 30 seating capacity.

Food: We ordered sea food clear soup, chicken wrapped prawns, chilly roast pork, clay pot mixed fried rice and steamed crab in wine sauce.
Quality of food is beautiful, loved the Chicken wrap prawns which were very succulent, flavour of sea food soup was great and crab is a must have. Chilly roast pork is ok, would prefer if lean pork is used for the dish.
I was happy that quality and quantity of food of Buddha Bites has not dipped over time.

Service: One thing the team should focus on. The waiters and person taking the order should be more warm and polite. They should know their menu in detail so that they can help the customer while ordering.

Pocket Pinch: For two persons about Rs.800+. Worth it as quality and quantity of food is good.

A must visit for a Chinese food lover. I will be definitely going back for more. Kudos to the Buddha Bites team.

The place is small but the ambience and decoration is nice. We ordered thai fried chicken, squid pepper chilli and double cook prawn combo meal.
The chicken was delicious but the squid was a bit too salty. In combo the prawn was very tasty but the chicken noodles was okay okay.  Overall it's a good place.

True to it's name the decor of this place is very "buddha inclined" 😂 if I can put it that way. It's painted in red with a big statue of buddha welcoming you, as you enter. The seats are comfortable, dimly lit, moderately big space(could get cramped during peak hours). The staff is very attentive, well informed and helpful. Now coming to the food, the lamb dishes and prawn dishes are specifically noteworthy. Oh also the fried ice cream! 😍 Must try out if you haven't already.

My friend from the US visiting India after 4 long years was craving for dumplings and Indian chilli chicken. Where else to take him but this hidden delight!!!! We Bengalis haven't left any Chinese restaurant unexplored in Kolkata I'm certain of that, some left us ecstatic, while some disappointed. But this one place will leave you pleased, full and happy everytime you pay them a visit. Don't miss it!
P.S. Try their Cantonese noodles and chilli pork too!

This is a very cozy and nice restaurant. The items are on the higher side but the food is really good. The chicken dimsum is a must try.  The chicken satay is really delicious and it is served with an equally delicious peanut sauce. 
The pan fried fish was good. Flaky fish with the right amount of seasoning.

A quaint litle joint situated at the corner of Panditia Road , Buddha Bites is exactly what it promises : A no-frills restaurant. To be honest , I didn't have too many expectations from this place but I was highly impressed. Very small with minimal decor , the staff was very courteous and made us feel welcome . Food was absolutely yummy and portions were humongous. The Mixed Fried Rice is to die for and the Chilli Pork is another stunner of a dish. Prices were quite reasonable and service was prompt. A perfect para joint to relax and enjoy with friends :)

The place is small but the food is very good.
We ordered water melon cooler,pan fried chilly fish ,squid,  general tao's chicken in the combo meal and mushroom and pork fried rice.
The squid was a bit too salty for my taste.All the other food were delicious. 

One opinion : they have introduced this new combo meals in their menu where if you order a main course it comes with veg noodles or rice.And it is compulsory. They form have a separate menu for main course apart from rice and noodles.So basically the price goes higher even of you don't want what comes with it.As for me I didn't want the veg noodles at all and hence I had to order the rice.

This is a pretty small area , but serving great quality food undoubtedly. We basically had a Chinese spread, and I have no complaints against that. For dessert I ordered a fried ice cream.. but to my disappointment the fried layer was not up to the mark.. it was really hard and soggy kind of.. and the ice cream within was too frozen.

So finally i visited this place with my sister for a lunch. Small restaurant with 5-6 tables. It is located right beside city style in triangular park. We quickly jumped to the main course as i was damn hungry . We ordered chicken garluc hakka noodles and chicken in black bean sauce . The price range is affordable. Noodle was good , tasty. Quantity was sufficient for two person . They served you 10 small chicken pieces in black bean sauce. I felt the sauce was bit less. And size of the chicken was bit on the lower key acc to the price. But tasted good. I liked it overall. Ambience :- 2/5 . Light chinese music was played on the background and dim lights . Can be visited with your friends and families as the pocket pinch is only 530 rs for two without starters.

I have been to the bhowanipur outlet of Buddha Bites, and was satisfied with the food and ambience. This time, I decided to order in from the Gariahat outlet through Zomato. Once the order was placed, I received a call from the restaurant to ask if they should change one of the orders, as I had mentioned that I didn't want anything sweet, and the item I had requested was a sweet preparation.
The first thing that happened was that the delivery person arrived about 20-25 min late. The second problem was that despite having placed the order for 3 rice plates, I received one,but I can still excuse this issue, taking into consideration that they took immediate action when I called them about it, and apologised profusely.
Coming to the dishes, u have mixed feelings about them. If only taste and aroma are to be considered, then yes, the food was absolutely delicious, with unique flavours. But, food is more than just taste. The roast chicken dish had pieces with bones, which was not mentioned on the menu, or during the conversation. Plus, the pieces were overcooked, and extremely tough and chewy. The lamb dish was great, my only complain being the amount of actual meat pieces was quite small. Both the dishes were very oily. All in all, I can say that the experience ws nothing more than average. I was disappointed with the food, and felt it was not worth the amount. Extra point for the well behaved staff, though.

Decor is pretty nice, and the staff really warm. Their appetisers are really good, especially the seafood ones. Their mustard fish left me going for more. Generous quantities served, moderate service. But please do not go for the desserts. Really not worth the price. I find cornetto a better substitute any day. Overall, a nice place to go

It was really awesome in its ambiance, hospitality and food quality. the place might be a bit tight in peak hours becoz of its constraint seating capacity. But mark my words, When ever u get a seat, order anything you like from the small subset of menu.....THE Buddha Bites will amaze you

Beautiful decor and ambience. They have designed the place really well. Location: Gariahat. 
We got one veg sweet corn soup which we absolutely relished. In main course took one moon fan rice and one roasted chilly pork. The rice was good though not extraordinary. But the pork was great. It was succulent and soft and very well cooked. The prices are slightly on the higher side. But their ambience is totally charming.

Bad experience with gariahat location of buddha bites. 
Service was seriously lagging.
We had taken the most simplest of menu items.
The starters were good, dragon chiken and pan fried fish.
The soup was utmost disgust , a simple sweet and sour chicken had no taste at all.
Then came the block bluster failure of all , the main dishes .
It was an irony that even the simplest of egg wrapped fried rice was just rubbish. No difference with schezwan fried rice and mixed fried rice as well. Kung pao chicken was like as sweet as like dipped in rosogolla syrup. 
Had heard of the name of buddha bites lot of time but would never ever go back.

1st time ordered home delivery through zomato. I ordered Pepper chilli tofu, crispy chilly babycorn, mongolian fried prawn, fish spicy ginger sauce. 
All the preparations were good the best was Mongolian fried prawn but it will taste good if you have it in restaurant in home delivery didn't feel that magic. Got a 15% discount for ordering through zomato which was really good for me.

Buddha Bites does bring in a distinct flavor quotient to its dishes. I have ordered from this joint on many occasions, most of these times being a take away. The interiors though pleasantly inviting I have not had the chance to sit here and enjoy my meals, but I surely do look forward to it.

Buddha Bites is a part of the new generation of eateries that have cropped up throughout the city, introducing their very own angle to different cuisines for the urban spending crowd. The food served at this specific outlet has never disappointed me, but it has neither given me the opportunity to gasp with joy. The flavors are nice, the quality is not compromised on either. 

Some of the items I generally order from this outlet are- dragon chicken, pan fried fish, pepper chilli prawn and KungPao/Basil Oyester/Red Cook Chicken. You must try the fish in black bean sauce, that is good too. One dish I particularly stay away from is the Chilli Mustard fish, too strong for me, might not be for someone else.

Well this is a long pending review....I am partial to places with good thematic ambiance and concept, this is no exception....
- In one word I can say that the food is good but nothing more than that. Kolkata has a good enough connection to the Tibetan culinary culture and places like this should do more for that (quality, variety, et all....). 
- However, having said that I have to confess that I fell for the layout with the Tibetan motifs and illumination panels, it took you to a different world from this bustling city and I was thankful for that....

This place therefore does merit a visit, figure your own reviews for the food though...

Me and my friends had visited this place with huge expectations, but we were terribly disappointed.

It was a weekday, and we decided to have a quick lunch outside. Since the place has a small seating capacity, we had to wait for nearly 30 minutes to get a table. The initial impression after entering the restaurant was great. The interiors are done in a Tibetan manner with various statues of Buddha, beautiful lighting, prayer wheels, and a soothing music playing in the background.

We ordered the following: Hakka noodles, Seven Jewels Rice, a Lamb main course, and a Chicken main course.

When the foods arrived we were really surprised looking at the quantities of each. Especially the noodles and rice were way too less than what similar restaurants serve. 

The foods tasted pretty ordinary. With the tiny portions, and average tastes, there was nothing to justify their high prices.

AMBIENCE: 3.5/5

FOOD: 2.5/5

Although the nice ambience raised our expectations, the average and overpriced foods let us down. Overall it was an awful experience for us.

Buddha bites is very true to it's name,looks like a mini buddhist monastry. The ambience is soothing and the music in the background is in sync with it's decor. We started off with coolers like virgin mojito and pink panther followed by the chicken satay(recommended). The chicken satay was really good coming in sticks with a little gravy. In the main course we had schezwan chicken fried rice along with five spice chicken.. This is first time i had fried rice which is cooked in coconut oil..the taste was differenr but not that bad. Finally comes the most awaited one. In dessert we had the most popular fried ice cream. This was my first time and it was one of the best desserts i had till date. Overall it was good and wish to come back soon and try out the other dishes..

A very good restaurant for taking a quick bite. A small house yet it makes up for the food. The ambience is nice inside. The inside decor is themed like a Monastry and even have prayer wheels. The best you can have here are Barbecue Pork Ribs. We even wanted to order squids but it wasn't readily available. The staff is friendly. I loved the starter more than the main course here. Ordered a Moon Fan and according to me it lacked flavour but the quantity was more than enough for two people. Prices are decent.

Well, I have been here twice with high hopes because I heard chowman n Buddha bites r the new go-to Chinese restaurants in kol.but on both the occasions I was deeply disappointed with Buddha bites.(chowman is wayyy better)
Now, let me tell u y I was disappointed with Buddha bites.
1.THE FOOD!!
YES!!I guess they have two gravies in the kitchen one sweet n another hot n that's what they use fr all chicken, fish n pork( I didn't try lamb&prawn)the taste of the side dishes r not good.the pork items r hard to chew!!
2.THE PRICE!
owing to the kind of food they serve I have a problem with the price!its too expensive.
If u have to choose between this place n chowman please go to chowman the standard of food is much better n u don't have to spend more!! :)

I visited this place on a hot day of summer i.e. the 1st day of Bengali New Year. Small but well decorated. Calm and chilled atmosphere gave an inner peace on that hot sunny noon. Now lets discuss about the food quality and quantity. I ordered verjino magito with mixed fried rice and cantonese roast chicken. That chicken was awesome. But if you will expect gravy then you will be disappointed. But when you will taste it, it will simply made your day. In my opinion this dish should be served as starter. Quality wise good and quantity wish sufficient..worth of money. As i visited there on Paila Baishak so as a complement they serve rosogolla at the end. It gave me a big smile on my face. Thanq Buddha Bites for making dat day so special.

Best Eating Out Place On Earth 😇!!! 
Chinese cuisine is available everywhere in the world. But when one comes to Buddha Bites, one experiences an entirely different scenario. The place makes one feel like as if one is sitting in a cosy yet posh arena of China! Food? The taste is unmatched. Even the menu card is so ergonomic that it never gives one any form of discomfort- be it spicy or non-spicy the taste is heavenly. Service makes one feel totally at home. The interior design and the brand profile is skilfully implemented with innate beauty and holistic chants of the main land of China!!!

Home delivery @Buddha Bites this ICC T20 WC.
Very good service. I was OK with the 1hr delivery time post (restuarent order confirmation).

Packaging was on the higher side (Rs. 55) but that's acceptable to the extent the food doesn't leak (which was the case).

We ordered the :
1) Non Veg platter for starters. 2 of each kind and each was a tr8 to have #awesome.

For main course we ordered the:
2) Chicken Singapore Rice Noodles. (Standard Meifoon and thin laces made by this a good noodles dish, yet the spices were on the medium side)
3) Chicken Cantonese Pan fried Noodles.
 (The soup was fine but they should have packed the fried and the boiled noodles separately as - stuffing in one container deemed the noodles all rubbery. So this was a big negative)
4) Five spice chicken (not so good, flavor of the 5 spices didn't mingle at the right proportion - but my expectation was high)

Considering the experience after having the food and the billed amount my rating of 3.5* is more than justified, if not suggested otherwise.

Location is near the hatari restaurant gariahat. A cosy place and well decorated. Food was really good. Cost is not on higher side. Quantity is also good. We ordered seven jewel rice which was quite ok. Noodles was good. Hunan chicken was very good. We tried red pepper fish which was great. We ordered fried chicken which was out of the world. Fantastic in one word. Even we tried the honey noodles with ice cream and that was also good. But the service is not up to the mark. We had to wait almost 20min after placing the order. Which is not acceptable. Hardly 25 adults can be accommodate there. Overall good

Have not been to the restaurant,had ordered online via zomato. 

I had ordered,a veg hakka chow and a crispy chilly babycorn. 

I had ordered the food at 8.26,but the food arrived at 10.35. The food was cold. 

Kudos to Budha bites for delivering to new garia from their outlet in gariahat. But,they should atleast make sure customer is aware of the delivery time. Delivery time given to me was 9.26. I had called the restaurant and told to deliver by 9.45. 

The delivery boy was ver corteous,had greeted me and immediately apolagised for the delay,which i must appreciate. 

Coming to the food quality,the babycorn was average (maybe because it was cold),but the hakka noodles were pathetic. It was full of oil and uncooked vegetables. 

Please note - had ordered on 19.3.16 the day Ind vs Pak match,so the restaurant may have 2x  orders or even more as compared to a normal day. 

Still would give another try,as i have not been to this outlet and review might be biased. Review from the restaurant will be put up shortly !!!!

Ps - Review based on vegetarian food.

A restaurant which had moved me through its mind blowing reviews. I would not say that the food was bad. However, it tasted mediocre.
On entering, you would find yourself inside a dim lit area with a 'tried-to-be' romantic atmosphere. All the tables were occupied except one, which we were supposed to be seated. But they made us wait 10 mins, only to 'fix' it for us. If you look around, you can see Buddha statues with ancient music played in background, which will make you feel you have entered a Chinese Holy place.
Nonetheless, the names of food were so utterly complicated, that it took us a bit longer to decide which dish we should order that we don't regret later.
I found it pretty amusing that they took their name a bit too seriously. Pretty dedicated. I'd recommend them to turn off the TV that is quite distracting. It makes conversation difficult when the tables are too big. With the added background music playing, it becomes frustrating to talk when the other person keeps asking 'What?'
Anyway, I won't be returning here anytime soon.

Location is decent enough. Interiors are dimly lit which can act as a pleasant ambiance. The place is cramped though and can get really loud. The bells hanging overhead really add to the total decor and it looked very nice. The staff behaviour was pleasant, though I had to stand for 10 mins because a table was being "prepared". Since it was empty before our arrival it should have been prepared beforehand. The food is rather average. The quantities are great. Expensive. Given the food its quite pricey. Overall an average place with much need for improvement.

Nonetheless, the names of food were so utterly complicated, that it took us a bit longer to decide which dish we should order that we don't regret later.
I found it pretty amusing that they took their name a bit too seriously. Pretty dedicated. I'd recommend them to turn off the TV that is quite distracting. It makes conversation difficult when the tables are too big. With the added background music playing, it becomes frustrating to talk when the other person keeps asking 'What?'
Anyway, I won't be returning here anytime soon.

Location is decent enough. Interiors are dimly lit which can act as a pleasant ambiance. The place is cramped though and can get really loud. The bells hanging overhead really add to the total decor and it looked very nice. The staff behaviour was pleasant, though I had to stand for 10 mins because a table was being "prepared". Since it was empty before our arrival it should have been prepared beforehand. The food is rather average. The quantities are great. Expensive. Given the food its quite pricey. Overall an average place with much need for improvement.

This place is one of my favourite pocket friendly restaurants for quite some time until now. I went here today and found the price to be little on the higher side compare to what it was used-to be  . But that is acceptable as they serve awesome food. Among many dishes one is my all time favourite. Prawn wrapped with chicken. But today it wasn't that good like always. The chicken was too hard and the prawn wasn't tasted fresh. But dragon xhicken was really good so was the schezwan  rice.  Buddha Bites will be still my favourite. But they need to improve with respect to the increased price.

Though cost is on the higher side, but the food is worthy enough to spend much on it. Staff is friendly, ambience nice but not spacious. Since it is not a well known or legendary categorised restro, they could have cut down the cost a bit otherwise they really deserve a thumbs up!!

Location - Near triangular park. Ambience is noiseless. We ordered Roasted chilli lamb, chicken wrap prawn, seven jewel rice and Cantonese pork. The lamb and pork were finely chopped with thin slices which was flaking friendly. Now coming to the starter - chicken wrap prawn, it is one of those mouth watering preparations which you wouldn't like to share with anyone! It is actually a chicken piece with prawn dough. That's all about my experience at Buddha Bites. The only drawback they have is a short interior space.

Once you step inside this place it almost feels as if you are entering a Shrine. A "Gumfa" from the Feluda stories, complete with its strong incense scent, the constant humming of hymns that stir up the soul and according a friend of mine "turns him on". It has its own eye catching decor governed with a red tinge on its walls. It has huge bells stuck to the ceiling which sadly cannot be moved :'(  Overall, a visually stunning place to be.

Food!

The food is really good here. But considering the price, its not nearly good enough. 

We ordered Dragon Chicken and a Chicken in Plum Sauce as starters. I really liked the Dragon Chicken, that is one of the more tasty Dragon Chicken dishes I have ever had. It's moist and spicy. It's a really great starter. 

I wouldn't possibly recommend the second one because its not as spicy. Maybe if you have a sweet tooth you can go for it. Every restaurant has their own version of a dish, but I didn't like their iteration.

Then comes the main course. Rice Noodles with Kung Pao chicken and Chicken in Black Bean Sauce. The noodles were nice in texture but were bland nonetheless, lacking the amount of chicken and vegetable pieces we are accustomed to see. The Kung Pao chicken was really good, the gravy was amazing but they gave too little of the gravy! 

What really killed my mood was the difference between how they described on the menu the black bean sauce chicken would be, and how it actually tasted like. Frankly, it just tasted like we were having chicken pieces dipped in Soya sauce. Moreover the gravy wasn't worth mentioning. 

When they asked me to write few comments about the experience I didn't write much (or any if I remember correctly) because I thought I should write about each dish, since it was a  mixed experience. It had its highs and lows. 

Would I go again? Considering the price, and the amount they put on plate, maybe not for the main course dishes. For the Dragon Chicken? Absolutely yes!

Heard so much about this place, thought of visiting it this Sunday with my parents. First things first, it couldn't meet my expectations as the hype that has been created about its food and decor. Yep, I must say the ambience was really nice reminding me of some Buddhist ghumpha but on the contrary, the food was not upto the mark. We ordered prawn manchow soup, pan fried mixed Cantonese noodles and kung pao chicken. The manchow soup was really good but the noodles and chicken were an utter disappointment. The noodles was not well cooked and lacked ingredients like mushrooms and prawns,  the kung pao chicken felt like as if I was having honey chicken with some cashews. 
The only good part of this place is the staff, they are very cooperative and cordial. 
PS - the food here is overpriced and the quantity is seriously not ample enough to satisfy one single person.

Buddha Bites 

Chinese cuisine has been done to death in Kolkata, & honestly I am a bit bored with it. Especially now with the Restaurant map here being spread from Mexican to African, Chinese is not something I drool over. Hence even though Buddha Bites, has been recommended by many foodies I really did not think of visiting it. 

Last Thursday after a visit to Book Fair we were famished but wanted to have some light comfort food. Gariahat was on our way back home so though of trying Buddha Bites. And we were not disappointed at all.  

We opted for their New Year special offer, meal for 2 at 499 which included a veg soup, a veg / non-veg starter, veg rice / noodles, a veg / non-veg Side dish & dessert. You can choose the dishes from the menu for the offer except the dessert for which the only option was vanilla ice-cream

We ordered veg wanton soup, fried chicken wantons for starter, veg Hakka noodles, and chicken in black bean sauce. 

Apart from the combo offer we also ordered crispy fried squid. 

Each dish was really delicious & the quantity was good as well. The squid had a really unique taste while being tender. 

Another striking feature of this place is their décor & ambience. In spite of being a pretty small place it’s very well planned & aptly decorated with soothing oriental music playing the background which really sets the food for the simple soothing food that they serve.

The staff are well trained & guide you well. A must visit if you want a hearty meal at a great price! Highly recommended. I definitely plan to come back for more!

I have a confession. Sometimes I only and only crave for starters. Starters would be my dinner, and then Buddha Bites is the only place i think of. I have always home delivered from this joint never had the chance to visit it as of yet. The starters are affordable and tasty. 
However I did order main course from here a couple of times and it was horrid. Seriously guys learn how to make hakka chowmein, You are a chinese eatery. That is like the fundamental dish.

Surprise surprise! Another new Chinese place has opened doors in Kolkata. 

Well, actually this place has been there for a couple of years now and to be honest serves up more than decent Chinese fare. It isn't quite in the league of Chinoiserie or Mainland China but it has carved out its own place in the Kolkata Chinese cuisine jungle.

The dumplings or sui mai's are not really worth trying. Instead it makes more sense to try the pepper chilli squid or fish or prawns, roast chilli pork and the babycorn. In the mains the five spice chicken is pretty good. The Mangolian (I'm sure they mean Mongolian) Chicken isn't bad either. I also like the fish chilli plum and Hong Kong fish. The pork in chilli plum sauce is also pretty nice. And the five spice lamb. Most of the other dishes are average in my opinion. The duck is okay for the price. 

Service is pretty good. The staff is courteous and friendly as well. The seating though could have been more comfortable. As far as bang for the buck is concerned it is a pretty good place for the prices that one has to pay. Worth trying.

Visited there today. My friend gave me a lovely treat there on her birthday. We ordered Szechwan Fried Rice and egg wrapped Rice, but quantity was a bit huge so we had to pack one of those 😂.whatever we tried the Szechwan which was a bit hot, spices were little loud. We also tried the roasted chilli lamb, it was also delicious but a bit spicy. But if we knew that a huge amount of rice would be given to us we'd order some starter or one more side dish instead of rice. 😆😋
Chinese lovers like us must visit here 👍

Great addition to the Chinese cuisine scene in the city. Decor is pretty decent and so is the service. But the food ordered by us took too much time to come. We hungry souls attacked what looked like a tasty spread but were a tad disappointed with the flavors of the sides. The mains were great though.

Your besties bday and you are confuse where to set a surprise lunch....

Buddha bites is a place to full fill your requirements which is in your mind with a best quality food, well behave staff service and irregular environment of restaurant with soft Buddha mantras...

We ordered some different foods of Chinese
1. A starter ( forgot the name )
2. Chicken Moon Fan.
3. Slice chicken with basil oyster.
4. Fresh lime soda to digest.

And the best part is they suggest in desert ' Fried Ice cream'
First time we hard about it and we experienced a awesome quality foods and desert..

At the end the reasonable price bill and a discount coupon for next time made her happy to get a kiss 💋 from her...

Yesterday was a debacle of a lunch at Ivory. Today was lip-smacking, this-meal-should-not-end kind of lunch at this outlet. It took us a bit of walking around to figure it out (mostly my hapless map reading skills). But once we reached we were shown to nice table. The restaurant was well lit. This was nice because the decor is a bit dark and brooding. The splashes of red tend to be a bit overpowering in terms of the visual experience. Instead of ordering in a conservative manner, we decided to order signature starters - Barbeque Spare Ribs and Chicken Wrapped Prawns. Both of these were presented well and absolutely perfect. The ribs were meaty, with flavor and in a sauce that complemented the heat. The Chicken Wrapped Prawns is a neat twist - one begins with the somewhat flat texture and taste of chicken and ends up with the tang of prawn. The sauce/base is a good mix of sweet and sour. When contrasted with these two items, our choice of Chicken dumplings was really of a passing grade. Nothing wrong with it other than it was followed by two well composed dishes. I'd recommend these as part of the starters if one is planning to have a good meal.

The seating arrangement at this particular outlet is a little too compact for my sense of comfort and the glass topped tables are slightly wobbly. The staff are attentive, eager to ensure a good customer dining experience and comfortable in explaining detail of the menu. That's a great thing.

Yesterday was my third visit to this place. My earlier visits were take outs. We tried their specials Chicken wrapped prawn and Chilly pork. 
The food was overall good, except the pork was too spicy and also I found it  a bit chewy than my last visit. I tried their fried ice cream for the first time and it was a disappointment . It seems like they have fried it earlier and probably freezed it , so you do not really get the actual fried ice cream. For people who have had fried ice cream would know what I am talking about. Also they serve it on a very small ice-cream bowl, so when you dig in your spoon the  chocolate syrup topping all falls off along the sides and it gets messy. You need some room to eat your dessert.

Overall a good Chinese eat out place.

Was there a few days ago, surprisingly they were serving special Christmas and new year menu, no qualms with that. we ordered a manchow soup, pan fried fish, which was good, at least the dinner started out good, then in main course there was Cantonese chow, which seemed totally bland, now the utter disappointment was the chicken side dish  which was too salty, So bad that I chose not to remember the name of the dish to remind me of the horrific food.  we had asked for a replacement the moment we tasted it, however t our dismay we found that the replacement was nothing but the original chicken pieces re-cooked with a little bit of sugar, still to our dismay it was still quite salty.

What could have been a good dining experience was marred by the over-smartness of the staff... I don't know if I would recommend the joint, On top of that the staff was asking for some kind of spin-the-wheel for a discount for a followup dine in, absolutely refused it cos it was the food that mattered not the followup discount....

Visited this place on the occasion of a treat from one of my mother's colleague. It's SO easy on the pockets! They were having an offer of 1 starter and 1 side dish free for every order. We ordered Chicken wrapped in Prawn and Dragon Chicken for the Starters. The former is a delight to the taste-buds and is a must-have for every visitor.
For the main course, we gorged on Prawn Pok Choy and Hakka Chicken along with Mixed Fried Rice. The quantities were sufficient (actually more) for 5 people. The prawn preparation in white sauce can be a little dull for people having a preference for spicy food, and equally loved by people swearing by white sauce( I fall in the latter category.)
For desserts, we tried their Fried Ice Cream, and again, it didn't fail to impress me.
Service can be a little late, depending on the number of customers. But the food can make up for that.
This nice, little place is definitely for teenagers and young adults, looking for a pocket-friendly dining experience.

One thing that i have a complain with,and the probable reason for not rating it a notch higher is the quantity of starter. It tastes good and everything but the quantity was really bad,the pan fried fish was still ok but the dragon chicken was too little. It would be better if they would increase the price a bit so as to incorporate a bit more amount.
Coming to the main course the fried rice and the chowmein both were good, with adequate amount of chicken, prawn, egg etc.
Really liked the chicken and the lamb side,the lamb especially was perfectly cooked and made sauce was just amazing. Do give it a try and the price is very reasonable.
P.s. They also have a 'spin the wheel' kind of a thing where you can get upto 50% discount on the next bill.
P.p.s the food was so good i was busy eating and forgot to take any photo of the food.

Amazing ambience and delicious food! We had the chicken wings chilli plum,fried chicken wonton and chicken manchow soup for starters. The chicken wings was the best,the wonton was good but the soup needed a bit more flavour. For main course we had the chicken Singaporean rice noodles. I didn't like the noodles quite a lot because it smelled of turmeric. For dessert we had the fried ice cream and the honey tossed noodles with ice cream. Both desserts were lip smakingly delicious!!! I would definitely recommend this restaurant.... :)

Visited this place on the occasion of a treat from one of my mother's colleague. It's SO easy on the pockets! They were having an offer of 1 starter and 1 side dish free for every order. We ordered Chicken wrapped in Prawn and Dragon Chicken for the Starters. The former is a delight to the taste-buds and is a must-have for every visitor.
For the main course, we gorged on Prawn Pok Choy and Hakka Chicken along with Mixed Fried Rice. The quantities were sufficient (actually more) for 5 people. The prawn preparation in white sauce can be a little dull for people having a preference for spicy food, and equally loved by people swearing by white sauce( I fall in the latter category.)
For desserts, we tried their Fried Ice Cream, and again, it didn't fail to impress me.
Service can be a little late, depending on the number of customers. But the food can make up for that.
This nice, little place is definitely for teenagers and young adults, looking for a pocket-friendly dining experience.

One thing that i have a complain with,and the probable reason for not rating it a notch higher is the quantity of starter. It tastes good and everything but the quantity was really bad,the pan fried fish was still ok but the dragon chicken was too little. It would be better if they would increase the price a bit so as to incorporate a bit more amount.
Coming to the main course the fried rice and the chowmein both were good, with adequate amount of chicken, prawn, egg etc.

A decent place to have Chinese cuisine near triangular park in Gariahat. Although its small in size but the restaurant offers delicious Chinese food which is rich in taste. The items are cooked with a lot of heart and the pieces of chicken melt in your mouth. One has to acknowledge the service it provides. It is not possible to taste all the items at one visit so will have to go there again to have a better perspective. However the morning shows the day and I can recommend this place to my friends if they want to taste good Chinese food.

It's situated near Triangular Park, just behind Hatari. The decor is gr8, the ambience is calm. Prawn wrapped in chicken in Schezwan sauce and non-veg platter are the 2 u must have in starters. Plum chilli fish was yummy and so was the roasted lamb. We had them along with Mixed Schezwan Rice. Sum up with fried ice cream. Price is reasonable.

I forgot my card and the service guy came out of the restaurant to give it back 2 me. 0.5 more marks for that.

It was an awesome experience having the best ever Chinese at Kolkata,  and it had to be at Buddha Bites. The signature dish to start with - Chicken wrapped Prawn!! Utterly delicious and it was a burst of flavours. Flavoured rice and plum chilli pork was decent enough to keep the experience at another level. I'am surely returning back here,  time and again to have their delicacies, and the master stroke was a sudden customer offer on the meal which gave us a discount of more than 20%,  that added much to the delight of my wife..  @ Debjani Mukherjee

Easy to locate, clean interiors, and delicious food, Buddha Bites was a good experience overall.  Though my opinions about anything Asian is always biased , their Chicken wrapped prawn, Peking duck were lip smacking good. Fried ice-cream in their desserts is a must have too. However, a few other desserts were not unavailable and they were quite reluctant to accept debit cards so we had to go out and find an atm machine! Overall, good food and ordinary service .

A very soothing experience at Buddha Bites... :)
Nice ambience to begin with.. Well maintained decor.. Polite staffs..
Food we ordered- Mongolian chicken, shwezwan rice and kung pao chicken..
Mongolian was dry comes in 8 pieces best served with red sauce that they provide..
Rice was a bit too masala for me.. I wanted something light.. But no worries it was very well made.
Last the kung pao chicken which I think was the best.. 10 pieces perfect blend of spices gives it a soupy flavour.. 
All together good experience .. Would love to visit again. :)@

We were 7 and ordered my dishes like Hakka noodles, Singapore Rice noodles, Seven jewel rice, and on side dishes we ordered one lamb and prawn and we got a chicken dish free. The ambiance was really good food quality is also good but the side dishes are little less in quantity. But otherwise I have to say this is one of the good Chinese restaurant.

Visited this place with 3 friends for my birthday treat.
On entering, you'll be greeted by a huge budhha statue setting a smile on your face instantly.. the place has a very homely ambience with soothing buddhist musics in the background where you can relax and enjoy your food as long as you wish.
Now the food!! we ordered the following-
starters- lung fung soup,
Seafood soup
Chicken wrapped prawn,
Pepper chili squid
Main course - seven jewel rice, singapor rice noodles, prawn in plum sauce,
Dessert- fried icecream
Both the soups were mildblowing. The chicken wrapped prawn was the star dish(highly recommended! )
The main course items were all good except the seven jewel rice.. ordered it just on the basis of zomato suggestion.. it's nothing but plain fried rice with 7typesof veggies and not-so-good taste. I would advice everyone to AVOID THIS DISH!
And I was too much excited for the fried icecream and.. well, it didn't disappoint me at all! Tasted for the first time and it was awesome!
Well, the quantities in all dishes are just enough for two( or three max) satisfactorily.. waiters are very polite and helpful and they give the perfect food suggestions..
Do visit this place for enjoying some mouthwatering Chinese dishes( specially the prawn dishes). And prices are amazingly affordable..so, don't worry, budhha won't pinch/bite your pocket too hard!!! :)

went to this gariahat outlet of buddha bites this november on a friend's reference, and i must admit i was impressed by this place. this is located in the alley beside city style opposite to triangular park. i'm a die heart fan of chinese cuisine and from the moment i entered the place i knew i took the right decision. the ambience of this place is great, the relaxing song in the buddist taste adds flavour to the environment. 

the service is amazing, you dont have to call the waiter for orders or for serving the food in the plates or to fill up glasses. they keep an eye on your requirements and act accordingly. 

and now the food, it is delicious. we took roasted chilli pork according to zomato's refernce as "what should you order" and it was amazing. we took a lamb dish equally good (the exact name i cannot recollect now) and kung pao chicken. in maincourse we took mixed hakka noodles. 

and another thing, the OFFERS!! there is non veg combo at rs225 and veg combo offers at rs175. and moreover the waiter imformed us that on taking ANY 2 DISHES ON EITHER PORK/LAMB/PRAWN/DUCK, THERE IS 1 DISH OF ANY CHICKEN OR FISH FREE!!! we grabbed this offer and the kung pao chicken came free along with the pork and lamb! :)

i must mention that the price is not at all high in comparison to the food quality and standard. the place is a bit small to accomodate a large number of people and the sitting arrangement is not quite comfortable, which can be improved. 

my overall experience was quite satisfying and i have been referring friends t dine in here atleast for once!!

Zomato had just started online ordering and I was lucky to be given an offer on my order. So I had been put into a dilemma of choosing the restaurant. I had to order for my parents and hence it was supposed to be a tried and tested place that I should have gone for. But ever since I have heard of Buddha Bites, I had this nagging feeling of trying their food. This seemed to be a great opportunity and without much of ado, I ordered Roasted Chilli Pork, Dragon Chicken and Claypot Rice. The dragon chicken was savory and spicy as well. It was enjoyed by all. The claypot rice was pretty standard and hence doesn't quite stand out. But the chilli pork was a bit of a disappointment. The meat was not tender and neither did it have the correct balance between the fat and the muscle - it was too lean and a bit tough. But I do not hold the chef guilty as few restaurants in kolkata can serve a well balanced roasted pork. Buddha Bites should strive to be better. All the best

This outlet of Buddha Bites is located exactly opposite to Triangular Park, in the lane beside City Style. It is a beautifully decorated themed restaurant reminiscing  the Buddhist culture as is implied by the name. It has got a seating capacity of around 20 people..seats are not that comfortable being in the form of wooden chairs. Coming to the food,the starters like Dragon Chicken and Chicken wrapped prawn are wonderful to have and being nothing short of  overtly delicious. However,I was left disappointed by the main course.The friedrice and the general tao chicken were bland and not that tasty. Overall it offers decent food but nothing as exciting as the reviews on Zomato and considering the size,decor and standard of the place it is a bit over priced also.

Fried Ice cream was good. The crust was nice but the ice cream was very hard and solid. 2.5/5

Service was quick,ambience was very Asian and the place is very easy to locate. To start with we ordered a Golden fried prawn followed by the main coarse consisting of  chicken moon fan rice,red cook chicken and fish chilli plum. The food was really good and quantity is also satisfactory. And the food is also priced reasonably given the quality. For dessert we had the famous fried ice cream which was awesome!!

And too mention the shrimps used in the mixed rice n noodles were nicely dressed as well a were fresh which deserves a special mention...

Go straight inside the lane beside City Style,it shall fall on your left. A small place with lovely ambience. The menu is authentic and diverse. Loved the starters, had golden fried prawn and Mongolian chicken with a Chinese sauce by the side. It was fiery hot and delicious. The non veg side dish we ordered was shredded lamb in Szechuan sauce. The quantity was very small. The rice was also scented and understated with rich chinese undertones. For dessert I had fried icecreams which is a speciality with this place. It was innovative.
Nothing out of the world about the place,not even much value for money. The experience was simple and okay-ish.

The Tibetan music in the background fulfilled the much needed peace on that evening Coming to the important part : Food was served hot and delicious.

Don't if that was for the ISL league Kolkata match that aired on same evening! 3*

Visited Buddha Bites on Panditiya Road, Gariahat  yesterday night. The experience was sweet and bitter at the same time. The sweet experience was that the food was better than the average. The bitter was the ambience, loud and cluttersome, on top of it the ac at the backside was either switched off or not working. We were at the backside and the steaming food and the hot atmosphere made us sweat like hell. We requested the waiter to minimise the temperature of the ac (thinking that it is working), but he said that it is  running on 18°, as if we do not know what is 18° temp! This is not a small issue. Good food and comfort always go hand in hand.

Nice decor, incredible chinese one of the most premium joints to offer variety of chinese dishes. Had ordered squid for starteres -pretty simple but delicious. Tao pao noodles was good, the schezwan rice tasted pretty awsome. The mongolian prawn is a must try loved it even though i'm not very much a prawn fan.They give you a handful of chloromints with the bill. Overall great place to go with friends and family. Gonna be back soon.

So I took my friend and basically pigged out - they do make a mean roasted pork chilli, and that what what brought me and S here, and we had our share of it. Would have liked a bit of fat on the pork though - I don't much care for absolutely lean pork. The egg wrapped fried rice came with a bit of panache, and I love a bit of drama. We were served a generous portion of the rice, but the chicken accompanying it did not complement the rice in any way - we were happier eating them solo, and the chicken was quite sweet. My diet coke was chilled, and service was fast and friendly.

You will miss a lot in life if you go to Buddha Bites and miss their Hunan fish.
Do try their lamb dishes.
The Seafood soup is very good as a appetizer and will leave you wanting more.
The pricing is reasonable and the items are served in large amounts.
So miss this place at your own risk!

Recently I went to Buddha bites with two of my friends for lunch. The ambience is amazing giving you a feel of Tibet and Buddhist cultures. The place is small so if you are thinking of taking your big family of ten members...make a reservation from before hand. Now coming to food. For starters I had Mongolian crispy chicken which was average as I felt. For maincourse we had Schezwan Chicken fried rice. Along with it we had Pork with sliced beans which was amazing. We had two preparations of lamb and chicken. Lamb in black bean sauce and Chicken slice in oyester sauce. Both were really good. Overall the food and ambience will surely make it up to you.

I visited this place tonight, it was a good experience altogether. Food was good. I had ordered for hot n sour chicken soup, which was quite good, roasted chili lamb, that was great, n mixed fried rice, which was not upto the mark. Dessert was scintillating. Decor was nice but I personally feel that this place was on shorter side, a bit clumsy

This being a sudden visit , i had no idea of their specialities and even the pricing, but the buy 1 get 1 offer on maincourses for this whole september was surely eye catching...
We had a SHEZWAN MIXED RICE , one CHILLI ROAST LAMB and got STEAMED FISH IN OYESTER SAUCE completely free of cost.
The rice was nice , so was the fish , the lamb was not that good , can be avoided i would suggest. The portions were generous. One plate of rice can easily fill 3 adults.
Overall pretty satisfactory experience for the price of 547 inclusive all.

If you want to taste food in a Sikkimese restaurant, just go and rush to Buddha Bites. Cool and comfortable ambiance. Waiters are very much service-friendly. Chicken sataye is a very good option as a starter. First time, I ate this item. You can go through main items such as Slice lamb in black bean sauce with mixed noodles.

Went there yesterday with him. Expected a lot from this resto. But expectations were not upto the mark. Though well decorated the place is too small. Located near triangular park. We ordered chicken hot and sour soup and it was tasty. Then we ordered their signature dish chicken wrapped prawn and it stole my heart. It was delicious. Fried rice was okayish nothing great. Virgin mojito was disgusting. I have given 3.5 just for their soup and the starter. Service is too slow.thank you.

At last I got a chance to visit this lovely restaurant. Being a die hard fan of Chinese cuisine it was in my list since ever I heard about it. It was one of my friend's birthday treat for which this place was selected and we became quite satisfied with our selection
We ordered for dragons chicken as starter. Guys this item just won my tongue n heart. It was super tasty! Then we had moon fan rice and schezwan rice with five spices chicken. The main course were equally good though i found the moon fan rice a bit dull in taste. I also found the chicken dishes quite highly priced. Quantity was really sufficient. Staffs were well behaved. At last we had the most cherished fried ice cream. I personally wished for this dish from the very beginning. The dish was a unique one but not that super delicious! Overall this place made me enough happy to visit again.

I ordered food online. As I have done a few times before with Buddha bites. What I got was half filled containers. It all tasted insipid. I promptly called them up and told them they offered to send a fresh batch of food ASAP. What I got was the same food with little more salt and pepper. Manchow Soup had a stench of chilli vinegar. The Clay Pot Rice Sauce tasted heavily of Five Spice. It was not edible. The Dragon chicken had a few pieces that was the only thing that was edible. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. Also decide on portion size and stick it.
Called them the next day and gave them feedback regarding this. The person that picked up and heard my complaint was the same one who had sent the replacement the previous evening. All he did was say "ok Thank you" and promptly hung up. Might I add I was very calmly explaining to him. I was giving constructive feedback as something had gone very wrong with my order/s. Instead of following up. I have not heard anything from Buddha Bites. In me they have lost a customer! So my suggestion is not to get anything delivered from them! You will be better off trying another Chinese home delivery chain.

Recently two Chinese chains are making waves.The forerunner is of course Chowman but Buddha bites is not far behind.

As I wrote in the review for Kimli,Kolkata has probably more shades of Chinese than 50 shades of grey.Kolkatans love Chinese.

We went to this outlet on Panditia Road on an undecided form of mind,divided between Tandoori Chicken and Chilli Chicken.The latter won.

Ambience :  3.5 / 5.   Nice Chinese Lanterns,cane tables,decent lighting

Service : 4/5.   Smiling,energetic,friendly

Food :  Clear soup and hot n sour soup : 3.5/5

Mustard prawns : 4/5

Roast chilly Pork : 4/5

Cantonese chicken chowmein : 3.5/5

Chilli chicken : 3/5

Red shredded chicken : 2/5

Decent food,the mains were not as good as the starters.But then again was the taste good enough for me to plan another visit soon?

No!

Buddha Bites provides a really cool and comfy ambience. Located in a renovated olden day house the experience provided is at par with some of the best restaurants in the city. Located near triangular park this outlet has supremely excellent service with the staff going out of the way to provide a wholesome experience. We ordered the Cantonese mixed Chowmin and the roasted lamb along with the chicken in oyster sauce. The food was superb and the virgin mojito we ordered was extremely refreshing on a hot September afternoon. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to people looking for a relaxing meal.

We dined here after we were tired shopping, It is not very difficult to locate and very close by to triangular park

Its a small cozy place with beautiful decor, perfect chinese restuarant for casual dining. The food is not too pricey, yet the taste and quality and quantity is not compromised.

We ordered Wanton soup, Fish in mustard sauce, singapore rice noodles and Panner manchurian. The Singapore rice noodles was okayish, the rest of the food tasted very good.

Will surely visit again!

Took Mom and Dad for lunch yesterday nd they liked the place. It is a very small place but i loved the interiors. The big bells and the lamps have brightened the surrounding.  We had ordered for Pan Fried Fish in the starter which was delicious.  For main course we ordered seven jewels rice, hakka noddles and hunan chicken - all of them were nice . We ended the meal with fried ice cream which is a rare desert i have eaten and would love to eat again. My parents really enjoyed the food and wants to visit again..

Keep up the good work!

I had bookmarked this place long back but could never take the time out to go and try the place. So one fine day while I was in Gariahaat I walked up to this place. Tucked away in a lane near triangular park. I have haeard the place serves good chinese so was very keen to try. So I walked in and there was this huge Budhdha statue, just the face which was beautiful to be honest and the place was done up in a very Tibetan way with their prayer bells. I love the hills and this place gave me a feel of Mclodganj/Gangtok which was serene although the restaurant was pretty small but it was tastefully done. 

Food wise I parceled dragon chicken as a starter and chicken fried rice. I thought the food was pretty average. Quantity was good but the starter was a mood buster. The chicken was chewy and hard and not at all dragonnishly HOT, so was just not upto mark. Even the fired rice was chewy as I felt it was not well prepared. So average was the food that I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone unless someone is in their locality and wanting to try chinese. 

Service was prompt and price was it was OK. The seem to have many outlets which showcases their popularity so I am hoping they will take notice and improve the quality. P.S. Management should stress on cleaner toilets!!

I enjoyed the food and had a good experience. The food was decently good and 5 spice been lamb was good. Wantons are also decent. Ambience was good and the there is ample parking place which is quite a concern.
However when I opened the zomato site I saw that there was a over of 15%discount on the bill. Which was neither informed to me nor was it extended to me. Not that it will make much of a dent for me but it affects how one perceives the place. 
UPDATE
This has never happened before.... The manager came to my house and returned the money which should have been given as a discount.  I truely appreciate the gesture.

I would call this discovering a hiddem gem! tucked somewhere in the by-lanes of triangular park this place welcomes u with a cozy atmosphere! we called for lungfung soup which was just so perfect! a prawn wrapped chicken...it was different and i totally loved it. The next starter was a mustard fish and trust me i being not a big fish lover... fell in love with it! for main course it was mixed special meifoon ... the flavour was nice! dry chilly pork which my friends loved and chicken meatballs which was nice again! we ended our meal with a fried ice cream which is a rare dessert in the city! the only sad part is the serve. they had one guy serving the entire restaurant which made the service really slow.

Normally I would not write such a scathing review even if the food is sub-standard, but the management and service at this restaurant is simply appalling and pathetic. I used the zomato online app to order two dishes- chicken wings in chilli plum sauce and roast chilli pork. While the order was placed at 9:00 pm, I was forced to call the restaurant as the food had not been delivered till 11:00 pm only to be told the food was out for delivery. While it took another 15-20 minutes after that and directions being explained to the delivery boy 3 times over, the entire experience was a disaster. The food quality can be best described as nothing short of a joke. The chicken wings should not be called wings- am attaching a picture for reference and the roast chilli pork which is normally a dry dish, was floating about in gravy. A place I would never recommend to anyone and rather warn from staying away, especially from ordering home delivery.

Also while Zomato will ensure this review does not show up amongst the popular reviews, it's worthwhile that people take note and be warned before ordering.

Easily the best chinese in kolkata! Food is cooked by real chinese chefs. Nice cozy ambience which is a throwback to everything buddhist and chinese. Even though the place is small it is almost always full which is a good sign. Service and management can't be better even though service time can be improved a bit. Price is a little high but considering the taste and flavours totally "paisa wasool"! You can try any of the starters to know that this place means business! My friend and I couldn't deal with the quantity served and we left with our stomachs full barely able to walk.. A dinner for two can cost as high as 2000 bucks but can't complain!

What to say about Buddha Bites? Apt name as Buddha has turned back and bitten us.. Appended are the review of dishes we had: 

Starter: 
Crispy Chilly Babycorn - It was too much sweet and was mostly made of tomato sauce. We dint like it.
Chicken Wrap Prawn Shezwan - This was their Signature dish. The only Good thing which we had there. I had given 1.5 rating just for this dish.

Maincourse:
General Tao Chicken: It was again too sweet. Not at all upto the mark. We dint like it.
Five Spice Lamb: Was it a Lamb or Mutton? Anyways if atall it was a Lamb it dint taste good . The quantity of salt was bit too much. We again dint like it.
Singapore Rice Noodles: It tasted like a Semiya or what you call as Sevai. Thumbs down again.
Mixed Cantonese Pan fried Noddles (white sause): It was actually a gravy chowmien wherein the gravy served was too less compared to the quantity of the chowmien... We ordered for a mixed but it was more of a veg noodles. Gulped it somehow.
Moon Fan Rice (Chicken): This was the worst of all the item. It had a star anise flavour. We had a couple of spoon and was pathetic.  

Bill amount : Rs.1960/- Its upto you to decide whether its pocket friendly or pocket pinch.
Saddest part was that it was my birthday and I had to eat something which I dint like. I would start hating chinese food if this was the case in all chinese hotels. We personally dint like it. Ambience and Service was pretty good. But we will never hit this place again!

Ordered food from Buddha bites on 27th July .... the food was below standard and gave them a rating of 1. The owner Mrs Saoli read about my review and immediately contacted me wanting to know what was wrong with the food.She was extremely apologetic and requested us to visit the restaurant ... but I denied. She even wanted to know what was wrong with the food ie cooking , items or what. I was really astonished that a hotelier of her stature calling me to know my issues.... thats the good sign .... and more surprises awaited me ... the very next day for dinner she had send the same items again and believe me the food was mouth watering, delicious , and very well cooked ... really felt sorry for her since the cook must had a bad day at office and food was not good previously... Hats off to the owner who personally monitors every customer review. I wish them all the best & hope with this dedication they will soon be the top Chinese restaurant in the city of joy.

Took home delivery option from rashbehari branch. Pathetic rice chow... Half cooked. Quantity was ok for 3people. The half cooked noodles were in lumps...i think street corner shops would serve us better food. Had a huge face loss infront of guest. We tried the shop only because of good review but alas after delivery I am sure they are paid review for sure. Now coming to dude dish lamb was hard infavt wr thought it was pork. Chicken was sweet. Only thing that we liked was mustard fish... After all cooks don't come from china but are Bengali's so gushcooking wad good. Surely will never try even if offered free.

I have been reading some decent reviews about Buddha Bites for some time, and a friend recommended it last week.

I was looking for home delivery options yesterday and zeroed in on this. To be honest, it was a pleasant surprise that they have 100% acceptance as many restaurants do not deliver around Behala.

The food ordered was
(1) Pan fried fish - The fish pieces were succulent. What I liked the best about this dish was they got the spiciness right. It was neither bland, nor too spicy.
(2) Roast Chilli Lamb In Soy Sauce - The lamb pieces (shredded) were perfectly roasted and then cooked in soy sauce with green bell peppers. Tasted great and once again, the balance of flavours was right regarding soy sauce.

The food was delivered within an hour. The portions are good. One starter and/or one main course is more than enough for two people.

I enjoyed the food and will surely visit the place soon.

The Buddha never got a bite!

After roaming around everywhere and searching for places to eat, my family and I landed up at Buddha Bites. They've given the place the look of a monastery, with prayer wheels and bells all around. Chinese in a monastery? Worth a shot!
The food is actually sumptuous and every bite is full of flavour. Be it the tofu or the pan fried noodles. Special mention to the four treasure vegetables in chilli garlic sauce. 
The variety is great for a vegetarian and it doesn't even pinch your pocket. Four people can fill their tummies and burp it out loud. I ate so much that I didn't leave a bite for Buddha himself!

Very nice place nearby priya cinema. We 3 friends walked upto this joint after catching a movie together. Small place but decorated nicely . A huge statue of Lord Buddha's face Is kept at the entrance. A beautiful chanting tune was playing inside. All over the ambience was awsome. We ordered a chicken dish which was yummy and cooked perfectly. In main course we ordered a prawn gravy with chicken noodles. Prawn dish was really good and quantity was also good. It was sufficient for 3 of us though we weren't that hungry . Definitely would love to visit this place again. Wanna try their meifoon.

This place was there on my wishlist for long.. finally visited it last Saturday.. We started with chilli mustard fish which was marvellous..Our expectation levels had gone very high by that then..Thought of experimenting a bit..ordered claypot rice(owing to the interesting name) and mongolian chicken..claypot rice as informed by the staff wad expected to be medium spicy..but to our utter disappointment,it wad bland..probably didnt suit our taste buds.. mongolian chicken was good enough. Definitely planning to visit again and this time lil less of experimenting..😉

Odered online through Zomato. Placing the order was quick and hassle free. Got the food in 45 mins. Ordered schezwan fried rice and lamb, Cantonese noodles and chicken. Packaging was good. Food was ok. Could have been much better at this price range. Quality was not upto the mark.

Probably last December we visited Buddha Bites for some authentic Chinese cuisine & of course ambience. At a first site,it's charming ambience with background music gives us s feeling like we are far away from crowded locality. Start with some  starter that have unique aroma & taste wise undoubtedly significant that draw us a couple of times.Really awesome cuisine with ultimate delicacy.

Being an avid fan of Chinese cuisine, I was planning for visiting this place after reading such good reviews. So, one day that chance came when my wife bought a groupon coupon of a non veg chinese meal for 2 persons at this place. On a Friday afternoon, we visited this place which is located in a lane beside citistyle shop in triangular park. The entry door of the restro is a great piece of unique art, and then inside too it has a soothing ambiance with nice decor. We were given 2 welcome cold drinks which were 1/4th of a glass each! Coming to the food, we had taken chicken lung fung soup /(which tasted pretty good). It was followed by pan fried fish, veg fried rice and five spice chicken. All of these 3 were below average- the fried rice was made of thick rice which are usually not seen in even small restros, the fish was salty, and the five spice chicken was strange and not at all good. Secondly, the portions were limited while they were to serve full portions only! then they added 2 scoops of desert which actually seemed like 2 small cheese cubes  (now I mean they should really go back and see the meaning of Scoop). The portions would not have mattered to much if taste was good, but very sorry this is definitely not a standard taste.  The service was good.

Went there one sunday for a family brunch after movie at priya. The inside is small but spacious with nice decor. 
For starter we ordered chicken wrapped prawn which is a must try. Then for main course we noted down mixed  fried rice and kung pao chicken. Delicious it was. Now for dessert  we had fried icecream which is well made but i didn't like it much.
Overall the quality and quantity is great on my next visit i am going to try their signature duck dishes :)

This a tiny . .very tiny place tucked in the Triangular Park area. You can literally hear what others are talking about but I must say they have done a good job with what ever they have got. .mellow lights, nice music,cozy place.
We were a bit apprehensive when before eating we just wiped the plates with a napkin and there was dust on it. This was new to me,that plates on the table would have a sheen of dust.We told them and the people did not seem bothered.
But when it comes to the food, I must say its good. We had ordered a dragon chicken , a egg wrapped fried rice and a Hunan fish.
The dragon chicken was fiesty but the amount served was very less.I am not saying this because I would have loved to try more,which I would have, but it was truly little.
The fried rice was good and the fish was absolutely lip smacking and is a must-try.
The service could be a bit faster given the not too many people in the restaurant and a bit more attentive.
On the whole a nice place.

Having tried out a lot of authentic Chinese food in quite a number of restaurants in Kolkata I wont rate this place as the best but BUDDHA BITES definitely has a lot of plus points.
1. Ambience - Calm n relaxing with a sooth music playing in the background.
2. Glasses used to drink water gives a warm fine dining feeling.
3. Food - not at all feel heavy with ample quantity for 2 per plate. One can try out their chilli mustard chicken n egg wrapped fried rice. The chilli mustard chicken tastes really good (I ordered two plates to fill my craving) so does the rice, but the chicken satay (the one with sticks) was like okay.
Having said all these, there is a certain point which the owner must ensure for a better service during time of heavy footfall - Each and every person serving the customers must be well trained on how the various dishes as per the menu are prepared. Banking on one or two will cause a delay in service.

It was the reviews on Zomato that took us to this place and well it was worth a visit 😊😊

The ambience and the music together create that typical Buddhist feel.

The food is done well especially the signature dishes. Chicken wrapped prawn was absolutely yum!!

Tried dishes recommended on Zomato. 
1. Lung fung soup is very good, go for it.

2. Chicken satay was a disaster, it was simply put not a "satay". Shared instant feedback with the staff waiting on us.

3. Hakka noodles and clay pot rice were really tasty especially the noodles.

The card swiping machine wasn't working, that was quite a nuisance in a prime shopping neighbourhood like Gariahat 😞
That was a total flop show.

For starters, had chicken satay alongwith peanut butter sauce which seemed quite good, for mains we had the shredded Mongolian chicken and moon fan rice... The quantity isn't much  should be sufficient for two who don't eat much.

Very easy to locate,right behind city style,gariahut.Seating is limited but the theme does impress.Beautiful decor with lamps and paintings on the red wall,a small Buddha temple and dim lighting makes the feel of the theme much more prominent. We had dragon chicken for starters(sweet n spicy) .For the main course,we had the red cook chicken(tasted really nice but not at all very spicy,as is mentioned in the menu) and egg wraped rice. The food was very tasty,while service was good enough.The quantity was satisfactory, for two persons.

We have visited this place last week . It is just beside the Citi Style gariahat. Small place with 4-5 tables. But Ambiance is very good. We have ordered Mixed Malaysian wide noodles (This was a Signature Dish.They have given a name ,but I forgot ) with Kung Pao Chicken. It is simply Awesomeeeeeee.. But we are little disappointed as the quantity was less in respect to the price.
Sure we will revisit this place .

Decided to try Buddha Bites after receiving rave reviews and great feedback. The first thing that I noticed that its quite a small place which can be a problem during peak hours. The interiors are decked in Buddhist elements with the music adding to the ambiance. Coke was served as a welcome drink. We ordered Cantonese pan fried noodles, Shezwan fried rice, Cantonese pork and Roast Chili Lamb. The staff were cordial and service was swift. This is one of the few places that offered authentic Chinese cuisine and not Indianized Chinese that are served in other places. All the items were good specially the pan fried noodles and roast chilli lamb. I felt that the pork could have been cooked a bit more. The only disappointment was the quantity. Please consider your serving portions. Overall a nice experience and I will be coming back for more! :)
P.S. : Please do away with the TV

An uniquely designed & well-affordable to people looking for Chinese dishes with average pocket pinch.Once you enter,an entirely different atmosphere engrosses you-one that you can relate with Buddhist monasteries. 
Coming to the gourmet part,don't miss out on the Roasted Lamb.An excellent dish without deserting too much from your pockets.Rest dishes we tasted were okay.
The biggest con is the insufficiency of space.
Overall from me, a 3.5/5 (y)

Went for lunch today with a friend. The location is very easy just near City Style, Gariahat. The interior was beautifully done. Surprisingly and also fortunately it was almost empty when we entered the restaurant. This helped us in getting very swift and friendly service and also table of our own choice. We ordered Chicken Wrap Praw Slezwan for starters as suggested by our waiter, and I have to admit it was delicious. For main course, we had Seven Jewel Rice and Five Spice Chicken. The main course was also good but, to be honest I liked the starter better. Anyway, it amounted to Rs.949 for 2 people, which I think is a little bit much. Other than the price issue I think this restaurant is worth a visit at least sometime.

A nice small place with good Chinese food. Service was kinda slow but the food made up for it. Like the name suggests, lot of Buddhist artefacts around. Really liked the large bells hanging from the ceiling. Not too heavy on the pocket as well. Recommended dishes: General Tao Chicken, Singapore Chilli Prawns with mixed hakka noodles. I tried lamb as well...not so great. Mocktails are nice but I felt they were a bit overpriced. Overall a good experience, the place is worth visiting!!

Last day I visited this small restaurant. It was easy to locate (thanx to zomato).

The first thing which struck me when I entered the place was decor. It strictly decorated according to the cuisine they offer. Quite nice.

Coming to the food. We ordered Pepper chill squid for starters. It was satisfactory for my taste buds. Felt could have been more crispy. For main course we ordered roast pork chilli and egg wrapped fried rice. Rice tasted usual but it's the pork for which I liked the place. The dish was simple with basic Chinese flavors of soya sauce and the tender pork meat. Yum. Do try the pork of that place instead of regular white meat.

Overall it was Satisfactory.

From Rishab's taste desk :-

Robibar er dupurer sei kath faata roddur a Buddha bites er sondhan paoata anekta morubhumi r modhye oasis kinba sunsan paharer ek konay ekta chotto monastry k khuje paoar motoe chilo ; infact amar ei monastry er comparison aro justified hoy bhetorer ambience ta protokkho kore. - the buddha statue at the door front, the dim light arrangement, the soft music at the background, etc. all clearly depicts that they have taken the theme of the restaurant rather seriously and not to forget, have done justice to it.

Coming back to the food....BHAI LOG!!  CHICKEN SATAY - a must try for the starters. Mukhe dilei you will sense a feeling of peanut and a bit of buttery flavour in this dish.

Next we tried out the Seven jewels rice along with Lamb with oriental veggies.. The Lamb veggies was good (although it tasted more like mutton to me- yet I liked it!!) and the seven jewels rice was pretty  ok. But honestly speaking , I felt the combination didnt fit perfectly. 

The quantity is decent, the prices are reasonable and you can enjoy a cozy fooding there.
 
Overall , I give it 3 out of 5. But khawar seshe mourir bodole chlormint ta deoar jonne  and last but not the least MENU CARD TA SIMPLIFIED RAKHAR JONNO 1 point  na baria parlam na!!

If you love real Chinese cuisine, then you must visit Buddha Bites. The cuisine is absolutely authentic in nature and has no flaws. Culinary skills of the chef are beyond expectations as I did't expect them to be so good. Chicken wrapped prawn is the best starter I have ever had & believe you me, it's finger-licking. Chilly mustard fish & Cantonese roast chicken were the other dishes I tried, and both were YummY !!!
Commendable customer service which you hardly receive at most Kolkata joints nowadays.

Still can't forget the taste...no worries - Visiting Soon.

My First and probably last experience at this Restaurant. Barring the ambience in this 28seater restaurant nothing worth praising of.
Staff seemed completely lost wrt servicing. They completely lacked professional training, moreover staff strength was limited. Could see them panicking!! 
Tried the basic Chicken Sweet Corn Soup alongwith Crispy chilli baby corn. Soup was raw with no corn presence, baby corn was smelly and lacked the desired taste.
However Chilli Mustard Chicken was fresh and tasted Average.
Basic main course of Hakka Chowmein and Chkn Fried Rice was ordered. I think a street chowmein and rice would be a better choice to have than this.. 
Overall Experience can be summarised as Below Average!!
For a restaurant having 3 outlets in Kolkata. It simply needs Much Much improvement in all parameters.
Wishing them all the Best!!!

At first I Should tell You the food of this good but everything else is bad..I wrote this experience after 7-8 months..but that was my worst experience in restaurant in Kolkata. We four Friends go to to restaurant at 7.30 pm.We gave our 1st order Dragon chicken, it came after 45 minutes. We mostly lost our appetite.But after that we Oder main course  hakka Chowmin , chiken ried rice and Chili chiken two plates each. After one hour later we get one plate of each. The serving boy said that others pales are coming..but after waiting another half hour we did get any thing..So we cancelled the oder. And paid the bill with my card...but the incompetent serving made a mistake and draw a amount from my card..when i watched my bill receipt  that he said sorry and return the money from the cash counter. When i complain about that indecent in the management they told me write it in their visitor book..For me that a very bad experience..

The place was made in line with the Buddhist culture. Nice and small place. The food was good enough and the prices are reasonable. The chicken satay, lung fung soup were good. They pepper chilli squid was slightly salty. The pan fried noodles was really good. Hakka chow too was okay but the kung pao chicken tasted weird.

Happened to walk in the other day while in the area. The tiny place was packed! Luckily a table emptied out very soon and I got a place. Wasn't planning on a huge meal... just a soup and a starter.

The interiors are pleasant. Only issue are that the chairs are placed too close together back to back and the one behind keeps pushing into you. An annoyance indeed.

I asked for a Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and a Roast Pork Chilli... and a Thums Up to round off my meal. Service was extremely quick and efficient. Full marks for that. The Thums Up came first, nicely chilled and not flat at all. Very pleasing.

Then came the soup. It was made just fine, with the right consistency. Unfortunately, it was in a small bowl and filled to the brim, making mixing sauces difficult. They ought to serve in larger bowls. And if they claim they served more than normal, it would simply reinforce my issue with their portions.

The Roast Pork Chilli I had ask for dry, which was indeed so. I was expecting more of the double fried kinds and was a tad disappointed. The meat was very soft and seemed good quality, though it had a mildly boiled taste (watery). It came with the usual tossed pepper and onion. But herein was the real downer. The quantity served was absolutely DISMAL. It seemed less than half the portions that are served normally, and at a rather expensive Rs 320 plus taxes. I did point it out to the manager and he apologised, saying it will not happen again.  Yeah sure. Like that helps me.

Billing and payments were efficient, Meal ended with Chlormint candy served in a small basket. Somehow did not want to mess up my meal with that :)

To sum it up - A reasonably good experience marred by abysmal portions. A soup, a single dish plus a soft drink for Rs 620 plus in a non-premium outlet in a location that isn't prime. The powers that be... please take note.

Buddha Bites is definitely a surprise package, located inside a house on the ground floor, Buddha bites has really some nice dishes up their sleeves. Easy to locate, just besides citi style towards Panditia Place, they have some delectable dishes which obviously should be tried by each and every food lover ! The crispy chilli baby and the seven jewel rice are two dishes which stood out for me for sure. 
Staff is friendly and delivers your order pretty fast which is what you exactly need after a very long day. This place even offers wide range of mojitos which we didn't bother to try, but will surely do when we visit this place again! 
This is a little gem tucked away in a quiet corner but don't judge their exterior the food is super delicious and pocket pinch is pretty modest for the food and the quality of food they serve! Highly recommended!

The pork slices are supple with perfect blend of spices, delicious flavour. and exquisite taste. We tried Seven jewels rice, Sea food soup and pan fried fish. All were awesome. I will definitely recommend everyone to try the chinese out there.

Heyy nice place! I had heard loads of good stuff about Buddha Bites and decided to give it a try. We ordered for fish ball soup which was delicious. The crab cakes were just about ok but the show stealer was the Jumbo Prawns with butter garlic sauce which absolutely had me! Such lovely buttery melt in the mouth prawn with a hint of garlic simply made my dinner. The schezwan lamb was quite a let down...barely 6 thin shreds of lamb and a bland prep overall! The fried ice cream for dessert was lovely too! I loved how these guys gave tulsi leaves infused water to drink!
No two thoughts about the warm and cordial hospitality!

Buddha Bites, located in Panditia Road just opposite of Triangular Park, one min walking from Rash Behari Avenue. This restaurant strives to offer Kolkata’s most authentic and enjoyable Chinese food. The restaurant has an exquisitely theme base ambiance and its first-of-its-kind in the city that promises a blend of food and ambience. Apart from ambiance, at a first glance you definitely get the feeling that it’s a pretty small restaurant and barely accommodate 20-22 people at a time. Sitting arrangements are comfortable enough but you cannot expect any privacy as tables are very close to each other.

After getting seated, I quickly decide the menu. For appetizer we settled with ‘Chicken Lung Fung Soup’ and ‘Chicken Wanton Soup’. Both soups were good enough, nice flavour, balance fillings, nice way to start our meal. Than for starters we love to enjoy ‘Dragon Chicken‘ and ‘Pan Fried Fish‘ followed by ‘Thumbs Up’. Dragon Chicken was delicious, perfect use of spices to give that mouth watering sense. Pan Fried Fish tasted even better, just like Pandas and Feng Shui, Chinese food is well known for being incredible and Buddha Bites will unquestionably give you that feel.

Finally for main course we ordered ‘Mongolian Chicken’, ‘Spicy Black Bean Fish’, ‘Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice’ and for dessert ‘Ice Cream’. When the food arrives, seeing the tiny portion of rice I was surprised. I asked the sever that we ordered for four Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice, and seeing the quantity its felt that they were making some mistake but server clarify its four schezwan chicken fried rice. My mood was completely ruined after seeing the quantity. Mongolian Chicken was well cooked, diced chicken grilled with chilli oil tossed. Spicy Black Bean Fish was just above average, well marinated fish tossed with black bean bell paper. There is nothing new to talk about ice cream. Generally speaking taste of the food was good enough but quantity wise huge disappointment.

Very poor. Last night we ordered home delivery. During the placement of order it was repeatedly mentioned that all food should be without eggs as my wife is allergic to eggs. When we opened the package we saw all the items had liberal garnishing of eggs. It was late in the night, could not call back the restaurant. My wife had to go without dinner. 
People with allergies to particular food items should never eat here as these guys  just will not listen. Food allergies could prove fatal, so please regard this review as a warning.

We tried Buddha Bites with two of my friends last weekend. The ambience was superb 10/10 on that. Special mention and appreciation for water served and dipped with tulsi tree. Starter we tried was superb. We tried chilli mustard fish and chilli pepper prawn. It was great. 
For main course I tried lamb,  here Buddha team lost 1 whole point. First the choice of noodle was not available, secondly the lamb was not good. The taste, the sticky ness of the meat deprived me for trying  it more. Desert was good , I would recommend to guests to try fried ice cream, and deep sea for drinks, as mojitos was just okish. Service was prompt(Order To Plate is around 6-10 mins). People serving us were very nice and courteous.

I went to Buddha Bites with my Mom for lunch.. We reached there at 4:30 pm, we thought the restaurant will be closed as the lunch time was over.. But luckily it was open.. Decor,ambiance is cosy n hotel staffs r very pleasing. I ordered Seafood hot n Sour soup,  Chicken wrapped prawn ( 6pc ), Chilly Mustard fish (6 pc ), Mixed Singapore Rice Noodles. Taste of each items were perfect.. Quantity is appreciable compare to its price specially Noodles would have been sufficient for 3 persons.. N one can easily locate big chunks of chicken n prawn in the Noodles..
Bill was around Rs 900, which i believe quite reasonable for what they served..

Too much too less. While the cost is northbound, food quality & quantity is southbound. Service is also lazy & below par. Visit at your own risk.

This place is Zen. the ambiance, the interiors, the smell of the incense and the chanting.... not to mention the amazing food, the courteous servers and the variety and the reasonable prices.  If on an odd day you need good food to lighten up, take your buddies, or just yourself, and visit Buddha Bites. I guarantee  you, your pocket and your tummy will all end up very very happy. :)

Good place to dine in. Went there last friday with my wife on her birthday. Ordered Dragon chicken as starter with sweet corn chicken soup. Both were of good quality. In the main course we ordered Schezwan fried rice & Hunan fish. Both were good specially the fish was of very good quality. But the most important thing is that it is very pocket friendly i.e 1000 for two.

This weekend was the turn of this quaint little restaurant on Panditiya Road. Set in a corner of the road, you nearly miss it as you drive past. Low volume Buddhist hymns greet you as you enter this tastefully decorated place.
We started off with the old favourite sweet corn soup with Pepper chili prawns as a starter. The soup was so dissapointingly  thick that you had to literaly cut through it. Better to have called it corn flour soup ! But the prawns were so good...very delicately balanced with herbs it was beautifully soft and flavoured..lovely. Hakka Noodles with Spicy Hoisin Chicken and Fish Chilli Plum was our main items and we were not dissapointed. The fish was outstanding and the chicken not far behind. But what was really good was the often under rated noodles...the preparation of which to my mind is not so easy as it looks. We finished off with their take on Fried Ice creme (so-so).
One thing...their 1 plate of noodles is enough for 3 moderate eaters..so careful while ordering. Overall I think this place needs our encouragement and certainly better than the over all rating shown. I give it  4 and a thumbs up.

Buddha bites, very true to its name, has the feel of a  Buddhist monastery reflected in its decor. The ambience is very soothing and even the background music is in sync with the mood of the place. We started off with an array of soups- sweet corn, hot n sour, chicken wanton and lung fung soup. Next we gorged on dragon chicken , chicken meat balls, egg wrapped fried rice, cantonese pan fried noodles, singapore rice noodles,clay pot rice. We were recommded General Tao chicken and it turned out to be downright superb! We also tried sliced chicked bok choy and five slice lamb, both of which were quite delicious..especially the lamb! Now no meal is complete without a proper dessert and fried ice cream was the perfect ending to a splendid dinner. So next time you have a craving for chinese food, be sure to visit this little restaurant. You wont be disappointed. :)

Went there with my family on a Saturday after hearing mixed reviews of this restaurant. For started we took chicken wrapped prawn and chicken dumplings. The fusion of chicken and prawn was amazing but the dumplings were not upto the mark. the outer covering was pretty thick. For main course we took a takeaway of pan fried noodles and chili chicken. The noodles was a huge disappointed. I would not recommend that at all. The sides were alright. Needs improvement but full points to the friendly staff and the decor.

Went there for a Friday dinner and I must say I was overwhelmed by the ambiance and the food. Rarely would you find a place with a combination like this. The place greets you with Buddhist chants and awesome Buddha themed decor. So far as food is concerned, it serves one of the best Chinese food in Kolkata. We had starters like Chicken Satay, chilli mustard prawn, Chicken wrapped prawn, chilli pork, chicken lung fung soup, all of them tasted great. The only letdown was Chicken sui mai, I am not having that ever again. Staff is very cordial and helpful. Price is also moderate. Only downside that I found was the size of the sitting area. They hardly have 7-8 tables and the space in between the tables is also very less. Apart from that it's a great place for dinner if you are in a small group. I am definitely going for a revisit soon, when are you?

Another good Chinese place in the already crowded "Bengali Chinese" food market. There has been a spurt in the number of Chinese places in south Kolkata alone, and I am left wondering how they plan to differentiate themselves from the competition as most if them cater to the same segment of consumers. 

Coming to the food, we had ordered Roast Chilly Pork, Schezwan Rice in the main course and Pan Fried Chilly Fish add the starter. The good was good, decent quantity for two people. Price is slightly steep.

The ambience is peaceful with prayer wheels lining both sides of the walls. I found the music a little weird, though not particularly distracting. 

On another occasion I had tried the Fried Ice cream which had been quite a disaster, so better to avoid desserts at this place. 

Also a special mention that it is open for lunch till 4:30 PM when sone kitchens close up by 3 PM.

The feel of a Buddhist Monastery with the best of Chinese preparations...yes Buddha Bites it is.

The place is easy to find and gives you the feel of a monastery even before you enter it. The interior looks even more beautiful with a statue of Lord Buddha and Bells. Overall it was very beautiful. Thanks to Monalisa for suggesting this place.

The list of items to choose from was quite big and they also had a list of Buddha Bites special items. We oredred Chicken Lung Fung Soup and Dragon Chicken to start off with. Then the main course had Young Chow Fries Rice (spl.) and Hunan Fish. All the items were exceptionally prepared and I just loved each one of them. (Though I found the  conventional items better than the special ones...personal opinion).

The cost was slightly on the higher side but I would love to pay it again for such brilliantly cooked food.

 Ambiance- 4.5/5

Well this place had quite a high and low to it. Starters were simply mouth watering. I like to have my food with any kind of drink so ordered for some mocktails. It was really not their forte. So dont even think about ordering any. In maincourse, the noodles was undercooked as well as the veggies. It ws really not eatable. However, the rice and the chicken side dish was pretty good.

I heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to visit this place on a Sunday with an old friend. I booked a table on their website and in five minutes they called me and confirmed my reservation. The place is in the lane beside Triangular Park Citi Style. Not difficult to find at all. The place is small and cosy and has a feel of an Buddhist Monastery. The ceiling has those Buddhist bells and there is a beautiful Buddhist statue welcoming you. The menu is divided into certain sections where everything is priced the same. It is convenient and helps us in not getting biased on the price while ordering the food. I was full so we opted for a light meal.We ordered deep sea and pink panther as mocktail and chilli mustard Prawn as starter. The starter arrived in 5 minutes. It was a bit spicy and the quantity was a bit small. It was delicious though and the presence of mustard gave it a Bengali twist. We wanted to order Peking duck but the waiter said it was not available. We ordered roast pork chilli instead. The mocktails were refreshing but arrived late after we were done with starters. Then the waiter came and told us that the Peking duck is available. But since the pork dish is already made, we couldn't order the duck. This was an unfortunate mishap. The pork was also a bit spicy and was nothing to write home about. Pocket pinch was 1000 including an aerated drink. We hardly had any of its signature dishes, so its too early to judge them on the food. The score given is on the soothing ambience and the good service. They texted me after I left. Will visit soon......after this review was posted, they personally called me up and asked for my views.  Keep up the good work!!!

Heard a lot about this restro and finally decided to pay a visit. Location is bit odd and there were around 7 tables which can accommodate around 30 persons. Not very spacious. We went there for a weekend dinner.

Ambience: It was peaceful with resemblance to Buddhist culture as the name suggests. Bells, Chinese lights, red walls and a soft background music of Buddhist Chants. Nothing over the top.

Service: It was prompt and the servers were very courteous. They had a fair knowledge of the food out there. Kudos to that.

Food: The best Chinese food I have had there. For the starters we ordered Pepper chilli Tofu and their signature dish Chicken wrap prawn which had a thick layer of chicken outside and prawn filling inside. Tofu was tasty. The taste just lingered on. For the Mains, we had Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice, Mixed hakka Noodles,Seven jewels Rice, Four treasure Vegetables, Five Spice Chicken and their signature general tao Chicken.

All the items were worth trying. Loved it.

Conclusion: If you have a craving for good Chinese food with not so over the top ambience and where you have to jostle for space while sitting, then you are in the right place. ;-D

We looked up in Zomato for an affordable yet reputed place to have lunch and decided to visit Buddha Bites. We instantly loved the ambiance which is soothing with less lights and a Buddhist monastery style decor. There were beautiful Buddhist hymns playing at the background. It was warm & cosy. Services were prompt & the food was absolutely delicious. Chilli mustard fish is a must-try. Also the fried ice-cream is brilliant. All the best to them & keep up the good job.

The decor shows the amount of effort in it. The space is a little clumsy. The food is average... Some dishes are really good but some are below average. The staffs should be careful more about changing the cutleries after each course. The water with a tint of lemon and basil is a very nice touch.

Nd like me...if ur expecting something of the level of Chinese food wich u get in tangra and all...u will be highly disappointed. The food was below average...except for the barbecue pork spare ribs...which tasted good but it was no way near the actual barbecue pork chops...a special mention to the Singapore rice noodles....it was pathetic...I never had worser rice noodles than this...the ambience is cozy but nothing extravagant...pretty average decor...Honestly...there are much better places in Kolkata where u can get good authentic Chinese food.

Visited buddha bites for my mother's birthday lunch after going through the rave reviews on zomato. As mentioned in the earlier reviews by other  foodies, found this place to be very cosy and the chinese artifacts give a serence effect to the ambience.

We ordered Non veg manchow soup and honestly i just loved its flavor, it was followed by dragon chicken which was spicy yet  had the ring amount of zing. For main course we had ordered Seven Jewel Rice, however it did dissappoint me as the rice was totally bland, along with it we ordered the five spice chicken which tasted good.Also for desert we ordered the fried ice cream which was a first time experience for me.Overall the food was good.

Coming to the pocket pinch, the bill came upto Rs1200 which i would say is totally value for money.

The new Chinese chain to show up, Buddha Bites somehow failed to score above average in all quarters. The decor was very ordinary - the regular red and gold 'chinese look' with a few pictures and figurines of Buddha thrown in here and there.
The portion sizes were very generous indeed. The clay pot rice had a nice earthen aroma but could not tantalize my taste. The pork, on the other hand, was cooked in a pretty good sauce but the meat itself was dry.
To be honest, with so many options in town, I am not going to go back to this place any time soon.

Wanted to step out of office, for a weekday lunch. Chinese being the craving - quickly scanned zomato for options - and zoomed in on 'buddha bites',  after reading  a few of the top reviews & a 4.0 rating ( the rating has dropped a notch since i ate!)

I wasn't too disappointed with the ambience or the food, and was as per expectations. Though, they could do without the coke commercial fridge right at the centre of the outlet. it kinda kills it. 

I liked the menu & it's presentation, simple & too the point with std. pricing, exactly what one wants for a weekday lunch.

Food ordered:

Chicken wrap prawn schezwan - recommended by the order taker & reviewers

Mixed hakka noodles

Kung pao chicken

Yes , the food was just right in terms of quantity and tasted just like most calcuttan indo-chinese joints do - jolly good!

Service: friendly & prompt. 

Pocket pinch: 1100 for the meal for 2, inclusive of bottled water & areated bevys.

Buddha bites is located next in to street of City style at Gariahaat  .
 Very nice and cozy ambience which Gives you a true feeling of serenity . Though I m a very fussy foodie , but at Buddha Bites I should say hands down has got  best Chinese food In Town that too with a reasonable pricing  . The service is awesome too .Most of the food I tried was recommended to me by the Manager himself . 
While I was waiting for my food I overheard a very interesting conversation where a guest wanted to go out after ordering as she realized that she had to attend something urgent so she said that she will pay for her food and will come back later . The Incharge refused that and said "Noworries  come back later I will keep ur food ready and pay later no need to pay now  ", yes  the lady came back later after sometime had her food and paid for it then  ( her food was ready when she came back ) Now that's what a hospitality is all about not looking at instant loss or gains but empathizing the client's situation , Kudos to you Buddha bites you certainly proved that
Dnt forget to try the Manager's special  Chicken with bitter  gourd ( karela) in Black bean sauce . 
The Manager here  I believe his name is Lama is   a very  jolly and friendly who loves his job and his enthusiasm is quiet Obvious in his team too  
Thank you Buddha bites for your awesome hospitality and food I will certainly return whenever I am in kolkata  and recommend to anyone who loves Chinese food to try Buddha bites at Gariahaat for once for sure .

The food served is only Chinese and they quality and quantity is good , talking about the taste is ok , one cannot complain about the food taste , we tried wonton and Rice noodles and shredded chicken the taste was good but we can aspect even better taste from them. Food cost for two is around  1000/- which pretty ok.

Located within walking distance of triangular park, Buddha Bites has become a frequent haunt of ours. As soon as one enters, the first thing which strikes the mind is the  ambience- monastery bells, buddha statues, soothing music -it has a very calming and peaceful effect. Today we started with chicken talumein soup, and for the main course tried the seven jewels rice (uses seven different kinds of vegetables), a mixed singapore rice noodles, along with the five spice chicken. I don't know what it is here, but the taste of the food is very different from most chinese restaurants that I have visited. It has quite a different punch in it..and as always, loved it. The rice and the chicken were specially exquisite. Service was excellent; the entire team was very cordial. And the pocket pinch: 896/- for three people, and we still had to pack some of it!! Overall, its a great place to go to for chinese food.

I'd recommend the cantonese pork because truly that's the only thing i've tried and loved it. The hakka noodles and the cantonese chow is amazing and they deliver it quite fast. Over all amazing food.

I had gone to dis plce during durga puja...it is a fairly cool place with a buddist theme. Since it has got a buddhist touch to it, itz calm and serene. But don't order anything pan- fried or cantonese., because it tastes just like heated up vaseline. The hakka chowmein and other dry varieties are quite tasty, but do not dare order anything greasy. When u dine in a restaurent, what u expect is edible and sumptous food at a good price, you sure don't want to feel that u spent ur hard earned cash all just in vain, so plz don't go for greasy gravy food...

I visited Buddha Bites with my friends yesterday. What struck me right at the entrance was the decor, which was clutter free. Very neat and simple. We had Fried Chicken Wanton and Chicken Satay for starters. I personally did not like the Satay though the wanton was good. Then we ordered Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles, Egg wrapped Fried Rice and the signature dish General Pao Chicken. All the three were delicious. But the service is pretty late, we had to wait for a considerable amount of time between two dishes. 
So overall a good experience.

Conveniently located (on the lane just beside citi style mall at rashbehari avenue) uniquely decorated, Buddha Bites welcomed us with the enchanting music of Tibet and the likes. In a nutshell, their Chinese cuisine is true to its name and all the dishes that we tried had a balanced taste about them. They were neither too spicy, nor too bland, neither tangy nor sweet. They were PERFECT!We ordered Pan fried fish, Moon fan rice(chicken) and Hunan chicken to appease our flaming hunger. The fish was mouth-watering in smell, look and taste. the rice was very different, not the usual fried rice, with a good number of oriental spices thrown in and generous proportions of chicken. Hunan chicken stole the show with its Hot n Spicy but definitely delicious flavor. The prices are on the higher side; but well such places as these are rare treats and therefore quite affordable! Needless to say we will visit again! :)

a sudden plan for a saturday lunch landed us to this place *discovered on zomato by 1* and we went somewhat dubiously inside after taking in the unexpected residential location, authentic houses and an overpowering smell of meat cooking just beside the entrance *thats the kitchen of course- wished it was there in the back*. once inside, it was a tibetan overdose but very authentic decor nonetheless :P we expected to see variants of momos and thukpas and my growling tummy shuddered at the though of having them for lunch :-|
the menu however, came as a bolt of the blue! it had a great selection of both indian and chinese cuisines mostly, with a few sprinkles of thai..almost nothing tibetan -_-no significance of the decor/name :P but but but...once the food came i couldnt care less!!! both the chicken clear soup and the hot n sour soup tasted divine!! our pork ribs were the best i have yet tasted in kolkata- lusciously sticky, caramelly, sweet yet spicy, the soft meat separating from the bone aahh i daydream about those still :D our maincourse of mixed fried rice was great as well and we chose an unconventional companion for it- the chilli mustard chicken which was whoa! so spicy, tangy, the mustard paste was so freshly grounded we were salivating and tearing up simultaneously :P :P yeahh it was seriously that great *_* we went back a second time for that chicken precisely!
apart from my rave, the basics were good! though the place is kinda small, its clean, the prices are very economical, the quantity great, the staff is efficient and its location *just opposite citisyle, deep inside the alley* makes it very convenient for me to haunt it again and again for my ribs :D oopsie..not mine, the pork ribs ^_^

A little walk down the side lane of citi style and voila! Finally struck off this place from my ever increasing wish list. When my bestest buddy took me there for lunch today I was immadiately blown away with the interior decor. It made us long for a visit to the monasteries in the peaceful Himalayas!
For our first course we had pan fried fish. The gravy was delicious and the fish was just mouth watering experience. Nicely made, and soft, it did justice to the term appetizer.
Next we had moon fan rice and hunan chicken. The serving was exactly in the right measure for two, or I dont know, I had a gargantuan appetite, maybe ate a little bit extra, the chicken was succulent, and spicy, but not too much. It was enough to make you ask for another serving.
I am not a big fan of Chinese cuisine. But quaint little joints like this can change my mind. The rice specially was completely diferent from everything I had before.
The only thing that was a wee bit downer was the ac. The staff could have turned it on when we were having all those dishes, and not when we were paying the bill. It would have made us a bit more comfortable with those hot and spicy dishes.
Apart from that, it sure deserves many re-visits!

Buzz(Russel Street) has always been my place for friend's reunion parties but Buddha Bites being the new buzz in town so we thought to give it a try. So as we went in we loved the overall ambiance. The place is not that big but the decor was somewhat having a resemblance to monasteries. Now coming to the food we discussed among ourselves and with the staff and ordered the following dishes-
Starters- Chicken Satay, Barbeque Spared Ribs(Pork)
Main Course- Chicken Hakka Noodles and Chicken Schezwan Rice
Side Dish- Five Spice Lamb, Hoisein Chicken

Overall the food were great specially the Five Spice Lamb and the Spared Ribs.

Great place.. a zen like ambience with a good mix of starters, soups, and full meal courses. The quantity served in full courses is way more than ample and the desserts are really nice. The fried ice cream is strongly recommended for its egg like structure along with a muffin coating.:)

Highly disappointed with this place. After seeing it trending on zomato and reading such good reviews about it, I decided to go there for lunch. Highly disappointed. Food was below average to say the least. Except manchow soup which was average and chicken in hot basil which was average too. Cantonese noodles were sweet, chicken five spices had so much of garam masala or some such kind of masala which made our stomach burn after a few pieces. 
The rating is 1 for soup and starter and 1 for the dessert which was fried ice cream. Other than that, this place is not as good as the reviews.

'Buddha Bites' is located at Panditia Road near Rashbehari Avenue.They have another outlet at Hazra.I've visited this outlet with my lover during this year Durga puja times.First of all the ambiance of this restaurant is good.When we entered this restaurant we've seen a Large Buddha Statue is here.We ordered here Dragon Chicken as a starter.This is tasty.Then we ordered main courses like Chicken Fried Rice & Chilli Chicken.Service is too late.Price is little high than their food quality.waiters are well behaved.

today was my first time there. i went with my dad as we wanted to make a change from the usual Hatari food that we always gorge on. but to speak the truth i was grossly disappointed. i being a big fan of the very popular dish "pan fried fish", here also i ordered the same for starters. the taste was fine. but the outer portion was not at all crispy. wen i pointed out the same, i was told very politely that apparently thats how they serve it at Buddha Bites!! but seriously if thats how the dish is served, the chef should take a tour of few other restaurants and learn the exact texture of the dish.... the main course was also not overwhelming. compared to the taste which was just about okay, the prices, i felt was a bit high... a restaurant in that location has to compete with the likes of Hatari which has been serving excellent food for years now!!! the chicken was good and supple. we had ordered chicken in basil oyster and it was good. the only dish of the evening that i liked. apart from that i wasnt much impressed with either the starter or the noodles. u really need to improve the quality of the food. about the ambience, i simply loved it. and the staff was also quite amicable...

Buddha bites is a quaint little place inside of Gariahat's many lanes near triangular park. Went there for a friend's birthday treat. The most interesting fact that catches your eye just on entering is the big Buddha figurine at the doorstep followed by the primarily red decor that really fires up your gastric enzymes suited by the Buddhist hymns in the background. The staff were very gentle and attentive behaviour . They were quick to point out dishes according to our choices. The service is quick.We went for the mouth watering pan fried fish followed by the egg wrapped fried rice: a sure surrender to the eyes as well as the taste added by the gastronomic delight like the Mongolian chicken..we were left satiated and virtually hungry for more. The price was reasonable. Will really return for more. :-)

Its a small cosy place near Triangular Park... a ground floor of a house has been successfully converted to this new restaurant.... bright red walls and a typically Buddhist environment welcomes you warmly the moment you enter....

Quite a popular joint for locals and for people like us who first decides on what to eat and where and then refers to the reviews of the particular selection....

Food is delectable... starting from prawns and squid to the mixed fried rice and lamb... spicy and savory will be right words to describe the food.... 

Service quality is not so pleasing though... the service persons seems to have come from Mars... who doesn't realize that appetizers are to be served with the soups and not later !!!!! Their non apologetic smiling faces will irritate you no end but then.... cant be helped....

The fried ice cream was a real disaster.... those who finds it mouthwatering should actually try the dish in Benjarong ( the thai restaurant) in South City Mall.... after only having it there you'll realize were I'm coming from...

Overall its a so so experience for me.... excepting the food part which was quite pleasing.... try and groom your staffs well.... ill visit your restaurant again....

I could have easily given this place 4 out of 5 for their starters alone,but since my review is based on both appetizers and main course i would restrict myself to give the place a rating of 3.5. Situated near triangular park,the place has a nice and positive vibe to it. The interior is pleasant and the tibetian hymns and music playing in the background is good to listen to.It has a comfortable sitting arrangement with courteous staffs always ready to help with the choice of food. Buddha bites should definitely be visited for their non veg appetizers. I have been to this place for a number of times now n I have tried almost all of their starters and never for once have i been disappointed. The roast pork chilli and chicken wrap prawn in slezwan sauce are the highlight dishes of this restaurant, and trust me when i say this....each of this dish has a flavour and taste to die for. The chicken wrap prawn is a personal favourite and i can never get enough of the sauce served along with it. Among the other starters I feel chicken sui mui,fried wantons and pan fried fish are really good and delightful. The price though a little high for the quantity of food served, the food excels in its quality and its worth paying the money. Wish i had the same verdict wih their main course. I have tried their egg wrapped fried rice and cantonese pan fried noodles which tasted average. The same goes for their chicken side dishes. Though there are some deliciously tasty items like five spice chicken and chicken in basil oyster sauce which i thoroughly enjoy everytime i order it..i feel general tao's chicken and mongolian chicken needs a lot of improvement. I personally think the dishes are a bit overprized when it comes to the main course.
In short,though it performs on a mediocre level on the main food course, buddha bites stands out for their non veg appetizers and I can visit this place again and again just for them.

First visit and based on TripAdvisor ratings. Went for the 'chicken wrap prawn' as starters as per their staff's recommendation. This was okay. The 'roast chilly lamb' and 'schezwan fried rice' were very tasty and thoroughly enjoyed by us.

We were there for lunch on a Monday early afternoon - we were the only guests throughout. The place is small and well decorated with Buddhist prayer drums and a huge bust of Buddha at its entrance.

For desserts we went for traditional Bengali sweets to 'Banchharam' - but that is another review.

On another guilt trip with my girlfriends!
Kick started with lime soda and chicken wrapped around king sized prawn in a schezwan sauce, since this particular item has had great reviews it was but obvious for us to give it a shot....cannot say if I was mightily satisfied ...I cudnt really taste the chicken (if any!) The prawns too were a tad smelly (not the freshest ).
For main course it was chicken hakka noodles, glass noodles (more like semolina, highly dissatisfied ) and Mongolian chicken (which is shredded chicken in an almost identical manchurian gravy) tasted all gingery and hunan fish (the best of the lot)..i am sceptical about fish since I am not a fish fan but the fish here was great fresh well cooked and succulent .
The ambiance decor gives out a very comfortable feel....
I wouldn't say I would want to come back again but it can however be good for a one time visit.

A little eatery tucked away on a junction at Panditia Road, Buddha Bites (BB) is living proof that size does not always matter! Considering Chinese food is available every 500 yards in our metro cities, it takes a lot of effort to create a menu with a difference and a lot more to deliver great quality. BB manages both rather effortlessly. 

From the delectable Wrapped Prawns (jumbo prawns jumbo prawns wrapped in sliced chicken, tossed with onions, bell peppers and dry red chillies in Hoisin sauce) to the fascinating Chilli Mustard Fish (you have to eat this one to believe it), Salt and Peppers Prawns (a complete revelation because they aren't dry and doughy as oft found in other places), to General Tao Chicken, Roast Chilli Pork......every item we ate had a unique flavour. Do remember to order lots of the Fried Icecream, especially if you have children at the table!

We were so impressed with the food that we asked them to cater for a lunch for 30 at home. Our guests could not stop praising the food! 

Super food and great value for money, BB is a must do in Kolkata. I wish they had more tables to accommodate the droves that flock there every day. Good news, there is a new, larger BB on Harish Mukherjee Road :-)

This new year you can have your lunch or dinner at Budha Bites if you are interested in having chinease cuisine.  This restaurant is situated in near Rashbehari avenue. The  décor of the place is very nicely done with red and cream.  As far as the food is concerned its very good.  Now the menu  we ordered  pepper chili tofu , it was very nicely prepared . Then we ordered cantonese  pan fried noodles , schezwan fried rice , chili mustered chicken and panfried fish.  All the preparations were well prepared. Then we ordered dessert which was honey tossed noodles  and banana spring role. It was simply out of the world. I will definitely come back again

Another Chinese restaurant in South Kolkata located at Triangular park, can hardly accommodate 20 to 25 heads.
They do not hold any signature dish of their own. 
The decor is not any extraordinary except the Buddha statue at the entrance.
A bit over priced restaurant in compare with its other sister restaurants. Tastes nice. I have tried their-
Chicken Satay- A must starter for all. They could increase its quantity.
Hunan Chicken- Very spicy yet tastes good.
Slice Chicken with Basil Oyster- Not liked it that much.
Cantonese Plum- Shreded pork dipped in a sweet brown colored sauce. 
And in main course we order seven jewels rice, egg rapped fried rice, and moon fan.
P.S. The review is after 3 times visit.

Ordered Sczehwan F.Rice and Manchurian Chicken.
It was sandy sandy types...quantity good...it felt that they had put sand on it purposely. Because we ordered one S.rice to be packed and complained when they brought the packed one...after we complained they took the packed one inside and came back after 5mins...
But they did not compensate for the sandy stuff. Ill screw them soon..
Packed one was good in taste and Manchurian Chicken tasted good too.

Pros :- AMBIENCE, cheap,and quality food.
Recommendation :- Dragon Chicken(Starter).
People talked a lot about the food, but what jumped out at me,literally hitting anybody in the face,is the ambience of the restaurant!
The name is Buddha Bites,and it takes its name VERY seriously. 
The decorating is brilliant,conforming to the name..and its almost like entering a Buddhist monastery,which is supplimented by background music,which is equally in tune with the theme!
And the food is brilliant too!
I recommed the Dragon Chicken as a starter. And its cheap too!

I planned to visit this place and went there last Saturday. The building is red colored and you can easily identify the significance easily. Which I liked the most about this restaurant is it's ambiance. Properly decorated with matching entities and the background music will definitely give you the essence of a Buddha monastery. I ordered five spice chicken and mixed Hakka noodles as main course. I wanted to order chicken satay but my partner denied. The quantity was sufficient for us. The chicken was very tasty and soft. After the main course I ordered fried ice cream which I think their specialty. Yes it was. I thought it would be very weird but it was so good. I won't tell how it's made because it will kill your curiosity but I will surely suggest you to try this. The staffs working over here are very good and well behaved. I will visit again very soon :)

Not a good restaurant at all. I went there in the puja time and the quantity of the food is bad as well as the price is high. And the most shocking thing is that, the price of the 1 litre mineral water 55 INR, where the actual price is 18 INR. so they had charged it 3 times of the original. I informed it to the customer forum. I really dont know whether they would take any kind of action or not. I asked the manager of that restaurant but he was not able to gave me such a decent answer.

This little restaurant is quite a surprise. Tucked away in a narrow street off busy-noisy Rash Behari Avenue, it catches your attention because of its terra cotta painted exterior. And when you step in, the warmth of the terra cotta is transformed into sheer tranquility. The place is small and very thoughtfully done - the furniture, the lighting, and the music converge to give you a sense of almost monastic peace. 

We went to Buddha bites on 24th October for dinner. It is located just opposite lane to the Triangular park which beside the City Style. Though the sitting capacity of the restaurant is around for 30 people but it is cozy and warm.

The best way of describing its quality and range is that the menu doesn't include sweet and sour anything, nor chili chicken -- two nauseatingly pervasive items on Chinese restaurant menus in India. We ordered Chicken Talumein soup, Chicken Wrap Prawn as starters. Next we ordered Moon Fan Rice and Fish Chilly Plum and some beverages. Staffs are cordial but a little improvement of food is required!

The bonus is when you get the check -- Buddha Bites is probably the best value for money in the city.

PS -- Don't go to the one on Harish Mukherjee Road! Same name but the ambience is shattering.

Had been reading good reviews about this eatery for quite some time so went there to check out. Small eatery with an interesting decor and has a cosy snug ambience. This being my first visit to an chineese diner we decided not to be very adventurous and stick to staples - neither the menu prompts you to be so. We ordered lung fung soup, panfried noodles , fried rice and 'rost' chicken. They were fast with the orders and the portions were more than adequate and the pricing was very reasonable. The food was judiciously flavoured with an accent on the standard oriental 5 spices, the rost chicken was nice but I thought it was a bit over-roasted (fried). Food on the whole was good, better than most of the small diners that now abound in South Calcutta near Triangular Park - but nothing great to write home about. 

On the whole - value for money. What dissapointed was the quality of service and the cockiness of the staff for which they loose half a point in the ratings.

This place has a bit longish appearence and has a little space crunch i feel. On a weekend before the pujas I had to wait for as much as 45 mins inside the restro at around 3pm but didn't get a place to sit n wait,though my friend managed one. After such a long wait, I gave up ideas for a heavier meal as their kitchen was also going to close. So we settled for a platter of Dragon chicken. The food served looked great and tasted well,but had an excess of garlic in it, which hampered the taste quite a bit. The amount was ample and waiters courteous n polite.Decor and ambience is good.
Hope a better experience the next time I checkout the other items in their menu :)

Durga puja for me and my partner means trying out new places for dinner. We were ready to try out some different places when this one came to our mind . The recent opened place is easy to locate ( just take the road adjacent to the city style store near gariahat, the restro is on the left hand side on the second left lane) . The place is a small one floor restaurant with eight to ten tables. The interiors are beautifully done keeping with the theme. The menu was a short one(for the puja) and we were a bit surprised by the shortage of choice for once.

We ordered Dragon Chicken as a starter and followed up with chicken hakka noodles and a chicken dish (cant recall exact name ). The starter came quick and ut was really delicious. There were so many red chillies in the dish, making it a super fiery chicken starter but we loved its a bit tangy yet super hot taste. The noodles were hakka noodles cooked with less oil and the quantity was good. Perfect for two adults . The chicken was also quite good. The service there was fast and we had a great time trying the new dishes. It's a great choice for a family restaurant.

First of all this restaurant is a bit difficult to find, but thanks to zomato and it's service for providing maps along with other informations regarding a restaurant.
It's a small food joint situated in a turning of a lane- rather in a corner way.
We entered the joint around 2:30 PM and ordered a two Singapore Rice Noodles and a veg main course.
Now-
1) The waiter helped us with suggestions as we were new there and it worked for us !!
2) The service was prompt and efficient.
3) The food was OTT.. but somewhere I felt the noodles should have been less oily and it was inundated with turmeric. There was a thick trace of loose oil as we finished our meal and dish was empty.
4) I too felt that the quantity and the price is a bit disproportionate and the price can weigh heavy on pocket sometimes.
5) The food was very light unlike any other Chinese food joints which made it unconventionally 'more than one-time visit place' .
Now there are some points which I can't miss jotting here down-
1) The ambiance and decor is real good but the counter part of the joint is inseparable with the dine-in place which can sometimes be a spoilsport for the people who love intimate-privacy. That part should be isolated.
2) The space between two tables should be increased.
One thing I must mention here- it was the main chefs birthday. It looked like a family there as the waiters and the manager celebrated his birthday in front of us with their hand-baked chocolate cake and made us a small part of it by giving a piece of cake to each of the guests...
Experience is good !!!
See you again.

The decor is commensurate with the name & the soft music that plays on during lunch and dinner time perfectly suits the ambiance. The service is prompt & the food is good. The five spice preparations are delicious but the one dish that stands out is Dragon Chicken. They also have a special exotic monsoon menu. The only problem is they have a rather restricted menu during the afternoon.One may feel that a few dishes are bit on the oily side but the taste and quality compensates it. The quantity served is moderate for two and the pocket-pinch is worth the food.

Worst ever experience.Both in quantity as well as quality. With the hype raised by different media, being a chinese food fanatic, I tried for the first time and was simply cheated. We were four. On Saptami evening, at first we ordered chicken wanton as starter and with utter surprise. we struggled hard to find out traces of chicken inside. In fact out of eight pieces served , two or three ''wantons'' were served without chicken( missing chicken inside!!). But there were surprises galore yet to come. We talked with the  person concerned before placing the order about the quantity of the mixed chowmein , whether two will suffice for  four as in the main course we tried some new items like  Spicy Hoisin chicken and spicy blackbean chicken. He simply suggested , it would do. When it was served from one bowl, we thought one more yet to come. After finishing, when we waited and finally asked for one more bowl as we ordered , they said it was already served i.e, one bowl contained two plates of mixed chowmein. Well, perhaps, about the quantity of the food every foodlover will understand as we had to order two more plates of mixed chowmein. I was very much disgusted and frustrated. The price is no cheap and about the taste it is pretty "authentic'' ordinary. You need to carry one magnifying glass to discover egg, chicken and prawns in mixed chowmein and in the chicken course, all the chicken pieces were heavily cramped with cornflower to give it a big size look. I will never recommend any body to try even for a single time. The competition is stiff, with this attitude this type of new venture would not last long.

After looking at the photos and reading the reviews of the fellow foodies I decided to visit this place during the Puja Days. I was rather expecting a huge crowd cause of the Pandal hoppers, and so went there a bit early at around 5:45 pm, as it is mentioned here in Zomato that the restaurant stays open from 11 am to 11 pm. instead of any crowd I found that all the staffs were chitchatting on the outside and the door of the restaurant was closed. upon asking whether they were close that day, one staff replied that because of heavy crowd they were taking some rest and the place will open from 6:30 sharp. Without any prior notice beforehand or any notice at all, hanging outside the restaurant, this was decided and put to action by the management. Anyhow since it was a Puja Day as I have mentioned before we thought of visiting some Pandals till 6:30, and did so. When we reached there at the proper time, the scenario was still unchanged and the staffs in a non-cordial way told us to wait for 15 more minutes. By this time the mood for fun and food in me was gone & the adventure of finding a good restaurant had gone sour. But this was not the end of the embarrassment. After those 15 minutes at around 6:45, when we found the place was still not opening, my friend asked the staff again, avoiding my advise to walk away. This time, as if we were disturbing their little chitchat, one staff told us that "it will take time for them to open, and the chef is also absent at that moment". It is needless to say that they made us walk away from their joint with empty stomachs.
To my dismay, I wonder what type of business can run with such malfunctioning staff group!!, and what type of professionalism is shown here by the owner!! 
They may serve good food, but that comes secondary here. Where the basics of hospitality is missing, I wonder is this place really worth it?? 
There are literally thousands of road side eateries in my city. Their food may be shit, but even they know better behavior.  
Foodies, be aware... If you are in luck, you may have a good time, or else be prepared for harassment.  My advice is that there are many truly great Chinese Restaurants in my city. Think of one of them the next time you feel like having Chinese food.
Thank you.

on the go of Puja Pandel hopping on this Astami night we suddenly got this restaurant, though I was acquainted with the name but never came before..
and while searching for restaurants nearby through Zomato we've found this one..
thanks to Zomato for this nice service ...

By location it is situated in very near to Triangular park.. that is a very renowned place of Kolkata. . . 

Food quality is standard. . portions are also good. . .

They decorated the small place quite soothing and interesting. . .

but what I found the lack in their service . .   
the waiters are not friendly and are little bit arrogant . .

overall it was a nice experience being here. . .

We went to Buddha Bites during the pujas, with a group of 16 friends. They seated us early, with hardly any waiting time, specially during the pujas. However, that was the only silver lining of the place. It was all downhill from there on.. 
We ordered dragon chicken, chicken pan fried noodles, chicken hakka noodles and lamb in five spice.
The quantity was good, and the quality was average, not great, but definitely not bad. The shock was that, we later learnt that, they actually served us hoisin chicken, instead of dragon chicken. 
Later, we ordered fried ice cream for dessert, which they took a long time to serve.
Overall, the food, I would say, is over-priced.
Moreover, we were not at all happy with the management, with their inability to deal with large groups..

Edit:
Went there once again, giving them a benefit of doubt for a treat by my grandfather, on the day before Laxmi Puja.
To be very honest, my experience did not improve a bit as once again we were let down by the service and menu. They had a special Puja Menu, even when the Durga Puja had ended, which had exorbitant prices for their regular food items. We had their special Chicken Wrapped Prawns and Crispy Chilly Babycorn for starters. There were no mocktails which was a big let down.
We had 7 Jewel Rice and Chicken Hakka Noodles along with Roasted Chilly Lamb and General Tao's Chicken.
While the food was good, it was not out of the world, though to be honest, the prawn had a very unique taste to it. The Rice felt like it was plain Fried rice and any Street food joint could mimic the noodles. The lamb was pretty good and very very tender. We finished our lunch with fried ice cream, once again unique and good, but not great. 
So when the bill of 2600/- came just for these items, we were pretty shocked. With so many good restaurants out there, there is absolutely no reason to go to Buddha Bites and burn money.

Went there on saptami of Durga puja 2014 with a large group of friends. One thing i liked was that while waiting outside they provide u wid sitting arrangement.
We started with dragon chicken.Then came pan fried noodles,hakka noodles n along with them came Lamb with five spices. There is nothing you can complain about the quality of quantity of food they serve. 
Then for desserts we ordered fried ice cream. They kept us waiting for quite a long time. N when the ice cream came we were really dissapointed. Neither did it taste very good nor was the quantity up to the mark according to the price.
But i would like to add that the place is very small. Not appropriate if u go there with a large group. N they lack proper management.

Moreover they had served us the wrong dish. This i came to know about later. We had ordered dragon chicken as the starter. When it came we were surprised to see that the preparation consisted of a lot of gravy which was quite  unlikely for a starter. We thought may be they had some different way of preparing it. One of my friends had had ordered dragon chicken too. When we saw the pic of  that actual dragon chicken afterwards only then did we realise of the mistake. This was a big turn off factor.

N lastly this place is overpriced. Dont be tempted to visit this place seeing the cost for 2 as 500. Coz it cost us nearly 1700 for 4ppl.
  
Not keen on visiting this place again.

First things be said first, the anticipation was quite a bit high but the end was really disappointing. Nothing seemed right but for the decor, the quality of food provided was very humble and certainly not up to the imagination. The pricing was also a bit too high, and the quantity served was also much lesser than expected. 

With the Sher e Bengal a few minutes away, I wonder how this place has been so overly rated. 
I'm certainly not visiting this place again, bad experiences better not be repeated.
It's definitely not a value for money restaurant.

My brother threw me a congratulations party tonight at this quaint eatery.. The pujas spirit already been started we had to wait for about 25 mins to get a seat. The interiors transfer you to one of the Buddhist monasteries sans the silence.. (you really can't expect a restaurant to be silent). We ordered fresh lime soda, manchow soup, dragon chicken, crispy squid and chilli pork as starters... All were nicely made and one portion was sufficient to share among six of us. For mains we had plum pork(must try), five spice lamb, moon fan rice (which was yummy), a chicken dish and claypot rice (which was too bland for my taste). We ended up with fried ice-cream and ice-cream with brownie... Overall a pleasantly filling dinner without weighing down the pocket. This is definitely a go-to restaurant and is value for money....

Went there after a day full of post-semester 'ghoraghuri'. It was difficult to locate at first,but the gps helped. At 8.45,there was a waiting list and we got to enter at around 9.15.
The welcome was cordial,and the ambiance was a blast of a monastery bang in the heart of Kolkata. The big bells and the head of Buddha finished the look.
They serve water in goblets,which my friends fooled around with for a bit. For starters,i had the chicken satay...it was yum. The peanut sauce on it was excellent and I literally had to stop myself from licking it off the plate.
We kept the mains simple,with seven jewels fried rice and chicken in hoisin sauce.(We had originally asked for five spices lamb but the waiter informed us that it was unavailable,which did irritate me a bit).The fried rice was really good...light and fragrant. The chicken was good and complemented the fried rice. It had a note of sweetness to it.
We had a fried ice cream for dessert,and honestly speaking,it would have had an impact if the covering was hot.There was no contrast to deliver the punch.
Considering the price,I would say that the quantity borders on insufficient.
The chicken satay would make me go there again.

Availed of their Home-Delivery facility. The items that we ordered arrived approximately thirty minutes late.
The items, we tried out, were:
(1) Egg Wrapped Fried Rice (5 plates)
(2) Mixed Hakka Noodles (5 plates)
(3) Spicy Hoisin Chicken (1 plate)
(4) Hakka Chicken (1 plate)
(5) Schezwan Lamb (1 plate)
(6) Five Spice Lamb (1 plate)
The white with-lid plastic bowls, in which the items were delivered, were quite large and those five bowls of rice and noodles proved a little heavy even for the eight of us. 
The Rice had a strong aroma around it; the Noodles were neatly cooked with prawn, chicken and egg (aside from the other ingredients). 
The Hakka Chicken was a bit on the sweeter side, but the Spicy Hoisin Chicken recompensed for the sweetness of the former.
The Schezwan Lamb was tender and soft; Five Spice Lamb did justice to its name, in the true figurative sense.
Apart from the fact that some of the side dishes needed an effort greater than usual to bite through (not disclosing which ones), the overall experience is what mirrors my rating of this restaurant.

i had this restaurant in my wishlist for quite some time so when i went to gariahat for some work this week i immediately took the opportunity to try out this place. It was raining continuously so reached late i.e. around 3 pm and was quite impressed with the entrance. In spite of being a small restaurant i was mesmerized by the ambiance and did not feel uncomfortable at all. For the decorations and music i would like to give 5 out of 5. Now coming to food we ordered prawn lung fung soup, chicken Cantonese pan fried noodles and chicken wrapped prawn. The quantity is very satisfactory and one cannot complain about it and also the price in comparison with the quality and the quantity is in harmony. Lung fung soup is supposed to be bland in taste and we were warned about it before but still i wanted to try it because my palate does not believe in the fact that food can taste good only if it is prepared with a lot of spices so i likes the soup also there were ample amount of prawns in it. The cantonese noodles were ok to taste but the best item was chicken wrapped in prawn which were suggested to us by the staff and as i found it lip smacking i was sad that they only served 5 pieces. Overall my experience was pleasant, the staffs were also very polite in nature and would definitely come back to try out their other items. I would give this joint .5 more because i think this place is really cute and clean which is a very important factor.

Located near gariahat citi style it is a quaint little place which tends to get a little noisy when big groups are there. 
The servers and specially the person on the counter is very well spoken and sweet. 
We ordered for veg fried wantons , fried rice and Kung pao potato and thumps up . 
Whereas the wantons were more on the oily side and what turned me off was that it was served with red chilli sauce instead of the sweet chilli sauce, the main course was pretty good. The rice was bang on and the flavors of the Kung pao potato good as well. 
The service is pretty slow but the atmosphere makes the wait worth it. 
We paid 600 for the meal and came out pretty happy!

Buddha bites has been on the news for quite some time now.  So we thought we'd celebrate Mahalaya by trying out this new Chinese restaurant.  We don't regret the decision.  
Everything about the restaurant is appealing! The ambience was , as everyone said, like a monastery! Calmness in the air, big bells , hymns  playing in the background and buddha idols decorated the place.
Now the food! We had ordered a roast chilli pork for starters and then general tso's chicken ( the recommended dish) and singapore rice noodles. The roast chilli pork was exquisite! It was the most delectable thing I've had recently!  The chicken and noodles was just as brilliant. The chicken was a little sweet and sour with a hint of tang. 
The quantity was a lot too. One plate of noodle is good enough for three I would say!
The best thing about the restaurant would be its service.  We got the food within five minutes of ordering. Nothing beats that! 
Now the price!!! With taxes, the meal for two came to Rs. 689!!!! Yaay! ;)
The only con of the this place would be the size. Its a little cramped.  Not more than 30 people would fit in and even if they did, it would be too suffocating :/
But with all these pros I can certainly ignore that negligible con and say that this place is definitely worth your money and I am surely going back again !

Buddha bites is located on panditya road , opposite to triangular park. Getting there should not be a problem, and we found no difficulties in parking the car on all the three occasions we went there. Once inside you will be warmly greeted by large bells and wall hangings which add the Tibetan-Chinese element which are so common in restaurants nowadays that I no longer find them amusing. Although the name might suggest its a veg joint, but this place serves delicious chicken, pork and other meat dishes. Water was served in a bottle filled with basil and lime which I thought was unique. Even though the bamboo chairs were not the most comfortable, the food made up for it. Hoisin chicken and Mongolian chicken are among my favorites here, but one should try the chicken wrap prawn which is their signature dish. The staff is courteous, the ambience just perfect and the food a delight for the taste buds. Somehow I find this restaurant just perfect for dining out. The only downside might be the washroom which was small and dirty but then again the restaurant is a place for taking it in. If you don't mind the pocket pinch its a place worth revisiting. Definitely looking forward to trying the rest of the dishes.

Yes, finally after much restaurant search and days of reviewing Zomato i finally decided to pamper my tastebuds with Budhdha Bites.

Located in the bylane of Citi Style,Triangular Park it is a small but nice place with the lighting,ambience and decoration reminding you of Tibetan corners in northern states.

Well for starters we ordered Roast chilli pork(dry), their signature item on the menu , loved it , though wont term it as out of tge world.
Moon fan chicken was too good ,authentic in its flavour and so was red cook chicken, though we expected it to be bit more spicy and chilly. Sweet lime soda was also just made perfect.

We finished it off with Fried ice cream which was good but not extraordinary. Staff was cordial and cooperative. Pricing is standard.

Will again come back to try some more delicacies ..

The place makes you feel like you are in a monastery! The decor is definitely a crowd-puller for this restaurant. Situated very near City Style opposite Triangular Park, this place is hard to miss! The entire Tibetan feel adds to your enjoyment of the place. I have only been there once, that also in quite a hurry. The dishes I have tasted is quite less in number for me to make a judgement about this place. Still - The Pork Chilli Plum, Moon Fan, and General Tso Chicken did leave an impression on me. The rice dish was prepared very well, and this I must say because on various occasions, I have noticed, the noodles and rice in these newly mushrooming Chinese eateries really let me down. The chicken dish was equally nice with generous sizes of chicken. But I had a lot of hope on the Pork chilli plum which was just too sweet for my taste. 

Overall nice place with nice ambiance and moderately fast service. A Thumbs Up for BB!

BUDDHA BITES

It was the Birthday of my partner in food crime, and she made every step to make sure I would not get angry at her today although she cam half an hour late. After watching two movies back to back, we decided it was time to eat, cabbed it from jadavpur to rashbehari and  Voila here we are, I had not been to this place so this was my first time , the outsides are none too flashy simple and somber . We went in and it was a small joint with 6 tables if my memory serves me right, the décor was nice and had a touch of Buddhism about it. We sat and made ourselves comfortable, they had wine glasses for water which was a pleasant gourmet surprise, and the water they served was in a bottle which had a slice of lemon and mint leaves in it. The menu was not as vivid as say kimli, but it had a variety of meats (pork, lamb, and duck, chicken). We ordered the Moon fan chicken fried rice along with General Tsao Chicken which was the server recommended; we also ordered a Crispy chilly baby corn to add some crunch to the meal.

Coming to the food the tsao chicken was an instant hit as the gravy was utterly delicious with moist pieces of diced chicken and broccoli, the moon fan rice had large chunks of chicken which was disconcerting , anyways the server didn’t bring the Baby corn and after asking him about it , he said there has been some mistake and he was not able to register the order and that should he bring it now, normally I wouldn’t go for this but the sheer humbleness of the server moved me and we went ahead with the order, it came piping hot and it was plenty, the first bite could tell u it  was very fresh. 

The bill came at 601 bucks, which was economical; they gave us a feedback book to jot down our experience to which I obliged happily.

VERDICT- I would personally go to this place on special occasions, as it has a good vibe to it, food is nice and delicious, the USP has to be the servers who are courteous and humble and well mannered, kudos to that.

DIRECTIONS- From gariahat walk towards rashbehari or take an auto to CITY STILE, take the right and walk 1 minute it’s on the left.

Was craving for eating Chinese.. surfed Zomato for new Chinese restaurant suggestions.. Impressed by the reviews, I visited Buddha Bites for Dinner today..

Situated in right lane beside Citi Style, Rashbehari Avenue.. Look out for a red building on left hand side.. Ample parking space in the lanes nearby.. 
High on Ambience.. the minute I stepped in.. I felt like visiting a Tibetan Monastery.. such Serene it is.. On entrance.. was welcomed by a big and beautiiiful Stone head of Lord Buddha.. as entered in the restaurant..  Was amazed to see Huge Golden Bells hanging overhead.. with a Tibetan Wall Mural running across the ceiling.. Bright Red and Golden Prayer Wheels laden on both sides of the restaurant with soothing Wall Shades.. Bamboo/Cane furniture.. and a mild Tibetan Chants playing in the background added more Life into it.

Well.. alongwith Grandeur and Decor.. I personally give more priority to the Food.. ;)
 
Being a Vegetarian.. I was disappointed to find.. there were very less options for us to choose from.. Moreover, Tofu was not available, reducing some more dishes for us.. :(

Coming to the menu.. we ordered :-
Manchow Soup - It was Perfect.. thick and hot as it should be.
Dragon Roll - was average like any other spring roll.. there's room for more innovation.
Buddha Feast - I was told, it will be medium spicy.. but it was not even mild spicy.. 
Mushroom Moon Fan Rice - Average.. the mushrooms used were different from the usual ones - it was Black mushrooms..          Vegetarians prefer Button mushrooms over other mushrooms.. 
 
The Service was Quick though.. Staff is courteous too.. but needs more training.. they seemed nervous.. when asked for their suggestion.

Taste and Quality are pretty good and different as from other regular chinese we get in city.. 'Buddha Bites' is authentic Chinese food place..

They even serve Chlormints after the meals.. with a Guest book for visitors to fill in their feedback.
Pocket Pinch :- Rs. 300-350 per person.

Suggestion to the Restaurant - Please Add more Items for Vegetarian foodies like us.. :)

Recently  while looking for a Chinese restaurant where I have not tried out I saw this new place in Zomato and immediately had a dinner pickup. The place is not far off from triangular park.
Since it was a pickup , so without going into the ambiance and service, I would directly start with the food. We ordered pretty simple dishes - Hakka noodles and  Hunan chicken. The quantity was pretty good and so was the taste.
Since this was the first time, we were a bit skeptical, specially after a few bad incidents. But this one really wiped off the bad memories and created some good ones !!!
Looking forward to my next encounter with this restaurant !!!

Recommended by many...finally paid a visit last Sunday with a friend for dinner. 
Location: if you are coming from Gariahat, take right from City style mall.
Visited this place between 9.30- 9.45, it was full as expected, but we didn't had to wait for too long. Once entered staffs welcomed us with a warm smile. Ambiance of the place is really good, simple decor but neat, seating arrangements so-so. Staffs are well behaved, attentive and always wears a smile on their face. A decent place to have dinner with family.

Coming to food we ordered singapore rice noodle, roast pork chilli, hakka chicken and red cook chicken. Personally, I really enjoyed the food, satisfied my taste buds. Especially the singapore rice noodle and roast pork chilli. Food was not too spicy and oily...much to the my liking. 
The price is on a bit higher side but the food worth every penny. Will visit again for sure.

Buddha Bites the small wonder :).The name  and the decor would have been apt for Tibetan cuisine but nevamind. Location:Convenient location.Near triangular park ,bylane beside citystyle . Ambience:The place is  aesthetically decorated with buddha statues,big monastrybells,wheels and soothing lights.The ambience has a calming effect and perfect for a family dinner or  a date.The selection of  crockery or cuttlery is also classy.Service :warm and polite..Order:The items are interesting.After Invetsing a lot of time on zomato reviews we decided with Dragon chicken in starter.Moon Fan rice (chicken), Cantonese pan fired noodles(mixed) and Chilli plum fish.Food:Dragon chicken is a perfcet starter.Spicy with nuts.Moon fan rice:I never had this kind of chinese  rice anywhere.Its plain rice with a number of spices mainly star annise(as told by the waiter).This rice goes very well with any spicy dish.I liked itCantonese pan fired noodles:Comes in two sauces white and schezwan.We opted for schezwan  sauce.Mixed noodles in spicy tangy gravy.Again a thumbs up.This dsnt require a side dish.Fish in chili plum sauce:Quality of fish is good,The gravy is tasty.Another thumbs up.



Overall we were totally satisfied with all the items.Each of them had  a distinct taste.Pocket pinch:829/- for four without sweet dish.I more than happy with Buddha bites.A reaonable restaurant in a convenient locality with quality tasty food.What more  one can ask for?Surely gonna re visit with friends and family.P.S:If your are somewhere near gariahat/rashbehari or adajcent places and  craving for chinese food,Buddha bites will be the right place for you.Cheers!!

Been there last night. . Cozy little place, hardly accomodate 20 people. . .. If anybody is expecting authentic Chinese delicacy...will be highly disappointed. .tried their signature dish..found nothing extraordinary but the Broccoli. . Dragon chicken, a starter dish was too oily for a Chinese preparation. .. food was overall OK. . Very pocket friendly..

Id read great reviews abourt this place and esp with such high ratings, i wanted to give a try. But i was disappointed. May be it just wasn't my day with food. We wanted pepper fried squid and squid featured in their monsoon mania list. Still they had run out of squid. We asked for peking style duck and again met with no availability answer. Finally ordered chilli mustard chicken, checked wid d server if it was spicy specifically the chilli type spicy, as we were in mood for spicy food. What came was a mustard gravy style chicken which had only the pungent mustard feel but no chilli feel. A starter which was so gravy- ish was not expected ti be enlisted as a starter. The egg wrapped fried rice was nice. We ordered for roast chilli pork- and soecifically mentioned to the server to make it semi dry. When it came it was pork floating in a bowl full of gravy. On pointing it out, we were asked by d server whether it has to be changed, we said yes as we specifically wanted it dry. He took it away and got back a few mins later, what he did was just pour out the gravy from top. It was evident that no effort was made to dry it up, only the level of gravy in the bowl was reduced. Very sad.

The decorations in this restaurant is pretty awesome. Perfect for a dinner with family or the close ones. I visited Buddha Bites last week. Ordered a plate of chicken Hakka noodles to be taken home as I had just returned from college and was super hungry. Anyway, it was delicious. It had the perfect Chinese flavour and garnishing that most restaurants fail to put in these days.

Went there for a dinner on Sunday... with just 2 of us they told us to wait for sometime as the place at 9 15 was also packed solid... since my house in nearby and they had taken my number and we did not want to wait we headed home and chilled and then came back for a great experience....

to start of the best thing about this place is that the person who opened it could have put more tables in and got more people to sit making the place more cramped... but he did not do that and let the extra space be used for the Buddha head and other decorations which makes the place what it is....

another great thing about this place is that though they came and told us it is the last order they let us sit and eat in peace not hurrying us up at all which is something i appreciated to a great extent...

the ambiance and decor of the place is really really nice... with the bells hanging on top and the buddha head at the entrance which i HAD TO HAD TO touch... dont know why.... and the prayers rounds all over the place and the music that they play makes this place really pretty and you would want to visit it again and again...

now coming to the food... firstly let me say that i am a vegetarian and this place complicated some things for me for a simple reason that they dont have too many veg options and you have to choose from a small amount of options... 

from the soup to the starter to the main course veggie... they made the dishes with great care and it tasted just perfect... to add to that the Hakka Chow veg i need to mention cause it was so light and fluffy that it was a joy eating it....

2 things about the place which is more like requests than anything else... is to add more veg options that we can come more often and secondly is that could you put less oil in the food which would make it even more good than it already is....

This is the place for  all gourmet peoples. Close friends, comfortable ambience, alimentary foods can make a memorable day, which we got here. The décor of the place, remembering me my Sikkim trip, with the Buddha statues, chimes, bells and hymns. We started with Chicken salt and pepper and our favourite Crispy Chilli baby corn. The flavours, spices and delicacies, all were perfect to open our taste buds and make us more ravenous for the main part of our lunch. Among main course the ‘must have’ one is Mushroom Moon fan, in where  shitake mushrooms and rice are flavoured with spices and star anise, it is new definition of a rice platter. Along with there were Schezwan Chicken Fried rice, General Tso Chicken (Signature dish of the restraurant), and Five spice chicken. I would like to mention, though all the preparations were perfect, they just need do minimize the use of whole spice, red chilli.

Overall a perfect treat from a friend.

PS: Though they don’t serve any kind of tipple, but I liked the way, they use wine glass to serve water.

Recently a trend is fast catching up  in the city, i.e some new gen Chinese restaurants are mushrooming. They may be constrained by limited space, but with delectable delicacies and aptly done interior they are giving goosebumps to the foodies in town. 

Buddha Bites is one of these newbies. Perched in a small alley, this already popular food joint is serving Chinese delicacies. One thing that really cheered me up upon entering is their neatly decked up interior. Nice murals, Lord Buddha statue, well planned lighting makes the ambiance a classy one. Another thing that I really liked, is their choice of crockery. Management has done a commendable job in investing handsomely in this often neglected section. 
Coming to the food part, we ordered Mixed Haka Noodles. The Haka noodles had a nice blend of veggie, prawns, chickens and egg. All of them were cooked to utmost perfection. The prawns were especially soft and tasty. The another dish, Five spice chicken let me down quite a bit. Although it claimed to be a spicy affair, but turned out as a lame one with moderately spicy and lacked that x-factor that gives us the chance to satiate. 
Pricing is not a matter of concern neither the staff behavior. All the dishes are reasonably priced. So no complaints about it.

Although i wanted to rate it a notch below, but settled for a better one for the overall experience. This food junction in my opinion is recommended for a decent chinese dining experience, not an exceptional one.

The interior goes with the names of this place.Me and my friend went in for an early dinner but the service was late (read super late). The Squid was perfectly fried,noodle was okay. The Cantonese Roast chicken was a serious meh! It was badly burnt and served cold..My first visit was disappointing.I will think before re-visiting.

Had lunch today @Buddha Bites with my partner. Personally I’m an admirer of Tibetan Art and the way they have represented the place…love it. We ordered Dragon Chicken, Hakka Noodle and Crispy Fried Squid.  Noodle was okk, squid was nice too. But the showstopper was Dragon Chicken. Perfect. And at the end it was just for Rs.545 (tax included). Coming back soon….

I went there a week ago with a friend for dinner. Heard a lot about the place and so finally decided to go there. We reached the place around 8:50 pm. it was a very small restaurant  with a capacity of 30 people only. As it was a Saturday night so the restaurant was full. We had a to wait for about 1.5 hours to finally get a table. That was a real bugger as we were starving.The ambiance inside had a monastery look. A Buddha statue just at the entrance, big bells hung from the ceiling and small buddha idols on the side of every table. It also had prayer wheels for decoration which gave the place a really authentic look. The only thing it lacked was good music. Some Buddhist chimes were there in the background but the volume was so low that it could be hardly heard a midst all the chitter chatter. For starter we ordered Chicken Satay which was just delicious. I've never tasted such a dish, it was a very uncommon dish and it tasted really well. Then for main course we ordered Schezwan Mixed Fried rice, Cantonese Chicken Pan Fried Noodle and for side dish General Tso chicken. Fried rice was good but did not like the noodles that much. It tasted really bland and seemed that that all the ingredients were boiled and mixed without any spices. Moreover the noodle were a little under cooked. The general tso chicken was really good. It had a really unusual taste which I never had before. As it was really late and we had to return back home so we skipped the dessert instead had two glasses of thumps up. Another thing worth mentioning were the wine glasses in which water was served, it was kind of different from other restaurants. the good thing worth mentioning was that there are no VAT or service tax charged in the bill. So I would suggest that this is a good place in the budget to grab a meal. The restaurant was really easy to find too. Just a few minutes walk from City Style.

Went for Birthday dinner with family.
I received positive reviews from my friends , so decided to try this new place.
It weekday dinner ... the place is a neighborhood kind of eatery . And we 4 were the only people who came to eat out there.
Well I always like to eat silently and not in a chaos inside a restaurant. And moreover the silence was perfectly matching with the set up and ambiance. 

Ambiance : 4.5 out of 5
As the name suggests , the whole place is decorated with A big Buddha idol at the entrance and many small Buddha idols all over the place nicely decorated. The bells of the monasteries hung from the ceiling giving a beautiful fitting outlook. And a soft monastery music is played in the background.

Food : 4.5 out of 5

We ordered for 1 Chicken Wanton soup 
                                        1 plate Dragon Chicken for starters (enough for 4 people)
                                        1 Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice ( Proper amount)
                                        1 Cantonese Pan fried Mixed noodles ( in other name the gravy noodles - just enough for 3 people)
                                        1  Mongolian Chicken
                                        1 Five spice chicken
                                        1 Fried ice cream 

Cost  ... Rs. 1200  :D
Food tasted amazing . Amount of food served was just enough for full stomach for 4 people. It didn't taste like usual Chinese , but really different and nice. Just that they give red chili in everything :D
Overall , I loved this new place and hope to visit there again. Do try out this place guys.

Happy eating ! :)

Buddha bites is a cosy little place which oozes warmth and gives you the opportunity to dine on delicious Chinese.
The decor of the place is tastefully done with murals from ajanta, prayer wheels, bells and Buddha statues with soft chimes playing in the background.
We ordered dragon chicken for the starters and seven jewels rice, moon fun rice, steamed fish in oyster sauce and prawn in chilli plum sauce for the mains.
The dragon chicken was delicious with succulent chicken shreds tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce with cashews. The seven jewels rice was excellent too. The chilli plum sauce went well with the prawn and the fresh colourful bell peppers added colour and xing to the dish. Moon fun rice was decent.
The only problem we had was that the fish was too bland and was starchy. Also the size of prawns wasn't big enough.
All the dishes served had decent portions and the service was very good and prompt.
Overall an excellent place to go to for your Chinese cravings.

Last evening we 'd visited this one. It is a small but nicely decorated restaurant situated on the lane just beside City Style.I think ZOMATO team also visited that restaurant as a table was reserved by their name.Anyways we had ordered

 Pepper Chili Squid--Crispy,crunchy ,Delicious & Magical!! Squid was tasty. :)

Roast Chili pork: Good but not like the starter, I personally did not like the crispy pork with thick gravy combination very much.

Singapore Rice Noodles: Very good and tasty after adding a little salt.

The waiters were very helpful and friendly though the Roasted Chili Pork suggestion  was not good but we like their behavior. Interior decoration is very impressive specially the  Mural inspired from Ajanta bu the way FYI this restaurant does not include any type taxes extra ,that is really good . I would like to visit this one again to taste their Non-Veg Combo

A lovely place for the Chinese foodies! Great taste, quality food, and on-time service. Even the quantity of food stands out compared to others in the same genre... the only con what I felt is there is not ample space for a large group. But there is definitely ample space for parking, which is really a positive side in a crowded place like Gariahat.. n u might as well like the Buddha ambience as well!!! So just go for it...

This is the restro that I was planning to visit for quite some time and finally it was a sunday. To avoid the crowd we chose 6 30 ish. A 2 minute walk from citi style from triangular park and we reach this joint. On entering, I felt as if I was revisiting the buddha monastery in dhakuria. A buddha idol. The chakra. The bells. The glimpses of paintings from ajanta got me into the groove. However there was no good music to team up wid such lovely decor. We started off with a summer cooler drink and a sea food soup which was great to taste. Next came in the bar-bee-que pork spare ribs. This was however out of the world. A must have. Next for main course we went in for the moon fan chicken rice which was great and five spice lamb which is good but overrated.what was great was they give chloromint as the refreshment in beautiful china curios.the staffs r however rude at times. But overall. A must visit for all chino lovers.

After watching a flick at priya cinemas we headed here after reading some great reviews about this place. From the outside the place is pretty ordinary. From the inside it's nicely done. The place though small leaves u impressed by the decor and ambiance . The cutlery used is also impressive. The service is quick and nice . Coming to the order , it comprised of : 

Veg manchow soup: came in 5 mins, was not warm as it should have been
Chicken wrap prawn Szechuan    : 4 pieces of meat , well prepared and tasty 
Egg wrapped rice: simple fried rice with great presentation 
Fish chilly plum  : the fish was less spicy and more sweet . Nice for a change but I prefer spicy 
2 fresh lime soda : well prepared 
Fried ice cream: was expecting the covering to be hot. But it was not . Nevertheless well prepared . 

All this amounted to 1080 which was ok when it comes to pricing . Quantity could have been more. Taste and quality are pretty good and different from the regular Chinese we get in kolkata

First of, the location is very convenient indeed both from the accessible point of view as well as for car parking. 
The decor of the place is very much tuned to the name of the restaurant and possess a distinct monastic feel to it. 
Though we chose the wrong hour for having lunch there, as they have a severely limited menu available from 3pm to 6pm, the food served was fresh and delectable. We ordered the usual Chinese fare of Mixed Rice and a portion each of the ubiquitous Chilly Chicken and a surprisingly delightful Pepper Chicken. The quantity, I believe could do with some increment, considering the pricing but apart from that, it was definitely pleasant.

P.S. I especially liked the fact as how they use wine glasses to serve water

A surprise awaits in the lanes of Rash Behari Avenue in the form of this place. I went there a few weeks ago with my wife after hearing quite a few good things and had a pleasant surprise in terms of our overall experience.
The fare is somewhat standard but well above what many pass off as chinese these days. We ordered the Dragon Chicken, General Tao Chicken and the Spicy Black Bean Fish with a side of Hakka. The food was a bit oily but the flavours were nice. The fish and chicken were cooked beautifully although the latter a wee bit dry. The service was stellar fast and overall experience was quite pleasant in this quaint little 24 odd seater joint. The pocket pinch too was quite acceptable.
Food: 3.5 (Its really a better tasting and more satisfying versions of Flavours of China)
Service: 4 very courteous and fast
Ambiance: 3 its small and simple but the decor is quite dark and rich and makes it a little claustrophobic
Value for Money: 4.5 so needless to say I am definitely visiting it again.

I have only good things to say about this restaurant...the ambience, you suddenly feel you are in some monastery. Then comes the brilliant service, and the menu cards that are readily available at each and every table! I finally got to taste fried ice cream, and it matches my expectation! the roast pork chilli as suggested by a friend was delicious and hard to guess that its pork! and i have brought home some delicious Cantonese pan fried noodle..
I have already decided what I am going to have on my next visit, I am that much satisfied, and if you go through my previous reviews, you will well understand that I am a difficult person to satisfy.. :)

Nice place. Lovely location, kind of walking distance from Gariahat. Liked the ambience, though it is kind of strange to see Tibetan Buddhist decor with Ajanta panels. They just don't go together. They should have tried thangka like paintings in the panels. But I am being pedantic now.

The food we ordered was - Seafood Soup - a bit too bland for me - but a little soya sauce and chili in vinegar in it, and it was just right, the Cantonese Pan-Fried Chicken Noodles - was really good, it had lots of veggies in it, and with the Five Spice Lamb - it was absolutely spot on.

The service is good, but it did hurry us a bit. Service should be around but should never come and ask you for the order directly.

But altogether - it's great authentic chinese, good ambience, good service at a very affordable price.

Pathetic food quality..ordered first time today and hygiene was pathetic. On chicken fried rice a piece of hair was given free and on a egg rap fried rice a small stone (kakad) was given free................this was quite a long time back but now in 2015 July , the food quality quantity is really very good . As mentioned in Zomato that there is a discount on certain amounts , ironically i have not received the discount ,otherwise the. food is really very good and tasty.

First time i have actually waited for a 35 mins outside a rest. Must say i came in at around 10.35 PM waited for a good 30 to 35 mins. cause i really wanted to try this place out because of the reviews. 
Coming to the order. 
 
Starterts 
Chicken satay - Amazing 5 out of 5.
Chilli roast pork as suggested by the streward - 3.5 out of 5

Maincourse
Egg wrapped fried rice - 2.5 out of 5 not at all upto the mark.
We tried the moon fan rice as it had garnishing after the fried rice was cooked. 2 out of 5 TOO MUCH OIL.
 
Side dish
Hongkong Fish - 3 out of 5.

To sum it all up.

3 out of 5.
Only reason i would be going back there is for the Chicken Satay and maybe try something else out .

All the best to the team for their business.

Buddha Bites - Excellent "Quality and Hygienic Chinese Food" at quite AFFORDABLE prices. 
======================================================================================
Intro: 

As per the Zomato's Advertisements on Buddha bites and on the good ratings given by my fellow foodies, i planned to visit this place with one of my friend. Well, at the beginning, it was quite difficult for me to locate this place but sooner, i did it. To be more precise, this place is located when you take the left from Citi Style, which comes in the way when heading from Desho Priya park towards Gariahat (After crossing Hatari). As i went during the afternoon, they had a separate menu for the afternoon brunch. Nevertheless, on demanding for main course, it was quite a good gesture from the owners part to help us enjoy the main course by serving us the same. This place had been located after you walk 2-3 minutes from Citi style. As i entered this place, it gave me a feeling of buddhist monastery with statue of buddha, bell decorations on the ceiling and the rolling thing which we see in many buddhist monastery. 
======================================================================================
Food:

We ordered:-

1) Vegetable Fried Rice - It was perfectly boiled and later, tossed in the wok with appropriate amount of vegetables. It tasted really superb and fresh.

2) Vegetable Feast(Not there in the afternoon menu) - This was the side gravy dish. It had comprised of all kinds of healthy vegetables including broccoli, Tofu and mushrooms. I really enjoyed this Feast as it was not like the usual vegetable manchurian which i have everywhere. 
======================================================================================
Meal for Two: 500-700 max
======================================================================================
Pros:

1) Nice decor/ambience.
2) Even after being small, it does not make you feel cramped up.
3) Courteous Staffs. 
4) Quite Prompt with service. 
5) Reasonably priced.
6) Quality and healthy food.

Cons:
1) Might cause chaos if overcrowded. 
2) Lacks Soft music.
======================================================================================
Summary:

Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4/5
Taste 4/5
Value for money 5/5
Hospitality 3.5/5
Ambience 4.5/5 
======================================================================================
Conclusion:

It is highly recommended for two people that just go with one main course and one side dish and it would be enough. The food from this place did not upset my stomach and for this reason, it created a remarkable value for me. :)

Small, simple and a very comfortable place with great food at decent prices!!!

Located couple of bldgs after you enter panditia road from rash behari avenue, its a small restaurant with an elaborate decor. Though i like the decor on lighter side, this place seemed pretty colourful and nice. The seats are a bit uncomfortable. The staff are polite, warm and fast.

They serve chinese food but menu has some distinct offerings apart from the routine menu found everywhere in almost all sections. The serving size is decent and prices decent but pretty value for money. The hakka beans tasted lovely and is highly recommended from my side. The tossed tofu could be better with smaller pieces of tofu. The manchow soup was very nice but helping of fried noodles alongside should be increased though it was refilled later at our request.

Sad not to have tried the main course, but really looking forward to it !!!

Food not up to the mark, veggies under cooked, tastes weird. There is nothing Chinese about the food.
I think the food needs serious check.
Apart from the food hospitality is appreciable, ambiance is good.

Decided to drop in for lunch on a rainy weekday. Reached the place in quick time. It was about 1PM and the restaurant was empty so the two of us just picked a table.

I think enough has been written about the decor - you are indeed greeted by a Buddha and you get a feel of a Buddhist dining room with bells hung around from the ceiling and the Buddha in various postures across the walls. Its a 30 seater restaurant and the chairs and tables are of bamboo base which adds to the feel. A buddhist chant plays across the restaurant. I also quite liked the decorative jugs in which they serve water!

For starters ordered one chicken hot and sour soup to be split among the two of us and a plate of chicken satay. The soup was served to us in less than ten minutes. it had generous portions of chicken and was thick. The satay had six pieces of chicken. What made the satay so tasty was the right mix of peanut butter sauce. The sticks had thick pieces of chicken and it tasted just like the way a satay should be - slightly sweet. Want to thank Rukshana Kapadia for her suggestion. 

For mains we ordered a plate of Moon Fan Rice and Five Spice Lamb. The Moon Fan Rice was recommended by the waiter as he said it had a slightly different preparation. First the fried rice is made and some seasoning is added. It isn't that bad to be very honest. The Five Spice lamb was nothing extraordinary - it was simply dollops of lamb cooked in brown sauce with pepper sprinklings. It tasted pretty good as it was served burning hot - I added some soya sauce and it tasted even better! The quality of lamb was magnificent. The quantity of the rice as well as the lamb was sufficient for the two of us, and when I say sufficient I mean it because we are pretty heavy eaters :P

For deserts ordered a plate of brownie with ice cream and fried ice cream. The brownie/ice cream thing was awesome according to my friend and the fried ice cream as the name suggests was very interesting. It was a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was very carefully put in a thick layer of pudding mix if I am not mistaken and microwaved. The ice cream inside did not melt a bit before I started digging into it and the crumb was warm. It was garnished with chocolate sauce. Not a bad thing to try.

What touched me was this is a nice place where they have gone that extra mile to innovate a few dishes. And I must end by saying that the satay was amazing. The staff was hospitable although the guy who was serving me had very basic knowledge about the dishes they serve. Overall good experience and I will come back for their satay!

Buddha Bites is a relatively new Chinese restaurant located in Panditia road which is in a lane from Rash behari avenue.I had gone there for a family dinner last week.

The place though on the smaller side with about 7-8 table seating capacity has a nice and soothing feel about it.The statue of Lord Buddha which greets you immediately on entering,the soothing Tibetan theme and the soft relaxing music in the background all taken together result in a very peaceful overall ambience.

Now coming to the most important thing that is the food.We ordered a Chicken Satay ( based on Rukshana's recommendations!) and a Chicken wrapped prawn schewzan style for starters.The chicken wrapped prawns was recommended by the staff and it was truly worth recommending.The soft succulent prawns wrapped in chicken were impeccably cooked and the slightly but not overtly spicy schezwan style went brilliantly with it.The chicken satay was also wonderful.As described already by Rukshana in her review,they spread the peanut butter sauce over the chicken in their version of the satay which though atypical tasted beautiful.The chicken was well cooked and the peanut butter sauce was just perfect.We really enjoyed the two starters.
Our main course consisted of Mixed Meifoon,mixed cantonese noodles,prawn in chili oyster sauce and general tso chicken.The Mixed meifoon was good.I found the cantonese noodles okay but it was a bit too bland for my parents liking.The prawns in chili oyster sauce was also pretty good with the size of the 6 pieces of prawn deserving special appreciation.The General Tso chicken which was again recommended to us by the staff was tasty but we all found it a tad too salty.The brocolli in it was also a bit under cooked.Though the main course could not fully live up to the high standards and expectations created by the starters overall we liked the taste of the food and were satisfied.
The desserts menu is slightly limited.We had a Season's special vanilla with fresh mango ice cream.There is nothing much to say about it.It was just as you would expect it to be judging by the name.My sister had a Triple layered mousse which according to her was also very good.

The service was pretty swift.Everyone was very helpful.Another person who seemed to be the manager was very attentive towards all the guests.The pricing is very very reasonable.There is no extra vat charged even.

Overall this is a place with lots of potential which satisfied us and can actually get even better.

After procrastinating for weeks on end, yesterday I went to Buddha Bites. I had read some rave reviews about the place, so wanted to go, and I was not disappointed. I am a faithful fan of indo-chinese food, and my favoritest place is Kim Lee, in Kolkata. Now I have to admit that this place is quite quite close as far as quality and taste go, only the menu is more succinct.
So basically I was saying that the food made me happy, though we did not order much. Let me chart out the entire experience here...
For starters, its not too tough to locate, sitting snugly on the lane that is right beside Gariahat Citistyle store. The door is a tad too tight and narrow to let people with generous proportions in. Ahem. But once you get in, the ambience is pleasant and welcoming. The big Buddha head is cute, so are the prayers wheels and bells, a bit cluttered and red like all Chinese joints, but very very warm and friendly. And wait, did I mention the soft Buddhist chants that played in the background. They were faint and nice, just right for the ears. And the tableware is really nice too. Very few places boast of nice tableware, so I was mighty impressed!
Now we ordered Chilly Pepper Prawn for starter. It was any regular dry chilly kind of preparation, but the prawns were mighty big I thought, and they were 6 pieces a plate - nice indeed. And there was right dosage of black pepper thrown in, which was noteworthy.
I wanted to order duck, but they said it was seasonal. My desire to try Peking Duck in Kolkata remains unfulfilled...sigh. So we ordered mixed hakka noodles and lamb in a black bean curry - they were pretty damn nice. The kind I like, thick soft chewy noodles, with a generous helping of meat and prawns and egg thrown in. The black bean sauce was nice too, and the lamb done just right, medium sized shreds, tender yet chewy, striated, and soaked in the correct consistency of gravy. Nice! 
Now portion size was pretty large too, one plate is more than enough for two moderate eaters. So I could not order more, but I am coming back for the chicken in Hoisin Sauce, the duck (seasonal or whateva), and the pork in cherry plum sauce, with the moon fan. I gave the dessert a pass. 
So to sum up, I had a great Sunday lunch. Quality. Check. Taste.Check. Quantity.Check. Pricing.Check. Service.Check. The only dampener was the card swiper, which just would not budge, so had to shell out some cash (I am a plastic money person). So I would highly recommend this place to people who like chinese, or pan-asian food, with a calcutta touch to it.
Cheers!

Loved the theme of the restaurant.
The food was excellent too.
Went there on a rainy day.It was empty when we stepped in...but by the time we left the place was full.
The number of seats is six or seven.So if you wanna go for dinner..  Go early
Coming the food...it is reasonably priced
We ordered chicken satay as was recommended by a friend.
Then for the main course the schezwan rice and the roast chilly pork were prefect
The quantity is a bit lesser than expected...however the quality makes up for it...
Would love to visit again...

Just visited this restaurant yesterday with my elder sister and her friend hoping that it will be good and man they didnt disappoint us.
Now coming to the place.
Firstly its a really good place for a perfect lunch. The ambience was decent and bright , not too dark which I personally dont like. Secondly the food here is amazing. We ordered for chicken wrapped in prawn and it was really good. The prawn was fresh and really soft and a bit sweet too. Then we ordered for an egg wrapped fried rice and mongolian chicken and it was delicious. 
Just one disappointment
The waiters there need to learn how to handle a spoon properly ( the waiter dropped one full spoon of rice on the table while serving).
All in all a really good place. Delicious chinese. Must visit.

After reading lots of good reviews i decided to try their food, so while going to priya cinema i placed order there and told them that i will pick up the items after 2 hrs and when i went there to pick up the food after 2 hrs30 mins to my surprise it was not ready yet!! I had to wait for another 15 mins to get it, this made me little angry but this is the only negative point of my venture to buddha bites, food items were excellent.. I ordered seven jewel fried rice, mixed fried rice, fish chilly plum, five spice chicken and prawn pepper salt..seven jewel rice was veg fried rice with seven types of veggies,mixed fried rice though contained very little amount of chicken and prawns but still taste wise they were very good.. fish chilly plum was excellent, i thought it would be really spicy but on the contrary it turned out to be on the sweeter side,had 6 big soft succulent pieces of fish, prawn pepper salt was good too, had 6 big prawns, good item for starter, five spice chicken was very spicy and had a wonderful aroma which we dont find in normal chinese foods.. we were really satisfied by the food there.. As it is a small 32 seater restaurant so in peak times it may be difficult to get seat, when i went there to pick up my food it was 9.30 pm and restaurant was totally filled up and people were standing to get in so either take away or table reservation will be recommended if anyone wants to go there on weekends peak hours....

Location: At the left dogleg of the lane adjacent to Citi Style, Triangular park, Gariahat.

This place was on my wishlist for quite some days now on the basis of the reviews it got.
Got a chance to try the food out, had opted for a home delivery and the line up was as follows:

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn
The babycorn was burnt!!
It looked as if they were overfried.
Tasteless. Lacked flavor.
Disgusted on how could they even deliver it !

- Buddha Feast
Juicy veggies tossed in a mild sauce!
Was delectable. Authentic dish.

- Veg Hakka Noodles
Noodles were boiled perfectly, veggies were juicy, but the preparation was substantially oily!
I could soak a tissue of oil out of it.
:-\

The staff over the call was polite but, the service was way too slow. Three calls post-order and the food got delivered.

Prices didn't seem too pocket friendly with respect to the quality served.

Overall a below-average experience. :-(
Two stars from me. 0.5 extra just for the Buddha feast.
- I suppose, was a bad day for me, would visit someday to be able to put a foot down for my experience.

Being immensely impressed by the reviews, I visited Buddha Bites for lunch today! 

Situated on the lane right beside Citi Style, Buddha Bites welcomes you with its classy decor and beautiful Buddha! A small place indeed but they have tried their best to serve to the better than the best of their abilities. Buddhist chants kept on playing which added to the amazing ambiance of this place. There was also a very cute small statue of Buddha beside our table with a semi fountain attached to it.

For starters we ordered Chicken Satay (being influenced by Rulshana Kapadia's review) and it was very well made. The peanut sauce was as good as it can get. They served it with immense perfection to our plates and the service was very VERY polite!
For main course we ordered mixed hakka noodles and roast pork chilli. To be very honest, I think the proportions of chicken and prawns in the hakka noodles were a little too less. However, the roast pork chilli was again, a BANG ON dish with just perfect amount of spices and sauces. The pork was correctly roasted and was not too fleshy!

For dessert we had brownie with ice cream (I think that was summer special?) which was not otherwise mentioned on the menu card but on a side note on the table. The brownie had perfect amount of chocolate sauce but a little low on quantity. However, the quantity of the main course is on the higher side.

We were very pleased with our meal. They have kept the price of chicken/veg/mixed noodles and chicken/veg/mixed fried rice same for some reason. I had no complains though

They even serve chlormints after their meal when they very sweetly bring the guest book to you for review. When the bill came, I even noticed that the prices are inclusive of all taxes and no VAT is charged. I could not be more pleased with such a pretty, calm and nice place in this hot summer! A must visit :)

When I walked upto the restaurant I was really skeptical on how it would be taking into consideration its small entrance and stuff but I was pleasently surprised once I entered. Great ambience and it takes you into a complete Buddhist feel as soon as u enter. The music too complements the same perfectly.

We ordered Chicken Sui Mui and Dragon Chicken and both of them were fairly good. Since we had visited around 5pm it was just appetizers that we tried but definately a good experience to go back for a complete meal. It isnt too heavy on the pocket as well, so someone looking for a different eating experience would definately recommend Buddha Bites.

I went to this place based off the multiple positive reviews here. I'd say this is a slightly above average Indianised Chinese restaurant. Prices are fairly low and portions are very generous. Honestly you get what you pay for so don't go in here expecting authentic Chinese food or some sort of boutique fare. If you're a big eater and don't mind vast amounts of thick cornflower gravy in everything and strongly value the budget rates, maybe this would be a good choice.

The Buddhist theme of the restaurant was charming and the ambient music was nice.

What we ordered: 

Lung Fung soup: not bad, but they went overboard with the cornflower (making it far too thick) and there was very little meat/prawn.

Chicken Satay: this was actually quite good, although it probably should have had a lot more peanut sauce.

Pork with plum sauce: This was by far the best dish we had, the pork was great with just the right amount of fat (just a thin strip). The gravy had a nice sweet but light flavor.

Lamb in 5 spices: The meat was just okay but not particularly impressive. Far too thick and far too much gravy.

Clay pot rice/Singapore rice noodles: no complaints, they were both more than good enough for the price.

TLDR decent budget Indian Chinese offering in S.Kolkata

Serving authentic chinese at a very minimal price. The interiors impressed me a lot. An astonishing statue of Buddha greets you, the prayer wheels and the chants of the monk just add on to make it a perfect environment. We tried Moonfan Rice and Five Spice Chicken and I must say I was pretty impressed. I have spend thrice more and have never been satisfied with such taste. The service was pretty quick. Hope they keep up the good work. Buddha Bites has been added to my list of favorite restaurants here in Kolkata.

Buddha Bites impressed me. Though I am supposed to be the foremost foodie in the family its actually my parents who discovered it while I was away in Delhi and excitedly told me about it. The day I landed from Delhi I headed there for dinner with my folks and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. The minute you step in your welcomed by a beautiful serene stone head of The Buddha ..... a few steps in you are greeted by a whole bunch of beautiful Buddhist prayer bells hanging overhead with a Tibetan mural running across the top. There are lovely red and gold prayer wheels on both sides of the restaurant which just adds to the tasteful ambiance. However this foodie judges a restaurant not on decor but on food so we ordered. We started out with the Chicken Satay and it was excellent. One of the best Satay's I have had in Kolkata and usually a satay is served with Peanut Sauce on the side. Here however they poured the sauce over the Satay which just made it juicier and tastier and the sauce itself had a fantastic zing to it that just lifted the entire dish. Thereafter we ordered Mixed Fried Rice , Chicken Hakka Noodles and Sliced Pork in Chilli Plum Sauce. Both the Rice and Noodles were very good as was the Pork. We had requested for our pork to be of a lean cut but when the dish arrived it was on the fattier side ... as soon as we called the manager who is extremely kind and obliging it was whisked away and a fresh one prepared and delivered quickly. Portions are very good and I only wish I had had the appetite to try more stuff. Can't wait to go back and I see myself ordering often from here. 
The only negative is that the waiters are not too well informed and need a bit of training and I would request the Management to look into this aspect. However considering that its a small restaurant with just 8-9 tables both the food quality and decor not to mention competitive pricing make this a great dining option. Recommended to all those who enjoy good Chinese Food.

I was quite excited about this new restaurant in my own neighborhood so one fine night i decided to order food from this place...the menu looked nice and therefore made the order of one pork dish one chicken dish and rice. The order was delivered within 40mins. Tired as i was after the hectic office day.. i sit down for dinner and see to my surprise that i was given rice and omlette. I rang them up but by then they had shut down for the day. However the manager came back took back the order and refunded. The owner was sincerely apologetic and she did go beyond her way and had sent food the next day without charging me. I was very touched by their gestures and decided to give it another try... this time i kept my order simple chili chicken and mixed sanghai rice..... yet again i was disappointed, cause completely different order was delivered. I lost it completely....again i had to call the management and inform them... I really wish the management takes this issue of delivering the order seriously. It only reflects how efficient you are from day one and it builds your good will.
Foodwise, the chili mustard chicken that was wrongly served didnt quite hit the spot for me.... however quite liked their five spice pork.

I went there yesterday for the first time and it was a mindblowing experience for me. The ambience inside is very good. Mild tibetan music is always playing which adds an aesthetic to the ambience. The menu is good. You will get everything starting from chicken, pork, lamb, fish, prawn, squids to a variety of veg dishes. The behaviour of the waiter is very good. They first ask your taste, your preferences and then they will suggest what is good for  you. The items are a bit out of track, not the age old traditional dishes that you get in any other chinese restaurant. Lastly for the desert the fried ice cream us awesome. I will definitely visit the place again.

The best thing about this brand new place is everything they use, is fresh and cooked hot. That is why they can cater, only  to limited number of customers, but everything is made fresh. They don't keep semi finished food. Many  restaurants does that to cater their huge number of customers. Unlike others, their motto is to serve really  fresh hot quality food to limited number of people, they can accommodate. So if you are a quality lover and looking for freshly cooked Chinese food, be there. It is not a fast food Chinese restaurant. You can have there meal everyday  without getting sick.

I have been to this place a couple of times. The first time I went was in April 2014. What struck my eyes was the way a compact place was so beautifully decorated with handpicked items. 10/10 for the interior,decor and utilization of space.
One problem I faced both the times I visited was the lack of a table for 6 or 8. All are 4 seaters. 
Coming to the food now......
I took pan fried fish for starters. i was awesome. The flavours of the ingredients really came out really well. Fish was soft. I can't wait to try that again. Salt & Pepper chicken was good as well. I liked the fish more.
Tangy flavour of Kung Pao Chicken was great. 
Hongkong Fish was great as well. I love the gravy. Mentioning again fish was soft,melts in the mouth.
Both the side dishes went well with helpings of Fried Rice and Noodles. 
---------------------
Now the palace gets really crowded. Yesterday (11/05/2014),I went at 9pm. I didn't get a place :( .Nevermind.
Keep up the good work. 
Let your DELICIOUS  food come out of the kitchen always.

Buddha Bites!!! The last bit was definitely true... And how!! We called for a reservation one late Sunday afternoon.. But still had to wait 10 mins as they had not managed to clean a table for us! After we placed our order we were told that the food would take 30 mins to arrive. Though a bit surprised and already very hungry we were ok with that... The half hour came and went then another 15 mins.. We asked for some peanuts as I had a splitting headache by then brought on by hunger pangs ( my mistake in having a very light breakfast)... But our request was just ignored!!! Then it was an hour and 15 mins since we had placed our order ... At that point we walked out!! Oh boy!! What an ordeal!! 
Once " Bitten" twice shy..... That's for sure!!

Very bad restaurant. The manager Lama very unethical guy. He made us wait with my grandmother with me for 30 mins and gave seating to other people who came after us to sit. 

The serving bowls are plastic which are very ugly looking. Staff does not understand what you ask. Lama will go inside the kitchen and not come out where as manager has to be there on the floors. Service is poor and takes lot of time. They took 45 min to serve food. Unable to handle the crowd. Food is okay nothing exceptional. Kolkata has much better to offer.

Never ever again !!!
The food was not upto any standards . This is only like roadside stalls with good air conditioned interiors . The place is done nicely . But that is where the the good part ends . The chairs are so uncomfortable that  back hurts after some time.we ordered hot and sour veg soup which was tasteless and not at all hot or spicy 
 Then arrived the dragon  fried roll which was  okay . The veg fried rice and Hakka chow we ordered was nothing to talk about  nor was the fried ice cream good .  
The service was extremely unorganised and the waiter could not take orders  if spoken in English  . On completion of our meal there was a long waiting for the bill to arrive   
May be this place is doing good as there was a queue of people waiting outside ,however I would not recommend any one to be  here and it will also prevent back ache caused by the awful seating !!

Visited this new restaurant a few days back while battling the hunger pangs and searching for a quick chinese option. Had heard about it recently, and heard good things too.

The place is small, however the decor is very pleasing. The seating isn't the most comfortable, but one can manage, with the right company.

We started with Prawn Manchow Soup along with Crispy Chilli baby Corn for starters. Followed it up with Veg Schezwan Fried Rice and Fish in Spicy Black Bean sauce. While the soup was just about okay, the Baby corn as well as the fried rice were very good. But even better was the fish. Very unique flavor, and the fish that they used was of a good quality which impressed me.

Prices are very competitive. All of the above plus a cola cost me Rs. 680/- which is quite a bargain when I consider the quality they offer. Highly recommended. Would love to go back sometime soon.

Went there today evening for a quick dinner. 
Had sweet corn soup which was served pretty quickly , and it tasted good. The chicken was soft and tender.

Wanted something light, so had Steamed rice (known as clay pot something over there), and with a chicken gravy item...price was around 556 bucks, which was decent enough.

the resto decor was damm interesting, and it was like a mini tibet there. Had a quick chat with manager , and he was cordial enough as well.

Overall, a very nice experience. Seems i need to go back there with my wife (who loves chinese more than me!).

On the corner of the lane just beside triangular park citi style. U will feel in sikkim while u enter this restaurant.  Staff is attaentive. Price is ok as per wat they deliver. We ordered for hoisin chicken, singapore rice noodles & Fried ice cream. The chicken hoisin was perfect taste but the chicken was hard and the rice noodles was not at all singaporean. The fried icecream was delicious by looks but diapointment in taste. Problem with it was it had a thick bread coating and not tender. Which I even mentioned it in the guest book. After u leave u u will get a nice sms in ur mobile inviting you again.
According to other reviews I feel I have to try pork items next time.

I loved my experience at Buddha Bites and I adored the food!  We ordered Roast Chilli Pork to start with and Pan Fried Fish. Both were tasty enough to make us order some more delicacies ! For the main course, it was the time for us to delve into the Mixed Rice, Mongolian Chicken, Schezwan Fish & Slice Lamb in Green & Red Pepper ! Each one of them were finger licking tasty ! The service was superb as well. Looking forward to another visit. :)

Went there on the opening day with a small group of friends. The ambiance was really nice and the tables were neatly set up. The food was really nice. Specially the starters i.e. Roasted chilli pork and chicken in hoisin sauce. Took rice and lamb for main course which were equally good. Service was top notch as well. 
As for price, it costs about 400 per head with tax. Which is quite reasonable nowadays.
This place is situated where "charbak" used to be. Pork dishes are recommended. I am keen on visiting it once again for a good meal. Thumbs up.

Went for dinner with my family on 19/04/14. Ambience was nice. Quality of the food was excellent. Requested them to maintain the quality of the food. Service was OK. Quantity in terms of price is bit high, otherwise overall it is a good place for family dining.

Had lunch in this nice cozy restaurant.

Pork was delicious, tried fried noodles for the first time and the taste was amazing.

Loved the service and also met the chef who seems to be passionate about cooking and ensuring that he collected feedback.

They encouraged us to give critical feedback so that they can improve.

Ambiance -  Lighting was just perfect

Would recommend this to all people who visit Kolkata

Satisfying bowl of chinese food prepared with exotic vegetables & other ingredients, mix with special herbs to give you the authentic taste. The ambience is extraordinary for enjoying smooth & tender chicken with rice, noodles & soup. Really worth the visit.

Went to the place on poila boisakh with my colleagues but not quite happy with the service as it was quite slow. Had to wait around 45 mins for the order. The price was a little bit steep but the portions were comparatively small.
