The momos were divine. I would especially recommend the accompanying sauce. Mohan was very sweet, but the shop is small, and can be a little occupied. But full marks !

Location : Thau Thau is located near the Salt Lake school in BA block. It's not difficult to locate once you enter from the main road leading to CA block.

Food : I've tasted most of their food as it's closer to my place. They've mainly Chinese on their menu. I personally like their Chilli Chicken , Garlic Chicken , Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Fried Rice , Mixed Noodles and Momos. The food is good better than most small food joints. The portions they serve is a lot of one person. Even if you order half plate Chilli Chicken they give you five pieces. The gravy is a little spicy for people who don't like the fiery taste so it's better you tell them to adjust the spices. Some food items can be a bit bland and lack taste but most of the items taste good. It's obviously on the lower side of the pocket. So if you're really hungry and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket you can give this place a try.

Ambience- Mostly college goers and school students visit this place .

PS - The only drawback of this place is the seating arrangements. It's too small. It can hardly accommodate 15 people at a time . The service can be slow at times. I would suggest to do the interior with funky decors and walls. Overall a nice place to visit.

Though a streetside kind of food joint, the place has some awesome Chinese food. The momos are something to die for. If they can make their seating a little better things could be different. Food tastes just yum!

Located opposite to Hariyana Vidya Mandir in Salt Lake, it is a small food joint. The price of food is very less and they have the option of half plate which is an advantage.
I went there once and ordered mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. The quantity was good but taste was just okay.

while we were staying in Kolkata, we were on the lookout for some some good local Chinese food. we found it at Thau Thau. Located in a quiet residential area in Salt Lake City, it has some cheap, great and heartwarming food. The fried momos were legendary and the chilly chicken and fish was yummy. You will get the best fried rice here. Only drawback is that there are just two people, one taking orders and one cooking and it is impossible to sit and eat there because of the smoke. But hey if you a cheapo like me who loves food, do try this place.

Located in the road of BA block, called them up fir home delivery but found them to be super proud. Because they demanded an order of 400 rupees as the minimum amount to deliver food next door! Not taking offence i decided to try their food but to be disappointed further!! The noodles, that is the only dish we took was overtly fried and oily.

Thau thau is a pocket friendly place that serves you saporific food, and leaves you licking your fingers. Located just opposite Haryana school, it is a small outlet that serves one of the best chinese foods in the city. Its pan fried momos and fried rice  are a must have. Even the noodles are great. However, the only little drawback of this place is that it lacks a good seating arrangement and hence is suitable for takeaway. The place is really good and the food's worth eating.

An affordable road side food joint option in Salt Lake. Loved their Noodles and Momos. The Momos especially were juicy and succulent. The fillings were sufficient.

Very cool para Chinese food - light homeliness with a street-food-ish twist...very very pocket friendly - try their gravy chow, thukpa, dumplings and dry chilly chicken. But be ready to combat a long queue of order.
