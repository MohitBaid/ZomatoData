Good and simple place for veggie lovers in a very known and good place of Alipur. Lane Just opposite Gupta brothers. The lane near the Renault showroom. They even serve you Jain food on request. Simply made like a home/flat. Not much of jazzy decor. Good food. Good service. Clean and tidy. We loved the dal and soup. The paneer sabji was also amazing. Can be tried if you want an option in vegetarian.

I have been there for lunch. It's a really amazing place. The food is simply tremendous. Dragon roll, American corn, and gratin were too good. Cookies and cream and strawberry ice cream are the best. Appetizing smell of dal makhni and Kashmiri aloo are lekker. Quick service üëç

Went there for dinner with Family yesterday. The place is a bit congested as referred to entrance. The Resturant is spaced out evenly.

The staff was courteous and helped us in ordering the food. The starters were nice, however the Paneer Malai Tikka was too small as serving portion.

The Majn course was also comparatively Ok but the main disappointment were the Breads. Both the Masala Kulcha and Garlic Naan were very hard and rubbery and also very thin. The Kulcha was not the price as it did not have any stuffing only.

The staff were open to suggestions.

Finally it is a bit overpriced as regards to Helping portion and food standard.

Located opposite Gupta brothers,New alipore.
A new place for veggie lovers!
Starting with the starters. We ordered for a platter, which I felt was very small and not upto the mark. I just liked the Tandoori aloo which was amazing.
Now coming to the main course. Ordered for a Dal Makhani, Aloo Do piyaza & Paneer butter masala.
All the three main courses tasted amazing. And even the breads are very perfectly baked.
The only problem with the food is their quantity which is too less for 3-4 persons. Maximum 2 persons can share one portion main course.
The Dal Makhani, Paneer butter masala & Tandoori aloo is a recommendation for all!

Location-5/5
Ambience- 3/5
Food quality-4.5/5

Fantastic quality and good value for money in upscale New Alipore means we can go there very often. New alipore residents have been starved of decent eateries for very long. ¬†Ask for the daily meals menu, they provide good variation and combination for ordering for office!

Amazing food. Specially loved jhaal farezi and paneer pasanda. Just that malai kofta was sweeter than usual. But overall good ambience, quick service, and courteous staff. Nice to have such a fresh and reasonable restaurant near home to treat my taste buds . üòÑ

Went to this place as a spur of the moment decision last night with my wife and daughter. Homely atmosphere that is very welcoming, service was a little slow but that could be due to the place is new. Food was very good. Ordered the tandoori platter and every item on it was delicious. Main course consisted of rice, naan, yellow dal, jeera aalu & an interesting mix veg with papad which was so delicious it was polished off totally. Food portions are generous and the entire bill was for 900 or so. Definitely pocket friendly, pure veg and family friendly. Will definitely add it to my list of regular places. Keep it up

I've been here for lunch. It was simply amazing and pocket friendly. I liked the dragon roll, crispy chilly baby corn, hakka noodles, and sabzi's like dal makhani, paneer butter masala. Must try- hazelnut & berri berri icecream. The best part is the private area for small parties üòç

I've been here for lunch and dinner. The food, ambience, decor is just average. I liked their dal makhani, baan, babycorn, Haka noodles. 
The Kadai paneer wasn't made properly. The fried rice had a raw smell of rice to it. The fillings of Masala kulcha didn't have the North Indian taste and the mirchi pyaz kulcha didn't have onions and it was bland. The lacha paratha had a bland taste too. 

It's a good place for a quick and pocket friendly lunch. The serving size of the Haka noodles wasn't even sufficient for two people but the quantity of the other dishes was alright. 

There is a separate seating arrangement for kitty parties and bday parties for 15-20 people.
