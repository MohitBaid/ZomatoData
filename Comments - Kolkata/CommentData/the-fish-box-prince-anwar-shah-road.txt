Decent place serving a range of fish delicacies in a cheap price. I have tried the fish box meal and chelo kebab platter. Both were quite good. The chelo kebab can be called the Bengali version of the original Iranian dish and as for the fish box meal it comes a full circle. A complete deal with pulao, fish vindaloo and fish delicacies.

The Fish Box.. Finally a place where you can satisfy your fish cravings.. With a variety of different fish options available this is a place you need to visit.. If fish is not what you crave for, you also have chicken and pork alternatives.. Their meal boxes offer the best bang for your buck..

If you want authentic prawn,  chicken and pork vindaloo, pork sausages and  this is the place to be. No where in kolkata will you get these dishes and made so well. The meal box menu is very different from what you get in other places. A must for people with a taste for good food.
