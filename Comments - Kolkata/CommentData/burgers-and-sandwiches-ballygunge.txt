Their grilled sandwiches , french fries and club sandwich are splendid. But the burgers are not upto the mark. And considering the huge quantity served, it's one of the best places for sandwich and french fry lovers.

Just got food home delivered and I've just one word to say... Awesome! I ordered for a chicken burger and ham club sandwich. Both were humongous.and very filling. The burger came with fries, the patty was juicy, the bun soft and the sauces, onions were perfect. The sandwich was also very well done. All in all a value for money joint ðŸ‘Œ

Good food good life.. Being a start-up and not having a very big capital to start off with;this sandwich maker will not compromise on quality and also will offer you a reasonable rate which will not pinch your pocket.
I ordered one chicken sandwich lastday and WOW I loved it.One sandwich was sufficient for my wife and myself.
I would surely recommend this sandwich joint to people who are willing to have some good sandwiches and suggest the outlet owner to continue making good customer base with the contunie producing quality above market standards.

Good quality sandwiches at affordable prices... You can customise your sandwich... But location is very hard to find,they do not have any sitting arrangement but do take in a lot of orders... They also serve vegetarian sandwich & starter.
