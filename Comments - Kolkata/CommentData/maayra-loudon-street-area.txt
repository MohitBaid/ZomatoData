One of the best places for sweets! A must go. Prices are nominal and complete value for money. The staff is very polite and the service is phenomenal.

Nice Place, great food (only sweets and  samosas available) they plan to start snacks soon, service is good but it seems that being new the staff is confused, the worst part is no wash basin available even to wash ur hands, seems some time needed before the teething problems are taken care of,

the greatest positive being the food quality - no doubt "Munnas" the name speaks for itself. 

I have always been the fan be it organising parties at Marwar or the camac street outlet in the past - so no qualms about the food

pocket pinch is on the higher side almost double if one compares to "Tiwari"
