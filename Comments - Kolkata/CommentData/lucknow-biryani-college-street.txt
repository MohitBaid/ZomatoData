Lucknow Biryani in College Street is just beside Kalika on Surya Sen Street. I have been here twice. Biryani are average. Once I paid a visit dur Pujas. I found the Biryani to be horrible. Next I paid a visit recently, that time it was bit better. Still much improvement needed.
The seating arrangement is good with AC on 1st floor. Prices are very pocket friendly.

Lucknow Biryani is beside Kalika on Suyra Sen Street. I have been here during Puja 2016. They have a small seating area with AC on 1st floor. Biryani costs Rs.70 I remember mostly. And they won't charge any tax so the place is damn cheap. But quality was very poor. Biryani was poor. We took another Kebab which was again much poor in quality and taste. They said that it was due to puja time maybe for which they could not maintain their quality due to high demand. But bad food is bad food. And is not acceptable.
