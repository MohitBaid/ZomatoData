Went to Kalash armed with a few Nearby coupons whereby they were offering North Indian/Bengali Thalis along with the chance to listen to some Ghazals for INR1299 per head. We had a booking at 7:30 PM but found the restaurant not ready as there were some shooting going on. This was a bit off-putting to say the least. Overall the atmosphere of the hotel feels a bit chaotic and does not give the impression of this being a very well managed place. Nevertheless, after a wait of about 20 mins we were warmly ushered in. The décor of this place is nice. We were then informed that we do not have much of a choice regarding the composition of the thali, instead it will be chef's choice. Anyways, as the artists took their seats and music started, the food arrived. The thalis contained rice, naans, fish fingers, dal, paneer, chicken and fish curries. Although the overall quantity on offer was a lot, the quality of food was underwhelming. The best part was actually the fish fingers. It went downhill from there. The naan and dal were still OK. But the chicken and fish curries were particularly disappointing. They were over spiced and tasted very similar to one another. The cooking lacked the subtlety and sophistication that one expects from a supposedly fine dining speciality restaurant at a five star property. Also serving all the items in one go has the disadvantage that by the time you have finished half the meal, the food has gone cold. The Ghazals were nice and the service warm after the initial hiccups. But one expects a LOT more for that price, especially when it comes to food.

Kalash is almost synonymous with royal cause that is the feeling one gets when entering the restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, almost always in the evening so that I could listen to some good ghazals while I enjoy my food.

All the food here is good, the dal makhani, the butter chicken, the mutton kebabs and the breads, all are very well prepared and are abundant with flavour.

What stands out the most is the service quality of Kalash, the servers do an excellent job and are very well trained in every aspect.

Definitely recommend this place but do try and go in the evening.

Went there on a weekday evening so it wasn't overly crowded. We ordered for vegetarian food and it was quite good. The ghazal singers made the evening very pleasant. Service was outstanding. Will surely go back.

Ghazal nights + good starters and a decent main course . Kalash is a perfect combo for sure. Specially the dahi kebab liked it . WHenever you wanna check in make sure there is a ghazal night to add to your evening

Pathetic  service followed by poor quality food...overall a bad experience. I was there 2 celebrate  my husband's bday with a lot of xpectations...bt was thoroughly  disappointed .D ghazal was too loud n d waiters need to be trained before they start recruiting them 2 such hotels.The ambience is nothing great...we cud see flies on our table.. though we had made d reservation  earlier....our table was dirty!! Al I wud say, please think twice before wasting ur money in such hotels... .they just simply run by their names. Neither would I nor would recommend any1 2 visit kalash again.....it had turned my special day into a complete  blunder.

We went to this place during the mango festival that was going on at this place.We were quite excited to visit this place but came disappointed with the food.The service and ambiance went very well.The visuals are so soothing and as you enter you will get a royal feeling.

Service-The service at this place was of top notch.As we entered the staff greeted us very well.Along with it the speed was also commendable.The staff was also trained very well.

Ambaince-The ambiance at this place was very calm and soothing.The place was also decorated very well.And during evening visits you will hear Hindustani Classical Music-which is a real show stealer.

Food-We were extremely disappointed with the food.This was the only thing for which we actually went.The presentation was excellent and the food was served fresh but the taste didn't went well.

Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-2.5/5

Would visit this place once more to try their a la carte menu.Hope that this time it would be good.😃😃

I have chosen Kalash to visit with my family to enjoy the restaurant week offerings. My worst half opted for Tangri Malai Kebab, Garlic Nan, Chicken Lababdar and Misti Doi and I have chosen Galauti Kebab, Peas Pulao, Amritsari Machchi and Kesar Kulfi and the little pumpkin was happy with her fruit juice. Though  each and every item were worth having for but when it came to the portion sizes...

If there's one place you'd want to be treated like a VIP, Kalash at HHI Hotel is the place for you. Apart from the mouth watering food that this five star restaurant has to offer, the hospitality of this place would alone leave you wanting to visit again.

Talk about mouth watering food, their menu has a whole lot to offer one being their Sherbets Kalash Ora Kin. A drink that would take you back to your childhood days. Clear mocktail with strong hints of kachha aam, which was ombre green in colour and was a complete refreshment to have.

For appetizers, we ordered their Tengri Malai Kebab, which was served on a freshly cut, round shaped banana leaf with a side of colourful looking salads. The two pieces of kebab were succulent and left us to wonder what the menu had in store for us next.

Next, we chose Galouti Kebab. On a bed of banana leaf, were served two pieces of kebab on top of miniscule breads and a side of salad. The kebabs were soft and melted in the mouth as soon as we put it in. However, it seemed to me and my companion that it lacked a bit of flavour and depth.

Next we ordered Murgh Lababdar. A reddish looking thick chicken curry with garnished herbs; a dish which was so delicious that I wanted to order twice.

With this, we ordered Fish Amritsari. Deboned pieces of fish, cooked to perfection in a lip-smacking curry.

In staples, we ordered plain old Steamed Rice and Garlic Naan, the naan being spot on.

In desserts, I loved their Orange Mousse. A little on the heavier side, this mousse was beautifully layered with cream and orange filling. This was topped with tempered chocolate. All this in one spoon made for a pleasant experience.

Although I liked the mousse very much, I didn't much enjoy the next dessert that came our way- Kesar Kulfi. From a presentation point of view it gets a ten out of ten, however the texture of this item was a bit too hard for my taste.

Before I wrap this elaborate review up, a few words on the management team. A five-star restaurant is not considered a five-star restaurant for just its food, and I feel that your team perfectly exemplifies that. A wonderful experience made by the staff team and the food department.

Platter after sizzling platter hit our table that day, and three hungry souls stared at the splendour, sipping on glasses of cold, rose-flavoured drinks. We were there to sample some of the specialties from the ‘Shaam-e-Kebab’ at Kalash, the sumptuous Kebab festival which featured some interesting and unusual dishes prepared by Sous Chef Shakil Akhtar. Born in Kolkata, he had travelled extensively, and the result was an array of dishes – some traditional, some innovative twists – which he had brought to the table.

This place has turned out to be a nightmare for me in all aspects in this week it happened that i had to be here on 2 consecutive days.

The first day was tuesday when i was here with cousins, we ordered veg cuisine, the service was pathetic, good quality beyond any worse we can expect and the pricing of 5 star made us frown. We decide to leave the food as it is even after repeated complains to the restaurant manager who happened to impose the fault on our taste buds then the stale food.

The very next day, I had to visit with family, I was really trying to pull out everyone, but everyone wanted to give it a shot and I had to witness the same load of misery again. This time things were worse with some stinking veggies as well.

For me and my family, the chapter is closed and I have marked this place closed on my list to be visited ever again.

Arriving in Kolkatta late Friday night for a next  day jury panel duty,  I check into the legendary HHI around half past ten. As I did not have any dinner in the flight, I enter the Kalash. It's about to close but the kind aged table staff dada allows me one last order. I don't even look at the menu and order a sweet lassi and veg pulao. Decor is dark muted red, wall have Murals and there is live ghazals to listen to. The singer graciously accedes to my request for a saigal and manna dey songs. A aged couple across my table are celebrating their anniversary ( I get a piece of strawberry cake too) and God bless you both uncle and Aunty. 

My lassi is thick and densely creamy. (8.5/10). A bit heavy to java so late night. Sigh. The veg pulav (9/10) is light, the vegetable chunks nicely cut & boiled. The basmati rice us well soaked in ghee and raisins / nuts in plenty. The spicy garlic mustard pickle and the Gujarati sweet murrabba give a brilliant combination.  The table staff are attentive, patient till I finish eating so that they can shut down and clear up. By half past eleven I sign by bill, head back to my room filled with the rice. Simple delicious meals away from home so late at night ... & happy anniversary to that kind uncle abs Aunty .. May you continue to find love in each other for many years to come . !!!!

Its an awesome place to hang around with friends and family members. The specialty about this restaurant is that they are all Indian and Mughal Cuisines. The tastes are awesome. Been there for two times.

This place serves the best north indian food in kolkata.. we ordered the nonveg kalash platter for starters.. and to my surprise the platter was huge.. it had two chicken lasoone kebab, two tandoorie prawn, two fish tikka and two pieces of mutton chops.. uff it just tasted heavenly.. till that day i never thought mutton could be so tender and juicy..

Great place for a family time,with soothing live musical atmosphere. Food is really great. Kebabs are well marinated and are succulent and melts in your mouth. Desert is of heaven's standard. Ambience is top notch. Not very pocket friendly but you cant just imagine a 5star's restaurant to be pockrt friendly so thats fine. Go for it,Thumbs up for it.

A have been there quite a few times and I like going back. Being a Bengali, I have to say that they have lip smacking Bengali dishes and desserts to die for.

Arriving in Kolkatta late Friday night for a next  day jury panel duty,  I check into the legendary HHI around half past ten. As I did not have any dinner in the flight, I enter the Kalash. It's about to close but the kind aged table staff dada allows me one last order. I don't even look at the menu and order a sweet lassi and veg pulao. Decor is dark muted red, wall have Murals and there is live ghazals to listen to. The singer graciously accedes to my request for a saigal and manna dey songs. A aged couple across my table are celebrating their anniversary ( I get a piece of strawberry cake too) and God bless you both uncle and Aunty. 

My lassi is thick and densely creamy. (8.5/10). A bit heavy to java so late night. Sigh. The veg pulav (9/10) is light, the vegetable chunks nicely cut & boiled. The basmati rice us well soaked in ghee and raisins / nuts in plenty. The spicy garlic mustard pickle and the Gujarati sweet murrabba give a brilliant combination.  The table staff are attentive, patient till I finish eating so that they can shut down and clear up. By half past eleven I sign by bill, head back to my room filled with the rice. Simple delicious meals away from home so late at night ... & happy anniversary to that kind uncle abs Aunty .. May you continue to find love in each other for many years to come . !!!!

A place I wanted to go n it happened at  a birthday treat of my Friend. 
Food is average n d ambiance as well. 
The service is A Class and The Staff is quiet friendly! 
I won't rate it much because it didn't actually live upto my expectations.

They claim themselves to be a traditional theme restaurant, however there staff is dressed up in modern clothes which is offsetting. This somehow take away the whole experience. Service is good but food is OK. Go there if you want to have a normal traditional north indian food.

At last a really really good restaurant for authentic Indian food. We were there for celebrating my cousin's birthday. For starters we had paneer chandni tikka, tandoori prawn, lazeez pasiliyan, badami murg. The lazeez pasiliyan is a mutton preparation-rich spicy mutton on ribs. It is a speciality and is a must-try. The badaani murg was excellent as well. The prawn was soft-just the right texture, unlike other places where you have to fight with the cutlery. For main course we had laccha parantha and 'green chilli mutton kosha'. There's no need to speak about these dishes. Superb! Gulab jamun and ice cream followed for dessert. Although the service was a bit slow-but the waiters were so courteous that we had almost forgotten that we were at a restaurant; so homely was the atmosphere. Hats off to you people. Keep up the good work!! 
Note again--the lazeez pasiliyan!!! Too good!

Went for a lunch buffet with family. Ambience is classy;Will rate 5/5. But food was not up to the mark. Menu selection is pathetic, even a kid will select a better menu and lastly the waiter gave an insensible explanation that the chocolate ice-cream had ran out of stock. I mean even HHI runs out of stock. Weird !Not Recommended.

Food variety is less in buffet. Ala carte options is there. Ambiences gets 4. Food gets 3.5 for taste. I loved the yellow dal. After long time i had tasted an authentic north indian- home made dal. Loved their soups. Services for breads is poor more than 15 mins and many reminders. Good place to try once with family.

Visited the restaurant twice recently. Once for casual dining and again to celebrate parent's anniversary. Decor wise it is quite good, well maintained sitting arrangements and a typical royal feeling will welcome you the moment you enter.

The staffs are well trained and hospitable. But the buffet offered is quite miserable. Choices are limited and the taste is not at par with any 4 star hotel, but pries are almost same as any hotel of this category.

The A la carte menu is much better.... both choice wise and taste wise. The portions offered are also ok for two persons. Desserts are highly recommended and so is the mock-tails.

Over all a so so experience.

Utter commotion among staffs. Breads to be served at the tables were cold. At more than two occasions more than half of the platters were empty.  Not expected from a hotel like HHI which boasts of 5 star status. Regretted going there for the dinner.

The decor is ok and the music at dinner is very nice. 
Then comes the food. I had the unfortunate experience of buying a groupon coupon for two which said that i will get a non-veg kebab platter, a drink, dal and bread selection each for 2 of us. However, the platter though named similarly is different from the one in the regular menu. Two pieces of chicken leg, some dry chicken kebab (couldnt figure out what kebab it possibly could be), some mutton which was not very tender and then surprise surprise...paneer, aloo and more paneer (in a non veg platter). Except for one paneer kebab the rest were either too dry (must be old stock being disposed off) or were bland and tasteless. 

Even the papad with the drinks was cold and as forbidding as the food.

The dal and the bread were decent fares. 

It was the music which really saved our evening....

Ot was really well marinated as the taste tell your brain while putting it into your mouth...then for the main course and side dish we ordered lobster masaledar,pulao,masala kulcha--the spiciness i simply loved the staffs are also good and well behaved...we took to mocktails which I forgot to mention in the beginning are fruito lit chies,creamy rich dry sherbet...ohhh it was quite a satisfaction...

At Kalash .... before food , comes the beautiful ambience , with lovely songs being played at your request :) 

Among the starters -  galouti kebab , badami murg & tandoori lobster ; the badami murg with its nutty & juicy stuffing made it special , though the lobsters did not fall far behind . Murg tikka lababdar tasted good with broccoli & mascarpone cheese kulcha , but much better with kulcha masala . 

Kalash Ora kinos - simple but good mango soft drink . We ordered for simple caramel custard .... served with strawberryand cream topping & kiwi ...... made the day ! A perfect birthday treat from sister . 

Lovely hospitality ..... & the home-made 'PAN' served at last made a perfect end to a lovely treat :D

At Kalash .... before food , comes the beautiful ambience , with lovely songs being played at your request :) 

Among the starters -  galouti kebab , badami murg & tandoori lobster ; the badami murg with its nutty & juicy stuffing made it special , though the lobsters did not fall far behind . Murg tikka lababdar tasted good with broccoli & mascarpone cheese kulcha , but much better with kulcha masala . 

Kalash Ora kinos - simple but good mango soft drink . We ordered for simple caramel custard .... served with strawberryand cream topping & kiwi ...... made the day ! A perfect birthday treat from sister . 

Lovely hospitality ..... & the home-made 'PAN' served at last made a perfect end to a lovely treat :D

Good Food. Amazing ambience and quite mesmerising with the live music. Evergreen songs of the 80's and 90's. The service though in the restaurant is quite  time taking and it might make you feel irritated if you are really hungry ????. All in all i would say a pleasant experience.

in HHI on AJC bose road, food, ambiance,  service everything at its best. the server was willing to give inputs on what to order, best part was a small live band playing, they even took a request and played a track i requested. it just took the experience to another level. quantity is decent, breads were tasty. the only issue was the dessert! wasnt good, dont have their "special" kesar kulfi, its not that special, overall a MUST VISIT.

Visited Kalash on a weekday for the lunch buffet. The ambience was warm, food quality was very good and healthy although the number of food items were not much! Whatever items were served were all well prepared and delicious!
Though I didn't like the taste of the soups, the au gratin was simply delightful, palak paneer dish was enticing, fish was very fresh and well cooked and the chicken was very soft and succulent. Desserts were my favourite part which consisted of the oh-so-yummy choco mousse and hot kala jamuns. It was a treat!
The attendants were helpful enough and were very prompt at their service. Overall had a nice experience on my first visit out there. Keep it up!

Been here so many times. I was with my wife this time and we ordered for a shorba which was below average, platter of kebabs which was superb and it was amazing, but the biryani in the end was way below satisfaction. The icing on the cake was the setting with live musicians singing indian oldies and it was just perfect fora more than perfect evening with my wife.

Kalash is our party venue...every time we go there we are left spell bounded by their awesome ambience and lip smacking food. Mutton Boti Kebab, Lachha Parantha and Mutton Rogan Josh are worth the wait. The Ghazals sung by the singers were also very melodious. Loved the fact that they even attend to our song requests. Can never get enough of Kalash!!!

I loved dining here with my daughter  and found the ambience just great as well as the music.  The decor was simple and good and one would feel relaxed just listening to the music.  The food and service was really superb, especially the chicken and kebabs.  I would love to dine here with friends and family and relish the yummy food. 

Kalash will get my vote for being the best Indian restaurant. Thanks for the lovely food and service.

One fine morning we decided to have lunch and thereby decided to go to HHI Kalash. We had a nice lunch and the buffet spreads Indian foods. Taste was really awesome and the ambience also good. Hilsa and goat meat tastes real yummy along with starters and desserts.

The taste of food has gone down big time and the buffet spread was not up to the standards it used to maintain.I had been a fan of Kalash and used to visit very often till the last two years but this time when I tried the buffet on Bengali New Year was very disheartened. The fish butter fry was cold and stale and the mutton too was not completely cooked. All that had a damage of close to Rs 5000 for three of us.Overall a bad experience and would think twice before visiting again.

The success of a good restaurant is its ability to please with its ambience and Kalash probably gets my vote for being a restaurant with a pleasing ambience. The décor is simple yet good and the mix of sofa and chairs ensure you have space to spread your legs and relax. The highlight is the live ghazal and geet programme that they have in the evening. The singers are pleasing to the ears and adds to the ambience. 

The food is quite good, the fish very soft and fresh and the chicken and the vegetable kebabs are a treat to the palate. 

Overall, I would love to go there and spend an evening listening to the songs while tucking into the yummy Indian spread of kebabs!

Good restaurant with warm hospitality and classic ambience..taste of the food was avearage..for authentic indian cuisine, I'd rather prefer sarson or kaafila..I, personally didn't find the live performance enjoyable..the performance was a mix of everything and it was surely not classical in true sense..they were singing gazals and old hindi melodies as well..I admire the charm and the classic ambience of the restaurant but I'm not very much impressed with the delicacy.

Kalash is a restaurant at HHI. It is a very expensive place, but that goes with its star rating.
The ambience is terrific and there is live Hindusthani Classical Music in the evenings - which is the real show-stealer, actually. The service is impeccable, but you have to remember that you are at one of the top-bracket hotels in the city.

The food is delectable. The Lahsooni Kebabs are soft and the Galouti Kebabs are as good as they are supposed to be. The Kashmiri Pulao and the Dal Kalash is pretty good to taste. I wouldn't recommend the Biriyani. The naan is soft and you can ask for flavours such as cheese, chilly and parmesan.

However, the section that I personally love is the desert spread. The Baked Mihidana is the best dessert I have had here and it definitey qualifies as one of the best desserts I have ever tasted in my life.

Verdict: It is very expensive - You can expect a bill of Rs. 3000 for two. But the Baked Mihidana is worth dying for.
