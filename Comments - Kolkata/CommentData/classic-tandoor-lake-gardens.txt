This outlet has been consistently churning out Dane  quality of food for so many years without any quality detoriation
 What stands out is the Biryani. Succulemt, lesser spicy, well balanced aroma and the right tenderness of the meat, mutton or chicken. The other favorite and must try is chicken bhartha.

Awesome Mughlai dishes. Kababs and curries are simply mouth watering. Chinese is good but not the best. I love the reshmi butter masala and tikka masala.

Located at the North Western corner of Lord's crossing,Classic Tandoor is known for serving North Indian food at good prices.
Since it's close to my place,I've always opted for takeaway,which is the preferred choice for majority of their customers.
The portions of Chicken in their dishes are good.
Their Chicken kebabs,Chicken Bharta,Chicken Chaap,etc; are best sellers.
Their Biriyani is filling and has a good balance of spices and they serve it with a potato and an egg.
The most positive feature about this place is that they offer good quality food at reasonable prices.

Been to this place couple of times. Located is lords more opposite to the swissyum outlet. 

The sitting arrangements is not that good. It was okayish, even the ambiance is not up to the mark. I visit this place only for takeaways. 

As the name suggests, yes they serve Indian dishes 
But they also serve Chinese aswell. 
And am not a big fan of their Chinese cuisine.

I Love the biriyani here as it is non-greasy and tasty. Some of the places serving biriyani are very oily and you can feel the layer of oil in your hand after a while but Classic Tandoor Biriyani is not atall greasy. The kababs there are also good.I have been eating here since a long long time and i think it is still good.So whenever guests are at home and wants biriyani we always order from Classic Tandoor.

The place is located just opposite to the Lake Gardens Swissyum Outlet. I have got the food packed from here twice. Once, going by the 'Tandoor' name we took Biryani, Naan and Chicken Bharta. The food was good, better to say okayish. Next time, why I don't know my sister got Chinese from here. It was pathetic. So people, if you come here or get food packed, go for the Indian, not Chinese.

This eatery situated at the Lord's crossing, ages back a long time. Initially I remember eating here often because it did serve real good food. Now a days the standard has whatsoever depreciated. 
Nevertheless , the chicken/mutton roll here is my favourite pick. Try having the ones without the oodles of ketchup and mustard. 
The kebabs are decent, but considering better places these days, it lacks a bit of perfection. 
Ideal for some evening snacking when you are really hungry. In my opinion this has now become a moderate kind of food joint! 
You might take a chance to visit here.

This eatery joint is situated at lords more. Before returning home my friend and i decided to take away some food from this joint. Both of us ordered chicken reshmi kebab,tandoori roti and chicken biriyani. The reshmi kebab was soft;it was quite good. The biriyani tasted fine but it was dry and the potato was undercooked. Coming to the tandoori roti it was ok-neither soft nor hard. Overall it was quite ok.

Still very good. Just stick to the regular dishes. Do not expect them to offer you wonders in varieties. Regular Chicken, Naan, Dal, Mixed Veg, Kebabs are worth it.

WORST SERVICE EVER! The manner in which they deal with customers is extremely objectionable and their delivery service is very poor. It took them 2 hours from Lake Gardens more to Lake Gardens Golepark Hsg. to deliver my order (which normally takes a maximum of 20mins). They made us wait past 10.30pm at night when the order was made at 8.24pm. Food which they sent afterwards was cold and needed to be microwaved again. Flop shop!

This place is located right at the lords crossing towards Lake Gardens.It is a two storeyed place but the restaurant is located on the 1st floor with the ground floor being mainly used for take aways and also for the billing counter. I have chicken tandooris here most of the time and like most of the other places in its vicinity it serves decent tandooris at a reasonable price. The chinese main courses and starters are also respectable enough and more or less are satisfying in terms of quality. However, in terms of cleanliness the place falls a bit  short  and could do with a bit of revamp. But considering the price of food out here and its decent quality this place can definitely serve as an option in times of need.

I keep ordering from this joint located at the Lord's Bakery More.I love their biryanis and one plate of their special biryani is enough to satisfy to hungry souls.Their kebabs are great as well,be it the reshmi,the hariyali or the tikka.But the thing that you must order is their chicken tikka masala.The taste is incomparable.Their delivery service is quite prompt.But the one thing I don't like about this place is that whenever I call them up to order,they ask me to dictate my whole address(trust me,it's long) even though they have delivered millions of times before.

Located at Lords More. Took home delivery to a friend's place from here. Ordered Biryani and Reshmi Kabab which turned out to be tasty. Delivery time was okayish. Being an avid fan of Biryani, the quality and quantity was enough for a heavy-eater like me. Reshmi Kabab was top notch. Worth it absolutely.

Classic Tandoor – Not Really Classic.

=====

Location: Lord’s More. The side which goes towards Momo I am.  

=====

Intro: Classic Tandoor is a place which I discovered when I visited one of my Bong friend who stays nearby. This place is nothing extraordinary and is quite small in size though. This place also lacks a washroom and is not very well with hygiene too. Nevertheless, I just got some biriyani’s packed for a house party at my friend’s place. 

=====

What i ordered: 

1) Chicken Biriyani – We ordered 3 plates and it costed us 330 inclusive of taxes. With respect to the price, it is really reasonable. The biriyani had comprised of Garlic Mildly Spiced piece of Chicken, Egg and Potato too. The marination of the chicken was solid. The biriyani was filling as well and was quite a good meal with respect to the price charged. 

=====

Meal for two: 250-450 approx

====

Pros:

1) Reasonably priced.

2) Location will definitely attract customers.

3) Fast Service.

4) Quantity of the Food is quite good. 

Cons:

1) Hospitality can be improved much more. 

2) Hygiene needs to be maintained. 

=====

Expert Suggestions: 1) Maintain your hygiene.

=====

Summary:

Hygiene 2.8/5

Taste 3.5/5

Food quality 3.4/5

Food Presentation 3.6/5

Ambience 3/5

Value for money 3.7/5 

=====

Conclusion: I would revisit it again if they maintain their hygiene and would order more items on the menu. 

=====

Note: Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

I would say this is one place which should be known for their unique biriyani. Most of the people do not know that this place makes a biriyani in complete white oil which makes it very cholesterol friendly and light so ultimately pretty easy to digest. This is actually the lighter than the main stream biriyani we can think of.  I would suggest everyone to give it a try.

I have never actually sat down at this place to eat do my review is based on their delivery and take away service. The  place is very old,  probably oldest in all the eateries that for lord's crossing.  The tandoori delicacies hanging beyond the glass is quite inviting.  If you are preferring take away for lunch or dinner I will highly recommend this place as service time is surprisingly quick.  I like their tandoori chicken and chicken tikka kebab.  The reshmi kebab has a weird coating which I don't like.  I have mostly sampled their Indian fare and like the chicken bharta and chicken rezala.  The tandoori n roomali roti are good too although they tend to become tough when cold. 
Overall, a very good takeaway option that will never pinch your pocket

During Durga Pujo people end up at strange restaurants.Situated at Lake Gardens crossing,Classic tandoor was the place we ended up at for lunch during one of our pujo outings this year.

Before we seated ourselves we were informed  that only Chinese and Biryani would be available and the tandoor of Classic tandoor was not ready yet.All we cared about then was a place where we could sit and eat so we decided to try it out nonetheless.

We had the Mutton Biryani,Mutton kasha,Chicken chowmein and the Chicken Manchurian.The Biryani was very average,quite poor in fact.Regarding the mutton in the Biryani,the least said the better.The mutton kasha was decent though.The chicken chowmein and chicken Manchurian were again pretty ordinary.
The only thing worth mentioning about the interior is that it is airconditioned.Otherwise a rather shabby place.The prices are cheap and the service decent.

Overall this is one of those places to try only if you are passing by extremely hungry and having a low budget.

Being situated at the Lord’s Bakery crossing is their main usp. Visited this place numerous times and I always preferred take-aways. They have never disappointed me with their service. They also have a dine-in on the 1st floor with ordinary ambiance and crampy seating arrangements. 

Personally, I like their kebabs, they provide quality kebabs at reasonable price. Meats are well marinated, tender and always flavourfull. The quality of Chicken tandoori they serve can be compared head to head with some big shot restaurants in the city. 

N.B: The rating is solely based on Kebabs.

I had heard a lot about this place from my elder brother when I was a decade younger. The name Classic Tandoor emerged out of my blurred and distant childhood memories as the final option to dine in after we were done comparing the budget restaurants in that area. The place was totally empty when we entered a little before 9 P.M. There’s absolutely nothing to comment about the décor, ambience and service except that they have an A.C. and adequate dining space, they do not accept cards and the food comes in pretty fast. 

Our order comprised of chicken tikka kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, mutton and chicken biryani, chicken reshmi butter masala and plain naan. The kebabs, (especially the reshmi ones) were soft, succulent and flavoursome and were much better than many other hyped places. The tikka kebabs were spicier and quite nicely done.  The biryani had very less oil with a slight aroma and had all the essential elements a Kolkata biryani lover could want; the potato, boiled egg and the huge piece of nicely boiled mutton. The naan was soft and fluffy. The gravy from the chicken reshmi butter masala gave out a slight pungent odour at first, which I later ignored as it had to be my imagination. It contained the same tender pieces of reshmi kebabs in a nice buttery thick white curry. A chicken biryani was later parceled and the bill came to be Rs. 1008, a very affordable amount for stuffing up four very hungry souls up to the brim and with satisfaction.   


P.S.: I feel that the place is a bit under rated for its value.

This restaurant is located in the lane opposite Lord's Bakery. I have never been to the restaurant for a dine-in experience. I have always requested for home delivery. Well first things first, when we talk about home delivery and for all the people who wish to order food from the comfort of their homes, please be assured about the punctuality of this restaurant. They have always delivered the food exactly at the designated time. I do not know about others but they seem to be pretty well versed with the surrounding locality. They knew my address very well and the orders have always been delivered neatly and most importantly on time. I hate restaurants who make you call them twice or God forbid thrice and then your food arrives when you have lost your appetite. Okay now let's move on to the food. 
I have ordered quite a couple of times from this place. My favourite would be Tandoori Chicken. The chicken is well marinated which explains it's softness. Each bite pulls off tender and succulent strips of chicken. The chicken is well flavored. I have had the bad experience of eating hard and over-tandoored (if I may use this term) chicken at many places but not this one. It is cooked just the right way. The naan and tandoori roti is pretty much similar to what you would get at other joints. I have also tasted Schezwan chicken and Chicken Garlic Drumstick. Now the Schezwan chicken is good but the excessive use of cornflour puts me off every time. Also the chicken is a tad too spicy for me. While some of you might like the extra spice, it gave me one hell of a time later on. But the Chicken Garlic Drumstick is an absolute delight. Although it is not the best but it is still good. One suggestion, eat it hot. The drumsticks are fried with generous amounts of garlic and chilli. It is well cooked, tasty and spicy. Even though I cannot handle too much of spice in my food, but the drumsticks need that kind of spicing up or else you do not get the feel of it. But u can just stick to the drumstick and avoid the garlic and chilli seasoning. It still tastes very good. The fried rice is not that good. It is quite below average in my opinion and so is the Schezwan fried rice. I can't remember ordering anything else from this place. However, if I had to give you a suggestion, then I would say go for the Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Garlic Drumstick. I am sure you will love it. Unfortunately I do not have pics to go with this one but I hope I have done justice in giving you an idea about this restaurant. 
Happy Eating :)

I have been ordering from this joint for quite some time now,have been living in the area for more than 12 years.The food of Classic Tandoor may not be the best,and I have tasted much better; it"s their quick delivery and prompt service consistently for the past years that led me to their appraisal.So, I would give them a 4.0 / 5.0

We got biriyani n chicken bharta from this store. The biriyani was not 1 of the best. The rice wasn't cooked well. The chicken was definitely not tender. The bharta was comparatively better. Compared to the quantity n price range i don't expect any better. Worth giving occasional orders.

the biriyani is really fantastic and the other food items are also good but when it comes to price its a bit overpriced as a fast food joint.

Clean, large portions and pocket friendly take away place. They have home delivery too but be prepared for real long waits. The biriyanis are a big draw here as are the tandoor items. They also do reasonable chinese. They have restarted the bengali home delivery lunch sets again but orders are to be placed by 10.30.

Well, this was a surprise find for us. After our disastrous experiment with Shawarma Nation on PAS Road and leaving the joint hungry, we just decided to fill ourselves up at any "Tom, Dick and Harry" Restaurant, when we saw Classic Tandoor. All that we wanted was an A/C Restaurant, and this joint had an A/C "Dine-In" available. We entered the restaurant and there was only this other table occupied by 2 gentlemen. Hence, we were pretty apprehensive about the food and ordered for a Chicken Tandoori, a Chicken Bharta and Tandoori Rotis. When the food arrived, it was such a pleasant surprise! The Tandoori was perfectly done with the right amount of seasoning and marination and the Bharta was also pretty decent. But it were the Tandoori Rotis which were the best. I haven't had such fluffy and soft Tandoori Roti's in a lot of "Big Shot" Restaurants in Kolkata.

Overall it was a nice eating out experience and the staff was also very friendly. The guy attending to us even got a 600 ml Thums Up from the next shop when we inquired about the availability of any aerated drink.

This joint is located at Lords Bakery crossing-a very prominent locality of South Kolkata.The place has been around for quite some time.This is a typical take-away/home delivery no frills joint.They do have a seating section in the first floor, though i haven't been there.Prices are economical, service is prompt and food quality and quantity is pretty decent.They have a decent variety of items in the menu-kebabs,roti,biriyani and "Indian chinese " as well. Items like tandoori chicken,chicken reshmi masala,mixed veg,chana masala,chicken tikka deserve a special mention.
