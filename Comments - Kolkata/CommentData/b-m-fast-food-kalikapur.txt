Biriyani is amazing and succulent.
They even provide an egg which is uncommon at many places. It's always fresh and not too oily.
Chicken biriyani at just â‚¹80.
Good stuff.

B.M Fast Food at Haltu Bazar serves multi cusine from Rolls, Chinese to Biriyani everything. I tried their Chowmine and Chilli Chicken once. Turned out to be very poor in quality. Much like the footpath stores. The Chow quality was down, much oily and very little and few pieces of Chicken.
Prices are okay. But quality is low.

It is exactly situated at Haltu bazar... a very busy joint specially during the evening... they have both north Indian and chinese cuisine... but the looks of the kabab are not that appealing... also the place was very unhygienic... so I opted for an egg chicken roll... and my doubts became true... it was very very bad... pocket pinch was friendly though...

This shop is the life saviour for foodies living in Kasba  Haltu/Kayasthapara region as there is literally no other options nearby.  The food quality is not the best but satisfactory if you stick to conventional dishes. But the momos are really awesome.  Avoid the fish fry from this shop. They also have free home delivery service within 2 kilometers with no minimum order rule or so.  Hygiene is alsp satisfactory though needs improvement in certain aspects.

I have had their rolls and "moglai porota" and these items are pretty stabdard( as u get in a roadside eatery). Today, for dinner I was looking for inexpensive alternatives and I noticed their "combo" offer. 
Egg chow mein and chili chicken for 60 bucks.

I packed and took back home.
The chow mein was average and so was the chili chicken. Two pieces of chili chicken, half of its volume was due to the coating and an average sauce. Worse, I found lumos of noodles, clumped together, untouched by oil or seasonings.

This local food parlor is nearly 10 mins away from my home. I tried their chowmien and biryani, both were average in taste. The price is not low also.

BM is this really nice food joint that is just like 5 mins away from my place. I'm a regular here, almost every week, well mainly I get the stuff delivered home. I have tried quite a few things on the menu. 
I had first tried the Egg Chicken roll which is just yum. It is neither oily nor excessively spicy. Thereafter, I became a fan of this place. 
From the non-veg starters, I have tried the Fish Finger, Chicken lollipop, Drums of heaven, Fish fry and a few others. the lollipop is my absolute favorite. For a small place like this, this preparation is absolutely amazing! 
I have also tried the American chopsuey, Noodles, different types of fried rice, and a number of chicken preparations. I recently ordered Schezwan rice and chicken. 

All the dishes have been yum so far! 

The biriyani, something they specialize in, isn't the best I would say. It was pretty ordinary. But all the others have been up to the mark! 

Also, the delivery time is pretty reasonable. Their food is usually kept ready and it takes them 15-20 minutes for delivery. AND! The prices are really going to surprise you if you consider the quality of food. 

All in all, it is a great joint near my place! :)
