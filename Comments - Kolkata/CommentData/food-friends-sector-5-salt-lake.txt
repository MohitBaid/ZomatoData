Got hungry suddenly? Need a quick grab?? Food Friend's is your perfect pocket friendly option!! A chicken lollipop with 8 pieces is enough to fill your tummy for a long time till you crave for another refill! A value for money because including the delivery charges it would cost around Rs.185/-.

I don't know how people can consume such low quality food. Taste wise, sure it might be passable but you know how rubbish the quality is. I wouldnot buy from here ever again, waste of money and they didnot understand me on the phone either. Waste of time.
