This small food joint is located at alochaya bus stop, beside mukharuchi restaurant. There is another branch of this place at rashmoni bazar road. But I prefer the main joint. They not only serve biriyani and mughlai items,but also rolls and chowmein.The chicken biryani is very tasty and Pocket friendly. The rolls are pretty good too. Tried the chicken reshmi kabab once,it was decent. But the mutton kosha was terrible.

On a hot Sunday afternoon, while returning from a class, I and my friend were very hungry and on Sundays the whole area is like a graveyard. No shops in sight the kind auto rickshaw driver dropped us infront of this place. The place was not quite ready at that time with the food except for biryanis. Being as hungry as we were, we promptly ordered two chicken biryanis. While taking a look at the menu, I noticed the fact that most items were cheaper than other similar restaurants. The food was nothing to brag about but it was decent. The quantity was great. For hungry stomachs that is like paradise. If I remember correctly, seating arrangement covers 16 people at a time and that is something they shud increase. This eatery is quite underrated and shud deserve more praise than it gets. I'll visit this eatery again. Do give this a try. :)

Situated opposite to Aloychaya, had tried the Reshmi Kebab here once. The Kebabs were juicy, soft and succulent. The portions simply melted into my mouth. A cracker of a deal at such a low price. Big guns like Arsalan should take a cue from them. Would definitely like to come back again to try the other Kebabs and their Biryani.

A purely Indian and moghlai take away joint.
Indianized Chinese dishes are also available here to make it an multi cuisine joint as well.

**Location**
It is at the bylane of the Beliaghata main road.

**Experience**
People generally goes for Biriyani take away from here and it's quite popular for the same. Good part is they serve you half plates of main dishes in gravy items which is good when you are eating alone and not sharing. Pricing is quite reasonable. The quality of the food is just about ordinary nothing special and a bit too oily as well. Though the taste decent but too rich for my taste. Chinese items are made in Indian style purely but doesn't taste bad either.

Had their mutton special biryani which was light and good-tasting. The mutton was really nice, soft and succulent. For quick biryani takeouts this place is a good option.

well..."Haji Fast Food" is located just opposite old time alochaya single theatre. they have a good variety of items in there menu, mughlai, rolls, chinese and kebabs. I have tried there basic rolls and chow before, and they were okay. nothing to boast about. but this time i wanted 2 try there kebab section. 
thourougly to be seen..they have different types of kebabs in there menu, but i ordered for chicken tandoori (half/2 pieces) for 125/- , chicken tikka kebab (half plate/3 pieces) for 45/- and chicken reshmi kebab (half plate/3 pieces) for 50/-. now, i honestly feel .... i did not expect the kebabs to be so good at this price range, but this place eventualy surprised me. loved there kebabs really very much. soft succulent juicy fresh kebabs, in big chunks along with mint chutney and onions fringes. it was all so good without a pocket pinch. Would definetly love to be there sometime soon again :) and highly recommended to everyone if u all ever pass by this lane :)
