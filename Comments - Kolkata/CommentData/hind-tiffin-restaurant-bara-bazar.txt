A real budget friendly food joint with quality veg food. Don't expect too much from the ambience as the place is really small. Please don't confuse it to be a restaurant. It's a place that makes mostly Tiffin n lunch meant for delivery or take away purpose. You will love the butter masala dosa n uttapam. They serve you fresh.

Bought 2 dosas for delivery, one of them was cheese plain. They gave me plain and charged for cheese plain. When I called them about the issue, they were offering me cheese cube. Now what do I do with that, eat it and shake it inside my belly? One star.

This is one of those trendy eateries which’ve sprung up all over North Kolkata, of late. The Dosa Diner tries to ’’revolutionise’’ regular South Indian fare by experimenting, innovating, and building upon traditional recipes. You have the usual assortment of idlis, vadas, appams, and of course dosas, which go with the not-so-usual paneer, babycorn, and mushroom fillings amongst other things. The results could’ve been - SHOULD have been - fabulous. Unfortunately enough, the food is a bit insipid. The rasam is totally hot, the idlis are good enough (soft and fluffy), and even the vadas are not so bad, but hey, the name of this place is ’’Hind Tiffin" and the dosas they serve totally awesome. Under 200 you can complete your family dinner. Hardly seen it empty. They serve totally hygienic and tasty food in very pocket friendly cost. Home delivery service available too.

A must visit place for all South Indian food lovers, this place dishes out delicious and flavorful Dosas, Idlis and Vadas at economical prices. The place remains congested though due to the sheer popularity. They also apparently caters to home delivery order, which is a very good option for nearby living students.

The best idly vada in the locality is provided by them. The red chatni of garlic is somewhat very special. Very pocket friendly and service is not timely but indeed very rapid.

Nostalgia for me! One of the first outdoor restaurants where I went to enjoy treats with my school friends. It's situated in Ganesh Talkies area and is almost every time crowded with people. If you want a tasty and economical south Indian food, this is the place. They have all sorts of varieties of south Indian cuisine. A congested place, but if you're in Barabazar you learn to deal with it.

A small joint located in Girish Park,which is primarily a student area.
For outstation students its a great place.
I have been to this place twice and yes not to forget it also provides home delivery service(again it is a benefit for specially outstation students )
It specialises in basically South Indian cuisine.
I liked the taste of Idli ,which was very soft and well fermented.Sambar was really good and chutney was average.
Dosa was average.I found it to be a little soggy(crisp dosas are my delights not soggy ones) and also a little cold.
The highlight of this mini joint is its Vada.Nice and full in size.Perfectly heated with perfect sambar.
So guys if you all want to enjoy good South Indian cuisine at a cheap price,this place is for you.Especially for students who have awful hostel or PG food.
