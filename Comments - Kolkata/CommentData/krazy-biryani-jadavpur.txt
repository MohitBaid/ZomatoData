Ordered grilled honey soy chicken - actually it's a bit funny to have such a dish in the menu for a restaurant having biryani in it's name...but of course, it has got Krazy too! Anyways, the grilled chicken consisted of 8 pieces of boneless chicken breast pieces perfectly grilled...the grill marks actually visible and appetizing...soft flesh, juicy too with loads of flavor. Sweet and salt jugalbandi by honey and soy sauce impeccable...roasted sesame seeds adding the final flourish...good..
However, though they have charged separately for packaging and delivery none were not up to the mark...

This place will make you fall in love with its food . We friends ordered some food from this joint in Jadavpur and were delighted after having the delicious preparations .

What we ordered :

‚ö´Ô∏èChilly Fish
‚ö´Ô∏èChilly Pork
‚ö´Ô∏è Chicken Tikia Kebab
‚ö´Ô∏è Mutton Handi Biryani
‚ö´Ô∏èChicken Kassa

Each and everything was amazing and tasty . The biryani is a must must have . The quantity is huge at such a reasonable price . Loved the Tikia Kebab . The Chicken Kassa was delicious . Tender chicken pieces in thick gravy was extremely yummy.

The packaging also deserves a mention . Was delivered on time .

Serves as my go to takeway.
Stands admist bickramgarh.
This place serves wonderful set of delecasies.
Something that can please you to a great extent.
Frankly this place has taken over to be one among my favourites. 
I almost have covered everything from here. 
Your dine line consisted of:
Chilli Pork: Diced pieces of roasted chilli pork. Juicy and enough to set your taste buds for an amazing pork jouney.
Chicken kasa : Aromatic and wonderfully cooked chicken which can set you drooling
Chili Fish : Diced fish perfectly juicy and tender.
Chicken handi biriyani : The best i've had so far. The very smell can give you all the essence of the spices and everything. Perfectly cooked. This is a treat for all  biriyani lovers.
Besides this
Garlic rice , Kung pao chicken, Garlic chicken , Lemon fish are also very good here.
For me the Chicken handi biriyani is the star performer here. A must try for all.
This place gives you a very little pocket pinch. 
So if you've got a bunch ready to spare some bucks over amazing food this is where you should order from.
Happy to have it close to my place.
This place definetly gets a 'Must Try' tag from me.
Note: Takeaways are best here.

Biriyani from this outlet is just awesome.We took a home delivery to try out their food and it was the best decision we could have taken.
The starters included chicken tikki kebab, chilli fried fish and chilli pork dry. We had chicken and mutton handi biriyani which was plain awesome especially with the chicken kasa and mutton kasa.
If you love biriyani this place is a must try.

Having had biryani in Chennai, which is very different from what we get in kolkata, and some of them were a nightmare, I never thought I‚Äôd say this but, I had my worst biryani in Kolkata. Thanks to Krazy Biryani. 

So far I‚Äôve had biryani that has had peas or tomato or maybe even curry leaves. This is the first time I had with coriander leaves. The biryani smelled of artificial scent. Lacked taste and was dry. Coming to the chicken chaap, I don‚Äôt even know which was the worst aspect of it. The litres of oil that came with it or the complete lack of taste. 

Honestly, if you want good food, jadavpur has better places. Now that I decided to read some of the other reviews most of them come with a regret statement from the management. Try something else folks unless you wanna see your money go to waste. :)

A refreshment of flavours with the tangy flavoured biryani from this great place .
I had chicken kasha on the side dish with the biryani yet I am compelled to talk about the starters namely chilli pork which was really really mouthwatering.
All in all a budget friendly place to have some really good biryani.

I think I jumped the gun with my last review, today was diametrically opposite....
1.  For 2 mutton biriyanis with extras it cost ‚Çπ560/- so not great a price point
2.  The extra egg/potatoes were missing!!!!
3.  The taste wasn't nearly worth the buck
4.  The delivery times exceeded by quite a bit
5.  The delivery person whose no was received did not respond to calls and was pretty brazen about it, and even admitting without an expression that he received as many missed calls
6.  The joint on being called about the order was very prompt to reply (even before I completed my sentence!!!!) that "we only prepare the food, it is zomato's responsibility to deliver it.... Please contact them"

Well I had ordered Dum handi Gosht Biriyani yesterday and was expecting the taste to be good .My expectation s were high after reading all the reviews. But on the contrary it turned out to be a damp squib. It was quite salty and the aroma and the tast of the spices were also missing..Extremely disappointed..there are plenty of food oulets serving biriyani and even the roadside biriyani stalls serve better biriyani to be frank..

This place situated at 63/A, Prince Golam Hossain Shah Road, Poddar Nagar 2, Jadavpur, Kolkata. It's takeaway joint. Pretty good taste to pleasure you and the specialty is in the name that is biryani. You'll have one of the best biryani ever. Not made the traditional way but has a good taste. Decent fit to pocket. Worth trying.

I had been to a friends place and decided to get food from krazy biryani as I had heard a lot about them but never tried.

We ordered:

Chilly Pork: This was just amazing,the best chilly pork I have had and I loved the large chunks of pork they gave.

Chilly fish: The fish was really soft and the gravy was amazing.

Mutton Handi Biryani: The biryani was delicious served in a clay pot and it had ample amount of mutton and potato.

Chicken Kassa: Absolutely lip smacking ,large chicken piece and the thick gravy was amazing.

The food was delivered within 40 minutes and the packaging was great too.

A must try place if you want to try delicious Chinese food and biryani.

It's.like a take away joint near Jadavpur. The biriyani is ok. Contradictory to the name, the Chinese is better. Once ordered two biriyani. Chicken was missing from 1 of them. When I told them they replaced. But the delivery boy who came to replace started saying" this can't be the case, you should open the packets when delivered and see, u must have eaten and then asking for replacement" . Thought of going back with him to his shop and shove the piece of chicken up his..  but we were hungry so chose otherwise

Having had biryani in Chennai, which is very different from what we get in kolkata, and some of them were a nightmare, I never thought I‚Äôd say this but, I had my worst biryani in Kolkata. Thanks to Krazy Biryani. 

So far I‚Äôve had biryani that has had peas or tomato or maybe even curry leaves. This is the first time I had with coriander leaves. The biryani smelled of artificial scent. Lacked taste and was dry. Coming to the chicken chaap, I don‚Äôt even know which was the worst aspect of it. The litres of oil that came with it or the complete lack of taste. 

Honestly, if you want good food, jadavpur has better places. Now that I decided to read some of the other reviews most of them come with a regret statement from the management. Try something else folks unless you wanna see your money go to waste. :)

It's.like a take away joint near Jadavpur. The biriyani is ok. Contradictory to the name, the Chinese is better. Once ordered two biriyani. Chicken was missing from 1 of them. When I told them they replaced. But the delivery boy who came to replace started saying" this can't be the case, you should open the packets when delivered and see, u must have eaten and then asking for replacement" . Thought of going back with him to his shop and shove the piece of chicken up his..  but we were hungry so chose otherwise

I really have no idea how this place is rated so highly.
It's a small delivery joint which is quite difficult to reach.
This place is named as crazy biryani but trust me Chinese cuisine surely dominates the menu.
I tried dragon chicken and it was out of the world.
Frankly speaking it's the best chinese starter I have ever had.
I wanted to pack home something so I ordered the handi Biryani. The quantity was very satisfying they say it's for 2 people but 3 people will also have a hard time finishing it up.
Coming to the taste the biryani was really bland.
Really was disappointed.
Giving 3 stars only for the dragon chicken.
World like to try out Chinese here but never recommend anyone for d Biryani.

Tasted Handi Chicken Biriyani.. Delivery was on time & taste was good no doubt. it was provided in a big earthen pot with aluminium foil on the top covering it. 1 was enough for 2 adult people at lunch! Rice quantity was huge. Chicken Pieces were big in size soft & spicy. 2 boiled eggs were also provided with it! Free Salad was given as complimentary with the biriyani. A bit expensive but ok as the quantity they provide in Chicken Handi Biriyani is enough for 2 people! Not aware of the taste of other dish but for biriyani Recomended.. ;)

Loved their ghee-soaked mutton Handi Biriyani. The quantity is enough to feed 3 people. The regular biriyani is also good and I was happy to find that they serve half plate biriyani too which is sufficient for small-eaters like me. The only item that I did not like is the Tikia Kabab\Tikia Kabab Biriyani, it is too spicy for my choice.¬†

Please be careful while serving Biriyani from the Handi, else you might scrape off a bit of earthen granules off the Handi which leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

Ordered chicken handi biryani from this place, which turned out to be freaking good. Quantity wise it was sufficient for 3 people. Taste wise, it was on the spicier side which gave me multiple foodgasms in my mouth. 3 reasonably sized chicken pieces, 2 hunky potatoes and 2 eggs.. And a whole lot of fried onions with a generous touch of ghee.. Loved every bit of it. Recommended if you are willing to have a sumptuous meal with a couple of buddies at home.

We ordered Dum Gosht Special Biryani and it was just perfect, with caramelized onions and big juicy pieces of mutton. 

The next day we ordered two mutton Biryani seeing the 20% off coupon. This time the mutton Biryani was bad. It had one bony pieces of mutton and even the rice had no Smell. I was surprised that it was even Biryani what I was eating. 

Would I order again? Only the special Biryani.

I ordered their mutton handi biriyani and my reviews are as follows-
What I like-

# The quantity is enough for 3
# The rice was super long
# No unnecessary aroma
# Prepared out of pure ghee
# 3 pieces of mutton, 2 large potato, 2 eggs

What I didn't like -

#Mutton pieces and potatoes should have been much much much softer
#1mutton piece was nothing but bone, though other 2pieces were fine
#Delivery time was horrible. I ordered at 1:45pm and got the handi at 4:20pm- I stay near Padmasree and normally it takes hardly 15 minutes in auto from Jadavpur to my place.
#Complimentary Raita was not given. When I asked, I was told nothing of that sort is given, but in Zomato reviews only I came across the raita thing.
# The delivery charge was supposed to be 20 for 5kms -as per their Zomato menu, but I was charged 30.
#They don't accept card-only cash!!

Overall experience was okayish... Management should take care of these especially when their joint is getting highlighted in Zomato collection of Biriyanis..

Chicken pieces soft and good quantity. But I would like to suggest if the quantity is increased or made level to level with Handi neck then it will be fabulous. Overall I loved this eating this biriyani.

This is mainly nice for "takeaway". I have never visited this restaurant. But have ordered numerous time via A home delivery app.** Special Mention is there Handi, which is an earthen pot. The biriyani is delivered in this pot itself with an aluminum¬†foil on top. Earthen pot carries the different feeling and taste to the biriyani. The garnishing by crisp onions and dry fruits adds a different flavor.
Q. Tried what? (Only special mentions)
A. Murgh handi Biriyani, Gosht Handi Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chap.
Comments:¬† Both Murgh and Gosht handi biriyani is worth a try. It typically contains¬†"three" pieces of whichever kind you try.¬† Pieces are soft and juicy, which is very imp for me in case of biriyani. But one piece will be small or bone part, not much edible. The texture of the rice is nice and evenly blended.¬†But apart from handi biriyani rest, all other items are not recommended at all. The normal biriyani which they serve is very low quality. Same for chap.
* Deducted 1.5; .5 for the pieces and one for limited¬†good options.

This recently opened Biryani and Chinese delivery joint is making a huge noise quite lately. I invited a few friends for lunch and I decided to order biryani from this joint. They were really quick in delivering the food and the packaging of the food is commendable. The hygiene has been maintained with utmost care.
I ordered-
1. Dragon chicken - chinese starter to start with a great lunch. The pieces are quite big and filling.
2. Dry chili Fish- the fish pieces were juicy and soft and tasted really good.
3. chicken tikia kebab- a North Indian starter for a change of the taste buds. Very well cooked tikia kebabs will melt in your mouth in no time.
4.  Mutton and chicken handi biryani- some of us wanted mutton and some chicken so had to order both. We tried each of it and both were equally good. 
5. Mutton kosha - thick and a good portion of juicy mutton tasted great with the biryani
6. Chicken kosha - the thick gravy of chicken kosha made me have a greater portion of the dish
They don't take a long time to deliver the food and tasty food is always ready and fresh. The packaging, service, price , everything deserves special mention. Good biryani and Chinese at reasonable prices. What more do you want?

Krazy Biriyani surprised us when we ordered for home delivery in August. The whole process was hassle free and the taste of their food appreciated by all. Though, personally, I'm not a big fan of Biriyani I found the dish palatable. Alas, with growing popularity they've drastically increased their prices (almost doubled to be honest). I wish they'd maintain their standards without hiking up the prices of their items. Otherwise, it'd be a struggle in the competitive restaurant business.

Heard about this from zomato. Almost 3-4 times I used to pass by that outlet but never thought of it would be that good. Anyway decided to give it a try. It is only a take away joint. I ordered mutton biriyani. Thr mutton was nice and soft and juicy. The potato was well cooked. Overall the biriyani was good. It cost 150/- for a plate. Though I have to wait  bit which is generally not the case for othe take away biryani outlet. Obviously you can give it a try. It's good not awesome.

It was the first time we went to this place and trust me we travelled 30 kilometers to try their famous Mutton Handi Biryani. Our effort to reach there, didn't go to waste as they have the best Biryani we have ever tried in Kolkata. Be it the taste or the presentation they are the best in every way. After developing a palate for authentic hyderabadi Biryani it was quite impossible for me to get the same thing in Kolkata but to my surprise, it was a blend of Bengali and Hyderabadi flavour. We have tried several other places in Kolkata which are famous for their biryanis and they were a total disappointment for us but visit to this place made our day. The aroma of the Biryani was mouth watering. They have several  items in the menu which are worth a try. The pricing is also very reasonable keeping in mind the taste and quality of food you get.

The taste, texture and quality is at par or might say as well above par in comparison with best players in the market. I would totally recommend it to all my friends and food lovers who follow me. A big thumbs up to such a place. By the way - it is a takeaway joint totally. The guys there are very informal and friendly.

Is there really much to say about the Chicken Handi Biryani? Just amazing , and it was light as well in terms of oiliness. Will be coming back for more.

Disappointing. Probably was expecting way better food. Quantity wise okay. Taste wise not up to the mark. Make shift arrangements for sit-n-dine. Not properly ventilated even.

Have been hearing about this place a lot. I was craving for biriyani today, so I decided to order via Zomato. I placed an order for the special chicken biriyani. Also, I heard that it's better for a take away. 

The delivery guy was pretty well mannered. He lost his way and couldn't find my house. Somehow, after instructing him, he found my house and delivered the order. I got my food within half an hour. But unfortunately it became cold by the time the parcel reached me. I deducted some points for that.

Coming to the biriyani, it serves two people. 2 huge pieces of well prepared chicken, a big aloo and an egg. The rice was full of flavour. The chicken had the right amount of masala. It tasted yum. The aloo was properly boiled and got the flavours in it. The rice was long and fine. The price was higher than the normal roadside biriyani stalls. Since I ordered via Zomato, they charged Rs.220. But it was worth the money.

It was a huge leap of faith when I ordered one mutton handi biriyani and accompanying raita from a hitherto unknown place at about fifteen minutes past midnight, a few days back. Extremely hungry after a whole day's worth of medical internship duties, I opened up Zomato to see if there were any restaurants nearby that'd be delivering to my place and Krazy Biriyani was among the precious few that did.

40 minutes later, at 1 am, they dropped a huge 'handi' of steaming mutton biriyani at my doorstep. Boy, it was huge : good enough for 2-3 people. 3 pieces of succulent mutton, potatoes, boiled egg, glazed onions and spiced rice made for the perfect comfort food. 

Priced very reasonably, this is a gem of a place satiating the hunger of people at the oddest times in the best ways possible.

Well..Don't be fooled by it modest looks..This place serves some great biriyani and chaap...The place is ideal for takeaway or ordering in..The quantities are very good and the prices are reasonable ..The staff is very friendly and the delivery is prompt..This is a great alternative to any other well known biriyani outlets and will surely give them a run for their money. Ordered their biriyani 3 times and each time it was consistently good as was the chicken chaap accompaniment..The biriyani is just the way a biriyani ought to be. Tasty, not too oily, tender juicy meat, all the things that make a biriyani great..Keep up the good work.

I make sure to order from here for biryanis when I am treating friends. I am seriously crazy for it.

The biryanis are awesome and its bit different from the rest.

The sides of chicken chaap and mutton chaaps are great too. 

The haandi of the biryani can feed 2 and a half adults. It's amount is too much. 

The seller is honest. The food awesome!!

We decided to give this restaurant a try and as crazy as it sounds it turned out to be ah-mazing .

The restaurant is open to food delivery till 1 am at night hence I can quench my Biriyani thirst even at late night ü§£

For starters we had Dragon Chicken and Chilli Fish Dry along with Chicken Tikia Kebab .
Special mention for the Chilli fish dry as it tasted very delicate and lip smacking.

For the main course we had -

Mutton Handi Biryani ,
Chicken Handi Biryani ,
 Mutton Kosa ,
And Chicken Kosa.

All of the food was delicious and it had a very nice after taste .
I will definitely suggest this restaurant to you for the quality and quantity of their serving which is very adequate and proper .

Chicken biriyani and a combo of fried rice and chilly chicken..
The quantity was enough.
After reading the mixed reviews I was really confused but I must say that it was worth it.
The food was overall a bit spicy but it was fine for me. Quality is much more than a roadside food shop. I would recommend it if you want to taste good food within budget

Ordered one Chinese combo of schezwan fish and rice and one biryani. The delivery took 60 mins to reach. Coming to the food, the quantity if the food was very good, the rice in the combo wasn't cooked well the fish was melt in the mouth but the gravy was way too spicy for me. The Egg Biryani had some stale smell in it so had to throw most of it. Prices are very pocket friendly but the food isn't worth the hype. Not ordering again.

we ordered special mutton biriyani and chichek kasha for home delivery. ordering via zomato was smooth. they even allow customization (add extra alu/egg/mutton) for the biriyani you are ordering - wow!!
delivery was quick as i stay very close to them in jadavpur only. delivery person was courteous as he returned the exact change back.
biriyani was great. the aroma is devoid of the rose/keora water and thats what i liked most. mutton pieces were tender and well cooked. chicken side dish had very big pieces of chicken. however the gravy was too oily and spicy to my liking. for order like this (containing mughlai items), i wish they add some minimal salad (onion, cucumber, lime and chilies) complimentary.
overall, the food quality was good but there is scope for improvement.

Biryani is derived from the Persian word 'Birian'. In Farsi, Birian means 'Fried before Cooking‚Äô.Today Biryani is one of the most popular dish not only in India but the whole subcontinent.Personally as a gastronome I believe four thing makes a good biriyani,first one is the Aroma,second one,it should be savory but not spicy, third one is the proper cooking of meat and fourth one is appropriate selection of rice.Krazy Biryani paases all these criterias with distinction.Located in Jadavpur area this outlet is a gem.One Handi Biriyani is enough for three people comfortabely.This biryani is highly recommended for Kolkata‚Äôs biryani lovers.

In other items Dragon Chicken was amazingly tasty,chicken was soft and spicy,over the top.Chilli Fish Dry was delicious and crunchy,people will instantly love it.Mutton Kosha was enjoyable.You can try their Chicken kosha too with the rich gravy.Chicken tikka kebab could be better in taste.

A great restaurant promises to offer something that is not available elsewhere.Krazy Biryani delivers to your door till 1 AM. Being different is a good thing and it is a quality to look out for when choosing a restaurant. They have the potential to make it large and creating good image by serving appetizing and delicious food to the people of the city of joy.

I am totally bowled away by their food.Coming to the food, we had Chicken Tikia Kebab,Mutton Handi Biryani,Chicken Kosa,Dragon Chicken and Chilli Fish Dry. Loved the Chili Fish one- it was tasty and totally a lip-smacking dish. Chicken tikia kebab with the mint pudina chutney was nicely done and chicken kosha was rich and the chicken was beautifully cooked-it was soft and tender. The Dragon chicken was good too. Coming to biryani, the handi biryani was served in earthern pot and mind you it comes in a huge portion.The mutton was soft and juicy while the rice was beautiful. The arome of the biryani will take you to heaven. Had a wonderful experience. Oh yes, it is a takeway or delivery joint and they delivery food till 1am. Will i order from here again? Yes absolutely.

Ordered from Krazy Biriyani, jadavpur via zomato twice in 3 days to have some Biriyani. Delivery took around 30 minutes both the days.

‚óè Chicken Special Biriyani: It had 2 pieces of chicken, one egg, one potato, and biriyani rice. It wasn't excellent, but was ok. Quantity was for 1.5 people! It was quite a good deal wrt the price range. Rating: 3.6/5

‚óè Mutton Handi Biriyani: Came with a big Handi pot. Quantity was huge, enough for 3 people. Had 1 egg, 2 potatoes & 3 pieces of Mutton, one of them was good, the other 2 wasn't. This time the Biriyani rice was pretty oily. But, the biggest let down was the doubtful hygiene. The handi pot wasn't clean, parts of the Biriyani rice had dust, soil like texture & it wasn't a good experience. Rating: 2/5

Two days, two completely different experiences.

Light scented and hygienic too. Very nice. The quality of the mutton is pure class. Coming to the mango lassi, I didn't like it much. But okay for the first try. Later will order plain lassi only. Pocket pinch is not much. Highly recommended. Give it a shot guys.

I checked for restaurants in vicinity, and found it on Zomato. Wanted to check out the food owing to it good rating from so many reviews. The taste of biriyani is really good, and much better than some famous restaurants. The only 2 factors for which it is not a perfect 5, is outlet is only for delivery or take away, and they do not have any tandoor/kabab items.

A bit over hyped but good food. The special handi biryani and the normal biryani has no difference. Tastes exactly the same. But overall, price for quamtity and quality is reasonable. Overall, good place.

I ordered 2 special biryanis from this place. Total =‚Çπ370/- . So, it was pretty good price point.
Pretty good food. The food wasn't the best biryani I ever had, but was better than most. The quantity was more than enough for the 3 of us. (Disclaimer: I don't eat much. In terms of quantity, that is). 
 Delivered on time.
 However, the lower rating is because of the bad packaging and delivery guy. 
Bad packaging cuz it was in a paper box, and by the time it was delivered the box was soaking wet. Now, I cannot tell you specifically if it was because of the rain, or the steam/oil from the food or the culmination of all the reasons above. However, I did not expect such abysmal packing from them at all. 
Also, though the delivery guy was friendly, he doesn't keep change with him which meant I had to climb back up to my apartment, look into every nook and cranny to get the change. Super annoying. If you're delivering, I'm pretty sure you know the total, so why wouldn't you keep the change for a ‚Çπ500/- note?

After reading so many positive reviews about this place, I decided to try it out. I ordered Dum Handi Biriyani and chicken chaap. But even though I placed the order the day before and specified the time by which I wanted the food to be delivered (I wanted it by 2 in the afternoon), upon calling them at 1:40 I was told that the delivery guy had not yet left. As it is, they open their shop quite late. So finally I got my food at 2:30.
The quantity was a lot. The rice tasted fine, if a bit towards the bland side. But what surprised me was that I got NO whiff of the trademark Biriyani aroma. 
The chicken chaap was okay, but a bit too oily.

I finally had the chance and perfect occasion to order from krazy biryani,  I heard so many good reviews about it so I decided to order their special Murg dum handi biryani and it was a treat. I can safely say that I have had the best biryani in kolkata. Its cooked in good quality desi ghee which feels light in your mouth, the chicken is cooked to the perfection and my most favourite part about biryanis is the alu hidden under the mountain of rice and he'll it was juicy. Meal so good u feel u r in heaven. The rice melts in your mouth and it has the perfect Biryani texture. Please try it out guys you won't regret it.  All the best wishes to thus tiny biryani corner.

Heard a lot about this place. So ordered special mutton biriyani, veg pulao and mutton kasha. The delivery was within time. The person over the phone answered all the questions very politely. 
The special biriyani had 2 large pieces of mutton , egg and potato. The rice was very flavourful, mutton was well cooked and spiced. Veg pulao had lots of veggies and on a sweeter side. It was bit oily. The mutton kasha was very tasty and mutton pieces were very good. Minimum bones soild meat. 
Price to quantity ans quality ratio is great. A must place of you plan for a small house get together.

Ordered for chicken chaap through zomato with the specs/request of a bit more gravy than usual..
And as informed of 2 pieces of chicken..

The gravy was too oily..More than the gravy there was oil in it and the pieces were smaller than a babies palm..And was meat less only bones..

Only the delivery boy was the best thing in the whole association with you guys..2 stars r for him..

Please give people what they are paying for..

I was looking for a pocket-friendly experience and tried ordering from Zomato for the first time. I ordered a Gosht Handi Biriyani. Zomato provided a complimentary Strawberry Shake.
The food arrived on time. The delivery boy was courteous enough.
I was happy so far. However, instead of 3 mutton pieces as expected, it had 2 mutton pieces and the 3rd was a chicken piece. It must have been an honest mistake but I was dissapointed after waiting for more than 1 hour and ordering from Zomato for the first time. Also, I should mention, the Biriyani rice was average to say the least. Nothing extraordinary. It would have been value for money, had they not messed up the piece.

Me and my friend were searching for a pocket friendly place to takeaway some food when we came across this tiny joint. Though it looked absolutely uninviting, we were too tired to let the place pass and hopped right in. The menu was quite extensive.

The Mutton Handi Biryani seemed to be a fancy choice and so we decided to go for it. My friend decided to go for their Chinese cuisines too as she was a little skeptical about their biryani. So from their Chinese section we ordered Chilly Fish with gravy, Chilly Chicken dry, Mixed Hakka Noodles and Mixed Fried Rice.

Upon reaching home, everyone pounced on the food and was quite happy to find that the quantity was good enough.

My personal favourites among all the items were the Handi Biryani which was cooked in ghee and came accompanied with an egg and juicy mutton pieces. If you are bored of the same old traditional biryani, then do NOT skip this. The Chilly Fish was also great. The pieces were extremely soft and succulent with no smell whatsover. Definitely a win! The Hakka Noodles was perfectly cooked too with plenty of chicken and prawns in it.

Overall this place turned out to be a perfect example of the famous saying "never judge a book by its cover". Looking forward to ordering again.

Not to be fooled by it's name but this place servers some amazing biryani in a pocket friendly price. 
Need not to say, I have been hearing about this place for a such a long time now. Thus, today in a very short notice when some of my friends dropped by I thought it's better to try out this place. And I must say all of our tummies were happy. 

We ordered,
1. Mutton handi biryani- well the place is famous for its handi biryani and this one particular dish you wouldn't want  to miss. Good portion of rice with 3 piece of chicken, aloo and egg. 

Since some friends wanted to have Chinese we ordered Chinese aswell.

2. Mix Hakka noodles- the noodles were good have a decent quantity. 
3. Chilli fish gravy - the chilly fish gravy was amazing 
4. Mix fried rice 
5. Dry chilli chicken. 


The delivery and packing was absolutely perfect.
And they delivered it hot and fresh to satisfy our tummies :D 

P.S definitely try the handi biryani 
Highly recommended. 

Cheers!

A biryani that's completely different from the traditional Kolkata Biryani. I, personally, am a sucker for Kolkata Biryani, and don't like any other kind. But, this pleasantly blew my mind! Their biryani was totally different, you'd find the smell of Rose Water missing, which has been gracefully exchanged by the aromatic smell of Ghee. The pieces of Mutton were extremely soft, smooth and silky! 

I don't know about the other items on the menu, but guys, do not miss this!

Horrible experience ordering from here. Had to wait for 2.5 hours to get my delivery. The restaurateur was confused as to where my order was.. also the delivery boy lost his way. After calling the restaurant numerous times to inquire about my order I was told they ran out of biriyani and had to cook everything from scratch. I would have been fine with waiting since‚Äã I ordered on a Sunday and could understand the restaurant's plight in that regard. But I would have REALLY appreciated someone calling and informing me instead of letting me fend for my myself. At one point I really thought I had to get into the kitchen and start cooking dinner myself. When the biriyani did arrive I was surprised  and super disappointed to find the pieces of chicken were super small and filled with fat.. the rice and nice and light.. one of the potatoes I had gotten in the biryani was rotten.
Super disappointed.. and will never order again.

Went by the review. Ordered for thupka and chowmein. The delivery boy (I thought we was not more than 16-17years old) made quite a mess in finding the house and thus the delivery reached by almost 45minutes after the scheduled time.
Coming to the food quality it was so so....but up to the rating put by zomato.
Not satisfying in a whole.

It was a good experience with krazy biryani jadavpur outlet. I have tasted mutton biryani, chicken kosha. Biryani was not something exceptional but good in taste and less oily compare to few other restaurent. Quantity is very good means 1 biryani is more than enough for a single person. Chicken kosha was also very good in taste, pieces size is comparatively better.

Very late delivery. Restaurant was unreachable even after one and half hours of ordering. Biriyani was awesome though. Perfectly cooked with tender chicken and mutton pieces. Found the potato a bit undercooked.
 Quantity more than sufficient. Two people can actually eat from the half portion they offer. Best deal at the price in it's area.
Only delivery should be improved.

Everything was delivered smoking hot and fresh... At this price point it's really great value for money!! Four and half stars... I could have given 5 stars had the chicken in chilli chicken been a little bit softer. But overall happily recommend this restaurant... Yummm!!!

Ordered from here a couple of times after seeing the high ratings on Zomato. The handi biryani is worth the money - very moderately priced, it fed 3 of us and there was still enough portion left for one more person. It was quite tasty too. The half portions of the biryani are also quite a lot in quantity and very inexpensive. Have also tried the crispy chilli honey chicken which is sweet, spicy and very crispy!

Dont know where this restaurant is but really in love with their mutton handi biryani. Ordered food through swiggy and it was really an excitement when I saw their handi biryani- a huge earthen pot wrapped with aluminium foil. It contained 3pieces of soft mutton pieces with one egg and 2pieces of famous ' biryani aloo.'..the amount of rice was huge, sufficient for two or may be for three. The taste was good with well mixed herbs and flavour. We also ordered their chicken kasha.It was also tasty and was a good accompaniment. Loved the experience.

I know the pictures say otherwise but trust me they do serve the best Biryani in town. Ordered for an office party, because it was a bulk amount the owner Mr Vikram was kind enough to take my order. He delivered the food on time. The handi biryani was made purely out of ghee. All my office colleagues fell in love with their food. The chicken tikka kebab and the kasa were done brilliantly. One of the few shops I saw that did not oversell their product just to earn a quick buck! I had ordered for 3 handis and a extra packet to be on the safe side for 7 of us but he did not get the extra one. he told me that 3 handis would be sufficient for 7 people. And he was correct. There was an entire portion left which I packed and took home. A must try for all foodies.
P.S. all my photos got deleted otherwise I could have shown the beautiful handi. :)Also at 260 Rs per Handi with 3 chunky mutton pieces are a complete steal!

We ordered take-away from this place recently. It was for a small get-together!
The things we ordered were:
Gosht Handi Dum Biriyani

Mutton Kosha
Chilli Fish (gravy)

Chicken Fried Rice

Mixed Noodles
The fried rice and the mixed noodles were amazing. The sheer quantity was more than enough to impress us. The taste was good.
The chilli fish was tender and delicious. The gravy added to the pleasure.
The mutton kosha was too filling and tender. The quantity was huge, and the gravy was simply awesome!
The Biryani was perhaps the best among the lot !!!! Huge quantity, amazing fragrance and a perfect blend of spices and condiments to make the evening perfect :) Totally recommend it.

I am so happy that this place has opened up in my locality and they deliver to my address as well. Yesterday, I came to Katjunagar at a friend‚Äôs house when we ordered food from Krazy Biryani. This is a take away joint and also works through online food delivery system. The delivery time period was really short and packaging was very good.
We had ordered ‚Äì
Mixed Noodles ‚Äì The typical Indian Chinese kind of noodles but tasted very good.
Kung Pao Fish Dry ‚Äì Looked yummy. There were ten big pieces. Liked it.
Chilli Fish Gravy ‚Äì The gravy was okayish but the fish tasted nice. Coating could have been thinner.
The Chinese dishes were average but what blew my mind was there amazing Indian food. Hence such high rating. 
We had ‚Äì
Chicken Tikka Kebabs ‚Äì Goodness! They were so good. Chicken was solid and marination was perfect. Loved the fried onions served along with.
Chicken Handi Biryani ‚Äì You will not believe until you see the size of the handi. It claims to feed three people but it can feed more when all have a moderate appetite. Big pieces of chicken, potato and eggs topped with fried onions and candied Mediterranean plums, I loved it. Just a suggestion, that the intensity of keora jol essence can be reduced.
Mutton Kosha ‚Äì The gravy was thick and rich. Too good. The mutton pieces were big and succulent and the portion was commendable.
Overall experience was pretty good. I recommend this place. Chinese is good but Indian is better. I am definitely going to order Indian for myself from here sometime soon. Happy Dining!

Planning for a get together? Confused about what to order and from where? looking for some good Chinese? Oh not to forget, you want biriyani too for your guests right? Well Krazy biriyani sorted my evening with their lip-smacking delicacies ranging from authentic Chinese to aromatic biriyani's and kebabs, not to forget the economical rates and the timely delivery.

The chicken handi biriyani is one particular dish you wouldn't want to miss. The portion of rice they serve is enormous coupled with three pieces of chicken, one potato and one egg, a show stopper of a dish. The biriyani generates an aroma which itself speaks volumes about the quality and taste! The chicken chaap which we had ordered turned put to the perfect side dish, unparalleled in quality and quantity, along with the chicken tikia kebab which was served in generous proportions! Krazy as it can get!

Not to be fooled by the name, this place serves some lip-smacking Chinese delicacies too and they mean business! The quantity and quality were overwhelming. The kung pao fish stood out for me followed by the chilli fish gravy - the fish was soft, the proportion of spices were apt, not overly spicy thankfully! The mixed rice and noodles were good too, not too oily and neither too salty!

A special mention for the care which they put in for the packaging! Thumbs up to this place.

The name 'Krazy Biriyani' had been doing the rounds for sometime now, and I was really eager to try it out. Many might disapprove my Bengali inheritance, considering the fact that am not a 'krazy' Biriyani lover, but am always searching for new places that would make me believe otherwise.

So, here goes my order for the day:
1. Kung Pao Fish
2. Chilli Fish (gravy)
3. Chicken Fried Rice
4. Mixed Noodles

I had the notion that a restaurant primarily famous for its Biriyani won't do justice to the Chinese dishes, but well, I wasn't much disappointed. The Fish went quite well with the noodles, but mind you, the food is a little oily. So if you're not fond of excessive spices, you might want to order something else.

Coming to the Indian dishes,
1. Murgh and Gosht Handi Dum Biriyani
2. Chicken and Mutton Kosha

The reason for my high rating is definitely, their HUMONGOUS quantity, and am not exaggerating one bit when I use that word. For a person like me whose appetite is quite limited when it comes to North Indian delicacies, am sure one Handi is big enough to serve nearly 3-4 people quite well ! The meat pieces are well-cooked, and you will not miss your favourite aloo. The only complaint I have against them is the excess use of oil in the Biriyani which makes it's presence felt with every spoonful. The side-dishes are also perfect for the foodie Bangali.

Overall, the place is definitely making it's mark in the Kolkata food scene, and if they work a little more on their quality, am sure they will come out with flying colours.

Ordered food for a Sunday Dinner. Murgh Dum Handi Biryani is what we ordered.I'd say it was huge quantity wise but quality was so-so. And I stress on the word huge! They serve the dish in a large earthern pot ( in Bengali its Haari) and the quantity is enough for 3-4 grown-ups. It costs 250 bucks and its worth it that way. But the quality was quite average I must say. My mother first pointed out that the salt was less and then I also felt so. Also, the flavour, the smell which makes a Biryani such a valued dish, the noor of Mughlai delicacies wasn't there. They had compensated the lack of these with large pieces of aloo and chicken. But then again, the chicken weren't that well-cooked. I didn't like the taste of the pieces particularly. And, another thing it was oily more than I find in other places. The rating might have gone higher if it didn't disappoint me quality wise. The extra .5 that I have given, which otherwise it would have stuck at 3, is because of the voluminous quantity of course.

Ordered food from here for several times and was blessed to have their food and prompt service. Aptly named the biryani can turn you crazy with its flavor & atoma and when it comes in quite a low price. Quality is impeccably good. Other items like red oriental rice or spicy green rice, the starters were neither disappointing. Quantity is not huge but sufficient to make tummy happy.Tribal mutton was not extraordinary but good whereas the lassi seemed superficially flavoured with overdose of syrups. But for biryani I would rather prefer this joint.

Krazy Biryani....! 

Well trust me, the name does total justice to the food served there. 

I can't really remember the number of times I've ordered food from here, because whenever I want to have Biryani, the choice is obvious. The Chicken Handi Biryani here is out of this world. The Aroma, the look, the packaging, oh...! I got a watery mouth just by thinking of the food.
Ok, it just got a little overwhelming for me now, Im gonna have to call Vicky (He runs the place) to order my Handi Biryani. 
Ok my Biryani is on my way,  yay....! 
The Handi Biryani as the name suggests, is packaged in a Earthen Handi with 1piece egg, 3 large pieces of chiken, and 2 pieces of potato. It can easily feed 3 persons and is ideal if u're throwing a party at your place. The Biryani is prepared in ghee, and as you open the cover of the Handi, you get engulfed by the aroma and you might get tempted to eat it out of the earthen Handi itself without serving it on a plate, because believe me, it is going to make your insides churn with hunger. The Biryani is not at all dry, it is moist with ghee which gives your sense of smell, a treat. 
I've also have ordered other chicken and vegetarian items from Krazy Biryani and the quality is supreme. Whenever I throw parties at my place I order food from here, and the delivery time,  quality of food, and the personal touch are beyond what u'd expect. 

And you know what makes this place what it is....? It is the person who runs the place. I've come to know that he is crazy about food and is an amazing cook himself. He cooks with passion at home and at his work, has great presentation skills and is innovative with food. 

I know I could go on and on about Krazy Biryani because I am a fan and the food here has made me Krazy. So whoever reads this, give the Handi Biryani a chance and I promise it'll redefine your perception of what kind of Biryani deserves to enter your mouth. 

Hats off to you Vicky. Like I've said many times before, I'm a fan.

Heared lots of buzz recently from my fellow foodie friends on Social Media. So finally I placed an order of 3 Chicken Handi Biryani for 4 people. They delivered within 60 mins.
I shocked to see when I opened the handi because the quantity was enormous. 1 handi of biryani contains 3 big and soft pcs of chickens, 2 potato and lots of rice..
Taste was fantastic and the aroma was superb. Kudos to the chef.

Its quite a lot of time i have ordered food from here.
And always been impressed by the quality of food.
Would like to list some of the food that i ordered-
1.Biryani
2.Mutton and chicken chap
3.Singapore noodles 
3.Pasta with white sauce(chicken)
4.Lemon coriander chicken soup
5.Chilli chicken
6.Thai grilled fish
All of these fulfilled my expectation.
But two days back i had "handi biryani" .
Handi with 3 piece of mutton, 1 egg, 1 big piece of potato and the quantity of rice can feed 3 people easily. 
Talking about the taste - the moment i opened the cover..the aroma was self sufficient to say "HAVE ME, I AM DELICIOUS !! " 
#The fried onions and the fine quality of rice 
#The huge pieces of mutton 
Acted as the cherry on the cake.
Had a wonderfull experience ordering food from here.

Krazy Biryani....! 

Well trust me, the name does total justice to the food served there. 

I can't really remember the number of times I've ordered food from here, because whenever I want to have Biryani, the choice is obvious. The Chicken Handi Biryani here is out of this world. The Aroma, the look, the packaging, oh...! I got a watery mouth just by thinking of the food.
Ok, it just got a little overwhelming for me now, Im gonna have to call Vicky (He runs the place) to order my Handi Biryani. 
Ok my Biryani is on my way,  yay....! 
The Handi Biryani as the name suggests, is packaged in a Earthen Handi with 1piece egg, 3 large pieces of chiken, and 2 pieces of potato. It can easily feed 3 persons and is ideal if u're throwing a party at your place. The Biryani is prepared in ghee, and as you open the cover of the Handi, you get engulfed by the aroma and you might get tempted to eat it out of the earthen Handi itself without serving it on a plate, because believe me, it is going to make your insides churn with hunger. The Biryani is not at all dry, it is moist with ghee which gives your sense of smell, a treat. 
I've also have ordered other chicken and vegetarian items from Krazy Biryani and the quality is supreme. Whenever I throw parties at my place I order food from here, and the delivery time,  quality of food, and the personal touch are beyond what u'd expect. 

And you know what makes this place what it is....? It is the person who runs the place. I've come to know that he is crazy about food and is an amazing cook himself. He cooks with passion at home and at his work, has great presentation skills and is innovative with food. 

I know I could go on and on about Krazy Biryani because I am a fan and the food here has made me Krazy. So whoever reads this, give the Handi Biryani a chance and I promise it'll redefine your perception of what kind of Biryani deserves to enter your mouth. 

Hats off to you Vicky. Like I've said many times before, I'm a fan.

We Bengalis take our Biriyanis very seriously. So when Krazy Biriyani's name started coming up, we just needed to try out the food from that place.
We had a long list of items ordered to our home. Delivery was prompt and the packagings of the items were neatly done.
We started off our lunch with Swezwan Prawn Dry, which was fairly tasty. Next, we had both Chicken Noodles and Fried Rice with Chilli Fish Gravy. The gravy was done nicely and it went well with the rice and the noodle.
Once we were done with that, we moved on to our Indian menu which included Chicken Tikia Kebab, which by the way, is best when eaten with a pinch of lemon juice on it. Murgh Handi Dum Biriyani was our main course- a generous chicken piece and aloo served in a bed of delicious, spiced up rice. Make sure you give these items a go. Bon appetit!

I tried this place a long ago... And as far I remember I liked their food pretty much... Their ambience n d√©cor is not at all good... But who cares when one can some delicious food in handsome quantity in some very pocket friendly price??? Yes... Most of the foodies like us don't care about ambience, higen, staffs behavior etc... When we use to get some food like this... And obviously when your party mood is on and you are suffering from money crunch... "Krazy Biryani" should be one of your option for sure...

We tried their...
1. üíù Murgh handi dum biryani~ Awesome... A must try over here...
2. Mutton Kosa~ Extremely tasty...
3. Mix Chilli Garlic Noodles~ Quite decent...
4. Mix Fried Rice~ Very good one...
5. Chilli Fish Gravy~ Just wow...
6. Shezwan Prawn Dry~ Heavenly... Another recommend dish from here...
7. Crispy Fried Chicken Strips~ This upset us a bit... But we ignored it...
8. Fresh Lime Soda~ Very refreshing... Gone well with the combinations...
9. Green Mango Fizz~ Decent one... We had a mixed feelings regarding this one... Some liked it... Some don't...

Whatever... We enjoyed a lot... And we had to be... When we had such Krazy tasty pocket friendly food form such a Krazy place... Give it a try na...

Since i am crazy for biryani and this place was coming up quite often in my feeds i decided to try it out with friends. 
Delivery was quick and the dishes were nearly packed and arrived quite hot. 
Lets start with the most famous dish of this place
The Handi Biryani (mutton) 
A huge handi with 3 pieces of mutton and 1 egg and 1 big piece of that tender potato. The quantity itself pleased me. And once it was served the smell was enough to say its going to be yummy. And it was. The mutton pieces specially where very juicy and soft. 
The chicken kasa which was an accompaniment was also quite good. But i focused on the biryani more. 
This place also offers Chinese. If you dont want to experiment just go ahead and order the chilli fish and fried ride. Very yummy. And perfect for a very reasonable lunch. 
Also tried the kesar basam milkshake which was quite good.

I am a die hard fan of biriyani. And obviously this kiosk is a great choice for my love. 
Very near to where I stay. We ordered in the food. 
Must say, prompt delivery and the food was brought it hot!! We settled for the following in mughlai :

‚ö´Mutton handi biriyani - amazing quantity. Will suffice 3 adults. It has 3-4 pieces of mutton along with aloo and an egg. 
‚ö´Mutton kasha - must say delectable pieces of 
mutton, tender and stuffed with flavours. Loved the rich gravy. 
‚ö´Chicken kosha - juicy pieces of chicken in a thick rich  light yellow gravy. Loved it! 
‚ö´Kesar badam milk shake - the best ending to the mughlai meal. 

For chinese, (yes they serve that too) we ordered for : 
‚ö´schezuan prawns - Amazing. Tasty, juicy, good size of prawns. Full of flavour. 
‚ö´ chilli fish - dark soy gravy, and tender fresh pieces of fish , succulent. Impeccable it was. 
‚ö´ chicken fried rice and noodles - satisfactory preparations. You sure won't be disappointed.

Krazy Biryani is a new Biryani joint in town and the food is just delicious. 
We ordered the food home. 

The place serves both Mughlai and chinese food. I would prefer the mughlai over Chinese. 

*Mutton dum Biryani - We ordered the handi Biryani which serves 3 pieces of mutton, 1 egg and 1 aloo. The quantity is amazing , and the taste is impeccable. 

*Schezuan Prawn: The prawns were delicious. 

*Mutton Kosa : The mutton was packed with flavour and it's a must have ! 

*Chicken Kosa : Equally good as the mutton. Loved it. 

*Kesar badam milkshake : perfect addition to the shahi lunch ! Love it !

So I've been hearing a lot about the Handi Biryani of this place. Finally ordered it along with a starter and sides. We also wanted to try a bit of their Chinese items and wasn't disappointed at all!

Packaging was decent. Dry dishes came in the foil containers while gravy dishes came in the plastic containers. The Biryani, as expected, came in a big mud handi with it's top covered with aluminium foil to keep it warm.

The starter of Chicken Tikia Kebab's taste was not upto the mark. The amount of salt in it was unbearable.
The Murgh Handi Dum Biryani was undoubtedly delicious! The rice had fried onions in it to my liking. Not sure about the chicken in it cause I couldn't taste one.
I had a piece from the Chicken Kosha, which I felt was average.

Mixed Hakka Noodles was very decent. But the Mixed Fried Rice was better!
Loved the Shezwan Prawn Dry! My pick of the lot. Too good!
The Chili Fish Gravy was good too. The quality of fish was great, there was no smell whatsoever!
The Kesar Badam Milkshake was fine. Could've been a little thicker! It was a bit light for me.

Overall, a good experience. Too good for a small joint like it is. Although, not a small joint anymore. Their Handi Biryani is rapidly becoming famous all over the town!

Summing up the overall experience into two parts. Delivery and Food Experience.
Delivery:
1. Prompt delivery and before expected time

Food:
Ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Hunan Chicken.
1. Ordered 2 and a 1/2 plate of fried rice. Got a delivery of one big box and a small box half the size of the former one. Don't know if they delivered 1 and1/2 plate. If Yes, very poor order processing system, if Not, quantity of Chinese food item not that great.
2. Hunan chicken was good, can't say great. Good in terms of quantity, good in terms of taste. Just like any other local chinese eatery.
3. Sweet and sour chicken was just too sour. Quantity was good, but taste was confusing. The dish was so sour that I couldn't figure out the exact taste. Sweet and sour chicken is supposed to be sour, but this was over the top.

Would recommend to followup with the outlet, regarding order and double check the same. Otherwise, easy on the pocket. Give it a try if you really want to have some chinese desperately within a tiny budget.

Ordered Murgh Handi Biriyani from them via Swiggy. It was served in an earthen pot which was really big. And the quantity was also huge. The amount of Biriyani they serve will be more than enough for 2 grownups and a kid. Coming to the taste, the Biriyani was oily and greasy. Even though I am not a big fan of oily Biriyani, this time I just loved it. They really know how to cook. But I couldn't understand why they put fried onion in the Biriyani. Nevertheless, the taste was good and that is all that matters.

The food reached us,the quantity of the handi biriyani was unbelievable,sufficient for 3 people, taste was good,not great,but the main problem was-may b the handi was Not clean,the biriyani had dust,soil like texture, that was disappointing,most of It was inedible. The chicken  side dish was OK.Quantity is huge but u guys should maintain cleanliness and hygiene.

Krazy Biryani is one of those names which I heard quite a few number of times from my friends. As the name suggests the their Biryani is their speciality.
Went to one of my friends place and ordered food from here.
Orderd:
# Mix Fried Rice
# Mix Chilli Garlic Noodles
# Schezwan Prawn Dry
# Chilli Fish Gravy
# Mutton Handi
# Mutton Kasa

The Chinese Items were good but what caught everyone's attention was The Handi Biryani and The Mutton Kasa. The aroma and taste of Biryani was exquisite, the mutton pieces in the kasa were really good. Tender Juicy and really good in taste.
The pocket pinch was really reasonable comparing the quality and quantity of the food.

A definite 4/5 for this place

Heard a lot about this place from my friends and tonight we ordered some krazy foodstuffs at my friend's place. We ordered Mutton Handi Dum Biryani, chicken Handi Dum Biryani, Mutton Kosa,  chicken Kosa, sezwaan prawn Dry, Mixed chow, and crispy fried chicken. All stuffs are great. As the name suggests "Krazy Biryani"  this place is for krazy Biryani lovers. Their Handi Dum Biryani was awesome with great taste, amazing quantity at reasonable price. Service was good as order arrived soon. Also ordered a beverage "green mango fizz" but the taste didn't match the expectations. Overall great experience.

*Starters*
‚ú©Crispy Fried Chicken Strips(9/10): Delicious strips of crispy and crunchy chicken. Not oily, brilliant starter. 

‚ô°Schezwan Prawn Dry(8/10): Being on the spicy side, it's the way I like it. Palatable, tender  prawns. Good size, no smell. You'd love this if you love spicy starters or just tell them to make it less or no spicy. 

*Mains*
Mutton Handi Biryani(7.5/10): That quantity was huge for the price. Can serve 3 easily, comes with an egg. The rice is delicious and aromatic, a bit oily. Gets a strong flavor from the spices. The piece of Mutton had a raw-ish smell. (You can try the chicken one if you don't wanna risk it).

‚ú©Chicken Kasa(8/10): Decently sized, brilliantly cooked pieces of chicken. Oily but flavorful gravy trickles the tastebuds, its Love! 

‚ú©Mixed Fried Rice(9/10): This one was my favorite, I liked this more than the biryani. Wish I had the biryani first and F. Rice after. Serves 2. Remarkable!

‚ú©Mixed Chilli Garlic Noodles(9/10): Even though I'm not a big fan of Noodles for dinner, I loved this too. Serves 2. Reasonable and tasty.

‚òÖChilli Fish Gravy(9.5/10): Another remarkable side dish. Brilliantly cooked pieces of fish, no bad smell. A must try on your next order. The gravy is YUM! Awesomeness is here foodies! ‚òÖ

>Drinks< 
Green Mango Fizz(6.5/10): Tastes good only if its highly chilled. Tastes like Kachcha Mango Bite. 

Fresh Lime Soda(5/10): Nope! 

Delivery 9/10

Ordered home delivery from here at a get together tonight. The order arrived promptly and the food was hot. I was impressed by the food here. What we ordered was:
Mixed Fried Rice
Mixed Chilli Garlic noodles
Crispy Chicken Strips
Schezuan Prawn Dry
Chilli Fish
Chicken Handi Biryani
Mutton Handi Biryani
Mutton Kassandra
Chicken Kassandra
Onion raita
The Chinese items were good. I quite liked the chilli fish and the chicken strips. But the Handi Biryani was amazing...!! For a small shop which mostly delivers it's food, the quality of biryani was far superior. The quantity and quality served for the price is too good. I would recommend everyone to try the biryani from here. The mughlai gravy items were also quite tasty. Had a lovely and hearty dinner thanks to Krazy Biryani :-)

Well well, this place has been in my list since quite a few weeks.
Finally managed to get its taste tonight and I wasn't disappointed at all!
Their longlist menu keeps your pocket in mind and that's the best part I would sayüòâ
Curry is wild n wonderful doused in thick sauces.
Had tried out both the Chinese and Indian cuisine and they were equally good.
I would cast an extra vote for their handi dum biryani though. ‚ù§
My favourites were Schezwan prawn and chilli garlic noodles among Fried rice,noodles, crispy fried chicken, chilli fish gravy.
Here ends the list of Chinese delicacies.
Among the Indian dishes I just ‚ù§ their Mutton biryani. The mutton was perfectly cooked..so soft and yummy! Chicken kosha was fine as well.
Drinks were okayish. Fresh lime soda was much needed post dinner. Green mango fizz was quite plain.

Ordered Chicken Special Biryani, Chilli Paneer and Tribal Mutton Curry.
All were excellent. Before ordering though, I was a little bit curious about the Tribal Mutton Curry... Haha! Needless to say I fell in love with both the name and the dish.
The delivery was on time. The quality and price of food is very good. Overall I had a great First Time experience.
I'd recommend you all this outlet, if you're not Krazy. ; -D

I was having a Party at my ace and decided to order food from Krazy biriyani. I've crossed this outlet many a times in Jadavpur(adjacent to China Green) but have never tasted anything from here.

So our order was :

*Chicken and mutton handi biriyani : Amazing. For the price, it is one of the best biriyanis I've had in that price bracket. One handi is more than enough for 2 super hard core foodies.

*Mutton Kasa : Rich and divine. The mutton was cooked to perfection. I loved this.

*Chicken tikia kebab : I liked this a loot. The tikia were moist and aromatic.

Delivery was pretty quick as well.

Ordered home delivery at a friends place in golf green.The restaurant is not apt for sit down experience thus home delivery is the way to go.
Food ordered were chicken biryani, schezwan fish and rose milkshake, chicken tikia , mutton kassa and kesar badam milkshake
All of the above were good and were up to the expectation. The chicken tikia was just fantabulous. Mutton kassa was soft and succulent with a lovely gravy accompanying it.kesar badam milkshake is a must try from here.
What blew my mind was the quantity of the biryani. 250 bucks and they give you a whole handi which can easily serve 3.
So good job team krazy biryani.
Would recommend for home delivery.

We do trust renowned names and popular places when it comes to food, but somewhere we forget about small joints which are nothing less than how we see them. Just like that Jadavpur has this small gem hidden where food wonders happens. Krazy Biryani not only serves you some amazing Biryani but they have a variety full of menu which will surely leave in two minds of what to take or what to leave.

As mentioned above krazy biryani was on the cards as the food order was concerned. It was a friend's meet ¬†at friend's house at Haltu where we assembled for some chill and fun time and to enjoy the IPL match together. The order was pretty long but cut short as it was very difficult to make a decision. So the orders were:

1. Chicken Handi Biryani : ¬†It is always different from what we have on the regular basis and i truly found the justice with this too. A proper Handi Biryani with the divine flavour ¬†with excellent taste. Potato was soft and cooked properly and the meat was juicy.¬†

2. Mutton Kasa : Mouth watering! yes indeed Mouth watering it was. Spicy is the better word to describe it. Mutton was soft and juicy breaking with ease. I could see the oil floating over which surely gave me some happy feeling.

3. Pan Fried Chilli Chicken : Marination was the key and it was done beautifully. Softness and smoothness. Delicate.

4. Mix Ginger Bell Pepper Fried Rice : Took it for a tasting purpose which surely didn't disappoint me as well.¬†

A compact order delivered in time with proper packing. Prices are fairly charged. A great Experience with them. And the Biryani will make you Krazy for sure.
All the best Team Krazy Biryani.

If you are looking for Biryani this is the spot. I recently took delivery from this outlet and their Handi Biryani was just fantastic. Chicken Handi for Rs.250 and Mutton Handi for Rs.270. Both comes in a huge quantity and tastes brilliant.
Also their Mutton Kasa was very good.
I have also tried few items from their Chinese menu.
* Mixed Singapore Noodles : Was below average. Didn't like it at all.
* Mixed Ginger Bell Peper Fried Rice : This was good in taste.
* Pan Fried Chilli Chicken : Good
.
They also have a collection of drinks.
I had the 
* Rose Lassi
* Kesar Badam Milk - both of them were good.

As they say 'Crazy ' Biryani.  
Was excited to taste the biryani if this very heard of place for ' Brilliant Biryani'

We Ordered It As a Home delivery .
Drinks - 

Kesar Badam Milk Shake - 
The flavour of Badam And Kesar is something you will love it. Very Flavourfull.
 Food - 

Chicken Tikia Kebab - Nice. Very good in taste and quite a nice quantity.  

Chicken in butter Garlic sauce - Something new and something delightfull. This is not something very good but surely it wont dissapoint.  

Mix Ginger Bell Pepper Fried Rice-
 Loved it comepletely. Quality was very good. 

Pan Fried Chilli Chicken - Wow. Delicious. 

Mix Singapore Noodle - This was a disappointment among all. The other dishes are so good that this came up as a disaster. Very Tasteless . 

The Mughlai Section - 
This section is something i would call a ' Happy Package ' 

The Special Chicken Handi Biryani - 
WOW,  The Quantity as well as the quality. 
A Perfect Handi Dum Biryani. Very very good with Taste and an absolute delight. 

Mutton Kossa-
Again. Excellent. 
Very flavourfull and Very fitting. 


Pocket Pinch is not very high and is comparatively Reasonable. 

Here, I would like to suggest that the Indian and Mughlai is Excellent.
But again they little improvement with the chinese here.

Tried this place for the first time and ended up with a pathetic experience! We ordered fish in oyster sauce and mixed fried rice via swiggy and received stale food. The fish used was not Basa and was stinking while the prawns in the fried rice were almost raw. Thankfully swiggy came to our rescue and got us food from another place as compensation.

This was by far the worst food ever...
Ordered tribal mutton and plain rice combo - it was too spicy and it hd whole chilies in it and the lemon grass pieces in the gravy which made it difficult to swallow . the heat in the curry choked me bad . too spicy for anybody to eat .
Ordered egg biryani nd chicken chap combo - biryani was stail nd the chicken chap was too greassy and spices wernt even cooked properly. 
It was a waste of money and time #320_rs_in_vain

Really Crazy to sell such insane quantity for 250 bucks. Ordered a ghost hundi dum biriyani. The quantity is enormous. Good in terms of quality. The biriyani contained 3pieces of tender succulent mutton, 2 pieces of potatoes and one boiled egg. It is enough to feed 2adults and 1 kid. Overall, value for money.

I take combo meal quite often which fills you up well. The only thing that I didn't like was the red rice which was just fried rice with added chilli powder and more chillies, just burns you and the Thai chicken. The chicken in garlic butter sauce is really great. Overall food is quite good. :)

One of those afternoons when you want Biriyani but the pocket gives you a hard time. This place is on my daily route but there is nothing noticeable about it. The zomato reviews actually helped me and my friends to track it down.

We tried the usual Chicken Biriyani and the Chinese Combo and on suggestion of the owner (Vikram, extremely pleasant man), the handi biriyani which turned out to be the winner. The flavour is excellent and taste is also quite good.

A good takeaway joint but I would definitely sneak in for some on the go snacks here and there. Handi Biriyani, should be tried.

The price of the Biryani is as the price of other shops and the quality and quantity both are really good. Most of the shops may give one piece of chicken at this price but this shop give two pieces of chicken which you will definitely like to have it in this price.¬†

This place is at walking distance from the Bsnl telephone exchange at Jadavpur. The tollygunj metro autos take you there from 8b bus stand. It's a tiny outlet, atmost 4 people can sit and eat there,mostly functions as a takeaway.Though named Krazy biriyani, its famous for everything except the biriyani. I've tried their combo meals. Pasta in mixed sauce is a favourite. They serve chicken noodles in a sauce of your choice in the combos too. The schezuan one is yummy, but a little dry. It's really pocket friendly, about 60 to 70rs for a combo. :)

I ordered the Murg Handi Dum Biryani & a full Chicken Biryani assuming I would eat both as I was famished (little did I know). Firstly, their "handi" is not a handi, it is a freaking "Handa", it is huge. The quantity of rice can easily fill 2-3 people. The chicken pieces were juicy,¬† tender and fresh. The quality¬† and quantity at this price is unbelievable. I am supremely satisfied and would recommend it to all and sundry.

Suggestion - Please do go easy on the flavor, everything else is spot on.

So, this was recommended by one of my friends as this is owned by one of his friends. And I have even seen them aggressively promoting their Biryani on Facebook. 

As the name suggests, this place is good for Biryani(as far as I have heard). But yesterday evening I decided for Chinese and I chose Krazy Biryani. 

So, I logged in to Swiggy and I ordered Chicken in Garlic Butter Sauce and Mixed Hong Kong Noodles. The delivery was pretty quick and the packing was decent even. The prices were dirt cheap and I found out that the packaging charges were even less compared to other restaurants. 

Now, to the Chicken in Garlic Butter Sauce. The chicken peices were quite big and they were quite considerable enough with the gravy. But, the gravy lacked salt. They forgot to put salt in it. So, I used some salt, vinegar, hot garlic sauce and a sweet garlic sauce and brought it up to a consistency. The Hong Kong Noodles was okayish. Again, they were quite considerable with the portion considering the price.  

I don't know whether I will order Chinese ever again from this outlet. But I will definitely try their Biryani, for once as I have heard people talking quite good about it.

I am big guy and I a lot, but I swear to god I could not finish one whole 'hari' of their biriyani. This was probably the best biriyani I having had in a long time. I mean for the price, the presentation and the quantity is amazing, to say the least. 3 whole pieces of chicken/mutton prepared and served in a 'hari'. The feeling is unreal. A must try, if you ask me.

Krazy Biriyani, if you're listening, I'd love for you guys to open up an outlet somewhere near New Alipore. Till then I'll be making frequent trips to Jadavpur, since swiggy won't deliver from Krazy Biriyani to my place.

To all the foodies, especially the Biriyani-heads, stop reading this review and go and get yourself some amazing biriyani before the world finds out about it. For probably the first time, only for the Biriyani, a solid 5 points.

Their Gosht Handi Biryani is superb, with great quanity and quality. It's a must try, you're going to absolutely love it. Another awesome item in their menu is the Chicken Chaanp, that fills your senses with the aroma of desi ghee. Too yummy! However, I feel they can improve on their Chinese preparations. Had ordered their mixed fried rice, sweet garlic chicken and pepper chicken for lunch. The garlic chicken was very bland and the gravy was like a soup. Would like to try their Chinese dishes also if they can amp up on the spice and flavor.

I came from Delhi for work at Kolkata and happened to find restaurants near by through the app- Swiggy , and liked the name krazy biryani and after reading reviews at Zomato, I ordered handi biryani and ginger bell pepper rice along with garlic chicken and each of the items were amazing , handi biryani was something new to me and it tasted remarkable! I recommend it to every one..

The name suggests that this place must have good biriyani and it did....not as good as the big names in the city but quiet applaudable...the side dishes were not that good since the chicken tasted a little stale and chewy but the fish was good but the gravy wasn't ....other than this I wud like to come back and try some different dishes and I wud not be recommending this place unless they start to properly wash the meat....

A small restaurant joint @ poddhar Nagar, I hear lots of things about this place, and about their biriyani also, so I oder few items.

Gosht handi dum biriyani: 4/5

Chiken pasta with white sauce: pathetic 0 / 5

Combo ( noodles and chili chiken) worst 1 / 5
They serve uncooked Noodles with no flavour nothing it's look like boiled noodles.

Pan fried fish: decent 3.5 / 5

Mutton kosha: too oily and spicy but okies type 3 / 5

Black current milkshake: nice 3 / 5

Mango milkshake: very good load with flavors

All together nice experience but they took too much time to deliver the food.

If you are at Krazy Biriyani then just have the Biriyani. That is what they are crazy good at. Krazy biriyani made Biriyani a part of my evening munchies. Just visit the place and occupy yourself with half a plate of chicken biriyani or take home their lovely mutton biriyani in that magnum handi, topped generously with golden fried onions and alu bukharas. That is a sheer sight of delight. 

The mutton and chicken kasha are none the less impressive. These are often what make my weekday dinners a little more interesting.

Ordered via Swiggy. The items were not at all upto the mark. The biryani was lacking taste. The chinese items failed to impress me. The fried rice and the fish manchurian seemed to prepared in a hurry. It was somehow edible though. Otherwise, a lot of improvement should be made. Focus on the quantity and quality. Disappointed.

It was a hot afternoon and i was not in mood to go out from office to have my lunch. One of my staff suggest to me to order something through Swigy so i dont have to go out. I open the swigy and for Chinese i found this restaurant. I scroll down the menu card and i found chilli chicken and noodles so i ordered that. The dish was awesome. The taste was superb, and the price was great. Next day ordered Mutton Biriyany and i surprised to see that in Rs 130 Biriyani they gave 2 pcs mutton, one egg and a potato and the rice quality and quantity was good enough for a single. Its value for money though it's more than expected. Keep feeding us good food.

I am a big fan of their handi biryani and have ordered it many times.¬†
Wanted to try Chinese .... Biiiig disappointment .
Ordered Hong cong noodles, American chop sue , thi chicken and hong Kong chicken.¬†
Didn't get any difference between regular Hakka and their hong Kong noodles. The gravies were watery with very little taste differentiation and chicken was more batter than chicken
The best was the chop sue which should have been termed darsan it was so sweet... Sad experience and this when the food took an her to reach.

PLEASE Stick to biryani.....

Ordered food, so cannot comment about the ambience. The fish dishes are quite good, they are tasty but not overtly spicy. The fish in oyster sauce and fish in mustard are really delicious and highly recommended. The biriyani is not the best in town, but it is good value for money and quite filling.

Cannot comment on the ambience since I have had the food through Swiggy.

The biryani isn't Nizam or Arsalan quality; but its good; especially based on its low price.
The half plate biriyani is enough for one person. :)

Thumbs up for the biriyani!

I have also had their chicken momo. Yes; this too is priced low. But the momos were bad.

They were extremely dry. The filling too wasn't great.
Thumbs down for the momo!!

Tried chicken handi dum biriyani and mutton kosha. Got items delivered through Swiggy. Biriyani was like that sold in Kolkata footpaths, only flavour anyone can smell is meetha attar. Still it was tolerable. But mutton kosha!! Yak!! It's smell was like urine! Yes urine!   Thrown the whole thing. I've never had food worse than this. Incredible CRAZY worst restaurant. Even food joints in remotest rural areas make better food than this. Wastage of money and energy.

Biriyani is good considering the price. Both quantity and taste wise. However, the Chinese combo meals taste very ordinary, noodle is the better option to go for than rice. However, they're light on pocket.¬†
We asked for a home delivery, and we are satisfied with the service they provided.

It feels great to write a review about a restaurant where the efforts can be clearly seen. Despite the location being a little interior, Vikram's Krazy Biryani has made a spot on my favorite list. I am no big EXPERT in the area, but I can say one thing for sure... the biryani was NOT dry. The price of the dishes allowed me to try many starters at a time, and all of them were brilliant. I would definitely visit soon.P.S : I would find it very stupid to decrease the rating of a restaurant just because of space issues, like I said, the effort to do better is evident from the food.

I have tasted their Biryani quite some time. They are experimenting with various kind of Biryani which they say fusion Biryani.¬†

I like their Biryani. However, it totally depends on your preference of Biryani. On special occasion they prepare Prawn Biryani as well which I tasted and liked it. The good thing about the place is, they make Biryani in small quantity and they make the ingredients are hand picked and prepared with care. The personal touch is there.¬†

What I liked more at their shop is momos! They are juicy and melts in the mouth.¬†

They have some good mocktail and shakes as well. I had black current shake and it was different.

The best thing about this place is, its pocket friendly.

This is good for a quick eat up! There is limited space for sitting. So if you are crossing the way or near by Lords More or Jadavpur 8B, you can just parcel some Biryani or Momos for yourself.

This is a 'krazy' little place located just beside the Bikramgarh football field on Prince Golam Hossain Shah Road, at a 10-minute walking distance from 8B bus stand. Although it is a tiny place mainly for takeaway or home delivery, a few chairs and stools are kept along with extensions on the walls in case you check in for a quick meal.

The little room serves a very different type of biryani which they say, a fusion of Hyderabadi biryani and Kolkata biryani. It has a strong hint of the spices as well as color of the former, but is cooked in the Bengali style of cooking. With the quintessential potato and two tempting pieces of chicken in each plate, for just ‚Çπ100, the 'krazy' biryani packs a punch. Do note that the biryani is VERY dry, for which you have options like lassi and fresh lime to gulp it down.

Apart from that, various Chinese dishes and pocket friendly combo meals are available. A friend of mine strongly recommended their momos. The inexpensive Chinese items in the menu were appealing (combo meals were as low as 50 bucks!), so a visit for trying them out is going to happen pretty soon.
UPDATE : The Chinese here is so good that even if they rename it as Krazy Chinese, the name would be totally justified. We had CHICKEN GARLIC BELL PEPPER RICE and SHANGHAI CHICKEN i think. Both were lipsmacking! Vikram da and the rest of the staff are superb and will be more than happy to guide you through their huge menu. 

Give the place a try, it is perfect for college students who wish to try something different.
Cost for two : ‚Çπ200+ :)

This little outlet near my place is the best . Tough the name is krazy biryani but its a multicuisine !! I've almost tried everything .  And loved everything . As the name says krazy biryani their handi biryani is really krazy . Starting from its quantity ( which can fill 2adults and a kid ) to its taste its krazily amazing .  Also the mutton kosa is amazing . And from their chines menu chilli fish , dragon chicken is my favourite. And also ginger bell pepper rice and all the side dishes almost . I'm a fan of their biryani and dragon chicken.
