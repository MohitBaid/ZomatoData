For Late night ice cream cravings, this is a place to visit in saltlake. It's one of the many ice cream parlours which has come up in recent past with the concept of live icecreams.
They have quite a few variety to choose from. We ordered the Nutella Rocher, Cookies delight and the dark fantasy. I was little disappointed with the Nutella rocher since there was very little amount of nutella present in the icecream. Other two were good, mainly the dark fantasy with the chocolates and chips etc.

LOCATION: Situated near salt lake swimming pool, right beside Manorama studios.
AMBIENCE: It's a step into Barbie world. The interiors are every little girl's fantasy with the bright pink & white interiors.
SERVICE: It is okay
MENU: Along with ice cream the place also doubles up as a cafe & serves everything from pizza to risottos.
FOOD: The caramel brownie ice cream was quite a confusion for the taste buds. It had a almost nutty flavour contrasting to the caramel.

I wanted to try the Ice Cream from this place mainly because the flavours attracted me.This kind of ice cream grew really popular after one brand started it,but many other joints slowly followed the same concept.I tried the fruit loaded ice cream which was a big disappointment.Black current ice cream mixed with some raisin and canned pineapple.Neither the ice cream was rich nor was the flavours matching.I also ordered some paneer pakora which was far better.Thin slices of paneer crumb coated and fried.Though there were no spice or any other flavours stull the fresh adequate quantity of paneer satisfied the wants.Basically the rating is mainly for the paneer,the ice cream was not worth anything for me.

We went to this small place on choturthi of Durga puja but it had not much of rush thankfully.. There are 4 four seater tables.. Its basically a small garage just next to French loaf outlet near swimming pool..an overall well decorated place.
We ordered candy krush ( its vanilla and strawberry ice cream with 2 wafer sticks, few gems, choco chips and jelly cubes) and
Cookies delight ( it was vanilla ice cream with roasted cashews and almonds)
Both were really nice and extremely heavy for us.. But we enjoyed and next time will try their snacks.
Recommended.

A nice little ice cream parlour ...

We tried fruity fruits recommended by the staff there, they mixed the ice creams and fruits nicely

Will like to visit again and try some other flavours as well

This place is located diagonally opposite Gupta's, near Bidhannagar Swimming Pool. The outlet has dominantly pink interiors, with chairs and tables for groups of four. The ice cream here is made live, and the sound of beating ice cream will get you excited even before you have your first taste of the ice cream. Coming to the ice cream, it tastes delicious, and the thick, creamy delights are available with a variety of toppings. The dark fantasy has toppings of chocolate sauce, cashew, choco chips and wafers on a chocolate ice cream base. They serve the ice cream on waffle cones inside paper cups. Do try out this place for a unique experience of live ice cream, that too at extremely pocket friendly rates!
