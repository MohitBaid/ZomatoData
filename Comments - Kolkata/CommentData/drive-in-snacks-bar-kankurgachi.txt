Drive snacks bar is located near the inox swabhumi .. It is at a stone throw distance from there towards the phoolbagan side.

I had visited them couple of times and tried their South Indian food only. Masala dosa and idly both were just about okay and decent in taste. Being a mid sized restaurant I felt the variety is a little less and needs to be upgraded in that section. The food quality and taste is average nothing extraordinary.

Worst ever experience. Not only the staff of the unit but also the owner doesn't have basic ettiequte of handling customers and their grievances. I had placed orders for take away for my parents yesterday and given them specific request to pack the masala of the dosas separately, but as usual they didn't and dosa became soggy. Today I had ordered for Noodles with Gravy and had asked them to given some chilly vinegar extra but when the parcel arrived the guy who delivered was not carrying any change nor he was carrying the extra vinegar. When I called the restaurant (its worst then a road-side dhaba) the receiver on the other hand an employee had actually no idea of how to talk and start arguing and said they don't provide any vinegar onion with Chinese food, he didn't even listen to my requirement as it was chilly vinegar and not vinegar onion. As icing the food i had ordered "Gravy Noodles", the noodles were burnt when complained again to the owner this time expecting a better reply. False alarm, he is worse then his employees. The saying goes true, Jaisa Malik waisa Naukar.

Went for a breakfast!
The experience wasn't good!
We ordered cheese sandwich, idly and special mixed masala dosa!!
The taste of dosa n idly was ok but the cheese sandwich was a disaster!

The food isnt good according to the price!!
My bucks got wasted :(
Won't visit again :(

This place has an awesome ambience. The Chinese food is lip smacking. They have also introduced Sizzlers at a very reasonable pricing. They have also started combos which is a pocket saver if we go in a big group. This place has improved and has grown over the time period. The quality of food and the service has improved drastically. We being vegetarians, this is the best place for us to fill our stomach till we burp. Drive In Snacks Bar is a 5 star place and a must visit place for all the food lovers especially vegetarians.

I have never come across a Vegetarian restaurant with such a good Chinese food and Â South Indian food. We are veggies. I am very fond of the Anand and Madras restaurant for their great dosas. My wife is very fond of veg Chinese food available in CIT cafe and Chinatown. Here you get the best of both the worlds !

Third grade restraunt. Waiters working there doesn't know how to speak with their customers. And you if have issues like this wirh the waiters, there is no one available to complain to know at the desk. 
A restraunt without any manager working on the shoulders of waiters who does not know the meaning of customer 'service'. 
So if you do not want to interact with these 'pada' people, dont go there.
