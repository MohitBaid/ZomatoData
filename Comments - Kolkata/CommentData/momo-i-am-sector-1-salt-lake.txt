A surprise at every visit.I have been to Momo i Am several times. For a brunch, lunch and dinner. To their bao festival. Just like that... The food there is amazing. Every time I have been there, one or the other dish has surprised my palate and given me pleasure beyond the ordinary.Go to Momo i Am. Try their exotic dishes. And, especially, their pork.

The visit happened on a chilly winter Saturday night. Momo seemed to be the perfect fit. Seems to be a busy restaurant. We were 2 people and we ordered the Hangover chicken momo (2 plates), Chicken fried momo (2plates) and Momo I am crispy chicken. The hangover momo was stir fried in a spicy sauce. Not too spicy. ...palatable for both spicy and non spicy lovers. It was served on bed of spicy mashed potato and was covered in wok tossed spicy veggies. We just loved it yet missed the accompaniment of the clear soup.So next we ordered the fried momo which was served with the signature clear soup. Tasted perfect.Finally we ordered the crispy chicken which turned out to be six mini balls of chicken. Tasted bland . It was also served on spicy mashed potato.Comparing the price of the crispy chicken the quantity was a big disappointment. Another problem was the kitchen seemed understaffed as the service was too slow . Still I would go back once again for momo before the winter season is over.

Had a plan to visit this place since a long time. Good ambience. Cooperative staff members. We ordered pork short ribs and momo platter. Pork short ribs was hell spicy. I simply loved it because I love spicy food. In the momo platter we were served 4 types of momos but I couldn't spot the difference between the pan fried momos and the other 3 types of momos. But overall it's good. Would love to visit again.

The pork panfried momo was surely heavenly and worth trying..  There are lots of varieties there..  But they make a unique mixed fried rice..  And we took teriyaki chicken..  Only because it was not spicy..  Overall a very satisfying visit..  Will visit again soon!!

Momo I am was in my bucket list for. quite a long time now.And finally I went to this place on New Year's with my family and was really amazed by the experience.Amazing food in a very cheap price(ordered around 20 dishes with a pocket pinch of INR3060 only)prompt and quick service instead of the buzzing crowd,well courteous staffs.I love their decor(graffiti walls).The only thing I didn't like is the plate in which they serve food.Such a nice place serving food in plastic or fibre plates is not acceptable (personal opinion) .Other than that it was an fantastic experience.Start to the year couldn't have been better.Momo I am is the best place in the city which you must visit to satisfy your momo cravings.Infact you can't be happy with just one visit.This place is highly recommendable for all the momo lovers out there.I want to go to that place again to try the other dishes as well as raspberry bao which was unavailable on that day.
.
Pork fried Momos:6pieces served with two type of mildly spiced sauce and clear soup.
Momos were crispy from outside with a good amount of juicy pork filling inside.
And I must say this is one of the best momos i have had in Kolkata.
.
Pork Hangover Momo:Steamed momos served on a bed of mashed potatoes.Topped up with cheese.Mildly spiced .
.
Indonesian grilled Pork Salad:lettuce were crunchy served with good amt. Of pork slices but this was the only dish i didn't like.Because i could smell something bad, don't know what,maybe the dressing.
.
Chicken Bao:crispy chicken served in fluffy bao with lettuce,cucumber,etc with sweet sauce .Tasted amazing.
.
Pork Bao: Heavenly;soft,steamed fluffy bao stuffed with double fried pork belly(crispy ,juicy and Succulent),crunch lettuce,sliced cucumber,sweet plum sauce.
.
Momo I am shafyaley:This was a crispy fried dish filled with juicy filling of chicken served with 2 types of mildly spiced sauce.
.
Momo I am Xo Rice Pork:Well seasoned rice with good amt of pork.Very tasty with the perfect balance of flavours, seasoning to the point, quantity worth the money
.
Zen chilli chicken:I didn't like the texture when it was brought to the table.But it was very tasty.mildly spiced with perfect balance of flavours
.
Pork Chili:Star dish of the evening.It was the only dish which was spicy so I loved it.Pork slices stir fried with good amount of veggies,chillies and spicy sauce.The taste blew my mind .
Loved it
.
Pork Shyapta:Pork slices and veggies in a mildly spiced gravy
.
Chicken shitake noodle:i am not a big fan of noodles,but I loved it here.
.
Fried chicken Wonton :crispy wontons with juicy minced chicken filling served with 2 sauces.
.
Momo i am Xo noodles:Must try again.
.
Chicken Noodle:It was normal stir fried noodles.Tasted good with zen chilli chicken and pork chilli
.
Cheese Cake:Cheesake serve with a dollop of vanilla icecream and raspberry sauce .A great end to the new years dinner.You definitely dont wanna miss it.

Food : 4.5/ 5 
We ordered veg bao, veg pan fried momos, hangover chicken momo, Asian fries infused with mayo and Schezuan sauce, crispy American corn. 
The bao was outstanding, the bread was mouth-melting and the stuffing was good. The Crispy American Corn was a little low on flavour but was well-complimented by the other dishes. The hangover chicken momo was laid on a bed of mashed potato, the filling was juicy and loaded with flavours. Fries, on the other hand, was very different and tasted amazing. Rather, all the dishes were on point. Loved them all. 

Ambiance : 4/5 
Well decorated, a small eatery with a very vibrant decor.

I'm simply a fan of Momo I am. Whenever I am craving delicious juicy Momos and spices gravy to go with my noodles Momo I Am is the place that comes to my mind. The pork steamed and panfried Momos are an all time favorite, I also really like their pork chili and chicken shapta preparation.  The best part about this place is that it doesn't compromise on quality for the reasonable prices it charges for every dish. The interior is very modern and the service is friendly and quick. I totally love this place and recommend everyone to try it out.

Having visited all the major outlets, I can safely say this is my favourite one.
My personal favourite would be the Momo I am Chopsuey noodles which has never failed to disappoint me.
The starters were a mouthful of flavors.
Crispy chicken and the Drums of Hell , while the former was crunchy with a good dip, the latter was spicy and aptly juicy.
The Pork Bao was a speciality for the day so it's no surprise that is was really great. The apple with the hubby Poek pieces and the spices works perfectly.
The Momo platter was okay, nothing great!
The decor is very fulfilling , with Graphiti and artsy tables and mirrors on the wall. Good work with that.

Will definitely go back for more authentic Chinese. ,

I visited this place twice. Located near City Center 1 easily accessible. A cozy place with graffiti walls and good service. My first visit was quite pleasant as I was able to try most of the items mentioned in the menu. However, my second visit during the pujas was a bit disappointing. Only 20% of the items were available and we could not try what we had decided prior to reaching this place. Overall, this is one of the best places to try Tibetan and Asian cuisine.

Located in a very convenient place besides Kalyan jewellers beside CC1 in Salt Lake. Ambience is cool but not very attractive. Staffs are not that bothering about customers & they are mostly indulging themselves in gossip. We ordered chicken steam momo as starter. They served within 5 min. It was nothing extraordinary to be exact. Then we ordered XO momo I am noodles (mixed) & Zen Chili chicken by seeing some fantastic reviews from zomato. But both were quite ordinary specially the chicken. So this restaurant is a bit overhyped & I recommend this to be as only pocket friendly option of Chinese cuisine in Salt Lake area. Nothing extraordinary.

Since everyone are praising about the place, we finally got to visit this place which is easily accessible.
~Located near kalyan jewellers.
Ambience is really cool~lit up with Graffiti arts
With something good something bad comes i.e., service.
It was like they were ignoring us.
After asking multiple times they refilled our glass with water.
The servers themselves are not aware what the menu consists of.
Talking about the menu most of the dishes were not available.
I came here for something particular but unfortunately they were not available.
They we decided to order veg bao which we felt like McDonald's aloo tikki.
Will call first and ask whether certain dishes are available or not then only we will visit.

This is one of my personal favourite places in Salt Lake, both to visit and order from. The decor is vibrant, and the staff is always courteous and helpful.
They also have a little balcony outside, in case you need a smoke before, after, or during your meal.
I am particularly fond of the five spice pork, chicken kothay, pepper shiracha fish, and momo i am chopsuey. They also serve the best bao I've ever had. The kicker's got to be the cool mocktails, and the DELICIOUS cheesecake (which you wouldn't really expect at a Chinese restaurant)
The portions are good, and the quality of food is great. If you love pork, or simply enjoy good Chinese, this place is a must-visit!

So this is a throwback to 4 orders we made during the Bao festival and the order consisted of mostly pork baos ... So here goes-

TL;DR
Loved: momos, T Momo combo, Slow Cooked Pork Ribs Bao, Slow Cooked Pork Bao;
Avoid: the usual pork bao;
Excellent Delivery Service.

REVIEW (TAKEOUT)

THE ORDER
Pork Momos
Pork T-Momos Combo
Pork Bao
Sliced Pork Bao
Slow Cooked Pork Baos
Slow Cooked Pork Ribs Baos
Japanese Ham and Cheese Croquette Bao
Marinated Pork Bao with Sriracha Aoili

THE FOOD
Pork Momos (3.5/5)
Soft flavourful juicy dumplings that comes with 2 sauces.

Pork T-Momos Combo (4/5)
The shyapta was very tasty and is perfect side for the steamed buns.

The Pork Bao and Sliced Pork Bao (2/5)
They werere basically the same thing. I didn't enjoy it. They were too overwhelming and I didn't quite like the taste of that overcooked bacon in very sweet sauce.

Slow Cooked Pork Baos (4.5/5)
This was one of my favourites. Soft juicy pork with a balanced marinade. Just the perfect Bao according to me and that crunchy pickle.

Slow Cooked Pork Ribs Bao (3.5/5)
While the plum sauce was slightly overwhelming and I would love it if they reduce the amounts, this was another Bao that was very tasty. I mean who wouldn't love pork ribs. But I think the Apple just adds sweetness to the dish that is too sweet.

Japanese Ham and Cheese Croquette Bao(2.5/5)
Didn't like them.
Needed more Ham and Cheese.

Marinated Pork Bao with Sriracha Aoili (3.5/5)
Really tasty Bao but I think the pork nuggets were slightly overcooked. Sriracha, as usual, doing its job making food delicious.

THE VERDICT
The Bao festival was a brilliant idea and I hope this Baos stick to the regular menu. And this place has much more to offer. So I'll be order other things from here in the distant future

RATING
Food 3.5/5
Value for money 3.5/5
Delivery 4/5

Quaint little place with a bare brick wall, polished wooden chairs and tables adding to the rustic feel. Unfortunately the food looked nice but tastewise was way off. I love baos and hence had ordered pork bao,chicken bao, chicken fried momo and litchi juice. The baos were not fluffy enough. The pork too chewy and partially crispy with a not so strong plum sauce. The chicken bao was filled with crispy chicken and had an overpowering taste of peanuts. Very forgettable. The fried momo was the saving grace with a tasty chicken filling. Litchi juice was too watery and cost üíØ and the glass was not even full! Personally I would not visit this place again as the food did not live up to my expectations (owing to such high rating on zomato). Staff were cordial and service was quick though.

 Chicken Hangover Momos are highly recommended.
Chicken Kothay momos - The perfect blend of streamed momos and fried base. 
But the dessert stole the show. 
Sweet Rasberry Bao with Icecream - A  filling of sliced banana inside sweet and juicy bao, scoop of vanilla ice-cream, the rasberry flavour tastes perfect. ‚ù§

With the boom of F & B industry in the city, asian joints have been popping up like mushrooms. We saw the advent of asian restaurants one after another. However talking of consistency, Momo I am is definitely one of the best economical asian joints in the city. They have 3 outlets in the city if I'm not mistaken.

This one is located very close to CC1 (near Kalyan Jewellers) The other two are in Chinar Park and Golper respectively.

Ambience & Overall Service : Casual grunge vibe with graphic walls and perfectly well blended ambience. However, I did deduct half a point for their super slack service at this outlet. Others (fellow bloggers) however have mentioned that the other two outlets are absolutely top notch. Don't know what went wrong here. The servers were pretty clueless and disinterested. No one to take you through to your seat at the restaurant. I was disappointed. We had to wait for 45 minutes to get two baos which was not what I was expecting. Also the server did not bother filling our glasses with water the second time before we objected.

Coming to the real deal now -

Food :

Food however, is definitely their strong point. No denying the fact. The service can be a turn off but I would recommend this place just based on their indulgent gastronomic brilliance!

‚Ä¢ Chicken Kothey - Lightly pan fried steamed momo that were succulent and juicy. Absolutely loved it. Highly recommended.

‚Ä¢ Pork Bao - Oh god, this was the highlight of the evening. The star of the show. The Pork Bao is to die for. Go to this restaurant just for the juicy and succulent pork baos because they are hands down amazing.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Bao - I love this one as well. Totally order this one if you are not into pork. The juicy chicken bits, the lettuce, the sauce and the crispy peanuts on top make this absolutely stunning.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Hangover Momo - This one is the regular momo but spicier on a bed of mash potatoes and a spicy sauce drizzled all over. Definitely for the ones who love their spice.

‚Ä¢ Cheesecake - This was really good as well. You would not want to give this a miss. A great meal ender if you ask me.

A meal for two would set you back by INR 500/-

Nevertheless this place serves amazing food despite the service issue at this particular outlet. Do drop down and leave with a happy tummy!

After n number home deliveries, I finally managed to visit this place. Sitting just behind the Salt Lake city centre, Momo I Am is nicely done restaurant with uber cool furniture and graffitis on the wall. I have been a big fan of their food, especially the baos. This time, however, my friend and I ordered a regular ork steam momo. It was well cooked, served with two sauces. The stopper came in the second half, which was the Pork Short Ribs. Can't deny it's one of the best ribs I have had ever. The juicy tender meat around a skewer-like bone enriches your sensory pleasures. Quite happy with the budget food that they offer. Big kudos,

Stepped here in today. As it's Christmas so we thought that it'll be a bit crowded and we have to wait for seats etc etc. But no, around 3.15 pm it was quite pleasant ambience there and we found no crowd. Located at just opposite to city centre , near Kalyan jewellers. 
So, the place is not too big, but not small yet. It has near about 12-14 four seater tables. The area is divided by a partition, just for decoration issues. I liked the inner portion more, where we choose to take seats. The decoration is pretty good with few Rock n Roll legends. The kitchen is open so that you can have a look on it's hygiene. Rolling stone's track was playing  on our background. üòç 

Now coming to food.
We ordered Prawn Firecracker as starter, in main course we choose the Oriental basil mixed pork fried rice and Hoisin Pork as side. 
After waiting 10minutes one of the stuffs informed us that the Prawn Firecracker will take a bit time, like 20 minutes, to be ready. It didn't bother us, rather it seemed good that we were informed about the fact.
After near about 20  minutes they served us.

Prawn Firecracker - served hot in a cute little basket. We liked it a lot. The prawns were marinated with Thai herbs, wrapped then fried. Quite experimental. Six pieces served with the topping of chopped onion leaves. Chilli tomato dip and chilli flex dip is also served with it. Crispy and delicious üòã. Feels more tasty when dipped into the chilli tomato sauce. 

Oriental basil mixed pork fried rice - I heard that one portion of rice isn't okay for two. But, trust me we were hungry and one portion of it seemed enough for us. The steamed rice tossed with basil sauce and cooking wine. Fried eggs, tender chicken and pork pieces were mixed with it. Such a delicious and proper blending of spices. Pudina and tamarind dip were served with it.

Hoisin Pork - this stole my heart ‚ô° . A perfect blending of rice wine, scallions, zucchini, and hoisin sauce with the juicy and succulent shredded pork. Whether I love pork a lot, the proper blending of pungent and sweetness made me love the dish more. But they served few fats too, never mind about that. Still we loved the dish.

Few drawbacks about the place were - when we weren't served, I found that the table wasn't properly cleaned. And at the end of the meal, we had to wait a lot to have the bill. They took a lot of time to take the dishes away from there even. Otherwise overall a good place to have lunch or dinner in such a pocket friendly budget. Lastly , I like their ambience a lot. Recommended.

A cute little place beside Kalyan Jewellers in Saltlake. The ambience is attractive. I love the way the wall paintings are done. We ordered for Fried Chicken momo and Pork bao. It took them nearly 25mins to serve. The waiters were polite enough. The fried momo was yummy. 6pieces in a plate. Pork Bao was awesome. It seems small but quite filling. The pork bellies were soft and yummy. I loved the way they served the bill in a jug. It was cute. The prices are cheap as they dont charge high taxes. Would love to visit again. I deducted -5 for the waiting time. Hope they improve it soon.

Outstanding food.We ate 7 pork dishes, one prawn, one chicken, and one cheesecake, and spent only 2k. Every dish was brilliant, except for the butter garlic prawns, because the batter was soggy with the sauce. The roast pork in black bean sauce and the pork ribs were my favourite. The chicken one - drums of hell - were super spicy and tasty. Everything is so good here!

The place is adjacent to Kalyani jewellers in Salt Lake. It's not very spacious but is very well put up with pretty lights and sober lighting, I personally liked the ambience. 
Coming to the food, after going through several reviews we decided to try out Drums of Hell (which was supposed to be too hot for faint hearted),  it isn't that spicy I felt that the hotness was overrated but it was good to taste, I loved it. Next we ordered Chicken Bao, the Bao was really soft but the chicken filling was dry, though it can be given a try. Next up on table was SOI 56, a fish starter,  honey glazed fish were soft and juicy and were good to taste. Henceforth we moved on to the main course, so we ordered Momo I am XO noodles alongwith Zen chilly chicken. Noodles were well cooked and light which I personally liked and the chilly chicken was delicious too except for the fact that it had nothing different from other places. To end with we had Cheesecake which I felt was not well combined with cranberry sauce,  otherwise it tasted good.
Service was prompt and good. 
Overall I found the place to be good and budget friendly. This entire course costed us around 1200.
Thank you :)

Okay, so I thought trying out Pork here will be a good idea, but the next few days after having it made me literally sick. Though it tasted good, the after effects of having it weren't so much. With Pork Chops, and Teriyaki Chicken Bao being ordered, Bao bowled me over. It was so soft, and delicious. The Bao Festival which was going on made me order it in the first place. Apart from these, the place is ambient but chaotic. Wouldn't except a quiet time much, even on a Thursday afternoon.

We have ordered Veg Fried Rice and Zen Chilly Chicken. 
Veg Fried Rice was very good. 
Zen Chilly Chicken > The Thick heavy coat of batter wrapped chicken -  Not a good idea!! Does not taste good You can charge little extra but make the Chilly Chicken portion with at least 6 pieces But not only 4 pieces!!! However the Chicken gravy was very authentic and delicious!! The Rice portion is good and enough for 2 pax. 
Keep the quality up and be consistent!!
Best Wishes to Team MOMO I AM!!!

Momo I Am has a small and cozy outlet opposite City Centre. It is absolutely bustling with crowd most of the time, and that itself should give you a good idea about the amazing food they serve at pretty reasonable rates.¬†
Items tried:
1. Marinated Pork Bao with Sriracha Aoili - Succulent and Crispy fried pork pieces with the spicy Sriracha sauce is a combination made in heaven!
2. Slow cooked Pork Bro - Beautiful flavour and slightly more spicy than the previous one!
3. Chicken Kothay- Juicy and full of meat!
4. Stir Fry Chilly Chicken Momos - Medium spicy and great flavour! Momos Kolkata Chilly Chicken style!
5. Pork Fried Rice - Very tasty, although more fat than pork meat.
6. Chicken Mushroom Cheese Panko Momos- This is the only dish that I was not truly satisfied with. You could hardly taste any cheese or mushrooms and its simply tasted like deep fried chicken momos. So a bit of a let down considering the standard of the food otherwise.

Overall, I'm really happy that they have opened an outlet so close to home, and I look forward to trying more items from their highly varied menu.

My everyday food zone!
I visit this outlet multiple times a week after college for a tasty meal.
The manager is very friendly and knows me because of our regular visits.
Huge variety of items to try it. 
Fried momos, Fried rice, Pork shaypta and Cantonese gravy Noddles are my usual items.
Price is very reasonable and food is utterly delicious.
Highly recommended if you're a momo person

It is located close to the Saltlake City centre near the Kalyan Jewellers on the adjoining circle. The area is now becoming the eat out zone in the locality, with a lot of eateries very close by. From the outside the place looks very unassuming, the inside looks like a work in progress. The food however is just out of the world. We went there on a team lunch, and ate to our Heart's content. We ordered chicken thukpa, chicken Bao and Pork Shyafalek for starter. I love their Bao, they get the proportion of meat bun and condiments about right. The Shyafalek was pretty awesome and to my surprise so the Thukpa. Thukpa especially is a dish which has managed to disappoint me time and again on the plains so this was a memorable experience. For the main course we ordered Stir fried Pork noodles, Oriental basil fried rice, 5 spice pork, oyster pork etc. The oyster pork was fabulous, the noodles and rice amazing, as usual I should add. The only complain with the 5 spice pork is that we really had to dig deep to find any pork in that, the dish needs a generous helping of pork which wasn't there. In dessert we ordered the cheesecake and tender coconut ice cream. The cheesecake was one of the best I have had and add to that a large scoop of vanilla ice cream, a combination of both of these were heavenly. The tender coconut icecream has always been fail safe and so it proved yet again.
We love to come here time and again.
P.S. The home delivery to Sector 5 needs to get better and without an order limit.

I actually like the chinar park joint more .

It was freaking awesome
Here we had chicken bao with harissa dressing since the bao festival was going on.It tasted great
Then we had chicken noodles with xo sauce which was great to have.
Then we thought of having a Momo platter which was bit of a disappointment. My friend did not have it since the filling was not that tasty and did not give a feeling of a good Momo
But the staff were courteous enough to enquire about it and give us complimentary ice cream to make up to our disappointment. Overall a good experience. Hope to get better Momos out here next time üê∑

I have visited Momo I Am many times with my friends.
The ambience is refreshing and pop culture friendly. If u r a fan of manga and anime, this place is going to win u over.
Now coming to the food. I wouldn't say it's the best Chinese, Tibetan restaurant I've been too. I say this because while some of the items on the menu r very good, others are a bit basic. So far I felt their thukpa wasn't really up to the mark, and the momos r honestly just ordinary. Also I'm honestly very disappointed with the soup they offer with the momos. And the gravy noodles is too runny. On the other hand, their bowls and baos r amazing. I find their hot and sour soup just the right kind of spicy and hot.
The price is on the verge of being called "overpriced". Ummm... May be it is a bit overpriced, tbh. But the quantity is satisfactory.
The staff is polite enough as well.
Overall, I'd say that it's a good place to hang out with the squad if you have some extra pennies to spare.

Located close to CC1, this place is much bigger than the one they have in Chinar Park. It has sufficient seating space and wooden chairs, which are all good in keeping with the stripped down signature decor of Momo I Am, but also a tad bit uncomfortable, owing to the cramped space. They also have a fairly large window by one section of the tables, so you can eat while life passes you by.. üòÖ

Currently hosting a Bao festival, so it was quite obvious to try the various off the menu baos provided. We tried the slow cooked pork ribs bao, which has a serving size of two baos. A beautiful combination of fermented bread, Sriracha mayo and lettuce forms the base, while the pork ribs and apple slices provide the body of the flavor, quite a treat. We also had our staple Momo I Am XO Rice and Pepper Sriracha Prawns. With jumbo sized numerous prawns, the side is a must try, so flavourful and delectable that we had to reach with our fingers to not miss the taste one bit.
We asked the staff for the desserts menu and we already had a liking to the Blueberry Cheesecake that they serve, so we asked for that. Safe to say, the encore did not disappoint at all. Warning : This can ruin diets and even the best of self promises. ü§£

Delicious! This was completely unexpected. Always thought Momo I Am to be a regular outlet like Wow!Momo, the only difference being that the former ones provide proper seating arrangements with a pop-culture infused ambience. But I was so wrong and what matters is that I am delighted to be proved wrong. Went there for lunch on a special day and the risk worked out. The outlet is located next to Kalyan Jewellers near City Centre 1. We ordered Momo I Am Wings and it was a delicious starter,the chicken soft and tender cooked properly with the correct amount of ingredients. After that we ordered Momo I Am XO rice (mixed). The rice dish tasted unique. It was very tasty and felt like only having the rice and nothing else. The taste of the rice is still stuck at my taste buds. Along with it we ordered the Pepper Sriracha Chicken. The dish went well with the XO rice and the pieces of chicken were beautifully cooked. The scent of pepper made the chicken smoky with a dash of tanginess infused in it. The cost is also very affordable compared to the type of food presented. All in all a very satisfying experience and looking forward to give it a second visit.

Momo I am saltlake was on my bucket list for a long time. Last Friday we gave a visit there and as bao festival was going on, we just chose the perfect time. A cozy outlet with wooden bench seating arrangements wins heart at the first site. We ordered our favourite Drums of hell, pan fried chilli oyster fish and Slow cooked pork bao as per their recommendation. Drums of hell is obviously not for the faint hearted though this time it was a bit less hotter. Pan fried chilli oyster fish was perfectly spiced and had a tangy taste. But the star of the evening was slow cooked pork bao. It was soft, so light to eat yet so tasty. It had lettuce, pickled cucumber and slow cooked pork pieces within it. We were in love with this dish and definitely going to try the other baos.

Rarely have I so whole-heartedly appreciated a restaurant! From the positive vibe of the spunky decor to the flavours of the last spoon of food, Momo I Am checked all the boxes.

Two of my friends and I landed up at Momo I Am on a Sunday afternoon. The place was empty when we had entered but filled up soon enough. I spent a significant time staring at the Make-Love-Not-War art on the walls.

We ordered Veg Thenthuk, Crispy Fried Chilli Baby Corn, Tibetan Chicken Rice Bowl, Chicken Bao and Thai Chicken Noodles Bowl.

The generous portions were sufficient to kill our hunger pangs and more. Service was swift and the food was simply delicious.

It all amounted to a modest 1040 and we left feeling thrilled that our expectations from the restaurant were met.

I have heard a lot of reviews of this place and this time when I was in Kolkata, I had to make a visit here. I went on a Saturday evening and the place wasn't too crowded and we got seats immediately. The first thing that struck me on looking at the menu is the price. Everything was so cheap. I can't imagine all of these items at some other place at the same price.

We ordered a momo platter but sadly the momos lacked salt. Either the chef forgot about the salt or they don't add salt deliberately and expect people to add it themselves. Also, apart from the lack of salt, the momos were just ok, decent at best. Then we ordered a pork short ribs. There were 4 huge pieces and for that price, it was unbelievable. The ribs tasted very good and made up for the lack in the momos. I would like to believe that it was just an off day and would go back to taste the other food options in the menu.

Tucked in right opposite the Andromeda building in the City Center area, Momo I Am is an absolute gem to discover. The cuisine is mainly Tibetan with loads of baos and soups thrown in. They have the most amazing selection of momos and accompaniments you could possibly imagine. The soups and pork baos are out of this world. The decor is artsy and quirky with graffiti on the wall. The sitting arrangement is nice and clean. Outdoor seating is also available. Staffs are well educated about their menu options. The kitchen is visible from the dining area and orders are freshly made by the chefs. Though they can improve their dessert menu but everything else is a complete A++. Definitely go there when you are almost broke but craving some hot meal this winter.

The first time I tried it's food, I was convinced enough to visit again and devour some more. The place is quirky by appearance covering everything with pop stickers and posters, and bright and fresh, and serves some amazing street style south east asian comfort food.
Bangkok street style soupy noodles: I swear by this one. I tried the veg one being a vegetarian and it was delicious. Coconut milk base with high notes of lemon and full with aromatic spices. Healthy and filling. It's a must have.
Veg croquette bao: bao is something I could eat on a daily basis. Soft, spongy and so light to eat. This bao dish was like a burger with a patty, lettuce, pickled cucumber and spicy mayo which could easily complete with a veg burger and beat it at its own game. 
Crispy lotus stem: I somehow like lotus stems and this was light, tossed with mild spices and crispy at its best.
Cheesecake: served with a scoop of vanilla icecream and drizzle of raspberry sauce, this one was a melt in the mouth experience. Pure heaven.

The best thing I like about this place is that there are equally respectable options for vegetarians which you rarely find in East Asian restaurants. Also, it fits well in the budget. I highly recommend.

This place was in my bucket list for quite sometime and this week I got a chance to visit it with my fellow foodie .to cut the chase short , we ordered their friend pork momo , prawn papad / chips ,mixed thukpa and pork short ribs.i like the way they served their food. It's like a poetry on plate. We liked their pork short ribs the best . The succulent pork ribs with their special sauce is a must order dish. The thukpa was a hit too.momo was okeyish. Over all the place is worth a second a visit.
PS. I like the decor and the quirky menu as well.

This is a cafe style food joint specialized in Tibetan cuisine. The decor is simple, yet attractive and very suitable for adda over light to heavy meals. I was eager to try BAO, so dropped in to try out this dish. We ordered Slow cooked Pork Bao and Pork T Momo Combo (fried). Both the dishes were delicious and prepared with care. I would have been happier if the quantity had been a bit more. For the combo, on request they filled the soup bowl at no extra cost. Overall a nice experience. I recommend.

AMBIENCE: There is a rugged look to the place. The wallpapers are real cute with pictures of pandas. 
SERVICE: It is fast and efficient.
MENU: Contains oriental cuisines from various places. 
FOOD: The chicken Bao was soft & fresh with the slight tinge of fish sauce. The stir fried Hoisin momos were melt in the mouth with the perfect amount of filling. The Thai basil noodles were also perfectly done with the crunchiness of the herbs. The cheesecake served with a dollop of ice cream was the perfect finish.

Great place with beautiful decor. Its located near city centre mall saltlake. Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Teriyaki Bao from Bao Festival Menu , Chicken Hangover Spicy Momo & Tempura Battered Fish with homemade tartare sauce.
Chicken Teriyaki Bao -  From Bao Festival we choose this bao item. The chicken bao was awesome. Soft, Juicy & Tasty. ‚ù§
Hangover Spicy Momo - Tasty & spicy. Looks beautiful. I loved it‚ù§
Tempura Battered Fish - Good item. But 1 piece of fish was uncooked. So I told them. Then the changed &  served 2 pieces. But taste wise it was okishhh with sauce. 
Overall a nice experience... and a real cozy place to hang and chitchat! Staffs behaviour friendly but service was bit slow.  Most important reasonable price.

#MOMOIAM is a pure delight for any Tibetian food lover and especially someone who loves #PORK.. Enjoyed a #PORKYDINNER today with an old friend at thier Saltlake outlet near #CityCentreOne.. The decor is top class and the digital graphiti on the wall is the first thing that catches your attention.. The striking contrast between too much decor on one wall and absolute nothing on the other is the standout factor of thier interiors.. Now, coming to the food - they are already very well known for thier #BAO and luckily they are currently having a #BAOFESTIVAL  till #17th Dec where they have kept specially curated #BAOS in the menu which you won't get otherwise.. Started with #PORKRIBSBAO in Plum sauce - an absolute delight to say the least.. The boneless pork ribs tasted amazingly good and the bread was supersoft as always.. Tried #JAPANESECHEESEHAMBAO - had an unique cheesy feel to it and was a great try yet again.. It was time to go to the two all time favourite dishes of mine when it comes to this cafe chain - #LHASAPORK - heavenly stuff which they claim to make with home made spices & #HARISSAPORK made with Shitake and well if you pair pork with Shitake - the outcome is generally outstanding and that is the case here as well.. These are the two must have dishes when you visit this cafe without fail alongwith the #shortribs too which we gave a miss tonight.. #soulfood #porkalltheway #mondaydinnersorted 

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..

Went there for Sunday dinner and somehow managed to get a seat without any wait. 

The warm lighting and colorful wall decor instantly won my heart.

The bao festival was going on so we ordered a chicken teriyaki bao followed by there signature fried chicken momo. The bao was excellently done - tasty and soft - melting inside the mouth. the momo , yes fried , was a bit too oily and tasted great. Then we had chicken cantonese gravy noodle and prawn salt and pepper. The prawns were very fresh and well done. The combination tasted nice. The drink option was limited so we ordered for some regular soft drinks.  Overall pocket pinch in 750 for two.

Soo this was my second time in momo i am, they always serve the best momos <3 though the "Hangover chicken cheese momo" disappointed me a little . We ordered three Bao dishes n they were soooo good. Specially the "pork marinated Bao with Sriracha aoili"..the only con is - they should just stop giving smashed potatoes in every dish -_-
Otherwise if you want to have good Tibetan food , visit this place . It's pretty much cheap n satisfying.

Anything, anyhow and anyway threaded to the land of rising sun piques my intrigue. Got the hints yet?
Manga styled menu card, graffiti on walls, hip-hop infused atmosphere. To boot, spotted one wall which was entirely a collage from manga sections. Hereby I approve Momo I Am, and therefore I am.

The place is very homely, makes you feel like you belong there. Coming from a person who can't go out and munch alone, I'd totally try that stunt here.
Lowkey lights, casual staff, mellow hip-hop beats. They even played Nujabes, iirc.

A'ight now to the DELICIOUS nosh that came forth.
Bruce Lee and Kamikaze as bevs to whip the start; nothing overtly great but serves its purpose.
Stir Fried Satay Momo: Bow to the king. Hands down to the best momos I've had in a while. With a neat outlook of fresh julienne cut veggies, this dish was truly a mouthful. Generousl fillings, thin dough. Could savour the juicy meat with each bite.
Soi 56: Shaped as fish fingers, this fresh outta sea fish prep is destined to smack a mark. Journeying from crunch to softness accompanied by tangy homemade sauce, it was truly momentous.
Momo I Am XO noodles: Man what a fun and funky dish. If hip-hop was a food, it'd be this. Like I literally had fun savoring each string threaded to music. The diced meat and veggies aligned perfectly with the thin, light noodles. Flavours, bite, satisfaction, it had all.
Shizz what a luck to stumble upon the Chef's Special board. Had I not done that, would've missed the decadent cheesecake with raspberry sauce. What a sugary, gooey taste. If dessert is a desert, cheesecakes are camels. Yeah yeah, bear with it. When something this good appeals to your urge, fulfilling it and more; there's never enough room for appreciation.
That's it, done and decided. If any place can take the low to high with music, manga, food, THIS is it. I'm coming again, yus.

Oh hi,I'm here already hahahaha. Just had to add this sequel.
Unaware, visited the Bao Festival and had the following. Hey, you ought not to miss it.
Slow Cooked Pork Ribs Bao: The pork cut was thiccccc and so juicy! A mouthful burst of flavours with all the spices coalescing. Amidst, stood the apple slices enhancing and balancing the mighty taste of the pork. It was SO GOOD.
XO Crystal Chicken Dimsums: It's the only kind of dimsums I've had that looks so sublime and kosher. As in I'd taint it's beauty if I cut through it.
The dough is as smooth and thin as satin silk and those gems glisten. Tasted like you're protecting a delectable XO spiced stuff under a pellucid veil.
Schezwan Plum Pork: Double cooked pork in home made chill plum sauce.
Man swear I can NEVER get over the combo of pork and plum sauce. It's THAT inviting. Viscous, sapid gravy with parallel cut veggies and those melt in mouth pork chunks. LOVE.

Seriously, the team; take a bow and you readers, take a bao.

Momo I am becoming the hottest trend in the city.

They are opening their outlets also in the most happening places in the town, like Golpark more, near Saltlake CC1.

Young crowd pulling place due to their affordable price of food without compromising on the quality of food.

Though they serve sumptuous platters of momo with veg, fish, pork, chicken, I choose to go with their topper "Drums of Hell", a simple chicken lollipop with tangy flavour, the uniqueness of rich taste definitely will make this as a show stopper.

Next was "Chicken Bao", a small piece of soft bread, boneless chicken wrapped with crispy &juicy chicken, pickled cucumber, lettuce and sweet teriyaki sauce. the softy satisfaction of biting the bao will make this a must-have. Obviously, they serve with basa and pork belly stuffing also.

Next turn was for the main course "Chicken Momo I Am XO Noodles" and " Zen Chili Chicken".
There was ample amount of eggs and Chicken to enrich the noodles. The noodles were perfectly fried with care and smell of the Hakka chowmien will make you feel the craziness of Chinese food.

Zen Chili Chicken served with 6-7 pieces of medium sized chicken. The stir-fried chicken was saut√©d with capsicum, onions and soya sauce. The distinctive taste can be spotted, which is different from normal roasted chilli chicken.

The Food was accompanied by Bruce Lee and Phuket All, two mocktails are more or less similar, but good. Bruce Lee was prepared with Cranberry, Orange, Lime, Chopped cilantro and Cucumber and Phuket All was prepared with Cranberry, Pineapple, Lime & Basil.

Location: Next to Kalyan Jewellers, near CC1
Price: Low - Mid
Must-Have: Momo Platter, Pork or Fish Bao, Drums of Hell, Mixed Momo I Am XO Noodles, Zen Chili Chicken.

A very small joint in the heart of the city yet serves one of the most mouth watering delicacies throughout the city.This place has taken north eastern cusine to a different level altogether.They have kind of fusioned some of the continental flavours to it and made something very unique and one of its kind and the Shyafaley was one example pf the same,must try this out while you are there.This place has a very unique menu to offer...there are plenty of next door dishes which u havent heard of yet bit the servers are a good guide.Amazing place amazing food.

So I've been craving momos for quite a while and I went to this place lately. I had an amazing experience. Firstly, way more than 'just momos', friends! 

It's easily located near City Centre 1. Cross the road, ask anyone about Kalyan Jewellers on the opposite side if you can't trace well. And it's exactly like a 10 second walk behind it.

The ambience was quiet,peaceful and funkly decorated with rustic brick walls on one side and colourful postered walls on another. 

For the lip smacking food options.

We started off with the Momo Platter. Contains 4 different types of momos in doubles,served with 3 sauces and soup. A pretty good deal for the price! 

I loved the Crispy Chicken Harissa Bao,next in line! Two chunks of saucy chicken balls along with zucchini inside a fresh steamed soft bun. Wowzer! It was my first time with bao,and I enjoyed it. 

For mains, we ordered Chitake mushroom chicken fried rice, and pork chilli.
The rice,fair for the price, with those big smoked mushroom pieces and chicken cubes was really yum. 
The Pork Chilli would be a treat for spice lovers. Moderately flavoured with onions and capsicums, it was dry,yet really delicious! 

All in all, a great time spent here. 


#Ps- The bao festival is going on here guys. Go grab your favourite!

Momo I am is my go to place. 
I love both, their food and the ambience. They have pretty well behaved staff. 
My favorites : Pork bao, khao San Thai soup, Thai bowl, pork momos, Shitake mushroom rice, Sriracha chicken.
The special baos in the bao festival menu are amazing as well. I have tried some and they are really good therefore, hoping the others will be good as well. 
Best part is that you get everything at a very reasonable price.

A clumsy rainy afternoon in this city of joy and finding some relief in this wonderful place. Most of my friends have visited ‚Äú Momo i am ‚Äú and they have highly recommended it as well. Finally decided to find it out ourselves. The salt lake branch though is very clumsy and doesn‚Äôt accommodate too many people but the food is outstanding. 

Firstly we ordered for a chicken teriyaki bao & then a pork thuppa. Bao festival is going on and ‚Äú Momo i am ‚Äú is offering a variety of bao‚Äôs. So hurry

So many positive and high rating attracted me to order from this restaurant. I tried their "Momo Platter", "Chicken Jhol Soup Momo" and "Pork Tibetan Bowl". The momo platter consists of 4 types of momo, namely, chicken momo, chilli basil chicken momo, mushroom cheese chicken momo and veg momo. The size of those momos were big enough and the inside filling was generous. But I did not like the sauce supplied with it. I have heard a lot about their Jhol soup momo. It was actually a soup that consisted of lots of veggies and 3-4 momos, tasted okeish to me. The pork Tibetan bowl consists of steamed rice, pork shyapta, chicken soup and 2 momos. The rice was boiled without salt, therefore it was hard to consume. The shyapta was very less spicy, tasted as boiled pork tossed in olive oil with minute amount of spices. In stead of chicken soup, I received a clear soup. Don't know whether it was a part of momo platter or not. Overall the experience was average, all the foods tasted as boiled food to me, very much less in spice. However, I want to try their other items that are spicy.

I had visited their golpark outlet and was highly impressed and well, this outlet is no exception either!
Ambience- this one has larger space than the golpark outlet. Decor wise, the walls are adorned by quirky graffiti and has wooden cutesy chairs and sofas. Its quite warm and cosy.
Order- crispy chicken harissa bao from their bao festival menu, momo I am xo mixed noodles and salt n pepper fish.
Food- top notch. Nothing to complain really. The bao was soft with juicy saucy chicken pieces. The xo noodles was amazing with generous portions of chicken prawn and egg. High on both quality and quantity. The salt and pepper fish was my favourite of the evening. Golden fried fish pieces cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crisp and served with sauteed chopped onions and other vegetables. There were 8 pieces in a plate.
Pocket pinch- 707 including 18%gst
Overall- momo I am is my new go to place for Chinese and Tibetan cuisine. Keep up the good work!

It is a well-known fact by now that I love my Chinese! And even a decent chinese meal uplifts my mood. But I cannot say this about Momo I am because it doesn't really serve decent but GREAT Chinese. I mean wow. What foods they serve and kudos for the presentation! Gravy noodles is one of my favourite food and not places can boast of preparing good gravy noodles but Momo I am just aces it. I loved the dish. I had also ordered Momo I am crispy chicken and Bali beach chicken. Both were really tasty. A thumbs up to the staffs for making a BANG entry into the already established Chinese realm of my very own Calcutta!

Visited this place after listening to so much of positive reviews about it. Literally a great place to indulge into the juicy taste of momos and have other tibetian or chinese food. Really awesome taste and well behaved staff members. Nice ambience adds on with that. We've ordered for a chicken bao , hangout momos , stir fried noodles and a jango. The best one i personally like of the lot was the bao, its so juicy and tangy tasty one. But overall liked all the dishes and a big thumbsup for momo i am. Looking forward to visit it again.

Location is easily accessible.. it's just beside Kalyan Jewellers (near cc1)! This one is quite spacious as compared to its chinar park outlet. üòá Coming to the food, we ordered Momo I am crispy chicken and tempura battered fish for starters. What they served looked like some meat balls, garnished on mashed potatoes! But certainly that didn't taste 'crispy' in any way! It was spicy and okay in taste. But battered fish was crispy from outside. The fish was soft and delicious. In mains, we just opted for mixed spicy schezwan noodles and kung pao chicken. I asked the attendant whether the noodles would be really spicy. He replied no! So we went ahead with our order. But after taking the first bite, üòÇ damn.. it was very hot (they had used dry red chilliesüò≠).  Ample amount of chicken and pork (can be customised with prawns) were used.. But apart from the fiery taste, I couldn't get any flavours! üòÇ

If you think this is just another momo joint just because it has the name "momo" in it, then I'm sorry to burst your bubble. The joint is ideally located close to City Centre 1, Salt Lake. Going in, I noticed that this place has ample seating arrangements and the decor is absolutely cool! They even have two tables outside the shop which reminds me of a small front porch. If you wanna enjoy the sunlight and have your food. Nevertheless, we went to the deepest end of this food joint and got ourselves seated. We ordered a pork bao, a chicken bao and a chicken shyafaley as a starter, a flat noodle chicken thukpa as our main course and finally a cheesecake and ice cream for dessert. Our main course arrived before our starter which was a little disappointing, but wasn't an issue. The thukpa was well made, the noodles were soft and the soup was delicious. And after that, we dug into our chicken and pork bao. Oh my god(Mimicking Janice), it was so good! I'd say the pork bao was the best thing I tasted there, if you're considering the food. Then we dug into our Shyafaley. Yum! Everything was so delicious, I felt like this was the first time I had been treated properly to Tibetan food. And then came the dessert. Honestly at this point, after eating everything, I thought the dessert wouldn't make me forget the delicious food I just had. But man, was I so wrong. The cheesecake made me rethink the food I just tasted. It was mouthwatering. A definite yes to this place. Do try out the starters I took and you won't be disappointed. Service was extremely fast and the staff was well mannered. Although I didn't try their momos, I will come back and try them in the near future.

Momo I am!  
This place is really awesome. It is located near city center 1.  The interiors are very quirky and the staffs are very courteous. 
Coming to the food we ordered Pork Bao,  Shyapta Chicken and Stir Fried Chicken Noodle. 

Pork Bao : This was the first time I tried a Bao and it was really awesome. The Bao was very soft and fluffy and the pork inside it was cooked well and the taste was good. 

Shyapta Chicken  : If you don't like much spicy dishes then you should try this. It consists of shredded chicken pieces.  The taste was good, but I expected it to be a bit spicy. 

Stir Fried Noodles : the noodles were okay.  It had a good quantity of chicken and eggs. 

Overall a good place to have some good food without burning a hole into your pocket.!

A popular food joint in Saltlake. It's not a huge one. Food is quite good and the service is OK. 
Some special mentioned items are -

Thai chili chicken 
Chicken & like leaf stir fry 
Fish bao
Bangkok noodle soup bowl 
Chicken satay momo 
Mixed fried rice 
Prawn hargao 

One negative point is they don't serve regular water. Either you have to carry your own water bottle or you need to buy mineral water. 
The portions were not much, compared to other nearly places they should be look at the quantity of some dishes. 
Total bill for 6 people was around Rs 2200 which is moderately pocket friendly. 

 If someone loves Chinese, can give a try!

We had "pork bao" and "chicken stir fry momo". The food was not tasty at all. I didn't like it. The ambience of the place was pretty good. Service was good as well. But they should improve the taste and quality of the food items. And most importantly, the price is not worth it. The quantity of the food items are less. 
And the pork bao we had, wasn't tasty at all. The pork was hard and the sauce inside the bao tasted very bad. The chicken momo we had was good.
Overall, I wasn't satisfied. But hope to visit again to try the other dishes as well.

Sudden cravings for chinese food can anytime hit me and I'm lucky that this awesome outlet is in my locality. I have tried their momo and others Tibetan delights but this was my first try on their chinese cuisine and it was totally on point. Had my all time favorite drums drums hell, though I found it a bit spicy than the one I had before. Mixed fried rice was amazing, light flavored and full with egg, chicken and veggies. Zen chili chicken was tasty too, but the gravy could have been more thicky. Delivery was on time.

Overall, the experience was okay-ish (dont feel like complaining).. some of the signature dishes were too tiny for a portion, some of them were just adequate. A few of their dishes may not be that appealing to the Indian taste-buds as they are a bit less spicy than the usual level of spices that an average Indian usually consumes. Drums of hell, chicken Bao and button mushrooms with cheese (6 tiny mushrooms of 1 inch across, topped with cheese and spice) were really good in taste. The rest were a bit better than average as they tasted different.
Ambience and the name of the food items in the menu book gives an anime kick to mind and is a place to sink in for anime lovers. As an anime fan one can recognize many anime characters on the walls and the menu book. Staffs are good but ever busy attending so many guests arriving and waiting to to get in. Pricing is a bit on the higher side at this restaurant, but definitely worth a try. Hence i gave 3.5 out of 5.

Hey guys, So I have been to Momo I am quite a number of times and they are absolutely amazing and so very inexpensive. 
üíìTo start off with momos, you should definitely try out the Hangover Spicy Chicken momo which is one of their best sellers. It is pan fried momos served with smashed potatoes and cream.
üíìThe next favourite dish I had tried is the Crystal Chicken Dimsums. They are absolutely the most delicious Dimsums I have had ever. They serve with two different kinda sauce which makes all the more tasty.
üíìApart from this, they have this dish tampura battered fish which is excellent and super delish. It‚Äôs battered fish fries served with creamy sauces with gorgeous dressing done on top.
Also do try out the chicken Bao and bowls for main course which makes the meal all the more filling. 
üíìOne more dish which I have lately tried is the Salt and Pepper Prawns which is another delightful dish which tastes like bliss. üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
üíìFor the desserts you should definitely try the cheesecake which is absolutely yumm. It‚Äôs served with ice cream and is totally a delight!!üòçüòç

If you like Tibetan food, you ought to visit this place. The ambience is pretty cool, replete with abstract wall paintings. Every time I visit this place and have the steam pork momos, it never tends to disappoint me. The momos are soft and delicious. They serve you along with soup. You can try the Chicken T-Momo combo, its contains two steamed buns and chicken shyapta. The shyapta is amazing in taste with a mild garlic flavour.
Well, not often you would find a Tibetan restaurant serving a mouth-watering dessert, but they do. They have a special menu on a daily basis and had cheesecake on my last visit. I had an amazing cheesecake after a long time.

This review was long overdue.. 
Went there during the pujas. Place was packed, had to wait a  bit but every minute  of it was worth it. A vast menu, xo noodles, harissa fish, hangover momos, bangkok street noodle soup were exceptional.. what an impression  they have left on us. Simply  bowled over.

I ate at this outlet twice in the past one month. My first experience was terrible. Really quite bad. We had ordered a Schezwan noodles then which wasn't spicy at all. It was simply like Haka noodles and quite bad at that. Upon complaining, they added a whole lot of pepper and served it leaving it without any flavour and tasting pathetic. Plus, the pan fried momos weren't great either. There was not enough sauce. The only reason for such quality could be that we went during the pujas but that's no excuse. 

However, I visited yesterday and had a great time. We ordered the Mixed Chopsuey and Momo I Am Crispy Chicken. Both were yum. The Chopsuey here is cooked really well and is probably their star dish. Our server also was reallllly sweet so brownie points for that. 

The outlet is not very small. Quite big compared to the Lake Gardens one and with their typical decor.

Located near City Centre , Saltlake , this place attracts a lot of customers, for their lipsmacking momos and other delicacies. I have always been a fan of momo I am , and used to go to their Lake Garden Outlet,, but the trouble is over. This outlet is near to my home and the boon to the Saltlake Residents.

What I Ordered - 

1. MOMO PLATTER : This is basically a platter with 5 different types of momos ,2 each . It was amazing .

2.HANGOVER MOMOS : This prepartion was was done in spicy gravy and the momos were quite juicy .

3.PORK BAOS : This outlet serves amazing baos and it was just too good to write down in words. 

4.XO NOODLES : The noodles were quite different from normal noodles and quite crispy in taste. 

5.KUNG PAO CHICKEN : This dish deserves a wow. Amazing in taste . Just that Kung pao generally has cashew nuts, but we got peanuts in their place. So please try to keep with the authenticity of the dish .

6. KAMIKAZE : It was quite refreshing . 

I am total fan of their momos. The service was prompt. The ambience deserves a worthy mention. Overall was satisfied .

What I ordered : 
‚Ä¢ The momo platter 
This comes with three types of non veg momo while one veg momo.
3 of those are steamed while one type is fried
‚Ä¢Thukpa
It was a pork thukpa which was generous in amount and has flat noodles in it. The boiled egg was the cherry on the top because usually thukpas don‚Äôt come with a piece of egg. It was too heavy for one single person to devour. But the taste was quite good 
‚Ä¢Spicy Chilli Chicken came with different veggies but the quantity was not that great
‚Ä¢ Cranberry Juice 
‚Ä¢Pineapple Juice

A good place to chill and the quirky decor adds to the aura.

I have had better quality food from other momo i am outlet. The food was very average. So it deserves a very average review. Sriracha pork was not at all spicy when it was recommended as a spicy dish. I was looking forward to taste some other things. But after having the dish i decided not to.

The colourful graffiti, paintings, doodle and collage on the wall just pulls you right in. It is a great place for a quick snack. The steamed momo, not surprisingly, is great with the soup at the side. So is the fried momo. I would say, the place is a must visit for a good momo evening.

THE MUST TRY IS 'PRAWN HAR GOW' it was from a different galaxy and made by chefs with magic wands! üòÇüòÇ

Went there on a Wednesday,  not much rush. The waiter serving us recommend their chef's special Baozi,  baked homemade buns with stuffing inside served with a thick soup.. Was baked just right,  juicy inside and the soup was yum.. The main course that followed too was exceptional.. Loved the Bali chicken. Cheesecake for dessert just added to the lovely experience..

I am writing this review particularly for the "Momo I Am Salt Lake outlet." After reading very good reviwes about this place. Yesterday I went to the Salt Lake outlet with my fiance. We went there with lot of ecxpectations. But we were totally disappointed with their service. We ordered Chicken Bao & Momo platter. The food was so bad, street side stall momos are better than this. I really don't understand why they are keeping unprofessional staff. All together only 3 to 4 staff was there who were attending all tables, we asked for water several times, they just didn't pay any attention to that. One big family grab a table, they just sat beside us. They were takling with each other so loudly & kids were screaming like hell, but they don't realize that they were seating in a restaurent not in a park. Even manage didn't say anything to them, though they have seen all other guests were felt very much disturbance because of that group. The manager and all the staffs were so busy in attending that big group. Another 2 groups were also there, after placing there order they have waited for 1 hour, after that they cancled the order and went away. Another family ordered something, their ordered dishes were prepared so badly, they felt so aweful & complained about it to the manger, the manager stood there quietly & he didn't ask for an apology to serve them better & they went away by rejecting the food. Our first visit and this much crap happened. I don't know about the services of other outlets. I would recommend everyone not to go in Salt Lake outlet. One request to the management please hire some good professional staff who can serve your guests better.

It's the first time I've walked out of a restaurant without eating a single morsel. Even after 45 minutes of placing the order we we're not even served a glass of water. The pork baos which we had ordered was served to us..stone cold. And they served us a wrong order on the remaining items. 
A restaurant should limit the no of customers they're taking in if they feel they can't serve them adequately. 
Giving the excuse of "we are full hence the poor service" does not serve the purpose.

Terrible service !
Had been there once before about a week back and liked their innovative menu and laid back atmosphere!  So went back today with family - my children and wife! The waiter did tell us it takes a little while for food to get ready ( though all tables weren't actually occupied) - so ordered our food and settled down for a little family banter! But with no service for next half and hour ( even water wasn't served) - we started to get a little restless - and by this time we also noted customers in other tables getting irritated too and protesting about the service (or rather lack of it)! Anyway about 50 mins from ordering, a soup and the pork Bao we ordered for arrived - and then it turned out that the soup was the wrong one and the waiter alleged we had changed the our order ( no one visited us after the initial order was taken - so there was no way we could change any order)  and was absolutely cold. The pork Bao was also stone cold and inedible  ( a sad deterioration from the delicious, fresh and hot dish I had tasted at the same place a week ago)! On complaining we were told that as they are near full ( but no customer actually was waiting outside for lack of available table) this was the best they could do! Sadly it meant after the food was prepared in the kitchen - there was no one who could serve it at the table and they just allow it to turn cold and unfit for consumption! A terrible shame for a place which showed a lot of promise and how extremely poor service can ruin all the good work of the chefs in the kitchen!

We would like to inform How Happy I Am. Tried Chicken Khao San Thai Soup which was okay for us cause of overpowering Coconut Milk, Chicken Fried Rice in standard, Chicken and Lime Leaf Stir Fry was so good, Thai Chilli Chicken was stealing our hearts, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was very average, we just can go eating Pork Thenthuk till we drop though little bit more pork in it can make us more happier, Pork Bao was too good and again we would like to get some more pork in it. Courtesy of this restaurant's manager was top notch. They have come here to change the culinary scenario altogether. It'll not be the same again. Strongly recommended for home delivery. We are planning to visit this place soon.
                    

Gradually reducing the quantity after gaining the popularity is not a good idea. Guests should not be taken for granted.

Food: Great. Everything they cook give  you feeling it's fresh  I Iwould recommend the chicken steam Momo, chicken bao and the delicious satay chicken rice bowl. 
the last time I visited they were not serving mocktails or desserts. 

Service is fast. Servers attentive. 
The quantity and price matches.

Well this place scores less only in quantity. Keeping the portioning part apart it is a pretty good place for Chinese and Tibetan cuisine lovers. Specially for people who love pork the pork baos are a must try. The interiors are very nicely done and it's location is also pretty good just beside kalyan jewellers near city centre saltlake. Whatever you order the only negative aspect for this joint is quantity. Even the water is not free. But I would surely recommend people to go there for good food at pocket friendly prices.

So with momo on our mind we happened to visit this place we had on our wishlist for long called Momo I Am. The interiors are beautifully lit with the seating arrangements well spaced. The interiors sync with the cuisines served here. We head into this corner where there was this wall graphiti full of Bob Marleys and North Korean dictators.Now for the food we had ordered chicken pan fried momo which was astoundingly garnished with fresh coriander leaves and onions.  Coming to the taste it was luscious and finely cooked.Next we went for chicken  Cantonese gravy noodles which was completely  tantalizing as it's name and which is plated up with Noodles tossed with eggs  tender meat pieces ,fresh and seasonal vegetables and delicious gravy. Stafs were affable and prompt in service.Overall this cosy little place satisfied our appetite for momos and more.

Visited this place on Nobomi, and were a little surprised when we found ample seating place given the Pujo rush gobbling up every corner of Kolkata. However, like any other Momo I am outlet, the place is neatly decked up with an additional outdoor seating available.

The concept of spacious seating arrangement has always lured us, and the Sector 1 branch didn't disappoint us. The place still had few tables left to be attended giving the five of us a quiet little corner to settle in.

We were delighted to find a regular menu instead of a trimmed and limited Pujo thingy. The food-capade started with Pan Fried Chilli Oyster Fish; hands down the star of the show. Deliciously cooked fish in delectable oyster sauce without unnecessary spices made it worth every penny. Then came the Marinated Fried Pork; a tad chewy, but tasted amazing. Next up was the Bali Beach Fish, although a side dish, we opted for the dry version rendering it as a succulent starter. Extremely well cooked and the Indonesian spices (as the menu suggested) were delightful.

With just quarter of space left, we made an audacious decision of ordering Chicken Stir Fried Noodles, Chicken Stir Fried Flat Noodles, and Chicken Shitake Mushroom Noodles with an additional Pork Thai Red Curry. I have been a huge fan of Stir Fried Flat Noodles and Thai Red Curry, and Momo I am didn't disappoint me yet again. The Shitake Mushroom Noodles tasted a tad different and intriguing.

Momo I am has rose through the Tibetan serving restaurant list, and goes light on your pocket while filling you up to neck. The Sector 1 branch is an added bonus with the Outdoor seating arrangement making it a winter delight.

Been there after office today. Quite value for money. ordered Pork Bao, Bangkok Noodle Soup and Chicken T-Momo Combo. Took home Momo Platter, which have 4 types of Monos, total pieces being 8, and Chicken Hangover Momo, which took quite some time to be prepared, compared to the other dishes. The Pork Bao was rather light and fluffy. It might seem big as a started believe me, it indeed IS just a starter, and don't expect it to reduce your hunger pangs. Bangkok Noodle soup, which has coconut milk in it. Though it is mentioned under the Thukpa category, I felt it to be more like Khao Suay, only the condiments were already incorporated in the dish rather than being provided on the side. It is the perfect comfort food that I can envision myself having on a chilly winter evening. Also I should mention that it was quite filling. Would love to go back there with my hubby, since he loves these flavours. Lastly had the T Momo with fried buns. Expected the Chicken Shyapta to be spicy, unfortunately it was not. Rather the bun was a bit on the sweeter side. The broth was watery as expected but flavourful.I personally am not a Momo fan, but based on my personal experience, I'd suggest a must visit if you are in the vicinity.

The best place to have momos & Tibetan cuisine. It is very pocket friendly and the staff is very helpful and courteous..... we ordered pan fried momos both veg and non veg with lotus stem fried in some sauce, all three were super tasty.... the decor is very modern very neat and clean. I ordered for one zen chilly chicken & one momo i am xo fried rice, authentically tasty.... every age group person must try it once... Overall i would rate it 100 out of 10.... keep up the good work...

A momo lover‚Äôs joint near City Centre 1.

It is well known for their high quality Tibetan and Chinese items. So after hearing so many good about it went there.
We‚Äôre not surprised because the rumours are quite true. They really serves a high quality Chinese and Tibetan items. We‚Äôre amazed about the foods the tastes. Well they deserves an applause.

About the place. It‚Äôs good. Don‚Äôt want to say it‚Äôs brilliant or best. Neither one of them is true. But still it‚Äôs good. The stuffs are well behaved. Even in a puja time visit. 

That‚Äôs all. Give it a try. A solid 8/10 from me. Thank you.

Good Food yet Poor Quantity!
‚óè Location: very near to CC1. Just beside kalyan jewellers.
‚óè Interiors : spacious. Well lit. Can accommodate 20-30 people. Squeaky clean.
‚óè Food: Among others, what we had are: 
1. Beverage: 
‚Ä¢ Kamikaze- cranberry juice punced with lime & mint leaves. Good!
2. Starter: 
‚Ä¢ Chilli garlic momo - okayish.
‚Ä¢ Fish bao - the bread was so soft and the fish tasted so good.
3. Main Course: 
‚Ä¢ chicken hakka noodles - fair.
‚Ä¢ chicken in harissa sauce - fair again.
Each one of these is recommended. But the serious issue is that the quantity of the servings are too scanty. Too much for one while not enough for two.

Loved every bit if food that I tried here, have called for home deliveries and tried the food at the outlet too, they never fail to impress!! 
The veg thukpa is to die for, the mushroom coriander soup is equally refreshing!
Must try the Veg San Choy Bou which is saut√©ed veggies in lettuce cups, it's a totally different concept with water chestnuts, simply loved it.
The spice lovers shall relish the Hangover spicy momo, which is momos saut√©ed with a few veggies and sauces and is yummy!!
For non spicy taste buds, the regular steamed momo is equally good. 
I quite enjoyed the Veg Bao too, which is a steamed thick bread with a stuffed cutlet which was a little cheesy too and tasted great!! 
Waiting to try more delicacies soon!

Been there last Sunday for the first time. A newly opened momo joint at Salt Lake from the legendary Momo I Am. Ambiance is nice, Easy to locate, spacious restaurant. We ordered the following dishes-
1. Chicken Pan Fried Momo- 6 pieces of momo tossed with sauce & served with a bit of salad. Taste is good. 
2. Pork Fried Momo- 6 pieces of momo fried and served with two dips & a bowl of soup. 
3. Momo i am Crispy Chicken- 8 balls of chicken served with mashed potato & dips. 
All of the dishes' tastes were very nice. A moderately priced restaurant. Staffs should be more professional.

Momo I am, located very close to City Centre 1, is a South Asian food joint serving mostly Tibetian delights.A small place, well decorated and arranged, it deserves a 4.5 out of 5 when it comes to the ambiance of the place.

We ordered pork baos, stir fried mixed noodles and Cantonese gravy noodles.The pork bao tasted really good and the pork was well prepared.The noodles (both) however were decent, nothing special. There was almost no chicken and very less pork in the noodles. Could've ordered veg and would seem the same maybe. Slightly disappointed there. The baos really made up for those.

Overall, a nice and affordable place.

We had Drums of hell and Pork momo for starters. Both were tasty. Next we ordered Pork Bao,a dish everyone should try
For mains we had fried rice with chicken thai green curry. It's definitely worth a try
As we went during puja days,the service was a bit slow. But the food quality wasnt compromised,so no complaints

Located near city centre this outlet is not that good. The ambiance was okay and the sitting arrangements were also good.

But the food was not upto the mark.
We ordered pan fried Chicken Momo's, chicken drums of hell and veg schezwan noodles.
The service was pretty slow and the Momo's were not good.The noodles were damnable.It was not spicy and when complained the person took the bowl and added lot's of black pepper.I was very disappointed.
The only positive thing was drums of hell which was properly cooked.

We three have gone there on Ashtami. We have ordered 
1. Stir fry chicken momo in hoisin sauce -- yummy
2. Chicken fried rice -- super tasty but quantity was a bit less as I came to know from review.
3. Oriental basil rice -- taste wise good but leafs were bitter. Again the quantity was less, may be as it was Puja then going on.
4. Bali beach prawn --  8 pieces good sized tender prawns, again it was very good to us but the hravy was little salty.
Service was very quick, though we went there in a rush time and the decor is also good.

So this was our destination for Saptami lunch. Me and my friends arrived here at about 1.30-2 pm. We guessed it to be a small place as it looked so through the glass door. But surprisingly they had a few seats inside also. Thankfully there were some seats available and we did not have to wait for our turn as was the case with other places.
The ambience is pretty nice. It's got wooden chairs and tables and pretty amazing spray pained wall art.
So for food we ordered Chicken stir fried momos, Fried chicken momos, Bangkok street noodles, Chicken fried rice, schezwan fried rice, Chili chicken, Schezwan chicken. We started with the momos and the first bite itself was mesmerizing. One of the best stir fried momos I have had is in here. The presentation was also admirable. The rest of the dishes also tasted good. But the Bangkok street noodles unluckily was 'sort of' a let down. The quantity was huge. It is basically a noodle soup. It had veggies, flat noodles, a soup, and an egg with sunny side up on top. It was good but the taste of the soup did not suit my palate I guess. So I recommend you try it for yourself to figure out if you like the taste or not.
Otherwise a great job! Kudos to the management as the food has been perfectly quantified and priced in my opinion.

The Momo is a south Asian variety of Dumplings that are said to have originated in Tibet. Served steamed or fried with a variety of meat and vegetable fillings its popularity has soared across the country. From roadside vendors to fine dine restaurants the Momo has made quite a culinary journey. Reevu Wangdi and Pravakar Yonzone the co-owners of Momo I Am started their first outlet in Lake Gardens fairly close to my parents‚Äô house and we were regular customers. Its popularity grew steadily and today there are branches across the city at Rajarhat Chinar Park, Salt Lake CD Block and at Golpark beside the one at Lake Gardens. We were invited for a tasting at the Salt Lake Branch where we had an absolute gem of a meal.

I have been there a couple of times and I must say it's been a pleasant experience. Reasonably priced delicious Asian cuisine. We had Momo I Am XO Noodles which were delicious. The amount of pork, shrimp and eggs in it were generous. For sides, we had Pepper Sriracha pork. Though it was delicious, the pork strips were too thin, so that was a bit of a let down. The biggest disappointment was the short ribs. It was our starter and we got it when we were nearly done with the main course. Even after taking so much time, the meat was tough around the bone, and the fat was not even on all the ribs. Though the plus sauce was delicious and wonderfully complemented the fat and the tender part of the meat. A cosy restaurant perfect for meet ups with family, friends and loved ones with a relaxed ambiance. And decent service.
Pork short ribs - 3/5
Momo I Am XO Noodles - 4/5
Pepper Sriracha pork - 3.5/5

Firstly, loved the interiors. They're so cool.
Now, I've heard about this place serving nice food and momo's being my favourite, I couldn't resist it.

So I ordered a Fried Chicken Wanton and Chicken Hangover Momo. I loved the latter, although they could have avoided the potatoes inside it, otherwise the spicy taste was on point. The wontons were okay but too dry for my liking. 

The bill including tax came to Rs 389. Quite affordable.

Do give it a try imo.

After hearing so much about this place I finally managed to go here and This place is so awesome!! 

Quirky wall arts and wooden chairs and table- the decor was nice and the place is quite popular these days!! 

Food- it has got good food written all over it!

Starting with VEG THUKPA- it was my 1st time trying it and I wasn't disappointed at all. It was so yum. The proportion are huge, 3 of us shared a bowl!! 
Taste-5/5 

Next we ordered the Salt and Pepper Mushroom- it was perfectly prepared but I still think the mushroom could have been cut a lil more smaller and could have been a lil more crisp! Nevertheless no glitches on the taste. 
Taste-4/5

Followed by- Steam momos- soft and served hot! Perfect to my liking. 
For main course we had - Schezwan Rice and Mixed vegetable balls in sesame sauce!! 

Both of them served hot and very delicious. 
The spicy flavour of the rice was correctly balanced by the sesame sauce veggies. 
Taste-4.5/5 

The best thing about this place was that you won't feel you've eaten super oily and fried food. It was very well prepared. 


The service was pretty slow(maybe It was a Sunday, or due to Vishvakarma pooja) , that's why the rating is 4. 

Else definitely this place will satisfy all your needs of Tibetan and Chinese cuisine!! 

Must try!!

This one is also really well decorated with the wall arts and grafitis , also wooden furniture. 
We ordered a portion of hangover spicey chicken momos, mushroom and spinach chilli garlic noodles, and zen chilli chicken (semi gravy) . 
All the food items were really nice and tasted great. Also quantity wise it was suffecient for 2 of us. 

However for drinks, we ordered a soft drink and a mocktail called Jango. It said it's a mixture of certain fruit juices.. but it was basically 2 flavours of tropicana mixed together. Wasn't that great to taste either. 

The food was really good!

Finally a Momo I Am outlet in Salt Lake.

It's a little difficult to quickly spot from the road, as it is sort of tucked in behind a low wall, even Google points to a slightly erroneous location - a few hundred yards ahead of the actual location.

It's quite a spread out joint, very roomy and bright with wooden chairs, graffiti painted walls, and the cutest decors. The mood is completely informal - with plastic bowls, plates and glasses, tee shirt wearing staff and a bright and cheerful menu card. 

The choice in the menu can be staggering, and the items authentic Tibetan. We started with Chicken and Pork Baos - exceptional both. Chicken Bao was chock filled with fried chicken, lettuce, toasted peanuts and a sweet sauce. Pork Bao had pork belly, lettuce and plum mayonnaise. 

For the main course, I ordered the good old Chciken Thukpa. Portion size is commendable, I could only complete it by myself because I was ravenous. The soup was not very thick, wholesomely filled with noodles, vegetables, boiled egg and minced meat - topped off with fresh spring onions, red and green capsicum and onion, and served with two kinds of side sauce.

Hubby ordered the Pork Tibetan Bowl - steamed rice, dimsums, chicken soup and Pork Shyapra - and he says this was a slight disappointment. The chicken soup side had no chicken pieces, and the Pork Shyapta had too few pork pieces. Another complaint will be the lack of desserts in the menu, and that there is not much by the choice for beverages. 

In all, a solid new hangout place for me, since the price is absolutely reasonable. Four stars!

I am a big Momo Lover! Whenever I visit the North East regions of India I always try  Momos. I am sure that a lot of you have seen several small roadside stalls that sell mouthwatering Momos! A magnificent view of the  Himalaya and a plate full of Momos! Pure Bliss! 
Momo I Am gave me a feeling like that! There is a small joint near City center one which is becoming very popular day by day. I had tried chicken steam Momo, pork stream Momo, hangover spicy Momo, and chicken bao. Each and every item tasted different. Stream Momos were fully loaded with the chicken/ pork. Hangover spicy Momo was extraordinary, little spicy, little tangy, with slight garlic flavor. I tried bao for the first time, the bao was good too. Depending on the food quality the price is decent enough. 
During the Durga Puja you can visit this place and have a chilling adda. I guess,  during the festival the place will be crowded as they have a small seating area.

This place is a definite try out. Pocket friendly as well as delicious foods. Best place to hangout with friends; attracting college goers or teenagers. I came here with my boyfriend & the sudden plan turned into an awesome plan.
The ambiance & the wall decors is really creative & attracted me the most, music is not so good that did not attract me much, tbh.
Food was awesome & delicious & was not at all disappointing, the food looks really fresh & . We ordered chicken bao which both of us liked "the most", it was really tasty. Definitely try this out! Next, we ordered xo crystel chicken dimsum, this was also good not as good as the chicken bao but yaa it was good, not at all a let down. Next, we ordered chicken mothuk & which was also nice. Had to order soup since my boyfriend loves it whereas i dont, i wanted to order something else but also wanted to try soup for the first time in a restaurant, so according to me it was nice but maybe my boyfriend can give an honest review for the soup. üòã
Overall, the place is really nice & its completely a pocket friendly place with yummylicious foods & beautiful wall decors.

Momo I Am is just the best place for a light but fulfilling summer day lunch! The Momo I Am at Salt lake is new and spacious and has beautiful graffiti decor on the walls. The staff are wonderful. The food is the best part undoubtedly. Their Bao menu is mouth watering and all the baos we tried were amazing - the Scampi bao wins followed by the Pork bao, then the fish and then the chicken! They have a light Cantonese style noodles that goes well with garlicky pork shyapta. The best thing on their menu I think is their Bali Beach Prawns. Their bowls are also super filling and delicious. The chicken bowl was a little spicy but for people who like spicy food it's perfect! The prawn chips with the fish bowl were authentic and aromatic. Their mocktails are extremely refreshing! They have a great soup called the Khao San Thai soup which is filled with prawns in Thai red curry and lemongrass flavour. Their interesting desserts include coconut ice cream and a raspberry bao with ice cream. The only thing short is the size of the momos and dimsums. But overall this place requires more than just two visits!

Edit: we recently tried the flat noodles thukpa and it was worth every spoonful! Also, the Camden fish bao from the bao festival was great! It even came with fries !

Outstanding food. Brilliant ambience. Wonderful service.
I would like to rate it 10/5 ! *_*
The quality of pork that they serve, is out of the world specially the dish that goes by the name - marinated fried pork!
What might appear a little funny is that despite the name, their momo is not that great compared to the other dishes! I have had better momos elsewhere; but the other dishes (specially pork) are indeed outstanding!
Would love to revisit this place innumerable times till I've had all the dishes at least once! üòç

I was really looking forward to trying food from here. Ambiance wise, this place is beautiful. But I wasn't satisfied with the food. We ordered pork bao, xo crystal chicken dimsums, and oyster-shitake mushroom pork. The bao bread was soft, as promised, but the filling was minimal in quantity and not the least bit crispy. The filling in fact was slippery and thus difficult to eat; not value for money. The crystal dimsums, true to their name, were translucent and smooth but once again the filling was disappointing and so was the sauce; once again not value for money. The mushroom pork dish was delicious and ample in quantity, but they were definitely neither shitake nor oyster mushroom, they were button mushrooms, however this dish was worth the money. Not looking forward to going here again.

Located near city centre 1,this outlet is not that big, but the ambience is pretty good and the food even better...all the items are very tasty,but items needing special mention are the bao and hangover spicy momos which are just too good,heavenly...but the staff were a bit inexperienced,they didn't seem adept at handling the rush...overall a great place for tasty food and moderately cheap on the pocket...

Location - near city centre beside kalyan jewellers,easy to locate.
 A charming cozy outlet with creativity and taste,not only momo but they also serve different Tibetan and Chinese delights,from noodles to fried rice to Bao's and some different sort of desserts, I've had there Momo's,bao,noodles starters and some chicken side dishes during my past visits recently,and one of the great thing about the restaurant is there serving time,whereas they've mentioned it in the menu that they need at least 20 mins for the dimsums but max 15 for any of the orders,the hangover sauce momo is a must for people who like a bit spicier things,the noodles tastes average but fresh,the side dish was something with crispy lemongrass chicken which was good in taste too and also the xo crystal chicken dumplings were firm and tasty!!! Good for a Nick nack as well as a different dinner night nearby!

This place was on my bucket list for quite a while and finally had the chance to visit. It is located near City Centre, Salt Lake beside Kalyan Jewellers Showroom.
The interiors of the restaurant was really well put together.They have an open kitchen.
We ordered the following foods:
„ÄãHangover Spicy Momo (Chicken)
„ÄãOriental Basil Fried Rice (Chicken)
„ÄãPepper Sriracha Prawn

The quality of food was mindblowing. The momos had a really thin coating and perfectly steamed and was served with stir fried vegetables and mashed potato. The rice and the prawn gravy was delicious and flavourful.
The staff was cordial and service was prompt.

They were courteous enough to allow us to wait after our meal was over at it was raining heavily outside.

A must visit place to tittilate your tastebuds with some quality food. 


UPDATE: On my second visit during this Puja, I ordered for 
‚Ä¢ Flat Noodle Thukpa 
‚Ä¢ Tenthuk
Both the dishes were awesome. It was flavourful and filling too. The quality didn't deteoriate even during rush hours of the Puja. Really commendable.

Located very close to city centre one. Easily approachable however may have difficulty finding this place as it has a small entrance which You may miss easily. Coming to food, not at all half bad. For the price you pay, you may not find a better oriental joint with large variety. Food is good too. The down point for this place is the people serving. They have no clue what's on the menu and very rude if asked the ingredients. They will ask you to check the menu instead of saying themselves. Also we over heard them bad mouthing us because we asked what type of rice they use for their fried rices. Especially the manager of the place used foul language to the server while referring to our group. I have had visited the lake gardens joint and the staff there was very friendly. This was a sad experience. And will request the management to take necessary actions on the manager of the place so that customers don't have to be abused in the future.

I was quite reluctant to go to this place at first, thought it was just some other place with expensive momos. However, it is so not the case. There is a wide variety of dishes and quite authentic I believe. The ambience is very nice, with all the wall postered, the staff is good with recommendations.

We had ordered Thai potato with basil and it was cooked nicely, perfectly crisp and with the excellent sauce. Next, we had taken flat noodle soup which was the star here. Generally, noodle soups are not supposed to be so good but this had a perfect balance of tastes in them sour, sweet and spicy, a great balance.¬†

It was a pretty reasonable dine-out and if you are really looking for some non-Indian type of Chinese food, good taste at a reasonable price, this is a great place to go.

I am a sucker of Momo and this was in my wish list for a long time... After our "Small" Pujo shopping (that's what My Wife says üòÄ ) we decide to hit this place... The ambiance was pretty nice... And since it's been a while i ate pork momo i couldn't resist.. The Fried Pork momo ¬†was freaking amazing, which only i had because my wife ain't into Pork, We tried out few other dishes which were great. I did expect a lot from "MOMO I AM Crispy Chicken" but it was okay-ish imo ... Can't wait to visit this place again to try out other dishes..

Love is the word that comes to my mind when I think of this place, absolutely love the food here. Nice decor, brilliant staff and outstanding quality food, this is a perfect place. Have tried a quite a few of their dishes with my favorite being there pan fried momos and baos. Recently tried their chicken satay momo, I was a bit skeptical about this dish but it turned out to be awesome. The fish dishes are brilliant as well when it comes to both quality and quantity. I love this place, really glad to have an outlet near my home.

A small and quaint place nearby City Centre. This place offers good food at a budget price. Minimum decor and pleasing ambience. Only thing they need to improve is on the service. They take quite a time in delivering the food straight to the table after taking the order.
Must try the Pork Bao and Chicken Thentuk.

Momo I am is A wow addition to Kolkata's new restaurant and cafe culture ... it have an amazing contemporary decor with a very interesting menu and a great sense of food presentation.. the staffs are friendly but just need a little more training on understanding their menu and it's contents, that would help for a better recommendations to the customers. They have a comfortable seating and they a cool dress code which makes it easy to identify the service staff .. location is fabulous (5mins walk from city centre) and parking is not an issue on any given day.. over all a must visit... @sayantan

Last time i came here I was not active on zomato. As far as I remember, I ordered for a bowl of flat noodles with chicken  and a chicken momo which was decent. 
Ambience is very good, with a lot of printed wall graphiti and contemporary lighting. 
As soon as you enter the place, you really feel you are in an asian restaurant and moreover the room freshner that they use smells like incense sticks which made me remember of a monastry in Gangtok. 

Today on my second visit I ordered for Thai bowl with pork.Order and service time was 20 minutes. The rice bowl came along with a bowl of soup. The soup had good chicken flavor and the rice bowl was really tempting. Good plate presentation with prawn cracker, soups and a small partition bowl of sauces. 
The red Thai  curry was not not red in colour, but it was something which tasted really well. The right amount of coconut milk,kaffir lime,lemongrass was used for a perfect blend and tasted wow with steamed rice. However only pork fat was used and hardly any pork flesh which I felt while eating. Overall it was quite filling, freshly made good lunch as well as value for money-INR 260 inc taxes. 
Also the sweet ginger at the end of the meal they serve with invoice  will clear out your palate for a next round of food. :)

Went with office colleagues for team lunch. Had a wonderful lunch with a twist in the taste. When we start with with the starters all of them stands wonderful. Crispy fried chicken, marinated pan fried pork, ninja fries, hangover chicken momos, pan fried oyster fish üéè all of these are excellent, a must try. The mocktail stands out with Jango, Phuketall & Kimikaze was enhances your tastebuds. Starting with the main course the chicken sweetcorn soup was too sweet. However, I did not like the Bangkok street noodle soup. The mixed fried rice, harrissa chicken, schezwan chicken was very tasty but the pork shyapta did not meet the expectation. The cheese cake üç∞ with icecream was very delicious. The ambience was quite descent. May be they work on their decor a little bit. Rest it was good experience and I look forward to visit again.

My heart thrilled with joy the first time i saw their banner outside and had been keeping a close watch since their days of construction , the location being a few hundred metres from my clinic . Finally last month i checked in , unfortunately the visit was for a short time. The decor of this new set up is definitely brighter and better than the previous outlets , with nice colourful wall arts and wooden furnitures , also a small outdoor seating is available.
ordered my favorite BAO with chicken stuffing and CHICKEN FLAT NOODLE THUKPA for two of us. While the bao is a must order here : steamed fluffy breads packed with crispy meat , sweet teriyaki sauce and lettuce , the thukpa was okayish with a watery broth and less chicken , tasted average but filled us completely. For dessert i couldn't find the banana panacakes or cheesecake as advertised in various social sites , only PANACOTTA was available with raspberry compote served with a banana fritter which we quite liked.

The next visit we had :
PORK BAO and VEG BAO , while the former was as good as i had in other occasions , the veg version had eggplant stuffed which kind of ruined the taste , perhaps a choice of some other vegetable stuffing can make it better.
ASIAN STUFFED MUSHROOMS - best of the lot , must try these Mushrooms stuffed with a chilli cream cheese filling , ask them to reduce the hotness quotient in case you prefer less. I would recommend ordering this.
CRISPY LOTUS STEM - tried lotus stem for the first item and the experience wasn't bad at all.
INDONESIAN GRILLED PORK SALAD - grilled pork meat with fat mixed with lettuce , apple , bell peppers and tossed with chili flakes and sambar dressing. Tasted decent enough , if not exquisite.
PORK SHORT RIBS - four ribs of mostly fat and scanty portions of meat was disheartening , though the plum sauce was lipsmacking.
RASPBERRY BAO - Fried Sweet bao resembling with Bengali version of 'malpoa' filled with sliced bananas and topped with raspberry compote plated with a scoop of vanilla icecream. I personally love bananas and berry flavours and this dish was simple yet a stunner .

Interesting concept and this place is great for dimsums/momos.
In dine in, liked the menu and the presentation. Walls with artwork and another with open bricks looked out of sync to me... otherwise nice ambience, great location.

Dined here one evening and also got a take away order.

Another evening ordered via tapzo.

Food is pretty ok. Its a good option beyond chowman in sector 1 area.

Momo platter was ok. The soup/broth served with the platter was cold. I had ordered a take away of the same which was boiling hot packed in a plastic pouch(!!)¬†
corriander soup was good. 

Staff was attentive and prompt.

Tapzo ordered food was ok - chicken momo and the stir fry noodles were really good.

sides of chicken in hoisin sauce was tasty. chicken in mushroom in thai sauce was very hot. i had asked for a less spicy meal but probably it didn't reach the chef...

Momo I am is a very popular destination for the Tibetan and Chinese food lovers. They have 4 outlets around Kolkata.This outlet is located near city centre 1,salt lake, just beside of Kalyan Jewelers. Wanted to visit this place for a long time. so, finally¬† we went there for lunch.
This is a nicely decorated place with lots of cool posters covering the wall and the place has well planned seating arrangements though the seats were not that comfortable.

We Ordered : Roasted chili pork, Mixed Fried Rice and Chili fish.

# The portion size was a bit disappointing. small fatty slices of pork cooked with bell peppers, onions and garnished with 
spring onions. Taste was decent, nothing extraordinary. 

# Mixed fried rice was nicely prepared with sufficient amount of chicken,egg,prawns and sweet corns in it.
Rice was well cooked and properly seasoned. The portion size was sufficient for two of us.

# Chili fish was decent. The pieces of fish were fried with lots of oil and for that 
the fish soaked a lot of oil. It was very oily but the taste was good. Though we expected 
the slices to be little more thicker but it was okay .

Overall a decent a place near city centre 1 area for some quality Chinese and Tibetan 
food. Staffs were nice and friendly but the service was bit slow and the prices were reasonable.....

Ever since Momo I Am opened doors near my home in sector 1 my best friend and I have been dying to visit and we did!!!
We ordered the Pork Bao that everyone was raving about... With double cooekd pork and a plum glaze and sauce... It was nice complement of sweet and savoury ... And was rather delicious... We also ordered the Bangkok Soup Bowl... Tasted like something we would taste on a trip to Thailand! Flat noddles, chicken, prawns and veggies, topped with a fried egg and drowned in delicious coconuty broth! Yummilicious! The pistachio cheesecake with berry sauce and ice-cream was delicious!! The only downer were the drink which had interesting names but failed to impress... Too sweet... And not distinctive... Kamakazi and Phuket were a miss! But we shall try something new when we get back!
PS: the decor was lovely!!! Like a milieu of South East Asian sights and artifacts.

Went there for lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon!! Located just beside Kalyan jewellers near city center.. we ordered xo crystal chicken dimsum which was very soft n melts in your mouth. For main course we ordered stir fried mixed noodles and chilly pork. Taste was okayish not as expected. Service was well upto the mark and they served pretty fast but kitchen was adjacent to the dining area so strong smell was coming which was a bit pungent and harsh!! Overall a nice experience!!

Veni Vidi Vici... That's the way I would like to describe Momo I Am. The food chain came, saw and conquered the food scene of Kolkata with it's innovative ideas. I have been a regular customer at the Chinar Park outlet. The newest addition in Salt lake is a cherry on the cake. Located conveniently near City centre mall this restaurant is one of its kind when it comes to looks, ambience and most importantly food.
The spacious restaurant with its Oriental decor and wall graffiti is a complete winner. The wooden furniture gives it a very sturdy and rustic feel. It has the quintessential 'Pahari' feel with Buddha statue here and there. The wooden framed mirror has enhanced the decor even more. The Tibetan posters add to the ambience and decor.

Listed below are the items tried on our visit to the restaurant:
1. Indonesian grilled pork salad - This was heavenly. If salad is this tasty then I don't mind eating salads at all for a meal.
2. Crispy lotus stem - If you are a vegetarian you should try this item. If you are a non vegetarian you must try this. Never ever did I have an idea that lotus stems could be prepared in such a delicious way. It's simply a treat for food lovers.
3. Pork chive waterchestnut dimsum - This dish is a new addition to the menu and if you love pork than this is a must try.
4. Chicken XO dimsum - Another addition to the menu where the chicken melts in your mouth. The way the dimsums are served has a typical Oriental feel.
5. Prawn hargao - As I write this my mouth is watering thinking about the taste of this particular dimsum. This is Ambrosia!!!
6. Shanghai chilly wontons - I love wontons and the ones available here is mind blowing.
7. Pork bao - This is an all time favorite. The crispy pork along with the Bao is an excellent combination.
8. Chicken bao - Go for it if you do not eat pork... It sure will melt in your mouth and melt your heart as well with its lingering taste.
9. Grilled Asian mushroom - Another vegetarian dish which was delicious. Mushroom never tasted better than this before.
10. Chicken hangover momo - This is the signature dish of Momo I am. The Hangover momo is an innovative item where the momo is served on a mashed potato base. It will give a new meaning to momos altogether.
11. Momo i am mixed chopsuey - I love chopsuey and I can vouch for the chopsuey available here. Just go for it is all I can say.
12. Bangkok street noodle soup - A full meal in itself. This one has the typical roadside flavour of Bangkok. The sauce and herbs used gives this dish an excellent aroma and taste. A must try.
13. Drums of hell - Oh yes!!! The homemade oils and spices used in this item is sure to titillate your taste buds and make you crave for more.
14. Cheesecake - When it comes to dessert Momo I Am has been extremely innovative and successful in creating magic.
15. Raspberry vanilla bao - Sweet tooth like me will fall in love with this item. An excellent dessert to end your meal on a good note.

What makes the food great here is the personal touch. The homemade pickles, oils and spices are the secret for the delicious food served at Momo I Am. The price point is reasonable and doesn't pinch much of your pocket. The staff is well equipped and has the best suggestions for customers who want their help in ordering food. Overall an excellent place for family and friends get-together.

The Ninja fries are amazing. Crispy along with stir fry capsicum..tomatoes..onions...chatpata you can say.
Ordered the satay chicken bowl. The quantity is a lot. Two people can easily have it.  The decor and ambience of this place is also great. Wall art....make up for most of the place. 
Another day had the Bali chicken and stir fry chkn noodles. Both had a very distinct flavour. However Bali chicken had a seafood smell which chickenatarians like me wouldn't like.

We still remember the first time we visited Momo I Am. It was couple of months after their opening near Lords, Prince Anwar Shah Road. The menu was short and the place small. We ordered their T-Momo combo, Chicken Shya-fale and Pork Thukpa, all of which we just loved. Also the colourful graffiti made the small place look unique. Returning home we posted on Facebook, ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a Momo I Am near our home :(‚Äú. Five years later it finally happened.
                                                                ...

There are places where the food is perfect ,ambience is classy and then there are places where you enter and you simply fall in love with everything.The walls are painted in bright colors with mirrors adorning the wall and the seating arrangement is all wooden.The staff is extremely courteous even though it was quite late at night.Looking at the variety of mouthwatering dishes we ordered 

1.momo platter
2.schzewan pork bowl
3.xo crystal.chicken dumpling
4.prawn chips

The momo platter had 2 of each types of steamed chicken momo ,veg momo,chicken cheese momo.The momos were juicy.But the star of the evening was the pork schzewan bowl.Schzewan noodles with chunks of pork and gravy .Served with two prawn chips on the side i was blown away by this dish.The noodles were spicy with a bite of pork in every mouthful ....a dish to just dig in.The last but not the least were the xo crystal chicken dumplings sitting pretty in the momo basket.The outer coating is   thin as paper stuffed with minced chicken served on d side of a bowl of clear soup.The prawn chips were not on the menu but the staff was kind enough to get a plate for us.Lovely ambience ,good food....kudos for their effort

I have been waiting for a long time to visit this place. This place has been in every food blogger's IG stories. So finally the wait was over when my brother declared he wanted to visit this place.

Food ordered : Chicken Steam Momo. Honestly I didn't find the momos mind blowing. The size was too small. It was disappointing.
Chicken Fried Rice : The quantity was good. Enough for two people. The rice was non oily and had a zing of spices in it. I liked it a lot.
Pepper Siracha Chicken : This is a dish I've never tried before but I liked it very much. It's not spicy at all as the name may suggest. Pepper and siracha chillies which are usually spicy. It's a bit tangy , a little spicy just to the rich amount . The chicken pieces are shredded and in a siracha gravy. It compliments with rice very well.
Chicken Cantonese Noodles : I found it quiet bland. The quantity is a lot again but it lacked flavoured. I found the noodles pretty normal in a soupy broth with chicken, egg, fried onions for garnish and veggies . Though my brother liked it a lot.

Decor : Probably this is the most attractive thing about the place. They have quirky painted walks which depict Chinese art and pop culture. I liked it a lot. The seating area is decorated with lights. There's a kitchen which is visible through the glass partition. The manager is very very polite and courteous and so are the staffs.

P.S. - I really liked the place. I'll visit again to try something new. It is pocket friendly. The best part is they've these bowls which are filling and that too on the cheaper side. One thing that has disappointed me is that the service is too slow. These guys need to buck up. Overall a nice, warm , cozy place. The food is good so I definitely recommend this place.
I've added the bill though it's not machine generated as they had some teaching issues that day. Instead the manger gave me a handwritten bill.

Never been to Momo I Am before though had heard so much about it from the time it began as a small place in Jodhpur Park. Had planned to order in on Swiggy but better sense prevailed and I am glad that we took the initiative to go over as it was an overall great experience. The seating arrangement is cosy and comfortable and though the place is small there is no feeling of being cramped. The service is warm and hospitable and I must mention the professional touch which is so absent in many of the restaurants which have sprung up all over Calcutta. Now last but not least have to mention the food....wonderful food in huge quantity at reasonable prices...started off with the Pork bao, Drums of hell and Indonesian pork salad...went on to the muthuk soup noodles and momo I am chopsuey...finishing off with raspberry and vanilla bao and an excellent creme brulee..we loved everything and can't wait to go back for more

The rise of a new Chinese food giant starts at momo i am. I have heard of it a lot. Ambience is nicely decorated. We ordered momo platter, momo i am wings and momo i am chopsuey. All of those were too palatable. 
The chopsuey was fantastically cooked. We thoroughly enjoyed the taste. The momo just melt in mouth. 
Long way to go Momo I am. Yes I know you there you are standing tall :)

The interiors are well organised and the atmosphere is quite pleasant . The staff are courteous and the prices of the food items are quite economical. We had the drums of hell which had 6 relatively large chunks of chicken , the taste was delicious and the presentation was decent. Then we had the flat noodle thukpa and the normal thukpa. The flat noodle one was spicy and pleasant to taste while the normal thukpa was kind of bland. However the portions were huge and was too much in the end.

Dimsums and momos. These two words were often a cause of my childhood dilemma because I could not distinguish one from the other. Later I learnt that these were disparate names for dumplings originating in two different Asian countries. Momos as we all know it, a favorite among Indians and one of the most popular Tibetan cuisine in India, played a colossal part in popularizing South Asian cuisine in India.

This is the newly opened branch of the successful brand called Momo I Am. Delicious in one word. Very kind and helpful staff. On informing them the pork ribs were too salty they promptly changed it and got a fresh dish made. The bao and momo jhol soup were exceptionally well made. The ribs although didn't make me go gaga but the sauces were really balanced. I think I was too full so couldnt appreciate it at that point. The Mocktails are light fizzy and refreshing. The decor is quirky and full of colourful posters.

I was quite excited to find momo i am in saltlake area and last night decided to order dinner from here. The delivery was quick,  with in 30 minutes. 
We ordered hangover chicken momo,  drums of hell,  one mixed chow and a chicken thai red curry. 
All the items was finger-licking good specially the thai red curry and the momo. Mixed chow was a regular one.
 Overall liked the food very much and would like to try different dishes from there very soon.

There has been a tragic dearth of good oriental cuisine in Salt Lake. A lot of residents are forced to travel all the way to Tangra, Central Kolkata for edible Chinese Food. I'm happy to say that Momo I am will make things a lot easier for us now.
Yesterday was I first visit to this eatery located near City Centre I beside Kalyan Jewellers. The restaurant is a renovated Ground Floor (and not a garage like a few reviews had mentioned) Seating is adequate however given the popularity they may need to take another floor! Pork Momo's and Chicken Wantons were great. (Im a sucker for Gojuchang or the Red Chilli Paste which you'll find at a few other places like BBQ on Park Street) The Spinach and Mushroom Chilli Garlic Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice and Garlic Prawn were tasty and I knew I'd be coming back. Ordering can get a little tricky if you're looking for items which aren't spicy. The food and the ambience all in all convinced me that I wouldn't be travelling to the likes of Golden Joy or China Town any time soon.

Located on the road opposite Kalyan jewellers and is an old garage convert to this coveted place. The decor with the open garden sitting and the bricked walls with all wooden theme and abstract wall graphiti is heart warming. The theme is carried on the cutlery and plates well, not to mention the washroom is all wooden too! 
Ordered a grilled chicken teriyaki salad, xo crystal dimsums, pork bao and a dessert of bao again.
The salad was well seasoned, and i must add very little on the chicken portions, not getting top mark hence. The pork bao was wow, with a spicy pork filling with lettuce and the bao breads soft, melting. 
The crystal dimsums 5 in number true too its name was crystally beautiful served with chili oil and red hot sauce. Taste was of sage like herbs mostly.
The dessert was a sweet fried bao with banana filling served with vanilla like ice cream and coconut drizzle.
The food was no doubt appetizing, the only negative being the quantity at such a price. The dimsums topping the list. The bill was 850 for these items and were nt very filling.
The nicest think was the dessicated, sweetened gingers served in place of saunf. Kudos to the team for their hospitality as well.

Momo I Am has been an old name in the city of joy. Whenever, i think about Momo I Am, the first thing which comes into my mind is their small jodhpur park outlet, a series of graffitis on the wall and pocket friendly prices at which momo‚Äôs, noodles and thukpas are served. Nonetheless, this outlet of Salt Lake was visited by me as a part of Blogger‚Äôs meet which was conducted by one of my friend here. It is located near Kalyan Jewellers. Take the left from City Centre 1 which goes towards Balle Balle Dhaba or Gold‚Äôs Gym Salt Lake.

Tossing up with garlic and loads of spices, we have managed to give Chinese dishes an Indianized spin through and through. Not just the transformation, but the level of Chinese cuisine acceptance is so high in India, that we have opened chains of restaurants while celebrating it.

One such delight which has recently sprung up in Sector 1, Salt Lake is Momo I Am. Youth friendly and a tad bit quirky, the ambience exudes a very casual and chill vibe.
Neatly stacked up wooden tables and beautiful graffiti up on their walls, gives a clear indication of how they want their image to be. We visited this place recently to try out this simple and classical cuisine with a touch of young energy.

Defining themselves as restaurant serving Asian, Chinese and Tibetan, they have brought a tantalising great atmosphere and the name itself gives us the idea of how great the place will be and this one definitely surpassed their previous endeavours.

We started off with the

1. Indonesian Grilled Pork Salad : It was their special grilled pork salad with sambar dressing and fresh herbs. It was absolutely delicious as well as the healthy mixture of fresh fruit ingredients made it even more healthier. The pork slices were soft and tender to chew.

2.Crispy Lotus Stem : Never thought of something like this dish. The Lotus Stem was deep fried and tossed with exotic spices giving it an entirely amazing taste. The stem was crispy and spicy making it a great dish to start off with.

3. Pork Chive Water Chestnut Dimsum : This dish was an absolute beauty. The pork and the chestnut blended well to give a mind blowing taste overall. It also had a tangy touch along with it. Loved it totally.

4. Prawn Hargou : Fish being one of my favourites specially prawn, this item turned out to be soulful. A fish lover will definitely not get disappointed with this prawn delicacy for sure.

5. Chicken XO Dimsum : The Dimsums were juicy and tender to bite. Each and every chicken dimsum was cooked to perfection and therefore they were flavourful.

6. Shanghai Chilly Wantons : This item tasted authentic¬†
They were smooth and went down the throat with a delicious sensation.

7. Chicken Bao : Soft steam bao was stuffed with crispy chicken pickled cucumber, lettuce and teriaki with toasted peanuts. The garnishing done made it's presentation remarkable so was the taste. The Bao was also easy to munch because of it's softness.

8. Pork Bao : Soft steam was stuffed with double cooked crispy pork belly, lettuce and plum mayo. All the spices summed up made it perfectly balance, giving it an altogether amazing taste!

9. Grilled Asian Mushroom : Soft Mushrooms were stuffed with cream cheese, cilantro, grilled and finished with sweet chilly.

10. Chicken Hangover Momo : Momo loaded with tasty chicken was stir fried with vegetables and spicy sauce.
It managed to wow us with it's perfect shape, taste and texture. The momos were juicy and with every bite it left us craving for more.

11. Momo I Am mixed Chopsuey : Noodles were fried and topped with eggs, cooking wine, soy, tender meat pieces and fresh seasonal vegetables. This signature dish is itself a wholesome delicacy. Beautifully cooked, the wine and the meat pieced meddled well to give a great taste overall. Loved it.

12. Bangkok Street Noodle Soup : Noodles cooked in Thai style with eggs, coconut, tender meat pieces, fresh and seasonal vegetables. The taste of coconut on one hand and the essence of spices on the other made the item decent and delicious.

13. Drums of hell : Chicken drum sticks were fried and tossef with a special hellish but delicious home made sauce. This elegant dish turned out to be a tough competitor to the elegant dish, Drums of Heaven which generally everyone is familiar with. The flavours became prominent slowly with every bite of the chicken stick.

14. Cheesecake : The Cheesecake was a perfect cracker. Being it a dessert item, it was served with vanilla icecream. Sinky, soft and cheesy are not enough to describe the cheesecake. We were in love with this one. The essence was captured perfectly.

15. Raspberry Vanilla Bao : The Bao served with tasty vanilla icecream was indeed a wonderful way to end the meal. The texture was great and we loved this too.

The quality of every item on their list is top knotch and the quantity is enough to fulfill one's food cravings.

To be honest, this place is a bombshell waiting to explode. The place has everything that it needs to be on the list of the good chinese cuisines in Kolkata.

Not only does the taste of food here woo you, but even the prices won't burn a hole in your pocket. Recommended highly.

Ambience : 4.5/5
Service : 5/5
Taste quotient : 4.5/5

Chinese and Asian cuisine in general has captured the heart of most of the residents of Kolkata. Responding to this huge demand for Asian cuisine, a very large number of restaurants serving this style of food has opened up all over the city. Momo I Am has been around for a while now and has been consistently serving up some of the best Asian dishes ever to be found in this city. I had the opportunity to review its Salt Lake outlet last evening and it made for a very memorable experience which I am going to talk about now.¬†Locating the restaurant is not difficult at all since it is right next to the City Centre Mall. Once you walk in through the door, you step into a well lit spacious restaurant that can easily accommodate a lot of people. The other thing that catches your eye is the beautifully painted walls with bright colors and one has to really appreciate the effort put in decorating the place that well before even taking their seats. Another point that has to be mentioned is that the guests can view the kitchen where the food is prepared which is very clean and tidy and well maintained.¬†Let us come to the food on offer without any further ado.¬†1. Indonesian Grilled Pork Salad- We start off with Indonesian Grilled Pork Salad. It was light and fresh and came with a well balanced delicious dressing. Everything you can expect from a salad with well cooked soft pieces of pork. It made for a great start to a meal.¬†2. Crispy Lotus Stem- One of my favorite starters, it was crunchy and spicy and loaded with flavor.¬†3. Chicken Hangover Momo- Certainly my favorite starter here, it was served with mash potato under it. The momo itself was pillowy soft with a genuine portion of filling and the sauce it was cooked in was delicious.¬†

4. Pork Chive Water Chestnut/Chicken XO Dimsum- Another variant of dumpling, these came with really tasty fillings and two spicy dips.¬†5. Prawn Hargao- My favorite one among the dimsums served last night, the filling was absolutely perfectly cooked and delicious.¬†
6. Shanghai Chili Wantons- These came with a delicious chicken filling dressed in chili oil and was sure to set your taste buds on fire and yet leave you craving more.¬†7. Chicken/Pork Bao- A bao is essentially a steamed bun with a filling. In this case, the fillings were chicken and pork along with cucumber and lettuce and mayo and the bun itself was very soft and well steamed. Absolutely loved this dish.¬†

8. Grilled Asian Mushrooms- Whats not to love about mushrooms stuffed with cheese and that too so well cooked and soft. They were definitely melt in the mouth and delicious.¬†9. Harissa Pork- This pork cooked in a harissa spicy sauce was tender and flavorful.

10. Momo I Am Mixed Chopsuey- Noodles and gravy is definitely my favorite Asian dish and I could live on it forever. This was loaded with vegetables and meat and gravy and was absolutely my favorite dish of the day. This is the kind of comfort food I live for. 
11. Drums of hell- Chicken drumsticks cooked in a spicy secret sauce. Unfortunately this failed to impress as the crispy coating was way too much in comparison to the actual meat inside and I did not find much difference from the usual chicken drumstick we find. It had gone cold too by the time I ate it, so that could have been the cause. 12. Bangkok Street Noodle Soup- Flat noodles, chicken and coconut milk broth made for an absolutely winning combo. One plate of this and it was bound to make anyone happy. I could go on and on eating this without getting tired.¬†13. Cheesecake- Served with vanilla ice cream. Perfect end to a big happy meal. There was nothing to fault with this delicious dessert. I was surprised I could even eat at this point.¬†14. Raspberry Bao and Ice cream- Just when I thought the meal was over, this arrived. The bao was soft like before even though it was fried and was stuffed with bananas and sitting on raspberry coulis. Another winner of a dish.¬†I'd really like to thank Momo I Am for the food and

I've been a regular visitor to their first branch which they had set up in Lake Gardens area. Since then, I've fallen in love with the food which they had been serving over the last couple of visits. I've considered this outlets' chicken and pork momos as the best I've tasted in Kolkata due to the freshness of the food and the ingredients.
Coming back to point, I was actually quite relieved and excited when I heard that Momo I Am are opening a branch in Salt Lake, not just as I reside here but the market in this part of town has a lot of potential to grow and expand rapidly.
On my first visit today to the Salt Lake branch, I came along with family, and ordered -
‚Ä¢Chicken noodles with shintake mushrooms
‚Ä¢Chicken steam momos (personal fav.) 2 plates
‚Ä¢ Chicken Bao
‚Ä¢ 2 glasses fresh juice
There was nothing much to say apart from enjoying the food as it did not let us down. The taste of the momos and the Chk. Noodles‚Äã were better than ever before. There were no major issues there. But the standout for me was the Chicken Bao which I had for the very first time. It was a soft dough type of bun consisting of chicken mixed with some sweet n spicy sauce along with the veggies. I simply went into overdrive mode after eating this as it was simply delicious and succulent. The overall environment was perfect enough for me to not get satisfied. Great evening spent with family enjoying our favourite food. Thank you for the experience Momo I Am. Will keep coming ‚Äãback for more.

Visited this place on last Sunday for lunch. Situated near Kalyan Jewellers this place may look like they have little seating facility entering you will realise tjis place is not that small actually. All the wall decorations and dim lights create a cool and cozy atmosphere. Staffs are good and very attentive. We had Chicken Pan fried Momo for starters which was absolutely delicious. Then we tried Momo I Am XO Mixed Noodles with Harissa Fish. Botb complemented each other very well. Fish was soft and fresh which most of the resturants cannot provide. The sauce tasted very different. Noodles tasted good as well. Quantity is very good. Price is reasonable.

I was invited to visit this branch of "Momo I am "in salt lake sector 1 on a Tuesday evening for a food tasting event. This review will have a brief insight about the interior designing of the hotel, the hospitality that I have received and the overall taste of the food.To start off with, I would like to thank the owner of "Momo I am" to extend his warm hospitality to me. Along with that, almost all of the servers were really well-mannered, nice and polite."Momo I am" is one of the trending pan-Asian restaurant places in Kolkata, it's branch exists in Golpark, Lake Garden and Rajarhat, New Town. However, I only visited the one in Golpark and now, in salt lake sector 1. Just like it's branch in Golpark, the restaurant heavily focuses on the interior wall art designing inside the restaurants, giving the overall a very catchy and trendy look in the eye. The restaurant uses bright-lit brights, yet it is not very harsh on the eyes. The furnitures are made of wood, but yet it does not give any discomfort to the back or to the overall body posture. The overall feel of the restaurant, as a customer, is delightful. But the main part of this review will focus on the food quality.‚òÜ Indonesian Grilled Pork Salad¬†‚òÜ Crispy Lotus Stem‚òÜ Pork Chive Water chestnut dimsum
‚òÜ Chicken XO dimsum
‚òÜ Prawn Hargao
‚òÜ Shanghai Chilly Wontons
‚òÜ Pork Bao
‚òÜ Chicken Bao
‚òÜ Grilled Asian Mushroom
‚òÜ Chicken Hangover Momo
‚òÜ Momo I am Mixed Chopsuey
‚òÜ Bangkok Street Noodle Soup
‚òÜ Drums of Hell
‚òÜ Cheesecake
‚òÜ Raspberry Vanilla Bao

All of the food, ranging from starters to main course and to desserts, including both vegetarian items and non-vegetarian items, are absolutely delicious. To mention some of the most delicious items on the menu would be Pork Bao ( the meat is tender and sweet ), Prawn Hargeo ( dim sum wrapped in thin, translucent sheet ) and Drums of Hell ( absolutely delicious ). Bangkok Street Noodle Soup tastes great, if you like the taste of coconut milk and lemongrass in the soup, and the flat-noodles makes it even more tasty. Although not much of a vegetable fan, vegetables combined with grilled pork makes the dish very appetizing. If you're looking for something tangy, I suggest trying out Shanghai Chilly Wontons; it's thin-like sheet melts in the mouth.My overall experience in Momo I am, salt lake sector 1 ends on a good note. On the brighter side, the pricing system of Momo I am is not really expensive. I suggest people trying out this branch of Momo I am and try out their different food on their menu. You will not be disappointed in the food.

A newly opened outlet of the popular Momo I Am brand . Located near City Centre 1 ( in CD Block ) & just beside Kalyan Jewellers showroom . Decor & seating is nice & comfortable . Staffs are helpful in explaining the dishes . Had the following :
Chicken steam momo : It was quite good with generous amount of stuffing inside . Though missed the hot chilly flavour of momo sauce . Associated momo soup was nice . Presentation was really nice .
Chicken Hangover Momo : It Was a kind of fusion food served on a base of boiled potato . Presentation was attractive .
Chilly Pork : Quality of pork was good . Vegetables & pork was nicely cooked & sauce was in right proportion . Presentation was again attractive .
Would definitely visit again .

I have always heard great reviews about Momo I am, but sadly never had the opportunity to visit. When I was invited for the launch of the Salt Lake outlet, I was excited! Finally I would be visiting the very famous Momo I am!

The interior is done up in a cheerful manner, and the joint is quite a spacious one. I really loved the wall art, which happens to be their signature. Even on a weekday, the outlet was teeming with people, which depicted the popularity of this outlet only within a few weeks of opening. 

Coming to the food. We tried out the new menu inclusions that ranged from salads to dimsums to baos. 

‚Ä¢ Jhol Momo Soup - This was the first item that was served to us. I had never had anything of this sort before. Momos were served in a flavourful broth which also had broccoli, bok choy and babycorn. It had a mild and subtle flavour. 

‚Ä¢ Cucumber and Feta Salad - Slices of cucumber were mixed with a number of spices and sauces making it juicy and was finally topped with Feta Cheese. If you want to experiment, this one's for you.

‚Ä¢ Indonesian Pork Grilled Salad - This was the next salad in line which looked super colourful! Crispy meat strips mixed with a number of veggies. Although it looked good, the flavour of fish sauce was too overpowering. 

‚Ä¢ Asian Stuffed Mushrooms - Cute, button shaped mushrooms filled with cheese which oozes out when you take a bite! This dish turned out to be amazing. The mushrooms had the perfect taste and texture.

‚Ä¢ Shanghai Chicken Wontons - I've always loved wontons, so this wasn't an exception either. The wontons were stuffed generously and had a thin outer coating. It was served with a spicy and tangy sauce which went really well with the wontons.

‚Ä¢ Truffle Oil Veg Crystal Dumplings - These dumplings were stuffed with spinach and veggies and were served with sweet chilli oil.

‚Ä¢ XO Crystal Chicken Dimsums - These dimsums are totally gonna win your heart! The stuffing is just perfect and they taste super awesome. 

‚Ä¢ Pork Bao - One of the signature items of Momo I am, which can't be missed! The baos were soft and sticky and served with heavenly pork! This tasted divine!

‚Ä¢ Momo I am XO Fried Rice and Harissa Fish - Good Ol' Fried Rice, Momo I am style, with Harissa Fish is one of the best combinations ever! The rice tasted amazing and so did the fish, which was cooked to perfection. The pieces of fish were soft and succulent. Loved the smoky taste.

‚Ä¢ Raspberry Bao - It was time for dessert and this stunner of a dish was served to us. Fried bao, glazed with saffron gomme and stuffed with banana slices. The baos were sprinkled with coconut shaving and layered with raspberry coulis. On top of this, it was served with a scoop of vanilla icecream. One hell of a dessert, which satisfied me to the core! Perfect balance of sweetness. 


With this, we ended our fiesta at Momo I am, and I'm impressed. Their menu is vast and requires more than one visit. Hence I'm surely going to be back to try out some other signature items off their menu!

Nice ambience and decor.....new flavors of momo....we ordered pan fried momos in satay sauce, really liked the subtle nutty taste of the sauce. In the main course, we ordered spicy shezwan mixed fried rice accompanied with Bali beach chicken (spicy alert...!!)....both the dishes as per taste and quantity were really good and pocket friendly. The staff were welcoming. The only let down was in the drinks department, we had ordered mocktails named "Bruce Lee" and "Kamekaze", both were served not so chilled and tasted blunt....Also we were served the main course on the same plates used to serve starters, so the minus 1 points overall. Would definitely recommend people looking for comfort food at pocket friendly prices.

Veg Bao & Noodles @ Momo I Am, Salt Lake ‚ò∫

With the sudden influx of Chinese and Tibetan cuisine outlets in the city, Kolkatans are getting introduced to a totally different set of street food style Oriental dishes and liking them as well. 

Thankfully, at least one or two vegetarian options of such dishes are always available, thereby satiating the curiosity and taste buds of the vegetarian brigade.

Veg Bao is one such dish.

Recently, while spending a relaxed Sunday, we wanted to order food from one of the new Chinese outlets and zeroed in on 'Momo I Am'. A plate each of Veg Bao and Veg Shiitake Mushroom Noodles were ordered via 'Swiggy'.

Hailing from assorted Chinese cuisines, Bao or Baozi is basically a steamed bun with some filling inside. Much variations exist in it's types of filling and methods of preparation.

Our earlier brush with Bao was in the form of a circular closed steamed ultra soft bread with filling inside. It was kind of shaped like a Kachori or Baati.

But, the two portions of Veg Bao that arrived from 'Momo I Am', resembled more of Tacos! Soft steamed circular discs were folded into semi circles, lined with lettuce and stuffed with eggplant, potatoes, in-house sauce blend and toasted sesame seeds.

The Baos were spongy, sweet, spicy and tasty.

Veg Shiitake Mushroom Noodles were the usual stir fried noodles infused with the scanty portions of - onion, bok choy, capsicum and shiitake mushrooms.

The Noodles were well cooked. They tasted average.

The food parcel also contained a transparent sachet of some kind of orange colored chili sauce. We poured it on both the Baos and the Noodles. The sauce tasted nice and gave some life to the otherwise bland Noodles.

The entire combo would have tasted way better if the quantity of sauces was less in the Baos and the quantity of shiitake mushrooms was considerably more in the Noodles.

The quantity of food was sufficient for two people. The amount of Noodles displayed in the pic is less than half of what had arrived via Swiggy.

Price -

Veg Bao: Rs. 140/-

Veg Shiitake Mushroom Noodles: Rs. 150/-

Grand Total: Rs. 362/-, inclusive of Packing Charges and GST.

A note to the readers: My review is strictly based on the home delivery. Hence no comments on the ambience and the service of the restaurant.

I had ordered a Chicken Thukpa and a Momo I Am Crispy Chicken. Both the pictures have been shared. 
Chicken thukpa had keema in it which is not acceptable. Then you should name it Keema Thukpa. Not to mention the quantity of that chicken keema was also quite minimal. The Thukpa broth was good but the noddles were bland even after soaking in the broth. I suggest to use rice noodles instead of regular ones. 

The Momo I Am Crispy Chicken is a disappointment. It is simple friend Chicken without any sort of flavouring. There was no taste of the five spices that was mentioned in the menu. There was a dollop of what I believe is tandoori mayo which is not what should be the dip for any Tibetan cuisine. This dish needs complete makeover.

Presentation was good but food was not worth the wait which was more than 1 hour and definitely not worth its grain ! 

Wouldn't be looking forward to trying again !

Going in with the hype is a fatal disaster. This restaurant is the result of the same. Visited this today. Nice decor nice way of serving the food but quantity is not even adequate even for a single person. Looking at the quantity they're serving it is a lot pocket pinching. More over their food isn't that great. Just so so average food. Big no no for everyone looking to visit here.

I was excited to see this outlet open in Salt Lake and as soon as it was up on Swiggy I gave it a try.I ordered crispy chicken bao,prawn hargao,pork in hoisin sauce.This was my first try for a bao but this one was so dry with a very sweet filing.Basically all the filling were mismatched and it was too sweet for me.The hargao was another disaster.The covering was so dry that it almost broke.The prawn filling seemed like artificial prawn and soya mashed together with no flavour.The pork dish was still palatable,though it had too much of soupy gravy still the pork was tender.I was really disheartened with the food quality they provided.The only best thing for me was the chilli oil they provide with the food.It was very flavourful and had a nice kick to it.

Momo I Am has turned into Calcutta's most hyped destination for momos in just a few years. With the successful launch of two new branches in Golpark and Salt Lake, they have taken the hype to an all new level. Now, Momo I Am is different and infact better than most other momo based restaurants in the city. The reason being the fact that Momo I Am exercises expertise not only in the common variants of momo, but also in a number of innovative types of momo. Also, they are not just restricted to momos. They have a number of Tibetian, Chinese and Thai dishes in their menu, which are unique as well as exotic.

I am a huge fan of Momo I Am. I love their momos, baos, noodle soups, etc. I was recently invitated at the latest Salt Lake branch to taste the new additions in their menu. The restaurant is located near City Centre 1. It is spacious and well decorated. The wall graffiti is their signature theme, which they have beautifully retained here as well. What caught my attention was the crowd on a weekday evening. The place was buzzing with people and I was surprised to see the fast service, which is indicative of the staff being properly trained.

Momo I Am has introduced a number of new items to their menu. We started with the salads. Asian Cucumber Salad with Feta Cheese looked nice. It was very refreshing, owing to the juicy cucumber slices, which were marinated with a tangy mix of spices. The next salad was Indonesian Grilled Pork. The pork was crispy and was mixed with juicy veggies. There was a typical smell of fish sauce, which if neglected, it was a perfect salad with proper mix of veggies and meat.

The Jhol Momos came in a huge bowl, which seemed like a meal in itself. The momos were served in a flavourful broth, consisting of broccoli, babycorn, chillies, etc. The chicken momos were well stuffed and tasted great, while the broth was light and subtle. The Chicken Shanghai Wantons were spicy and tasted amazing. What I loved about their momos were the generous stuffing and the thin outer coating.

The next in line were the dimsums. The Truffle Oil Veg Crystal Dumplings had a delicious stuffing of spinach and mixed veggies. The XO Crystal Chicken Dimsums were stuffed with minced chicken. Both of these variants came in baskets and tasted out of the world with the chilli oil dip. The Asian Stuffed Mushrooms were heavenly. The mushrooms were stuffed with cream cheese and cilantro, which won my heart.

The main course included Momo I Am XO Rice and Harissa Fish. The combo of both was excellent. The rice was spicy and was tossed generous portions of egg and chicken. The fish was cooked in a smoky harissa sauce, stir fried with shitake mushrooms. I fell in love with the beautiful texture of the fish.

I didn't want to leave Momo I Am without trying my all time favourite, the Pork Bao. It came in a few minutes and looked just the same. The bread was extremely soft. It was stuffed with crispy pork belly along with lettuce and mayo. With one bite, there was a blast of flavours in my mouth. I was lost in its beauty again.

The meal ended with their brand new dessert, Raspberry Bao. The bao was deep fried, glazed with saffron gomme. The fried bao was stuffed with banana slices, sprinkled with shredded coconut and layed over raspberry coulis. It was served with vanilla ice cream. This was one hell of a dessert, where the sweetness was perfectly balanced. The bao was soft and tasted excellent with the raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream.

Overall, Momo I Am is the best place in the city which you must visit to satisfy your momo cravings. Infact you can't be happy with just one visit. You need to keep coming here again and again, which might turn into an addition after some point of time. Such is the charm and beauty of this place !

Tried chicken BAO, stir fried mixed noodles, Momo I Am Xo  rice, chilli pork and white mushroom sesame chicken. Quite impressive was the noodles and the chilli pork. Amazing experience, will be visiting soon.

I love the food here. Had the Bangkok Street Noodle soup, Chicken rice bowl, and cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake was to die for. I love the bangkok noodle soup, aa its a one bowl meal, with a rich broth, soft meat, and lovely spaghetti. The chicken rice bowl was good too, but i wasn't blown away. Rating 3.5 as I found a strand of hair in my dish which i brought to their attention, and they promptly replaced my dish. 
I am happy with the service and the food and this place is becoming my go to place on a cold day.

I'm a great fan of momo I am. Previously I've been to only the lake gardens outlet and today I tried the outlet near to my residence. This is much better than the other outlet that I've visited. This one is much more spacious, more accomodation capacity and definitely much nice decor. Those pretty wooden benches and lightings. The food is definitely great. We had ordered fried T momos and Kothay chicken momos. Great quantity, reasonable price and quick service. Loved the visit. Highly recommended.

Nice and simple interior design.. they even had manga art at certain places.. spotted naruto too.. :D

Ordered crispy chicken, stuffed mushroom, and bao..
Loved the bao.. though i feel not many would like it.. stuffed mushroom was good too.. crispy chicken was kind of okay.. overall expirience was fair..

Maybe i should have tried the noodle soup dishes..

But what was pretty depressing was the price.. the quantity was way below what was charged.. billed 800 overall.. -_-

Momo I Am has opened their newest outlet in Salt Lake. Located beside Kalyan Jewellers, this has a cute entrance. Quite a lot of space inside with limited seating arrangements on the side porch. The interiors have been well thought of, their signature designed/painted art walls are of course present in this outlet too! There is an open kitchen, you can actually watch your food being made. Being honest with the food, the grilled pork salad was unconventional and probably little bit of work is needed with the dressing. The cucumber Asian salad was good and refreshing. The mocktails were excellent.¬†

The XO Fried rice, and the Harissa fish are recommended as part of the main course. The Pork baos were excellent - sticky, roasted pork served inside soft baos placed on a wooden rack. The momos, and the jhol soup were repeats from our previous visits, and we have always liked it! :)

Visited this restro to celebrate my birthday yesterday. :) its located right on the lane beside kalyan jewellers near cc1. Its a small and cozy place the decor reminding me of an authentic tibetan restaurant. Had ordered chicken bao for starters which smelled of corainder leaves and tasted awesome something different from the ones i have tasted before. It had lettuce leaves grilled chicken mayonnaise. And corainder leaves. The presentation was impressive. A plate of bao consisted of 2 pieces. Served on a wooden rack. Then ordered the momo i am xo rice the quantity was certainly enough for 3 people . a chicken side dish named zen chilli chicken which was more spicy than i had imagined. Moreover both the maincourse was good in taste. The chicken consisted of some 12 big pieces. Wanted to try their dessert raspberry bao served with vanilla ice cream but could not as we were both full by then. Would come back for that@rohit shaw

Decor: mind-boggling...the collage of photos with the subtle meaning will make your grey cells alert while you try to identify the faces..Staff : Courteous..helpful and very pleasant..Food: is out of the world. The pork momo just the right size juicy and fresh.The pork bao perfectly balanced in tartness and sweetness, it's a must eat. The thukpa just the right quantity bursting with flavour and filling..The Cantonese gravy noodles was comparable to nothing so unique is the taste..The Cheesecake .. is enough reason to throw my diet plan out of the window...all these comes at an extremely pocket friendly price even post GST. .so all foodies just go and get your fill and you will come back for more.. A question for the owners...where can I get the Tibetian dolls that are there ? I loved them too...üòò

This is a recently opened outlet of Momo I Am located beside Kalyan Jewellers close to City Centre 1.
Not hard to locate, this outlet is particularly big having a Tibetian theme for the d√©cor.
Now coming to the food we ordered,
1. Pork fried rice- it was good though it tasted like any other chicken fried rice having small pork pieces.
2. Chicken steam momo- this tasted good but the coating and the soup were a bit too oily.
This joint is a budget friendly option for people who wants to try Tibetian food.
Would visit again to try the other items on the menu list.
Happy fooding! ‚úå

Had heard a lot about Momo I Am and finally got to tick it off my bucket list.
Visited their newly-opened Salt Lake outlet close to City Centre 1and next to the flagship store of Kalyan Jewelers.
Ambiance is relaxing with cool funky background music; the interior is furnished with comfortable wooden tables and seats. The decor consists of quirky graffitied wall art, wood polished mirror, row of cute monk statuettes on a shelf, hanging lanterns, branchlike wall lamp etc.
We ordered the Hot and Sour chicken soup and the Momo Platter comprising Chicken Momo, Chilli Basil Chicken Momo, Mushroom Cheese Chicken Momo and Veg Momo.
I usually find faults with the soups in restaurants (when it comes to soups I'm hard to impress) except a few places, and Momo I Am Salt Lake turned out to be one of those rare places that left me spellbound by their absolutely flavourful hot soup.
The dumplings were delicious as well, served fresh and piping hot from their hygienic kitchen, and tasted good dipped in sauces accompanied with the separate soup for the platter.
The ginger sprinkled with crystallised sugar offered after the meal as fresheners were unique and pleasant tasting.
Overall had a rather enjoyable experience here one rainy evening, made all the more delightful by the taste and aroma of lovely Momo. Would definitely recommend this place or any of their other popular outlets to momo lovers and those fond of Tibetan, Chinese, and Asian/South East Asian food.

Well another feather in this brand's hat. Always been a fan of their quality food at reasonable prices that can beat any top brands around. With a bigger capacity restaurant here in salt lake , things could only get exciting for people around this area.
Signature dimsums, grilled chicken teriyaki salad, and bowls on offer are some of the must trys..many more visits to come. The decor is out of this world.

This was my first ever visit to any Momo I Am outlet and it turned out to be an evening well-spent. The place is well-lit, with warm tones, welcome wooden seating, and we clicked selfies in front of the Lady-on-the-Wall signature mural. 
Two of us, me and my friend, ordered a Phuket All and the Chicken Bao first. I loved the Baos. It had a crispy stuffing and the sauce was sweet and tangy. We ordered the Momo I Am Chopsue Noodles and asked for a dry preparation of the Hoisin Chicken. The staff was courteous and the chef well-attuned to the demands of a customer. 
Since it was raining heavily, we hung back a little longer and had the Cheesecake. This was the best part of my evening! I have a weakness for sweetened biscuit bases, and this was the right amount of granulated, crunchy heaven with the cheesecake sitting pretty amidst a berry coulis and vanilla icecream. 
Thanks for the welcome! Hope to visit again! :-)

Home delivered a couple of different kinds of pork dishes and I failed to differentiate between the two. This annoyed me a little. They were both rather tasty but they were indifferent from each other. The chicken something that my friend got, however, was rather succulent and nice. But that could be because chicken is better in India after the hormoned garbage that I am used to now in the US.

Momo I Am is finally in Salt Lake! The outlet is located close to CC1. This is their 3rd or 4th outlet. The interiors are so cool - you get such positive vibes on entering! There is ample seating arrangement.¬†

This is the first time, we tried their mocktails, baos and dimsums, and I was blown away! We tried "Brucelee" a ginger based mocktails, definitely recommended.

We were served quite a few dishes, and the most recommended are listed here:

- Grilled Pork Salad: It had roasted pork meat, apples, cucumbers, and the usual greens with their in-house dressing. The salad was different, in the sense, the texture was good, and had a sweet and tangy taste to it.

- Pork Baos: Such soft baos - easy to eat, and the filling was overflowing. Filled with grilled pork meat, lettuce, and their sauce - must try!

- XO Fried Rice and Harissa Fish: ¬†This is a good combination in terms of taste and quantity. The fish was so soft, and the gravy not overpowering. Teamed with the rice, it fills you up in seconds.

- Chickem Momo Jhol: This is concocted dish - is a mix of thukpa, and momos, and veggies. I am always biased towards soup based dishes - hence loved this.

- Raspberry Bao - This is the first time these guys offered a dessert, and it is so so good! A raspberry sauce drizzled bao served with a scoop of vanilla coconut ice cream scoop made in-house.

D√©cor is amazing... Service provision is also good... And most importantly foods are so so delicious... All most every restaurant prepare a specific dish name "drams of heaven" but they prepare "drums of hell"which is hell only by its name but taste wise it is heaven.. quality and quantity wise every food items are so yummy and mouthwatering.. but I have only one suggestions don't ever try their "best dessert" because it is  the worst dessert I ever try (according to my taste bud) which is a caramelized banana....

Earlier I'd been to one of the older branches and I was really satisfied with the place.
This new outlet is right next to Kalyan jewellers near city centre 1. 
Firstly, the ambience is mind blowing with graffiti on all the walls in nic bright colours. Truly a treat to the eyes. The quantity of the food - amazing! We ordered a bowl of pork fried rice (RS 150), it contains eggs too which was enough for 3 people. For a side, we ordered a Hoisin chicken semi gravy. It was disappointing, because it was way too salty.
Then, the momo platter - two veg options(one strand, one fried), and two non veg portions of two momos each(RS 160).
Very decently priced food. Not too good but if you're a little low on cash and really hungry, feel free to hit this place!

The place is well located near cc1 and on the main  road. The ambience , as usual is vibrant. This place has good energy. The food is always good . Loved their chicken steam momo and Chicken chowmien. The place is pocket friendly and the service is also pretty quick.

We ordered Chicken Momo which was good, made with fresh flour. My friend ordered Chilli Garlic Pork Noodles with Mushroom and Spinach. The noodles were really tasty. And we ended our meal with two coke. Our total bill was 416. Will visit again! :3

Ambience is pretty good with fair decor. Food is average, not that brilliant as expected from this place. We tried Short ribs which was quite sweet and had only fat and no meat. Tibetan bowl and Thai bowl was pretty impressive with big portion size . Japanese Panko fried chicken was also average. Other items was so so in taste. Too much tax they charge and not accepted for the service recieved.

Nice interiors, good ambience and courteous staff. Now let's jump on to the food.
Ordered Lhasa Pork, Chicken XO Noodles, Basil Fried rice and Hangover spicy momo.
Lhasa Pork - very tasty and well cooked
Chicken XO noodles - different but had a slight smell of fish oil
Basil Fried Rice - different and good preparation
Hangover spicy momo - good combination of momo with mayo but the flour used was a bit stale
All the preparations had a lot of oil go into them.
Overall, nice place to have Tibetan and Chinese.

Momo i am has been my favorite momo place since a long time. It has 4 outlets in the city now, the one in lake gardens being the first. Yesterday they opened their new outlet near city center 1 ,  next to kalyan jewelers.. which is like 2 mins from my place :) yayee..! 
I planned to take my mom and brother for dinner there as they had never been to any of their outlets. We were warmly welcomed by one of the owner of the place. Even the staff is very friendly and courteous.
The interior is pretty similar to that of the other outlets with wooden chairs and tables and the walls have funky artwork and wall graffiti.
I am big fan of their momo platter - which consists of 4 kinds of momos, two of each kind.  So we ordered one momo platter and one veg stir fried satay momo for starters. Both of them were very fresh and the filling was very juicy and crunchy. 
Then we had momo i am XO rice- which is a part of their new menu, stir freid noodles and mix veg balls in sesame based sauce. Both the quality and quantity were upto the mark.
We finished our meal with their signature dessert i.e raspberry and vanilla bao. It is a must try. 
All in all, this place is a heaven for people having a taste for Tibetan and Chinese food at very pocket friendly prices. 

P.S- do try their mocktails and other desserts. All of them are equally good. And they have also added a lot of new things in their menu.
