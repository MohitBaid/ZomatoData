A Very small place, gets very smoky with all the sheesha smoke, but still we preferred going to this place once in a while as it had good food, served hukka n booze too. But last time we went, it was horrible food.. Pesto n arabiata pasta were so oily n tasteless. They say they have changed the menu.. But by even looking at the food it is evident that a lotta changes has happened in their kitchen...obviously for bad.. 
The place is not worth visiting ne more.

Haze is located right adjacent to Nocturne.  It has comfy seating, good food and hookah and plus a expansive bar menu. We went when we wanted to just sit and relax over hookah.


We ordered
4 toppings pizza 
spaghetti alio olio
Watermelon margarita
Peach ice tea
Hookah

The food was really good both the pasta and pizza were lovely. The aglio olio is gonna see me revisiting for it. But the drinks were disappointing. The iced tea simply lacked flavour and the water melon margaritas tasted very bitter.
Upon request both drinks had additions done and tasted much better.

The hookah flavouring was nice and the hookah was smooth.

Small cozy cafe cum Hookah Bar located in the underground of the HSBC building of Shakespeare Sarani near Rawdon Street. Ambience and service is okay. The place is too stuffy with theme of funky decor. Ordered choco mojito and chicken fried momo tossed in chilli garlic oil which tasted good. This place accept cards only if the billing amount is above 1000 INR which is bit inconvenient sometimes for the guests.

Haze is situated in the same building as Nocturne, so you get a parking place for your car/any vehicle. If you go down the stairs, you will reach Haze. Upon entering, i was a bit disappointed that it is such a small place. Just few tables and thats it. It is well lighted. We ordered for a blueberry shisha with mint base. Shisha was fine and for drinks we ordered a vanilla shake and a regular canned coke. The service was prompt, maybe because of the fact that it was dead empty when we arrived. It is also a smoking place for the cigarettes lover. Maybe i will drop down here next time with my friends. Thanks for the service! Keep it up.

It's the best place to chill in kolkata... The food is amazing... The place is quiet and the ambience is really good... The perfect place to come with friends who coming for the purpose of chatting over a cup of coffee and Shisha according to preference... The entire group of job holders and managers are very friendly and have good etiquettes. You can also have your corporate meetings in this place.

Its an okay place. Kind of small, hookha joint, u go with group of friends. I felt lil claustrophobic, as its like a dungeon, below ground floor, low ceiling. Funky décor, finger food, hookah, big screen, overpriced liquor, plush crowd as its nice location.
