We went there after viewing it on Zomato. Brilliant service. It is very fast. And attends the customers with great warmth. The quantity of each dish was more than sufficient. It not only sufficed us two but also it is reasonable. The prices are quite reasonable. We tasted the Basmati rice, dal, shukto, aloo bhaja, macher kalia and Rajbari special chicken kasha. All of them were mouth watering. Moreover, the chicken, fish and the rice smelled nice and fresh. Do try it! We loved it! The presentation and the way if serving is nice too. They serve in the traditional plates, bowls and glasses( kashar thala) which enhance the bangaliana completely! The ambience is soothe, calm and rejuvenating. And the music at the background will surely lighten up your mood. Atleast it did for us!

The restaurant, Rajbarir Khawa, at Survey Park, Santospur, Kolkata, near EM Bypass, is a must try for all wishing for authentic Bengali food, at authentic ambience.

Although there are quite a number of such Bengali cuisine restaurants in Kolkata, the prices there are exorbitant. However at Rajbarir Khawa, the rates are pleasantly reasonable and pocket friendly.

The menu is delightfully delicious. The bhetki paturi is a must try when you visit here.

This place has been quite an interest for me since it has opened, the name suggested that it was something exotic and traditional. On a house occasion I ordered for Bhetki fish fry - The fish was good but the seasoning was too much and crust too thick; next was Rajbarir Polao with Mutton Balls - it was really nice and non oily yet the mutton balls rather keema balls ;-) were too hot and spicy; lastly Chitoler Muitha - it was too greasy and unnecessarily spicy, the taste of gravy covered the flavour and aroma of Chitol. It was a decent dining experience, I would suggest to make food less oily and spicy.

Pathetic bengali food I have ever tasted. Ordered dum aloo & luchi for breakfast. Packaging was poor, all the oil got spilled and spread in the carry bag. Dum aloo was superloaded with stale gravy, there was hardly any potatoes in it. The gravy was so bad that can't even explain in words. I think they must have given some leftovers of previous night as the gravy was completely cold. Coming to puri it was made from atta, & not from maida, texture was brownish and the size omg!! its so small that you can put entire one piece in a single bite even a small child can do so.. I have noticed few days back they were hanging the banner infront of their restaurant that " give us ratings on zomato and we will give 10% discount" . I think doing this they can't improve their ratings as bribing is not a solution rather they should work hard in order to serve quality food to the customers only that can give them a good rating automatically. I personally won't recommend this restaurant to anyone till the time they improve their quality. You people truly need to hard in improving the food quality in order to survive in this competitive market.
Good luck.

If you crave for authentic cuisines of Bengal then this is the place to be. We ordered the Bhapa Ilish or hilsa fish cooked in a banana leaf with tangy mustard sauce. It tasted heavenly when had with Gobindbhoger Bhat or short grain rice. The mutton preparation Kosha mangsho had subtle flavours found only in this land. 
Very courteous staff, and amazing ambiance!

Today's food expedition took me to this wonderful Bengali restaurant beside Santoshpur Avenue, Raajbarir Khawa. The restaurant is situated within 300m from Ajay Nagar more and very easily accessible. I went with mah parents just to enjoy good Bengali food away from home ;). And actaully that's what we got.
In Raajbarir Khawa there are around 12 tables each with 4 furnished chairs. Ambience was good and homely with songs of Hemanta getting played from restaurant sound system.
We have ordered quite a lot of food from menu. Following are the items and their review :
Alu bhaja - good
Poster bora - i love this item and always order when I come here... quite good
Patoler dolma with fish stuffing - I liked it a lot (it's on a spicier side)
Vetki paturi - good (though can do better I know)
Chitoler muittha - very good ...u should try it
Ilish bhapa - good but I missed d spiciness from masturd
Barishaler Ilish - it's a bhapa Ilish prepared with@ coconuts...okay to taste
Raajbarir kosha chicken - only item I didn't liked as the chicken was quite hard
Aamsotto chatni - very good...just loved it
Raabri Ice cream - quite creamy and good

Overall it's was a nice experience. And dad paid the bill so double happiness :D

Happy eating ;)

We ordered gondhoraj chicken, Bengali fish fry for starters, kaju kismis polao, steamed rice, chanar dalna, chitol macher moittha, bhuna mangsho, doi murgi for main courses and , nolen gurer ice cream, vanilla ice cream as sweet dishes. Overall great experience!!

It's the Best restaurant for Traditional Bengali foods. They serve very Delicious real Bengali foods. As I am a Bengali, I know the real taste of Our foods. Its, even more, tastier then the foods we used to eat at Home. But the waiting time is too much. You have to wait at least 10-15 minutes to get the foods. But the Smell and Taste is yummy. Even now I can smell the foods while writing a review. You must dine there at least once. The cost is a little bit high but value for money. After eating you will be fully satisfied. Best for Lunch and dinner. They also do Parcel if you want to take away food to your home. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.

Useless guys in the restaurant ..... typical sloppy 1970s kind of a service. No point speaking to them. Nothing will happen to them..... they got my food delivered in a plaything pack.... it was floating... as the container had opened and I was not even 30secs in to describing it.... the restaurant, in the most sloppy manner..... said "please complain to Swiggy.... I cant help it!!!!" in Bengali. And then there was no point talking further.  If they care for anything called service, and have a vision to be something more than a middle class restaurant in a similar locality, if they value their customers, I am sure that they will respond, and refund or offer one free service. Lets see......

Rajbarir Khawa is just located near Santoshpur lake, just take a left from Ajoynagar Crossing. Wanted to have Bengali food and was optimistic about Rajbarir Khawa despite the poor rating in Zomato. The ambiance is fine, nothing much to write about. Had ordered Bhetki Paturi, Mutton Kossa, and 2-3 other fish items. The service was good and the food was served in 15-20 mins.The food was great. Will go back again to try out their Mangsher Polao.

It's a 4.0 from me!

(sole reason i hired a cook, since i dont get much time now a days)  But i gave extra points (+1) for the punctuality. Food arrived with 25-30 mins ( this place is around 10-12 mins walking from my place ). Fish dishes, from what i have heard are good, but haven't verified yet, not so much interested anymore after the Mutton kosha experience or shall i say rugir jhol

My friend and I came here for dinner and we're impressed. There is no parking per say you could park in nearby parking lots and walk over but they have a very efficient free valet parking service.

Now to the meal ..outstanding in every sense of the word. Hands down best Bengali food I have had in a long time, the service outstanding as well. 

The one and only negative I could give this place is that it was not very private but noticed the other areas of the restaurant were better.Highly recommend you try this place.

Truly speaking about the quality of food they serve in a thalli is just very general to call it "Worst". The cook for this restaurant doesn't have enough knowledge about how to cook the mouth-watering Bengali Dishes. He lacks efficiency in cooking the food which an authentic bengali people have. The fry's like ( begun bhaja , beguni and topse fry) was not fried properly. Most of the things which was served to me in the thalli was about 3 - 4 days previously cooked stale food. The quality of the food was so bad that I had to end up wasting my money, time and appetite for this shitty restaurant. They serve you stale food and the previously leftover food form the yesterday. Now coming to the main course the fish items like (bhetki paturi, chingri malaikari) the both the things lacked salt and spicing elements in them. When ask for that they told us that we cook for children's as well. But I am not a children anyways. Now coming to the mutton kosha the mutton were without any meat to eat up most of it was fully bones and nothing else. The mutton was not cooked properly as well. The pieces were hard to chew. Now coming to the desert section they gave us chatni that was frozen till infinity. The chatni gave up a bad smell when tested. Also we were promised to be given a Rajbhog for the desert but ultimately after many reminder for that we receive a plate filled with misti doi. Only the good thing about the restaurant is ambiance. They charged me Rs. 435/-(before taxes) for a huge shitty thalli which they call them "Rajbarir special thalli". These guys are crooks they tell and show you something. And you end up getting something. Frankly speaking about the place. If you are a " Bangal " you shall end up wasting and throwing up about 75% of the dishes which they offer. Like I did today. And the rest people may enjoy that. But this restaurant is a real money sucker with a 3rd graded quality of food. Just an advice to the restaurant owners as a friend " People are ready to pay you the amount which you charge for your food. If the quality of food is adequate to the price. But, you guys are doing it in a wrong way for charging the money for substandard food. Even the roadside bengali hotels serves a better quality of food then you guys. The dishes in your menu are 90% from East Bengal. So if you keep a bangal chef he shall be good at doing it rather then a ghoti chef." Cheap Restaurant, cheap quality food ! You guys don't even deserve a single star also but your service manager is good and for his apology I am up to give you a single 1 rating. My verdict for the restaurant goers are they can't make you feed good quality food. So it's your responsibility to eat stale food with a premium price they charge. A lot of improvement is required. I shall never ever visit here again.

Perfect Bengali cuisine. The chingri Mach er malaikari is their specialty! The ambience is nice. Raaajbarir koshai mangsho would surely tease your taste buds. A must visit.

My friend and I came here for dinner and we're impressed. There is no parking per say you could park in nearby parking lots and walk over but they have a very efficient free valet parking service.

Now to the meal ..outstanding in every sense of the word. Hands down best Bengali food I have had in a long time, the service outstanding as well. 

The one and only negative I could give this place is that it was not very private but noticed the other areas of the restaurant were better.Highly recommend you try this place.

Truly speaking about the quality of food they serve in a thalli is just very general to call it "Worst". The cook for this restaurant doesn't have enough knowledge about how to cook the mouth-watering Bengali Dishes. He lacks efficiency in cooking the food which an authentic bengali people have. The fry's like ( begun bhaja , beguni and topse fry) was not fried properly. Most of the things which was served to me in the thalli was about 3 - 4 days previously cooked stale food. The quality of the food was so bad that I had to end up wasting my money, time and appetite for this shitty restaurant. They serve you stale food and the previously leftover food form the yesterday. Now coming to the main course the fish items like (bhetki paturi, chingri malaikari) the both the things lacked salt and spicing elements in them. When ask for that they told us that we cook for children's as well. But I am not a children anyways. Now coming to the mutton kosha the mutton were without any meat to eat up most of it was fully bones and nothing else. The mutton was not cooked properly as well. The pieces were hard to chew. Now coming to the desert section they gave us chatni that was frozen till infinity. The chatni gave up a bad smell when tested. Also we were promised to be given a Rajbhog for the desert but ultimately after many reminder for that we receive a plate filled with misti doi. Only the good thing about the restaurant is ambiance. They charged me Rs. 435/-(before taxes) for a huge shitty thalli which they call them "Rajbarir special thalli". These guys are crooks they tell and show you something. And you end up getting something. Frankly speaking about the place. If you are a " Bangal " you shall end up wasting and throwing up about 75% of the dishes which they offer. Like I did today. And the rest people may enjoy that. But this restaurant is a real money sucker with a 3rd graded quality of food. Just an advice to the restaurant owners as a friend " People are ready to pay you the amount which you charge for your food. If the quality of food is adequate to the price.

While driving from Santoshpur Jorabridge towards Ajoynagar, the place falls on your right beside Loong Fung restaurant.

Visited last year with my parents, the ambience is dramatic and gives you a Raajbari feeling with Raja -Maharaja kind paintings adorning the walls. Food was served in brass utensils adding fuel to the overall feel. Food was good.

Yesterday again thought of exploring their food, thus ordered Dhokar Dalna, Chanar Dalna, Doi Chicken and Potoler Dolma via Zomato. After few minutes a restautant staff called to say that they have not made Potoler Dolma so whether I would like to get anything else in that place. Since that was not what I intended to so asked them to deliver the other items leaving Potoler Dolma. (Prices got settled as it was on COD thankfully)

Food got delivered by an hour as promised by the restaurant.

Now coming to the food,
Doi Chicken - Four pieces, hoped pieces were better. Tasted different but good.

Dhokar Dalna - Lacked salt. After adding tasted fine. Average sized. Very soft.

Chanar Dalna - Lacked salt. After adding, tasted good, too much soft. But very small sized.

Overall not great though not bad either BUT could have been better with the right amount of the most important ingredient - SALT.

Some days ago  we ordered food home delivery ( Sona Moong Dal With Fish Head, Postor Vara [4 Pieces], Piyaj Posto, Raj Barir Kassa Murgi, Doi Pona) form here for the first time . First they told me it would take 1 hour to deliver but after placing order  within 10 mins they called me to deliver the food.  I was happy  to hear it but all my happiness went after receiving the food. 
Sona Moong Dal With Fish Head- Did not understand whether it was dal or spicy gravy soup
Postor Vara [4 Pieces] - The size was just like 10 rupees coin
Piyaj Posto - Very thick tasteless spicy gravy
Raj Barir Kassa Murgi - Nothing special. below expectation. Size of chicken piece was veryyyyy.... small also.
Doi pona- No fresh fish.
All the items we had to put in dustbin. I'll never ever think again. A terrible experience.

After long time back to Zomato and feeling good..Today me and my colleague thought let's give a try to good authentic Bengali food and heard the name of this restaurant for long time from my friend and we landed here.
We ordered Bhat, sona Mung dal, beguni, alubhaja, Shukta, dhoka dalna, katla curry, dhonepata chicken , chatni and papad...loved the taste of the food. Ambience is good but it gets double when you hear a soothing Rabindra Sangeet with each bite you are having. Loved the food. Service good. So a nice place to have a good food.

The other day the cook didn't turn up. So I thought I would get some Bengali food from here for me and wife. 
Firstly, though I didn't eat here, but I sat there for sometime waiting for my food. So it would probably not be unfair to comment on their ambience which I found to be very so so. Like, you want to take your wife out for a casual dining, maybe on an Ashtami morning on your way to pandas hopping, this is ok.  But a romantic night with the lady or the man, avoid it. 

Food: I ordered rice, daal postor bora, mocha chingri and mutton Duckbunglow. The first four were ok, mocha not bad. But the mutton was terrible. The used very hard mutton and applied mutton masala which doesn't go with our Bengali taste bud at all. So much so, that we had to temper it down the next day with water. 

My point is if you are a Bengali restaurant, then abstain from using mutton masala. It spoils the taste. Please use bata masala if you can. If not, use power masala. But please please no artificial stuff. 

Stuff were courteous. Service was prompt.

So after ages, managed to visit this place. Sneaked our from office with fellow colleagues for a lunch filled with Bengaliana.

The ambience of the place is very unimpressive with a pseudo attempt to give a palatial look. Without sounding too much scathing on the looks, let me get down to the real business.

The waiters were nice. We had ordered for the special thali. This was a serving of begun bhaja (fried egg plant), luchi, cholar daal and topse bhaja (bomvil fry) to begin with. The paneer was the odd man out with a terrible hardness, wonder why can't they revert to the original Bengali chchana!

Next in line were the my pulao which didn't appeal to me by either the looks or taste. The rice chosen was small grained and broken into multiple pieces. The quantity was great though. The kossa mangso was more of a gravy, tasted good, but the management needs to take care of this if they stick to the claim of kosa mangso. The bhetki pathuri (steamed barramundi in mustard sauce) was the magnum opus!

The chingrir malaikari was good but not a wow factor. My colleagues who had asked for pomfret and rui weren't disappointed either since these were really well done.

We finished our meal with fried papad, chutney & rajbhog. With our tummies full we reached our office.. You may want to visit the place though I don't think it will meet my wow list in Kolkata.

This place serves bengali food in raajbaari style. The food is nothing exceptional but definitely tastes pretty decent. They serve in kasha plates with lemon & chilly by the side.

The ambiance is ok kind, a small place with a couple of seating arrangement. 

The place doesn't have a proper wash basin and wash room, this is a high disappointment. They really need to work on this.

This is the worst place I have ever visited. The most worst restaurant. When ordered they first will agree to it but later on they will come and asks us to take an alternative since that particular dish we ordered is not available. Even after we agreed to it. When they served the food. The quality of the food is unimaginably worst. It's the most worst food quality i have ever had. It's waste of money and time. To mention the most again FOOD IS OF WORST QUALITY. On returning home we all vomited , do not know what was there in the food. Please everyone if situation arise that even if this is the last restaurant standing on earth please do not eat from here.

I have opted for the Bong food from Raajbarir Khawa several times before and have tried several items offered by them and every time the only problem I have faced is the untimely delivery of food. However, it is probably the taste of food that helped me to ignore the even the untimely delivery! 
Their Vegetarian dishes are the family favorite, especially Chanar Dalna, Amsotto Khejur Chatney, Kachuri- aloor Dum combo and apart from that we have tried their Basanti Pulao, Potoler Dolma, Ilish Mach diye Kochur Lati and Bhetki paturi before. 
The portion size is always good and so is the authentic flavor of Bengali food and on the good part, we have received our order on time today.

If you are not a Bengali or you have not tried Bengali cuisine then please don't even try here. The décor is lame, the food is not up to any standard. I had there pulao, paturi and chingrir malaikari. First of all the chingri was not cleaned properly and the food pipe was not removed, the pulao was nothing but yellow sweet rice and I felt sorry for the behekti. Overall if you want Bengali cuisine try other restaurants. Nothing but failure.

Lets keep it straight, I ordered chicken cutlet, basmati rice, chicken kosha today. 
Within 15 mins they called and said that chicken cutlet was not available and they offered me chingrir chop. I agreed for that.
Again 20 mins later they called and said they are extremely sorry and chingrir chop was also not available. 
Finally I said send me anything which worth the money I paid, so after 1:30 hours they sent macher dim er bora, kosha chicken and basmati vaat..

Chicken was just yuck....! I mean literally all the spices is present uncooked, too much color, excessive amount of red chilli...
Rice was cold.
Macher dim er bora was very average and cold....

If you see oil you will simply get setback. If you cannot cook u put excess oil and spices. Nine of the items deserve any comment. The chef deserves an explanation as to whether he knows how took Bengali dishes. I simply wonder how this shop is carrying on. God save the custimers

Food was ok. We ordered Rice, Dal, Posto, Aloo Bhaja, Chicken Dakbunglow and chatni. Served foot a little bit late and aloo posto was total failure. It was served hot but it was stored in refrigerator. So I placed the issue. Initially they were not ready to change but with arrival of owner I guess they changed it and provided us a new dish of fullkopi as a replacement.

Today I tried the "Raajbarir Special Thali" which consisted of the below items:

Luchi-Cholar Dal-Begun Bhaja-Topshe Bhaja-Shahi Pulao-Chanar Dalna-Bhetki Paturi-Chingri Malaikari-Kosha Mangsho-Chatni-Papad-Raj Bhog

The meal was huge in terms of quantity vis-a-via the price of Rd.400/- However,Luchi was more like Kochuri and should have been thinner. All other items except the Kosha Mangsho,Vishnu Paturi,Begun Ghana and Topshe Bhaja were way too sweet for the palate.Shahi Pulao had very strong fragrances which was not pleasant(in terms of Kewra I guess)

The interior of the eatery is very basic which strangely has pictures of Maharajas and Maharanis belonging to the Northern part of India and doesn't relate to the concept at all.

Staff who was serving us was decent but I got a shock of a lifetime otherwise.They do provide finger bowls after the meal but I also wanted to use the wash basin to clean my hands.While I was on the way,I was shocked to see a server(with the uniform on)lying on the floor with utmost comfort using a floor mat.Furthermore,there was a big group of other staff who were using a table located at the end of the eatery(which is operational and fully visible to customers) to play cards.As I walked up the passage and back they clearly noticed me but there was no change in either their body language or activity.It was past 5:30 p.m. by which we finished our meal and there were very few customers.However,this doesn't give them the liberty to act the way they did as it was an "Open" eatery and there were customers inside.

I believe serving big Thalis which are fairly priced(considering the quantity and variety) but overtly sweet doesn't serve any purpose because of the above points.

I have only been able to post pictures of the leftover items which we got packed.

Staff who was serving us was decent but I got a shock of a lifetime otherwise.They do provide finger bowls after the meal but I also wanted to use the wash basin to clean my hands.While I was on the way,I was shocked to see a server(with the uniform on)lying on the floor with utmost comfort using a floor mat.Furthermore,there was a big group of other staff who were using a table located at the end of the eatery(which is operational and fully visible to customers) to play cards.As I walked up the passage and back they clearly noticed me but there was no change in either their body language or activity.It was past 5:30 p.m. by which we finished our meal and there were very few customers.However,this doesn't give them the liberty to act the way they did as it was an "Open" eatery and there were customers inside.

I believe serving big Thalis which are fairly priced(considering the quantity and variety) but overtly sweet doesn't serve any purpose because of the above points.

I have only been able to post pictures of the leftover items which we got packed.

This restaurant is not just any other bengali cuisine restaurant. They do maintain the raajbari effect by providing us pital er plates and glasses. We were even suggested by the staffs while selecting. The food was awesome and i guess best in it quality and quantity too. Nice ambience also. Overall being an bengali we loved dinning there and will be paying another visit there very soon.

WORST CUSTOMER SEVICED, tiny amount of food served for RS. 500.

Has to be my worst experience of ordering Bengali food.

Had ordered Alu Chingri Posto,Kochupata chingri,Potoler dorma and Bhetki Paturi and have to say the chef was consistent..All the items were equally bad..

The items were too oily,there was no chingri in the items,no smell of mustard and the bhetki might have been from last week(was very hard).

All in all,terribly disappointing and would suggest to skip this.There are a lot of places where you get decent food.

Would say the best thing about Rajbarir Khawa is the pital thhala and the glass, gigantic thhali. The serving person was quite helpful when we asked for the food which would go with pulao with mutton balls. He suggested us Chittagong chicken, and yes we loved the food. 
Located near to the French Loaf in Santoshpur.

We went to this place as part of a get-together. Being in close proximity to our dwelling, Raajbari was a convenient option. We had high expectations since we intimated the management regarding the event days ago. However to our dismay it turned out to be a futile affair. Some of the food in the menu were not available and whatever was available was served cold. Moreover it took a lot of time for the food to be served on our table. I found the posto borar jhhal quite delectable. Otherwise the rest of the items were pretty ordinarily prepared. Hope the feedback is taken in a positive light and the issues are resolved.

You are in Kolkata and looking for a place where you can have delicious, economic food, you can buzz in here. The food is too tasty and it is also a prime place where you can visit every now and then without thinking about the price. The overall price of each item on the menu is reasonable. The most important thing that holds this restaurant's theme is the aura of pure Bengali Culture. This place will be a place of worship for the Bengalis in particular.

We opted for Home delivery through the Zomato Order app.  So cannot say anything about the ambience or serving efficiency of the waiters.

We ordered Raajbarir Polao [with Mutton Balls] ,Paratha,Dam Polao,Postor Vara,

Tangra Jhal
,Borishaler Ilish Bhapa
,Ilish Doi
,Chanar Dalna,Dhokar Dalna
 and 
Ammsatta Alubakhra Chatni. 

Paratha was quite good.So were the Ilish preparations.They were cooked to perfection.

Postor Bora was okayish. Dhoka was tasty,so was the Raajbari Special Pulao. 

Prices are somewhat decent. But delivery was done quite late. May be they did not instruct the delivery boy properly about the route. But as far as the food is concerned,I have no complaints. They have the ability to take on Koshe Kasha in future (Koshe Kasha has increased its price way too much over the last few months.They need to keep a check on the prices and not increase it too much,if they want to grow),,if they continue to serve food at decent prices

Though there is no dearth of grandeur in their presentation or the items on the thalis ashtami lunch at rajbarir khawa is satisfying to the eyes only. Maybe because it was during the puja rush hours,  the tastes of the food served was very ordinary.  
And the payesh served for dessert was stale too. The items on the maharaja meal had mutton kosha,  bhetki mach,  aloo bhaji,  monger daal, polao, bandha kopi with macher maatha, ending with payesh and rosogolla,  the maharani thali,  had luchi,  cholar daal,  rice, chicken dukbunglow,  chingri maach,  Katla macher peti, kofta,  ending with payesh and golapjamun... to end the rajoshik meal, there was mishti paan. 
The items were varied,  the presentation was attractive, yet the taste and flavour was very ordinary. Hoping for a better experience if I go there again.

This restaurant is not at all up to the mark. Food quality is awfully mediocre and price is too high. With this price, you can get far better Bengali food in other restaurants. I had ordered Kachu pata chingri which costs around 140+14%vat = 160 bucks but astonished to see that only 2 microscopic kutcho chingris in each plate costing 160 bucks. Total rip-off. Rajbari kasha mangsho was equally mediocre. This is neither bengali nor mughlai. I tried for the first time here and realized that I made a mistake. Recommend all to avoid this place

I have ordered one Rajbarir special Thali and one lunch non veg Thali for deliver at home. Also paid online for this order. 
First of all, the chingri malaikari was only shell and no fish in it. 
Second, the online payment didn't include the packaging charge, which it should. I paid 664.10 rupees via online, but the delivery boy got a different bill, including the packaging charge of 60 rupees plus vat of 14.5% on that. 
So, if you are planning to order online to get it delivered to some other place (maybe your relative), please inform them that they might have to pay for the packaging and vat on packaging. Including the bill with packaging charge.

Visited this place unplanned as I was in the vicinity.

Well defined exteriors.

Shabby interiors with a lot of mosquitoes.

Before I dwell farther I want to state that almost 50 % of what we asked for from the menu was unavailable.In a Bengali restaurant if one has to settle for the staple chicken and mutton it does not speak too highly about the availability factor.

We asked for :

Steamed Rice

Moong dal

Mocha Ghanta ( mocha is a vegetarian delicacy)

Chicken dakbungalow 

Mutton Kasha

Chhanar dalna ( Chhana is a variant of paneer and dalna is a light gravy )

Chutney

Papad

Rasagolla

The food was good but nothing exceptional.The mocha was very good,the chicken quite good and the rest just about making the grade.

They did not give finger bowls giving some lame excuse and after a Bengali dinner its sacrilege.

Good for one visit.

Went for a family dinner on a weekday night with my mom and wife to this restaurant specializing in Bengali cuisine. Our order consisted of two special thalis, a plate of plain basmati rice and a fish preparation. The quality was standard and the quantity was more than sufficient for three of us. The price of Rs.1200 approx was justified and the promptness of service was good, though it helped that there were guests at only 1 other table when we visited. It's a good option if you are looking for a pocket friendly Bengali cuisine experience.

I like to visit this place because of the ambiance and of course for the authentic bengali food that they serve. Since I do not stay at Kolkata, I make it a point to visit this place every time when I visit the city.

I like the attire of the waiters (punjabi-pyjama) which immediately gives you a grand bengali feeling. When it comes to food, I make it sure that I have Bhhat, Shona Moong dal with chingri, jhoori alu bhaja, doi maach and dhakai chicken with bata masala. 

Even if I prefer to throw a treat to my friends and family members, I prefer this place.
Every time, we come out with a smile and a satisfied tummy.

It is a descent enough Bengali food restaurant situated in Santoshpur area. It has wide range of menu options including all kinds of fish. We ordered several items which included macher matha diye dal, kochu pata chingri (good but not like Kasturi), posto borar jhal, chital macher muitha, galda chingri malai curry, boal mach curry and sutkir jhal. All items were good enough. Expected more from Sutkir jhal though. Had lot of oil in the item. All in all a good first time experience.

I was interested to try this outlet as soon as it opened. I saw the staff flaunting majestic uniforms and was highly impressed. Then one day I had the chance. 
It is true that I visited it a long time after it was first inaugurated, but still it was no reason to make its decoration shabby. Anyway, I was there to take some takeaways, so I took the fingered menu card and sat down to study it. After having made up my mind, I signalled a staff, as no one came to take the order. The very first thing the young boy told me that I can place any dish because everything is available. I was impressed by his confidence. I ordered mocha Chingri and kochur shak. Both were fabulous. My mother was highly impressed. 
The only snag is the staff. They are not rude, but need training. 
Later on I have often taken food from them and every time their food was delicious.

Another of those establishments which have zero commitment to customers.

I placed an order last evening, for delivery today at lunch. I had a hard requirement for the food to reach me before 1pm, so I ordered early. They agreed to deliver at that time.

This morning, a little before noon, I called up again, reminding them of the order and the need to deliver in time. I was told a curt "ok",

Five minutes to 1, they call me up and tell me that the food will be a bit late - it will reach me by 1:15 or 1:20. They said late delivery by their suppliers is the reason. Whoa! You did not know of this till now?

It is now quarter to two, and no sign of the food.

Loved the chicken Kasa here, the ambiance was nice and all Bengali, the variety of food offered here was pretty large. 
Bread and rice was more or less average, though the chicken was great, i regret not ordering a fish dish.

This resturant saved me of a lot of pain. I had some.guests staying in a guest house and to.find proper food at that area was not easy. I ordered normal.veg meal from this place and boy I was really.impressed with their price vs quality and quantity. Everything was packed in separate container. Delivery was fast and as per promise with warm authentic bengali food. And what I loved more is they have almost all the items always available from the menu except.seasonal.dishes. very much recommended

Awesome ambience..that is gonna stun you for the first ...sholo ana bangali ana thats what they belive , the rates are too reasonable and I literally loved the whole thing.people away from bengali culture must come over here to know the bonedi ana sholo ana bangali ana.. which means 100% authentic bengali lyf style and food.

Decent place with a great ambience. The food is good but not great. If you want Bengali food, Bhojohori Manna is leagues ahead of this restaurant. The staff is good. Some of the dishes have to be ordered a day or two beforehand so make sure you don't want anything too rich or feisty before you visit. They take a little time to serve you but it's worth waiting. It's quite impressive when you compare it to local bengali restaurants.

Simply Bad!!! Very bad. Please don't waste your money going here. I ordered simple food - Rajbarir Pulao and Rajbarir Kosha Mangsho , kosha had only 4 pieces. Which needed no mention of having only BONES!!! also not good taste. Pulao was the biggest FLOP here, 2 dumplings (U can say)  I dint know why they gave those, no connection whatsoever with the dish, also the quantity of rice at the price (Rs. 130) will not serve a single person. VERY VERY bad. 
Never thought my first review on Zomato would be a bad review. 
I recommend NOTHING!!

Visited this place on a Thursday evening for dinner with family. The place is really good and obviously have the Kingly feel from inside. The waiters are dressed in Kurta payjama, like a typical Bengali Jamai. Well this was about the feel and ambience. The food and the menu is really custom made for the typical bengali  food seeker, and not only the menu but the food as well gives you the experience of belonging to Bengal. But they take a lot of time to actually serve you the food after you have ordered for it. So by the time the food reaches your table, there could be a possibility that you have lost your appetite.

Authentic Bengali cuisine.. first time we had ordered basmati rice (which was served steamy hot and smelled wonderful), shona mooger daal, alu bhaja, rui kalia, chicken dakbanglo and chutney. The chicken dish was really good. Service was good too. Ambience was ok (though the utensils were nice!)Next time we had paratha and chicken kasha, which complimented each other well. Overall, it is one of the few Bengali restaurants serving really good food.

I went to this place on Bhaifota with my family. From the outside, it may not seem much. But once inside, feels like you are in another era altogether. Warm golden lighting befitting that of a royal palace and palatial art decoration makes the interior beautiful.
We had the Rajbari Special Thali, and the Bhai Phota Special Thali. The prices were quite high, at 400 and 550 respectively, with taxes extra. However, the quantity was good, the taste was awesome and it was total 'paisa wasool'. The Rajbari Thali was as usual. The Bhaifota Special Thali consisted of basmati rice, shonamug dal, kochur loti with ilish matha, ilish bhapa, masala rui fry, kossa mangsho, and desserts. All the items were really really delicious and we were so full after the meal that we could hardly move.
The brass plates and glasses and serving bowls add to the experience. Overall, this is a place I would definitely like to return to.

If you are really looking for authentic Bengali food, look no further than Rajbarir Khawa at Santoshpur, close to Ajoy Nagar Crossing on Bypass.

This is a perfect place for a lunch or dinner out with your family.

Not only the value for money is excellent but the ambiance also takes you back to good old days.

We keep coming back every time there is an occasion:)

Raajbaarir Khawa is one of the best option for bengali cuisine if u are on the other side of EM Bypass/ Ajaynagar. I remember going to this place a number of times specially  whenever I had guests visiting us from outside Kolkata. 
My 7yrs daughter loves the BASANTI POLAO AND MUTTON DAKBANGLA, and says its the best pulao she ever had.
However, my recent visit to this place made me realize and accept that KOLKATA has indeed underwent a paradigm shift in its food culture in the last few years …… with the culture of getting back the dishes which our Ma/Mashi ra used to make when we were kids. Raajbaari has it all.  Quality of food, service and ambience goes hand in hand. Wld love to go back again .
All the best and a must visit.

Looking for authentic Bengali cuisine,try this place.The ambience was reallly good.The decor deserves special mention as it resembles the interiors of an "old rajbari".Even the silver utensils used remind you of the age old eras of nawbs and zamindars.

Coming to food,the ilish biriyani served here during the monsoon season is a must try.The fusion of biriyani with ilish is fantastic.Other mouth-watering delicacies like rajbarir polao,sona moong dal with prawn,posto bora,foolkafi kohinoor,echor chingri and rajbarir kossa murgi are a must try if you are a Bengali.
The different fish,chicken and mutton preparations available here testify the presence of some dexterous cooks who are bound to remind you of your own bengali home-made food that were once made by your grandmothers.

A BUNCH OF LIARS AND THIEVES. We had very bad experience with our home delivery order for 2 Rajbari special thalis. First they delayed by 1 hour maintaining throughout that deliveryman was on the way (I leave at exactly 12 mins walking distance). The portions delivered seemed less. When I pressed them they owned up that THEY HAD SENT ONLY 1 THALI EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD QUIETLY BILLED ME FOR 2 THALIS. I paid for the 1 thali and was happy that the encounter was over. The quality of food varied from dish to dish. Cholar dal was low on salt while the salt in topshe fry was high. The paturi and malaikari were passable. Kosha mangsho was oily. The begun fry was very thin (looked like a dead lizard). The luchis were shriveled. Only thing that was good was the pulao.

Just returned from an ordeal called dinner at this place. We had ordered the four hundred per person ten course meal. 
First up, the water (yes, the water) smelt weird, and some glasses had clearly not been cleaned. The begun bhaja was burnt and under-salted, and the topse machh fry smelt like Koley Market after a squall. The polao was an orange coloured (food grade? We dared not ask) oil dripping tasteless travesty, and the chhanar dalna was horrible.
The prawn and mutton were good. That sort of pacified our group, or we might have got up and hit somebody.
Clearly a place that seeks to overwhelm with quantity, rather than tantalise with taste. The cheap price of meals should keep this joint afloat, but true connoisseurs of Bengali cuisine would not be pleased.
To sum up, I'm NOT going back there.

I went to this place today with family to enjoy the Sunday lunch. We called up around at 1:45 pm and they informed us to go to their place by 2:15 pm. However we got our seat at 3 PM. The expectation was high and hence the disappointment was significant considering the food quality and ambience. It is not a clean place and you would find flies all over the place. We even found hair in the sweet card. Never try Bhetki Pathuri as it is not Bhetki and the preparation was pathetic and smelling bad. They added some water in Cholar Dal as they seemed to had some issues with availability. The mutton was okay. The service is average and they were trying to to do whatever they can after we have shown our displeasure. However they could hardly compensate the taste with their last minute efforts. They really need to focus on improving hygiene.

Food was something i really appreciate .... Dishes like that of Mutton and Fish was really worth the money. Rajbarir polao is also something worth a try... Very well made bengali dishes ..

The one and only plus point is the food is good. Behavior of the waiters is useful. Info given over the phone is not trustworthy. Thali is only available on weekdays but not mentioned anywhere. Only thali available everyday is worth Rs 400. Not a pleasant experience they could have done way better by a bit cordial and well mannered waiters and a bit informative menu. But is very clean and hygienic.

I am prompted to write this review after my second visit to the place. The first one had a mixed feeling and since it has just opened a couple of weeks before, I igonred and overlooked certain flaws. However, the second visit was terrible. The name is probably justified only partially by the decor and the ambience the place offers. It is certainly not the best of places for bengali food. Though the menu card offers a lot, but one realizes that a whole lot of items printed are not available in practice. This realization in fact comes in an iterative fashion, with waiters taking their turn to inform that the one being ordered is not available, and each such step consumes 5-10 minutes. Once you finalize your menu, 25 vital minutes are lost. Even items from the Raajbarir Special Thali were missing, and has to be substituted. The taste is extremely ordinary. Some items, like the Mutton Duckbunglow is too oily. In essence, considering the taste of the food served and the service, the place is certainly not worth visiting.

Trying to eat from Rajbarir Khawa is one of my worst eating experience in Kolkata. We ordered some dishes for our lunch. We live within 1 kilometres of their Santoshpur joint. We waited for 75 minutes for the food - made 4 phone calls only to receive the reply that the food will reach in 10 minutes. One thing is for sure that I'm never going to try it. My suggestion is for those who are reading this - please try and avoid this restaurant.

The place is nicely decorated and the food is good. However, I tried the Raajbarir Polao and the Raajbarir Chicken,which i didnt like at all and would not recommend to anyone.

Other than that, my wife tried with Topsay Maacher Bhaja, Alloo Bhaja, Sona Moong Daal and White Rice which she said was quite Ok.

The price is not so high.
Over all I would give the restaurant around 3.5 as I am the first time visitor. Need to visit them some other time like over the weekend or on some occassion, to see if there is anything special on the menu.

I had a dinner at Raajbarir Khawa yes'day (15th Aug'13) and I am not all satisfied with the dishes there. I took a Illish Biriyani which was a kind of disaster. It was a combination of thinly chopped piece of deep-fried hilsha atop a bowl of rice, somewhat a kind of Pulao with no real ingredients. Simply it was no way near an inch of Biriyani. Chitol Maccher Muitha was so so but another one, Chanar dalna was badly cooked. Deserts were not up to the mark at all. Will have never been to Raajbarir Khawa again  :(

went there with a discount coupon of 25% of billed amount....phoned them and they gave the direction rightly...so in a hot summer day we reached RAJBARI with a great expectation from the name..
ambiance is very very nice....can make u feel like in a real rajbari...
service needs to improve much...at 1st they gave full attention to us...but gradually that diminishes in such a manner that we had to call them to fill up the glass of water..
i dont know why any bengali restaurant in kolkata (im not telling about oh calcutta) doesnt provide everything from their menu card...be it bhajahari manna or sholo ana bangali..we faced the same situation....they always have limited items which are even not known by the waiters..every time we ordered...they were returning to us to say about its unavailability..
quality of the food was good but not the best though the presentation of the food was good..they were providing brass utensils..which is exceptional...

I would have rated more had they been able to deliver all the items on the menu at all times. But the food quality is usually very good, and so is the taste. However, you have to be satisfied with whatever is available on a particular day. If you want something specific (even out of the menu), you have to order beforehand.

I went there for Dinner on a Sunday night with my family for dinner. There is no parking lot and you have to simply park your car at the side of the road.
On entering the restaurant, the ambiance will make you feel you are really in a palace. The interior decor with big oil paintings of kings and queens enhances the experience. Large spacious dining area, wonderfully decorated throughout, the atmosphere feels like you have entered a royal palace. At the background, light music is played. We were the first customer that night walking in at around 8pm. Food is served in brass utensils perfectly blends with the tablecloths, which are of golden color as well. 
Now coming to food. I would not say the food is exceptional. First of all, be prepared that you would not get everything that is there on the menu card. We wanted to eat the speciality of the restaurant - Rajbarir Polao, but it was not available. Depending on the availability, we ordered the following:

1) Dum Polao - Rs 90
2) Raj Barir Kasha Murgi - Rs 160
3) Hilsha Bhapa - Rs 200
4) Echor Dalna - Rs 60
5) Bhetki Cutlet - Rs 75
6) Doi - Rs 40

The taste of the food was good but the price is definitely at the higher side. Also, the service of the staff is something which definitely needs improvement. No one came down to serve us and we had to take all the food by ourselves. Also, none of the waiters came back and asked us whether we needed something else. We had to call them and place additional order.

Overall, the restaurant has great ambiance but service and food definitely needs improvement. There may be better places to eat at this price in Kolkata.

Not really the best place to have Bengali food..perhaps I feel so because I visited during Pujas..
Service..okayish..can be far better.
Food..tastes like home food..
Value for money...expensive compared to what it has got to offer.
Location is a bit interior, however can be a good place for ordering home delivery food occasionally.

This review consists of 2 parts..
First- This is located on the main road of santoshpur, just beside the united bank, finding this wont be a problem. When we entered the restaurant we were astonished by the ambiance. Large spacious dining area, wonderfully decorated throughout, the atmosphere feels like you have entered a royal palace, sweet music was playing also.. 
Now comes the second part which is the main thing of a restaurant-the food.. this is not as grandeur as the ambiance.. waiters were not well informed, we ordered Rajbarir Pulao, Chicken Kosha, Vetki Paturi, Chanar Dalna and Chutni.. after 5 mins the waiter came back and said Vetki Paturi is not available so we opted for Ilish Paturi. Again after 10 mins waiter returned to tell that Rajbarir Pulao was not available. We had to order Sweet Dum Pulao.. waiters had no idea about what is available and what not!! If they cant serve vetki in this vetki season then when will they be able to serve, its not that we went at very late night and all the items were finished! We went there at 7.30 pm. Pulao was nothing special, Chanar Dalna was not as good as I have tasted at bhojohori or 6 ballygunj place, Chicken Kassa was tasteless and too oily.. I'm giving this 3 stars only because of its grand ambiance. Food wise its nothing special, there are many places serving better food than this one.
