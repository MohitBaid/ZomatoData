This cafe is located at a place easily accessible to everyone.Located just opposite to city style,gariahat,it houses the essence and feel of the yesteryears rabindrasangeet singer Late.Debabrata Biswas.We ordered the mud special cake,blue lagoon,hot chocolate,coffee with icecream and chicken pasta.The mud chocolate cake will melt your senses n stands out over everything.Rest of the food was okk,nothing extraordinary.The chicken pasta was the worst dish to be taken.Overall,bong music lovers n passtime food lovers can certainly have a visit here.My ratings are:-
Decor-4/5(extra points for rabindra sangeet playing in background)
Food-3/5
Service-4/5(was quite swift with cooperative staffs)
Pocket pinch-4/5 . Calcutta people come n dive into the mud of food.

It is a very popular cafe situated near triangular Park opposite to city style mall. 
MUD is a decent cafe with bengali ambiance & good food.  The ambiance here oozes bangaliana with their choice of music &  interior decor. 
The service is good & yes it takes time to make the food so at that time u can enjoy the place with your friends or family.  Food is good.  Value for money. The price is pocket friendly. Overall it's a must visit place.

A small cafe which serves really good food at a reasonable price. The quantity served by them is enough. The staffs there were really good and well behaved. We didn't order much out there but the food which we ate was really good and tasty.
Average Cost for two will be near about ‚Çπ600+GST. 
Food Ordered- Fresh Lime Soda
                            Kitkat Shake 
                            Chocolate mud cake

Been there twice.. and wanna go again.
Its a cool and cozy cafe, built on the premises of the noted musician Late Debabrata Biswas, it gives the vibes of your personal drawing room space. 
Tried and tasted and looking-forward-to-having-it again on the menu include- mutton ghughni..dahi chicken with roomali roti, crispy fish fingers and grilled sandwiches. The yummilicious mud cake that melts in your mouth is THE MUST item on their menu. 
They serve in bamboo cutleries that add to their uniqueness..

I had heard great things about this caf√©, not only because of its quick bites but also on account of its illustrious lineage‚Äìit has been set up in a part of the house belonging to legendary Rabindrasangeet singer Late Debabrata Biswas (‚ÄòGeorge‚Äôda to many Bengalis). The passage leading to the entrance and the walls along the stairs to the higher floors are lined with photographs from the cultural world. The ground floor was full, so we were ushered into the first floor. However, it was chilly upstairs‚Ä¶perhaps the air-conditioning was set too low, though it was end of December. The room-freshener also did not help matters; it was very strong. We ordered Irish Coffee to beat the cold‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt find it exceptional; the cream on the top was not thick. But the real disappointment proved to be the ‚Äòmangsher ghugni‚Äô [chick-pea masala with mutton keema]‚Äìa takeaway item.¬†

After returning home, I was shocked to discover the measly portion (see the snap below)‚Äìmoreover, there was barely any meat to speak of. As such, the only positive thing to emerge from this visit was the costume jewellery & bric-a-brac on display for sale in an alcove on the first floor‚Ä¶certainly not the food.

Nice little bengali cafe in hindustan park. Delicious food, light on the pocket. I have tried chicken and cheese omlet (one of the best i have ever tried), chicken pasta in white sauce, fried fish with kasundi and all of them created enough stimulation of the taste buds to make me come back 3 times in 2 weeks !!

Mud the well kNown name among cafe lovers..A sweet little cafe just around the gariahat area.it was small but not suffocating at all.the interior was so bong.. There were pictures of famous bengali personalities, CDs of famous Bengali musicians.a good old one was playing in the background.all set the mood for us to spend 2 hours protecting ourselves from the 33 degrees of scorching heat outside.but you kno what we didn't feel a thing of tht when we were there.it was that soothing.I went there with one of college friends who suggested the place actually and My boyfriend my partner in foodüòç we ordered green tea with honey, cold coffee shake , chicken sandwiches and ice lemon tea..Lemon tea was good,sandwiches were crispy .Green tea was tasty.cold coffee was not blunt..So the food was good.stuffs were really well behaved and gentle.so overall a place to soothe minds and to give rest to your hurting legs after doing tons of shopping cz come-on it's beside gariahat peepsüòä.so visit soon..And do try mud pastry.reviews on this are really good.  i am gonna do that next time for
 sure.onr thing the lighting was not satisfactory may be they have given that to create a calm ambience but I think that place needs to be brighten up just a little bit.

Located near triangular park opposite to city style mall, MUD is a decent cafe with Bengali ambience and good food.

Came here with my friend Aman today morning. We had fish n chips, dahi chicken with rumali roti and blue lagoon. Food came after a long wait. Food was pretty good.

Prices are reasonable, staffs are courteous. The ambience here oozes bangaliana with their choice of music and interior decor. Its a good place for chatting with friends and we enjoyed our time here.

During winter, I love to visit cafes for gossiping over foods. It situated just beside Manyavar Triangular Park. It is a very pleasant place to gossip over a sip of Darjeeling tea. We went frequently here. Last we visited here on Sunday. We took Mutton ghugni, rumali rooti and Darjeeling tea.

MUD is like the leaky cauldron in the sense that you are more likely to miss it than not. But once inside you'll find it to be far more cheerful than the Tom's bar. For those not accustomed to Harry Potter jargon, MUD is a cofee shop located just beside the Manyavar showroom near triangular park. It is also a place where you can eat fish n chips while listening to Robindro Shongeet.

What I've had - Fish n Chips,Grilled Mud Sandwich,Cheese Corn Burst Sandwich,Walnut brownie with ice cream,Chocolate Cake and Chocolate Mousse. The fish and chips were a dissapointment. The fish fillet was small and just wasn't delicious enough. The sandwiches on the contrary were very impactful and quite beautifully made even though the size of the portions left much to be desired. But the reason I've visited MUD so many times are their desserts. The Chocolate Mousse is delicious and moist and to die for. The brownie with ice cream is also very satisfying and so is the cake.

What I felt- The interiors feel comfy and give off a very homely vibe. Waiters are friendly and though the service tends to be inconsistent, it can be forgiven given the overall experience. Price of the dishes are alright but the size of the portions can be better.

P.S:- Their way of putting the bill in small ceramic cups (if you can call them that) is a bit too self-indulgent if you ask me.Some things are best left unchanged.üòÅ. On a serious note, it really is a gem of place for a relaxing evening with decent food and soothing music. Pay a visit if you can get Hagrid to to help you find it. Cheers

MUD is located on the footpath near Hindustan park near Manyavar Mohey.
It feels like home where you can relax and talk with your friends for long with food.The ambiance is warm and cozy and there is the open kitchen where you can see them cooking.There you can find bengali art and books and music and more.There is seating upstairs too.
Where you just need to click a button or the bell to call the people.
The service is good and yes it takes time to make the food so at that time enjoy the place with your buddies or family.
The food is good.
We had salads and shakes it was great.
Value for money.
The price is pocket friendly you won't regret spending here.
There are places where you can click good selfies too while entering the cafe.
Overall its a must visit place and explore.

After many times passing by this place and lookin at photos I finally decided to visit this place , and I was definitely surprised . This cafe will definitely give u a feel and take u back in time of the old traditional Kolkata culture that is sumwhere lost today , however these guys have a superfantastic service and extremely polite crew . The food now , my favourite word also is less for this one dish that I tasted today , heavenly it was a must have for all THE YUMMYLIOUS MUTTON GHUGNI , u can have it with rumali or just like that . The quantity is however a bit less , wld have been nice if the quantity wld have been a little more ... Definitely will visit this place again for the MUTTON GHUGNI AND OFFCOURSE OTHER DISHES , oh sorry did forget to mention the fish n chips also is a must try (it actually more of a cutlet ) but who's complaining and btw they give bhetki not BASA  like many restaurants do .. the restroom also is very clean , very homely feeling .
After such a review why 4.0 is becoz they need to fix the address issues this is not in Hindustan park .. Overall this is a completely cozy great place to chill out .. not allways u need a hookah bar or lounge this is better than that .....

Visited this place today.Well its a little cafe with a beautiful interior near triangular park.The interiors have an authentic touch.
       Coming to food we ordered-
1.Dahi Chicken-Tastes really amazing but quantity could have been a bit more
2.Chocolate mud cake-tastes heavenly and you will crave for more.
3.Walnut brownie-Served beautifully with vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce
4.Kolkata special mojito-The mocktail tastes amazing.
 Overall a very beautiful cafe with amazing food and reasonable price.I gave extra one mark for the amazing taste of food items.They should work upon the service as staffs are not that prompt and quantity if food is not really satisfying.However here you will fall in love with the taste of food.

Though the decor was vintage and the ambience was lovely, the food wasn't at par with my expectations. First of all they provide a very little quantity for the price. Secondly, the quality too, is very mediocre. Ordered a chicken sandwich and was shocked at how much little stuffing they gave. The Mud Cake was pretty ordinary.
The only think I liked was the Irish Coffee. Apart from that, it's a good place to have conversations with friends, but not a good place for eating.

I had a great time over hot chocolate and cheese chicken sandwich with my friend.. That sandwich tasted good but I wish it was a bit large in size.. Overall I liked the place..

Visited the place twice. Located at an alley and housed in the house of famous Rabindra sangeet singer Debabrata Biswas aka Georgeda. This itself gives this place a special charm
The cafe is very artistically decorated with Bengali art theme and one can also buy books and cds which are on display
Ordered 
1) Darjeeling tea - It was excellet with a capital E. I drink tea from many cafes but this cafe tea is very good. And the cost is only 70 rs. The quantity is huge(4.5/5)

2)Hawaiian salad- It tasted good too. Though i think with respect to the price the quantity could have been a bit more. (3.5/5)

3)Fish and chips -  The cutlet was very good and most probably it was bhetki only. The chips accompanied with it was good too. (4/5)

4)Cofee (both filter and cappuccino) I didnt have it but my friends said they were very good. (4/5)

The service was good with smiling and polite waiters so its (5/5)

Overall a very excellent place to hangout and have feel with rabindra sangeet playing in the background. And the pocket pinch too is not so much like other cafes

It took us 10mins to locate the restaurant, and when we finally entered, we were pleasantly surprised by the cute little place. The decor is very cute.
There were just the two of us and we were not that hungry so we ordered just two dishes.
1. Dahi chicken and roti- this dish was absolutely delicious. The chicken was too less, and we would have like a bit more of it since it was so tasty.
2. Chicken Hawaiian salad- so this was a very okay dish. There was far too much bell pepper for my taste. In the end we threw away quite a large number of bell pepper. Other than that the dish wasn't all bad.

So to sum up, a very okayish experience. My review might be biased since I only tried 2dishes. Would probably go back to try out the recommended dishes like the chocolate mud cake! :)

An awesome place to hang out and very good decor but a bit costly when it comes to food and quantity of the food. When we went there, the service was also slow. Taste wise, it is good....though we have not tried much variety. I liked the idea that they gave the free soft drink once a certain amount in the bill is reached (which was very easy for 3 people going there...lol).
If you want to spend a good evening with friends and with great ambience...this is the perfect place for you.
P.S...Try to seat upstairs (it is better there)...we had to seat downstairs as the former option was full

One of the best cafe in Kolkata. First of all, the ambience is very pleasant and beautiful. After entering the cafe you will definitely feel the bengali traditions. And their food is also of top notch quality. We ordered grilled chicken sandwiches along with one irish coffee and one cappuccino. The chicken sandwich was mouth watering and the coffee was also very refreshing. Their behaviour was very good towards us. Overall it was a great experience.

This is one of the best cafes in Kolkata that I've been to. Located right beside Traingular Park, everything from the food to the ambience is great in this place, with what I like to call "Bangali decorations". After entering you go up to the first floor to enter the sitting area with around 6 tables or so and the place feels very cozy.
This has become one of my¬† go to cafes due to the fantastic quality of their food at pretty reasonable prices.
And the staffs are pretty good and competent as well.

My absolute favorite from this place is the Grilled Mud Sandwich and the Cheese Corn Burst Sandwich.
The pasta from the place is great as well and if you're craving something sweet then definitely go for the Walnut Brownie with Ice Cream. 

I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place out.

A big spacious one with 3 big sofas, with music system, with bell system, so problem of calling the waiters, the food is good. The staffs are polite and friendly. The decor is nice and bonedi.

Good ambience. Price higher given the taste of the food. Peach passion Iced tea is a must try. That is the only thing which I like here. Capuccino is okayish. There is nothing special about the chicken and cheese sandwich and Darjeeling tea. They really need to work on their food items. Courteous staff. Good Bengali music. Nice decor.

This small and cozy caf√© is located just beside Khyber Pass in Triangular Park.
The ambience is very soothing. The wooden seating, the mats on the floor, old bengali songs, clay pots will give you a very nostalgic feeling.
This is a perfect place for 'adda'.

They provide a small yet good menu. They have sandwiches, pasta, burgers, fish n chips, mini meals, mocktails,mojitos, hot beverages and desserts etc.

This was my first visit and we ordered,
Chicken Pasta in White sauce and also one in Red sauce. Both were served hot and tasted good.

Hawaiian Salad is also a good one. It was served with a piece of bread grilled with butter.

Chicken Burger was the best amongst all. The patty was crispy and tasted awesome with the mustard sauce and the tomato sauce.
From th@e Mini Meal we went for
Dahi Chicken with Rumali Roti.

The presentation of food was quite innovative. They have an open kitchen and they also sell beautiful jewellery, funky mugs, CD's and small crockery.

Pocket friendly place. I would like to visit again and try out the desserts too.
A one time visit.

Located opposite city style , right beside triangular park manyavar. Craving for chocolaty dessert took us to this place. I love this place's ambience. This place will give you the feel of a bengali residence. It has got two floors seating arrangement with rabindra sangeet playing in the background . If you want a cozy bangali adda and love rabindra sangeet, then this place is for you. And definitely try the first floor.
Now coming to the food , as we went there for dessert, we took their signature chocolate mud cake and Walnut Brownie with Ice-cream. Both were heavenly. For the mud cake- Just dived into the pool of chocolate and got drowned in it!!! The walnut brownie was too good, served hot .
Service is prompt . There are books and ethnic jewellery for sale also.
I will come back again , for the food and the adda.

Located beside Manyavar Triangular Park this cafe is full of Bengali nastalgia. Debobrata Biswas's songs are being played from the sound boxes which sets a perfect tone for the evening.We ordered grilled chicken sandwich and Darjeeling green pot(for 2).Tea was good but the sandwich was not something extraordinary. Would visit the place again to try out their others dishes.

Located opposite to citi style at triangular park this homely cafe steals our heart with perfect bengali ambience.... Decorated with mud and terracotta  pottery and songs of Debobrata Biswas playing in the background it gives the bong feeling.
Here we order for cold coffee,iced tea,cheese omelette and mud special sandwich....all tasted excellent...but especially the sandwich was lip smacking with double layers of egg and cheese served with mustard and tomato...the quantity is quiet enough for a person....And above all the price is very pocket friendly....

A fairly small cafe on the main road, just besides Manyavaar. It keeps it's unique Bengali culture alive among the modernity. 

I was catching up with a friend over some green tea and sandwich in the evening and upon entering the place I saw that it was really well decorated. We sat on the first floor and ordered our green tea which was served with a small cookie/biscuit thingy. The sandwich was pretty good to be honest. It's a fairly nice spot to catch up over some chit chat with a friend or two.

Located just behind Manyavar (Triangular Park), this cafe is definitely one of the best in the area. The cafe is well decorated with comfortable accommodation and the ambience is good as well. The cafe serves decent food at low price. Do try Mud Sandwich, Darjeeling Pot.  The Chicken cutlet is good as well, but the size of the same is small.

Overall a good and pocket friendly Cafe in the area. :)

Located just beside 'Manyavar' of triangular park. This place is basically an apartment converted into a caf√© . So the ambience is very much homely and cosy. Gives you a feeling of "baithak khana". The caf√© also sales clay potteries and terracotta jewellery as well as books. Menu comprises  Mud special club sandwiches, Mutton ghugni, Chicken Pasta in white sauce, Mud special Kolkata mojito, chocolate mousse, Dahi chicken with rumali roti.
1. Mud special Kolkata mojito- it was very refreshing 
2. Mutton ghugni- this was a surprise package. Every scoop of it was full great flavours. Although not a single flavour was dominant which was commendable.
3.Mud special club sandwiches-it consists of chicken mayonese and egg fillings served with tomato sauce and mustard sauce. Tasted good.
4.Chicken Pasta in white sauce- the only disappointment of the day. Tasted rubbish. White sauce was pathetic.
5.Dahi chicken with rumali roti- This dish actually set our mood in the right tone again. The chicken pieces was perfectly cooked in Dahi based gravy. The dish was inch perfect and goes very well with rumali roti.
6.Chocolate mousse- presented very nicely. Tasted yum . perfect way to sign off .
Conclusion-
Decor-4/5
Food-4/5
Staffs -3.5/5. Friendly although the service were very slow
Price-pocket friendly
P.s- They only charge 5% gst. A good place to have gossips and long conversations. Menu are not updated in zomato.

Kolkata is now filled with caf√©s and pubs, to an old hag like me most of the places look pretty similar after an hour or so! At least from the core, I can‚Äôt label any of these places as a ‚ÄòBangali Caf√©‚Äô, well that‚Äôs a rare species, right? I mean who on earth needs some oxymoron like a Bangali caf√©? But, right after Dashami this year when I had to meet some of my friends for some coffee, I was only looking for this oxymoron over the internet. And then I stumbled upon this place called ‚ÄòMUD‚Äô Caf√© near Triangular Park, south Kolkata. I was nearby, so this was the perfect spot for me! Now, let me tell you a bit what Bangaliana in this caf√© actually made my adda so perfect that day! It was gloomy outside and was drizzling a bit, perfect setting for some snacks, cup of tea, good friends and adda! Thankfully I had everything with me! MUD Caf√© is actually a residential property which has been converted to a caf√© with utmost care keeping intact the very essence of the Bengali home and Rabindranath. The property hasn‚Äôt been much reconstructed to make it look like a jazzy or classy caf√©. Once you are there you will definitely feel you are at someone‚Äôs residence. And yes, this was the residence of legendary Rabindra sangeet exponent, Debabrata Biswas who was lovingly called George da by many.
                                          ...

Easy location will always have my heart! Just opposite to city style and beside manyavar, mud is a homely three storied cafe with a homely ambiance, rabindra sangeet as the background score. The open kitchen and rugged floors, and cute seatings are an eye catching plus! 

Food there is comparatively over priced but yes then it's worth it. We tried their chicken cheese sandwich, cheese sandwich, vanilla ice cream with walnut brownie and an ice tea. 

Brownie was the best pick. I'm still hung over it. The hot brownie and cold ice cream simply intermingled and was a blast of flavors. It's worthy of tasting. 

Sandwiches out there are decent too, it will leave you craving for more. 

Ice tea was very average. Nothing special. 

Good work team MUD. 
Thanks.

Now coming to the food,we had chicken sandwich which was divided into 4 small pieces (not enough to fill a hungry tummy),cold coffee which tasted good, chocolate mousse was tasty and brownie with ice cream tasted ordinary.

This cafe is located in lake view stop in the main road but catching very little attention!
This used to be the house of famous singer Debabrata Biswas & there is nothing much to say about this place except this. People naturally want to come to this place & they play nothing but his Rabindrasangeet. The crowd is good & so is the ambience.
The food is pretty ok considering the price.

Have been there today evening..
It is just opposite to tha city style @ traingular park.
MUD  is a small cafe..though the place is little bit cozy but the soothing ambiance made me refreshed totally..
One can really feel comfortable with the nic decor..the  sitting arrangement...
One thing i must say that they provide a special "selfie zone"..which would be loved by everyone..am sure.
Now come to the food.
We ordered.
1. GRILED MUD SPCL SANDWICH
2.CHICKEN MEXICAN BURGER
3.DAHI CHICKEN WITH RUMALI ROTI
4.TUTIFRUTI
5.KITKAT SHAKE
The mud sandwich was really yummy..served in 4 pcs in one plate with chips.each loaded up with chicken stuffing; cheese; egg..good in taste.
Mexican burger was also too good for me..the spcial mexican sauce with they used, enhanced the taste of the dish..i love burger..so it was looooveed by me indeedüòáüòá
Dahi chicken was nice..i usually like such kind of dishes so.it was nice.
Kitkat shake was not atall up to the mark ..as per my view..i expected much much better..but alas..
But tutifruti was yummy .it indeed is a nice desrt.it was served with vanilla ice cream.
Now in few words..MUD is really a nice place for hangout in a cafe..
I would like to visit the place again and want to try there rest items.bcz at the end of the day..we are foodie afterall.üòéüòé

Visited on Soshti this year .The little corner , in hindusthan park, just beside "khybar pass" , grabbed my attention, named MUD . Entered through a thin lane but after that I found the place is so peaceful. The Ambience ,the courtesy n hospitality, and obviously the food. We ordered cold coffee and hot chocolate . Both tasted so good. No way to complain about them. 
Whatever this place found me peace after a sweaty crowd of Kolkata durga puja. Thank you for making my soshti day so special

Was in search of a nice cosy eatery and so thought of trying out MUD!as we entered this outlet beside manyavar at Hindustan Park, we noticed it to be decorated with tiny bulbs which regenerated in us the feeling of festivity.mud had a decent ambience with ceramic ware displayed for sale.we ordered hot chocolate,darjeeling tea and a chicken and mayo grilled sandwich to munch.it wasn't anything outstanding.we also had walnut brownie with icecream.the employees were courteous and had heated the brownie as requested by us.the overall experience was average.

A cosy corner off the busy Rashbehari Avenue.
A few steps away from Gariahat Triangular Park, this is the right place to meet friends for a lazy evening chitchat. I appreciate the Grilled Mud Sandwich and pot of Darjeeling tea, adequately sufficient for your friend and you.
However, the pasta here is a total failure and coffee is not at all a serious recommendation.
You might be pleased to glance across the wide range of ceramic ware available here.
If all other consolation fails, the soul-stirring voice of Debabrata Biswas, playing at the background, will be at your rescue.

Located near triangular park but never could spot until a friend took us to this caf√©. The caf√© comprises of several floors and actually is the living rooms of a residential place. Coming to the food section.
We had 
Fish n chips 4/5 
Greek chicken salad 3.5/5 
Hawaiian chicken salad 3/5
Kitkat chocolate shake 3.5/5
Dahi chicken with polao 4/5
Chicken burger 3.5/5

The salads were a little watery. Greek salad being better than the hawaiian one. It had lots of veggies though the chicken : vegetables ratio was contrasting. Kitkat chocolate shake was okayish and lesser sweet. I've tasted more delicious ones before and after. 

Dahi chicken with rice would get a perfect 5/5 hadn't it been very less in quantity. Loved the dahi chicken and it's smooth white gravy. 

Big thumbs up for the bengali theme,the rusty feel and low price.

Thumbs down for the quantity of some of the items.

This cafe is located in hindustan park beside Manyavar and opposite to City style. While entering you will find a walkway filled with lights covering 2 floors. I have been hearing a lot about this place and atlast got to visit this place due to heavy rain. We ordered for one latte and a grilled chicken sandwich because we have already planned our dinner somewhere else. Well the latte was tasteless and the portion of chicken in the sandwich was very minimum. I don't know it's about puja rush or something else but food quality can be improved. The services was very good (courteous) and the decor were marvellous. Books were kept in the shelves, chairs were made of cane and rabindra sangeet was playing in the background. Superb place for a round of coffee and an adda.

If your shoebited feet need rest in the middle of pandle hopping, then take a short break and dig into the mud... An absolute pleasant and quite ambiance in the heart of the city. Soulful Tagore's song all over it. I as a Kolkatan  highly recommend this cafe for a perfect date, perfect adda sessions, and perfect feet rest... 

Go for chicken cheese omelet, mud sandwich, walnut brownie, cappuccino, fish fingers etc... 

But Fish and chips was a little disappointing..

Mud Is a good cozy cafe located in Hindusthan Park, just opposite to the shopping mall named city style.  As you enter the cafe you get bowled over by the ambience. This place is quite spacy unlike the narrow entrance and we were given a seat on the 1st floor.  The showpiece, the nice Bengali architecture,  the chairs,  those Bengali novels everything is so perfectly decorated that you fall in love with this place.  But compared to the ambience their menu is not that vast.  The kitkat shake was very ordinary,  just a normal chocolate shake with a single piece of kitkat. üòêüòë. The cheese corn burst sandwich was very yummy and gooey but the portion was too less,  not even adequate for a single person.  
   Overall if you have ample time and want to chat endlessly with a coffee this is a nice Cosy place to date and all.  But not really recommend for hungry food lovers like me üòÑüòÑ. But once more let me mention the service was upto the mark and special mention again and again for the ambience ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

Was a bit dissapointing in terms of the atmosphere..the place is stuffy and the music can get to your head of you are not a fan of bengali classics!
Food proportions were small .The taste is decent ,however their signature mud pie was quite ordinary.
Vegetarians should avoid this place as there are practically two or three dishes in the veg category!

I went there to have my share of some light snacks after roaming around the streets of Kolkata. I had a steaming hot cup of coffee, veg.paneer sandwich and a white sauce veg pasta. Food was good and the service was prompt as well. Amazing behaviour by the staff.
There are two seating options, one on the ground floor and one on the first floor which is accompanied by a small store where you can buy pretty mugs and nooks, CDs and some crockery. I love the ambience. The wooden seating and the old bengali songs reminding you of how beautiful bengali music actually is. :)

Have heard about this place a lot..that it's a place for friends & adda. Finally visited here one eve with my buddies, had cappuccino, latte & choco mud cake. They didn't have the choco walnut cake. As per taste it was nothing mind blowing ..but okay. The service & ambience was fine. But what I heard of this restro..I really expected a lot more.

This place is located beside Manyavar showroom in triangular park. I have been to this place many times over the past few years. The chicken pasta is something that's good compared to price and quantity. You can try from a wide variety of sandwiches as well (the grilled ones are preferable). The fish and chips is nothing but a waste of money as well as choco mousse and mango mousse. The authentic mud cake used to be very good back 2 years but presently i didn't find the same quantity they used to give before..but quality wise its still okay.

Have been here only once, and we tried only two dishes. So my review may be a bit biased and inaccurate. Will surely update it once I try more items from their menu.

The decor is amazing. The ambiance is pacifying.
We ordered Fish n Chips, and Grilled MUD Chicken sandwich. Taste-wise, both dishes were average and could've been better. However, the quantity was a big disappointment. Being in a hurry, along with the fact that we didn't have much money that day, we left without spending more on other items. The price seemed a bit too much for the quantity.

The backdrop of Rabindra Sangeet by Debabrata Biswas sets the tone when you enter this place. The decor complements wonderfully with the music. The chemistry between the decor and music hits the perfect note and create an ambience worth remembering. The look will give one  a feeling of a nostalgic Kolkata which can still be perceived at small pockets of North Kolkata.

Just when you feel that you are going to have a nostalgic food as well, and at this very point you will be disappointed heavily. We had cappuccino, fish fingers, chicken cutlets and French fries. The primary problem with the food here is a low quantity / price ratio. The taste of the dishes will neither be engrossing nor you will have anything to cherish. 

I have a suggestion. When the cafe tries to revisit the flavour of old Kolkata, it should bring in more number of old dishes in their menu.

I would rather propose an average rating of 3 stars, and a half goes for the lovely ambience and music. One time visit !!

Heard of this new food joint cum cafe long ago, but today i got chance to visit this place and allow my taste buds to cherish and also allow myself to enjoy the ambience of the cafe. 
--Ambienece n Architecture : The cafe is a two storied cafe very nicely organised and also with very good persons who work their as attendants. The waiting area in the first floor is very nice with show pieces and handicrafts showcased from where u can buy also. 
--Theme : It is mainly focused on the renowned poets, story writers and singers of bengal of old ages like Rabindranath Tagore, Sarat Chandra Bose... All time rabindra sangeet is played in the background, very peaceful and good ambienece of adda. We got oppurtunity to sit on the first floor area.
-- Decor : The floor is covered with mats which bengalir used in the old days and also used in villages. U will feel like u r in an adda zone of bangali style;though chairs and table are there, sofas are there.   -- Food n Beverages : Now coming to food part we ordered for chicken cheese omlete and fish fingers with french fries. The dishes were nice and tasty. In beverages we ordered for normal filter coffe and one cold coffee with icecream of normal taste. 
--Other attractions: Also u will get lunch combos here at lunch time. 
Will visit again and share more reviews and pictures. This was a first hand review.

I've been here only once after hearing and reading a lot about this place. We had Oreo shake and sweet fresh lime soda,both of which were quite good. Ambience wise also,I loved the cafe because of its rabindrasangeet theme. We were too full to have any food but plan to go back soon to have some!

It has a cosy ambience... ideal for adda over coffee with a friends... We ordered Fish and chips along with chicken pasta in white sauce.... The fish and chips was good though.... But my experience with the pasta was not very pleasant. Firstly the pasta lacked taste definitely the creaminess was missing and lacked seasoning.... and to top it all we found a strand of hair in it.... although on showing it to them they did not charge us for the pasta but definitely not a pleasant experience.

Located near triangular park.. just opppsite to citystyl. This is one old building which has been converted to a cafe.. the cafe covers 2 floors.. the ambience is nice. Decoration is also nice. The staffs are very well behaved and courteous. We ordered the mud special sandwich, about which I heard a lot. It tasted nice but nothing out of the world. But it was tummy filling. Other than that we orderee walnut brownie with ice cream which was good. In drinks we had mud special mocktail, which is sprite based drink mixed with pudina leaf and lime. I felt the lime juice was added more than it was required. So as a whole tje food was okayish.
What I did not like about the place is.. the background music that was being played. Bengali songs of a very well known singer, which were very depressing. When I am out for adda and good food, depressing song is something which is absolutely a big turn off..

Well this was a very bad experience for me. Though i expected a lot. 
Stands upright in one of the finest locations of kolkata, triangular park. 
I had Mud Special Sandwich which wasnt so special at all. The stuffings were so poor. 
We ordered for the chicken white sause pasta, which tasted no less than home made sunfeast pasta treat. 
We liked the french fries just. 
It hardly did any justice to the bucks that i spent on the items. 
I would not like to visit this place again. 
Highly disappointed.

I visit there for third time.. Awesome ambience obviously and the food was yumm.. We ordered Chicken Pasta and blue lagoon.. And the most important fact which makes Mud different from all other cafes is its hygiene factor.. They give massive importance to hygiene f the food.. And the Rabindrana Sangeet added the bong nostalgia to the ambience.. Love to visit here again and again..

Homely place with good concept

Ambience: Located in Triangular Park, beside the Manyavar showroom, this place is a little bit hard to locate. However, once u find it, it will embrace u in its warm ambience. The cafe is two storied and the entire place strictly follows the organic theme.¬† It's an old house turned into a cafe. All the carpets are nothing but mats (madur). Chairs are mostly made of cane. The plates they serve in are paper made and looks like wooden plates. Books are kept near every table to keep u company. Light music of old bengali songs (particularly Rabindrasangeet by Debabrata Biswas) are played in the background. Lighting is also a perfect one for that old nostalgic bengali household and maintains that retro environment of the cafe. 

Food: We ordered a Brownie with ice cream and a beverage called Peach Passion. Food is okayish. Heard a lot about their sandwiches though. But didn't have enough time to try that. Price is pretty low so cannot complain much about the food.

Service: Service is very good. The waiters came out and collected our umbrellas even before we entered the cafe. Serving time was also pretty fast for us. The waiters were very prompt to look into if u need anything. Cash n card accepted. And the pocket pinch is really small.

Overall: Ideal for a classy date or a nice adda time with friends. Can visit again.

A small and crisp review about a small and crisp cafe.. 
Location: Near Deshapriya Park City style. Locating the cafe can be a lil tough as it is situated inside a small lane. Do watch for the name plate though. 

Ambiance: The cafe reminds me of crispy chili baby corn. It is small and tangy. Two storied cafe which is small and cozy. I went there with my two besties and voila! the cafe was all about the authentic bong genre. Feluda and all were there and I could see some books for sale too! Like most south kolkata cafes, this is also an old house renovated but i really don't care as long as I find the place cute. 

Food: We had a couple of things but I forgot to take all pics. I actually suck at clicking and when I see food, I don't even see Shahrukh Khan standing beside me. 
The food was above average, not the best in town to be a lil frank. We ordered Mexican chicken sandwich, Blue Lagoon, Hot chocolate and that oh! so famous choco mud cake. 
Mexican chicken sandwich was really good and the best among all. The right amount of spice and taste I need in my soupy life. Lol. 
Mud cake was average. Not the best to be sure. I didn't see any signature style in that small piece of sweetness. 
I hate mocktails and so didn't try that blue lagoon one. That was for my friend and she liked it. No comments! 
Hot chocolate was also so-so. I have tasted better my love! 

Overall, ummmm!! One time visit. If you are coming for a cozy cafe with your bae, you can give this a shot but if you are coming just to eat your heart out, you can give a second thought about it.

Well, first of all I really admire the decor. It's really very soothing. A good place to talk for a longer duration. 
Must visit.  It is reasonable which is very much required nowadays as we are just college goers. 
It feels like home. 
Go for the sandwich it looks simple but it is something that will surely satisfy you. 
It's just beside the leather world,triangular Park. Easy to locate. 
And yes people out there are very kind. Very much gentle.

The place is congested since it's a house turned into a cafe but the feel of the place with an oldies Bengali theme is outstanding. The evergreen Bengali music tracks plays lightly behind and the food items are too good. It's a great place for a cool and classy date or just a hangout with friends or family. Located at a very convenient location right beside Manyaavar near Hindustan Park, the cafe rocks. The pricing is very nominal and is quite easy on the pocket with very amicable waitering. Highly recommended.

I visited this place with 3 of my friends. 
We ordered  2 oreo shakes which was average,an Irish coffee which too was nothing extraordinary. 
Then we ordered  a chicken sandwich which was too small in relation to the price it takes. 
We asked for a hawain salad but due to our questioning on all types of salad, they mistook the order and provided us with Greek salad. 
We were way disappointed. With a cost of 625,we came out disappointed and disgusted.

Location: Triangular Park,just opposite to City Style.You have to enter this small lane to enter the two storied cafe. 
Ambience: You will get a vibe of bangaliana when you enter with rabindra sangeet on the background and the decor has a resemblance too the cutlery and the furniture has a impact if bangaliana too.
Food Ordered: Mud pie and Chicken Sandwich
^MUD PIE is  basically  an improvised form of Choco lava cake and is very chocolaty and is enough to sooth your soul (it's very sweet and you can't have the whole thing alone) 
CHICKEN SANDWICH was  tasty but the filling could have been a bit more.
Service is quite fast and good.Want to visit again and taste more dishes :)

Bengali's love for rabindrasangeet and adda is eternal. And when you get the bong feeling in a quaint little cafe, its pure bliss! Visited today afternoon with a friend. Its a house turned into cafe. The sitting areas are simply done with books and cd's,pictures and showpieces. You can hear those old records of rabindrasangeet playing in the background and its a winner. The food is really good and is sumptuous. Hope to visit again.

Mud is exactly opposite to Triangular Park Bus stop and next to Manyawar showroom !
This is a small joint for Bengalis specifically..
I went here with 4 of my friends on a sunday at about 4-4.30.. The staff is cooperative.
We sat in the first floor area.
Rabindra Sangeet is played here all the time.
The food is not that much worthy.
We ordered -
Corn sandwich : it was good.
Pasta : not good.
Kitkat shake : ok.
Filter coffee : total waste.
Hot Chocolate : it was ok, not much wow.

We ordered mix and red sauce pasta - both were the same , even the staff couldn't differentiate which one is red and which one is mix !
Not a recommended place to visit.

One of my all time favorites. One can spend hours over there chatting with loved ones and listening to the evergreen Rabindra Sangeet sang by one of the most soulful rabindra sangeet singer Debabrata Biswas, which is always being played over there, since it is his house only(as told to us by one of their staff). It is a small and cozy place. Interior is really good. Good behavior from the staff. Coming to the food items, my all time favorites are the Grilled Mud Sandwich and Chocolate Mud Cake. These two are the must trys. Other food items are also good. Sandwiches are very fresh(because I have an experience of not getting fresh sandwiches in many such cafes). Smoothies and mocktails are also good. Watermelon smoothie and Lemongrass Cooler are the ones I have tried. I love this place but their menu lacks varieties, due to which some of my friends(who are not sandwich lovers) did not enjoy the food there much. Thus, cutting half a marks.

After reading all reviews and also discovered zomato rating's.. I wished to been there at least once upon a time..so,finally today I visit this place with my friends..
" DAMN EXPERIENCE"
I rated 1for their inner wall decoration..which is perfect..
Now coming to the important part of "MUD" cafe..
fOOd-when they served their very tasty awesome food (refer to their positive reviewer).my eyes became "OO".. That's why I written " fOOd"..We ordered 2chicken & cheese sandwich and 2 cappuccino..

fOOd quality-
1.Chicken & cheese sandwich- It comes with 4 piece's and some lay's over on it.
A square shaped sandwich,approximately 6cm. Length and breadth..and the filling was .....what??? Seriously I don't know was there any chicken / cheese???
Cost-130√ó2=260
Rating- (-5/5)

2.Cappuccino-They served 2 cappuccino with 5 sugar pouch and 2 biscuits..
Cost-95√ó2=190
Rating-(2/5)

Suggestions- In one word "Don't go"..
If u want to eat sandwich,please go " Sugar & Spice"
Trust me they will give you super tasty sandwich just ‚Çπ40..

Important declaration-The menu card which is shown on zomato is absolutely wrong. They increase their each and every food Price. And also added 5% Gst..

So,please" MUD" develop the food quality and quantity..An extra ordinary wall decoration and ambiance wouldn't last longer your 4‚Ä¢2 zomato rating's.

I am writing this review of Mud after my 3rd visit to this place. It‚Äôs needless to say all the 3 experiences were overwhelming. Basically it‚Äôs a Caf√© with Bengali ambience. Established in the house of the renowned ‚ÄòRabindra Sangeet Shilpi‚Äô Debabrata Biswas (aka George Biswas ), Mud is an awesome place to sit & start a ‚Äònirvejal adda‚Äô (chit-chat) with your friends / closed ones. The best part it‚Äôs a no-hurry place. You can start your adda & order food whenever you feel like ordering . Also, once you have finished your food, you can continue your adda as well (no one will come to bother you in both the cases. ) 

It‚Äôs basically located adjacent to the Manyavaar outlet at Triangular Park. By crossing the narrow lane, once you enter the caf√©, it‚Äôs suggested to take the stairs & have a seat at the 1st floor. The calm & soothing environment with Rabindra Sangeet playing in the background will instantly make you comfortable. The d√©cor is calm & beautiful with books / show-pieces all around & mat (chatai or madoor as they say in Hindi / Bengali ).

Now, coming to food; it scores high on this front. Their Mud-sandwich is their signature dish and a must try. The fish & chips, Mutton Ghugni & their Dahi Chicken all are descent & will lure your taste-buds for sure. On the drinks front, their Pineapple Blossom is a Hidden Gem. On the food/ menu font the biggest plus is that they do not charge you any extra tax on bill (My experience was before the implementation of GST not sure about the situation post the implementation). 

Final Verdict, go for the place if you want to spend time with your friends or want to meet up with someone special over a cup of coffee (& some food to go with it !) .

Nice place. Ignites the bangaliana feeling.. lovely decor. Soulful music with reasonably priced food. Been here quite a few times. Only glitch is that the bills are generated on the previous day date.

Ambience and decor are of very casual, gossip-friendly nature. The service was average. The staff were courteous. But the mud-cake was pathetic, although the Egg-Mayo sandwich and coffee were great! Not visiting second time though.

After reading all reviews and also discovered zomato rating's.. I wished to been there at least once upon a time..so,finally today I visit this place with my friends..
" DAMN EXPERIENCE"
I rated 1for their inner wall decoration..which is perfect..
Now coming to the important part of "MUD" cafe..
fOOd-when they served their very tasty awesome food (refer to their positive reviewer).my eyes became "OO".. That's why I written " fOOd"..We ordered 2chicken & cheese sandwich and 2 cappuccino..

fOOd quality-
1.Chicken & cheese sandwich- It comes with 4 piece's and some lay's over on it.
A square shaped sandwich,approximately 6cm. Length and breadth..and the filling was .....what??? Seriously I don't know was there any chicken / cheese???
Cost-130√ó2=260
Rating- (-5/5)

2.Cappuccino-They served 2 cappuccino with 5 sugar pouch and 2 biscuits..
Cost-95√ó2=190
Rating-(2/5)

Suggestions- In one word "Don't go"..
If u want to eat sandwich,please go " Sugar & Spice"
Trust me they will give you super tasty sandwich just ‚Çπ40..

Important declaration-The menu card which is shown on zomato is absolutely wrong. They increase their each and every food Price. And also added 5% Gst..

So,please" MUD" develop the food quality and quantity..An extra ordinary wall decoration and ambiance wouldn't last longer your 4‚Ä¢2 zomato rating's.

Mud is really a great place to hangout with your best buddies and Loved ones. A cafe with a taste of a rich culture with Rabindra Sangeet playing all over the Cafe. A friendly atmosphere. Feels like your own drawing room.

A simple but cosy atmosphere..  like their food and ambience. located at rashbehari avenue, just beside the manyavar showroom. one of my friend has took me there and gave a treat. Debabrata biswas's song was played in the background and it's very  soothing. we have tried their mutton ghugni, fish and chips, cheese  and chicken sandwich,  meyo amd chicken sandwich, chicken mud ball. love their food serving style and the tastes.

I have been to this place with 3 of my friends frw days ago. The ambience here is perfect for chatting heart out with friends.  The staffs were courteous too. The reason i am giving 1 star is becuse of the quantity of food they serve. We ordered 2 oreo shakes, one chicken grilled sandwich and one hawaaiian salad. The oreo shake was good (but the taste was nothing extraordinary), the sandwich was tasty but i felt when you are  charging 120 for a sandwich,  the amount should satisfy atleast one person's hunger pang. Also the salad was just horrible (just some boiled vegetables with olive oil) . Overall  the experience wasnt worthwhile. I felt the place is only good for hangouts and not for foodies.

The level of the Irish coffee can be worked upon but the overall place is definitely makes it a go to when around Gariahat.

My friend took me to MUD and since then I have visited this place a lot of times. It is located in a small lane opposite to City Style.
I have tasted many dishes like the grilled chicken sandwich, meat balls, chicken omelette and I can say they are decent in taste. Though I didn't like their chicken salad and pasta at all. And I like my coffee less sweet. The cold coffee with or without ice cream is fair. The deserts are better like brownie with vanilla ice cream.
The ambience is soothing but as it is a very tiny place you can rarely enjoy the music.
The staff is polite but cannot handle many clients at a time. They run very late on serving the orders.
Overall it is fine for a quick pick.

A Cosy coffee parlour located near Hindustan Park.This particular cafeteria is the epitome of simplicity.Although the space of the place is limited but still they managed very well to give it an exquisite touch.As soon as you enter you feel the warmth of the place.Decorated with jute furnitures this place carries it's own charisma.Staffs are polite and decent.Food is average as we eat in home.And somewhere it is justified to the amount they charge. So if someone wishes to go to a posh yet traditional place to spend some hours this place would be great.Looking forward to visit again.

Food taste is really good. Specially if you are health conscious u can try the salads. Overall nice experience.

This cafe is located in Triangular Park just beside the Manyavar showroom.It is easy to miss the cafe from the outside.
The cafe has a nice Bengali feel to it with the cane chairs,soft rabindrasangeet in the background.The decor is very nice with books and cds adorning the wall.
We ordered chicken pasta in white sauce and Mexican chicken burger.
The quantity of the pasta was good.However it was bland to be honest.The base sauce had little seasoning.The only seasoning was on the top with dried oregano and chilli flakes.
The Mexican burger was very good.It came with a side of fries and mustard and tomato sauce.The bread was soft.The chicken patty was tender and not dry,and the spice mayo added a nice tang to the dish.
Service was alright and the pocket pinch reasonable.Overall a nice experience.Would love to try out the various sandwiches on offer sometime later.

Just went for a bite and really enjoyed. Ambience was great (Bengali touch, which I like). The place was almost full when we got there‚Äã, so didn't get a seat upstairs. Food was ok, could've been better. Staff was prompt. In short, had a great time and would love to go again (this time better be upstairs).

Mud is absolute bliss. It's a very quiet little joint with the beautiful voice of Debabrata Biswas playing in the background. For all those who aren't aware, Mud is situated at the house of the great legend. Their food is not at all costly and they taste amazing. LOVE their Mud cake. It has a gooey centre and is soft and smooth in taste. The Mud special chicken balls are great too. Pocket pinch is on the lesser side with an amazing experience. A must visit for all. Seating arrangements aren't much but then I doubt anyone's complaining. :)

MUD stands right beside the Manyavaar showroom near triangular park, with small lane entrance decorated with pictures. But once you enter the place the atmosphere changes. I felt that nostalgic old house charm, with a laidback relaxed atmosphere in here. Here you can sit and chill no hurry no worry, staffs are literally good behaved and even if you order just a drink they don't mind! I think this attitude will earn them more and more customers. And there were also playing Rabindrasangeet in the background which was also nice. And this place is pocket friendly as there are no extra taxes.

Visited MUD last week. Pretty impressive cafe! I dropped in with three of my friends and ordered for chicken pasta in white sauce and caramel pudding. Both tasted very good... especially the caramel pudding. The quantity was absolutely satisfactory. The ambience stole my heart. Dim light, soothing ambience and rabindrasangeet playing in the background. Absolutely perfect. The only glitch is that many of items were not available. That should be rectified. Otherwise the food we ordered was very tasty. Good luck!

I have been here several times and i have lost counts now. My one of the favourite joints when u can sit n chill, no hurry, no worry, staffs are literally good behaved and even if u order just a drink they dont mind! I belief this attitude will earn them more and more customers. I have had coffees - Cappucino, latte, irish coffee, chicken with mustard sandwich, Mexican chicken sandwich, Chicken tikka sandwich, Fish n chips, Lemongrass mojito, Pineapple blossom etc etc. Sooo comfortable i feel here with mat floorings n soft yellow toned lights.....I definitely pay a visit here whenevr i am in Gariahat. Location is easy just beside Manyavar. For those who believe in earthy places and nothing fancy stuffs it is a great place to spend some quality time silently. They have a small pottery section for display and sitting arrangement comprises of three floors!

The interior is very warm. 
The seating arrangements are very comfy and relaxing. 
Every time I visit this place, I always try their Choco Mud Cake which is just too irresistible.  Tried their Blue Lagoon but didn't quite like it. A nice place to have an adda with your buddies amidst soft soothing music. Food is quite affordable.

Got to know about this place from zomato. 
Ambience was well organised with a hint of proper bangaliyana. I visited to get a break from d scorching heat but the cafe wasnt cold  enough either. 
Tried mud special sandwich.. frankly speaking i found it overpriced in comparison to its quantity  with few flakes of potato chips. But it tasted good. Cappuccino was also good. 
Staffs were cordial.

It's a well decorated place to hangout with friends and family. The touch of bengali crafts are so much appealing and definitely it's a must go for Tagore Lovers. Here u can find heart healing tunes of Tagore songs and in the way to upstairs the wall will definitely remind you about our very own Ray sir...just a incredible place to go...concept is nice and when it comes about the food!!

We were searching for a place for out next team meeting and a friend suggested this place. Now, this was on my bucket list for a long time, but this was the chance then.
On a Sunday morning, around 11am, Gariahat road seemed quite empty owing to the scorching heat outdoors. Mud stands right beside the Manyavaar showroom near triangular park, with a small lane entrance decorated with pictures. But once you enter the place, the atmosphere changes. I felt that nostalgic old house charm, with a laidback relaxed atmosphere in here. We sat in the room on the first floor. There was a bell in the room to call the staff if you need anything. The house was playing Rabindrasangeet in the background, which was again nice.
We tried quite a few number of items, mostly liquid ones to satisfy the thirst. The mud sandwich is a must try. Coolers like iced tea and pinneaple blossom also tastes great. There are no extra taxes, that's such a great news !

I am definitely up for a revisit here.

It was a team meeting and thankfully somebody chose this place over the numerous cafes around. The ambience woozes of bangaliana (with the madur decor and rabindrasangeet). It's a 2 storied property (at least what I saw) and a small shopping zone tucked in the 1st floor. From whatever we've tried, Pineapple blossom and chicken grilled sandwich are a mist try. Mojito was pretty average, but iced tea was great. And, it was pretty thoughtful of them to keep a calling bell to call the servers.¬†

Only one point, if the music volume could've been reduced a little, would've been better. And a bigger signage at the entrance would've helped.

Went there on a Sunday evening with my friends. Took cheese corn burst sandwich, Hawaiian salad, hot chocolate, chocolate mud cake and two Walnut brownie with ice cream. The sandwich was very delicious and cheesy, the salad was okayish and the hot chocolate too. The mud cake was yummy too I liked it very much üòç along with the brownie with icecream. The brownie with icecream was so good that we ordered another one. Price is absolutely reasonable and cheap.Looking forward to visit this place again ‚ò∫

To start with the best part about mud cafe, is its decorum! An absolutely beautifully decorated cafe that creates a homely atmosphere for the visitor. Located just beside the manyavar showroom of triangular park, mud cafe can be best explained by its calm and tranquil ambience and the jute materials that beautifully fits to the design of the cafe. From my side,i would definitely give full marks to MUD for its interior. Coming to food, everything was good except the quantity. We ordered one grilled mud sandwich, greek chicken salad and chocolate mud cake. The sandwich was good but the egg stuffing just took over the taste of chicken. Inspite of being chicken sandwich, i could hardly find any pieces of chicken in it. Mud sandwich will definitely be liked by the egglovers! The greek chicken salad was fresh and healthy full of vegetables and boiled chicken shreads.  Not bad. The best part of our order was the chocolated mud cake. One full plate of molten cake loaded with hot chocolate sauce was an amazing treat to the tongue. Its a must try! Apart from this, another mention to the quantity of the food should be given. The quantity they serve for each item can only satisfy people having less appetite. So i think thats a concern for this place. Otherwise the service was also good. The prices are very much affordable and inuclusive of taxes. So if you want a cheap place with very good ambience, MUD can definitely be the place for you !

We entered to a splendid display of Bengali culture and music.The Rabindranath Tagore photos,books as well as the Rabindra Sangeet playing in the background were simply charming.The ambience is decent,makes you feel really relaxed and comfortable.But then we ordered food,that sort of didn't match to our expectations.
1.Dahi Chicken with Roomali Roti - Was decent,slightly sweet with a definite touch of Bengali cuisine. (4/5)
2.Chicken Pasta(white sauce) - Now this was really disappointing.Very bad. The vegetables & chicken were separate in taste, with the sauce not mixed to proportion.Simply bland and not at all likable.Needs huge improvement to say the least. (1.5/5)
3.Chicken MUD Grilled Sandwich - This was really tasty and is definitely a must try dish !! But then, it's hardly filling for 2 people.Too less in terms of quantity. (4/5)
4.Pina Colada - This was simply horrifying.It tasted simply as sprite mixed with Ralli's pineapple syrup.Wasn't even cold so we had to ask for ice cubes. (1/5)
5.Walnut Brownie with Ice-Cream - Was definitely tasty, specially the brownie.Worth a try. (4/5)
Prompt Service and the staff were really helpful.The place is pretty small.At the most, 15 people could be accomodated.Is really pocket-friendly(no tax charged on the menu prices) but then the quantity of food isn't that great !!
Overall a decent experience.With such beautiful Bengali decoration and soothing music making you feel the very essence of true Kolkata,if they could really improve on their food quality and the place size,it would end up being one of the most popular hotspots in the area.

We took the Mexican burger which was crunchy and tasty; the roomali roti with dahi chicken, which was tasty but with an overpowering flavour of mustard oil and the grilled mud sandwich which was a huge let down, as the lower deck had only boiled eggs with no other flavour and the upper one had little shredded chicken with negligible or zero mayo or cheese as was described in the menu. The refreshments - the lemongrass mojito had no flavour of lemongrass, the masala lemonade had big chunks of black pepper which was a let down and the lime soda was okayish. The seating arrangement in the 3rd floor was very awkward. It seemed like people had to share the tables and sofas. The decor was good no doubt, and we did not get rabindrasangeet as requested.

The first thing you notice about this cafe, which was once Rabindrasangeet maestro Debabrata Biswas's residence, is it's utterly Bengali feel. Right down from the building to the decor to the softly playing Rabindrasangeet in the background to even the lightly sweet fragrance of cream and sandesh in the air (this one might just be my imagination), there's something extremely soothing, homely, even nostalgic here for the quintessential Bengali.
The place takes pride in its heritage, with posters to remind you where you are, and an array of music CDs and books on Tagore for sale on a shelf. A grinning poster of Ashish Vidyarthi reminds you it takes pride in it's progress too.
I have tried their cold coffee with ice cream and chicken mud balls, on my one trip here. The cold coffee with ice cream was good, served in tall glasses and generous in quantity. The chicken mud balls, resembling gulab jamuns in appearance, were unique. I've not quite tasted anything like it before, it's chicken keema in a ball of besan fried to a muddy brown exterior, yet tender inside. I liked it, but I would leave it's description as unique- I think it needs a bit of a Bengali tastebud to appreciate this one, especially with kasundi to accompany.¬†
I mean to try their kosha mangsho next. Something tells me, they'll do it right.

MUD... it's just the best kind of Mud you can ever get yourself into, I have loved every visit to this cafe. I've been there with family, with friends and with my foodie partner. A perfect Bengali cafe. They have excellent service. We got lots of free coke on their special monsoon offer. The ambience has such a fresh bengali vibe about it with the bamboo and thatched mats decor; the Rabindra sangeet that plays in the background just completes it perfectly.
I have tried
MUD grilled sandwich. It's a great. Filling. N the way they serve the eggs inside. Super.
Dahi chicken meal. It's sweet and tastes good with the chillies.
Kosha mangsho meal. Average.
Chicken grilled sandwich. A nice choice.
Hawaiian salad. Fresh and quite good.
Cold coffee. Nice :)
MUD special mojito. Wasn't much cold. Had gandharaj flavour.
MUD cake. 3 words. Just try it!
Brownie with ice cream. The usual taste. Nicely served.
Pasta. Okay this they made just simply horrible.
Caramel pudding. Dry and disappointing.
Fish and chips. Average. Small portion.
Burger. Average.
I disliked the taste of the Mutton phuchka n it seemed way too pricey.

Amazed by its cuteness of decor and its effort to relive bengali culture and music specially rabindra sangeet . A very decent , peaceful place in the hustle bustle of the city ... not only serving good fusion and innovative food but also selling exotic handicrafts , bengali music , books , Darjeeling and assam tea , handmade jewellries . An unique effort to put many arms of business under a single roof . Am surprised by their ideas but very pleasently

A decently spacious, well done up cafe on Rashbehari Avenue with courteous and friendly staff. However, I found their food to be a bit on the expensive side for the quantity offered and the taste is pretty average too. They get full points for decor but need to work on their food. Also, the service is a bit slow. We ordered the Grilled Mud Sandwich, Chicken & Cheese Omelette, Fish n Chips and Chocolate Mud Cake. The sandwich was average tasting but the Omelette was pretty good. The Fish n Chips was again not up to the mark, the fish was too thin. The Chocolate Mud Cake was a hot delicious mess and was the saving grace.

Overall, there is a lot of room for improvement.

Quite a disgusting experience to begin with. 
They have a beautiful place and ambience and also very well behaved staffs. 
The whole problem lies in their food. Stale Mutton Ghugni and too small a portion for the price they take(thankfully they didn't charge for it after we told them the issue). Chicken mud sandwich was good in taste but again not filling at all for two. The chicken white sauce pasta was pathetic. Extremely bland and awfully prepared. The sauce lacked any consistency leading to a watery thing. Darjeeling tea was good though.
All in all this place is sufficiently bestowed with ample space and quite a classy decor. Having said that, that is all it can boast about. They must must hire a better chef and introduce interesting food options. And also the food is overpriced for the quantity and quality they serve. The price in the menu is inclusive of taxes.
Thankfully the staffs saved us with their suitable behaviour and hospitality.
Kindly improve your food standards. Only keeping a beautiful decor and decent ambience won't save you in the long run. Work on your food. Please.

After a tasty day of Food Marathon we finally ended up at MUD for a sweet tooth to end with.

Located off Rashbehari Avenue near Hindustan Park. 
Its a sweet quiet place tucked into the crowded area. The decor is simple enough to not bother you. It has seating arrangements on Ground floor as well as First Floor.

We ordered the Chocolate Mud Cake, a Chocolate Mousse and a Mango Mousse.

The Mud Cake was heaven. Just so Gooooeeyy and oozing with melted chocolate in between. This is a must over here.

The Chocolate Mousse was pretty normal. Nothing exclusive or detrimental about it.

The Mango Mousse didn't serve well. The taste of canned Alphonso stocked for a long time will never suit the palate of a Mango lover.

Cheers to the great work!

The mud special sandwich is just amazing. But the hotdog and burgers were nothing special in fact I didn't like it. And the hot chocolate actually tasted like bornvita. It took soon long to bring the the hot chocolate that my expectations soared up but got utterly disappointed. However the ambience was good and the staffs were good too. But I have hopes on MUD hence I will visit once more to taste other dishes

This place is situated just opposite to city style in triangular park. The place is nice and the ambience is average. Dhunno and rabindra sangeet makes this place a bong's favourite. The food is good. We had sandwiches and fish and chips. The fish and chips was good but the chicken club sandwich was not up to the mark. But the prices are not very high which makes this place very good for a quick Adda.

Based on the reviews,had an urge to visit this small cafe. Not many cafe are seen in Kolkata where RabindraSangeet is being played in the background.¬†

LOCATION (4/5) : Hindusthan Park,Kolkata. Near City Style outlet.Easy to locate.If you are going from Gariahat towards Rashbehari More,it will be on your left side. The zomato map is sufficient to locate this place.

AMBIENCE (3.5/4) : Though Rabindransangeet is being played in the backdrop along with the voice of the legend Debabrata Biswas,I will say it's a quiet cafe. If you want to spend some time with your people without the hustle-bustle, you may visit this place.

FOOD (4/5) :¬†
1. Darjeeling Tea : A nice option to start of a chitchat.Served in a designed pot with some cookies.

2. Grilled Mud Sandwich (4/5) : Sandwich made with chicken,egg, cheese and mayo.Served with potato wedges.

3.Mutton Ghugni (3.5/4) : ¬†Typical Bengali Style Ghugni with minced Mutton.Served with onions,lemon and green chilly. Comes in a small bowl.The taste was okeyish...not up to the mark as I expected.

4. Dahi Chicken with Rumali Roti (4/5) : This is a mini meal that I tried.Chicken was well cooked. 4 pieces of chickens were there with 2 Rumali Rotis.

STAFF and SERVICES (4/5) ¬†: Staff are really courteous and prompt.

Way to go Team MUD....Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wish you all the best.....!!!!!

Regards,

Wonderful place.. great ambiance.
What else do you need  when Tagore's song  is playing in the background specially by Debabrata Biswas..actually this place was the house of this great genius which has turned to be a great cafe now.Any way we went there and ordered one chicken mud s/w along with a virgin mojito and chicken pasta..all though the food arrived little late but it made all worthy..all tasted just wonderful specially the sandwich..lastly we had one chicken cheese omelette ..not a bad one.. although we had a great experience there..a perfect cafe to hang out...

This place is quite cozy and pretty good for spending time with friends and colleagues but the food was not up to the mark. The 'chicken' salad didn't have chicken in it. For once I thought I have ordered bell pepper salad. Murg pulao was comparatively better but the quantity of rice is not sufficient for even one person.

One thing I have to say about this place is that it is situated in a very convenient location- just beside the Manyavar showroom opposite city style. Very nice and posh ambience. A good place for casual hangouts. However, the food served is not very praise worthy. Never order the hot dog, as it is nothing near to the original delicacy. The burgers are average, but the masala french fries are quite nice. Bevareges such as cold coffe, milk shakes and fresh lime soda are also good and the prices are not very heavy on the pocket.

Worst experience ever ! 
Such rubbish chicken salad 
We cudnt even find chicken in it. Chicken salads usually have shredded chicken but chicken was actually negligible.
Next we ordered murg pulao which was not that bad but the quantity of rice isn't sufficient even for one person 
Not worth of 145 rupees !

MUD is located in triangular park opposite to city style. A tiny cafe with a cosy environment playing old bengali songs. It is a really pocket friendly cafe with good food and service. This cafe is a must revisit.

This cafe is located on the first floor of a house that has been redesigned as a cafe . The theme is everything bengali , with cane mats on the floor and furniture made of cane , and the plates are also synced to whole theme of bangaliana in this little wonderland located a few metres away from gariahat Spencer's. The cafe is a little difficult to spot , but once you reach khyber pass , just look to the left before you spot a tiny alley leading to this little heaven . The interiors are warmly lit and the menu has the usual cafe fare , with a touch of exclusivity that adds to the wow factor of this awesome cafe ! The water is served in paper glasses and the food in paper plates . The mud sandwich we ordered had chicken and boiled egg filling with a layer of mayo, served with mustard and tomato sauce , and complimentary mayonnaise. Please do try this beauty if you happen to drop by here ! The gondhoraj mojito tasted just as good , with diced gondhoraj adding zest to a regular cooler . The chicken Hawaiian salad tasted good too , though I wish the pepper was cut a bit more to the convenience of forks, the slices of which were too long to eat without spilling ! The mud cake is also a must try , and is a lava-cake-meets-brownie super deal that will leave you craving for more of its chocolatey goodness . The prices here are extremely reasonable, and the light rabindrasangeet sets the mood for some good old heart to heart . Sit here , eat, have your adda , or just read books . You're sure to come back and won't be disappointed!

I had heard it was a quiet small little coffee place. When we had visited it was the Valentine's week and therefore it was very beautifully decorated with balloons and flowers. The decor is unique with chairs and wooden tables which they made of wires. My group of friends had come just for a place to give adda. We had the mud special mojito and the Pina Colada. The mud special Mojito was basically a Virgin Mojito and the Pina Colada was not that well made. Then we move to the deserts and we ordered a chocolate walnut brownie with ice cream. The waiter had a special recommendation with an array of cupcakes. The cupcakes were very beautifully decorated however they didn't  taste so good. Overall it is a nice little place for an evening get together.

OK so visited this place in Naboborsho eve...this was my first tym visit here,had chicken and cheese sandwich,mud special sandwich and watermelon smoothie.Our total bill was Rs360 which was tax inclusive.The sandwiches were really good but the watermelon smoothie was bland as there was lack of sweetness...
Although this is my first visit,the ambience just stole my heart with low soft Bengali song playing at the background...Guys you can definitely go and try out this cafe as it is more or less reasonable...

This place feels like home. If you're living in Kolkata and haven't visited this place yet , you're missing a nice spot. The food is brilliant , period , so is at a reasonable price. Their service is on point and the fact that they give such a friendly vibe is one of the many reasons you'd love to come here more than twice.

a really cute cafe at gariahat. enough space to accomodate at least 30 people . very good atmosphere . really innovative arrangements . ordered a chicken and cheese sandwich . meat balls and caramel pudding . the sandwich which was served with chips turned out to be delicious . the meat balls didnt impress us much . neither did the caramel custard . still giving a 4 rating because of their atmosphere and sandwich. will surely try to have other dishes from here as well . one more thing they have a good collection of bengali books which you can buy as well . and some other items were there for sell. last but not the least the prices then were inclusive of taxes . i dont know about now . visited the place last year in december .

A really soothing and calm ambiance with old Bengali songs humming in the background. We had fish and chips: nice but nothing remarkable, chicken Mexican sandwich: outstanding, watermelon mojito: great choice for scorching summer months, Oreo shake: yumm, KitKat shake: not so great, mud cake: lip smacking.. A cheap, small cafe with its own unique flavour. Worth giving it a shot.

Honestly, the name did not give me much hype to go there until yesterday, my friend suggested to meet there. The location is prime...just opposite City style in Triangular park. I entered the cafe and Oh my god!! It was such a homely decor with that aristocratic bong features everywhere. The entire floor was covered with mats or what we call in bengali is "madur". The walls had bengali albums hanging, tagore books properly arranged in the shelves and old bengali songs playing in the background. The open kitchen and the tables lined up in front of that adds to the "bangaliyana" soft and serene ambiance. We had Kitkat shake, cold coffee, mud sandwich, chicken tikka sandwich and chocolate mud cake. The food was tasty and within budget. The service was also swift. The only suggestion I would give them is to extend the menu in food items. The decor and ambiance will probably take me there again and again.

This is located at triangular park, right beside manyavar.. I went there with my bestie after hearing so much compliments about the ambience.. really the ambience is so beautiful.. its a 2 storied building, basically it was the house of famous rabindra sangeet singer Debabrata Biswas.. the place is decorated beautifully.. rabindra sangeet plays in the background.. now lets come to the food.. we ordered mexican chicken sandwich, hot chocolate and walnut brownie with ice-cream.. sandwich was good and brownie was too good.. but i would say food quantity is not that much good compared to the prices.. all over it was a good experience :)

A beautiful place which looks more than just romantic in the Valentine's month.
Their food, quite reasonable
Drinks Decent.
Service and Ambiance: 9/10

Chocolate Mud Cake(9/10): Sweet to its core but not for those who can't take the bitterness of dark chocolate. Quantity is just about right. Perfect dessert, better to be shared since that much of sweetness isn't good for one.

Masala Cola(6/10): Not having this next time, since there's nothing extraordinary in this for the price we pay.

Mud Special Kolkata Mojito(9/10): This is a good drink to accompany your dessert/food. Looks good to. Its a must have.

Location - Located in  Triangular park just next to leder land shop. The cafe is in a small lane where the security guard will escort you to the store.
Ambiance- This is a two storied cafe with a design of old buildings and it is  furnished in such a way it will give you a homely feeling.When I visited this place rabindrasangeet was being played which made the environment sweet and serene.
But I found this place claustrophobic as the place is too small in width. 
Food ordered- Kit kat milk shake and cold coffee
Quality-As expected(nothing hifi)
I could not be at the place for too long as I Found it claustrophobic and had to leave soon.
I look forward to visit this place soon to try some more of their items.

Was searching for a cafe and found this. Went there, after saw the rating in Zomato..
Location - Near triangular park.. Beside main road only.

Ambience - Aaah! Am totally in love with the ambience.. Kind a old looking kolkata bari types with soft old songs playing in low sound.. In one word "UNIQUE"..

Food ordered - Dahi chicken with rumali rooti, Mexican chicken sandwich, Mud special kolkata mojito, kitkat shake

Food Review - I just love the Mexican chicken sandwich, perfectly made.. Sandwich at its best trust me. Dahi chicken was also good, but gravy was not that thick. Overall its good. Mud special kolkata mojito was ok, nothing special. Kinda fresh lime soda type (prepared with gandharaj lebu).. Chocolate lovers will love the kitkat shake.. Prepared with kitkat(could have been better though)..

Should I visit again - yes absolutely.. In love with the sandwich and ambience.. Overall a great experience there..

Located in triangular park beside manyavar opp city style.. A cozy place for hangout. Ordered the following:
Chicken Mud Sandwich- I liked this dish a lot but the quantity could have been more. They served 4 chips with the dish. The quantity of chips also could have been more üòù. The sandwich had a layer of chicken cheese and boiled egg and mayo.
Chicken Mexican Salad - A cold chicken salad tossed with mayo and veggies and a few pieces of pineapple. I didn't quite like the dish. I personally feel the veggies being raw should have been more thinly cut.

Became my favourite cafe...here's the reasons..
Location: Hisdustan park. By the roadside. 
Ambience: Pure Bengali ambience. Floors covered by jute sheets(madur/rajai). Old bengali songs playing in the background. Although many of us dnt like old songs but in this plc it goes wd the ambience. It wont bore you.
Food: Ordered mud sandwich( chicken, egg, myo) and Darjeeling green tea pot (serves 2). Sandwich was a real yum. It was served with mustard sauce and tomato sauce which just added to its taste. And the tea was usual.
Overall quite a nice place for college students. And also very cheap. Am gonna visit mud again.
P.s. The staffs are great...really

This place is located just opposite city style near triangular park. It was actually singer Debabrata biswas's house which they have remodelled into this quaint caf√© with soothing lights and minimalistic decor with the singer's songs playing in the background.

It's a great option if one is looking forward to having a quick meeting or an elaborate conversation with friends,be it anything the ambience the makes it just perfect.

The food is to look out for and one should definitely try the fish and chips and the chicken and cheese omelette.
The other items like the sandwiches and the combo menu is great too.

What makes it better is the pocket friendly price and it's a great option for students because they do not charge any extra taxes,which is like the icing on the cake.

The behaviour of the staff is very polite and the cafe gives a very homely feel and customers do leave with a very happy and positive vibe.

P.S: They also have a small handicrafts store inside the caf√©.

Mud: A good coffee shop for carrying long conversations and adda. 
=====
Intro & Location:

It's located near Triangular park opposite to citi style. I had been here as few of my friends had reached this place and then, we went on trying this place. We sat at the first floor and we just took few things from here. The cafe ambiance is calm and composed and the service is quite fast. 

The cafe is small but has been beautifully decorated. It is more of a homely atmosphere out here. 
=====
‚óã Mix Sauce Pasta - The fucilli mix sauce pasta was presented to us. It was topped with cheese. The pasta was fine but the gravy was quite tangy due to extra tomato gravy added. Overall, tasted fine.

‚óã Chocolate Mousse - The mousse was great. It just costed 50 bucks and was great to share. 
=====
Pros:

‚óã Good hospitality.

‚óã Good Atmosphere and Ambiance.

‚óã Pocket Friendly.

‚óã Calm and a good place for conversations.

Became my favourite cafe...here's the reasons..
Location: Hisdustan park. By the roadside. 
Ambience: Pure Bengali ambience. Floors covered by jute sheets(madur/rajai). Old bengali songs playing in the background. Although many of us dnt like old songs but in this plc it goes wd the ambience. It wont bore you.
Food: Ordered mud sandwich( chicken, egg, myo) and Darjeeling green tea pot (serves 2). Sandwich was a real yum. It was served with mustard sauce and tomato sauce which just added to its taste. And the tea was usual.
Overall quite a nice place for college students. And also very cheap. Am gonna visit mud again.
P.s. The staffs are great...really

This place is located just opposite city style near triangular park. It was actually singer Debabrata biswas's house which they have remodelled into this quaint caf√© with soothing lights and minimalistic decor with the singer's songs playing in the background.

It's a great option if one is looking forward to having a quick meeting or an elaborate conversation with friends,be it anything the ambience the makes it just perfect.

The food is to look out for and one should definitely try the fish and chips and the chicken and cheese omelette.
The other items like the sandwiches and the combo menu is great too.

What makes it better is the pocket friendly price and it's a great option for students because they do not charge any extra taxes,which is like the icing on the cake.

The behaviour of the staff is very polite and the cafe gives a very homely feel and customers do leave with a very happy and positive vibe.

P.S: They also have a small handicrafts store inside the caf√©.

A bit disappointed with the service..they didn't accept the little app deal which we had..don't know why..but it was clearly visible in the app..so people..be careful..they don't accept these deals any more!
Now comes to the food & ambience..far better than expectations..it was our first time..but surely not the last!
An awesome joint for a coffee break ! Just opposite to City style,triangular park..

Heard a lot about this place and thought of giving it a try.  I had ordered an Irish coffee. Didn't get what I had expected.  No foam and couldn't feel much of the alcohol taste either. 
Also I took chicken kasha and roti.  Chicken kasha tasted really nice but one side of the chicken piece was a bit cold.  Though they said they could have warmed the dish for us but not a good first experience.  :( 
The fish finger that I had ordered was not the traditional fingers we usually get.  The fish was minced and mashed with masala and potato probably but it was good. But was a bit pricey.

Been here several times. One of my fav cafes in south Kolkata. Very nice and homely decor with lots of books, which you can read and buy. Staffs are very gentle and cooperative. 
Coming to the food part.  Almost all the segments of the menu is filled with something that will grab the attention of your taste buds. Dahi chicken with roti in the meal section is good. Mud special chocolate cake is so yummy and Darjeeling green tea is a must try. 
O, they've also a gift corner.

A small cozy cafe located at the corner of triangular park and rashbehari avenue crossing.¬† Visited this cafe last evening to try out some light snacks. As per their recommendation, had hot chocolate, mud special sandwich and caramel pudding. The hot chocolate tasted very yummy. The club special sandwich filled with chicken, mayo, egg tasted very delicious. Somehow the caramel pudding was okish. I would recommend to visit this cafe as the rates are very very reasonable and food quality is too good. The staffs are courteous too..

I visited this place long ago and instantly fel in love with it... The ambience and the food everything was sooo nice... A pocket friendly and cozy place for a perfect Bangali "adda"... It reflects bangaliyana everywhere.. The decor itself is so simple yet classy.. And the staff was so helpful and humble.. We ordered mud sandwich, kitkat shake, blue lagoon, chicken Hawaiian salad and one chicken combo meal and all of this cost us around 600rs or something... for 3people is was enough and we spent almost 3hours there gossiping without any disturbance... I would love to visit this place again and will highly recommend it if you are finding a cozy place to hangout..üôå

If you are the kind of person who enjoys quaint places to chill this is the one for you..Located near rashbehari avenue the house once was the residence of ace rabindrasangeet singer Debabrata Biswas.Its one of the eco friendly cafe you will love to visit. With rabindrasangeet playing in the background you can taste some authentic bangali khabar out here..The mangsher ghugni is a must try.The mud sandwich is a real tummy filler.The pricing is decent.A must try for all!

It was a surprise visit for my father who admires Debabrata Biswas a lot. This cafe is actually inside his house, with his photograph, posters all around and playing rabindrasangeet sang by him in low volume. This place makes my father nostalgic and both my parents enjoyed the place a lot. It has two floor, hardly accommodate 22-24 people all together. Coming to the food, we have tried roomali roti with dahi chicken, roomali roti with chicken kosha, grilled mud sandwich, Darjeeling tea and lemon honey tea. Both the dahi chicken and chicken kosha were excellent and perfect with soft fresh roomali roti. Sandwich was neither extraordinary nor bad, quite filling, serves with potato chips and two dips (tomato sauce and mustard sauce). Now the best part is tea with which cookies come complementary. Both honey lemon tea and Darjeeling tea were extremely flavoured and I just come to this cafe only for tea now. The menu of zomato is a bit backdated as they have increased the price recently. The service was quite good but a little bit slow which is perfectly all right for many of us. The behaviour of the stuffs are genuinely good. Although the place is full of young crowd but I strongly believe our generation should take our parents and grand parents in this particular cafe, it will make them nostalgic. The pocket pinch is not much high as all the prices include tax here. For 3 of us , our pocket pinch was Rs650 which we feel completely worthy.

This quaint cafe is not very hard to locate as it is on the main road opposite to City Style (Triangular Park).
A very narrow walled entrance decorated with lights and posters. This place has it's own charm of "bangaliyana" with earthly decors and extremely homely ambiance. The harmony and aesthetics of this cafe is maintained with slow Rabindra Sangeet playing in the background along with (dim) lamp lights.
This was my second visit, yet again it took them ages to serve two hot chocolates even when there were limited customers., which was a little diappointing. Will always recommend everyone to rush for their special mutton ghugni and the chocolate mud pie.

I went to MUD with two of my best friends after a very long day with elephants running inside our tummies. The decor and the ambience itself made us feel relaxed. Now,the food. We took the chicken pasta in white sauce and it was quite good if not sonething extraordinary. They serve really good quality fish and chips although i wish the quantity was a little more.Finally,we took the dahi chicken and rumali roti meal which was out of the world. It was just perfect. All these came for less than 500 rupees. 
All in all it was a really good experience going to MUD.

Ambiance: Being the abode once, of the legend , Debabrata Biswas, the place carries a different enigma of its own. A quaint cafe that is beautifully decorated in handicrafts adding the homely feel is what made us drawn to this place. 

Location : Triangular Park. Exactly opposite to the City Style Mall. 

Food : We had ordered the dishes that we found were most preferred in the reviews, most of which really impressed us. 
The pick from the menu were ~

* KitKat Shake : I did not like this much. It tasted more like a regular health drink. It tasted pretty bland and had no flavour of the KitKat at all. 

* Oreo Shake : One sip of this and I was blown. The rich taste of Oreo could easily be understood and the milk and ice were perfectly balanced. 

* Mutton Ghugni : This dish tasted good but wasn't anything extraordinary. It's served in a dish made out of the dried bark of beetlenut tree, which was really nice. It comes with a side of a slice of lemon, freshly chopped onions, coriander and green chilies. 

*Chicken Tikka Sandwich : This club sandwich comes topped with wafers and two dips - mustard and ketchup. As suggested they made it a bit spicy and it tasted really good. 

*Egg and mayo Sandwich : This too comes with wafers and two dips. Hard boiled eggs cut into rings and generously mixed with mayo is used as stuffing in this sandwich. This was the show stealer. It tasted so well that we ended up ordering two more plates of the same.

*Chocolate MUD cake: A rich, chocolaty, gooey cake . A perfect way to call it a day. 

Overall , it was a delightful experience . The best part being, not only are they reasonably priced but also they add no taxes. Would definitely go in again sometime.

A beautiful homely ambience, the songs of Debabrata Biswas makes this place so out of the box.The place is cozy and the decor is essentially Bengali. I paid a visit to the place as it was strongly recommended by many. I tried their hot chocolate and it did refresh me. The moment I uploaded the picture, more food suggestions poured me. Thus a revisit is on cards.

The cafe is unique in it's own special way. Homely decor, touch of "Bangaliana" everywhere. The soft soothing Rabindra sangeet was adding to the charm.Triangular Park stoppage, opposite to City Style, beside Leather World is MUD cafe.
The hospitality was warm. Staff were courteous.
Food Ordered: rumali roti, chicken kosa( 2 legs pc), chocolate Mousse, Cappuccino.
Extremely nice environment and pocket friendly.The food served were even up to the mark..
Overall, a very nice experience. A good food journey.

Okay so had been there yesterday with a friend, after wandering for about 15 minutes we could finally locate the cafe. As they were celebrating the valentine's week so the entire cafe was decorated with heart shaped ballons and they were also offering the special meal but it was only available from 12 to 3, hence we missed it, but, the meal on offer was really good. Now coming to the ambience, the cafe has a really warm ambience but they could have worked on the interiors a little better. But, it has the touch of old adda zones of kolkata. Now the food, we were not really very satisfied with the food actually. We had ordered a mexican cheese sandwich and chocolate mouse(large), however, since the large one was not available we had to settle for the small one. But, on the arrival of the food we were disappointed as the quantity of the food could not lift up to its price. There are no complaints on the quality of the food, the food was really tasty, but the quantity is not good. Even the size of the mouse was really small. I personally feel the mouse by mio amor√® is much bigger than this one at a cheaper rate. Also they had made 4 pieces of the sandwich but it became really small pieces. So in a whole I feel that is not as good as its price!

Location : Bang on opposite to city style mall,just beside the Manyavar outlet at triangular park.
Ambience : This is the USP of this caf√® - warm lighting,elegant interior and Debabrata Biswas's songs in the backdrop takes the soothing factor up by several notches.
Food : We ordered corn and cheese burst sandwich - which was perfectly grilled with a generous filling of sweet corn and melted cheese served with american cream and onion lays and tomato ketchup-kasundi.
Coming to the second dish - walnut brownie with ice cream - it was freshly baked and served.The smell won over the heart and the every bite was heavenly üòç
MUD caf√© is your place to drop in if you're looking for a pocket friendly classy caf√© to sit and chill.
The staffs are very well behaved.
Certainly going back time and again.

Tucked inside the lanes of Hindustan Park bang opposite to Citi style,  this place is surely one of the best and pocket friendly eateries in town. The two storied building of Late Shri. Debabrata Biswas' house MUD surely has the essence of bangaliyana and a good taste of Rabindra Sangeet. 
The staffs are courteous and are very well aware of the menu. The ground floor and the first floor together can accommodate around 20-25 people and the second floor is named as Mritika which is kept for parties.  This place also has poteries bookmarks earrings bags and some books for sale too.  
Coming to the food, we had chicken cheese and mayo sandwich which tasted pretty good however, the chocolate milk shake tasted more like a cup of bournvita and the mud chocolate cake was too good.

Ideal place to hang out with friends. Mud special sandwich is mouth watering. They prepare lovely Mud special Kolkata mojito which basically is a gondhoraj lebu sherbert with basil leaves. Both their walnut brownie with ice cream and mud cake are must try. Along with the stomach it soothes the ears too as they play old Bengali songs and rabindrasangeet.

The place has 'bangaliyana' ingrained in it. I ordered the 'Fish & Chips' on the menu, expecting at least something close to the real thing. But what I was served was nothing but Fish Cutlet and French Fries. That was really disappointing. Unlike other cafes, they don't bother you with ordering fast. You can sit down, talk, all in peace, nobody's going to bother you. It has a very welcoming laid-back ambience.

A bit difficult to spot, but getting a table in the evening even on a weekday could be quite difficult. It was a sudden plan after office and we landed in MUD. The fact that it used to be Debobrata Biswas's home resonates from every corner of the cafe from the decor to the music. Lovely, relaxed and peaceful ambiance. We ordered two Irish Coffee, one Latte and one cold coffee with ice cream along with Grilled Mexican Sandwich and Chicken Pasta in white sauce. Coffee was good and so was the sandwich. But somehow I felt the pasta was way below the average. Service is ok, and the good part is they receive you with smile and gives you ample time to settle down, eat and chat with your group, unlike many other cafes. Overall it was a good experience, and would recommend this place to give it a try. A little upgradation in the taste sector would be great though. Definitely would visit again to check out the 1st floor.

Been here to freshening my mind and walk out successfully. Situated just opposite city style near triangular park. I suggest to use Google maps like me cause location is quite tricky. A beautifully designed and decorated caf√©. A classy caf√© look is given. Ambience was really good and so as hospitality. Lovely environment with decent and friendly staff amazing combination. Service in reasonable time mostly. Presentation was Nice and price was pocket friendly. I tried their filter coffee it tastes amazingly good. A must try place. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

Located at the opposite side of city style (gariahat) just beside Manyavar this cafe can be a bit tricky to locate if you are not cautious enough. Went here for the first time but I am just in absolute love with the decor of this place. They have some how managed to  produce a perfect blend of Bengali emotion culture with that of the vibe of a perfect cafe. The decor were absolutely classy and simple. 5/5 for the decor. Kudos for the selection

It is a budget friendly cafe where you can try delicious dishes that wont make a big dent in your pocket. Very reasonable for college/ school students. 

The staff were very friendly and they catered to every need of the customer as  soon it was possible. They even tried to make the seats available to the customers for which ever seats they were requested for. The food were also served within a very reasonable time limit. 4.5/5 for service.

Now coming to the food. I went with one of my friends and ordered 1 oreo shake, 1 cold coffee and 1 grilled mud special sandwich. The coffee and the shake were absolutely delicious. The coffee specially was not to sweet and had the actual intoxicating flavour of coffee. The sandwich was also good but a bit dry. So 4/5 for food.

All in all it was a pocket friendly resturant with good food so i am giving it a 4.5 rating.
Hoping to visit again. Please everyone just give it a try.!!!!!

Grateful to my college buddies for introducing me to this amazing place with amazing food and ambience,bonus point being the low pocket pinch. This is located opposite to City style, Triangular park, beside Manyavar and can be little tough to spot.The interior is very cosy, adorned with books of Ranjan Bandapadhyay, pictures of Debabrata Biswas, lamps, mugs and other stuff for sale. So while waiting for your order to get served, you won't get bored. The unique feature of this cafe is that it plays Rabindrasangeet incessantly recorded by Debabrata Biswas which was very much appreciated by my parents. The quintessential Bengali laidback atmosphere complete with Tagore songs is what makes it different from the other cafes so that it instantly becomes closer to the heart. Whenever we go, we prefer sitting on the 1st floor and they have a bell to summon the staff and the service is prompt. Coming to the food, we loved the mud sandwich which has all good things stuffed in it. Next mention will be of dahi chicken and rumali roti. The first reaction that came out of us on tasting the chicken is that "this tastes like home!" We loved the light, palatable dish. Chicken kosha with rumali also tasted great. Last but not the least, the mud cake is the one I drool on and if you live and die for chocolate you should definitely try that for heavenly pleasure. The cake isn't compact like the choco lava cake of Dominos and looks rather messy and gooey with crust bordering it but I don't mind as long as it tastes good and boy it does! Surely gonna come back for more.

Mud is located beside Manyavar showroom of triangular park. 
They have 3 floors for seating arrangements. Service is very fast. 

We occupied second floor because ground floor was full of people..

We ordered Chicken tikka sandwich and corn and cheese sandwich with chicken and cheese omelette.

Those were very tasty. 

We ordered their Kolkata mojito but it was very bad.. Temperature was normal. Taste was not like any mojito we had earlier.

With a true Bengali feel , mud is located in triangular park just beside manyavar showroom opposite city style . Once you get there you will get that good vibe , the old room charm with ' rabindra sangeet ' played in the background adding different level of elegance to it. We ordered their grilled mud sandwich , kitkat shake , mutton phuchka and chocolate mud cake  . Without exaggerating a bit I must say they make the best sandwich in town. Kitkat shake was nevertheless not that good. Again mutton phuchka was innovative and yum . Now coming to chocolate mud cake  , it was splendid . Loaded with chocolate , we were literally fighting to get a bigger piece. And this place is very cheap. A must go !

I checked in there with my UG girls. At first it was really cumbersome on our behalf in searching the outlet. But somehow we managed to find it. Coming straight now- the staff's behaviour was extremely friendly, the food was yummm but the French fries were disappointing as it was really less in terms of quantity. Otherwise the decor n the sitting arrangements felt as if you are exactly in ur drawing room. Rabindra Sangeet was being played in the background which was voiced by the owner of the CAFE himself. Within the nutshell I really loved the entire ambience.

Gist : Great decor , heartfelt service, good food, highly overpriced w.r.t. quantity.

I visited this place on 23.12.16 around 8.30PM. Easy to locate. Nice decor with old bengali songs playing in the background. Even floor is cover with wicker mat. Seating available in ground +2 floor where in 2nd floor they have lounge. Ground floor can accommodate 15 persons. Washroom is spacious but for single person (male or female). Service was fast and very cordial. Tried winter combo. Sandwich was good, first time tasted  mousse and tasted good. Coffee and French fries tasted as they taste in any place. So with that price this place can only survive if they have some foods which have signature taste. Otherwise no point spending that much money for coffee, fries, sandwiches in a cafe; all can be made at home easily Or you can try same at lower price or better quality / quantity at any other cafe. Will visit of price is reduced to half of current price at least.

Mud is in short a perfect cafe.
Right from location, ambience to staffs, food, hospitality everything is in top notch.
The light bengali music playing in the background, soothes the nerves, along with some chai.
I loved the cheese sandwich and ended up having three plates of it!!
The kitkat and oreo shakes are simply delicious.
And rumali ruti, dahi chicken is a classic combo done with complete excellence.
I'll definitely visit again.

I had often believed that 'word of the mouth' publicity is the best publicity. And hence I urged my friends to come over to MUD caf√©, which has been creating quite a buzz in the Gariahat area caf√© scene.
But I am sorry to say that I was disappointed. The food is however of an average quality but the quantity! It was no where close to what we had in mind.
The caf√© is spacious since it is a house turned into a caf√©. The interiors are done keeping the Bengali folklore in mind. The retro Bengali songs that play from the archives are really soothing to the ears.
But I would say it is a pretty average place and definitely not more than a one time visit for me.
The service was good though.
p.s. Please improve the quantity of your dishes, if you want to retain the hype that is there for sometime.

The quintessential bengali will never compromise on his daily dose of adda, his appreciation for Rabindra Sangeet or his undying love for a good debate on Parshe and Ilish. Amongst all the hustle and bustle, Calcutta will find itself unwinding at the end of the day at various nooks and corners of the city. It is as much a talker's city as a walker's. Be it the parar thek, the chai stall at the corner of the street, a good game of football or the modern day homely caf√©s. From intellectual professors to the bookworm college girl in fat framed glasses, you'll find it all at places like these. 
Tucked away inside a small lane next to Triangular Park, Mud is the perfect excuse to indulge in emphatic conversations over a hot cup of coffee.

A cold Sunday evening made it almost mandatory for me to order a cup of hot chocolate. I wasn't too happy to find it half empty.They served it with a couple of cookies. The chicken and cheese sandwich was nice and neatly served. Good ambience and courteous staff were definitely plus points though. 
Affordable prices too. 

A good experience but better quantity would perhaps raise the bar higher.

The ambiance of MUD cafe draws you to this place. Situated inside a tiny lane right opposite City Style, this place normally misses your eye. However they now have a flex right outside pointing you to the cafe.

I really enjoy their MUD sandwich and pudding. The coffee is a little weak tasting. They have interesting open mics and intimate theatre acts at times, which only adds to the beauty of this quaint place. Also they have a buzzer upstairs which can be used to buzz the staff downstairs. Bangali as well as cool, a double win.

P.S-Do not play with the buzzer or they take it away.

Well, located near deshapriya park we spotted the place after we were done with our shopping. This place is a mini "Nostalgic Calcutta".
A beautifully decorated and authentic Bengali drawing-room like ambiance..with mild music well lit this place got into my must visit again list. Talking about the food, we ordered Hawaiian salad, white sauce chicken pasta and hot chocolate and all of that was up to the mark, you won't have to find for chicken in any of those dishes as they were in plenty for the price. Gonna visit again sometime üòâ

I had gone here for the first time and I tried the Ceasar salad, the Irish coffee and mousse. Irish coffee was good but Ceasar salad was OK. I find the price high for the quantity of it and the quality is moderate too.
Ambience of the place had been set up truly considering the intellectual Bengali society and the Rabindranath Tagore songs are like the icing on the cafe.
Non Bengalis might find it different than the usual cafes and the essence of the place is clay arts.
It has two floors and is quite spacious since its a house turned to cafe.
It is a good hangout for friends strictly and oh yes Bengalis will love it.
Honestly I find the place just average and a one time visit place.

It is such a lovely little cafe situated amidst the busy environment of Gariahat, just opposite to the City style showroom beside triangular park. After visting I wonder why I haven't visited this place earlier. Today finally got opportunity to visit this place with my bestie for spending some quality time along with tasty foods. We preferred to sit on the 1st floor and the room was beautifully decorated. The peaceful ambiance is just perfect for adda session with near and dear ones and must say that the background music played is just the cherry on the cake. Coming to the food we ordered mud special grilled sandwich, chicken and cheese omlet along with kolkata mojito and chocolate mousse. The sandwich was delicious with perfect balance of mayo, chicken and egg served with chips and sauce. The omlet was innovative stuffed with ample of chickens. Though i have tasted this kind of dish for the very first time, it seemed equally yummy. Personally i didn't like the kolkata mojito that much because of the smelling of the herbs was quite seemed like medicinal taste. The dessert we chose was chocolate mousse which was served in a cute little heart shaped dish and we just loved every spoon of it. The bill came only 375 Rs. We spent a very nice time together and the overall experience was refreshing. I would love to come back to this cafe again and again. üòä

Mud is my favourite joint to unwind after a hectic day at office . their ambience , food quality and service are extra ordinary . soothing rabindrasangeet at the background with a cup of coffee and chicken mustard sandwich is what I need to relax . full marks .

Today i visited this place...  Ambiance  is more over retro type....  But the fooding is not soo yummy...  The fish with chips was good..  But mud cake was just an ordinary  browine which is not cooked properly...  Veg pasta was just tasteless..  And moreover the quantity  of the food is not equal  to the price charged...  Price is too high..

I didn't quite like d ambience & I don't think everyone is retro freak! So I didn't like d background music, it was too dull. Talking about d food, I had chocolate mousse cake which was so so. My friends had chicken pasta which I felt not so tasty, sandwiches had chicken too much raw could've fried a bit, didn't even have cheese in it. Only thing I liked w.r.t other dishes was dahi chicken wid roomali rooti though it didn't look like roomali rooti. Overall it wasn't a nice experience! Please try to improve d quality.

This new place MUD have created much hype in the caf√© scene of Gariahat area. A perfect quaint cafe to hang out with your friends over a cuppa and some good ambience. This place is located just next to the Mohey showroom near Triangular Park and is pretty easy to locate.
It's a two storied place with a gift shop on the first floor. The couches are comfy and lovely and the place is decorated with movie posters of Bangla classic films and there are books for sale as well. You can seriously have a great adda with your friends as I had with my bestie

Read a lotta good reviews bout this place. Was planning to visit for a long time. Managed to do so on a lonely Sunday. The joint is conveniently located at triangular park just opposite to Citi Style. But finding it is as difficult as finding platfirm 9 3/4 at King's Cross station. The entrance is so small that it seems to be hidden in plain sight. Jokes aside, once u enter the place u will find the hospitality damn amazing. The place is small & neat. We went to 1st floor. It is a simple residential building designed to look like an ethnic restaurant. The Tagore influence is vivid in every corner. Although the name exudes a modern western vibe, this place is anything but that..the name ‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ suits them better. But the types of delicacies they are offering are quite western and boy o boy, the food quality is wonderful..we ordered a few items and found each item to have an unique taste. Did I mention about the hospitality? Yup I did, but this requires special mention. The price is quite reasonable in today's market. Oh! They have a library upstairs, feel free to visit. Yup, the name should have been ‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ‡•§
Pros:
1. Hospitality.
2. Location.
3. Food quality.

Cons:
1. Hidden physical positioning.
2. Confusing brand positioning.

A lovely cafe located near triangular park. Very well decorated. Im so in love with the interiors. Every single detail taken care of. We ordered cheese corn burst sandwich , kitkat shake and walnut brownie with ice cream. Food is very good..nothing exceptional about the sandwich , tastes fresh and yum. Kitkat shake was totally taste bud relishing. Coming to the walnut brownie, it was my favourite . Hot brownie and ice cream be the best combo. And the best part ? The menu shows the price which is tax included.

Mud is a cozy little cafe near to Triangular Park. The cafe is tastefully decorated with local handicrafts and furniture. They play melodious strains of Rabinra Sangeet, as background music. A good place for hangout with friends and relatives, the pocket pinch will be not too cheap nor too expensive. They have their own craft corner. Regarding food the quality, quantity will totally worth the price and taste bud. Will love to come back again and again.

Small, cozy cafe with bengali culture inspired decor. Polite staff, good service and good food. I have visited it twice with different sets of friends and had a wonderful experience both the times. Veg pasta and sandwiches are good but i found the hawaiaan salad a bit "phika" . Oreo shake was yum too but the thing that stole my heart was the chocolate "mud" cake. If you ever visit this cafe, this signature cake is a must try. Although the entrance is a bit tricky for the first timers but once u get a taste of this cafe, jus one time will never be enough.

I'm not being biased and also not being over excited but MUD - YOU'VE stolen my heart!! I'm giving this review a little late because I have visited this place 5-6 times already.. I still wonder how do you create such an awesome environment.. I'm an ardent fan of the mud sandwich n cold coffee with ice cream.. Irish coffee also excels. Chicken n cheese omlet, fish n chips n masala French fries but none of them disappointed me. 

For those who want to know : it is located in triangular park, rashbehari Avenue, besides manyabar shop.

Advice : little lack of space but good enough to make you comfortable..!

A veritable haven of culinary delight, the place is tucked away in an oasis of tranquility, far away from the madding crowd of Rash Behari Avenue. One fine evening as I walked in with my colleagues  the thing that  struck me most was its magical ambience. Soulful numbers multiplied with aromatic flavours wafted in the house  dotted with beauiful paintings, handpicked clay pots, bags, jewellery,  books and CDs displayed spendidly and up for sale. We sampled some grilled sandwiches, crispy cookies, home made fish chops, chocolate mousse and washed it down with  flavoured tea. The dahi chicken-roomali roti they make is delightful and a must-have. One can sit here in the well lit and tastefully remodelled house of the legendary singer  Georgeda and have cup of smoking hot coffee and wonder how much history and what discussions this humble place must have witnessed.

Excellent is just the exact word to describe this food joint. The place is located in the opposite foot of city style, beside Manyavar. The place is one of those old heritage buildings. It has got sitting arrangements both upstairs and downstairs. Loved the interior decoration. The place looked gorgeous with classic bengali literature books arranged. We ordered Mud special grilled sandwich and oreo shake. Both of them tasted heavenly. The only minus point of this place is that the service is not that prompt. Like we had to go downstairs twice to ask them to take the order or give us the bill.

I love their Mud chicken Sandwich, fish finger and brownie. Their range of Tea and coffee are also quite good. The handmade clay potteries and handmade herbal wellness care range makes the name MUD more meaningful. Overall ambiance and food is very good. The staffs are very polite and friendly.

MUD cafe , located in the Hindustan Park area, is a two floored cafe with a Bengali ambience. It's like the old coffee houses of Calcutta where people come for a sip of tea and a fish cutlet for a side. The interiors are pretty, with cane furniture and clay pots on display, much like the name of the cafe. There are Bengali books and music cds too for people to check out. We had the peach ice tea, the green apple ice tea, fish chop, paneer sandwich, Hawaiian salad, red sauce pasta and French fries. I particularly liked the fish chop, as it was tender and well seasoned. The salad was not truly a salad due to only mayonnaise as it's dressing; the drinks were both good, the paneer sandwich was also well made. The paneer cubes were very soft. Each of the appetisers was served with tomato and mustard sauce in the same dipping bowl. I think that can be changed. Even the pasta, seemed as though it had been cooked only in the store bought tomato sauce. It lacked authenticity. There was also too much of oregano which gave a bitter aftertaste. 
The MUD cafe has a nice and cozy feel to it and is a wonderful place to spend an evening with friends or all by yourself. However, if they pay just a little more attention to food , it will also become a good place to snack in.

The service was a bit slow considering the items that we had ordered for. 
We had ordered for a hot chocolate and a mud chocolate brownie. Both the items were good though not great. 
I loved the way it was served. 
Thumbs up to this place. Will visit soon to try out some more dishes.

The din and bustle of Gariahat slips away as you step into Mud.The soft tones of Debabrata Biswas 's Rabindrasangeet greet you as you make yourself comfortable.The overwhelming impression that you receive is one of quiet good taste.
Friendly young men serve you food that has all the flavours of home cooked delicacies.Whether you bite into a grilled sandwich, devour the fish chops, savour the delectable mango or chocolate mousse and wash it down with fragrant Darjeeling tea,it will all be a treat to remember.If you crave a lunch substitute, you may try Rumali rotis and Kosha Mangsho.If you wish for a Deshi  snack there are bowls of ghugni.All this at a reasonable price, with no strings attached.
The lounge on the second floor,Mrittika, gives you more space, so if you're in a group, that would be ideal.Remember to book in advance.
Mud is a cafe with a difference.It offers books you can read or buy and there are  beautiful pottery and herbal creams for sale.
Experience Mud.

Situated near triangular park in gariahat,I went there last sunday around 3pm to find the place almost empty. The interior was nice, decorated with books and small artefacts. We ordered a chicken and cheese omlette, a chicken burger and a pina colada. The omlette was full of cheese, yum! The burger was also good and the mocktail was also good. Prices are reasonable and no extra tax was levied. I liked the place. :)

Visited this cafe on a Sunday evening...though it was a bit tough to find out but the food made us so happy that everything else can be ignored. We have ordered mutton ghugni,chicken mud sandwich,darjeeling tea,fish fingers and chocolate mud cake. Mutton ghugni was the clear winner though when we tried to repeat it..it was already out of stock. All the food items were tasty and fresh,maybe that's why there were very few options available. The ambience reminded us a bit of Shantiniketani Adda.

This cute and pretty house turned cafe right opposite city style is a great cafe for having a nice conversation with a friend. The ambiance is calm and pleasing and the music of old Bengali hits fills you with a sense of nostalgia. The food i would say is pretty much home cooked food. Did not enjoy the White sauce pasta though.  But the coffee and beverages are better. Service is friendly. Pocket pinch for two will be around 400 with food and beverage :)

It speaks of bangaliana. The ambience is typical of tradition bangali houses in south calcutta. The interiors which includes the furnitures and show pieces all speak of Bangaliana.

The cafe has soft old bengali music playing in the background which adds to the calm ambience. Makes for a peaceful and mentally refreshing outing.

The food is good value for money. 
We ordered chicken cheese omelette , fish and chips, darjeeling tea, hot chocolate and chocolate mud cake.

The chicken cheese omelette was filled with solid juicy chunks of chicken and loads of cheese which made it a tasty snack. The hot chocolate, unlike other cafes , wasn't milk and Bournvita and hence it tasted absolutely scrumptious. 
We ended with the chocolate mud cake which was sinfully tasty chocolate brownie filled with molten chocolate. 
In short a wonderful experience and plan to come back soon here .

A small place for little bites. It sells some jewellery, accessories etc. More of like a whole some place, a Bong would like to go, for great old classic music, great, peaceful and  A laidback ambience.
Coming to food, had  ordered fish n chips,  chicken pasta. 
The fish and chips, is not what you expect - beer battered fish. But simple fish fry. Though, the coating was great and fish was fresh. 
The fries on the other hand lacked crispness. 
For pasta, we had to wait over 30 mins. We were told, the pasta is yet to be boiled  ( I'm sorry, but this is not accepted) so we cancelled the order. 
Overall, good experience. 
As a suggestion, there should be more options for vegetarians

I wanted to go to this cafe on my visit to Kolkata this time, finally made it one evening. It is an old house turned into a cafe with ground floor, 1st floor and a private sitting area on the 3rd floor. The decor represents typical old kolkata, there are cane chairs and tables to sit, photographs of renowned people of Kolkata are on the wall and you can hear Rabindra sangeet in Hemanta Mukherjee's voice.
Decor: Good, could be better
Service: Good
Food & Quality: Elaborate menu with good food.. Portion too is sufficient
Service: Quick
Revisit: Definitely.

wow... majestic... serene and unique.... just loved the place and the ambience.... a very simple concept which has been really given wings wit great execution.... 
this is a house turned cafe bang opposite to triangular park city style, beside manyavar store on the main road.... the cafe is to be passed through a narrow lane again beautifully and thoughtfully arranged and lit up and then you enter the paradise of bengal.... a two storied cafe conceptualised with bengals cottage crafts,  a touch of kabiguru.... stairs lit with string lights and the furniture again boasted heavily on the bong culture.... shelves with books on sale where the books are signed by the authors... i was pretty awestruck since I entered the place and for the hr i had spend,  it looked like a pretty busy place even on a monday evening irrespective of the great location coz i know better locations which stay empty on such bad days... 
a score of 4 and not 5 since i felt irrespective of the great place and ambience and extremely polite staff,  the food is extremely simple and average/ okayish.... nothing to die for,  i will recommend this place to a lot of people for the ambience and not the food....we ordered a cheese and chicken grilled sandwich which was nicely grilled served wit local potato wafers and had a crunch in the bite but a slightly dry in the inside... fish and chips which was a very thin bengali fish cutlet,  but I think the fish was betki which is rare to find in pocket friendly eateries,  the taste was again average since the fish inside was extremely thin  and also was served with a few french fries,  which i can almost count.... chicken mud balls which were tiny chicken meatballs,  this one was a little dissapointing,  5 pcs and they were dry and rubbery,  cold coffee which was smooth and really good.... there is no tax and the bill was 470...pocket friendly but i would request them to increase the price but make the food a little more filling.... 
overall,  a hidden gem for sure and i am delighted to have visited this place.... food can be an area of improvement and trust me guys,  i think it will have queues outside to get a seat then.... great job and all the very best...

This place is one of those places in the city wer you
can sit have a coffee and have a great conversation...the background music i guess was rabinder sangeet...although i dint paid much of attention to it but it was complementing the ambiance with the sitting style and the store they have...
This place serves one of the best coffee and mud pie among those places i have visited in the recent past...
The menu comprised of an even amount of vegetarian and Non vegetarian snacks...
The staff is well behaved...and are in a sync with each other...
Must be visited if u wanna catch up
 with your friend...everything about this place is almost perfect..

Visited this place on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The place is pretty easy to locate. Just opposite City Style in triangular park area. You'll see a small signboard and a small lane which will lead you to the cafe. The lane, itself is decorated with pictures and quotes depicting Bengal. 

The interior was equally amazing. The lighting, the seating arrangement, the ambience gave a very welcoming feeling. 
And soft Rabindra sangeet being played in the background just added to the Bangaliana feeling. 

The staff was very cooperative and well behaved. 
Coming to the food, we ordered mud sandwich, chocolate mud cake and kit kat shake. 
The mud sandwich was filled with cheese, chicken and boiled eggs and it was properly grilled. Probably the best sandwich you can get at this price. The kit kat shake was pretty ordinary and so was the chocolate mud cake. 

Overall, it's an ideal place to enjoy a laid back evening. (Too bad, was in a hurry so couldn't do justice to this part. Next time, sure. Xoxo)

It is not  always food and ambience of a place that matters ,sometimes the crowed and the behaviour of the staffs that attracts you. Been here and I found the staffs too cordial and cooperative. They are very prompt  and serves  with a big smile on their face. Food is very reasonable and tasty. It's a good joint for snacks and people can spend hours here with good music and adda.  THANKS.

Nice ambience, typical Bangali mood , food was good. Good place for catching up with friends if you are little laid back type and prefer Bangla gaan. I only wished if they had a floor seating arrangement. Also it was bit difficult to find the place since its tucked in the lane beside Manyavar showroom. Overall it was good experience and a safe choice for having an adda session¬† and having good food.

I visit this place regularly (read once a week) and this has become a home sort of place for me. 
I generally sit in the 1st floor, which has soft lights and the music playing along with it gives it a very homely, familiar ambience. 
The service is quick. The waiters are not very professional but they are super helpful, admits the little mistakes and gives everyone equal attention. 
Their coffee and tea are good. Not extraordinary, but pretty good.
I love the grilled sandwiches, burger, French fries, fish fry and definitely the mud cake.
I have just one complain. The table for two are too small to accommodate enough food for two people, also the chairs are too small for grown ups in some tables. May be they can change them someday. I love this place and will recommend it to people who want to spend a good, cozy time with partners and friends. ‚ù§Ô∏è

This review is based only on the staff behavior there and not food. We unfortunately had to leave without eating. 

Hearing great reviews of the place we decided to give it a try and traveled all the way from the northern part of the city, just to visit them. When we reached we found the place full and were asked by a server to wait for 10/15 mins outside. Being a popular place we were ready to wait and stood outside the glass door. Few people arrived after us and after talking with the servers inside, they too started waiting behind us. 

After couple of minutes a young lady and an elderly woman came and went inside. The young lady had a chat with the person who asked us to wait, and he pointed towards a table. There were two people already sitting there and these two women occupied the other two chairs. We thought they were all together. But after a min we saw the two guys who were seating earlier paid and left.

We went inside and told the person that we were already waiting. He started blabbering - Oh, you were there? I didn't know anyone was waiting (the outside can be clearly seen from where he was standing). Will I then ask them to give the table to you?

Already irritated with the quality of service we decided to leave. If they think they will run the cafe with the regular visitors and give them priority over other people who are waiting; then people like us, who prefer visiting multiple places rather than go to the same place everytime, should give this place a miss. Don't want to waste my money for such bad service.

This was a random visit with a friend on a evening.Its a quaint little place beside leather land opposite to city style in triangular park area.It was originally home of legendary Rabindrasangeet singer Debobrata Biswas.

I was mesmerised as I was passing the lane leading to the caf√©.It had posters with sceneries and quotes depicting love for Bengal.The caf√© inside was no different.The decor had touch of Bengali addakhana.The floor mats spread on the floor were Bengali Madur, lamps and chairs were made of madurkathi only,handicrafts from Bengal,paintings of epic Bengali movies on the wall.Lighting of the caf√© was very soothing too.Rabindrasangeet in voice of Debobrata Biswas was played in the background.

The servers were polite and helpful.They made us feel at home.Food was served in plates having wooden look.Things we ordered were

‚Ä¢Chicken tikka sandwich- Here sandwiches are cut into 4 small squares instead of 2 trianglular pieces which actually makes it easier to eat.Its served with potato chips and two types of sauces(ketchup and kasundi).Kasundi had the right amount of pungency in it.The sandwich was so very delicious.It was perfectly grilled and buttery.The filling was spicy which I loved!

‚Ä¢Mutton ghugni-I read a lot about this dish in Bengali novels and short stories especially in Tenida.I was very keen to try this dish.There was no disappointment at all.Ghugni was very tasty with small mutton pieces in it.Onions,chillis,corriander and lemon quarter was given on side to garnish it in accordance with your own tastebuds.

‚Ä¢Mini meal-I actually wanted to try the Peshawari chicken.But only Dahi chicken was available.Hence opted for that only.It came with 3 rumali rotis.The chicken was well cooked in a thick white yogurt flavoured sweet gravy.The chicken was soft and also the rumali rotis were good.
There mini meals are really good options for a budget yet stomach filling meal.

‚Ä¢Chocolate Mud Cake-For a sweet ending we chose the signature dessert of Mud cafe.Its a choco lava cake which is much better than the ones we have at dominos.The cake was so soft with a gooey centre filled with molten dark chocolate.It was so amazing,every mouthful of this cake was sinful indulgence.I can't describe much in words how good it was.

They also sell cute bookmarks and there's also a store upstairs which I didn't check.Got a bookmark for myself. I'll surely visit this place many more times in future for adda sessions with friends over really good food. It's one of my favourite caf√© already. üòä

The ambience is good... but the service is disgusting. People here don't serve oregano and chilly flakes.. when asked they said whether chilly flake was some kinda sauce. Each order takes around 45 minutes. And people here are liars. Even they take 10 minutes to bring a spoon and fork. Guys please never turn up here.

On the day of dashami after pandal hopping for sometime with my cousin bros as we were walking through the rashbehari avenue we saw this place and decided to drop in. The seating arrangement was on the ground floor as well as on the first floor. We went and sat on the first floor. The decor was nice, soothing and calm,somehow to me the ambience felt like it represented the theme of Bengali adda. There were books from famous Bengali authors kept on the shelves which were for sale and some old Bengali tracks were being played in the background. Coming to the food, we ordered two chicken pastas in white sauce and a Mexican burger and as there were no desserts available(which was so sad üò¢) we ordered three pina coladas. The dishes were nothing extraordinary but tasted good. The pastas were loaded with chicken and the one who ate the burger said that it was also tasty but the mayonnaise was less. The drinks (pina coladas) were very refreshing and somehow tasted like fruit cakesüòã. We had a nice experience over there it is a perfect place to have good food and chitchat with family or friends or with your partner. The behaviour of the staff is also good. No cons spotted for this cafe. It is worth a visit. Oh! And also it is very affordable.

Located just beside leather world in triangular park this is one of the best hangout places in south kolkata.The food is quite good,priced decently.The staff is very good.We ordered grilled mud sandwich, chicken Hawaiian salad and a cappuccino.Grilled mud sandwich was very filling and the taste was pretty amazing.I was surprised to see that they gave a cookie with the cappucino which is not offered by any other cafe(at least I know of).Moreover u get to see the house of renowned rabindrasangeet artiste Debobroto Biswas üòä

Located at a prime location¬† near Triangular park, dis cafe is a perfect elixer for the ones who loves to enjoy the peacefull ambience, playing debabrata biswas's rabindrasangeet adds a feathr on the cap to ths cafe n ths surely enhances the serenity of the cafe ambience. Coming to food now, their fish n chips , mud sanwch , hawaiian salad & CHOCO MUD Cake are the must havs.. Staffs thr are vry much cordial n coordinating too..

Visited last puja (2015) . Hard time locating it. It is placed inside a narrow alley, kind of invisible from the sidewalk as well. But once we settled in there, it was a place with the ambience to fall in love with. 
We went for finger food, basically quenchers and a sandwich. They initially served us a masala cold drink which tasted like normal cold drink. Then  they replaced it anyway. 
But the food it light, tasty and worth for money. 
A kiosk like place, still has the capacity of a cosy adda with friends or a jam up! 
Will visit again! Cheers.

Today I had a meeting planned at Mud cafe. I have never been there, neither have seen it. The cafe was quite difficult to find as it was inside a small alley. Still we managed to find it.
The interior was very positive, strong and nostalgic. Old bengali music was playing and there were many books and cassettes of famous people all arpund the room.
We went to first floor and it was air-conditioned with free wifi too‚ù§. The staff were VERY POLITE. They had the best behavior and attended us immediately. They arranged some spare chair. They were really nice to us. We ordered 2 Oreo shake , 4 cappucinos, a black tea, 2 chicken and mayo sandwich(grilled). They sandwich was yummy and filling as well. It was freshly made and was very reasonable. The ambience was great. The staff did not bother us at all. We sat for maybe 2 hours, they did not say anything. They were friendly all the time we were their. We paid our bill and left and i wish to go there more often! :D

I loved loved and loved this joint. My friend and I had ordered Pasta in white sauce, Chicken Balls(Puja special), Mud cake and Lemon tea with honey. The Pasta was filling and had ample chicken, the chicken balls had just the right amount of spice and were succulent, the mud cake was chocolatey and gooey and sinful( !) and the lemon tea came with a cookie;the tea was refreshing.
The cafe is the residence of the famed Rabindrasangeet singer Debabrata Biswas. The background music was soothing and a welcome change from the usual Hindi or English songs. It is spacious and the wicker chairs are really comfy. The place has enough of space. The service was quick and fast. People out here are really polite.¬†
We won a dualfie contest! A book was given to us, Thakurbarir GoponKatha.
Thank you!

Mud follows the trend of the spate of cafes and restaurants that are burgeoning in the residential buildings! This time the house in question is that of the legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent George Biswas! Hence, his mellifluous voice hovers the cafe and culminates to a profound ambience. The decor exudes cozy and relaxed vibes. The cuo at display, souvenirs and jewelleries for sale are interesting incorporations. Now coming over to the food I swore by egg and mayo sandwich and house special Gandhoraj serbet. The Gandhoraj serbet was pretty ordinary but the sandwich was value for money. Would be visiting this place again!

Claimed to be reflecting the Bengali culture, though not really, this two storied little place is sandwiched between shops in the bustling street opposite to CityStyle,Gariahat.
The cafe milieu is mediocre.Didn't understand the significance of the nomenclature because there's no significant pottery in the decor.The sitting arrangements are pretty with cane chairs.The Rabindrasangeet in the backdrop doesn't contribute much to the Bengali touch.But the service and the waiters are worthy of every mention.Very patient, polite and absolutely well mannered staff.
Orders- Mud sandwich,tea,french fries.
Quality- The MUD sandwich comes with egg,chicken,cheese filling. Tasty and very heavy for a single individual. Best is to share a sandwich between two.Thankfully the tea didn't come with tea bag,instead it came with tea leaves,trapped within a steel sieve.The flavour of the tea was nicely captured. We enjoyed it.There's nothing to mention of the french fries that are actually the frozen ones deep fried in oil.Didn't enjoy these much,just munched on.
Summary- Mediocre ambience,good sandwich,amazing staff.Won't like to go back again if I have a chance to explore other new cafes.

I was planning to visit this place since long ago and today I finally got to visit this place. The cafe is beautifully decorated like a classy living room which one will encounter on visiting elegant Bengali families. Beautiful rabindrasangeet was being played in the background. The cafe had a homely and warm atmosphere. The staffs are very helpful and nice.
We had ordered one mud special grilled sandwich, mud Kolkata special mojito, fish and chips.
The best part of the food was that all of them were fresh and felt like it was homemade (or you may say mom made). The sandwich had egg,chicken and mayo in it. The mojito had a distinct flavour of gondhoraj lemon. The fish fry was tasty and was served with French fries, mayo, ketchup and kasundi.
The price is reasonable.
Will visit this place often.

Price is reasonable but the quantity is small... Otherwise it's a nice place to have a talk with your friends and family... Service is quick... I have tried the peach passion and Mexican sandwich... Maybe it was a wrong choice for me cause I didn't like it

I have never seen a place which captures the essence of bongness better than MUD. Even the songs would take you in a different era all together. Starting with blue lagoon and fish chop is a great option. The chicken pasta is great and the quantity wouldn't disappoint either. The club MUD sandwich is really heavy and delicious. Just to top this all the MUD cake is the last nail in the coffin. The service could improve leaps and bounds.

A place you need to visit when you need some time to spend with your love. This place have a antique touch in it. It's decorated very well with floors covered with mats. The table ware are made of mud. It's decorated with only hand craft materials. Must pay a visit.

This cute heritage home styled cafe is a pleasant and welcome change in the buzzing streets of Rashbihari. The Rabindrasangeet played in the background is calming and transports you into the golden era of Bengal. Few neatly done up wooden table and chairs with an open kitchen gives you the rustic feel. Going on to the food without further jibber jabber.

The MUD spl. Grilled sandwich-
If you're here, you cannot leave without trying the grilled sandwich which is generously stuffed with chicken, egg and mayo between three slices of toasted bread. Served with ketchup and my fav kasundi. This dish reminds you of your mother's cooking. This you wouldn't want to share with anyone.

Hawaiian chicken salad-
Such a beautifully done up dish with all the flavours of Hawaii: Chicken, tons of mayo, yellow green and red bell peppers, pineapples and topped with coconut. This salad is served with two pav buns. Its fresh, cold and filling. 

MUD spl. Mutton ghoogni-
A little bowl of ghoogni with finely minced mutton. Perfectly loaded with spices and filled with warmth.

On my earlier visit we had tried the Mutton putchkas which was tangy and crunchy and loaded with flavour. Also, a must order.

My second time here. And this cafe draws me with its simplicity and food. Prices are reasonable. One can come here and unwind after a long day. Highly recommended place.

The ambience is totally unusual and very pleasant. The grilled mud sandwich was very nice. The chicken Hawaiian salad was not upto the mark.  The Mexican chicken sandwich was also good. The chicken and mayo sandwich was so so. The fish fingers and french fries was also good. The rumali roti with chicken kassa was also quite good. The Darjeeling tea was pretty good. The cold coffee was so so. The Oreo shake and KitKat shake was good. The walnut brownie with ice cream was very good. The chicken mud balls was not upto the mark. The cold drinks served was not all cold.

Visited Mud last Sunday to pass some quality time with self. Listened to Rabindra sangeet while sitting alone at this small joint of Rasbehari-Gariahat connector. Drizzling outside, the chaos of Gariahat seemed like a faint reality from up there. 

The food was good. Ordered a Mud special sandwich, with chicken, egg and mayonese. The price tag of Rs. 140/- looked like a tad bit higher side. 

However, half an hour of peace. After a long time. Would return here sometime soon to taste some other items. 

Recommended.

I've been planning to visit this place for a long time. Finally my wish was fulfilled.

The location is very simple - exactly opposite to Citi Style.

Coming to the place, it was evident that this cafe is actually a part of an old and traditional house. The way they've revamped the whole place is such a delight. This place has an old world charm about it which will make you feel really good.

This place is divided into 2 sections - we sat in the second floor.
The d√©cor is minimalistic, and the music is going to transport you to a bygone era.

Now coming to the food. We ordered -

*Drinks*
‚Ä¢ Special Mojito - tangy and refreshing.
‚Ä¢ Oreo shake - an absolute delight for an Oreo lover like me. It was a lot like chocolate milkshake, with Oreo instead of chocolate, with broken Oreo served on top.

*Food*
‚Ä¢ MUD grilled sandwich - I'm not really fond of sandwiches, but this one was really appetizing and yummy. Served with potato chips and sauce.
‚Ä¢ Greek salad - I always think salads are a waste of money because there's more of lettuce and veggies and less chicken. However, this salad was completely different. It only had veggies, that too, the ones I like - bell peppers, tomato and cucumber. It was tossed in olive oil, and that lent a special aroma to the salad. And it had a huge amount of chicken keema. Like seriously a lot!
‚Ä¢ Chicken pasta in red sauce - the quantity was wow! And so was the taste. At 130 bucks, this is such a bomb. Amazing taste and a great amount of cheese and chicken made this a winner!

Pocket pinch - 500! Very reasonable.

The service is prompt, and the staff was very well behaved. A very warm experience.
I'm surely gonna be back here.

Mud cafe is located just opposite to the city style in triangular, just beside the bus stand. It is very easy to locate. There is a sign board outside with the name written on it. A narrow passage leads to a small humble cafe. 
I went there with my friend today in the evening for snacks. 
The floor is covered with what we call in Bengali "madur" and the whole cafe was nicely decorated. I instantly like the ambience which was very simple. 
We ordered grilled mud sandwich, french fries (masala) and fresh like soda. The sandwich was awesome stuffed with good amount of chicken, egg and mayo. Masala French fries was tasty as well but I felt they were a bit hard. The sweet fresh lime soda very refreshing as always. 
The staffs were very well behaved and didn't take much time to serve the food. 
I am definitely going back to try out their deserts which looked very intriguing and the other dishes as well.

MUD has been on my wishlist since quite a long time. After reading such excellent reviews, I could not stop myself from making my way to this place for a quiet sunday lunch. 

After reading so many reviews on Zomato, I had a fairly good idea about what to expect but still I was quite amazed by the simplicity of the place. Such a beautiful earthly decor is a rarity these days. I was the first of the customers at that point of time and I took the liberty of clicking quite a bit of photos! The pottery gift items definitely added a spectacular edge to the decor. 

After seeing the menu so many times, I already knew what I was going to try and with a quick glance at the menu (because it seems weird to blurt out the order like a memorised poem!), I placed my order. 

Virgin Pina Colada - Perhaps the only thing that failed to hit the mark was this drink. I am yet to have a good Pina Colada (Non alcoholic, mind you) in the city and hence am open to suggestions. Please comment any place if known. The problem here was that it wasn't a Pina Colada at all! It was a pineapple drink with no coconut flavour at all and just a little cooler than room temperature which just made it that much more unpleasant. 

Fish n Chips - Something I love eating everywhere I go, I had to try it here as well! The fish was really delicious! I loved the flavour of the fish and the spices really elevated the dish. The dish was so good that I was rather disappointed that I finished it so quickly! 

Grilled MUD Sandwich - Heard a lot about this and hence, wasn't going to leave without trying it out! The sandwich was just amazing! There were two layers ; one of chicken and one of boiled egg. It was definitely one of the best sandwiches I've had and the low price really makes this one hard to beat! 

Chocolate MUD Cake - I NEVER EVER leave any place without having a dessert! This place was no exception! The cakes which is a lava cake looked quite  funny but tasted heavenly! I loved it to bits and pieces! The sweetness was just right! It wasn't an overkill of chocolate either. Simply perfect! 

The rabindra sangeet playing softly in the background just makes the experience that much better. 

The place is a must try and be prepared to sit down and relax and just unwind yourself and let the place work its charm! 

Happy Dining!!

MUD is located just next to the Manyavar store bang opposite Citi style near Rashbehari Avenue. The rabindrasangeet played truly brings a different touch to the place. We tried the Mud sandwich, fish and chips, lemongrass cooler and watermelon smoothie. It's easy on the pocket and a great place to hangout with friends.

Are you a Bong who loves to plan his/her next big retreat in a homely atmosphere with some lyadh, and Debabrata Biswas's Akash Bhora Shurjo Tara in the background?
Trust me, this is the place for you.

MUD might be a bit tricky to find and very easy to miss, as it is located in a tiny alley right beside Leatherworld, Triangular Park.
It has two floors. The lower one kind of has that old coffee house feeling with small tables, wooden chairs and an open kitchen.
I just love the upper one. The moment I saw the madur adorned room, something inside me screamed *home* and I was happy to ditch my shoes outside. Everything inside, from the cane lamp to the little crockery boutique and the d√©cor, was very homely.

Now coming to food, if confused, just go for their special MUD sandwich - the best damn sandwich I ever had. It's four pieces of pure bliss layered with boiled egg, mayo and chicken.
Mud chicken balls are kinda dry and tasteless though. I didn't at all liked it. 
The cold coffee was spot on, where as the Pina colada is refreshing. 
The chocolate MUD cake is sinfully delicious. If you're a chocolate lover, you're gonna swear by it.
I also happen to like their Darjeeling tea a lot.
I already went there a couple of times, and I'm definitely going back again soon.
Oh, also they don't take any extra taxes! A biiig plus. üëç

The beverages are quite good and reasonable.  We had Hot chocolate and Cold coffee,  for food we ordered Chicken Cheese grilled sandwich which came to be very delicious and price was also okay for this case.  To have good filled appetite cost of 2 is near arround 400 bucks.  Hope to re-visit :)

Tempted by the 4.5 review in Zomato, we decided to visit the MUD cafe on a drizzling Saturday afternoon . We had ordered
1. Mud Grilled Sandwich - It was very average.. a three tier sandwich filled with chicken and mayonnaise in one tier and boiled egg in the other. It tasted just like the ones we usually make at home.
2. Mud Cake - The cake could hardly be seen.. you can easily make out from the pictures I have posted.. thick layer of chocolate was splattered over cake crumbles. The melted chocolate also had a weird dust like taste.
3. Walnut brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream - Chocolate and vanilla ice cream combination can hardly go wrong.. brownie was good...( though cold)  but could have been better.

*Will I ever go back again???----  NO*

However I will definitely give a thumbs up for the decor and d soft Rabindra sangeet music playing in the background. Staffs are cordial and pricing is pocket friendly.

A rainy afternoon, we went hunting for this blink and you miss place, it's entrance tucked away in a bylane. Inside, the decor was quaint and warm, and packed with a young crowd of foreign nationals and locals alike. The food is suitable for a nibble during adda or even as a light meal. The chicken pasta in red sauce pleased me despite my aversion to tomato-flavoured pasta. 
A little note on the ambience- the place is tastefully decorated with local handicrafts and furniture, perfectly harmonious with the melodious strains of Rabindrasangeet playing in the background. We eventually realised that this was actually the house of the late Debabrata Biswas, the great exponent of Rabindrasangeet, himself, and the light-hearted meal between friends turned into a pilgrimage of sorts for two devotees of his music. His renditions of "Megh bolechhe, jabo jabo" couldn't have been more apt as a soundtrack for that day of intermittent heavy downpour. 
Overall, a very beautiful experience.

The chicken preparation was also good. But I think the consistency of the kitkat shake could have been better. The most amazing thing us they don't add any taxes to the bill. What you see is what you pay. Reasonable enough. Will surely visit soon to try out their other dishes.

Coming to the food,we ordered mexican chicken sandwich and grilled mud sandwich(a special Mud preparation which had layers of cheese,egg,mayo and chicken) - they were served with sauce and potato chips.They tasted simply awesome !! We also took Mud special kolkata mojito(basically lime soda) which was quite refreshing and kitkat shake which stole our heart !!! Kitkat shake is a must try ! For dessert,we took walnut brownie with ice cream which was again delicious.The service offered was cooperative and we also got a complementary soft drink bottle since it is monsoon !! It is one of the best places for hangout after college or school.¬†

MUD was once home to my most favorite voice and I hope they will continue to preserve his legacy in this cafe. I have been there plenty of times. The sandwiches are fantastic, surely one of the best in south Kolkata. However, the same cannot be said about their mocktails and fish fry. However, the service is absolutely outstanding, if not the best. Once a frequent visitor, if you are a fan of George da like me, you can surely try this cafe once in a while. 
I will try their parota Mangsho if I visit there next time.

they have these wonderful posters and beautiful lamp lights all around.
a perfect place for long duration of 'adda' & 'prem'

This place was on my list for a while. Growing up on a diet of robindra sangeet , a visit to Debabrata Biswas's house is a special treat. This evening , went in for an adda session with Shohini Gupta .
Loved the homely feel and the mats on the floor. Someone has a good eye for detail, and the store sells mediocre jewellery but excellent earthenware.
Coming to the food, ordered a watermelon smoothie which was bang on the buck for the weather outside. The mud cakes are spot on too. The chicken omelettes however needs to be worked on. There is far too much chicken and far too less of cheese and more importantly zero flavouring in the chicken. A bit of oregano or rosemary would have really lifted the flavouring . I would also contemplate using chicken keema instead of diced chicken just because it feels less off a mouthful.
The music is what ties the whole experience together and while I sat there humming old tunes I couldn't help but wonder how the owners have missed a great opportunity in designing this place better. I would loved to see more pictures of the greater singer in the walls, during his interactions with his contemporaries, instead of the generic stills from Ray's films. The tiny house has a charm of it's own and its a wonderful place to let the afternoon pass you by

Right at triangular park, a little inwards from the main road that goes towards gariahat is this place 

We had to wait for half an hour for getting us a place on a Saturday evening. The decor is nice and sober. They have changed a small flat into a nice eatery where they play old Bengali songs and there is a nice Bengali touch to the place overall.

The staff is sweet. The food is not great but it is not bad either. Our chicken sandwich was good but fish and chips and pina colada were a little disappointing. Mojito, espresso and Oreo shake were the usual. 

You can visit this nice and small for a lazy time and catching up with old friends. Thumps up!

Mud is a hidden gem on rashbehari avenue. this was my second visit and had to wait outside along with another group as both floors were full. as soon as we entered the fresh cold comfortable air welcomed us.
service today was a bit slow as the house was full but the food quality made it up. awesome fresh sandwich perfectly grilled with loads of chicken and cheese and cold coffee with ice cream was my choice. my friend opted for blue lagoon and chicken kussa with rumali. all dishes were extremely good both from quality and taste angle. keep it up mud team.
PS: extremely innovative menu cart cover design and beautiful pottery works in the gift store caught our atlention

It is located just beside the leather world shop in triangular park. It is a bit difficult one to locate for first timers. The ambiance is one of the best I have ever come across. It is very home-like and soothing. 

As for the food it is absolutely delicious too. We ordered the mud grilled sandwich and rumali roti with chicken kasa. The sandwich has generous amount of mayo ,egg and chicken. And the chicken kasa is exactly how you expect it to be. Delicious. And the best part. It's price. It's very cheap.  Definitely will come again.

It seldom happens that the food sends you to such a high that you just can't get enough of it. We had mini meals in the form of rumali roti + dahi chicken combo, rumali roti + chicken kassa combo and ended  our night with chocolate mud cake ! All the dishes were perfectly cooked . Although the space is a bit conjested but the decor and the soothing Rabindra sangeet playing in the background makes up for the deficiency. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY -- it cost ‚Çπ 350 !

Nice cozy place...conveniently located near Triangular Park,Gariahat,South Kolkata.
This is the house where the legendary Rabindrasangeet singer Debabrata Biswas lived.
The cafe has maintained the cultural atmosphere with soft Rabindrasangeet playing in the background....seating arrangements are quite unique with clay decorations here & there....the ambient lighting is warm and very welcoming to the guests..
food is good in quality....tasty....served very nicely...

The cafe is located near triangular park.. From outside noone can actually guess that there is a cafe inside, only the hoardings make you figure out the location of the place. This is a house.. I pretty much like the concept of converting a small old house to a cafe.. This is unique.. It represents antique bengali culture.. Starting With the mats on the floor, the bengali heritage songs setting the mood of the place, the wooden chairs n tables, the simple yet elegant lightings to the paintings on the wall .. Everything has a homely appearance. The name itself resonates with the theme of the cafe.. We sat at the ground floor, ordered 2 cold coffee with ice creams, one cheese and chicken sandwich and there signature Grilled mud sandwich. I loved all of them.. Cold coffee... A lot Bttr dan ccds.. Grilled mud sandwich is truely the best with cheese , minced chicken , boiled egg sliced n stuffed inside, served with mustard sauce. We also got to avail the monsoon special offer of getting a soft drink on a minimum bill of 450. The staffs were very courteous , suggested what's best available there.. Service was prompt. Pricing is reasonable.. And quality , taste is excellent.. A must visit for all cafe food lovers and south calcuttans. They do not charge taxes (yet). Only drawback is the ground floor gets a bit crowdy sometimes as customers from the floor above comes down to exit and pay. But that's considerable as its a house turned cafe.. A nice place to spend a refreshing evening with your near n dear ones.

A place with an amicable ambience serves palatable food. Such a lovely combination of food, adda and hospitality. A cafe with a traditional touch of kolkata. My wife and I tried mutton ghugni, cheese chicken omlet and coffee, which rendered us a frolic for the taste. We would love to visit again the place. We do recommend the the place with a rating of 4.8.

Today i had gone to mud in the evening for the firts time. This is the first time i saw a queue in front of a cafe that too in the late evening hour. However as i entered the cafe i was mesmerised. So simple yet so bengali atmosphere reflecting our heritaje and culture. Coming to the food every dish we had was out of the world. Mud sandwich was the jeweel in the crown. We ented up with brownie with ice cream which was  awesome. Service was excellent in spite of the fact was absolutely  full. Kudos mud!!! Keep it up

this eating joint started operating with appreciable service and a quiet, gentle ambience. like things that change with time, by now the service has deteriorated significantly, most of the offerings are often not available,the cafe staff is quite indifferent.the anbience is reasonably good and has remained so but by now the need for a brighter illumination , specially downstairs , can be felt, maninly because of the film coating on the entrance glass door, which makes it all a little too dark.

This place was in my bucket list from a few weeks and I finally got a chance to visit today. Located beside leather world, the have sitting both downstairs and upstairs. We Sat upstairs. The ambience is great with Rabindra sangeet playing at the background. The place has craft items on display. Full marks for its ambience. Coming to the food. Tried their mud grilled sandwich and mud cake. 
Mud grilled sandwich was a very tasty blend of eggs chicken and mayo. It was really tasty served with ketchup and kasundi(mustard sauce)
But the best was mud cake. Warm chocolate cake with chocolate oozing out of it was simply delicious.!!
A pocket friendly cafe with superb food and wifi too :p ;)
I'm looking forward to my next visit soon. :-)

A cozy caf√© in rashbehari avenue, with a home-like atmosphere, that has a good selection of menu, serves the best chicken cutlet. Aroma of darjeeling tea was a complete stress reliever.
Can guarantee it serves the "yummiest" chicken cutlet.
Doesn't pinch much in pocket as well.
One of my favourite caf√©!

Thought of starting my foodie journey with a review of MUD, the cafe I am literally in love with. Being close to my place, I have dropped in here on several occasions,the latest being about 10days back. 
Location :situated in the narrow lane beside Leather World and bang opposite to Citi Style at Triangular Park. 
Sitting arrangement is available both on the ground floor and the first floor.The ground floor always smells of freshly brewed coffee and gives way to an open kitchen.Personally,i like to have all my adda sessions in the little room on the first floor as it provides a bit more privacy.The pottery and jewellery on display is for sale. 
Ambiance:Soothing ambience,mats covering the floor and rabindra sangeet playing in the background...super like!! 
Food:On all my visits I somehow end up ordering the MUD special grilled sandwich...four blocks of two layered perfectly grilled sandwich stuffed with generous amount of chicken and egg, served with chips, kasundi and tomato ketchup.
Last time we ordered chocolate mousse and brownie with ice-cream. It would have been great if they could serve a bit more of that chocolate sauce laced vanilla ice-cream.
Tasted their Pineapple Blossom before but didn't like much. The chicken and cheese omlette served by them is to die for. 
Service: Excellent service.Very polite and helpful staff. 
Highly recommended!!

This place is love. It has a beautiful, homely ambience. MUD is located right beside Triangular Park and opposite City Style. The staff are warm and friendly and the prices of the food are pocket friendly. The food is no doubt lip smacking! One should definitely try out the chicken burger. Rabindra Sangeet is played in the background which gives this place a different feel. They have sitting arrangement in both ground and first floor. The place also showcases handmade clay products and jewellery among other things. This is a place which everyone should experiences. :)

Coming to d food, I was dissapointed. We opted for chickn cheese omlette, fish chop, dahi chickn with ruti. Omlette was really good. Fish chop was nothin but aloo chop served in a fish shaped bowl. Dahi chickn was way too sweet. 
In dessert we opted for choc mud cake an choc mousse. Mousse was good. Mud cake was again dissapointing.

Discovered this place just today when we were looking for a nice place to eat.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: The cafe has a got this homely feeling with a Bengali theme. It's quiet and peaceful with old Bengali songs playing in very low volume.
Staffs were very friendly and helped us with our order by giving suggestions. Some items were unavailable like the Irish Cream and Lemon Tart on being ordered. The service was very slow.

FOOD: The Chicken Hot Dog was okay. Loved the Grilled Mud Sandwich. The bread was crunchy and soft. The Masala French Fries were not good. Whatever masala they had put, it was tasteless.¬†
Pineapple Blossom was recommended to us and it was worth trying. Absolutely loved it!
Chocolate mud cake was also good.

Looking forward to going back again and trying more of the items and rating it more than just a 3.5! :)

Situated just opposite to city style near triangular Park in a very narrow passage, this place is actually the house of Mr. debobrata Bishwash renovated.  They serve very light meal and food here is simple and light. Awesome aroma of coffee you'll get just entering there. Low oil, almost no use of species you can actually taste each individual ingredient.. We had the MUD sandwich and the cheese chicken omelette. The MUD sandwich had layers of mayo, chicken, boiled egg. But in the omelette the quantity of cheese was little low. The ambience there is just so soothing. You can spend hours with a cup of coffee chatting with friends. Nice place.

We bengalis love music and we cannot deny the fact that rabindrasangeet dwells in our heart. MUD is one such cafe that incorporates rabindrasangeet as their background music.I wont call it a cafe because its more than a cafe. You will feel like as if you are in your own home listening to the varied songs of this genre and having on something or the other. 

With my cousin on one fine rainy day i went there. The rain outside and the melody inside was so soothing. Sweet music always lifts your mood.

 Loved the decoration. 

Coming to the food we ordered one blue lagoon,one chicken kassa with rumali roti,one mexican chicken sandwich,one french fries(masala) and one walnut brownie with ice cream.

Blue lagoon- very refreshing. Loved it.

Chicken kassa with rumali roti- kassa was tasty;the chicken was soft and juicy. The rotis weren't soft.

French fries(masala)- fries were very crispy and yummy. A must try.

Walnut brownie with ice cream-  i am in love with this. The brownie was soft and delicious. The vanilla ice cream made it more delicious. A must try.

I loved this place and would definately visit that place again to try out their grilled mud sandwich and chocolate mud cake

Now I can't tell you how much I am excited to give a review. I am just trying to make my feelings into words. Yes, it's a treat. It was in my wishlist for long. And atlst.. :)

Location: it's at triangular park. For south Kolkata people please omit this line, u guys know it better :D
For other: go to triangular park, it's just beside the leather world.

Ambience: ohhh.. it's just blown me away. It perfect like a Bengali reading room, the light, the decoration they have like perfect baithak khana. With rabindra sangeet in back ground.. that's really refreshing. I wish I could have decorated my room like that.. it's that soothing.. 

Now just go to the food
________________________________

1. Mud grill sandwich: let me tell u this is the best sandwich i have ever had. Two layer of egg and chicken. Ohh ... Dats heavenly in taste.

2. Chicken cheese omlet : excellent. Too delicious.

3. Fish and chips: kind of fish fry. But taste is too good. And special mention of the sauce: mix of tomato sauce , kasundi and hamas ... Excellent.

4. Mutton fuchka: this was so so. Good one.. but not that good like other items.

In beverages:
________________

1. Pineapple blossoms: excellent one. Owsum
2. Special mud Kolkata mojhito: owssum, very very refreshing.

One suggestion
_______________________
I guess u guys should try the mutton fuchka with pure mutton pudding.that will taste much better .. i assume :)

Special mention
________________________
the water bottle they use to serve. Yes pretty unique.

And the person who attended us. I forgot to ask his name. Apologies for that. But brother u and ur team are owssum. I like the way that u catch what preparation I like or not. U and ur team is excellent. Long way to go.

This is the best cafe I have ever gone. Trust me. Their food quality is too good. And it's too reasonable.

Two person cost :
______________________
665 Rs. And we were terribly hungry :D

An humble request: we are people from north side of Kolkata. We want ur brunch here. :)

And mud team: u guys rocks.. keep it up.. cheers!!!!!

The eatery is located near triangular park near gariahat & is very well decorated with rabindra sangeet playing in the background. The ambiance is nice & soothing. 
Sitting is available in both ground floor & 1st floor. 

Service and behavior of the stuff there are good and warming. Good thing is the prices are inclusive of tax.

#Food : We ordered chicken cheese sandwich, french fries and walnut brownie with ice cream. All the three items were yum & tasty. The desert could have been presented more well and I felt the quantity & quality is lil less.

If you are a poet, philosopher, thinker or an artist of any kind - this is the place to be. Operating from a small 2 storey house in South Calcutta, the cafe boasts significantly of cultural panache. Strategically located in a narrow alley, it cuts you off from the city's din once you are in, thus letting you unwind in peace.
Reed mat floorings and walls decked with exquisite clay works, lends the ambiance a soothing countryside essence. Very courteous staff and a wide range of refreshments to choose from at a fairly reasonable price. Whether you are looking forward to cut yourself out for a few hours and sip on warm Darjeeling tea or a gathering of friends to discuss almost everything out there in the sun over plates of Fish and Chips; Mud cafe has to be the undebatable choice. 
Looking forward to visit again.

It's a lovely cafe decorated wonderfully with posters and other knick knacks with rabindra sangeet been played in the background. Peaceful and calm all it was.
Coming to the food. It didn't disappoint either.
We ordered 
Mud special sandwich- it was tasty and filling. 
Fish and chips- it comprised of a fish fry and some frech fries. The fish fry tasted fine.
Rumali roti with dahi chicken-  I loved the dahi chicken though my friends complained it of being a little more sweeter,  I loved its taste. 
Mud special chocolate cake-  I am running out of words for it. It was too yummy to make me crave for it even now. So soft , so amazing filled with hot chocolate, the cake is sure to turn you on. To me,it was the  perfect show stopper . Highly Recommended. 
The positivity and tranquility of this place is sure to drag you there again.

Tucked away in a small corner? This place fits the definition. The menu is nothing extravagant but the ambience is. I haven't seen any restaurant like this in a while. The simplicity of it makes it a humdinger. Rumali roti with chicken kassa and Hawaiian salad is enough for two. Lemongrass mojito would be the best one I have had in a while. Caramel pudding is the perfect end to a very simple yet brilliant food. Cons? Nothing.

Okay so MUD.First of all I loved this name. It's been a long time since I v visited a good cafe and this cafe just did the magic. I have loved everything about this cafe. The ambience with bengali old songs adding a flavour to the nostalgia and the interior which only had 'Madur' (in Bengali) spread across the floor and the wall. The lights, chairs ,tables everything can actually compel you to visit the place again and again. The food is freakingly good. Especially the special MUD sandwich. (do try it.!!). The mousse and so as the mocktail can make you fall in love with the whole cafe. 
I have enjoyed everything about the cafe . It's actually a cafe where you feel home .

Let me tell you a tale of MUD.
Turned into not a so called caf√©, the residence of Late Rabindrasangeet Singer, Debabrata Biswas(I know how most of the people couldn't care any less about it, but being a Bengali;I do),is sure to emanate an appeal of heritage that I'm sure no caf√© would.
Though it is supposedly an eatery, but there are some places which are more like an adda zone and less like a place to go on gulping food.
Adda zone, an understatement.
I can't help but notice how each and every lil thing resonates within you, a culture. A Bong Hub, may be?
Perfect in each and every sense.
Decor radiating Bengali ambiance, low tuned Rabindrasangeet setting the mood without interfering with conversation.
Two floors. Wouldn't say very spacious, but that's what adds to its cuteness (I'd say petite, if it was a human). First floor has a half room showcasing crockeries and boutique items for sale, yes you read me right. Not to mention, how pleasing they look. The other room with a glass door has seating arrangements for nearabout 17-18 people at the max.
And then there's the ground floor which holds a open kitchen and 3-4 tables. Also, a stand flashings earrings, anyone ?
Well now I guess, I should be talking about business.
Next day being Eid, and main cook being on a leave, we were told about the unavailability of certain items like salads, pastas, mutton phuchka (damn, such a letdown).
Hence, Chicken Mud Grilled Sandwich, Fish and Chips, Chicken Burger, Chicken and Cheese Omelette, KitKat Shake, Oreo Shake, Tutti Frooti, Espresso were on the go.
While KitKat shake, Espresso and Tutti Frooti were on the spot, the Oreo shake didn't stimulate much response.
Fish and chips weren't that great either.
However omelettes, burgers and sandwiches will give you happiness for sure.
So shall the bill. No service tax, no VAT. You pay what you gotta pay. This is the best thing a food joint can offer(apart from good food), I tell you.
I don't think anything is left to say after this accolade.
Don't expect fancy items please.
Decent food and great people should be the 'on-my-mind' motto for this place. And also some memento collection, if you'd like.
You'd have a good time, I bet. :)

Well, if you are looking for a small, quaint cafe tucked in a small corner around Gariahat, where you can sit with friends and have a meaningful conversation, then don't look any further because MUD is the one!!!
Two rooms of renowned Rabindrasangeet Singer, Debabrata Biswas's abode has been converted into this warm, friendly cafe where you can just sit, relax and talk your heart's content with the company you are with. Well, the review is after my second visit (had skipped to review after the first) so I can vouch for their consistency of food & service,both. It gives you more of a homely feeling rather than a cafe. Both the times I had ordered for their Hot Chocolate which is a stable blend of the cocoa powder & milk. Along with it their specialty MUD sandwich which is more like a double-decker sandwich(pardon my comparison, but still) where the first deck is with boiled chicken & cheese while the second is of boiled egg & cheese. The perfect balance of salt and black pepper reminds you of the homely touch of the same sandwich your mum must have prepared at home at some given point of time. My friend had ordered a MUD cake which was delectably gooey & chocolaty . I would love to come back yet again just for their sandwich & the hot chocolate.¬†
& it would be wrong on my part if I don't mention about the courteous staff & their efficient service.¬†

Well, you know one more best thing about their food? They don't separate a good bunch of taxes with the bill. Its all inclusive & quite pocket-friendly . So you can bid the place a farewell on a happy, yet MUD-dy note :)

It's located on the opposite of the city style near leather world. Had an wonderful experience thereüòä the lane is though very narrow to get an exact idea of the location,but the ambience is very soothing n homely. The service is really too good. Ordered KitKat shake,mango shake with ice cream,grilled mud sandwich. KitKat shake didn't satisfy me much but the mango shake is very tasty. It's the pure extract of mango. N the sandwich is too much delicious. It's very yummy. Want to try it again. The background music n the decoration also give you a pleasure.

The rating on this place is going off the charts for quite sometimes, so naturally it caught my interest...and my partner in crime i.e. the missus & I  made it a point to visit the Mud last Saturday.
1st of all don't be fooled by its location as pointed out in Zomato , as rashbehari. It ain't rashbehari, rather it's approximately triangular park. Best landmark, is the leather land shop! The corridor beside the shop is its entrance.
Welcomed to a room filled with Aroma of coffee and Debabrata Biswas'es songs played on the music system, soft yellow lights decorating the tastefully done yet simple interiors,  we immediately developed an affection for this place. Ambience:4.5/5
Two rooms of Debabrata Biswas' residence has been converted to setup this beautiful cafe. Comfortably seated upstairs, humming to the tunes of the legendary singer, my missus ordered a Mud special sandwich and I settled for ruti with chicken kosha.

It would be rude, if I didn't specifically mention about the attendants running this cafe. They are extremely cordial , fast in service and would help you with the menu, if you need any help. Service: 5/5

The food came in no time.
Mud special chicken sandwich: gorgeous looking grilled sandwich divided into four blocks were served with the chips and mustard, sauce combination. The sandwich was grilled perfectly. It had two layers, the bottom layer consisting of egg and Mayo and the upper layer of cheese and chicken. The sandwich tasted delicious, fulfilling yet not that heavy. Rating:4/5

Rumali roti and chicken kosha: well people would sneer at the thought of eating this dish in the middle evening, but for a food lover like me...it's a good game anytime. The roti was usual and kosha was pure poetry. Two juicy tangris of chicken, in a thick spicy gravy garnished with coriander leaves was just mouth watering. Rating:4/5

Then, I ordered a Mud special kolkata mojito and my wife a cappuccino.
The mojito had a heavenly smell due to the gondhoraj lebu pieces in it. However, it was extra sweet that kinda ruined it's taste. Rating:3/5
Cappuccino was usual.

Overall, it's a perfect place if you don't like loud music blaring out of the speakers and instead listen to some classic Debabrata Biswas' numbers and cool your heels off with some nice drink and fill your tummy with some awesome bites and have a classy adda.

Ps. It's damn cheap. 400 bux for 2.

Visited this cafe last week after reading rave reviews about the place. And I wasn't disappointed at all. The music was although and created a peaceful atmosphere, without hindering conversations. 

The Mud Grilled Sandwich was brilliant, and the Calcutta Mojito was good too. And their Mud Cake was amply gooey and chocolatey. 

They don't charge taxes (yet) and is already a hit, and remains pretty full at most times.

This is my second visit to MUD. It is the kind of place you would find really soothing, with the Rabindra Sangeet playing in the background, and quaint decorations around. This cafe has a true Bengali ambience. The servers are polite and ask if you're pleased. If you're not, they will patiently listen to what went wrong. That is a huge positive, I think.
Today, I tried their MUD grilled sandwich, french friedls, fresh lime soda and darjeeling tea.
Their sandwich is nice and filling with a layer of chicken and a layer of egg. The fries were crisp and well seasoned. The fresh lime soda was good too. The tea, however, I would have preferred to be stronger.
A few weeks ago, when I came with a bunch of friends, I also tried the cold coffee with ice cream, which was more watery than creamy and pretty strong on the coffee. Most of my friends did not like it, but somehow it suited my tastebuds. It might not suit yours. And finally I tried their MUD cake. This was everyone's favourite! It is really small, but very yummy. A bigger piece would be definitely be appreciated for this price.
Overall, neither of the times did I leave with a completely bad experience.

After a hearty lunch, we headed off to this place for dessert as we had heard of it but never had the opportunity to visit the same. It is located opposite to City style and right beside Leather World, Triangular Park. A tiny lane leads to the cafe and if not looked closely, one might very easily miss this place. 
It was a small cafe with a 2 storey sitting arrangement. It has a very Bengali feel with strains of Rabindrasangeet playing in the background. 
We ordered the French fries and chocolate mud cake. The cake was in the shape of a muffin and was perfectly moist and felt very smooth on the taste buds. The only disadvantage being it's size, because it is just enough for one person. The French fries were nice and crispy and served with Mustard sauce and ketchup. 
A small flight of stairs lead to the 1st floor which houses a gift shop and a sitting area for the cafe as well. The gift shop has earthen ware pots, cloth bags, jewellery and room decoration material that one can buy. 
The service was good and prompt and the waiters nice and courteous. Only thing is, they can add more variation to the dessert menu including dishes that would be a bit more filling in nature like the classic hot chocolate fudge with brownies and ice-cream. ‚ò∫

A boutique cum cafe, showcasing imported handmade clay products, jewellery, tote bags and lots more!
Our craving for dessert took us to this place! We had ordered mud cakes and french fries to get over the excess sweetness. Mud cake was really nice and gooey, it stuck a bit above the toungue but its ok. Fries were fine, could have been better. Mud special sandwiches are really good. This place has lots of options for tea lovers. Tooti frooti also seemed to be a nice option. Best part is the prices are very cheap and inclusive of tax, very economic.
Service is good, servers are informative and gives good suggestions.
Only thing they need to work on is their menu, it needs to be improved and elaborate. Thus nice dessert made us left happy and satiated our appetite. ‚ò∫

This place is located bang opposite Citistyle, Triangular Park. A tiny lane beside leather world leads you to a two storeyed building which oozes out Bengali nostalgia. The floor has jute mats spread out all over. It has posters of Bengali movies specifically Ritwik Ghatak and his work. As music they have rabindrasangeet by George biswas. It's a very tidy place with simplicity at it's core. The waiters are very well behaved. Coming to the food, the sandwiches are tasty. I however personally loved the chocolate mud cake.( It was too tiny though) üòû The French fries which we ordered was crisp and served with tomato ketchup. (It could've been a little salty I feel). The place is extremely reasonable and thus a delight to revisit without prior checking of the situation of ones wallet. The first floor has a tiny boutique with stuff made of mud (tiny cups, bowls etc) and handmade bags, earrings as well. Apart from that there's also a seating area present for people to enjoy their food. Overall a good experience. However I feel the menu could be altered and made a little more widespread to attract a wider range of customers.

Mud Is like home for me. The Food is quite good here and the rates are equally reasonable. They play this awesome Rabindra Sangeet which soothes the mood complemented well with good service. I and my girlfriend often visit here and we are quite fond of this place. The interiors are decorated with beautiful antics which is an icing on the cake. 
If you are looking for a quality afternoon with your friends or partner then this a good place to visit.

Located just opposite City Style and¬† beside Leather world near Triangular park in Rash Behari Avenue.
Ambiance was perfect with RABINDRA SANGEET going in the back ground.

We ordered a grilled mud sandwich, Chicken cheese omelette, Fish chop, Hot Chocolate and Mud cake.
The coffee was served along with a tiny salted cookie.
The MUD sandwich was two layered, one layer of chicken and cheese, another of egg and cheese. It came with wafers. It was good.
Size of the fish chop was big and tasted very fresh.
The omelette was nicely made with chicken and cheese.
The Mud cakes were the best and looked a lot like Choco lava cakes but they're not really so.

They have seating arrangement both upstairs and downstairs.
Staffs were very good and cooperative.
Overall, it's an extremely pocket friendly cafe as they do not charge any extra taxes.
will visit this Outlet again for sure.
Highly recommended.....

What an amazing place...ambience with simple decor..well illuminated with some old school background music..u feel so elated here..we headed upstairs..the staff was courteous..
Now..our food journey started with cheese corn burst sandwich...and it literally made me spellbound...the balance of cheese was spot on...awesome taste..the grilled mud sandwich somehow was shadowed by its veg competitor..the taste of the egg did hide the flavour of other proteins...next...the hawaiian chicken salad...generous amounts of chicken and veggies tossed in mayonese..lip smacking indeed..though i felt the veggies could have been cut a bit tidy..
The chicken burger...soft juicy delicate patty made my day..extraordinary stuff...
The chocolate mud cake...smooth warm chocolate bathed..melts in ur mouth..i absolutely loved the texture..super success.
The kitkat shake could have been a bit thicker and chocolaty..but the other dishes were good enough to fetch honors...
At last they gave us a complementary coca cola of 400 ml..a really nice gesture..
So in a nutshell..a place good for pocket,mind and apetite....

My frequent hangout place. From their egg and mayo sandwich, mud special sandwich, chicken cheese omelet, dahi chicken, chicken kasha, hawaian salad(average), fish chops to their mud special mojito, kitkat shake and mud cake, I love it all. But there mutton fuchka is never available. Nevertheless, Mud serves you a good quantity at an affordable price. Plus they have a very polite staff who are always happy to help.

Suden dates are the best dates. Well, I took my girl to thie hidden gem a.k.a 'Mud'  today which is located in Rashbehari Avenue beside 'Leder Land'. We entered at around 5.45 pm via a well decorated lane. On entering we wanted to get two seats upstairs but it was nkt possible as the upstair seats were packed. So, we decided to sit on downstairs. The sraff welcomed us cordially and did not pester us a bit regarding our orders which is highly commendable. The interior was not too gaudy but the ambience inside was really nice. We ordered a Chicken Salad first. The food took fifteen minutes to arrive. They should definitely look into the serving speed. The chicken salad was made with chicken cubes, three kinds of bell pepper, lettuce, mayonnaise and zucchini, if I am not wrong. This dish was served with bread. This dish was delicious to say the least and we were blown away by the sweet and sour taste of the salad. Up next, we ordered the Grilled Mud Sandwich. The food took seven minutes to arrive. It was served with mustard sauce and tomato sauce. With the first bite, I was transferred to heaven. The bread was grilled to perfection. Inside it the sliced egg, chicken, mayonnaise and chesse made it a delectable dish. They use egg slicer to slice the boiked egg as well they use non-plastic plates and cups which is a great thing. The behavior of the staff was cordial. I will definitely visit again.

This is a small cozy cafe at triangular park crossing which is ideal for snacking and spending time catching up with friends or reading a book. I really liked how simple and elegant the place is. The food menu is limited but the quality of the dishes are very good. The service is good too. I ordered the mud sandwich along with pesto pasta and French fries. All of them were really nice, especially the sandwich. It's quiet and not very crowded so it's a good spot to spend time in.

For those who haven't recently been to the mud cafe, it's really gotten quiet excellent. This is a classic family run cafe. The chefs are turning out some wonderful dishes including various kinds of sandwich, exquisite desserts and appetizers. The cafes' atmosphere is sophisticated but at the same time very homey,making Mud a very pleasant dining experience. Prices too are reasonable for the quality,though certainly not cheap. Ornaments, handbags and extraordinary pottery are also sold there. Therefore it is a good place for holidays,special occasions etc with attractive decor and a quiet ambience.

Went there on a Sunday evening with my friends after seeing a good rating in zomato..

I would just say one thing. this place is over hyped. we took our seats at 8 and ordered the food by 8.15.
they took 45 minutes to one hour to serve us.
we ordered quite a few things.

chicken Mexican sandwich
chicken hot dog 
egg and mayo sandwich
cobb salad and hawaiian salad and two shakes.

The Mexican sandwich was quite good.
But the egg and mayo s/w was just plain bread and sliced eggs . Not even a hint of mayo.
it tasted bland . Awful...

next came the hot dog which was just bun (pao bread ,not even the actual hot dog roll) and hot dog.. no dressing no mayo..again bland.

the salads were filled with capsicum and nothing else.. not even a hint of chicken.

we had also ordered the chicken mud sandwich which they failed to prepare and serve but didn't forget to wipe it off the bill.
when we notified them they said"sorry we forgot to serve you the mud sandwich it's already prepeared in the kitchen".

thank God we checked the bill. otherwise they would have charged us for something we didn't have..

come on guys get your act together..

An awful experience altogether..

Mud, a memorable boithoki den set in a vintage quintessential Bengali house, can be best described as -- subtle,  minimalistic,  ethnic, sophisticated. We, a trio of longlost college buddies, frolicked one snug afternoon of hearty adda over endless cups of steaming, aromatic Darjeeling Second Flush, while the savoury,  succulent machher chops did their sumptuous rounds. 

The crisp golden fish fries made with authentic Bhetki and served with a tart kasundi, were reminiscent of old North Calcutta lanes, and a passport to gluttonous heaven. Not to forget the iconic Mud sandwich - a plush double-decker treat that sank our teeth into a burst of creamy egg-n-cheese delight crusted with generous bites of chicken.  

As we indulged in the nimble caramel custard sinfully melting in our mouth, we suddenly realized that all this while we had remained transfixed in time, wrapped in George Biswas crooning in his unforgettable treasures, drowning us in memories that glitter in crevices of times past. On a worldly note, extremely pocket-friendly was a delightful surprise that awaited us at the counter. 

In all, Mud felt like a slice of tranquility that wiped out the chaos of the city, and took us to another place and time. Rather a soul food, Mud at once impacts a strong calling to one's tongue as well as one's heart, with a unique tempering of nostalgia, certainly worth a comeback.

Let me tell you don't blv in reviews !!
I visited this place and when i entered i was amazed with the ambience the decor !!
It was amazing inside the restro i really felt as i am sitting in an old bengali house which is maintained really good !!
The service and the staffs are really nice they keep a smile on thier face treat you really well !!
But what so ever whenever we visit any place like restro cafe !!
One thing which we always expect to be outstanding is the quality and taste of the food which we are going to eat !!
In that case this restro lacks !!
We ordered chicken pasta,mutton ghugni etc and let me tell you this i was hugely dissapointed !!
The taste was not upto the mark being one of the highest rated cafe around kolkata i was expecting something extraordinary !!
It is pocket freindly but no restro can be rated highly if the food is average !!
I felt like this my girlfriend felt the same !!

A perfect place to rejuvenate yourself after a gloomy day. Great food, cozy place and Debabrata Biswas's Rabi Thakurer gaan. The Cheese Chicken Omlette is an absolute delight while the hot chocolate, though smelled very good, tasted average. The fresh lime soda too was not that good. The Grilled Mud Sandwich with cheese, chicken, egg and mayo was tasty. But the Mud Cake was heavenly; with correct amount of heat, this sticky bitter-sweet dish is of absolute delight. The staff were extremely polite and served our order very fast, even it was almost a full house. We also got a 600ml Coca Cola complimentary. Will surely visit again to taste other dishes and drinks.

This cosy little place is located in Triangular Park. There's a narrow lane leading to the entrance of the cafe just beside Leather World. The service provided is very satisfying. The food that is available is filling (Of course that depends on what you order) and the ambience adds to the cosy, homely feel that one gets upon entering the place. One unique thing about this place is that they have a little shop upstairs which is a brilliant little touch to the whole idea of this cafe. I would surely visit this place again very soon. :)

Very conveniently located...Triangular Park stoppage, opposite to City Style, beside Leather World.¬†
Take the narrow lane beside Leather World and enter the cafe. The place was actually the residence of the famous singer Debabrata Biswas.

The cafe is unique in it's own special way. Homely decor, touch of "Bangaliana" everywhere. The soft soothing Rabindrasangeet was adding to the charm.

We went to the 1st floor and occupied a table. The cafe was almost full though it was a weekday.

The hospitality was warm. Staff were courteous. We ordered a Grilled Mud Sandwich, Irish Coffee & ¬†Chocolate Mud Cake. Irish Coffee was not available, so we ordered a Hot Chocolate.¬†

The sandwich was great. There were 2 layers, lower one had egg & cheese, upper one had chicken. It was served with Kasundi & sauce. Loved it!

Chocolate Mud Cake was decent, however I felt the sweetness could have been moderated.¬†

Hot Chocolate was just perfect. It had the right proportion of sugar, milk & cocoa powder/ chocolate. It was served with a cookie.¬†

The billing is done on the ground floor. The bill had no taxes added. Extremely reasonable.¬†
¬†
Overall, a very nice experience. A good food journey.¬†

Totally Recommended!

A combination of good food, nice ambience and baritone voice of the legendary Debabrata Biswas is an absolute treat. At MUD, you will get all the three. The lane beside Leather World (just on the opposite side of Citi Style) will lead you to the cafe. The lane is well-lit. This was my second visit to the cafe.¬†

I went there for dinner (on 13July, 2016) with my husband and we ordered Mutton Ghugni, Grilled Mud Sandwich and Mexican Chicken Sandwich one each, a Cold Coffee with ice cream and a large Mango Mousse. Mutton Ghugni was good. The motor(dried yellow peas) ¬†was well cooked and not over or under done. The Grilled Mud Sandwich seemed to be the signature dish and was perfectly balanced. Both the sandwich were served with potato chips. Cold Coffee with ice cream was good. The Mango Mousse stole my heart, it was an¬†absolute delight.

The plating steals the show. The bowl of mutton ghugni¬† was served with a¬†spoon made of either leaves or paper mache ( I am not sure of), but seemed to be made of some biodegradable material. Both the sandwich were served in square plates of the same material and the mango mousse in a plastic container¬†served in a sweet heart shaped plate, again of the same material. Cute little earthen plates were used for serving two types of sauce for each¬†sandwich.

Ambience- What can you expect when you are dining in the house of legendary Randrasangeet singer Debabrata Biswas. The decor was quintessentially¬†Bengali with sitalpati on the floor, earthenware on the floor and ongs to the likes of "Esho¬†Shyamolo Sundoro", "Klanti amar¬†khama koro" in the backdrop. I found the staircase leading to the first-floor sitting area pretty interesting. There was potochitro,¬†stills ¬†from films like Devi, Ghare Baire and others.

To my surprise, after paying the bill we got a pet bottle of coke, it was a complementary.

After a long day shopping I was searching for a good face near Gariahat and saw the listing on Zomato. Had a tough time in locating this place as this is inside a dingy lane just next to Leather world. A very small place and we were asked to sit on the first floor. 

The ambiance, you will feel like sitting in a old buildings of Kolkata, the floor to roof length of this size can only be seen in old buildings of Kolkata. The waiter served the water and mentioned that he will be back in 5 minutes to take the order.

We ordered Grilled mud sandwich, one chicken and mayo sandwich and a mud special Kolkata mojito.

The mud Grilled sandwich was of four pieces double decked sandwich and was really really nice. The chicken sandwich was also nice. Kolkata mud mojito had a slight twist with respect to the normal mojito we have but I did had bigger expectation on this one. 

Even tried an in house chocolate which was also good. Overall nice experience with extremely economical pocket pinch a nice place to catch up friends, but cannot be a large group and I found the place to be slightly cramped.

My first visit to this place¬† after it was highly recommended by a friend. The entrance is through a narrow lane however it is easy to locate as it is right next to Leather World and opposite to City Styles. The moment we entered through the sliding door it felt as if we reached a different place and time, from chaos of Gariahat to a state of total tranquility.
I am not 100% sure but from the print outs displayed proudly on the walls this restaurant could be situated in the house of Debabrata Biswas, who is considered almost a legend in the world of Rabindra Sangeet or may be they were displayed because the interview took place in this restaurant.
Coming to the ambiance, it is just perfect whether you want to have a Adda session with your friends or want to have some together time with your loved one. The decor is minimalist yet tastefully done and the music soothing.¬† The day we visited it was the best of Rabindra Sangeet in play.
The service was a little slow and disorderly. We had to wait for almost an hour for our order. However later one of the staff clarified that they were short of staff that particular day which was the reason we had to wait so long. Only 3 staff were taking care of a full house of guests that day so that made sense.
We ordered MUD special Kolkata Mojito, Grilled MUD Sandwich, Iced Tea and Chicken Kassa with Roomali Roti. Kolkata Mojito was a slightly sweeter version of the usual Mojito but it was overall nicely done. Grilled MUD Sandiwich was tasty and Chicken Kassa was ethereal. One of the best Chicken Kassa I had in any restaurant in Kolkata in the last few years.
We will surely visit again and I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.

Situated just beside the Leather world,Gariahat triangular park. It is small but nicely decorated. Their special mud sandwich is really tasty. They have a shortage of staffs, so the order took a lot of time to reach our table. Overall a nice experience.

Mud Caf√©, situated right at the heart of Triangular Park, Gariahat beside Leatherworld. This caf√© is one where you would feel like your home. The decorations, the ambience and the backdrop takes all the glory which is playing retro classic in the background. From the security guard to the staffs all were very hospitable.

We had ordered 2 plates of Chicken Mayo Sandwich and 2 Hot Chocolate. While taking up the order the staff said "Good, standard order that's how an order should be!" We were much delighted. The Sandwich was grilled and the filling was delicious and tasty. It was accompanied with potato chips and tomato sauce and mustard.

The Hot Chocolate was as usual delicious and well decorated.

We reached there at a rainy evening after a shopping at Gariahut. Got the recommendations from Zomato for cafe. We were really hungry.

It said that 1st impression is the last impression. That actually fit for Mud. As soon. As you reached there you will feel like home from every aspect. Actually they converted Famous singer Debabrato Biswas's residence into a cafe.

They have ground floor and 1st floor. We sit at ground floor. Best thing is you will never feel like restro or cafe inside Mud. It's feel like home. The person who is manager I believe , his behavior is very good. He greets you with smile and help you to understand the menu.

Items in menu are very less actually that's good.Most restro are having 150 items and can serve only 50 out of which 20 are good. But for Mud items are less and mostly everything is available and all are taste like home.
We ordered Mud special Sandwich, Mango Vanila Shake and Mojito. For desert we ordered Mango Mousse. Foods are fresh and taste good.

They have a small window to buy hand crafted product of bengal. You can also book for birthday party , small gathering.

Overall I like the place very much. I like to visit again to feel the homely atmosphere.

Thanks Mud.

The interior of this place is really nice, very much eye soothing....it's like pure bengali cafe !! Food is just average, nothing like out of the world. We ordered mud grilled sandwich, Irish coffee and dahi chicken with rumali ruti....sandwich was just normal,dahi chicken was not at all tasty, and the rumali ruti they served,became too hard to bite. So overall I'm giving 3 out of 5.

A place hard to locate...but with food served in an ambience hard to dislike! Sholo aana bangaliyaana!! Rabindra geeti, soothing and soft, in the background, sets your mood up when you are ready to experience a plethora of snacks and shakes and many more midst a homely atmosphere. I went there with a good friend of mine and spent a pretty decent couple of hours. The mud special sandwich was as delectable as it was filling. The mojitos were really good. The frappes contain an excess amount of chocolate.....do not go for it if you have a strong coffee craving! The peach flavoured ice tea was not bad as well. And lastly we had walnut brownie with ice cream. The brownie wasnt hot, but overall it wasnt that bad. Service was good enough. The place is new...still a long way to go. And regarding the expenses......extremely pocket friendly!! A nice place for a refreshing hangout.

"Purano sei diner kotha bhulbi ki re hai O sei, chokher dekha praner kotha se ki bhola jai."

Tales of good old days how will you forget dear, Oh those love-locked eyes, is it possible to bury, never. (Translation)

This was the first thing which came to my mind as I entered this place.This place takes you to a ride of the past, makes you nostalgic of all the stories you have been hearing since your childhood from your grand parents and parents, makes you feel that you are in Calcutta of 70s and 80s.

So before I proceed further I would like to ask few questions to the readers.
When was the last time you went to a cafe with a decor of a vintage bengali house?
When was the last time you heard some lovely "Rabindra Sangeet" instead of western music in a cafe?
Or
When did you have something as innovative and crazy as "Mutton Phuchka" ?

Well, if you think for a while and get your answer as "never", which you will most probably do. You must visit this place to experience it all.

From the beautiful bengali style mattress to the chairs and tables everything matched perfectly to make the place look like an authentic bengali house. With such a decor it needs some music too. So this place doesn't disappoint in that department too. It just gives you the perfect blend of music with the decor. Rabindra Sangeet in the voice of Debabrata Biswas was being played. The ambience is just amazing, its calm, serine and one of the best place to relax without the hustle bustle of the city.
The staffs were really polite and did their job perfectly well. The smile on their face was consistent which is very important. So some brownie points for that.
Coming on to the food, I decided to order all the MUD special items. So apart from one special item (Mutton Phuchka) which was unavailable at that point of time I ordered these :

#Mud Special Kolkata Mojito: Well apart from the proportion of sweetness which is a bit on the higher side it tasted well. The leaves were crushed well and the lemon flavour was coming good.

#Grilled Mud Sandwich: The Sandwich was just too good to resist myself of not eating more and saving for my partner. I liked the equation of all the ingredients used in it. #Recommended

#Chicken Cheese Omelette : I was going for the Mutton Phuchka, but as it was not available the staff suggested me this and I was more than happy when I had my first bite. Well, this is one of the best Chicken Omelette I have ever had. The chicken with cheese inside the omelette was tasting great. A super snacks to make u happy. #Recommended

#Chocolate Mud Cake: The chocolate mud cake helped to complete the experience in a good note. It was sticky, it was warm and it was rich in chocolate, just like a mud cake should be. I loved the heart shape plates in which they serve it.

Last Words:
Well, it is very rare when I like almost everything of a place and this place counts in it. From the ambience to the food everything is just amazing here. One of my favourite cafes after my first visit. Will definitely come back to try the other dishes and specially Mutton Phuchka. Great work by every individual to make the place so good.

Located just opposite City Style and just beside Leather world this cafe is very easy to locate. This place is homely with light bengali music playing in the background and nice decor. We ordered a grilled mud sandwich, a cappuccino, fish n chips and caramel custard. The food was excellent though the custard could have been a little better. The hospitality and service was too good. And the best part is this cafe is pocket friendly. Visiting the place again.

This is a place highly recommended.
Basically a house turned into a caf√©. 
You'll get to hear authentic Bengali songs.
Very calm and homely ambiance.
We ordered for dahi chicken with rumali roti. I must tell you, they make fantastic dahi chicken. I loved it. Not spicy and has a very sweet taste.
We ordered the mud special sandwich and the Mexican sandwich. Both the sandwiches were good. They use potato chips for garnishing.
The last we ordered was the mud cake. Now this cake is soft and melts in your mouth. I absolutely loved it's taste. Please do try it.
The best part was when they asked us whether we were satisfied with the food. They even apologized if they've made any mistake.
They also gave us a complimentary coke bottle. Even the security guard near the gate was good. He accompanied us inside.
I just loved this place. Hope it remains the same. 
Kudos to the people for the amazing behaviour and service.

Well yesterday I made my mood to have a coffee Eve out after my office with my love !! So search out mud cafe
You can't believe when I step in there the ambiance is very much homely !!
I ordered veg paneer grilled sandwich,cheese corn burst sandwich along with a cappuccino and pineapple blossom.
Corn sandwich is awesome the amount of cheese was melt perfectly and it was @awesome combination, after that when I took a sip of pineapple blossom it felt like wow !!
Then we cancelled the coffee and ordered another blossom and at last I must say no one leave there without having the awesome hospitality of abhishek and there team....... a remarkable and rememberable evening!! 
Still missing the blossom at the time of reviewing...lol

This cafe is situated near Triangular Park. A 10 minutes walk from Gariahat Bus Stop. This cafe gives you a warm and homely feeling. 

The ambiance is very good with the cane furnitures and clay pots. They keep on playing Rabindra Sangeet, which gives you a 'Bangaliaana' feeling.
Now, coming to the food, we had ordered MUD Sandwich, Masala French Fries, Chocolate MUD cake, Irish coffee, cold coffee with Ice Cream, and a cappuccino. The MUD sandwich was two layered, one layer of chicken and cheese, another of egg and cheese. It came with wafers. It was good. But, I could taste the egg more than the chicken. They give 'kashondi' with all the snacks they serve. The Irish coffee we ordered wasn't really an Irish coffee looks like. The cappuccino was nicely blended. The most delicious among all the things we ordered was the MUD cake. It was too good and we felt like having more. 

They have seating arrangement both upstairs and downstairs. Upstairs is an air conditioned area, and while placing the order you need to press a bell, if they are not available upstairs. 
So, altogether our bill was around 600. And we got 2 pet bottles of Coke FREE. Currently, there is an offer going on, if your bill amount is more than 450, you will get a bottle of COKE free.

MUD!!! A new feather added to the famous hidden gems of Kolkata.. Checked in this amazing food joint with my dearest friends Avirup & Chirantani for evening adda which was a worth visit. We had Chicken cheese sandwich, cold coffee, Oreo shake, & Mud cake... All the dishes were delicious n lip-smacking.. Light Rabindrasangeet in background music added an amazing ambience n its a perfect hangout destination for besties....Its just beside the leather world at Triangular Park which is most convenient & nostalgic part is that the place was previously the residence of Famous Rabindrasangeet singer Debabrata Biswas...
Simply MUD!!! Is Rocking... MUD, MASTI & MORE!!!

Friendly staff and good food (and tea!) round the experience. The best part is that it is right on the market street for ready for the necessary break while shopping! :)

My 500th Review
************************

Tucked away in an old building right at the juncture of triangular park, this is a cafe with a difference. The name itself resonates with the theme of this joint, and is sure to tug at the heart strings of any bengali.

The food fare on offer is simple and a nice combination of bengali mukharochok snacks and continental..so you get mangser ghugni besides club sandwiches, macher chop besides virgin mojito

The ambiance and decor was so simple yet so catchy. Famous and popular movie pictures all around with artistic artifacts added all around from lampshades ,cups and classic art has set a class of its own.

USP:
-> Artistic Innovative Decor
-> Cozy Ambiance
-> Fresh, hygienic and tasty food items
-> Value for Money

**Location**
Beside the leather world showroom opposite to the city style showroom at triangular park crossing.

**Food**
I tried their special mud sandwich which did absolute justice to the price it has been offered.

Macher chop (Fish Chop)
Size was big and tasted very fresh and home like quality. I liked the bowl they presented in with it.

Special mention for the fine darjeeling tea..

Virgin mojito was also quite refreshing

Prices are kept very reasonable which is one of their USPs.

Tunes of rabindrasangeet in debabrata biswas's voice, a bit of cha, jolkhabar n adda...perfect recipe for an evening well spend.

Other reviewers properly stated its location, so i will straightly come to point. Its recommended that you must go upstairs to get the real ambience of the place. As the tag line suggest, truly the crockery, decors, wall hangings are eye catching. Coming to the food, taste is no doubt good, mainly their mud special grilled sandwich and chocolate mud cake. Constantly in the background traditional bengali songs are being played, which is soothing to the ears. Pocket punch is 350 RS for two. Staffs are friendly, and asks for their improvements. Atleast one visit is must.
P.S. They sell gift items like crockery, home decor, earnings also.

Really disappointed with this place! Dunno if its the wrong dishes that we ordered or it was just a bad day, but the food was upsetting! Ordered chicken pasta which was okay so we ordered mud special mojito (horrible) and lemongrass cooler (couldnt justify its name). Then we ordered Hawaiian salad which was simply made of overdose of bellpeppers  mixed with mayo and diced chicken. Finally came the cheese and corn sandwich but sadly we couldnt find a single corn seed in it. It was just a cheese sandwich. The service is so slow that we waited for the bill for half n hour or more.The rating it earned is only for the ambiance and free cola that we got.

A quintessential bengali cafe. If you are a 'bengali' and not a 'bong', this is the place for you. Emulating any bengali household steeped in bengali culture this small cafe won my heart and soul. I'm giving a 0.5 extra just for the ambiance. There are not many places that cam touch the bengali soul in a way that MUD can. There are so many cafes in kolkata trying their best to copy European/American styles but very few holding on to the bengali root. Kudos to MUD for that. The two story cafe with 'mora' and 'boi' , light 'robindro-sangeet' and a 'boithok-khana' ambiance is a must go for all. The staff are also very friendly and the food is great. I had a mocktail - Peach Passion Iced Tea and two kinds sandwiches - grilled chicken and mexican chicken. Everything was cheap. The iced tea was subtle and smooth; quite refreshing. The sandwiches were both delicious and came with some chips. I waiting for an opportunity to try a few other things! I'm sure this is one  place that I will be going back because it touched my heart in a special way!

Right on the Triangular Park Bus stop opposite Citi Stile, this cozy little cafe has a very unique earthy ambiance of its own. Right from the serving trays which are made out of a certain tree leaf to the mattresses they use on the floor, to the potteries (some of them are also for sale) have given a rustic flavour to the decor of the cafe. The food they offer are lip smacking and will definitely enthuse the taste buds. Their sandwiches especially the Mud Sandwich deserves mention. Its definitely a must try item of Mud. Lastly the cafe boys are very warm and friendly giving you a timely, homely and hygienic service.

The tiny entrance to Mud is very easy to miss, but its more or less opposite to the Citi Style outlet near Gariahat. 
We dropped in one evening and had their signature Mud cake along with Irish coffee. The crockeries used here blend in nicely with the rustic theme of the place. The coffee was served along with a tiny salted cookie. Even though it didn't have the distinct layers typical of an Irish coffee and was mainly plain coffee with the liquor flavour mixed in evenly, the taste was pretty fine. 
The Mud cake was soft, gooey, chocolaty with a grainy mud like texture and was absolute bliss for the taste buds. 

Overall, it's an extremely pocket friendly cafe which plates up some pretty tasty food!

Went to this Place today just few hours ago.. Situated opposite to City Style and beside Leather World Showroom near Triangular Park in Gariahat.. One main interesting and attractive thing about this Cafe is like a typical Old School Homely Feelings due to its Ambience.. It has two floors.. The Upper Floor is more beautiful than the lower with a Chilled AC and a Superb Ambience of Old Bengali Songs playing with a Woody Finishing to the Walls and Decorations.. Interior Designing is amazing.. Few Imported Things are there in Display for Sale.. Coming to the Food Joint.. We Ordered Tutti-Frutti, Cold Drink, Masala French Fries, Plain French Fries and MUD's Special Grilled Sandwich.. The Fries would have been excellent if it would have been a little more salty.. Tutti-Frutti was exceptionally well and the Best Part was the Sandwich.. Believe Me.. I was simply amazed by its Taste.. It had Cheese, Egg and Chicken fully stuffed and grilled along with some Wafers poured as garnishing that just melted in my mouth and was worth money.....!!!!! Staffs here are very good and cooperative but need to be more professional.. Water Bottles were also very unique and innovative.. Overall without Tax if you are looking for a Cheap but Best Cafe with Superb Ambience in Gariahat Area.. Just visit this Outlet and Give it a Try.. I will visit this Outlet again soon.. Keep it up..

Their Mud cake is an absolute delight, it's one of a kind. Both service and ambience is good. Although it's difficult to locate because one might miss their small gate but once you actually go there it's an amazing experience. I had a grilled mud sandwich which was decent enough and owing to the fact that it's really pocket friendly it's a great place to hang out.

Situated just opposite to City Style in Triangular park, many miss noticing it easily because it has a small gate with a little board displaying its name. We went upstairs where there's a little room with comfortable seating arrangements,playing vintage bengali songs ,with pottery showpieces at exhibition on the shelves. We ordered cheesy sandwich and two mud cakes because we had received so many recommendations for this mud cake. The sandwich was served on reusable hand made plates with hand made spoons ( I liked this thing). The mud cake turned out to be heavenly! The sandwich was served along with potato chips and kasundi sauce. It was good. Their service is quick and good hospitality. I am definitely going to revisit this place soon. :)

The place makes you feel at home once you step in with its cosy interior and soothing lights. The food is delicious and pocket friendly. The grilled sandwiches are an absolute yum and the fish and chips here us nothing short of greatness. The drinks though aren't up to the mark. The pina colada didn't have either of coconut or ice cream. The Irish coffee stands out though, it's very comforting.

Had long wanted to visit this place and finally went yesterday. Except for the fact that the service is a little slow, everything else was perfect. The cafe gives an earthen feel, the matted floor, the coffee is served in cups having interesting designs, the plates look like they're made from cane, the tables & chairs too go with the setting, on top of that u have Bengali songs being played in the background, all together the ambience is just too good. Quality of food is excellent! It's pocket friendly! We had the mud cake, mud spl sandwich, French fries, cheese&chicken omelette & fish-n-chips, and each was lip smacking! Given a chance I would again love to visit MuD!

Absolute delightful cafe. The ambience there is good. Bangaaliyana through and through. Located opposite to the Citi Style store in a small lane beside the Leather World this place has a good collection of Bengali classics on loop. The earthenware and exhibits are made of clay. The staff service is brilliant. Absolutely helpful,  quick servicing and friendly. The only problem is many of the dishes haven't yet been made available. And the pocket pinch of the rest. Anyway considering overall experience it is a must go for me.

Would love to visit again..
Parking could be a challenge as we couldn't find any parking area in front of the cafe.. So had to park behind Triangular Park..
The staff here are good..Only one negative thing, we ordered for Fish & Chips, they said they dint have yet someone who came in after us were served..
So 4.5 out of 5
Strange & Fishy!~

i have been to this place like so many times. situated just opposite to citi style at rashbehari avenue, its a must come cafe. its the appropriate place for hanging out with friends.
the place is decorated with tall lamps and the floor is covered by "madur" and the legend debabrata biswas is played all the time. the ambience is great with a village kinda theme.

~food? food is mind blowing. price is even more mind blowing. its a pocket friendly cafe with no hidden taxes.

we had grilled mud sandwich and dahi chicken with rumali roti. they tasted really awesome. especially the sandwich. actually this place is specialized in making sandwich.
we also tasted chicken burger and chicken and mayo sandwich. not to mention it was awesome as well.
the pasta was delicious too. 

if you are having any kinda fascination taking earthen pots and cups, you can find a nice collection here.

so in brief we enjoyed this place. will be visiting shortly :)

Deliciously Awesome!!! Thumbs Up for the foodies! The House of Maestro Debabrata Biswas has been marvelously decorated as a cafe and our very own 'Rabindrasangeet' offers a complete homely feeling. The 1st-floor seating area is so beautifully decorated with cane furniture and the waiters over there never interrupt your certain privacy! Price is just unbelievably cost-effective and just too delicious. A peaceful and lovely place for loners, families and couples too!

Had:
1: Chicken Mayo Sandwich - Crunchy and healthy
2: Rumali roti with Dahi Chicken - Sumptuous, less oily and yummy
3: Fresh Lime soda - Refreshing

Next time gonna try the 'MUD CAKE'!!!

Bangali?ever heard of the Late Debabrata Biswas? Yes the late singer's house has been modified into a Cafe and its definitely worthy a visit here. The mud sandwich is amazing;the taste lingers in your mouth for a long time. Mud cake is good. Never been too fond of Oreo shake and it was average.
The small place is decorated in simple manner. And they played the singer's collections (my favourite part about the Cafe!)
Its bangaliana mixed with new age trend. Go with your friends and enjoy the value for price Cafe.

A small passageway off the RB connector leads to its entrance. Once you enter, it transports you to a world of its own, with the Bengali songs in the background adding their own essence to the ambience. 
We sat on the first floor and ordered the cheese and chicken omelette (amazing), cappuccino and espresso.
It's a place where you can sit and chat for hours and their staff are one of the most courteous I've met. The service is a bit slow, but when you've got great company and a calm atmosphere, I'm not complaining.

Tucked in Rashbehari Avenue this is quaint little place. The decor is simplistic but the ambience great. The maestro Debabrata Biswas is played all the time. The sandwiches are the hands down no 1 in the menu. Sumptuous filling and great to eat. I am a lil favoured to their pineapple blossom too. Tried the mangshor and the macher chop too.

Petite place, on Rashbehari Avenue. This is perfect for sitting over a plate of snack and hanging out with friends for hours. Food? Good. Price? Even better! We sat on the 1st floor seating area; nice, quiet place.¬†
What we ordered:

1) Grilled mud sandwich: 4 slices of sandwich, very nicely done!¬†
2) Mud cake : absolutely yum!¬†
3) Walnut brownie with chocolate : melts in your mouth, except the brownie could be a little warmed¬†
4) ¬†French fries

The food is pretty good, as well as the ambiance. The service isn't the most prompt, but not much to complain about.¬†

Good place to spend some time with family or friends!¬†

Kudos!

Somehow this place defines peace. Such homely feeling. Infact we decided to sit upstairs, so we had to keep our shoes outside.. we walked about bare foot. üòÑüòÖ
Beautifully decorated with clay items. Cups n all that..
Background music, calm and soothing. So was the lighting. 
Friendly staff. 
Decent food. Can't really expect an A-class food here.. 
Chocolate mud cake. Try this once if you're a chocolate lover. Had blue lagoon and mud special kolkata mojita. Both okayish. Again, value for money. 
It was already raining outside and this place almost set the mood today. Such ambience, pretty good food and friends- 3hours spent already. Blissful. :)

A small peaceful place. Atmosphere is pretty good. The mud grilled sandwich is yummy with eggs mayo chicken and cheese in it. Another tasty item is dahi chicken with rumali roti. And definitely the best item is the chocolate mud cake. It is a treat for the chocolate lovers. Overall mud is a beautiful place with good food, pocket-friendly rates and a pleasant ambience. Will definitely visit again.

Mud is a little cozy calm and cute place to have a cup of coffee and sandwich with the smell of clay, view of beautiful potterries in display, small lanterns on every table and your ears get treated with the soulful rabindra sangeet. I love the ambience here with the wooden tables chairs and mats on the floor. While moving from ground floor to first floor, you get the flashbacks of some of the memorable and landmark movies of Bengali cinema. Staffs here are amicable and gentle. 
#MudGrilledSandwich and #MudCake is my favorite out here. I also liked #Frenchfries. On and all a good place. 
'Clay coffee conversation in a cute place' that's what MUD is.

This is a very small cafe but they are excellent. The chocolate MUD cake was good. We ordered the Mud Grilled Sandwich - which was a layer of mayo + egg, and another layer of cheese and chicken. I quite liked the crisp and soft bread which was perfectly toasted, but the filling was flat and lacked any innovation.

Interesting ambience.

Not so great food, in my experience. 

The place isn't that tricky to find. Triangular Park. Look just beside Leather World and you'll see a small sign board written MUD. Follow. It's like the adjacent wall right behind Leather World. 

Also, this place happens to be the once residence of legendary robindrosongeet singer Debabrata Biswas. Adds to the curiosity quotient, I guess. 

Once you get in, you'll be greeted with a very soothing ambience. Soft music, dim lighting. The floor is covered in Madur, a better idea than a carpet any day. It's a cosy nook for a hearty hang out. I supremely loved the ambience that they maintain here. 
They serve food in this smoothened wood bark like material (I have no clue what that's called in English), and although I am a grandma-person who loves her china plates, I liked the idea of serving food on those organic, disposable plates. It's unique and quirky. 

I had ordered Irish Latte, Fish n Chips and Chocolate MUD cake. Absolutely NOT what you should order here, except for the MUD cake. 
Coffee comes in a small-ish cup. And although I had no issues with the plate material, I wasn't comfortable with the cups. Please invest in better cups soon. The coffee itself wasn't any impressive. Very average in terms of aroma or taste. But it came piping hot. That's comforting. :) 

The fish and chips is a sad business. The fillet of fish was thinner than paper. I'd rather pay more for a fish and chips with generous chunks of fish. If they wanna keep the prices low, that's very much appreciable. But they should keep those things off the menu which they cannot serve within that pricing range. Very disappointing. 

The chocolate MUD cake was gooood. Gooey, chocolatey. Considering that it comes in 60bucks, it's pretty good

Service is very slow. I didn't mind because I was having a good time. But it's painstakingly slow nevertheless. 

If I do come back and order something wiser that time and find it praise worthy, I'd love to edit this review and give more stars. :) 

Anyway, great ambience. Do visit when your pocket is in crisis but you need a cosy corner to spend some quality time with your loved ones.

A hidden gem in the Rashbehari Avenue area! The interior on the first floor is really soothing. With a touch of antique, the array of cups and mugs, the mat cladded floor and the classical music set the mood to have a long conversation with your friends and family over a collection of beverages and some unique and delicious finger food.

Today being mother's day and  25'e Boishak, I thought it would be apt for me to take my mom and my sister to this awesome place- MUD. 
My mom, being a calm person enjoyed the serene atmosphere thoroughly. The place being cosy and no unnecessary hustle bustle. 
The food was very good (we ordered Fish Chop for mom, Corn and Cheese Busrt sandwich along with Oreo Shake and Cold Coffee with ice cream for mom). 
Needless to mention, the food is very good. Perfect in taste, matching with the ambience. 
 I recommend this place for those who want to spend some quality time away from the hustle hustle and  noises. Gives mental serenity. 

And since it was Mother's day, but Cold Coffee at MUD cafe was complimentary.  The gesture was very nice and made my Mother'sDay a memorable one :-)

I turned up here with Maa, coincidentally on Pochishe Boishakh, which was a great day to listen to songs by Debabrata Biswas (whose erstwhile house Mud has transformed into a cafe) and settle in with some summer coolers.

The ambience is pretty crisp - bamboo mats on the floor, a few posters of Biswas and Ray movies et al., and gives a good vive overall for general hangout. The staff is friendly.

We ordered the Mud Grilled Sandwich - which was a layer of mayo + egg, and another layer of cheese and chicken. I quite liked the crisp and soft bread which was perfectly toasted, but the filling was flat and lacked any innovation. The cheese was processed (and hence lacked much flavour), and the mayo was either packaged or made in-house but was basic mayo without any added flavour. Bland cheese + bland mayo + bland egg + bland chicken created an extremely flat taste and even the kasundi-ketchup dip couldn't help much. I would have much preferred some acidity (through veggies) or some seasoning (through flavoured spiced mayo). Also, the potato chips didn't taste fresh.

In coolers, I had a Peach Blossom iced tea which didn't have any tea flavour. Maa had a cold coffee which had a bitterness of the coffee and was perhaps the best offering of our meal.

Location: Triangular park. Opposite Citi styles. Beside leather world(I've attached a picture fir reference),

The watchman at the gate escorted us down the aisle and into the cafe. We chose to sit on the first floor.

D√©cor and ambience : Lovely ambience. Sift Rabindra sangeet playing in the background and with the decorations and all, this place has a homely vibe to it.

The staff was extremely polite and courteous. You'll be treated as a guest to it's truest sense.

Food: We had the Grilled Mud sandwich, Dahi chicken with rumali roti, Choco mud cake.

The sandwich was enormous, was served in four pieces, garnished with potato chips and served with 'kasundi' and ketchup. One layer had sliced boiled eggs and the other layer had grilled chicken(both the layers contained mayo and cheese). Tasted pretty good.

The dahi chicken was very simple in terms of flavour and almost a bit sweet but the taste was awesome. Huge chunks of chicken in ample quantity was served with 3 rumali rotis. The chicken pieces were tender and succulent( I've attached a picture to demonstrate the same). It was delicious.

The Mud cake is basically a Choco lava cake. Molten centre giving way to silky smooth oeey gooey chcolate-y awesomeness. It sure  I a perfect way to end you meal. Loved it.

Pocket pinch is on the lower side. Plus you pay what you see. No added tax.

Don't forget to ask for the password of the wifi.

Highly recommended!

PS- the menu provided here isnit updated in terms of pricing and items. I've attached a picture of the present menu. Cheers!

Stumbled upon this neat little cafe while searching for a decent place to hangout. Located at a prime spot in Deshapriya Park, this place is a good option. It has a space crunch, but makes up for it with the homely decor which is very original, in my opinion. The staff is friendly. 
Coming to the food, I've had the chance of trying only the beverages here. The cold coffee was on spot. Another drink called the Blue Lagoon was good, but probably a tad bit too sweet.
All in all, great place for a causal evening teamed with good food and ambiance.

Located bang opposite to City Styles Mall at Triangular Park and just beside Leather World. It‚Äôs a narrow lane where they have put up the board for entrance.
MUD covers two floors. The ambience is super awesome, its beautifully decorated small cosy place to visit and relax and spend time with the near and dear ones with soothing Bengali music in the background . The food is also good. Their Dahi Chicken , Bhetki fish n chips, Pina Colada ‚Äì The mocktail was fresh and refreshing and tasty. Their mud sandwich deserves special mention.
All in all, a good place to hang around with friends, nice food and easy on the pocket as well. No extra taxes, be it VAT, Service Charge or Service Tax. The staffs are very efficient and cooperative.

MUD. The name attracted me to visit the place.
I came across MUD on a Sunday morning in the 'Robbar' magazine (a Pratidin venture) and decided to visit the place that day itself. MUD was the house of rabindrasangeet singer Debabrata Biswas.
It was not difficult to locate the place as it is situated in the main road just opposite to Citi Styl, Triangular Park. As I entered with a group of three, a humble guy welcomed us.¬†
They have both upper and lower sitting arrangements but we preferred sitting upstairs. We really appreciated the decor as it has a perfect homely touch. The essence of Satyajit Ray's movies and the background songs of Biswas added to the flavour.¬†
Coming to food, we opted for Mud Grilled Sandwich with a small pot of Darjeeling tea. We enjoyed the sandwich but we felt it was a bit over-priced!
Last but not the least, I like MUD as MUD gives the real feel of loving your city - 'Bhalobashar arek naam Kolkata'.
I'll visit MUD for the homely atmosphere.

Went to this place on Friday. Beautiful ambience with Rabindrasangeet in the background.  The decoration is nice with an old Bengali laid back charm.  Loved the chairs. Water was served in a really cute bottle. We ordered mud grilled chicken sandwich and chocolate mud cake. The sandwich came with potato fries and was lip smacking. The mud cake was a sinful delight. A must recommend for those who love chocolates. Loved the service and stuff behaviour as well.  No extra taxes.

I visited MUD today and after quite some time I found an impressive place to spend time. It's a narrow lane where they have put up the board for entrance. One of my friend took long time to locate the place. Nevertheless, once located, it's worth it. 

All I got to know is , this place was the house of rabindrasangeet singer, Debabrata Biswas. Background songs are all his songs that they play. Presently, it's Mr. Abhishek who owns the place. Sitting arrangement is there in the ground floor but we preferred sitting upstairs.

You kind of feel home out here. We were there to spend sometime and get rid of the afternoon heat. We had an intention of getting outside cake for birthday celebrations which they also had approved of but due to lack of enthusiasm I decided to add candles to the sandwiches. 

We opted for chicken sandwich, cheese sandwich, special MUD sandwich and Oreo cool drink. They have a very neat and short menu and the choices we made were good. I don't like the sides of sandwiches. Next time I'm gonna tell them to cut it off. 

They don't ask you to pay any vat/ service tax. You pay what you see.ü§ì The free WIFI is something which means a lot to me. The AC was really working well. They provided us complimentary cold drink too.

I liked the light shade and ambience of this place. I suggest to visit this place for all who haven't been here.

happy eating. :)

The MUD. 
The name catches the attention, right when you come across it. Whenever someone mentioned the name, the image of a perfectly bleeding MUD cake blurred my visions.¬† This meant I could no longer withhold a visit. So I picked up a friend and dashed him to MUD with me today. Took us a bit of time, to locate it, though we were standing on the same footpath. The entrance is too narrow to be noticed among huge stores on either side. The place needs a bigger board, if possible. Yet, soon enough we were inside, thanks to the courteous security guard.

We ordered a coke, a peach passion, a plate of fish and chips, a plate of fries and definitely the MUD cake to bring the small meal to a sweet end. 

There is nothing much to say about the coke. The peach passion was average. 

The Fish and Chips:

The Fish and chips was a basic fish fry, served with an apt portion of fries. It also came with accompaniments such as the Bangali‚Äôs favorite kasundi, ketchup (which I believe, good food does not require) and mayonnaise. The fish fry tasted okay, had good tang and spice. Well fried, also. 

The Fries:

The Fries were a delight. They were fried to golden perfection and perfectly seasoned. We ended up loving the seasoning on the fries. 

The MUD Cake:

The favorite part of the visit was the Mud Cake. The gooey, thick chocolate filled my mouth and heart with delight. I scraped the bowl clean, while fellow adults on tables beside me, watched with astonishment, and some with sheer glee.

Three suggestions:

1)¬†¬† ¬†It takes nothing to use, black straws. They boost the appearance of the beverages by quite a few notches, especially when you are not doing anything extra to present them better (which is fine).

2)¬†¬† ¬†It will be great if you allow the guest to be a part of the theatrics involved of putting an incision through the mud cake and watching the chocolaty goodness bleed through it. Some people live for that kind of stuff. 

3)¬†¬†¬† Please check whether your plates/bowls are broken or not, before serving. 

All in all, a good place to hang around with friends, nice food and easy on the pocket as well.

The most significant part of this cafe is the peaceful ambience. With rabindrasangeet sang by Debabrata Biswas being played across the two floors, this place has a really comforting atmosphere. The waiters are courteous and polite and the food quality is worth a mention. All in all this is a cafe I would love to visit often be it alone, or with friends. The serene atmosphere along with the connection to the roots, to bangla, to rabindranath, this place is simply "chomotkar."

Located at the main road, mud has got an ethnic inner ambience. It was the home of popular rabindra Sangeet singer now modified into a restaurant with huge ethnicity. They use utensils which we take time to look into and understand which are purchased from kerala. Huge degree of thoughts involved to present this place. A very comfortable and cozy place to visit and relax and spend time with the near and dear ones. The staffs are very efficient and cooperative. The service is also prompt. Their hospitality is also heart whelmimg. The food is also good. Their mud sandwich deserves special mention. üòÉ

MUD => Modern Urban Desi's?

This is probably the only catch which comes into my mind. Every name has a mystery behind it, and so does every place has a history behind them! This place is no exception. Legend goes, that the legendary Rabindrasangeet singer, the Late great Debabrata Biswas had this place as his residence. This fact, although may seem trifle to the modern growing generation who have grown up in the realm of Hip Hop and Rock, the same is more than enough to tickle the senses of a relatively elder generation who still knew what relationship an audio cassette had with a pencil or a pen or how Sony Walkman was the only thing we craved more than an artificial sweet ciggerrate.¬†

Truth be told, such places remains veiled from the hustle and bustle of modern ages. Had it not been for Zomato, many of us would have been aware of its existence and I sincerely thank Zomato for the same. Located bang opposite City Styles Mall at Triangular Park and just beside Leather World, this is probably a part of the ground floor and first floor of a house converted to a no-frill 'Adda Zone'. I hate to use the word 'Cafe' here (maybe I will in due course), but the realistic existence of this place is more to serve as a place to engage in long and unadulterated talks without having to step into the artificial surroundings of the outer world. The atmosphere, the serenity, the peacefulness imbibed in the surrounding here will make you feel homely.

As you would reach in front of the gates, you should be finding a security guard who would gladly accompany you till the end of the narrow lane which leads to this cafe. Even if you are entering into the narrow lane all alone, remember to walk till the end and then look for the last doorway to your right. As you step forward, you should be able to see, some photoframes being displayed on the boundary wall to the left. Pretty much gives you an idea about the simplicity of the place you are about to walk into.

MUD covers two floors. While the ground floor has the kitchen and a television set, I belief the first floor doesn't have separate provision for them. I have had made two visits here, but for both the instances, I chose to sit on the ground floor. The open kitchen falls to your left, while in front of you, you would see 4-5 wooden tables along with wooden chairs placed at a good distance from one another.

The staff here are super-friendly and amicable. The first time I had walked in, these guys were running understaffed. For a good 10-15 minutes, there was no one to pay attention to me. No handing over of menu cards or noting down the order. It was only when I had to call someone, that they noticed the sheer annoyance in my tone. One of them was courteous enough to come forward and apologize for their mistake. He humbly accepted their fault and assured me that this was a one-off case and had happened because they were dealing with a lot of pressure due to absence of their cook and some other staff and that such instances will never happen again.

I was in no hurry and didn't mind the lapse. Ordered for a Oreo Shake and Fish Fry for dine-in and Dahi Chicken for take-away. The dine-in order, as expected took a good 35-40 minutes to be served. I must accept here, that I didn't like the Fish Fry much. Although a bit crispy, it was way fluffy. The fish was not at all soft and I didn't like the Masala inside it. It looked quite evident that this was prepared long time back and was just heated up in the oven. The Oreo Shake on the other hand, was one of the best I have ever had. Thick chocolaty consistency served in good quantity, it was alone sufficient to fill my hunger. The Dahi chicken for take-away was 'homely'. Just the simple mom-made chicken which we usually have at home. No excess masala or marination. Although, the chicken was a bit hard, again just like several middle class family will usually have them for lunch.

For my second visit, I ordered for a Mutton Ghugni and Kit-Kat Shake. The Ghugni was perhaps already prepared and was served in within 5-10 minutes. Perfectly boiled Kabuli Chanas with small strips of mutton mixed with it. Good consistency and sufficient quantity. Onion and Dhania were served separately. If I were asked to change anything here, I would probably have more Mutton strips added to it, or relatively larger chunks of mutton. Also, sprinkling of 'Bhaja Masala' is what was really missing here.¬†The Kit-Kat Shake, just like Oreo Shake was heavenly. Rich chocolaty consistency, the shake kept getting heavenly as the chocolate started dissolving. They also serve you with a spoon, to scoop out the Kit-Kat portions, in whole.¬†

You pay here what you see. No extra taxes, be it VAT, Service Charge or Service Tax. The atmosphere is simple with soft Rabindrasangeet songs being sung by the legendary Debabrata Biswas. The staffs are humble and polite. The entire ambiance speaks widely or the cult movies we Bengalis so deeply admire. Be it Pother Panchali or Jolsaghar, there is an essence of Bangaliana infused and imbibed into every stone of wall and every air we breathe. If you want better quality food, this is not the place for you. If you want to cut short your visit and want superfast response time, this is also not the place for you. But, if you want to get lost in the good old days, when 'Adda' meant sitting for hours with your buddies or be it along enjoying just being you, this is certainly the place you should come to!

Visited this place twice.The place is just opposite to City Style, beside Leather World. Formerly the cafe was the residence of famous bengali singer Debabrata Biswas. This is certainly a homelike place with soothing rabindra sangeet playing in the background. Staffs out there are very polite. The food is good but nothing extraordinary except a few. The dishes which I have tried are as follows :

#Pina Colada - The mocktail was fresh and refreshing.

#Blue Lagoon - The mocktail was colourful and refreshing with right amount of punch.

#Cappuccino - Just the way I prefer it.

#Darjeeling Pot - I'm not a tea person, still it was good to my taste buds.

#Grilled mud sandwich - This double layered sandwich tasted divine. 

#Chocolate mud cake - As the name suggests this one is a simple yum mud cake.

#Chicken and mayo sandwich - This one tasted okay. 

Overall it's a very good place to hang out with friends and family. Being a pocket friendly one this place is ideal for school and college goers. :)

This is a quite small place located near rashbehari. Just opposite to city style. The place is quite cosy and comfortable. Very nice ambience i must say.the best part being a tv that plays sports channel if an important match is going on just like today's derby. 
The food is good . The hot chocolates were fine .sandwitch was yummy and the mud cake was out of this world. I will definitely visit this place again not only because of thr food but also for the service.the waitors are extremely friendly.and there are complimemtary candies on every table. So i would refer this place to my friends and relatives.

Discovered this caf√© here in zomato and visited it today. Located just opposite to City Style in Triangular Park, this small yet beautifully cozy place has the perfect ambience! As we entered, the friendly staffs led us to the little cute cabin on the first floor. The muffled Bengali songs, lovely decorations and the tranquility are sure to give you a soothing experience. A perfect place for romantic dates as well as for hangouts! Coming to the food, we ordered pina colada, grilled mud sandwich and chocolate mud cake. The first two were average. The mud cake though! It was chocolaty and gooey and yummy and an absolute treat for chocolate lovers! The food would get Mud a 3.5 but because of the ambience, it's worth a 4.0!

A small cute cafe where you could run after tedious shopping! 
I have a very bad experience the day I visited it, I found the staffs to be extremely rude and not at all hospitable. By far the worst attitude I have seen in a long time.
 Called for a chicken rezala with rumal roti.... The chicken was really hard and chewy. The gravy tasted ok. The roti was overdone.
Lemongrass cooler- had no taste of lemon grass, seemed like masala cold drink! 
 Would never go back.

One of my friend suggested me to come here and try their pineapple blossom and fish chop.  After having it we ordered more as the food was too good. We further had peshwari chicken and cold coffee with ice cream. My brother loved their cold coffee very much. Another thing which I liked very much about this cafe is their staff. They were very polite and cooperating...their service was fast too. It is a fine place for hangout. Everything was perfect...the ambience, their food, the staffs....so it is a must visit one.

But I would advise people not to have their Blue Lagoon.Because its anything but Blue Lagoon.Practicaly shitty.

Yesterday just after completing our shopping needed a coffee badly  and I recollected this place and there I was.

Been here twice and fallen in love with it. The Oreo shake here is very thick and tastes amazing, served in a tall glass garnished with crushed oreos. Totally worth the 110 bucks it costs. The chicken and mayo sandwich is okayish, nothing great though, but considering the price, it works fine. The chocolate mud cake is heavenly and is a must try. The prices mentioned in the menu are including taxes, so you pay as much as written. Went here on Valentine's Day with 3 other friends, and we were served complimentary cupcakes and chocolates. Such a lovely gesture! Definitely going back again.

Last evening we stepped into this place.It was not very cumbersome to locate..A tiny lane just beside leather world(opposite city style,triangular park).
Well,what to say...I am simply in love with this cafe.This place has a nonchalant feeling.. As it wasn't much crowded we preferred to seat to the first floor..On entering we felt an extremely homely and soothing ambience..Decoration was eye catchy..

Coming to the food-we ordered chicken and mayo sandwich,Mud cake,Ice cream with brownie and cold coffee..and on being suggested by a staff, we ordered Mud special sandwich(which we didnot like).
Chicken and mayo sandwich was amazing. Mudcake was an absolute delight.. Ice cream with brownie and cold coffee tasted good.

Staffs were extremely courteous and friendly. you can come with friends and seat as long as you want..And by the way they play music other than Rabindra Sangeet too.

Bottom line is-It's a hidden gem and a cafe with such a pocket friendly budget considering the quality and quantity they serve..
Highly recommended....

I loved it.
While roaming hopelessly on the crowded streets of Gariahat, my friend recommended me this place. We went there and had the famous MUD cake and boy did I love it.
We sat there for almost three hours and had several things in between like cakes, soft drinks, the ambiance, finally concluding with coffee, a latte and a cappuccino.
It is pocket friendly, has a lovely decor and fantastic music collection though the same playlist was played thrice in a loop. :P

My suggestion: Play Rabindrasangeet by George da only, in both the floors. His graceful baritone voice and that twist in Rabindrasangeet will add to the whole thing.

Value for money, is the thought I came out with from this place. The cozy and homely ambiance is unique.

Food: We had cappuccino, Mexican chicken, Mexican paneer and mud special grilled sandwiches which tasted pretty good for the price. We concluded with brownie n ice cream and mud cake both quite good in quantity and quality. The brownie felt a little dry though .

Service: Top notch..they have a wireless bell if u are sitting upstairs. The place is small so no issue getting staff attention. Friendly and helpful staff.

Ambiance: One of the better ambiance offered at this price range. Rabindra sangeet in the backdrop and random pottery art on the walls looks great with the yellowish lighting scheme. They have also a model kitchen u can see in my pics. The spread might seem a bit small. They have nifty table mats n coasters, very ethnic and Bengali feel for the tables.

Verdict: Must visit for all age groups. It's great a location with reasonable prices and good food.

MUD cafe is situated just beside the Leather world in triangular park inside a very narrow alley which for a split second reminded me of diagon alley of the Harry Potter series literally. The security guard escorted me to the main entrance since its a little difficult to find it all by myself . The ambience makes one nostalgic as it gives a feel of age old baithak khana with soulful rabindra sangeet playing at a soothing pitch with dim light. The interior is decorated very beautifully with cult classics of famous Bengali movies hanging against the walls and exquisite wooden furnitures and frames with aroma of coffee all over the place . Food is very tasty and sumptuous specially the Mexican chicken sandwich, the mudcake and the walnut brownie with ice cream. One notable factor is that the tray in which they served the food and the coffee along with the spoon are all made of bamboo which will definitely fetch some brownie points . Overall a very nice place to spend the evening with friends amidst a traditional bengali cafe . Thoroughly recommended !!! With

Quite a well designed cafe in Gariahaat...
The interior decoration is just awesome with floor designed with hand made mats...wall paintings...it actually plays Rabindrasangeet in background... Making the ambience perfectly soothing.
We ordered chicken hotdogs, grilled chicken sandwich, and a coffee. Every one of the items were delicious.
Loved the place.

I visited this place after a several times of suggestion from my friend. And thats when i found out its totally worth visiting this place. So much privacy and nice homely ambience and nice hospitality from the staffs. And food, its too good. The mexican chicken sandwich is probably one of the best of their dishes. I loved the caramel cheese cake too. And the cold coffee was good. A nice place to be visited again and again and again. Just one thing i dint like much was the background music... I mean yeah its good. But rabindrasangeet requires a mood to be listened to. Not all the time am in a mood for that.

Located beside leather world at triangular park, mud is one of the newest addition to the city's foodscape. With its small space and earthen interior, this place has some great food to offer. We had fish n chips, chicken mayo sandwich, Darjeeling tea and their speciality, the mud cake. All the items were very tasty indeed. The behaviour of the staff was courteous. Only drawback noticeable was delay in serving the food. For everything else, mud seems to be the new competition to  wise owl & other contemporaries located in the same area.

"MUD"- The name itself feels so earthy and clayey.... So this cafe in triangular park is a shelter from the hustle bustle of the street next to it... the peaceful environment, the decor of the cafe, the playing debabrata biswas songs all makes this cafe so attractive that this is my 25th visit to this cafe... this cafe also provides u with free wifi which can be helpful as well...I have tasted almost everything from here.. the foods are quite pocket friendly and tasty.. the staffs are very friendly and nice... so this cafe is a complete thumps up! Well done guys.. :) :)

It has a really small entrance so it's not noticeable. But it has a nice ambience and an old-Calcutta feel.
The walnut brownie with ice cream, chocolate mud cake and cold coffee is really great. I've usually seen that chocolate cakes in caf√©s are too sweet for my liking, but this mud cake was delicious, soft and warm.

Also, an unexpected advantage? Free wifi!

A small Bengali styled cafe at Triangular Park. Visited quite a number of times for its cheap food and coffee. I'm not much of a fan of rabindrasangeet however considering it is an eminent singer's residence, it is appreciated that they play his music. Staff is very courteous and serves well. Really pocket friendly.

At last!
Read about it from my Zomato friend Abhishek Kundu's account and I was bent on visiting this joint since last year. Today I finally got the chance. A tiny lane just beside Leather World. The security guard realised what I was looking for and escorted me to its main door. As I passed by, I noticed the tastefully created mud wall. The cafe is two storied. We were escorted upstairs. We passed by beautiful potteries and a small corner where some jewelleries and potteries are displayed for sale. 
We entered the sitting area where the floors were covered with mats and wicker chairs greeted us. They presented us with a beautifully sealed bottle for drinking and two paper glasses accompanying it. Then for the menu. I opted for hot chocolate while my friend opted for Darjeeling tea. I also ordered a mud cake.
The beverages arrived first in bamboo tray with bamboo spoon. Something not experienced before. I liked my hot chocolate, but my friend did not much like it. For him it was bland.
Then for the mud cake. It is a melted chocolate pastry accompanied by two bamboo spoons. It was delicious.
The room was adorned with beautiful pictures. Such a small room but they have organised it in such a way that lots of people can comfortably sit there. The background of Rabindrasangeet added to the satisfaction of our souls.

It's entrance can put question marks in your mind but as soon as you enter the small but nicely done caf√© you will be happily amazed. There are two floors and both have seating arrangements that  feels like you are in your own cozy den. The interior s is done simple and the food is good.

So this cozy little cafe is located right beside the letherworld shop in triangular park, gariahat and is easy to spot. The area seems to be really small initially but is fairly big considering there are two floors with ample seating arrangements. Designed and decorated beautifully, this place has a very calm feel to it. Light lights and very earthern colors are the base and very pretty bulbs and visuals. We took the first floor to settle ourselves down and as soon as we entered, we were totally taken aback by the somewhat traditional makeover. Jute chairs, jute Carpets, ethnic show pieces, cermaics, porcelain items, cups, saucers, beautiful lights and everything!! The best part of this place is that it is totally environment friendly.. So you get served on thin wooden dishes, get water is disposable thermocol cups, and even the stirring spoons are made of thin wood !! And that is just brilliant. There is also a small store on the first floor where environment friendly merchandize such as decoratives, cups, bowls, bag, etc can be purchased at very reasonable prices. The service was very friendly, very hospitable and warm. Food came super fast yet very fresh and the people there were extremely kind and courteous.
The food is AWESOME. portions are huge and the quality is worth a recommendation. Beverages are superb too. The Irish coffee was especially good and so was the Oreo shake. Basically everything that is on the menu is off the record awesome. The price is ridiculously low for such quality and quantity of servings and makes this place an absolute must visit for each and every person!

We were looking for a place to catch up with each other and turned to Zomato for help, and that was how we found this gem of a place. Formerly the residence of legendary singer Debabrata Biswas, it is situated in a little lane right next to the Leather World showroom in Triangular Park. Inside, you will find little cosy tables and Debabrata Biswas' Rabindrasangeet playing in the background. If you are choosy about songs, "Ashar, kotha hote aaj peli chhara" may sound odd in the middle of winter, but the general ambience is so beautiful, you will be prepared to overlook that trifle.
The food is quite good and presented really well. I will recommend the grilled mud sandwich. The staff are friendly and efficient. Overall, this cafe is a perfect place to chat with friends on a lazy afternoon and quite pocket friendly.

MUD seriously? That is the name of the Cafe?
Well I was curious and highly interested in going for an soir√©e with two dear friends for this place holds another trivia... It was where the legendary rabindrasangeet artiste Debarata Biswas resided. And keeping in tune with this the music of the Cafe is solely the lovely songs sung by this singer...
But that is not all that is great about this place.... The food is rather good too.... Though the coffee comes from one of those machines and is not barista made, the tea was very good.... Good quality Darjeeling much better then what most caf√©s serve ...
We ordered the Mud special grilled sandwich... Egg, chicken, mayonnaise... Match made in heaven... Well toasted... That is how I like it, French fries and Fish and chips which was basically our Bengali fish fry .... Well marinaded and tad spicy but nice....
I shall definitely go back again.... The ambience is awesome.... The food rather good and the staffs amiable....
THE LOCATION OF THE CAFE IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE LEATHER WORLD ON RASHBEHARI AVENUE TRIANGULAR PARK. DO NOT BE MISLEAD....
Pocket pinch.... Very moderate.Sayantani Sen @sayantani

A very cosy and homely ambience is what awaits you once you walk into this place. A little difficut to locate initially, MUD is located close to Triangular Park, opposite Citi Style and next to Leather World. The decor is excellent. The menu has variety...ranging from grilled sandwiches to Mutton Ghugni to Chicken Rezala. We ordered Grilled Mud Sandwich, Chicken Tikka Sandwich, Mutton Ghugni and Flowering Green Tea. Found the Tikka Sandwich to be the best.....actually mind blowing. The others were good too. Flowering Green Tea actually flowers in front of you.... Innovative indeed. They have a store too where you can procure some good stuff (esp. Crockery).
A little peep into the history of the place and we got to know that this was the residence of the legendary Bengali singer Debabrata Biswas.
A very good experience. Service was exceptional. We ordered some stuff for home and on our way out we forgot to collect it. The Floor in Charge was very kind to rush on to the street to hand it over to us....a good example for all in this industry.
I give it a fiver to keep up the good work....hope they keep innovating and improving.

It's a bit tough to find this. One should get down at Kalighat and take an auto towards Gariahat and keep looking for it. It's near a Samsonite store and has a banner ourtside it's tiny lil lane which leads to the caf√©. But it's certainly worth the hassle.

Two storeyed but not that big, this place makes up for it. Nice, tidy and homely decor and lovely staff. Loved the guys out there. 

We ordered Chicken Mayo Sandwiches, a Fish dish and Mud cakes, which is believed to be it's speciality. They gave chips with the sandwiches and they were divided into four small parts filled with mayo and Chicken. The Fish dish looked like a fish fry but was really different and good. The Mud cakes were the best really, looks a lot like Choco lava cakes but they're not really so. Hot chocolate and a bit harder on the outside, these are a must have. Am telling you.

Affordable and a lovely caf√©, am definitely coming back. The only suggestion I would like to give is, serve the food faster if possible. Otherwise it was a lovely experience.

Had been noticing the Glow Sign for quite some times because of the unique name 'Mud' which but somehow couldn't manage to take a break at the place until last Saturday (12th Dec 2015). Went there to catch up with my bestie. The narrow lane leading to the cafe adds unique definition to the cafe and I was overtly impressed. Just as we entered, we could hear Rabindra Sangeet by an old familiar voice, it was George Biswas's. One of the cordial staff asked us to explore the first floor which also hold seating arrangement. A neat staircase led us upstairs. My immediate expression was a 'wow'.. because of the floor which was covered with "madoor" , the bamboo mats. The Chairs and Tables were made of Cane and each Set was different. One of the staffs walked to us and politely said that he would be coming after sometime to take the order allowing us to drink in the coziness of that place. We ordered french fries and Chicken Cheese Omelet to snack upon. The food was very good but it turned better as it was served in plates made from sheaths of Supari (betel nuts) Leaves. There were small lanterns placed at each table. after we savored every bit of what we ordered, we asked for the bill that was to be payed downstairs but the staff who had been serving us requested us to take our time and finish our chitchats.. I was very impressed by that gesture. Downstairs the bill was served rolled in a tiny porcelain basket which added to the final score. The staff greeted us cordially and being confirmed that it was our first visit, mentioned that this place was actually the residence of late George Biswas which has been remodeled into 'Mud'. Shall be visiting this place soon and more often.

We hopped in a little late at around 9,the cafe was about to close and thus we had to order some quick bites. We tried the Mexican Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken and Cheese Grilled Sandwich,both of which tasted excellent. I also loved the simple and elementary decor and the earthen feel to the place,thus adequately justifying its name. The artefacts and items up for sale are beautiful and quite reasonably priced. However,given its ambience,I'd suggest the inclusion of low seating. It could lend a more relaxed mood to the place and make it perfect for adda.

Was unaware of this cafe. Went there yesterday after being suggested by one of my friends. On checking Zomato, I found that the MUD grilled sandwich was something everyone was talking about. So we ordered it instantly without a second thought. And trust me it is one of the best sandwiches I ever had. The taste of smashed eggs along with chicken was just heavenly. The sandwich was big enough to satisfy our appetite and chips were served with it as well. Wanted to try their Special Mango Shake, but it wasn't available. The waiters were courteous. The place is decorated nicely with Rabindra sangeet being played in the background. Many household items are also available for sale. Moreover, they don't charge you for taxes. So if you are looking for a cafe within a very low budget, then I will suggest you this one. Overall a nice experience!

Atleast Debabrata Biswas lives in your initiative. 
Could have razed it down like many other places in and around the locality. 
Pity, no none preserved his abode for the generations to come.

Just after you enter the cafe, you will hear songs from Debabrata Biswas in background. We stepped up to the upstairs and there was a neatly decorated place to accommodate 15-20 people. The cane chairs I found too cool and it completely matched with the overall interior. The staffs over there were well behaved. We ordered cappuccino, chocolate mud cake, chicken n cheese sandwich. Literally I didn't find any cons in their food but the only thing I want to suggest is to increase the number of items. Like they can introduce some snack items with chicken and fish. A mouthful and pleasant experience I got from there and that's why I'll visit Mud very soon. Best of luck :)

We were directed upstairs in a room with limited seating arrangement. The d√©cor is simple and the service is appreciable. They sell hand-crafted items too like bags and clay utensils. Their presentation of food is unique as it's served in hand made wooden and clay containers. We ordered the special mud sandwich, fish n chips and cappuccino. Coffee was nice and the sandwich was excellent but the fish n chips was a big letdown. It's the bengali fish fry and it has a negligible fillet of fish thinly coated. Being a lover of fish fries, I was rather disappointed. The overall experience is good though. The sandwich saved the day.

I finally went to MUD after two or  three unsuccesful  attempts and was fully  enchanted. The ambiance is cozy, peaceful , and homely. Food is excellent. Staff are friendly. Would definitely like to visit again on my next visit to Kolkata.

I loved Mud. It reminded me of that iconic song "Tomake Chai".

Its earthy. Its cozy. Its friendly. 

The food is made with a lot of care and tastes good. The drinks supplements the food. 

Step into it with your current sweetheart, newly wed wife, much married wife, ex flame, new flame and make memories. It is also a perfect place to have an adda with , new friends, old friends and long lost friends. 

The old world charm along with the muted music create an ambience which transport you to an island of calm from the bustle outside.

The hand made pottery selection above is delicate and artistic. I am sure the collection will find patrons easily.

After walking for hours visiting puja pandals needed a place to rest my feet and some cold beverage.
On my way to Deshapriya Park accidentally found this place.
I was accompanied by my family and so I chose not to go to the 1st floor and sit in the ground floor.
Cozy surrounding with Debabroto Biswas's songs playing softly in the background, it was just what I needed.
We ordered 2 cold coffee and 1irish coffee and a Mud special sandwich. The food was yummy and good and was available at an affordable price.
The people around were friendly, gave us a brief history about the place and also requested us to go and see the decor upstairs which was also warm and cozy.
Overall it is a nice place to sit,sip and maro Adda!!

So, decided to try this place out for a date. And boy was it good ! The decor is nice and earthy , like the name of the place suggest, and even though the place does appear a bit cramped, the seating is arrangement is good and comfortable. We ordered a Cappuccino, an Ice Coffee, regular fries, Chicken and Cheese omelette and a Chocolate mud cake. The Ice Coffee and Cappuccino were really nice , the fries and the omelette was regular, nothing special, but did taste good. I also liked their idea of giving a 'kashundi' dip with the fries along with the regular ketchup ! The best part about this place is the shaanti with which you can talk to your heart's content, without the rush of getting out asap because of a huge queue. The staff is nice and friendly and service too is good. All in all, a great place for an extraordinary adda session with good tea(for the blue blooded Bengalis and coffee (for the not so blue blooded Bongs) and some nice snacks.

Had been planning for some time and finally ended up at MUD in Puja holidays. Its nice cozy cafe situated near triangular park ( next to Leather World ). Loved the informal ambience with earthen touch everywhere. The lighting was balanced with relaxed atmosphere.
Had a nice green tea followed by Grilled Paneer sandwich ¬†and MUD sandwich Grilled. Balanced and well grilled sandwich and we ended with lovely cappuccino. The pricing was reasonable. Overall Good and relaxed experience. Kolkata surely needs few more of these.
Also, the hand crafted pottery on sale is very nice and unique - quiet different from what you see around. Tried to resist for long but finally ended up buying quiet a few things.

Making it breif , this pretty small place with two tiers located next to leather world triangular park failed to impress us much as expecting from the raving reviews and a massive 4.3 zomato rating. The decor is simple n basic , with earthern touch of bengal few mud pots arranged in wall shelves and 'madoor' flooring , debabrata biswas's songs playing in background , pretty nice for a quiet soothing and refreshing afternoon. The servers are very very polite and friendly but what dissapointed us was the food! Tagedy . The prices initially seemed to be on the lower side but not so once we had a glimpse of the quantity. The menu lacks any stuffy thing except for sandwiches and burgers. We had the OREO SHAKE which was passable and KITKAT SHAKE which was unbearable , overtly sweet and milky with half a strip of kitkat floating on it. Their COLD COFFEE was however a better one , but the second helping was again not that good. THE MUD SANDWICH was the only thing i felt , still ,was value for money . The FISH N CHIPS had a single fried fillet . I remebered buying the famous fish fry just on the opposite foodpath at 40 rupees during my tuitions days. The CHICKEN AND CHEESE OMLETTE was lacking in terms of the stuffing. And then CHEESE PANEER BALLS were 5 Pieces of mini popper sized at 75 bucks , tastes like plain 'chaanar bora' . we looked forward for the MUD CAKE but this was again a disappointment. The quality of chocolate was just not likeable. I know my review sounds strange and too different from others but this was definitely the worst mud cake i had.

First timer here... Very very impressed with ambience ... Since its hard to find a peaceful place nowadays...
Helps that the food was really good.. I ordered the Grilled Mud Sandwich and French fries.. However, the Cold coffee could be improved... It was a little on the room temperature side. Rather than cold.. I'm sure you guys will do better next time..
All in all, a good experience for me, definitely coming back again.. :)

After a long planning , managed to land up here with my friends with this sasti evening. I am in love with the ambiance, interior, those comfortable sitting, small mats, coasters, light in short everything. Staff was really courteous,
That  'mati' wala touch in everything.
We ordered, tea, chicken cheese omelette, grilled mud sandwich, doi chicken with rumali roti, and to end it with walnut browny with ice cream.
The tea was okish, but served well
So was the sandwich and omelette.. 
But that chicken was heavenly, best of the lot , slow cooked chicken in curd made the palce worth visiting, I strongly recommend that...
Walnut browny tasted as it should be .. Just perfect.
All together a warm, earthy place and surely deserves more visits

Visited this cafe one fine afternoon with my sister. This cafe is easy to locate as it is situated opposite to City Style on Rash Behari Avenue. The ambiance of this cafe is worth mentioning and the whole decoration is really prim and proper with cordial servers. This cafe was before legend Debabrata Biswas's house and thus the whole day only his music is played here. This place is lovely to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee. After my visit I got to know that this cafe belongs to my sister's friend and she wanted me to say her hello on her behalf but unfortunately she wasn't there. Coming to food we ordered their rumali roti with dahi chicken combo meal which is served till 3pm and we were lucky enough to grab this offer. Then we ordered their irish coffee and walnut brownie with ice cream. The food tasted really good. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience there.

Nice, little cosy place with a history (this is located in the house of late Rabindra-Sangeet maestro George Biswas)
Staff is really amicable, the decor and the soulful music makes this place ideal for dates. But I would discourage a large group of loud and hungry friends from visiting this place together. The ambience as well as the dainty portions of food served is just not enough if you are really hungry and have visited this place to only fill your stomach. I was quite disappointed by the quantity of food, frankly. But, the ambience and the taste of the food, as well as the hospitality of the staff made up for it.
Me and my friend had ordered a cappuccino-which was nice and frothy and was served with a biscuit (albeit tiny ;) , a chicken and mayo sandwich with nicely toasted bread and a creamy filling, a plate of fried paneer balls which had a burst of fresh capsicum flavour and the icing on the cake, was the Mud cake which was soft, gooey and dense and even though it was the size of a standard 5 buck tiffin cake, the dense chocolate was quite rich and heavy and even though I shared it with my friend, I was quite full.

A perfect place for conversations‚Äîsomething that is becoming a rarity these days. The decor, the quality of food, the ever smiling and helpful staff who make you feel at home, the quiet grace of the place makes you come back to this haunt so often. For those of us who know who used to live there once, I absolutely adore the way the associative memory of that space is being maintained. I've brought my friends and my teachers, who have all loved this place, and in turn brought along their friends and relatives.

If we're looking for a place to hang out with our friends for a cup of tea or coffee then we go to CCD, keeping in mind for a little high budget expense. But after you visit this place, trust me people , you will feel like all the caf√©s were way overpriced. At Mud, it's not only about the good pricing but also the impeccable quality of food they serve you, which will make you come back very soon. I've been there today, can't wait to go back again.

I visited mud today. I was warmly welcomed by the staffs. The decoration is simple yet nostalgic. We ordered "mud sandwich" n "fish n chips" along with fish chop. Later they suggested me to try their weekend special dish "palak paneer with rumali roti". The taste was damn good. They took care of every single detail while serving the food. Later I have been informed that, it was the house of GREAT DEBABRATA BISWASH. the good thing about the cafe is, they do not serve stale food. If its not fresh, they  will suggest you not to have it. They made me feel very special, something which is not seen in other cafes. Its a perfect place to hangout with friends n family. A PERFECT"ADDA" destination. A must visit one.

Believe me guys I don't have any negative intention to say this... but perhaps it will not my day at this place... deco was very pleasant.... liked there eco friendly approach ( they use paper glasses and "tal patter thala"),  music of legend Dabarata Biswas was awesome.... but what makes me to give such a review are.... 1. We ( me and my wife) were there at 6:30 p.m. and went upstairs founding all the seats are empty we chosen a four seater... but within some time another staff came asked us to shift to a two seater as they have a reservation, but we were there till 8:00 p.m. since then nobody had came... it irritates me because the two seater was very uncomfortable.... 2. Coming to the food we wants to have mango shake with vanilla ice cream but they said that it was a seasonal dish , so we settled for cold coffee with ice cream... it was good in taste but not awesome... along with that we ordered mud sandwich and chicken cheese omelette..... in sandwich the fillings are cold don't no why but it has also nothing special in taste, its just like normal sandwich... the chicken cheese omelette was good.... then we ordered rumali roti with dahi chicken, as because grilled chicken and fish and chips are not available, again disappointing.... non availability of food in a restaurant irritates me very much.... whatever dahi chicken tasted ok but again the rotis are cold....disappointing... then we gone for mud cake... good one non excellent... it a kind of choco lava cake... we will actually feel the mud filling while eating it.. But guys at the end of all I really became concerned about the guys who have reserved the seats, thinking that what they will eat, as most of the items became unavailable....

A big thanks to Zomato and the foodies I follow, or else I would never have heard of this gem of a place. It's not something you will notice at a first glance, as the entrance is small and located in a alleyway. But once you enter the place, you will be delighted. It's a very pretty place. They asked us if we would like to sit upstairs, as it's more comfortable and well decorated. We did. They had these pretty little wicker chairs and tables. Since the house belonged to Debabrata Biswas in the past, they play his songs all day long. There were artefacts and posters all around. And we also came to know that the glasses they serve beverages in are actually handmade. Since we were looking to grab a quick bite, we ordered their Grilled MUD Sandwich and Irish Coffee. The sandwich is a chicken, cheese and egg one, simply made but very healthy and delicious. The staff is very polite. One thing we forgot to ask them is the reason behind the elusive name of the place, but on the bright side, I'm looking forward to returning to this place pretty soon, their Chocolate MUD Cake and Chicken and Cheese Omelette being next on my list. :D

After reading positive reviews of this place on Zomato, we decided to give it a try yesterday. MUD is bang opposite City Stile on Rashbehari Avenue, but the alley leading to its entrance is rather easy to miss. The cafe has a calming and homely ambiance with its pretty furniture, cute rugs and showpieces. With the Debabrata Biswas songs playing softly in the background, it creates the perfect setting for an adda session with friends. Coming to the food, we ordered the grilled MUD sandwich which was a club sandwich with a filling of chicken, cheese and eggs, garnished with crisps and served with a mustard dressing. It was quite tasty. We also took Irish coffees which had an excellent flavour. Their crockery is all handmade and really pretty too. The staff were very amicable. I'm definitely returning to try out the other items on their menu.

Pros:
-Great ambiance, neatly done. Pottery items displayed for sale adds to the charm.
-Good food. Loved their Chocolate MUD cake.
-Hygienic place.
-Courteous and well-trained staff.
-Quick service.
-Easy to locate.
-Peaceful.

Cons:
Nothing.

Located adjacent to Leatherworld (Triangular park). 
The best thing about this place is the interiors (apart from good food). The ideas for the interiors are innovative, highly creative (the lamp, bamboo chairs, floor mats, pottery on display).  

Will visit again?  Yes!  A wow place!

The cafe plays Rabindra sangeet sung by Debabrata Biswas.¬†

It is actually the legendary place where the singer used to stay. The decor is amazingly tasteful. The cafe uses recycled and eco-friendly items and also sells the same.

They sell the best Darjeeling tea (golden flowery orange pekoe) in Kolkata (@85/- for two people - actually 3 can have it also). Please tell them to brew it properly - which they do not do invariably ! With it comes free cookies. The waiters do not have any idea about various types of Darjeeling tea.

They also sell Chicken Rezala for 90/- which is not very fatty (though may not be as good as say Sabir's - but it is much more healthy) and decent sandwich.¬†

But this is the only place where you can have famous Darjeeling tea with such a good romantic ambience....and sunk yourself with the feeling that the spirit of Debabata Biswas is around you with his soulful music !¬†

Tips: You can sit upstairs also....which is probably better !

This should come under hidden treasure!
## One more thing they do not shamelessly promote this place as D Biswas's house - which I find really appealing.

One of the most hospitable cafes I've seen! My friends and myself reached MUD, completely drenched by the sudden shower which struck Kolkata. The MUD staff took upon themselves to dry our wet umbrellas and shoes, and even handed us towels to dry ourselves. If this behaviour was the beginning, then the food was just the perfect combo. Try the MUD grilled sandwich. Perfect money saver and tummy filler. 2 layers of egg and chicken with cheese and mayonese! Lovely.

Such a pleasant little place,this. Made my birthday evening!
Dim lights,Rabindrasangeet in the background and tea : this place is the perfect adda hub of the thinking,music-loving,food-loving Bengali.¬†

We had the MUD sandwich which was filling and tasted very good. The chicken and cheese omlette was so tasty.¬†
The MUD cake was a disappointment,maybe because of the sticky feeling which I,personally,don't like.

During my second visit the roti and daahi chicken was *slurp* delicious.¬†
The brownie with ice-cream okayish.

Staff is very friendly and always ready to help you out with the menu.
Ambience,like I've already said,is peaceful,serene and soothing.

Very very impressed. :)

after reading some great reviews, we decided to visit this place on a cloudy afternoon.

the ambience is so pristine and homely. the homely atmosphere made me so comfortable, unlike other joints where my comfort level is lower than average due to mechanical behaviour of the staff and the crowd.

that earthy smell, mixed with a little floral essence can really soothe your nerves.

we ordered chicken cheese grilled sandwiches, peach passion iced tea and capuccino. they tasted fabulous. the sandwich was so cheesy, just the way I wanted it to be.

the staff is so very well behaved and helping. even after we finished our food and drinks, we chatted for at least 30mins more and nobody came to tell us to leave. and the the concept of not making this place a crowdy one does them good. people like me are going to go there for sure. who want a calm ambience to sit in and enjoy the company of a friend and some amazing food.

I am surely going there again. and again. :)

directions : get down near citi style. cross the road. you will see leatherworld. just beside leatherworld there is this narrow lane. there you see MUD.

This is such a nice and cute little place that mind me when i tell you you're missing out on something if you haven't yet visited this place. The joint is just opposite the City Stile store. It is a bit small but very cozy. You will get that rare homely feeling over here which is missing from most of the joints in the city. The waiters are very well behaved, helpful and friendly in their demeanour. The coffees are good and they provide a cute little biscuit with it. The sandwiches are tasty. The passion punch flavored iced tea was good to taste. They provide the food in such cute little plates. I know am using the word Cute a lot of time but you just can't help saying it over and over again if you've been here. The very first thing that would greet you when you enter is the rare earthen smell which is very mesmerising. Overall this is one of the best joints i have visited so far and would highly recommend to everybody. They deserve not one but multiple visits.

If you are looking for a peaceful ambience with economic yet delicious food then this is your destination. I was searching for a place to experience something new & MUD just rightly fits into it. Located in the Triangular Park area, we have to ask a few local persons to get the exact location. It is a two-storey building basically was the previous house of Rabindrasangeet Singer Debabrata Biswas. The ground floor has an open kitchen with well suited seating arrangement. I preferred to seat on the 1st floor.The room was well decorated with exquisite furniture & just well matched lights.Now coming to the food part, me & my friend ordered a Grilled Mud Sandwich & a Chocolate Mud Cake to start with. It was delivered with disposable pure bamboo made plates. The mud cake was filled with dark chocolate & the Sandwich was a two layer bread stuffed with egg & chicken & grilled. The taste was quite nice. Next we ordered Fish Chop & to finish with a Pina Colada. The chop was made with fresh fish & the stuffing was very good & the mocktail was just as usual.Overall it was a nice experience, the free wifi & the friendly & co-operative behavior of the waiters was an added feature. If you want an homely atmosphere then this is your place, will love to visit again.

While on a work project in Kolkata, me and my project team were searching for a place to work where we could get WiFi, AC (Kolkata is damn humid) and some peace. This was just the place we were looking for! Very good, cozy and homely ambiance. The staff were friendly and the food was good and quite reasonable. A perfect place for professionals to work (or meet) who are visiting Kolkata for a business/work trip. Will recommend the upper floor.

A barely visible narrow lane beside Leather World,Triangular Park takes you to MUD, one of the most peaceful, homely cafes of Kolkata. We went there near about 11:30 a.m and there wasn't any other customer except us. It is the house of singer Debabrata Biswas, which has now been turned to a cafe. We chose the upper floor dinning room, filled with bamboo chairs and tables, lamp shades, floor covered with mats , giving you a homely feeling. They keep on playing songs by Debabrata Biswas which adds to the soothing atmosphere. The staff are extremely amiable. Food tasted great. We opted for grilled mud sandwich, panner grilled sandwich, chocolate mud cake and blue lagoon. Choco mud cake was served hot , it was simply delicious. You can spend hours chatting with a loved one over a cup of coffee, no one nearby to disturb you or asking you to get up and leave.

Visited this awesome place a couple of hours back and just LOVED it. What better place which is well-lit, plays Rabindrasangeet in the background, serves good Tea, Coffee and Sandwiches and has extremely cordial and friendly staff? Its located next to Leather World at Triangular Park. It has two sitting areas, one on the ground floor and one on the first floor. I sat upstairs alongwith few of my friends. Ambience gets a 5 out of 5. We ordered Darjeeling Tea for 2 people first along with Chicken grilled Sandwiches, and later on ordered Flowering Green Tea for 4 people. So basically we got a large pot that serves 4 people. Sandwiches were great, so we ordered more later. Perfect place for adda with friends. They hv a bell which u can use for ordering if the waiters are downstairs. This place is truly a hidden gem. Here's to more such visits in the coming future. :)

I have been there only once with my friends and the experience I had made ne feel homely. Secondly, the blue lagoon chilled me out completely. Little tit bits are available here, tasty and very much cost effective. Responsive staff adds a flavour to the two tier cafe.

One Sunday evening , me n my friend planned to visit this place after going through the reviews in Zomato... It is just behind the Leatherland... The ambience was simple and sober... You can get a flavour of 70's Calcutta.. The music , the chair, the decoration.. The plates they served was very delightful ... The food was good.. We ordered Peach Iced Tea, Irish Coffee , Chicken and Mayo sandwich , Paneer and Cheeze Ball and French Fry.. Overall, a calm and sober place and recommended to all üòä

Visited this place after reading all the reviews. And i must say its indeed a hidden gem. The dishes are good. We ordered mud cake, cold coffee with ice cream, mud-sandwich, pina colada. I like the tangy flavour of the pina colada. The ambience was awesome. I like the whole idea of decoration.. Specially those plates and wall dacor. Its a very comfortable place for giving addas with friends over a cup of coffee. Worth paying visit again and again.

Wonderful ambience,wid a lovely background music...The food was jst awesome.
As per to the price,though it was quiet pocket friendly bt the quantity of the food was comparatively less..
The most surprising thing was the plates they serve the food.It was really nice to see the furnishings by the bamboos.It was full of typical 'bangaliyana'...

This is a hidden gem in the right sense. You wouldn't notice a caf√© right under your nose on one of the busiest streets. Right opposite to City Style beside Leather Land there is a thin lane barely visible. Walk in and you've found one of the most peaceful caf√©s in Kolkata. The first thing you would notice is the music, essentially Rabindrasangeet, most of the times in the voice of Debabrata Biswas. That is because this building was owned by him. Now a part of which has been transformed into an earthly caf√©. 
The ambience if peaceful, with earthly decor. It consists of two floors, with an open kitchen downstairs. My favourite place to hang out is the upstair area though. Very clean and tastefully decorated. 
Coming to the menu. Short and neat menu, sandwiches, coffee, tea, shakes etc. I have tried their sandwiches. Grilled Mud sandwich and the Chicken and Cheese Mayo are my favourite. I love their Pineapple Blossom and Chocolate Mud cake. Even the walnut brownie with ice cream is very nice. 
The staff are very friendly and they make you comfortable. The prices are reasonable. Worth a thousand visits. If you are looking for a peaceful place to hang out at with reasonably good food, this is the place to be. Trust me. Enjoy:)

So this is a place besides leather world in triangular park, just opposite city style. A polite guard standing shows you the way towards the cafe which is a bit inside the galli. And finally when we entered the place, it was a WOW experience, the place is decorated in a very unique way with two floors & open kitchen. The ambience is awesome, playing bengali music in the background & you enjoy your time with your loved ones. A good dating place i would prefer. Coming to food you must try their GRILLED MUD SANDWICH & MUD CAKE, but the FISH N CHIPS we ordered was not at all satisfactory. Overall experience was good, would like to visit again.

This place was never in my knowledge before a friend brought me here. And I'll forever be thankful to him for that.

Located just opposite city styles, this cafe has a small entrance that you might miss noticing at once. A polite guard waits there who takes you inside. 

The cafe has a simple ambiance with warm lights and old Bengali music doing the right magic. 

Coming to food, we ordered chicken and cheese sandwich, chicken and cheese omelette, chocolate mud cake and coffee latte. 

The coffee tasted perfect and was served with a small complementary cookie.
The chicken and cheese sandwich was absolutely awesome. It's very tasty and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the place.
The omelette was decently made.
The mud cake was again a delightful choice.

A very good experience. Good food and courteous staff in a pretty little place made me really happy.

Was meeting a Friend over coffee after 5 years, which was quite exciting, When she mentioned this place. The Cafe is way better than any other Cafe we normally visit, not only the Price is surprisingly reasonable, the ambiance which matters to me the most, is marvelous. Feels like a very peaceful place to hangout with your friend with a cup of coffee or some drinks. Very homely.. Now the food,which is very very very delicious, We ordered the Blue Lagoon which looks very fancy with the title umbrella at the top and tastes delicious too, then i ordered The Grilled Mud Sandwich for me, and my friend ordered some french Fries.. And as they were out of the Brownie that day ,they recommended the Mud cake which is a tiny bit of heaven in your mouth.
Also the Staffs are so nice and humble.Plus they don't charge any Extra VAT or Tax over the food.
Plus FREE WIFI.
So any food lovers out there looking for a cozy lovely place under a budget, please don't hesitate to try this amazing place, trust me this place wont disappoint you.

Hunting down cafes from every nook and corner of South Kolkata has become quite a delightful task for me and discovering this place off Triangular Park, right next to Leather World was quite an accomplishment! A tiny alley leads into this warm and inviting cafe which has two floors with an open kitchen! A neutral set up completed with cosy sitting works. The hot n sinful Mud cake off their menu is a must! Also the Mud Sanwich is amazing to say the least! The house belonged to renowned Rabindrasangeet stalwart Debabrata George Biswas and his songs are mostly played softly behind. The feeling of sipping on coffee and gorging on cakes while listening to his songs, I tell you, felt great! Courteous folks there! Great place!

A sudden plan while returning from college, and 4 of us friends landed in MUD. And MUD did impress us to a great degree.

LOCATION: It's located in Rash Behari Avenue, at a narrow lane that runs beside Leather World, opposite to Citi Syte Mall.

AMBIENCE: This cafe is built in the house which happened to belong to the late Bengali singer Debabrata Biswas. On entering we were greeted with a pleasant aroma of coffee. A waiter escorted us upstairs, and opened a room which was so well decorated in a simplistic and minimalist way! Everything was done in a Bengali style, from straw mats to wooden tables, chairs made from cane, and even the lamp shade. We were really awed by the decor. Moreover there was a radio that played Rabindra Sangeet at a very low, yet audible volume. With dim lights, Rabindra Sangeet, and such a quaint decor, the ambience was fantastic.

FOOD & SERVICE: The menu isn't huge, doesn't boast of fancy items, but has all those which we generally need. We weren't particularly hungry, so we ordered just a few items. Cold Coffee, Grilled Mud Sandwich,  Omelette with Cheese and Chicken, Walnut Brownie with Ice Cream, and Chocolate Mud Cake.

It took them quite some time to serve us. But the foods were good, homely, and pleasing. The cold coffee was a bit strong on coffee, unlike what I've had elsewhere, but I liked it. The Grilled Mud Sandwich was tasty. It had two layers: one had salami and cheese, the other had boiled egg and mayo. The only con was that the the bread was too grilled and it tasted bitter. The my two friends who took the omelette liked it. The Chocolate Mud Cake and the Brownie with ice cream were good too.

PRICING: Another thing which is delightful about this cafe is it's pricing. All items are decently priced, and you can have food without having to worry about the bill amount. The bill amounted to around 550 for the 4 of us.

I'm coming back to this lovely cafe again, very soon, with my mom, with friends.

I came to know about this cute little cafe located inside a tiny alley beside leatherworld,triangular park after a friend highly recommended this place. The place is clean and smells great even the washroom, ambience is nice,service was great.
Now for the food,the attraction chocolate mud pie shall be a trifle small for your liking but it is DELICIOUS. So is the vanilla ice cream with brownie. The mocktails were all reasonably priced. I enjoyed my visit thoroughly and looking forward to getting back again.

Went to this place after checking out the reviews on zomato. Once u enter u get a calm serene feeling you feel like a Bengali proud to be amidst its culture. The place may be small but makes up in other ways. The food is delicious and all homemade. Especially loved the chocolate MUD pie it was to die for! The place doesn't charge tax so its cheap as well. The coffee is so frothy and smooth you will love it! Also enjoyed the walnut brownie with ice cream which was homemade you get the rustic feeling with the use of wooden plates. The environment is further created by playing rabindra sangeet by the man himself. DEFINITELY a place to check out!

Walking down the road from Triangular Park, the little board of MUD suddenly caught my eye. This place was already on my wishlist! The two of us raced into little alley that led us to the place. The surprise date with MUD was "amazingly amazing"!

‚òÖ LOCATION & AMBIANCE : Right opposite the Triangular Park Citi Style, this little cafe is tucked at the end of a quaint, narrow alley.
This very place used to be the home of the legendary Bengali singer , Debabrata Biswas.

A simple ambiance coupled with dim lights, beautiful cutlery and a huge playlist of Rabindra Sangeet humming throughout the two floors of the place have successfully blossomed in itself a unique charm. There is a pottery workshop upstairs as well.

‚òÖ FOOD : The food was really, really good - my mouth waters as I type! We started with LATTE, served in cute cups. Loved it.

Next came the CHICKEN & CHEESE GRILLED SANDWICH. The luscious layers of chicken and cheese riveted between the two slices of bread was a delight. At this price, this is possibly the best sandwich I've ever had.

UPDATE : We have tried the SPECIAL MUD SANDWICH too. It is a club sandwich with a layer of egg in it. It was good but not as magnificent as the previous one. OREO SHAKE was also taken, which was mediocre.

With some hunger still lingering on, the day's special CHICKEN & CHEESE OMELETTE was called for. The first slice of the knife on this square omelette opened up to the small dice of chicken on their bed of cheese. Heavy and mouthwatering. I'll be gorging on this again very soon!

The meal concluded with CHOCOLATE MUD CAKE. Served in a heart-shaped tray, it felt like a form of choco lava cake. But then, can anyone resist a tantalizing dark chocolate cake with liquid chocolate oozing out?

‚òÖ PRICING : It was total value for money. The total bill for the two of us was less than ‚Çπ400.

‚òÖ SERVICE : The service here is worth appreciating. The menu is a bit limited however. The food was served more or less in time. The staff was courteous and informative of everything related to the cafe. Free WiFi is available, and some cool combo offers run from noon till 3pm. They take bookings too, at very reasonable rates.

Strongly recommended! :)

Located beside Triangular Park and adjacent to Hindusthan Park Leather World shop , MUD is an extremely homely cafe which was surprisingly the residence of the famous singer Debabrata Biswas :) The crowd is thin and so we had a comfortable arrangement :P Ordered their Lunch combo offer (rumali roti, dahi chicken and coffee) and Choco brownie with ice cream and we are pleased with their quality. Can be better though! But if you leave aside the food and search a place for endless chatting and some quality time spending then it's the place you can look for :) The decor is all Bong oriented ethnic style, and the player plays Debabrata Biswas's songs which are bound to soothe you once you get in :)

If you're looking for a cafe with an ambience like no other, MUD is the place for you. When you slide the door open and step into MUD, you get the feeling you've walked into someone's home. This is especially true of the first floor. You can read a book while drinking cup after cup of coffee, or doodle on a blank canvas, or work on your novel here. There are plenty of pocket-friendly hot and cold beverages, and snacks to choose from. The cappuccino and the house special sandwich are must-haves.

I am in total love with this place. 1st things first - this cafe is in the house that the great singer Debabrata Biswas resided in previously. I mean how many times do you get to know that the exact same place that you are eating in has been traversed by a legend only half a century ago. Not often i believe. If that is not all that blows your mind - the decor and the ambience sure will. This cute little cafe is located in a lane just beside leatherworld in triangular park and is all but overshadowed by it. When you enter the place you are transported into your happy zone. There is rabindrasangeet playing in the background (of course in the voice of Debabrata Biswas) and there are 'madurs' spread all over the floor. There is also a 1st floor area and we opted for that. The 1st floor is also similar but more calmer. We sat down and ordered for cold coffee with ice cream, mango shake with ice cream, french fries and the MUD special chocolate mudcake. The order arrived in due time and the spread was delectable. Special mentions for the cold coffee and mango shake both of which just lilted our mood they were so good. The mudcake is the runner up here and it is pure bliss. A mention about the staff here. They were very helpful and ever smiling. They even told us the story of the place. They also have a small gift shop on the 1st floor. Its a perfect place to take your loved one on a date. And the price for all this happiness not at all much. Definitely going back there. Bon apetit!

This pocket-friendly place happens to be located in triangular park beside "leather world" and a recent find of mine thanks to zomato. The place is good for an evening tea and lite eats. Had their signature grilled sandwich which has two layers (one of chicken salami and mayo and the other of boiled egg and cheese )
lemon tea and mud cake ( loaded with chocolate ) . The place is small but the decorations takes away the prize. The floor is covered in madur , there's a lamp shed at a corner and the background music of Rabindra sangeet is a winner. The food is yummy, ambience is nice , wifi is available and the service is good. On my next visit i am planning to have their fish n chips as it was quite reasonable here.

Located opposite to City Style, I found the ambiance very nice. Their theme was like Old school Bengali Cafe. I went there with my friend for a quick bite and hence ordered a Lemonade and Chocolate Mud cake.
It came soon and bot the items were top quality product. The Mud Cake is actually Choco Lava cake but tasted great.
Will come back gain to tryout something else (along with the Mud cake again).
The price may look high but so is the quality.

Located just beside leather world, this is a small cafe. The waiters insisted we go up to the second floor..we were the only customers at that time! They do sell some of the items which are put upon display. We ordered a sandwich, french fries and chocolate mud cake.. I had a feeling that the range of the items included in the menu is very limited bt otherwise for a quick bite this is a nice option..sandwich and french fries were ordinarily good but the chocolate mud cake though very small was the showstopper! It was perfectly warm..nice, courteous behaviour of the stuffs present.

First of all I have marked 4 only becoz of the price to quality ratio...
Very nice place...
About its affordability it's very very cheap plus the waiters their are very much friendly...
The negative things about the place is mainly the lead time i.e. they take a lot of time to serve the ordered food and 2nly is the seating arrangements like the space is very less...
Coming to the food we ordered for a mango shake then a mud special sandwich and an ice tea...
All very up to the mark when compared with the prices of the items...
In short a 'thik-thak' place to hang around with friends on days when the pocket is out of cash and yes there are lots and lots of room for improvement...
The foremost thing to be improved is the kitchen I have attached the pic so you will be able see that the kitchen is directly connected with the place where the food is served but yeah the seating in the 1st floor is very good then again the space is low...

A quaint quiet coffee shop tucked away behind the Leather World showroom opposite Citystyle in Rashbehari... there couldn't be a better place near Gariahat for a long chit chat with a friend! Just loved their cold coffee and Mud sandwich! And if you are a tea enthusiast, don't forget to try their Darjeeling tea! Served on eco-friendly trays and ethnic pottery, the service is as nice as the food!¬†

This used to be the residence of Debabrata Biswas, and the decor and the music bear the mark of class. Unobtrusive yet tasteful... a perfect setting for an unhurried evening... And if you fall in love with one of the wonderful mugs, trays or other pottery items on display, you can buy them right off the shelf for yourself or for your loved ones...

MUD was the cherry on the cake for a day like today... heavily pouring down. So, one of my friends and I was there today at around 6:30 p.m. The interior was very classy, posh and eye-catching... something that you definitely won't get to see in the recently opened cafes. And what more can impress you apart from the ecstatic food that it offers. Just don't miss out on the Grilled MUD Sandwich...one of the best I had till date. Absolutely a stunner. We were so much engrossed in eating we actually forgot to clock snaps because I had in my mind to write about it in Zomato since its a newbie. A big thumps up for MUD. Loved it.

Today me and my friend went to this place for the first time after reading some good reviews. Being saturday evening we were a bit unsure whether we'll get place or not but to our surprise we found that there were few empty seats. So we were seated upstairs on the 1st floor of the cafe. Nice homely atmosphere. I basically went there to try their fish n chips (after reading such good stuffs about it). Unfortunately they could not serve it as they had already finished their stock. Quiet disappointing to see that on a weekend that to at such prime evening hours they were unable to serve their one of the most popular dishes. We thus ordered iced tea (they only had peach flavour which was another set back) , one chicken n cheese sandwich and a chicken n mayo sandwich both grilled. The chicken n cheese sandwich was okay as we could at least see some amount of cheese inside the sandwich but the chicken n mayo was another let down. I could hardly find any mayo in the sandwich and they served only chicken salami and not chicken pieces for the sandwiches. Nevertheless it was probably not our day as none of the dishes quiet stood up or could pull us again to visit this place but we'll definitely visit one more time just to try out their fish n chips and then only will make the final verdict.

I had been planning to visit mud since a while and finally made it to this place monday aftrnoon. It is located just behind leather world, triangular park. The place is quite small but the ambience is very pleasing. We were seated in the ground floor. There were four tables laid. We took our seat and made the order:

1. Cold coffee with ice cream- This was just fav. This drink made my day.

2. Mango shake- It was wonderfully presented. There were two chunks of mango and one scoop of vanilla ice cream and was very refreshing.

3. Fried fish with chips- This was the hero of the meal. The piece of fish fry was quite big and had a thick layer of fish. Each bite was fishy and with mustard sauce it tasted heavenly. It tasted even better than the fried fish with chips i had at codfather. I wished the fish never ended.

4. Grilled mud sandwich- I'm not a big fan of sandwiches. But since there were limited options we opted for this and i was very delighted. It was one of the best sandwiches i ever had. It was double layered. One was of ham and cheese and the other was of egg and mayo. It was very filling and tasty !

It was a wonderful experience at mud. Our bill came to INR 515 and they dont charge any tax ! The man who served us was very friendly and well behaved. He suggested us to visit their pottery collection at the first floor. The collection was appealing. Surely mud will turn out to be one of the best cafes in the city in a few days.

Such a beautiful homely ambience. The brownie walnut with ice cream was to die for. I ordered mango shake and sandwich. Prices are okayish and the swad is absolutely perfect. They play old Debabrata biswas songs in the background.. The mood they create is beautiful. The food is good as well. I am gonna take my mother here... Hope mud stays like ds and doesnot change drastically.

The decoration is simple yet very nostalgic. when u enter u will get a homely feeling, very much like ANEKDIN POR BARI ASLAM, for those who misses their home. And the quality of food is quite good. But, the ambience is very beautiful. U will not believe, unless you come and have a cup of coffee with fish n chips.
FOOD- 4/5
AMBIENCE- 5/5

This place in my wishlist when one of my foodie friend told me about this place.very small joint yet serves very good caf√© n snacks.easy to locate n it's a new place.
========================================
Went there last Wednesday very humid n hot weather can't able to feel good.wenr there around 3.30 p.m.nice place stuffs are very polite and well behaved.i was only person that time...it was totally empty.
========================================
On the background Rabindra Sangeet n yes if you don't have enough usage on your mobile you can use their free wi-fi now a days it's a very important part of our life.apart from that interior quite normal n ambience good.last night before I went there I discover there is a another food "fish fry" they started serving.without any hesitation i orderd it with iced tea later I had chicken sandwich with capuchino..
1.fish fry super amazing made by Vetki Mach taste really good m big in size served with french fries n tomato with mayone sauce.
2.it's good to have iced tea in this weather refresh your body n mind.normal in taste served in a large glass
3.chicken sandwich well grilled n inside chicken it's fresh n good.
4.capuchino is normal served with a choco chip.
========================================service-4/5
Food-5/5
Ambience-5/5
Quality n quantity-4/5
Interior-4/5
My experience was good.everyone should visit this place n pocket friendly place.
Simply I love this place "Fish Fry with Rabindra Sangeet" just brilliant combination.

Newly opened coffee shop, just opposite to my house (actually its so close that I can see the entrance from the window of my bedroom) :D still I payed a late visit to this place! I loved the decor.. Its cozy and earthly with fresh trees, clay pots and much more.. It is the same place where legendary Debabrata Sen used to stay! And thanks to them for keeping him in memory! (They played his songs) they also own a pottery shop upstair, which is quite interesting with lots of interesting stuffs.. As far as menu, we ordered mango shake with ice cream, fish and chips, chicken and cheese sandwich, expresso, paneer cheese ball and mud cake..
Mango shake was fabulous, made with freshly chopped mango slices, with dollops of ice cream and fresh cream.. And the open kitchen gave me an opportunity to see how they were making it.. Fish and chips was out of the world, its soft, fresh and tender.. Sandwich and paneer cheese ball was decent.. Mud cake was delicious with chocolate coming out from inside, warm to the right proportion.. The waiters were very cooperative and helpful.. They are the ones who made this place more comfortable for everyone..
Keep it up!!

Visited MUD, probably amongst one of the first ones to visit this unique hangout.. The owner is my father's colleague and she was kind enough to invite us for the opening.. The location is very easy to find, just below and behind leatherworld at triangular park..
The decor is extremely nice and reflects the name itself, clay pots and an earthly feel.. The seating arrangements are cozy and it is not big, around 12 people can be seated..
Coming to the main part, the food. We had Chicken and cheese sandwich, chocolate mud cake, Cappuccino and Latte.. The thing which I liked most was they served little choco cookies along with the coffees which was awesome.. The coffees were perfect and we had no complaints..
The sandwich could have been better, still was one of the better ones I had, felt it was a little dry, would try the mayo sandwich next time.. The chocolate mud cake was heavenly.. Chocolate oozing out of the cake, it was absolutely sumptuous.. Would love to go back for more.. Recommended for anyone who is looking for a calm and unique spot to hangout and relax..

For a cool hangout and a cosy outing MUD is worth it! 
The caf√© has added another floor to it so as to accommodate as many as the craving customers! üç¥
The menu has been made more delightful by introducing the new Paratha and Dahi Chicken! It's simply mouth watering and immensely delicious! One must not miss trying it! :) 
Another thanks to MUD for the keeping such lovely pottery, jewelry and other creative accessories!‚ù§
The bags are so fanciful! I feel like taking them everywhere!
The earings and necklaces are of ceramic art and indeed very beautiful! Every girl will love wearing them since they match so well with any sort of outfits! Customers should definitely give them a try. :)
MUD has been and will always remain my favorite place for hanging out :)
Truly speaking, it's an amazing place!‚úå

after a long time visited MUD to taste the newly added item fish fry and mango shake with vanilla ....friends I dont have the correct adjective to describe the taste of the fish fry served there. I had tasted fish fry from star hotels,clubs or road side stalls,but MUD has some extraordinary preparation and I can challenge you all you can't get the taste elsewhere.come and taste the fish fry and mango shake and I bet every evening you will be dragged to MUD........Another reason why you will visit MUD, is the wide range of hand made potteries, each one is different from other and has a rich cultural touch of different states and countries. One must visit once to taste the authentic foods and rare collection of pottery.

The first question that comes to your mind when you enter MUD is why is it called MUD . Well that mystery got solved later. First things first.  In the stretch (rash behari avenue) which is the lifeline of South Kolkata, I always missed a cool coffee joint when my tired feet gave away from all those Gariahat street shopping, my throat gave away from all those loud haggling, and my overloaded hands gave up after carrying all those packets. MUD is just an answer to that. Not to mention it‚Äôs a cool place to meet up with friends too ; shopping or no shopping. They have a cosy d√©cor, some awesome food and few out of the world beverages. 9 of us went; ours were more of meeting up a friend who came down from Bangalore. There were few of us who met after 28 years, so MUD was indeed special to us. We tried Cheese Sandwiches, French fries , Grilled MUD sandwiches , Cold coffee with ice cream , Darjeeling tea to name a few. All of them were very good in taste. Food, friends and fun was the theme and MUD perfectly complemented that. Now coming back to the first question, the first floor of this caf√© has some awesome collection of pottery. Black, blue, not-so-black, not-so-blue ‚Äì in all forms and shapes. Plus some interesting table wares too.  Some of us splurged into those gorgeous MUD items ‚Äì they were worth completely.  

MUD is highly recommended for all tired shoppers, over stressed office returning executives, unruly group meets ‚Äì it will surely meet up to all your expectations.

A top notch cafe at the heart of Rashbehari Avenue ,near Triangular park.You will like its Cold Coffee with Ice cream,sandwiches, and other snacks and above all the ambiance- a mixture of Nostalgia(legendary singer Debobroto Biswas used to live here) and ethnicity where you can hang around liking and buying Pottery,at a shop situated upstairs.The ambiance with its blend of past and present is unique.A place you must visit and write up your comments.....

Such a cozy cafe in an ambience full of warmth.... a place which is ideal to spend some lazy moments with friends or family. Loved their sandwiches, they were simply awesome but the best was their cold coffee with ice cream - its a must have... anyone who visits should try it. They also have a pottery studio... excellent and unique items yet very reasonably priced. Have bought a few gift items for family & friends which have been well appreciated by all. To sum it up, i loved MUD coz it caters to two of my greatest weaknesses.... good¬†food & good shopping....

Mud is possibly d only joint in Kolkata who boast of associating nostalgia with modern coffee bars. Legendary Rabindrasangeet singer Debobrata        (George) Biswas used to reside on d very floor of d coffee joint. The setting is Intimate n cozy. The menu is concise n every ltem is well prepared especially chicken club sandwich. They have an array of tea flavours to choose from. But d litmus test of a coffee joint is of it's coffee  n here Mud passes with flying colours! It has one of d best cold coffee with ice cream in whole of Kolkata. Taking its cultural connect forward is it's interconnected pottery studio on d 1st floor where beautifully crafted potteries are on display for sale. One will not only enjoy d tea,coffee n other goodies but also d culturally rich ambience!!

Happiness has a new destination! The first ever coffee shop on Rash Behari Avenue.......Mud!! The amazing concept and decor makes it all the more appealing! The cold coffee with ice cream and the "Mud special" club sandwiches are a must have!!!! 
When we had filled our stomachs we ventured to the first floor to take a pick from the array of amazing pottery items on display....
Mud... As their tagline defines them- coffee, clay and more..... truly is a place where one visit is simply not enough!!!

A friend had suggested that I check out this place, so I did. And I liked it very much because it has a reasonably priced, no-fuss menu, and what little it has is prepared very well. My meal companion said that the MUD cold coffee with ice cream was perhaps the best she has ever had in Kolkata. We tried a few sandwiches, which were all fresh and delicious. The MUD cake was very nice, too. Some good packaged teas are also sold here.  While the sitting space is tiny, it is tastefully done up - I think each table will have enough privacy even when the cafe is full. The best part is the location. This cafe is near Triangular Park, right on the main road, just five minutes' walk from Gariahat crossing and less than ten minutes' walk from Deshpriya Park. That whole stretch does not have anything so good as MUD - by that, I mean good value. The floor above the cafe has a pottery store, with beautiful modern designs on sale, so this is a nice place to have a snack and also pick up a gift. BTW, if you are interested in history, MUD is located in the building where singer Debabrata Biswas used to live, and the cafe is in the space that used to be his bedroom-cum-music room.
