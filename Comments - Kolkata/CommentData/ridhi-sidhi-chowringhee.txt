Located at the ground floor of emami market which is opposite to Shri shikshayatan. Firstly, it's a pure VEG restaurant.
I had been to this place atleast some 20-30 times and this is the only veg restaurant I love.
Had many things from here before but yesterday ordered veg pizza ( they doesn't use mozarella cheese neither the grated cheese is soft but yet tasty), chowmein with gravy, papri chat and watermelon juice. I loved the unique way of serving pizza..
The waiters are also very friendly here and the service is quick if you visit before 2pm or after 5pm. That's my personal experience.
Recommended !!

Food quality is good,but staff service isn't fast,and I observed a disrespectful attitude of a particular staff towards irregular customers or who has visited for first time for buying small amount,like come on if You profit by selling huge amount why are You adding small priced goods?
Taste and decor is okay good
But change in staff behaviour is required otherwise I doubt their existence in business world because food is good but behaviour needs to be improved

To find varieties of vegetarian food at a pricey range, Lord Sinha Road is the place to be. Ridhi Sidhi is a popular food joint here, pretty crowded often due to its strategic location between two schools, office buildings and a shopping arcade(Emami) They serve good quality vegetarian dishes, quantity wise which are wholesome but taste wise average. The menu card at Zomato needs to be updated because the prices for all the items have gone up by 10-20Rs in their new menu. The resturant has decent AC decors and the service is fairly good. Overall a convinient place for a quick veggie bite though price is on the higher side.
Ups- steamed momo, alu paratha, phoochka.
Chinese dishes are just okay in terms of taste. Paw bhaji and chola baturas are too spicy and oily.

Located just beside emami market on lord sinha road.Menu is comprehensive with lots of options to choose from.

The MOST popular dish of this place is veg steamed momo....no doubt it is just yummmm.I also had pav bhaji which was nice.The hakka noodles were tasty and crispy chili baby corn could be better.I ordered a soda shikanji afterwards and topped it with kala khatta gola.

So its a delicious, comfortable and pocket friendly place

I went to Ridhi Sidhi on a weekday afternoon along with one my friend. We ordered one cheese grilled sandwich (not veg cheese grilled sandwich) - with just layers of cheese between bread - an easy 4/5.
The Puchkas weren't really the best specially given its price.
We also ordered Chickoo Kulfi - because it was both of our favourite natural ice cream flavour and you know, it's always amazing to have ice creams on a rainy day - 5/5.
Ridhi Sidhi is the little nice restaurant where you visit once in a while. The only annulling thing about Ridhi Sidhi was the price of the food!

Vegetarian fast food restaurant with quite a few options in the menu. Quality of food and Ambience is kind of what you expect in a fast food joint - nothing exceptional but not bad either. But please be cautious on the prices displayed in the menu and what you get charged for (and I am excluding the taxes which are standard additions). I got charged extra and when I pointed this out, noticed strong reluctance to understand the issue and accept mistakes.

Ridhi sidhi has been ever famous with school and college goers in that area. The service and quality has  become better after renovation (assuming, because I am coming here after a year). We tried pav bhaji, momos, alu tikki chat, papdi chat, masala dosa, fresh lime soda and masala thumsup. Everything was neat, at least, and taste was decent.

Being a vegie i loved their food and masala thanda. The north indian dishes are good and also the momos and rolls. The place has got nothing in the name of ambience and the service is slow but the food they serve covers for all these drawbacks.

I love this place despite of it being overpriced and not so posh and not so furnish. You can take your family and friends or alone.

Do's- do try thier 'paw bhaji' , yes they have better 'paw bhaji' than any stall I have ever eaten.
2nd option is to try thier 'chole bature' its not the best but according to the price this one is upto the mark.
3rd option is to try the 'kulfi' and 'gola' outside .

Dont's- dont expect a fine dining here , they just have snacks, simple furnitures and simple plastic and paper plates .
2ndly dont try to have anything else other than the above mentioned , you may feel its overpriced.

As soon as you open the package, the view would kill all your hunger. Not my choice of Panner.  This is almost-forcefully finished dish.. because I cant waste my money more. However noodles was really good.

It large enough and is decent looking.
They serve pure veg food. Service is fast and systematic. They have the token system for collecting orders. 
Is pocket friendly. The entire college crowd goes there.

Location-Lord sinha road,beside emami market.

This place has lost its charm and is no more same in aspect of food and service.Its a small air conditioned restaurant which serves you variety of cuisines but is mainly known for its ice gola and sandwhiches.

Service-The service at this place is quite slow and most of the time you have to  request them to get your food ready.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is good.Few years back it used to remain fully occupied even on weekdays but now you will rarely find it full.The interiors are also simple.

Food-The food at this place has lost its quality and taste.We have tried all their dishes and some which we still like are-
1:Ice gola
2:paw bhaji

Service-2.5/5
Food-3/5
Ambiance-3.5/5

We hope to see an improvement in food and service at this place.üòÑüòÑ

This place is just next to Emami Market. I have just been there once a few days back and I know that I will never go there again. Basically, there is nothing good here. The ambience is still better than the other things. And this place has disappointed me more than any other. We had ordered baby corn, noodles, puchka and pav bhaji. The baby corn was uncooked and when we complained they responded saying it was supposed to be like that but then we got it changed again. Other items were not fabulous but still acceptable. In spite of being a furnished restaurant, they food quality is no better than any other roadside stall. The service was definitely poor. Also, they provide food in paper plates and there is absolutely no presentation. My overall experience here was seriously very bad.

A very popular joint among vegetarians, I love their Singapuri Noodles. they have a huge variety of north indian, south indian, chinese and street food and serve everything in thermocol plates. I am not fond of their Chhole bhature though because they cane be easily made with much less oil. If you are a vegetarian, you will love the steamed momos here. I would also like to recommend a few other items on their menu such as the vegetable grilled sandwich, masala dosa, soda shikanji and puchka. The juices however are a tad bit highly priced. INR 60 or 70 I think is quite high for juice. Service can also be improved a lot.

Location: Theater Road. It's a small, looking place located right opposite to Shri Shikshayatan College.

Food: Vegetarian place with average to low quality food. Quantity-wise okay given their stipulated price. 

Alu Roll: tough, chewy dough casing filled with aloo stuffing which is really not that impressive. (1/5)

Idli: comes with two pieces. Fluffy and light, complemented with sambar and chutney. Tastes decent. However takes more than your usual time for them to serve. (2.5/5)

Masala Dosa: not so chrispy dosa with aloo stuffing inside complemented with your usual sambar and chutney. Tastes decent. However the mentioned price gets you way better quality dosa than this. (2/5)

Management: Poor. Poor service. Poor staff. Badly maintained place. Ridhi Sidhi does not excel in cleanliness either. Pocket pinch is pretty low.

Not sure where to begin from. I've been to Ridhi Sidhi thrice or maybe more in my college life and every time I've been to this place, it has disappointed me. Firstly the staff won't even notice that you are seated there for around 15 mins. You literally have to get up on your own and get the menu card from some other table. 
Secondly, the food. Not sure if it is only me but every time I've tried their Chinese, the food has turned out to be completely burnt. South Indian is pretty decent though. Noodles and babycorn are terrible. The coffee which they serve is mostly cold. 
Would have given this place a more decent rating had the staff been cordial to us. Needs improvement.

Ridhi Sidhi is located exactly opposite to my college and even though,I never had the excitement to go there. I have been there just twice. Once,to meet a friend and had masala dosa which was okayish and the second time to have puchkas which were really nice. The eatery is pretty huge with a dine-in inside and pav bhaji and chat stalls outside. Pricing is moderate and kept in mind according to the college students. Looking forward to check out some more stuff to add to my review!

I was thinking whether I should review this place coz whenever I see this place it's like they have just opened it for the sake of opening. What all can be done with this location that these guys have. The food I won't say is bad it's jus ordinary and rates are really reasonable for the food they are providing.

It is located on the ground floor of emami market.The food is good . Whenever I shop at emami I prefer to go their to calm my hunger. But one thing is that I love their raj kachori and now they stopped making it eventhough it is very famous.

This plc has many of my college memories attached.. Had tried thr franky roll and veg momos along wid the puchkas.. I lyk thr franky roll but the stufdings of the momos are not tht great.. Cleanliness and hygiene needs to be taken care though.. The plc is too noisy but the service is quick!

Ridhi Sidhi is located exactly opposite to my college and even though,I never had the excitement to go there. I have been there just twice. Once,to meet a friend and had masala dosa which was okayish and the second time to have puchkas which were really nice. The eatery is pretty huge with a dine-in inside and pav bhaji and chat stalls outside. Pricing is moderate and kept in mind according to the college students. Looking forward to check out some more stuff to add to my review!

Located beside Emami market, diagonally opposite to Shri Sikshayatan.

The ambience is neither great not bad. Prompt service. Unfriendly and untrained staffs.

Number of items on offer from north indian to south indian, chats to Chinese.

Of all, I would recommend momos because of the yummy sauce. The chaats are okay not great and a lot of improvisation is required with use of condiments and spices.

Overall an average experience.

Visited here today and ordered a Veg- Grill Cheese Sandwich Jain. The cucumber used was completely bitter. When complained to the person making he said "kaha se hoga. Sab le jarahe hai Sandwich aur koi nai bola( how is it possible. Everyone is taking and having the Sandwich but no one has complained.) "
When complained at the counter the person rudely and arrogantly replied " thoda toh adjust karna padta hai (you need to adjust a little). So a warning and caution to all - however food you are served in case bad you will still have to eat it or leave it. Since money is paid first they really don't care about it. Eat at your own risk.

It is located near emami market . The taste and quality of food has deteriorated very much. During childhood days when I used to visit would really cherish the food. Had visited after many years with a couple of friends. V had ordered a Hakka chow which was good, chola bhatura and white sauce pasta ordered were terrible and not up to the mark. It really needs improvement.

The ambience is very old fashion. And the food is not up to the mark. The Dosa could be better. The sambar and cutney was tasteless. 
The paw bhaja is pretty okay, as it is nice and Spicy.

Following mom's finicky needs of eating only vegetarian and fish outside, and also being in a place where I do a lot of shopping, I've eating in this place forever.
It is sparsely but well lit and clean, though the chairs are puny and a large person might feel pretty uncomfortable.
The servers are mild mannered people, but laidback, a bit too much maybe. Service does take time, but is understandable since they cook the food fresh and to order.
In my last 15 years of coming here I've tried most of the menu. The number of dishes have decreased (I miss their fried rice and manchurian a lot) but the dosa, sandwich and chowmein are simple, tasty stuff. I especially love the good, smoky fry job on their noodles and rice. Chilli Paneer is a bit different from the run of the mill, but tasty nonetheless.
Their franky rolls have more aloo these days, which is a sadness.
Their chole bhature I absolutely love and find it better than haldirams.
Their paw bhaji is really mediocre and I find neighbouring Mayaram's to be way better.
As of portion sizes, noodles are served really small. One full plate satisfies a hungry me, but then I am a light eater. Heavy eaters should better stick to sandwich or dosa or bhature which have larger portion sizes. 
They make good pulpy juices and you can ask them to make it without sugar. Their rose lassi is wonderful, with a hit of not just roohafza but also rosewater. Rose lovers will love this. The kesariya lassi falls short on taste though.
My hygiene stingy mom loves that they provide disposable plates and glasses too.
Prices are moderate and even eating a lot doesn't hurt the pockets.
On the whole, a satisfying joint. And not to say a memory trip every time I go üòä

Its located just beside the Emami market and opppsite to the Shri Shikshayatan(School/College)
All it has are its cons-
1) sky high prices.
2) a small fist full of amount of food they serve you after charging so much.
3) staves too are not well trained.

It's more of a sophisticated road side food in a conditioned setting. The only favourites here are the Grilled Sandwiches and the Momos. 

But if you walk down a little towards the end of the road touching AC market, the chaat patty on the left serves way better Momos, noodles, puchkas, kachori chaat, chillas, Victoria bada etc.

Ridhi sidhi is located just beside Emami market. They serves quality chaats and snacks, from north indian to south indian. Dahi puchka is mouthwatering. Papdi chat and dhosa is average in taste.I like their Anar juice.Prices are little high and not pocket friendly. ambience is good.If you are a dahi puchka lover then try it.

This place is right opposite to shri shikshayatan. Its a rather moderate veg joint. Its pocket friendly for students. Not great in terms of decor or ambiance. Service is fast  and fine.
They have a variety of things available (all veg) but i have only really liked their dosa's and sandwiches.

Ridhi Siddhi is one of the few vegetarian restaurants which you can easily spot on Lord Sinha Road, as it has a long yellow facade, with the names of its most famous preparations written clumsily in red against the yellow wall. However, the interiors are pretty enough for a cheap restaurant like this, and it is packed with families and groups of friends most of the time. Seeing many people with plates of noodles in front of them, we decided to order Veg Mixed Noodles with Veg Manchurian. Both of these tasted very good, though they could have cut down on the amount of vegetables served with the noodles, as they were overpowering both in sight and taste. This is definitely a place one could go back to, especially vegetarians, because of the sheer variety of vegetarian dishes on offer, and the taste which is definitely satisfying.

The location of the of the place is awesome, just opposite the Shri Shikshayatan School adjacent to the emami market in the posh and not so crowded alley of the city thrived by pretty young women(like me ;-) ). The food is vegetarian. My order included churmur chaat and dahi phuchka. Well I did not like the taste. The churmur chaat was very plain with an overdose of salt. The dahi phuchka was nothing special. Small phuchkas filled with little bit of yogurt with very feeble trace of condiments and spices. It tasted sour(only because of the yogurt and hardly any condiment) ¬†then sweet. Somehow I did not like the sweet part. The problem with the food is that they do not try to play with spices and condiments and refuse to put in more ingredients in the dish. Well as haldirams is not far away and the prices are the same, I will prefer Haldirams as it provides more quantity and better taste. The ambiance is neither good nor bad, its a place you should go when you are in the area and too tired to move anywhere else!

Dahi Aloo Chaat¬†
Veg Chow( Though bit on oily side)

I've been going to Riddhi Siddhi since I was in class 4.
It was right opposite my school.
Its the place you go not out of choice, but when you don't have much choice. :P
If you have a light pocket day, or if you feel like going veggie for a day, this place isn't a bad option!
I like the chola bhatora platter there. Pretty tasty.
The chili corn is quite good too. Though I am not at all a chaat person, by gauging the reaction of my mom, I can safely say the chaats are delicious.
However, my favourites at this place are: the absolutely amazing Pav Bhaaji (which reminds me of having pav bhaaji from a thela in Juhu.... really, its THAT good), the kulfi and of course, the amazing Ice Golas.

Reached Starmark and wanted to put something substantial in our bellies before we hit the joint. Since it was a Monday, this place was deserted mostly, and we entered and ordered Special Pao Bhaji with 2 pieces of pao,  Banarasi Chholey Chat, Coffee, Thums up and a Rose Milk Shake as an afterthought. 

The guy came back after 6-7 minutes and said they did not have any chaat items, so we decided to order Chholey Baturey. My Pao Bhaji came with a thin layer of grated cheese on the Bhaji, and it smelled heavily of butter (YAY!). The bhaji was very well-prepared, and the pao were soft and buttered well. The Rose Milk Shake with Ice Cream was everything I dreamed of - sweet, heavily tasting and smelling of rose syrup, with a large dollop of vanilla ice cream on top and a bit of ice. WONDERFUL in one word. The Chholey Baturey was also quite good, with two large size baturey with a small bowl of chholey. I found the chholey to be low in quantity in compariso to the large, fluffy batura, but it tasted pretty good. It was served with a rather plain pickle, and some chopped onions, lemon and a green chilli. The Thums up was chilled. Only grievance was bad coffee - it was way too tasteless and milky for me.

Again a reasonable joint where you get almost everything but all veg food. The ambiance of the place is pretty average and so is the hygiene which they could work on slightly. I have tried veg chow,crispy babycorn,kulfi,pav bhaji, papdi chaats, bhel puri and ice gola from this place. The chinese is below average. The chaats are better here and the best part is the golas which they serve here specially kala khatta which is quite tasty. An average place if you're running out of options.

This place is located on the ground floor(front facing shop) of the emami market, in lord sinha road.It is quite close to shikshayatan school/college.Lord sinha road is street food paradise and this place offers everything available on the roadside shacks!There is nothing absolutely nothing to mention about the ambience and interiors.
On offer are chaats,sandwiches,indianchinese,north indian,south indian and sweets apart from several churans and titbits in packets.I have tasted their chaats which are probably the best thing to have here.The south indian is a big disappointment!I mean how can you mess with south indian? :/ Anyway,the sandwiches are okay and the chinese is terrible.
That pretty much sums up this place. 
P.S- If you want south indian go to the roadside stall in lord sinha road,chinese and momos, again roadside, puchka?roadside ;) pav bhaji ? and kulfi ? mayaram!

Much much better options available on the same street,go there!Riddhi siddhi is just pretentious food!No taste at all

This outlet on the ground floor of Emami Landmark seems to have seen better days. At one time it would be crowded, with lots of variety of food available. Though I am not a regular here, the place seems more run-down now, dirtier, and without as much variety. As is usually common, they forget what their speciality is and try to do a bit of everything, and land up doing much of nothing.

I recall their tikki cholas to be decent as were chillas. The latter no longer available. I recall having a lovely Raj Kachori some time back at a client's office adjacent. I assumed it was sourced from here, but they do not serve it any more I was told.

The general attitude about the place is unfriendly. The counter people cannot seem to be bothered.

Give it a miss.

Had been there many a times for lunch. Ambiance is not at all good as the waiters are ignorant. The shop was empty still we had to shout at them for extra napkins and water.
Half of the items in their menu are never available. They are cheapos as they don;t even want to provide extra paper plates.
God,they take such a long time to serve. Had been a fan of their Pav bhaji and samosas but everything changes with time. They are ridiculous.
DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT.

Simply awesome food with decent decor at a very reasonable price. The menu and photographs posted are not of this place.

Being a student of Shri ShikshaYatan school, I have lost count of the number of times ive eaten in this restaurant.
back then, it used to be really good. 
the puchkas were our favorite and the samosa chaat was to die for.
However, my visits stopped after i left the school, but for the past few months i visited this joint several times and every time i went there i was disappointed.
Half of the items on the menu isnt available EVER, so you've to go with what the staffs  say.
A total put down. This place has lost it's charm...
The 2.5 goes for the old times when it used to be my favorite place to treat my friends for every little reason !

being a student of shri shikshayatan for over 12 long years, ridhi sidhi has been a regular visit spot. The steamed momo with a delicious momo sauce has been my favourite ever since. Recently this place has been renovated with a little increase in the price rate,though being very cheap in the area and with a upgraded food quality. Chilli baby corn is also one of my favorite here. Ever coming to shop in EMAMI or STAR MARK, this place located at the ground floor of it, is a must visit. :-) ting!

Nice place... Have been here with my parents as a young child, with friends when i was in college and now when i am married, i be here with my wife whenever we want to visit a hassle free place and at the same time hygienic. Probably the only veg. restaurant in this area where you get quality street food at reasonable prices. Keep up the good work.!

I have been visiting this place since 2005 and quite like it. The prices haven't risen considerably since then. 
It is an only vegetarian restaurant. For a non-vegetarian like me, this is a good change. 
The place is simple, nothing extraordinary.
The service a little slow. 
Tikkis, Chola Bhatura, Pao Bhaaji are my personal favourites. 
They serve Chinese as well. 
Kulfis are good here.
Pocket friendly, meal for two will be something around 120.
