Haven't been here but my brother just got Kachori, sabji and jalebi for breakfast. The service was prompt and the food was hot even after my brother drove home.
Generally, kachori's get hard and you can't eat themm but this one was really soft. It didn't get hard even after keeping it for 7-8 hours. Taking about Jalebi, 2-3 jalebi's were slightly burnt but the taste was remarkable.

This is a good place if you want to have typical breakfast.

One of the heritage places in Calcutta which holds a special place in the hearts of every person. I happened to visit on a winter morning at 7am for breakfast and the food was served piping hot. The fluffy and soft kachoris accompanied with sabzi, chutney and fried chilli's along with hot and crisp jalebi's right out of the frying pan. The price point being normal at Rs.7/pc for whatever you pick is easy on the pocket.

P.S. try the outlet named "Maharaj" in the next lane for a better experience.

Had chaa..jalebi and packed 10 pieces of kachori. 
Though it is a bit pricey considering the road side shop but the taste will finally justify the price..

Have been sitting on this review for months. Visited this place on Navami, and was blown away by the taste. Fluffy and delicious kachuris with equally tasty sabji. That was awesome!! One of the best kachuris I have ever had. Period. The tea was very good too.
Will definitely visit this place again.

I have grown up in the neighborhood. It started as a small shop bang opposite of where it is now. It's become a sort of a cult. Though I am not a kachori person, the kachori served in a Sal pata has its own charm I guess. Hot masala chai and the jalebi and malpoa are my favourite. It's a must when in Kolkata.

Cloudy Saturday morning, raining slightly , and pair it up with hot kachoris, finger licking sabji and hot jalebis and bhar e cha ( won't spoil the flovor translating in English ;) )  My weekend couldn't start in a better way. 
Prompt service; take the plates and just stand and have it or u can also get served in cars if u park nearby. 
The kachori and sabji get served with chutney and a green chilly pickle. It's heavenly. 
Definitely stop here to have these and also don't forget to try their gulab jamun. I have tried that also and it's yum!

What will happen, if you got some great quality kachuri with some finger licking sabji? Well, if you are bong, I‚Äôm sure you mouth is already full with water. :P :P

Been there few days ago with one of my friend during the evening time. The shop situated near the Sarat Bose Road crossing, near the triangular park, towards the Lake Gardens. We reached the shop near about 8PM and still it was fully active and surrounded with crowd.

After waiting for some moments, our turns came. They offers you very limited some items from their small menu item. We ordered ‚Äì

Hing Kachori ‚Äì Probably one of the best Kachori, I‚Äôve ever tasted. Deep pouring from inside but soft and crunchy texture from outside brings some real authentic flavors of Bengal. The Kachori served with Aloo curry, with was also brilliantly cooked and goes perfectly well with the kachori.

Jelabi ‚Äì Forget about Haldirams or Gangurams, this is one of the best street Jelabi I‚Äôve ever had. Crunch outer layer but deep sweetness from Inside makes it really special.

Malpoa ‚Äì Well this in something, which you usually don‚Äôt get in every shop. It was big in size, crunchy and deep fried but juicy from inside. Love it.

Gulab jamun ‚Äì What could be the happier ending to end up your tiffin with some delicious hot gulab Jamun? Well this is something for which Maharai is also famous for! It was not too sweet unlike other shops but it had a rich flavor of sweet with some mouthwatering aroma. Fallen in love with it and also the must try item here.

Well, if you ask about pricing the most item here are around Rs. 7 which is very decent pricing! So in conclusion, I will say that, Maharani is one of the must stop destination for all kachuri lovers. Just have your tiffin here either in morning or in evening and it will surely make your mood awesome. Overall an over satisfactory Street food experience.

Maharaj and maharani 2 shops besides each other serving similar foods. Hing kachori, jalebi, masala tea etc. Starst serving from 5 am and closes very late. All the taxi and bus drivers starts their day having tea from here. All the morning walkers of the Rabindra sarovar lake area have kachories and jalebis as breakfast. Very tasty food and always bustling.

I've been to this shop countless number of times. Situated near the deshopriyo park crossing, it's not too hard to locate!! Almost everything is priced 7 rupees- be it samosa or jalebi or malpua or the ultrasoft gulab!!! Kochuri might be a little more priced!!! Everything is very very pocket friendly and mouthwatering! It's a very old shop..gets me nostalgic. The price factor mainly pulls the crowd. 
P.S : please do not expect an ambience or too much hygiene or seating arrangement...if you are a true bong foodie..then go!!

The kochuri & sabji is good. I have been here many times. People throng this food joint to have a perfect hot plate of kochuri. Hot jalebi is also available. Only drawback that i found is that the kochuri is a bit too thick, which is not that tasty as soon as the hotness goes away, also since it is too thick sometimes inside the kochuri it is not that well cooked. But a must try out snacks joint.

Want to experience a bengali's weakness! You have got to have hing er kochuri with alur tarkari, followed by Jilipi (Jalebi) and topped off by Doodh Cha, preferably for breakfast . Ideal recipe for acidity, but when has a Bengali ever worried about it when faced with the temptation of food. Now you will find a plethora of options in this city with shops spread all over Calcutta like mushrooms, but there are only a few who are almost peerless. Maharani is one such. Immensely popular in the whole of South Calcutta, you must have the Kochuri here if you have not already. I will not even try to explain the experience, because it is not possible. Just come here and freak out.

This place used to be a part and parcel of our lives back in school days. After the classes were over and before heading to tuitions around that area, this place saved the hungry rowdy souls over and over again.

This place saw us grow. From Kochuri-Torkari-Jilipi to Kochuri-Torkari-Chaa-Cigarette.
It's amazing how fast time flies; even after 7years it seems like last year when us adorned in our uniforms walked down the streets of Southern Avenue, laughing.

The special ones are Puri ( with potato preparation , unlike the dal available in Bengali restaurant) , Hot Jilabi with kesar smell . The tea is famous but this is the North Indian tea ( tea made in milk ) - a normal one and a special one . 
You will be served in your car even and can stand and eat. The behaviour of the staff is very good .

A very popular place in Deshapriya park. They serve piping hot kachoris and jalebis. Both the items are heavenly. An excellent place for quick bites.

This place is awesome, easy to locate once you're in Desopriyo Park. No seating arrangements but the food here just kills it (in a good way xD). You can go on having kochuris with the lovely torkari on and on not worrying about the expense. Please do have gulab jamun here, it's a must try especially if it's served hot.

Its a legendary bangali breakfast outlet of kachori and alur tarkari,jilipi etc.I love their kachoris like anything.The tamarind chutney they add in the alur tarkari gives it that extra zing.Kachoris are served hot,crisp and fresh.Among the sweets I really like their malpua and jilipi.

Nothing beats Kachuri and Jilipi in the morning. Breakfast in this part of the world is often associated best with these. And Maharani stands out to be the best. Go for it, the morning will be made.

A bunch of friends from college, we keep coming back to this place whenever the heart wishes to. And obviously holds a special note in the list. Best quality food. I wont really want to talk about hygiene as because the taste of their kachori and jalebi will make you eat to your heart's content ignoring the flaws. And about price? Have quite a filling meal within Rs. 50.

Am always a BIG fan of kachori and alu sabzi...and wanted to try them from Maharani...after seeing so many good reviews.
Went there on a rainy evening, and was not disappointed!
Superb kachoris and tasty alu sabzi with malpoa made my dinner :)
Although the malpoa can be improved a lot!

Location: If you're coming from Gariahat side, turn left from Deshapriya park 4-way crossing.
Walk a few meters, cross Theo road and you should be able to see this shop.

I went there today at 9:30 in the morning and I was the only customer then.

I had 2 hung kachoris and a jalebi which cost me 21 bucks.

The kachoris were tasty and so was the 'aloo subzi' . 2 kachori were enough for a big guy like me. But, I didn't get any scent of 'hing' (asafetida) !

The jalebi was still warm, drenched in sugar syrup and was crispy! Full marks for it.

Be it Maharani or Maharaja, the craving is still the same. After a long walk towards Deshopriyo Park, my mind would always crave for it's tea and singara.

This shop is doing business for long and they are regarded as iconic 'cha-singara' shops in the city.

It is in these small little places where you get to taste real indian food without any jazz. The mouth watering,lip smacking sabzi kachori, the sweet tamarind chutney with the masaledaar samosa,the crunchy(yes u read that right) malpuaas just fresh off the kadai(pot) and the perfect cup of Indian chai dashing it off with jalebis.BLISS! Never have I ever found this place empty which just goes on to show how good food gets made despite the place. A must for anyone on a real indian food trail or low on budget or someone who appreciates eating good food(healthy or not)

Maharani or be its next door neighbour Maharaja, does not need any introduction. Be it their tea or the early morning breakfast, this place has been the most popular choice among everyone and remains crowded throughout the day. Sunday mornings are incomplete without having the kochuri and jilipi from here, which are probably the best in South Kolkata.

Best kochuri seller in south kolkata is this low maintained shop in deshapriya park. Early morning breakfasts to late evening snacks same quality is maintained all over. Don't go about their hygiene, just come and order yourself a plate of kachori ( rather shaal paata- r baati) and in sweets jalebi, malpowa are the best. You can end your snacks with a hot cup of tea in a chaa er bhaar ( earthen tea cups). This place gives proper feel of calcuttan heritage. So if you haven't yet tried this one, then make plans to visit soon.

Located opp the  Monalisa guest house(of Kahaani fame), this place is age old. My dad used to get breakfast every Sunday morning from here. The hing kachori and jalabi is to die for. üòç The demand from customers of this place is insane! One should go there in the morning around 7-7:30 or 6 ish in the evening to physically witness the crazy demand.  Oh and you should not miss the special tea also! The food is always served hot and fresh. Must try!

Well I had no idea that this place is famous for  kachoris and jalebis, till one of my friends told me about it when we were crossing the joint. Well that was during the pujas. The place was so crowded. They were making hot jalebis. So we ordered kachoris and jalebis. The kachoris were just about ok. And the sabzi served with it was below average. Pretty cheap though. And with that amount of crowd you can say it's a pretty popular joint.

Maharani is happen to be one of the legendary places in the city a foodie should visit once in their food journey.

**Location**
Located very near to the Kalighat metro station. Maharani itself is a landmark so anyone around can spot it for you.

**Experience**
Being a cult place in the city this place itself has its own charm. 'Adda' in real sense is so not worth without a maharani tea. Hot and fresh singara , hing er kochuris are one of the popular snacks there. Malpoa , gulab jamuns are the perfect sweet extravaganza options here. Loved it totally.

I have been a fan of this quaint and tiny shop at Deshapriya Park since childhood and when I joined an office near to this amazing and breakfast and snacks joint, it was as if Christmas had come early. A treat from here is a regular affair and the items include Samosa, Hing Kachori, Jalebi, Malpua, Gulab Jamun and a tangy chilli achaar. All the items are prized at Rs.7, though the size of the samosas are steadily becoming smaller - much to my dismay! However, big or small, I just cannot do without my regular dose of fried delights from here.

Maharani is our all time favourite place for a quick evening hunger or early morning kolkata tour. This brings you nostalgia of old Kolkata, adda with a cup of tea and that of "shaalpata". Although their kochuri and jilipi needs no introduction, you should try their hot gulabjamun.

Maharani has been serving some lovely breakfast for years now and it has a wonderful reputation which drags people to this place. I have been a fan of this place because of their delicious kachories and they never disappoint. The taste and quality has been the same since the first time I tasted here. It has been many a times I had my breakfast here and today was another day. I took these things:
#Special Tea : If you have this once you will definitely visit this place once again to have tea.
#Hing Kachori : I wont say much, eat it to believe it. The aloo sabzi which they give is another stunner to get you rolling
#Jalebi : The best among the best. The crispy sweet jalebi is something special out here. Do not dare to miss this.

Last words:
Very easy to locate.Just opposite to Monalisa Guest House in Deshapriya Park. The price and the taste will give you all the happiness possible for that moment.

4/5 for value for money

This place is an age old favourite to every Bengali in South Kolkata. When I had my music classes at Dakshinee, we used to often stand by here for my evening tiffin after school. The Bangali style Kachuri and Aloor Torkari with glimpses of Chhola into it absolutely brightened up my face. I also loved their Singara (more for the chutney served with it) and the Jilipi. Haven't been here for ages since when I left music lessons. I miss this place so much. Have to explore this place very soon. Truly. Happy Dining! :)

This is a small outlet located almost opposite the BPCL petrol pump at deshpriya park. You can recognise the place easily in the mornings by the huge crowd in front of it. U get tasty, hot hot hing kachoris which are served with aloo curry and pickle/chillies. The kachoris taste amazing and u can't stop at 2 pieces, which is the basic serving. They serve jalebis and gulab jamuns also. We could see a huge crowd having the special tea also. 
A must visit place !

Maharani is one of the most legendary street snacks shop in Kolkata. Well why not, I reached there at 8.30pm & they were frying hot Kachoris. Tell me who else do that at that time. This clearly proves their high sell rate. Even at dinner time people try their Kachoris, Sweets & Tea.

Location : Maharani is located just straight from Kalighat Metro towards Rash Behari Ave then take right turn. Its just old simple shop but don't confuse it with Maharaja that is located on the next lane.

Decoration : Its very old fashioned, normal snacks shop with no sittings. Foods are kept open towards roadside so its not hygienic in some sense. Used plates are washed on road in front of the shop, so expect a dirty ambience over here.

Foods : They have quite an options to choose from Kachoris, Samosas to Sweets & they are all fresh. They prepare them now & then so availability of foods are there almost anytime.

Hing Kachori : The Hing Kachoris was big & puffy. Little crunchy & soft combination of hot Kachori felt good. Deep pouring inside was making it real tasty. Provided potato curry with it was spicy & tasty too. Overall their Kachori tasted very good & its authentic too.

Jalebi : Jalebi was big & crunchy fried. It was excessive sweet due to their rich sweet sauce. But it tasted good.

Malpoa : Malpoa was big, brown, crunchy & juicy from inside. Rich sugar sauce made it extremely sweet but it tasted good.

Gulab Jamun : It was one of the best item of Maharani. There Gulab Jamun tasted completely different than what we found in sweet shops. It was not very sweet but a dark rich flavour was present. It tasted excellent & its a must try if you visit Maharani.

Tea : At last I tried their Normal Tea provided in a clay pot. Tea was dark & a rich fragrance was present. Tea tasted very very good & its must for tea lovers.

Pricing : At the time of writing this review all of their dishes are priced at Rs. 7. Thus it becomes a pocket friendly food counter too.

Conclusion : Maharani offers excellent street food experience at very pocket friendly prices. With very good food quality Maharani deserves its higher rating & its a must visit for snacks lovers.

This place is undoubtedly the best breakfast and snacks joint in this city. Located just whiskers away from Deshapriya Park crossing,this place offers the best Hing Kachori,Samosha and Jalebi in town. The hing kachori is served with a chilli pickle which enhances its taste. The icing in cake is their gulab jamun which is famous for its sponginess and for the fact that it is served hot. Didn't like their special tea that much though. Overall, a pocket friendly take-away but it is very much congested at times and it could have done more business with the introduction of a seating arrangement.

One of the best place to have a steaming hot cup of tea with mouth watering samosas or jalebis. Situated just past Deshpriya Park towards Southern Avenue, on the right hand side it is a small shop but man do they sell like crazy. The crowd is constant mainly consisting of college goers and school children with office goers also enjoying the tea there. It is really worth going again and again should u be passing the place or not. GREAT

Kachori-Nice only when had fresh and hot along with the sabji. They also give a chilli condiment which tastes great.

Jalebi-A tad sugary and has a buttery after effect in the mouth.

Gulag Jamun-Very soft,melt in the mouth and decently priced.

It is a good,decent and pocket friendly place.I would exercise the option of having food here only during the winter/monsoons and for take away. During summers(which is most of the time) the sabji goes bad very soon(maybe because they start selling from early morning).The ambience is very rustic as its a roadside shop (hence I prefer the take away option).I hope they add some more variety for customers to choose from.

Did your wife force you out of the bed on a Sunday Morning to lose some weight and be a fitness freak? Do you want to know how to gain back all those precious calories you had earned by working hard? Drop by here post your morning walk and you shall be able to devour yourself into a magical world of delightful breakfast.

This place needs no introduction to the people of Kolkata, less the people of South Kolkata. A popular joint serving delicious and piping hot snacks, this is an ideal venture for morning walkers. Their Hing Kachoris, served with lipsmacking Alu Sabji and then accompanied with the pickle and Aachar, can make your world go crazy. The Kachoris are pulled up straight from the oil, but they are completely dry by themselves. The entire lot gets consumed within a matter of minutes. So, evidently, coming to this place needs a lot of patience.

To end the meal, try having their Jalebis or their freshly prepared Gulab Jamuns. A perfect way to pamper your tastebuds and make your gloomy life turn to a happy one. Pocket pinch is almost negligible. Definitely recommended to everyone.

I was told that Maharani was the BEST breakfast place in Kolkata. So after a brief walk in the Rabindra Sarovar Lake went straight to Maharani. There was a huge crowd and it was difficult to break through for my turn. It basically looks like a street side shop and hygiene is definitely a concern.

We ordered kachori subzi, singara, jalebi, Gulab jamun and special tea. Kachori subzi along with chillis were no doubt one of the best. Singhara was nice. Gulab jamun and jalebis were extraordinary. Special tea was excellent too.

No doubt the food is brilliant and prices are extremely cheap. But definitely the place needs a revamp. Can visit once for the food alone.

Maharani on Sarat bose road, is just iconic . Something I grew up with . It was like a tradition for us CRC rowing gang to meet up at Maharani for breakfast & tea every Sunday . It's 12 years now that I've been living & working outside India , but Maharani's yummm kachoris, alu sabzi with the green chili, malpuha & jelabi continue to be my hot favorire . I make it a point to grab a bite there when ever I'm visiting Kolkata. It's strange that my hubby and kids too have developed a deep liking to Maharani food. Awesome is the only word to describe it. Keep it up guys.

When we were a child this was the only joint of it's kind. I have been going to this place from my childhood. The taste has not changed. The ambiance remains the same. The food is served hot so minimum chance of getting stomach problem. This is a nice place to have your morning breakfast after shedding some calories in the nearby Dhakuria Lake.

One of the classic joints in kolkata to enjoy a good adda over jalebis,kachoris&singharas. The menu is heavenly,the joint is always crowded with the famous pseudointellectuals of kolkata creating a good experience overall.

Maharani on Sarat bose road, is just iconic . Something I grew up with . It was like a tradition for us CRC rowing gang to meet up at Maharani for breakfast & tea every Sunday . It's 12 years now that I've been living & working outside India , but Maharani's yummm kachoris, alu sabzi with the green chili, malpuha & jelabi continue to be my hot favorire . I make it a point to grab a bite there when ever I'm visiting Kolkata. It's strange that my hubby and kids too have developed a deep liking to Maharani food. Awesome is the only word to describe it. Keep it up guys.

Maharani needs no introduction to the residents of southern Calcutta even though it is a nondescript little shop about the size of a kitchen of a large apartment!!! It has a steady stream of customers from the moment it opens in the morning!

The kachouris and the accompanying potato curry are indeed worth those 10-15 minutes of standing in the sun or even a drizzle. First timers don't forget to top it off with some of their freshly made sweets. It's "calorific" but will keep you in good humour for the rest of your day.

Note: please stay away if you are allergic to oily and greasy street food. Or don't eat more than 2-4 kachouris!

Had bookmarked this place since a long time and had also heard about it from a lot of people. Finally checked this place out with my flatmates, located at a stone throw's distance from my flat in Deshapriya park, on Lansdowne road. This place seems to be always thronged with customers who have been a staunch fan of the yummy kachoris,lip smacking gulab jamuns,samosas , malpoa and mishti doi. We tried out the kachoris with the aloo curry, it was delicious. The singaras were also good. But the best were the hot freshly prepared gulab jamuns. Low price and good quality ...perfect place to treat your taste buds during evening hunger pangs.

It deserves nothing less than a 4.5! There's a reason why this corner of the street is always packed. I grew up eating 'kochuris' and 'jilipis' from this joint. After moving out from Kolkata, i haven't been able to visit maharani. And I'm surprised to see (on the zomato menu) that kachoris are STILL just 7 rupees! And if you're looking for crisp hot jalebis in this city, maharani is it! An absolute (insanely) pocket friendly place where you won't regret binging! If you haven't been there, well... you must!

If you happen to walk or drive past this place, stop! And have a few steaming hot hinger kochuri and jilipi. You'll not regret.

And it's a perfect hangover cure :P

Piping hot kochuris with the equally exceptional sabzi accompanied with the chilli pickle and the sweet chutney ... what more does one want in life early In the morning ? ok may be a few hot samosas and few delectable gulab jamuns and jalebis.  And rest assured one can find them at Maharanis. It has been a regular haunt for an early breakfast for me for years as it has been to many of zomato peeps. No frills no bs only good food ambiance .. and ohh the tea is not to bad as well . Pocket friendly too.

This is one of our favourite breakfast joints in the city. We pay our customary visit to this renowned jalebi joint every sunday after morning walks. Adjacent to this is maharaja which is equally good and serve similar food

Service: u have to make ur way through to get your stuff in the crowd. The kachoriwalas are expert at serving you fast enough. 5/5
Food and taste: try out the kachoris and the jalebis. Their gulabjamuns are good too. 5/5
Value for money: satisfactory
Pocket pinch: 20-30 for each person.

Also do not forget their chai in the big and medium 'bhaars'

It is a normal roadside eatery of South kolkata where you get kochuri, aloo sabji, singara, jalebi etc but trust me I never had any stomach problem neither they use cheap quality oil so one can be rest assured of all those facts.

Sunday morning walk is incomplete for dwellers in Southern Avenue areas and surrounding without breakfast from Maharani. Huge queue and rush but fast service and not a single order slips away. Freshness guaranteed and live kitchen to witness the same.

First, order for Hing Kachori which vanishes with blink of an eye after been drained out from boiling oil. Second, for your sweet tooth must order should be gigantic Jalebis and Gulab Jamun.¬†Lastly, while you are waiting for your order take a sip of tea served here in an earthen pot.

Hing Kachori was flaky and not drenched in oil. To enjoy Hing Kachori with Aloo Sabzi one must not miss to ask for chilli pickle available here. Jalebi and Gulab Jamuns are not overkill with sweetness. Must better than those branded establishments sell these with 3-4 times more price. Tea will surely make you addict of them.

Price is dirt cheap but packaging is pathetic. Be careful of dripping items while carrying it. This is the only thing I didn't like or else full marks was assured from my side too.

Imagine this, a cool hazy sunny winter morning in Kolkata when the hustle bustle has not yet started. On a street corner opposite the Mona Lisa Guesthouse where the movie Kahaani was shot, a small crowd of people mostly in their pajamas are standing and gorging on kachoris and jalebi. The bliss that is the food served here and the very true to the Kolkata local experience, this is an absolute no-frills max delight breakfast option. Kachoris with a spicy aloo sabzi and fresh warm jalebis which top it off beautifully. Not to be missed.

This legendary place serves awesome kachoris, samosas, jalebis, tea and gulab jamuns. I had my Sunday breakfast from this joint several times in the past and when today I was having my breakfast from this place again I decided to pen down this quick review. Today the place was moderately crowded when I reached there at around 7 am, the place was filled with few satisfied souls having their food there and the aroma of kachoris in the air.

LOCATION -----  You can reach this place easily from Deshapriya Park crossing, it is close to the famous Zeeshan outlet there right opposite the petrol pump and diagonally opposite the quite popular Monalisa Guest House (that was featured in the Bollywood movie 'Kahani'). The place has an old signboard that reads Maharani.

FOOD -----  I ordered for one cup of tea as soon as I reached there, the optimally sweetened flavorful tea is served in big clay containers called 'bhaar'. After having my morning tea I placed my take-away order that consisted of Kachoris & aloo subji, jalebis, samosas and gulab jamuns. They provide one lovely chutney and chilly pickle along with the Kachoris. The Kachoris have got generous dal filling inside it and the aloo subji tastes really well and is pretty honest and unadulterated. The jalebis are the best, must try and they are quite big and finely crafted. Gulab jamuns and samosas are okay according to me and tastes pretty well during the breakfast hours since all these are prepared fresh. 

AMBIANCE -----  The place has got no sit-n-eat provision. It is placed right beside the pavement, so you can have your food while standing there on the pavement and get ready refills whenever required, or you may opt for take-aways. The shop is wide open and you can see people preparing all the food right in front of you.

SERVICE -----  The service is very prompt and the people serving the food are quite polite and helpful. Payment is obviously accepted only in cash. The price is very reasonable and pocket-friendly.

OVERALL ----- The place has got great value-for-money quotient, it is one such place where you find people from various socioeconomic backgrounds enjoying their plate of Kachoris and jalebis. You will find people coming there in their swanky sedans as well as rickshaw pullers or taxi drivers, it thus portrays a true picture of our nation on that pavement right in front of the shop. It is one must-visit joint serving lovely tiffin and breakfast, go try them out if you haven't!

Cheers!

If you have been born and beaten up in Kolkata, you have already been to Maharani. But since you are reading this review, you have not. If you have already made peace with the deep fried kachori/luchi with bhaji and fried green chilli, hop onto your bike and go to Maharani an hour after sunrise and you will love it, especially if its drizzling on a cold winter morning. Its located on the Sarat Bose Road about 300m from the Xrong Place turn.

Make sure you have the legendary tea. It's not as awesome as the steamed chai at Balwant Singh etc, but the morning ambience is going to make it surreal.

Indeed a hidden gem , this place is located at southern avenue near deshapriya park , some few seconds away from zeeshan.  Two kachoris for 6rs per piece gives sheer bliss. This has been a special place for me since my childhood school days when i used to troll around this area and have their ''garam kochuri'' with alu and chilly achaar. now i mostly pack food from here.

The Kachori and alu sabzi with the chutney and chopped chillies is amazing. The taste has been the same for the last 15 or so years......

If you have been born and beaten up in Kolkata, you have already been to Maharani. But since you are reading this review, you have not. If you have already made peace with the deep fried kachori/luchi with bhaji and fried green chilli, hop onto your bike and go to Maharani an hour after sunrise and you will love it, especially if its drizzling on a cold winter morning. Its located on the Sarat Bose Road about 300m from the Xrong Place turn.

Make sure you have the legendary tea. It's not as awesome as the steamed chai at Balwant Singh etc, but the morning ambience is going to make it surreal.

Indeed a hidden gem , this place is located at southern avenue near deshapriya park , some few seconds away from zeeshan.  Two kachoris for 6rs per piece gives sheer bliss. This has been a special place for me since my childhood school days when i used to troll around this area and have their ''garam kochuri'' with alu and chilly achaar. now i mostly pack food from here. Do try this place out sometime.

This is the only place that can make me enjoy the two food items I detest: Kachori and potatoes. If a person like me can finish off a plate of Kachori-alu dum and crave for more, then be rest assured you will love it.

Round it off with one of the best teas served in South Calcutta and amazing hot pantua. Perfect, especially if it has just rained :')

If Rs 30 can get you immense happiness and gratify your taste buds, then Maharani surely is the place to be doing just that. The name, smell and sight of all that it has to offer simply fills me up. 

Whenever I'm visiting Calcutta, Maharani is my first pit stop for a cup of tea and plate full of Kochuri before I reach home. It all starts with a 'bhaar' of cha (tea in clay cup) and an order of a plate of kochuri. By the time you finish the cha and crack the 'bhaar' in the dustbin, you will have your kochuri bathed in steaming hot 'aloo r torkari' (aloo curry) with chillies in a spicy mix on top, in your hands. A bite of the puffy yet crispy kochuris, dipped in the aloo r torkari explodes in your mouth with an overwhelming taste of 'hing' (asafoetida) 
and a flurry of other spices. After 3 such plate fulls, I always top up my meal with hot jalebis. This amazing food at Maharani is however best enjoyed on a wintry morning. Probably its the best way to wake your senses up, before the city wakes up!

Maharani by its looks is a simple kachori-jalebi shop at southern avenue. It looks simple , serves simple food but the taste is not at all simple. It is just awsome ; it is just one of the best. 

Location -- maharani is located at a very easy to locate area. Come to deshopriyo park more. Walk on the foot of royal lebanese towards rabindra sarobar lake. U will find maharani on the right side. Don't confuse with maharaja which is just some steps away. 

Ambience -- no such ambience. Just a simple kachori jalebi shop serving delicious snacks. This place is mostly crowded by office goers and students and other people who come to lake to have a walk. Even the most figure and health conscious people cannot resist the lip smacking kachoris. 

Food -- the menu is simple. Kachoris, samosa , gulab jamuns , jalebis and other simple items. But the tarkari is cooked to perfection. The chutney served is just yum and is perfect with the dish. And to add to the deliciousness we have the mirch achar. Yumm yumm yumm. Everytime i come i decide to come another time and the most important thing i mainly come to southern avenue to have a taste from this place. 

Totally recommended for a quick bite and an unhealthy breakfast.

If you like the street tea along with samosas or kachori subzi, this is the place to be. Just that you can't stand and eat here, it's utterly filthy, car service by the shop boys is still better. Unlike most dhabas owned by sardarjis in Kolkata, tea is tastier and better. All the more at one third the price. 

Since Bengalis are very fond of sweets, gulab Jamuns is ubiquitously available at all street joints in Kolkata, and this no exception. Never tried though coz my sweet tooth is lost...

*Wake up in the morning feeling all pumped up and determined to exercise and stay fit ever after*
*Go for a walk around the lake*
Then on the way back home lies the Food-Satan --Maharani standing proudly with her calorie laden delicacies amidst the host of other food joints.
Not even the most determined and health conscious person can resist the urge of trying out the Fresh hot kachoris. I mean seriously, the kachoris they serve at Maharani are THAT GOOD!
The kachori platter comes with Kachoris served with aloo sabji (occasionally one might even find bits and pieces of paneer in the aloo sabji) alongside a sweet chutney and some "lonkar achar".....  Irresistibly delicious!!
Apart from the kachoris, they also have samosas, jalebis, gulab jamun and malpoa.
And all of these come at damn cheap prices. 
I've been here innumerable times before and I for sure will get back to Maharani for more of the delicious kachoris and jalebis.

One of the best roadside kochuris I've had in Kolkata. A must visit place for every foodie out there who doesn't mind oily food. Just one visit to Maharani for the kochuries and jalebi has made a very lasting impact. Although the sabji was a little too spicy but the piping hot succulent kochuries balanced it out and then some more.

The reason I like Maharani is because I have been visiting this store since my childhood and monsoon evenings meant a trip to this snack shop just a little ahead of Deshapriya Park crossing. The piping hot kachauri with alu sabji and green chilli pickle was something that was awesome. The snack would definitely end with a bite of hot and sweet Jalebis. Do, go for malpuas also if you wish to pamper your sweet tooth even further. Pocket-friendly, though the only con is that you have to stand and eat the snacks outside the store even as pedestrians walk past you.

Maharani a place right opposite Monalisa guest house situated right at the corner of the lane. Always buzzing with a lot of people for the limited but tasty food they serve. They serve the samosa, small quantities of kachori, jalebi and other sweets in the traditional 'shaal pata', although there is also an option of having your food in a steel plate. The morning kachori is simply magnificent. Piping hot kachori is served with hot, mildly spicy sabzi topped with a spoonful of tangy chatni to enhance the taste. It is a must visit for the jalebi lovers to take a bite at the hot jalebis made in front of you. A perfect combination of a crunching bite, sweetness and the correct amount of sourness to tingle your taste buds. Apart from the great food they serve, another tasty thing is their 'tea'. For a reasonable price you get a tasty cup of tea that will take your tiredness away. They also serve their food in the cars.
A place visited by many bengalis and a must visit for kachori, jalebi and tea lovers.

Located at the exact X-ing of Rashbehari Ave. and Sarat Bose Road , Maharani is a true 'queen' of gastronomically conscious Kolkatans. Don't go by the cover of the book, as the shop looks worn down and resembles any other old school 'samosa - kachori'¬† shop. But , over the years they have been serving the best daal kachoris and samosas in South Kolkata , period. We tried the famed kachoris, served hot , freshly made ,careful about burning your tongue though.. same with the samosas... very very fresh and best quality ingredients. These are served with chilly pickles and red sauce which ooze out pure taste... insanely tasty.. At the end we washed down the deep fried stuff with milk tea.. now the tea is pure nirvana.. I didn't know it comes in small(which we had) and also a BIG size... in this rainy afternoon I tasted pure bliss...¬†
Sadly I didn't have time to taste their famed jalebis or pantuas.. Need to savour those some time soon.
Maharani is a gastronomical experience and she will keep me calling back for sure.
Happy dining till then :)

Perfect for morning breakfast nd evening snacks..the place is crowded nd situated at the main road,nd myt hv to jostle to find a proper plc to stand and devour..easily one of the best places in kolkata for kachouri nd subzi as well as jalebis. Their subzi taste bttr dn wat is served at most places nd is 1 of d highlight points of this plc. A cup of piping hot tea along wid kachouri subzi nd jalebis ll definitely make ur day without ny pocket pinch.. must try if u hvnt bn to this plc..dont look for ny ambience nd just go for the royal taste.

because every morning after workout at the southern avenue lake he used to drop in at maharani for some kachuri and sabji, which he claimed are the best, one can get in the southern part of the city. i had no option but to agree with him, the first day i had kachuri and sabji here. they are hot and raving. they serve a reddish sweet chutney with it and green chilly with masala marinate. this combination is just out of the world.
samosas are equally good.
but the jalabis and the hot gulab jamuns are a treat to the taste buds.
now i don't blame him anymore.. :p

One of my....rather our favourite joints in South calcutta.awesome tasty namkeens with equally worse after effects.a cup of tea is jist fine . Any other items like kachori, shingara or likewise is going to leave a thick layer of  dalda inside your mouth.and to top it up, have water......that's it.your day is going to end up with major acidity.

Early morning go to the Lake for a walk and then drop by Maharani for the kochuri and alur sobji and start your day with a gastronomical adventure. This is one of the oldest joint in South Kolkata for early morning snacks. The demand is so much that people come and wait here even before the shop opens. I have visited the joint several times with friends after a late night somewhere that side of the city or just went for an early morning drive after a whole night of adda. Tge perfect place to feel your tummy after a night long adda.

Maharani has history.Originally this eatery served working class people as an afternoon snack joint in a shop opposite to where they are now,where a swank hotel now stands.
Kachori with a kickass alu bhaji,samosas made the cow belt style,jalebis hot from the kadai,a secret recipe chai just about sums up the menu.but boy do they know how to do this limited fare well?You bet they do!
With the start of the health and healthy fad,and well to do pot bellied gentlemen sauntering out for their morning walks towards the Rabindra Sarobar Lakes,Maharani metamorphosed into a serious breakfast place so the wealthy and the poor mingled wonderfully to regain the calories they have spent walking and working hard.And oh yes,there was a Maharaja as well,another shop with the same menu just down the road.
Lest I forget,I must mention the mirch ka achar they gleefully serve along with the kachori on the sides of your salpata plate.Mixed with the sauce of the Alu Bhaji it becomes a concoction straight out of culinary heaven.And just when you are panting at the heat of the kachori and the chillies comes the hot jalebis and the sweet chai.......Bon appetit!!!!!

For the humblest, tastiest garma-garam kachoris on the southern-end of Lansdowne Road, Maharani is the joint to land up in! She is the quintessential queen of the hing-thing!
A tip: While they won't serve you just one kachori (the guy will give you that stern 'maaf-karo' look), request the chap to give them 'one-by-one'. That way, not only is he reassured that you're there to stay, but you will actually enjoy them even more and won't have the runny gravy make your second kachori all soggy while you're devouring the first!
I normally end up having three at best, with one samosa/jalebi (depending on which one looks fresher and you cannot turn a blind eye to), followed by piping hot masala chai that well, kills the remotest possibilities of 'ombol'!
Last Tip: As in all things in life, just don't overdo it!

It is located in South Kolkata near Desopriyo Park.The place is famous for Hing Kachori and Sabzi ,specially Chai.The place is always fully crowded,hardly any place to stand or park the car.
There was a time every Thursday I visited to Sai Baba Mandir it's a fixed going back home have to stop over there and eat something.
Food we have Hong Kachori and sabzi which serves hot and really tasty to eat.Secondly Hot Crispy Jalebi are mouthwatering and its yummy to taste.

A nice place for breakfast or Evening Snack as well as pocket friendly.

Just situated opposite to the Monalisa Guest House in Sarat Bose Road and correctly named, this place indeed is a Maharani of the great Bengali fast food!! Always brimming with people and very less space to stand and eat properly, this place is always crowded and there's hardly any Bengali who has not been here and not tried their world famous in Kolkata "Kachori"! Deep fried and served hot and fresh with some chutney it's quite a feast if you are in the mood for some hard core Bengali junk food. 
What I really like about them is of course again their jalebi! Being a complete jalebi devotee all my life I can't get enough of these sugary sweet jalebis! They are super delicious, crisp and served hot! They are also made live just in front your eyes, where a person twirls his hands expertly and deep fries these little pieces of heaven!
Though I don't drink tea I have been told time and time again by my father who swears by their tea, how supremely delicious their tea is! 
Very very easy on the pockets and supremely tasty inside your mouth, please give this place a try if you haven't already.

This place is busiest in the morning... Breakfast with hing kachori and jelebi followed by boiling hot tea is a classic..

One had to either get the stuff packed or eat the stuff outside the shop in the pavement..... Well there quite a crowd and you will love to jostle around to get your order... Believe me you will love each moment of it.

This is the kind of place which makes south Kolkata the place it is. Anyone who lives in or around south Kolkata knows and have been to Maharani undoubtedly. It is a very popular joint for all the morning walkers . After morning walk at the lake on a Sunday bray morning one tend to go to Maharani for a cup of fresh masala tea and streaming hot kochuri and sabji with green chilli achar.

Undoubtedly the best kachori sabzi in the area! A very old outlet with so many memories attached. Their kachori sabzi is a lavish treat. The kachoris have urad filling and the sabzi tastes amazing. The green chilli spiced is a good accompaniment to the kachoris.¬†
I have also their their samosa and jilibi and both wer nice ( Though I have had better jalebis)¬†

A nice place for a hearty breakfast. Extremely pocket friendly!

I don't know how they can call Lucchis as Kachori.There was no lentil filling inside the 'Kachori' and no hing smell either.The owner was an illiterate rude arrogant guy.I will better have the original Kachori at established places than this crappy place.

I had some lipsmackingly tasty kachoris straight from the wok with a potato curry on the side livened up with green chillies. Made me ask for seconds. The second lot, which was fried a bit later, had the crunch and there was an amazing smell of hing. I followed these with a cup of hot chai in a bhaar or earthen cup and jilipis. 
The owner, Ram Chandra Gupta, who doesn‚Äôt waste his time with frivolous stuff like smiles, said that his shop is close to 40 years old. About  12 yrs in the new location. He had come to Kolkata from Varanasi.

Maharani.. The name of this shop is synonymous to awesome kachoris. This is quite well-known among the kachori lovers of South Kolkata. People lose their calories in the morning at Rabindra Sarobar and regain them here afterwards. I love their kachoris... Hot, yummy, kachoris with awesome sabji can make anybody's day.The jalebis are sweet calorie bombs.. But who cares?... I like their malpoa as well. All in all an awesome shop for the kachori lovers.

Super fast service, stemming hot tea be out winter or summer. Smiling and warm guys for service. Along with tea you have option for samosas or puri - sabji. Both is a recommendation.
A nice way to stay your Sunday, relaxed and simple just a simple tracks is good enough for the place. 
Small lane but they do service inside the car so no worry as you can wind your windrow and cut off from the crowd. Though crowd is decent and everyone is in themselves only.

Writing a ‚Äúreview‚Äù for MAHARANI is kind of tricky/funny as this has become almost an extended kitchen for me over the years‚Ä¶ be it after that morning/evening walk ,a nagging headache or just-like that hunger pangs..their kachuri-jalebi-special chaye (in that order) have always done the magic .easy to locate (near deshopriyo park crossing),easy on pocket Maharani is that quitessential  ‚Äúadda over cha‚Äù destination that can never go wrong. Tip- do not forget to ask for the mirchi chatni with your kochuri for that added kick ÔÅä

Located opposite Mona Lisa Guest House (made famous by Vidya Balan-starrer Kahaani), Maharani (which calls itself Maharaja) is South Calcutta's premier street-side eatery. They have some four items on the menu - Hing Kachori, Samosa, Malpoa and Jalebi - all of which are made like hot cakes and sold like hot cakes. 
Best recommended for post-morning walks breakfasts, it is guaranteed to put back all the calories you lose :-)
One mystery: All my life in Calcutta, I knew it as Maharani. Zomato lists it as Maharani. Why does it call itself Majaraja? When did it transform? Has the Maharani moved somewhere else? What???

Maharani is a famous South Calcutta road side tea stall. it is a place where you can fine morning walkers, evening passerby, college goers, office goers, lovebirds. Infact all kind of age groups. there is no place to sit by still people doesn't mind diving into the food.

Location: If you are walking from the four head deshapriya park crossing to southern avenue, you will find Maharani on your right hand side.

Foods you can order -¬†
Kachori
Jalebi
Samosa
Malpua
Chai

The hot Hing kachori with aloo and chutny is something you could sink your teeth into. The Jalebi is also something which you wouldn't want to have only one. The best time to go to Maharani is either early morning around 7-8 o clock or early evening around 5-6 pm for mouth watering hot Jalebi. ¬†

Pocket Pinch - It is very very Cheap. Say about within 30 Rs your entire appetite is full.

Bon Appetite !!

When you are somewhere near deshapriya park, and you need to bridle your tummy and also that too when you have only 30 bucks to spend. This place is a saviour. Kolkata would have lost her charm without this street sight 'kochuri' stalls. Maharani is one of those legendary stalls. Get yourself 4 or 5 kochuris and jalebi or gulabjamun in the end. That's it, your job's done. The hot crispy delights served with a chatni is fine enough. 
Long live, these small smack joints. Without you Kolkata is unimaginable

Living out of Kolkata for quite some time now, I visited this place almost after 10 years. And as the taste of the singara (samosa) hits your taste buds you are amazed at how a thatched place like this can churn out such delicious samosas and kachuris. I had matir bharer (kuller) tea after many many years and it was nostalgic. :-)

This has been Kolkata's one of the prime road-side eateries. I discovered this place many years back when we were returning home after an all-night pandal hopping and were very hungry.¬†I don't know whether it's because of the hunger or not, that day i tasted the best hinger kochuri and alur torkaari. The day was made memorable by the freshly deep fried jalebis and malpowa. The singaras are tasty too.I eat breakfast at Maharani whenever we are passing Deshapriya Park early in the morning.¬†If you can ignore the dalda, you can be happy.The bhaarer cha ¬†is great with a special taste i have not found anywhere else!This place remains crowded all the day!

This is THE tea-stall of all tea-stalls, mi amigos. This is, in fact, the alpha and omega of tea-stalls. They serve only a limited number of items, but each and every of them is finger-licking, and- wait for it- ¬†costs only 6 bucks apiece. The kochuri has just the right amount of hing, the jilipis only second best to what you get in office para, and the gulabjamuns taste like heaven while they are piping - hot. But the show-stealer is their beautifully spiced and milked tea, which comes in small and large sizes.
The best time to visit, in my opinion, is 4:30 pm (never been there for breakfast), when they are just done frying their awesome goods.¬†
p.s: took one point off for the congestion, but I guess that is to be expected.

Feeling hungry, want to have a quick bite ?? Do not worry about the time ,because Maharani hai na ...

Be it 6 am in the morning and you are returning from morning walk or 4pm in the late afternoon and you are hungry after missing your lunch or be it 830pm in the eve when you are just casually hungry (yes,casually hungry,doesn't that happen a lot with foodies like us) you will find it open.

Located opposite to the petrol pump, its just 1min walk from the Deshapriya Park crossing.

The tea is refreshing and the hing kachori with its sabzi is just awesome. Always served hot you will find more time puffing the hot air out of it rather then eating :P ... the samosas,malpua and jilipi is just equally good. Priced economically , if you are hungry and been around in Deshapriya Park and not been here you have missed out an experience because this place has just maintained there standards for more than a timeperiod that i can recollect ..

Do visit Maharani ...

I have been coming to this joint from my childhood with my parents. I just love the hing kachouri, jalebi, gulaab jamun and samosa. But what attracts me the most till now is their special masala tea. The smell of cardamom of the special tea leaves my mouth water-filled. The aloo sabji with kachouri has its own awesomeness. Instead of good quality and taste, the price is very low and affordable to anybody. I just love to come back here again and again. Special tea and hing kachouri are highly recommended.

This is a place which have played the most crucial role in shaping me - Round :D

But who cares, when it is about such Kochuri, Malpua, Singara, Jilipi.¬†

I don't remember a single time I've passed this place without eating anything and given the location, as many times i walk out of the house, i will have to cross this place. So. There.¬†

You eat something since the time you yourself don't remember and still don't get bored, that says ¬†a lot about the offerings of the place.¬†

See, if you are in Calcutta, please visit this place atleast once for a sinful breakfast, or, if you can't make it in the morning, do come in the evening. Don't leave Calcutta without having a bite here. :)

One fine day when I was hungry I suddenly see dis kachori n samosa shop.. rushed in and saw kachori being deep fried. Hot and crispy just to suit the winter mornings of kolkata. It did not have oil dripping from every nook and corner . Saw people ordering one after the other and relishing each time they topk a bite of it. am not at all health conscious but i always prefer less of oily food as it does not suit my appetite. So bravely  ordered it ann it was the best ever kachori which I had in my life. The best alur torkari to team up with hing kachori was there in front of me. Called in for two more. It was huge though. I was too filled . Yet I wanted tea. The "bhaar a cha" I loved truly.. the gulab jamuns tasted awesome, hot and succulent and too tasty.

Maharani located on Sarat Bose Road near Deshapriya park is one of the more popular and renowned "singara-kochuri-jilipir dokan".From early morning breakfast hours to the hours of an evening snack and for that matter throughout the day this place is crowded which is testament to the popularity and quality of the place.
All the items served are pipping hot and fresh.Both the samosas and kachoris are very good.I prefer the kachoris more.The sabzi that comes with the kachori is tasty and you do get generous servings of it.Among the sweets the jalebi is very popular and good too.I really like tha malpua.The gulab jamuns are pretty decent too.The tea is also very good and popular.
The price was very reasonable in the past but has increased over the years.But still this is a more or less pocket friendly place for a satisfying snack.

Located near deshpriya park, this place serves some amazing kachori sabzi. I just love these alongside their chilli pickles followed by some jalebi and full milk tea. Samosas here are nice but I prefer the kachoris any time of the day.

Located near deahpriya park, the shop is always crowded with customers and could be noticed from a distance due to the same. Such is the rush that every lot is sold out immediately thus ensuring you always get hot and fresh stuff. Overall great value for money.

My cognizant about this place dates back to my childhood when my dad used to bring me here for those amazingly delicious savouries. And, since then I have been almost a regular to this place.
May it be the hot samosas, the crispy jalebis with sprinkled saffron, the yummy kachoris along with Sabji or a bhaand of Tea...
... All taste so good.
This place is amongst my favorite breakfast spots when my food craving for jalebis and kachoris calls.

A pocket friendly place along with quick service may it be in your car or right outside the shop, makes this place an even better joint. :)
-You can easily overlook the hygiene levels (near to average) when it comes to such piping hot delicious food.

Maharani is on Sarat Bose Road. They have no board as far as I recall, but it is very easy to spot, as the largest number of cars and people throng around it at all times of the day! It is a favorite stopover for people who want to catch a piping hot cup of milky tea, fluffy, crunchy delicious kachouris to go with it., and not to forget the awesome aloo sabji in generous helpings (yes, you get to ask for repeats). And those who have a sweet tooth like me, do give in to the sinfully sweet hot gulab jamuns and drippy malpuas. The samosas are good too. The pocket pinch is really low, about 50Rs for a happy meal - highly recommended for instant upliftment of mood.

On reaching this shop you will find yourself jostling with cab drivers, morning walkers, office goers, policemen, lovers and what not! This place is a legend in its own right - serves the best milk tea in South Calcutta. If you are slightly hungry, try their piping hot kachuris with the potato curry with some green chillies and chutney sprinkled in. In one word its delicious! The samosas are not that tasty. No meal here would be complete without the crisp jalebis - they are mind blowing! 

The malpuas and gulab jamunas are a bit too sweet - if you want your sugar levels to go up instantly due try one! No frills shop. Locate the shop - jostle your way in and enjoy a super duper breakfast/lunch/snack/dinner - whatever you might like to call it. It's open from 5 in the morning till about 9 in the evening. Have been patronizing them since childhood and will do so all my life.

This is not one of those ubiquitous breakfast joints serving kachori and aloo and other ancillary fried food stuff. This is one of the LEGENDARY breakfast joints serving kachori and aloo and other ancillary food stuff. Stand there and eat your kachoris piping hot if you can and if you are a person who is fond of hot and spicy food then you will love the pickled green chillies served alongside the aloo. I can never have enough of that. Two kachoris are what they usually serve but two can never be sufficient. One may also sample their samosa which is of course not as good as the kachoris. But they are samosas and not the Bangali shingara. 
Coming to the sweet meats I love their jalebis. The gulab jamuns are however quite inconsistent as certain batches turn out to be brilliant whereas some batches are not so good and lumpy inside. The malpuas are not good, period.
I am not a milk tea person so I never have the tea there but those who accompany me they have the tea and are of the opinion that it just cannot be missed. Sit in your car or stand there and eat such that the food remains hot but surprisingly the kachoris after a take away and after getting cold do not become as leathery as one would expect. 
4/5 for simply the kachoris, service and ambiance. I love this place and will keep loving it.

But they are samosas and not the Bangali shingara. 
Coming to the sweet meats I love their jalebis. The gulab jamuns are however quite inconsistent as certain batches turn out to be brilliant whereas some batches are not so good and lumpy inside. The malpuas are not good, period.
I am not a milk tea person so I never have the tea there but those who accompany me they have the tea and are of the opinion that it just cannot be missed. Sit in your car or stand there and eat such that the food remains hot but surprisingly the kachoris after a take away and after getting cold do not become as leathery as one would expect. 
4/5 for simply the kachoris, service and ambiance. I love this place and will keep loving it.

They serve excellent kachori suzi .. jalebis.. and samosa.  Outlet is near deshapriya park.. the place is always crowded and you have to wait for some time before u can grab a bite on these items.. My only concern was that the items were fried In Dalda.. which leaves a sticky feeling to your mouth.. Other than that.. Thumbs up to the taste...

I used to visit this place regularly a few years back while returning from swimming classes in the morning at nearby Rabindra Sarobar. In the early mornings, even the health conscious crowd; morning walkers, fitness freaks and casual joggers converge here after their workout to feast on their Kochuri's and Jilipi's. Because you can't walk past Maharani without looking at least once at her offerings. And once you do, you're hooked. 

Been here for years, Maharani is a popular name around these areas and beyond. A typical small roadside eatery which has become popular due to it's food. The location also helps I guess. It's also one of the few chances you'll get of having a nice quick affordable meal in these parts. They make the staple Kochuri which I like because of it's light puffy nature. There's also a filling of dried daal as in a Radhaballavi. The chana daal comes complimentary although they've started selling Alur Dom. There's also the dark, juicy Jilipis. As far as the price for a kochuri goes, they've kept it a minimum. It's a wonder as to how they've managed to keep the store still operational in an area that has a slew of top of the line restaurants and soaring realty prices.

The only downside is that they're unable to cope with the huge demand each day and run out of stocks soon enough. They keep the oven running but it's still a long wait as new dough is kneaded. Also, no chairs.

Chakraborty Tip : If you're on a budget and in this part of town, drop in for a quick tummy filling. That is if there's any Kochuri's left for you. ;)

A favourite of all the people who traverse along this side of town. Many fond memories are created while munching on the kachoris and hot jalebis. Also their gulag jamuns and the hot malpuas are quite savoury.

Was surfing through the Zomato Homepage for Calcutta , where I saw one of the frequent reviews for Maharani and it truly took me back to the most wonderful memories I‚Äôve had at Maharani. With friends and family..!! Hence couldn‚Äôt control myself for writing a review for this small little eating joint where I‚Äôve been infinite number of times , and can go there time and again with the same enthusiasm and vigour..!!

Located at the very busy Sarat Bose Road ‚Äì just before the Deshopriya Crossing, Maharani is always crowded and busy..!! The exotic smell of the Kachoris and Sabji will take you to you to a different world. With no seating options- this stall just banks upon its good and cheap food , and yet is the most preferred destination for food lovers because of its authenticity and true dedication to bring good food for the masses.

They are on wheels since 6 am in the morning..!! Their long list of Loyal Regularities include a variety of people- be it the morning joggers who swear by their food and put on those extra calories to motivate them enough for the next morning or the little Children who are on their way to school or the aam Manush whos hurrying for Office or the youth whos made this place their favorite adda to discuss on any random topic that they can and last but not the least we have families coming in , may be where the Mom isn‚Äôt cooking breakfast that day and they all decide to go to Maharani with Joy and Glee..!!

Such is the rustic ambience of Maharani ‚Äì where reasons may be many but intention remains the same- good food , good food and good food..!!

¬†Economics talks of the term penetration Pricing where you can capture a large portion of the market by quoting damn low prices ! Maharani is practicing it- and I aint Kidding..!! Some years back ‚Äì all their stuffs were sold for 3Rs each- anything that‚Äôs sold there. With increasing prices and demands- they have now raised this to Rs 5.

Anything at Rs 5? Are you kidding me?¬†No, Im not..:)

¬†All items in their menu are extremely popular. My verdict on all of them:
¬†>Kachori--Star of the Lot. Size is generous and when Kachoris are stuffed with Urad Dal mixture , you can just go SLURPP..!! Very crisp and perfectly fried, that one prick with your finger into the Kachoris will get the steam released and rest is Magic..!

>Sabji--This is free of Cost. And you can take unlimited servings of Sabji along with the Kachuri. ¬†Perfectly flavored with Hing and Kasuri Methi ‚Äì this Aloo Sabji is by far the best I‚Äôve had in Calcutta. You have to be very perfect while using Hing in any curry- a pinch more and your Dish is a disaster. But then ‚Äì these guys know their stuff very well and till date they have never got wrong with this- Kudos..!

>Jalebi(Jilipi)¬†-- Crisp and Hot, Jalebi is something a sweet tooth will love. At Maharani , they are perfectly sized but I always find them a bit sour - may be mixture they use is fermented longer.¬†

>Samosa-- Crisp and Perfect. The masala is flavoured with garam masala and is spicy and Hot. The cover is fat but crisp. You must try this..!!

>Malpua-- They over fry the Pancake at times but then othervise its decently edible.¬†

>Gulab Jamun-- Im a big fan of Gulab Jamun and I love them anytime and under any circumstance , so I am biased towards this sweet. At Maharani- I can have multiple of them unless thrs someone to stop me. Yes- they are yumm..!!

>Chaii-- I saved the best for the last. We Indians love our tea and we can swear by this beverage. Maharani serves tea in two sizes probably because theyve judged the Indian mentality perfectly well. They know that the greedy stomach of a Chai Lover can never be satisfied with the small cup. Flavoured with Elaichi and Ginger- thier Chai is a perfect accompaniment to the Kachoris and Shinghara.¬†

Having said all this, I applaude and also have said them in person that thier jet fast service is something thats commendable. Whether you're standing at the footpath or ordering from your Car- the Chotus and Bhaiyas rush to you within seconds and in no time the food is served to you, fresh and hot. Salutes and Respect to them for this.

If youre at Maharani please do not forget to keep the Kachoris as ur prime order. Along with this do ask to give them the complimentary Green Chilli achhar and Imli ¬†Chutney..! Though the Chutney is meant for the Samosa but then tastes equally good with the Kachoris. I always find thier Chai less sweet which is ideally good but then you can always ask them for the extra sugar.¬†Its actually robbing them for 5 bucks but then the free things are always welcome:)

A thing that amazes me every time-  their way of calculating the bill is actually so fast. They calculate the number of items served to you and simply multiply by 5 :-D So efficient and no room for mistakes - they just hit the nerve of Customer Satisfaction :)

Morning, Noon and evening- Maharani at your service.
Price for two- Around 50/60 bucks.
Experience- Priceless:)
You havent been here?- There's no reason to keep you waiting..! Rush for your next breakfast or evening snack..!!

Am one of thier loyal Regularites and my loyalties do not change..!!¬†I appreciate and applaude thier efficiency, fast service , lip smacking food and above all steal away prices ;)

This is definitely the most preferred destination for morning tea accompanied by piping hot kachori sabzi after a walk around the lake. Right from 6AM, one can find this shop crowded especially during breakfast time. This is a no frills sweet meat shop which runs through out the day with a break in the afternoon time. The Kachori is a must try item priced at Rs5 a piece. The Gulab Jamun or the Malpoa is a great way to end a snack. Samosas are also tasty. Tea is available in two sizes. Perfect way to start the day with a cup of tea from Maharani. 
Situated opposite Car Fill petrol pump at a corner on Sarat Bose Road, the shop itself is a landmark, so you dont have to look around much. One can stand and eat outside the shop on the footpath or have it inside your car. Do not expect a seating option, as it is a tiny shop serving from the counter. Take away is available. The place is great for evening snacks as well. Cost for two is quite below Rs100. Please do try it out if you are nearby :)

Morning, Noon, Evening...This place is for everytime, whether for its famous tea or sabzi kachori/singhara or jalebi......
Maharani attarcts all sorts of customers starting from the morning walkers lined up in their tees and shorts and wanting to make up for their lost calories, the taxi walas having the kachoris before starting for an adventurous rides. Or the office staff coming out in afternoon for avoiding their siesta (afternoon sleep). The evening time witnesses the  mix crowd meeting over an 'Adda' sessions to discuss how their day unfolded.
The place is simple and down to earth over the years but the quality has been intact and thats what matters! Chai, Singhara, Kachori, Jalebi with pocket friendly prices and ample parking area to sit in your vehicle and savour the taste makes this place special.
By now, you all must have realized that I have witnessed this place during all time of the day in my countless visits there!
Price for two - Do I need to mention this too :)

This is the place which I used to visit with my grandfather for Kochuris and Jilipi. Maharani's kochuri's, served with chilly chutney is a winner, and so is the jilipi and gulab jamun. If you have a sweet tooth, then you're just going to LOVE the jilipi. One thing which I love about this tiny, road-side eatery, is that it always serves piping hot food. The food quality, unlike many places, has not degraded over the past few years. 
The best time to visit the place is early morning. May be one has to wait in a small queue, but it's totally worth it! Sunday breakfasts are always made special, if Maharani's on the plate!

Maharani to me is the byword for Kochuri. As it is quite close to a friend's house, we would stop by in the morning to enjoy hot kochuri and wait our turn for the hot kochuri to hit our plates. What attracts me the most about this place is the spicy chilly pickle served with it - a die hard chilli lover, that is incredible in my books. If you go there in the morning, be prepared to wait, or break the line and attack. In any case, the fight is worth the kochuri. And the last good part is the Jilipi, which is a must-try afterwards, because it effectively makes sure your carb cravings are officially put out.

Maharani's kachuri, served with ‡¶≤‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶®‡¶ø ( chilli chutney ), followed by " jilipi " is a must for all kachuri loving south Calcuttans.
There is always a huge crowd that gathers in front of Maharani. For the love of kachuri, people from multi-various backgrounds are jostling to place their order, and this sight is indeed very interesting to behold. Peak hours are morning and evening, and you need to wrestle quite a bit to get your bite. If you love kachuri and haven't visited this place yet, I must say you are quite an ignorant fellow.

It is good enough for a morning breakfast or afternoon snacks and evening tea. 
It is a small take away joint and it serves samosa and not singhara if you know the difference.
The quality of food served is pretty good and it has nearly no seating so you need to stand and eat on the food.
Isn't that what Kolkata is famous for..street food and fast food. We still often get our breakfast parceled from there and the jalebis are very good, the gulab jamun is not worthy of a try according to me as the inside is thick but try out their malpua and oh so good jalebis...
In the winter evenings have some tea in large earthen cups and your evening will start on a good note.
Oh and it is located near deshapriya park a few footsteps away from zeeshaan.

One of my favorite places to go hang out and chill with friends from way back. Breakfast or tea this is the place to be ! Their Chai of course is famous and delicious. The kachori and subzi that they serve with a bit of pickle is my favorite .... absolutely delicious. The samosas are probably my current favorite in Kolkata. End with the super awesome crispy jalebi's and you are going to leave with a very big smile on your face.Superbly pocket friendly , super yummy and absolutely fresh ! Can't ask for more ... truly epic stuff !!!!

The small shop named Maharani (queen) may not look like one, but it definitely does justice to its name in terms of taste! If you have a sweet tooth you take pride in but have never been here, then it‚Äôs a must visit whenever you're nearby.
Located bang opposite the renowned Monalisa Guest House, one can never miss it.

One fine evening I was walking by Sarat Bose Road when the warm smell of gulab jamuns drew me towards the shop. It only took a few seconds for gluttony to completely take control and I ended up ordering gulab jamuns, jilepi and malpua. Oh how the piping hot syrupy gulab jamuns melted in my mouth, increasing my sinful desire for more! The jilepi, so amazingly crisp and crunchy was a treat as well. The moderately sweet thick malpua however just heightened my satisfaction level and finally, the sweet-craving monster inside me calmed down.
It'll make one even happier to know that you get all these heavenly savouries for just 5 rupees each!
They also make hing kachori and samosa that goes perfectly well with an earthen cup of hot milk tea.
Do drop in during the early evening when they make the gulab jamuns (a must try!).

P.S: Even Vidya Balan had favourited this place during Kahaani's shooting! :)
