Mughal resto.The quality of foods are below average except of their rolls coz it is of a huge size and that might be the only reason why people order it.The restaurant does not have a tidy atmosphere and services are not good at all. It is recommended not to visit the resto unless you are financially low.

They make some decent mughlai paratha. A huge piece that  can be easily shared by 4 people for a 50 buck just. And that's about it. 
You do have place to sit and eat outside.
However every other thing is bad. The roll, pakora nothing worth having.

You don't want to visit this place unless there is a shortage of finance. I caught up in the similar problem one night and had to eat from here. Firstly, it's a dirty place, all kinds of rodents and pests could be found hanging around. Secondly, the looks of the place and where it is located would make you stay away from this eatery. Thirdly, their food which was too oily. I have heard a negative feedback from my friend who lives nearby and tells that they use too much dalda in their food.

Anyways, I ordered a Chowmein + Chilli Chicken combo which costs ₹60 only. To my surprise, it was prepared in less than 5 minutes and the eatery was dealing with multiple orders at that time. I suspect that it was pre-prepared and was just warmed up and served to me. It tasted horribly bad enough to annoy me and I didn't even finish the food. Chowmein was full of oil and I didn't want to risk my health further.

Overall, avoid this place pretty much for anything except rolls. Rolls might be okay as I saw many people order rolls but I highly doubt they would be any better in terms of oiliness.

I try avoiding street food usually for personal reasons. I've never tried food from Ria Fast Food joint and I don't think I'm going to ever because while passing this joint I had spotted a baby lizard fall on the biriyani which was obviously kept open. You may tell me any such thing can happen in case of any food joint, but I'd rather avoid this one.

***Update 10/10/2015***
Had limited money i.e. Rs 100 only and had to manage my lunch. It was 3.30 pm already. I was looking for outlets with reasonable combos. Turned on Zomato and searched locally and found that Ria has a Rice+chilli chicken combo @Rs70, Never noticed this previously, this I visited and ordered a combo. 
Food: Rice was okay but Chilli Chicken was good. The combo had half plate Veg rice and 2 pcs of Chilli Chicken. Cannot get better in this area actually. The prices are increasing even in cheaper hotels, we poor student foodies  are gonna die soon because pocket money isn't increasing at all you know..
Service: Satisfactory. Food was served within 20 minutes.
DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

Visited this outlet last week. The Pakoras are really bad.This outlet is located in bosepukur, 2mins from opposite of Shitala Mandir. We were the last customers. Ordered 1 Egg Chicken roll. 1 Chicken... It was tall and normal in thickness. It has outdoor seating so summers would be hectic. Not so good in ambience as you can see all sorts of people, from a passersby to local foodies and slums too. The roll had a shock of lime on the top filling of the Chicken. As soon as you go down, it was tasteless.. The meat was burnt plus had no taste at all.

Would not try rolls here. Came here as a last opinion because Feast was out of stock and alibaba served in purchased parathas...or parathas which were made before and stored in the fridge.

For people who want cheap food to fill their stomach and not stir their taste buds. Food in case of emergency. Its not a restaurant. Please dont try.

Ria fast food centre was really good for fast food  but  recently it's degrading. I had chicken roll today and it was not that good as expected. Hope it will recover soon..

It is a cheap takeaway joint that offers quality food at a reasonable price i mainly go for the rolls and kebabs yet to try the other food items.

I am shocked to find no one have reviewed this place till now. 
This is one of the best and cheapest street side fast food restaurants in Kasba area. Rates are cheap, quantity is good, and taste is quite okay.  Noodles (Veg, Egg, Chicken, Mutton, Prawn and Mixed), Rice (All) and Biriyani are the must best in this place among all dishes. Rolls are also good. Size is bigger than many other shops and tastes good too. 
So if you are hungry and you are unwilling to spend much, go and grab a bite here.
