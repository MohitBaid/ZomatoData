As near to my dwelling place, went there for light snacks. They have a very short menu but a compact one. Tried ala kiev, grilled sandwich and cheese sticks. Liked all of tbe. A cozy and comfy place to be. Quality was commendable!! A nice cafe indeed in 8B area

Been there just 2 days back..this is certainly a place where I would go again and again. Very nice food and equally nice ambience. The staffs are very welcoming. I had a mushroom dish and a lasagne. Both were fantastic. The best part is that this cafe is really pocket friendly so you can visit frequently. I also had a brownie with vanilla ice cream, which was nice too. I highly recommend this cafe.

There are places in Kolkata where you get good food at affordable rates where as there are places which offers a great ambiance, positive vibes and nice place for a proper 'adda', well cafe plot 15 offers both.
Located in the by Lanes of jadavpur 8b bus stand, Google location was of a great help.

Went there with family for a cup of coffee and tid-bits. We placed order for Cappuccino, chicken grilled sandwich, stuffed mushrooms.

Chicken grilled sandwich was very basic and tasted really good, had plenty of chicken and was crisp.

The stuffed mushroom was stuffed with cheese and chicken, the mushrooms needed a bit of more moisture and could have been a bit more cheesier. The presentation was nice, the spicy salsa along with the dish was very tasty.

They have their own bakery aswell, with plenty of options of pastries, cupcakes, mousse, also they make personalised birthday cakes and have a really interesting collection. For the readers they have collection of books and also a semi boutique as they have displayed ear pieces, which is put on a sale.

The friendly service made me add that point 5 extra, it's good to see that the cafe concept is seeping in, in extreme south.

This is located near Jadavpur 8B. An amazing place to hangout with your friends. This cafe doesn't even make a hole in your pocket. Very much Pocket friendly.
The ambiance is awesome. The decor is too good. 
The staffs are very cooperative n helpful.
And lastly the FOOD...Well we 4 of us went I mean my friends n me. We ordered 6 food items including the dessert, surprisingly the bill was pretty less! 
The only thing I would suggest that the dessert MUFFIN should have been a bit soft one. Needs to improve more on this.

But definitely I ll visit the place again.

This small cafe at Jadavpur is a nice place for hanging out . The prices are reasonable. I tried the jacket potato. It was innovative but not extraordinary. Potatoes with stuffed chicken sounded interesting but the stuffing could be a lot better. The Chicken Alexander was a better choice. Baked chicken with creamy sauces served with veggies and  garlic bread toast tasted decent. If you're looking for a quick budget cafe this place can be on your list.

Cafe plot 15 a pocket friendly tidy cafe located inside the bylanes of jadavpur 8b. Some will say this is a hidden gem due to the varieties being offered at pocket friendly prices. So on the eve of christmas my friend & i decided to pay a visit to this place.

To reach this place you have to take the lane beside hindustan sweets,just keep walking straight until you see cafe plot 15 on your right(approx 6-7mins of walk). The cafe will be on the 1st floor will good amount of seating arrangement. The place was surprisingly empty for xmas eve. Their menu was short & crisp so selection for food was not a major headache & we went ahead with the following:-

1. Rum cold coffee - The name instantly attracted me & upon enquiry we were told that it indeed is a rum mixture of cold coffee. Then came the major jars with normal looking cold coffees but upon having the first sip just sent shockwaves to our tastebuds due to sheer strong presence & essence of old monk. According to me the rum overpowered the coffee. But this was good to try.

2. Caesar salad non veg - A plateful of healthy salad surely cant go any wrong if you are looking for something light yet palatable. The caesar was taken by my friend & it certainly looked droolworthy. Had ample lettuce,olives,croutons,chicken, boiled egg & generous amount of parmesan cheese.

3. Jacked potato - 5 pcs of chicken stuffing with mozzarella cheese coated around with potato skin was a delight to our tastebuds. The sweet sauce however did not compliment the jacked potatos. The stuffing was seasoned perfectly.

4. Peri peri pizza - Having heard about their pizzas,we ordered the peri peri version. In came the pizza which was just about bigger than a regular 6" pizza divided into small 8 slices. The pizza topping had overload of cheese underneath which had the peri peri chicken bits. The topping was tasty but the pizza bread was a bit chewy & hard which i did not like.

The prices are certainly on the lower side with our pocket pinch being about Rs 350 per head. The service was also good & very prompt.

P.S. Pics have been posted separately!!

This was my second visit to the store & cafe was full. We ordered their much talked Jacket Potato and Cappuccino. Service was really really so slow.¬† They served the Jacket Potato, after we finished our Cappuccino. Food was good.

During my last visit, we were the only customer at the cafe. And the other table already cleared their bills. They served us the drinks after 15 minutes of placing order. Where as we waited for the Peri Peri Chicken Pizza¬† for long 30 min. Even after waiting for so long, the Pizza was served cold. Cheese was so hard

Guys!!!! please speed us your service.¬† Appoint more people to improve their service.
Please serve the food HOT

Another pocket friendly cafe near my place to hang out with friends. Ambience and Hospitality deserve 5 out of 5. And when it comes to food, I will give 4.5.
We have ordered Oreo shake, cold coffee, Hot chocolate, Kashmiri khawa tea, Lemon tulsi blast tea. Only Hot chocolate was a mess but cold coffee and oreo shake compensated it well. 
Then we ordered crispy chilli baby corn, maxican cheese cigar (it was toooo filling üòò), peri peri chicken pizza, fish and chips, jacket potato. All were good in taste üòò and I'll absolutely recommend all for a visit.

This cafe is located in the Jadavpur area(Ibrahimpur Road). Its a group friendly cafe. We had ordered Cappuccino , Twisted Chicken wings, chicken Al-a-kiev , one chocolate pastry and a  vanilla muffin. Coffee was really good . Loved the wings. Chicken Al-a-kiev was okayish. Desserts not upto the mark.

5mins walk from 8b bus stand and this cafe comes up. On the 1st floor, the interiors are beautiful. Right from where you enter, the door, those books placed right there. The tables, those wall decorations and the upstage, everything seems on point. Light music, and friendly waiters. For the presentation and interiors, this place is perfect, for a date or maybe a group adda session. One thing to note, the menu card on Zomato, isn't the one they'll serve you there. That has a lot more stuff to choose from. Now coming back to food, we had a chicken peri peri pizza, and a Oreo cream shot. Now the pizza was fine, but it was between a small and medium sized one. That too small, not even medium, good for two people, but it'll make you wonder if you had more slices. Talking about slices, the usual six slices were made 8. The Peri Peri was good, the crust was good, enough cheese - 4/5. But the Oreo cream or Oreo Cheese shot was kinda too small for what you're paying. Two centimetre length chocolate cake layers and two layers of cream cheese which kinda tastes similar to the cream you find in Oreos. Covered with chocolate crunches. It tastes good, really good, but you're left wanting more of it, as it's just really less quantity. Overall a really nice place to go: you'll love the ambience, but it's a tad bit on the expensive side if you're planning for a heavy meal.

I hated cafe because of lousy ccd. But Dude the more I get into indie cafe the more I am falling for them. And this place is in my new "can try many times" wish list. Barely a new joint, a bit inside of jadavpur but this is hidden gem. Amazing food. Perfectly cooked fresh tasty. Lip smacking. Someone truly said here best in town sandwiches.. I am amazed. And not at all a boy pinch for pocket. You can't have full course lunch. But yes its a pure adda zone.

Note: they provide good quality "help your self" infused tea. I did a grave mistake by taking 'aam admi masala tea', thinking a thik piping hot cup of creamy proper "CHAI" which can be found anywhere in india. But they don't prepare it. They give you english style cup of hot water with tea inside infuser and milk powder sugar powder seperately. That was a disappointment. But i tasted it (though didn't finished) they have great flavours. I think they must serve some good pure tea. As they have Darjeeling first flush to offer. 
I cut the .5 for just for the tea. That too I didn't want to as I am so amazed with the foods that make me overcome with the sorrow of lacking the tasty masala chai i wanted. Sorry. :)

A new place in town and it‚Äôs really good for hangout. Awesome decor. They also have some creative things for sell like earring, T-shirt etc. I love it and also have purchased a earring from there.
Now coming to the main part: (about food)
Foods are really tasty. On our 1st visit we have ordered chiken alexander, chicken grill sandwich and chicken club sandwich ( not in picture). All the items are delicious. Like the creamy texture of chicken alexander and after a long time have tasted some awesome sandwich. We also have tried the aam admi chai and they have tried to make it innovative. So you have to prepare it by your own and according to you need. Honestly I don't like the chai at all.. staffs are also courteous and service is prompt. Over all it is indeed a good experience.

Both the times I had been in last 10 days, ordered different pizzas, good tasty ones. Rum hot chocolate gives a wonderful feeling when there's chill outside. French fries are crisp and sufficient. Will try more in near future.

Located right opposite Gladiator gym. It still took us quite some time to find it and we were using Google maps. 
A good way to locate this is, stand on the 8B Bus stand and walk towards the direction where the S9 and AC9 buses are parked. Keep walking straight. Walk past the subway and right after a few small shops, there is a very narrow lane.
Enter that lane and once you come out of it, turn left and keep walking forward till you see the Gladiator gym.
At this point, you can basically ask anyone where the Gladiator gym is and they'll show you. 

Anyway, this is a good caf√© located on the first floor of the building. It's spacious and the ambience is well lit and good enough for taking your Instagram shots.
The food tastes equally good and the working staff were polite enough to suggest what to have and they even explained how the items were made.

We wanted to have the twisted chicken wings, but since we were in a hurry, we were recommended to have the jacket potato as starter instead, as the waiter explained how the twisted chicken wings would take time.

Not many places do this, and would instead keep you waiting, so extra points to the working staff for being thoughtful.

If you're here, I'd recommend you to try the jacket potato and chicken lasagna.
Both were extremely well made.
Prices here are reasonable, and ‚Çπ400 to ‚Çπ600 is enough for 2 people on a casual visit.

I'd have to visit this place a few more times, to give a more comprehensive review. For now, this should do.

Located right opposite the gladiator gym at jadavpur,this is a pretty spacious and decently decorated cafe. The staff are extremely well behaved and very cooperating. We celebrated a friend's birthday here and they were very patient with all the hullabaloo that we made!

Coming to food we ordered :

Lemon iced tea : this was a tad bit disappointing as the flavor was bland and it wasn't very refreshing.

Rum hot chocolate : the balance of rum and chocolate was messed up. The chocolaty taste was faint as it was overpowered by the taste of rum.

Oreo shake : It was average and not very thick. 

Masala french fries: the quantity was amazing and the taste was great too.

Chicken grilled sandwich : the presentation deserves a thumbs up. It tasted good and was filling enough.

Chicken a la Kiev : a huge portion of crispy fried chicken tossed in a white sauce with veggies and rice as sides. This was delicious and very filling.

Chicken Alexander : this had shredded chicken tossed in a cheese sauce. Tasted good.

Chicken lasagne : this was one of the best lasagnes that we had.

Their quantity is a huge plus point. However,they need to work on their beverages more.

So this quaint little place is basically a residential space turned into a cafe. 
AMBIENCE : The place has a very laidback vibe. Neatly done up in white and black with a mezzanine floor. It doesn't exactly bowl you over but doesn't disappoint either. 

FOOD: 1)Jacket Potatoes : Potatoes filled with chicken and topped with molten cheese. This was a winner. The dish was filling and the sweet chilli sauce that came with it complemented the potatoes perfectly. 
2)Peri Peri Pizza: They serve thin crust pizzas. The pizza was loaded with chicken and tasted pretty good. Although I did find it a bit under seasoned but sprinkling oregano over the pizza solves the issue.
3)Rum Hot Chocolate : Basically hot chocolate mixed with rum. This was done well. And we quite liked it. The taste of the rum wasn't overpowering and there was a perfect balance. 
4)Tiramisu: Now this was the first time I tried this famous coffee flavoured Italian dessert. So I don't have much idea as to how it actually tastes. But what was served tasted decent enough. 

SERVICE: There was a single waiter and he did his job efficiently enough. No complaints there. 

PRICING: Now this is the USP of this place. Our total bill was 490. They don't charge GST separately. Considering the quality and quantity this place is dirt cheap. 

Going back soon for more!

Cafe: Plot 15 is a cutesy cafe located near 8B bus stand. Take the first left from Hindustan Sweets and walk for 3-5 minutes and you shall have the cafe on your left. The cafe is located on the first floor and offers enough room for 25-30 people. The ambience is understated and you really dnt need much more to spend a comfy evening. The seating is divided into two sections; a cozy seating with low bean bags and a more traditional table-chair setup.
The menu is decent; they offer a good variety for a cafe. The menu is more continental and Chinese based. We ordered a rum hot chocolate and a chicken lasagne. The lasagne was cheesy and tasted good. But it was a bit liquidy for my taste. I would have appreciated a more thick lasagne. The rum hot chocolate was potent enough. It was a bit better and can give you a hang, if you tend to get drunk with little quantities of alcohol. 
I shall visit the place again to try out other stuff; but for a first time, the cafe did leave an impression.

Comparatively newly opened cafe in Jadavpur. 
Location : very easy to locate, just beside 8B bus stand. You can follow the address in GPS. 

Food : We have ordered Darjeeling first flush, fresh & chips, twisted chicken wings & hot brownie with ice cream. Food is really good here. Happy to try other items in near future. 

Service & ambience:  Quite  huge area with comfortable seats. Ideal for large crowd as well. But the service is really, really slow as only one person was doing everything. We have to wait endlessly for everything!! 

Pocket pinch:  Extremely pocket friendly. All prices in the menu was tax included. Our total bill was Rs 495 which makes this cafe more popular. 

Recommended for young generation ! But seriously they should appoint more people to improve their service.

Me and a foodie friend wanted to try out Lasagna for quite some time, and after doing a bit of research on Zomato we discovered that among all the cafes around campus, this place serves the cheapest Lasagna! So we hopped in to this place one evening after classes to try the Lasagna. But going and having just one item wouldn't satisfy our hearts, if not stomachs, so decided to order Masala French fries along with the Chicken Lasagna. As I took the first spoonful of Lasagna, it was milky in taste which I did not like. But once the top milky and cheesy layer was mixed with the chicken and pasta lying underneath, it tasted very good. It went very well with the garlic bread served alongside. The French fries were also spicy and crunchy and tasted yum. Quantity of it was huge and both of us had difficulty finishing it ourselves. It can be shared among three-four people easily. Initially the quantity of the Lasagna did not appear huge, but once we started having it, we realised it was quite filling and one bowl was enough for both of us with medium appetite. Service was pretty quick and decent, and the ambience was also great during the evening. You seldom get a cafe or restaurant where everything else is so good and prices are also cheap at the same time!

A perfect cafe that this place demanded. Good food and reasonable rates. I don't know exactly if others will feel it too but this place has got a homey feel. They have their own bakery. Thanks to that we get extremely soft cakes and so fresh pastries. Food tastes really good.
Their twisted chicken wings is a welcome change from what we've been trying so far! An indian take on the western wings. The Chicken Alexander and the steak were satisfying. The mock tails are refreshing.
Extremely high on hygiene and good food. The prices are unbelievable. They have not compromised on quantity either.
Highly recommended.

Well, I usually don't write reviews. All I do is give some rating and add some photos. This is my first ever review I am going to write. To be honest, the kind of tickety-boo experience I had there made me bound to add a review for this place. 

I went to this den on 22nd November, 2017. Coming to the experience, from interiors, ambiance to the food everything was top-notch. 

Easy to locate, well behaved staffs, super cheap, well decorated ambiance. 

Coming to the food, we ordered 
‚óè Rose flavoured Tea 
‚óè Chocolate Shake 
‚óè Cucumber Lemonade 
‚óè Crispy Fried Babycorn 

All the items are meant to satisfy your taste buds. 
Those who are willing to visit this place, I would suggest them to give a visit as soon as possible to have some flawless experience.

Tucked inside a hustling bylane beside the 8B bus stand, this is a cozy book-cafe with an ordinary decor, but its their food and hospitality that stands out. 
The food is extraordinarily delicious and their variety and ensemble menu is sure to win your heart! The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and are inclusive of GST, so you won't have to deal with the ordeal of calculating and verifying GST, when your final bills comes. Quantity is just perfect. Overall, Cafe Plot 15 is a little difficult to locate, but if you manage to, you shall realize that Its a hidden gem!

Okay. So this is the new cafe in Jadavpur. The very first in its kind and its a people pleaser.
 1. Located just opposite to the gladiator gym.. This place is easy to find.
2. Very beautiful interior decorations and nice music makes for a great ambience.
3. They provide really cheap thin crust pizzas here which you will absolutely love if you are a pizza fan.
4. They want you to eat with your hands and so they dint give us any cutlery. I love the woman. üòçüòçüòç
Earns brownie points.
5. Peri peri Chicken Pizza with extra cheese was a sheer delicacy. Loved it. And the quantity is enormous.
6. We also took Twisted Chicken wings and that was different in taste.
7. This place is very cheap. No tax to be applied till January.
8. Really polite stuff.
Will definitely come back here again to try other dishes.

Very comfortable cafe tucked in a first floor apartment of Ibrahimpur Road, very near to 8b bus stand, this place is a welcome revellation. The place would not leave you spell bound and over whelmed but for a quick chat or a group meet, it perfectly suits the bill. We ordered Chicken Steak and Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce along with a couple of hot cuppas of Latte and all of them were great. The portions were quite wholesome and left us completely full. The fish especially has a salty tinge to it which adds to its taste. What's more, their prices hardly pinch the pocket. So the place is certain to gain currency among college students and youngsters.Would strongly recommend the place to all.

I'll break my experience up into 3 parts so that It's easier to follow.

1) Food
2) Ambience
3) Service

1)Food: We tried almost everything from their menu and every single one of the dishes was great.Starting from the quality of the ingredients to the presentation,everything is really really good.The prices are also very reasonable,given the quality of the food.

We tried the Penne Alfredo,Lasagna,Peri peri Chicken Pizza,Fish in lemon butter sauce,twisted chicken wings,Jacket Potatoes,Corn and Cheese balls and Chicken Schnitzel.Every single one of the dishes was good.One thing I'd like to mention is,you may not like the pizzas here if you're a Thin-crust lover.The pizzas here are pretty dense.

2)Ambience-Again,really great.The black,white and grey theme is really well executed and the section with bean bags and bookshelves is really well done.
The only thing i didn't like was the weird window stickers.Frosted glass windows would've made the place look even better.

3)Everyone was very friendly and polite.They always took the care to ask us if we liked the food.

Overall,really good.We really needed a place like this in the Jadavpur area.

This place is located 5 mins from Hindustan Sweets, Jadavpur. You have walk through the narrow lane beside Hindustan Sweets and then turn left and walk for 2 mins. The ambience is splendid and the staff is very good. I have to say I had one of the best Oreo shakes from this place. The lasanga was too good.The prices are also pocket friendly. Definitely would recommend this place.

Finally a decent cafe near Jadavpur. Take the lane beside Hindusthan Sweets and walk for 5 minutes.
Nice ambience, though you'd feel deprived(like us) if you're the third group to enter the cafe as there are two couch seating arrangements, with the remaining being regular chairs. :(
Food and mojitos were good. The Earl grey was not the best compared to what I've had before in other places.
Hope it only gets better from here, thumbs up.
NB- NO GST as of now.

Amazing food. They've nailed the presenation.

Also, the decor is very aesthetically pleasing.
Special mention to Chicken Alexander and Chicken Schnitzel, stuffed potatoes and the list goes on. 

They have something very special,  a rum hot chocolate, which has left me crushing on this place !
I already have a soft spot for the owner, she's perfectly jovial and very motherly! 

The prices would urge to just go ahead and order another dish.  For my part,  the Spaghetti recipe isn't something they should share with anyone!  Absolutely loved it!  Godspeed guys!  

Can't wait to go back.

This newly opened cafe is a foodie's paradise. It is located at Jadavpur 8b. If you take the first left lane after crossing Bawarchi, it will be on the right side of the road after walking for 3-5minutes. The decor is very simple yet neat and clean. It will give you a typical cafe ambience. The staffs are extremely polite. And the best part about this place is its food. The food is outstanding. We ordered Chicken Ala Kiev. It is a a roasted chicken dish topped with cheese with butter rice and veggies. When you cut the chicken you will see butter ozzing out of the chicken. It is a delight to both your eyes and taste buds. We also ordered Chicken Lasagne. Another cheesy delight. Very filling too. We ordered two main course with a darjeeling tea. And the bill came to 530rupees. They are not adding GST because it is a new cafe. But GST will start from January onwards.

Nice decor, comfortable accommodation, good Ambience and delicious food , all in one place!

The stuffed mushroom is a must try here..Lasagna is quite good as well. We didn't like the wings much though. The Oreo shake doesn't look attractive but tastes great! The place is pocket friendly as well ! Definitely below Rs. 600 for two.  French fries for Rs. 60 :p

This place is very near to Jadavpur 8B bus stand.This is a Cosy and nice place with very well behaved staffs. Every nook of this cafe is very pretty. I visited this place for two times. My first experience was not so satisfying because that day the cafe was a bit crowded and noisy. But my 2nd experience was really amazing and I fell in love with this place. Coming to the food  it was just excellent. First day we ordered Watermelon mojito, Orange Tangy and French Fries. Both the mocktails were great. French Fries was hot and tasty. I just loved the watermelon mojito. The next day we ordered Cucumber lime soda (can't remember the exact name) , Virgin mojito and Fish Batter Fry. Mocktails were really good and refreshing. I just love the taste. And the fish fry was amazing. It was crispy outside and very soft inside.They served it with a pudina chatni and French fries. Quantity was enough for two. I am 100% satisfied with their food and service. Even the prices are too cheap and affordable. There is no extra charges beside the food charges. Overall experience was very nice. I would love to visit this place again.

The oreo cheese shot was light salty and perfectly sweetened and the dark chocolate pastry was dense and also perfectly sweetened. The location is also easy. Lovely experience I must say.

Location : A 5 minutes' walk from Jadavpur 8B bus stand,along the lane just next to Bawarchi restaurant.It falls on the right hand side.
Ambience : The interior is a winner - right from the black n white comfy couch to the pretty windowpane and the bright lighting - it all adds to the CAF√à feel.
Service : Service is pretty prompt and the staffs are really informative and very well behaved.
Food : We ordered -
1.Twisted Chicken Wings - 5 pieces of chicken wings with a thick layer of non oily,fresh and flavourful,well balanced tangy-moderately spiced-tad bit sweet marinade smeared on,and grilled to perfection,are served along with a generous amount of onion rings and a bowl of thick minty dahi chutney.A must try !
2.Chicken Grilled Sandwich - Four medium pieces of grilled sandwich overloaded with chicken filling and a slice of cheese on top of each piece (which melts in mouth giving tonguegasm after each bite) are served with a lot of crispy fries and tomato ketchup.One of the best sandwiches served in town which doesn't even pinch the pocket hard.
3.Dark Chocolate Pastry - A chocolaty slice with a little icing and bright sprinkles on top : it tastes just as good as it looks !

Now coming to the PROs :
üëçEasy to locate
üëçFast service
üëçAmazing interior
üëç10/10 food
üëçSuper cheap and no added GST

A nice comfy place located on the first floor of a building. Regulars of Jadavpur will be able to find this place if they just follow the lane of lokenath. Visited the cafe twice, loved the Banana caramel shake on both occasions. Unique and delicious, a thick shake served in a jar. We also ordered the chicken sandwich which was quite good and a fish fry. The fish fry was a little heavy on the Pudina marinade and hence we didn't like it much. We also tried the spicy Mushroom Cajun which tastes more like stroganoff but apart from that is quite good. There is ample seating space in the cafe if people go with a group of friends. I would say that it is pocket friendly since there are no added taxes.
P.S. This is an update of another visit when we tried the BBQ chicken pizza which is delicious. As are the chicken cheese balls. The blue lagoon has a nice tang to it which is unique and refreshing.

This place is located in Ibrahimpur Road opposite CIT market, Jadavpur. Coming from 8B take the first left turn, the same lane where Kolkata kebab, the fried factory and Ajooba biryani are in. From there it's a 3 minutes walk. It's in the first floor of a building right beside Just Fried.

We ordered hot chocolate brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate coffee. The brownie was more than awesome priced at just ‚Çπ100. It's the cheapest brownie I ever had. The texture was perfect. It wasn't too sweet like they have in many places. It was just perfectly dense and perfectly creamy with the perfect amount of chocolate sauce. We totally drooled over it. Hot chocolate coffee priced at ‚Çπ90 was okay. The amount served was huge. 
Rest of the items were cheap as well compared to other caf√©s. They had other items like pastries (‚Çπ40), tiramisu (‚Çπ50), oreo cheese shot (‚Çπ50) , muffins etc displayed. GST is not applicable till now. Service was okay. They took around 15 minutes or so to serve. The owner was friendly and cheerful.

The ambience is apt for having fun with friends. The atmosphere is cosy. Youngsters will absolutely love it. We had a lot of fun. There are many storybooks. Also there are one liner tees and mugs etc available for sale. The sitting arrangement is nice too. It's divided into two sections. One is normal where you have the chairs and the other is in a raised platform where the seats are cushiony. We sat in the latter. With the bill they provided us with coloured papers for giving reviews which we stuck on the board. Will surely visit this place again. It's of course recommended. Jadavpur needs more such caf√©s. 
EDIT- Tried their chicken lasagna and masala french fries. The lasagna was very creamy and cheesy. It was topped with cheese. Inside, between the layers there was adequate chicken. The only shortcoming was that it was oily I didn't understand why. That made the dish very heavy. Quantity was more than enough for two people. Masala french fries were quite nice and tasty. It was served with a sauce which tasted good as well. The quantity was humongous.  It would even be more than enough for 3 people. This time I visited in the evening. Interior was more decorated (with lights,etc). Tax isn't applicable yet.

Visited this cafe today for lunch and it's a bit tricky to find the place at first. If you are coming from Jadavpur station you have to use the Google map to find it. It's located at the first floor of an apartment Srishti just beside the Just fried joint. I am attaching a picture of the entrance of the cafe so it would be easier to find it. 
Coming to the ambiance it's cozy and nice. The light background music played and the humble welcoming gesture of their staff is very impressive. Sitting arrangements are nice. We got comfortably seated in bin bags. Our today's order includes,
1. Chicken Twisted Wings
2. Chicken Grilled Sandwich
3. Virgin Mojito
4. Green Apple Fizz
The food took 10 to 15 minutes to be served before us. Firstly, the Grilled Chicken sandwich along with the two mocktails were served. Chicken sandwich contained four pieces of breads loaded with adequate amount of Chicken chunks along with French fries and a sauce dip. Taste wise it was pretty good. Coming to the mocktails, green apple fizz tasted refreshing with a light green apple flavour and perfect amount of mild sweetness. Virgin Mojito was okaish. The most impressive thing served before us was the Twisted Chicken wings that was not like regular Chicken wings. It was more like a kebab dish served with pudina chutney and onion salad. I liked this dish the most. The Chicken wings were soft enough and full of flavors. 
So our Overall experience here is really good and the price is also very much reasonable. The menu is inclusive of GST and all these cost 489 RS for two of us that's really pocket friendly. Definitely recommend if you are a cafe lover like me. Most impressive thing about this cafe is the lovely calm ambiance and staff behavior. Well done!

Ordered the Choco-Chip cookies, Mexican Cheese Cigar, Veg Exotica Pizza, Cucumber Lemonade and the Fried Ice-cream. 

The lemonade was refreshing and good. The cookies were really well made.  The Mexican Cheese Cigar is a must have item. It's delicious. Wanted to order more. The Pizza was good. The base could've been harder and crunchier and the vegetables in it could've been cut shorter since large chunks of them were too much at times. The Fried Ice Cream was fine, didn't get much of a taste of the cold ice-cream, it was very warm..it's something that can be improved.

Overall, it's a good place with a lovely ambience, friendly service and very reasonable prices. The sticky notes for review is a very sweet touch.

Would love to come back here again and try other stuff. And would recommend everyone to come here and enjoy!

A perfect start to the Diwali Celebration at this cosy cafe!
The ambience is amazing, the staff is very friendly and the service is very swift! We ordered for Jacket Potato which is a speciality here and Chicken Schnitzels as well! We topped it off with Cold Coffee and ended with a Tiramisu!!
The food was amazing and styled very well! Every nook and cranny of the place was decked up for Diwali!
Since two of us shared the bill so the price was worth it!
We didnt feel like getting up from the bean bags at all!
Will surely keep coming back for more!

This wonderful little cafe has surely made the Jadavpurians happy! While the area has new food joints springing up almost every month, it always lacked a cafe. A perfect adda place where you can just sit, chill, grab a yummy bite and gulp it down with ice teas. Cafe Plot 15 has achieved just that. An interesting and extensive menu, pocket friendly and a wonderful team of staff, this place is already a favourite.¬†
Spicy mushroom Cajun is a must try from the menu!

P.S - tip for folks who will come and stuff themselves on the yummy food - you can hop right across the street to Gladiator gym! :P

Visiting this small and newly opened cafe was the best way to satisfy our sweet tooth. Located just in the lane by the Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand, this cafe is pretty easy to find. As we enter this cafe on the 1st floor of an apartment, we get this feeling of being at home. The interiors were beautifully lit and spacious. There was this small section where bean bags were laid out where we could relax as if it is our home. There was an array of books for you to read while you delve into your food including the Feluda books and  few English Classics. The ambience was soothing and the staff was humble. We ordered a chocolate panna cotta , an Oreo shots and a plate of Masala French Fries.
Chocolate panna cotta - It was served from their home bakery which is an Italian dessert sweetened cream thickened with gelatin and molded. The cream was aromatized with rum, coffee and vanilla flavorings. Oreo shots-this was also served from their Home Bakery,a cookie crust, covered with layers of cream cheese, Cool Whip, pudding, and topped with the crushed cookies. Masala French fries-this snack recipe is always a great way to treat your taste buds to a beguiling meal. This place is pocket friendly and the food comes in sufficient amount.

What a lovely place in Jadavpur! This cafe should definitely be on your bookmarks! Just a week ago we saw a couple of photos of this cafe on Zomato and it was immediately added to our bookmarks.

Cafe Plot 15 is a place you'd definitely want to visit more than once. It has everything MitRav loves: warmth, positive vibes, good coffee, good food, TV, books and freshly baked products! We went there yesterday and it was a really hot day. But this place is so calming, we didn't want to leave at all! The interiors are quite good and well maintained. Loved the funny writings on the kitchen door and washroom door- "seasoned with love" and "wash your troubles with bubbles" :) They also have a cool collection of mugs.

The espresso was great! Besides coffee, we ordered Crispy chilli baby corn and spicy mushroom Cajun. While the crispy chilli baby corn was too spicy for us (it tastes good though, ask them to make it less spicy if you want to), the mushroom cajun was creamy, soft and very, very delicious. Portions are enough for two.

Special thanks to this guy Aditya for being extremely charming. From suggesting the mushroom cajun to asking about our preferences and trying to make us feel 100% comfortable, this guy with his infectious smile is definitely going to make us miss the place even more.
What we loved most is that the prices here are quite reasonable and they don't charge anything extra besides the food prices.

There is a board with cute thank you notes written by the happy customers, so don't forget to leave some sweet words for them before leaving.

We are looking forward to visiting with family and friends in winter. Can't wait to sit at their window on a sunny winter morning with a book and a cup of their fanstastic espresso + oven fresh cakes. :)

Pocket pinch for us- INR 380
Cheers!

Ambience is amazing to say the least.

Coming to the food, 

Chicken Lasagna is out of the world! Just the perfect blend of cheese,chicken and pasta. I'm not getting over that taste anytime soon.

Jacket Potatoes stuffed with chicken and cheese and served with a dip is a pretty tasty dish as well. 

Oreo and cheese shots.Heaven.
Coconut pastry was just fine.

The staff is very friendly and well behaved. They make you feel at home. 

I'll definitely go back to this cafe,again and again!

Oh the Lasagna. ‚ù§

A lane , just beside the bustling 8B bus stand, deprived off a hangout for youngsters now boasts of Cafe Plot 15. Tastefully decorated and laid out for recluses, this culinary destination promises to pamper you with 'wow' so good food. On a rainy day, I preferred to sit right beside the window at the far end corner of the restaurant and slowly devoured on Chicken fillets and Darjeeling Muscatel. Great stuff Team Cafe Plot 15. I strongly recommend this cafe to all foodies.

Located at Jadavpur (near 8B bus stand), this is an absolutely amazing caf√©. Take the first lane on your left after crossing Jadavpur Bawarchi Restaurant and walk for 2-3 minutes. You'll find the caf√© at your right and on the first floor of a building.

A cosy and nice place with friendly staffs, this caf√© will surprise you with the quality of the food they serve at such a reasonable price. We tried chocolate shake, Chicken Alexander, and a dark chocolate pastry.

We were extremely happy with the taste of the food we ordered. Will visit this place again for sure.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 600 for two (approx.)

Newly opened cafe near Jadavpur 8b bus stand. Staffs are very friendly and they serve really tasty dishes at very affordable prices. We had ordered Oreo shake and crispy chili baby corn. Both tasted awesome. Will be going there again for trying new items. Will highly recommend this cafe to everyone.

A new cafe near Jadavpur 8b, spacious , cheap and absolutely delightful. 
Location : Take the lane next to Bawarchi restaurant ( lane next to the flower shops) and walk for about 5 mintues, the cafe is on the first floor of a building opposite to Gladiator gym.
What to try : There is a home Baker who makes fresh bakes for the cafe thus try any of the savoury delights. They are fresh and worth trying.
Jacket Potatoes : I absolutely loved these.
I strongly recommend the chicken steak.

We had a latte, jacket potato, crispy chilli baby corn and chicken BBQ pizza. First of all, the ambiance of the place is as a cafe should be. Totally impressed with their idea of having a book shelf in it(being a book-lover). The decor is pleasant, soothing and enchanting. The staff was really humble and suggested us to try jacket potato which turns out really mouth-lingering dish, but it was damn oily(which I don't prefer at all). I would suggest, it would have been better if the potato skin was a little bit crispy,it will add an extra star to this lovely dish. The latte was as it should be, nothing exaggerating. The real star of the evening was crispy chilli baby corn. I have tried this dish in other renowned restaurants too but never felt this much satisfaction with the dish. They have totally nailed the dish, it was crispy and crunchy(as it should be) with great taste. I think I am going to order it every time I visit the place. However, their pizza was a total disaster. The pizza dough was chewy and hard and they have actually used a lot of turmeric powder in it which dominates the actual essence of the pizza. So, to sum up, there are certain loopholes in their dishes which should be rectified,and need improvement in certain aspects but as a beginner in this industry, I would say that's really a great start. It's really a nice place to hangout with friends. In addition, they donot charge GST.

CAFE : PLOT 15 is the newest addition to the Jadavpur locality. It is a cafe which caters to everybody alike. It speaks volumes about a place! Not even a month old, the cafe is run by two sisters. The prices are unimaginably reasonable for the quantity and quality they are serving. Tried the Cucumber Lemonade and is definitely a must have. The mock tails look tempting and live up to your expectations. The Chicken Steak tasted amazingly fresh and the Jacket Potato was equally tasty. They have an in house bakery, and hence the cakes are soft and fresh. A lovely place to be, with such good food and that also pocket friendly, would highly recommend it.

When you have a nice cosy cafe opening up just 2 blocks away from ur place, and that too just before the Puja, then u can't ask for more. Cafe: Plot 15 is at the first 4-point crossing u get to after taking a left turn to the lane just behind 8B bus stand. It's located on the 1st floor. Cool decor with damn cozy bean bags and sofas, and it has a considerable amount of floor space unlike the cafes that have been springing up in every corner of the road nowadays. I went there to order a pizza as was suggested by my brother already had that. The waiter told me that it'll take just a few mins so changed my mind to stay back and not take it home and eat. I went through their menu card thoroughly, usual continental stuff, 1 or 2 seemed a bit different. The pizza was Barbeque Chicken which tasted as if taken out of Ma's kitchen. It tasted every bit like ghar ka khana. I ordered for more. Chicken Cheese Balls is what I ordered and they too were served quite quickly at least earlier than I expected. The waiter was courteous and the owner of the cafe was present there as well. She humbly asked as if we liked and enjoyed the food or not. The prices were under budget, which again was a bonus. The Cheese Balls were fantastic. Crispy on the outside with soft succulent pieces of chicken dressed in Mayo inside did the job! Served in a leaf shaped plate along with a tangy chutney to top it off. The Tiramisu was so so though.
If you live in Jadavpur or anywhere near it, this definitely should be on your list this Puja.

This Cafe located near Jadavpur 8B will surely surprise you. The place is spacious and the decor is very soothing and most importantly they serve awesome food. They serve a range of Cafe items starting from french fries, stuffed mushrooms, chicken kievs, burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, fish and chips and some serious steak meals as well. To help you wash down all these goodies they have a range of mock tails , Darjeeling tea and freshly ground coffee. Their pricing is really reasonable as compared to branded Cafes. Apart from all the popular food joints , JADAVPUR can now boast about this proper cafe. I am looking forward to drop in soon again.

A completely "made to feel at home" cafe. Easy to locate. You can find parking spaces around the cafe. Located on the first floor, two very talented duo have started the place.

Extremely high on hygiene and good food. The prices are unbelievable. They have not compromised on quantity either. Their twisted chicken wings is a welcome change from what we've been trying so far! An Indianised take on the western wings. The Chicken Alexander and the steak were satisfying. The mock tails are refreshing. They have a bakery too. Hence, the cakes are all made in-house and is so soft and fresh! Highly recommended.
