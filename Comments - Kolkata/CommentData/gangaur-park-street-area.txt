This cute joint sits on Russel Street infront of the famous saree shop Ananda. They expertise in snacks and sweets. The sweet shop is adjacent to this eatery. I've been a constant visitor to this eatery since childhood whenever mom was on a saree shopping spree. Chhole bhature, sandwiches, dosas everything is served hot and fresh. The service might turn you off given over the years the staff has been replaced. But if you're in park street , looking to grab a quick snack nearby gangaur would do you justice.

When it comes to Veg, Gangaur is one those places that comes to my mind. Service is good and Food is excellent. Pocket Pinch is reasonable. The only thing that I don’t like is the Ambience. Overall, I’ve had great experiences. Recommended. :)

But they need to change their interiors now and should make it more spacious..They have a beans on toast(sandwich)for breakfast..but that was not up to the mark..other food are good.

Being bhai dooj the place was overly crowded so the service was very slow. Had to ask for water 10 times after reaching the table. Coming to the food it was below average. It did not meet the Gangaur expectation. Masala kulcha was burnt, raita was sour and the vegetable biryani was okay.

I had been twice in this restaurant. The ambiance is excellent. It's a purely vegetarian restaurant. The food  is very nice. I had a rawa dosa which was the best rawa dosa I have had till date. They have a very good thali as well.Satffs are pretty courteous however the food is a little overpriced in my view.

Have been to this outlet multiple times...great ambience, courteous staff..amazing north indian food!!

I just love the North-Indian thali served here...its amazing...gives u a royal feeling! Butter chaas is  served initially then comes the thali...which includes dal makhani , aloo dum , paneer , raita ,rice,sweet of the day and 1 bread of your choice! We prefer taking masala kulcha!
The best part is u can ask for additional serving of any of the items except sweet without any additional charges! So , quite pocket friendly too!

The food is awesome and perfectly North-Indian style!
But the sad part is that this amazing thali is served only during lunch hours!!

Highly recommended if one wants to try Veg-North Indian food!

Found out about this restaurant on Zomato and after reading good reviews, went on to try it out. The service is good and the management quite knowledgeable. I ordered North Indian Thali which included dal makhani, mix veg, paneer butter masala, salad, raita, butter nan, papad and rice. And not to forget, you get masala chanch in the beginning. Except paneer butter masala and raita which i didnt like as they were sweet, everything else was good. You can also ask for extra dal, breads or curry. So a lot of variety and quality at Rs 186. Its definitely a yes if you are looking for veg north indian food.

The place has detoriated alot comparatively....found the place being run by some illiterate managers who dont have basic courtesy and ettiqutes..the managers are shouting like anything which becomes annoying  for the people dining there ...air conditioner is shut down midway and then when asked they say it is not working ... And its like they keep on shouting to each other as they have no work... Forget to deliver orders and when asked say that it was not ordered .. the so called managers have no interest in working and are there just for salary... Being a hotelier i know how a restaurant is run and managed... Feel bad that the restaurant has no standards set ..  its not the first time that i went there .. seriously was very disappointed today and would definitely refer my freinds to not go there .

When it comes to veg, one restaurant that comes to my mind first is Gangaur. The thali over here is very good. Its INR 186 + taxes.
We also had ordered Mexican Sizzler which is rice base veg sizzler with assorted vegetable nd corn nd veg patty. That was tasty.
For thali, its one sweet, raita, salad, papad, pickle, plain rice, 3 sabji which is usually paneer butter masala, daal makhni and one sabji of the day and one roti which you can choose from Masala Kulcha, Plain phalka and Butter naan. This thali is an unlimited thali and you can always have xtra helping.

Simple and elegant. Vegetarian love this place. I have heard a lot about it from my vegan friends and relatives. Tried their north Indian thali. They served butter milk, which was really refreshing. Then the thali came, with masala butter kulcha(the bread is of your choice), kaali Daal, paneer makhani, parwal Alu ki Sabzi, chawal, raita, salad, and one sweet, and these are unlimited except sweet and butter milk. 20% tax they charge like any other restaurant.
Must visit if you are tired of non veg and wanna try something Indian.

I visited this restaurant yesterday for lunch with my siblings. It was buzzing with people, but we got a table easily. The service was quick and nice. We ordered Manchow soup which was perfect (neither too spicy nor bland). For the main course we ordered cheese naan, masala Kulcha, paneer Tikka masala, Dal makhani and veg panchratan. Kulcha was good. Cheese naan was a little burnt on the edges. Veg panchratan wasn't too tasty and the paneer was not soft.. But the Dal makhani was good.

starting from club kachori to beans on toast to south indian cuisine to sandwiches and ending with the sweetest Jalebi.

Gangaur is usually my wekeend breakfast place and one thing that i order is the famous club kachori. I club it with jalebi and hot coffee. The paranthas are also good. For those who relish south indian cuisine, this place will not disappoint them either.

One word , Sizzlers...try it to experience it..some may find it exaggerated review .but i have my good memories associated with it. Try the sizzler in company of your loved ones.from the hot plate to the empty pait(stomach) the sizzlers journey is worth every penny.the manager is a polite gentleman who served us personally .i wont rate it 5 for the crowd this place gets on weekends and service quality declines a bit .no issues as such with the restaurant .

Do try their jalebi too as it is succulent , their gratin puffs which make a good tea time snack and their samosas.

Gangaur is a pure veg restaurant located at Park Street.

Ambience is nice with sitting arrangements.

Service is bit slow. Staffs are nice.

Tried Club Kachori, jalebi & Kesariya Chai. Club Kachori was lip smacking. Jalebi had a sweetness balance and was crispy. Kesariya chai was just fantastic and thoroughly refreshing.

Pocket pinch seems bit high but quality is very nice.

A good place to have wholesome vegetarian food, which is tasty without being too rich.( ie.overload of spices and oil... it was neither). So that was a big plus.The North Indian thali was good in taste and also in quantity. It was a complete meal, with butter milk and sweet included. The thali with masala kulcha, steamed rice, black dal, paneer butter masala, potato curry, raita, salad, papad, sweet and buttermilk was very filling and satisfying. The Velma kachori with green peas filling together with aalu subzi was delicious. Also liked the fresh lime soda with the correct salt and sweet proportions.

Date of Visit – 05/11/2016

Location – In russel street near Indian Hobby Centre, opposite to Bombay Dyeing.

Ambiance – The interiors are simple and the space is properly utilised to accompany as many guests possible.

Service – I was well greeted and given a table of 6 though I went alone as no other table was empty. The staff were polite and well trained. The thali I ordered was served to me within 5 minutes of order.

Food & Description – It was a Saturday afternoon, after a meeting at park street was looking for food. For a single person its always difficult to decide a restaurant to eat. I decided to have buffet or thali rather than ala carte. Again zomato came to my rescue. 1st option was barbeque nation. But when I called they were over booked. So decided to go for Gangaur. Have been coming here for ages. Its very famous for its breakfasts. But its lunch and dinner are equally good.

I ordered North Indian Thali. It seems to be perfect option for me. It included paneer butter masala, mixed vegetables , dal makhani, steam rice, raita, sandesh, masala kucha, papad, salad & achaar. Not to forget butter milk as welcome drink.

All the vegetables and bread were served hot and were delicious. Special mention of the sandesh which was fresh and melted in mouth. It was perfect thali for one person. Not that heavy on tummy neither on pocket. Highly recommended.

While on my trip to Kolkata, I visited this place twice. It's definitely a better option to eat for a vegetarian. Sundays it gets crowded, just like any other place 😉. I tried both chaat(raj kachori, dahi puchka chaat) and North Indian food(roti, kadai paneer, tandoori roti) and both were delicious. Even the sweets on the menu are delicious. 
P. S Try the kesari lassi if you like sweet lassi, it's definitely worth trying.

One of the oldest names in Calcutta! A must visit if you are looking for the traditional Calcutta breakfast i.e. Kachori sabji. 
Very well known for its sweets, Gangaur offers the best kachori sabji in town. The South Indian is equally good, plus there is jalebi and lassi to add to the sweet morning tooth. 
Very decent ambience, centrally located, decent service and decent pricing.

Situated in Russell Street, Gangaur is pure vegetarian place serving Indian, Chinese and Continental. The speciality about this place is that it opens up at 7am and serves a wide range of their delicacies during those early hours. I've been to this place many a times for both Breakfast and Dinner. The quality of food is pretty good. I really like their items over Breakfast. Ambience is decent.

Location-Russel street.

We have visited this place quite a few times for breakfast as it is one of the few places for proper Indian breakfast in kolkata.They deal in pure vegetarian dishes and serves North Indian,South Indian and Chinese cuisines.

Service-The service at this place is quite good but a little pace is required while serving the dishes.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is loud like most of the north indian restaurant in kolkata and the interiors are quite simple.

Food-As said we have only tried breakfast at this place and it was good in taste but nothing extra ordinary.We had-
1:Steamed idli
2:Masala Dosa
3:Club kachori
4:Jalebi
5:Cheese chilli toast

Service-4/5

Named after a Rajasthani festival, Gangaur is a place that could make all fellow Marwadis in Kolkata feel like they're in Rajasthan.

For those occasions, the club kachori is my favourite.. but this time i went there for lunch with my mother..We had the north indian thali, masala dosa and badam milkshake.. Everything was really nice.. and moreover if u r not sharing the thali with anyone, u can have as many helpings as u want..

I had heard that it's among the good vegetarian restaurants here in Kolkata but seriously it's not worth going guys. In its early days this restaurant might have served satisfactorily but now it has gone pathetic.

I would have rated it even less!!
Low on ambience, Horrible food, Rude staff... Any other reason you want to skip this one from your list?

Kachori sabzi is nothing less than wow! Gangaur for me is breakfast. Kesar tea and samosa. At any given point of time there is a que for waiting and guess it's tradition of staying full is justified. It's like that old school principle or law that can't change and is ubiquitous. There taste is totally consistent and remains same forever. 

At the first floor is a bustling restaurant that comes to life during wee hours and is chocoblocked. The good point is that it serves food without Onion and garlic to  call oldies of the city.

This is a review for quite a few times that I have been to Gangaur although this is the only outlet of theirs I have been to....

In terms of ambience, please don't expect much, simple layout and expect crowds and at times waiting also....

The food quality is decent and for an avg order you can actually do an avg of ₹600-750 which is a reasonable one if you are aiming for a working lunch or quick dinner for two....

Packs a good punch for the buck spent....👍

I had been to Gangaur quite a no. of times in the past and have mostly had the dosas and uttapams but have never found them to be great.
This last weekend I landed up there for breakfast. The service was quick and efficient, so not much to complain there. The stuffed parathas which I hadn't ever tried were on my wish list but they weren't available so I had to fall back on club kachoris and idlis. The club kachoris were nice but I have had better elsewhere so they weren't anything to write home about. The idlis were miserly slim and I didn't like them. The kesaria tea was probably their best. 
The thalis that I have had there before (mostly shared with friends) are decent too. Otherwise its quite an ordinary outlet.
Value for money is also average in my humble opinion.

'Ganagur' is a a fairly popular name in Park Street Area. It is located in the lane opposite to The Park Hotel and opposite to the Bomhay Dyeing store. I did not go the restaurant but went to the adjacent sweetmeat shop of the same franchise. I went there today at around 12.30 pm.I was totally drenched due to the torrential downpour. On entering the shop, a member of the staff told me to keep my wet umbrella and bag near the basin as it would wet the floor.I was famished. One con that I noticed on entering is that they have not used name tags for the food items which is bad as it is quite embarrassing to ask for the name of a dish again and again. I ordered an 'Au Gratin Puff'  first. This item was delicious and that is an understatement. It was overloaded with cheese and the melted cheese tasted heavenly with the veggies inside. Next, I ordered a badam chandrapuli. It looked majestic from the outside. The inner sweetmeat core was covered with a coating of pistachio, almond and peanuts. It tasted good, not great. The behavior of the staff was cordial. If I go back, it will be solely for the 'Au Gratin Puff'.

Had a mid week breakfast. Sabzi kachori was absolutely perfect and I will give A- to the jalebis, should have been crispier and thinner. The gravy was perfectly under spiced and "thin", exactly the way I like it. 
The grilled sandwich too was up to the mark and the cold coffee pretty reasonable for the place. Worth a few visits.

One of the popular vegetarian outlets nearby Park Street, this place serves as a landmark in itself. Located at close proximity to Bengal Club and Park Hotel, this place happens to be a pure vegetarian outlet. Had dropped in one day to try their Kachoris and Samosas. While the Samosas were quite good, the Kachoris were not properly fried. The Sabjis lacked some taste as well. With numerous food options in and around Park Street, this place does not seem to be first choice when it comes to having food around this location.

Good place for breakfast specially the Sunday brunch. They serve mouthwatering sabzi kachori which is a instant hit among morning walkers. The South Indian dishes are equally good and so is the Pav Bhajji, chole bhatura. To avoid the rush go a little early. The service is okay and so is the ambience.

We went here for breakfast on a week day, the experience was good. We tried South Indian foods, Sabji Kachori and sweets from neighbouring sweets shop. The Food was good considering the value. Sambar Vada's served were fresh. Misti Doi (Sweet Curd) and Jalebi is a must try here.

There seems a lot of scope in improving current service provided here, Staffs serving here need be more attentive by avoiding gossips. I have been here during breakfast time, so not sure about the service during daytime and during evening.

Just visited Gangaur at Russell Street on Sunday 10th April, must say.. had an extremely BAD experience. The staff was utterly rude and completely ignorant. The order was given repeatedly due to their inattentiveness, besides which the food served was absolutely cold, khasta kachori which is meant to be crisp was soggy and stale and out of the microwave.
 For the delay in the other items (dosa, uttapam) they had pointless excuses like " the pipe broken" "the microwave isn't working", which was absolutely irrelevant to the order.
 When we asked to cancel our order after sitting for 45 mins, the manager didn't care about us hungry customers waiting, instead instantly cancelled our order and handed us the bill. They harbour highly shameless staff.
  I wouldn't ever recommend anyone to visit Gangaur after this disrespectful behavior by the staff.

Have been visiting Gangaur for breakfast and even lunch for the past 20 odd years, so, now is a good time to review it (lol). Conveniently located in Russell Street nearby ITC, one of the most popular place for breakfast in Kolkata, little introduction is required for this place. We started off with samosas served with sweet chutney - which was absolutely out of the world, they could give the likes of Tewari - a run for their money! Samosa fried till perfection with decent aloo and peas content! Thereafter, we had club kachoris with sabji. Some of the kachoris were properly fried while others weren't. Sabji, comprising aloo and peas was piping hot but taste was not upto the mark. However, club kachori went very nice with their kesharia tea, which was exceptional. Tea contained a pinch of elaichi and keshar and was almost perfect! Hope they could share their kesharia tea recipe with me! Jalebis were nice and crisp but a touch too sweet. We finished off with Paper Masala Dosa, which was a major disappointment. It seemed more like a regular dosa as the crunchiness was missing. Even, the masala content was pretty low. However, it was very presentable - almost a metre long! Sambhar was served very hot and white chutney was decent, but dosa lacked on taste.

Service is just ok and prices somewhat high, but a major drawback is their ambience. The place is too cramped up and furniture very stagnant. We had a difficult time sitting on that small table with so many items flowing in – it was quite difficult to accommodate all of them in this tiny area. The huge footfall adds to their woes with nearby people gossiping on top of their voice - and a full house at this place just resembles a fish market.

Hope their seating arrangements are improved and area expanded!

The last time I had visited Gangaur as a kid, the food was excellent but unfortunately the quality  has detoriated. The food was tasteless and definitely not worth the money. Additionally, the staff was least interested which was the icing on top of a very bad lunch. The jalfrezzi , paneer seemed like someone had half heartedly dumped mush together , the naan was inedible and trying to break it into two halves gave me more of a workout than the gym does. The starters too like paneer tikka was completely bland though the green chutney was undoubtedly nice . The cold coffee as well. 
The restaurant was cramped with barely any space to move , definitely would not be coming back !

I have been visiting this place since I was a kid. My parents still say that the quality is good , so that's consistency at its best. The food here really is good(quality and quantity). It's the ultimate vegetarian restaurant. Located at the heart of the city, it has maintained it's reputation quite well. The place is good. You'll have to wait outside most of the times(especially during peak hours and holidays, so reach on time!)

Hands down this is the best place to have a thali. The thali has two variants one is the Indian thali and the other is the North Indian thali. The only difference between the two is tht the later has kali dal or dal makhani and the former has peele dal, and u get to choose between naan or kulcha for the North Indian thali and in the Indian u get roti with ghee and missi roti .the day I went the Indian thali had bondiya kadhi. The other options were paneer butter masala(awesome), mix vegetable, raita,kadhi,rice,salad,papad and a sweet. You are even served a glass of chass or butter milk. A good experience

1 of the finest veg restaurant in kolkata...specially in park street area. saw this place on zomato all of a sudden, when i was searching for some other resto. felt nostalgic and this review is on the basis of my frequent visits to this place when i was a kiddo. the belwa kachori and sabzi was out of the world dish they serve. even the ala-carte menu dishes are fab...but i would personally...highly recommend evry1 to try the belwa kachori and sabzi sometime soon...(if they havent tried yet). the crowd is always good at this place because of its homely hospitality. all in all... a must visit for evry nonvegetarian too, coz u all will fall in love with the food they serve :)

Firstly i will inform that i am from mumbai and i have come to kolkatta for official visit. 
Sorry to give it 1 star and hurt those people who have rated it so high. 
When you buy an item from the market it is not only the quality and pricing of that item which lures to buy the same, but also the quality of the sales person also. When first time i went for dinner the food was surely good but the behaviour of the manager was poor. Ignoring it for the first time and thinking about the food I again stepped in the restaurant for the second time immediately the next day.  Was surprised to see that the manager from the far shouted at the doorman to not allow to anyone enter in the hotel as it about to get closed. Emphasis intended on the words 'shouted from far'.  Thereafter when I placing my order for the soup the employee confirmed the manager regarding the availability of the soup and again from the other side manager in a high tone said " ab soup voup kuch nahi ( he came to my table) and phulka missi kuch nahi milega kuch aur khana hai to khao" ( he went away). No common man would like such kind of behaviour and  i am one of them. I went to him to make him understand that he is not behaving as a manager but in reply i was asked to leave and was told " mere senior ka number leke bol do, mai haath pair nahi jodta kisi ke, Aise he bolta hoon"

Now it rests upon you people to decide whether to try going there or not. Those who are not aware, there are plenty of options in park Street for dinner with great food quality along with the service

Went to this outlet of gangaur today, the restaurant was pretty good, with a decent sitting capacity. Ordered raj kachori n cola float, and both the items were very good. 
Will surely, visit this place again.

A restaurant I have been visiting since my childhood. It's a place which has people pouring in so there might be a little waiting. The quality & taste of the food has been consistent. The ambiance is fine, the staff is polite & the service is fast, except for thali refills. Tip: If having a thali, order all the refill(any number of roti, etc) you'll need at once.

Very rightly included in the Great Breakfasts collection by Zomato, Gangaur's early morning Kachori sabzi is worth having on a drizzly winter morning. Located near Teej and India Hobby Centre on the Russell Street, it can be easily spotted. Havent tried the regular Indian quick bites like Rajkachori and chats but have heard they're pretty good, too.

Tip: Breakfast finishes early by 10-10.30. So swoop in before going to the office if its around.

I regularly visit this place for North Indian thali which is a very good option for lunch, only drawback I find with thali that they supply the extra portions after too much delay; you should order extra portions when receiving the thali. All cuisine served here are awesome, must try chola bhatora, paw bhaji, Dahi ke Kabab and kesheria tea. Its also serve delicious sweets.

Ganguar is not a new place for anyone who has been Russell Street frequently. Any kolkatian who loves north Indian food must have visited this place at least once. 
I have just recently visited Ganguar with my mother. Since it was just early evening, we did not have full dinner but had Chinese which frankly was not up to the par as the north Indian served by the restaurant. We ordered pani puri,chrispy baby corn,hakka noodles and Manchurian. The baby corn was good and  was aptly chrispy and tasted amazing.The pani puri was okay but obviously could not compete with famous Russell Street puchkas. The puris were not as crisp as we would have liked. The noodles were good and best of all, did not seem to be coated with oil as with other restaurants. But the Manchurian was a great disappointment. It just wasn't eatable at all. The ball were not properly fried and seemed to be raw still. The lime water I ordered was good to wash everything down.
I would not recommend Ganguar for a
any cuisine other than north Indian.

This place is famous for its breakfast, mostly. Though it is always crowdy and the service is very slow, you always find a reason to visit again. The club kachori is one of the best in Kolkata and the jalebis are sumptuous. In the south indian dishes, rava dosa and upma are great. Do not try for more, to avoid disappointment. Stick to the signature ones. Such a score, only due to love for its breakfast.

Been here today morning for breakfast. Being a Sunday morning, the place was full. Got seats after 15 minutes wait. The seating is not that comfortable. We had to share table with someone, and one had to get up if someone in same line or behind got up. 
We chose Paper Masala Dosa and club kachori. The waiter brought rawa masala dosa. 
Club kachori was good. Crisp kachori with rightly spiced potato curry.
Rawa masala dosa was kinda ok. The crispness of a dosa was missing and the sambhar and chutney too were not as per the south Indian taste I want.

Ordered vada. Even that missed the crisp factor.

In dessert, we settled for jalebis. Crisp with saffron on top. Jalebi were flavourful. Service was good apart from the confusion in Dosa.

Perfect ambience to sit and enjoy the food. Food is good with reasonable price but the service is slow. Jalebi's are fantabulous and must try there epic kesar tea as well as lassi with malai.

If you would just like to try some good vegetarian dishes and can ignore everything else like decor, service, etc.. Then Gangaur is the place! My first visit to this restaurant in Russell Street was almost 10 years ago. The quality of the food seems the same. This place is a favourite with moms who like pure vegetarian restaurants! This place is now famous for breakfast as well.

This is one of the oldest vegetarian restaurant that Kolkata has.  I remember going there even as a kid.  Certain things don't change with time and same is with gangaur.  The usp is the pure vegetarian menu with Jain options.  Now since there are so many new joints one would not have this place on to go list , but I feel it's still worth going once in a while.  Till date the breakfast served is as good as it can be . the club kachori , kesaria chai , jalebi is must have . rest of the menu is pretty standard and its a decent place for a family dinner .

Notwithstanding the sudden flash of Pasta and Au Gratin on a purely Indian vegetarian menu, I went in here with an anticipation to sample the much talked about club kachori and the balwa kachori with aloo dum. The place was choc a bloc on a Sunday lunch hour, for obvious reasons, I thought. I was wrong, it is ALWAYS full. 
Managed to get take-away and regretted it. For balwa kachori and aloo dum is not something enjoyed in a hotel room. The kachori is essentially a scale model flying saucer filled with Urad dal and varied spices, deep fried. Heavy on the stomach, these kachoris are paired with aloo dum- baby potatoes in tomatoey spicy sauce. Gastronomically delightful and a gastroenterologist's nightmare - this dish can be essentially classed as sinful. Sits too heavy on the tummy. 
Moving on, the club kachori is almost the same as the Balwa kachori, couldn't really spot any difference. 
The menu has encompassed the world of Indo-Chinese vegetarian fare as well, with the taste not so different from everywhere else, if only a tad more hot. Surprisingly, there are Dosas also jostling for space among the much-loved chaats and kachoris and rotis and sabjis. I think its best to leave Dosas to Anand in Chandni Chowk (CAL, Not DEL). 
Do try the masala soft drinks and the floats here, nothing special, just for kicks. 
As long as you have Pudin Hara or the likes handy, step in for a taste of modern India, where "Chinese" meets bhel.

Hello Foodies here's my review of 1st experience at Gangaur, Russell Street. Let me start with starter we ordered spring roll which was average. In main course we ordered Paneer Butter masala, Chana, Yellow Dal, Onion kulcha, plain Tandoori Roti, Dahi Vada, Jeera rice and vegetable Salad. Food taste were ok not Good nor Bad. Starting with Dahi vada it seemed as it is sugar dipped so for me I'll never taste it again. Dal, Chana, Paneer Butter Masala were fine but it was lil tasteless. Onion kulcha yaaa here it comes where was onion in it hahahahahaha seriously never had onion kulcha in which onion was missing. Now time for interiors too old and damaged but it's ok people still like it. The only reason I gave three is coz the hospitality of waiters and managers and the Restaurant Name.

The place is okay only. The food served has the taste of home's. The food does not have life in it. Like indian food is supposed to do its own talking. The flavours melt in your mouth and the blends are perfect. But that is not the case here.if you don't eat onion garlic and non veg,Bang on! You just found your place. If you do eat the latter, try another place.

One morning breakfast Kolkata is famous for is Club kachori with aloo ki sabzi. And Gangaur serves just the right taste. Only that you will have to rush for your morning breakfast as either it is crowded or runs out of order.
Also serves other good breakfast options like 'matar puri' and 'khasta kachori'. We had to wait for 10 mins when i visited and Loved the club kachori. Also, we tried the 'Baked beans on Toast' which practically was impossible to eat. Tea and coffee is usual.

"Salt is what makes things taste bad when it isn't in them" and Gangaur was misery when it came down to salt. 
Went with family friends for dinner and had ordered kulcha, butter nun, dal makhani, pindi chana,paneer butter masala and veg biryani. The portion served was less compared to it's price. Taste wise it wasn't really tickling my taste buds, asking for more rather on the contrary it was below expectations. Would I return? I would rather opt for better options. Sure zomato would be constant guide in this food journey of mine.

This one is for oldies who like onion free Marwari Breakfasts like Kachouri Subzi (Considered one the best in Calcutta), but you will have to wait for hours on Sunday Morning becoz of super limited seating capacity and lag service. Not for youngsters as it offers only daily breakfast items, nothing exciting!

This outlet is located in russel street, opposite "floriana". It is a pure vegetarian restaurant and I guess the only one of its kind in this area. The decor is quite simple and doesn't have anything cozy or worth mentioning. The ambience is also average. They serving includes north Indian(naans, channa natura, paneer matar,etc), south Indian(various types of dosas,utthapam etc;), Chinese cuisines (soups, chowmein,veg manchurian, chilli paneer,fried rice etc;).They also offer ideal snacks like sandwiches, club kachoris, paapri chaats etc. They have both thali system and individual offerings. I have tried out their north Indian and Chinese cuisines and both were quite okay, but nothing special or worth cherishing. Their dishes are of average quality and doesn't have any X factor. But if you are a vegetarian searching for a restaurant to dine out with your family in this area then is a perfect fit for your requirements.

My cousin recommended me this restaurant. I was in that area for work. The location was very convenient. No great ambience. We ordered a typical North Indian dinner. Some Rotis and vegetables. Found plastic piece in my food, not just in one but 2 dishes. I was shocked! When we told this to the manager, he said it was nothing but the spoon pieces in the food. An excuse good enough? A kid could have swallowed that! Horrible experience. Very irresponsible.

Gangaur is a very old name in Kolkata and famous for its vegetarian food. It's a pure veg restaurant situated in Russell Street. Breakfast is very famous in Gangaur especially Kachori Sabzi & Jalebi. South Indian items are also good but in the morning especially on Sunday morning it becomes a fish market. You can't enjoy your breakfast in peace as it's too much crowded and too many peoples at a small place. 

But apart from this food preparation is very nice and loved by many. Service is a bit poor. By choice and view is to go on a weekday at this place when there is less crowd then you will be able to enjoy more.

GANGAUR is known for Indian fast good most of my visit here is for early morning breakfast for which it is famous for and is among the few which serves Indian breakfast. The most popular dish is club kachori and sabji with jalebi. But you get lot of options in South Indian as well as sandwiches and burgers. The prices are reasonable and the service is average.

Been here with family on a Sunday afternoon. Was very surprised to see the place almost empty. All the items were very average to taste. I took a veg thali. Also ordered a sweet lassi in the end. The lassi was also very average taste wise. To sum it up, the food was very average to taste and so was the entire experience in the the restaurant. Will strongly advice avoiding this place and instead try Govindas in ballygunge circular road.

Gangaur is a really old place and located very prominently at Russell street. Our roots are from Kolkata and hence, my family raves about how awesome this place used to be. So after much ado and craving one day we finally go to this place before catching our flight back to chennai. Frankly, when you go to a place with high expectation, somewhere inside you are prepared for the worst. This was worse than that! The waiters were rude and careless. The food was tasteless. Also unhygienic (I had a tummy a he later that day). Its below average for the standard of food available I. Kolkata!

Amazing food. Specially Indian. Try out Au Gratin and Sizzler for starters. Paneer Butter Masala and Malai Kofta are delicious. Service is good. Make sure you get prior reservations on Sundays. Service is friendly and quick. The only disappointment is the space and decor. Ambience is not very great. But price is pocket friendly. Very few tables so it gets crowded generally. :)

Getting the much awaited break from tuitions, planned a breakfast with mom to this place..

The service was good though the food was average..we ordered a club kachori, idly and sambhar vada, jalebi and kesariya chai..

All food was pretty average, except the jalebi which was good.. once upon a time this place was my favourite joint to be with friends (whenever we preferred pure veg food)..the food tasted much better then..today many other places serve better food..

Overall you can visit the place once in a while..

Visited for brunch today. 
Their hit items like club-kachori & aloo sabzi and Jalebis are only available till 11.00 a.m.
So if one plans a late breakfast or a brunch, the trick is to enter at 10.30-10.40 so that you can place the order before hand. 
But one has to keep in mind that these items finish off faster than you can imagine! 
Good food all round. Not very expensive. 
Full capacity brunch meal for our group of 6 adults, cost us only Rs.1600/- 
The amount of food we'd had, I'm a bit embarrassed to mention it here! 
Minus is slow service, dated decor, and although air-conditioned, this place has a lot of flies which is a big irritant ! 
But I'll not recommend this place for its  Indian/punjabi cuisine dinner because of previously experienced dinner service. Pathetic food, taste wise. 
But go in blindly, for a good hearty typical Indian breakfast. Strict No-No for the carnivorous because this a pure-vegetarian restaurant

Gangaur is my favorite joint for breakfast as it manages to serve a lot of variety, right from South Indian, sandwiches, cutlets, any their Most famous Kachori Sabji and Jalebi. We also like to order their Gratin Puff from the adjoining Gangaur Sweets. Their kesariya tea and Cold coffee with ice cream is a must try. The only thing which stops me from giving this a perfect 5 is the poor attitude of the staff - most of them have been they since ages and continue to take us for granted. Despite this, I continue to frequently enjoy this joint. However,  I would not be able to comment on their lunch/snacks/dinner food/service as it has been ages since I have been there apart from Breakfast time.

Incredibly bad food and worse waiters. Asked the waiter for his recommendation and he pointed straightway to the most expensive items-a sure sign of a bad restaurant. 

The belwa bread was super bad in taste. What made my experience worse is the superciliousness of the waiters.

Location: Russell Street. 

This place has been known to me since childhood just for it's Sabji kachori. 
I still remember, on every Sunday, me and my father used to come here for a takeaway of Sabji kachoris. 

The quality has remained the same for years. 
Yesterday, visited this place for breakfast along with my family. 

Sabji kachoris, tea, jalebis, masala dosa, plain dosa were ordered. 

-The Sabji kachoris tasted just the same! 
Right kick of spices and parboiled potatoes together made up the Sabji.
With the perfect amount of filling and perfectly fried retaining crispness were the kachoris.

-The jalebis were served hot! Sweet tooth. :-) 
-Tea was mediocre. Could have been better. 
-The dosas were good to taste.  
The masala was flavorful.  

The staff was efficient, managed quite a big crowd easily. 

Prices are pocket friendly. 

No great ambiance as such, but was simple. 
Overall a good experience.

This has by far been my worse dining experience in Calcutta. From the pompous staff to the unmentionable food, it's about time someone took the stars away from Gangaur. 
We ordered belva kachori, chola samosa, raj kachori amongst other things. Raj kachori has been their signature dish but today it was laden with hot curd and dollops of sugar. When asked to serve with cold curd after 15-20 mins, they refuse to serve us any. The manager was asked to get us 1 soft drink. He sent fresh lime to the table. When he pointed it out to him, he threw a fuss. 
Super annoyed!!

After hearing so much about this restaurant, we went all the way from Rajarhat on weekend but we encountered one of the worst food we ever had. We ordered for Green Salad which was sliced probably 5-6 hours before and Masala Kulcha's stuffing was stale. And to add to the sorrow is that even after complaining about the food, they were least bothered and the head waiter started arguing......

Being a vegetarian and finding a good restaurant to fulfil your gustatory needs especially in a city known for its non-vegetarian eateries doesn’t come easy. But then when you have a place named Gangaur, worries will be compelled to take a back seat. If you enter this restaurant opposite Waldorf you might feel dejected by its congested space. But then they say don’t judge a book by its cover. 

We ordered Indian thali, veg club sandwich, Chola samosa and Black Forest Cake. The Indian thali comprised of rotis with dollops of ghee, two kinds of dal, aloo ki sabji, raita (which was beautifully refined creating for an easy-on-the mouth texture) amongst others. The buttermilk came as a part and parcel with the thali. Trust me after the blazing heat, it provided the perfect respite from the evil sunbeams. Chola Samosa made for an interesting dish whereas the club sandwich was a value for money dish. But the winner was well no points for guessing, the melt- in-the-mouth, and soft-as-a-butter black forest cake. The layers of the black forest cake with crunchy chocolate sitting proudly on the top made our day.

Virginia Woolf said "One cannot think well, love well and sleep well if one has not dined well...I think Gangaur perfectly justifies this and add to that their meticulous service..:):):)

My family n I used to visit this place a lot earlier but eventually with new places emerging we somehow forgot it. 

However, I've a friend who stays near russel street and whenever Im at her place for sleepover, I make sure to have kachori sabzi from ganghaur!
Kachori sabzi and jalebi to be specific .. that is what I usually have at morning here. I was here one evening, I also tried their spring roll. 

I am biased towards the combo that I mentioned earlier so you can get an idea of how much I like it. But off late the sabzi is not good enough and the spring roll too which I had earlier was bad. The ambience is not so great (it used to be good earlier but now I'll just pass it as avg) and the service- it is fine. So there goes a 3.5 from me solely on the kachori sabji they serve!

The service is poor... everytime we enquire about our food, the standard reply is 'aa raha hai... thoda time lagega. And i believe they have a favoritism going on in here.... People who walked in aftwr us have got their food.... Unfortunate experience. They need to pull up their socks big time... The only reason i am giving them 2.5 is because of the food. Fir service standards i wish i could give them negative marking. I dont think i am gonna visit them ever again in my life. Gangaur... raise ur service standards before u become Gan'Gone'! KJ

I am among those Bengalis who dont consider food, food until it has something to do with non-veg. Recently Ganguar has amazed me and reminded me how food veg food can be. I was also bored eating every where else in Park Street, thanks to Loreto College I had pretty much been to all restaurants around that area except fot this. And I have been there quite a few times by now but havent been able to put in a decent review so here goes.
This joint is on Russel Street, the street adjacent to Park Street and also connects Park Street to Middleton Row. This place always seems to be booming with crowd thanks to their swift service and great food. I thankfully didnt have to wait and got seated immediately. I ordered for a Chhole Bhatore and my friend ordered a Kadhai Paneer along with a plain naan. The chhole was so good I haven't tasted such chhole in a long time and I couldn't finish both the bhatores as they are too filling but tasted nice warm and crisp on top. The Kadhai Paneer too I fell in love with, it consisted of big chunks of paneer and a red thick grazy, tasted heavenly with the naan. This place had a lot of dessert option too but we were too full to get our hands on it. 
And coz its veggie all the way the price too is easy on your pocket, unlike a lot of restaurants in that area. All this came for Rs.400 (approximately). The service is very swift with well spoken staff members. The restaurant is not too big and the seating arrangement is good and not too decorated. Happy eating :)

This place is the result of our failure to get into the reservation, but how can you repel your stomach by saying, ‘I did not get the reservations.’ So we did hunt through for second recourse. And thus Gangaur happened to me.

This veggie diner has an elegant sticker on it, heavy wooden furniture and accessories and décor has fostered a comfortable picturesque. 

When the orders went out, me and my friend were juggling the cutleries to spare our stomachache. Hot food had served on our platters more than 20 minutes' longing. But when the chunk of Paneer Kebab dissolved on my taste buds, it made me dig in deeper. And after completing this delight plate I was up for more. Then my plate was refilled with Kadai Paneer and Masala Kulcha, there was no new surprise in Masala Kulcha, but I did rumble on Kadai Paneer, the gravy which swimming in my mouth was extraordinarily delicious.

I give them an extra point of service; the attendant who was taking the orders was very humble and took time to suggest us. But yes  if they take out orders from the kitchen a little faster, service will be done by them from my opinion. Family or groups are an ideal visitor for this restro.

‘Gangaur’ is an old favourite of Kolkata based vegetarians. It also gives them the option of enjoying an assortment of breakfast items while they are comfortably seated and served by well trained waiters. This provision is highly cherished, since it’s pretty rare in Kolkata, wherein vegetarian breakfast invariably means take away, eating inside the car or eating while standing on the road!

This place is relatively old and the décor is vanilla. Because of high footfall, they have a good number of staff and they work like a well oiled machine. Pricing is moderate.

Recently, we visited this eatery for it’s breakfast and ordered club kachori sabji, jalebi, lassi, kesariya tea, aloo parantha, grilled mexican sandwich, sambhar vada and upma. Service was relatively fast and wares were average.

It is very close to Park Street. It is a compact one and fully air conditioned. Hospitality is excellent. Meal is tasty and pulkas (Rotis) are served as many as you want. Food served is Rajasthani Thali vegitaraion. One of the best Vegetarian restaurants in Kolkata as Kolkata had very few exclusive vegetarian restaurants.

Had lunched once a long time - 7/8 years - ago  and went again today with high expectations of the same standard of food. Afraid that while still good, it is not the same finely cooked and flavoured food that I remembered.  Just about average +, I'd say.  Had the papri chat & the chole alu tikia.

I had a terrible  experience today when I went to gangaur,Russell street for a business meet. My guest had ordered a Dosa when suddenly out of nowhere my guest pointed out a big cockroach floating in his sambhar. We complained to the waiter and he was obviously sorry for the whole situation. Since I was entertaining a business guest I didn't  create a big fuss out of this but was Atleast expecting a manager and if possible the owner to come and apologise to my guest but astonishingly this was not to be the case. To my utter disgust at the time of leaving also I didn't find a single person to even care to apologise or feel the guilt considering the magnitude of this event.

YUMMRAJ was super impressed with the true blue Gulab Jamun at Gangaur, the way they used to b decades back, unlike the useless variety omnipresent these days. Almost all other sweets were at least good , very good & excellent.

Description :

At the entrance of Russell Street is a large building with many establishments by Gangaur. A Rajasthani Fine Dine restaurant called Teej, a vegetarian restaurant called Gangaur & a sweet shop. This review is of the sweet shop. 

Long back Gulab Jamuns used to have a character of its own. Very different it used to be, from a similar looking sweet in Kolkata  Pantua. While the pantua used to be unidirectionally sweet, the Gulab Jamun used to be sweet but not too much, due to less pores inside it. The outer surface wud b mildly grainy & the ras wud not stand there for long due to the texture. There used to b a hint of salt to give a balanced sweet-salt taste. The center used to have a mawa & pista filling with a strand of kesar. Aromatic Cardamoms used to b present in these sweets. An aromatic  cardamom powder used to b there in the middle.

Alas……………….. not too many people make these any more. From the large chains like Haldirams & Bikanervala to the small roadside sweet shops – a good gulab jamun is almost nowhere to be found these days.

The Gulab Jamun at Kasturi was exactly like the one I remembered. Super good. Exactly the same definition as in 1st para. Loved it & rate it 4.5/5.

We also tried daal burfis. These were just too good again. These were like laddoos but in square shape with some differences. There seemed to be a mix of something like mawa & a hint of the super dense ras from the grains of the laddoo. Result – An intense taste as soon as the burfi landed in the mouth & a mild splash of a tasty dense liquid inside the mouth. Dry fruits atop the burfi surely added value. I rate this again at 4.5/5

We tried Milk cake here. That was pre-cut into quarter circle shapes with the central part being in darker color. This again had a robust taste – not too sweet but just enough. The texture was daanedaar & thoroughly enjoyable. Loved this again & rate it 4.5/5

We tasted Kheer Kachori too. This was a filling of kachori in a khasta maida cover & then dipped in ras. This was good but not as great as the others. The maida cover cud have been more khasta but was not been that much. The filling was good though but not anything outstanding. I have surely had better elsewhere. I give this 3/5.

Kaju Barfi was thicker than the usual ones. Sweetness was optimum. Flavors & taste of the burfi were very good as well. I give this 4/5.

Overall, the rating of sweets at gangaur averages out to 4.1/5. Loved eating here & returned in 3 days for a big refill. Will keep visiting. Look forward to hearing ur experience.

Again this one is another Park Street food spot where my previous office was located. Though myself is not a veggie, still my south indian pals used to insist me to go over there, and I was not used to get disappointed. Their kulcha and stuffed parathas are great! They use authentic black pulses for stuffing. They also serve naan with extra cheese which is yummy in taste! And so also, their dal makhani is exceptionally tasty. You'll feel a buttery smooth texture in their dal makhani as you gulp it down. Also their beverages and sweet dishes are quite good. Jalebis served are hot, good in size and have the required threaded fabric. Badam milk shake and cold coffee are also refreshing as drinks. Price-wise also it's much reasonable than Teej which is situated nearby. I'd give it 3 out of 5.

The first thing that comes to my mind when i think of Gangaur is their club kachori and kesaria jalebis. They are just amazing !!!!!

Located few building away from India's Hobby center on Russell Street, the place is a big breakfast destination for not just my family but so many. The place opens at 8 and you could see that its a full house by 8.30 to 9 and on weekends, it opens with a waiting line i feel. The restaurant is not so big and a bit compact but comfortable. The staff is polite and service is fast.

Though the thalis / north indian meal they serve for lunch or dinner are very wholesome and satisfying but i prefer the place for its breakfast. The club kachori is one of the best in the city as per my taste buds. Kesaria Jalebi is big, super crisp embracing an amazing aroma of saffron. But there are number of options for one to order and all are worth. South indian food is good especially the super soft idlies. Sandwiches, dhoklas, samosas are all good. Dahi Vada is nice. Fresh fruit juices are available which is a big plus from me.

The place stands for one of my favorite breakfast destinations in kolkata. Thalis for lunch is very worth the money and a great filler for 200 bucks, better than the thali at gupta brothers nearby. One could takeaway a thali which is very well packed and sealed for that purpose.But if you are looking for a great dining experience, you should avoid gangaur and maybe try a teej upstairs at some premium.

I can't believe I did not post a review on Gangaur before, but I must say that I am quite a fan of some of the items on their menu, and I generally leave the rest alone. Their timings are quite good - in Kolkata, its difficult to find a place which opens up early in the morning, and I thank God that Gangaur opens up early, and at a time when I am very hungry mostly it satisfies my Jilipi cravings as well as my need to have Dhokla. They make nice ones - soft and fluffy, and perfect. About their South Indian, I am in two minds - some days I love their Dosas, some days I don't (difference in consistency, oiliness, etc etc). I like the North Indian Thalis though, which is quite big for my stomach and can make me happy quite easily. However, I am not much of a fan of the rest of the menu after sampling, and stick to what I love the best here.

“GANGAUR – The Indian Food Hub of Kolkata”

3 out of 5

Gangaur restaurant, situated at a wonderfully central location in Kolkata at Russell Street is one of the most unconventional vegetarian Indian food hubs here. It is best known for its delicious Indian cuisine but also serves mouth watering snacks and south Indian cuisine. The renovated interiors  give you an essence of Rajasthan with luxury and comfort but the restaurant is a little cramped, as waiters move up and down to serve you your delicacies.

The service is pretty good but you have to wait for a long time if it is their peak time. Students and ladies generally drop in for breakfast and lunch, whereas it is very famous for families coming in for a wholesome vegetarian family dinner. Cleanliness and hygiene are kept in mind and well maintained by the restaurant, which is always nice.

Some famous, rich in taste dishes served by “Gangaur” include chole bhature, dahi puchka, dahi kebab, veg zafrani and corn methi malai; choices of breads range from cheese naan, masala kulcha, missi roti, pudina naan to some common options like butter naan and roti. The dessert options in the menu are that impressive unlike their main course and starters, though one item that truly stands out is their Raj Bhog (if you can get it).

To sum it up, the restaurant serves fresh food at affordable prices and has a comfortable ambience. The location is wonderful and always lively. Conveyance is not a problem at any time of the day, so the next time you are in that area and want to pamper your taste buds with some rich Indian vegetarian cuisine drop in at Gangaur.

Gangaur for veggies in kolkata is a perfect destination for delicious north indian cuisine. A personal favourite of me and my family i have beautiful memories with this palce over the several years.
The food is moderately expensive but great for its price. The malai kofta, paneer butter masala and dal makhani is awesome and taste best with their soft and yummy masala kulchas and naans. The veg pastry outlet just next to it helps make family parties very easy since the eggless cakes are mostly available(but this one shuts early around 6ish...) The mocktails are also decent. If going on a sunday or on holidays its best to grab a seat early since there is a long queue after 7.

# For every veggie who hasnt visited here yet when in kolkata you sure have missed some great culinary experience! ;)

Happy hogging! :D

I like Gangaur. It used to be a life-saver if I had to dine out on Thursdays, when I am vegetarian. Back in those days you rarely found vegetarian places to eat and in West Bengal the places that serve non-veg have pretty crappy vegetarian options.

I like their food. The soft dosas, the chole bhature, the pav bhaji. They have a large menu and except for some north indian curries, which are too rich for my taste, I love them all.

Ambiance is old worldish and comfortable. Location is wonderful. Near Park Street, but its easy to get a parking spot nearby.

Now for the bad part and I have a real funny story.

First, they have a strange timing for the foods. I understand breakfast and lunch/dinner food. But here you wont get continental after 7 P.M. You won't get tea after 6:30 P.M. Most of the food items are bound with a from and to time. So if you have something particular in mind you need to know the timetable.

Second, the service is really bad. The waiters make you feel they don't care if you live or die (they don't but then it's rude to show it so frankly ). 

Now for the fun story, I ordered for "dahi-kebab" (try them, they are good).  The waiter said - "Don't order that. It's not good." I was taken aback. I have had it before and liked it. I said - "Do you have it?" He said - "Yes, but it's really bad. Why don't you try something else? Like ... or ...". I was so surprised, but I persisted and asked for the "dahi-kebab". He made a face and took the order and while moving away said - "Ok, if you want it....I will bring, don't blame if it is bad". We actually laughed out loud after he went out of ear-shot. Anyway - the "dahi-kebab" was very good :D

Had lunched once a long time - 7/8 years - ago  and went again today with high expectations of the same standard of food. Afraid that while still good, it is not the same finely cooked and flavoured food that I remembered.  Just about average +, I'd say.  Had the papri chat & the chole alu tikia.

I had a terrible  experience today when I went to gangaur,Russell street for a business meet. My guest had ordered a Dosa when suddenly out of nowhere my guest pointed out a big cockroach floating in his sambhar. We complained to the waiter and he was obviously sorry for the whole situation. Since I was entertaining a business guest I didn't  create a big fuss out of this but was Atleast expecting a manager and if possible the owner to come and apologise to my guest but astonishingly this was not to be the case. To my utter disgust at the time of leaving also I didn't find a single person to even care to apologise or feel the guilt considering the magnitude of this event.

Gangaur was recommended by my boss n she keot praising this place so much that I had to drop by...situated in russel street this resto serves everything from north indian to chinese..ofcourse if you ask me I try the one which is the best..hence I chose the north indian thali..which was quite big for a person to complete..it had chole, dal makhani, some paneer curry which tasted good..yu can try this eith peas pulao or khulche...kulchas were quite light and spicy..less oily..but covered in ghee :p.. overall the experience was really good..

ok coming to the negative point,  the guy serving me seemed least interested to serve..the guy was facing in a diff direction while speaking to me which is a big bummer...anything asked 2nd or 3rd time comes after a very long time...which kinda kills your mood to have it n makes you repent of even asking for it...

one of the best places to go to if u are looking for a rich ghee loaded meal ... once in a  while i feel the urge and i go here... especially those 7.30 am club kachori and jalebi cravings... 

the place is always full and thus be assured of fresh food every time ...they also have some rajasthani food and their chaats are good too.... they just make really bad sandwiches

Gangaur 

Ganguar is situated in russel street and is a neighbour to teej restaurant . Its serves vegetarian food . The ambience of the place is quite average . I went there with a couple of friends .

Pros : 
1)they menu is vast you have a variety to choose from . 
2) We tried the dahi ke kabab and crispy chilly babycorn for starters which was average the babycorn was extra spicy.
3)for main course we had pindi chana ,daal makhani and laccha partha which was good . 
4)prices are not kept very high .

Cons :
1)the service is good but slow . We waited for half an hour may be more for our meal .
2)we even tried the gangaur sizzlers which was very bad . Not upto the mark .

Overall gangur is good place to drop in once a while when hungry and want lot of variety and affordable prices . Its a 3 from me .

I guess the whole restaurant has been overhauled!!! A perfect ambience for family members. I loved the taste of the north indian food served, it can give some serious competition in terms of kala daal and rotis to any punjabi dhaba. The staff was very welcoming and service was good.

i love the chola batura and the samosa they are simply mindblowing. the chutney which they serve is ezcellent. over and above the food is so fresh that you can taste the freshness. even the deasert such as the indrani is lovely especially when it is served chilled.

one of the better places for breakfast in kolkata. the taste of the food is excellent. usually there is a waiting time to get inside. they are not punctual to the timings of food written in the menu. but a must visit once on every trip to kolkata.

Orders that's a must are definitely kesari chai and jalebi. For food, that has to be club kachori before 10.30 am and belwa kachori after 11.30 am.

Gangaur is for those days when you get a craving for hot syrupy jalebis with the real flavour of saffron and puri which is of a unique size with the zingy taste of asafoetida flavoured potato curry. The kesariyan tea is uniwue and even though I prefer and am very rigid about black tea with the fine Darjeeling tea leaves this particular tea makes me unbelievably happy. The sugar is served separately to use as per taste. It is suggested that one arrives very early to find a seat since they fill up very quickly. This is one of the few places which serves jalebis with each circular rings of equal thickness and the syrup with its flavour of saffron is one of a kind. The jalebis are served piping hot and are a treat themsleves. The asafoetida adds that unique flavour to the potato curry which waters the mouth even as one writes about it. The club kachoris as is called are non oily even though it is deep fried. The decor is simple and elegant. The place is clean and hygienic. The good seating arrangement gives it the perfect place to start your day. The smell of ghee used in every product is evident from its intoxicating smell.

A purely veg restaurant locate at Russel Street.
Jalebi is good and plain dhokla too.
It is neither bad nor good,, an average restaurant. Earlier it was still a good one...
Food quality is deteriorating in order to the high prices.
I mainly dislike their mexican grilled sandwiches..
Papri Chaat is okay...Ambience is nothing special and prices as i mentioned above are bit high in order to the quantity and quality.
2.5 from me.
It needs a lot of improvement.

Located at Russel Street, have been frequenting this resto for years. The breakfast consisting of Club Kachori and Kesaria Jalebi steals the show. It has one of the best jalebis in the city. Other items that taste really good are Paw Bhaji and Belwa Kachori. 
Coming to the main course, the veggies like panner butter masala and gatta ki sabzi are decent and same for breads. The Gulab Jamun is exquisite. Do not try the babycorn or similar stuff. It is basically good for continental food.
The service quality is good and so is the staff behaviour. Parking is available on Russel/Park Street so thats not a major hassle. Its a very clean place with good tastes and ambiance.
p.s. - If you wanna have breakfast here on a Sunday morning, be prepared to wait for 45 mins outside this resto.
4 stars from me for Gangaur.

A place for strict veggies, Gangaur have a long menu. But they also have a very contradictory menu, with some awesome dishes listed along with a few "take a bite and throw away the rest" ones.

Positives

Club Kachori in the morning. If you like non Bengali jalebi over the Bengali jilipis then you must try them here. Chats are good. For lunch Missi Roti and Bedwi Puri are must tries. And along with them Gatta Masala and Sangeir Saag. There are few places in Calcutta to taste these awesome Rajasthani dishes.

Negatives

Most non Indian dishes. The worst pizza, maybe in the whole world.

Service

Generally good but at times can be rude.

This place is a favourite and love going back for their Rajasthani dishes and club kachoris.

Gangaur.. Situated in Russel Street within 5 minutes walking distance from The Park.. Have been frequenting this place since childhood for Sunday Breakfasts or Lunches sometimes.. It used to have the best Club Kachori and Jalebi in the city.. But off late, mainly since the renovation of the restaurant, the prices are going higher whereas quality is going down to a great extent. The food has become tasteless. The dosas and idlis are sour most of the times and the sambhar tastes like yellow dal with hugely cut vegetables thrown in - far from what a sambhar should taste like. The main course too is not good (ie just edible). The only thing you can be sure of having food here, is hygiene (I guess). 
One and a half stars from me.

If you like chats and want to eat it in hygenic conditions then Gangaur is a good place to drop in to. I like their club kachori and sabji for breakfast but the down side is they only serve it till 10am so you got to wake up early on a holiday and head out. They make good jalebis too. Most of their chaats are very good though my personal favourites are the Raj Kachori Chaat and Khasta Kachori Chaat. Their south indian is not bad either.

I am a pure vegetarian and there are very few Pure Veg restaurants around Park Street, hence i ended up here for a dinner. The food is average and taste is not up to the mark compared to the rates. I ordered Paneer Makhni and Tawa Roti (Phulka). Paneer Makhni didn't had any taste. I had to add TableSalt, lemon and pepper to add taste to it. Size of phulka was so small that you can finish it in one bite. And 1 Phulka cost you Rs 15. Which is quite unfair rate looking at its size. Overall an average food with average ambiance and relatively high rates.

i like the food here but they are not careful with your credit card. I paid my bill with credit card for Rs.533/-. While signing the card slip, I wrote a tip of Rs.50/-. Later in the night on the same day, i saw another debit in my card ( I got an email from my card issuing bank) that there is another debit - this time for Rs.583/- by Gangaur. This Gangaur restaurant folks were able to do even without my card. I called them over phone and spoke to one Mr.Sharma who could speak only Hindi and no English. He repeatedly told me that my earlier debit of Rs.533./- would get reversed automatically. He didnt accept my explanation that there appears to be a second debit on my card for the same transaction. So friends, if you go to this restaurant, please DONT USE YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD.

Very close to my office once upon a time and extremely popular with all of us. 

An Mecca from heaven for the chaat starved people that we were.

It just had standing room, with Raj Kachouri Chaat, Papdi Chaat that would give anyone in Delhi, Mumbai, Varanasi a run for their money.

All this followed by the most amazing bengali sweets, that you could choose across the counter & have it too.

I would like to think my family contributed seriously to their renovation etc.:) being such regulars whenever they came over.
