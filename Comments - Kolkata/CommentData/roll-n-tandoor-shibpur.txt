Located behind the Mandirtala Bus Stop this place is quite a popular joint when it comes to rolls and kebabs. The always busy joint serve some tasty rolls. This place was on the way to my tution during my school days so eating rolls from this place was a regular affair then and never did they disappoint me. So a must try place ðŸ˜‹

This restaurant is located exactly at mandirtala..very easy to locate...although there is always a queue in front of the shop..but the food is not upto the mark...i got chicken reshmi kabab n tikka kabab..the chicken was not very soft like other places..n the tandoor grill was also not fully done..so a bit disappointing experience for me

This is one of the ok restaurants in the locality ..... Actually the restaurant don't have enough space to sit and the restaurant is not atall clean the only thing is the food quality is overall good and they are specialized in different types of rolls .

Located absolutely beside Mandirtala Bus Stand. This is a small takeaway joint which serves Kathi Rolls. The price is a bit high compared to other Roll shops but the quality of the food is absolutely top knotch. The joint is clean and tidy. Service is good too. This shop is always crowded due to high demand of food which potrays the awesomeness of the delicacies they make. 
Cheers!

Chicken roll is good.
Uses chicken tandoori kebab pieces unlike others.
But prices are going high day by day.
Need not wait for long.
The person at the counter is very active.

Easy to locate. Mandirtala more. You will find a long queue almost all the time.Â 
I like the rolls they make, specially the Egg-Chicken one. Perfect for the evening snack.
Price is okay.

On one of my trips to IIEST shibpur, I was really hungry, so I stopped by this shop for a egg chicken roll. This shop is located at mandirtala more, so its easy to locate and a lot of awaiting bus passengers stop by at this shop for snacks. The roll was quite regular, but a bit on the oily side.

The city-famous mandirtala chicken roll. The variety and quality of rolls are too good. You will love it. Suggestions - try chicken roll, egg chicken roll.

This fast food(kati rolls mainly) has lost its food quality immensely in recent years. Same items with higher prices and lower quality. Waiting time is also too long,and this still survives because there is a dearth of good restaurants or fast food outlets in the area.
