For a hostelite, away from home, with calculated bucks to spend per month, and during times of intense hunger pangs, these are places you go to. Within budget, and hunger too strong to complain about taste. Not a suggestion, surely.

Located at 3A bus stand just above Raj darbar, La zawab is a veteran operational since many years. I along with my friends visited it and tried their mixed hakka noodles, egg fried rice, Manchurian and garlic chicken. I didn't Â had that much of an expectation but to my surprise the food Â was real good especially the mixed noodles. It's cheap and real value for money. Both the chicken dishes were great. Garlic chicken was the better of the two. The rice was a bit downer but apart from it there was no negativity. Ambience is just normal. They also served salad without charging for it. Food prices are cheap and both quantity and quality are good...

Like every vacation, this was also another one of the planned outing and also my first visit to this restaurant though this is one of the oldest restaurant in our locality. The ambience is ok but better than average considering it as a small eatery. We ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles, Egg Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian and Garlic Chicken. The service was quick and they provided complimentary salads which are usually not provided in other restaurants. The quantity was huge and the quality was good though the Manchurian tasted sweet and different but it was of good taste. I personally could not find any difference between the Manchurian and the Garlic Chicken in taste except the color. The Fried Rice was good but the Noodles were better. Didn't have much expectations from this place but we were very happy. The best part was the whole meal was very much pocket-friendly.

I didn't had much of an expectation from here but i must say the food quantity and quality blew my mind. I and my friends ordered for Mixed Hakka Noodles, Egg Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken and Chicken Manchurian. Mixed Hakka was better than Egg Fried Rice. Quantity for both was around same. Garlic and Manchurian was also quite good but you wont find much difference in its taste. Just a colour difference was all that i found. Ambiance was okay . You cant expect much here . Overall a decent experience and if you are looking for a quick low cost dinner then it can be a good option. Do not come here with great expectation and remember it does not have any air conditioner.

Lazawab is one of the oldest restaurant in Thakurpukur. Today I went there with my friends. It was a planned outing. The place is situated situated near to the Swadesbasu Hospital. The ambiance was ok. We tried some of their Chinese dishes as this restaurant is known for its Chinese cuisines. We ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles, Egg Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken and Chicken Manchurian. All the items tasted nice except the rice as I felt it was lacking some spices or ingredients. The quantity was enough and price was also reasonable. The service was also quick and prompt. For me the place deserves 4.

5-6 years back, this restaurant used to serve good standard food. The quality of food degraded drastically in these years. Not sure of this change but this is real bad news for foodies like me. The place was 10 mins of walking distance from my house. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Hope they realise and bring back those golden days of Lajawab

This Chinese place is a sister concern of raj darbar in thakurpukur. It is a very small place. Food is average but affordable. It is not a roaring success like raj darbar. The noodles are ordinary thin ones, not the Chinese style thick ones.

Worse worse worse the quality and thetaste of food sucks but the rate is cheap. Seriously we don't need cheaper food rather we need good food with good taste.

The quality of the food sucks. The ambience is  just a void word for this restaurant. You can call it a food joint ...a good version of a roadside joints. Don't expect anything great.

I am used to with this place from my childhood.When you have tight budget and feel of casual hangout there is nothing better than this place.Quantity to quality ratio is almost equal and service is noteworthy.Situated just beside the DH Road makes this place also easily accessible.Notable dishes are the mixed noodles and garlic chicken .

I went up there for many times or can be said i am a regular customer there. I liked the food they serve as they have a huge number of food options. The quantity is also huge and more than sufficient. The price is also pocket friendly but the quality of the food is just too good. They have a friendly ambience and the behaviour of the staff is also good.

OK this place is a teeny tiny food joint very very close to my place and one night we wanted to indulge in some cheap food on a quick decision at 9pm. Looked up the menu and ordered 5 items :
Veg fried rice: 2.5/5
Chicken butter masala and chicken kashmiri: tasted all the same, chicken pieces were tender n juicy but not cleaned really well to my standards so 2.5/5
Egg prawn rice: 2.5 nothing to ride home about
Chilli fish: 3/5 gravy was good and fish was less and batter was more!
But the biggest disappointment came in the form of the home delivery guy. As per the menu card I had ordered for Rs.380/- and inspite of mentioning twice that I needed a bill, the guy came in a cycle and said my amount was Rs.495/- and NO BILL!!!!! I paid up and took the parcel. I assume that the guy made quick bucks on his own. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! DONT ORDER HOME DELIVERY PPL!
Otherwise its OK food for a quick late night grab.

Well 2 b honest this is a restaurant with an xcellent location(3a bustand / thakurpukur region ) where ppl can easily avail their items...or looking 4 a sudden quick bite...

Personally i used to visit dis place Â 4 two reasons :

Â 1) nearby my home..so easy on the go !!

Â 2) Very good  chinese dishes they used 2 prepare associated with my childhood memories wn i used 2 visit dis place with my buddies specially aftr sum Â hangout times during puja vacations...Â 

Bt the point is.... nwadays i feel the standard  keeps on fluctuating and sumtimes they mess it up altogether nt matching up the level they used 2 produce.....starting from the food being very oily  to sum unavlbl items which they shud take care off  in order 2 rise the standard again which i really want !!!

I have been to this place a number of times.It looks shabby but every time I visit they surprise me with their amazingly tasty dish.I have tasted Chinese only and cannot comment on the North Indian Cuisine.Their  'Egg-chicken Gravy Chowmein is a must try.
