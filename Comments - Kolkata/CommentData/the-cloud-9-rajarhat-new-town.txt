Have been hearing about Cloud 9 for a long time,  and decided to order food through swiggy.  Chicken Chilli garlic fried rice was decent in quantity and quality , though I felt garlic has been overused. Chilli mushroom was a disappointment and tasted extremely bland; schezuan chicken was all red and extremely spicy with small-sized chicken pieces. The only saviour was drums of heaven, which did taste great.  Overall,  the experience was dissapointing.

This is a nice spacious restaurant near Chinar park Rajarhat. The ambience here is too good.And. As for the food, diversity is the word.They serve Indian,Continental and Chinese.Want more? There's Hookah as well.We went there on Christmas day and there was live music, they played English pop music and even some Bollywood songs too.Music added another flavour to the ambience. Sitting arrangement are available for different groups of people.For instance Sofas are there and if you want to sit on the floor comfortably while smoking hookah with friends there is high floor with cushions. If this isn't enough there is a pool board and a separate room where party with family and friends can be arranged.
The only minus point is that the service was a bit slow. But the Food,The hookah was awesome.
Try this cafe cum restaurant if you haven't visited it yet.

Their cozy atmosphere and luxurious hospitality feels like pure bliss.Now coming to the X factor of this place -The food here. From chinese to continental to indian they have done justice to every cuisine.Every dish that was presented was a treat to the eyes as well as the taste buds.Talking about the ambiance ,the lively music and live sports screening is like cherry on the cake. And also you can enjoy your time by playing pool and billiards.

Was looking for continental foods and found out about this from Zomato. First the entry of the restaurant is totally confusion. There is a back side entry of the situated building which is very dirty and the lift is horrible. We went there around 8pm on weekdays and found the entire place filled of smokes from hookah. The crowd is not looked good at all. However, we asked for continental items and unfortunately it is not available. Even north indian items are not available. Only items available are the basic chinese. 

This is a total waste of our time. will not visit again.

The “Worst” hookah parlour in Rajarhat area... I’m a chef at JW Marriott Kolkata & food quality is pathetic... 
The chef in C9 has no idea about spices.. 
I heard good reviews about this place but the experience was awful ✌️ I’d recommend not to waste money in C9.

Went to The Cloud 9 to grab a quick bite with my friend. The ambience is quite loud and trance-like with latest hip hop plus punjabi songs playing.
Ordered a garden fresh pizza and penne pasta arabiata. The food was quite filling and tasty with an exotic Italian taste to it. The only minor setback was the time taken to serve the food (more than 25 minutes) but if you're going with a larger gang, you won't mind waiting.
Overall a good experience, will definitely try the hookah next time.

Been here a lot of times, they have reworked their menu and interiors few months ago. Sheesha is just above average. Pool table is definitely a plus point. They can actually work on their staff mannerisms. My recommendation is Chicken drumstick, and chilli babycorn.

The ambience here is too good. The entrance is a litlle bit dirty. But  the inside is too good. There is a differnt room for the people who wants to throw a party to his/her group of friend. There is also a pool game inside. And there is sitting place for differnt kind of people, I mean to say that if someone like to sit on sofa then sofa is there,if someone like to have hookah in an ordinary restaurant way then there are high chairs for them and for the ones who love to sit on floor and have hookah  that is also available. The service here is not upto the mark but the food and hookah quality is much good here.

DIVERSITY is the word that perfectly defines CLOUD 9.

From Indian and continental delicacies to lip smacking chinese dishes you name it and they'll serve you the variety of dishes from different genre under the same rooftop.

It not only offers a fine dining experience but at the same time grant's access for some relaxation activities such as sport's screenings,billiards and with that you can also enjoy various flavours of hookah and alcohol.

The food is good but what draws my attention here is the versatility of their menu and  how prominently they're carving their way to reach the standards everytime despite the stiff competition it gets from the neighbours such as Aminia and Arsalan of CHINAR PARK but the ambience here is completely different amd interesting as it offer's an experience way different than it's neighbours and the options here are wide.

But the best part about this place is THE MUSIC.
From Ed Sheeran to Coldplay, you can gulf your food and smoke your hookah with the tunes travelling to your heart along with your food, which's travelling to your stomach but the flavours of which are getting involved in your senses.

Now let's talk about the food we had.

✓Coolers

• Paan mojito - The flavours of paan blending with that of mint and lemon is the perfect refreshment drink to start off the food journey on a positive note.
• Cranberry cooler - The vibrant flavour of cranberry enriched by kaffir lime.
• C9 Float - Orange flavoured soda topped with vanilla ice cream,offers a creamy and sweet flavour to digest.

✓Shakes

•Admas Green Apple -  The rich and creamy shake,the contents of which are Green apple and mint blended with vanilla ice cream.

✓Indian starter

•Mutton bhara kebab - Succulent mutton dibres which are marinated over night in curd with the mixture of indian spices,allowing the flavours to dig deep and add to the taste.

•Chicken Nizami- It's the celebration pf spices in your tastebuds which is depectably enriched by the usage of saffron curd.

•Achari Aloo - A tangy twist to baked Aloo urf potato,the flavours of which is mainly originated from the spicy aachaar.
The dish is served with Pudina Chutney.

✓Chinese starter

•Sweet and sour paneer - Tangy yet sweet,this paneer dish is one of the most interesting aspects of their menu and is the ideal one for the vegetarians as the taste is vibrant and the flavours of which is originated from the panner itself and not overflow of spices.

•Pan fried chicken is all about the delicately tossed chicken pieces in a chefs special sauce,the taste of which'll shake awake your senses.

✓Continental

•Veg mexican- Fresh vgetables tossed in a tomato gravy and is served with Mexican rice.
The flavours of whoch turns out to be exotic.

•Spaghetti Neapolitan- Spaghetti tossed in neapolitan sauce with the blend flavoursome chicken chunks and to add to the creaminess, parmesan cheese is added as a topping

•Chicken Stroganoff is a butter rich delicacy Cloud 9 has to offer where the soft and creamy chicken chunks, simmering in the buttery gravy adds to the overall experience of this food trip.
It's basically the chinese version of BUTTER CHICKEN.

✓Indian main course

 •Matka chicken is an authentic village preparation where the chicken is cooked slowly in earthen pot with mild spices,the flavour of which is on the smoky half and the taste of which originates from the chicken itself - raw flavours,settling with the spices, the richness of which is perfectly attained by the usage of earthen pot, which adds to the authenticity, look and raw taste of this rural delicacy.

It's not just a food but is a celebration of rural india.

•Chicken patiala- chicken stuffed in thick omlet topped with Cashew and saffron gravy.

•Veg cheese handi is all about the variety of vegetables cooked in cheese and cream gravy,the juices of each and every vegetable coming into harmony and creating a flavour which's unique and vibrant.

•Corn palak,the flavours of which evolves from the buttery gravy,where the spinach blends with the butter and allows the corn to relax itself and dissolve the juices,thus evolving the taste in this process.


•Kashmiri Naan
•Garlic naan.
•Kashmiri pulao

✓Chinese main course


•C9 Special noodles is served with prawn chips and poached egg and the addition of various veggies adds to the smoky flavour.
•Chicken chilly garlic fried rice
•Hot garlic chicken is a spicy treat to your tastebuds and adds to the experience if had with rice or chow.
•Chicken in chilly oyster sauce is on the flat side and the flavours are calm but rich and thick.

✓Desserts


•Daab Malai ice cream - The essence of tender coconut blending with the note of cream,the taste so soothing that you can't resist ordering the second scoop.

•Nolengurer ice cream - The icy fusion of cream with the authentic nolen gur(jaggery) is one of the most beautiful addition to the food scene of kolkata and cloud 9 is doing justice maintaining the same.

Authentic! Is the word.


So if you're staying near Airport or in North kolkata or salt lake,do give this place a try.

The hospitality is amazing and the ambience is for the perfect getaway from all the chaos and celebrate the fusion of food and lounge.

Cloud 9 has all the ingredients to take you high on cloud 9.Located bang opposite Holiday Inn,this place is the new hangout destination for the next gen.The restaurant cum hookah bar is a combination of lip smacking food and great ambience.The place has a pool table and a hooka zone where you can relax and have a drag of your favourite flavour of hookah.They also have a private space where you can host your parties.

A huge and lavish spread laid out in front of me.Trying to walk through all that as i recall.Here goes the list:


 🍁Paan mojito- Fresh cooler with mint leaves this one was quite good
🍁Cranberry cooler- Cranberry crush flavoured with kaffir lime and lemon
🍁C9 Float - Creamy vanilla ice cream floating on top of mango flavoured soda.
🍁Admas Green Apple-  Smoothy and rich milk shake in green apple flavour .The vanilla ice cream adds to the creamy texture.

🍁Achari Aloo-Potatoes marinated and grilled so soft and melting in mouth.Served with a dollop of tangy mint Chutni on the side.
🍁Mutton Barra kebab- This one is a recommendation for meat lovers.The mutton is marinated over night with curd and spices.The magic works in making the meat so soft falling of the bone. 
🍁Chicken Nizami- Succulent and soft boneless pieces of chicken marinated in curd and garam masala char grilled to perfection .The secret touch is the hint of saffron that they add.

🍁Sweet and sour paneer -- The pineapple adds to the natural sweetness of the gravy.The sour comes from the soy.It was a bit too sweet for my palate.
🍁Pan fried chicken- Pan tossed chicken in spicy sauce makes for a good starter.
🍁Spaghetti Neapolitan- Spaghetti tossed in olive oil and topped with a sprinkle of parmesan.
🍁Chicken stroganoff- Rich and creamy gravy of chicken and a portion of buttered rice.The sauce had a great texture due to the cheese added.
🍁Veg mexican- Exotic veggies tossed in tangy tomato based gravy with a portion of mexican rice.

🍁Corn palak--This one is a personal recommendation from my end.The palak gravy was mind-blowing in terms of flavour and texture.Generous amounts of ghee that makes the gravy smooth and delicious.
P.s--This is not for the faint hearted.
🍁Chicken Patiala- Omlette stuffed with chicken and topped with cashew nuts for that crunch as you bite in.Loved this preparation from the menu
🍁Matka Chicken--Slow cooked gravy of Chicken in  earthen pot to retain the rustic flavour that comes from the spices.
🍁Veg cheese Handi- Mix veg in white cheesy gravy did not impress me much.
🍁Kashmiri Naan--The Naan was soft and flavoursome
🍁Garlic naan.--The garlic Naan was soft with the butter brushed on it
🍁Kashmiri pulao--I found this one to be extremely sweet.The fruits and nuts add to the richness and the generous amount of ghee that you could smell wit the first bite.
🍁C9 Spl noodle- The noodles well tossed in spices and served with prawn chips and fried egg.I found it lacking flavour.
🍁Chicken chilly garlic fried rice-- The chilly garlic fried rice was lightly flavoured and paired well with the chicken gravy
🍁Hot garlic chicken--The chicken could have used a little more garlic in the sauce.
🍁Chicken in chilly oyster sauce--This one would be another recommendation.The sauce so balanced with the veggies and chicken made an shinning combination.

🍁Daab Malai ice cream--My personal favourite list has this one last item.The daab flavour lingers in yoir mouth for a long time.
🍁Nolengur ice cream--Another delicacy from my chart of blockbusters ,the gur was the star of the evening as I dig in my second serving😬😬


The hookah was too light and i did not get much flavour.Though after the first coal change, it became a bit better.The staff were very warm serving us with happy smiles everytime they came over.Kudos and love to this new baby wishing more success.

A place where you can go to hangout wih friends.
The place is a bit overpriced. 
They have pool table, that's one of the good things there. 
If you are there with a large bunch of people and don't wanna get disturbed then you can take the personal room.
The food is 'okay', music is good and seating arrangement is good.

Yes, the name justifies their tagged name “Cloud 9”. Cloud 9 means when you are on heaven above all the clouds in the state of extreme happiness. This outlet have given me that type of feeling only. This gonna be in my memory for a long time. Excessive gulping of foods at one go. Really a hidden gem in the city.

It’s not just a café but can be said a disc cum lounge with proper multi cuisine restaurant having playing options too. One thing is that they have hookah license and they don’t serve alcoholic bevarages.

Location: – Located near Chinar Park Crossing (Rajarhat) above Aminia at 3rd floor!

Ambience: – Ambience is nice with different sections ie., Pool table area, Cabanna Area, Normal sofa dine in area and Private room for private parties. The ambience created with dimlight is soothing enough. They have set up a big screen for videos and live screening with good music system and loved the choice of the tracks they were playing.

Food:- I must say it had exceeded my expectations. From cooler and shakes to starters and from main course item to ice cream. Never expected such kind of quality and delicious food at that café. Cant rate less that 5 to them. They deserve 5/5. When I asked, they told that they have hired a chef from dubai and trust me by looking on to the food art and after munching.. One phrase – “Hats off to that chef”.

The best among all those are Kit kat Shake, Cranberry Cooler, Green Apple Shake, Chicken Chapli Kebab, Chicken Pahari kebab, Matka chicken and Daab Malai Ice cream. All there are on my recommendation list. Recommeded indeed…!!

Yes, the name justifies their tagged name “Cloud 9”. Cloud 9 means when you are on heaven above all the clouds in the state of extreme happiness. This outlet have given me that type of feeling only. This gonna be in my memory for a long time. Excessive gulping of foods at one go. Really a hidden gem in the city.

It’s not just a café but can be said a disc cum lounge with proper multi cuisine restaurant having playing options too. One thing is that they have hookah license and they don’t serve alcoholic bevarages.

Location: – Located near Chinar Park Crossing (Rajarhat) above Aminia at 3rd floor!

Ambience: – Ambience is nice with different sections ie., Pool table area, Cabanna Area, Normal sofa dine in area and Private room for private parties. The ambience created with dimlight is soothing enough. They have set up a big screen for videos and live screening with good music system and loved the choice of the tracks they were playing.

Food:- I must say it had exceeded my expectations. From cooler and shakes to starters and from main course item to ice cream. Never expected such kind of quality and delicious food at that café. Cant rate less that 5 to them. They deserve 5/5. When I asked, they told that they have hired a chef from dubai and trust me by looking on to the food art and after munching.. One phrase – “Hats off to that chef”.

The best among all those are Kit kat Shake, Cranberry Cooler, Green Apple Shake, Chicken Chapli Kebab, Chicken Pahari kebab, Matka chicken and Daab Malai Ice cream. All there are on my recommendation list. Recommeded indeed…!!

The Cloud 9 is located in the same building as Aminia, Chinar Park. It is situated on the 3rd floor and the entrance to the place might confuse you a bit. I was invited here by Mr. Aditya Pareek (Manager) to try out the food items here. Although, not very difficult to locate, i have suggested them to add some kind of signal or standee so that one can easily locate the way to their Cafe cum Lounge.
                                                                ...

Cloud 9 is heaven for party freak foodie people.

It has pool table , live screening for sports music , high end speaker set and pretty dim light to keep your party mood high and give u proper lounge feeling, a privet dining room ,dance floor and many more.

There are not many cafes in kolkata who serves multi cuisine dishes in one floor. Cloud 9 is one of those gem. it is located in 3rd floor of Aminia Building,Chinar park, Rajarhat.

I start from the cooler-

* Cranberry cooler- eye catchy part was the lemon peel design. most soothing cooler I ever had.it was mixture of cranberry crush ,kafir lime and mint leaves. Must try.

On Cloud 999999999 at Cloud 9!

Have we ever come across a place – which operates under the garb of a café, but is much much more than that? Call it a fine dining, call it a lounge, call it a multi-cuisine restaurant, call it a disc, call it private dining, call it a café, call it anything from within the food dictionary ………….. and this place is that!

Cloud 9 is a so-called café, which is not only a café, but perhaps the only place in the whole of Kolkata – which is giving a fine dining experience in the true sense. When it comes to cafes, then we the foodies expect only a few hookahs and a few cocktails! But these are just the tip of the iceberg at this place, given its exhaustive variety of starters, mocktails, mains and desserts of India, Continental and Italian cuisines!

Having hardly any knowledge of this place, little we foodies knew that what we were about to witness is 1 of the greatest journeys of our food and blogging careers!

Location: - Chinar Park (Rajarhat) atop Aminia, 3rd floor!

Ambience: - Tis fine, with very entertaining numbers playing in the background, the high-end speakers and music sets do keep you entertained. Lights are pretty dim to give you the proper lounge feeling!

Service: -

They serve you as if you are next of their kin / a blood relative, don’t know what makes them serve tirelessly with a smile – customer satisfaction, I guess!

Coolers-

(i)	Paan mojito- Mojito mocktail blended with lemon, mint leaves and (quite to our surprise) – beetel leaves, which impart it the unique taste!

(ii)	Cranberry cooler- Cranberry crush with kafir lime and lemon as well as crushed mint leaves – 1 of the most soothing coolers! The lemon peel design will definitely melt your heart!

(iii)	C9 special - 4 layers of cooler - orange, green apple, cranberry and mango – fine on taste which was overpowered by the excess ice content.

Shakes-

(iv)	Kit kat Shake- Thick and very rich chocolate shake with flavours of kit kat chocolate and a dollop of vanilla ice cream, topped with choco rolls and lots of chocolate sauce – and served in a huge glass (approx. 750 ml) – I bet you can’t have a whole by yourself. 

(v)	Green Apple shake – Green apple blended in milk induced with a scoop of vanilla and further topped with green apple liquid, this was the star of all the drinks we had.

Salad-

(vi)	Cold Pasta salad- Fresh lettuce, capsicums, corn, bell peppers and topped with a cherry, basil and parmesan cheese – along with a few croton cubes - I classify this as the best cold salad I have ever had.

(vii)	Crispy noodle salad- Crispy noodles tossed in sweet chilly sauce, lots of lemon and fresh chopped vegetables. Served with spring onion toppings and (surprisingly) peanuts, they give you the perfect munch!

Soup-

(viii)	Tom Yum soup – Prepared with a Thai punch with vegetable overload, this one works just fine.

Indian starters-

(ix)	Paneer sufiana – Inhouse manufactured cottage cheese cube chunks marinated in curd, saffron and lots of Indian spices with coriander leaves atop - 5 pieces of this and each one’s a 5/5 for taste and a 5/5 for presentation. Goes best with the overspicy mint pudina chutney served complimentary!

(x)	Makai Malai kebab- They claim that you need not chew on this and it melts automatically on the tongue! And yes, all what they claim is indeed true! Paneer and corn kernels kebab topped with Mawa and served with steamed corn.

Chinese starter- 

(xi)	Crispy Vegetable – The only item falling below expectations, lots of vegetables, babycorns etc being over fried and served with chopped spinach corn topping, the over fry overpowering the taste!

(xii)	Hakka paneer – This counts down as 1 of the best Chinese dishes I have ever had, lots of paneer cubes marinated with lots of Chinese sauces and served with lots of onion as well as spinach corn, just the perfect taste!

Continental-

(xiii)	American mafia Burger- Mind the size, double patty burger with layers of cheese, jalapeno, olive, lettuce, tomatoes and caramelized onions. The complimentary fried onion rings and fries compliment this one just perfectly, the king size burger satisfies the most behemoth of the hunger!

(xiv)	Chicken stake - served with rice and fresh vegetables tossed in butter.

Indian main course-

(xv)	Subzi-E-Diwani – Mix veggies, but somewhat high on spice, but high on taste also!

(xvi)	Corn palak – As smooth as silk, steamed sweet corn marinated in lots of butter and of course spinach, great on taste and will become better once better quality spinach is available in the markets!

(xvii)	Peas pulao – A regular winner, good quality peas in the making along with lots of dry fruits!

(xviii)	Dum biryani – Kudos to the flour layer used for covering this so that it does not go cold!

(xix)	Naan (Regular and Garlic), Lachcha Paratha – Could not taste, but definitely looked a trillion bucks, especially the mini garlic piece studded naans!

(xx)	Tawa roti – Served on request, as we were too full to eat any of the sophisticated naans and kulchas!

Chinese main course-

(xxi)	Rice / sautéed vegetables – Great presentation, although, had to skip these!

Appetisers-

(xxii)	Jaljeera – Prepared in water base to keep it light – this was more of a soda shikanji with a pinch of jaljeera – a great appetiser!

(xxiii)	Thumbs up can – Served on request – mildly cold – to digest the tons of delicacies we had!

Desserts-

(xxiv)	Daab Malai ice cream – They prepare their own ice creams, and one has to taste their daab malai to convince himself that ice cream can be this tasty! With each bite, the studded daab malai elevates you to a new high, and you can’t ask for a better ending to 25 course meal!

(xxv)	Mishti paan – No better way of keeping a Kolkattan happy more than serving him a few paans at the end of a sumptuous meal!

All in all, this place qualifies as :-

(a)	A must visit place before you die

(b)	A place which provides a PERFECT experience altogether!

(c)	The only competitor of BBQ Nation in Kolkata!

Visit it or regret it!

We ordered from this restaurant so can't say anything about the ambience. Coming straight to the food, we ordered Mexican chicken salami burger, burnt garlic coriander rice, chilli mushroom and tandoori chicken. The chilli mushroom was gravy based. The mushroom pieces were too small and the gravy a bit watery. A below average dish. The burger came with fries and they were soggy. The burger as such was really average. The taste of coriander in the fried rice was overpowering other flavours of the rice. The tandoori chicken was pretty good. Over all it is good for one time. The food is really below average and not worth the price they charge. The packaging was good.

I cannot comment on the ambiance as i had opted for a delivery and i must say it was pretty slow and infact late. Anyways i was not keeping my hopes high on the quality and taste of the food here especially after seeing the reviews but since i had no option (unexpected guests) i called in to order. So coming directly to food i ordered for stuffed chicken wings which surprisingly was good and my guests relished on them. Next was the cheese kebab which again proved to be a winner and honestly the delay in delivery was quickly forgotten and forgiven. The only dish that was pathetic was the crispy fish. It hardly had any fish but definitely had a fish smell which proves the fillet wasnt marinated well before deep frying. For mains i had ordered for chicken bharta which was upto mark although a bit too oily. 

Price is average. Quality of food can be rectified.

Awesome place for casual hangouts! This lounge, located on the 3rd floor of Aminia building in Rajarhat, makes you go through shady stairs resembling those of horror stories to a wonderful surprise (Tip to the owners, please fix the entrance. It would attract a lot many customers).

The lounge is lovely with cozy seats atypical to hookkah parlours, nice music with tv screens present too. The volume is just perfect to keep the mood going and keep conversations flowing too without having to scream.

Coming to the food. The lounge boasts of a variety of cuisine covering bits and pieces of Italian, Chinese, American and Indian. We had the 4 cheese pasta. Which was ok. Chinese items were really good. Prices are on the decent side although the shakes are a bit pricey but were good. We tried the seesha too and the price didn't pinch us too much.

The drinks bring me to the service which was exquisite. We had ordered a Mango Bliss which unfortunately was not available but we were provided with a litchi shake. The person serving us noticed that my partner didn't like it too much and promptly came forward and asked us if we wanted to replace it with anything else! The food orders might take a while longer to come but you won't mind sitting there a while longer for sure.

To sum it all up :
Food : 3.5/5
Ambiance : 5/5
Service : 4.5/5

I was once a regular customer of this lounge.
The last time I visited this place was before a month or so. 
They have made a few changes in the past one or two months. They have added a couple more seating places outside, changed the menu and some staffs. 
The new staffs are very friendly and very prompt. 
They have added some interesting combo offers. Having 3 options in 1099 combo, Indian , Chinese and continental. We chose the Chinese combo. 
In that combo they offered a shisha, 3 soft drinks, starter, noodles/rice and one main course item. 
In hookah we ordered Gum supari which was pretty smooth and the first coal lasted for about 45-50 mins. 
In starter we ordered drum stick. It was spicy yet tasty. 
The noodles and gravy chilly chicken were fantastic. 
Plus as a regular customer I would suggest you to try the tandoori chicken and chicken pizza. It’s delicious. 
All in all a good place to hangout.

Its a kinda local adda for me.Frequently visit this place. Located at the Chinar park junction.Awesome place to have Hookah.Come here with friends and chill out over a  puff of Sheesha and finger foods.Must try double apple flavor Hookah.Adding to this is the inclusion of Pool Table in a separate section of cafe.Board games like chess,checkers,etc.Whenever i visit this place i play a round of pool.They charge for that on hourly basis.
Noodles,chicken drumsticks,Chicken Nuggets will be very good here.Food price is reasonable..Place is big.Nice sitting arrangements. Decor is good.Friendly staffs.Monthly weekend parties are being organised here.

We we're looking for good Chinese food for dinner last night. Seeing the variety in their menu ordered from here. The delivery was on time.
Items : Chicken Manchow Soup , Chicken Schezwan Rice, Chicken Butter garlic Fried Rice , Mix Chilli Garlic fried rice and Chicken in Chilli oyster sauce.
The soup was best and we longed for more. Among the varied fried rice dishes, chicken butter garlic fried rice tasted awesome. The rest two were also good but not great. What I didn't like was the chicken in Chilli oyster sauce. The chicken was hard and it tasted bland.  Overall a good experience. Will surely try another dishes.

But it has issue with delivery time and food quality at night but at least its delivering food so late at night , so no complains :) , would be a 5 out 5 rating if they fix der delivery timing and quality of food.

Went there on Monday around 7 totally empty cafe.
I thought it was closed but staff said we are open.
Nothing great about ambience. Keep changing the song in one minutes dont know what the problem..
Place order of Lasagne which has no taste. Complain to the service boy he said i know. Given excuse they dont have proper chef. I said then why you taking the order he was speechless. Totally a wastage of money. Order vanilla rasna hookah which was good n smooth. Not such a good place for food.

Celebrated my friend's birthday here. Quite a good place. The chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream is the best according to me. The service was quite fast and they were very helpful. Will definitely visit again.

Worst food ever. Food quality was very poor. They served us with rotten dal makhani. This place should be reported to the food board. They serve food till late night and provides us with stale food which maximum can't complain coz they're the only one serving food this late.

LOCATION: Its located on the 3rd floor of Meena tower(Aminia Building),Chinar Park. Its near City Centre Mall-2.
AMBIENCE: Cloud 9 no doubt is the biggest cafe cum hookah lounge with a gaming zone. They have an ambience that provides an electric atmosphere where you can listen to crazy music and watch sports or music videos on the big screen. Overall,the ambience is nice.
STAFF: The staff members were really friendly,courteous and approachable. 
FOOD: They provide a large number of eateries and have a lot of variety. The food they provide is very delicious. Specially their Indian cuisine is really tasty.
They did not disappoint me with their food.
Coming to the food - I had ordered 
1) Spaghetti Carbonara (4.5/5) - Spaghetti served with smooth cream sauce and minced chicken. Garlic bread was served as a add on(no extra charges). This was the best spaghetti I had till date. The flavor of smooth cream sauce with minced chicken together was just delicious! The garlic bread was a crisp garlic flavored bread loaded with Italian herbs and it tasted good. It's worth a try.

I opted for online ordering which was one of the worst decisions I have made. Food was delivered late due to the inefficiency of delivery guys/hotel managers as they didn't make a call before searching for my place. After 2 hours received the food and was really disappointed by the quality of the food, considering the price they charged even the quantity was less. I ordered noodles,rice, Chicken Sweet and Sour from chinese cuisine and rice/mutton roghan josh . I would never order any item from here again in future.

Have seen many times while passing chinar park. I wanted to follow there and check out the restaurant. Yesterday I took a chance and ordered food from here. The delivery was with in 1 hr. It was delayed by some minutes due to rain,but it's ok.
I had ordered 1 Chinese non veg combo(non veg hakka noodles+chikn Manchurian(4pc)+drums of heaven(2 pc)+lime soda) and a beriyani combo(chikn beriyani+chikn chap+raita).
Coming to the food,it was okish kind. Beriyani was ok. Not that much tasty,the beriyani chikn was a bit extra salty,chikn chap was very good. There was nothing special about the raita. It was as usual. The quantity of the beriyani rice was not up to the mark.
The Chinese combo was horrible except the drums of heaven. Quantity of the amount of the noodles was like 10 rupees Maggie. In chikn Manchurian the chickens were coated with thick batter and the gravy was like extra sweet. The drums of heaven was the best part of that meal. It was good,spicy and tasty. I am kind of disappointed with the food quality and the quantity both. When you are giving combos,please do maintain the quantity and quality. If u can't,then don't offer combos. It's very bad I would say. Hope guys will work on it. Thank you.

Ordered a chicken tikka pizza using the online ordering platform of Zomato ! Firstly the pizza wasn't as I had expected and a lot of improvement can be made, right from its shape, to its quality and taste ! For the price charged it was not that good! A decent pizza at the best !

About the zomato online ordering platform , a few points ; it would be better if some sort of GPS tracking of the order is possible , helps a lot , instead of calling delivery executive or getting called for location !

Overall a decent pizza delivered at doorstep on a rainy night ,but price was high when compared to pizza quality !

This is one of those very few hookah bars that serves amazing food. We ordered for a cafe frappe, pineapple shake, cloud9 pasta and 3paan hookah (medium), which i thought we should have ordered for the strong one. But i must say that the food was really good and the pasta was baked to perfection. The people around are very polite. Will visit this place very soon to try out the pool table as well as the delicious spread.

Cloud 9 is a hookah bar located in China park, 3rd floor of Aminia building.
Ambience justifies it's name. Sitting arrangements are decorated with couches and cushions. If you like loud music then you will also like this place.
There are not many varieties but foods are tasty.
 Good service.
It is a very nice place if you are looking for a hookah bar within budget.

Ordered tandoori chicken half and paneer kadhai today. My review is bad for the restaurant.

First, my order delivered so late, very poor service.
Second, tandoori chicken half was a disaster. One of the leg piece had only bones but no meat. paneer kadhai was so oily and taste less. 
Third, food quality is very very low standard. Feels like street hotels food.
My review rating is 1. Be careful to make orders for dinner, it's not worth.

Situated just above aminia, chinar Park this place does justice to its name. This place has got an electrifying ambience, awesome hookahs, good food and good service as a feather on the hat. The couch which is made for big college or generic groups is very comfortable and cozy. Among the food items crispy chilli baby corn cooked with red sauce and lip smacking babycorns will renew your taste buds. Kudos team of cloud 9 :)

A complete late night savior. They offer Indian, Chinese, Continental and finger food. My order was paneer pasanda , Garlic Naan , wheat chapati , Veg Biryani and Virgin Mojito. 
Delivery - It was exactly on time & the delivery boy was courteous and wished me good night.
Packaging - These guys have taken there work seriously and i mean it. These was spoon, Tissue paper & a complementary mouth freshener.
Food - Paneer pasanda was just wow less oily , creamy garnished with cream and coriander. This was the best paneer I had. Veg Biryani was also good it had chunks of panner ,cashews and flovour was just perfect. What stand out for me was the Virgin Mojito it was completely refreshing and was perfectly delivered.

Verdict - Highly recommend for home delivery they delivery it till Morning 4:00 am and currently they are giving 20% off on there home delivery. I guess they are the only restaurant serving mocktail and shakes.

Though we haven't tried hukkah coz we're short of time but pool room was cool, so as other board games with lotz of balloons, good music & big enough TV for boys to watch cricket 😊 Food is average, service is excellent! We look forward for our next party in this joint. Points to ponder: Avoid chicken drumsticks 🍗 and they don't serve alcohol, thought of sharing 😜. Recommendation: Yes

Nice place that offers a lot of food vareity for a cafe. Best part they are always keen on the customers opinion after the meal to improve their quality and service. Their delivery is quite promt too. If you guys are not a regular at this place and trying to use the Zomato app for ordering I would suggest to call up the joint first and they can suggest you the best fit as their full menu is not uploaded in the site.Burgundy, chicken Vatican and grilled chicken in mushroom sauce are some of the  items deserving special mention. If you stick to the continental items and the starters you won't be disappointed.

The Cloud 9 is located in Chinar Park above Aminia. I ordered Chicken Dum Biryani and Ghost Bhunke for delivery to my home. I will break down my review into delivery time, packaging, food quantity & pricing and food quality.
Timing: The food was delivered withing 45 minutes and the delivery guy was courteous.
Packaging: The food was not packed properly and when I received it the box containing Biryani was already half open. Packaging is surely something they can improve upon.
Food Quantity and Pricing: Food Quantity was again a disappointment. I was charged Rs. 179 for Biryani and Rs. 269 for Gosht Bhunke which is on par with Aminia and Arsalan. The least I would expect is proper quantity of food. The Biryani was 70% of what you will get from other restaurants and Gosht Bhunke was delivered in a small box which was half empty.
Food Quality: Food quality and the taste was where I was completely stumped. After seeing the packing and quantity I was not expecting much from the food. However I was pleasantly surprised. Biryani was light and not very oily. The taste was also good. The Gosht Bhunke was absolutely fantastic. After a very long time I tasted mutton so well made. It tasted like heaven.
The Cloud 9 can definitely improve on their packaging and food quantity. Giving 3.5 for the food quality and service.

Step 1 - food ordered with simple instructions that no veggies in the noodles. Order delivery confirmed for 70 minutes. Yes , 1 hr 10 mins to deliver a simple order.

Step 2 - food arrived and it was wrong as indicated in the pik below. Full of green veggies which I had already informed in special instructions and by calling the restaurant. 

Step 3 - took help from zomato support, piles n tonnes of sorry from their side. Restaurant and zomato confirms the order replacement in 15 mins.

Step 4 - it's now 1 hr 20 mins more now , I am waiting for a replacement of my order.

Step 5 - I started calling the restaurant to follow up on my order and no response.
I have waited for 2 hr 10 mins now and no replacement of my food is done. 

After my several attempts to reach the restaurant,  , the owner "out of the blues" calls and tells me that he was busy with his 04 people and couldn't answer my phone calls and his chef didn't took cooking instructions properly. He's replacing the order now. God knows what was happening all this time.

I think this restaurant doesn't deserve to be anything anywhere for food ordering.  Should be shut down immediately. 

I am really very upset and don't expect zomato doing tie ups with bullshit restaurants. 

I would give a negative rating if possible. 
-1000

Well, This is the worst experience I ever faced in a restaurant . Me and my friends went there to have some food and hookah. First of all, we asked for two hookah's and the manager promised to give us two complimentary coal. But as we finished and asked for complimentaries the manager denied his words. Moreover they forced us to give service tax which is optional as per government terms. The ambience was very bad. The waiters were not friendly and argued with us baselessly. To Those who will be reading this, please don't waste time and money in this place.

The Veg Jalfrezi was nicely made and contained loads of veggies like Onion's, Capsicum, Beans, Cauliflower's, Tomatoes, Carrots, Baby corn, and Paneer not too spicy at all. On the other hand the Paneer Butter Masala was tasty and did taste of butter had ample pieces of Paneer. The Quantity provided was sufficient to fill 2/empty stomachs. Very happy to order from this place would like to try their other delicacies as well. the best part was the food was hot and delivered on time.

We ordered Chicken in Chilly Sauce and Chicken Shanghai Rice. 
I would say this is the worst order I have received through Zomato. 
The rice item was under cooked. Chicken item which was initially displayed as 6 small chicken pieces, basically had 4 chickens. Out of 6 pieces 2 of them was just a ball of under cooked flour, those 2 pieces  did not have any trace of chicken at all. Rest 4 pieces was 50%covered with flour. 
Terrible chilly Chicken I have ever had. If you have written something on your menu try to prepare that only , not something else. 
I am just wondering how can it get a rating of 3+.

I usually don't like to visit clubs but Hookah Bars are one of my favourites. I visited Cloud 9 many a times but the last time I visited there with four friends. We had ordered for the combo of Rs. 1499. The food was delicious. And the ambience was damn good. But the sofas were a bit torn which made us a bit uncomfortable. The price is reasonable. I would like to suggest people to try this place atleast once. :)

A Hookah Parlour where you will get good Chinese food and Mocktails.
Those who love Hookah will literally like this place. I liked it too. As some of my friends have membership there, I was taken there to celebrate my 20th Birthday.
They wished me with a Margarita and played some Birthday song and tbh, I loved their welcoming!

There you can play pool also.
I spent the entire evening there and came with a smile in my face.
Though I went there once and more than a year ago, I still remember it pretty well. :)

One of the best cafes I have visited in town! Great ambience! Good music always plays on! Live screens are around! Food is surely a tryout! The pool room is great! And its great for a hangout! If you are looking to spend 2-3 hours with friends with shisha and good food try this out! It is not a disappointment! Above all the price is reasonable very reasonable!

Second time ordering from here and this restuarant doesnt fail. Prompt service. Within 45 mins food was delivered. And the food taste was yummy! U can ask them to make it accordingly to your choice ie. Spicy. I ordered chicken in Hong Kong style,  6 pieces of chicken ; cooked nicely in a thick gravy full of capscisums, onions and cashews. Veg fried rice was also good. Sufficient enough for 1 person. Pretty good place. Love the service.  value for food and value for money too. Definite place to go to if dont want to spend too much money and still have plenty to eat and choose from.  And everything ends with a 9 in the price list! Cloud 9! :)

It's a good place to hang around with friends with a pool table to play and a large screen to view games. The food though is average. It's a hookah bar. The decor with neon lights is above average.

It was Dussera Night this year. Went their late night around 1 am to this new exotic opening at the Chinar Park Crossing just above Aminia on the third floor. It was a dim dim light place where people were all around the corner having their fun times with the Hukka and food with drinks.
Its quite spacious place and very well made decor and interiors which the youngsters will like for sure. Comfortable sofa sitting arrangements with a big screen playing the hit numbers.
They have also got a pool table which you can play @100/- per 45 minutes. 
After a complete dinner We were just there for the Pool and Hukka so didnt tried the food, hope to try it next time.

We ordered ice tea which was not available and gave us some lime soda which was not quite upto the mark.There were 2 Customers and when asked to change the music which was pain to our ears. They said the other customer wants this which means we were not considered as customers.

The manager of this place  don't know how to behave with customers we called him to have  a conversation regarding menu but he took the menu out from my brothers hand and folded it when my brother asked him to wait he said ek min ruk in a very  rough tone upon asking him what is this?  He started  argument with  us and that was very bad..  The hooked  served to us was the worst one i had probably in town. The food quality and quantity was really  horrible..  I suggest  ppl not to visit the place any day weather it is the last place in world...

Our order comprised of CLOUD 9 SPECIAL VEG PIZZA, CLOUD 9 SPECIAL FRIED RICE, CLOUD 9 SPECIAL NOODLES, CHILLI CHICKEN. each of them were equally delicious . The hookah they make are praiseworthy too .Even the staffs were so well behaved. It was an wonderful experience from my side.

Location : Chinar Park. Aminia building, 3rd floor. 

Ambiance: Dimly lit, neon ceiling lights, comfortable leather couches, spacious and apt for hookah. You have couches and mini divans to choose from. Good bouncy music, just what goes with the mood in a hookah bar. 

Food: We had ordered the combo for 2 which is very reasonably priced at Rs. 399. It includes any shisha you like with one coal change, momos (veg/non veg), noodles (veg/non veg), Manchurian (veg/non veg) and 2 mocktails (blue lagoon). 

The mocktails were really good and chilled. We had ordered brain freezer for shisha which on our insistence was made strong. The momos were what I loved, soft and spicy. The Hakka noodles were very well tossed in the spices and rightly cooked. The Manchurian was the only thing that was a bit out of the match, the Manchurian balls were pretty dry and the gravy was too sweet. But then, compared to what you are paying , every penny is worth it. 

Would definitely recommend visiting this parlour.

It was good experience as I went there for the first time. We were there around 12 p.m and no other customers were there but from the first step to the restaurant the servers always helped us with anything we wanted. We ordered cloud 9 special hookah with drums of heaven and chefs special pizza (non veg ). Hookah was strong as we wanted it to be :) drums of heaven was yummy and pizza was nice :) if I have to complain about one thing that would be music..they play it way too much loud . other than that its a nice place to hangout :)
P.S - Just ask for the password of WiFi and they will give it you .

They had given, mix sauce pasta, three different flavors of mocktails, grilled sandwich ( room temperature), momo ( not at all worth), French fries, in desert it was chocoball. Staffs were helpful and welcoming. Lift facility is available. Parking also there. Need improvement, to attend properly with the customers, food. Crowd was just okay.

I took a deal from nearbuy for this place. The place is spacious. The ambience was a bit shaddy and the food was decent. But the disappointing part was that the manager had no clue on what was on the deal and upon confirming with him along with the details, the manager simply said that he was not aware of it and when I asked for the dessert mentioned in the deal, the waiter purposely said that it would take more than 40mins. I still insisted on placing the order and the manager bluntly said to the waiter in front of me to place the order in kitchen and serve it after 40mins. I decided to leave the order because of the attitude of the manager. They didn't even want to turn on the AC.

They took a really long time to serve food ( ordered partha, fried rice & one prawn, one mutton side dish). The quality of mutton was not good to be more precise it was not properly boiled. They provide lot of flavours for hookahs. May be will try that there sometime but not meal for sure.

And specially the manager is very at all sensible and is very rude.
Dont visit this place to waste your time and money.

A nice place to hangout with friends. The hookah is good. The food is quite good. The only con they play a very bad playlist. The gaming zone requires improvement.

First visit and needless to say I'm so impressed with this place. As the lift wasn't working me and my friend climbed up to 3 floors the place is very huge with spacious sofas and there was kinda floor a bit lifted where a lot of people can sit together. We got a sofa. The staff attending us was so nice polite he knew what he was doing unless the untrained waiters of other places he recommended us to take a combo which offered a sisha of our choice two soft drinks one side dish and a main all comes in 1000/-. Which was pretty good. Starts with the sisha we ordered ice based and paan flavour. Side dish was chicken teriyaki a good one indeed then came our chicken sizzler it had rice, french fries, chicken wrapped with some stuffing and vegetables. It was nothing high fi just a decent dish. Then the attending stuff got us a cocktail and best part was it was on the house I'm really impressed with the people here very good behavior decent attitude and most importantly they knew their job. Most definitely would be going soon for my next visit. Highly recommended.

Nice place to have hookah with your buddies. we tried their combo on which we were given 10% discount 😎😎,the hookah was perfect not too strong nor too mild,the crispy chicken and chicken drumsticks were tasty though the kabab platter was average. Staffs were cordial and helpful,good service. Do visit it guys and try their combo meal with hookah,cold drinks,crispy chicken,chicken drumstick and pizza/chicken kabab.

Best hookah place ever I had visited in my life. The king of all hookah bars. Truely unspeakable accommodation. Music was just rocking and the hookah was the best hookah. A perfect place for hangout with your bae or friends group in that place. Hats off cloud 9 for this accommodation..

Nice place, good ambience, decent food..... Only problem was we were only there for a little over half an hour and it was only 9pm but they kept shoving d bill on our face and asking whether we are done with the food... So had to leave early than intended and could not even finish half of d hookah.. But will definitely visit again... Maybe a bit early :\

I had heard about cloud 9 frm my cousins bt there critics about this place were not good..The reason being it's crowd..since its located in the utmost suburbs of the city it definitely attracts all types of crowd..even the unwanted lots who makes us feel uncomfortable..
Apart from that the place is good..just on the floor above to selfie latte..The music was too loud and we had to ask the staff some 10 times to reduce the volume..The shisha was properly made and then when askd for the coal change it took them some exact 10minute to reach our table that too when we reminded them..The staffs are highly callous n irresponsible...They looked some local guys dressed up in a staffs attire..They need to be trained properly..overall the drinks n food was just average for me..
Ambience n seating arrangements were the only a 'thumbs up'👍 thing for me..
Hope they pay attention to my review and bring modifications till my next visit..

Went today with friends. Recently opened. Amazing ambience. Great place to hang out at. Good music. Love the quality of food. Service is pretty fast. Behaviour of the staffs is good. The best part of the place is pool *-* I'm going to recommend this place to all my friends.
