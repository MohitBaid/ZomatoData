The most popular food joint in the area never seems to disappoint. Recently I tasted their Dragoon Chicken and their most popular Chicken Steam Momo. Dragon chicken was outstanding in taste, not too spicy as it looked plenty of shredded chicken with kaju and other stuff a mind-soothing dish. Chicken Steam Momo it is still as tasty as before. On an other note, they should make the sitting arrangement a bit neater and cleaner.

Not sure about the hygiene. But recently it has got some over hyped crowd in the making. A nice plan for some evening snacks.

This famous small joint is mainly a theque for college students. Self service, pocket friendly outlet. Nothing can beat their juicy fried momos. Another favorite is the dragon chicken. Newest addition to the list is chicken cheese Fhaley. Thukpa is also good. Actually denzong is creating magic in their every dishes and been a savior of my immense love for momos for last 3years. ❤️

Good food isn't ideally proportional to the money you're spending, in some cases it is, and in others you end up being in Denzong Kitchen. From the first impression, your expensive restuarant wooing eyes might feel bad because this place has interiors that are slightly better than very bad. But the food, oh man. For a little under 200Rs, 180 to be precise, two people can easily indulge in food that would be so much for them, it'll be hard to take a walk home. 
We had the chicken steamed momo and the chicken thukpa and both were really good. The Thukpa could've been better but for 60Rs, you can't really argue. It had a good amount of spice, hotness you need in chilly days and good enough cleanliness. Then came the chicken momos and they were amazing. From the amount of fillings, to the great sizes, momos were great. Had a bad experience of eating them straight away and burning my tongue but that was entirely my fault. Overall a great pocket friendly place to grab a meal that won't hurt your wallet, neither your heart.

This is the best place for momos. The momo dip preparation is its speciality and extremely spicy which makes it everyone's favourite. Chilli garlic noodles are also delicious. Prices are really low making it a place where you can drop in even when you are kind of broke. Overall a thumbs up to this joint.

A famous street joint for quick bites especially momos and not a fancy place.Tried my 1st time here.
We came here by the fame of it's momo and that it could give a tough competition to famous momo centres with a less pocket pinch.
It proved us right by the amazing Pan fried chicken momo which we ordered twice instead of being heavy.Chicken shapta was among another delicacies alongwith its crispness and large quantity.And had chicken schezwan noodles though tastes yum but bit hot and chilly.
Had a wonderful supper but the ambience inside made me reduce 0.5 rating.

My favorite been Chicken Momo and Chicken Fhaley. Thukpa is amazing in the winters and the sauce they served is hot and spicy. 

If you ever get to visit this place, go empty stomach because one plate of momo won't be enough.

Tibetan Delight at Denzong Kitchen

On the alleys of Bijoygarh, Kolkata is a small shop by the name of Denzong Kitchen. The kitchen specializes in Tibetan delicacies (actually the cuisines adjoining Darjeeling district). Having heard about this place a lot from my friends, I decided to take a sneak-peek into it. I ordered the traditional chicken momo as a sample. It took 20 minutes for the steaming hot plate of dumplings to arrive. It was a delight to see the beauties all drenched in a fluorescent orange chutney. As I took my first bite, the momo burst like a balloon spurting out a concoction of oil and water sheathed by the thin film of dough. The layer of dough was thin; a trademark of a good momo. The meat was tender and the chutney had a sting to it. The heat was overwhelming enough for me that I started perspiring.

Next I ordered a bowl of thukpa; a tradition Tibetan noodles.It had a thick texture and the broth was flavorful and soothing. The meat added was similar to that present in the dumplings. I was missing the sting from the chutney so I added a spoonful of the red sauce. This time it was a measured approach. At the first glance the quantity can be overwhelming but I managed to run it down with ease. Like the momo, the hearty bowl of noodles generates enough heat for one to get all soggy. Finally I had a shafale, a deep fried patty filled with meat (again the same composition used in momo and thukpa). The crispy texture went well with the stuffing inside.

With many new momo joints opening up in Kolkata, Denzong Kitchen has been able to establish itself as a brand. I have heard that it has opened up several outlets across the city. The price charged is very reasonable and the food can be considered appetizing. I saw other people order different variants of the momo and other types of noodles which I would like to try in my next encounter.

Went hunting for this place and found it hidden in a residential area.. A little difficult to find but nevertheless found it.. Its mostly a take away so we stood outside and waited for the food.. Tried their chicken taipao and it was worth it.. Fresh and soft bread with a filling of chicken mince n boiled egg.. Its a really huge one and for 60 rs its a good deal.. I couldnt finish it there.. Next time will be prepared to bring it home..
And it has the best silkiest noodles i hve evet tasted...

One of the most popular places to get good momos in South Kolkata, this is located in Bikramgarh. One will always find this place full of people thanks to good food and reasonable prices. My all time favourite from this place has to be Momo. Apart from that the meatballs,thukpa and fhaley are also tasty. The interior is okay and the service is quite prompt. I always prefer this place for a quick bite.

Located in Jadavpur, one of the most affordable restaurant to fill your tummy. This restaurant serves only Chinese and thai cuisine. The interior and staffs are very casual. There is no music and sitting arrangement is little conjugated. One thing which I don't like about the restaurant is the management of staffs. We have ordered something and they have served something else. Also you can't pay by card. Otherwise this restaurant is great if u want good food at minimal cost.

They have a unique technique for preparing the momo. Both the steam and pan-fried momos are worth trying. I also like their Dragon chicken. A perfect hangout place for youngsters. If you love momo, I highly recommend you to try this place if you haven't yet. :)

So, anyone who knows me knows what a momo lover I am! My quest for the best has taken me to so many food joints specialising in this Tibetan delicacy but not very many of them have been able to blow my mind. 
Denzong Kitchen is no frills, just lip smacking food. 
I have tried their steamed, pan fried and fried chicken momos- each variety is amazingly flavourful and juicy. The steamed momos are a clear winner with every bite into it causing an explosion of buttery goodness in your mouth. The sauce they give with it everytime is a bit inconsistent but fiery good nonetheless. Totally worth the money.
Just a suggestion- the chicken filling at times appears a bit pink. Needs a tad bit more time in the steamer.
Thukpas are wholesome with plenty of chicken chunks- my second favourite at the joint.
Dragon chicken, chili chicken are tasty preparations too. 

4.5 for the amazing food. Easy on the pocket n oh so tasty!!

One of the best munching places in jadavpur area. Though their seating arrangement is not at all organised and most of the people have their food standing outside the outlet, but then this is how we enjoy the streat foods right? We had heard a lot about and thus ordered panfried momo, schezwan noodles and dragon chicken. It was yumm 😋. All the items were spicy enough to make u cry and delicious enough to not let you stop eating. Though, from health point of view,  I'll not recommend to have momos at denzong very often,as they are very very oily, but other dishes are highly recommended. No tax, hence pocket friendly, making the place an absolute addiction

Any momo lover in Kolkata will swear by the momos of Denzong. This being the oldest branch of the shop, undoubtedly serves the best food. We ordered steamed chicken momos and dry chilli chicken priced at 50 and 100 respectively. Extremely pocket friendly place with an environment where you wouldn't mind to wait for your turn sit in tsmall room or stand and eat. ( Yeah, a reality and it happens quite often).

Denzong kitchen brings a lot of memories. As a student of Jadavpur University, I had a chance to witness this place to rise from a street side food stall to one of the prime choice of the Momo lovers of the city.
Denzong has two outlets. Any auto from Jadavpur 8B will drop you in front of the alley that leads to this small nano-joint near golf green. The dine in is almost non existent with merely 4 tables at a place which looks more of an abandoned garage than a dining area. So do help yourself with savoury dishes if you have no problem standing by the calm neighborhood with your mates, or simply pack an take away. Most of the staffs are friendly nepali young adults.
They serve both Tibetan and Chinese. Momo, Thukpa Gyathuk, Fhale, meat balls and many more dishes come out of Denzong's sleeves to make sure their customer is happy with the hospitality. Momo doughs are extremely soft. They burst out incredibly tasty juices on the first bite. The filling inside it properly season on every visit with out amy deviation. Apart from the regular steamed momo, pan fried momo and dry chicken (chilli / garlic) are my personal favorite. The noodles are tasty but it some what subsided by its brothy brother Thukpa. Moreover, they never burn a hole in your pocket.
Worth multiple visits for n-th number of times.
Highly recommended for everything available on the menu.

If you’re out for food and not the grandeur, and you’re on a low budget as well, Denzong should definitely be on your list! Serves scrumptious food, quantity is R E A L L Y impressive. Only reason for giving 4 stars is the seating arrangement. It’s like a really small coop, but that’ll bother you only if it’s a hot day.

Undoubtedly the best momo joint ever. 
This was my first visit to this place and I absolutely loved it! 
The Place is highly unhygienic but then it's Street food which we need to keep in mind! 😂 
Steamed momo is the main attraction here, with every bite you take, the juice will burst into your mouth! It's made with such perfection and much chicken filling ! Tastes delicious! 
Me and my friend had three whole plates of it, without any shame, it's that delicious! 
Later we ordered dry chilli chicken and vegetable fried rice! 
Both tasted great. Dry chilli chicken needs special mention, again! 
Place is small with limited seating, one needs to wait for atleast sometime to get a seat! But the wait is totally worth it. Service is prompt and this place doesn't levy tax! :) 
Would love to visit again! :)

Is it me or everyone in Kolkata loves this place.? .. I have just one word to sum this place up.... wait for it.........  " momos".  The best momos ever still trying to figure out how the momos there are so juicy?  Please give up, some secrets are better not revealed. Stating the location to this place seems almost blasphemous giving the fact everyone knows this place.. But still being a good guy that I am let me help you.....Google map it.. 
Though I want to mention In summers the place is quite hot and the eating experience goes down a little but then the momos make up for it.. 
I just realised I said momos like three times already lets talk about the thukpa.. The broth to die for the shredded chicken and veggies so yummy and so light.. I can have bowl full of it and feel so healthy. 
Other dishes which I would recommend are dragon chicken and noodles if you are really hungry.  All in all please do yourself a favour and visit this place.

Denzong Kitchen is one of the most popular places among students in South Kolkata. The Jadavpur branch of Denzong which is located in Bikramgarh is frequented by almost every student in this area during their school or college days. This was my fifth visit to this place and I have tasted nearly all of their dishes which are delicious and cheap to say the least. On this visit we decided to have Veg Hakka Noodles along with Denzong Special Dragon Chicken. Having made the painful decision to not have momo in Denzong for the first time, we were later delighted with our choice. The noodles was well complemented with the dragon chicken dish which had a sweet tinge to it and had adequate quantity. Surely, this won't be our last visit to Denzong as it is a very integral part of my college life. The backup to every plan when there is a cash crunch!

Momo you make is your exceptional style which is unmatchable. When you put a piece of Momo and give a bite... A certain kind of juice makes you mouth flattered with a magic. I don't know why this magical thing  happens but it only happens when it is Denzong. I staring 5 just because I love the way you serve and ur friendly staffs.

I was very much disappointed with the quality of food and taste in my last visit, last saturday as far I can recall. Denzong in his early days was quite decent with very pocket friendly rate. But last time we had a horrible experience.. that schezwan rice was uncooked and hard. Dry chilli chickn was not at all tender and soft. Mixed chowmein was not at all tasty. Very disappointing....

This is the place which serves great momos at affordable prices. Initially many wouldn't find the momos tasty. I would say it's an acquired taste. The chilli garlic noodles is great and so is the fhaley.However, the chicken side dish is not upto the mark. The chicken is stiff mostly.  If you want to have Chinese at cheap rates this place should definitely top your list in South Kolkata. I wish they expand their business and do not compromise on the quality.

The momo will touch your heart. Screw wow momo and all others. A must try place for momo. Only thing is they need to upgrade the sitting arrangements asap.

Basically there is no need for this review because people know how good denzong is. If you are new in the town and have got no idea about this place probably you will not like it. But let me tell you that appearance is really deceptive at times. A couple of years ago, I first went to this place and had Chinese food. I had had hakka noodles with a side dish of chilli chicken. The food was awesome. Again I revisted denzong a couple of months ago and had chicken steam momo and chicken thukpa. I loved the thukpa. But the momos were not as good as I expected. I hope that the momos get better. Cheers to the team. And ofcourse I will revisit.

If one wants to experience the taste of authentic traditional momos it's the best place.. Moreover the pocket friendly price makes it a place to visit..Though ambience and presentation is on the negative side but it gets overlooked by the taste of food.. :)

If you are missing hills and want a plate of hot pipping momos, this is the place for you. Succulent and tasty momos at a reasonable price. Even their thukpa is great. Been a fan of both their outlets at Bikramgarh and Golf Green. Must visit for Tibetan food lover.

Chicken Steamed momos.
If you have ever been to Nepal and have tried local dimsums there,then you can relate to that taste with the momos of Denzong.
Please Remember,DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.
The Nepali guys working here are always busy as they always have a huge pressure.
Highly unheiginic,exactly.please note this.
Its nothing but a fast food.
But they do taste good,and highly economical.
So guys,dont get confused.
Just visit 1nce or order 1nce for their momos.

Denzong - A place famous for pocket friendly momo's.
=====
Intro:

I had ordered for a home delivery at one of my friend's place in Bikramgarh Area. I had been hearing a lot about Denzong Momo's and finally, i gave it a try. 
=====
What i had:

• Dragon Chicken - The gravy was tasting great and the chicken pieces were succulent. However, it was tad bit oily. 
 
• Chicken Steamed Momo - The momo were nice. However, it was not like a wow factor. But yes, at the price at which they are serving, they are really doing a good job. 
=====
Meal for two: 150- 400 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Pros:

• Tasty food.

• Pocket Friendly.

Cons:

• Hygiene is a bit of a factor.
=====
Summary: 

Presentation 3.3/5

Taste 3.8/5

Quality 3.6/5

Quantity 3.7/5

VFM 3.6/5
=====
Conclusion:

I had a decent experience here. If i am low on pocket, this is surely the right place to enjoy momo and indo chinese food.
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

Its a place filled with people mostly north Indians... Hardly place to stand so forget sitting.
We ordered 
∆Chicken Hakka noodles:- pretty awesome with full of chicken and veggies tastes really good
∆2 Pan fried chicken momo:-it had only taste of ketchup and 
I an no so impressed with their Pan fried chicken momo, my expectations were really high and definitely different from what we had
P.S:- the MOMO size was too small, just a size of a rasgulla 😂😂

Food was okayish. It doesn't serve the best momos in town . It's normal tasted . Though gaytuk that we had was tasty. The place is not for seating arrangement ambience isn't good at all . We had a great difficulty to find it. It doesn't have even AC . Good for home delivery not for a reastaurant get up. 🙂

Best momo place ever, been here umpteenth number of times to make my soul happy by devouring the momos.
 If you don't see yourself falling more for the gimmicky momos of Wow Momo and other places like that and love every bite of authentic momo, this place is for you.
Not only the momos, be it fried or steamed are excellent, the dishes worth trying are thukpa, dragon chicken and the shapta to name a few.
You'll see the oil oozing out of the juicy momos after the first bite. The soup served with the momos is really bland so I'd suggest avoiding it.
The dragon chicken is spicy AF and the flavors will titillate your senses.
Now there's always two sides to the coin. 
Here the bad side being the hygiene and the seating arrangements.
The place is not spotless or clean, calling it shabby is like a compliment.
Seating options are also scarce and I've found myself eating while standing on the sidewalk when the seats inside are full.
But when you find excellent food for reasonable price, you stop wondering the cons and focus on the food.
This joint is the oldest joint of DK and it serves the best food when compared to other branches IMHO.
Try it out once and you'll never regret.

I think it's impossible to count the countless number of times I have visited here since it's inception and everytime I am here I need to have a steamed momo. Along with that have tried their fried momo, meat balls, noodles and shyapta which is also included in my favourite list. Location was a bit odd but their momos became so famous that people came here finding there way. Now it has become a sort of landmark. Ask anyone about Denzong or Sourab er momo you will understand what I am talking about....

Only momos are good.. Other items taste very bad especially meatballs. Thukpa is also average. Momos are to die for but I hope they try to improve the quality of other items as well. 
P. S. I think they use stale momos for fried momos because it tastes a bit bitter.

However, the thukpa was horrible,it was like they just give us boiled noodle with minced chicken...But,to sum up,it is a pocket-friendly place for a chit-chat evening over a plate of momo with friends...

We'll, this place might not look appealing when u see it at first. But after going in and smelling that soothing  smell of Momos being fried and garlic sauce etc etc, you will surely not be able to Keep your hunter under control!!! This is a great place in the back of south City, just a short walk from Lord's more; a place where you can get Quality and Quantity Chinese and Tibetan meal at an amazingly low price. 

I ordered Fried Momos in Garlic sauce, Egg Fried rice and Chilli Chicken. From the service point of view, the people here are cool I must say. As far as the cooking and the taste of food is concerned, This place is a jewel. That "more-than-perfect" Cooked momo Will surely Melt your heart and the spicy Chilli Chicken will surely play games with your taste buds. A must visit if you want Good Chinese at low cost.

It's one of my favorite place to have Tibetan food!! Momo's are really best here. In one sentence"cheap and best".. The only problem is the accommodation, but one can really compromise or ignore this negative point. I have been visiting this place for many years. I would recommend everyone to taste all the different dishes in the menu card. It's location is also quite easy because of jadavpur tollygunge metro autos. U need to tell the autowalas "denzong r goli", ND u can easily locate. I love the Momos cause they are really juicy ND tasty. U really don't need to think about budget while enjoying the delicacies..😊😊😊

This is my go to places. I almsot visit this place twice a week.
Well being around my house, this place is kinda close to my heart.
A small joint but enough to leave other big ones behind.
The mentionables are Phaley , Shyapta, Momo.
But the star performer for this place according to me is Dragon chicken. I love this specifically.
The most pocket friendly as it can be.
With no doubts what so ever this place gets a 'must visit" tag.

Visited this outlet of Denzong multiple times. I have been here specially for their juicy steam momos, Tai paos and phaleys.

Denzong's momos are literally a craze among us youths because of its quality and quantity at such a price.
Delicious momos filled with chicken and veggies, served with hot chilli garlic sauce is absolutely finger licking good.
Being almost a regular visitor for the last few years, i felt that their quality has gone down with the increase in the price of their dishes. The juiciness and the moist texture of the momos went missing this time.
Nevertheless i would highly recommend their
1) STEAM MOMOS
2) CHICKEN PAN FRIED MOMOS
3) CHICKEN PHALEY AND
4) CHICKEN TAI PAOS as these dishes are great as per their price..

Denzong's momos are literally a craze among us youths because of its quality and quantity at such a price.
Delicious momos filled with chicken and veggies, served with hot chilli garlic sauce is absolutely finger licking good.
Being almost a regular visitor for the last few years, i felt that their quality has gone down with the increase in the price of their dishes. The juiciness and the moist texture of the momos went missing this time.
Nevertheless i would highly recommend their
1) STEAM MOMOS
2) CHICKEN PAN FRIED MOMOS
3) CHICKEN PHALEY AND
4) CHICKEN TAI PAOS as these dishes are great as per their price..

Don't think twice, just go and grab a plate of steam momos. Believe me- they're simply delectable. They've possibly the best momos in town. The steam momos are a must-try. Moreover they're shit-cheap. You cannot get enough of these. The place is small and shabby but the food steals the show. *_*

I love momo so much that I can have them.at any hour of the day and by far no place servers momo better than this place and also it is the cheapest. I have tried the chowmein and dragon chicken and thukpa and they are good as well. But hands down this place serves the best momo in Kolkata.

Decent food at decent price. Previously it was a takeaway counter but recently they upgraded themselves. They got a sitting arrangement though that's too small and stuffy. Anyway, the food they serve will compensate all these nick-nacks. The momo is the best one here. You can try the thukpa, schezwan noodles, hakka noodles, faley, tie pao, etc. We tried the dry chilli chicken. That's awesome too!

One of my favourite joints that is located in Bikramgarh and I never get tired of visiting it again and again. They serve the most succulent and delicious steamed momos. Probably the best in town. The noodles and chicken dishes tastes equally good. There's not much space to settle down, relax and eat but one doesn't really care when the food is SO good and it is totally value for money. Nevertheless, I will visit soon again. :)

A small crowded shop in the heart of Jadavpur and house to one of the best momos in the city. The production line is simply mesmerizing to watch. Batches of momos going into the steamer and being sold off in no time. They also offer different continental dishes and all of their food retains the authenticity and will definitely impress you. Prices and moderately low make it a perfect value for money place. Doesn't have the option to sit and eat and during the summers might be a little too hot to stand and eat. Will recommend a pick up. Overall a good place.

I am a die-hard momo fan. Hence also a little sceptic about trying out at new places just so that I don't start hating momos for life. With such sceptic thoughts I had visited their Vikramgarh outlet. But I was taken aback first by the number of people waiting even on a humid afternoon to eat momos and second by the taste of the momo itself. AMAZING is the word. I have also been to their Bijoygarh outlet, which is equally good. Momos are a must try!

A wonderful restaurant indeed ! Chinese delicacies served at such an affordable price and the quality being extremely good it's one of the best places to hangout at a low budget . We were a group of three today and we ordered chicken momos  and chicken hakka noodles all of which deserve an excellent remark.

The lip-smacking 'momos' are their speciality ...

-0.5 because of the small and dingy space inside.

The prices are affordable and the food moderately good. But their service is terrible. What is most astonishing is that they take 25% for taxes. I paid Rs 50 extra on a Rs 200 order. On top of that they did not provide a printed bill. Instead a badly torn piece of paper with illegible writting was given to us.

Had a horrible experience. We  ordered for 4 Chicken Steam Momo, Four Fhaleys and one Thukpa by Home delivery. At first the delivery boy came very late only with the momos, that too without the soup. Then he apologized and took another 30 minutes and came back with 3 Fhaleys and Soups and no Thukpa. The Momos were so tasteless and dry, They  tasted like  momos from a roadside shack! The Fhaley was also so shitty that we couldn't even finish it. Didn't feel like it was from Denzong!

Yeah, the momos are great but their seating arrangement is so bad. I tried fried rice and chili chicken too, it tasted very bad. I was initially wondering if I came to the correct Dengzong that my friends suggested me. If you want to take away the momos, then its okay otherwise not a place for chilling out with your friends. 
I'm never gonna go back there. I'd rather go to the Hazra outlet which is much better than this untidy place.

This famous momo place serves you with the best momos in town. The juicy momos both steamed and fried makes you order more and eat beyond your capacity. I have lost count on how many times I have visited this place.
There are three to four tables but everyone chooses to have their momos outside. You can go with your friends or family. It's always a great hangout place for youngsters. Gulp down juicy momos and talk your heart out, what else do you need. I have been visiting this outlet since years and never got bored of it. They have their own technique of preparing the momos and the sauce they serve it with is very good. I love the soup as well. If you haven't visited this place, then the next thing you should do is definitely visit this momo place.

Well..we don't mind the space when we are hungry...right? Ordered chicken shya fahley, chicken shyapta. Fahley was cold so couldn't enjoy it but chicken shyapta was delicious and spicy. Loved the food.

A great choice for Tibetan street food in Kolkata! We ordered steamed momos, shyapta, noodles and fried rice. I've never tasted more juicier momos like this before and it was the first time I tried shyapta... It's not chilly chicken as my cousin explained before ordering and he was right! It's better than chilly chicken. The noodles and fried rice were average but I was already floored with the momos and the shyapta. The outlet is really small and not very clean but then who cares for these aspects when you're craving for street food!!

Famous food joint ...popular among college students. Don't go with the looks...it's just 12-15 peoples seating arrangment. Place is bit shabby and usually remain crowded. Recently many outlets they have opened in the other areas of south kolkata.
If u want to try authentic chinese or tibetian food...this food joint you simply can't miss anyway.
There momo is famous as it has enough fillings in it and juicy as well.
Fried chicken...noodles...Shyapta...Shya fhaley ...all these are nice too...good place to hangout with group of friends.
Would love to visit to try there other items as well.
Pocket pinch is very cheap and quantity they serve is good enough too.

A nice place for college students but if you are interested in food then inly go.

The interior is not soo fancy.

The momo at rs 50 was good but size was too small. 

Overall a nice place only a little hard to find.

Best is take a rickshaw from south city mall and ask them to denzong they will charge rs40 and you will reach.

Had heard a lot about this place from friends and so wanted to try it for a long time.But after paying it a visit myself,,I realised that the hype was so FALSE! Absolutely nothing is good about this place..We had Chicken pan fried momo and Chicken thukpa.Did not like the taste of the thukpa..the noodles in it were tasteless and so was the soup..had very few pieces of chicken.The pan fried momo was good but the outer covering was so hard that it was difficult to tear it.Ambience was bad as expected but service was also not satisfactory.. We had to wait for half n hour for the pan fried momo.The only good thing is that prices are cheap and inclusive of VAT.Definitely not going back.

Having heard a lot about this place of serving extremely delicious momos, we thought of dropping in at this outlet of Denzong. But, surprisingly...the momos weren't even half as good as I expected. Honestly, being a momo lover, I have had FAR better momos than this at the exact same rate.
The momos were smaller than usual, also their fried momos were kinda hard..as I couldn't break them with the plastic fork they provided, and the sauce tasted pretty weird. Also, the soup was tasteless.
So, although I had huge expectations from this place..couldn't really gather a good experience out here.

An auto from either Jadavpur 8B or Tollygunge metro will take you to Bikramgarh. After getting off, just ask around.
Limited Tibetan-Chinese menu. Very cheap prices.
Momos are amazing! They are definitely highly, highly recommended. 
But their Thukpa is quite runny. It's just boiled Maggi noodles in chicken broth and a lot of coriander and chicken mince. And I had found a hair in mine so I couldn't eat it. 
Chicken balls are fine. 
Extremely unhygienic. So if you are finicky about that, this is not your stop. Otherwise, if you love momos, do visit. 
PS: they have a stall near 5 number JU gate, which is easier to locate, and has pretty good items too. Especially their garlic chicken noodles/rice and momo. I would have given 3 but increased for the stall has been a saviour during many a hungry lunch breaks.

Didn't satisfied as much as i heard about this place. We ordered 'Fried momo' which tastes so bad that I couldn't even finish the plate. But the 'ambience' was 'good' and can be visited if you are in group of friends. Price was also 'pocket friendly'. But the place seemed to b 'below than average' to me.😑

my first visit  at the jadavpur branch of Denzong made me happy. is a pocket friendly delicacy! I don't know about the other branches but this one should arrange at least a basin for hand wash! apart from the lack of space, the restaurant doesn't have fire extinguishing measurements! overall it's good!

Low on budget? Come to Denzong

Treat you classmates? Come to Denzong.

Yes, thats it..its cheap, serves a lot, tastes decent and value for money. Nothing else, do not fall for the great food trap..its just plain jane. 

My rating is based on a comparison amongst other roadside joints. Thank You.

My friends took me there, though at 1st I thought where the hell are they taking me but they explained that 'Denzong' will be the best momo ill ever eat. When I tried at 1st i thought it was different i tried some more and liked it . The momos here are buttery. You can feel and taste the butter .But after sometime it somehow didnt go well as my breakfast, the aftertaste made me vomit . So in my opinion it wasnt a bad meal ,it was hygienic enough, yum ... but I wont suggest you try it in empty stomach . Have some other food somewhere after that you can enjoy it here.

After hearing so much about it decided to try this place with my friends. The food we ordered were- steam chicken momo , pan fried chicken momo , chicken fried rice and garlic chicken. The food was good , except the garlic chicken which seemed tasteless. The main problem with this restaurant is space crunch. The place is too tiny.

Atlast visited denzong! I have heard so much about the place that I couldn't wait to visit there. Food is tasty and very much pocket friendly; but the place is not so good. Small space and not clean enough. Ordered chicken steam momo,mixed chowmin,chicken tie pao. The momo was very tasty and so as the chowmin. Chicken tie pao was not so tasty. Overall good. One of the best place for momo lovers.

I used be a regular here even an year back! 😞
Their steamed juicy Momos that just explode in mouth and release the juices is obviously an absolute favorite of everyone.
If you reach there some afternoon, be prepared to stand in the street for the entire time, or if you're adventurous enough feel free hop on one of those panchils. 😜

I also loved their Tai Pao, Shay fayle, kothey. But for some reason I never really liked their dragon chicken.
And as far as I know they probably renovated the place recently, making that eating area more spacious.

I absolutely miss you, Denzong! 😥

Say Momo and 1st name that pops in my mind is Denzong. The momos are simply yummy, juicy, filled with Chicken and lip-smacking delicious!!! The Thukpa brings immense relief during winters and also if you have caught a bout of cold.  The best part about this outlet is its super pocket-friendly rates. Even if you have only 1 100-rupee note in your pocket, you shall be able to have a sumptuous meal and still save on some money. Given a chance, I would DEFINITELY like to shout out about this place to the world.

Food is affordable and quite honestly, tastes really good.
But generally there's a long queue. There are shops adjacent selling cold beverages. And it's a tad bit tough to find. 
All in all, good momos. And even the chowmein is decent. 
Be aware seating is mostly always full.

 Coming to the food, well this place is heaven for momo lovers. Be it steam,fried ,pan fried everything is tasty and worth drooling for. Dragon Chicken is good too but very spicy. 
Price : Damn cheap
Hygiene: Big zero
Seating : Not spacious, best to take away or stand and eat outside.
Tip: Come before 7.30pm or else stuff gets over.

I am an ardent lover of writing long reviews, but below lies my review of Denzong. 

THE BEST SERVED MOMOS IN TOWN - P. E. R. I. O. D!! Most unabashedly biased about this place and for all the right reasons. One, who has tasted Saurav's momo's will find it most difficult to make his pallet understand that there can be better momos, BECAUSE THERE CANT BE. Do I even remotely need to sum up this review? Haha.

I remember frequenting this place back in college days a few years back. Can't recall having zomato reviews back and it was just word of mouth followed by everyone gathering in flocks to this hidden gem on the 8B - Tollygunge auto route. One friend stayed nearby and he introduced us all to this place. There was no proper seating at that time; probably a few stools kept randomly on the street itself but everyone would happily gorge on the momos and thupkas. It was great!! 
On one particular visit, we saw Soumitro of Bhoomi (it used to be a great craze that time) getting his parcel from this joint...a celebrity thing that time!!

Cheers to the team at Denzong! Would love to visit next time I'm in Kolkata!

This is a strictly takeout food joint, very near to the Jadavpur and Golf green bisection. Quality wise it is much like that special local eatery you swear by, don't go there expecting something outstanding. The price vs quality of the restaurant is pretty good, reason enough for a throng of people to crowd the place in the evening. Another word of caution, because of the rush it takes time for your order to be ready, so if u want a tip, order by phone and venture a bit later to have your order ready in minutes :P
I had ordered Dragon Chicken, Chicken Shapta, Mix Noodles, Mix Fried Rice, Chicken steam momo.
The Shapta and Dragon chicken were good, although I would have appreciated it more if the chicken pieces were less chunky and more finely shredded. The chicken momos are really good with thin outer layer and filled inside. The mix noodles and rice is not exactly mixed, u won't find anything other than egg or chicken and moreover the chicken pieces are again quite big which makes it feel a bit undercooked. I have tried other stuff from here as well everytime had that same sence of disgruntlement at something or the other.
So yeah, good enough place but go there at ur own risk and with less by the way of expectations.

Got inspired with Zomato reviews I finally dropped in. The place is small and takeaway will be best for enjoying what I went in for. Well I am a strict no chilli person and probably this is making me give Denzong an average rating. Ordered Fried Chicken Momo, the service was swift and Momo tasted good. The chilli chutney made me cry still worth mentioning. Chicken Syapta is mentioned as their special item. Ordered this one too(this time parcel). Well it tasted good,but more like completely cooked in chilli sauce. Felt they probably mingled the Syapta recipe with chili chicken recipe.. here I would mention I liked Syapta made by Momo I Am.
This place is worth a try for its low pricing and fast service. Next time I will surely mention them to use less chili in my meal..
#Hope my review help Denzong!!! # Thankyou for the service.

I don't think that I need to really describe the food here. It's loccated just at a moderate 5 minutes distance from the CCD outlet. 
The shop is pretty small with bag full of taste and flavour. 
They are famous for their momos. We took chicken fried momo and Szechwan momo. They were filled with taste! The perfect combo of hot and a hint of sweet. 
I'll recommend this to every momo lover! 
Thank you.

Heard and read lot about this outlet and was supremely interested to try out the momos in particular. So, did that finally on last friday. True to its reputation, steamed chicken momos turned out to be juicy and succulent and quite a mouthful...however, the accompnying fiery red sauce and balnd soup was not to my liking...and the momos were quite laden with oil or is it chicken fat?? (I guess, that is the reason the momos are that juicy...)

This is one of those joints where you don't come for the ambience or décor,but for the quality of food served here. It's pocket friendly and serves lip smacking delicious momos. I have had the fried chicken momo and pan fried chicken momo here. They were simply awesome. Also tasted the thukpa here. I didn't quite take to the taste of that. It was my first time having thukpa so I can't be a good judge of it. It was at best ok to me. Had ordered the Tai Pao too. The idea of the dish was nice and it would have tasted great too,had we not been given one of the stale ones. The bread tasted a bit funny. Overall, must visit place for the momos. I am glad other branches have opened up as this location is not easily accessible to me.

Yes, I can see the place has already got a 4.1 landmark rating but I beg to differ here.
I'll place my opinion with absolute pros and cons and will leave it to you for judging.

PROS : :
• absolutely the cheapest place in town for having Tibetan dishes be it momo, thukpa or else others.
• fast service
• momos are tasty, portion of thukpa is ample.

CONS : :
• location is in an absurd place neither exact tollygunge nor jadavpur, somewhere in the middle.
• tiny shabby place with limited number of sitting arrangements and looks unhygienic as well.
• both steam and pan fried momos are too greasy, oily (literally drops of oil fall off with every bite....yes what you read is absolutely true)
• although thukpa portions is huge in that cost but what's the utilization of it if the thukpa is tasteless? No particular taste in that thukpa...after mixing those table sauces they might be edible.
• that's neither authentic Tibetan nor Sikkimese.

If the ratings are based on vfm I'll be able to give a 4 point as well, but sorry there should be a minimal credibility of authenticity and taste in a particular cuisine of an eatery!

RECOMMENDED ( feel hungry? OK grab a bite) 😋

If you are in Bikramgarh bazaar and you want to eat some awesome food then I'll suggest you Denzong. 50-100 rupees will enough... Just go for it.. Don't judge by its outer look. It may look like just an ordinary road side eatery but the foods are awesome. Momos, thukpa and dragon chicken are my personal favorite...but you can order any of the items on the menu card without any hesitation.

Juiciest momos, one can even think of. Most of the momo outlets in Kolkata stuff their chicken momos with more of onions and less of chicken. This place does not. 

Had to visit the place, with regards to the hype surrounding the place and boy, it stood up to the hype, rather exceeded it handsomely, enough.

The USP of this place is definitely the momos. Jucy momos. And I ordered two of 'em. The dragon chicken was quite good 'nuff.

Did not get a place to sit inside. But it didn't matter of all, since the place was jam packed. And I got mine in no time. 

Price is exceedingly low and quality is exceptionally good. Definitely, a one to look out for Sunday evening cravings.

This place does best what it's meant to do: Serve sinfully delicious food, no questions asked! 

Since this particular branch of Denzong's is just a walk away from my place, I come here often to devour their juicy momos mainly but I also love their shyaptas, thukpas, shya faleys, kotheys, noodles...well, you get the picture. What you must know is, this is not a sit-n-eat joint so you either have to stand while eating or pack your food home. Oh, and they are on Swiggy too.  

If the look of the place doesn't impress you much, don't worry -- just go ahead and order a plate of steamed momos. The melt-in-the-mouth dumplings will make a convert out of you. Honest! 

More points for their unbeatable prices. To sum it up: If you're in South Kolkata and hit by a momo-craving, head straight to Denzong. Thank me later.

Denzong Kitchen is a good place for your evening Chinese and tibetian snacks. Price is also at per that. Food quality, from my point of view is good. Their USP is their momo, which you will always find lip smacking. One may find it to be over hyped but that depends upon your expectation. Looking for good and cheap evening Chinese cuisine in tollyguanj area? Go to Denzong Kitchen.

Little difficult to locate for first timers,  take the lane opposite to Golf Club Road and then follow the lane as it is after crossing a park on the right take the first right.  Students and a few locals are the bulk of the customers. Better to eat outside or parcel. The room inside is small and stuffy. But it is worth it as Momos are the best in town. 
We had 2 plates of Chicken Steam Momos, they were very fresh, soft and extremely tasty. A plate of Chicken steam Momos has 6 pieces for Rs 50,  Chicken Shay Fhaley was fried but not very oily and crisp it was for Rs 30, and a plate of Chicken Thukpa for Rs 50, which was huge and was shared as it was quite filling with chunks of chicken a bit salty but on the whole good.  
Three of us ate and the total bill came to Rs 180. Very pocket friendly for such fresh good food.

Ignore the shabby appearance and you can have the best momos in the city. This place have been popular for quite sometime , specially among students due to their unbelievably cheap food which tastes delicious : a very rare thing indeed. Apart from the momos, the chicken shyapta is worth mentioning. It is a tad too spicy but it is one of the best things you will ever taste. The Chicken Thukpa comes in a very large quantity and it is delicious too. I have also tried their Crispy chicken and the Szechwan friedrice. They serve large juicy chicken pieces and it's yum.The all-time crowd speaks for the popularity itself. I recommend this to everyone.

Food here is terrific! This place has become immensely popular for their yummy hot steamy momos.  Along with that, their noodles and chicken are tasty as well. 

I have tasted Chicken Steamed Momo, Chicken Pan Fried Momo, Chicken Thukpa, Chicken Hakka Noodles,  Chicken Shya Fhaley, Dragon chicken, Chicken Shyapta, Chicken Rice. The noodles, rice and shyapta was  usual and good. The rest were different and delicious; hence recommended. 

The ambience however is really bad. it's tiny and dirty. During summer it becomes more difficult and sweaty.  Plus finding the location for first timers can be tiresome, if it's not known. We roamed a lot before finding out our destination. Suggestion - Auto from Jadavpur 8B can take you to this place. 

Food here is worth those pains. Plus their rates on food is really low! Great destination for college goers and momo lovers.

Finally , yes finally tried their food!! And i must conclude that they are overhyped!! I have heard so much about dezong that i had huge expectation from this food joint, thus famished as i was , i made up my mind to pack a late lunch from here. I ordered chicken steamed momo, chicken gyathuk, veg hakka chow, veg rice and their signature dish "dragon chicken".
Gyathuk -I liked the taste though some might find it a bit flat,. There was enough for two and was infused with chicken chunks.
Veg rice- Totally lack luste and even smelt a little.
Veg hukka chow-Tasted a bit like atta noodles
Dragon Chicken-Infused with cashew nuts , i just loved this dish, which was a bit sweet and had impressive pieces.
Momo- They were absolutely delicious.
All in all a mixed experience and the waiting time was rather long. 
Declaimer- This is preferably a take away joint because if you plan to eat inside there are chances you too will be boiled with the food 😂

At the very famous Denzong to try out the womb of Chinese delicacies...

First and foremost... Chicken Fried Momo... Dont even see the menu and go for it... The stewed chicken juice to go with their own Chili Sauce(You can add cubic power to its hotness!!) will just make you say : STATUTORY WARNING : BEWARE; YOUR TASTEBUDS ARE AT STAKE... 

Next, the Chicken Tie Pao... Was enough to bloat our stomach to half its capacity... but the soft bun wasn't enough to impress my limbic... 

 Now, came the Chicken Shyapta... a Tibetan-style Chicken Curry... Full with Juicy shredded chicken, Capsicum, Coriander and obviously Denzong's HOTTTT CHILLI's all over it... It was an oooooommphhh... 

Lastly, the Chicken Gyathuk... You can say another version of chicken Thukpa... It was average but the soup had it's evidence of chinese origin... 

ALL OF THESE COSTED ONLY Rs. 470 for THREE OF US 

A straight "NOOOOO" for the modern aristrocrats bothered about the bowties and the earlong smiles of the waiters :P

and at the end an advice for the fooadaholics 
coming here : "self help is the best help"

Would be delighted if service becomes bit better...

A little uncomfortable if you sit and eat because of the heat. Difficult to locate but once you reach the given area, you can spot the place easily given the huge crowd surrounding the joint.

This is a late review, but worth it considering their amazing pocket-friendly Tibetan gastronomic tour. Denzong is a name synonymous with momos and they aptly earned their name for their juicy, succulent momos which had a unique touch of their own. Appearances can be deceitful & so it is for Denzong. For what looks like a small shabby take away, they will surprise you with their food & make you come back for more! Extremely economical and great value for money! Steamed chicken momos and chicken shyaptas are a must try!

Denzong Kitchen was an extremely big let down. I was taken there by my friends who spoke very highly of it. I was impressed with the pricing, at how low the rates were. I was also intrigued to see that they served Ghyathuk, Ting-mo, Shafalé and Shaptaks, but unfortunately our first order: a plate of fried chicken momos was a disaster. They served us burnt momos, which were returned. Then they served us fried momos that had a pasta cover as thick and chewy as leather. Our alternate order for a plate of pan-fried momos were also the same. So we decided to leave it there and not order anything else. I'm hoping that if I visit Denzong again I shall find it in a better shape, especially with a larger degree of sincerity to what they decide to serve. They should know that cheap food does not mean bad tasting food. For now I give only a 1.5 score.

This is the student's hang out zone. Get down near the bikramgarh field. And take the lane opposite to it. Walk a minute and you'll find this small food joint on your right hand side.
It's generally crowded. Getting a place to sit will be quite a difficult task. However we squeezed in. We ordered chicken momos. They're lip smacking. The thupka, which lacked salt, but with a pinch of it and some soy sauce, it's definitely enjoyable. Also it comes in a huge bowl loaded with lots of chicken and noodles. Then we ordered the chicken tie pao. It's a big bun with chicken stuffings in between. We also ordered the chicken phaley which was more like a chicken cutlet. Tasted good.
We both were so full that we couldn't even walk. And the bill came around 200 rupees only.
A must visit for all the momo lovers. It's cheap and neat.

Been there with a couple of friends. The place is okayish and is seriously lacking in space. You are good to go if you are fine with eating outside the place, standing or if you plan on a take away. The sitting area is squished and doesn't seat more than 10 people. It lacks basic fan or AC too, so on hot days it's quite easy to get bathed in your own sweat. That the stoves are closer to the seating area doesn't help remove the heat either. 
Coming to the food, we had veg steam momos, veg fried momos and veg hakka noodles. I liked either momos, they were really tasty, but the noodles were okay only. Won't really recommend it unless you are low on money and want to have something to bite at home desperately.

This place has been my all time favourite since my school days. Feeling like reviewing this place today, though the momos doesnt really need a review. Its in bikramgarh, in lanes of the route between jadavpur-tollygunge. While most of us are familiar with the momo joint less people know it has a space for sitting and having momo inside the shop. Steamed and pan-fried momos are best here. Steamed ones are so juicy, literally juices ooze out from each and every momo on your plate with each bite! 
Another must try is chicken shyapta! Juicy succulent shredded boneless pieces prepared with garlic onion tomato sauce flavored with capsicum. If you are a fry lover you can go for chicken shyafley. The prices are unbelievably low and food is hygienic enough not to give you a stomach upset. 
Whenever i have a momo craving i just aim denzong to be my ultimate destination.

Located in the lanes of bikramgarh,don't go by the appearance of this place - just order the classic steam momo and indulge in it.Its a heaven for momo lovers.We went there like a zillion times and tried almost everything on the menu.
Recently there was a price hike but even though this place is pocket friendly.We have particularly liked their chicken steam momo,chicken syah faley,dragon chicken,mixed fired rice,meatball(i think this have deteriorated taste wise),thukpa....
Momo lovers do visit this place if you are nearby jadavpur and you crave for some really good momos.

For all momo lovers, do pay a visit here. Although the place is a little cramped up but it's doable, considering the authentic north eastern taste buds the food can tickle. We ordered chicken steam momo, chicken syah faley, chicken thukpa and pan fried momo. Needless to say they all tasted too good, especially no one could compete with their traditional steam momo. Prices are affordable, infact relatively cheap. So guys, don't think just go and dig in!

First visit today after multiple attempts of coming to this much talked of place failed and i was not disappointed at all. The chicken steamed momo is just wow! But yes, i was a bit disappointed at the taste of the pan fried momo. Unfortunately i could not try any other dishes since i liked the chkn momo so much that i had loads of them. Very much a recommended place for steamed momo but if u wanna try pan fried, i would not suggest this place. Next time i look forward to try their chinese preparations (like the much hyped dragon chkn) and i hope i will have a good experience. :)

Don't just sit back on the momos. Try out the thukpa  and schezwan noodles too. 
The tie pao seemed a bit tasteless. The dough was too thick. 
Cut down one on the rating coz of appearance and the sitting which is stuffy and extremely small. 
Still doesn't stop me for a visit every week though. Great food.

Denzong Kitchen is the ultimate place to visit when you're a college student who is on a tight budget most of the time! The one located in Bikramgarh, near Jadavpur is the first outlet established. It is one rickshaw ride away from both Lords More and Jadavpur 8B bus stand. Ask the rickshaw to take you to Bikramgarh or Bikramgarh Bazar and keep an eye out for a small inlet on one side of the road on your way. It will appear as a small bright red joint, with a rickshaw stand and another wall painted food joint at the junction of the inlet.
The food is brilliant. If you're not the biggest hygiene freak, you must come here for some really authentic Tibetian food, at quite a low price. There is also a small soft drink shop beside, so you can buy a drink there and take it to Denzong for the meal. Seeing how busy this food joint remains on most days, they should consider expanding the little space.
I have come here time and again. Their chicken steamed momos remain an all-time favourite. The chicken Faley is not bad, but it's not as amazing as the momo either. I also love their chicken chowmein and dry chilli chicken.
The place looks most unimpressive at first, but their food absolutely makes up for it.

This small place in the narrow lanes of Bikramgarh is a place i left my heart at the first time i went there! A students' hub mainly which serves you amazing momos, shaptas and what not! Momos are amazing and melt-in-your-mouth-kind. The shaptas, noodles are great too! So if you ever come across this place do not ignore it by thinking of it as just another momo shop. Its the best place in South Calcutta where you find such amazing momos at 40 bucks! 
So keep hogging people!

Tucked inside the bylanes of Jadavpur, off Prince Ghulam Shah Road, within the precincts of Bikramgarh, lies the veritable Solomon's Mines. Denzong's Kitchen. Creating magic over a conveyor belt, well almost, for the hungry spilling all over the place, this place has gained notoriety for its ethereal offerings. From the ubiquitous momo to the humongous portion of thukpa to the more staid rice and noodles, everything on the money tastes different. Awesome would be an understatement. The garlic rice and it's noodle version is a standout performance. Order a dry chilli chicken alongside. Thank me later. The piping hot ensemble melts in the mouth. Prepare to stand and eat holding the plate and dodging passers-by  and vehicle for the eating area is totally outmatched by the sheer numbers that pour in to savour at one of Kolkata's best.
Denzong's Kitchen is an absolute for the gastronome. At Denzong's gluttony is a sin waiting to be exploited. And how.

Do not try anything fancy, order the basics and trust me, you won't be dissapointed. One of the Best Steam Momos in town. The Garlic Noodles are also pretty good. Absolute value for money.
Secondly lets not call this a resturant, its more of a road side eatery, very similar to the ones found at Park St & Esplanade. Yes they have a few tables but that doesn't serve the purpose. You have to swim past an ocean of people just to put your order through. Once you get the order you need to find a cozy place at the side of the road and dig in(since this place is located inside a locality hence traffic is not an issue at all) But once you dig into the food, trust me, its pure bliss.
P.S. The place is absolutely bustling with people every evening. So expect a fairly long service time.

College life days and money was spent on this place. The momos are incredible and so yummmm! That was my first thought when I went there for the first time. If you reach after 7pm on a weekend then rest assured neither will you get a place to stand nor you will be served with hot piping momos. They have opened another outlet near 223 bus stand. Don't know the name of the place.

Momos here are something that you would go for having again and again. The Pan fried momo is deliciously spicy, nicely stuffed with chicken, the sauce is sweet-tangy-spicy, and the best, as it's served hot. The Steamed momo here is soft, well stuffed, delicate, and sooo good to eat. I'm in love with this place. Though it's not that a big food outlet, it will surely give you that homely feeling. Love..

On 30.5.2016 evening took as parcels - 2 plate steamed chicken momo, 1 schezwan/garlic noodles mixed (only chicken no prawns found and non spicy), 1 Chilli chicken (worst sweet flavored i ever had). The way they packed the food was unhygienic in plastic poly-bags directly and didn't forget charging 10bucks for the plastic container. The momos were just so so, hence this place is to be avoided. Couldn't post yesterday as my stomach gave away due to this poisonous noodles+chicken.

Its known for mainly its momo's.. i think their momos are a bit different from the one's that we usually have..cz they are xtrmly juicy sort of n dts mainly bcz of the oil that they use n that is the USP.. Though its a small shabby kind of place but its always crowded by people so i prefer for a takeaway.. its appropriate for quick bite 😊

I am quite picky while choosing a place to eat and most of the time i settle for those which has a good ambience as well as good food...Denzong however had been a happy exception...Want to have one of the best momos in town? Please do visit their place...we had steamed chicken momo...every bite of it was simply amazing! Its not like the usual steamed momo...rather they are kept dipped in the soup ...at the ample price you get really juicy tasty momos that i have never tasted before... However their thupka was kind of okay and fhaley was a bit too oily...if not anything else,a fresh coat of paint and a bit of decoration would really make this place a great place to hang out...even though you can always find yound crowd already there outside at their place...My rating is entirely based on the food they serve and it really deserves more and more publicity...if asked for an overall rating i would give it 3.5 may be...Nevertheless if you haven't visited the place what are you doing?? Do visit them and have a great evening with your friends! :)

Denzong Kitchen has been one of those places which has earned its name with sheer taste of its food. This place serves you some great Tibetan dishes in highly reasonable price. If you go by its looks and don't enter the place you are in the losing side. The momos here are talk of the town and this place attracts crowd from all over the city. This place is one of the most famous places for student. There are other outlets of Denzong but this one was the first one to open. The momos here are heart filling. They are just awesome. I have gone to this place numerous times and I have never been disappointed.

Location:
A very small place in the by lanes of Vikramgarh. Once you reach Lord's more, ask anyone and you will get the direction. Or if you come by Jadavpur 8B, take a rickshaw and you will get your destination. And zomato map is always a good option

Ambience:
A very small place with two sections. And yeah, a third section too. First, the kitchen. Second, a small room where only few tables are there and very less customers can accommodate. And the third section, the place just outside the place where most number of customers enjoy their momo.

Food:
Well, this place is very famous and its only because of its food. They really dont need any description. I love few of the dishes here and you can definitely try them out:

#Chicken Steam Momo : Well the best thing need to be mentioned first. Its juicy, its tasty and its awesome.

#Chicken Thukpa : Well, another thing which really need a mention is their thukpa. They make it really nice.

#Chicken Shyapta: Shredded Chicken in their own style. You will definitely love it.

#Dragon Chicken : Its too hot and spicy. If you wanna eat something real spicy you go for this.

Last words:
This place is just heaven for momo lovers and definitely one of the better places to have momo in The City of Joy. The prices are too reasonable of what you will be getting at this place. A must go place for all. Don't see the ambience just enjoy your food, or, you will be hardly caring about anything else after you give a bite to the momo. Don't miss this place for sure.

4/5 for one of my favourite momo places.

The rating being 4.3 in zomato added to many people talking about this restaurant finally made me visit it. To be honest there is no ambience as such as it is more of a fast food center than a restaurant. The hygiene of this place is something I am very doubtful of as the so called dine-in area was very filthy. The menu card was oily,torn and had bits of food on it. Anyway,had ordered dragon chicken and meat balls which weren't impressive at all. The meat ball should be renamed wheat balls as meat was hardly present in them. The dragon chicken turned out to be stale. Wondering how it boasts a 4.3 rating I and my friends decided to order chicken fried momo and even agreed to wait for the time they asked us to. After waiting for 40 long minutes in that suffocating area we left the place paying for the utter disgusting food we had. In that 40 long minutes wait we kept on knocking them to know when will we be given the momos. Others had received their steamed momo they had ordered for and thanks to their open kitchen we could see they weren't even preparing our order. A big big disappointment.

Momo lovers must surely come and visit this place. The place is very small and cozy. But when it comes to food it will hold a separate place in your heart. 
We had ordered steamed chicken momo, fried chicken momo, chicken phalley and chicken chowmin. 
The steamed momos were filled with soup and chicken. The fried momos were also yummy. One must surely try their Chowmin. Chicken pieces are plenty. 
And the chicken phalley was also good. 
It is a tasty and pocket friendly place.

After reading a lot about denzong I finally decided to visit it.Being a student, pocket friendly eating joints have always been my primary target! After reaching it I was stunned!It comprised of a dirty kitchen where I could see prepared food items kept in an open basket attracting flies to it. The siting area was a dark dingy room that was stinking!With great difficulty I switched on the fan and a CFL.I saw a menu card which when my friend picked up saw that it was soiled and dirty. We ordered meat balls and dragon chicken. We also ordered fried chicken momo but they said momos would take up time-so we decided to order momos after we had finished eating the first two items! The meat balls had hardly any meat in them-they were basically big balls of flour with traces of chicken and chillies. Then came dragon chicken- it looked good-and was garnished with cashew nuts and spring onions.The minute I took my first bite from it-i could smell stale chicken!I could hardly take any more but decided to stay back for the momos as that was recommended by all.I could also see others being served steamed momo so I presumed fried momos wouldn't take up much time.My friends asked the staff minimum 20times-all they said was "abhi ho jayega"!we waited for 40minutes for the momo but it didn't come! So we left after paying for the food we had! Even while leaving we didn't find them making the fried momos at all-in spite of their constant consolations of serving them ASAP! Had the momos actually been good I don't think I would have given them any more than 2!since we didn't even get the opportunity '1' it is! Extremely disappointed!

If you are looking to ambiance and good decor this is just not the place to be into. The outlet is too small and very very average when it comes to the decor. Not clean and tidy too and it's just an above average street food counter. Don't go by the appearance, just judge it by the taste of momos they serve. Already well known for serving the best momos in town, the taste of the Chicken Steamed Momos and normal Chili Chicken gravy is too damn good. Momos had ample stuffing, were tender, juicy and soft. Prices are something that one must really appreciate considering the portions served. Serving time is a bit on the slower side during the peak hours.

I have heard a lot of good things about this place. Being a momo lover I had to give this place a try. The place is quite small and crowded. The momos were a little too oily. But then at just 40 bucks they are serving six pieces of chicken momo. So shouldn't complain much.

"Never judge a book by its cover". This holds up so well with this restaurant. The location is very tricky, and full marks to you if you can get there on your first go. The décor is disappointing. But the food holds up quite well taste wise. To name a few, tiepao, meat balls,chicken shyapta, Thukpa, and the momos, all these are   delicious. Unfortunately same can't be said about some of the other items like Crispi chicken, or dragon chicken.  The place is very pocket friendly and is great for a hangout (though space is an issue). Do give this one a go.

Welcome to Denzong where the juicy yummy Momo will let you forgot the other thing. I just loved their Momo and when ever I got time I love to visit Denzong. Even Thai Pao and fhaley and chicken balls are awesome but try when it's warm. I love the chilly chutney there, it's perfect blend of hotness with spices n herbs. Any Momo lover must visit this place. A must try pals.

The best momo joint in Kolkata and Denzong surely maintain their tag. Placed in Bikramgarh, you can identify the counter by the young crowd waiting outside for the delicious plate of momo. It has become a core and cool area for the young bloods. Starting from momo to chowmeen, everything they make is to die for. The staffs are favourable and serviceable.

Denzong kitchen is my favourite place for hangout and splendid nourishment.

Some places are not made for leisurely ambience but for utterly engulfing experience. Weird right? But Yes! If you trust your empty stomach more than your deceiver eyes, then you will definitely appreciate their certain skills to suffice your indian taste buds craving for Chinese or Tibetan foods. Though its not a joint for authentic Chinese food but rather mostly intended for a bit street category, you will surely find yourself satiated while not hopping in with family or for any serious business but with friends. Here quality tickles with winking bills.

Probably one of the best places in Kolkata to have momos. There's this weird but oh so tasty juicy taste to their momos that you won't get anywhere else. Their meat balls are also quite delicious. Barring the delicious foods, the hygiene is really an issue over there but that doesn't stop people from visiting the place because of its sheer deliciousness of the food they offer. Not to mention the fact, that you'll have a tummy full of momos without even having to worry about the money in your purse. They are damn cheap & I would have to say that they are underpriced for what they offer.

Previously I had rated it 5/5 but every since the arbitrary increase in prices. I don't find myself as attracted to denzong as I was before. The prices have become similar to any other restaurant across town, so i really find no reason to go all the way to tollygunge . The sudden rise in prices of chicken steamed momo from Rs40 to around 60 is a bit much. But all in all, I adore the food and try to ignore the ambience all around. It's not a very nice place to visit in summer, but it's absolutely delightful to grab a plate of juicy momos and bowl of thukpa during winter.

'Denzong Kitchen' is located in Bikramgarh and you can reach there from Jadavpur 8B bus stand or Tollygunge Tram Depot by auto. This small eatery serves the best momo in Kolkata. I have been visiting this place for a long time. Whenever I am in Bikramgarh area, I visit Denzong. If you are looking for ambience, you will not get any but the food here is certainly one of the tastiest that I have ever had. I went here today with my friends. I ordered chicken steam momo first. The momo was juicy and delicious. Next I ordered fried chicken momo which was also delectable. After that we ordered non veg tai pao which surprised me with its awesome taste. We waited for the chicken shay faley and when it arrived, I can say that it was worth the wait. At last, I took chicken hakka noodles which was also delicious. The momos of 'Denzong Kitchen' are far better than any other famous momo joints. I will certainly visit again and again.

Been to this outlet a couple of times. Shown to me by my friend just around 2-3 months ago and I go to this place around once in 2 weeks. Very good good at a really cheap price. The seating is pretty limited and it's pretty cramped but people prefer having their food outside anyway. The only downside is the ambience. But the quality of food is wonderful. Didn't like the Chicken Shyapta though. But the momos (veg and non veg and steamed and fried) are wonderful. The chicken thukpa is just out of this world. It's a must try. A really wonderful place at a really cheap price. Do try it out.

Best momos of Kolkata PERIOD. The first time my friend told me about the momos here, I thought it to be an exaggeration. So when I went there I could just see a really small cramped up outlet catering to a sea full of people (who usually stand outside the shop and eat). This definitely didn't give me much positive feeling. But once the momos arrived and I put the first piece in my mouth, there was a burst of juice upon biting it. My eyes dilated and my senses numbed. What a feeling that was!!!!!

Just like their other outlet just a few steps away......absolutely unimpressive if you go by looks or photos....but remember the saying don't judge a book by the cover it keeps. They do provide reasonably good food at cheap rates. Quantity is good.....quality is above average. The drawbacks.....Same as it's other outlet....no home delivery. Youngsters just love this place and why not?? A quick bite at rates which do not hurt the pocket is always welcome. You can order a take away from here and you won't be disappointed.

Okay so this was my first time... Had been planning since a long time... End of exams finally brought me here! 
It's a very, very small place but who cares when you are having fun with the favourite people and a place of hot momos!!??? 
Well I would definitely not say that these were the best momos because of the oil content but then this place is like a comfort zone....
Fhaley... Yep.. I had that for the first time and I wont say it was bad...  Could have been better!!!!!  
My rating includes the amount of fun I had here along with the momos and fhaley!
Well, comfort zone it is from now.... Will be back very soon!

Best place for evening snacks . Good food and low price , starting from noodles and momos . Denzong's famous Shapta and dragon chicken is a big yes !! Must try. Even side dishes are all good.

Denzong Kitchen is one of the most popular once just for their Momos. Every momo lovers knows about this place & have tried their momos or wishes to taste. So why can't I?

Location : Its located on the roadside of Uday Shankar Sarani Road of Tollygunge, so its absolutely no hassle to find.

Decoration : There's no sitting available inside but there's rack space available where you can put your food & eat it by standing over there. The kitchen is just beside that & its half separated by glasses. It seems odd that they didn't installed chimney. So someone's Szechwan sauce order can make you cough, cry & may make you fall in real suffocation if you are over there standing & eating. It was almost newly painted when I visited it. However clean & hygienic level was somehow okay.

Staffs & Management : Staffs are good, well behaved but you will find them busy as per all time crowd of the restaurant. They take long time to give you the order. They also mixed up orders, so you need to take care of your order well to get what you wanted.


Chicken Steam Momos : Chicken Stream Momos were served well. They were big & looked very delicious. They were steamed well with medium staffing inside. Chicken pieces of chicken momos were kind of mashed with more onions inside. Momos were getting melt inside the mouth. However the momos smelt little bad & tasted nothing great. Soup was nothing but hot water mixed with cornflower. Taste of the momos & soup was disappointed.

Fried Momo in  Szechwan Sauces : There was 6 momos in a plate, with szechwan gravy. The momos were crispy fried but felt little dried from inside. Szechwan sauce was really spicy & hot. Overall it tasted very average.

Chicken Garlic Noodles : Noodles were thick & excessive soft. Actually noodles were overcooked & vegetables were hard to find. It looked rich spicy & it tasted dam spicy as well. It tasted extremely hot that latterly created a small waterfall from my eyes. Small chicken pieces were fried well. However the dish being so hot that it moves other tastes a side.

Pricing : Pricing seems to be low & affordable for all of their noodles & momo dishes. Quantity & quantity is somehow okay for the prices.

Conclusion : Its very hard to believe that how Denzong got this famous. In my thinking Denzong got famous by its locality. There are lot of fanboys of this restaurant belongs from the same area. If you have ever tried real Tibetan foods from Sikkim then you will find nothing special about their Momos, neither its authentic. However its not that bad too, you can definitely give it a try. It wouldn't be a disappointment. But trying their noodles can be a real bad idea.

One recommendation of one of my friend I went there. Ridiculous this eatery is! Famous for its momos which I found terrible. Some liquid fountain comes out everytime you bite the momo chunk and it's really irritating! I sometimes think if the people are paid to stand outside this eatery because paying for such ridiculous food is really silly!

Good for pocket but way too spicy and the dishes don't match their original tastes. The only difference between the dishes is that some are less spicy and others are more.  That's practically all.  
But yes,  good on pocket.

am very disappointed with denzong's fried & steam momos cause I find it sort of rotten, felt like those were made yesterday. Friends, I strongly suggest not to have it from here. If you're hungry n hop near by there then have fried chicken momo with garlic sauce, adds a taste to it. LOL

For most of our small house parties we would get food from Denzong. I haven't been to the place and always opted for takeaway. In a group of  three to eight we always liked this place. It is not only affordable but the food is worth waiting for. Excluding the time taking thing they don't have any drawbacks. 

Probably, they are the best momo makers around the city and by the word of mouth they are well noticed now. Their momos are simply amazing. They mostly prepare Chinese dishes and I personally like the lat ma kai chicken as it's fabulous.

It's a good,  pocket friendly Chinese place that you would love revisiting. :)

This is my first visit to Denzong. We took a rickshaw from jadavpur 8b,and within 5-7min we reached there. The place is quite small and congested.sitting arrangements can be done better & expanded. We ordered chicken steemed momos and fried meetballs.The juicy soft hot momos were just divine in taste..!! The price is also so affordable.! Best for college students like me.. :) A must visit for momo lovers.

It used to be my one of the favourite momo junctions. The steamed & fried momos and noodles are delicious. But, never order the momo in sauce dishes. & The soup provided is of very low quality. Apart from these, the plain steamed & fried momos are really good & they have hiked the price a bit.

A prime example of how deceptive looks can be. What might appear to be a narrow, over-crowded and dingy shop from outside is actually the home to some of the finest momos in the city. And it isn't gloomy at all, bustling about with as much activity as the paltry floor would permit. The over-crowded part is true, and you might have to spend a considerable amount of time in the queue or in front of the counter. But that only helps in whetting your appetite. And trust me, watching the momos take shape is such a wonderful experience in itself. 

I have been here only once, thanks to a friend who introduced me to Denzong Kitchen, and chicken steam momo is what we ordered then. Now I am a sucker for momos and had their preparation not been as per my expectations, I would have infuriated; and they had me at the first bite. The coating was soft, and stuffed with delicious juicy chicken filling. Served steaming hot from the counter, the momos virtually melted in the mouth. Needless to say, I gorged on my plate, and would have gone for another plate had not better sense prevailed.

This little gem of a place seems to be getting significant word-of-mouth publicity, and it deserves every bit of that. They also prepare a host of other Chinese dishes, but people seem to mainly flock for their wonderful momos. It's a pity that they opened shop after I left the city; but I'll be looking forwards to a rendez-vous the next time I'm around.

How do you describe the success strorey of a small momo joint which is opened by some guys from North East India staying on rent on a new city, in a colony, becoming the greatest momo joint of Kolkata in one year with absolutely 0 paisa spent on publicity.

This actually happened in case of Denzong Kitchen & it could be a management lesson for future entrepreneurs. It only happens when your work speaks for you.

When it opened, despite of being witging 100 meters of my home, I was not aware of is exiatence for few month. One of my friend told me, who in turn came to know from his friends & taken me there to make me belive that it really exists in my locality.

In my first try of their chicken & veg momos, and I'm simply swept away. Trust me, it is the best. You actually get to taste the true flavours of mountains. Altough the quality of the soup provided along with the momo has degraded severly over the years, but the momo quality is still great.

Also dragon chicken, tai po, noodles are must haves. You have to stand on road and eat while holding your plate in hand. But the food is totally worth it.

Decor and ambience: nothing to tok about since its a take away or stand and eat kinda place

Food and menu: chinese cuisine basically
Everything here is authentic chinese and they do a good job wid deir momos and dragon chicken and the hakka noodles and the chicken shaapta

Service time: this is a big drawback as they take a lot of time to serve one dish and in that heat u hate to wait

Verdict: visit if u have time in hand and are willing to try good and cheap chinese

This place is perhaps the beat example of the phrase, 'Appearances can be deceptive.' Located in one of the by-lanes of Bikramgarh, this shabby place serves one of the juiciest momos in town. You must try both the fried and the steamed momos- they are equally good! The hot soup that they serve with the momo is just perfect to go with the dish. You can also try the Thukpas or the Shyapta(a litrle spicy). All in all, a hangout place for the students, easy on the pocket and if you're not too bothered about hygiene, definitely a must try!

This outlet is situated in Bikramgarh, just 1 auto away from my college. It's a great place for students.
I have tried the chicken steamed momo and meat balls here and both of them were really reallyyy delicious...
 Infact it was one of the best momos I have ever had! It is definitely the best restaurant for momos in the city. 
We wanted to try out the chicken pan fried momos as well but unfortunately it wasn't available! 

The prices are quite low taking the quality and taste into consideration. The ambience however is not that great...but come on,who cares! 
Overall,its a very nice place for students to hang out!

A place very close to my home.So I visited quite a few times with my friends and sis. The place is not very hygienic and the number of tables are very very low. Most of the people just stand outside and have their food. Coming to the food and its pricing, its totally worth the inconvinience. The momos are juicy and tasty. The Schezwan chowmein is very tasty and spicy too. I would like to mention one more dish to people. Its the Thukpa. Last time I went there, I tried this dish and was blown away and the cost is easy on the pocket too.To add to its charisma, its a popular hangout for college students.

I had very high hopes about the place after reading the reviews here. But, I am sorry, it was a big disappointment going there. They take lots of time even to serve steamed  Momos and that too without soup and sauce. Secondly, the fans at the place don't work and you have stand there sweating and waiting for your food to arrive. Moreover, the Momos are okay, nothing great. And lastly, when I canceled my order of chicken fried rice after waiting for 20 minutes, they started saying, "You canceled the order, it was almost done" and his "done" meant he was still putting the veges and chicken in the wok....I would suggest anyone visiting there to go on a cool breezy day with their stomachs full.....

If you think you have already had the best momos in Kolkata and you haven't visited this place, then trust me you're having a big time misconception.
Denzong serves the best Chicken Momos. Their speciality is that their momos are deadly juicy. You have to put each of them in your mouth directly and as you bite it, there's a blast of juice in your mouth. I have no idea how they make it happen but nothing is better than this. Nothing can be better than this.

Denzong Kitchen, what a place. "Come here for the food, not the ambiance" is what I find myself telling everyone I bring to this literal hidden gem. 

They are without a doubt one of the best momo selling restaurants in the city. Fresh, juicy and steaming hot momos at unbelievable prices. It's perfect for any student. Their quantity is great as well, the other items on the menu are good, but the momos are the spotlight dish. 

Again, their ambiance is non existent. The place is literally just 2 rooms. Their seating is very limited but their demand and the crowd there contradicts their seating availability. 

I cannot recommend this place enough to people. A wonderful hidden gem.

Went there on a friends suggestion, ordered 2 plates of steamed chicken momo, 1 plate pan fried chicken momo and 3 chicken phaley. Loved the momos.. they were very juicy and the stuffing was too good both in taste and amount. The pan fried momo was even better. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The phalay was not upto the mark, maybe because it was cold, would have been better if they served it hot. All in all i loved the food and would go there over and over to have delicious momos.

Have been hunting for this place for a long time after reading such great reviews and finally could make it after my friend took us there for the ultimate food attack. So far the best and authentic chinese dish I have tried without burning my friends' pockets. I was really surprised to see the popularity of this place. One thing might disappoint a bit for people that the sitting place inside is very small - only 4-5 tables and a few stools to sit. But again, if you get such lip-smacking dishes at a very reasonable price, the wait is worth it! I cannot forget the taste of the dishes yet. I have tried Chicken Steam Momo, Chicken Fried Momo, Chicken Thukpa, Chicken Tie Pao and Chicken Shyaphaley. They make blissfully tasty dishes. I couldn't resist so say more. Just go and explore!

Denzong is one of our go to momo place. It is located in an odd location, so it's a hassle for first timers, but if you ask around, or follow the college /school going crowd, you should be able to find it. It is always crowded! They make amaaazing momos and they are really the best! It's similar to the ones you get in kalimpong, if you know how those are. Try the steamed momo btw!
The chowmein and fried rice are also really good and are huge in portions.
I hope they open one near my house now. :P

I've been here on several occasions and under varied situations. This is the ultimate munchie destination. Unbelievably pocket-friendly and extremely efficient. The momos are heaven; I would advice you stick to the steamed ones as the pan fried was not to my liking. The thukpas and shyaphleys are pretty good too. The rice and chow dishes are enough to suffice hungry, growling bellies of two. You must try the garlic/schezwan chow. The chicken I ordered was not very tender, but I made an exception and overlooked it given the quantity provided for the price :)
The staff is very friendly if they're not very occupied. Do visit!

Ratings: Food - 9/10, Pricing - 10/10, Ambiance - 5/10... Dishes worth mention: Steamed Momos, the Thukpa's exceptional, even the quality of Chowmein is good... What more can you possibly expect from a roadside stall?... That having said, it's a good joint... Have a go if you're in Jadavpur, hungry, and broke...

Went there yesterday at 2 pm but unluckily they said they can serve after 3 pm.
So we went today again and ordered a plate of chicken meat balls with chicken steam momo. Meatballs was a disaster and just oppositely steam momo was fabulous. 
No seating arrangement were there. I was bitten by 2-3 mosquitoes for free also. Overall this rating is for momo only.

I have heard of Denzong's momos for quite some time now.Yesterday I was in mood for some momos and so Denzong it was.
You can hardly call this place a restuarant though.It has a dirty kitchen and a equaly small place with 4 tables to sit and eat. The place seemed very popular anyway. I ordered a plate of Chicken Steam Momos and my friend a plate of Szechuan Chicken. The momos were mostly looked like a cross between the Tibetian Momos and Baozis,but were realy yummy. As for the Chicken,I didnt like it at all. It was way too spicy,bland in a way and cooked in way too much soy sauce. I would rather go there for their momos again one day but never the chicken!
P.S- A good place if you want to try Tibetian dishes at a low price.

This outlet of Denzong is a ten minutes walk away from south city , when you take the lane that enters bikramgarh from lords more. The joint is tiny with an open kitchen in front and a few small round tables inside a single room to the right . The restaurant is very popular with the young crowd , and there is a  constant crowd of waiting people outside for takeaway . Though the food here is loved by most,  I must say that their cooking is inconsistent. My friend said that the fried momo he had were great , but when I tasted their pan fried chicken momos , I was disappointed to find that they were half cooked , and not well fried . The outer coating tasted like dough and the sauce in which it was cooked looked unnaturally red ! The chicken thukpa consisted of a handful of thick noodles and chicken pieces floating in a vegetable soup . The thukpa went cold within five minutes of serving . Personally , I'm not a fan of thukpa , but the quality  of the dish was not bad . The hakka chicken chowmein had a homemade taste , and presumably did not have the usual spices that aren't health friendly . The noodles were thick and the pieces if chicken were chunky , though overall it tasted average . The chicken steamed momo seems to be the most popular item on the menu , and is a must try here . In spite of the inconsistent taste and cooking , I must say that their prices are commendably low for the quantity served . Next time I hope to try their chicken shapta and fried momo , and find out if they surprise me !

Tried out the momos reading the reviews and comments in Zomato. It wasn't all that great. Pretty far from where I live, so I'm not gonna feel like going back again unless they improve. Momo is the new competition now and they must realize that to keep up. Wish them well.

You got to try out momos here seriously. This place serves the best momos of Kolkata, not to mention the thukpa and chicken meatballs.

Located at a swanky neighbourhood in Bikromgarh, the place serves a variety of North Eastern delicacies. It has a very limited seating area, hence you have to stand out under the sky and enjoy the food.

One area where I feel skeptical is the hygiene. The place can do better. The equipments could be cleaner and better standards could be set up for its operations.

This joint is mainly famous for their juicy steam momos. Their steam momos are the best in the town. Don't judge it by the looks but tasting their foods. Besides the momo all of their items are delicious and the price is also very cheap. 
I came here many times.Tried most of their dishes.Among the chicken dishes ..dragon chicken is my most favourite.If u visit this place must order a plate of steam momo . Noodles are also good.

Denzong is the name that comes to anyone's mind when someone says momos. Located in a small shop in south Kolkata, the shop speaks for itself. Denzong is a favourite for a quick Momo session and gossip sessions with friends. A must try is the chicken Momo which is a huge chicken dumpling with the chutney and soup. Perfect for the price, denzong Momo wins my heart all the time 😊

Probably the best momo!!!!!! They do add butter in their Momo stuffing so its nice and juicy, and this is what seperates them from others. Go there.......only have Momo or thukpa and never ever try their Meat ball. Its dry, bland and tasteless.
On a whole it was a good experience.

Should it be called a hole in the wall? Dengong Kitchen is a gem of a place in South Kolkata, I still remember those days when for even a half descent bite of Momo you’d have to go to Rabindra Sadan or Bhavanipur. This place has all you can ask for, Food is super (momo filled with soup) had it last time in 2007 on my Sikkim trip, I know the trick the theoretical process of making soupy dumplings, these guys pull it off very well. The chutnee the making or breaking point for any good momo place is nice, fresh and non-generic, I like that. The Menu is just right, options given are perfect for the small kitchen, have tried their entire Menu and it all tastes superb. Light on pocket, no frills place to be, food is good and to me that is all that matters.

Being very close to my college, we keep going here for a quick bite. A tiny shabby place, but it's momos are the best in the city. I love the steamed and the fried momos. They give very generous amount of chicken fillings. Panfried momos are not that great though, mainly because of the sauce they use. The thukpa is also yummy. My favourite is the chicken tai pao. It's a huge steamed bread dumpling filled with chicken and an egg. Very pocket friendly. It's always very crowded. Speaks a lot about its quality.

The immensely popular momo joint is always crowded with young people waiting for their plate of piping hot momos, complemented perfectly with the orange chilli sauce. With hundreds of plates of momo running out of their counter within minutes, they often struggle to keep up with the demands. But for me, that momo sauce are worth the wait.

The place is a bit shabby but the food is out of this world. I had heard about this place a lot of times and knew it was famous for its momos. Little did I know that the first bite into the juicy steamy dumplings would make my heart skip a beat. The chicken steam momos were awesome, though the soup served along with it isn't that good. We also tried the chicken shefalay which was cold when they served it but it tasted good but would have been better if they had served it hot. But momos, hot steamy, little dumplings that fills you with foodgasm.

I was really skeptic when my friend pulled me all the way from Beleghata to come here and just taste the momos. I grew increasingly frustrated as we twisted and turned through the interiors of the road and my stomach roared angrily. However, once we reached, and I had just one plate of the delicious momos, my happiness knew no bounds as I went on to eat two-three more plates to my fill. Would happily take the long journey to this place again to taste the delicacies. :D

The cheapest Tibetan food joint in Kolkata. But their momos are to die for. 

All you need just Rs. 40 to grab a plate of hot chicken momo with red sauce and a bowl of soup. 

For variations, you can try thukpa or ghyatuk ot tie pao. All of them are priced under 100.

Easy on pocket, great food - Denzong is hot favourite among college students like us.

Don't go by the appearance, go and enjoy cheap and awesome tibetian food. Period.

Takeaway is better honestly. 4 only for the food. If you keep ambiance and all in mind then it shoots down to 2.5 or a 3. But the food is worth it and damn damn cheap. We ordered 1 plate each of Pan Fried Chicken Momo in Garlic sauce and Szechuan sauce plus two Chicken thupkas and the quantity of the former was really good while the momo's had 6 pieces. We had it all for just 200 bucks.

Well, many of my friends recommend about Denzong and at last I ended up there. Firstly, ambience matters a lot and for this one it worst than any road side bhajiwala. Not hygienic at all. Now food....quality of momo, mainly steam momo is moderate and comparable to wow!momo. I don't know why Denzong is so high rated. Secondly, their delivery time is excellent....quickest I ever got from any snacks bar. And the main attraction of Denzong is their quality of schezwan sauce....it is richest among Kolkata's other momo counter even in wow'S. It has a true Tibetan flavour wrapped up in every item...starting from thukpa to chowmein....and u will get it without burning ur pocket.

Well, what to say. I am a fan of Denzong's since my first year of college in JU. It has been like a second home. Any given time, I have hopped onto to an auto with friends and gone to Denzong's. From their steamed chicken momos to the fried momos and the shabhaleys and the lip smacking meatballs, it's always been amazing to our taste buds! There hasn't been a single thing that I have tried here that has ever given me reason to complain. I love their garlic chicken fried rice and dragon chicken too. The thukpa would be a speical mention, it's really wholesome and wonderfully flavourful. Perfect to have on a rainy day. Or winter evening. Or summer afternoon. You get the drift. The owner takes very good care to ensure that the food is always of great quality. And it's a treat to everyone. I have long since graduated from JU and am a working class hero now, but my love for Denzong's has remained the same. Luckily, there's a branch closer to my house now, in Golf Green. 
Did I mention Ashoke? There's a lovely girl cat who lives nearby Denzong's. She's white and black and her name is Ashoke. :)

Mainly a momo and takeaway joint. Heard a lot about their momos. We ordered chicken pan fried momos but trust me they were not exactly "pan fried" only fried momos bathed in a red sauce..sprinkled with raw onion & capsicum. However, the mixed noodles & chicken shyapta was good. Basically it's a pocket friendly takeaway joint. As far as the location is concerned.. Pls follow the map..!

Features in the "hidden gem" collection on Zomato and truly so! Hard to find, but that's what makes gems 'gems'. It's quite a shady place inside a lane, with flocks of students waiting outside for their orders and a small seating area inside. 
Coming to the food, we first ordered for a plate of veg steamed momos. I can certainly say that it's one of the best I've had till date. It was so perfect, tender and juicy. Perfectly balanced flavors and exactly what momos should ideally be. The veg noodles was good too. The pan fried momos was amazing as well, with just the perfect sauce, not overly sweet and spicy like other places. 
A must go for all the momo lovers. Highly recommended. Il give them a 4.5 for their steamed momos.

Having heard so much of this restaurant lately, I and my friends decided to bump into the restaurant. Located in Bikramgarh, Tollygunge you've got to know the exact address of the restaurant as it's located in a remote area. Talking about the service, they served us in a very courteous manner. The ambiance was a fail though and we expected it to be so. Hence, no issues with the ambiance. We ordered Pan Fried Momos, Fried Momos, Steamed Momos. All tasted lovely but the Pan Fried Momos made our day. Surely it tasted yummy. The sauce with which it was made was delicious. The price is also cheap there. All came at a very reasonable rate. So other than the ambiance everything was a hit! Looking forward to come back again to taste this lovely Momos!

This place has been on my wishlist for quite some time now and finally got to taste the mouth watering dishes today. 

The only con of this joint is the limited seating capacity. Rest all is just perfect, be it the food quality, the prices or the service.

We were a group of 3 paying a total of just 280 bucks for 5 dishes. 

The order consisted of Steamed chicken momo, Fried chicken momo, Chicken Thukpa, Schezwan Egg noodles and Dragon chicken. Each one of them were just perfect. The chicken pieces were so soft that it almost melted in the mouth. I would recommend each of the above mentioned dishes. Worth a try, specially given the really reasonable prices and they demand. 

All in all, a wonderful experience I must say.

I never really was into momos. I had had a few before but it never really dug me in. So this time when I'm back in town, my friend pleads me for this place called Denzong. Should be worth a try I thought. Okay. I had never known soo many varieties of momos before. And never really seen THIS much crowd for momos ever before. And when I tasted  - damn, I fell in love. They were amazingly soft, unbelievably tasty and wtf cheap. I visited this place for three more times in the next two following weeks. The smell and the taste was unnerving enough to keep me munching on. I would definitely recommend every momo enthusiast in Kolkata to please be here atleast once - this is your heaven. But then if you are a Calcuttan, I don't need to tell you that, do I ?

But just so u readers know what I actually want to tell in order to describe their great cuisine, I always find excuses to visit this place for its momos. I stay in Naktala, even if its late evening, and the thought of momos come, there's only one place I would get up & go to. Yea Denzong it is. & trust me I actually am that crazy to make the effort to go there just to have my fav momos. U really wont want to care abt its ambience because their food is simply so great, that the ambience wouldn't matter at all.

Located at Bikramgarh, tollygunge. The location is a bit remote in my opinion and you really have to know the exact location to find it. But the food is worth it. The price is totally reasonable and very good quality of food is served, inspite of the prices not being that high. The cons are the space inside the restaurant is too small. You can hardly get a seat if you have a 5 friends accompanying you. Other than that, the food and price is totally worth it.

I would be honest... I didn't find their momos exceptionally great. What I do think is great is the SPICEY SHYAPTA... & also the CHICKEN THUPKA they are great traditional tibetian food makers.. again don't expect any lavishness or great decors etc. etc. it's for students and will be like that. That's why it's so cheap ;)

The chili chkn was a hit too and quite spicy. The momo sauce could have been more authentic. Prices are damn cheap. Must try folks

I might be the odd one out with my reviews but they are honest,trust me!!
Denzong was on my go-to list for the past two years and finally we took the pain(and why?) to go and check the reason of the hype and the shock came in. BIG SHOCK.
We reached at 1:50pm only to be greeted by an empty shop. After waiting for sometime,an equally disinterested man came out to inform us that it will take about 10 minutes for them to start serving momo.
We found out by ourselves that they have a sitting place inside and we headed to a very very dirty room with a few plastic stools and tables. I didn't expect anything as I had already read other reviews of this place so it was expected. What was not expected was the cook's(or whoever he was) rude behaviour and his "10 mins" actually made us wait for 40 mins.
Food:As nothing else was available, we decided to try the meat balls. I wouldn't say they were extraordinary and I would love my chicken pakodas from any road side stalls better,any day! The meat balls' "meat" was surprisingly almost nil. Then after almost deciding to leave, we were served a plate of their "signature dishes" chicken fried momo. No soup was served with the momos and it disappointed me. A LOT.
The outer layer of the momos were hard. Yes, hard. So hard that while trying to bite one, it slipped out of my mouth. Sheeeesh :/
Nothing else was available. So we decided to leave.
All in all, I didnt find the reason why this place is so famous.. maybe I have entirely different taste buds..so be it :)

Some places are not about the location or ambience. They are purely about very, VERY good food! Denzong will be missed by anyone who walks past and who isn't in the know. But those that know cannot walk past without stopping by for a quick plate of steamed chicken momo!

The momos-the juiciest, softest things imaginable-will surely melt in your mouth. Pro tip- don't order fried momos, they aren't as juicy. Always ask for the soup with the momos, and the hot sauce.
The pao or bun stuffed with minced meat was not to my fancy, being too doughy. The meatballs are a fair offering. I'm already planning another visit to sample the remaining items. I'm lucky that it falls right on my auto route back home. :D
Denzong, forever. ✌

Well for students and for a measured pockets this joint can be good. The momos are good but I have tasted their thupka, it is not upto the mark at all, and the place is not at all clean. They do serve good momos but the noodles are over rated than their standard of serving. There is small branch of theirs in front of JU gate four, where I usually go with a hungry stomach and restricted budget but for dining this place is not my choice. So light tasting and eating momos can suffice.

I loved the steamed Chicken momos. I never ever order steam momos anywhere but after sooooo much good reviews and word to mouth appreciation of this place I just had to visit the place.  First  and foremost I stay near medical college hospital, college street.  So I had decided if it didn't live up to its hype I would have bashed and trashed them here in zomato. But boy o boy I am so happy that I was proved wrong. Such juicy momos. God knows what or how they put them in but bless the thinker's or cook's mind who thought of it. Just mind blowing. Packing them for later consumption would not be justified at all to it so I didn't.  If I stayed near then it would have been a possibility. The fried momos were good as well. But the steamed ones were beyond finger licking. I slurped the remaining juices from the plate. I couldn't help it. I was so busy having them that I forgot to take the pictures of the steamed ones. So after nearly wiping away the fried ones I took the picture.
I have fallen badly for this momo and this was my first time.
Better late than never.

I've been to Denzong quite a few times already. Their chicken steam momos are simply the best. Recently I tried the pan fried chicken momo in schezwan sauce. It's my new favorite item in here. Apart from that I also tried the chicken shyapta and the chicken fried rice. Both were good but nothing extra ordinary. If you can't decide between chicken shyapta and dragon chicken, then I would recommend the latter.

The reason I reduced my rating is:

1. Denzong has never made me wait before. But this time they made me wait for almost an hour.

2. (This might be a figment of my imagination)Even though I was extremely hungry and even though I have a pretty big appetite, I get too full too soon in here. I have been unable to complete even small portions of my food and the same goes for my friends too. On top of that I have been feeling extremely sleepy after eating here and my friends agree on that too. Hence I have a feeling that they might be using some kind of additive which is causing the loss of appetite and inducing sleepiness.

If you love Tibetan food this is the place to be. The best MOMO in town hands down. The momos here are moist, oily on the inside, full of flavour and cooked perfectly. We also tried chicken shapta  and it was really good. I wish they start making pork item, that will be icing on the cake. Simply love this restaurant, its cheap, it serves amazing food what more could a foodie ask for.

This has been on list for long.. finally gave it a visit last week nd so thought to pen down some of my opinions.. 

To talk about the place, it is a tiny joint with buzzing crowd.. not at all decored.. but a cool place for college-goers to hangout....  u have to struggle to snatch a seat !!

We tried steamed nd fried momos, thukpa, shyapta here.. out of these I liked chicken thukpa the most. It tastes very good with full of chicken nd other veggies. Moreover the quantity was large comparing to its price. 

I found the momos succulent nd tasty specially the steamed ones.. though the soup that came with momo was horrible !! 
I didn't like the chicken shyapta much.. it was kind of dried chicken curry.. I got disappointed with it..

The main plus point here is the price.. the food comes really cheap with comparatively larger quantity.. 

To sum it up, it definitely worth a visit with your gang of friends for a chitchat session over steaming momos... :-)

Probably the first and the only one to give a bad rating for this restaurant. Their momos may be excellent and Denzong may be a hidden gem in the city,but it has no sense of hygiene. They say you get to know the cleanliness of a house by going to the washroom, but this outlet was full of cockroaches and dirt inside the eating area. On close checking of its kitchen, I observed cockroaches as well as mice roaming all over the place. I dont know how the people can be so reluctant and care just about the food without even taking a look at the surroundings. My request to all the foodies.... JUST DONT GOBBLE DOWN ANYTHING!!! if the kitchen can be so dirty, imagine how hygienic the food would be. Good Luck!

One should not judge this joint by it's appearance. This is the place where you can actually relish your cravings for momos. Been there many times and have had their momos, thukpas, chowmein, faley, meat balls. Their meatballs and momos are extra ordinarily good in taste. The speciality of their momos is that they are juicy unlike momos from other joints. The location is a bit difficult to figure out. Good spot for students as the prices are too low for every dish. If you are planning to dine lavishly then this place is a bad choice. :(

This is a very good place for a quick bite with friends. Hanging out is not possible much because there are very few places to sit. My friends and I did get places after waiting for some time. But the smoke from the kitchen made it unbearable. The food is very good. We had Chicken Thukpa, Chicken Shephaley, Chicken Shyapta, Chicken Pan Fried Momos, Hakka Chowmein and Veg Garlic rice. It is very cheap and tasty making it a very popular joint for the students. The staff is helpful. I am surely going back for more.
Special mention: The soft drink shop next door.

This place is overhyped. No seating arrangements. You have to sit on the steps by the roadside, along with street dogs, who by way, will lick of your plate/bowl (which are left on the steps, unless these are the disposable thermocol ones).

Only plus point is the cheap price.

Hygiene and Service quality are very low.

One of my friends took me there all of a sudden just to try their special mouth-watering momos and trust me they were simply amazing. Situated inside a shabby lane of golf green, nobody can even imagine that the momos available there is so tasty. I did not try the other items so the rating is only for their momos.

Definitely the best momo joint in kolkata! I'l deduct 1 mark for the ambience. But for the rest, everything is perfect!Extremely pocket friendly..its mostly popular among the college students from South Kolkata..and people from North kolkata probably have never heard of this name before..or have no clue that such an amazing joint exists!It's a bit difficult to locate this place if you're going for the first time. But once you reach this place, you'll cherish every bit of the effort that you paid for the trip cuz its soooooo delicious!  And their service is super quick too.When we go there, we take down 10-15 momos at one go. The momos are so juicy and watery that you would need to put the entire thing into your mouth or you'll end up splashing water all over your plate and table :PI haven't tried any of the other dishes yet, but i am planning to do so the next time.My only grievance about the place is the ambience..they could have made it a little better. But given the poor ambience, the number of customers that they still attract daily is solely due to the excellent quality of food and service..which is highly commendable.I have already suggested many and would always recommend everyone to pay a visit at least once. :)

A bit hard to locate...u will get autos from Jadavpur 8b stand ..otherwise it is a 10 mins walk from Lords crossing. Some friends had told me about this place...now I visit it atleast once a month. Its very popular among students. Looking forward to trying out the other delicacies soon :p

Best part, a plate of Steamed Momo costs only 40 bucks! No wonder it's so famous in the student community! So if you live nearby, and want some really tasty and cheap food, Denzong is the place.

I visited this place after revewing them in zomato..qq for 15 minutes I am trying to order 3 steamed momo,1 pan fried 'n schezwan sauce and one pan fried in garlic sauce and two veg momos... After 15 minutes when I placed the order they said chicken steamed will take time.... I said no prob you please confirm and take the money...u am still waiting for confirmation...
Just now confirmed they r preparing... Rated till this experience will update once I hchhe them....the environment is suffocating me to death.....
I got one chicken momo less as they completely forgot after 45 minutes....anyways I paid 260 and eagerly waiting to eattttt.... When I first took a bite to chicken momo it's salty... Tried veg momo that is also salty.....coming to panfried in schezwan and garlic sauce I doubt they have used anything apart from ketchup,.... S this is what you expect a foodie to get after being steamed in your joint for an hour? To management please do not keep on opening branches at the stake of your quality,....

YUMMY momos! This tiny place located in the heart of South kolkata is bustling with the young crowd even at 10pm. Food is damn cheap and if you have a right purse but are in the mood for Chinese and Tibetan, Denzong Kitchen is the place to go. 
Ambience could be improved a lot. Service is also not up to the mark. So points deducted for that.
Otherwise, food exceeds expectations and the homely feel is a real crowd-puller!

The flavour of momo here is different from the other momo joints in Kolkata. It was juicy,yummy...undoubtedly the best momo i ever had. Bedside momo,we had chicken shapta and meatball. Both of them were equally good. Shapta was huge in quantity. Everything had an authentic flavour. Food is very chaep. Though the place is a bit shabby and hard to locate ,but considering the food they serve these points are worth ignoring.

Actually lives up to the tagline 'Mecca for Momo lovers!! It's been a huge hit with the young crowd. Difficult to locate if you are coming for the first time but it's well worth it. One bite on the juicy momo and your tongue says thank you. Few more bites and you are already floating towards heaven. Well well I have been itching to go back there and taste some more juicy goodness!

One of the most happening food joints for school and collage goers of Lake Gardens and Golf Green area. Though in Zomato its mentioned as Tollygunge but its actually locatd in the interior of Bikramgarh  just in the opposite lane of Harisabha field. I came to know about this place from one of my friend , so went there one day to taste their food. The place is small with a single room to sit with an attached kitchen and to much crowd in front. But dont go by the looks. their food is awesome. If you want to have authentic Tibetan and Chinese food, you need to come to this place and taste their food. I had their famous momo, and with that phale and shyapta. And trust me, each and every item tastes just awesome. The do proper crowd and order management. Some time you have to wait outside for 10 mins as there are to much order pressure but they will surely deliver your ordered items within 10 minutues maximum. Would love to visit there again to taste their mouth watering delicacies.

Located in an interior area of Bikramgarh, this joint would have faded into obscurity had they not served those delicious and juicy steamed momos. This has quite become a most happening food joint of the southern section of the city with most of the crowd being from the GenNext section. Very popular with the college going students, they also attract people of much higher age bracket too. Only demerit is that the joint is too small and you need to stand and eat outside on the road, footpath or in the alley. And as goes with the fame, the crowd pull is quite good so that you need to wait for quite a while before your order is served. But nevertheless a must visit place, esp due to their steamed momos. They are just fab!!

Awesome place to satiate taste buds . Loved their MOMOS which are easily the best in town. Little folds of heaven! I guess that’s the best way to describe the momos at this place. They are wonderfully consistent and literally melt in your mouth. The momos here are very fresh tasting and so full of flavour and moisture! 

They are served with a spicy chutney made primarily out of tomato and red chilly.  These momos beat the ones available at some of the best oriental restaurants in Kolkata, hands down! 

This place is just a shop with a few chairs outside. They maintain excellent levels of hygiene at this place. The owner/proprietor is really a nice chap who makes you feel all the more welcomed with his gestures.

Must admit, its very hard to stop at one portion!

Finally, I visited the Denzong Kitchen today evening. I reached there at around 5:30. The place was full of students and young college couples. The place is small the sitting area is also small and lacks proper ventilation so inside it's hot and humid.
Given the price of the food, it will be too much to ask for a luxury dining facility. It's a place for young people in love with Chinese food.
I wanted to have chicken shyaphaley but it was not available, I fixed with chicken thukpa.
The dish was wonderfully prepared, full of chicken but lacked veggies. The noodles were fat and awesomely tasty.
I full bowl of chicken thukpa is more than enough to fill a hungry stomach.
I will visit again to try momo and other on the menu.
The food is awesome. A must visit.

Fantastic momos. Had momos on a rainy evening. Being completely drenched, plate of hot momos perfectly complemented each other. However the momos were more oily than they should have been. Chinese food are also available and they really smelt delicious though I have not been able to taste the same as yet. If u r looking for right kind of momos and little original ones near golf green never hesitate...

We also ordered the dragon chicken which was good. But the momos definitely are d best part of denzong kitchen. Though i would say that the ambience is not upto the mark, but u ll enjoy the food there.

I had always heard good reviews about Denzong from few of my friends, who would spoke about the delicious momos that the place offers. Myself being a momo lover, I always wanted to visit the place, but didn't know about its exact location, until one day 3 of us friends went out on a quest for Denzong. It was difficult to locate, and we had to ask about it to several people. When we reached the place, we found it to be a tiny eatery. They have a very small sitting arrangement, and people mostly have their foods outside.

Since my first visit, I've been there for many other times. What really attracts me is their spicy foods at such a cheap price. Honestly, their momos are not the best I've had. The stuffing is small, the inside is too oily. But then again, why should I complain? At Rs 40 they give 6 pieces of Chicken Momo. The quality of the momos varies from time to time though.

I've had Chicken Schezuan Noodles and Chilli Chicken. Both tasted good, because me and my friend were very hungry, and the food did satisfy us.

Their Dragon Chicken is another great dish. Do try it.

Please visit the original (Bikramgarh) outlet and if possible avoid the Bijogarh branch. There is no place for cars in the narrow lane so better to walk down.

A tiny eatery located at bikramgarh known for its momos.they serve tasty momos at unbelievably low prices. Dragon chicken and noodles are also tasty.. 
The place loses its charm when it comes to service ..in the peak hours one might have to wait for quite sometime or repeat the orders several time before getting the food served..
A very pocket friendly place..heaven for students

Went to denzong kitchen yet again. Had to rave about their food hence, this review. The food is absolutely delicious. The momo is, might i say, heavenly. The soft coating, the moist filling..it is just too good to miss. Although they lack in ambience, they more than make up for it in the quality of the food. Plus, there's the option of home delivery so its a win-win situation. We even tried the Shaphaley (which is basically pan fried momo with a twist), Gyathuk (a spicier, more chicken-y version of the traditional thukpa) and Dragon chicken (chicken cooked in spicy red sauce and cashews). All the dishes were very tasty with their trademark momos topping the charts. And the unbelievably low price has made me a die-hard fan and regular customer :-) #happytummy

The momos are beast..!!! Cheap and tastier than what one can think of... Thukpa is excellent, and Meatballs are damn ausum..!!! Today, for the 1st tym we tried the Tie Pao, and it was a total value for money...!!!! The best thing about this place is that, it is very pocket friendly as well...

The other days some of my friends and I went to the much hyped denzong for a quick bite. It was very crowded when we reached and it took some time for our momos to come. The steamed chicken momos were really nice but the fried momos were very oily. We wanted to try the phaleys but they weren't available and they refused to make more. Overall, it was a decent experience.

Denzong's kitchen is a tiny eatery located at bikramgarh. It's mainly known for the Momo they serve at cheap prices. Apart from the Momo I also find chicken shyaphale and Dragon chicken to be extremely tasty.
However, it's not one of those places with prompt service. You've got to wait for quite some time before you get your order delivered. But I'd say the food is worth the wait.

The spicy sauce which comes as an accompaniment is very well made n tastes fantastic.Thukpas and Phalays as well as Meat balls are great too. Chowmin, however isn't upto the mark, because its too oily. Everything else is absolutely divine.

Don't worry about how it looks for it looks like a random after thought of a food counter. By God, brace yourself after you order the momos. Amazing stuff. Certainly in the top 3 as far as momo places are concerned. I didn't try anything else. Well, after the chicken momos which oozed ghee, anything else would have been a travesty. A place you must go to.
 
As far as ambiance and seating arrangements go, there's isn't much to speak of. We did not bother sitting. Trust me, you won't either.

One of the best places to have momos from in the city. Tucked away in the bylanes of Bikramgarh, you really need to know where you are going to find this place. But once you do, this place is heaven. The seating arrangements probably not the best you'd ever come across, the food here though is worth dying for. The momos, fale, chow, dry chili chicken are the standouts. Tastes awesome and quite cheap! This place is a must visit for any foodie.

Have been a fan of Denzong since its birth.
The best momos in town at an unbelievable price. 
Be it steamed or fried, pork or chicken, the momos will definitely win your heart.
Try the chicken thukpa and the meat balls.

Many people, like me, keep on coming back to this place for the food and also for such a nice and friendly owner, Sourav da.

Have a budget of 100 bucks? Try Denzong and your tummy will be full.

This is supposed to be a momo joint which has several feathers on its cap, from tasty fried momos, thukpa and tai pao (which were recommended). I decided to order a home delivery of two of its best dishes — fried momos with garlic sauce and thukpa. And thus my mistake! The service is terrible. They sound like pros when they ask you to sms (!!!) your order and location so that there is little room for error. The order arrives an hour late! The excuse — it's a Sunday! Distance — round about a km!!! And that's not all. It is not even a doorstep delivery... Then the guy mixed up with the order. After repeated calls when he finally picks up and changes the packets...the momos are doused in schezwan sauce and not garlic sauce as I ordered, not to mention a proper plastic box as I specifically had written! They don't even provide a proper bill!!! And I haven't even arrived at the best of the worst part... The food, now almost cold (just imagine cold rubbery momos!) tasted shit. The momos hardly had any fillings and the wrap was full of too much hot and sticky tomato sauce!!! The thukpa hardly had any flavour. I am angry at myself for the money I wasted! 200 bucks worth a lot in a place like kolkata!
I am NEVER ordering from this place again!!!

I have been to this place just once, but I can't wait to get back here. As someone who revels in dishes so hot they send you sweating like a warthog to the nearest shop with a Coke or a mineral water, I loved Denzong Kitchen. This is not a place for the faint of heart. The chicken shyapta and the momos and the schezwan noodles are a delight, wonderfully, fragrantly spiced and very, very hot - just to my taste. I cut my proverbial teeth (or rather palate) on the devilishly hot momos of my hometown in Assam, so this was a fond nostalgic trip down memory lane for me.

I'm coming back very soon.

Not actually a place to dine lavishly. But the quality of momos and thukpa is mind blowing and melts in the mouth. There's a small place though when somehow you can sit and eat. Ambience is not that good. But what draws me here are the excellent momos. Tasty. Recommended.

Amazing steamed chicken momos.. Lite Thukpa, which I love. 
Bottomline, the food is great here.
The service has to improve, they don't pay attention while a customer is talking to them. Mix up orders. 
But the momos here are to die for.

Its at Bikramgarh. A little walk from the golf garden. If u take the auto from toly to 8b or reverse then u can alight exactly on the spot!
They make one of the most delicious chicken momos found in Kolkata. It's juicy, soft, has an unique flavour nd taste! The soup is mundane not nethng special.
Among the other chicken side dishes, I wud love to mention the Dragon chicken! It has a many shredded pieces of chicken tossed in Chinese red sauces nd cashew spreaded all over before serving. It looks hot but is not! My friends hu just can't eat chili at all also loved d dish! Another lovely side dish is the chicken shyapta. It's also very tasty.
The chow prep over here r very cheap nd has a good amt. The taste is just normal. Nd u can not complain coz u won't get chow at this rate anywhere else of this quality.
Chicken shyafaley is also nice.
But I personally hate the Tie Pao. It's just a ball of bread or u can say not so cooked bread ! Nd has stuffing of pieced boiled egg nd tasteless chicken nd too much onion. It's pathetic in taste.
The clinch is the lack of space nd not at all good sitting arrangement.
But the greatest plus point is the price chart nd quality.

Apart from this, they make pretty good dragon chicken which is a bit spicy, noodles and rice are also good.

Appearances are deceiving ! There is no better example to this proverb than this tiny little corner shop.
More famously known as "Sourabh ka dukhan", denzong is THE place to go for momos if u r anywhere near tollygunge/golf green/ jadavpur. The place is frequented by students of JU, nearby residents And executives ! A place to find new friends and strike up interesting conversations. 
Pros :
1. Tasty. Real tasty food
2. Easy on the pocket
3. Friendly staff
Cons
1. Pretty much no parking. Maybe some bikes and a car or two squeezed here n there
2. The sitting in is small , dingy n not neat
3. Waiting time is pretty high, partly  due to the large crowd
Must try items:
Chicken steam momos ( thou the soup could be better ), shyafale, chicken chow

I hope the guys realise their business has a larger potential and scale it up soon. They'll have customers , if they keep up their culinary skills, that's assured !

Finally had momos at this place, finding the place is a challenge in itself, but apparently everyone knows where it is, just ask anyone and they will tell you.

The chicken momos really stand upto its name and rating on zomato, the place was small but the momos were really awesome and bang on value for money. Thukpa wasn't so nice though

Overall i have given a 3.5 because the food was on the oilier side and the anything apart from the momos wasn't anything special, but this the momos were incredible

This shop can be phrased as 'chota packet bar a dhamaka' .. The best momos in town without a doubt. Butter filled momos, thukpa, and pan fried momo is a must for each and every foodie... the best part is you can have all these things at a price less than you pocket money .. the shop is located at bikramgarh which is not a crowded place .. but due to this shop the place is becoming crowded everyday after 6pm ..... it is a shop which is catching the heart and stomach of the youth of the city..

One of the best places in Kolkata to have momos. Though being in the lanes of Bikramgarh, any local can guide you to the place.
Chicken Thukpa was quite good, and had considerable amount of chicken compared to other places I had Thukpa in Kolkata. The steamed momos were one of a kind - stuffed with good amount of chicken with right seasoning and juicy. The Tai Pao (for those who don't know what is it-its sort of a giant momo, size of your fist) was too good - stuffed with quite a lot shredded chicken!!!
The sitting arrangement is a bit clumsy, and often it is overcrowded. But still considering the price and quality of food, the place is totally worth it!!!

Their chicken steamed momos are delightfully tasty and also pan fried momo .
The place is cheap and absolutely worth the money .
Must have - CHICKEN STEAMED MOMOS.

One thing, they tend to use too much salt in certain dishes ( except the chicken steamed momo. Its just perfect !) , but it's okay .

I m from alipurduar this a city in north bengal but for my studies i m staying at Kolkata for 8 years ....... Well MOMO is something which is like bread and butter to me cause my city alipurduar and its nearby places prepare some of the best momos in West Bengal ...... When i first came to kolkata in 2007 i was in search of momo in kolkata how many places i had been to,  for momo i dont remember.. Or i must say i have stopped counting ..... Well during my search i ate some of the best momos like in mainland china, bapi dar momo, momo sellers in garia 3 point etc etc .... Well it cam to an end at denzong intially people used to call it SAURAV's and now it is known as denzong........ Well if u are looking for momo plzz do try it once and i can bet once ur heart will cry YEH DIL MAANGE MORE .... although the quality is no more the same it used to be but still it deserves to be one of the best ... But As i say in every review taste and flavor varies from person to person so plzz do visit this place

Ahh! What can you expect from this little street outlet lost in those lanes. But this is the right place where anyone on earth would go just to have those momo. Those little juicy bags of chicken, ahh what a wonder. You will never ever get such momos anywhere in town. This place is the best. Not even a 5 star restaurant can give you that pleasure. The succulent momos just melts in your mouth and all the juices rolling down your lips and you don't really feel like rubbing them off because its the happiness you get from those momos that you don't care about the world around. What a little wonder it is. And mind you, there's a hell lotta crowd here. So dont expect getting served too soon.

Hearing so many great reviews for Momo and Tibetian dishes for this place, I visited this place on a weekday evening. The place is Bikramgarh, if you tell the auto-wala they will drop you at the Denzong stoppage (haha, that is some achievement by the restaurant). 
There was good crowd, scattered, eating momos mainly. I sat in the inside part, a small tiny room, super suffocating one. Ordered for chicken Pan fried momo, thukpa. The momo was good in taste, juicy indeed. The thukpa was below average, momo stuffing inside the soup! 
price is cheap.
But all that cheap does not give high value only. 
I heard this is Mecca for Momo Lovers, but then I will say WOW MOMO is Universal Truth for them. So Wow Momo still is the best Momo joint in town.
Good, but definitely not one of the best.

This place is like a hidden gem. Undoubtedly I had the best momos in my city from here. Forget about those big Tibetan restaurants and momo joints here in the city, this place will get you drooling once you taste their momos. Succulent steamed momos with that spicy sauce never gets boring, they have completely made me addicted to it. Every week I would visit this place at least once with my friends. There are other good dishes in the menu too which I have tried but their momos are the star of the show. Just don't judge the place by its appearance if you visit it and simply go for the food.

This place is a bit crowdy and hard to find for new comers. Only the chicken steam momo tasted great. It was juicy and the steamed meat tastes unique. Though you have to tell multiple times to get a plate of momo. I had to tell thrice, sigh! Other than that pan fried momo and meat balls were pretty average. Even they served frozen meatballs. A bit disappointed after hearing such wonderful reviews. Will come back only for chicken steam momo.

If you are looking for fancy....well this is not the place for you. But, if you are looking for the best Momos in town, Denzong Kitchen is the go to place. Ordering a plate of steamed chicken momo here, will be the next best decision you will be making today. The momos are fresh and piping hot, every time they are presented to you. No stale and rubbery momos anymore. 
The momos come with this oily-chicken-stockity liquid (you have to have it to understand it) inside...that is nothing like anything you have ever had anywhere. Make sure you put the whole thing in your mouth at once. If you love momos and friendly smiling faces, then there is no reason why you should not visit at least once. There are a lot of other things on the menu, though I specifically visit for the momos.

This place is heaven.the amazing momos they make will always leave a special place in your heart. The very special part oabout their momos is it that it is very juicy due to use of animal fat. So when youborder your own plate of these me momos, the moment you bite into the ..a very good balanced taste of steamed meat .onions and tender juice fills you up. There is only one thing which youbwould wish for after them ..and that is ordering another plate of them and if you are lucky . you might get them soon considering the amount of crowd is around there.

I consider myself a avid momo lover and you can take my two cents .. This is the place to go if you want to enjoy good momos at really low price ( come on six momos for rs 40 ) .Then again you have mainland china which would give you 4 dumplings for rs 200. The choice is completly yours sir

This place is pretty hard to find, situated in one of the dingy lanes of Bikramgarh. I wouldn’t have known about this place hadn’t it been for my kind friend who drove me there. What followed was sheer food coma, with me downing mouthfuls of Momos, oh those lovely Momos. If you ask me Denzong definitely serves one of the best momos ever, if not the best. If you live in the gariahat-jadavpur-garia area and find Blue poppy too far, then you can definitely drop by Denzong and savour their delectable Momos. Apart from the momos, what I like the most is their Baos. Those stuffed Tibetan breads, baked to perfection. They are a meal in themselves and a person with medium appetite can easily find herself/himself stuffed after having one of these. By the way I think these people add peanuts in their momos, which gives out that woody smell making them brilliant. I also tried their rice noodles and normal noodles. They were pretty good too. The last time I went there which was a long time ago they didn’t have any pork or beef items. I hope they included some pork and beef items in their menu now. Plus they should definitely open up in other areas of Calcutta too.

I hv tried their steam momo, faley, tie pao, thukpa nd hakka noodles....all r equally good but momos are their speciality. If u visit this place u must try it...and if u want to hv smthng new u can try tai pao. So in my opinion if u love tibetian food u must visit denzong!

Chicken Meatballs where cold and tasteless,  with meat missing, all i can taste was flour.  friedrice was not good,  mixed chowmein was ok,  chili chiken was worst,  i cook better chili chicken than that, momos are fine.  not recommended unless you are on budget.

They do not have good place or ambience to enjoy food. Their service is also not remarkable. But they have MOMOS to win your heart. They have variety of Momos. This is one of the best momo corner of kolkata. You should also try Dragon Chicken, a Tibetan dish there. It is awesome to enjoy. This place demands revisit.

Went to kolkata for a few days and the first day i went to this place which was a small chinese restaurant with minimal occupancy however the food compensates all.
Denzong Kitchen reminds of Momo's point in delhi if you talk about the food, the noodle is really good and along with that you may also try momos at a reasonable price. The service is quick provided that you're lucky enough to grab a seat there.
Overall a good place to chill!

Being a vegetarian it is difficult to find a good place that served mouth watering veg momos.

Denzong is one of those brilliant momo serving places.

Make a visit at least once for that juicy and delicious momo.

Denzong is my absolutely favourite place to hit up when i'm in the mood for Chinese and momos. It is better than any of the other starred restaurants in Kolkata. The steamed and fried momos, the chicken thukpa, the meat balls, the chicken shyapta, chicken chowmein, all of it is to die for! You will come back for more for sure when you visit this place.
This place is almost always over crowded and you will hardly find any place to sit. Because of the crowd, service gets a little slower, but its worth the wait! The prices are dirt cheap and you can just keep eating without thinking of the bill. One must must must try out this place for sure!

Want to have great momos? then Denzong is the place. It serves special momo. Those juicy and lovely momos are the best momos I've ever had. Yes, there may be no proper seating arrangements, but, you may go there and taste those juicy, soft and lovely momos. The price is pocket-friendly. The best place for hangout or you can go there alone. That's it. Go and have fun!

You a momo lover and have listed out the places you would like to visit for momo? Then Denzong should be right at the top. A very small place in a residential area. Place looks shabby and simple. One may mistake the place as roll'r dokan. No proper sitting arrangements. However, all the pains are adjusted with their Lovely momo. I loved them. Juicy and soft. Tastes awesome. The price is pocket friendly. A very good place for outing with friends or alone. It ensures your tastes bud asks for it more. 
The place maybe a hideout for many but popularity has been increasing every single day.

I am still exploring Denzong....

If you are looking for the juiciest and tastiest momos in town that'll melt in your mouth this is the place for you!! It's been over three years that I am a regular visitor of this place and you bet the taste hasn't changed a bit. The place is crowded, extremely small, hence, do not try to sit inside. They do take a little too long to serve the momos..but trust me it's worth the wait. It is located at Vikramgarh.. a little difficult for those to locate the place who are not acquainted to this area. ALso, my rating is solely for the momos and not for the ambience. If you are looking for a nice cozy place then this is not the place for you, however if you are my kinda foodie whose prime importance is just the food served to you then go ahead..You bet I won't be blamed for suggesting this place! Till then Happy Eating!! :)

Lately i have been visiting denzong too much.  It has no proper seating place, you get to enjoy your food under the sky mostly. The soda and cold drink shop beside is a plus point. The momos or rather dumplings are nice and filling, six pieces for 40 rupees is not  a bad deal at all. Its the steam momos that keep me coming back for more. But recently i have noticed that they are not steaming the momos properly and thats a put off. Other than that they are yummy?

A review for this takeaway is fairly simple: Denzong has spoilt me for all other momos. Period.
I am a huge glutton for momos. So momos for as cheap as 40 bucks is a gift from God. The first time I went there, I had to search for the place for a good 15 mins before I finally found it. It's at the fag end of a tiny bylane off the tiny Bikramgarh main road. The place, at the first glance, looked positively unappealing, dirty and dinghy. However, the wonderful juicy steamed momo filled with the soup and chicken made me give up all my qualms. The fried momos aren't oily and almost feels like they've been baked. Be careful not to burn your tongue in a hurry, because they serve you straight from the oven.
There is a tiny seating arrangement inside, but the college crowd that are it's main customers usually don't have a problem standing or sitting on the neighbouring walls and eating. If you have a driver or if you're feeling very brave, you can bring your car into the lane and eat there. It's the perfect place for taking your bikes too. And don't worry if standing is not your thing, pack some hot , steaming momos and take them home. You will not regret.

Denzong is like a hidden heaven for Tibetan food lovers. It is a fast food corner with few sitting capacity inside while most of the people prefer to eat outside. Though the good food and low price would make you overlook the sitting capacity. They serve authentic finger licking tibetan momos at dirt cheap prices. Momos here are simply the best you can get in Kolkata, served with hot and spicy schezwan sauce along with soup!!! Those are deliciously big, juicy and the stuffing tastes real awesome...WOW!!! Apart from momos, the dry chilli chicken, schezwan noodles, phaley, thukpa, meatballs and dragon chicken are worth trying. Extremely delicious and mouth-watering!!

I have never ever seen this place empty, no matter what time I went there. Don’t judge this place by its appearance because the quality of food that all matters. So if you are planning to go low on budget, you can visit this place without any second thought.

Thumbs up Denzong !!

This place is a little difficult to locate and if not for my cousin sister I wouldn't have been able to locate this gem of a place. Tucked away in a corner inside a lane after the Lord bakery crossing, this serves the best Momo in town and most probably has no competition. I don't know how many people are actually aware of its existence but their food and service is top notch. Can't really be called a restaurant, it's just a hole in the wall where they make these super delicious chicken momos! Their seating area is very small and I have never even tried to sit inside. There's a small grocery shop just adjacent to the place where I usually order a cold drink and with the hot and steamy momos, it makes up for quite a delicious snack in the evening! Also their fried chicken momos are a must try, super juicy and hot! It's yummy alright! They serve and offer a wide range of Chinese dishes which I have never bothered to taste because I can't get enough of their momos! Once I tried their dish called fale which is basically deep fried long extended version of fried chicken Momo and I loved it! The stuffing inside is just the right balance of minced chicken and onions and full of chicken stalk- trust me they have amazing flavours! Also the spicy sauce serve along with this takes the entire dish to another level altogether. It's very very busy most of the time, this place is crammed with students from nearby universities, price is quite reasonable and within 100 bucks you can actually have a filling meal for almost 2-3 people. 
Love this place and keep coming back here from time to time and there's a very good reason why!!

A bite on the momos and the pork fat oozing out of them can make ur day.  The dragon chicken and the mixed chow also tastes good....  Its one of my favourite pocket friendly joint.  A must visit for everyone.

Craving for juicy soft momos? Look no further cuz your search ends here. Been eating here for about three years now and the taste of their momos is still the same old magical. 

I've tried the thukpa and Tenthuk, not too satisfied as it lacks flavour. But at this price is so worth it ! :D 


Happy eating :)

The noodles are yum too at the price they serve. Dragon chicken is also something we dig in. Then also the meatballs are something which is quite filling and tasty.

Have been hearing about this small outlet of great Tibetian/Chinese restaurant since a long time! Finally visited it! I've always wanted to try the Fhaley and it was good, though I would have liked it a bit hotter! The pan-fried momo was delicious, more in the category of a dumpling,and was extremely spicy and hot, just according to my liking! Will go back to try the Dragon chicken once! But the counter should start working on interior and ambiance if it is to compete with the ever growing oriental food corners in the city!
            

REVIEW-II

This time around, it was pre planned fest for us to eat at the lowest possible cost, and eat well! Denzong was the obvious choice! We reached their in the evening at surprisingly it was empty, yes, empty.. no waiting outside, no having food in the streets. Imagine our luck.

We began with The Dragon Chicken, which is a Denzong speciality. It had a sweet aftertaste and was loaded  with cashews. It was good.

Next we went for the Pan Fried Chicken Momo , which was delicious, as usual.

I had to order the Fhaley for my friends. They thoroughly enjoyed the oily deep fried chicken goodness. 

We ended with the Tie Pao, which was the other side of the North Eastern cuisine. This gives us a break from fried spicy idea of that cuisine. This is a pastry of maida, filled with chicken, steamed. It has a light , typical oriental taste. This one is a huge win.

Planning on visiting again soon.

Ok firstly I'm a Momo addict and I can have momos for breakfast lunch and dinner. So now to this place. I wanted to give it a 11 out of 10 it's that good. Best momos in kolkata period. They have thukpa,  shyapta, stuffed buns, meatball fry and all are absolutely superb. The momos have this sort of buttery juice inside which if u consume in one bite you'll get that awesome taste. Must try and really really cheap. I drive for 30-35 mins from home just to have a plate of momo it's that good.

I tried hard to convince myself not to post a review based on a single dish but couldn't help. Considering the price, the quality of momo they serve is exceptionally good. They served momo only with a type of sauce, and not the soup (didn't bother me much as I'm not a big fan of momo-soup). I wanted to start with the basic and so ordered chicken steamed momo. Those were deliciously big, juicy and the stuffing tastes real awesome.
As many people here already said, if you consider restaurant ambiance an integral part of your culinary experience, then this place is maybe not ideal for you. But if you are planning to go low on budget, you can visit this place without any second thought.

Will surely go back for Thukpa and Dragon Chicken.

Undoubtedly the BEST momos you will get in Kolkata. I am a huge fan of the place and keep going back for the fhaley(which is a limited stock offer), gyathuk( which I prefer to thukpa), garlic chicken noodles and chicken shyapta. 
The place may be small but enjoying some delicious momos under the open sky has a charm of its own. Extremely pocket friendly with very humble and polite owner.
Anything below a perfect 5 would be injustice. So see you there!

Even the people who hate Chinese delicacies will find the food interesting.

Denzong Kitchen for me provides the best momos in Kolkata. What makes its momos the best is the authentic flavour it has, very juicy and tastes delicious in its simplicity.  The place is a small eatery, not a decorative place. The ambience would give you a feel of  a college canteen perhaps. Its main attraction is the food it offers in terms of its taste and it is very pocket friendly. It is hard to get good food at such prices these days. I would call it a student friendly place. If you happen to go there, momos are something you must try. Apart from that it doesn't really provide too many dishes. But the ones it provides are yummy and fills your tummy well. Ohh yes, thukpa is another dish that is really good. Kind of a comfort food, light and simple. So my rating is going for the delicious momos and the pocket friendly nature of the dishes.

It has been a while since i have shifted my base from Kolkata and i am writing this review because i am missing this place a lot. An ideal joint for college and school students. Extremely pocket friendly. Very humble and friendly staff & owner. Momos here are simply the best you can get in Kolkata. Chilli Garlic chowmein is also one of my preferred food here. Spring Chicken is a must try. It is totally a different kind of a friend chicken item that you don't get everywhere. There is a small seating area but maximum people prefer to stand outside and eat. If you are planning to visit this place make sure you reach there by 7 or 7:30 or you might be unlucky to miss out on some of the best delicacies in town.

Been there some days back...denzong kitchen really charged up our sweat glands because it took us 30mins or more time walking and locating this place. Me,being a momo lover,this joint was in my wishlist from the day its in zomato's 'great momos' collection. We had heard a lot about the tasty,delicious preparations of this place so he decided to give me a surprise by taking me there and didn't let me know where we were heading to. Tired and exhausted...we finally found this place out and DENZONG KITCHEN it was...!!
We went inside..the place looks simply horrible from inside. We saw broken benches and some tools being arranged with 3-4 round tables. The plaster in the walls were also broken. 2 tube lights lighted the whole place up.
We seated ourselves..there were no menu cards..the menu was stuck up with glue on the wall. Without going through it..we ordered 1 plate chicken momo. Meanwhile...we saw some cockroaches roaming about the room. 5-6 small cockroaches were roaming about just beside me on the bench that i was sitting on. I,being a cockroach-phobic,decided to shift my seat..but somehow managed to remain seated on the same place. From this incident only i realized the hygiene quotient of this place.
The momos took 5mins to appear. 6 pieces with oil seeping down...were perfectly made and stuffed with meat. The soup was also served hot and spring onions accompanied it. From the first bite only we understood why its listed in zomato's great momos....the taste was so perfect. The seeping oil though was a bit let down but the taste still resides in my taste buds.
After finishing off...we proceeded with our order. He ordered 1 plate chilli garlic fried rice for me...the item being one of my favorites. He came back after ordering and complained about the lack of sincerity of work in them. He said that the people working were least interested to take the order and 1 was pushing the other. This is something really not expected from a joint like this...denzong kitchen is one of the well known eateries in kolkata..with such a terrible ambience they attract so many customers...very less places can do that. With lack of sincerity they can easily loose customers as well.
The rice was prepared fast...was served in a maggi bowl:-P The amount was okay but the taste was simply awesome. The big chunks of chicken along with the perfectly cooked rice was a champion in itself...didn't need any accompaniments. It was something that i really savoured. 
The staff can't even pay attention while taking the money...we left the place when we realized that they took 10rs less from us. The staff behaviour and the ambience should have earned them a 1...but the amazing food made up for it and hence a 3.5...:-) but some improvements are certainly needed. Overall an okayish experience.

I love momos and i love denzong. Its a tiny joint and finding the place can be really difficult in some bylane near south city mall. But the find is worth it. The prices are super cheap and the food quality is good. I love finding my way to denzong kitchen everytime im near prince anwarshah!

This place is simply awesome. It is located in a residential area inside a narrow lane and you will not be very impressed by the appearance. But once you taste the food you will crave to visit this place again and again.. The momos are simply delicious..the juiciest ones in the entire town!!! The soup provided with momos is also very unique and tasty!!! The other dishes available like Dragon Chicken and Chicken shyapta are equally delicious!!!!  And most importantly, the place is really cheap!!!!!

Location :- located in a narrow lane of bikramghar a bit difficult to locate..

Ambience:- nothing speacial a small place to seat.

Food:- 
Chicken tie pao:- a bun shaped food item with a layer of chicken and egg filling inside. Need to add sauce on the top after serving to taste better.

Pan fried momo:- tasty spicy and tangy..a must try

Chicken meatball:- somehow i found lack of chicken inside it and it didnt impress me much

Conclusion :- if ur low in pocket money and wanna have some good snacks dis is the ideal place..

This place has ruined every other momo for me.

I love momos, and that is how I chanced to visit here. I ordered veg momos, chicken momos, chicken tie pao, pepper chicken and pan fried momos in schezwan sauce. The momos were wonderful, succulent and just wow. Those were juicy, and just amazing. The tie pao was something I hadn't tried before. It is like a bun, with chicken and egg filling, it tastes good. The pepper chicken was tasty, spicy and mouth watering. The pan fried in schezwan was Okay, I would prefer the steamed one more. And the best part? The cost. It is so damn affordable, without compromising on the taste.

Edit: I went there again, and tried the fried chicken momo and the chicken shyapta. The latter was very different from what I have ever tasted before . it was tangy and saucy, and somewhat like chilli chicken.

Edit: This time I tried dragon chicken, it was hot, red and spicy, garnished with cashews. The taste was okayish, I didn't like it much as I personally don't like sweet stuff that much. The chicken chow was good, but I was so full that I couldn't eat it.

This place is like a  hidden heaven for food Tibetan food lovers. Earlier it was difficult for people to locate the place but now its a well known name even to the auto-rickshaw drivers, they will drop you exactly in front the lane at the end of which this small eatery is there. Here the momos are excellent...the best i ever had. They are extremely tender and a yummy juice oozes out when u bite it. i just loved that. Am yet to taste their other delicacies for which i would definitely visit this place soon.

Do not go by the appearance and location of Denzong. You might not even get a place to sit. But their momos are heavenly. The juicy chicken inside is sure to make your taste buds dance in joy. And try out their Fhaley, MUST. The chicken schezwan chow also deserves a special mention. And most importantly, the price. It is so cheap. If good food is on your mind, but there is not much money in your wallet, this is the place to head for.

I can guarantee you'll fall in love with this place- if you can find it. Their steamed momos are terrific- filled with juicy, flavoured chicken stock that bursts delightfully inside your mouth. Try their Fale (i won't tell you what they are, find out yourself!), fried rice, and chilly chicken. The place is small and the crowds big, though.

This is one is quite a special place for both vegetarian and non vegetarian momos.. They only have one veg option and chicken dishes have various options and variations when comes to Tibetan food.. Momos are great.. Noodles are just about alright and other specialities for vegetarian folks just about momos and noodles .. Worth a try .. And I am sure this place would not be a  disappointment for your tastebuds

I tried the pan fried chicken momo wer as my frnd tried steam one.The size of the momo is xtremely small. I mean u wd get the same thing at other tibetan stalls at a cheaper rate. Yes they taste good but nothing extraordinary. And definitely not worth 60 and 40 bucks respectively. Yes i may have expected more than I should have.

I cannot give anything less than a 5star to Denzong Kitchen. Be it the momos, the phale, the gyathuk, the hakka noodles, there isnt anything that will let you down. You have to come early to get Phales because it is sold out very fast. But they are amazing. No words about the momo. THE BEST IN THE CITY. I am saying this after trying every "best momo in kolkata" . Even if you have to wait for sometime before you get your plate, you must. Its worth it. Cheers !!

Momo's are nice, Faley ( i guess that's what the name is) is average..taste like fried momo but of a bigger version. Could improve the service as it is very slow but cannot complain much to it for a place of this size...very pocket friendly..
Point to be noted: please do not try the soup with the momo's it is just too salty and not upto the mark...

If you are craving for juicy hot steamed momo, Denzong is the place to go. This is one of the best place to have momos. The pan fried momo, steam momos are the best but faley, thukpa are also nice. The price is amazingly low. The place is small but young crowds make it a hep place. Sometimes they takes a lil more time to serve your food but its worth the wait.

I had been to this place few months back when a friend of mine promised me the best momos ever. Being a momo lover i was super excited to be there, but when i reached there the appearance somewhat disheartened me.. But when the delicious momos melted in my mouth with the awesome consistency i simply forgot about the appearance and felt heavenly.  Also tried the thupka and dragon chicken. They were equally good. But i feel the soup could have been better..

Visited denzong's after a long gap with my friends post some printing works. It was buzzing with all the customers around as usual with this place & luckily enough we were able to get 5 seats :3.

We ordered 1 plate of meats balls,panfried momos,tie pao,1 chicken hakka chow & 2 chicken thukpas!! All tasted awesome specially the the meats balls & panfried momos(since it was spicy). The chow was ok but i found the soup of the thukpa was a bit oily to my liking which hindered its taste. The only negative i found was the service as it was slow due to which we had to forcefully cancel 1 thukpa but overall the rest of the food made it up. The overall bill came up to 240 only..

So it was a good food trip altogether along with a priceless adda :)

Tag After reading all the wonderful reviews i was literally dying to visit this place because i am a fan of momos. Finally the day came and i visited this place today with my friend. We had little difficulty to find out the place but found it atlast. Its a small yet busy shop. It also has small seating arrangement but it gets filled up every time. I ordered chicken steam momo Rs. 70/6pcs.
Momo - I just dont get it, how can a dumpling be filled with so much juice inside it ??? Denzong kitchen is the mother of all momos.
Momo Soup - I dont know why but i got the real authentic taste of tibeatean flavours in it.
Momo Sauce - Its really hot though, but i like spicy food but this sauce can give you a zing to your tastebuds
Juicy momos + flavourful soup + momo sauce will surely create an explosion inside your mouth. I looking forward to taste all the items on their menu.

*P. S. The menu which is given in zomato is not updated, prices have been increased per items.

From the  last five years the only change I see is in price i. e from  20bucks to 35bucks it is very obvious I think.. I have tried pan fried momo, thuppa, meat ball,phale chicken fried rise n many think all the dish are good . Very cheap also, Please don't go with the surrounding as it located in a very small lane,but it is very good place for hangouts with friends n girlfriends... ☺????????????

Starting with the ambiance , its a small  shop type restaurant   With few siting capacity inside while most of the people prefer to eat outside . The crowd was good.
This place is famous for momos , and momos were really good with some soup which is mostly provided at every momo corner. !
If you are near tollygunj or jadavpur or anwar shah road , and you love momos then it is a must go place.  #recommended

Firstly, this restaurant is situated in quite an old position, ain't that easy to get there. Secondly, my reason for checking this one is cause of it's flawless reviews. Not only Zomato, but many of my friends, suggested Denzong, especially for enjoying a combo of tasty momos + pocket friendly. Well, my review is not much likely for Denzong. I felt nothing unique in their momos, except the use of butter in them. I tasted Pan fried n steamed momos, & according to me, was average and worthy enough for Rs. 60 n 49/- respectively. I found nothing special in this place as mentioned by others.

Denzong is literally a hole in the wall, in an obscure part of Bickramgarh. I have spent many a day searching for it and then giving up and going on to Jadavpur to drown my sorrow in food. Tip: ask the rickshaw-wallas, they will guide you to this haven of cheap, delicious momos. Also, go early, like 4PM, any later and you might miss out on some of their delightful goodies.

Coming to the food, when I first told my friend about this place that sells steamed momo for Rs 30, you could read the skepticism in her eyes. She was like, what's the catch? 10 minutes and a plate of momo later, the look of skepticism gave way to one of utter bliss. Trust me, they are that good.

My personal favourite is the pan-fried momo, with a garlic sauce you can die for. Try it. You won't be disappointed. The fhaleys (which are just bigger and crunchier momos) are worth a try as well.

They always seem to run out of meatballs every time I go there. Ah, well, there's always the next time, and with this place, there always will be a next time.

Authentic finger licking tibetan momos at dirt cheap prices. dont expect ambience or service. Its mainly flocked by college goers. If you are willing to have momos do visit before 6 pm in the weekend as they are sold out like hot cakes. two times we had to return empty hands. finally one fine sunday we reached before six and thankfully got hot fresh momos.momos are soft n succulent. the stock provided is also fresh n hot.

.5 less than 5 because nothing is perfect, and perfection is boring, which this amazing place Denzong is not. Perfect place for foodies tight on pocket. Great place to catch up with friends for a quick bite. But be prepared to eat on the road as they have a very small sitting area, which is stuffy, but that doesn't matter. The good food and low price would make you overlook the sitting capacity. Do try their momos, phale and thukpas. They also to take away for no extra charge. Try it guys.

Heard about this place many a time. Visited twice & both the time I have tried Chicken steam momos. Its at Vikramgarh, South Kolkata, in a residential area, a bit difficult to find for people who do not know the area well. 

Its a small place, good for take away. They have a place to sit however mostly very crowded. So you have to stand & eat. 

Coming back to the food,  its good. Hot & juicy momos. Their service is good. They serve quite fast. Quite pocket friendly. So if you are looking for yummy & pocket friendly quick momos, this is the place.

At first it looks like a small time street food stall and then you see the crowd waiting to get a taste of those heavenly momos and you understand that Denzong is not just another small time momo shop. And the prices? It is sure to surprise you as to how economical they are. if you want Chinese...Denzong is the place to be.

One of the best in the business when in comes to Momo. The base kitchen of this small and congested fast food center has an amazing touch towards preparing great Tibetan menus. Even Vegetable Chowmien was amazing and quite tasty. The only problem about this superb food center is the space. Its extremely congested, otherwise serves fine food.

I have been frequenting this small joint tucked away in one of the by-lanes of bikramgarh, since a very long time. The favorite hangout for us, whether we are tight on our pockets or otherwise. The price of the food is unbelievably low keeping in mind the taste. The owner is a very friendly guy and the staff, well okay. Much cannot be said about the hygiene. The table tops, the ketchup bottles and even the salt & pepper bottles are forever greasy. I have never ever seen this place empty, no matter what time i went. Its an advice to reach the place by 7pm because most of the food tend to get over by 8pm. Also due to the crowd, they take a lot of time delivering the food. Their seating arrangement has been improved now though it hardly seats a few people at a time. Most of the people cluster around and eat standing. Now coming to the food, their momo is a hit. Though the steamed momo drips oil, but nothing like it. Its more of dumpling shaped and the taste is incomparable. Even the soup that comes with it is so delicious, i can have bowls of just that. My favorite is the fhaley. This gets over earliest but on few lucky occassions they stock more of it. I love these cutlet like things. I have had the thukpa and it is filling and fine. My second favorite is the chicken shwapta. Its a dry chicken thing and goes well with the noodles or rice. The dragon chicken is too spicy. I love their fried momos as well. Infact i have had almost everything on their menu. Be it the chilli chicken or schezwan noodles. Unless youre a big hygiene freak and dont mind a bit of oil everywhere, this place is highly recommended. Cheerie!

Denzong's Kitchen also has a roadside stall on the right outside Gate 4 of Jadavpur University...
Though you won't find the main course dishes like fried rice and other chicken side dishes, items like the momos (steamed and fried, not pan fried), phaley, meat balls, thukpa and chowmein are available :)

Certainly not the best momo joint in the town... But considering the price, the food is sheer delight and hell lot better than the regular momo joints. Best when hanging out with the most 'bukkhar' friends and you are a little tight on the budget. To sum it up, its a great corner to hang out and satisfy your tummy ;) cheers!!!

P.S. Not a great place for people looking for a clean hygenic resturant.

THIS PLACE IS MOMO PARADISE ON EARTH! 
The freshest and juiciest momos I have ever eaten! I have tried dumplings from many places all throughout the length and breadth of the country but this place is definitely my favourite. The owner, Sourav, is personally present in the shop at all times and looks after every individual order. 
Apart from the momos, the Chicken Hakka Chow, Meatball Shyapta and Dragon Chicken are worth trying. Extremely delicious! 
I wish they open up a bigger outlet soon with proper seating arrangements!
The prices of the dishes are total value for money! Thirty rupees for a plate 5 momos is dirt cheap! Thank God for Denzong!

THE BEST MOMO's IN TOWN! Period! One word of caution, be very careful while having your momo, when you take the 1st bite, the juice might just spill out to the person in front of you and cause embarrassment.

Denzong is the classic example of a hell lot of idioms:
1. Looks are deceptive
2. First Impression is not the last impression
3. Don't judge a book by its cover (someone's already written that here btw)
4. All that glitters is not gold (which basically means something that doesn't glitter might just be gold)
...and am sure there are some more.  

Now if a place is always teeming with college goers, it will seldom ever serve bad food. And Denzong basically caters to the young and restless (our kind is probably the exception). I love their momos, dragon chicken, thukpa and tai pao. Served us many a  great and pocket friendly meals when faced with sudden realization of hunger pangs on lazy (and somewhat broke) weekends or an exceptionally irritating day at the office. And I still can't get enough of it!

Would like to start the review with the word which one could say is downright rare for me to use for a place: Awe******some. Please excuse me for being explicit but I couldn't help but say it. 
Like they say, "Don't judge a book by its cover." this is of the same likes. 
Coming to the food 'specifically', I can vouch for the momos, for they are genuinely awesome. Also had the meatballs and 'phalé', which were as good. 
What wins the whole ball game are the prices- Woah! One can easily fill up in just ₹100. #simplylovetheplace

Okkay Denzong kitchen jumped higher than expectation. Quality food with over friendly service !

Ambience n interior : As obvious..! If u expect to have a quiet candlelit dinner, then go opposite to denzong ! Very small carpet area, but a nyc place for friendly hangouts nd loud addas ! And even if u r not that lucky to grab a million dollars' seat, u can njoy the food standing outside.

Food : Quality nd quantity are good enough ! Ordered many dishes ! But STEAM MOMO is surely a must try ! 30 bucks for heaven fr sure ! Only Dragon chicken we had, was not that good I guess !
Service : Is disorganized ! And I am okkay with it. The kind of rush they experience, it's fine fr me.
Special mention : steam chicken momo ! So moist..soo moist ! :)
Njoy..cheers!

Denzong Kitchen what can I say? Well they serve you the best momos in the town arguably. Cheap like anything. The quantity they serve as in likes of chow n side dishes half plate would satisfy your need. Preparation is awesome, different and yeah tasty like anything. No proper din in space but the quality and quantity of food will make you neglect this issue. Good food n good experience every time I visit this place..

This little place may not be much of a family place but a perfect hangout for students such as myself. It is not only light on the pockets but also a food-i-licious experience.
My personal favourite includes the steamed momo....so succulent and delicious that it keeps you and your taste buds lingering for more.

But 1 point of notice is that someone really needs to invent a marauder's map to find the place. I had only heard of this place initially through word-of-mouth but the effort required to find the place is worth it.

I remember when Denzong's was a mythical, word-of-mouth place, impossible to find if one didn't have a 'guide' who was in the know. Severaltimes, in those first months of Denzong's existence, I had wandered into the bylanes off the 8B -Tollygunj auto route, absolutely certain I was on the path to 'that shop', only to end up in front of a corner grocery shop, frustrated and puzzled. 

Even with all that trouble, Denzong's was worth it. Us JU-types practically saw this place come up from scratch, and many of our precious twenty and fifty bucks have been invested in his shop, in exchange for its divine deliciousness. Even in those cash-strapped days, Denzong's offered us filling meals of their steamed momos - absolutely wonderful specimens! - gyanthuk, phalay (kill me, but I like deep-fried pockets of flavoured meat), and on days we could pool together some extra cash, their dragon chicken and shyapta (with the bao to dip into it). Of course, the mosquitoes in and around the little blue room feasted on us, but what's life without a little give and take?

It's been two years that I've been to Denzong's last - I no longer live in Kolkata - but I love that it has so many glowing tributes on Zomato. The favourites, I see, have remained the same: steamed or fried momos, gyanthuk, dragon chicken, noodles, phalay. If you're looking for a fantastic steal of a Tibetan place, or a newbie thinking of trying 'authentic' Tibetan food (as authentic as it gets in Calcutta, anyway), I would most definitely recommend Denzong's. The place might be a little hard to find, and service might be somewhat indifferent than pricier places, but the food will be worth your every effort.

I'm tired of taking my boyfriend to this place but he isn't tired of their momos.

Food: It is indeed one of the best momo shops of Kolkata. Both veg and non-veg momos are extra-ordinary. There is something in their recipe that adds that "tasty" factor which is missing in many costlier momos. There are many other items too available here. The chicken thukpa is very delicious with visible chunks of chicken in the bowl whereas veg thukpa is very mediocre. The chicken fhale is fairly good but the chow mein is mediocre. Their sauce is tasty yet verrry spicy so don't go greedy before you taste it! The quantity of food is sufficient. They are extremely high in demand so make sure you reach there by 8pm or they will run out of stock. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: The place is actually pretty dirty but because of its great food quality and extremely affordable rates people don't care much about it. It does have a small unclean room with some chairs and tables but people mostly prefer a take away or at most eat while standing or sitting on the walls or their bikes/cars parked outside the shop. I personally feel no matter how small scale their business is, they should pay some attention to the cleanliness factor. At least the front counter should be taken care of. I rate it 3/5.

Service: They are truly always bombarded with a huge rush of customers but they deal it with full patience and an assuring smile. In peak hours your food might take some time to arrive but with such limited staff they are really doing their best. The owner/manager becomes really friendly with you once you become a regular. I rate it 4/5.

Price: The price is really low... Like very very low. There is no chance you can't afford it. You can fill your stomach and even overeat with ₹60-80.

Overall, I rate it 3.5/5.

Placed an order for chicken steamed momo and chicken thukpa......umm thukpa was piping hot and filled with minced chicken and chicken chunks and oodles of noodles! ! Subtly spiced and mildly flavoured. Tasty and filling. ..
Momo was bite sized, juicy , fluffy and tasty filling. Served with hot n spicy schezwan sauce along with amazingly tasty and mild soup!!!
Had to wait for 30 mins for the food and space constraint, waited outside the shop. But when the food arrived, it was heaven!!
Pocket pinch was only 60/-

I have finally found the ultimate hang out corner with friends when hungry and low on cash. People this place is very cozy. Its crowded every time with students mostly all assembled in groups chitchatting on the street. Its more like a little stall or food counter, the kind you find in a fair usually. Food is mouthwatering. They have the tastiest chicken steamed and fried chicken momos. I love their garlic chicken and chicken hakka noodles too. Just carry 100 bucks with you and your dinner is all set. Extremely economical food joint this one is with delicious Tibetan and Chinese food.

Bang for the buck ! Not so convenient eating/dining place but people are found more outside spread across the lane standing and having their fill which speaks a great deal about the food. Authentic Chinese/Tibetan dishes and flavors. Try the tai Pao and chicken gyathuk along with your regular momos.

Review edit as of July2016. Quality has dropped. Not an awesome place for food as it used to be. Anyway still goes okay !

The momos are very traditionally tastey at very economical price. They are very succulent and are always served fresh and steamed. You basically get six momos with the traditional chilli garlic sauce but if you request soup, you get it for free.

The chowmein had the smell of fried oil in and was not that good.

Dragon chicken was tastey but toooooooo hot which made tears run down my cheeks and I ran for water water water and some more water.

Chicken Thukpa: priced at 50 bucks. The amount fills your tummy. The taste is awesome. It's clear and loaded with fresh veggies and chicken chunks.

Chicken shyapta: it's a denzong special. It's a side dish consisting of many big shreds of chicken in a dry gravy of garlic, bell peppers and onions. It's really something new and should be tried at least once. At 100 bucks.

Chicken tie pao: it's big oval sized bun. The outer layer is dense bread like. The filling within has chicken in onions and capsicum with slices of boiled eggs. It's dry so you need a side dish to go with it. At 50bucks.

Fried momo in garlic sauce: the sauce has a lesser garlic and more chillis in it. Not my favourite. It's average though.

Chicken faley: it's a big sized fried momo served with chili sauce. The cover is crispy. The filling is delicious. It's good.

Egg chicken thukpa: it tastes better than the chicken thukpa. Comes at RS 10/- extra than the chicken thukpa.

Nice place for quick bites with friends.

A tuition friend first introduced me to "Sourav Da's momo joint". My first impression of it from a few yards distance was not extraordinary. But it changed when I took my first bite from my first Denzong's momo. It changed the way I used to look at momos. The taste, the price, the location were all as eccentric as the owner-cum-chief. Then I went on to taste the filling thukpa and the other delicious dishes within a month or so. Probably a very busy place but if you get a chance to talk to the owner ask him about how he made it from being a science student from the hills of West Bengal to the lord of street momo in south Calcutta, its a bonus.

Near my house,so visit it quite often for a nice evening snack or sometimes a take away dinner when I'm short on cash. Their momos is the most popular item on the menu,and though the taste is inconsistent,they're good most of the time. Phalays and thukpas are also good and everything is very cheap,hence perfect for students with budgets.

We had a very hard time to locate this place. But when reached there, we were just amazed by its crowded customers. Its a very cozy one by appearing but still peoples were fighting to get over a seat. And those who were unable to get a seat were standing outside & having there food. Now about the food. Its fantastic. I mean i have heard the rumor that it tastes very good but was satisfied when ate there. We ordered 2 steam momo, 1 fried momo, 1 chicken noodles, 1 dried chilli chicken, 1 chicken thukpa. To be honest i really haven't ate that good food for a long time. The taste was really nice. Every bite mesmerized me. The quantity was fair but the superseding factor was its taste. Though we have to wait for the food for 5 min but it was worth it. And also it was selling so fast that they were really unable to cope with the situation. Well only thing that pissed me is the location. But the quality they serve, i could make an exception for this one & would like to visit it again & again.

I don't understand why people go all mad about denzong (i call it sourav's). The momos are steamed with too much of dalda. Also, their meatballs are more about the flour than meat. But i have to admit that the thukpa they make is by far the  most delicious in Calcutta and pocket friendly as well.

always the best place to hang around with great food. pockets smile even after trying every dish from this place. since i visit the northern part of the state a lot, i crave a lot of tibetan food at times. the thukpa with pipping hot noodles and a hearty broth just cures any kind of discomfort. do i need to mention the authentic kind of juicy, and i mean super juicy momos they make. i'd say one would get sikkim standard momo here, the best momo i think in kolkata other than the territti bazaar. and the noodles and rice are also out of the world. the meetballs and everything else in the menu is good. and and and my favorite phaley always tops the list. yyumm!!

Momos. We come here for them. 
We've literally stood in the rain, underneath the blazing sun and withstanding night bugs, just so we could eat their wonderful, utterly-sumptuous, juicy momos. 

Been an ardent fan of this steamed or fried delicacy, I've had my share all over Calcutta but I'm yet to find a place which could beat the ones of this particular place. 

Thin dough, with a moist lightly-aromatic filling and steamed to juicy perfection.. It's pretty close to my momo heaven, alright.

It's a place where you never mind waiting on the road to get your food and then gulp them down as soon as the food arrives. The momos here are one of the most authentic, filled with chicken and juicy. Thukpa and phalay are also good. The noodles have not been a favourite of mine as they smelled of flour and were not cooked properly both times we took them. It's very cheap and good not only for students but all foodies alike!

Chicken momos are a perpetual hit in my friend circuit and so when this name came up I just had to try.It was awesome,small place so might just take away and enjoy at home.Stock finishes early so might as well jump before you lose your turn!!! :D Stock lasts 6-8pm max generally.

The best roadside Momo serving eaterie I have come across. Dirt cheap and taste is impeccable. The only minus point is the location. Better than Hamro momo and momo plaza.

I started going to Denzong since 2011, and  have never stopped. They offer one of the best chicken momos in town. Also the dragon chicken is something I like very much about it. Location wise it is a bit difficult to get to and if you are looking for an air conditioned place then you will be disappointed. But for foodies like me, have momos , phaleys it is the place to be. And here is the best part, its super cheap and the quality of food is good too.

One of the most pocket friendly food joint in Jadavpur.... They serve delicious and hot momos all the time.... Dragon Chicken is one of the most tasty and their unique serving... Whatever you have.... the bill for 2 never crosses 200(it is always way too less).... I have tried almost all the platters they serve and I really enjoy the thupka, faley, tai pao along with their momo....

But the sitting facility is not too great and clean...the only con for this place

A friend of mine told me about this place. He said " You may not recognize the place easily for the tricky location but trust me, you will love the food." I must say, he was absolutely right. The food is awesome. Specially the momo. The Tibetan dishes are also good. But the best part is that the price is ridiculously cheap.Surely, a must go place.

The food is brilliant! Every item is served steamy hot! From the momos to the noodles and chicken main dishes, everything is worth it! I'd highly recommed the Tai Pao, its an entire lunch for one person!

this place clearly states that if you serve good food you really don't need any kind of fancy decoration for your restaurant to be famous.... i'm not really sure whether to call it a restaurant or not.... it provides sitting arrangements for only max to max 10 people..... and there is only very ordinary plastic chairs and tables..... but once you have the momo in  your mouth you are sure to forget everything else in the world..... if you are momo lover then is the place for you... and if you know someone who does not like momo bring them to this place and i'm sure they will become a momo lover too....... the best and  cheapest momo you will get at this place....do try it for once and you will not be able stop yourself from going there again and again...
p.s. also try chicken shapta if you are in love with spicy food

Close ur eyes and let the food flavours tease you. Momos should be put in wholly in your mouth. That's all. If u r complaining about the ambience.. We'll say.. We don't care. No real food lover would. To more places like these. Woohoo!

The rating is solely for the food they serve. There are still food joints in kolkata where people detest the idea of going and sittting in the chilled air conditioned rooms to have their food. This is one such joint where hoards of people-young and old come in for the quality of food they prepare. A north kolkata girl gets attracted to a south kolkata road side joint and the reason being? MOMOS. I love tibetian food anytime and everytime they are served to me. And finally I could persuade my lazy loads of mughlai loving friends and just dragged them off to this joint post a south city visit. The easiest way to reach however is by hailing an auto heading to jadavpur 8B from tollygunje metro. Getting down at bikramgarh harisabha math and walk straight right. And there is the crowded denzong kitchen. Initially I thought we had to stand and eat. But there are seating arrangements in a small little room inside. The floors are all slimy, nil ambience. You may feel cramped as not even a fan works properly in that congested room and you get lovey-dovey bites from mosquitoes. Wait till the food arrives and I bet you will stop complaining. We decided on a plate of momo, tai poband meat balls. However by 6 pm tai po and meet balls were over and our only solace was the plate of momos. So we decided to go in for gyathuk and 2 plates of momos. The gyathuk arrived first. Stuffed with chicken. The noodles swimming in the red soup. The taste was good , however too much of ginger marred the real taste of gyathuk. A bit more garlic and less ginger would have made all the difference. And then the momo arrived. I pounded upon the momo. It was hot. Superbly tasty. Succulent.  The broth could actually be sucked out and eaten. And it was damn tasty. 2 plates of momo was not enough. Ordered for too more. Our tummies were filled but our heart craved for more. The taste still resides. Till date tibetan delite was my pick for the best mkmks in town. But definitely from here on , denzong happens to be the moml hub for me. And I would definitely run back for the momos.

the best momo i hav ever had is in denzong.. guys i am telling the truth. jst eat once. after eating momo. u should go for chicken Thukpa which is simply delicious nd healthy too.. if u love sukha kinda food u must go for Thaipao.
if u like hakka noodles u shud try chicken noodles.. it is good too.. 
nd last but not the least guys go nd explore all those foods :)

Succulence is the word that would come out of your mouth instantly when you gorge on some gorgeous looking dimsums. This tiny little cramped up joint is located just opposite to Harisabha's maath in Bikramgarh. It is overshadowed by another joint at the brim of the lane but it is not overshadowed in quality and popularity. That lane is always crowded with friends, couples and the likes gorging on some delicacy or the other dished out by the Denzong kitchen.

I would not have believed my friend, J, who is currently located at Pune if I wouldn't have tasted the food there. The momo there spells and screams out JUICE. You take one bite and that transforms and melts into your mouth. The one left in your starts to droop down and melt again showing the majestic skill with which it has been prepared. You absolutely cannot avoid the juice left all over your plate. Not to forget the accompaniment, the soup. It is almost like a consomme, a clear soup that refreshes the very heavy momos.

Denzong actually provides every youngsters with two 'G's : Gossip and Gorge. 

The only downside of this joint would be the fact that it is very small and people who are utterly tired and would like a place to sit while eating, could be disappointed. But nevertheless, small place speaks out coziness, ain't it? Also not to forget the extremely less pocket pinch of this place. One plate momo would cost you just Rs 30/- only and a double plate would cost you Rs 60/-. So a mere sum of Rs 100 would fill your stomach with good food and contentment.

I kept on visiting Denzong after my first visit and would continue doing so. Denzong is just a stone throw from my house and succeeds with excelling marks in quenching my sudden crave for momos.

Been there. Done that.
After college, my dimsum love was ransacking my brains and my friend M, who loves dimsums suggested we should definitely go to this joint.
As i college-goer I really cannot afford posh joints all the time and going by his description, Denzong was pretty shady and shady it was. Pretty hot inside. Almost like a hole in the wall.

WAIT. GO ON OKAY.

We ordered two plates of momo. They came in about 5 minutes. With ketchup. I started whining about the soup. That followed about 10 minutes later.
The soup : clear and mild, tasted different. Not thick and creamy unlike any other joint. I perceived it as an amazing dish for a sore throat. Light and aromatic.

The dimsums : Cute and extremely adorable. One bite and its gone.
Chicken bursting inside. The properly minced chicken, veggies, the onions. You will be able to detect every flavour inside. Bit sized and amazing.

After the first plate, we decided to order two more plates because one plate wasn't enough to satiate my greed that evening.
The second plate vanished in about a few minutes.
AMAZING is the word for this joint. 

Tolerate the heat and the not-fine-at-all ambience if you want  lovely dimsums at your table!

Pocket crunch : 200 for two.

Ours was billed at INR 120/-

Will be back real soon.
Cheers! :)

Its not a proper restaurant. So people going with a large group & looking for a dine in,will be upset.You'll have to stand & eat. A simple as that. It looks like an ordinary tibetian momo shop. It doesn't even have its name printed on the shop.So don't go by the looks. If u love chinese & tibetian then this place is highly recommended. 
Denzong Kitchen is by far the best momo seller in South Kolkata & the taste is mouth watering.
It gets quite crowded in the evening and you have to knock a few times to get your food.
The things I love about denzong :-
1. MOMO( both fried & steam)
2.Phaley 
3.Thukpa
4.Chowmein

The place is a bit tricky. Its located in a small lane opp to Bikramgarh Club.
Thanks to Saurav bhaiya (Saurav Karkee),the owner of Denzong Kitchen for having such a place when I'm hungry ^_^

Chilling out with friends has never been so budget-friendly before...!!!
This place  is trickily located. The best way to go to this place would be to take a Tollygunge Metro Station bound motor-operated three-wheeler from Jadavpur (the three-wheeler stand is pretty close to the Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand) and ask the driver to drop you by Bikramgarh Club; the food outlet is located a few paces inside the alley almost bang opposite the club. 
The place may look like a take-away joint, but upon careful inspection, the spatially limited seating area would come to one's notice.
The items we ordered were:
(1)  Chicken Momo (4 plates)
(2) Chicken Gyathuk (5 plates)
(3) Chicken Meatballs (1 plate)
The Momo came with a never-tasted-before delicious soup and peanut sauce (which was a tad chilly). The buttery flavour of the Momo gives it an edge over what are available at other food joints or restaurants. The Gyathuk came in a relatively large bowl; it contained (apart from the long sliced chicken pieces) noodles, scrambled eggs, capsicum, french beans, onions and ginger (the last three finely chopped). One needs to add the salt separately accordingly to his/her taste. The Meatballs were soft; it shall taste better when savoured hot and fresh.
It is a self-service joint nonetheless.
Overall, a good place to drop in with friends to assuage ravenous tummy when one has got limited budget, but he/she will never be disappointed with neither the quality nor the quantity of the dishes.

If you are low on budget, want to have something that is tasty, fullfilling and will force you to come back again, then this is the number one spot for you in the city. The sitting arrangement is not at all comfortable, and practically there is no sitting place, but the food that will be given to you will make up for that loss. The momos are exquisite and the chowmin is out of this world. Have been to this place a lot and I almost regularly have cravings for this place. Its closed on Thursday I guess, I have found it closed on Thursdays a lot of times. Highly recommended for foodies.

It is absolute gem tucked away in the gully of vikramgarh. 
Best time to go there is around afternoon as it stays a bit less crowded. And while u r their even if u have to wait a bit u should not leave without trying their chicken streamed Momo and falay. I am sure once u have tried it u will b back for more.

This isn't a proper restaurant. There aren't home delivery services. Heck, the hygiene points on this one would almost be zero. But this tiny shack in the middle of a quiet neighborhood in Jadavpur packs quite a punch. 
They have one of the best momos i've had in Kolkata. Denzong is a place me and my friends flock to whenever we have a craving for momos or our pockets are almost empty. 
The steam momo is the signature dish here, and people queue up for almost 30 minutes at times to grab a plate. 
Light, juicy and tender, the momos will melt in your mouth and you would be addicted to it. 
Perfect for those winter evenings when you are out with friends. 

Must try- Chicken steam or fried momo, Chicken falle, Thukpa, Kung Pao chicken.

I have been a regular visitor to this place for quite some time. The place is nothing fancy, the prices are really low and the food is simply delicious. :) Their momos are extremely juicy and soft but my personal favorite is the phaley. It's kind of like a huge fried momo with a really tasty filling. The chowmein is also pretty good. The one minus point of this place is that it adds too much oil to the food. I don't have much of a problem with it, but I know people who have.

I goes here at least once in a week from they started this food joint. People who work in there is really nice, always answer your question with a smile and the food is really AWESOME. I have tried each an every item of the menu all are my favorite except one.... That is PHALEY, because this item is deep fried more like fried momo but this one is bigger than the momo. Main reason for dislike is its deep fried and the some oil is stayed in the pocket of that item but apart from that its taste rally good, but as its have a personal reason for my dislike, that's why I have given 4.5/5 otherwise this food joint is really deserve 5/5

at an extremely low price if you look for authentic Tibetan treat it is the place. some may call it momo joint but it's something more for sure. as they prepare some unique Tibetan cuisines and fun munches from thupka to falle which had long been unfamiliar to us and manages to  hold up the genuine aura about their food. also the quantity is huge to satisfy a hungry stomach. my personal favourite has been meat ball & their rare pan fried momos. but what they fail is to meet the demand & often runs short. there's always a thick local crowd or student's thronging around the shop from early hours like 4pm. i have been there with my buddies but mostly preferred to take the food home & enjoy it there in the ac because it's more of a road side stall than a sitting-dining restaurant. & when you have their hot chow (which is a rarity for it's taste & thickness) or a bowl of steaming soups or thupka, it's a bliss. i am eagerly waiting to try their rice & tie pao, & so far i have found reasons to go gaga over their foods - snacks & main course ( though not the side dishes except for their dragon chicken) which get sold like hot cake.

I had no idea that a Tibetian restuarant existed near Jadavpur area (more specifically its Vikramgarh). One of my friends first introduced me to this place & instanly I fancied it & felt like "from now on I will be coming here for lunch break" :P :P This small yet cosy road side eatery serves everything tibetian be it chicken thukpa, meat balls, chicken falle to chicken kung pao..everything just tastes awesome thanks to their use of special kinds of herbs & a special sauce (which can also be taken with momo). A great place to fill your tummy without burning too much of your precious pocket money!! The only drawback is that it doesn't have a proper seating arrangement & is located in a 'para' rather than on a main road, so it misses many of hungry travellers' eyes!!

The fried chicken momos are just wonderful. 6 dumplings for 60 bucks. Thats a steal!  The seating area inside always seems to be packed with J.U people :-D 
I also tried the Chicken Phalay, which was very filling. Looked like a.huge chicken fried momo, tasted the same too. No complaints at all.

I've been to Denzong Kitchen before it became such a 'cool' place to visit. Back when these guys were just starting the place, it was a simple fast food joint serving only momos and thukpas. That humble beginning has now given way to a spot of popularity that is not entirely unfounded. The food tastes legendary here. Their biggest pull is the fact that you can trust the food to be authentic and taste just the way it should be. All the guys working are from the north eastern region and know the cuisine well. The area being one with a large north eastern student population, there's a significant number of establishments run by them. This includes food joints. Try them out for comparison if you want. Apart from the usual items they have started making fries such as the Chicken Tie Pao, Chicken Fhaley and Meatballs. Fried Rice and Chowmeins have also been introduced. Also, look out for the few dishes on the menu such as the Chicken Shyapta : boiled chicken cooked in a spicy broth with an assortment of dice cut vegetables and Dragon Chicken : a new take on our humble Chili Chicken.

The time I went here, I had a simple plate of pan fried momos which tasted super probably owing to the fact that they were spicy and hot as hell. It was devoured after a lot of tears. :)

The establishment is a shop at the ground floor of a building which houses the cooking area. There are no permanent seats although it's planned in the near future. There are however a number of chairs on the road in front. Apart from that small hitch, there's nothing that I don't really like. The service is fast and the crockery is hygenic. Prices are average. That's all you can ask for in a shop this small.

Chakraborty Tips : I'm a bit irritated at the fact that every other foodie has complained about directions to this place yet none have taken the trouble to actually give it...

Situated deep within the bowels of Bikramgarh, it's a toil to reach. Rickshaws are however readily available. Ask the fare before hopping on. The place well known, so don't hesitate to ask the locals. Best way to reach is by auto along the Jadavpur 8B - Tollygunge Metro Station route. Get off at the 'Mondir er maatth' and head right along the alley opposite the playground. A short walk later among the winding bylanes, you reach Denzong.

If you are wanting to eat and eat some more good Tibetan/Chinese food, this place is a must-visit on your list of restaurants. It's a tiny non air-conditioned room and located in the most tangible roads deep inside the locality of Bikramgarh, a 10 minutes ride via auto from Jadavpur 8B Bus-Stand. You will be full and you'll be trying out at least 3 dishes in just one hundred bucks.
However, this place doesn't have a name-board, so it might be a little difficult to locate the shop.

Tucked away in a narrow south Calcutta street behind South City Mall, this place can be quite hard to locate especially for people from other parts of the city. Meant strictly for college students on a budget, this place wont win any awards for cleanliness and hygiene and neither is it too spacious on the inside. But the points it loses on the hygiene front, it quickly makes up (well, to a certain extent) for the quality of food they serve for the price they are charging. I really wanted to try the chicken phaley but unfortunately by the time we got there, it was over and that meant a long wait since the kitchen is small and they have to cater to a lot of customers and a lot of different preparations at the same time. So we had to settle for the steamed momo. It was strictly decent at 30 bucks a plate with 5 momos. But despite of all that, this place has a nice charm to it and I am definitely going back for the phaleys.

so i read a lot about this place on zomato as to how good and all it was... i went there on Sunday at around 5 30 for a quick bite and wanted to taste the momo and the thukpa.... 

finding this place is a little tough and we used the maps of Zomato (god bless) and it took us there with no trouble at all...

now this place has no boards or anything informing you where it is... it is a small shop and the seating area is smaller still... we went there for the food only... 

my initial thought was to pack the food and take it home reheat and enjoy in the AC as it was very hot... so we gave an order or 2 Veg Momo... 1 Pan Fried Veg Momo and 2 Thupkas... 

we were informed that pan fried momos are not available and the veg thukpa will take an hour to make... so we said fine give us a chow and some veg dish.... even that was not possible for them...

so in the end we decided to chuck the plan to pack food and ordered for 4 veg momos... now we were told that maybe 2 plates would be possible but definitely not 4.... 

travelling all the way to this place for the momo we were like lets atleast eat a plate of the same... 

so we waited for 10 mins and then our momos were given... one plate had one less momo as they ran short... so thats 9 momos total...

now they don't serve any soup for veg momo at all... so it was just the momo... 

the momo tasted nice and was pretty good... the down side was that it was superbly oily and very ill made... chunks of maida were there which made it not so great... secondly the momos were just not hot enough... we ate the plate in like 2 mins cause there was no need to cool it down or anything.... the momo sauce is not authentic and is made with a lot of red chilli sauce bought of the shelf... 

as for the price tag i guess the ratings are this high cause this place is like SUPER CHEAP!!!! means i could not believe when he told me my bill amount... i thought he must be joking or something and confirmed... but yes it is actually this cheap... so kudos to that...

i guess this place does serve good food or food at all but i think it is in the majorly non veg department and they don't give too many veg items due to the sale and ratio... which is sad cause i love Tibetan food but they just did not keep...

for me being a vegetarian this place is definitely not on the list of places to go and can be normally avoided by vegetarians.... 

after eating that 1 plate we went to grub club which was the only place that popped for some thukpa and momo...

i was really disheartened cause i was looking forward to this place and was waiting to try the momos there after reading everyone's reviews.... but it was not to be...

This is my favourite food joint probably in the entire world! The momos  are to die for! They make these amaaaazing chicken steam momo which always have a kind of oily juice inside it that makes it delicious and the best momo in the world. The thukpa is very warm and filling and the must try is the shyapta. If you are young with mot much care about grandeur, if you love momos and everything Chinese, this is THE place to be!

Ever had a momo so tasty, so juicy so yum,that its taste lingers in ur mouth for days to come, even if you have still visit DENZONG u l not be disappointed.

This is turning out to be one of th best to have sprung up nearby ,the joint might be a bit shabby for some , but once you bite in one of the momos you wont be worried about anything else around. They serve tibetan cuisine - Momos ,thukpa , shyapta etc etc which i am sure you are all familiar with. The special mention here has to be the momos which is their Rachmaninoff's 3rd , you have to wait for sometime to get a platefull,so its better to order 2 3 plates altogether at once, 30 bucks a plate . The momos are hot as always as they are constantly making them n selling , the stuffing is fresh and if you bite into it a explosion of juices awaits to dazzle your tastebuds. I GURANTEE ONE THING NO1 WILL STOP AT ONE PLATE.

VERDICT - None too fancy, difficult to find , pocket friendly , amazing momos i dnt knw abt othr dishes nor do i care much . Visit if u a momo fan like me.

DIRECTION- OK listen carefully , take an auto from 8B jadavpur , the ones which go towards tollygunge , and say u want to get down at HARISHABHA" you will see on the right a temple with a small park , and on the left there is a lane dont take it go ahead anothr lane on the left awaits you, take it n you are there .

Small and non descript place without even a signboard indicating its name.Until you know exactly how to reach, you would definitely not find it.
Only a very small room with an open kitchen, it is most suited for takeaway.I went there after reading the reviews, and ordered steamed chicken momos and shyaphale.I asked for the meatballs as well, but they were over.
The shyaphale was very oily, a big crescent shaped deep fried momo, with the usual stuffing.It was tasty, but a bit too oily for my taste.With every bite, oil was drizzling down my fingers.It was priced cheap at Rs20/- per piece,

The steam momos were excelent.The best I have tasted so far at this price and I'm forced to say even at much higher price.With fillings of real chicken and not the onion and ginger, the seasoning was so good, I immediately craved for another plate.They were not too dry or thick, doughy skinned, two things which I dread whenever I try steam momo.

I would definitely like to taste the other dishes, pan fried momos and meat balls in particular.However, their noodles didnt look too appetising for me.They were preparing somebody's order and I felt they were putting way too much sauce.

This place is located in the interiors of Bikramgarh so it took sometime for us to locate this place. This food joint didn't had any flex or any kind of hoarding in front with the name written in it. Thanks to my friend's GPS and the crowd in front of the restro we came to know that this is the place. As it was too late and we had to reach home so we restricted our food order to Pan fried momos only. The place was crowded with too many orders coming from here and there and so it took a long time to get our order. But all our thoughts and complains were gone when we tasted the momos. It was too good. We love spicy food and this was just the kind of food we were expecting at that moment of time. I am looking forward to visit this place again in near future and try their other items.

For MOMOS and MOMOS and MOMOS... its a 4.5!!
Its was kept a secret for a real long time from me and others( see only 60 reviews!)... but i hope not from today... 
The difficult part is the location: People coming from jadavpur, take the tollygunge bound auto and get down at bikramgarh exactly behind south city apartments, beside a small pond. ask some teenager about denzong and surely they will know. People coming from golf green take the left from the juncture of golf green road at the point of bharat petroleum building and go till again you reach the small pond and take right and reach the denzong... the heaven for momo, be sure to reach before 5pm cause momos can be over soon. 
Wat to order now, the easy part -- Definitely order MOMOS in any form, steamed, fried, pan fried any and they taste brilliant!
Order thukpas and meatballs. Order noodles and rice with any side dish and you will love it. 
There will be no pocket pinch. SO go ahead and enjoy !

As soon as u put them in ur mouth, they burst with the hot juice inside it and their the magic starts completely tantalizing ur taste buds and leaving u with a craving for more..

Denzong has opened a new establishment near Jadavpur University , gate no 4.That is why on my way to University after a long time, I got this opportunity to visit this place. I had their Steamed Chicken Momo at lunch and Chicken Thukpa around 5pm on the same day. As far as their Momo is concerned, I can say this fact that this was the best Momo at this cost like one plate for thirty bucks. It was soft, tender and succulent. The Momo sauce and  the soup both were equally satisfying. Their  Momo is different from the rest of Momo joints in Jadavpur as the filling inside the Momo is quite different from the others. Later, i also had their Thukpa at evening. Thukpa was also well made. The guy , who serves food is quite hospitable. They serve authentic Tibetan food at a decent price. I can end up by saying that Denzong made my day.

I am kinda off-regular customer to this place. Me and my fellows generally have quite a evening delight here multiple times in a week. Yesterday I went there and enjoyed as usual our 2 plate momos. But I my taste bud and tummy wasn't all satisfied and my eyes looking for some more food. So i ordered this huge wheat ball called Tie-PO ,then I realized how much money I have wasted in momo. Cause this tei-po is all over my head now and can't even think anything else than this :)

Denzong serves the best momos in kolkata.It is the perfect place to go to for an after-college snack. I go there at least once in a week. I have tried almost everything that is on their menu.The place is tiny but the food,especially the meatballs,is to die for. And I can guarantee that you will go back again once you have tasted the soft,juicy mouth watering momos. The phaley and tai pao are good as well. But nothing beats the chicken garlic chow.

Almost two years ago I was excitedly told about this 'amazing' food place called Denzong by a friend. I went self hunting for the place and was amazed because every man knew where it is and directed me all along the 8B to tollygunje auto route. I expected a restaurant but then, Denzong stood there as a small eatery. 

Every student around south kolkata knows this place by now. They serve amazing juicy dumplings. However, the food is a bit oily. The meat balls are also wonderfully made. I have always admired how the thukpa looks just so perfect. I could not try sadly because getting a place here is next to impossible, especially after 5 in the evening and I want to eat it in comfort. Have to take away soon.

I have mostly stood, ate and admired the momos here. I don’t like the fact that you will have to ask for the soup to get the soup with momo which other roadside joints provide without asking.

But there is some magic about the fillings which would make you want to come back here time and again. One of the best momo places in town. And pocket friendly too. 

-.5 for the sitting places or atleast chairs or stools that are really required in more number here.

Tried Denzong after years, at my alma mater's fest this month. Jadavpur University has probably been majorly responsible for making this place as popular as it is today:D  Fantastic egg chow mein (since I don't eat meat anymore). My friend swears by their shafalay and pork momo as well.

I first visited this place, with a friend from Jadavpur University. This small garage converted into a take a way, with a small dining area, is strategically placed behind south city mall, which is home to a large number of students hailing from the north eastern states. Over the years, most of JU students have made this place there usual hangout for eating the reasonably priced momos, thukpas, soups , noodles...

Location:

When travelling from lords xing towards golf green, take a left from the first traffic signal. On travelling about 300-400 mtrs you will find a small park on the left. Take the small alley on the right, opposite to the park, leading up to this small eatery in a garage space.

Food: reasonably priced, tasty, the steamed momos is their fastest selling.

Verdict : chinese/tibetan eatery for primarily students & youngsters on a tight budget.

On one hand I am stunned by the beauty of this food joint and its specialty being serving quality momos and thukpas at throwaway prices and the other hand they serve the worst ever noodles you can think of.....
Ah!!! Me and my off-beat starts.... Ok Denzong is a small eatery, very very small tucked away in the by lanes of Bickramgarh....
The first time visit was with a friend on the bike and me being the most "BHITU" person when it comes to bikes did not notice the road so on my next visit had to be directed by my cousins. It is  so remotely located that you would need to know well of the particular direction to be able to locate it....
Now it is one eatery I force everyone(known to me) around my area till south city, to accompany me and was a major hit his year in the winters for me as I had visited it at least 7 times. 
Now normally I settle for the tried and tested chicken momo...At times I have tried out the odd veg one too.... A plate costs you only Rs. 30 and has dumpling sized momos and it is beautiful, mesmerizing, filled till the brim with chicken and oh so soft.... At that price you cannot and I repeat you cannot get anything better....
The Tai Pao is one huge round ball of momo (read awesomeness) filled with eggs and it's just too too good.
It became such a huge hit that it opened a branch near JU also as far as a cousin tells me.
I also happened to like the chicken fhaley which happens to be a momo which is fried and is huger in shape and crispy at the top and instead of the shape of the dumpling has a long elongated shape, the one with which most of us associate momos, just a bit larger.....
The thukpa is also a great hit here as they make it pretty darned good but I hated the noodles and the Dragon chicken....Its a let down, a total let down,. the noodles as too oily, had a little too much ajinomoto added to it and the noodles was not perfectly boiled I had to throw it away.... Could not even share the plate between 2 people.....
This joint has an outside as well as another inside seating... Try this out for the traditional Tibetan dishes and do not venture towards any Chinese ones and you will be more than satisfied.....
The marks cut is for the quality of the noodles and the seating and all otherwise with an upgradation it could reach a 5 from me

I had forgotten the name of this small Tibetan joint and today when i read one of the reviews of my fellow foodies I got a de ja vu. Yes this is that very eatery where my ju friend always took me for some unconventional Tibetan stuff! I distinctly remember the tai po which is a huge bun shaped momo stuffed with minced meat generously filled and also boiled eggs. Their thukpa is really yum and you can add the momo sauce kept at the counter to spice it up. The best however is their chicken fhalay which is a fried flat momo,and i found them crisp even after 2hrs when i had them at home. Considering hygiene and ambience,you may not wanna visit this place,even the location is eerie and i wouldn't have managed to be there without my friend's help. There's a small room right next to the kitchen where you may sit and have the food. But i would recommend this place to all just to try the unconventional stuff here,for the prices are unbelievably low and the quality is well above standard momo joints!

friend : CHol na .U must come the place has the best momos in town 
me( intrigued ) : Really ? let's give it a try then ..if its bad then you will pay 
STATUTORY WARNING : noT a place for cleanliness freaks... 
 
the eatery is behind  the south city apartments  .... a place difficult discover on your own if not for zomato :P
they have limited seating available .. the place is very small and the kitchen is just in front of you to scrutinize
BUt their food is far from mediocre .... seriosuly....... one may  rightly call it one of the best momo joints in kolkata 
its asuper crowded place at peak hours .. recommended you visit early
pros:
1) Awesome delicious momo 
2) very light and (with a little seasoning ) tasty soup
3) the fhaley which i had for the first time seemed a fried  larger version of momo and was super tasty
4) the momo sauce is hot and superb 
5) super low price
cons:
1) small space 
2) slow service
3) the plates which they serve in was were very wet they should have wiped it 
and that's it 

you will be compelled to re order as i was ...coz the food is very tasty and prices are unbelievably low 
i cant recall having such a tasty momo elsewhere  for just Rs 30 
i am so eager to try the thukpa and the chow min and the meat balls next time  which will obviously be very soon...

Awesome food at an amazingly low price. Among the variety of Chinese and Tibetan delights, I liked most the momo, thukpa, tai pao and the noodles. I have had such momos hardly anywhere in kolkata(keeping the price in mind). If you want to enjoy authentic Chinese and tibetan dishes at an affordable price, this is the place for you.

Denzong is a hole is the wall shop tucked away in a tiny lane on the Jadavpur Tollygaune auto line.

The place serves good wholesome momos at a very cheap rate. Word of advice. The best way of enjoying the momos is sitting there right outside the shop while the momos are still warm. Taking the home and trying to eat it later is a terrible idea.(Speaking from experience). I have heard good things about their Shapta but never had the good luck of trying it. 

The place usually always busy thanks to the abundant student crowd who cannot stop coming here and has actually made the stuffing of the Denzong momos the stuff of legends.

Finally i hopped into denzongs kitchen, the place is remotely located but could easily be identified bcus of the huge crowd.. Well its really not the place where u can sit for a meal ,way to small and seating arrangement is very poor and inadequate. Apart from that service is very slow,now coming to the food part ,had some steamed momos which was pretty good at the price they are serving, Fahley was decent but served cold, thukpa which was average but can't complain as they only charge rs 30 for a bowl, and chicken chow which was good at that price. . so if ur really short on budget and want to stuff ur stomach deep its the right place..but don't expect for seating arrangement.

I guess the unbelievably high ratings of this place is due to the price tag and a definite student hangout vibe. The place is hard to find on your own but once the owner provided the direction it was easy. Now even the autowallahs acknowledge this as a recognised landmark. Credit goes to th JU gang of students. 
The steamed momos are actually great. Just adequate thickness of the dough. Juicy and substantial filling. Nicely seasoned. And the pricetag. The sauce is undrrseasoned for my taste and the soup is just a hot mess. But the freshness and juiciness of the dumplings are fabulous.
Everything else in the menu is a miss for me. Fahley is greasy. The chicken ball thingy underseasoned. The Taepo downright inedible. The chowmein quantity is amazing. But taste is not distinctive. Chicken side dishes are okay and again beautiful quantity.
The place is worth visititing for the hot and fresh momos.

Its a very small cozy food joint in south kolkata. To reach there, one has to take an auto for bikramgarh from either tollygunj or jadavpur and tell the autowala that u want to get down at bikramgarh momo shop.

The place is always crowded by students, and if u go there after 5.30, you sure have to wait for 15 mins after placing your order.

They have a few seating arrangements inside but mostly people have the food outside.

The tops hits are the steamed momo ofcourse which is a must, followed by the Chicken Thukpa. I don't think u will find thukpa so cheap yet yummy anywhere else in kolkata. The Fahley is equally yummy. U can also try their noodles, which is a bit spicy compared to their Tibetian dishes.

It is a place where we love to go on chilly winter evenings and having hot steaming momos at a pocket friendly cost adds more flavor for a collage student like me :) what else do we want? :P

Superb food, particularly at their prices.  The momos were excellent, but the dragon chicken was even better!  would have given this a 5 but for the location and the delivery time.

The first time when I had from this small joint I was absolutely awestruck. Its simply WOW!!!! The place is very small and is located in a residential locality. I was introduced to this place by a very good friend of mine and after having the  momos I was taken aback as I did not have any juicy tasty momos before in this cultured city. Trust me I was totally blown away by the juicy fillings of the momo and none would believe me until you have from this place. Their chowmein is way above par than what we get at that price in any other food joints. Its really delicious and also different to what I feel is because it is a little burnt when it is served. Never had the opportunity to have their faleys because it gets always over whenever I order for it. Turnouts are generally college goers and the younger generation. Service is little on the slow side might be because the courteous staffs are cramped with space. This place needs a makeover with the infrastructure otherwise food is brilliant. Thumbs up...!!!!!!!!!!

I have been going to this little place for a while now. However, on my last visit I was surprised to see that they have renovated the place. It looks much better now, providing a proper ambiance for eating. So, people complaining about the space and sitting problem have some corrections to make. There's nothing new to be added about the food. Nothing too fancy. Tastes nice and it's easy on the pocket. Very good as a hangout for friends. I'll recommend it to the young people. 

P.S. They don't have a freezer anymore. So, no cold drinks.

This resturent is best for students. The food they serve is the best in quality in south kolkata undoubtedly. 
It is also a good thing the price unbelivably low. They even offer a variety in there menu within a low price range. Only drawback in my eye is the resturent is small. There is only few seats for the customers.

Arguably the best momos available in town-soft, succulent, juicy-the perfect blend. The hot sauce complements the momos amazingly. The soup is insipid, though. The spring chicken and dragon chicken are the best chicken dishes available though they are best made in rare times of lesser deluge of rush. The noodles are quite well prepared too. But the best thing about Denzong is it's price. All in all Denzong deserves a mention among the top places to eat in town.

Me and my friend went there for the first time yesterday at around 7:30 p.m. There was no signboard and I had to ask a guy to make sure that it was Denzong's.  But then we realized that it was a bad time to visit because this place is so famous that all the food gets finished by 4 o'clock. There was still a crowd of cool English speaking people enquiring about which dishes were available. One lady even asked the guy in the counter (who, without being judgemental, didn't pass school according to my best judgement) where was Saurav and what was he making then in English. So personally I was feeling very happy to be a part of this hip and happening crowd. Anyway, since we were the first among the crowd to ask for food, any food, the guy in the counter agreed to serve us two full plates of chicken momo and said to the next two guys that they could have whatever pieces would be left. 
And that momo was awesome! It was stuffed heavily and it was delicious. They served it with a very tasty sauce too. I had a very enjoyable experience going for momo at Denzong's.

I will not disagree with the reviews bellow but after hearing so much, I went there and ordered for two plates of chicken momo packed as the vegetarian versions are not available. The person there took them out from stored bellow and  forgot to give the soup. Only when asked, he gave soup. 

My comments, after opening of the of the packets, most of the momos were very hard, soup was awful. Although my daughter also said very good about them but she was also frustrated and annoyed once she ate one/two of the momos, both as it is cold and also after reheating in microwave.

beside, since I am vegetarian, When asked for the same he said its finished and mind it that the time was 4.30 pm.

So my advice that  it is better that you eat there itself and don't go for parcel and not a place for veterinarians.

This is my personal opinion and many of you will disagree but i also don't agree that that  price you can't expect more.

Please try, if possible, a Nepali boy selling only momos in Netaji Nagar, opp Bawarchi and beside Fairdeal Electronics, but only in evening.

The Para Momo Corner. 
every momo lover should come and try out the Momos without a miss. 
 Its a tiny place, a bit shabby. But do we care when the momos are so good?! NO! 
Also try the phalays and the thukpa.

If you are a student and happen to live around South Kolkata, you must have heard of this magical place people keep thanking the gods for where food is just as cheap as it is good. Denzong Kitchen is cheap but far from good. Admittedly i have nothing bad in particular to say about their food, but I have nothing good to say about it either. I have great faith in the people of my city and greater faith in their love for good food. Denzong is a disappointment in itself, more so in its unjustified popularity.

The noodles are greasy, sometimes not boiled enough. The fhaley is greasy and not too bad. The momo is greasy and pretty ordinary. I would like to believe that had the prices been any higher, this place would not be half as popular as it is. No points to a place that has oily plates, ordinary food and virtually no chairs for being cheap. They have no choice but to keep the prices low if they are to keep business running.

Denzong's is quite removed from main roads. Getting there is relatively easy because autos from Jadavpur are readily available and they drop you right at the lane that leads to it. Getting back though is more difficult, especially if you are with a sizeable group of friends. Your best bet are the rickshaws that will take you either to Lake Gardens or Jadavpur Bus Stand from where you will have to pick your mode of transport. Thus there is the added cost of travel, which makes the Denzong experience not that cheap after all.

Add to the mediocre food the fact that you will almost never get a place to sit in and that if you do, you will have to overlook the grease-bin they dip the dirty plates in, if you are to eat in peace. I'd much rather pay a little extra to have my food somewhere a little less evidently sub-standard.

It isn't the grease so much as the carelessness that bothers me. I'd really rather visit a place where they cared more, even if they charged me for it.

This is a very small eatery serving Tibetan and Chinese dishes at a very reasonable price and is a very famous Momo joint. The location is hard to find as it is hidden in one of the by lanes of Bikramgarh, however due to its popularity within youngsters and college goers, you will find it crowded in the evenings. 

I have only tried the Chicken Momo here and it tastes absolutely yumm. Perfect for a quick bite with friends. I have heard that the other items like Thukpa and noodles tastes good.  A plate (5 pieces) of steamed momo costs Rs. 30. I feel that recently the chicken stuffing within the momo has been reduced, nevertheless it is great value for money.

The only drawback is that there is almost no seating available except a few chairs and benches laid out on the street. So you have to stand and eat, which I dont mind :) 

I should be back to try out some other items soon ... 4.5 for the Momos !

I came across this place while checking out the Jadavpur-Tollygunge autorickshaw route. Initially, the tiny shop may seem repulsive, but the food will surely make you lick your fingers. Amazing is the taste of the Chicken Phaley, and equally good is the Thukpa. The steamed momos are pretty good, while the fried and panfried momos are okayish. The chicken chow was decent, but the quantity they served at such a low price was a big surprise.
I noticed the Tai Pao is quite famous out there, though personally I felt it was a little bland.
Apart from awesome food, the people behind the counter are always cheerful, giving quick service (Thukpa was served in less than 2mins) and the cherry on top is their extremely reasonable prices.
Give this place a shot, you will love it!

This tiny shop hosts the best Momos available in the city. The look and size is inversely proportional to the taste. Hot, Soft, Tasty and Juicy yeah Juicy , this is the place for you if you love Tibetan momos. Dont be surprised to see the massive crowd around it post 6.30 pm. Go grab your bite today. And make sure you order two plates, cause one would just not be enough.

A friend suggested it and it was awesome! had the thukpa, momo and fahley.... all were really unique, though I liked fahley the most, so I would suggest that one should definitely try it.. Thukpa was another unique dish...the idea is that its noodles with soup.. but as for the momo, i've had better momos.. :-)

I had Come to this eatery along with my friends at their suggestion.The first thought that crossed my mind was the place is too small and things were not put up in a proper order which could help them serve proper delicious food.But believe you me,the first bite of the hot steaming and absolutely juicy momos ,I knew i was highly mistaken.It was heavenly satisfying to gobble up those momos.It is indeed a momos paradise.We had meatballs,hot garlic noodles,thuppa which left me wonderstruck.The eatery is not at all organized n very conjusted but once u taste their food you would know why people like us queue up n wait at their stall for long time.As it goes,dont judge a book by its cover!!Absolute delightful gastronomical experience it was for me!!Cheers to them!!!

I thank god for this place. And I am grateful that my friend had introduced this place to me. Its like a foodie's momo paradise! I remember the first time I saw this place i thought it was a waste of time and money trying their food. And thank goodness I was proved wrong. I will never forget my first plate of momo, which I received, hot and steaming- the very thought of which is mouth-watering! The momos were hot, juicy and yummy! And Unstoppable. Their momo's are addictive, which is why you will always find people waiting patiently (or impatiently) for hours just for a plate of their momo! They also serve brilliant meatballs, which I find a little spicy. Their phaleys and Tai pao are awesome too! Another thing that I go gaga over, is their Thukpa! It is filling, tasty and healing! Yes Healing. A bowlful of Chicken Thukpa  will heal you from throatache, headache, heartache and the like! Try their noodles too if hungry! And please even if hesitant try their momo without fail.
It does not matter whether you are a broke or whether your pocket money is falling short, this place is always open for you. Very cheap, extremely tasty, visit whenever you fee like. Locating might be difficult, take a friend you might know. You can go from Lords mor, or from 8B!  Or else just navigate- it is worth your time, money and sweat! ;) 
Do Not Judge By the Appearance. Go for it and order a plate of momo! Visit after 3pm. Second Mondays of every month it remains closed! Don't be disappointed, there will be no place to sit, there will be dogs and cats walkig or lying around. It might be hot and there might be mosquitoes!! Still it will be worth All these discomfort! Have Fun! :)

From the day I was introduced to this place by a friend,this place has always been one of my favourites.
This place is more like a canteen with very few places to sit.In the evenings the place gets crowded and service is quite slow.
But the staff are very friendly.But most importantly the food is awesome.They serve tibetian food and it is absolutely delicious.
The steamed momos are probably the best momos I have had in all of Kolkata.The phalleys are so popular that they are sold out within minutes.Both the quantity and quality of food they serve are excellent.
Momos,phalleys,gyathuks and dragon chicken are my personal favourites.
The insanely cheap prices(even though there has been a recent hike) are a bonus!

I was introduced to Denzong by a JU friend who took me there and told me to order anything I liked. Well, I ordered a few plates of momos, the gyathuk and phalay. When the food came I was not expecting much, so I bought a bottle of peach flavored water from the shop next to it. 

And well, I was forced to eat my words. Literally. The steamed momos were possibly the most exquisite I have had in Kolkata in a long time, and the meat-to-skin ratio as well as the thin skin and the superb, not too hot or salty peppery sauce was just perfect. I was an instant convert at that moment. 

Numerous visits later, I have had to admit that the place needs to work on the slow service, and yes, on the average wait time for plates of momos to be made. Barring that, two thumbs up for whatever you are putting in those momos (I probably am aware of the secret, but I promise I would not tell!!).

Denzong Kitchen is a good low-cost eatery that serves well-made Tibetan food. It's momos are always fresh and soft, and the stuffing of excellent quality. The phalays, whiich are large fried dumplings, are so good that they sell out within minutes of becoming available. My personal favourite is the gyathuk, which is a heavy soup with noodles, meat and eggs in it. The large quantity served almost turns it into a full meal.

The staff are friendly. This place is essentially an extension of a hole-in-a-wall place, so there is no question of ambiance or decor. Most customers stand and eat outside the shop. The place gets heavily crowded in the evenings, so service slows down, but it's usually worth waiting for your food. It's a good place to go to for cheap, tasty food.

The best momo's in kolkata period .. i will step up a notch and say Denzong's momos can be compared to two momo shops in west bengal .. one being Dimick in bidhan nagar siliguri and the other being the legendary pork momos of penang in darjeeling. Denzong sticks to serving chicken momos and not pork which is a little sad but on the other hand their chicken momo's can easily own any pork momo serving joint in the city. Denzongs single handedly could give blue poppy a run for their money in the Momo and Thukpa department. This place also serves a variety of standard chinese dishes . They also make a decent tai-po and Phaley . The momos are so juicy that it literally oozes down your fingers onto your wrists and then to your elbow from the first bit if you are not too careful . Hands down the place to go for a juicy plate of chicken momo's in town. This place is small and cozy always crowded and for 30 bucks a pop quite pocket friendly too.

This place serves the best dumplings. Period. Have been here for like a hundred times and I've never been disappointed with their momos. You'll always find this place totally packed and crowded, but don't let that discourage you, even if you have to wait for a few extra minutes. If there is anyone who's fond of momos and is in search for a real good place, then this is surely the one place to go! Though I'm not really fond of the thukpa or phaley, but the amazing plate of juicy dumplings that comes for only 30 bucks can make up for all the flaws you may find here. The soup that they serve is not really tasty but the two kinds of sauce that accompanies the momos is quite good. Even though the service is very fast, one may still have to wait for 10 to 15 minutes before the food is served. There is a small room with a few chairs inside which is usually full so you can get a seat outside instead. Most of the people just stand and gobble up the delicacies. So, finding a place to sit is not really a problem once the plate of piping HOT, succulent little steamed dumplings dripping with butter and flavour, arrives in front of you. 
If you're still reading this review and thinking whether to step out or not, I'd advice you to hurry up and go get hold of a plate as soon as you can! :)
