Got the pleasure of experiencing this place courtesy a bachelorette treat. Nice ambiance good grub and the music really lights up the place. The staff are very much appreciative of the customers and treat with utmost hospitality.

Visited the place during this Durga puja. Service was given during puja rush. Ambience is too nice. However food was not up to the mark. Brownie was like gum nd there was no chocolate  syrup. Not for second time visit.

Wanted to chill out with a few friends in Kolkata. I have come across Klink through my friend. It is truly ultimate party destination.   Had a great party time with friends. Savoured a variety of cocktail and snacks.

This newly opened place is quite good when it comes to ambience and location, though service needs to improve a bit, food quality is good as you can expect in a 4star place, located in the heart of south Kolkata this place will sure grow among the foodies and continue to serve well i believe, the terrace arrangement is good with poolside tables and with an amazing view of the city you'll enjoy the quality time here for sure.
