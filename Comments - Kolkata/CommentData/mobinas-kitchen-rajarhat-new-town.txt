worst experience ever they ask you to wait for 40 mins and then suddenly tell "aap cancel karna chahte hai to kar dijiye". They charge 10rs extra for foil. Behaviour is also not welcoming.

They should shut down. 3 4 to deliver the food you order at lunch and wat u get can be ate a evening snacks. The management is very pathetic, doesn't know how to talk to customer.

If u have heard a word worst then you should relate this word toh this place. One day my parent came and  i ordered they took 4 hours to deliver. They forgot to complete the orders. And then comes the owner she is rude as one can be. Food is just fine coz in newtown there are less places.

Well what should I say. My visit to this place can be categorised as a big mistake. I would rather visit other places little far off my residence instead of visiting this walking distant food joint. This place has a long way to go if the owners want their restaurant to survive, though I know there are people who will never mind to visit this place since it's quite pocket friendly. If the service and the staff behaviour could have been better, I would have improved my rating to some extent, though I know I'm asking too much. Please do through the reviews placed by other foodies before trying your luck here. One word to describe this food joint is PATHETIC. However, I can say that it's good for students as they can have decent road side like food with their budgeted pocket money.

I've not been an usual blogger but this place has forced me to go otherwise. Excellent food at an unbeatable price are its highlights. If this outlet continues this way then I'm sure it would emerge as Newtown's most sought after food joint.

What to say about this place.... If you havent tried. This place... Good....DONT EVEN THINK.OF IT... this place is just near my home, near tank 2,New Town... I cant imagine of visiting this place, rather i would take pain of traveling to sector 5 or any other resturant for food..... Initially when i Came to know that a resturant will here,just near my home I felt good..there was a relief.that i dont have to travel to sec 5 or any other place.. But trust me...i was wrong.
Food quality- bad,
Serving time- will take a decade...
But yes they have made an arrangement for entertainment as food takes time to reach to you...Mosquitos...yes... Thats only entertainment.
Atmosphere-: choking
 Limited sits..
My suggestion- please dont visit this place
Thanks :)

We have been here more than couple of times because of the proximity to our place.
Turn offs
1. So when we gave a feedback abt the crispy chilly babycorn not bein crispy, on our next visit we were asked to have that item somewhere else!!! I mean whaaat!
2. Didi, the one taking care of things, goes about like... she is doing a favour
3. Anything you order comes in its own sweet time.. while you entertain the mosquitos in the compound outside the restaurant.. yes it has only 3 crammed tables in its dinning area

Yummy-liscious
1. Dal tadka. Mix veg. Paneer kadai... i liked the veg items compared to the non veg ones

Conclusion
I will go here for a cheap, Simple dinner when am too bored to cook and have no other options.

need to improve a lot..pakoda and other starters are not upto the mark. Chicken bharta was okay..behaviour is friendly but food has to be good....

Made me lose my apetite! ... resturant is clean but don't expect a Air-conditioned family cuisine... Food quality is just below average.... i think they hired chefs from caterars..but can't say without a evidence....
it's a good restaurant for take-aways for  Young employees around newtown... but please it's not a place where you will bring your family.. i'm saying this because of the quality of food served, Your children will yell at saying "WHAT THE HECK , DAD/MOM!!!!"....(Once i got undercooked chicken in one of my main course order ...Yuck ! -_-)
Anyways if you don't believe this Review , please go ahead and try anything on the menu ,you will understand......
For  a better family restaurants around newtown - try Meahk-e-Punjab in Axis mall..
