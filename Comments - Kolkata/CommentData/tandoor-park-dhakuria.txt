Go..go..go! Nice place to hangout. With a large menu they are one of a kind. Tried tandooris, tasted really good. Courteous service. And, always chilled beers! Collection of drinks is good too.

Went here a few times.  Decoration is quite decent. The standard of food is quite good. And every dishes are equally delicious.  But the dishes are lacking the visual impacts which is a very important part of the business. So the management needs to note this for the betterment.  Price is reasonable and service is cordial and prompt too.

Tandoor park is one of the best restaurants of south Kolkata, that serves very good quality food. I have been to this place many a times and they never fail to amaze me by their preperations. They prepare very tasty food items and serves all the cuisine. Recently renovated, this place flaunts with its classy interior providing comfort at its best. I have tasted almost all of their Indian dishes and none could have a complain. Service is appreciable. Pocket pinch is a bit high but absolutely worth. Moreover a highly recommendable restaurant from my side. This should be a must visit if you are looking for quality as well as   taste.

Waited for around 40 minutes and still no seat at the table . We were a group of 8 and we're told that they will arrange one by joining the table so we didn't went for another restaurant.But after 25 minutes no seats were available for us but people of 2 and four were getting the seats. After 40 minutes of waiting we went for another restaurant. Not good service

Yesterday evening decided to sit and enjoy with my friend along with good food. Ordered Tandoori Murgh full plate along with Chilli Babycorn and my friend ordered some Scotch for himself. Food was smoking hot with minimum waiting time and staff was courteous and helpful. But yes, i do have an advice to the management. Kindly provide mobile charging facilities in each table as that becomes very necessary after a day's outing with a dying battery. That wouldn't cost you any extra,but will add to your popularity

I went there for dinner, today evening. It's located right in front of Jodhpur Park post office. The ambience and the appearance of the place are good. We ordered 1 plate of Pahari Kebab and a plate each of chicken as well as mutton biriyani. The kebab dish was indeed good. The quantity of the biriyani was pretty good, although the taste could have been slightly better. But nevertheless, it was a good experience.

I came here along with a group of 10 people for lunch. They said that we couldn't sit in the interior because the AC was malfunctioning. We chose to sit outside. The ambience was quite good. There were not much people. We had ordered Reshmi Tikka Kebab, Pahari Kebab, Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Lababdar Chicken, Chicken Rara Masala. The service was smooth. The food was awesome. The kebabs were juicy and tasty. The biriyani was nice and was in ample quantity. Chicken Rara Masala was something I didn't taste before. It was quite nice. We were about to order beer but we were feeling full after our lunch. It was a great day.

Coming to the food, Both the times that I've visited I've tried Chinese only and TBH I find the food here quite average as compared to other Chinese restaurants in the city. We had ordered chicken sweet corn soup which was good and veg fried rice with chilli chicken, that was fine too.

Tandoor park: Those who like Mughlai dishes must pop over this place. A big list of mughlai cuisine  available here. I did order for Reshmi Kebab the chicken was marinated in juicy mixture of curd cashew spices maybe with some secret ingridient too and was finely cooked they may have have used some sort of binding agent which gave it a different taste. Next up I have ordered for Chicken Manchow Soup quantity was pretty good testes different from other soups hot spicy had various kind of vegetables garnished with chopped spring onions and fried noodles. But definitely the price is a bit high but food is satisfying.

If you want to avoid the queue, go there by 6.30 p.m. on weekends. By 7, it becomes crowded. The quality of the food is very good I must say. There's one dish called crispy conjee chicken which is so tempting that it demands a second serving. Tandoori chicken is a must try over here. And another dish I need to mention, that is chicken bharta. I have had it at so many places but nowhere it tasted so good. The prices are reasonable as well. If the reader is from South Kolkata, tandoor park should not be missed.
Thank you.

The mutton kebab and the chicken tikka kebab out here. The service is also excellent. It has a bar and the prices are reasonable. They have restaurant spread over 2 floors one for family and the other for the party people. Will visit again for the lovely food specially the Tandoori Bekti.

Definitely a must visit for foodies. The place is recently revamped . The view from the glass walls is really good and pretty bonny. The sitting arrangement is really attractive. The environment is also so amicable .
It is situated is an easily locatable place , opposite to the Dakshinapan shopping mall ; opposite to the Himalaya Mega Optical Store Jodhpur Park Branch to be more precise.
The service is very good and attractive.
The restaurant is basically located at the first floor.
The interior decoration and the behaviour of the service-men somewhat impressed me.
Since I'm a vegan , I ordered some veg dishes.
I began my meal with Chilli babycorn, it's an appetizer and really delicious, a bit spicy.
Then ordered Chilli Garlic Noodles accompanied with Chilli Paneer.
Ended with Tutty Fruity
On the service-man's suggestion I ordered Nolengur flavoured ice-cream, the taste was so relishing.
Being very honest , I loved each and every dish , and the irony is the price is very reasonable. So it's worth spending both time and money here. :)

This was my second visit to this restaurant located in Dhakuria, just opposite to Dakshinapan. This place serves both Chinese and Indian dishes, and we opted for Chinese this time. We ordered Hakka Chilli Shrimp, Fried Spring Chicken and Crispy Konjee Lamb for starters; Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mandarin Fish and Hunan Chicken for mains. Hakka Chilli Shrimp was delicious, so was Fried Spring Chicken. But the pieces of lamb in Crispy Konjee Chicken were too small for us to be able to taste the lamb and the batter was too thick. Mixed hakka noodles was average. Mandarin fish was good, but Hunan Chicken nothing to write home about. Prices were quite reasonable. The ambience of this place was really nice and soothing. The staff were helpful and courteous. Would visit this place again to try their Indian dishes.

Located near Dhakuria this place is one of the best for the foodies. The ambience is pretty praiseworthy.

Went there with my friends, we had Murg Bharwaan Sena as starter, it was finger licking good. Juicy chicken stuffed with chicken keema this dish is worth a try. For the main course we had biriyani and Chicken tikka masala which were equally good. The staffs was quite helpful and friendly.

So if you are to spend a little more than your usual lunch bugget then this place deserves a go.

They also have a smoking room and a well stocked bar. Bar prices are a little higher than the foods. Service is prompt and quick. Staffs are well mannered and friendly. Now coming to the food, we had butter naan and chicken lababdar. Butter naan was soft and good. Chicken lababdar was awesome in taste but the quantity was very less.

It is a family bar cum restaurant. Located near Dakshinapan shopping complex just opposite jodhpur park post office. The ambiance here is awesome. They also have a smoking room and a well stocked bar. Bar prices are a little higher than the foods. Service is prompt and quick. Staffs are well mannered and friendly. Now coming to the food, we had butter naan and chicken lababdar. Butter naan was soft and good. Chicken lababdar was awesome in taste but the quantity was very less. Overall nice place to hangout with family or friends.

This was my favourite some years back. They have renovated alot. FOOD is same. BUT the worst part is they gave me a very uncomfortable 2 seater. After repeated request nothing happened. Very sad I was stunned that they couldn't arrange a simple 2 seater. Finally i left without completing my dinner. They might have gained name but they lost a loyal customer . I myself use to recommend it to alot  of people but never again. Disgrace...

Our favorite restaurant in South Kolkata. It is a family bar cum restro. Located opposite to Jodhpur Park Post office and near Dhakuria Flyover and Dakshinapan Shopping complex. The ambience is awesome here.
Food quality is standardized throughout the year despite of the festive season and weekend rush. 
You have to wait to get your seat throughout the year, but it is worth waiting for.
Anyone can relish good food and cherish the quality time with friends and family here.

Must try: 

Fish finger
Pepper fish
Lat me kai
Crispy chili prawn
Reshmi kebab
Tandoori Murgh
Mutton Biriyani
Butter naan
Dal Makhani
Chicken lababdar
Bhuna Gosht
Mutton Peshawari

Ambience: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Quality of food: 5/5

Went here with friends for a light lunch yesterday. I really liked their ambience. They also have a smoking room and quite a well-stocked bar. 
We were not in the mood for drinking that day, so we just ordered the food. We went for tandoori roti, chicken malai Masala and chicken bharta. The taste of both the side dishes were good. The bharta had stronger flavours of spices, while managing to be not too hot while the malai Masala had chunky pieces of chicken swimming in a thick white gravy lightly flavoured with ground cardamom. Definitely worth a visit.

Today mom, my brother and me decided to dine out at Tandoor Park in the evening. We loved every single food whatever we ordered there. For starters, we had reshmi kabab, pepper fish (too spicy yet tasty), drums of heaven (we loved the taste). For main course, we ordered butter nan, reshmi butter masala, phad thai chao wang (thai flat noodles with baby corn, broccoli, chicken and prawn). We loved the thai noodles. Then we had tutty frutty. Waiters are well mannered and co operative. Love to visit again.

It's located near dhakuria bridge..exactly in opposite side of dakshinapan shopping complex (jodhpur park post offce). 
It seems like a small restro generally from outside..but it's not. It actually has enough space inside. We went there for a couple of tym. It's an expensive restro ..no doubt in it. 
I specially like their fish finger..it's served with mayonnaise. And I tried tandoor roti n smoky fish too. It was little spicy..but enough in quantity. But definitely the price is high.

Have been there several times. But when recently I visited during the Pujas I was pleasantly surprised by their revamped interiors. The price of the items is justified in terms of their quality. However, coming back to the cocktails there wasn't any menu at all. It was just mentioned bartender's special. Didn't like this system at all. I was served a Mousambi flavoured cocktail which I didn't like simply because I hate Mousambi.  So I ended up paying for something which I do not like. The other items, however, was good! :)

The only moderately priced bar cum restaurant of that area, Tandoor Park, located opposite to the Jodhpur Park Post Office on Gariahat Road. There's nothing fancy here but the recent renovation is one of the reasons of the weekend and holiday rush. On the ground floor they have a waiting area for such days and the provision for a separate smoking section technically makes this place a multifaceted.

Visited the place on Nabami night at 2 am with very little expectation since it was puja night & well past 12. As per government regulations the bar was closed. So we have invested more on sumptuous foods. Our first order was fish in Manchurian sauce. Voila! It was as crispy and juicy. Our taste buds finally got a huge relief after continuous consuming of below average foods. Then came nun & butter masala and mixed fried rice.
Have a warning, if you have small appetite then order only one single nun. Coz their nuns are huge üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
I can still feel the awesome taste. Full  paisa vasool 
A must go place

This was my frequent dining place sometime back. I had last time visited on saptami. The place is dimly lit but has a comfortable ambience. 
For food we had:
Tandoori chicken: this was my favorite. The chicken was soft, fresh and perfectly spiced.
Murg Tikka kabab: the dish was fine but the chicken was a little stiff.
Butter naan: was good.
I don't remember the name of the mutton preparation that we had but it was spicy and tasty. The mutton was tender.
Fresh lime soda(sweet): it was not sweet at all but they served us extra honey which saved the drink. 
The staff was in a hurry due to puja rush but overall it was fine.

it's a beautiful place with soothing  ambience...nice location..opposite dakshinapan.
we ordered tandoori chicken and murgh  tikka kebab for starters..both were good
we ordered butter naan and peshawari mutton for the main course...it's was shredded mutton and good in taste.i loved most of the food...they maintained the quality even in the rush hours of puja ..fresh lime soda was very sour...though I ordered the sweet one.
service was a little slow so I deducted 1 point .

After a long discussion with my friend we go there today. When we enter in the destination security people told us to wait. After 15 minutes of waiting we are able to take our table for dinner. Till now everything was OK. After sitings on our table there is no one for serving anything. It's take 20 minutes then one came and served the empty glass and gone. Then again after 10 minutes one boy came for taken the order while taking the order he was not sure that the item is available or not. That's why he was gone to asking that and won't came. In between I went to washroom and I was shocked to see the atmosphere. A pay and use toilet is better then it. I came back after 4 to 5 times of telling about the order they at last served. The food is OK. Not very much impressive. Again start we were asking for the bill for 7 times then it was came. It is really a bad experiences. We don't want to go there again not even suggest anyone. It's quality of food and it's looks ambiance and it's price of services not match. It just a bull shit restaurant. Nothing else.......

Biriyani and nan are good. The tandoori is a special favourite of mine. Also the chef's special cocktail is a must try.

I have been to this place many a times and I would like to share my food journey with this joint. Initially we used to visit this place to grab a drink and eat Chinese food mostly because this place serves both Indian and Chinese and they do not compromise on their quality. Price is on the higher end. I wouldn't say it's exorbitant but it's just higher than the usual shops around the Jodhpur Park Area. It can be easily located. The interiors of the restaurant have been renovated and is quite impressive.
During the old times the Chinese food didn't disappoint me. I remember having the best brownie sundae and tutty frutty ice-cream here‚ù§‚ù§
Recently I was there to have the Indian food and wasn't very happy with the staff(very grumpy) and the food to some extent. We ordered the following:
1. Butter Nan: I have no complaints against their nan. It was soft and tasted fine.
2. Chicken Bharta: This dish was nothing extraordinary but it was delicious.
3. Chicken Tikka Makhani: I was highly disappointed with this. It tasted sweet to me when it was supposed to be a little spicy. It's my favourite side dish with nan and I wasn't very happy with Tandoor Park after loving them over the years just for their walnut brownie and the tutty frutty ice-cream. I just hope I get to see a better version of Tandoor Park in the upcoming days.

Visited first time in between pandal hopping... I was bit worried this time with ifs and buts that whether they serve any veg.dishes or not. And bingo! They do serve. Ambience was upto the mark. Service was quick enough in the rush hour. Hope the washroom becomes more cleaner. Staffs were decent and helpful.. Tried plain naan with paneer butter masala. Alongwith it was chicken bharta and chicken butter masala. All the delicacies were decent in taste. Hope the quality becomes more refined in the festival season as well..

I visited the place sometime back with my partner.
As soon as I entered I was mesmerized to see the ambience. I was overwhelmed and was look forward for the food. Since I was too hungry we ordered for some mushroom and mocktails as starters. The mushroom was good enough to make me fall in love with it for the rest of my life. The texture and the garnishing was so good that it even made a tandoor lover fall for it.
My partner was a bit fussy about ordering cocktails though I don't blame him, as the ambience was good enough for drinks. We didn't order because the previous day we had his post birthday celebration. Being a tandoor lover my partner ordered for mutton biryani and chicken butter masala. The biryani and chicken was pleasing to the taste buds. We were pleased to visit the place. We ended the feast with cold drinks.
But the only suggestion would be for cleaner washrooms and to check up on the taxes. We visited the place before GST, so we can hope for proper bills now.

So last evening i was there wid my friend for lunch. Firstly i will say the restrau is at a proper place, in main dhakuria road. We were first confused as the main gate was closed when we opened it but one guard said that the renovation is going on so the other gate in the back side is open so. And i want to tell u that until the gate of restrau (in 2nd floor) comes i was just that "how will be the restrau ambiance?" .
But finally when we entered the Ambiance was quite awesome at that budget i have seen coz it somehow Not Exactly bt the combination of peter cat and B B Q 's ambiance.
Ambiance-5/5 (in considering under this price range).

We ordered first chicken fried rice and reshmi butter chicken masala both were awesome and after that we orderd chicken biryani special and chicken lababdar. I will say that, since we r in Kolkata nd u know here u can find a awesome biryani at unexpected place So taking in consideration that here the biryani was good but not upto the mark and the chicken lababdar was also not that good, and i also had one sweet fresh lime soda but u know what it was just bad coz they made that sour like hell.
So for first 2 dishes - 5/5
Biryani-3.5/5

We also had a vanilla ice cream over brownie that was awesome.

Nd one more thing we were there at around 5.00 in the evening, so we were sitting inside hall area nd at around 5.30 only we were there and other peoples were sitting in the balcony side area nd so suddenly they have switched the AC off nd after a while when i asked that is the AC is off? Then they hv switched it on then.

The biryani is hot and the piece of meat is tender and juicy especially when you take the first bite besides any dish of gravy may go which will enrich the meal. The kebabs as a starter are very smoky type and tastes awesome.The only thing is they take bit time to get the order or else everything is well & good.

I visited the place sometime back with my partner.
As soon as I entered I was mesmerized to see the ambience. I was overwhelmed and was look forward for the food. Since I was too hungry we ordered for some mushroom and mocktails as starters. The mushroom was good enough to make me fall in love with it for the rest of my life. The texture and the garnishing was so good that it even made a tandoor lover fall for it.
My partner was a bit fussy about ordering cocktails though I don't blame him, as the ambience was good enough for drinks. We didn't order because the previous day we had his post birthday celebration. Being a tandoor lover my partner ordered for mutton biryani and chicken butter masala. The biryani and chicken was pleasing to the taste buds. We were pleased to visit the place. We ended the feast with cold drinks.
But the only suggestion would be for cleaner washrooms and to check up on the taxes. We visited the place before GST, so we can hope for proper bills now.

So last evening i was there wid my friend for lunch. Firstly i will say the restrau is at a proper place, in main dhakuria road. We were first confused as the main gate was closed when we opened it but one guard said that the renovation is going on so the other gate in the back side is open so. And i want to tell u that until the gate of restrau (in 2nd floor) comes i was just that "how will be the restrau ambiance?" .
But finally when we entered the Ambiance was quite awesome at that budget i have seen coz it somehow Not Exactly bt the combination of peter cat and B B Q 's ambiance.
Ambiance-5/5 (in considering under this price range).

We ordered first chicken fried rice and reshmi butter chicken masala both were awesome and after that we orderd chicken biryani special and chicken lababdar. I will say that, since we r in Kolkata nd u know here u can find a awesome biryani at unexpected place So taking in consideration that here the biryani was good but not upto the mark and the chicken lababdar was also not that good, and i also had one sweet fresh lime soda but u know what it was just bad coz they made that sour like hell.
So for first 2 dishes - 5/5
Biryani-3.5/5

We also had a vanilla ice cream over brownie that was awesome.

Nd one more thing we were there at around 5.00 in the evening, so we were sitting inside hall area nd at around 5.30 only we were there and other peoples were sitting in the balcony side area nd so suddenly they have switched the AC off nd after a while when i asked that is the AC is off? Then they hv switched it on then.

The biryani is hot and the piece of meat is tender and juicy especially when you take the first bite besides any dish of gravy may go which will enrich the meal. The kebabs as a starter are very smoky type and tastes awesome.The only thing is they take bit time to get the order or else everything is well & good.

The Place is near Dhakuria. The ambience and the privacy you get is awesome. The food is above average. But still i would rate this place high as you can get high(Booze) and have food in the same place in a good environment. Service is Friendly too. Tandoori is a must try here.
Food-3.5/5

Went there last night with my cousins. Had to wait for nearly 1 hour to get a table of three. Coming to ambience it seemed that we were in a fish market. The table in which we were sitting was attached to a wooden wall and it had baby cockroaches all over. Near about 8-10 baby cockroaches were roaming around and in the table. On  complaining the waiter  got busy catching the insects with  tissue papers. Service was perfect. Nothing to complain about. Waiters were polite. Coming to food it was nothing over the top. Was delicious but not mouth melting.

I have passed this certain restaurant for years but never really tried it up until last week, and i must say i don't regret that desicion one bit. We started off with an all time favourite, the chicken tandoori. The chicken was soft, well cooked and definitely not burnt or charred. Hands down it was finger licking good. Then we went for the Murgh musallam and butter naan. The naans were satisfyingly buttery and very soft. Nothing is appreciated more than naans that remain soft till the very last bite. As for the Murgh musallam, it was very nice and cooked to perfection, however, the filling inside made from keema could've been better and a little bit more juicy than dry. I've also tried chicken lababdar, and the dish is really worth the mention. It was rich and creamy but the taste wasn't at all saturating. We ended it on a sweet note, brownie with vanilla ice cream. On a normal day i wouldn't really recommend it, but it wasn't really intolerable either.

Lots of memories are attached with this place. From birthdays, bad days, happy days, boring days and lot of other days, we have spent here. Drank, ate, laughed, fought and then felt blessed to have this awesome place here nearby. We became so regular that every staff knew our preferences. The food is great and so the ambience. The staffs are courteous and d√©cor is nice. A great place to hang out with friends, family and even with office peeps. Technically it's an all arounder place.

Nothing fancy here. Plain old Indian/Chinese. The biggest plus is the location and that it is the only bar/restaurant which is moderately priced in the immediate vicinity. We go to this place at least once a month. Don't expect out of this world service or food. Everything is just about decent. Although be aware the weekend attracts more people than it should and there generally is a good amount of waiting during dinner. Don't go to Tandoor park expecting any culinary delight but just to relax with friends and family for a decent meal. The dishes I suggest are Kung pao chicken, crispy corn, kebab platter.

Tandoor Park is rickshaw distance from my home, still I haven't been there for the past 21 years. Don't know why I didn't!
Location of this place needs special mention. It's on the Gariahat-Garia auto route, at Jodhpur Park. Although the location is noteworthy the parking situation is grave. Being a local, I knew some alleyways where I could park, otherwise it's difficult.

Now about the restaurant. It's spacious. You won't be able to understand that from outside. Ambience is quite nice, specially the roadside sittings are quite a treat. The staff are courteous. We ordered Keema tandoori roti with a chicken side dish. Later we ordered special mutton biriyani. All of them tasted quite good. Pricing is also standard. We also ordered a mocktail (kiss me goodbye) & fresh lime soda. The mocktail didn't suit our taste. On the plus side they don't charge service tax.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Ambience
3. Standard food quality.
4. Courteous stuff.

Cons:
1. Parking
We didn't like the mocktail. But other mocktails may be better so won't categorize that as shortcoming.

Stay in South Kolkata? Wanna take your friends or family or near one out for a trusted place rather than just blindly following the restaurant ratings? Come here. This is one of the best restaurants in South Kolkata. From Sizzler to kebabs, the taste shows the effort that has gone into it. It has bar too. Mostly famous for family dine out. Lift Service available. Parking seems to b a problem but actually it isn't if you know that you can park four wheelers in the road opposite to it and two wheelers just beside it. Ambience is nice. Clean washroom. Well behaved staff. I go there alone to have a drink with myself often. Don't forget DHINGRA KEBAB even if u r a hard core non veg. It takes time to b served, but worth waiting for. Deducting 0.5 for not having Wifi.

This place is almost always full on weekends,in spite of having large seating arrangements. Been going there for many years and almost they have never disappointed really. Starting with the starters,their fish and chips is really good,the fish fry being large in piece. I used to love their sweet fresh lime soda but nowadays don't find it to be so much good. My father loves their chicken fried rice which only once was not the exact same. On asking they informed that the chef is on holiday and has been replaced by someone else,hence the difference in taste and look. So we suppose we went on a wrong day. Coming to the Indian menu which is my favorite- their masala kulcha is awesome,had with my favorite chicken lababdar. Apart from that,keema naan and butter naan are also good. Mutton hundi is decent.

At a sudden plan,we two visited during lunch hours and ordered Egg Chowmein and Schezwan chicken which costs Rs 383.They tasted equally well.Though the size of the chicken piece was small but were good in numbers. Quantity being enough was satisfying for both of us as we were much hungry.
A pocket-friendly restaurant if you can order cleverly.

Located opposite the Jodhpur Post Office,on Raja S.C. Mallick Road,is Tandoor Park,a bar cum restaurant that one can visit for almost every occasion. I have been here for lunches and dinners, relative's anniversary parties and casual evening drinks and snacks.

They have a spacious seating arrangement,competent to accommodate a large number of customers.

Majority of the times I've been here,the Chinese has never been a let down.

Ever since they've renovated the place and expanded their seating area,they've never looked back. They four seater tables have a view of the adjacent road,which adds to the ambience. Interior decor is pretty good and the lighting is better than before,making the restaurant seem more lively.

They have a waiting area on the ground floor, for the weekend and holiday rush,and service takes a hit on such days.

The alcohol and cocktails are priced on the higher side,compared to the food.
They also have provision for a separate smoking section.

The service is generally good and the waiters polite.

This restaurant has been a long time favorite. After renovation,  their first floor decor is really nice and comfortable now. You can have a good rime with friends and family and enjoy good food at affordable price. The location is great,  just between Dhakuria and Selimpore bus stop. The staff is courteous,  friendly and attentive. 

The must have in the menu is Bharwa Tengri Kabab. Yes,  it's Chicken Tengri Kabab with mutton fillings. You can't stop at one. Kashmiri Dum Aloo,  Fish Finger and Drums of Heaven are other starters too watch out for. For main course,  go for any Indian bread,  Naan,  Kulcha,  or Tandori Roti and have it with any Chicken,  Mutton or Paneer Dish. My personal favorites are Mutton Boti,  Chicken Rezala and Paneer Lababdar. 

Drinks and alcohol collection are good too. And the sinful will have plenty of dessert options as well.

After a hard day's work you need a bit of relief and Tandoor Park just gave me that comfort to wait for my lunch. 
The ambience is good. The privacy of every table is maintained and I love the part that the covers are spaced out and are at a certain distance.
The staff service quality is of top notch and I love the grooming and decency of the staff who served us. I don't remember his name but he made me happy with his service. 
The Biriyani and vegetable pulao, the white Raita and the crispy chilli babycorn was good but what disappointed me was the chicken do Paiza. The base and the garnish of the dish is the same, onions. What disappoints me is the use of onion. The onion used for garnish is simply fried. It it has to turn crispy and brown. barring that, I would  definitely come back here.

One of the most popular and visited restaurants of Dhakuria area. The place is overcrowded on weekends. I had to wait for more than one hour to get a table on a Sunday night. The food is of good quality & budget friendly. The North Indian & kebab cuisines are delicious. However we also tried Chinese & the fried rice was ordinary. They have an extended area with balcony overlooking the street. I liked sitting in this area very much. Ambiance was cozy & comfortable.

What I can say about the place, the name says it all. Located on Raja S. C. Mullick road, it is well accessed by Jadavpur and nearby places. The place is not very spacious, one has to wait in the ground floor to get seats in the peak hours, specially weekends. There is a separate space for smoking in this restaurant, so non smokers will not get annoyed. Full bar is available in this establishment. Price is very much reasonable compared to their standard. We have ordered Chicken Dopiyaja, Mutton Roganjosh, tandoor murg. All items were very delicious. One thing I would like to point out that, it is a family restaurant, so the customers should behave in dignified way.

Location :- very easily accessible just on the sc mullick road before selimpur if u r coming from golpark side..

Ambience :- If you want to have lavish dinner with your family or hangout with friends over a mug of beer or  a date... whatever be the occasion tandoor park will be there for u always.. Smile yet elegant.. eyecatching..üòç

Food :- Tandoori murgh  :- this dish don't need any introduction.. One of the best Tandoori chicken I have had in kolkata.. The salad and chutney accompanying it was perfect too... (5/5)

Special mutton biriyani :- Just one word.. It was lipsmacking..üòç perfect biriyani for biriyani lovers like me.. Two large pieces of mutton.. a big aloo.. An egg.. and the rice was perfect with adequate blend of spices..

Chicken rarha  :- A punjabi delicacy suggested by the server... It was average.. didn't like it that much though...

Keema nan.. :- superb.. A perfect nan with adequate stuffing...üòç

Overall a must visit place...

Service was prompt... üíØ

Chilli babycorn was "darun". Chicken rara masala is also nice. Chicken lat mi kai is sooo good.

What I can say about the place, the name says it all. Located on Raja S. C. Mullick road, it is well accessed by Jadavpur and nearby places. The place is not very spacious, one has to wait in the ground floor to get seats in the peak hours, specially weekends. There is a separate space for smoking in this restaurant, so non smokers will not get annoyed. Full bar is available in this establishment. Price is very much reasonable compared to their standard. We have ordered Chicken Dopiyaja, Mutton Roganjosh, tandoor murg. All items were very delicious. One thing I would like to point out that, it is a family restaurant, so the customers should behave in dignified way.

Service is very slow, ambience is a little lower than average. Minus two for the slow service. The reason for so is inattentive staffs and manager. Food is good. Never going again. Added disadvantage is no parking at all, not even nearbuy. We were so frustrated with the slow service that we did not order a 2nd drink. Our food (chicken lat mei kai only) came 25 mins after placing order and the 1st drink came 30 mins after the food, i.e., 55 mins after ordering. All 3 points for the taste of food only.

Today me and friend had dinner over here. This is the place which was in my mind for a long time. Now while we got a free Sunday evening we headed to this place. The place is very easy to locate. Its near dhakuria bus stop and on the left foot towards jadavpur. We got a seat in the first floor. I felt very good at first sight. The decoration, the ambience, the seating arrangment, the lights all were very clean and eye catching. Now came to the food part. We ordered 

Two mocktails and one cocktail- very good
Half tandoori chicken- one of the best tandoori i had
Mutton kara masala- not upto the mark
Jeera rice- good
Masala kulcha- average

All the staff were polite and attentive also. We definetly want to visit this place next time.

Ok .. so went to this place during lunch time around 1 pm or so . Its located on the road so its not hard to find.
The place looks good .
It has good ambience. The restora is located on the first floor . And the place has segmented type of sitting arrangements . Not the typical one great hall filled with many tables and chairs.
The food tastes well . The service is good.

Since it serves alcoholic beverages .. if u order anything they will ask for id proof . I found it weird becoz not many people go to have lunch carrying their age proof .
Also they dont serve everything thats on the menu.
So there is 50% chance that u wont get the brand of your choice . It happened with me .
I ordered a dessert named "choco brownie with vanilla scoop" ,but the waiter apologised saying that the vanilla scoop has melted .. instead they offered butterscotch. (The price was same).

Now about the price . It will cost above 1 k for 2 people . So its relatively high . Another important thing is the VAT and service tax (which is annoying , 6%) . For example our food cost us 1100 but with vat and other tax it was around 1400 . (Just do the maths).Also the menu and price given in zomato is outdated .. the new price are higher .

So ya definitely a place to visit once .. not so much after that .bcoz it will be heavy on your wallet and trust me there are many other restoras offering the same thing for less price and without service charge.

 

Goodluck!

Tandoori chicken: 3.5/5 (its good, but somehow not did not make a mark as tandoori chicken)
fish tikka: 4/5¬†
Chicken Biriyani: 5/5¬†
the reason of my rating is that I felt this place is quite high priced and they need to concentrate more on the service part.

Tandoor Park at Dhakuria has earned accolades for it's delectable kababs and other North Indian dishes. Naturally it lives upto it's expectation when we ordered the Assorted Kabab Platter, Mutton Peshwari and Prawn Masala. The kabab platter was interesting with it's variants. Prawn pieces were soft and succulent. The celebrated Lat Me Kai was delicately prepared to tickle the taste buds. The Nolen Gurer Ice cream was a revelation! in these summer months (with artificial flavor obviously).

Alcohol and cocktails are decently priced. Ambience was pretty cool and decent with sufficient place to accommodate good number of people. There are distinct sections for Family and Stags with a separate smoking zone. Service staffs are polite but service is pretty slow. Considering the quality of food pocket pinch is justified.
Overall, a nice dining experience at Tandoor Park, hence recommended.

Located near Dhakuria bus stop. Nice charming yellowish interior will make you fell cozy and comfort.

Quick service, but not every day
Pricing also worth of the quality and quantity.

We ordered Lat Me Kai & Tandoori Platter in starter.
Platter contains 1ps Tandoori chicken, 2ps Chicken Reshmi Kebab, 1ps Mahi Kebab, 3ps Chicken Tandoori Kebab, 3ps Mutton Seekh Kebab. All of those are soft and tasty.
In main course we order mixed fried rice and chili chicken those are average in tasty but nice quantity.

Service part I am not at all happy, we need to call loudly all the Staff, they are happy enough to provide a bottle of water only not bothering to give glass if you forget to ask for it.

They won't serve also until you ask them, neither they are asking also.

They won't charge you for service extra.
Liquor price is also reasonable with out any unwanted taxes.

Definitely it is worth of second visit, because of the variety of starters, price of liquor and huge seating space.

Location wise very easy to find this restaurant is a well known bar cum restaurant in the south Kolkata.
Really they prepare very good tandoor items.
One of my favourites is Bharwan Tangri-four chicken leg pieces stuffed with mutton keema masala. Soft and really tasty. Their tandoori chicken Reshmi kebab are also very tasty.
With the nun I always prefer their Bhuna Gosht.Soft boneless mutton pieces cooked in a mutton keema gravy. Brown spicy gravy with rich masala flavour.Mouth watering..

I have been to Tandoor Park atleast a dozen times, if not more. They have seating on the ground and upper floors, and iv mostly sat upstairs. A pretty steep staircase, leading up to a dimly lit seating area, TP, as we usually call it, offers good North Indian and Chinese food. People also troop down for drinks as well, TP is quite a favorite for getting good liquor in this area.
I love their mutton dishes, especially the Keema Mutter and the Bhuna Gosht. Portions are good enough for two people per main dish. A good place to hang out with family as well as friends. Price points are decent, and averagely heavy on the pocket. Overall, a good place to visit if you want a decent drinks plus dining experience in the Dhakuria area.

We went on Saturday evening, the rush hour. we were a group of 14 people - expected a bit of waiting. SO 5 of us was there by 7 pm and rest arrived by 7:30. We waited and waited and finally got the entry at 8:45 :O. that is also not in a group seating arrangement. we got 3 tables of 4 people each. some how we had to manage. a great disappointment to start the evening. we then comes the service. the boy handed over the drinks menu and after 15 mins came to us for the food order. another surprise. we told him we are not even provided with the food menu. then come the third surprise, the table was quite crowed with food items so they just handed over the food bowls and asked us to manage by ourselves.
Quality of food was ok - nothing great s such. internal decor is good. arrangements were good. they should keep some tables for larger groups as well, not all 4 people tables.
I am sure not going to visit the place again.

We visited this place on a Friday evening. After having to wait for around 5-10 mins we were directed to the resto bar section which looked quite new. The bar counter looked amazing. The decor is minimalistic and contemporary. The lights were soothing. I really liked the hanging light above the dining table. The seating was comfortable.

For starters we wanted the Tandoori Pompret but it was unavailable at that time. As per suggestion, we decided to try the Fish Tikka Kebab. 4 pieces of boneless and extremely well cooked and tasty kebab. Main course consisted of Butter Naan and Chicken Rara Masala. This was perhaps the best Butter Naan I had had in quite sometime. So soft with the right amount of butter on it. Unlike the usual Naan which gets hard after sometime, this was smooth. The Chicken Rara Masala was amazing. The pieces just melted in the mouth, so soft and juicy. The curry was spicy and delicious. The Fresh Lime Soda was exceptionally well prepared. The mix was perfect. It was the best of its kind I had had till date.

The staff was courteous and the service was prompt. Overall a very good experience. Would definitely visit again.

Always a favourite in that area.  Visited many times and a couple of days back.  The interior decorations have been changed recently to give a fresher look.  Although I am not fond of soups tommy yum soup is pretty good to start with.  Kebab platter still maintains it's class.  Kabuli Naan is a all time good.  Pulao items are also good.  And for the sippers the road overlooking terrace is a must at night.‚ò∫‚ò∫

We had Kulcha and A plate of Rashmi Butter masala as our dinner and both tasted really great. Kulcha was soft, a creamy taste of the gravy was well relished. People was very friendly. It's a must try place of Dhakuria.

Always a favourite in that area.  Visited many times and a couple of days back.  The interior decorations have been changed recently to give a fresher look.  Although I am not fond of soups tommy yum soup is pretty good to start with.  Kebab platter still maintains it's class.  Kabuli Naan is a all time good.  Pulao items are also good.  And for the sippers the road overlooking terrace is a must at night.‚ò∫‚ò∫

Visited this place few days back with couple of my friends. Ordered four types of kebabs and drinks for syarters. For the main course we ordered biriyani, murgh tikka makhani and some special mutton preparation which the waiter suggested and I must say from the kebabs to the main course and the cocktails were all fantastic. The ambiance was great and the waiter was very friendly. I would definitely suggest everyone to visit this place.

I liked this place a lot; foods are awesome; especially hakka chilli shrimp; chicken lat me kai and bharhaan tangri.. ( last is a must try; have tasted similar item.. chicken tangree kebab stuffed with mutton keema elsewhere too; but to me here its definitely one of the best)...  decor and ambience is so so... but the road side tables will give you the whole view of the busy street.. price is also moderate; only thing that bothered me is the slow service.. otherwise a nice place; value for money...

Visited the place yesterday.  Food was good. Ambience was good enough. We had tandoori bhetki,  taste was great!  Sweet dream, a mocktail was not upto the mark. We also had phad Thai chao Wang was too spicy we had tears in our eyes while having it mixed fried rice and Kung pao chicken tasted great! Staff's behavior is good too!  Will surely visit the place in future!  Good food keep the taste upüëç

I really can't count the innumerable times i have been to this place for fine dining.It's the best place for family fine dining with exotic food and lovely ambience.
Would be visiting on 16th Sunday once again, with my Family for fine dining and to celebrate my daughters birthday.
My recommendation- Chicken Pahari Kebab .

Lately we visited this joint third time! We sat on the 1st floor, balcony seats. Well I quite like the decor. It ws minimalistically sober! The staffs were okay type not very promt though even the services were nt quick, had to knock them bt ya they cooperated at the grievances. Lets come to the food part. We ordered customary Tandoori murg - it ws good nt great and the chutney ws way too sour . We expected the tandoors to be a bit more juicy! Kabuli naan- It ws the 1st tym we had it, so really cant comment on the taste....but it ws sweet with cherry n all....Masala kulcha was good. Mutton ra ra masala- succulent, juicy pieces finally. Quantity is a bit less though. Blackberry breezer <3 . Suggestions would be - some good music, work on promt service, staffs should be a bit more smiling n cheerful, and work on quantity! Wil visit agn!

This place holds a special place in my heart as its a witness of my 1st date! "That table...those 2 chairs all remains the same, only the persons sitting on them have changed!" :p
Well enough of sentimental cracks...lets come to the main business. I have been here quite a few times...mostly for having beer, whisky and some accompaniments while enjoying cricket matches on the big LCD television inside it. The ambience is pretty good and the hospitality of the service personnels is really warm. Food served here is really tasty and of good quality and the pricing is also quite reasonable for the quality of service they offer. Its a perfct place fr a weekend brunch with family or some chitchats with your close ones over an on the rocks peg of whisky with some tandoori chicken.

A friend of mine came from Bangalore so we went for  a drink to this restaurant. We ordered a couple of drinks with chicken tandoori as starter which has some onions with carrots. We asked for a some more   of onions to which Mr.Goswami who was the captain arrogantly informed that it will be chargeable which is totally unheard of. We requested again to provide some onions to which he again rudely declined. If this kind of arrogant behaviour continues then I won't be suggesting anyone to visit this place given the abrupt pricing recently topped up with arrogant and rude behaviour of Mr. U.Goswami.

Tandoor park, a superstar in its own legion is a nice place to be if you are looking for a classy dinner date or a peaceful time with your family . The establishment which falls into the category of "bar cum restaurant" is the almost perfect place to be if you are going after a dinner where you will just on to some good drinks with some excellent kabaabs for company . This is one of those outlets that don't really need a Zomato review to bring folks in as it has already created a niche of its own in and around the Salimpur - Jadavpur - Locality .

¬∞ Location :- If you are coming from Golpark then you would need to go pass dakhshinapan a little and the restaurant will fall on your left side in Dhakuria . If you are coming from jadavpur or Anwar shah then you need to move ahead a little in the direction of dakshinapan mainly between the lanes of jodhpur park after crossing a food joint named "Desi Mehak ".

-------------------------------------------------------
¬∞ FOOD & DRINKS :- We were not in the mood of a full course meal . Our idea was to sip on some alcoholic beverage while munching on to the famed kababs of this restaurant. And our idea was perfect for that night .

COCKTAILS :- 

1. Cosmopolitan ( 4 / 5 ) :-  The most basic vodka based drink which is accompanied with cranberry juice and a freshly squeezed lime . The drink was really good with every sip giving a vodka punch .

2. Sex on the beach ( 5 / 5 ) :- Another vodka based classic cocktail but this time the add on seemed to be peach with a lemon slice on the top . This was the highlight of the evening . We simply loved it . 

Not a big cocktail expert but can easily deduce that they are priced like all other cocktail serving outlets and the making is good enough to be at par with high end restaurants. So, ordering a highball glass of flavoured liquor mixed with crushed ice from here is definitely a good idea .

KABAABS 

1. Bharwan tangree ( 5 / 5 ) :- Okay so the description says chicken leg pieces stuffed with spicy mutton keema and grilled tandoor style.  The intro was good enough to motivate us to order this item and we thanked every bit of it . It was something.  A grand starter dish which left us dreaming for more and also wondering at the same time as to how did they get the keema inside . 4 big leg pieces of chicken are served and when you will look at it , they will seem quite like a normal tangri kabaab . But once you bite in it , you will feel the soft tender chicken and also the excellent keema from the inside . The keema being a tad dry but tasty will compliment very well with your cocktails . This starter dish deserves a standing ovation . You must must have this . 

2. Sarwowali Machi ( 4 / 5 ) :- The mustard fish tandoori was as basic as it could be . 6 moderate sized chunks of bhetki grilled to perfection and spiced with mainly mustard and curd . Once again a fine fish starter and definitely a good choice for the fish starter lovers .


---------------------------------------------------------------

¬∞ AMBIENCE & SERVICE ( 4 / 5 ) :- This is something that needs to be mentioned . The restaurant boasts a classy decor that will be at par with the high end fine dining restaurants. A special mention will go to the 4 person seating that has a glassy view of the bypassing road . It's not the view that impresses but the arrangement and the seating . It is ideal for a group of 4 but excellent for a couple dinner . It becomes a bit crowdy at dinner time but due to the seating arrangement there is ample space and atmosphere for you to have a conversation with your better half and the mood sets it . So, a full marks to the Ambience . We went on a Saturday night where the waiting list was really big so we had to wait for at least 45 minutes so please make sure you go early or have a reservation. From the look of it , dinners at the weekend will be attended by a lot of people. Serving was good as the staff was very professional . One downside was the unavailability of wine which was a tad dissapointing. So, don't go for the wines , have cocktail instead .

¬∞ VERDICT‚Äã :- Definitely, recommended and worthy of a second time visit . Next time will definitely explore the main course or some oriental option . Following are the highlights of the evening :- 

1. Excellent ambience . Perfect for couple dinner or family dinner .

2. Top class kebabs .

3. Classy cocktails .

4. Good hospitality .

Tandoor park was a hit for us . Those who are looking for a high end fine dining restaurant experience can give an attempt here . It will not be a bad idea .

The evening was made amazing by Tandoori Park at dhakuria by their amazing food.
Ordered assorted kabab platter, chilli garlic fried rice with kung-pao fish. 
It's comparable to most fine dining places as the food quality and quantity was above par. 
The decor of the place will make u feel relaxed and comfortable as the sitting arrangements are spaced and contemporary decor.
We also ordered freshlime soda & trust me I had the best sweet fresh lime soda of my life. Blended perfectly.
Summing up a definite visit for sure and 4.5 overall rating. Bon appetite..üòÄ

I am a loyal fan of Tandoor Park for a long time, first, its proximity from my home, second, for the wide variety of food they have in their oeuvre. However, there are few items which I never miss to order every time I visit there, irrespective of the other items those I may order. One of those is Bharwan Tangree. In fact, none of the items I have tried here over the long span of time has disappointed me. Their liquor repository is also worth mentioning. Overall, I highly recommended place...

The place has a decent ambience if you go with friends, nothing fresh out of the box. The service is really slow, on 24th Mar 17 at 10PM, half the food menu was unavailable for order. We still ordered whatever the waiters suggested and recommended us. The behaviour of the staff is pretty bad as they take the customer for granted, request for ice 6 times and you may actually get the ice after the 6th reminder. 

We stayed till 11PM, when the behaviour of the staff was really disrespectful towards the end. I would not recommend this bar as the staff is not cooperative, rather more, they are disrespectful.

Everything was just so perfect,  it made my day,  we tried chinese non-veg salad in starter,  for main course we ordered plain nun and chicken lababdar,  with some vodka and lime juice.

I guess zomato should have a negative marking system.. Then would have given -10 to this place... Extremely rude and callous behaviour of the staff.. Made us wait for more than 35 mints and could not even provide a place for two of us.. They kept us waiting and waiting only to see that people who came after us getting a table... Very sick behaviour...

Location-Located between Dhakuria and selimpore.. just opposite to the lane of jodhpur park ..this is a two storied restaurant
Been there- Twice
Ambiance- A moderate lit place with comfortable sofas and chairs. Bar counter is available. Smoking room is also available.. You will feel it best if you get your seat at the balcony. I went there once. on a rainy evening and it was wow.
Food ordered-  When I went there during Puja time ,I ordered masala kulcha.. Chicken reshmi kebab.. chicken Bharata..
On my second visit,I had Pahari kebab..tandoor bhetki.. chicken tikka kebab along with drinks.
Service - Service is slow for both food and drinks
Food quality-quantity-taste- Food quality is just excellent ! But during Puja time they will reduce their quantity .. You should visit this place again and again because of their tasty food..
My recommendation- Chicken Pahari Kebab

I have been here for last 15 years and at last writing a review. This restaurant has undergone through many changes but never compromised with their service and food. Quality of food remains as good as one wishes it to be. One receives cordial welcome as soon as she enters the restaurant. Even if one has to wait, it is a comfortable one. Any grievance is considered seriously and steps to resolve it is taken immediately. I feel at home when I take somebody here to booze or dine. Well done and keep it up.

Very easy to locate family restaurant located in the proximity of the Dhakuria petrol pump.

It's usually packed on the weekends so have time on your side if you decide to dine here. Also there's no reservation of tables and you have to enlist your name to the door man in a first come first serve basis.

The chosen lights are warm and ambient. There's usually no to little music playing in the background which makes it great for conversing while dining. 

Coming to the food, they serve a great tangdi kebab and chicken Bharta. I tried an old fashioned cocktail here which was a little too light and needed more whiskey.

Good food! I live really close by and hence have sampled a fair bit of their menu. Their biryani is very well made, with good quality rice, tender meat and no oiliness. Amount is satisfactory too. Their shawarma and shawarma salad is very tasty and filling, although the dressing they use is very different from shawarma dressings I've had elsewhere. Their kebabs are pretty decent too- in fact their entire Mughlai menu is tasty and reasonable. The ambience is fairly classy for a budget neighborhood restaurant. Overall, a good joint.

Tandoor park is the place in DHAKURIA  if you want to, have good food and booze at the same time with pocket pinch which is good. Staff is friendly and the place is always buzzing with people and with their new renovation they have more seating area nd if you are visiting on a weekend then u will get waiting time. Must have r rara masala and butter naan.

Considered to be an important occasion of young people ie Saraswati pujo we 6 people reached to have our long awaited lunch with all excitement in our eyes and stomach. Nearly we did wait for another 1 hour almost to get a table out there but when we reached at the second floor there were many empty lying tables at the window site area and they said they just opened it nevermind the time was 3:30 and we waited another half an hour to get our food and another 10 minutes to get our bill.
The location and area in square meter are excellent.
Forget about food the service and hospitality was not satisfactory.
Remembering about food it was just average.¬†
Rates were a bit descent.¬†
Still you may give it a try but i would suggest do not.
Happy dinning.

I have been to this restaurant for a dozen times or more. The ambience, service and value for money are really good. The long menu includes a combination of tandoori and other flavours; both worth trying. The cocktails and the range of beer, rum and whiskey are impressive. @Sourabrata Das

I would have given it 4.0, but for their steadfast refusal to take credit cards for deliveries. The food is decent but I was surprised at how inflexible they were in accepting cards, making it inconvenient for the consumer but more importantly presenting themselves poorly.

Ohh i have fallen in love with tandoor park..  i visited the place with my fiance on our anniversary.. the man outside the gate is so humble in his behaviour.. all the staff were very welcoming and frindly..  they have ask to take the corner seat and it was good .. we ordered rice,  chicken rara masala, tandoori chicken.. each and every dish is mind blowing.. the shallots served with the maincourse is yummy.. the tandooru chicken peices were huge.. it made our tummy almost full
. The brownie with ice cream waa awesome.. one should definitely try this .. tandoor park made our day

Honestly in love with this place! Was amazed by the hospitality of the people out there at such a rush hour on 25th of December!! It was my second visit over there... Previously I visited their with a group and the service was very good along with the food...so decided to check in again on 25th along with my sweetheart! 
Location : located near Jodhpur park just beside Kathleen... Opposite of sugar n spice.
Ambience : very much cozy and comfortable... Staffs are very polite and helpful and behaviour is also very good. 
Food : as I said in love with the place...for what.  Of course for food!! Food are tasty and also quantity is optimum.. We settled for carslberg beer,chicken Reshmi  kebab, mutton biryani, chicken rara masala and masala kulcha... Previously we had murg mussullam... Biryani, naan along with virgin mohito, beer n whisky!! Food were warm n perfectly cooked. . tasty and also service is very good... They went for 2nd time n warm the food for us on busy hour even! Price is also reasonable... Would like to drop in again!! :)

Visited this place few days back with a bunch of friends. A lot of people had suggested this place to me. 
It was a sheer disappointment.
First of the ambience and decor is amazing and that is probably the only good thing about this  place.
Alcohol prices are slightly cheaper than the joints on park street.
The service and the food sucks. Honestly.
We ordered  flat rice noodles and it came covered with red chili powder. It was too hot for my taste buds. We also ordered chicken tangri kebab which was slightly better than the rest. We tried  crispy fried lamb which  was hard and chewy. Next we had fried rice and shanghai chicken.
The rice was preety much boiled, white rice with scrampled eggs and a few pieces of chicken. There was no hint of flavour and I think even I can cook better fried rice.
To add to our disapppointment, there was a LONG HAIR at the bottom of the fried rice bowl. When we informed the staff about it, they were reluctant to change it, but finally they did.
The shanghai chicken was not even close to the actual shanghai flavors. At best it was ordinary.
The quantity  was not at par with the pricing. The chicken pieces were miniscule and there were  hardly 12 pieces  in each  plate.
Visit  this place at our own risk.

A good place to hang out with friends. The most negative point here is the service, its slower than a tortoise. A lot of improvement is needed. Ambience wise its fine. Tried the assorted kebab but the fish turned out to be stale or uncooked dont know. Rann tandoor tasted good but i had better than this in some other places. The sole winner i would tell the sweet n sour prawn. The brownie with ice cream was tasty but it took almost 30mins to get served. Again i would say lot to be done in all aspects.

This place is close to my house at Jodhpur Park. Today , I ordered through Zomato at 7 PM but till 9.30 PM both Zomato & Tandoor Park assured that the order is in the process of delivery and delay is due to 'huge rush'. At 9.45 PM, Tandoor Park called me and informed that no such order has been placed by Zomato and so 'sorry'! What a cheat both Zomato & Tandoor Park is! Beware before placing order through Zomato! This is my 3rd such experience with Zomato !

b) atlast food served but garlic nun was undercooked...
c) was not served water before food and had to search for the waiter to ask for drinking water...

This kind of service not expected... Owner pls pull up ur socks... Reputation at stake.....

Located just opposite Jodhpur park post office, tandoor park is a okayish place to go for Chinese and north indian food. The latter is a better option though.
Had been here pretty many times, they offer you with decent service. Courteous staff, good food, fair prices (as any standard family restaurant would cost you) and a nice ambience as well.
My suggestion is to go for their kebabs have tastes most of em, and they are yum.
For chinese, the prawn dishes and fish are a yes.

Recently they have undergone some renovations,and it looks all the more attractive now :D

NOT TO WORRY!!

Tandoor Park is the place for you my friends.

Amazing ambiance,fantastic food,sexy service and a beautiful bar!What else do you need when you're looking for a place to spend some good and gala time,alone or with your gang.

Tandoor Park had swoon me off my feet with it's appetizer "Drums of Heaven".

The chicken smells absolutely amazing,looks gorgeous and tastes even better!!

Well seasoned and well cooked with the right amount of crisp in the bite and a slight hint of spice in it brings out the Indie flavours and mama mia boy do you enjoy it!!

Trust me folks you cannot just have one plate of this appetizer and get satisfied!Talking from my own experience,order atleast two plates of this baby.

Well a spicy juicy appetizer with some liquor (vodka) goes really well.

Do visit the place for an amazing experience and comfort tasty food within affordable price.

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

This is my comfort place to be. I somehow love this place for their ambiance as well as food. Perhaps because of college day memories. Food always tastes superb here, be it tandoori chicken or crispy chilly mushrooms, the two dishes I extremely like. Prices are reasonable as well.
Only downside might be that on weekends and holidays the queue is too long.

Ambiance, good. Beautiful in fact. There is no replacement of the feeling that you get while sipping cold beer and watching the hubbub downstairs through the blinds.

However, this is a place that charges twice for a 650-ml beer bottle (plus taxes) ¬†and doesn't even have good beer brands at its disposal. This used to be my father's go to place, but me, I don't find anything special with this place.¬†

The Reshmi Kebab is so-so, a little bit dry, but for the premium price they charge, it comes to a matter of quality, and not quantity. I expected a lot more juiciness from the meat. The minty-green chutney again, was a disappointment. It just wasn't going with the flavor of the kebab.

Overall, ambiance wise this is a nice experience. Food and alcohol wise, this was a so-so experience.

Would I go again? Maybe.

Went there today with a group of 15 friends. The staffs present there were really quick enough to make arrangements for our seating. After we settled down they were patient enough to wait until we decided our order.. We ordered for Assorted non-veg kebab platter and chilli baby corn as starters..

The assorted kebeb platter consited of one piece of tandoori chicken, 4 pieces of mutton seekh,3 pieces of chicken pahari kebab, 3 pieces of chicken tikka kebab, 1 piece of fish tikka kebab. The kebabs tasted good but the quality of chicken and fish used could have been a bit better.

The chillu babycorn was lip-smacking. And tge quantity was good enough for two people to share.

For the main course we ordered Murg Mussallam, Chicken Rara Masala, Kadai Paneer and Butter naan.

Murg Mussalam was a whole chicken stuffed with mutton keema in a rich gravy with one egg and a potato. It was awesome.. The gravy was rich and tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. At first they had served the whole chicken but on our request they cut it into small pieces and then served it.. It was lip-smacking and went really really well with those soft butter naans.

The Chicken Rara Masala had 6 succulent chicken pieces in a rich gravy. It was almost like chicken tikka masala with a thicker and richer gravy. The dish was also really good.

Kadai paneer was the only one dish which i didn't like because it had a very overpowering smell of coriander powder. 

The service was prompt and the ambience was simple but nice.. The prices are reasonable as well..
The only think that I would want them to do is make use of a bit better quality chicken..  Otherwise all the dishes were really good.

Was very satisfied with my experience at Tandoori Park. Located opposite to the Petrol Pump in Dhakuria more, we had Fried Baby Corn for starter which set up the mood very well. We had Chicken Biriyani for our main course along with Veg Malai Kofta, Chicken Labbabdar and Murg Tikka Makhani. The Malai Kofta tasted very good for someone like me but for my veggie friend, it did seem a bit away from the authentic one. Chicken Labbabdar and Murg Tikka Makhani tasted delightful for me as well. All in all, a good experience. The place will prove handy for someone looking to give a birthday treat within the 2500/- range for 9 people.

On the whole a nice place where you get cheap ish booze with decent tandoori food. The tandoori chicken and the kebabs are above average . The seating is a little old school like the typical esplanade bars. With the advent of so many new concept, fusion and theme restaurants this one being now so new and not so old needs some serious reinvention 

All time favourite would be the fish finger with tarter sauce

The staff of this restaurant have the worst behaviour ever. They served the food at 11.30pm and at 11.40pm they took the payment and switched off the AC. Didn't even allow us to eat the food. Upon asking to switch on the AC they replied it can't be switched on and that they have given us enough time to eat. The entire restaurant staff is very very bad. Food is good but hospitality is horrifying and pathetic! I would suggest everybody never never go to this restaurant.

A difficult place to find out at first, once you're inside its a really pleasant and soothing ambience. Especially those dim lights make you feel a bit more close to your loved ones , this place has it all. Though the waiter seemed a bit confused when i ordered food and drinks together, nevertheless, their serive was nice and apt. Order whatevr u want there, cz they all are great and tasty, but dont miss out on their CRISPY LAMB!! alongside drinks . I mean in one word its DIVINE !!! Its simply Out of the world !!! The price is quite ok for a resturant. Go have a try there, you'll love it :)

I visited the place several times, foods are great.. ambience is quite appreciable, did not experience anything unpleasant.. their sizzlers are great.. chicken sizzler and prawn sizzlers (they provided 6 medium sized prawn along with vegetables toasted in mayonnaise and french fries) are delicious. Starters are also good.. its a nice place to hang out with friends nd also to dine with families in any occasion. Will visit more often. Bt the only thing that bothers is the amount of time they take for serving the food.. service is nt so good.. bt otherwise ie. In terms of food and decor the place is quite awesome.

Living so near to tandoor park, yet I never visited this place earlier. This time during the pujas me and a few of my friends visited to this place for lunch. 


Located just by the main road. And they have two entrance. The front one. And there's another by the lane. The Guard asked to move to the 2nd floor.


The 2nd floor is a restro cum bar with good seating arrangements for both big and small number of peoples. The ambiance is pretty good and they have a smoking area as well. 

The stuff were good even when there was a huge rush during the pujas. Kudos to that. 

We ordered,

1. Crispy chilli babycorn 
2. Veg Fried rice
3. Chilli chicken 

For drinks we ordered, 

1. Foster strong
2. Tuborg strong 
3. Tuborg green 

The service was fast. Overall a good experience. Would love to visit again.

I was there today, I am sharing the worst ever experience to have dinner in Tandoor park. Ordered mixed fried rice and Hunan chicken. There were bad smell coming from the mixed fried rice. Taste less fried rice along with a bad smell. Hunan chicken pieces were too small in size. Chicken pieces are like hard to chewing also, no taste. I will never try this restaurant in future. Total wastage of money as can't ate at all. Unpleasant, unhealthy food served.

The food is Average, nothing extraordinary, drinks were on the cheaper side. We sat on the second floor, which I guess is it's drink only section, which serves food if you please. This restaurant neither disappoints nor excites you, as it's one among the many many bar cum restaurant in kolkata. Nothing fancy, but still enjoying its existence.

My cousin was raving about the place for some time and finally I visited here along with him. Located just by the main road, initially was confused about the entrance as the main gate had close sign. Later we saw another entrance in a bylane and the guard asked to go to the 2nd floor.

The 2nd floor is resto-bar and ambiance is pretty much nice with comfortable seating arrangements. As we had other plans, so we went with starters and couple of drinks and the review is based on it only.

They have modified the menu on the occasion of Durga Puja and most of the stuffs were removed from the initial one. We ordered for Chicken drumsticks and fish fingers along with tuborg strong and green. 

Chicken drumsticks were ok but the sauce provided along with it was quite bland. Fish fingers were served with mayonnaise and was pretty good. They both complemented beer nicely.

The final amount came around 1.1k so pricing is ok. Heard that their main courses are good so will surely be trying it out next time I am around the vicinity.

A very flamboyant atmosphere welcomes you as you step in . With yellow lamps hanging over each table making the place look so gorgeous and perfectly done walls with posters , you are sure to fall for it's interiors.
We ordered,
CHICKEN TANGREE KABAB- it had 4 chicken leg pieces cooked in tandoor style and stuffed with mutton kima .it was soft, smoky with the perfect balance of spices.
SPECIAL CHICKEN BIRIYANI- what's special about this was some more rice and two chicken pieces with an egg. The biriyani was light but perfect .
TANDOORI ROTI
CHICKEN RARA MASALA- boneless chicken served in thick and spicy red gravy. The chicken pieces were very soft.
SWEET DREAMS MOCKTAIL- it looked alluring. It had mixed fruit juices with vanilla ice cream, tasted out of the world. It was beauty with great taste ! Must try.
The mocktails there are exquisitely served making them irresistible. You must try one of them when you drop in.
The price is kept reasonable and the service is fast.
Must visit for some delectable food. :)

I visited this place with a friend, on Sunday evening. It started out fine and we got a seat for two. The place was crowded but did not feel cramped. We chose a starter quite easily (Fried Chilli Mushrooms) and placed an order for the same. We decided to give a little more thought to the drinks and asked the waiter to come back in a few minutes. BIG MISTAKE. We waited and we waited and then we waited some more. We tried to call the waiter at least 4 to 5 times, because by this time we were sitting idle for almost half an hour. He blew us off every single time and made us feel like we are asking him to serve us for free. After a long wait,¬† the Fried Chilli Mushrooms arrived. I wish now that I had clicked a picture of the same. It was greasy and fried almost till it was burnt. Nevertheless, we thought that now perhaps the waiter will finally take our order, but were we mistaken! He just put the plate on the table and darted off.¬†¬† 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This was the final straw and we decided that we will not spend any more of our time or money, at this place. We finished as much of the food as we could and asked for the bill. Before leaving, we decided to inform the manager about the less than adequate service that we received. AGAIN. BIG MISTAKE. The manager looked at us as if we are speaking in some alien language and then asked us to wait for 1 moment and vanished. We left, obviously. While boarding the lift, he bumped into us and ran off looking at the floor.

So, to sum up, bad food, worst service I have ever experienced anywhere, clueless management.. what is wrong with this place? I used to frequent this place a couple of years back and I have never received such treatment.

I have been here innumerable number of times now! Excelent food!! but yes there is a dilema i have faced! If you and your company are all stags the stag entry is just behind the main entry.. Try asking the staff for stag entry and they will show you.
A good amount of crowd is always gathered in front of the joint trying¬†to secure a table. This place serves alcohol so wine and dine is an option.
Ambiance is really good. Decorations are savvy and to the mark.
Food here is good!! But you need to know what you should order to really get the charm outta this joint.If You love Mutton i have a dish for you that if you have will always pull you towards this place.Go and Order "BHUNNA GOSHT" They will serve you 4 solid mutton pieces cooked with a gravy made of mutton keema!! Trust me on this you'v never tasted something like this until you have tried It.Kebabs were Very well prepared. The meat was tender and perfect to calm down the raging fire in my stomach. I also tried chinese here! Not bad is my verdict.¬†Deffinitely a joint you would like to visit with family or friends! Do drop bye and fulfill your meat cravings here.

Ordered nun and side dish, nun was a bit tight, seemed it was kept from last night, we called the waiter and told them about it, and he himself took our plates and made sure we got freshly cooked nun, and yes, he gave us one extra too! ;)
Amazing service!

This place is very easy to locate, and the restraunt is adjacent a main road, which increases the ease of accessibility. No prior reservation is necessary, and a table will be provided for within a maximum of 10 minutes tops. Coming to the ambience, it was dim lit, a trend vastly followed by the so called 'fancy eateries' of the city of joy. The staff were well behaved , eventhough we had a small glitch of rough talk , which was equally faulty on our side too, miscommunication to blame. Now coming to the food, the quality was really good, but only if we could say the same about it's quantity and pricing. We ordered Two plates of chicken bharta, a plate each of mutton and chicken kurchan and a lot of butter nans . Though the kurchans were nothing special , the bharta sure was, as the creaminess that it offered compelled us to order another helping to treat our overexcited taste buds. Naans had ample butter and were served in a tokri ( basket for my overeducated folks :p ). The drinks too were not as costly as some other fancy eateries out there in the market, but my concern was definitely the fact that for the quantity it was offering, the price charged was way to high, as a bowl of either was barely enough for a single person, with not so extraordinary appetites. Nevertheless the place is good and if you really dont mind spending those extra bucks to celebrate an auspicious occasion , you will definitely have a gala time .

The ambience is really very nice. The service was also  very apt. The assorted kebab platter (non veg ) was really very good. The lemon honey chicken was so so. The phad Thai Chao Wang was really good. The brownie with vanilla ice-cream is just yummy.

Looks small from outside though, but pretty good inside. It's bar cum restaurant. Fully air conditioned and comfortable sofas.
Ordered nun and side dish, nun was a bit tight, seemed it was kept from last night, we called the waiter and told them about it, and he himself took our plates and made sure we got freshly cooked nun, and yes, he gave us one extra too! ;)
Amazing service!

No prior reservation is necessary, and a table will be provided for within a maximum of 10 minutes tops.

This eatery is an all time favourite of mine.Their food- tasty and delicious,served with right flavour and warmth.Their decor-cosy and chill which will relieve you from the outside heat.The welcoming behaviour and courteous staff will make you go there over and over again.Their hit item is Tandoori chicken-anytime blindfolded you can order this item and come back home with a heavy stomach and a smile.It is awfully delicious, jucy and typical Punjabi styled spicy.The Indisna dishes are the toppers here none the less sizzlers and chinese dishes are also yummy!!!the rating is just right for this eatery .Any time of the day you will find this restaurant filled with people yet quiet and soothing.I highly recommend this one.

I have visited this place quite a few times: with friends, with family and also as couple. Every time I found the distinct charm of this restaurant attractive in different ways. First of all, the food is just awesome, whether its a mughlai dish or a Chinese one. And then comes the ambiance. Apart from food, the quality of drinks too are good enough.

Only con is that, during the Puja days they restricts the menu to only a few items and the quality of the food degrades a lot due to the high jump in the number of customers.

We look for Blue Riband Gin but to our surprise it was not available in such a big bar.. The Waiter suggests us to opts for another brand(forgot the brand) together with Tonic Water instead of lime cordial.. but the combination did not work for both of us.. We ordered Salt and Pepper Prawn.. the quality of the prawn and it tastes really good.. Finally we are back to basics n ordered for Special Mutton Biriyani(Don't get cheated with 3 piece of mutton.. they offer only two..üòä).. which really upto the mark and made the day actually..

There is nothing much to write about this restaurant. I think it is there right from my birth. When there was not so much boom in this restaurant culture, from then I use to visit this place with my parents. But then there was a long gap and after almost 6 years I paid another visit with my friends for our post graduation celebration.
Now the entry is from the back and they extended up to third floor I guess. This new floor's decor is aesthetically sound and have some nice paintings and lot of space.
I ordered a Chicken Steak and Fresh Lime Soda. I never tasted their stake before. It was good if not heavenly. The Chicken Drumsticks were also very succulent.
The new get up made me feellike taste and quantity will change, but surprisingly I find the menu and the presentation developed on the contrary.

Items Tried : Bharwan Tangree kebab (Recommended),Murg musallam,Keema naan,Assorted kebab platter,Special mutton biryani,Tooty fruity, Chicken Pahari kebab,Prawn Coriander soup,Egg Chicken Fried Rice,Chicken Manchurian.

All the items were reasonably priced.

Tandoor Park is located on the main road just opposite Jodhpur Park post office. The decor is very minimal and the lighting is quite dim. The staff is quite cordial. Although they serve great chinese, I am a bigger fan of their North Indian. The kebabs that are my personal favourite are their lasuni tikka, boti kebab and paneer tikka. They serve amazing biriyani too. The naan and dal makhni is delicious too. 

Thus if you want to have a great time and great food hop in to Tandoor park.

Last we went there,nice ambiance, good decor,we ordered lime soda and a bharwa tangri kabab.the kababs were so juicy and full of stuffed keema,something very new and taste awesome. Then we ordered keema naan,veg polao and bhuna ghost. Polao was nice,with the smell of ghee,bhuna ghost was mutton pieces cooked in a keema gravy,it was awesome, a little heavy, but taste nice,the only let down was,the keema paratha lacks the stuffing a little. Want to specialy mention about our server-he was a gentleman, helped us to choose the tastiest menu,my husband can't eat much spicy food,he heard his concern and made the gravy a little less spicy,even after closing the bar,he got me my sweet lime soda,a big thanks to him and all the staffs are really nice there.so  a very nice place with good staff and good food.

As the name implies, they specialize in tandoor items like Tandoori Chicken, Tangdi Kebab, Paharia Kebab, hariyali kebab, special mention for stuffed tangdi kebab.

Located in Dhakuria, it's pretty easy to spot. Well the first time I saw this place from the outside, didn't look fancy at all and I was a bit skeptical of trying it out. Nevertheless, went in as I had heard they make sensational murg musallam. Well, they didn't have it that day, but the food is very nice indeed. Ordered naan, Chicken tikka masala, tandoori kabab and biriyani. All of them delicious. Have ordered in a couple of times. Do try out the tangri kabab. It is delectable. 
Talking about the ambience, I wasn't really impressed. Service was quick. Pocket friendly.

I don't know why didn't I write a review for this earlier, for I have been to this place like 100 times. Whenever we have to plan a super-quick dine out, tandoor park is the first name to come up in my mind. Well, a year ago I would have rated this place a little strictly, but now it has upgraded itself to a first class experience. The food options are really plenty and mouth watering. Be it Chinese or tandoori dish. And a wide range of liquor too.... but the showstoppers are the cocktails, man! They are something! I have never tasted anything like Smirnoff gulabo or Smirnoff thandai anywhere else. Their hospitality is one thing worth mentioning, but dare you order anything after 10.30pm! They are just too strict about their last order and closing time! However... I just love this place.

Visited this place twice, and i must say it absolutely stood up to the mark. As it provide both food and drinks, so rating will be done in overall. Standard Drinks are available starting from beer to whiskey to scotch. Prices are regular (not so less and not too high)
Coming to the food, as the name suggests they serve soft, tender hot kebabs. Biriyani and chicken butter masala is a must try.
Ambience is cosy, but in order to enjoy your meal with a view, its recommended that take your sittings in the balcony area where you get the view of the whole dhakuria road.
Pocket punch is standard.
P.S. Alcohol consumption is injurious to health -.-

Location: Dhakuria
Ambience: old school, spacious, well lit, amazing looking bar counter, comfortable seats, very pretty sight. üòä
Service: Prompt. People are extremely friendly, courteous and attentive. Have been going to this place for a long time so they literally know us by our faces.
Food/Beverage: North Indian is amazing here, the tandoori chicken, the kababs, keema Naan are fab. You get Chinese here as well which I know you'd be skeptical to order because duh it says Tandoor park. However even the Chinese is quite good here ( do try the drums of heaven). Quality and quantity both are on point. Never had to complain about anything. They serve alcohol here and there are times when people solely come here for drinks.
Pocket pinch: The food is quite reasonable here and even on eating a lavish 4 course meal won't burn a hole in your pocket. Alcohol is of the standard restaurant price.
Must visit. üòä

They have awesome people at service, very nice ambiance specially their newly open 2nd floor section, they have different sitting arrangements for stags and family/couple, both are good. I have tested almost everything from their menu, it is "Tandoor Park" and they really compliment it to fullest. They serve really tasty Chinese Dishes. My favorites are drums of heaven, lat me kai, crispy fried american corn, bharwan tangri in starter , phad ¬†thai noodles, fried fish and chips, mocktails are also good, alcohol are at moderate price. Best restaurant in south kolkata of this type.Few have rated this with less starts, don't know what they expect more, their comments says they were satisfied in everybit. I jus love this place.

Well if you are looking for a decent place,with good and ambience, which is not hard on your pockets..then this is the place to be. So go there with your boys group or with your special someone, you would feel at home and happy. The food is good and the service better.

Last month I have been there with my school friend or her treat, The envio was so good we loved it,

We have ordered

1> Lazeez Tangree Kabab

2>Bhetki Tandoor Fish

3> Chicken Biriyani

4> ChickenReshmi Butter Masala

Though the food was so good and yummy !! 

The mangement was too slow and rude, we kept on calling them to take the order, they ignored.

They gave glass for half of the people we kept on  asking for more glass. I found they should work on their management team ASAP.

Tortoise service!
I have visited this restaurant before and I came back for the good food only. I was not aware of the service I saw today.  I found many people complaining about the poor service.
About the food:
The Lazeez tangri kabab was just perfect. Just the perfect tandoor. Green mystique mocktail- don't do any justice to the name!

Tandoor park is the reunion point of my college buddies. We used to hangout there a lot. My most favourite item over there is chicken sizzler. Its really mouth watering. I even eat all the veggies that been accompained with the sizzler. Staff behaviour is good. Chinese food over there is quite tasty. But i dont like the biriyani at all.

I discovered Tandoor Park (or TP as I call it) more than 2 years ago and it has stuck with me since then. I frequent this place mostly during weekends as I find the ambiance perfect for relaxed evenings accompanied with drinks and good food - a combo few places in South Kolkata can offer at such decent prices.¬†

The "tandoor" in their name would suggest they specialize in tandoori, kebabs, and mughlai dishes, but I tend to differ. And while I love their Bharwan Tangri¬†and assorted kebeb platter, I find their Chinese a wee bit more alluring. My favorites are - Fried Chilli Mushrooms, Fried Spicy Chicken, ¬†Crispy Fish Dry Chilli, Fish Fingers (not Chinese though)¬†as appetizers, their soups (especially their Manchow soup is amazing), Chinese Chopsuey (enough to fill up two hungry tummies and their variety of veggies in the gravy is by far the best I've come across in the city, topped off with a fried egg and served with a side of crunchy fried noodles, this classifies as a perfect snack to satiate the evening hunger pangs).¬†

I used to love their Chicken and Bhetki Sizzlers¬†too. The succulent chunk of grilled chicken/whole bhetki served with a decent portion of grilled veggies, all generously coated in BBQ sauce was more than I had bargained for and it was a love at first bite. However, during my last visit a couple of weeks back I was disappointed with the changes they've made to their sizzlers - dry chicken, reduced veggie portion, a tiny bit of coleslaw and 4-6 french fries (yes I counted them!), that amazing BBQ sauce was sorely missing. Seriously TP? why change something that was already so good?¬†

When it comes to the main course, you can order any of their noodles, fried rice, and almost any Chinese side dish and you're guaranteed a satisfying meal. Can't say the same for their Indian main course dishes. I find all of their gravy dishes tasting almost the same and it gets boring after a couple of times. Their naans¬†are super-soft and yummy though. As for the biryani, all I can say is there are many places that serve better biryani.¬†

Overall, TP is great for spending time with friends over drinks, tasty appetizers, and kebabs, and if you're craving some good Chinese for lunch/dinner. The ambiance with neither-too-dim-nor-too-bright lights definitely earns more brownie points from me.

Tandoor Park is old establishment that been standing tall at Jodhpur Park More. If you are coming from dhkuria, it will appear to your left. I had visited this place long back, when every corner of the city wasn't flooded with restaurants and one had to do some travelling to reach any food establishment. It's a reasonably big place with nice ambiance and staff slightly old schoolish. They server alcohol, also north indian and chinese cuisine. And I had Chinese there- don't ask my why, I have no clue. But the food was quite delicious. I especially remember their American Chopsuey ( coz I was having a craze for American Chopsuey at that time, so everywhere i went I had that) , it was quite delicious!!

Visited this restaurant with 5 other friends. They serve alcohol. Parking might be a problem given it is on the main road!
Ample seating arrangements, can be classified as a family restaurant. The servers were really nice.
Their food quality is inconsistent, for example their chicken dishes tasted okay but their keema was outstanding! But recommended for sure!

Now also visited their bar which is spacious, ambiance is good.. They provide chanachur complimentary taste good..

Waiters are friendly and know their jobs well.. Recently a takeaway outlet also has opened, rolls are good there..

Pocket pinch is friendly

After yesterday's dinner I realise I should add Tandoor Park in my favourite restaurant list as per my food choices. If you love mughlai foods like kebabs this one of the best restaurant in my suggestion. Its pretty affordable because in our dinner we ate like hungry giants but the bill haven't cross 2000.(3 prsn)
On other side price of alcohol also pocket friendly. I went to the 1st floor I think the Ambience could be more better this is the only observation other than that this restaurant is superb. Love it. :)

Tandoor Park at dhakuria is quiet an old place. Having passed by this place a lot of times, I decided to try it out one day. We were in a mood to snack so we called for tandoori chicken which was delicious and a fish tikka... Which tasted ok but I did not like the quality of the fish. The service was just decent enough and the ambience was simple :)

Tandoor Park is quite an old restaurant located in Dhakuria/Jodhpur Park area. I visit there 1-2 times every month. There is a family section and a separate section for males. It is a very well maintained restaurant with nice ambiance and a huge choice of dishes. While I certainly didn't try all of them but the one's I did are of good quality, if not best. Also, the quantity of food is just enough. It is a bit high on range for both food and drinks. If you like to drink and have some munching, the pocket pinch for two should be around 1000-1200. Staffs are good, services are perfectly timed. It is definitely a worth visiting this place if you like to enjoy your food and drink in less noisy places.

Packed with a smoking area. We ordered some mixed fried rice. With Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Rara Masala and Chivken in hot garlic soup. For dessert we ordered an 'As You Like It' icecream. Service was quick and helpful. Food was delicious. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. With a bar available, it's a place you can't miss out on.

8. 2 chicken bhartaThe entrees were good.Being somebody who has had lat me kai in a lot of restaurants,I found this one a little different.They were more like round chicken pieces that had been pan fried.It tasted good,nonetheless.The butter naan was out of this world.Loved it.So was the chicken raara.I was really disappointed with the chicken bharta.Lacked flavor. Had it not been for this dish,I would have rated it 4 out of 5.The bill amount was rs.3030.Pretty reasonable.Would definitely go back again.

The food is just amazing!! We tried chicken rara masala with butter naan and nolen gur icecream! All of which is a must try!the rara masala was the best chicken gravy dish I have ever tried!cravers of spicy dishes must must must try it!!the nolen gur icecream was melting in the mouth- it also has suttle grains of the solidified gur that could be felt at places-simply amazing! A must try!!as far as food and service is concerned it scored full marks!!the only thing I didn't like is the ambience-i saw beautiful photos of colorful roofs and nice bright yellow lightings but we were made to sit at the bar cum restaurant area at the 2nd floor dat barely had any colorful furnishing at all!it was all soberly done which wasn't bad but nothing compared to the pics I saw in zomato! But yes I am definitely definitely going to try this place again and hopefully next time I too will get to sit under the colorful roof setting!

A place I had been planning to go since a long time. Finally visited this restaurant today. The restaurant is located on the main road near dhakuria so it's very easy to locate. Next comes the food; probably one of the best food my taste buds have had ever experienced. Had ordered chicken rara masala along with butter naan,both on the waiter's recommendation. The chicken rara masala is an unique preparation,very spicy and delicious. The butter naan was deftly made and very soft which made it melt very easily in the mouth. Next tried out nolengurer ice cream. It was super yummy. The service received was very appreciable. The ambience too is classy. I would like to say that the place serves innovative and extremely delicious food. Many new dishes to try out. The food,the ambience, the hospitality everything was so good that I would definitely pay another visit.

We ordered chicken tandoori and fried fish first. I liked the fish more. Then coming to main course, they served us with a good quantity of gravy noodles and I LOVED their mandarin fish. The ice-cream was also good as dessert. Overall, a happy meal it was.

One of the few places in the heart of South Kolkata which serves hard drinks along with lip smacking dishes. The main USP about this place is the availability of Alcoholic drinks. I visited this restaurant on a saturday evening to celebrate a friend's b'day and to my surprise the place has changed a lot since my last visit which was a few years back. The glitz & glamour quotient has increased exponentially with fancy lightings, elegant decor and comfortable seating. The waiters have become more professional with increased knowledge about the dishes being served and also their etiquettes. Along with beer we ordered a portion of their signature dish Bharwan Tangdi and Pepper Fish. The Bharwan Tangdi was grilled a notch higher but the recipe of putting keema inside a chicken leg is an all time hit. The star of the night was Pepper Fish. Perfectly tangy along with being crispy makes this item a perfect snack to have with beers and other drinks. My friends also went for Fried Chilli Mushroom and they praised it a lot but sadly due to allergies i avoided the mushroom. Along with all these a friend also ordered for two cocktails by the name 'Sweet Dreams' & 'Honeymoon'. He was all praise for the former one but sounded pretty disappointed about the latter. Overall it was a fun outing with all the drinks and finger foods and i was quite satisfied with what they had to offer.

We were searching for a place to eat on Shoshti. Bumped into this place.

And I visited the place again; last month.
Two different types of experience, though.

Pujas: We were a group of 7. Ordered chilli garlic noodles. Prawn hakka and chicken hakka noodles. For the side dish we had sanghai chicken and hunan chicken.
Maybe it was the pujo-crowd, or just our hard luck. But the chicken pieces in hunan chicken was just stale. They were smelling. And after one bite, we could have no more.
Sad thing is; when informed; the management didnt pay any heed to it.
1 star for that.

Last month: Ordered butter naan and masala naan. Kadai paneer ar chicken bharta. The side dishes were both good, quantity too, was ample.
The naan was tasty too.

Three stars to that.

Disappointing! I have heard so many good reviews about this restaurant but my overall experience couldn't match with the plethora of good reviews posted in favor of this restaurant by other foodies. With the sudden rush of compliments and praises this page was receiving, I thought of dropping here sometime soon and finally managed to do so 2-3 weeks back! Took an auto from 8B and it dropped me right infront of this restaurant.

The ground floor seems to be reserved only for families and hence the guard instructed me to head on to the 2nd or 3rd floor (Don't remember the floor). I tried to find my way around but got confused seeing no other entry point. I had to literally come down the footpath and turn right out of curiosity before I saw another guard sitting on a tool to realise this was perhaps the other way around to head upstairs. This person accompanied me to the lift and guided me to the correct floor. As soon as I entered, I discovered that this was a bar-cum-restaurant. That is this is the area where they probably serve drinks and hence there is a sepparate section for families downstairs. The place was kind packed but I managed to find myself an empty table and sat down.

Glanced into the menu for sometime and decided to order for Crispy Fried Chicken for dine-in. Wanted to have some shakes or juice, wen the waiter attending me, suggested to try one of their special beverages, which had a Litchi base. I promptly agreed. Just to mention, my take-away order comprised of Assorted Non-Veg Kebab platter, Tandoori Roti, and Chicken Rara Masala.

The food took some-time to come up to my table. The time was so long that I had to make use of their open smoking zone to kill myself time. The Crispy chicken arrived in some time sooner. And I must say, it didn't look like the way I was expecting it to be. It had some sort of a 'Pakora' like appearance. The Chicken was soft, the batter was minimal. The quantity of chicken inside the batter was also hearty. The sauce however lacked a bit of punch. Although, I have a strong aversion against anything 'chilly', I found this way sweet to my liking and not matching the description of Chilly sauce to be served along with the fried chicken.

The first disappointment commenced with their special beverage. It was served in a glass, one would probably have wine or mocktails. The beverage consisted of plain Litchi juice with the foamy portion of perhaps Vanilla or Two in One Ice Cream placed over it. The foamy portion lacked any flavor whatsoever and I failed to understand why it was placed over the Litchi juice in the first place. The drink was small in quantity and I could get a packaged juice from Real or Tropicana at Rs. 100 with far more in quantity than I was served here.

Nevertheless, I finished up on my meal and ordered for the bill and my parcel. The bill was arrived soon but I was made to wait for my packet inspite of the fact that it was ordered nearly 45-50 minutes back. The parcel arrived in another 10 minutes and some guy came over and kept it on a table. The waiter who was apparently dealing with me was standing right there busy with some other important things and did not realise that my parcel had arrived, until I pinged him after 2 minutes of waiting impatiently.

Annoyed and frustrated, I made my back home. But, little did I know, the trouble was not gonna end. As I went home and took out the parcel to have my dinner, the first look I had of the Kebabs, I knew they were gonna be devastating. The assortment of Kebabs were decent and it looked as if it was a steal in that price. However, all of the pieces were hard, chewy and not properly marinated.I have had Kebabs from many-a-places, including Take-away, but never was I served such horrible and despicable pieces in the name of Kebabs.

The side dish, which was supposed to be tasty, as I have mostly seen with the 'Rara' ones, also lacked flavor. It was a simple stirring of oil with incomplete spices. It is what you get when you forget to add Garam Masala to your final mix. The gravy was filled up with chunks of Keema, even though the description in the Menu didn't speak anything about the same. Disappointed, I tried to finish off the Roti with whatever gravy, I could just to feed myself up for the dinner and not sleep with an empty stomach!

Recommended? Nope! Unless, it is for dine-in, where you can revert back to these guys on account of any horrible food being served!

A good fine dining restaurant. Always remember to book ur table before visiting. The quality of food is excellent. Though the service needs to be better. The ambience and lighting is soothing. We ordered pan fried chilly fish and chicken kebab for starters. Main course were Chinese chopsuey, tandoori roti and chicken bharta. All the items were finger licking good. Wanted to try their nolen gur ice-cream but may be next time. Thumbs up for this restaurant.

This has been one my most visited places before I left Kolkata two years ago. My recent visit to Tandoor Park surprised me. They have revamped the entire place to cope up with the increasing popularity of theme based restros. I found some of the friendly faces there who greeted ua cordially.
Coming to their food, they make brilliant North Indian and Mughlai delicacies. Biriyani still tastes awesome and the Bhetki fish tikka masala was amazing. Prawn Chicken starters were awesome, as well.
Service is top class and this place has never compromised on their service delivery.
They keep a good collection of liquors including a few single malts too. The only drawback of this place is they do not allow entering the place after 10:30 pm and the entire place closes by 11:15 pm.
Would love to visit this place again.

The taste remains preserved in your tongue for a long time.I can assure that your evening will not be wasted away.The interior decorum with dim lights creates quite a cozy feeling.The staff is well acquainted with the different items displayed on the menu.So try to bag all the information about dishes if you love cooking.Though spicy, the food will excite up the taste buds.Especially, the kababs are cooked very well. The food fits to your appetite.So be prepared for a pleasant time while heading towards Tandoor Park.

So we went there on a friday afternoon after catching a movie at south city. The interiors were pretty decent with nice comfortable seats. We had a couple of beers, tandoori chicken, tandoori roti and chicken kali mirch. The food was good but the service was pretty bad. We were served the tandoori chicken almost 30 mins after we had been served the beer and by that time we were crying in hunger. So, except the service part i found it a pretty decent place. The pocket pinch was also not too high.

Beautiful ambience. Warm. Effusive. Very polite and helpful staff. Appetizers came at the right time while the drinks came in just in between the appetizers.

Crispy Chicken: Beautiful chunks of crisply fried chicken with a lemongrass fragrance. Loved it. The veggies along with it was also beautifully done. Not the typical fried chicken served in almost all places.
Fried Baby Corn: This was another beauty. Long, slender slices of batter fried baby corn. Enough for three people. This too was very unlike what is served elsewhere.

Drinks ordered were Sex on the Beach, Spiced Caprioska, My Pink Lady. They went well with the chosen appetizers, although I found the Caprioska a bit too stringent.

Visit this place for a homely, warm ambience and great food.

Good Food.Great Variety. However I would suggest them to reduce the oil quantity in their food.Lot of people say more oil results to greater taste , but I strongly disapprove. Overall, their food is great and very tasty but if they cut down on the oil, They will probably be the best in the locality!

We went to this restaurant on 17/02/2016. The moment we reached we got a table and as I was trying to fix my infant's chair I was asked if I would want Mineralar water or regular which was a bit irritating. After that we ordered Biryani which was good. Mutton Rogan Josh was not up to the mark. Drums of heaven did taste very good. ¬†the fish fingers were really very good. service is good could be better.

Went to this place on the occasion of this saraswati Puja with friends, It was a small line in the restaurant & I thought it was worth waiting. We ordered biriyani & I'm very happy that we didn't ordered anything else. Biriyani was quite OK & the price was reasonable. But the place is just similar like any other restaurant in kolkata, food is good, ambience is little attractive. That's all what I can say about this place.

Have been visiting this place for nearly 10 years now....it is very close to my place and has always maintained a certain standard which I find pretty amazing. The food here has always been excellent. Actually they are one of the first to introduce Shawarma to this city before it really caught on. The Mutton Biryani is excellent, so also the Chicken Lat Me Kai. Bharwan Tangri is another item which you should not miss. Be it Chinese or Tandoor items, the taste is right up there with the best.
Ambience is up to the mark.
As for service, I would say there is scope for improvement as few amongst the staff are extremely courteous whereas the remaining are careless /casual to say the least.
They have also renovated the place and given it a very modern look. (Also the size of the smoking area has been increased for smokers so that they may comfortably smoke).
I would suggest this place to anyone visiting, or in and around Jodhpur Park.

First of all it's better to take a cab to reach there, otherwise you have bus or auto.  I went there yesterday for dinner with my parents to celebrate my Maa's Birthday.  
About the ambience it's good for family and friends both.  It has full bar in one side.  We had only food and soft drinks.  One thing very bad is waiting time.  You have to wait for food and then for bill you have to wait again.  About the food we ordered Fried Rice,  Chicken Biriyani,  Hunan Chicken and Masala kulcha.  The food was realy good specialy the hunan chicken and the biriyani.  The quantity is adequate with respect to the price.  Overall nice place to visit.  
And for returning home we need to book Ola,  otherwise it was tough to return.  

Thanks!

It was for lunch that me and my friend, who by the way is a regular here, had gone to Tandoor park. Although it has been quite a few months since the visit, I still remember the utterly delectable keema naan and chicken lababdar that we had had that day with a sweet-lime soda to wash it all down. The ambience is soothing and the service is efficient. The best part, other than the food of course, is that it is easy on the pocket which is a huge plus for us students who still live off pocket-money. I will certainly be going back for more.

A popular bar cum restaurant of south Kolkata serving mouth watering tandoori items. That's how "Tandoor Park" can be explained in one sentence. The price of liquor is quite reasonable here and the food is genuinely delicious in taste and quality wise absolutely fine. The ambience is peaceful with a gentle vibe of a lively charm. And the interior decor is also pretty nice. Specially the bar counter is something that is sure to draw your attention for its innovative presentation.
But the only thing I disliked about the place is that, the service staffs are a bit impatient about listening to the guests properly.
But overall, a very good, authentic, peaceful, descent place to lunch/dine in and treat your taste buds with some mouth watering tandoori delights, and that's too over a few drinks.

I was at my band's rehearsal and after we packed up, suddenly we planned to have some beer. So searching the nearby places, we coincided for this place. Located near to a 5 mins walking distance from dhakuria station, Tandoor park is really a nice place. From interior decoration to the quality of food - they truly have submerged them with flying colors. We had chilli lamb, lasooni tikka kebab, chilli fish, and pahaari kebab. Each and every item is worth a mention. The venue is very well maintained, very neat and clean. They have a separate smoking zone with a outside view. Rate of alcohol is ok..I mean a tuborg they charge is of 180+tax which is legitimate enough. A nice place for foodies, couples, buddies.
I dropped in over here again and this time I ordered for the Reshmi kebab....honestly, it was not that good.....

The chicken was juicy and soft. It went good with the liquor we ordered. Just that place is not that much pocket friendly to go there regularly. Occasional visits are affordable (if you are to go for the liquor)

Located very close to my house, I have been here, as well as ordered for home delivery innumerable number of times and every time they don't fail to impress me. They have come up with a new look couple of months back and the interiors look really awesome now.
Its spread over 3 floors, and whether u visit on weekdays or weekends, daytime or in the evening you would find it full of people.
Coming to the food, each and every item on their menu is great. You can order chinese or Indian and you won't be dissapointed with the food. I would recommend to order any of their fish preparations as they are the best. They have quite a well stocked bar also. The prices are not really high compared to the quality they serve.
Highly recommended..

I have passed by this restaurant a zillion number of times since it is situated very close to my school, although, i never felt like checking out this place, until recently, owing to my Mom.

Ambience is good.

Service is not disappointing.

We were a group of 4 people.

Ordered: Soft Drinks, Plain Naan and Butter Naan, Assorted Kebab Platter and Chicken Lababdar Masala.


All the items were nicely made.

Quantity is also satisfactory.

Total bill came to (only) 999/- for the 4 of us, although they initially billed us wrongly for 2 additional items we hadn't ordered in the first place.

Looking forward to savouring their Chinese delicacies the next time i visit here :)

The place has always been a choice whenever I'm on a tight expenditure schedule for the month. Alcohol was cheap as compared to other places serving the same brand. We ordered for panner tikka as starter with Black dog Reserve and Mojito. The tikka was well cooked, appropriately spicy and literally melted in the mouth. Mojito was well prepared with the perfect quantity of rum. 
Main course we ordered for biriyani and reshmi kebab. Both were brilliantly prepared. The biriyani had enough quantity to fill up two people to the brim. The kebab was well prepared.
Overall a pretty good experience. Would love to keep this place as an option if you have to grab a quick bite with some good alcohol with a tight pocket.

Be it food or drinks ,family or friends Tandoor park never disappoints.

Been there a couple of times. One of my favorite in Kolkata. A wide variety of food with good quality is available here. Bar is on the 2nd floor. Went there on sosthi afternoon. Waiting for half an hour we got chance to enter there. During puja all the food items were not available. Still food quality is awesome. Service is good.

I went to this joint quite a few tyms and was never disappointed. The ambience is great with soothing dim lights. A best combo here to enjoy is to order their fish n chips dish along with a glass of premium whiskey. :)
It is a bit pricey though but that's ok as there is no other bar cum restaurant in this area.

Recommended by a friend, we visited this restaurant late in the evening. They have a nice, sophisticated ambience. North Indian food is always a delight to have especially after a few pegs. Their kebabs and sidedishes are pretty good but not the biriyani. Although I loved this place, I am not coming back here for what I call 'unprofessional' behaviour by the staffs. Disappointed.

Good food and decent ambiance for family .Ordered 1 garlic fish and¬† 2 mixed hakka chow for 2 of us. 
Quantity was perfect for one individual .Fish was good and juicy from inside basically most of the restaurant does not cook good quality fish items and I got dinner there in puja time so their quality did not drop that time as well . 

In future I would love to go there again .

Since this place is quite near my home, we often go there for drinks and dinner. The last time we went there was in September along with my brother and his wife.¬†

We ordered Reshmi kababs and Fish finger with drinks. Both were lip smacking good. The kabab was soft and tender and you can get a creamy texture in the taste. It simply melted in the mouth. As for the fish fingers, the fish was fresh and flaky. The breading was light and crunchy. And it tasted heavenly with tartar sauce. And both of these starters went superbly with the whisky we ordered.

After that, we got Chicken Bharta and Tandoori Rotis for dinner. The rotis were hot and soft. And the chicken bharta was creamy to taste and plentiful in quantity.

The ambience was soothing, with soft light and music in low tone. And the service was quite prompt.

The price was slightly on the higher side, but the dining experience was very good.

This restaurant is located just opposite the lane of Jodhpur Park Post Office or Jodhpur Girls' school.
They have two separate counters one for the dine in and another is the rolls corner.
Although i would have liked to visit their restro but due to the lack of time i finally decided to just have rolls.
Now coming to their quality of rolls i must say they were really very nice. The paratha was soft and crunchy and most importantly less oily.
The egg coat on the paratha made it more juicy too.
Now coming to their chicken filling all the chicken pieces were very soft and it had a nice taste too. And the rolls were heavy enough to have.
What surprised me the most is that their quality of rolls didn't drop even though it is puja time.
Hence a 4* to it.
In future i will definitely visit their dine in corner to have heavy meal...

Went there with high expectations! My friends and relatives really like this place and hence,on their recommendation, visited this eatery on Saptami afternoon! It goes without saying,there was a huge crowd and we had to wait for almost an hour. When our turn came,we were asked to enter through some back door and were instructed to go to 2nd floor. We were surprised after reaching there because the place looked entirely different from what I saw in the pictures. I'm still not clear whether that was the restaurant for which we waited for almost an hour or that was the bar. Nonetheless,since we were tired we didn't ask anything. The menu which we were provided consisted of only a single page,with not much variety of items at all. This menu was also different from what O saw on Zomato. We ordered chicken drumsticks,peas pulao,chickten reshmi butter masala and fresh lime soda. Chicken drumsticks didn't taste like chicken drumsticks at all. We were disappointed by the chicken reshmi butter masala too. I had such high expectations.

This is a wonderful place to be.  We went here on Panchami. They have reduced the number of available items during the Puja as usual. But the quality and quantity of food is still top notch. We had mixed fried rice, chicken reshmi butter masala along with our beer. The rice was moist and perfectly cooked. The chicken was also good.. Just the way it should be. We also had ice cream. I really like the way they serve the ice creams. Overall its a really good place for family dinning or to hang out with friends or your partner.

This place is located very close to dakshinapan , and a few meters away from dhakuria bridge . The restaurant has both ground floor and second floor seats , and some of the seats on the second floor overlook the road below . The interiors are nicely lit and the staff are courteous , though they might sometimes take too long to serve the food . The chicken kebab tasted good , and comes with fried onion salad , and a white sauce. The chicken reshmi masala is made with a white colored curry , and tastes bland , while the murgh tikka masala tastes sour , and has a red coloured gravy that resembles a tomato soup. The butter naan is thin and satisfactory. This place is not so great for its food as it is for grabbing a drink or two with friends . The bar is centrally located on the second floor. The place is popular among the young crowd . Overall , its a nice option if you want to dig into some north Indian after shopping or hanging at dakshinapan.

It also serves chinese items and hard drinks.
Chinese dishes are available but as its name suggests north indian is their speciality.
So go there amd get mushed with biriyani.

Groups of ppl coming aftr us were given tables and they couldn't offer a table for two to us. No definite time of waiting given by the security. Manager doesn't even come down to see guests and attend to the problems. In a city like Kolkata whr there are food joints serving good healthy food at every two steps having this kind of sense will really do no good to this joint. Really upset.

I went to this restaurant to take away food. The paneer butter masala was too mild, may be its a bengali version of north indian food. Navratan korma was good. We also took a mix of rotis. Naan and butter naan tasted the same, but it was ok. Lachchha paratha was good. But tandoori roti was too hard. I have tandoori rotis delivered in Delhi too and i have never found it so hard.

Tandoor Park or populary known as TP amongst the locals,is a joint which caters to a wide variety of people starting from college goers,office crowd who prefer to leave aside shits gathered before they snore & families or group of friends who like to spend some quality time.Not suprisingly on a day when life had come to a standstill in Kolkata & parts of India due to some democratic intervention, i along with fellow foodie Souvik Svk Ghosh dropped in to care for a beer or two.We are frequent here & were accustomed to the fact that the place runs to packed houses even on weekdays but since there was a strike on that day we expected it to be less occupied.Alas we were wrong again and with rennovation going on there was space crunch.Finally the manager who knew us as regular guest stepped in and arranged us on a table just adjacent to the bar away from the hustle bustles.
The guy being a cocktail expert asked us to go for few and we ordered Long Island Iced Tea and Barman's special (mint based being the preference given by me).The taste was excellent with all the ingredients being in proportion and a glass each made us high to a decent level to enjoy the evening.Tandoori Bhetki accompanied the drinks and was superb in terms of taste and quantity.The whole fish was stufffed with fillings and then put to tandoor with apt spices.Main course items included peas pulao,special fish in chinese style and malai kofta.The kofta deserves a special mention as it was stuffed with resins & cashews.The special fish is an out of the menu item & has tender juicy fillets of bhetki along with bell paper.
P.S. : Few items to die for are Fish finger,Fish chips and fry,Golden fried baby corn,Pepper fish,Murgh kurchan,Chicken/Fish lababdar,Fish in oyester sauce,Prawn masala & Masala kulcha....üò•üò§
With the new emerging trend of experimental foodies & forums like zomato advocating it new eateries will come up but veterans like our very own TP will reign supreme in our hearts.üòâ‚ò∫üòäüòÄ

I've been eating from this place since the last 3years .Now I need to put in my take in print. It's like a good old neighbour for me and never makes me unhappy. The Chinese as well North Indian food is enjoyable. The kebab platter is a super deal for 300 bucks with 13 pieces of delight. A special mention of the Bhetki Tikka Kebab. It's a succulent piece of fish , spiced and charcoal grilled truly marvellous. Lat me kai is another radiantly spiced dish in its genre leaving u wanting for more. I will also like to Bold the quality of prawns used . SUPER big n fresh ones with great seasoning. The Masala kulcha is beautifully crafted , soft , dough is fresh. The winner here is the Murg Mussalam for 375 or so ,its a steal. They freshly prepare it for u. Amazing combination with the Kulcha. Highly recommended for the neighbourhood foodies , if you like an All in One place ,try this blindly. I'm yet to taste their sizzler which looked very appetizing in a sneak peek üòúüòú. Cheers!

The restaurant has a nice ambience and the dishes are well priced. The service is fast and the staff are quite friendly. The crowd is usually a good mix of family and friends.

As the restaurant is situated close to my home, I usually order takeaways from here. I must say that the food at Tandoor Park is excellent. My personal favourite is the 'Kabuli Naan' and 'Murg Tikka Makhani' combo. I don't think I have ever had a better 'Kabuli Naan' in any other restaurant situated in Kolkata !

I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting South Kolkata. The restaurant has a varied selection of Indian and Chinese cuisine at affordable prices !

I went there once and had schezwan noodles and chicken tandoori full and I must say its surprisingly good. Ambience is not much to look at.

I've been going to tandoor park for the last 10 years. Frequency being less in recent times. There were not much options before in south kolkata unlike today and TP used to rock in those days. 
I visited them recently and decided to finally write a review. It's located on jodhpur park and has been an institution for good tandoori food . The interiors are warm and welcoming. The restaurant has diff floors for stags, families and banquets. The prices are pretty reasonable and the service very friendly and prompt. The food has always been there strength. Definitely try the kebabs specially bara kebab and chix lollipops. I've been a veteran there and the staff knows me personally. But it never bored me. Every time I go I still crave for the succulent kebabs with my lager. Hope u guys have a good time too.

I visited this joint a week back. The food was good but the ambiencewas too stuffy. We ordered Dhingri Kebab, Naan,Dal Makhani, Mutton Roganjosh. Food was really good specially Dhingri Kebab. But let down was its service and the ambience. Service was too slow, we literally had to wait over 30 minutes for the appetizers and as I mentioned it before the ambience was too stuffy. All in all a decent place if you are just going to have good food minus the ambience.

Located right in Dhakuria main road,Tandoor House is one of the most popular restaurants of the locality owing partly the quality it serves up and also due to the lack of a decent place nearby. Last week,after quite a few years, I had visited this place with a bunch of friends and ended up having a good time.

This place offers mainly North Indian and Chinese food along with drinks. As is quite evident from the nomenclature,the north Indian tandoor items are the more popular ones. They are in general always pretty good and something you can trust. I have in general stuck to the tandoor preparations here and have never been disappointed. This time around,I tried the fish finger and the crispy konjee lamb.They were just about decent and I would much rather recommend the tandoor items.

The bar is undoubtedly one of the major attractions of this place. It is well stocked and very reasonably priced. The cocktails are nice and strong too. A special mention for their long island iced tea which is one of the stronger versions I have had anywhere.

The ambiance is nice and decent and somewhere in between a bar and a family restaurant. The ground floor section is for stags while the section upstairs is the family dining section. The service can be a bit slow and frustrating at times but given the fact that this place is crowded at most times,it is pretty understandable. They also have a waiting section for its pretty hard to get a table straight away especially in the early evenings.

All in all,Tandoor park is one of those value for money places which has something in it for everyone. Whilst it might not be anything truly extra ordinary it is sure to offer you something of your liking.

A cosy affordable and quite friendly staff greets you the moments you enter this eatery. Food is up to the mark, nothing extravagantly delicious, but the romantic ambience is good enough to spend time here with a few drinks and starters.

Pretty decent food and ambience. The Murgh Masallam is awesome and so are their Roti's. The Kulcha was soft and delicious and the Butter Naan had a pretty decent quantity of butter which kept it soft and moist. 

The Tandoori Chicken wasn't a good experience though as the meat had traces of blood towards the bone and that was a major let down for us. By the way, we had tried the Tandoori Chicken on a previous occasion and hence not marking them down in this review.

Current experience has been a pretty decent and satisfying one.

Located at an aloof area in kalighat with decent ambience and quite an average service, Tandoor Park serves cheaper version of dishes exclusive at places like BarBQ and Peter Cat. From sizzlers to Chelo kebab platter, you can grab a bite without burning a hole in your pocket.

Visited there only recently. The decor and ambience was ok. We ordered some cocktails and then went for the Tandoori dishes because duh, it's Tandoor Park! We ordered some starters and then for the main course we had Chicken Bharta and Bhuna Gosht. Food tasted ok, bordering on good. We didn't try the Chinese stuff, so no idea about that. Behaviour of staff was friendly and cooperative. Overall, there is a scope of improvement on the food quality but otherwise it's a good place to hang out with friends and family.

Tandoor Park is really popular in this part of Kolkata, owing to a scarcity of other comparable bar-cum-restaurants anywhere in the vicinity. It offers a tempting combination of decently priced alcohol with a multi-cuisine menu and a pretty good ambiance. So it's not surprising to see it always crowded, and having wait times at all hours (thankfully, they have a waiting area though!). The most popular items here are the tandoor items (obviously!), especially the starters (kebabs). They also do a good job with the North Indian main course items and Chinese starters. My personal favorite here happens to be the Fish and Chips: a hearty and tasty meal by itself. The cocktails are pretty well done too. Service can be a bit slow and frustrating at times, but with the ever-buzzing atmosphere and satisfying range of food and drinks... it's always been a good place to go to!

Visited this place on a sudden tandoori craving the other day. Situated near Jodhpur Park, it is quite easy to find. The ambiance is pretty nice.¬†
We started off with a Tandoori chicken, which was good. As they all are. Always.
There were not too many beer varieties on offer though, considering it has a bar and all.¬†
For main course, we had the special chicken biryani, chicken bharta and tandoori roti. The biryani quantity was ample, quality-wise decent enough. Especially if you are as hungry as we were then!
The chicken bharta was quite good. Something I'd recommend from here.¬†
The service we received was quite poor. Most of our time was spent in waiting. That is something they should look at improving- the manpower at hand.¬†
Prices don't burn a hole in your pocket, they are not too low either. You get my point. Would I recommend? If you have to, you can. If you can, you don't really have to.¬†
I'll come back for some more of the chicken bharta though!

Be there more than 8-9 times with colleagues for the party. This is situated just opposite Jodhpur Park Post Office. The bar good and so is the food. The Mughlai cuisine here is good. I usually do not prefer the Chinese food here. Pricing is a bit high and you might have to wait for sometime to get a place to sit if you are visiting during peak hours. They had placed for waiting inside where you can get seated. It has common interior decor, good ambiance, but waiter service is very bad experience. Today we 10 people were there for lunch. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab, American Corn with hot Garlic Sauce, Chicken Lababdar, Mutton Rara Masala, Masala Kulcha, Sahi Pulav and Sweet Lime Soda.The service was very slow and the manpower was not enough. Most of the time we were just waiting for food, the glass also empties for a long time. The overall experience is good except service. 

Food: 3.5/5

Pricing: 3/5

Service: 1/5

Ambiance: 3.5/5

The ambience of the restaurant is really very good. I went there with five of my friends and we had to wait for 20 minutes just to get a table for six.

As a person who doesn't indulge in drinking, I have to say that this restaurant wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The food is above average, I expected better.

For starters, we ordered Crispy Fried Baby Corn and Drums of Heaven. The Drums of Heaven was satisfactory but the Baby Corn tasted bland. For the main course, we ordered Chicken Biriyani, which was pretty bad (in my opinion, any restaurant which puts onions in Biriyani is bad. Actual Biriyani does not have onion in it. Onions are served as salad along with the Biriyani.) and Tikka Kebab, which was good but I have had better. The plain naan was good and Murg Musallam was just okay. Two of my vegetarian friends ordered Chili Garlic Fried Rice and Veg Manchurian, which, according to them were good.

They took a lot of time to serve us even though we went there during lunch time. We had to wait for almost 40 minutes for our main dishes and 30 minutes for the starters. I found this very titillating.

I would prefer not to go back to this place. The ambience is the only thing about this restaurant that I really liked.

Mostly I place order online for home delivery.
They deliver within 20 mins and still hot to serve in KPC, 8B, Jadabpur. Trust me this restaurant is one of the best restaurant in south Kolkata. They serve excellent North Indian and Mughlai dishes I have ever had. There Chicken starters are best, especially "Lazeez Tagree Kabab". In main course, Mutton dishes are just awesome especially "Mutton Roghanjosh". Also I must say about there "Boondi Raita" its just unexplainable, its just like ice cream. Though there prices are much high once you add the taxes and VAT.

Few days back I went to this restaurant with my mom. Actually it was my mom's idea to check this place out cause I had never really noticed this restaurant before. I am so glad I listenened to her and checked out this restaurant. The ambiance is peaceful, dimmed light and there is proper distance between each tables. Nothing over the top yet pretty nicr and decent. The staff is well behaved. We had manchow soup, mixed frird rice and chilli chicken. The quantity was ample for two people. Though I found the soup was pretty less as per the price. But the fried rice and chilli chicken were delicious and the quantity was also perfect. There is also a bar but i have no clue about it. Overall it's a nice and cozy restaurant and can be visited with family, friends and loved ones. Will definitely visit it again to try other delicacies.

Where to start! This restaurant is doing a great job. I used to visit there very often. It's worth visit. Never disappointed me. Has common interior decor, good ambiance, a bit crowded but never had to wait outside. They had passage for waiting inside where you can get seated. This restaurant used to save me when I was terribly hungry.
Tasted a lot of items like prawn malaicurry, mutton biryani, butter nun, paneer butter masala, chicken bharta, fried rice with schezwan lamb, shredded lamb with green pepper, hundi mutton and a few remained i cannot exactly remember. Must taste their kebabs, and mutton items. I loved the lamb too. A bit spicy which I liked the most.
Always been a good spending of time and money. Drinks are reasonable. And the quantity can politely please two or more people if you order 1plate of anything.
Wish to visit again. Anytime.

Had one of the tasty manchow soup. It was hot and perfectly spicy. Lamb was soft and cooked perfectly with pinch of extra spice as we customised it and the chicken was soo tasty with the perfect crunch with it. Ambience wise good and service was fast too. It's pocket friendly and for 3 , it was 625. Anyway it was a treat by a friend

Had really high expectations  from this place considering its prime location. However, it turned out to be a disastrous experience and this place definitely ranks among the worst places i have ever been to. The ambiance is pathetic..the place has got this dull, gloomy feel to it and it is unusually dark inside the restaurant...the food quality is horrible..suffered from indigestion for a day or two after having lunch at this place. The food was barely edible..the only saving grace was the Chicken Schzewan in the starters which was good enough and all the remaining items were pathetic...a big let down with an oath to never vist it again!

this was the second time in a month here. I am liking this place. But this time we had to wait for about 15 minutes. this time we took 2 beers, smirnoff with lime cordial along with assorted kebab platter, and sizzlers and chicken taipei. In assorted kebab platter some of the items are good and some of them i didnt like The sizzler is good. ¬†And the taipei chicken was chrunchy and tasted great with beer. They told they dont have 3 sizzlers They have 2. Its ok but it is a big reatuarant. It should have backups. Other than that dinner was good. Total was 1891/-. Price here is moderate.

After a hectic week yesterday evening was the time to relax. We 4 friends decided to go to tandoor park... There were different sections for different people. For family different section wat there. We went to the second floor. Ambience wat good. The place is neat and clean.
Total we ordered beers with pahari kebab and also later on we added 3 chicken sizzlers and 2 mutton biryani.It was great spending time there. Coming to food pahari kebab was no doubt good and the sizzlers were super. I love sizzlers. Mutton biryani was good. The waiters were also good.
Great spending time there.. Will go again. Pocket pinch was 2588/-.

Tandoor Park. Probably the most underrated restaurant in South Kolkata. Located on ur left midway if u go towards jadavpur police station from dhakuria..this is quite a place to be wid ur friends nd families. Dont b fooled by its outlook..when u step in..there's enough space and comfortable arrangements topping it all with a sound service. Coming onto its main aspect..I thought the food was excellent.  We had fish n chips wid tartar sauce, crispy konjee chicken. .mutton biriyani..nd chicken lababdar...nd as I said..they were all pretty good..the fish wasnt overfried nd the chicken pieces were tender nd perfectly cooked..the biriyani had the authentic aroma to it which I loved... the pricing however u cannot term it as very cheap but its pretty moderate..so the next time you are in this neighbourhood nd u want "good food with good pricing"..hop in nd give this a shot..I m sure u'll like it.

Went there for lunch on a thursday afternoon along with 11 friends.although it looks quite small from the outside the restaurant is decent in terms of space.12 of us were seated quite comfortably.as we were out with friends we were definitely on a budget but the items on the menu were decently priced.we ordered the tandoori chicken(full) tandoori roti ... Chicken tikka makhani and the chicken reshmi butter masala . The tandoori chicken was very well made .. The meat was tender and properly spiced. The side dishes along with the roti tasted nice as well the gravies of both the dishes were really nice and i specially liked the tikka makhani.the biggest plus was the bill which came to roughly 3800 which is more than good enuf for the decent food we had.so definitely coming back the next time we have get together with friends.

Went there for a lunch,situated just opposite of dakshinapan market. that is for sure tandoor park has its own essence of ambiance that is clean and tidy and a nice atmosphere to dine in. We ordered a chicken spl and a mutton biriyani along with chicken reshmi butter masala and a kabuli naan. The naan was the memorable part, it was so good though it was served very late but still worth the time for its taste. The biriyani was one of my best i had and the chicken dish was tasty too. A most suggested restaurant from me...

Tandoori park, conveniently located by the main road is easy to find and offers a deluxe feel once escorted to the first storey restro... However, to speak with complete honesty, the food comes at a cost that does not suit its quality or taste...well I say it in comparison with other restaurants that offer better tasting food in better quantities at a lesser cost and yes its customer service is quite lacking in warmth too... They Serve you with noticeable detachment.

First time I visited this place was around 7 years back. A very decent place for lunch or dinner. Their main attraction according to me is the bharwaan tengri kebabs and bhuna ghost. These two dishes are unparallel compared to any other restaurant in kolkata. Other dishes that I would prefer would be mutton biryani , chicken tandoori and masala kulcha. A big disadvantage of this place is that there is a huge parking problem at this place. Overall a decent family restaurant.

Kolkata was literally parched..the Celsius rising like guillotine literally trying to behead the morale of us teenagers. Today marks the arrival of monsoon...and what good is monsoon without a few drinks.Found this nice joint while scavenging around Jadavpur.
The decor: Very cosy and homely
The service: A little prompt service would be highly appreciated
The Food: Dont think while ordering..The cuisine is good.The sizzler was appetising and the veggie relish deserves a note of appreciation. The crispy baby corn was okay.The mixed fried rice and chowmein was also standard.The chilli chicken and Schezuwan chicken was ok but didn't titillate the taste buds quite right. 
The quantity? 
Starters can easily please 4 people..But the main course lacked in quantity.
To sum up..a very cosy and easily accessible place to take your friends out for a drink. 
P.S. : Did I mention that they serve GREAT mocktails?? :D

Tandoor park is located just opposite to jodhpur park post office,gariaht road.
Firstly,  their management isn't efficient enough that's the reason you'll always finding yourself waiting even on weekdays. 
They provide with 6seaters even when there are two people, henceforth, others have to keep waiting.
Coming to food, I've been to this restaurant umpteenth times as it is near my place. Food is really good and value for money.
Once, they provided us with  stale chicken and refused to change. That was quite a setback. 
They really need to work on how to manage  customers and be a bit more systematic .

I have often popped into the restaurant for a quick bite and drink with my cousin. My tryst with the food is limited as I have only had the Mixed Kebab Platter and a few Chinese dishes. They tasted quite good.

The organization is a little flustered during Durga Pujo as orders are served quite late (almost an hour!) May be due to the crowds pouring in from four top South Kolkata pandals. :D

Tandoori park is one of the many restaurants with a combination of north Indian, Moghlai and Chinese. There is nothing special about the restaurant. The location is convenient as it's right on the main road. It's a perfect place to drop by at pujo as the area has many pujo pandels. The ambience is comfortable and cozy with dim, familiar yellow lighting. The price and food are also average. 
The quality of food is good. The biryani the special mutton mutton is served with rice, 2 pieces of tender mutton and an egg. The biryani isn't typically what is found at Arsalan, but it's satiating. A side dish I would highly recommend is Chicken Lababdar. It comes with a rich, not-to-spicy gravy. 
It's a perfect place to drop by if you're bored of home cooked food and in need of some tandoor.
They also sell rolls at a counter outside the restaurant for a quick bite.

I have visited Tandoor Park many times. Food quality is very good chinese as well as North Indian. Tandoor park has a reasonable price rate. Best thing is, this is a bar cum restaurant, so u can enjoy a drinks as well. Staffs are very good and friendly in nature. Location of the restaurant is also very good. This restaurent has 2 different sections for Family and others. This is a nice place to go. And I love to go again and again.

Had dinner with a friend 4/5 years back. Never attempted to dine here before thinking it may be an overpriced place. Nice ambience, serves liquor. I still don't whether it's overpriced or not. The friend paid the bill. The taste of the food is good, quantity-wise also it is enough.

Located near selimpur,this restaurant is good for one time visit. The restaurant ¬†serves¬†North Indian and Chinese cuisine. They also serve a bit of Lebanese and Tibetian delights like Shawarma Rolls and Pan FriedMomo,which are equally good. Morever you get servings on wine to tingle your taste buds.Nice dark ambience prompt service. Price is reasonable ,so that won't be a reason to worry.

This is I think 6th or 7th time we went for dinner at Tandoor Park. A really awesome place for hangout with family or friends. They have some real mouth watering menus. Best place for North Indian dishes (Must try kebabs). Chinese menus are also very good. Oh yes... There bar is also cool. Staffs are extremely well mannered. You'll feel a nice homely atmosphere always. Love u Tandoor Park. I wish to come back here again and again.

To me,this is one of the most underrated restaurants of Kolkata. This place deserves to be among the top five multi cuisine restaurants of Kolkata,serving mouth watering North Indian and Authentic Chinese Cuisine. Any dish is worth trying here,from the North Indian and Chinese section. They also serve a bit of Lebanese and Tibetian delights like Shwarma Rolls and Momo,which are equally good. In short this place serves quality. Nice dark cosy chilled interiors,with very nice ambience and prompt service. I would love to go there again and again. Kudos to this place! :D

The food is decently good here... Comfortably priced... It's an air conditioned restaurant at dhakuria... The location rocks and the chicken curries are quite good. The kebabs are ok... Have the naan and the curries.
The alcohol is not that expensive...

If you are going from Jadavpur Thana towards Golpark, you will find this restaurant on the right hand side just before the Dhakuria flyover. It has been an old hub for South Calcuttans.¬†Me and my family were¬† there for a doctor's appointment for my mother and by the time we left the doctor's place, it was past 5pm. We were hungry as all of us had eaten lunch in a hurry. Tandoor park was the best option as it was located right next to the doctor's place.¬†

As we entered the restaurant, the guard politely directed us to a flight of steps leading to the first floor. The steep stairs twisted upto the upper floor which was dimly lit. The seating capacity is moderate. I would say the ambiance was average. I would have preferred it to be more brightly lit and more airy.

Since it was late in the evening, we decided to go for something which is easy and light. The restaurant has a wide variety of menu items. You have lots of choices. Here is what we ordered.
(1)Fish finger - Rs. 210/-
(2)Chicken Sizzler - Rs. 210/-
(3)Bhetki (Fish) Sizzler - Rs. 350/-
(4)Prawn Sizzler - Rs. 375/-
(5)Fish N Chips - Rs 210/-
(6)Cold Drinks - Rs. 60/-

The fish fingers were¬†excellent, both in terms of size and taste. The taste of Sizzlers was good. The Bhetki Sizzler had the entire¬†fish converted into Sizzler dish (with head and all). This is something I had not eaten earlier. The Fish N Chips was very good too.¬†
The staff is very polite and service is good, although I must admit that at that time in the evening there were only three customer including us. I am not sure how the service would be when it is full house. The price is pretty much high compared to the dishes that are being served.¬†
Overall, it is a nice restaurant to hang out to. The food is tasty and that is what matters the most.

This place does home delivery within a radius (except for Durga puja days). Indian food is good here. Tandoori chicken, vegetable pulao, bhuna gosht, are some of the items I like. Their Chinese food is good too. The chicken in lemon coriander sauce is particularly tasty. Staff are always courteous.

To begin with the location is excellent; very near to dhakuria and not too far from jadavpur thana! The waiting lobby is small but cozy and a table for six was easily made available within 5 mins. It was my first visit and I was blown away by the quality and taste of the reshmi kabab. The food overall was very good; the quantity served was very appropriate. The ambience is a bit of a letdown if u r alone but a company of friends changes that effectively. The seats were also pretty comfortable and well spaced out! Food was prompt and we were well waited upon. A good experience.  Special mention needs to be given to the gravy chowmein, lasuni murg tikka, gosht bhuna, chicken bharta and konji chicken!

Tandoor park is located right opposite Dakshinapan before the flyover starts. It has been an old hub for South Calcuttans.  Needless to say, the security guard, the manager accompanied by out staff members are really cordial in most cases. 

Once it happened so that we didn't get a table and they asked us to sit inside where there was dining arrangement made in the other room just like it is outside. We were carrying a DSLR and they objected saying "photography is prohibited". So, we finally couldn't get any pictures of that day though we were a gang of 5 together and had a lot of food.

I like going to this place. They have variety in food. The kebabs and Indian dishes are really good here.  The desserts here are remarkably good. The dimly lit interior  would make you feel even better at the end of the day. The place is slightly on the costlier side but for all Tandoori and kebab lovers.

Enjoy your meal. :)

Still need to stand at Que to get a place. So no doubt this place successfully holding themselves in this current market scenario.

Used to be a favourite hangout in 2013. The mixed kebab platter there used to work wonders with beer! Plus the offers on alcohol now and then kept us going. However the quality of food has steadily fallen in the past year. The waiting time is abnormally bad, sometimes unnecessary... The folks are little on the dumb side but warm and courteous.

I have ordered their foods from the fast food counter outside the main restaurant.but never got a chance to enter the restaurant. But i was already fan of their Mutton keema nun and all rolls. But tomorrow (14th March,15) after returning from a movie me & my girlfriend decided to visit there.
Our Order- 1) One full plate of Tandoori Murgh 2) 4 Butter nuns 3) 1 plate Chicken reshmi butter masala...4) One full plate Tandoori Murgh for home
What i loved- 1) The interior was good and well maintained 2) Their service and behavior is very warfull 3) the tandoori was pretty good in quality and taste.The chicken was well cooked. 4) The nuns-i have never tested a butter nun so good in past and i can come here just for this. You can;t escape the overwhelming smell of the nuns. 5) The reshmi butter masala was good too.
What i didn't love- 1) The nun quantity we ordered was too much for 2 persons. The person who took the order realized that (i noticed his hesitation when i ordered for 4 nuns). He should have warned me 2) We had to wait for long time with repeating request for our bill.
Ohh the prices are moderate,not cheap at all but not too expensive also.
At the end,I liked it and obviously i am gonna visit there in future.

The dark interior design is a perfect blend with such dishes.
But here's Chinese food is a drawback.

It's preferred to treat your taste buds with tandoor items, as it suggests.

This place is a disappointment. They will keep you waiting for hours to serve your order. When you're hungry and need to cater to the needs of your stomach, this place will make the situation worse.The food items¬†we ordered were good, although I believe we should have confined ourselves to North Indian rather than experimenting with just about decent Chinese. Thye served us Dry Chilli Chicken instead of the Drums of Heaven we ordered. Fortunately, that sort of tasted good. In the mains, we ordered lamb in oyster sauce accompanied with Thai noodles. The food might have tasted better if it wasn't for the sore appetites that the misery of waiting had inflicted upon us.As for the verdict, they really need to serve faster if they are to retain customer faith.

I and one of my close friends decided to meet after a long time and have lunch together. I wanted to visit this joint for quite a long time and didn't wanna miss it. It is near jodhpur park post office. It has two floors. We took a table for two upstairs. I loved the d√©cor with dimly light interior. The roof having colored light shades with designs on it is very attractive. It is a spacious area with a bar on one side. We ordered chicken pahari kebab, chicken lazeez tangree kebab as starter. The pahari kebab was one of the best and unique kebab that i have had ever. It tasted just awesome. Tangree kebab was also good and well prepared. Then we ordered mutton peshawari and butter naan and fresh lime soda in our main course. Mutton peshawari was again a prize winning dish for me. Naan was average. We orderd tutty fruity in our dessert. It looked beautiful with a red cherry and a chocolate drumstick on top of it. But i would say the variety of fruits in it was less and it was not expected since it is winter and lots of fresh fruits are available in the market. Apart from this, I am very happy with the food. Another negative point is,their service is very slow and they took a long time to serve every course. Price is reasonable. Overall experience is good and a must visit for all kebab lovers.

This place had long been in my wish list because of recommendations from many. Last Thursday, we finally decided to have lunch over there and we were not at all disappointed. Along with the introductory drink (I ordered a simple fresh lime soda and my friend ordered whiskey) we had tandoor murgh which was very tasty ( the chutney accompanying the chicken was equally tasty). Then we decided to have mixed noodles and Hunan chicken. The quantity was enough for two people and the taste, well it was beyond awesome. We had a lovely luncheon and a wonderful experience. :)

Well this was the place where we used to go often during our early office days.
Being a resident of south kolkata, 2 places we have gone often--mirch masala(beside Gariahat pantaloons) and tandoor park on weekends.
Best thing about this place, you have a smoking zone inside which may be suffocating when many smokers enter the place, still its godd as you dont need to come down for a puff.
Ambiance is good and staffs are polite, I like their sitting arrangements also.
Coming to food and drinks--price reasonable and taste is also good.
You can have prawn chips there with drink which is tasty.
Kababs and starters are all tasty.
But ye nothing much to experiment here in this place--u would not find a new item to try out here.

OK, I visited this place during the pujas. Busy days no doubt in Kolkata. Dunno if for that reason or not, found it to be quite dirty. I mean, with cockroach crawling over the table and all, that dirty. I was very take aback, more so coz have heard of its reputation. 
Was dreading what will land up in the plate in front of me. However, the waiters were really courteous n when asked to wipe the table one more coz of the crawlies, they did so without another word. 
Then came the food and I was left with no complaints. We had ordered tandoori chicken n it was served fast n hot. N it tasted delicious. The salad on the side n the green curd chutney was amazing too. The chicken pieces were succulent n tender n juicy. And the right amount of charred. Then we had biriyani and chicken tikka n butter masala. Both were equally good and certainly worth trying again. I would really like to try go back and try out the other dishes.

Very reliable, very dependable dining place, bang opposite the main jodhpur park alley from raja s c mullick road. Have been there so many times - always found the food quality same.
Fish finger, dry chilli chicken, pan fried chowmein, mixed fried rice, schezwan chicken, fish in black bean sauce remains my favourite.drinks are reasonably priced with helpful waiters.
No wonder there's always a que after 7 pm, everyday.
P.S - there is another entrance from the side alley besides narendra seva trust. It takes you to the 2nd floor, only for stags.

Tandoor Park really stands out for its superb ambience. The food tastes equally good and the quantity is surely satisfying. The masala kulcha is just splendid.

This is my favourite place to crash with friends as it is pretty near to where I stay. The place has a family section below and a drinker's section up top. The food here is very good and also not too expensive. There is a large variety of domestic beer available along with a few international ones. The service is very good here and if you are a regular, you will always be greeted by the staff. I like Tandoor park with my friends as i can drink and have some good food on a friday night. I would suggest this place more for friends' hangout rather than family get together.

Good food, good service, clean. Well..... price is a bit on higher side but its ok. I liked tandoor pomfret and sworma salad, shredded chicken with vegetables (white souse) and yes, kabab platters are too good. Large TV screen in 2nd floor with discovery..animal planet and sports channel is an extra treat. Disappointment - Murg Musallam.

Tandoor Park is not that good in comparison with other multi cuisine restaurants of South Kolkata. The service was alright but the ambience and quality were not upto the mark of quality restaurants.

We heard a few good reviews from friends and also saw good reviews on Zomato so thought of visiting this place on Astami afternoon. The place is a bit confusing to locate. The place has two entrances. The signboard on the main road is just their reception and once you get the seats (if there is a rush)you are taken to the back entrance and are taken to the second floor via an old elevator. The restaurant is a large flat modernized into a bar cum restaurant. there are many seats so chances are yiu will get seats fast even on special days. There are family as well as couple seats . We were taken to our seats and were provided with the menu by the staff quite courteously.

The menu was quite extensive but we ordered simple butter naan and chicken butter masala to go with it. Our order arrived within 15 minutes . The naan was perfectly made with a blob of butter on each of the naan breads. The chicken butter masala was also garnished with additional butter on top. The quantity was good and the taste was delicious. I have had the same dish at many places but this one one of the best versions of it . Would really recommend it to others. The 2 naans and the butter chicken dish cost us around 450 bucks. Prices are a little steep but the taste really made up for it .

Been there a long time ago. We were welcomed with warm gestures from the moment we entered the restro. The winding staircase adds to the fun. N the yellow lighting makes an ideal place for fine dining for both couples as well as families.

Once we entered the manager seated us at a very cozy corner. The staffs were very well behaved n answered our queries promptly n efficiently. As for the location u will never miss this restro if u pass through the road connecting gariahat n jadavpur.

Now coming to food items we had ordered vodka(fuel) n Chicken malai kebab. The kebabas were very very succulent n tasty. Then we ordered butter naan along with Chicken lababdar(which the waitor claimed to b a Tandoor park specialty). N surely it did not fail to dissapoint us. 

A very satisfying experience. Would love to visit again n again n again...:-)

Update:
Post renovation, the place looks fabulous. What they have lost what they possessed  earlier for years ... good service!

Food quality has worsened, portions have reduced.

The worst is the manager and the attendants. They have literally made me vow to myself never to return.

Old Review:
I have been there more than 30-40 times for food and booze, and have my favourites that I stick to, here is the list (the starred ones are must have).

Starters:
Fried Fish n Chips* (My most favourite thing to have there)
Fried Chilly Mushroom*
Crispy Fish Dry Chilli*
Crispy Fried Baby Corn
Chicken Drums of Heaven*
Crispy Lamb*

Main Course:
Reshmi Butter Masala*
Palak Chicken
Chicken Bharta*
Mutton Kurchan*
Mutton Peshawari*

Roti/Rice:
Butter Naan
Kabuli Naan
Tandoori Laachha Parattha
Biryani (Generic but good)

The also make decent Tandoori Murg (I doubt many can go wrong with it). And for dessert I used to like having their tutti frutti.

Sometimes some places are more than just a restaurant and this is one of many where I started coming with a bunch of monkeys from past 5years. It held memories of all the big and small stories of my group, the first place where I started to booze publicly. So its ritual for me to visit tandoor park with my old friends to booze and chitchat.
Coming to the food part, I like the starters here though mostly we had tandoori chicken and mixed kebab platters. Apart from that, I like roti and resmi chicken masala here. As in food doesnt matter much here, I have never concentrated much on its taste. But surely many people like me have their stories woven within this 4 walls and many more to be. :)

Visited this small yet cozy food juncture with friends after a rain filled Dashami. Never heard of this restuarant before I was quite awestruck by its interior decor & of course of its menu.. :p Recommended by a friend of mine I wasn't disappointed by their spread of Chinese delicacies. Tried their Singaporian Mixed Hakka Noddles with Schewan Chicken. It was quite good!! Also tucked away their Mutton Biryani which was a bit disappointing though. Mutton kosha & butter nan was pure bliss!!! they also a wide range of assorted dessert sections. The only drawback is the quantity of food which is served (a bit too costly for the steep price) & their Mughlai dishes are a disappointment. Otherwise this is quite a good eatery with quality food & Service!!

Seriously one of the over hyped places. Food is generally bad, lucky decent. Visited the place at least two to three times in the last couple of months including the puja days. But everytime there was some problem or other. At times the shrimps were smelly, at times  chicken was smelly (just awful taste but yet they didn't change) saying that the chef said that this was fine and at times these people would take orders for hard drinks without informing that the specific glasses were not available (me and my friends were served beer in normal drinking glasses). The services are just awfull except that of the Security. Every thing about the place was so bad.

This used to be five mins walk from my home. So from the day it opened till I was there, Tandoor Park has satisfied my sudden urges for Kebabs, and they are really good at it. When it opened, many years ago, Dhakuria was not so decked up like today. So naturally it became a hit. It's a good place to drink as well as the booze is not very costly! Infact before south city opened in 2005, Tandoor Park used to be the only Bar in the area!!!

It is understood that when 9 beings with ravaging hunger steps near a restaurant, the people there get nervous. But Tandoor Park was kind enough and struggled a bit to accommodate all of us at one table. Pujas time, we guys were very very tired, and the food didn't make much of an impression as we were too focused on the ambiance and cooling system.We ordered a combination of 5 chicken biriyanis (@ Rs 180 per plate),2 plates of Mutton biriyani (@ Rs 190 per plate) and a plate of Mixed Rice (@ Rs 150 per plate).We also ordered a couple of bottles of Fosters (strong) @ Rs 220 per bottle.I consumed the Mutton Biriyani.1. The amount was too less. Not enough to suffice.The flavour was fine. But it got cold within seconds and the taste gradually decreased.2. Service was fine. Can't complain much about it. But the waiter did look surprised when we ordered such a little amount of alcohol.3. The beer was absolutely awesome. My high point of the day.It was smooth and chilled.We ate less but we were satisfied with overall atmosphere.We paid a bill of Rs 1975, which is moderate.I would recommend this place for the alcohol.

Dis plce ws in my wshlist snce long.. it ws an unplanned visit fw days bck. Firstly I had to wait for about 45 minutes..den finally we got our table.. This place is too dark though good ambience for drinks and relaxing or chatting wd frnds. Coming to the food,well we orderd assorted kabab platter,keema naan and chicken rara masala. We had to wait for around 20-25mins for the food, but, once we had d frst bite we knew it ws worth waiting.. ol d kebabs in the plattet wre so perfectly cooked.. and naan and chickn rara masala was a brilliant combination.. d additional flavor of ghee brought a new dimension to d dishs..
Coming to the price..well if its nt too pocket friendly its nt dat ovrpriced evn...qte a moderate price.. for two of us..it was around 1000.. which is affordable once in a while.. so for me..it was a gd xperience..just tht may b frm d nxt tym i wl mke sure that i go preplanned and olrdy bk a table.

The ambience is quite decent with a widescreen led placed r8 in d middle of the room allowing everyone to gt a clear view. This place has got its own ciggrttee counter, so no need to leave the cool air conditioned room. Smokers r provided wth a separate smoking zone..
We expected a fall in the food quality since it is puja but we were amazed to treat ourselves with such a delicious meal .
We took mutton biriyani , mixed fried rice and a murg chickn and believe me it was litetally finger lickin

After getting badly drenched in the rains on shoshti (30.09.2014) we reached Tandoor Park at 12:43 pm. 9 of us were there and the manager there was kind enough to let us in with our totally wet dresses with water dripping from them. 
We were seated with 4 paper sheets spread on each chair. xD
The ambience was just like any other average restaurant. 
The staff were a bit inattentive, according to me.
Being ridiculously hungry, we started ordering from the 'Special Puja' menu which had some of the basic dishes.
Being totally wet, we wanted some soup but that wasn't there in the menu. 
So we headed onto the starters and main course. 
Food we ordered : 
1) Fish Finger (2 plates) ( Rs.275/plate) : Six pieces per plate. Too sleek in size. Tasted okay-ish.  Nothing extraordinary. Not worth at all. 

2) Chicken butter masala (3 plates @ Rs.250/plate) : 4 small pieces of chicken kebab in white gravy which was supposed to be as smooth as butter but it was just the opposite with the masalas and water totall4 visible separately. Tasted okay.

3) Fish Tikka Masala (1 plate @Rs.295) : 4 pieces of fish tikka (the size was somewhat better than the chicken tikkas) in a gravy which was sweet and tasted like the bengali preparation called 'Maaccher Kaliya'. Well we wanted to have north indian cuisine but alas we didn't know what we were actually having. 

4) Butter naans ( 6 pieces @ 40 each) : A single naan was divided into 3 portions. The naans were soft and thin. 

5) Chicken Biryani (2 plates @Rs.180/plate) : A single plate was not enough to suffice a single hungry person. The biryani was over loaded with rose water. Too much of rose water was actually killing the hunger of the people. The chicken piece of not too small but not too big. The potato tasted good. 

6) Mutton Biryani (3 plates @Rs.190/plate) : This had had the same story with an overdose of rose water. 

7) Fresh lime soda (6 portions @Rs.75) : The only saving grace for that afternoon. 

The sub total was Rs.3215 and after the addition of 4.944% service tax (Rs.158.93) and 14.5% vat output (Rs.466.19), the total bill came out to be Rs.3840.

Not worth the money paid. 
I am not sure if to blame the puja crowd for the bad food or not.

Maybe recommended for a one time visit. 

Happy eating. :D

We have been here only twice but honestly both times we were completely satisfied with the food and of course the courteous staff. Go for Indian Non veg dishes and breads and kebabs if you want to taste some good quality stuff. I love the second room they kinda have as it offers more privacy and you get all this in the heart of the city. Location is pretty fantastic as well.

We visited this restaurant during the durga puja. The inside of the restaurant is a low lit place with nothing fancy whatsoever. The Ambiance is quite good though, with the low lit conditions making it a personal candle-lit dinner sort of feel. We we surprised when they provided us with the menu, because the prices were quite high than the ones which was provided in Zomato. They should really update it. We ordered 3 biriyanis each being priced at 180. We added some starters and my friend ordered a beer for himself. The prices were quite steep and food quality was average to good. The service was fast and nice too. I'd like to add that this restaurant does take service taxes, so those of you who want to make it cheap, I suggest you to look elsewhere. Overall, I'd say 3.5 is well deserved and if anyone rates it above 3.5, I guess I'd say they are overrating it.

A special place for me afterall! Small entrance which atlast leads to a beautifully decorated warm n cozy dining place on the first floor.. and the perfectly lit dimlights make this place quite a beautiful place for a first date! Coming to food.. we ordered bharwan tangri for starters.. these huge sized chicken plus mutton combo tangri kebabs tasted awesome.. a must try dish if you go there.. in main course we ordered keema Nan, masala kulcha, chicken lababdar and mutton kurchan.. keema Nan tasted too good.. the chicken and mutton dishes were spicy n rich and very tasty.. quantity of food in every dish was enormous! But you can sit and enjoy your food slowly for hours without any disturbance from any one! waiters were a bit slow.. kept reconfirming our orders 2-3times!! Well with its such a prime n easy-to-find location,quality food, great bar menu & quite reasonable prices I would have rated this place 3. 5.. but finally its a 4.. afterall, the ambience was too peaceful and unexpectedly romantic as well!

Although the booze is a bit pricey but still it is worth a visit. the lamb they serve is succulent and melts in your mouth. end result, you are flying high above the clouds with storks..... :D and the ice cream brownie they serve is something unparalleled. just give it a try once. otherwise you are missing something quite exquisite in your life. I give this place 4 stars.

The restaurant is overpriced. The hospitality and ambiance of the restaurant is not at all good. I went here with colleagues in a group of 12. The waiters kept us waiting for long before serving each of the items we ordered and the long waiting almost killed our appetite. They didn't pay any heed towards our complains. While the food were served, they became cold, almost non-edible kind. 
I wouldn't recommend anyone at this restaurant for food at least, so "rude, bad-mannered waiters" !!

I am writing this review basing this place as a great place to go for a couple of drinks for a pretty cheap price... near the gariahat area there are very few watering holes which is decent enough to visit... tandoor park tops the list...

the good part as other places is that there is a TOTALLY separate place to go for men only and the family section is completely different.... this helps the women and families there to enjoy dinner...

now the alcohol is cheap and the food which is a little over priced tastes pretty good for a place like this... my friends say the chicken there is really good and they make sure to order quite a bit of it when they go...

as for the vegetarian part of things the menu has few options but what they serve is pretty good to go with your drinks...

all over a nice place to go to for a casual drink with a friend and chill....

Have visited this place quite a few times now. The first thing is where you get to sit. If you are an "All-Male" group the guard will take you to the back door from where you will board an elevator to the 2nd floor. Needless to say you will find yourselves sitting among (drunk)people you won't like being with. If you have a female companion you will enter through the front door to the better seating place. ¬†I have experienced both.¬†
By the way both floors serve hard-drinks.
Now coming to the food.
The name says it all. Try more Tandoor stuff than normal main course dishes that you will get anywhere.
Tandoor chicken is probably one of the best in town. And so is the Fish finger.
Love the dhania dahi chutney they give with the tandoor chicken.
The Mutton Sheekh ¬†Kabab is a bit dry. Had to use the lime soda to get them finished.
The Bharwan Tangree is something unique that I had here. Beautifully cooked chicken leg pieces with the surprise of Mutton Keema inside the meaty part of the leg-piece. Absoulutely delicious. You will finish it before you even know you started. They give 4 pieces in 1 plate
Ambience is nice... Service is good. You can spend time there with friends and a few plates of tandoor anytime of the day.

A decent shop. 

The quality of the Chicken Shawarma Roll and Salad has crash landed. 

Kebabs are tasty and a special mention must be made of the Bharwan Tangri Kebab. Chicken Tangris stuffed with Mutton Keema. Yumilicious!

Chinese dishes have become poor as well. The meat used to prepare Shredded Lamb is extremely soft and delicate. Melts in the mouth.

Do not try Biryani. Not up to the mark. An absolute faux pas it was, the day I tasted it.

Cocktails are very expensive. Even costlier than Peter Cat.

I hv visited this place four to five times.
The ambience of this place is good but nothing very special.
I hv tried diff. Kababs , tandoor dishes , biryani etc...all the foods which I hv tasted were yum. Lat me kai (chicken dry item) is one of the fav dish of mine  over here.

Without exaggerating too much, I would go on record stating that this restaurant genuinely deserves a meatier overall rating than 3.5. I have been there only once, and though there wasn't anything supremely novel about the place, there's no denying that this is a damn good place to hang out with your friends& family and have an absolute blast. For starters, you don't have to wait outside the two- tiered restaurant, as they have a separate, comfortable arrangement for people waiting to get in. The interiors are at par with any first- class restaurant and the seating arrangement within is pretty appealing too. 
The food we ordered (Chicken Tangdi Kabab, Butter Naan, Mutton Biryani, Palak Murgh) was gulped down in no time as everything felt like bliss within the mouth. The quantities were more than sufficient for the two of us as we were literally huffing and puffing  to finish off the last few bits. Special mention needs to be made of the Biryani they served- it was simply out of the world! Served in a pot, the biryani was way more aromatic& lip- smacking than any of the Shiraz& Arsalan versions I have had in the past. The meat was tender, juicy& the succulent potato merged beautifully with the spices amalgamated within the Biryani. The Palak chicken too, was one that deserves an encore, the next time I barge in here.
I am hoping it wouldn't be too long...and I am also hoping this place has a meatier rating than a measly 3.5...!!

Near and around jadavpur area, i think this is quite a decent option u have for a good dine-in experience ......
They are specially good in their starters section ,more than in 'main course' dishes. ...... If u visit here, make sure u certainly try out  Lat Me Kai , Taipei Chicken and Konjee Crispy Lamb ........
Mixed fried rice i found pretty ordinary both in look and taste  ......looked more like polao (fully white in color) ....... :)
Also tried Phad Thai Chao Wang ...... taste was ok ....not exceptional ...... 
Biriyani or any other Indian dishes i haven't tried here ,so can't comment ......
Though its a bar cum restuarant , u r not allowed to smoke inside (as u would find in many other bar and restuarants) ..... so no problem for the non-smokers ....... has separate sections for family as expected .......
I would surely love to visit them again for the above mentioned starter items .....

It's the 2nd time I went to Tandoor Park. It looks like a decent place to spend some time with your family or friends with a beer or two. But the actual surprise starts when the waiter starts taking your order. These guys are decent, have food knowledge & have good etiquette. To be honest, I didn't expect that in a  joint in Selimpur..!
Next pleasant surprise comes as Kebab Platter with lacchedar onions & green chutney. These 13 kebabs were soft, succulent & tasty. Between starters & main course I had a couple of Tuborgs which were served extra chilled & in appropriate glassware. For me & my wife I ordered Keema Buttered Naan & Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The main course was damn tasty, more than sufficient for both of us (we had Kebab Platter before this, remember?)
The only concern for me was serving time. Both for starters & main course. It was more like of generation gap between orders where I was keep forgetting when was the last meal I have eaten...!!!
RECOMMENDATION: YES SURE

Nice ambience, variety of menu in food and beverages both.
Seperate section for males only and family ! I have visited both the sections and I was satisfied by the service as well as food taste !!
So if u r ready to shell out some extra bucks for ambience food etc. then its
highly recommended in and around Dhakuria area !!

Tandoor Park...My Local Eatery...My Local Passion. Being a restaurant, just within a walking distance from my home, has the best ingredients to cherish the test buds of foodie like me specially the locals who know what it can deliver! After a record breaking hot spells of summer this year, moderate downpour came last week just like a blessing for me to enjoy the rain on my way! Although, it was my third visit to this place, but every time I visit, true value for money returns back with me. It was a Tuesday I decided to dig into Tandoor Park with my family. As the name suggests, must try dishes should also contain tandoor items. And I make no mistakes each time of my visit. Starters have enormous varieties, but I always try to test their Crispy Lamb, which I think one of its best starters. This time I did not go for any boneless dishes of chicken, hence I chose Murg Musallam. As far as test is concerned, it is little bit spicy and rich in gravy (contains potato), but one dish is enough and I think a good choice for a small family alongside with various breads from tandoor. I always take more than 2 types breads to check their delicacies. Keema Naan, one of my favourite and is just awesome with the chicken dish. One thing I noticed this time, masala kulchas are unnecessary thick as compared to pouring. Service is pretty attentive. Interiors are average. But above all cost is not a matter at all here as compared to satisfaction.

I and my wife had visited this restaurant yesterday and we tried Lasuni Murg Tikka and Fish Tikka Kebab. The Murga Tikka tasted good but the Bekti used for the fish tikka was awful. I am a fan of fish items and have extensive knowledge of how to buy a good fish of any variety and am very sensitive towards quality of fish. By far my knowledge the Bekti used for the preparation was stale or have been frozen for at least 3 months. It lacked the juice and tasted like grounded chalk-powder. The worst part is when I informed the steward about this he was quite indifferent and did not even bother to beg for apologies. I have been to this place quite a few times but this was completely unexpected. Has the quality standards of food deteriorated? I am compelled to think in this direction.

Some places are your go to for all occasions - Sad, happy, ecstatic, lethargic, hungry, not so hungry...(I hope you get the gist) and for me Tandoor Park is such a place. Average decor, average service, slightly above average food. But what I love about this place is that in the numerous times I have visited There have been hardly any wait (except for one fateful Friday evening). But this place does get pretty crowded at times. I guess it's the location and the multicusine with the bar factor. I love the tandoori starters here - Tandoori Chicken is juicy and huge portions, Chicken Reshmi is beautifully spiced, the Fish Tikka fresh and flaky but best of all is the Bharwan Tengri Kabab - spicy mutton mince stuffed in Chicken thighs. Absolutely Delish!! The Chinese Starters are good too....Chicken Lat me Kai, Crispy Fish Dry Chilli, Fried Spring Chicken, Fish and Chips, American Corn Salt and Pepper are my recommendations. I absolutely loved the Tom Kha Soup....Insane Flavors!!! In the main course, all are right, especially the Mutton Rara Masala. In Chinese I am a regular for the Chili Garlic Noodle.
What I love is the relaxed environment and nice ambiance. The waiters can be a bit annoying at times with not quite attentive and serving you the bill when you have not asked for it, but I guess it's bound to happen if you visit a place pretty often.
They do not serve all brands in Beer but I guess that's okay if you are not that picky about your brand. The Mojito was great as well as the Long Island Iced Tea.
Overall, it is a nice place to hang out with friends over a beer or few  drinks that is considerate on your purse.
Thumbs Up!!

Went there 2/3 times, recently as close as Sunday night.  Their tandoori is pretty good, and the foods are served quickly.

Ordered Chicken Chaap,and Roti last time. Though it was last as 10.30pm , the service man had a smile in his face. The food was HOT and served quickly. 

Overall, enjoyed it !!!

Went to Tandoor park after hearing good things about the place. Being the election day, got seats very easily and there was no waiting time. Else I saw that people had to wait for almost 20 - 25 minutes to get seats! Also something which I felt very strange about was the fact that they do not have any parking space and you have to find a vacant spot and park the car at your own risk. The guard asks you to park your vehicle in a spot and then comes after half an hour later asking you to move your car!!!
I went with my wife and ordered Fish & chips, fresh lime soda and one portion of chicken cantonese noodles in the main course. The fish and chips and fresh lime arrived within the next 10 minutes. Was quite impressed with the place till then. The Fish and chips seemed to be a hit with quite a few people. Though I wouldn't say it was bad, but it wasn't quite FISH n CHiPS...it was rather the bengali fish fry and chips that were served. Fresh lime was good.
And then the downslide in service started. For the next 30 min (timed it actually), the cantonese noodles didn't arrive. I reminded the waiter twice but he couldn't do anything apart from a feeble nod. Finally when it arrived, it looked to be in a sorry state. Moreover the waiter had no idea how to serve it. He kept trying to cut-off the noddles hanging at the end of his serving fork...quite hilarious actually if you are sitting in one of the adjoining tables and watching all this happen. The taste of the noddles was extremely average. And for people who haven't tasted cantonese noddles before, try it at Jimmy's restaurant in free school street. Finally disgusted with my main course having gone wrong, I paid-up (almost Rs. 600 for two people) and came back with a vow to never visit Tandoor Park again. A restaurant that charges Rs. 600 for two with just 2 items and fresh lime ought to know about food and what customers look for in restaurants nowadays.

Have been there twice.. I simply love their ambience.. Its classy.. The decoration inside gives you a feeling that you've actually come to a posh restaurant.. They have too many items on their menu card which is a good thing.. The prices are high but the food quality is great.. I'd tasted both mughlai and chinese dish at ths restaurant and I liked both.. I remember ordering Shahi polao once which I'd never tasted before and it tasted delicious.. The staff behaviour is good too.. In short, a very good restaurant.. :-)

Being a jadavpur university student, Tandoor park was one of our regular hangout place. I can boast that I know this place inside out. Its a semi-luxurious restaurant, which is pretty good for evening hangouts with decent food and drinks. The kebabs are good. But whenever we wanted to taste kebabs here, instead of picking any individual kebab,we always went for assorted kebab platter. That's a steal in my opinion. The biriyani is average and so is Chicken butter masala. Among the side dishes, I must recommend mutton bhuna gosht that really stands out from the rest.In the continental section, I should recommend the crispy shredded lamb with green pepper. However if anyone asks me to pick the best of the restaurant, it won't be any food. In my opinion, they prepare some of the best mojitos in the city. It's just heavenly and extremely refreshing.
Now since I said that I know this restaurant inside out, I must state the cons also. The first thing that comes into mind is the behavior of the staffs. You won't be able to notice it if you visit the restaurant once or twice. But an once regular customer like me will always tell you that the behavior of the staffs here is extremely inconsistent. Most of the times they will be cordial, but on a counted few occasions, I and my friends have received very harsh behavior. The second con is most of the times you'll hafta wait outside the restaurant in order to get a seat. Waiting time may sometimes cross an hour which is pretty irritating.
All in all, its an average restaurant with its own merits and demerits and that's why I have given it an average rating.However I will still recommend people to taste its mojito at least once.

This is a place where i always llloved to come. It is a semi-luxurious restaurant, nicely decorated and has two floors (though the ground floor is closed most of the time, and a hhuge queue is always there, specially for the dinner). The place is very near to my place (Jadavpur), and is a perfect one to relax and chat with your family or friends with lovely cocktails and delicious starters. The screwdriver with fish tikka kabab is just heavenly. The amount of food is also very generous. Though the name is 'tandoor park' but i just love their chinese dishes. My all time favourite is the chicken thai soup and the veg gravy noodles (one of the veg preparations which my non-veg pro taste buds  crave for :P !!) . The place is so comfortable and so are the waiters,taking so much care of the customers, that time passes by just like that with good food and drinks. Cost wise it is a bit expensive compared to other eateries around, but the price is definitely worth the food and the quality time I bet anyone would have there.

Tandoor park is a de facto choice wheneve I go out to see durgapuja in Kolkata with my friends. Nice place near jodhpur park. In the time of pujas the crowd is a little too much but feels nice. The Biriyani is awesome along with the Tandoor murg. Also must taste the Paneer tikka , Mutton bhuna ghost. I tried the baby corn fry it was great. The waiters are nice they really take good care.

At the time of durga puja the rush is too much so they cut down some of the items from the list but still the place is amazing for  dine with family or friends

sprawled over two floors in the heart of south kolkata, tandoor park is a fun place - ideal for a pick-me-up after work, as well as a reminiscing session with friends. while the hustle and bustle inside makes it quite inappropriate for a family dinner, the atmosphere inside is quite appealing per se. the chinese masks and paintings are a bit out of place at a restaurant with this name, but once inside, they make for decent conversation starters. a segregated smoking room finds favour with those willing to raise their high, while at the same time, protecting those who despise passive smoke. 

the kebabs are soft, succulent, and worth every bit of the money. every meaty variety is represented well on the assorted platter, while the pahari kebab is juicy on the inside and bejeweled with mozzarella cheese on the outside. the fish fingers and tandoori mushroom are also appetizing. the mutton seekh kebab, however, is grainy and slightly insipid. however, it is encouraging to note that the butter naans are not chewy and the kali daal has a smooth texture. 

alcohol prices are on the higher side though, and service is slow, perhaps only to allow the guests more time to catch up. overall, a brilliant place to travel to for a friendly rendezvous, but not worth a long drive through the city merely for the fare.

So we had a couple of friends over. And wanted to have some naan chicken north Indian style. Luckily this was the only restaurant nearby (apart from the same we only could see bakeries and roll corners),
The food was rather good. And was pocket friendly too. Since I live nearby am definitely visiting again.

One tip. Try their mutton keema or chicken rolls. They are one of the best i have had so fat. The roll window they have opens out to the street. They also take roll orders.

On 27th-Mar-2014, I went to dine at Tandoor Park restaurant, Jodhpur Park with my family, including my 72 yr old mother. We were in wagonR and asked for a parking place close by and also asked for helping my mother to the lift as she has difficulty in walking. But surprisingly, the security at the lift side entry of the restaurant, misguided us for parking our car and also did not allow my mother to alight beside the lift entry to the restaurant. To our further dismay, when a police constable came for parking/waiting on the main road, just in front of the restaurant, the security point blank denied of having conversation with us making us a gullible traffic violator. This was the first time I was going to dine at Tandoor Park, on recommendation by a colleague, of their delectable cuisine, But what happened left me dismayed, baffled & perplexed and also being reprimanded by my family not to venture here again. I would, therefore, ardently request the Management of Tandoor Park restaurant to employ good security and staffs at the entry point(s) of their restaurant with amicable behavior, so that patrons like us do not have to carry back such a nightmarish feeling...Regards...D Mukherjee, 9088761310.

Nice and cozy family restaurant and bar. Dim lit with side rack to keep your belongings making it cool for group of four. Even if you are a couple, the coolness does not subside. Starters could be better. We didnt order main course, so unfair to judge them for our lack of appetite, however the service was decent. Good collection of liquor to choose from.
Overall the location of the restaurant adds to its convenience and safety even if you are a slow eater. Hence, not required to rush with your dinner. 
Perfect for people who enjoy Park Street level eating joints and privacy but not its cacophony.

Visited Tandoor Park after a gap of almost a year, which used to be my favourite hang out place during my college days. I have tasted almost all the items here as I have visited this place over 50 times during the three years of my college life.

Location and ambiance: Located opposite to the Indian Oil petrol pump and Jodhpur Park post office, Tandoor Park is a multi cuisine restaurant cum bar. It is spread over three floors, the ground and 1st floor being family section and the 2nd floor is for stags only. Also there is a separate entry for it. The ambiance is simple, but the tables are pretty big with comfortable sofas and chairs.The 2nd floor stag section has a huge 42 inch(or 46) tv where you can enjoy cricket/football match (usually during IPL/World Cup). I have witnessed many important and debatable IPL/ world cup matches with my friends here :) 

Food: The tandoori chicken used to be my favourite but recently the quality and taste has dropped tremendously. It always used to be soft and succulent but on recent visits I have been disappointed. Even the chicken sheek kebab is too dry and bland for my taste. Chinese items are pretty good especially the Lat me kai and Tai pei chicken. Goes well with a drink or two. In main course,  I like the chicken hakka noodles. They used to make really good butter naan, not sure if they maintain the same quality. The chicken lababdar is a very very nice main course option and goes well with butter naan/tandori roti.
Have never tried the biryani here so cannot comment, but most of my friends feel that its good enough. 
Drinks are priced around Rs150-Rs200 for 60 ml whisky. Beer is priced around Rs170 for a 650ml bottle. 
This place will always be special to me since I had the first peg of whisky at Tandoor Park P, back then a 60ml peg of signature used to cost Rs 70 :P. Slowly but steadily the prices have increased but unfortunately the quality of food has deteriorated, especially in the recent past. 
In desserts I really used to like the Tutty Fruity but again it is not as good as it used to be :( 

Service: Service is just okay, most of the old staff have left it seemed. 

Conclusion : Tandoor Park used to be one of my favourite place to hang out with friends or even for a simple dinner with family, but recently my experience has not been satisfactory. Either the management or the chef has changed which is responsible for such a situation. Tandoor Park is yet another restaurant which could not hold on to its standards and I will have to unfortunately rate it as average. You can visit if you are near Jodhpur Park and want a drink or two and not burn a hole in your pocket. Average cost for two should be Rs 700 (with out drinks)

I joined my friend on his Birthday bash, the place is very easy to find, with its immensely big name engraving. The edifice is fully dedicated to the diner which has two floors. By entering the first floor you will find a plain wooden furnishing. When you climb up on the top floor you will note that the place is furnished luxuriously with cozy sofas. They put a small but flashy bar at the corner of the place. 

We landed ourselves one of the comfy sofas. I have to mention you they have wide range of food option from to choose. To begin our feast we ordered Boti Kebab and Paneer Tikka. 

Boti Kebab- This chicken kebab was finely slice, and dipped in Asian prices. I find it not that appealing on taste buds. Yes the chicken was tender, melts in your mouth. But it was not that charming to relish. 

Paneer Tikka- The paneer was well processed in spices, but it was bit of chewy. 

On the whole we did not please by the starters. Then we ordered our main course, two chicken Biryani with Chicken Lababdar and on vegan side we had Sahi Pulao with Paneer Butter Masala. 

Chicken Biryani- The Biryani was presented in small Handi, which looked small but had ample amount of food to share with someone. Rice was aromatic and medley of spices which danced on my tasted buds. It had small pieces of chicken including a bigger one. 

Chicken Lababdar- This boneless chicken dish was prepared with excessive grease, and had orange-ish red color, but gusto on my taste palettes. 

Vegan food- Sahi was loaded with dried fruits and fruits, they were bright in colors. Paneer Butter Masala, the white creamy gravy was rich in Indian flavors but lacked in seasoning. 

On the terms of service they are very warm; they welcome you with a big smile, and help you with your assortment. But they are not that fast on service as you expect them. But after all good food matters.

The restaurant is jus abt 10mins from my place so I do visit frequently. In love with the chicken tandoori. The chicken is always fresh. Also the biriyani is tasty. I am a big fan of the awesome collection of cocktailz n mocktailz. 
The ambience is cozy n comfy. The service is also ok.

Tandoor Park has been a breather when we wanted to chill after college or near home, and still remains so in the Jodhpur park area. Alcohol and cocktails are priced pretty decently and affordable in the midst of inflation (and the super bummer VAT). What I especially like about the place is their cocktails, customise if you may please and god, super strong they are. The cocktails taste good too and are served in pretty big glasses. Basically it is not a syrupy diluted so-called alcohol based drink. Another impressive aspect is the shooters, they are priced extremely well and I have gulped down almost all the varieties available. There is a chilli vodka shot that I absolutely love. Similarly, the options in whisky, beer are varied, and one need not be restricted to the kinds easily available around and can experiment without burning a hole in the pocket.

I have been to their tandoor specialty season several times and loved the rann and kebab platter. Very well cooked and tasty, add to it good quality of meat and fish alike. Normally I stick to the Chinese menu which tastes pretty decent. The konjee crispy lamb deserves a special mention here. It is the right amount of meaty and crispy. The rest can be put under one single bracket of being tasty and nice.

The only con is probably the long wait on weekdays and weekends alike, but at least that ensures the place is good enough, doesn't it?

A savior in South Kolkata as it offers a bar and a pretty decent one that too. Excellent location, equally easy to spot- all very good.
Weekday or weekend, hardly matters, Tandoor Park is perpetually crowded. but, worry not!  They have smart and fast waiters to rescue you and get you a neat place to sit. Good point for that. 
Huge space inside, dim lights, though a little on the darker side, a  bit more brightness could make me happier. To punch it all, an okayish place to sit, eat drink and chill with pals without a stinging worry about your pocket.

Now, let's get to the meatier part. The food.
KEBABS.
Bharwan Tangri- Marinated chicken legs stuffed with spicy mutton keema and charred to perfection. Pure goodness!
Pahari kebab- juicy boneless chunks of chicken, flavorful indeed. Little shavings of cheese on top that instantly brings a smile.

CHINESE STARTER
Crispy Konjee Chicken - The usual batter fried shreds of chicken fried to crispness and coated with sweet chilli sauce. Good enough.

INDIAN GRAVY CURRIES
Chicken Lababdar- Soft, well cooked chicken pieces in a rich yellow gravy. Creamy and tasty but slightly bland for my taste.
Murgh Kurchan- Definitely more pleasing to my tastebuds. Indian version of stir fried shredded chicken. Quite spicy, just the right kind of semi-oily texture. Fried onion and capsicum strips as the garnish made me happy.
Bhuna Ghosht- Clearly the winner. Mutton cooked to tenderness in a brown, whole spice and onion gravy. Yummy.

Lastly, the butter naan was both buttery soft at places and roasted crispy at some other. oh1 and they manage to concoct a decent Mojito.
Just a word of caution- better if you don't use the washroom as it stinks and might readily spoil the good mood that the over-all experience generates.

I've been to Tandoor Park quite a few times before, but this was the first time as a reviewer in Zomato. First things first, I love coming to this place. The restaurant is just a few minutes walk away from my house, the location is amazing and it offers a warm and cozy ambiance for family get-togethers.

Tandoor Park produces superb Indian cuisines and this time was no different either. This is what we ordered:

1. Bharwan Tangree: An office colleague (who has been here before) suggested that "this is one starter i MUST not miss". Thank God, I took her advice. What a beauty! Never had anything like this before. Chicken leg pieces stuffed with spicy mutton keema... enough said!!
2. Tandoori Roti: A little coarser than usual (I've tasted better tandoori rotis on previous occasions). You can go for the Kulcha or the Butter Naan instead. You won't be disappointed.
3. Chicken Rara Masala: Another big surprise. Classic Punjabi cuisine - succulent chicken pieces in super spicy gravy. It's like one of those dishes you know you just can't stop gobbling.
4. The Drinks: Tandoor Park's biggest USP is that it has a wonderful bar. You have the option of getting confused while choosing from their wide range of drinks. The attendants are polite and knowledgeable; feel free to ask them in case you need a suggestion.

Note: Doesn't matter if it's a weekday, just be a little early to arrive. Tandoor Park is always full. So consider yourself lucky if you get your table within 10 minutes. But no matter how long you wait... both the quality and the quantity of the food will be worth it.

1.5/2.5 for food, drinks and service. I want to comment about the reservation. With all the hoopla of reservation recommended and even a number to do so (I don't see the point otherwise as I don't check menu over phone). When I called to reserve I was told they cannot reserve a table although the place is empty. My impression was that this place would rather wait for the crowd than reserve. Excellent business perspective. However as a customer I always thought that reservation was for customer benefit. I would have felt more secure about my dinner plans with a reservation which I did not. Tandoor park does not consider "The customer is always right" only "Profit comes first". I will give them 1 bonus points because I did get a place when I finally checked on them. However BEWARE customers. (Knowledge is crucial)

I visit this place quite often and recently noticed that the service has become horrible. Last time I visited the place with few friends of mine, the waiter behaved in such a fashion as if he is doing some kind of favour to us by taking the order and delivering the same. One of the starters was served just after we finished our main course! He delivered the salad when we were having our desert! Pathetic!! Though the food is just awesome, specially the bharwan tengri kebab and the pomfret tandoor, I cannot give them more than 3...just because of that particular IDIOT. If you exclude that person, its a High Five.

i have been going to this restaurant for the last 6-7 years and it has almost never failed me! with a great mughlai and an equally appetizing continental menu we were never short of trying out options! my personal favorite has always been the dry chilli chicken as the starter, any of their special pad thai noodles with a chicken prep for main course or their amaaaazing american chopsuey complete with huge chunks of chicken,pineapple and what not  for continental fare and as for the indian side, my absolute favorite is their sweet shahi pulao, chicken reshmi kebab and tandoori

Long before South City Mall, Tandoor Park was the only decent Bar/Restaurant in the vicinity. By the word decent I mean a clean air conditioned place which accept cards and have a washroom. The only reason I used to go there was for the bar. The food is very ordinary. I would usually order fish fingers or just prawn chips to eat with my drinks. I remember ordering dinner a few times but that is something which has eluded my memory. This is no place to go to if you want to have a meal which you will remember. But if you are in Jodhpur Park alone one evening and you're thirsty, then that is the only time I'd recommend you going to this place.

Yesterday went to have dinner. I gave order of dhingri kebab as a starter and for the main course sahi pulao and kadhai paneer.  food is good but the mushroom of the kebab is very small in quantity but it was tasty.  There is only one bad thing about this place i,e they delay to serve food and also the beverage. Staffs are well attentive and take care for the guests.



----- 15 Jun, 2012 -----

This is a pet place for many in the Dhakuria-Lake Gardens-Jadavpur area. If you have anywhere to go for a lunch or dinner, and you don't know where to go - reach out for Tandoor Park. This place is very stable and dependable. Food quality might not be great, but definitely very good. Reach very early during weekends, else you have to wait for at least 30min.

Well visited this place after ages.This was possible courtesy the voucher from Zomato that i had won for the "Write for  a Bite " contest.This is one of the few places that has an attached bar in South Kolkata and is very popular due to its prominent location.I tried out the Indian cuisine so can comment on those dishes only.They  do also have a pretty exhaustive array of  Chinese  dishes as well.
I tried out items like Fish Finger which was strictly okay. Bhuna Gosht- boneless pieces of mutton in dark brown gray of mutton keema which was too good.The pieces of mutton were properly boiled and soft -a rarity amongst most restaurants.Chicken Lababdar- a tasty dish of boneless cubes of chicken in a rich gravy and Dal Makhani which was also pretty decent.The letdown was the Butter naan which was tough and chewy. Masala Kulcha was the face-saver in the roti/bread section.
Prices of dishes are reasonable. Size of the helpings  is adequate and should leave no scope for complaints .
Alcoholic drinks are fairly priced.They have an offer going on at present-a soft drink free for every 2 large pegs of vodka ordered together.This joint is a major hit among tipplers and is jam-packed in the evenings especially the  stags section on the second floor.This is perhaps one of the few places in Kolkata that perhaps still allows smoking-(unconfirmed and based on hearsay) :) So that is the added attraction for regular drinkers who smoke as well :)
Special mention: For families there is a separate section on the ground and the first floor.These two sections are not as crowded as the second floor stags section.Waiters are friendly and their recommendations on dishes to order are bang on target.Items apart from those mentioned above which are good are the mutton/chicken rara masala,murgh masallam, bharwan tangree-kebab of chicken leg pieces stuffed with mutton keema. Intend to try these items in my next visit .Cheers and Bon Appetit :)

Tandoor Park is a place where I used to visit long back since it is one of the very few areas in south Kolkata where you(used to) get good kebabs to go with your drinks and I definitely like that combination since I am more or less fed up with chinese starters and fish fingers and fish fry to go with the drinks.
However the fun part is they have a chinese section too just in case you like that combination.
So it used to solve most of our problems and we would go to this place more often than not.
However, the prices rose and we still did not mind as the hardcore drinking phase was over so we would pay a visit until things changed as the quality started falling. The fact that it allowed smoking inside was a reason why a few friends used to go there still as this is probably the only one in South Kolkata which allowed that.
Since I was somehow displeased with their quality and for other reasons(huge fall in quality during pujas which we being somewhat regular did not expect to apply to us also) stopped visiting...That was 1 and a half years back at least....
Things changed as zomato gave me a voucher to this place.....
About Tandoor park well..
 1) Tandoor park seems very small from outside but actually packs quite a punch inside.
2) The decor is quite good
3) They used to make averagely good cocktail did not try it out this time.
4) The quality of food is average but the prices are as you may expect in a higher range because it is the only decent bar in   the area in that range.
5) It has a family section which is always an advantage.
6) the waiters are very cordial and helpful...
Now, about my experience at Tandoor Park on my recent visit
Firstly, the place has not changed much...
Secondly the waiters were very courteous but though there was very few people seated the waiters at one point were too busy in talking among themselves..I tried to signal at them for quite a long time but to no avail...I finally had to call them by shouting out...I know its not there everywhere but this very thing makes an impression.
Thirdly the music and most importantly this thing was something which was so very sad at causing an impression the music was the boring instrumentals of rabindra sangeet songs...Either play the whole song or play some fast instrumental or other songs. I asked them to change it but that was not done also....
Fourthly and also very importantly the food...Now in the kebab platter I found the chicken tikka and reshmi very hard coarse and even tough to cut  along with the tandoori though the chicken hariyali, fish tikka and the Mutton sheekh kebab was really good...Later I guess the manager asked us how we liked it, we complained and they said we could have asked them to change it but then truly speaking the music itself drew away half our interest in the meal. I also feel that there should not be a reason for such food quality  as most like me do not like complaining there until its inedible which it definitely was not. The kabuli naan had more sugar coating than dry fruits which was a real turn off and I guess ta'aam makes it so very well that I was rather displeased though we liked the Masala Kulcha..The fish lababdar was pretty good though...The quality has improved from my last visit but it needs further improvement 
Fifthly  the lighting is not able to bring out the decor effect very well....nor is the decor very attractive but its not bad its acceptable....

Have been to this joint a few times for dinner and drinks. Place is clean but not very appealing. I found it somehow slightly off-putting. That set the tone for the rest of the evening. We tried the Biryani which was not good at all. The meat was tough and I found the rice to be over-spiced. On the other hand, the crispy fried chicken was all right, and it went well as a starter. We also ordered chicken chaap which was strictly average to tell the truth and I felt it is overly salty and oily.

Tandoor Park is a reminiscent of a mixed-bags experience. The restaurant has an extremely good location, at Jodhpur Park, R.S.C. Mallik Rd. South Kolkata. Coming to the key factor - food..... Chinese food 'used' to be served in mind-blowing quantity, which is no longer done. Taste and quality of Chinese is okayish - nothing extra-ordinary & nothing very repulsive. their food servings are clean and well-cooked.

Indian food - Bharwa Kebab is mandatory if you're visiting Tandoor Park! It is something that will keep hanging to your tongue and in your mind. The Chicken Lababdar is nice, so is their Green Pepper Lamb. Standard, taste and quality of food 'was' good, now it is just a bit below it. This has happen specially in past one year. Even their staff has degraded than the previous. 

Tandoor Park is good for a visit on weekdays and regular weekends. If it is festive season, then the restaurant is a big 'no'. There is always a huge queue because of its easy location. However, the shocking part is that during that time, they limit their kictchen availablity to a handful of food items, maximum 20. Prices are doubled. The taste of the food will make you feel as if the regular chef has been replaced. 

Other food items which are quite likeable are - Lazeez Tangree, Pahari Kebab, Mandarin Fish, Bhuna Mutton. But Fried-Icecream is no longer available, which is really disappointing, it is something to crave for.

I have visited this place numerous times.  There was a time, I would blindly opt for Tandoor Park all the year round. What keeps me going back are the above mentioned food and the distance from my home. However, I'm still optimistic that given a even tad bit of improvement, it'll jump back to its former 'tandoori nights' reputation !

Went there with friends a couple of nights ago, ambience was so so not very good. Food well the kabab for starters was quite average and later for the main course the chicken tikka was the only thing to look out for. The keshmi kabab preparation was not that extraordinary. Saying that i would say the quality of the food was very good and the service I got was fulfilling.

To be honest I did not have a great experience when I visited ...... this place is quite close to my residence so decided to drop by for a late lunch .... decor wise its decent enough. Due to the lateness of the hour it was fairly empty. The service was not great and we had to keep making multiple requests for the menu, water etc. We decided to order the assorted kebab platter along with Dal Makhani and Butter Naan. The kebab platter disappointed me the chicken reshmi kebab was quite nice and served hot and fresh but the fish and mutton kebabs were cold and quite obviously prepared earlier. The dal was also sort of luke warm. Our complaints fell on deaf years and our waiter explained that the cook was not available anymore !!!! The first thing we had asked when we entered was if lunch service was available and were told it was. Any way we just finished what we could and left quite put off with the experience.

When you are served stale food in a restaurant you just feel like throwing a fit and blacklisting the restaurant by letting other diners know about the horrendous food there. At least, that's how I felt when I was served rotten chicken and stale fried rice at Tandoor Park. Located on Gariahat Road, Tandoor Park is a restaurant cum bar that offers both Chinese and north Indian dishes. The cost of each item is a bit expensive compared to other restaurants in the same locality. But, if you compare Tandoor Park's food quality with the other restaurants, you'll probably give Tandoor Park 1-star  for serving stale, cold and rotten food to their guests.

The only con would be we were unable to find an entrance and the way we were led to the restaurant was a bit spooky. Anyway,once we were in,i found it like any other bar cum restaurant. Though i found it was mostly filled with guys,and that's coz of the bar probably,I really found the food out of the world. They served some really delicious north Indian food comprising paneer butter masala,navratan korma and malai kofta with masala kulcha. And to my surprise,the price was quite low given it's a bar and their portion sizes were enormous. Close to south city,try this for saving money and getting quality food together!

Being within 200 mts of my place, tandoor park is a frequent eatery for me. This place had been just a streetside fast food center previously, but what exceptional upbringing. The quality of food they offer is mostly good,although for select few the quality is exceptional. As to say, the assorted kebab platter. This dish gets over me each time. A mixed bag with finest selections such as chicken tikka,fish kebab, mutto haryali, mutton boti and chicken shammi kebab. Then comes the fish and chips. Usually quite good in its quality, but I have seen that fluctuate at times. But dont miss the chicken lababdar with masala kulcha (or butter nun). It simply is the creme-de-la-creme of all dishes. Just one advise for people opting to try beverages, dont try the cocktailis. They dont quite master the skills of blending and mixing. Bloody merry and screwdriver are far better in peter cat or trincas or amber, if you want to relish. Overall. a pretty happy eating experience.

A local food haunt for the Dhakuria-and-Jodhpur Park crowd, Tandoor Park flourished due to lack of dining options in this area. Then, South City Mall came up on on Anwar Shah Road - but even then, it continued to do well. Reason? South City Mall burns a big hole in the pocket! So taking full advantage of the situation, Tandoor Park merrily continues to churn up the staple Kolkata mix of North Indian and Chinese fare. Take in the flavours of their specialty items like Omar Khayyam ka Murgh and Chicken Tai Pei and some assorted kebabs. A regular stream of clients patronize the place.

Have been going to this place right from the time they opened up.....A regular till today... 
The place offers a wide range of food from Chinese to North Indian to Tandoori.... 
But as the name itself suggests, the Tandoor items are to die for... Amritsari Kebab is excellent... They also have this very unique kebab of Chicken legs stuffed with mutton keema called Bharwan Tengri.... 
Next on the list is the North Indian, with some excellent range of veg Pulavs...
The Ambience however isn't as good as it used to be.... Even the decor isn't updated that much..Previously we used to 'dine in' mostly, while now we prefer the 'take away'...
Still, this place remains an excellent joint for authentic tandoor.. 
Location is very convenient but parking can be a head-ache if u don't know the area well... There are a lot of bylanes and dead-end roads nearby which offer more than enough parking spaces..

I am aware it is mostly a tandoor specialty restaurant, but i could never stop myslf from ordering chinese for the simple fact that i could never get over their lip-smacking chinese dishes. It's been years now and every birthday or reception parties cant get enough of crispy baby chilli corn and honestly i feel like it has become a bleh dish...so tandoor park's crispy chilly american corn was a good choice...i know it doesn't sound much different but try it and you will know. The mocktails are better than what the bigger restaurants have to offer...and now that it's summer..i say go for the mango mocktail....one may want to fill up just on this heavenly drink.
Once upon a time long long ago i tried a dessert here...a rich and finely layered concoction of condensed milk, sujir payesh with dates sprinkled on the top. Never ever in my life have i ever had a dessert so delicious.

The service is wonderful...have never felt neglected...the waiters do their job well.

One of my favourite restaurants for sure. Good food mostly of tandoori type. However I also end up ordering their Fish Finger with tartar sauce every time. Other favourites include bharwan tengri which is chicken legs stuffed with mutton kima and also mutton rarha masala if you like spicy items.
Good service times considering they are always at full capacity.  If you ever plan to spend evening of special occasions like poila boishak or valentine's day be prepared for large ques.
They also have a separate section for stags .
downside being they have no good parking space

I have been visiting this place since childhood. They serve good food, both Indian and Chinese. Their seating area is nice, service is quick enough. Nicely decorated place, and comfortable seats. Now if you opt for Indian- you can begin with tandoori Chicken, move on to Biriyani / roti or Naan with Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Mutton Roganjosh. Mutton is usually tender and chicken too is nicely cooked. Biriyani is pretty nice, and is served in handsome quantity. 
If you choose Chinese, then you may start with Crispy Konji Chicken, move on to your choice of noodles/rice. Try their chicken in chilli soya, Shredded lamb with green pepper. You may try their fish too! They also serve Ice cream sundae, and i personally like their Tuti fruti sundae which is served with a lot of fruits. 
They are moderately priced, and won't burn a hole in your pocket. However the only drawback is for some reason it prohibits clicking pictures (atleast did a month back), so don't plan to treat friends here on any occasion! Plus this is not a fancy place, and at times their quality of food is questionable. Do visit once! Have fun! :)

When fund is limited and you have a good appetite, should visit Tandoor Park located on Gariahat Road opposite Jodhpur Park.  Tandoor Chicken, Nun, Roti, Soup, Palak-paneer are good options for meal.  However, it gets crowded and is advisable to reach there before the peak hour.

When you are served stale food in a restaurant you just feel like throwing a fit and blacklisting the restaurant by letting other diners know about the horrendous food there. At least, that's how I felt when I was served rotten chicken and stale fried rice at Tandoor Park. Located on Gariahat Road, Tandoor Park is a restaurant cum bar that offers both Chinese and north Indian dishes. The cost of each item is a bit expensive compared to other restaurants in the same locality. But, if you compare Tandoor Park's food quality with the other restaurants, you'll probably give Tandoor Park 1star or 2 stars for serving stale, cold and rotten food to their guests.

It was during the Pujas 2 years back when we dropped in here to have our lunch. Tired after pandal hopping the whole day, we slouched on the cushioned chairs (I must say that Tandoor Park has a nice ambience) and placed our orders. We ordered some chicken butter masala, egg fried rice and chicken reshmi kebabs ...and what awful food we had at Tandoor Park! The egg fried rice looked unappetizing. The reshmi kebabs were bitter and tasted awful. We tasted some chicken butter masala and it was just sickening! Those guys had served us rotten chicken in stale gravy.  We understood that we would surely fall ill if we ate their stale food. We complained about the rotten chicken butter masala, which was taken away, but they didn't care to replace it with a fresh one.  What a bitter experience we had on such an auspicious day! 

We finished our fried rice and kebabs half heartedly. We didn't feel like paying our bills, but we had eaten some fried rice and kebabs and had to pay for those. Each item was unreasonably charged and we hated paying so much for such unappetizing, sickening and tasteless food, but what to do! It was our bad luck. I would suggest never enter this restaurant or else you'll burn a hole in your pocket and get to eat only horrible meals.

Nearest bar to South city Mall.Best time to go is 6-8pm.The service is quick and the quality of food is good.A decent place to catch up with friends over a bottle of beer and starters.Ordered crispy fried babycorn,chilli mushroom,chilli chicken dry and Cosmopolitan (cocktail).The babycorn dishes arent great though the chilli mushroom and non-veg food is tasty.The ambience isnt good enough.

Location  : Along the main road. hard to miss. just near dhakuria bridge.
Food       : The food is quite good. Particularly the non-veg . The quantity is very good too.  I   particularly liked Chicken tandoori and lamb with green pepper. very succulent and moist and tasty. 
Service    : I had no problem with service. 
Atmosphere: Its somewhat dull and not much spacious.

Conclusion: Its a very budget restaurant with very good offerings. Nice to visit in late afternoon time.

i love their tandoori chicken. other delicacies are great as well. i remember having a chicken kabab in which they serve a chicken leg stuffed with chicken keema and that one is delicious. in main course, mutton kurchan and mutton peshwari was tasty, amount was decent for 2. drink price is on the higher side but the food is very good. they have separate area for family dinner and for fiends hanging out over a drink or two. they have a smoking room inside which smokers would like as the restaurant is on the 2nd floor and otherwise, smokers would have to go out of the building to smoke. great for family dinner as well as for a get-together with friends.

Surprisingly good service. They have a separate area upstairs for stags. The drinks are quiet reasonably priced. You get a large peg of Scotch for around 200 bucks. What more do you want? Add to that, you have long list of kebabs and tikkas for company. Tried the Fish Tikka kebab. Was excellent. Cost you Rs. 200 for that. All in all, a good place to catch up with old friends over drinks. The place was also very decent and the seating comfortable too.

It is the nearest bar to my house and regularly hit it for a peg or two. You can easily sit here and booze for hours. The grilled prompret actually goes well with the booze. The ambience appears a bit shabby but nobody will bother you and people generally mind their own business.

The Worst thing here is waiting in a queue. I have been here more than 10 times, Hospitality is good, Food i prefer the chinese one here though it is a north indian restaruant bbut the chinese dishes are far more better than north indian.
Reason: The starters are not so good specially the north indian as the chicken dish tasted Stale not once but thrice.
The resteraunt got 3 floors
ground one for family non-alcoholic, 1st floor for couple or family alcohol served and the 3rd for guys only for guys alcohol served and smoke allowed.
So do not worry about the comments which says you can't be here with your family or  girlfriend.
Well prices are ok not cheap not upmarket.
2 star from  my end
Must Try the Shooters and crispy chicken

Tandoor park is an exception to the boring, almost non-alcoholic south kolkata. This is the only place where u can sit and smoke in entire south i guess. Please dont come here with your girlfriend or elders, its a place for hangout with friends.
With your favorite drink, you can order chicken tandoori, fish tikka kebab. If you like chinese then go for  drums of heaven, pepper fish etc. I bet you will enjoy your drink.
Now lets come to the main course and in this case, i will suggest to taste butter nun, rashmi butter masala or chicken bharta. Mutton peshwari is also a gorgeous item. It is an easy to find place, so come here, you wont be disappointed.

This is the only place which serves liquor between Gariahat and Jadavpur or more; so this place remains obviously over crowded. This is probably a drawback for this place when you would need to wait for some time to get a seat even on weekdays. But its just not the liquor that draws people. The food here is pretty good. The liquor is cheap and so is the food. They serve very good kebabs and tandoors. The chinese food is also very good, I specially like the cantoneese noodles. The starters that you get with the drinks are pretty tasty. I would recommend this place even if someone does not have liquor. You can try out the chinese or the indian.

Well, this is a blunt warning ! Do not dare to enter this place if you cannot tolerate smokers and alcoholics sitting beside you. In addition to that, you might have to wait in a queue to dine. Isn't it weird? If you think so, give it a miss. 

Well, I was here to attend a relative's treat and had to wait for a little. But apart from these problems, I think as compared to other established joints in the city, their food and service was not that bad. We ordered a mix of Mughlai and Chinese, and in my opinion the Chinese stands out clearly. Although, the Mughlai is not that awful, but my advice would be not try it too hard. 

I think they should give some attention towards the ambiance, which looks little sad. And must say their service is really slow! I think, whatever it is, but you will feel like visiting this place again. May be, your taste buds would compel you. 

Overall, not a bad experience !

Earlier I had rated this eatery as something average. Well it is, if you go by their quintessential biriyanis and kebabs. However, if you venture out to the less explored part of the menu ( e.g. the Chinese section), i am pretty sure you will find something nice there. Just as I did.I ordered tom Kha Kai as the appetiser. the waiting time was a long one, but it turned out to be a really great dish. The soup was perfect, with a coconut milk base and with a perfect balance of Kaffir Lime and ginger. Next we had ordered chicken fried rice along with sliced chicken with vegetables. Both the dishes were pretty good. An the quantity was enough for two.

However, there are certain things about this place which is a huge turn off. 
A. The room in which we were seated was pretty gloomy and beside the bar. The bar counter was dusty and the basin behind the bar was frankly something I would not want to see during eating.

B. The waiting time is pretty high.

So, it's an average place with some good dishes in it's menu, but the ambience is not what one wants .

Go this place only if you are looking for food and don't care about the ambiance. The food is OK, but you may be disappointed with the Chinese cuisine. Chinese here means "Cornflour, garlic and ginger" with a generous amount of Soy Sauce. The major drawback of this place is the seating arrangement. You may have to bear the grunt of the smokers and drinkers and it may take you a lot of time to find a decent table. 
This restaurant is close to my place and it used to be good once upon a time but if you really feel like eating out and this is your closest option please get your food delivered home. 
The staff is not friendly and they will not respond to your queries. So it's best you avoid going there for a dine-out experience. 
Also remember to avoid their Chinese food. I had ordered Schezwan Chicken and it was one of the worst choices I have ever made in my life. 

Happy Eating :)

Visited several times with my friends. Ambiance is ok. Food qualty is pretty good, you can try Chinese or tandoor both are good.I specially like their tandoor "Chicken Lolipop" and "Chicken reshmi kebab", "chicken bharwan kebab","fish and chips" they are nice and must try dishes here. The main drawback is their service, it's too slow :(  But over all a good place to have food, snacks and Booz! :)

If  you  are a tippler  then you would  love this place .... specially the STAG-SECTION , VAT-69 here would cost you Rs 185 / 60 ml  peg ,  plus the food quality  is decent enough  ...  so is the quantity ... over all a decent place  to hang out with STAG-friends  ... one word of caution though ...  if you want to get  a  seat over here  then go there before 6.30 Pm  , otherwise they will make you sit just  beside the Smoking room  or toilet  .........  which  you don't want  right  ???  so be sure to visit them, before  6.30 pm and enjoy the drinks .... they have got a large LCD screen  as  well  , specially for  IPL season

Pathetic service,would rate in negative.
illiterate waiters,doesn't have any knowledge about any spicy dishes which they serve.
Took chicken tikka,it was horrible.  I wonder, the people who go to this place,how could they resist their pathetic behavior and terrific food.

Absolutly NO NO for all foodies.

If you love your money,try out some where else,but not this one..

Me and my friend went to the restaurant on a fine Monday. 

Food is good specially Reshmi Kabab. The Mango Mocktail also superb.

Ambience is good and their service also good. 

Only we waited too long for the bill. It took much time than food preparation and Security guard and other staff help us to find our seat. 

Only one problem is that the bar is attached with this restaurant which may create chaos.

I had a nightmarish experience with my family members which included my in-laws who are senior citizens; the guard at the entrance us entry because of some lame excuse; the food was awful and the service appalling; the waiters were unmannerly and short tempered , one them even tried to challenge and rebuked my mother in law; we were made to wait for 1/2 hour for rotis and not allowed to complain for the delays in serving us; the ambiance was worse than a roadside eatery ; but yes i learnt a new a definition of family from the guard; the atmosphere was stinking of booze; what a horrible dining experience i had. It is better to go hungry than eat in such 'shady' joint

The negative point of this restaurant is the SERVICE. Staffs are very unprofessional.Really they don't know how to take care of their customers. Ambiance is ok. Food quality of some cuisines are good, but over all its average and its prices are even higher than the quality of food served.

The place is pathetic, and has been divided into the family and the non-family sections. The so called 'non-family' section is really bad and ofcourse you get a 2nd grade treatment there. I went to this place with six of my friends who don't booze but still we were made to sit in that lousy non-family boozers section. On being asked to be given a better place, the staff was extremely unprofessional who don't even have the basic etiquette to handle a customer. The place is extremely poor and probably a no no for people who don't have a wife and children (this was the definition of a family given to me by the staff..lol). I am extremely annoyed with the second grade treatment meted out and would recommend anyone to avoid the place until you don't qualify as a 'family' in their terms.
