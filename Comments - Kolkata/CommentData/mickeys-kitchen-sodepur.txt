This is a little place that doesnot have any seating arrangement. So its basically take out. But the food is very tasty, the workers are well mannered and not much waiting time. So if you are looking for eating in, its a great place!

Very pleasant staffs, on time, good behaviour, could have given a five star, but curry was very oily.
Tandoori chicken was really good though. Overall a great experience. Recommended to the food lovers. They are really doing a good service.

I didn't had anything over here. I visit restaurants by seeing reviews. This hotel had pretty good reviews but when I went there I was shocked. There is no place to sit. It's a takeaway joint... what on earth people reviewed it as good ambiance... Very much disappointed food might be good but taking parcel ad having it cold no fun...

I am a fan of this particular place. Be it the owner of the place, who is one of the most humble man that I have met, or be it the taste and ambiance of the place. The place stands out on its own ahead of must others of its competitors. I have clicked some of the best moments that we have had in the place. Check the same and might be, you too will be spellbound!

Are you one of those who believed that there are no good restaurants serving chicken tandoori in Sodpur? Well, guys, believe me, you were wrong. This particular place in Sodpur has got me stunned. Located right beside the main road, this place has an ambiance like no other. Well, once I had spotted it, I wanted to have some good meal in the restrau.

As soon as I walked in, one thing that caught my attention for sure were the juicy tandoori chicken. I couldn't resist placing the order for the same. Yes, you can complain on one part and that is that they are not having a great sitting arrangement, but however, as soon as I had put the delicious food in my mouth, there was perfectly nothing that I had to complain about the restaurant. The chicken came with a pudina chutney and was juicy enough to keep me going. 

That was the first day and I have tried many things from this particular place. each and every dish, be it the butter chicken or be it the kababs and tandooris, each one of them will leave you asking for more! 

Don't forget to visit this place once, if you are visiting this place!

Odered chicken tikka roll for 50bucks. Very dry, not much tasty and not value for money. 2 star is for chicken tikka kabab which i odered earlier.

Have tried many delicacies out here, but trust me, their combination of chicken bhatra and Roti is the best match trust me! Every time I pass by, I drop in to have a taste of the same.
