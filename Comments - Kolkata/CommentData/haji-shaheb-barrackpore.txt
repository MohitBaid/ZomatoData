Price is quite cheap.. Biriyani was good enough bt the hospitality and ambience was not good enough! Please concentrate on that! Bt the biriyani was really good!

This is near barrackpore station. But this is not much popular like other restaurants around it. It's food quality is not better, just average. You may go other restaurant apart from it.

Definitely one of the worst restaurants in Barrackpore. Ordered food online through the Zomato App. The food took more than an hour to arrive. Moreover, the Veg Fried Rice had Biriyani Rice at the top, with shreds of mutton in it. What terrible food! Even the main course Chinese fare was awful. Please stay away from this place.

Beside west wind, it's just a okay type restaurant, I think delivery is better option for this restaurant.
I placed order for biriyani and chicken tikka masala. Chicken was okay, but biriyani was not tasty.

This resturant is near to barrackpore station and has a a good location. The interiors aren't catchy and the ac doesn't work properly. The food here is average. They usually Cannot serve half to the dishes in their menu, when asked by the customers. Kebabs here are good. I won't give it a thumbs up because you will find better ones in comparison to this place.

I brought some food like Mutton Biriyani,Chicken Kasha, and Mixed Fried Rice  on 25/12/2016. The Biriyani  was packed Cold, Chicken Kasha was so so and Mixed  Fried Rice was made with cooked  Biriyani Rice with some chicken pieces,a nasty preparation!!! They don't know how to prepare a Mixed Fried Rice!!! But they included it in their Menu!! A Horrible experience!!  Don't Go there by mistake.!

This is the 5th time i ordered Biriyani from Haji Shaheb, food quality is good. Delivery fast as everytime. But sometimes i felt Biriyani tasted different.

The food is satisfactory and at a reasonable cost. Fully air conditioned. Delicious foods. Specially the Indian foods. Biriyani is awesome the tandoori is too good. The meat is too good. Tender and moist  and the tandoori is so juicy :)
