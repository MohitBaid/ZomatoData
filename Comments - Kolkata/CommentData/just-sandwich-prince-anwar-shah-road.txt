Have tasted Sandwitch (chicken) several times. Quantity is good taste is also good but a little costly as compared to other sandwitch shops. Recomended as it is the only sandwitch shop available in this locality.

A tiny shop selling awesome sandwiches , burgers, & maggi. I tried the cheapest - Cheese Sandwich (‚Çπ30) for the first time & instantly became a fan. They gave 2 large sandwich bread slices along with chips & ketchup. Will definitely try all other sandwiches. This is only take away or you have to stand & eat, but it's worth it.

'Just Sandwich' is a very small kiosk selling Sandwiches, Burgers, Fries etc and is located beside South City mall, in the alley beside 'Bawarchi'. This little kiosk can be called upon as a little gem. I was surprised to see a 3.2 rating in Zomato and only three photographs. After watching 'Doctor Strange' in thr morning show of Inox, I was extremely hungry. I decided on visiting this kiosk. The kiosk is very small and has recently been colored. I skim read the menu and ordered one chicken sandwich first. The  sandwich was made in front of me. First, 2 pieces or bread was lathered with butter on their both sides. Then chicken pieces, bell pepper, tomatoes, onion eic were put on one of the bread pieces. Then, one half of a cheese slice and mayonnaise were added. Then it was covered with the other bread and was put in the grill. It took three minutes to grill the sandwich abd was served with potato chips and tomato sauce. This sandwich was delicious. The chicken was fresh, tender and juicy. I never expected such great taste at 60 rupees. I was impressed. Up next, I ordered one Chicken Club Sandwich. This sandwich was prepared in a different way. First, three pieces of bread was lathered with butter on both sides. Next, on one bread piece chicken pieces, bell pepper, onr half of a cheese slice and mayonnaise were applied. Now,on another bred piece mashed potatoes was added. Then, tomatoes, cucumber, onions, coleslaw, half cheese slice and mayonnaise were applied. Now, the third bread piece was put on it and the sandwich waa put in the grill. It took 4 minutes approximately to grill. This sandwich was humongous. The taste was also great. The combination of cheese ad mayonnaise along with chicken and mashed potatoes gave this sandwich a unique taste. I will definitely visit this kiosk again. They can certainly work on the hygiene issue a bit.
P.S-In the morning only sandwiches are available. Alk the other items are available from the evening.

This is a relatively new participant in the recent boom of food stalls inside the lane adjoining Haragouri Mistanna Bhandar ( beside the petrol pump near South City ). The tiny stall doesn't have any seating arrangement and serves a nice array of sandwiches along with a few wraps and soft drinks. 

The delightful grilled sandwiches come with mayo and cheese and are stuffed with generous quantities of the filing (chicken : scrumptious!) above the layer of onion, pepper and tomato. Do inform him beforehand if you want to skip any of the veggies. 

Although I would ask them to lift their hygiene factor a wee bit, I was overjoyed to find the items at prices as low as ‚Çπ45 for such an amazing chicken sandwich! This was a real deal. 

The shop is open every day and also offers home delivery in the nearby areas. Waiting eagerly to try out the rest of its offerings. :)

A stone's throw from my home, thus is located just 2 mins walking distance from south city mall, on the road leading towards poddar nagar from Prince Anwar Shah Road Domino's. A little known place that packs a punch. Limited items on the menu just like the size of the store, good healthy food, the best part is they let you customize your sandwich on demand, prices are very pocket friendly, i tried out the chicken sandwich, nicely done with all good proportion of shredded chicken and toppings, recently they have added parantha combos available with Chicken and  all time favorite 'aloor dom'. Recommended for a quick bite!

This eatery has is a newly opened one. Situated just a stone's throw away from my place, this small, road-side eatery is quite a surprise when it comes to the food quality and the pocket-friendly menu which it offers. Have tried their chicken sandwich, and I must say, that it is an absolute treat at just Rs. 35. The sandwich was yummy, and the taste was at par with many expensive eateries around town. I would definitely recommend this place, for a quick-bite or take-away.
