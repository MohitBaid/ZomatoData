Situated at the zing of hatibagan it has a mughlai cuisine typically favoured  by Bengali's  in north kolkata.. I ordered for mughlai parantha and chilly chicken which has a typical bengali flavour of being sugary spicy  . The place run's  packed as the food quality  is good and reasonable.The ambience is not good and a place looks uncleaned and walls are never repaired, but who cares when we get value for money food.

Visit this place on a hungry evening...due to our late visit most of the snacks items were unavailable....
So we had to order 1 plate of chilly chicken boneless and 5 paratha....

Order comes after 10 minutes....

Food: food was tasty....1 plate of chilly chicken has 8 boneless pieces....paratha was lil bit oily....Chilly chicken costs 100 per plate and paratha rs 7 per piece....

Management : management was good and they serves food ASAP....reasonable price....tax free....

This is a very old eatery located near hatibagan. Mainly famous for cutlet, fry and kabiraji. But other dishes like chowmin, rice etc are also very good. Price is reasonable and quantity is sufficient. As it has a very old look/decor many people avoid this eatery, they are nothing but neglecting a hidden gem on the heart of city.

Located hatibagan crossing towards sovabazer.

You can say this place is like heritage food joint.

The cult classic kabiraji 
Chicken cutlet
Moglai parota
 
From my childhood till date once in month I need to visit over here for snacks or over dinner parcel 

They do sell moderate Chinese item my fav chicken fried rice.

I would say visit once it won't cost you much 
Max 200 for 2 

Given 3 only because for low maintenance I think late they painted 10 years ago .
And tables and chairs seeing those from my frist vist.

Hey foodies... If u want a budget hotel, for value worth foods, just come to here. It's on the 4 point crossing of hatibagan. They have good foods, prompt take away service, good quantity of foods. Only one thing I'm missing is qwality of foods are not as earlier (old foodies can say it better, than me) but till it's a good place to hang out with economical budget. Just giving my points as below :

1. I'm uploading the price menu.
2. Food quality - 3.5 / 5.
3. Food quantity - 4 / 5.
4. Ambience - 2 / 5.
5. Varity of food - 4 / 5.
6. Service - 4 / 5.@
7. Price @ food - 4.5 / 5. (1 is costlier 5 is cheaper)
8. X factor - Main point crossing at hatibagan & previous goodwill.

It's a very old eatery on the opposite to Canara Bank, Hatibagan. Very close to my place. I have been to this eatery numerous times. Few Days back on the day of Ratha Yatra my sister suddenly wanted to have dinner with some outside foods though Mom already have completed with dinner menu. No Home Delivery, No Cards. Went there and ordered 3 Moghlai Paratha and 2 Chicken Kabiraji. I have noticed the recent increase in prices. Quality remains the same. Moghlai Paratha was fantastic. With a layer of feelings inside along with Masala, it was really an Wow item.  
Extremely pocket friendly decent family restaurant. Kolkata is fondly remembered as a city of food lovers and it would be unfair not to mention the places which helped us gain this name. An old eatery, zero decor, slightly cushioned benches and tables, no ac, senior staffs but fabulous food - if these can turn you on, this place is a must visit for every soul who lives for food.

One of the most pocket friendly restaurants in North Kolkata. Quality has never been been compromised though it is always advised to take away your food rather than having over there. Best place for refreshments for college goers and people who hop around Hatibagan Market.

Only for one thing, I have visited this place a lot of times. That's chicken Kobiraji. They have a lot of other choices of my preference, like fish Kobiraji, mutton kobiraji, fish fry and other stuffs. Ambience is like you are stuck in old 'Calcutta' , which we usually find in old b/w movies. I'm ready to go there again and again for their kabiraji...

Must try...
1) Chicken Kobiraji
2) Fish Fry
3) Mutton Kabiraji

Malancha is form the vintage restaurants in kolkata. They always maintain their tradition in their food menu. In every year at the time of the Durga Puja, after hoping the mondops in North Kolkata. I always prefer this restaurant to give relief to my belly from hunger. Every time when i visit in this restaurant, I order my favourite dish "Afgani with Plain Paratha" most of the time. But their Fried Rice, Kosha Mangsho, and Chicken Butter Masala are also mouth melting. I really like the simplicity of this place.

Used to be one of the iconic place to have a evening snacks and adda .
The place is same with old tables,chairs and typical old unclean interior as if the owners believe in the policy "Cholche Cholbe".
I believed at least like the interior,the food will be same as before but I was disappointed in that section as well. The only thing new is the taste of the food and trust me is bad.
Uncooked Kabiraji and tasteless chicken Chow with gravy.
We had finished our food because we were dam hungry and nothing else.
Need serious change interms of food quality and taste.

Yeah! It's Fish Kabiraji my dear. If you ever eat here, fish kabiraji is what you should eat here. Although some Chinese like Chowmein and Fried Rice is also available. They also serve these dishes in half quantity, a very well known formula of old-school Bengali restaurants to cater petty customers. Good enough in tidiness and fast enough in services. One thing to note, this restaurant opens at late afternoon and closes very early at 10 and during this time they are the busiest in the town. Do not forget to try Fish Kabiraji if you are even within 2 km radius and my rating is based on those Kabirajis.

First of all this is not the roadside legendary Adi Malancha, run by the ex employees, as many think it is. This is the new one near Hatibagan crossing. Food, ambiance, service everything is pathetic. But as it is located in a prime location it remains crowded (mostly with people who come here for shopping) and people think it is a good place.

If you want good food and the fries from the famous old Malancha or Adi Malancha visit the roadside stall near Town School in Sikdar Bagan.

If you are a north kolkata lover,the old school charm of this place will definitely lure you. Opens at 6pm in the evening. Offers a wide range of menu choice starting from kabiraji, braised cutlets to mixed chowmien and biryani,kosha mangsho.  Very reasonably priced. But somewhere you can make out the reasons why this place is not as legendary as the Allen's kitchen, apanjan etc. The generous use of vanaspati (dalda) in the food rendered the delectable fares inedible after 10mins, when the initial steam is out!! Parcelling the biryani or kabirajis is not at all suggest able unless you love the feel of sticky dalda, both in your mouth and your fingers!! :-P

also after the restaurant was full,they took only 7 minutes to send all items in our table!!!!
service of the waiter was good!!!!!
It is a good place to have a mouth-watering dinner in a reasonable price.
I would have given it a 5 star, if the restaurant and also the table clothes were clean and tidy.

My father brought me this chicken kabiraji and fish kabiraji from the age old legendary Malancha.
I am hoping this is the right place I am writing the review for.
The chicken kabiraji needed to be reheated when I recieved it. Most kabirajis go saggy when you reheat it in the microwave oven later, but this one did not. It was still quite crispy. And the moment I dug into it, I got this beautiful soft chicken which was well spiced and was so good. It was big enough for a whole meal for me. Same for the fish Kabiraji. Nice white flaky fish coated generously with spices and egg. Yum! Their salad was fresh too. Overall, thumbs up for serving great food!

With places like Malancha Kolkata is still carrying on its legacy of old style restaurants.
Specially with its old school ambiance and decor this place has not changed its food presentation as well.

If you are here you should definitely try their Kabiraji for sure. Still have the authentic essence of the dish and the Cutlets as well.
They have options in Chinese cuisine as well which has the classic Calcutta Chinese taste which is still very popular to our palate. Foodies should visit them once atleast.

Why you guys so tired of renovating the place as per customer comfort? I understand you want to keep the heritage look, but that can be obtained by removating aswell, there are examples. If you increase your food price by even 20 to 25%, then also I think it will be in highest demand like now.

One of the age old shops known for serving delicious snacks. If you speak about Kabiraji and Cutlets, Maloncho is one name which should definitely come up! This particular outlet is located just a steps from Hatibagan towards Hari Ghosh Street. A bit shabby with bad hygiene, people usually flock here for their cheap-dirt prices. However, if you compare this to Adi-Maloncho, I would prefer the latter. Rumour goes, that due to a split between the owners and the wokers, a couple of workers established a separate outlet for them opposite to Town School which has not shifted a bit aside inside the lane opposite to Town School. I have tried Kabirajis, Cutlets and fries from both these places but my vote would go to Adi-Maloncho.

It is a very old restaurant situated amidst the hustle and bustle of Hatibagan shopping area. It is very easy to locate. It's clean. 
As you enter on your left is the menu board. They do not have menu cards. I had heard they are famous for their Kabirajis so ordered that. 
It was served with salad and kasundi. It had a crunchy top layer and inside was lightly spicy. Overall it tasted nice. 
But the cutlets were not good. Did not like it at all.

Do not go by the ambience, because this eatery is housefull every evening since the time it has been in service i think. Price is foody-friendly. :) quantity is ample compared to the price. And the location of the joint is just... mamma mia!! Just near hatibagan, you can hop in after the humongous amount of shopping you have done has taken a toll on your stomach.

LOACATION AND DESCRIPTION: Just Near the Hatigaban crossing 1 minute walk way towards shovabazar Metro. I have been at this place three times but wasn't aware of its presence in Zomato. Looks like a 50 years old place but the food offered here just a classic one. Its hard to believe that many of them actually don't have about this place even me few days back. Here you will find the Taste of Kolkata itself.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance is like that your still in the 1980s when you dine in. Wooden Tables and chairs. Old walls and old paints with very ordinary looks and lighting. place is somehow clean but always filled with people. Staff are polite but stay very busy as customers comes in every 5 minutes.

FOOD: Been there for the third time so i have some plans in my mind, Tasted some items before so this time included few more.
Orders were Chicken Clear soup, Chicken Kabiraji, Chicken Fried Rice with Chilly Chicken.

Chicken Clear soup was just very good. Thou not a very renowned place but the soup really gave me some confidence. Taste was perfect and smell was even better.

Chicken Kabiraji was also quite a satisfactory for me. They are better known for their Kabirajis. It was soft, cooked well, Tasty as well as breaking so easily. Chicken quantity was quite good.

Chicken Fried rice has been a better choice always here. They really make some very good rice in such a good price. Rice was tasty, chicken quantity was good and quality satisfied me for sure.

Chilly Chicken here is below average, Thou they make it well but it can get better i think. Peices were average. And the DISAPPOINTING PART was : when i took one piece of chicken out there a rubber band inside the garvy which i found out, It was really pathetic indeed that they are so careless about this things. the 0.5 i have deducted just for this.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food is average but still they make the dishes very tasty. Quantity is good. Prices are very very pocket frendly. 300 is enough for two people to have a tummyfull.

CONCLUSION: A very pocket friendly place with some good options. The best part is they don't charge Vat or Service tax. RECOMMENDED

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

The chicken kabiraji and cutlets are amazing. I don't mind the oil because hello you are binging, not maintaining health right. Chops are awesome. Great for a quick evening snacky on the go.

Without any doubt this place dishes out the best Kabirajis in Kolkata. Once in a while it is ok to forget about those calories & visit this joint to gorge on Kabirajis, Cutlets, Fish Fries, etc. It's hard to keep yourself content with only one plate. Awesome place & kudos to the people running this place after the management closed down the original shop.

Been there, done that.! 
Undoubtedly one of the old bird which is still flying quiet well. Situated on the Hatibagan crossing. Serves all the so called 'telebhaja' starting from different cutlets to kabiraji to chops. On the other hand serves sme chinese dishes like chowmein nd chilly chicken. Serves Biryani nd chaap as well and few more.
Went there with my best pal to have their kabiraji which i really love and as expected i  was not at all disappointed as it ws really yumm!! 
An old Calcutta feel offcourse one will get there.
Not for the health concious ones. :)

There is a saying in kolkata for famous food outlets like Paramount's Sharbaat, Putiram's white Dahi,Chittaranjan's Rabri,Mitra Cafe's Brain chop etc. Similarly it holds true for Malancha's kabiraji. Visited this place years back during my childhood but even today their kabiraji tastes awesome. Went there with my friends, ordered fish kabiraji for each one of us. It was really good.
Rating it 3.5 initially because I want to try out few more dishes before I go for a higher rating.
People who want to try out traditional food outlets in kolkata then one should definitely visit this place and must try out kabiraji.
Do not expect a modern day cafe type ambience. Its a place which depicts the old kolkata decor- bench and table seating arrangements,fan running on top of your head,food served in white ceramic dishes.

An old tradition of ADDA along with food that almost all Bengali's cultivate in themselves is what this restaurant provides. the food is quite cheap and to its standard its more you get than you pay. Good place for small hangout or get together or snack bites. You will feel the north Calcuttan feeling here.

It is an old and busy restaurant in hatinagan area, very conveniently located. The restaurant is not very clean but it is ok for snacks or dinners with friends on a tight budget. I would not prefer this for couples and families due to the environment. However the food is tasty 😋 though not healthy that much. I took chicken biriyani for 85 /- and the quantity seems to be really good though the chicken is not washed and cooked properly. But it is definitely better from the numerous roadside food stalls offering biriyani in different parts of Kolkata. One can also order there kabiraji, parota and mutton...which seemed to me very famous with the local people.

This place is a decent place to have dinner with friends after a movie at star. This place serves fairly priced food items of good quantity. The quality of the food is at par with the food.

This is one of those traditional eateries of North Calcutta where men after their days work come and gossip hours and on with a cup of hot tea and cutlet or kabiraji. Personally speaking, the quality has deteriorated over the years. The price though surprisingly remains cheap(which can be a reason for the degrading quality). What I love is their kabiraaji and mutton cutlet. These delicacies are still the best there.

Very old restaurant and the price is very reasonable. It is one of my frequently visited eating house. Tasted more or less all the items. Now, hygiene is a big issue here but can be overlooked when you're savouring their Kobiraji or cutlets. But I think Mutton Do piaza is their best item. Have it with roti or paratha (Do not dare to order any rice item).

Malancha.... I grew up hearing the name for last 30 years... Badalkaku (owner) used to visit our house and it was some sort of family restaurant type... On any occasions they used to provide food... What else... Chicken kabiraji, Chicken cutlet, fish fry, mughlai porotha, fried rice, chilly chicken are their traditionally best. But of course you have to forget about cholesterol gas and acidity coz these foods are deep fried and mostly cooked with dalda... But occasionally it does not harm... All the best and thanks for the journey down the memory lane...

When there was no dominos, kfc,woh momo etc., evening snacks for any bengali would he mutton chop,cutlet,fish fry,kabiraji. And Malancha as it is commonly known was one of the famous hangout zone in the Hatibagan area. The Kabiraji cutlet and fish fingers are quite good. But with time,quality has detioriated. However, if there is not much in ur pocket to have pizza,fried chicken then this is a good option to try out.

Malancha is another age old and extremely popular eatery in the hatibagan area..They were known for serving hot and tasty nibbles and quick bites for decades..However, this particular place fails to live up to the expectations and their o;d reputation..It is better to opt for the take away stall operated by former cooks of Malancha which is located just opposite to Town School..This place is a bit stuffy,lacks a proper exhaust facility..and also their food lacks the flavours they once used to serve..Still my personal recommendation would be to try their Kabiraji and Breast Cutlet which are quite decent and tasteful..

I was introduced to this place by my grandfather. We usually bring chicken cutlets or prawn kabirajis in the evening and have it together. I don't think the taste changed. From the time I develoed my taste buds I've been eating here. I've also had Biriyani here but that wasn't too tasty. So I stick to what I was introduced to. 

This is just not a posh place but the old room with the old man sitting at the cash counter gives that old north calcuttan homely feeling. The prices are low and it is definitely a good place to go. 

Be there!

This is the place I had been going for almost 15 years or probably more.

Last time I went there I had a bad experience. Though the eatery is not famous for its ambience like a star restaurant but it is known for its delicacy in bengali cusine including fast food. However it failed to match its own standard that it had probably 5 or 10 years back.

We ordered Fish fry and Fish kobiraji but both the fish were not of very good quality and did not taste good as well. On another visit the mutton I tasted there was not as expected. Way too hot and nothing special about the taste.

I think its a high time for them to make some changes and bring the old taste back, otherwise its not possible to run a cabin at the heart of the city, with some mediocre tasting menu items merged with sub standard quality raw stock as ingredients.

Well. Located in Hatibagan, a small and old room type with minimal or no decor. This is not much of a hyped place but decent.

Wanted to have Moghlai Paratha for quite some time and this is the place i was asked to visit, rather taken. Ordered Moghlai Paratha, Mutton Kasha and Fish Kabiraji and Fish fry. We were two.

The Mughlai was not the best I had but fsir enough, large, crispy and stuffed. With little mutton as well. The Mutton Kasha was nothing two spicy like I always prefer but like a light, home made dish which was actually nice. They give 4 pieces in one plate and decent amount of gravy too. Overall a fair meal.

Coming to the Fish items. Both the Kabiraji and Fry were nice. Medium amount of fish and well made. The Kabiraji was big and well made. Just 55. So well for the amount but again. May not be the best. But fair enough. 

This place is nothing to good but not bad either. One shouldn't just judge by the decor or ambience because it's almost a 0 but comapring the price and quality, it's good for a quick bite. They serve at a good speed as well and people are nice as well.

In short. A fair experience. If you love Moghlai, try it out. The options are limited and this doesn't let you down at least.

Fish Kabiraji..you bet ..the delicious, the soft inlet of fish marinated with a delicious and in my opinion the best stuffing for a kabiraji ,coated with crunchy out of the world tasty fried portion..this surely is THE PLACE for a kabiraji but of course its not to be eaten often as kabirajis are oily nevertheless it is an addictive piece of food that makes you visit here,the Moghlai is also good,but you should end up spending your money which of course is not high at all,on the kabiraji ..the people are courteous ,helpful..and you get a feel of Kolkata precisely while eating at their very old den..

I do not remember how many times i have visited to this place. It was introduced to me by my parents. Its a old eatery on the opposite foot of star theatres, hatibagan. The timings given here in zomato is not correct as they open from 6pm. 
Ambience- nominal. People dont come here to get a posh feeling.
Food- their chicken kabiraji, prawn kabiraji is very good though they r a bit oily. Even i liked their mixed gravy chow. I do not like their soup. 
Price- pocket friendly.

Even the waiters knew us by face .. B they are really well behaved...

He mutton korma .... With four pieces with roti was my typical choice ...
Normal average ambience ... Average quality food wid good taste to enrich ur taste buds .... If u want in a pocket friendly manner ... U can opt for this.... :)

Visited the restaurant again today (21/02/15) with baba-n-maa, might b after an decade ... But the same old bushy ambience... Only the ppl there grew quite older... With their same old hospitality...
The fish kabiraji has bcom smaller in size with growing price... Cant help with the current inflation !

Though it is very small and clumsy and suffocating but food quality is good and price is very cheap.

Its a very old place and was very crowded when i decided to step inside on the night of dhanteras.
First things first,the menu in zomato is incorrect. In fact,they have no such menu card...only a board where items are written. Even then,everything was not available. I had come for dinner,but quickly ditched the plan and opted for snacks.
Had to stand awhile and it is then that you are expected to decide what to order,as the board isn't visible from the sitting area.
I ordered a fish kaviraji and a chicken cutlet. Food was good...the kaviraji one of the better ones i've tasted.
The two cost me 95 bucks...so i guess it is cheap.
Overall,a bittersweet experience as everything except the food went wrong.

Kolkata is fondly remembered as a city of food lovers and it would be unfair not to mention the places which helped us gain this name.
An old eatery ,zero decor,slightly cushioned benches and tables,no ac,senior staffs but fabulous fish fries,mughlai parantha,cutlets and kabirajis -if these can turn you on,this place is a must visit for every soul who lives for food.Biriyani ,chowmin and other such local favourites are also available
Visited the place yesterday again to relive those delicacies and came out utterly satisfied!!yummmm...

It's for local restaurants like these, foodies like us feel alive and kicking. This place is old. Not just by its appearance, but also for the old man in cash counter, the veteran waiters, and the big old wooden menu board right at the entrance. Over the years a lot has changed in this city, but this place looks exactly the same it was when I was a kid. They still don't have a menu card. If you ask for it, the waiters are kind enough to name all the special dishes available. If you can't follow, the wooden board is there.

First and foremost, the bright sides:
a) Dirt cheap. You won't believe your eyes.
b) Decent quality food. Tasty and tummy safe.
c) Most of the dishes are available all the time.
d) A feel of the vintage Kolkata.
e) The waiters are old, experienced, nice, polite and SMILE! So 5 out of 5 for them.

And the dark sides:
a) After meal, don't ask them for soft drinks. Even though you will see two big refrigerators in front, but they don't sell soft drinks for some unknown reason.
b) Go for a seat near the door. The deeper you go, the more you sweat.

The positives outweigh the negatives. It may not be a legend, but it's a steady middle order batsman who refuses to leave the crease.

It is nothing but a sheer nostalgia to me. it is an age old heritage of kolkata. The kabirajis still remain unbeaten. I think one of the cheapest and best old-kolkata joints in north kolkata. It remains old enough since the time immemorial. The joint is a bit uncomfortable with no air conditioning available and the hot air of the kitchen coming to invade the seating space. The fish kabiraji and the fish fry is simply out of the world. The breast cutlet is simply delicious.  a must visit..what I also love is their lachchha paratha and mutton kassa. Lucky if you get hold of their pudding as it is a rare affair. It tastes amazing. ..best to visit during the monsoons.. yet it is a must visit.

i am almost a regular visitor of this place. its a small, shabby old place. I have heard of it since childhood from my grandparents. the stories of their going in this restuarant (at that time they used to call it 'restuarant', now we just call it eatery or cabin) when they were in college. so you can assume how old this place is. this place is very near to my staying place and my evening food gets ordered from this place almost regularly. I have tasted all of their items. and believe me the taste is quite good compared to their cheap price-chart. chicken biryani is just rs. 75 nowadays, and mutton biryani rs. 80. mixed chowmein and rice both rs. 75 each. and they serve enough quantity for 2 people as evening food. and yes, they have the facility of serving 'half plate' chowmein (rice and chilly chicken, chilly paneer and chilly fish items also). 2 half plates serving is enough for 3 people. they also serve chicken chap, curry, do-peyaza and also mutton dishes, chinese items (chilly chicken), moghlai paratha. food on their menu card is limited but what they serve tastes pretty good. plus price is also too cheap.
its a non-a.c. place and sometimes uncomfortable in summer. so i always prefer take-away. the staffs are smiling and well-behaved. service doesn't take that long. and a point to mention the place only opens after 5.30pm and not before that. sometimes their food gets finished before 9.30. so if you plan to dine-in or take-away for dinner i will suggest you to go well before 9pm.
Their kabiraji is very famous.
