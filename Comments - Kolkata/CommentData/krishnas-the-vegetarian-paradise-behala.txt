This place is take away only. Have ordered couple of items via Swiggy and experience has been mediocre. Also they charge a lot for packing.!! They need to improve quality and increase quantity.

Items tried in past few days:

Aalo Paratha - nicely cooked but one parantha had no aalo !!

Pav Bhaji - Small quantity of bhaji with lot of oil floating on top, taste was good. Pav were fine.

Krishna's Special Thali - it was ok ok. Definitely not worth the price

Simple yet good food. Excellent for vegetarians and non vegetarians who want to take a change of taste. The Krishna Special Thali is good try.

Swiggy order. Food is not great, but it's not bad either. I ordered a Chole Bhatoore and it was fine. Came with lemon slices and green chilly. Nice packaging. Prices are not ordinary, so they need to keep up their quality and quantity if they have to stay in good business.
