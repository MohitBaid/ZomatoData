This place is in Bijoygarh near the pallyshree auto stand. Have tried the mughlai parantha here. It's really big and oily. I couldn't even have half of it. Other items like rice,fish, fried potato etc are okay. The place is not that hygenic.

This is a small place at the Pallisree junction. It was renowned for it's food quality and service a few years ago. But unfortunately both has gone down terribly. But Tanjore still has it's catering business going strong.

Tanjore actually save me daily.see actually you would probably know that it is famous for mughlai .radha ballavi, rolls ..but the special thing about Tanjore is there lunch.. It's really cheap.. From 12.30 pm lunch is generally available UpTo 3 pm. Fish thali is really good one with jumbo size fish... Thank you Tanjore.

The worst food joint!!! I once had a chilly chicken will tasted like shit. Â Its near to were I live. Their rolls are awful. Food is mediocre. They charge Rs 20 for a paratha. It's ridiculous. Even food joints like Bedwin charges less. I wanted to give 0 rating. But unfortunately its not an option.

Mostly famous for their delicious Moghlai though they offer other snacks too..I have been coming here since childhood...this is the place where I learnt how to eat with fork and knife. Everything they offer is mouth-watering and delicious...from Moghlai to Rolls. They cater to weddings too (My parents' wedding reception was catered by them). In all these years, their quality has got better. They have renovated too. It still remains my favourite haunt when it comes to Moghlais.

Its in between baghajatin and ranikuthi. At the pallyshree more.
This was previously a take away unit entirely. Now there is proper sitting arrangement in the 1st floor. Nd non ac sitting arrangement in the ground floor.
The dinning items here are normal. Nothing that good. It's not bad also. U can trust upon the chili chicken, fried rice, noodles.
The best items here r definitely the Moghlai dishes!! It's been my favourite since childhood. The vegetable chop is best ever found. Huge in size nd unique in taste!!
It's also good for rolls.
It's a trustworthy restaurant of the locality. If u r hungry around this area u can definitely visit here.

This place was renowned for its yummy pocket friendly fast food. But now a days, the quality has gone down very much. The food is often stale and the service is really poor. I don't like this place very much these days.

The name sounds nice, but the place has nothing to so with Tanjore food nor Tanjore paintings ;) its just an average place for a quickie meal. Small time restaurant frequented mainly by students around.

This place had great to grab a good pocket friendly meal. But in the past six months the quality has deteriorated majorly. 
Yes, it had been a good place to eat out but not anymore.
