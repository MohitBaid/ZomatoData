Located in the busy Dharmatala area, SOI serves some great Pan-Asian food. When you enter the place, you realise you're in someplace posh. A huge seating area with a bar on full display, adorned with posters on a South Asian theme, this place lures you in at first sight. I've visited this place a couple of times now, and have fallen in love with the food.

The only drink I've had here is the fresh lime soda and it's pretty unremarkable. The chicken tom kha though, is great. Subtle and light, it's the perfect way to start the meal. The som tam or papaya salad is fresh and punchy at the same time, and the crunch of the peanuts adds another dimension altogether. The chicken satay was good, with well cooked chicken and a very moreish peanut sauce to go along with it.

From the mains, the thai curry is excellent. Light and yet flavoursome, it tastes amazing paired with rice; it's the perfect comfort food. The pork magshah curry is yet another great dish, with a generous helping of pork chunks tossed with bell peppers in a spicy sauce that makes it better still. The Leang's fried rice is one of the best chinese rish dishes I've had yet. With its dominant flavour notes of fresh coriander and aromatic crispy garlic, it was the perfect accompaniment to the pork. However, the portion size of the rice is a bit less than expected. The dessert of lemon tart is very mediocre and best avoided.

The service is quick and servers are polite and helped us a lot in choosing the dishes. The prices, though, are definitely on the higher side. Nevertheless, the food is great and definitely warrants a visit. Do try this place out if you're in the area and craving something fancy. You'll love it.

Located with Zarang, New market area. Mainly the ratings is for the staff who served us, was welcoming and courteous. I dont remember his name but he was good to us when we had visited Teekha too. Ambience was soothing. Service was slow. Less staff to be seen. We had ordered for :

‚óè Crispy Chilli Babycorn
‚óè Machow Soupüç≤
‚óè Papaya Saladüçê
‚óè American corn N Brocoli salt pepper
‚óè Watermelon Mojito üçâ
Food was deliciousüòé. Quantity and quality both were good. Will visit soon for main course dishes.

The most eye-catching thing once you enter the restaurant is the bar which is very quirky. The ambience is awesome and so is the courtesy of the staffs. We were well attained. Pocket pinch is slightly higher than most of the restaurant in the area. We had a nice lunch the price was 1800 more or less including tax. Worth a visit.

SOI adds another dimension to Asian cuisine when it comes to taste and presentation. The restaurant presents a plethora of options in Chinese and Thai menu. I have been highly impressed with the decor and ambience of this place. 

It is located just beside the start of the Esplanade-Maidan flyover. Entrance is shared with its Indian better half,  Zarang(known for presenting Indian cuisine). Once you leave the crowds of esplanade streets and enter this, you are into a different world with less crowd,  good space between tables and a bar. 

Some of the dishes to name are the chilli pork,  Thai soups,  salad with shrimps, chilli fish and the dessert. They sometimes also run offers on special occasions where you avail a buffet for 999 ranging from a wide range of starters to dessert.

This is a classy one. Practically the same restaurant as Zaranj, beside Indian Museum. It's amazing how they have two restaurants in the same room; sort of.

Nice decor. Thai and Chinese paintings of temples and geishas. They've got the look and feel spot-on. It's a small restaurant though.

So we ordered cocktails. Red sangria, woo woo and the Hairy Buffalo and then whisky. The woo woo probably has too much cranberry juice, we almost asked the server whether there's actually any alcohol in it.

Food.
Prawn Tempura, Roasted Chilli Pork, Koong Magshah and some other dish with lamb. The food is so tasty. The pork was so good. Pieces of fat with some meat slow-cooked in a proprietary sauce. The tempura was delicious too, but covered in what I can only call aloo bhaja.

Very courteous staff too. It's a good fine dining restaurant with a reasonably priced menu. I'd revisit.

One catch : Terrible music, but you probably won't even notice.

I hardly recommended a restaurant or pub to someone but if you want a fine dining experience, buy 565 voucher from nearbuy and rush in.
This would definitely be a memorable experience.
Definitely one of the best restaurant cum bars in town

The place has an elegant decor and good ambience. Things that I liked were Master Shifu's Fish and Leangs Fried rice. The fried rice was the best I have ever had, loaded with flavours- I highly recommend it. The Wonton soup and Tom Kha Het soup was good, but nothing extraordinary. The Kaeng Kae in green curry was a disaster though. I did not like the overpowering coconut oil taste. I personally disliked it.
Apart from that, the staff was hospitable. One complaint I have though is the portion of food. It was not enough for its value.

Visited a restaurant from the bookmarked list. Though it was an unplanned one. A Christmas treat.
Starting from the ambience of the restaurant, which was too good. The restaurant was well decorated (with candle lit in every table) good for couples as well as friends. Has a wide variety of cocktail options. In this festive occasion, the waiter was quite prompt & good with his recommendations & served the food in the minimal time possible.
Will visit soon.

The Chicken Tempura was well done as well.

I loved the ambiance at first.staff was quite helpful and friendly. In appetizers we had crispy fried boneless chicken in Japanese spices , I don't remember the name exactly but it was crispy outside and juicy within, just perfectly cooked. We ordered main course as recommended by them in thai menu and loved it. It was lamb in green sauce which was mildly spicy with steamed rice. The smell was so tempting at first but then I realised the food was really yummy too.  Courteous staff too. They have a velvet parking where you need not worry about your car. They note the number of your vehicle and calls them when you reach the parking just as in any 5 star hotels, which was unique for a restaurant. Ideal for family as well as friends..... Oh yeah clean washrooms as well so girls you can easily visit without even thinking twice, cuz most of us have this issue as I do. 5/5 as I rate it.

thumbs up to the interior! it's a spacious yet cosy place, has delectable offerings on the menu from Thai n Chinese cuisines. we ordered prawn tempura, leang rice and pork magshah. pork was absolute wonder! the meat was good and so were the spices. leang rice was anyhow ordinary. although from the looks of it, prawn tempura was somehow different from my expectations, but the taste did live upto the standards. we also ordered a green apple martini and an LIT. both were pleasantly soothing. the best thing about the place was the interior and their courteous staff. although prices are a bit on the higher side, but a good fine dine experience is worth that.

We tried Galangal and Mint Old Fashioned from the special drink's menu. Also tried a Normal Old Fashioned and a Manhattan. Great tasting and well presented cocktails. A great cocktail place indeed. Food was good and definitely unique. We tried a chinese chicken dish. Forgot the name. And Pork Ribs. Awesomely juicy and tasty. Total pocket pinch was around 1800.

Went there on a sultry hot afternoon. Very easy to locate. Decor is really nice. Ample seating still not congested. Staffs were very humble, really pleasing behaviour. Now it comes to food. We got more thn we expected. In my opinion its the best place for thai cuisine in kolkata.
We ordered kai hor bai toey, chicken in black bean sauce, green thai curry (veg). Every dish shone on the plate. Cant really compare. Kai hor bai toey was very tasty and specially with the chilli sauce it danced in my mouth. And the veg thai curry was also impressive. For cocktail we ordered pina colada and daiquiri. Those were refreshing. Unfortunately most of the photos got deleted.

Location : Near Indian Museum.

Ambience : This is a bar cum restaurant with a very classy touch to it.

Food and drinks :

We tried everything Thai and I must say it's the most lipsmacking Thai I ever had!
For soup : Tom Yum. It was okay, not a big fan of soups.
For salad : Papaya Salad - The Best Papaya Salad I had. Not too spicy, not too sweet. Just the correct mix of flavors.
For Starter : Master Shifu's Fish in Sweet Thai Chili Sauce. The outside was crisp while the inside was juicy to every bit.

For Main course : Chicken in Szechuan sauce in Szechuan Fried rice, It was good. Nothing extra!

Pocket Pinch : little expensive, but worth a try!

This place is in a prime location and easily accessible by uber or walking down the busy street. I went on a weekday and the servers outnumbered the guests. Nevertheless they came with a smile on their face and when i asked for recommendations it was spoton. I ordered Koong Magshah and Leangs fried rice both complimented each other were delicious. The portion size is small, but the taste satisfies the appetite.

We ordered two coupons from Nearby of Rs. 525 and 665 which had 3 Starters (half plate serving) and one 1.5litre alcohol each.
The starters were tasty but of very low quantity. We ordered two more (full plate) starters but they too were of low quantity. 
The most shocking part of the experience and the reason I am giving a 1 star rating is due to the behaviour of the person who was taking the order. Very ill mannered! We were a group of 5 with 2 coupons (for 2 people). We told him that we will order a-la-carte but to bring the starters so that we can reorder the best one. This isn't even a buffet that we can consume more than offered. He very rudely replied that it was our good luck that he was letting 5 of us inside with a coupon for 4.
Didn't expect such a behaviour when we repeatedly told him that we are gonna order many more food and alcohol, but to start serving. Even told him on his face that this is gonna be the first and last visit,  but he didn't seem bothered. Wonder why the management keep such staff who bring down the quality of such a nice place!

I loved the chairs and the tables, well thought out. The offers they have is definitely eye catching . The two cocktails I tried were mind blowing. I suggest everyone to try everything. I personally loved the Cosmo. The wantons for starters were yum! But the one thing that I would go back again for was the pan friend chicken noddles. It was the best I have had. The service took a little bit of time but not something you would notice if you have a good company!

Perfect lighting, perfect furnitures, very well behaved and friendly staffs and a great ambience. I have not rated a whole 5 for this place- for their starters and the songs/music they play in the background. But all over they made my evening a special one. I will visit again to taste their signature dish 'kai hoe......' 
You should go for it once at least.

The place is situated just at the mouth of Sudder Street, beside Indian museum. The ambience was very classy and elegant... The bar counter had an amazing creativity to it. Coming to the food, we had booked table via the Little app...
As refreshment drink they had lime soda(sweet ,sour or mixed)... It was good..
For soup try avoiding the Tom Yum soup if you don't like sour so much but the Manchow soup was very good(Do add chicken or seafood with it if you are non-veg)...
For the startes we had crispy chilli babycorn , crackling spinach & mushroom , Master Shifu's Fish( if you are there and you don't try this then surely it's your loss) , chicken satay( Had a flavour of gondhoraj lemon and served in skewers) and a pork starter(forgot the name)... The starters were the best part of the menu..
The main course consisted of mixed hakka noodles and chicken in schezwan sauce( it was good but not extraordinary)...
For the dessert, who would not love Darshan( They served Darshan with a cube of vanilla ice-cream)...
Also do try the cocktails... We had MANHATTAN( and it was out of the world) and Ginger Twist..
And to complement the menu we had ordered a tour(2l) of draught beer...
The service was very good and there was this waiter named Mr JOY who was very courteous to us and suggested us a couple of cocktails... Looking forward to visit again...

I was planning for so long to come to this place . Heard so much about it form so many of my friends . And it was worthy of it , every bit of it . It‚Äôs situated just next to Indian Museum , when we went there yesterday afternoon , it was raining outside and we planned to visit it suddenly . The restaurant was bit of empty and the employees welcomed us with a big warm smile . We chose to sit on a corner and the first thing that caught my eyes were the wall paintings..Man ! They are awesome , depicting the Asian culture in a whole . The ambience was just to good to have . I was already beaming and when Pradip ,one of the waiter welcomed us and helped in every order , starting from the soup to the dessert . They serve an amazing cuisine . The food is just amazing here . We had a coupon from nearbuy , I‚Äôm not going into the details . The sweet and sour soup (which Pradip recommended) just apt with the weather . Hakka noodles with manchurian gravy was hot and hit . You must have Darsaan with ice-cream as a dessert . And I am not recommending any other cuisine because whatever you‚Äôll have , you‚Äôll love it . They serve the entire pan-Asian cuisine with authencity . ‚ù§Ô∏è

Finally visited this restro.. located opposite of Indian museum. We visited this restro for lunch. SOI is basically A Thai-Asian & Chinese restro. The Ambiance is quiet nice classy. The Decor is elegant. The staffs are polite, attentive & v v helpful too. We ordered Tom Yum soup(chicken) & Lemon Corriander soup(chicken). Both soups were spicy & good in taste. The Fresh Lime Soda was refreshing & sweet-spicy. Next ordered Satay kai & Master shifu's fish. Both two dishes were outstanding. Specially I loved the Master Shifu's fish in sweet Thai chilli sauce. Tasted like sweet spicy & tangy flavour. Small crispy fish was soft & well cooked. Also Satay kai tasted amazing. Strips of chicken marinated & grilled in peanut sauce. Next in Main Course we ordered Chili Garlic Noodles & Lemon Chicken. Specially I must tell the Chili Garlic Noodles(hakka) was too good. V tasty & tasted like little spicy & full of garlic flavour. Just Perfect. Also Lemon Chicken was good. In Desserts they served strawberry icecream. Overall good experience. Recommend at least one visit.

I had bookmarked this place for sometime and it was only yesterday we went for dinner. WE LOVED IT. You talk about food, ambience and service, all are top notch.
For starters we called som tum(with shrimp), magshah kai, thats a chicken preparation in a spicy thai paste and its lovely!!!! And we had Pad kra pao gai. Hairy buffalo cocktail pitcher and a water melon and basil colin were for drinks.
For main course we ordered lamb red thai curry, that comes with a portion of rice, we took another portion of rice and it sufficed all 3 of us.
My brother called for a slice of chocolate cake with a scoop of icecream for dessert.
I would say the service is amazing, as it was our first time, so we were helped to select the signature dishes and even suggested to cut down on the main course as we had so much of starters! And trust me, their suggestion was perfect for us! The red Thai lamb curry is THE best we've had till date(even better than the Bangkok restaurants) and also the Magshah kai!!
Next we visit Kolkata, we're surely going to visit this place again.

This place never turns me down. This is my third visit.  Situated right beside Indian Museum. Every Chinese food lover must visit here. Great ambience.  I went with a nearbuy voucher.  
Food was so tasty. The soup - Tom Kha Het was creamy and chicken satay- Satay Kai is a must have.  Noodles was tasty. They include a papaya salad in their nearbuy menu,  which tastes incredibly awesome.  Something that i never had before.  But unfortunately this time they said that they excluded this from the menu (but still visible in nearbuy memu) which disappointed me.  So i deducted .5 from my rating.  They have a peanut sauce which i never tasted before.  
So overall it's a must visit plsce.  And I gurantee the place would live upto your tastebuds.

SOI is situated inside Zaranj next to indian museum. we visited this restaurant on Sunday for lunch. the ambiance inside is quiet nice and opulent. the decor is simple yet elegant. coming to the food, we ordered wanton soup, hot and sour and sweet corn. each were very tasty . the starter comprised of matchstick potato which was tasteful, american corn which was little spicy but equally tasty. chilly babycorn however left us little disappointed. in the main course we were served with hakka noodles and fried rice and mixed vegetables in sweet and sour sauce . each of them were very good and appetizing. lunch was rounded off with darsan. meal for 2 would cost around 1500 including taxes.

Went here for lunch last Saturday and this place really impressed me. The interiors are beautifully done and are spacious. We ordered a starter dish called Kar hoi bai toey which was basically chicken pieces cooked on a banana leaf. We ordered some papaya salad as well. The mixed chowmein and prawn in barbecue sauce were just very flavoursome. We finally ended with a banofee pie. If you love Pan asian, this should be the place you should head over to.

It was not at all upto the mark. I saw the 4.5 rating and obviously my expectations were higher. But this resturant even in this peak puja time dont keep half of the drinks. The prices given in menu card in zomato are different from actual prices. Service is very slow. The waiters cannot even click a good poc of yours. Only the food and ambience and their song choices saved it from getting an embarrassing review.

Situated on Sudder Street, opposite the Indian Museum. This restaurant is housed inside hotel Zaranj.
The interiors boast of plush decor, and a well lit bar. The staff are polite and explain details of the Asian  dishes on offer, service is fast too.
We ordered: chicken satay, hai Bor koi toey, chicken tempura,and Master Shifu's fish in sweet chilli sauce for starters. Loved them all.
Main course consisted of schezwan rice,chilli garlic noodles with chicken in lemon sauce, and coriander chicken.
Their Cosmopolitan,Tom Collins, Classic Margarita is a must try. 
Highly recommended.

Second visit to this place and not much has changed. 
So, here goes the review of this place located right in the heart of the city, next to Indian Museum. 

Ambience- I personally love it! The music, the decor and the fact that once can enjoy the food and drinks at peace(not too many people around) is a such a relief. 

Starters- Tom Yum soup, Master Shifu's fish, Kai Hor Bai Toey and Chicken Satay, Papaya Salad.
The Tom Yum soup was better on my previous visit. This time it was average and very oily(extra butter was added, apparently). 
Master Shifu's fish is definitely the MUST HAVE starter. 
The rest two starters were okay-ish. 

Mains- Thai curry in red sauce with rice, Classic fried rice with Schezwan chicken and Chicken in Coriander sauce. The Thai curry in red sauce was amazing! Right from the presentation to the authentic Thai taste, this dish was a winner. 

Dessert- Darshan with Vanilla ice cream.

Manchow soup tasted average.
Babycorn was half cooked, not upto the mark.
Noodles were good.
Ice-cream was excellent.

The Asian restaurant SOI right opposite the Park Street Museum has turned out to be one of the city's favourite and top rated place in a short span of time. The place has got an ease and pleasant vibe upon entering, not trying too hard with the architecture but still managing to bring a classy ambiance to offer to the guests. The restaurant is moderately compact with the entire dining area and a dedicated whole bar area. Set your moods just right with the courteous staffs and good music. Good headstart!
Coming to the food section they have their happy hours everyday from 4-7 pm so I could get my favourite go to drink Cosmopolitan at a whopping 165. My friends went for their Pina Colada and Chocolate Frost. They did good work with all the drinks keeping the flavours alive with the perfect amount of chilled goodness. In the appetizers we ordered their most popular signature dishes, Tempura Chicken and Kar Hor Bai Toey. Where as the fried chicken in tempura batter was delicious I was blown away by the latter in particular. The marinated and wrapped chicken in spicy chilly sauce with an authentic lemony flavour to it was absolutely killer and the taste is bound to linger for long definitely. A special mention to the totally complementary Teriyaki and spicy chilly sauce the appetizers were served with.
In the main course we had their Classic Fried Rice, Lemon Chicken, Cantonese Pan fried noodles and Schezwan Chicken. All the items were satisfactory in both taste and quality, the noodles and the schezwan chicken could be the hands down winner in the section.
The dessert section was a bit disappointing as they were out of stock except the lemon pie & darshan with ice cream. So we went for the classic darshan in the end of a great Chinese meal. The staff here is quite warm and make a good hosting environment though given a not so crowded Saturday evening the serving time could have been better. SOI definitely needs to be explored and experienced for the foodie in you. Totally recommended.

Well, I had a couple of free hours on my hand, and I randomly opened the photo archive on my laptop named ‚ÄúFood Diaries ‚Äì Kolkata‚Äù. The hours flew by, and I salivated to my heart‚Äôs content, but it struck me how I had not found the time to review some of the most excellent places that I have had the pleasure to visit over the last few years. There‚Äôs a lot of backlog, and it keeps piling up ‚Äì but what better way to begin the process by ruminating on one of the standout experiences of last year ‚Äì SOI. I visited the restaurant when it was literally the new kid on the block, maybe a couple of months into its inception. It is the Asian twin of the Indian giant, Zaranj ‚Äì and is aptly named after the side-streets of Thailand, since it specializes in Thai cuisine, besides the ubiquitous Chinese food. The pleasant February afternoon was ripe for a foray into authentic Asian cuisine, and we walked into this fine-dining place that oozes class.

N0thing high about this Thai...

We chose the Asian food zone and wanted to taste Thai cuisine. We ordered Kai Hor Bai Toey for starter and Magshah Kai as side dish to fried rice. Unfortunately the cubes of chicken in both the dishes tasted the same - the difference being that in the first, the chicken pieces were wrapped in pandanus leaves and in the second, those same cubes were floating in a thick gravy. Even if the taste was not disappointing, the expectation of difference in taste was thwarted in the grave similarity of the dishes. Hence the capsule recipe suggested and promised in the menu wasn't fulfilled. Besides, the price tags are on the higher side perhaps because of the apparently classy ambience whereas the quantity on the plate served was on the lower side. The service and the courteousness of the staff however can be rated high.

Decor is decent but nothing exceptional, lots of scope for improvement. Very good place for Cocktails and Mocktails. The Kai hor Bai Toe, which is a chicken wrapped in Pandan leaf, was wonderful. Tempura Prawn was little bit disappointing. We also tried red curry which also good but salt was little bit higher side. This comes with rice, unfortunately it was Basmati, not the authentic sticky rice. Over all, good experience and recommend for at least one visit.

Awesome location with awesome decor. If you want to test authentic Thai and Chinese food and pocket pinch doesn't matter, please visit SOI. 
I have been there on a Thursday evening with whole family. The first thing that will make your mood is the brilliant choice of decor with soft lighting arrangement.
Coming to the food, we have ordered Manchow Soup, Kai Hor Boi Toey, Chicken Wantons, Master Shifu's Fish, Lemon Chicken, Phad Thai, Leangs Fried Rice and Sliced Lamb in Taipan Sauce. Everything tasted so good. But quantity was very less compared to high price. They should consider increasing the portion of every dish.
All of the stuffs are really polite and co-operating. I would recommend this place.

Came here with a nearbuy coupon! Either this place is completely understaffed on a Sunday evening, thus the waiter was seemingly unhappy working, or he is of such personality, or there is a differential treatment for nearbuy coupon users!

Our coupon entitled us to get either beer or LIIT. And we wanted to have LIIT. Unfortunately they didn't have Tequila or Gin. We were just offered beer or LIIT without above two ingredients, and it was done so as if a huge favour was done to us. Also, from the food menu offer, they didn't have all that was promised.

They should understand that its them who are offering in nearbuy, no one forces them to offer. A buyer is buying based on these promises, and then the promises somehow take shape of favour and not fulfilled. Extremely unsatisfied with the service!

The first time I went there, I rated it 5 stars. The second time, services had gone done horribly, and I rated it 1 star. Everything was fine again on the third visit.

Ambience is beautiful.

Scanty vegan options.

Though the menu shows a lot of dishes, most of them are not available all the time, especially tofu.

After specifically mentioning 3 times that I don't want any diary products, I once got a side dish of that's full of paneer. So I now ask about the dairy products by specifically mentioning their names.

The quality of food is good.

They first served us with a sweet lime soda, then manchow soup, papaya salad, kai hor bai toey for starters, schezwan fried rice and schezwan chicken for the main course and vanilla ice cream with darsan at the end. All were lip smacking and very tasty except the schezwan chicken that was average. The place was very airy and spacious. Got an amazing experience.

being one of the premiere restaurants in kolkata, i was really tempted to try them out. specially, a lot of good reviews were coming to me regarding their cocktails. finally, on a sunday noon, i took my wife and son for a lunch and i am glad i did that.
location is very convenient - just beside the museum. parking is available as well. so, reaching the place is quite easy.
interior is spacious and well decorated. light is a bit on the dimmer side, but during the day it's not an issue at all. tables are placed in a relaxed manner, not clumsy at all.
we started off with two cocktails - chilli mango (vodka based) and old fashioned (whiskey based) along with satay chicken and prawn tempura. the combination was good, specially the cocktails. they were unique in taste and the quantity was handsome too. only issue i saw is in the quantity of the starters. the number of pieces is 5 in each portion. that's a problem if you are a group of 2 or 3 or 4. they should consider changing the number of pieces to 6. that would suit a group of 2 or 3 easily.
coming to main course - i forgot the names of dishes we ordered :( we had one rice, which was having mixed nonveg items. rice quality was fine and the quantity of one portion could easily satisfy 2 (we were 3). we also ordered one fish and one pork side dishes, both were very good in terms of taste and quantity.
overall, the experience was very good. i will surely recommend people of kolkata to visit them, specially during the evening as they often run some good deals on food and drinks.

Location wise it's a winner. Just at the opening of sudder street, near the Indian national museum.
I loved the decor. It had a sophisticated touch. Also it was spacious. The staffs were well mannered, and welcomed us with a smile.

For starters we ordered the Satay Kai and Tempura chicken with suriyaki and teriyaki sauce.
The Satay Kai tasted amazing. It came in the form of chicken skewers. The dip was amazing. Perfect blend of peanuts, poppy seeds, coconut. It was amazing.
The tempura chicken too was a form of dragon chicken. Tasted amazing with the teriyaki sauce.

My friend found a hair in one of the Tempura chicken fries. The staff took the plate, and again served us with a fresh new platter. That was a really nice gesture towards the guests.

For the main course we had Magshah Kai and moon fan fried rice.
The menu says moon fan rice, which as expected comes in a sizzler plate. But they served us with moon fan fried rice instead. That was a big disappointment for me.
However, what really won our hearts was the Magshah Kai. It was amazing. Had cubes of chicken and mushrooms prepared in hot Thai sauce. Topped with strips of red chillies. Couldn't have been better.
We were looking for the dessert menu, but unfortunately couldn't find one.

Nevertheless, we had an amazing fine dining experience in SOI. Would be looking forward to more visits.

I called them 4 times & finally I got reservation on the last attempt. After seeing a ton of good reviews, high rating & their demand in market as last 3 days they told me restaurant was booked due to business parties, my expectations were touching the sky.

I visited this place at rare time, 5'o clock in the evening & found the restaurant compleatly empty except a single table was booked by young people enjoying their drinks. The ambience was likely but random. Random posters on wall, bar counter on van, high sits & dim lights wasn't matching all together but was unique & felt good.

Their service was dramatically slow keeping in mind the restaurant was empty at that time. The whole dining experience took almost 2 hours & left us in disappointment. The whole time we spent looking at the bottle of Jack Daniels kept on their charming bar counter just straight from our table. We started with the following...

Fresh Lime Soda (3/5): Unlike other places their Fresh Lime Soda was very dark. Dark in the sense it was excessive thick of lemons. It tasted totally different & was served differently in huge glass. Overall liked it.

Tom Yum Chicken Soup (0/5): By going through some of the reviews I found this is one of the best soup they offer, so I ordered the same. It came in a small bowl half filled, like hot boiled water mixed with lots of spices & chilli power with some mushrooms & chicken pieces. It tasted extreamly hot & spicy with excessive flavour of lemon grass. It was compleatly disaster on the name of soup.

Now coming to the Starters we ordered their most popular 3 items.

Chicken Satay (2/5): Chicken on a stick served like Malai Kulfi on banana leaf. This dish definitely looked unique but taste wise it was average. Chicken was bit sticky with mild spices.

Kai Hor Bai Toe (2/5): Another very unique dish, small chicken pieces wrapped on banana leaf with very mild sauce. The way it was served like paan that looked pretty amazing. But it didn't tasted like other reviews says rather it was dull.

Master Shifu's Fish in Sweet Thai Chilli Sauce (4/5): This one is the top most popular dish over here & the only dish I liked. Just like every other dish it was also well served on banana leaf. Small crispy fish in rich sweet, tangy & chilli sauce was very well balanced & tasted extreamly good with the mixed red & yellow bell peppers. A must try if you visit this place after reading this review by mistake.

In mains our selection was very straight & basic.

Hakka Noodles (2.5/5): Noodles were thin & looked delicious. It tasted somehow good with very lite spices & vegitables. Aware to the fact it was on deal we got 75% of the quantity of full plate. Even though the quantity was extremely low for a single person.

Szechuan Fried Rice (1/5): Another disaster was their fried rice. It tasted very bad with random spices & didn't went well with any of the chicken side dish.

Chicken in 3 different sauces (1/5): We took each of one with Coriander, Szechuan & Lemon. Where lemon is the most popular according to the reviews on Zomato. So we started with lemon chicken where chicken pieces were very small that also was coated in cornflower. Gravy was thick & mixed with sliced carrot & lemon grass. However flavour of lemon was overwhelming & hiding the taste of chicken making it bitter to taste after few spoons. Where Schezwan should have been hot & spicy but the dark flavour of lemon was present over here too. Just the gravy was thin & red but it wasn't schewan sauce for sure. On the other hand coriander chicken was absolutely disgusting, the color & flavour of coriander was excessive & made it bitter in taste.

Last but not the least.

Ice Cream with Darsaan (4/5): Simple vanilla ice cream with darsaan, nothing remarkable. Felt nice at last.

Thanks to Little App I got this as a deal for a very low price. Otherwise I would've wasted a lot of money just by following their high rating. Talking about the rating I've no idea how the achieved this but they don't deserve it in any way.

I went for Lunch with my friends on Sunday.¬†

The ambience is classy.

This is one of the posh restaurants of the New Market area, I think.

We had 

1. Soda lime and Cosmopolitan (mocktail) : Both of these were good.

2. Soups ( Tom Yum, Tom Kha Het and Manchow soup ) : All were good.

3. Master Shifu's Fish ( Bhetki with Thai sauce) : Too tasty.

4. Satay Kai (Chicken) : So Appetizing... was really awesome. <3
¬†
5. Hakka Noodles was average.

6. Chicken side dishes (Lemon chicken and Schezwan  chicken) : Schezwan was okayish...but that ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Lemon chicken was very tasty.

7. Desserts : Vanilla ice-cream,with Darshan tasted good though.

Enjoyed the food.

Extremely courteous Staffs.

This is one my favourite places because of a lot of reasons - it is very close to my house, It has the best happy hour offers that I have come across and the staff are very friendly. A great place to spend time with family and friends.

My first visit to this place was on 24th June 2017, my birthday eve. We went around 4pm and thought of giving their Happy Hours a try. So, we ordered the following:

COCKTAILS

1. Cosmopolitan - best one I have had so far.
2. Mango Julep - suggested by the server. It seems it's one of their specialities. It has a very interesting and unique combination of chillies and mango. The chilli wasn't overpowering at all.
3. Pink Lady - this was a special drink made by the bartender, Sanjay, just for me. It's not on the menu. It's on the sweeter side and the prettiest one of all.
4. French Whisky Sour: I am not a fan of whisky so my fianc√© tried it out. He isn't a cocktail person but he has become a fan of this one. This is the only drink he goes for whenever we visit SOI!
5. Mint Julep: again, my fianc√© tried it out. It was refreshing.

APPETISERS:

1. Satay Kai - peanut butter based chicken in sticks. It's such a yummy balanced dish.
2. Chicken Tempura - so crispy and my favourite appetiser!
3. Chicken wantons (boiled) - so soft and delicious.
4. Pan seared chilli prawns - good.
5. Master Shifu's Fish - absolutely delicious. A must try one.

We loved the place so much that we revisited it within a week and my experimenting with the cocktails continued. We ordered the following :

COCKTAILS

1. Apple Pear Martini - refreshing
2. Sweet Pine Caramel - it tasted like an ice-cream. A tad too sweet but anyone having a sweet tooth will love it
3. Cosmopolitan - I had to order it. It's my favourite cocktail and I love the one that they offer.
4. Whisky Sour

MAIN COURSE: (this is not included in Happy Hours)
1. Chicken Khao Suey : amazing Thai dish. Very filling. It is served with steamed rice.
2. Prawn in Oyster Sauce : loved it! It was delicious.

On the third visit, we just had drinks because we went over there after having a heavy lunch. We ordered the following :
1. Peanut Butter Cup (not included in Happy Hours) - if you love desserts, you're gonna love this.
2. Caprioska : very refreshing but I have never been a fan of this cocktail as it just tastes just like Virgin Mojito so it was okay. They offer this one in pitchers too.
3. Cosmopolitan
4. Beer (not included in Happy Hours)
5. Whisky Sour

Ambiance : classy, beautiful decor, cozy.

Staff : very courteous, very friendly, they create a very homely atmosphere for you, just ask them if you are unsure about anything. They know their menu well. Special mention : the bartender, Sanjay. A very friendly person and he does his job pretty well. If you are unsure about your drink, just ask for him, he will come to your table and help you out with it. And he prepares such pretty cocktails! :D

Overall: I am in love with this place. They don't compromise on the quality of food and drinks offered even in their Happy Hours. Amazing food, an amazing collection of cocktails to choose from. It's one of my favourite hangouts. If we are indecisive about where to go, my fianc√© or I just say let's go to SOI.

Pros - Nice ambience, great food, family perfect, valet service
Cons - Compared to price quantity is less, some flies came in from nowhere- should install a fly catcher, time to serve should be reduced, although there were many items in the menu not everything was available though we dropped in a sunday afternoon, to match the ambience music should be soft jazz or likewise instead of loud beats.

Finger licking good food.period.was really not expecting such good food,when we entered the place,almost empty on a weeknight.

The tom kha het,which can be termed as soul food after a working day,was the perfect beginning.master shifus fish and the matchstick prawn were awesome as well.dont opt for the prawn if you don't want deep fried stuff though.

The leangs fried rice and the magasa chicken in main course was again,perfect,especially the gravy of the chicken.I literally licked the bowl clean.the couple of vodka based cocktails we ordered were again,perfect in taste and presentation.service was prompt and with a smile.

The only reason am deducting 0.5 is because i would have loved a bit more quantity for that price perfect in all other aspects.

Hello there folks! This place is honestly the first place I have come across in this city to which I would love to give 5+ ratings for every aspect.  
Being an architect, the first thing I notice is the interiors of course and soi has amazing traditional themed interiors fused with contemporary break out spaces.
The place is very spacious with no waiting time. 
Servers are very friendly. 
Now let's come to the food part 
We bought coupons from nearbuy in which we got 4 veg and non veg starters with 2 pitchers of beer for only 599
Other than that we ordered master Sifu's prawn tossed in Thai chilli with a cocktail called caprioska which was amazing. 
Find the snaps below!

Located at the corner of Sudder St, a fancy and spacious restaurant. Loved the secluded feel of the place. Since we were just two people, we ordered just Tempura Prawns and a pork green curry. The staff were friendly and gave ample suggestions about the food. The prawns were delicious. The green curry was light and was served with rice. The gravy was yummy. Looking forward to dine here soon.

First impression of the place, nice decor and comfortable seating with very courteous staff. We ordered chicken satay, fish in shifu's sauce, chicken in banana leaves, noodles, fried rice, schezwan chicken, coriander chicken and chicken in lemon sauce. Good were really good, especially the Fish in Shifu's sauce is a must try. This place excels in cocktails. We had tom Colin's, green apple martini, sangria, Manhattan, Mai Tai, scotch Ricky. All were great. Highly recommend the place for their cocktails. The place is a price for the items. All over a very nice experience.

Did you hear of a place which provides a classy ambience, excellent service and lip-smacking food altogether?
The answer to this is : SOI.

Yes, you heard me right!
Located in Sudder Street area, this Asian restaurant is an absolute topnotch. Each and every dish tasted good especially the dessert item, which deserves a special mention.. the lime cheesecake.

To sum up, SOI is perfect for a romantic cozy date and deserves full 5 rating!
Till then, happy hogging :D

Decor was simple amd beautiful. Songs were playing so a big thumbs up for the ambience.

The food was delicious. Schezwan Noodles was my favourite. In the appetizers I loved the Chicken Satay.

This place is a bit expensive.

Staff was prompt and courteous.

See. The two things you expect highly from a proper restaurant are its ambiance and the quality of food. Both....awesome. Period.
I mean I have been to places with exotic plates on the menu before. But SOI has blended those with a great soft ambience and very good behaviour from the staff!
I visited with my partner and we had Kaeng Kae, Magshah Kai and Tempura Prawns in Sukiyaki and Teriyaki sauce alongwith a Vodka Caprioska, A Long island iced tea, A Screw Driver and a Regular Jim bean. 
Perfect combination I tell you. The prawns were a delight and so was the chicken in both the other dishes. And it was pretty filling as well. 
The price is a little too steep. Around 3K for two. However, I felt it was worth the feel. 
So, thank you SOI. And people....please do visit!

We had lunch offers from Nearbuy. We had
* Tom yum soup
*Hot and sour soup
* Chicken wanton soup
Tom yum was the best!
In starters we had 
* Master shifu's fish in thai chilli sauce : normal chinese bhekti preparation but really tasty
* Kae har boe tai : Chicken wrapped in banana leaves made in coconut sauce, nice but would have liked more of that coconut gravy
In the staple we had fried rice and noodles none mention worthy
In mains we had Lemon Coriander and Schwezwan chicken,Lemon being the better one. Main course took too much time to prepare
In desserts we had Vanilla ice cream with Darsaan.
Since it was 275 per head,it dint burn a hole,without coupons it would have.
Ambience is wonderful.

First visit and a memorable one. Excellent food. Nice ambience and a restaurant that is sure to be among the best ones in Kolkata if they can keep up with the quality.

Must haves : kal hot bai toey: a spicy flavourful preparation of chicken wrapped in banana leaf.

Prawn tempura: A modern twist to the dish having much less oil and crisps over the prawn . Had best with the sweet chilli.

Hot and sour soup: Top class and as authentic as it can get 

Magsah chicken: A spicy thai preparation of chicken with lot of veggies in red curry . Slurp!!!

Surprisingly could not find any desert section in the menu. But the food was top class.

Located beside the Indian Museum in Chowringhee Road, SOI is one of the new entrants in the city. The decor is splendid, with two well stocked bars, one inside a truck and another in a plush wooden setting. Their Moon Fan Rice is amazing and they have some mean deals in their happy hours.

The tempura fried chicken is definitely the showstopper, the chicken version of Fish kabiraji. The pork items were also delicious. Pitcher @325 is real cheap.No complaints would be visiting soon.

For ambience: 5star. The staffs were at their best.FOOD:
1. Lime Soda: Nothing extra-ordinary. The flavour was too strong initially. But with time it balanced out.
2. Papaya Salad: BEST!! Very innovative.
3. Tom Yum Soup: One of the best soups I have ever had. The ingredients were perfectly balanced.
4. Kai Hor Bai Toey: Well, this is a must try if you visit SOI. The chicken pieces were perfectly marinated and cooked. This dish gave a slight flavour of coconut, perhaps it is cooked in coconut milk. The Thai Chilli sauce was tangy.
5. Hakka Noodles: Good one. All the vegetables were fresh, nicely cooked.
6. Lemon Chicken: The pieces were soft and the flavour of Lemon was in right proportion.
7. Ice-creams: I don't know what was the topping, but the combination was awesome.
GOOD JOB.

Ambience wise it's a perfect mix of casual and fine dining. I loved the food truck shaped bar counter. The staff were very friendly serving with a smile on their face which made the dining experience a notch better. Coming to food in one word yummy. The Kai Hor Bai Toey was delicious , melting in the mouth and the flavours were a perfect dance in the mouth. This dish is a must try for everyone visiting SOI. 
I am going to be bak soon with friends and family to enjoy the wide selection of food left on the menu.

No way I could scrap even 0.5 for this asian delight which made our #Music_day so full of symphony!!!

The names were exotic and so were the food!!!

From the authentic spices to its subtle garnishing... every part just melted our hearts...

So, we started with Tempura Chicken with Sukiyaki and Teriyaki Sauce... A better version of KFC but mind you, the sweet n tangy sauce may left you startled!!!

Next came, Kai Hor Bae Toey... Steamed chicken wrapped in leaves with Thai chilli paste... Ooompphhh it was.. we did gulp the chillies even eyes were watering... A must try here!!!

Then, we ordered traditional Thai Magshah lamb... It resembled to a Firecracker chicken to some extent... But, now it was time for the best of the day, Gaeng Kua Kai... Chicken and Cashewnut stir fried in sweet basil and another authentic Thai Gaeng Kua paste... It was like Thailand here I come!!!

We wrapped up with Leang Fried Rice and Chef special Fish... Again the uniqueness in the greenish tinge and the flavour of the rice left all us boggled!!

A slice of Thailand in the heart of the city!

A beautiful restaurant, that we visited with a Nearbuy voucher.
It is very easy to locate and the ambience is just wonderful. The service is polite and prompt.
The food is some of the best Thai and Chinese that I have tasted in the city.

We tried the Tom Kha Het soup, which was something that I have never tried before. A coconut and lime based soup that was really tasty. Probably my dish of the day.
The fresh lime soda was refreshing and tangy, could do with a pinch of more sugar.
The green papaya salad was tangy and spicy and equally amazing.
Master Shifu's fish was soft, well cooked, kind of sweet and sour and tasted great.
The hakka noodles was pleasant and the corriander chicken was also really tasty.
Even their chocolate ice cream had tiny chocolate chips in it and was better that what we generally eat at restaurants.
They could slightly increase the amount of noodles they serve in a plate and a minutely sweeter fresh lime soda that would be my only critique.
But that is close to nothing.

I'd give them 4.8 if I could.
I had a great experience and I'd gladly visit again

SOI -Asian Street Kitchen is just located at the beginning of the Sudder Street (Esplanade). To be precise Zaranj and SOI are in the same building. The interior was well lit and decorated with quircky pictures. The interior was nothing less than a interior of a 5star restraunt . In short the ambience is great. Talking of the food we ordered a Lemon Coriander Soup(chicken) and for the main course we ordered Lemon Chicken along with Chicken Hakka Noodles. Both the soup and the chicken had a hint of kaffir lime (gondhoraj lebu) which made these two dishes different from the other restraunts. The Lemon Corriander soup bursted with flavors and also gave an refreshing effect. The quantity of soup is enough for one person.Moving to the main course the Hakka noodles were same as any other ordinary Hakka noodles but the boneless lime chicken was very soft, succulent and melted like butter in mouth. A perfect combination of sweet and sour. The quantity of the food was enough for two people.
The staffs were really polite and co-operating as we went there for the first time and we weren't being able to figure out what to order.
Looking forward to try some more exciting dishes.

Well I went to this place on bengali new year this year..  To my great relief this place has valet parking..  Well the restaurant can be located very easily as it is structured right on the exit of sudder Street.  The place has got a vintage look..  And very dimly lighted.. We coming to food I ordered for a lemon and coriander soup which was mild and very very light.. Just the way I wanted to start to my diner. Along with the soup I ordered master shifus fish which was nicely balanced with sweet and chilly..it had the perfect crunch.. In the main course I ordered for a drunken fish and leangs fried rice.. Both complimented each other in the best possible manner.. Had flavors and no ingredient was overpowering the other..  Again a must try..

To start with the place, the interiors are nicely done and the staff is extremely attentive and helpful. Now coming to the food, we had ordered Tom Yum, Manchow and Lemon Coriander in soups, of which the lemon coriander was the best and it tasted divine. For the starters we had ordered Master Shifu's Fish, Satay Kai and Kai Hor Bai Toey which they claim to be their signature dish. All the starters were so amazing that I cannot pick any favourite. You have to try all of them! Moving to the main course, we had Schezwan Chicken and Lemon Chicken with Leangs Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic Noodles. The Lemon Chicken was a bit sweet for my taste but it went well with the Fried rice. The other dishes were decent and there is some room for improvement. I will be going back again to try their Thai cuisine.

Situated near the Indian museum, this place is a pure bliss! Starting with the food,they were more delicious than they looked...The food presentation was really alluring but they tasted even better! The decor & the ambience was tip-top... The service was also pleasant and the staff were well-mannered & polite... At the end, there was a problem paying through card because the machine wasn't functioning properly but, atlast it worked. Also, the washroom flush wasn't functioning...These are a few things that need to be taken care of. Otherwise, a totally satisfactory place to hop in again & again!

SOI Street Kitchen is located at the entrance of Sudder Street just beside Indian Museum. The restaurant is a sophisticated one with a very different interior decoration. They have wooden shelves for keeping the alcohol and the kitchen is shaped in the form of a food truck- that's unique. The seating area is spacious and comfortable. The place gives a porshe feeling and a perfect dining area. 
The menu has been designed in a perfect manner with authentic Asian cuisine. Their regional names are given with explanations below them. We ordered-
1. Kai Hor Bai Toey - this is a chicken appetizer which is served in a woven box wrapped in pandanus leaves, the chicken pieces are deep fried served with Thai chili paste which makes it taste so good. The chicken pieces are cooked in Coconut oil and gives a faint smell which shouldn't be an obstruction in tasting the dish. The chicken pieces are soft and tender and juicy too. The sauce steals the show. 
2.Prawn Tempura with Sukiyaki and Teriyaki Sauce- The best Prawn Tempura I have had till date. They serve it in the soaking trays and the soft and juicy prawn are covered with classic fried tempura batter. The two kinds of sauce were complimenting the dishes so well. I would definitely try it again.
3. Leang's fried rice - This is a different kind of fried rice topped with coriander and other greens and is cooked with Tibetan spices. The rice is well cooked and the whole dish tastes amazing. Unlike the same fried rice, this is something new I tried and wasn't a failure.
4. Magshah Kae or Moo - this is a pork dish with sliced pork pieces cooked in traditional Magshah recipe. The gravy is the catch and the green veggies with the pork goes equally well. The pork pieces were tender and juicy. Being a pork lover, it's a very unique pork dish I have tried. This perfectly goes with the fried rice. 
The ambience is top notch, the service is commendable. The food tastes really good, the quantity is fine. The quality is the best of its kind. The presentation of the dishes are unique specially the Prawn Tempura and the Chicken Appetizer.  These are must tries. The price is a little on the higher side but the food won't let you complain about that. Highly recommended by me!

We were recommended this restaurant by our concierge at the Oberoi grand the hotel where I am staying with my wife .

It was my wife birthday and we believe that it's a worth call visiting this restaurant since we had the nicest food and true hospitality accorded by Pransanjeet  , he  ensured that our arrangements our well looked after he is a man whom one can rely for food recommendation .

Highly recommended for people who haven't been to this place Kudos to the team !!!

The restraunt has a good ambience but the food is not that great the som tam salad that I ordered was not cold and even didn't have much flavour they also didn't have chopsticks in an Asian restaurant isn't that just amazing. The restraunt waiter service was good but they should improve their food a lot. The prawn tempura was also very bad the batter was not as a prawn tempura batter is. Would not recommend this place to any friend or anyone.

Time of Visit - Weekday lunch, 1.30 pm

Location - The address is on the main road but it is on Sudder Street inside Zaranj. Ground floor. Easy to locate and park. 5 on 5.

Ambience - Beautiful ambience and decors. The music was Western and could be changed to Thai/Oriental, but nevertheless it was picture perfect. 5 on 5.

Value for Money - The menu is unique. In Thai, the competition is mainly with Benjarong and that is where the pricing is better off for this restaurant. We had gone on a Nearbuy voucher and the quality and quantity of food was great. The papaya salad and the crispy fish were just out of the world. 4 on 5.

Service - Good enough, given the fact that we went on a summer weekday lunch and so there were hardly any visitors. 4 on 5.

Overall, after ages, I've come across a very promising new Oriental brand in town and this would definitely go up the food value chain.

LOCATION:

Located next to the famous Zaranj restaurant near New Market or the Oberoi Grand Hotel. It's where Jong's use to be earlier.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Modern Asian food has been a rage in the city for a while now. Many interpret it as bringing street food from the far east in touch with some expensive ingredients and some refer to it as traditional dishes cooked in modern ways. SOI is the new kid on the block and the 4.5 rating on Zomato took me there with my friends this Sunday. The interiors are tastefully done up with an Asian Bodega kind of vibrant feel. I liked the way the place is done up. The bar is designed like one of those cocktail vans you will find in Pattaya or Phuket.¬†

WINE & DINE:

We called for a host of items including some Indian delicacies which they were kind enough to serve. This was appreciated. Among the Asian delicacies, we called for Crispy Chili Babycorn, Matchstick Chili Garlic Potatoes, Chili Garlic Noodles, Leangs Fried Rice, Chicken Satay & Chili Potatoes.

The Matchstick Potatoes were nice and had the right hit of chili and sweetness. The flavors were bang on although the potatoes could have been crispier considering they were quite finely cut.

The Crispy Chili Babycorn was too sweet with a good quantity of ketchup added to it. This overpowered the dish. Had they used the same sauce as the potatoes, the dish would have been much better.

I liked the Chili Garlic Noodles. They had been tossed to perfection with a slight bit of caramelization on the outside and a good smoky flavor of roasted chili paste.

The Chili Potatoes were good but not great. I was expecting something more with respect to flavors than the typical potatoes we get all over Kolkata.

The Leang's Fried Rice was normal fried rice with some coriander paste which resulted in a greenish color. The rice look attractive but I think they should add more paste for the taste of the coriander to shine through. They were kind enough to serve me the egg separately for the egg rice as my wife who was sharing the dish with me was vegetarian.

The real problem lay with the Chicken Satay. The skewers had been overcooked resulting in a fibrous and dry coating over the entire skewer. All the skewers were the same. We did complete the dish as we were famished by the time but did not enjoy the dish at all. The Peanut dip served with it should have been spicier.

Service was great right from serving us Indian delicacies on request to serving the egg in the egg rice separately.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The Chicken Satay was a disaster and really needs to improve. I thought the choices on the menu were too limited and one was almost left searching for something more to order. They could do better with the quantity of rice and noodles for the premium price they are charging.

VERDICT:

Service and ambience is good. The food needs work !

I have been there few days ago and till now I have visited here four times. And all of my visit to this place was excellent. It is located near the Indian Museum.
The ambience is excellent with soft music, pretty decorated and spacious. The seating arrangements includes both chair and sofa seats, both are pretty comfortable‚Äã. The place has been divided into a food area and a bar. There is good spacing between tables so that it don't look crowded.
Aside Brewed Beer and Draught Beer, all new kind of pulped flavoured draught beers are also available here. We have tried Orange flavoured Beer, which was too good. Also the Kingfisher Draught Beer is awesome.
The quality of food was also very good and tasty, specially the starters.
The service is excellent, staffs were warm, friendly and courteous enough. A huge thumbs up for the staffs.
I will surely visit here again, also recommend this place to everyone.

Food- well I hv mostly been here for the drinks but I hv tasted quite a bit of there starters. The veg ones are ok but what's up with their non veg section. No matter what I order all the chicken starters hv this strange phenolic taste to it which is very off putting. Better look into it
Service- warm n courteous enough,no complaints there
Price- very pocket friendly

Located just opposite of the Indian Museum..!! The Decor the ambience is absolute perfect..
Now coming to food.. It's like heaven on earth.. Ordered Satay Kai.. One of the most tasty recipe ever tasty.. It comes along with a chutney more likely to be peanut sauce.. which is mouth watering
Tempura Prawn.. It's by far the best thing I have ever ate.. It also comes with a chutney.. likely to be Teriyaki sauce.. I was in love with this thing.. Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles is also very tasty.. and Fresh Lime Soda which is quite good.. 
The behaviour of the staffs is great.. They are so helpful in all aspects.. Like choosing proper dishes.. constantly coming and checking if everything is all right or not..
Overall i loved it.. and hope to visit soon..

They take your money they serve heaven on your plate.
Decor: beautiful and classy. Got hint of heritage. Calming.
Staff: very well behaving, we always go to restaurants and communicate in Bengali and most of them reply back in English. They did not. And they were very well behaved, helpful about the menu and taking feedback of the food we are consuming.
Food: the best part of the restaurant. We ordered
Chicken satey Kai: it was perfectly cooked soft, full of flavours with crunchy peanuts on top. Served with beautiful chutney. Loveeeed it.
Tempura prawn: THE BEST prawn dish of my life. Crunchy cover, inside soft and smooth prawns served with sweet and sour chutney. Brilliant. Everyone should taste this once in their life.
Pan fried chicken noodle: very tasty, we asked for the noodle to be less crunchy and we got that. 
Sweet lime soda: it was proper.
If you're a food enthusiast. This is a place you should definitely visit.
Thumbs up

I went to this place to celebrate a party and since the order was in bulk we decided to go for buffet.

1.Ambience- pretty decor and spacious. The place had been divided into a food area and a bar .The seating area is pretty comfortable 

2.Food - The quality of food was pretty nice and the flavours were varied in taste and smell.The quantity however seemed a little dull and that was disappointing. 

3.Cost - A little over the top for its posh architecture inside .The place itself is elegant .

Happy hours have a good deal which starts from 4 pm  and hence the place can be visited once in a while if you are in that area .

Tempura chicken is the best thing about this place.
We tried d Long Island Iced Tea it was a 7.5/10 it tasted good but we think the alcohol content was less as it should be in a liit. Draught beer was fine tasted good. Tried chilly potato fries,crispy chilly babycorn some deep fried potato pakoda and mushrooms. All the starters tasted fine accept the mushrooms it tasted stale it didn't taste fresh. 
Finally we ordered a chicken dish which was recommended by the waiter it was something realted to coconuts please avoid it. The coconut chicken starter was a spoiler. Other than that everything was awesome. Ambience was fabulous. They need work on their playlist. 
Overall experience is good this is a nice restaurant.

Being a fairly new establishment, I have to say SOI has very quickly become my favourite place to eat. The food is really really good and authentically Asian. 
The location is super central and really easy to find as it is right next to the Indian Museum. 
The decor is interactive and really trendy and it's a comfortable and fun place to have a drink and dig into some authentic Thai food. 
The Tom Yum is one of the bests I've had in the city, and the food is exactly what you'd find on a humble hawker street corner in South East Asia.  
Definitely try any of the pork preparations as you won't be disappointed.
The staff are really helpful and friendly and add to the atmosphere of the place. This is definitely on my list of favourites in the city.

Move aside Brewed Beer and Draught Beer, try the all new pulped flavor beer, available here. We ordered Mango Beer, which is hands down a revolution to the beer scene in Kolkata. The fact that it is made out of fresh ripe mangoes made it even more tasty and special.

Food was also tasty and fresh. Prawn Tempura is a must order out here. We also ordered the semi spicy Roast Pork Chilli which was tasty but a little extra spicy.

A huge thumbs up for the staff. Very friendly and courteous. This was my first visit, but certainly would not be my last.

It's situated in the heart of the city just adjacent to Indian museum. First I'd say about ambience, it was surrounded by all the flags of ipl teams which drew my attention, mostly they have two different lawn i.e one for bar area n one for lunch. They offer variety of dishes in Thai and Chinese cuisine. I must say that in starter preparation a dish named "Kai Hor Bai Toey" was awesome, it was covered by leafs and it was great in taste. Later chicken in szechaun sauce and classic fried rice was served and it was also faboulous. However, it was our nice experience and would like recommend all for having there. Thank you.

Awesome ambience, interesting cocktails, good service, yummy starters, attractive happy hours and happy me!

This place is just beside the Indian museum, at the sudder street crossing. All sorts of Asian cuisines are available. Great interior decoration, lighting and live bar counter. You can see the bartender preparing your drinks as you wait. Staff are well mannered and helpful. Two of us went there during happy hour.

Happy hours are from 4pm-7pm every day and you get domestic cocktails and starters (veg, fish, chicken & pork) each for rs 165 during happy hours. One catch is that the cocktails during happy hours are of bartender's choice, i.e you have to order what the bartender suggests. To be honest we were disappointed at first, but we still asked the bartender about the various cocktails he can make for us and finally ordered whiskey sour. All our doubts went away after having the first cocktail, it was really good and made us high. My suggestion is keep asking the bartender about what he can make for you and order those, they should be good! Another good thing is that starters are also on offer during happy hours. You can have lip smaking starters at reduced price. Kudos for that. We had  whiskey sour, mint julep, pink lady and green apple pear martini. All of them were great. For starters we had american corn salt paper, chicken teriyaki and fried chicken wanton. They were very tasty. Pocket pinch was moderate, total 5 cocktails and 3 starters and bill was rs 1471. Tax amount of rs 151 was included in the bill. Will definitely visit to try their main course.

Located inside zaranj near sudder street, this is a gem of a place. The ambience was top notch and the staff was really courteous. Coming to food, it was excellent, specially the starters. Definitely recommend this place to everyone.

We ordered Kai hor bai toe, mixed classic fried rice ,pork noodles and chilli chicken ....
Now I will not deny that the ambience was good and the staff was polite. But the food quantity is extremely less with respect to the price being taken nor is the food very tasty ,it's just ordinary with no penache at all.

A sudden plan let me and my friend to visit this place... The place is inside Zarang..!! As it was an afternoon time the place is not filled up with much customers. Veg starters was not upto the mark but non veg starters was much better. Both chilly fish and gondhoraj chicken was good enough.!! I will rate 3.5/5 for this.

Located bang next to the Indian Museum, it's right at the beginning of Sudder Street. The ambiance is brilliant, especially if you want a place where you can be comfortable with your family. The crowd is good, the waiters are extremely attentive and the service impeccable. 
For some reason, this absolute gem of a place is never completely crowded. If you're here, you should definitely go for there Happy Hours, where every domestic cocktail is at 185 bucks with little added as tax. The food, Asian, goes really well with their flavoured draught beers.
A must visit.

üå∂spicy clear soup with fair amount of vegetables and chicken.
For the starters we tried 
  üêü Master Shifu's Fish: 5

Date of Visit ‚Äì 24/03/2017

Location ‚Äì It is located in Jawaharlal Nehru Road in the same building where Zaranj is. It is very near to Indian Museum. Wallet parking available.

Ambience ‚Äì  The interiors are good. The seating arrangements includes both chairs and sofa seats. There is good spacing between tables so that the arrangement doesn‚Äôt look crowded. Perfect fine dine in.

Service ‚Äì The Service is excellent. We reached early. We reached at 12, but the restaurant opens at 12.30. But we were allowed take our table and wait till the restaurant opens. They also offered water in the meanwhile. It was a great gesture from them. 

Food & Description ‚Äì It was a casual meet with a friend who doesn‚Äôt stay in Kolkata. We went to SOI. Heard a lot about it. We took the Nearbuy coupon.  At Rs 545/- , there was meal for two. It included 1 soup, 1 salad, 1 starter, 1 Main Course, 1 Desert & 2 fresh lime soda. The quantity was enough for two.  Coming to the food items we had:

Tom Kha Het Soup  ‚Äì This soup was nothing less that excellent. Its a midly spiced soup with mushrooms, coconut milk, lemongrass & galangal (thai ginger). Amazing flavour. A must try. 

Papaya Salad ‚Äì I love the papaya salad. I love the coarsely chopped peanuts in it. The salad has a colourful texture and great taste.

American Corn Broccoli Salt & Pepper ‚Äì Amazing taste. I feel like going on eating and eating.

Exotic Veggies in Schezwan Sauce ‚Äì This dish had loads of exotic veggies like broccoli, mushroom, babycorns etc cooked in Schezwan Sauce. Wonderful dish.

Chilli Garlic Noodles ‚Äì Perfect flavours of chillis & garlic. Excellent.

Darsaan with Ice Cream ‚Äì Darsaan was served with vanilla ice cream. Good taste.

Fresh Lime Soda ‚Äì Fresh lime soda salt was good 

Overall the experience was excellent. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. With nearbuy offer, pocket pinch was too less. But the nearbuy is valid for lunch only between Monday to Saturday. Highly Recommended. 

Pocket Pinch - 545 for 2 (nearbuy offer)

This one is located just beside Indian Museum.. Ambience is pretty much impressive...!! Food was delicious.. I wud say best thai I have ever had.. We started with Kai Hor Bai Toey!!! It's basically paturi but  cooked with chicken.. We ordered two cocktails one Pina colada and one Mai Tai..The alcohol content in the cocktails were negligible..!! That was the only turn off.. for which we had to order a pitcher of beer later on.. In main course we tried Leangs Rice n Pla Mangsha.. Pla Mangsha was prawn and probably the best among what we had..!!

Visited this place just today. I'm therefore writing this review while everything's still fresh in my memory.

This place is quite easy to locate - it's on your left when you enter Sudder Street from chowringhee road (you can see the restaurant immediately when you walk into sudder street).

The ambience is really charming. The restaurant is well decorated with wall arts and soothing lights. One would think that all these decorations would crowd the place, but it's not so. There was ample seating space. Add to that, hip background music, and - voila - you have an extremely attractive place.

We had the following dishes:
- Prawn tempura
- Schezwan fried rice
- Cantonese pan fried noodles
- Lemon chicken
- Lamb chilli
The pan fried noodles is a gravy kind of noodles with lots of vegetables. This dish is recommended only if you're into gravy noodles. The lemon chicken was scrumptious, to say the least. It was light and not that spicy, so avoid this dish if you're looking for something fiery. But let me tell you this, everytime you take a spoonful of that gravy it tingles your taste buds (the lemon chicken comes highly recommended). The tempura however, is an interesting dish. They give you prawns coated in some kind of batter (I forget what kind of batter), kinda looks like a kabiraji. It was crispy on the outside and real tender on the inside - other than that I can't really say much about this dish.

Also, they don't have a desserts section on their menu. You'll have to ask the waiters for desserts.

The quality of the food served along with the service, was outstanding. If you're looking to go Oriental and you're not afraid to shell out some cash (read: not a pocket friendly place), then you should definitely, definitely visit this place.

I don't think I would go there again nor would I recommend it to anyone.. bad service.. bad food.. too loud music for such a beautiful interiored ambience..

If you want authentic Thai food with a perfect dine then you must have to visit SOI which is beside of Indian museum,park street. First comes to quality and quantity of the food which was enough for two persons. Every food was very good in taste ...mouth-watering. We tried -
1) Lemon soda ( very large quantity )
2) Tom Yum soup ( best ever with chicken,mushrooms )
3) Papaya Salad ( very good )
4) Chicken Satay( oh that is my favorite Thai dish now ...really awesome)¬†
5) Hakka Noodles with chicken in Szechuan Sauce( very soft not so spicy )
6) Chocolate Ice Cream.
Other side the staff behavior was very polite which made that evening perfect.

After hearing a lot about it from friends, I decided to try out a new happening place located on the side of the Indian Museum. It‚Äôs easily accessible by road, and visible from a distance so there were no problems in finding the place. 

Coming in during happy hours, we immediately ordered a manhattan and mai tai along with some starters. The cocktails were okay and nothing special, though it was easy to see there was a learning curve going on with complements to the drinks only coming after a request. Coming to the starters, we decided to indulge in the highly recommended thai cuisine with pad prik khing prawns and magsaha pork. The prawns were exquisite and beautifully cooked but the pork could have been a little better in my opinion ‚Äì while they were well seasoned, the taste was tending towards bland. For the main course, we had moon fan rice with magsaha fish. While initially the rice was perfect and combined excellently with the fish, some portions during the second serving were found to be a little undercooked. The magsaha fish was okay in taste, but nothing really jumped out. For dessert, we had darsaan ice cream with the honey noodles not really conveying the flavour, though the ice cream was great to eat. The d√©cor was nice, but it was a little irritating to find that they didn‚Äôt have seating for only two people available ‚Äì with even our reservation getting us a four seater. The ambiance was nice and the washroom amenities were especially intriguing with the astrological symbols being put. The wall with enlarged stamp like pictures of the different places from which the cuisines were taken was also a great touch. The servers were also very polite and facilitated our dining experience quite professionally. Given the quantity, the prices were reasonable and we got bang for our buck.

Overall, deserves a repeat visit but hope they upgrade themselves as they grow in stature over the coming years. A promising new spot, especially for thai cuisine lovers.

The kaeng gai yellow curry with was very tasty, came with steamed rice. It was spicy but wasn't mentioned in the menu. The pad Thai we asked for with seafood, peanuts and lime. So far the most authentic Pad Thai I've had in the city. Service was excellent. Music was too loud for daytime so the waiter turned it down on our request. Would definitely go back to try other dishes on the menu. Only improvement is to have a little larger portions.

We visited SOI last evening to celebrate our parents 37th wedding anniversary. 
Food and drinks ordered:
1. Chicken wrapped in Pandanus leaves - 4.5/5
2. Tempura Prawns (My fav) - 5/5
3. Chicken in sweet thai chilli sauce - 4/5
(Not on the menu but was improvised for my 7 year old niece) 
4. Roasted Lamb Chilli - 5/5
5. Classic Fried Rice (2 portions) - 4.5/5
They added lamb on request...which made it really good. The portions were less though.
6. Lychee Mocktail 4/5
7. Breezers and cold drinks 
We paid 3k which was value for money. 

The ambience of the place is fabulous...upbeat lovely music, beautiful lighting, interiors...all pretty great but what i absolutely loved about the place was the attention the staff gave to us, they were so welcoming...full of smiles and on their toes to help...full of energy. It would be a pleasure dinning here again. 

The only input id like to give is, since the summers are in and the cuisine served is spicy they should cool the place better. They had to switch of the AC as some customers were sitting right under it and they were feeling cold which made it warm and uncomfortable for us through most of our meal. 

We mostly loved it and will go back soon.

I absolutely love this place. You get a chic vibe when you enter,with its open bar and live kitchen. 
They have a range of interesting cocktails. My favourite one is their espresso Martini. I also liked their galangal with whiskey special cocktail. The drinks menu is exhaustive,with quirky names and an option to order a pauwa(180 ml) at once. The music makes you comfortable.
The food is beautifully cooked as well. Their satay kai has a delicate balance of flavours which makes you go 'wow' with each bite. I also loved their Leann's fried rice. Though the meat quality of the pork they used for roast chilli pork was not upto the mark. It was quite hard.
Overall, this place is a fun place to hang out,maybe have that long overdue conversation with your friends.

A classy experience: Firstly this is one of the restuarant which offers valet service, which is a great pleasure in kolkata where there is dearth of parking space.
Interiors are very classy and high taste done in wood and white italian marble/tiles. Its very spacious and table are well spaced out unlike the crammed up joints. Lights and decor is tastefully done to portray the theme of SOI. Attendents were also v polite and mannered.
FOOD is the real USP of the place. Expect only superb quality of chinese and thai cusine. Loved their fresh ingredients and delicate aroma and taste. They had quite a good collection of liquors also. 
Would love to come here again and again and have good experiences. Thanks to Zomato for table booking facility. Cheers..

Went to this restaurant only because of the ratings given on zomato! Must say, biggest mistake. I really don't know why people have rated it so high! Either they don't know how Thai food tastes or we just had the worst day! My 1.5 rating goes entirely for the deco and ambience of the restaurant. 
Let's begin with the seating! It's so uncomfortable that one cannot even sit for the entire dinner without having a severe back ache! The chairs are so low that one might as well sit on the ground. We went with very high expectations n were dying to eat some goo Thai food. We ordered tom yum which was like a super super super spicy tomato soup. Ordered one Thai sweet chilly fish, which was the only item that we ate. Rest the entire order was returned. The chicken basil spring rolls were impossible to break into half hence not edible. So we decided let's not order Thai for mains and we ordered Chinese. Ordered prawns in barbecue sauce and the prawns were so hard and plastic that we had to return that too. The only good thing was that the restaurant accepted their mistakes and took back the food.

The place scores high in terms of ambience , the decor is really posh , music will uplift ones mood in no time , staff very courteous and food priced decently. I got to taste a lot of items since we went on a family dinner in a group of seven.

We ordered
Chicken tom yum soup
Chicken tom kha het soup
Chicken hot and sour soup
Chicken satay
Master shifu's fish in sweet thai chilli sauce
Moon fan rice
Thai green curry
Chicken magasha
Schezwan fish
Chilli garlic noodles
Schezwan fish
Darsaan with icecream

The stand outs were the TOM KHA HET soup , FISH IN SWEET THAI CHILI SAUCE , CHICKEN MAGASHA , MOONFAN RICE ( loved the way its presented on a sizzler plate) . Lamb was not available , also phad thai and quite a few other options in staples and desserts weren't available which was a major turn off. Except these above mentioned recommendations , the rest of the fare was average , with no usp if considered individually.
The food scores not more than 4/5.

But the overall experience of fine dining at such a beautiful restaurant for the first time , a surplus of .5 can be granted till the next time we drop in , expecting nothing short of a full on 5. I strongly believe the place has that potential to make it all perfect.

P.s. a request to management to keep an arrangement for complementing a small pastry or brownie for celebrating special occasions here , as expected from most restaurants of this class.

This is an Asian Street kitchen as the name literally means, SOI, located near the Indian museum. They have a restaurant in the front lobby as well as a sitting area inside where they have a live bar, made up like a food truck. They definitely have tried to give the feels of a street kitchen to this place, but the interiors are too posh to depict as such. Both the seating areas are spacious. 
We had an offer from the little app where we had got four starters along with 2ltr of draught beer. We chose to have mushroom salt and pepper, crispy chilly baby corn, roasted chili pork, chicken satay. 
The food was perfection redifened. Presentation was nice, but did not expect such perfect quality of food but they surprised us with all those delectable flavors. We again ordered for a caprioska and pandanus wrapped chicken (forgot the asian name). The pandanus to my dismay was banana leaves, but the chicken was too good with absolute flavors of the coconut milk,chillies and slight refreshment from Kaffir lime. The cocktail was equally good. I'm in love with their food and beverage menu as they have fruit flavored draught beer.
The service was fine, servers were attentive and very hospitable. You should try the happy hours at this place from 4 to 7 on food and drinks both, it's a perfect catch!

I specially recommend the appetizer Kai Hor Bai Toye... Chicken with spices covered and cooked in a leaf,similar to the Ilish Paturi. Awesome taste.
Certainly deserves a revisit.

The place scores high in terms of ambience , the decor is really posh , music will uplift ones mood in no time , staff very courteous and food priced decently. I got to taste a lot of items since we went on a family dinner in a group of seven.

We ordered
Chicken tom yum soup
Chicken tom kha het soup
Chicken hot and sour soup
Chicken satay
Master shifu's fish in sweet thai chilli sauce
Moon fan rice
Thai green curry
Chicken magasha
Schezwan fish
Chilli garlic noodles
Schezwan fish
Darsaan with icecream

The stand outs were the TOM KHA HET soup , FISH IN SWEET THAI CHILI SAUCE , CHICKEN MAGASHA , MOONFAN RICE ( loved the way its presented on a sizzler plate) . Lamb was not available , also phad thai and quite a few other options in staples and desserts weren't available which was a major turn off. Except these above mentioned recommendations , the rest of the fare was average , with no usp if considered individually.
The food scores not more than 4/5.

But the overall experience of fine dining at such a beautiful restaurant for the first time , a surplus of .5 can be granted till the next time we drop in , expecting nothing short of a full on 5. I strongly believe the place has that potential to make it all perfect.

P.s. a request to management to keep an arrangement for complementing a small pastry or brownie for celebrating special occasions here , as expected from most restaurants of this class.

This is an Asian Street kitchen as the name literally means, SOI, located near the Indian museum. They have a restaurant in the front lobby as well as a sitting area inside where they have a live bar, made up like a food truck. They definitely have tried to give the feels of a street kitchen to this place, but the interiors are too posh to depict as such. Both the seating areas are spacious. 
We had an offer from the little app where we had got four starters along with 2ltr of draught beer. We chose to have mushroom salt and pepper, crispy chilly baby corn, roasted chili pork, chicken satay. 
The food was perfection redifened. Presentation was nice, but did not expect such perfect quality of food but they surprised us with all those delectable flavors. We again ordered for a caprioska and pandanus wrapped chicken (forgot the asian name). The pandanus to my dismay was banana leaves, but the chicken was too good with absolute flavors of the coconut milk,chillies and slight refreshment from Kaffir lime. The cocktail was equally good. I'm in love with their food and beverage menu as they have fruit flavored draught beer.
The service was fine, servers were attentive and very hospitable. You should try the happy hours at this place from 4 to 7 on food and drinks both, it's a perfect catch!

Before this place used to be ZONG. Now it is SOI.
Easy to find. Just near the Indian Museum.
ONE TIP - Entering the no entry zone from the main road infront of the museum is allowed only if you go to the SOI or Zarang.
Not easy to locate if you come from back - From Marquis street or from new market. You can only find it if you know the place.
The booking was damn easy. They took it over the phone as well as through Zomato too.
ANOTHER TIP - Wallet parking available.
The place is simply beautiful and wonderfully decorated. Not congested. All tables very well spaced out. People are also courteous. Service is a bit slow but I think they will be able to manage overtime. I think they are in the learning stage.
Food. Yes thats the greatest part. Whatever we ate was a treat.
Be it starters or the main course. We simply loved every bit of whatever was served. ¬†We specially loved the Leangs Fried Rice and the starter Vegetable Tempura. Simply awesome. Fresh tastes. Fresh vegetables.¬†
Must visit. Highly recommended.

SOI is a restaurant specializing in Asian Food. It's situated right on the sudder street crossing. The interior is great, with soothing music. The service was quite well too. Now coming to the food, we had Blue Hawaiian, Applettini, Fresh Lime Soda for drinks. The Applettini was awesome. Although, can't say the same about Blue Hawaiian. Would suggest to avoid it. 
Now, for starters, we had their signature Chicken Tempura. It was worth every penny. It was soo delicious. 
Coming to main course, we ordered Leangs Fried Rice, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Magsaha Chicken, Red Curry Lamb. Every single one of them were delicious. The Lamb Curry was my favorite one. It was served on a small oven, which kept it hot. We loved every bit of our lunch. 
And for dessert, we had Darsaan Ice cream, again tasty as hell. 
Recommending this place to everyone if you want to have Asian food.

What a wonderful experience it was on the week of my anniversary .We bought little coupon and had a blast trying out few new Thai dishes . We also ordered few drinks ( whiskey ) and a cocktail ( rob roy )which was also cool on pocket as it was ordered in happy hours . The staffs was very pleasant . We tried out ¬†tom yum and tom kha for soup, papaya salad , kai hor bai toey and master shifu's fish for starters ,gaeng kua kai and magshah kai for main course , it all came accompanied with kaffir leave rice and darshaan with ice cream for desserts. Also we were given fresh lime soda .All was very tasty . Only a suggestion would be to give a few choice for desserts . Very Satisfied.

Yesterday we had our lunch at this awesome place. We had one nearbuy coupon of 4 course lunch for two persons. Ambiance was so cool and soothing  and stuffs were very friendly and efficient. Let's come to the foods, if you are tired of taking chinese and mughlai cuisine you can try Asian cuisines like thai, it serves really tasty and yummilicious thai cuisines. We ordered tom yum soup, papaya salad, kai hor bai toey,  chicken hakka noodles, coriander chicken   fresh lime soda and darshan.  All of these were so tasty and unique . And the quality was good enough for two people. Kai hor bai toey is a signature thai dish, really yammy. At the end I can say if you are a foody who can experiment with their tastes must try this place.

It's a very prime location near by Indian Musium and also it's too cheap and pocket freindly. First time I visited here several time SOI. The Ambience was super and also the music was heart touch. The happy hours option became very pocket friendly.
¬†I ordered three cocktails, the taste was super.Among of them the cocktails was Scotch Ricky(rating 4.8/5). It was aswam with many cut off green mangoes with the mixture. I suggest if you like whiskey cocktails,try this.
And other two cocktails were good, they are manthanan(rating 4.2/5) & Old Fashion(4.5/5)
I recommend everyone try to taste here for cocktails.¬†
And also 4 course menu is superb quality.
For soup portion those were very tasty TOM KHA HET, TOM YUM, WONTOM SOUP
in a starter Chicken Satay, Kai Hor Bai Toey,Chicken Spring Roll, Fried Wanton,Master Shifu's Fish in Sweet Thai Chili Sauce¬†
In main course hakka noodles and Lemon Sauce was aswam.
at the desert part Darsaan with ¬†Ice Cream.
Staff : very courteous, very friendly, they create a very homely atmosphere for you, just ask them if you are unsure about anything. They know their menu well. Special mention : the bartender, Sanjay. A very friendly person and he does his job pretty well. If you are unsure about your drink, just ask for him, he will come to your table and help you out with it. And he prepares such pretty cocktails! :D

Overall: I am in love with this place. They don't compromise on the quality of food and drinks offered even in their Happy Hours. Amazing food, an amazing collection of cocktails to choose from. It's one of my favourite hangouts. If we are indecisive about where to go, I just say let's go to SOI.

For the first time I am rating an eatery 5 star in Zomato and there is a reason behind it.

Short Review:
Food Quality: 4.7/5
Decoration & Ambience: 4.8/5
Hospitality: 5/5
Time taken to prepare the food: 4.9/5 
Recommended: Kai Hor Bor Toey, Master Shifu's Fish
Verdict: Definitely visit them for delicious Asian/Thai/Continental food in a pocket friendly price.

Detailed Review: Located at the prime location ¬†of Esplanade, this place is easy to find and probably undertaken by Zaranj. We went their with Nearbuy voucher which cost us approximately INR 243 per head and I would say the deal is more than value for money and we got more than what we paid. You should definitely hit the place to spice up your taste-buds without hurting your pocket. To get the most out of your money, try to be their within 4-7PM, i.e. the happy hour of this restaurant when you can get any cocktail (Except Gin and Shots) and any Starters (Except prawns and seafoods) at the cost of INR 165¬†+ VAT.All the food we ordered with their subsequent rating based on their taste:Sweet Lime Soda - 4/5
Sweet Corn Soup - 3/5
Hot & Sour Soup - 4.5/5
Satay Kai - 4.7/5
Kai Hor Bai Toey 4.5/5
Tempura Chicken with Sukiyaki & Teriyaki Sauce - 4.8/5
Schezwan Fried Rice - 4.6/5
Schezwan Chicken - 4.8/5
Chicken in Coriander Sauce - ¬†4/5
Darsaan with Vanilla Ice-cream - 3.8/5
Scotch Ricky (Cocktail) - 4.8/5

Other than the good food quality, the serving bowls were eye-candy. Calm ambience, Decorated walls with old paintings & large wooden framed mirror, soothing music in background makes this place praise worthy. We got a very polite behaviour from waiters and they also helped us to choose their speciality from menu.

Looking forward to visit again.

Just need a few steps to reach the Asian restaurant SOI from park street metro,just besides the Indian Museum ....A perfect amalgamation between Thai and Chinese ...

Ambience -a tune which helped to move with it and the quite peaceful surroundings made us very much calm and comfortable..
Hospitality- we get warm welcome by the manager and the staff's are so adorable and helped us immensely to find the proper menu...and service was quick enough and very much potential about their duties..and caring too...
Food ordered -1.satay kai
2.Shifu fish
3.Moon fan rice
4.cantonese pan fried noodles
5.Magsha fish
6.chocolate frost
7.Frozen lychee Margarita
8.Blue Hawaiian
9.watermelon with basil
Food quality & quantity personally liked shifu fish..highly recommended ,...moon fan rice amount wise 1for 1person only but was the shows stopper dish...
i don't like the Cantonese pan fried noodles ....
mocktail frozen lychee was the best mocktail from above mentioned order...
quantity need to be enhance..
Price-little bit high but worth it..

A perfect dinner with a very special person on a Valentine's evening with SOI
I desperately want to go there again for the shake of other dishes ...

Asian Streets re-lived @ SOI..!

It‚Äôs time to psych up your taste-buds as the new unique, quirky Street food straight from the Orient will be served steaming on your table. Quick, economical and chock full of flavor, street food gives hungry passers-by a lot to love in the Soi‚Äôs (By-lane in Thai) of the Far-East. Presenting to you- SOI: The Asian Street Kitchen, from the house of Zaranj.¬† The brainchild of Young, spirited Raghav Khullar and Aritra Sen makes SOI a quirky, young place to drop in. The bold flavors of street side eateries and the vibrancy of the nightlife culminate to create an electric atmosphere, making SOI the perfect hang-out.
                                                                ...

I have been to this place last year on Christmas evening. When I called them for a table reservation they told that ala-cart menu is not applicable for Christmas and only buffet is available. I booked a table for 2 people and reach around 9 pm. After reaching at SOI, I came to know about that it is a part of restaurant and they have newly prepared this. Fine the waiter hand over the menu for food and mocktails. In soup, we have tested hot n sour, Tom yum and Tom KHA het. Except the last one both the soups are very good to taste. I love Kai Hor Bai toy . Among the non veg starters it was my favorite and dish of the night.

Located very close to the Indian Museum and hence is easy to find. SOI is a part of Zarang restaurant. I had gone for lunch last week with my friend after getting a Zomato voucher. The ambience is calm and comfortable. The decor is on point with many paintings and a big framed mirror on the wall. We went around 4pm and hence could order starters at a lowered rate due to the 4-7 pm offer they had. The servers were very polite and well trained. They knew the menu well and provided us with suggestions. Hence we ordered these dishes:-
Magshah Phak- Chicken pieces made with Thai special spices and curry. Totally delicious. Perfect blend of spices without being too spicy. #recommended
Moon Faan Rice- The rice was served on a hot plate. A little bit of red wine was poured around it to create the sizzle and give the rice an amazing fragrance. Extra points for the presentation. This yummy rice could have been had solo, without the need of any gravy or side dish as such. üòçüòç
Satay Kai- 5 pieces of chicken skewers cooked in Thai style served with a peanut sauce. The sauce was the best thing ever. I still have it's taste in my mouth. The satays were grilled and had a few peanuts coated over it which gave it a nice crunch. Great dish.
Tempura Fried Chicken- This is another starter which proved to be my favourite. Deep fried chicken coated in tempura flour. Crispy to the core! Loved it! SOI sure knows how to make their sauces lip-smaking tasty. The sweet honey chilli sauce was a perfect accompaniment to this crispy affair.
Kai Hor Bai Toey- Diced chicken pieces cooked with spices and wrapped in leaves,served with the Thai sweet chilli sauce. Although this dish was good in itself,it fell short when compared to all the other items.
By the end of the meal,me and my friend were rubbing our tummies and had smiles on our faces. This is a must visit place. Both quality and quantity are great. SOI made me a fan of Thai cuisine,which I hadn't really had earlier. Looking forward to another visit here.

Had a wonderful evening that started with the experience of being at a corner table in an entirely empty dining room with very personalised service from an attentive waiter who was not intrusive at any time. The drinks - we opted for Hoeggarden and Chocolate frost were refreshing, elegantly served and without unnecessary frill. Matchstick potato and chicken satay as starters were absolutely delicious.
Coming to the main courses - we had one of SOI's signature dish - the Magsaha chicken, and it was from another world. We had it with the Leangs Fried Rice. The green curry pork (Kiew Kaeng Moo), which came with its own attendant white rice was another experience in gastronomical delight.
Can't wait to go back.

Bought chinese deal from little aap.
Once u enter u feel the calm quiet awsomely done interior and instantly fall in love with it .
Loads of sitting area
A big bus made where the drinks are made.
Staff are very warm and welcoming.

 Mr Sanjay Das greeted us and took us to our table . Helped is with the menu and answered our query about the food. A big üëçüëçüëçüëç for him.
Now coming to food
1. Tom yum soup : spicey soup with loads of veggies and chicken. Loved the taste.
2. Chicken satay : tender chicken very well.marinated and cooked with a dip. The dip distinct flavours of coconut and peanut. Awsome .
3. Crispy chilly baby corn : üòçüòçüòç
4. Chowmin with shejwan chicken : chowmin was good . Loved the shejwan chicken here. It has carrots ,mushrooms and veggie and the gravy was spicey . The best Shejwan chicken I have had I am sure.
5. Ice cream with darshan : crunchy darshan with ice cream.

My experience is great.
Do drop in . Highly recommended .

Good food, good place.¬†

SOI is very easy to locate, beside Zaranj, 1 minute walk from the Indian Museum.

The interior is well done, the ambiance is calm and quiet with soft, soothing music that will relax you instantly. Right from the entrance, to the walls and ceilings, this place gives a perfect Fine Dining feel without overdoing anything.

We ordered:

1. Lemon Coriander Soup with Chicken : What a start to the meal! Warm soup with shredded chicken and the perfect balance of coriander and lemon. A pleasure in every sip.

2. Crispy Conjee Chicken : A bowl of delicious crispy chicken which will surely make you crave for more. I love how they maintain the perfect balance of spices in all the dishes.¬†

3. Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice : My friend with fever and cold wanted something spicy, hence this order. They served it beautifully, making the dish so appealing that we couldn't stop clicking pictures. The rice tasted great.¬†

4. Lamb Chilli : Another great dish. It is usually a dry preparation but we requested to make it with gravy and they obliged! The shreds of lamb pieces (Without fat, the best part!) in the yummy gravy tasted too good. Loved it!

5. Chocolate Frost : A Chocolate based mocktail made to perfection. It is thick, hence quite filling.

Service : Quick and Courteous.

Portion : Okay. Could be little more generous.

Price : Reasonable.

Recommended!

The Asian Street Kitchen is d punchline of d place!Went to d place b4 a day.                                                  Location: Adjacent to The Indian Museum sideways.Its nearer to park street rather dan esplanade.One can easily find it out!Its d new emerging part of d famous Zarang dat witnessed 2 decades out at dat place!                                                 Ambiance: As its d part of Zarang, one can easily guess how d place can be,well in simple words it's really v nyc. Decoration is something dat will impress u.                                                                                        Food: Coming towards d most important part-Dis tym opted with nearbuy vouchers so had d following items:Starting with d Soup I took Chicken Hot & Sour which was just perfect. Served with sweet fresh lime soda which was again good in quality as well as quantity dat surprised me much üòÑ! Next came d papaya salad where I was asked that d dish as is spicy so wud I like to opt for it or wud like to have it less spicy,I opted with d 2 one. Well d preparation was nice as dat of being papaya how much can it taste more? A sweet smell of Gandhoraj nimbu was coming out. The only thing dat  I found was it's a heavy dish and too much of pieces of nuts were present dat discouraged to take it further, so consumed only d part dat was served for d 1 st Time. Moving towards d starter I had Master Shifu's fish where I had more expectations as thought it wud definitely be more enchanting to d taste buds.Anyways was good!Next came d main course with d Noodles where I took Szechuan Chicken which was lip smacking but again d Noodles wasn't dat great.Noodles was also less in quantity & was rough!Among everything I tried out dere I didn't like d Noodles but d part what I liked about it was less oily. Lastly in d dessert had vanilla ice cream dat was regular!                                                                        Hospitality & Service: In both of these aspects they were perfect/awesome. Additionally 2-3 different people, attandant to manager came and asked about taste of d food!                                                                 Final words: Surely a place worth to visit.As I opted for nearbuy, so m rating +.5 this time....üòúüëç

SOI, a casual dining restaurant in the most chaotic area of the city, stands detached from the bustling environment. From the time of our entry until our departure, there was not a moment when we were not impressed by the services here. Very courteous staff and very calm and peaceful ambience with soft music playing in the background. Now coming to the food, every single dish served to us, was toothsome beyond doubt. The Veg Yellow Thai Curry with Rice was simply delicious. We savoured every bit of it. This dish is necessary to try for everyone visiting SOI.

‚ÄãThese days it won‚Äôt be really tough for you to find distinct cuisines everywhere in Kolkata. Oriental has gone far beyond just Chinese and Kolkata has seen the introduction of Asian cuisine. The latest and one of the best restaurants which you can definitely add to that list is SOI, The Asian Street Kitchen. This is located in the same building where Zaranj is. I was invited here for a bloggers meet, organised by Communications 2.0. Let‚Äôs get into details.
                                                                ...

It is located inside famous Indian Restaurant Zarang. To be more precise, it is very near to Indian Museum. I had got a chance to visit this as it was Youtube Creator‚Äôs day event and one of my friend who is a prominent magician Debjit invited me here. This place serves chinese food and it‚Äôs wok is easily seen. As i had gone in the event, i cannot much comment about the pocket pinch. It was all on the house for us.

Located beside Indian Museum, inside Zaranj this is one of the emerging Thai restaurant.
Beautiful ambiance, courteous staffs,decorations,food,menu variety...everything was unique and awesome.
Went with nearby coupon...we were offered:
1.Fresh lime soda-Refreshing, though the sweetness was lacking a bit
2.Tom Kha Het soup-Awesome soup..with every sip we were getting lost in the Thai flavours...and the feel of lime was very refreshing .Highly recommended to those who are not spice lovers.
3.Papaya salad-Not that great...and a very heavy dish..felt like we were having main course instead of appetiser.
4.Master Shifu's Fish-Show stopper dish..Very soft well marinated bhetki fish in sweet thai sauce..very tasty.A must try dish.
5.Thai rice with red curry-White plain rice with lime leaves served with red hot thai curry with mushrooms and chicken.Perfect quantity for 2 person..another mind blowing dish.
6.Darsan with vanilla ice cream-Darsan was same like other restaurant.
Overall a nice experience...my best wishes for its success üòä

The old chinese Jongs has turned into soi , inside zaranj, the place is well decorated and looks like a mordern take on the fusion asian food.

We tried the Tom yum soup which was ok , Crispy chilli baby corn was also nice and lastly the match stick potatoes was ok too. Also requested the chef to make Chinese bhel which they obliged us by making , which was ok to taste.

Also if you while booking the table mention that you want Indian starters from zaranj, they will get the zaranj menu for you to order .

As per there service was good.

A day out with my girls brought me to this thai joint which has cropped up just where Zaranj is.I have been to Zaranj before.The setup for SOI is very formal dining.Its all pretty just what was needed for a girly evening.We ordered for a pineapple mojito pitcher.It was refreshing and had generous amounts of pineapple in it.Leaving the apetizer we headed directly for the maincourse.Our server was very well aware of the menu which is to be appreciated.We went for his choices for the evening with a fish magshah,chicken in hunan style ,schezwan seafood noodles and chilli garlic chicken noodles.The food was balanced though i feel the quantity could have been a little more generous.Well like any other bong we love large portions.The fish magshah was tangy and very subtle in taste.The noodles could have been better.The bill came to a decent 2500 which is expected from a fine dining.Its a place for a romantic date if you want to impress your lady love head over to SOI.

Visited here on Christmas day. That day they had a special offer which was, if you pay 1495/- for each person then you'll get unlimited buffet with unlimited liquor and desserts also.

Believe me, it's quite expensive for one person but it's fantabulous in here. From the starter to dessert each and every items they have made perfectly. There cocktails are too good.

They just made my Christmas evening special and memorable.

Thank you guys but I don't give you full rating just because want to come here again with a great discount. üòÇüòù
If you guys give that to me,then I'll give you full rating next time. üòÇüòÇ

I'd won a voucher from Zomato for SOI and visiting it initially was not a very pleasant experience and the manager made it up big time. they don't deliver food but on request he made it a point to deliver food at my residence in ruby which is quiet a distance. The food delivered by sheikh who was very humble:)
It was a green Thai curry (chicken) with rice flavoured with lemongrass and it was excellent, one of the best I've had. The prawn which was a semi gravy time had 5 good and fresh pieces was decent  too with a strong flavour of soya. I would certainly visit them soon :)

What a wonderful place we stumbled on! Fresh new exotic pitcher of drinks, reasonably priced, lovely starters and even better main course! 

We ordered one hairy Buffalo pitcher at the recommendation of the server. It had a nice hit to it with a fruity punch. For starters we ordered for chicken and a fish starter which we gulped down within minutes of its arrival. Pork Thai green curry for mains and it was superb.  The pork was lean and soft and the curry was so light and refreshing. 

Full points for ambience, decor and staff.  The bill amount also had us pleasantly surprised: 1800 for all this.  A huge thumbs up and a definite follow up visit from my side!

Ok!! Its an awesome experience at SOI...Nice ambience and decoration... Next coming to food...bt from where should I start..! We ordered fresh lime , tom yum soup, chicken satay, papaya salad, classic chicken fried rice, lemon chicken and Darshan...All the items were yum..soup was too good for mainly the flavour of lemon leaf..peanut in the salad gives it a crunch and obviously a good test..must try this salad..chicken satay with the dip(may be a peanut dip) was just perfect..fried rice was nice bt it tests more with lemon chicken, which is little sweet..lastly Darshan, a normal ice cream with some testy fries.....üòãüòã too good... 
Thanks to the chef for the creation of magic on your plate.üòç

Oh what a lovely experience it was today.! I was following zomato reviews for last few days about this newly opened much rated restaurant and today visited for a lunch with my boy friend. Firstly this place can be very easily located as it is just beside Indian museum in esplanade sharing the same entrance with the famous Zaranj restaurant. After entering the first impression was like just wow. Lovely well arranged dining space with a perfect soothing ambiance. The staffs welcomed us humbly and we got seated comfortably. 

We had a nearbuy coupon so some of the menu was previously selected. Apart from that we ordered chicken tom yum soup, chicken satay as starter along with papaya salad followed by non veg classic fried rice and lemon chicken in main course. Lastly we chose darshan as dessert. 

Fresh lime was served first which was refreshing. Then within some couple of minutes the tom yum soup was served and it tasted just delicious. The soup had a perfect flavor of lime leaves with chicken and mushrooms in it. Next the papaya salad was served and I was quite doubtful about this dish before tasting but as soon as I tasted, it seemed like innovative as well as great in taste. The starter chicken satay was the show's topper of today's lunch. It was too good with various flavors in it and they served it with peanut butter dip which made it more tasty. Coming to the main course the rice was good and perfectly cooked. The lemon chicken was also nice. The quantity and quality of the foods served was worth mentioning. Darsaan was served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and last of all we loved the dessert. 

The staffs were very courteous and well behaved. The washroom is also very neat and clean which most of the restaurants forget to keep in mind. So it was a superb food journey for both of us today. Thanks to SOI for making the day so special with such awesome foods.

One of the best Thai food I ever had. I loved that van style bar.  I loved their hospitality. I think the service was way too good. Food was obviously awesome, from taste to temperature. We ordered the Tom yum soup, tempura chicken in teriyaki and sukiyaki sauce, chilli garlic noodles and magshah moo(pork). This dish was just out of the world. Very tasty. And in drinks we ordered tequila sunrise and classic margarita. Good experience overall. Must visit!

The Asian food landscape in Kolkata is exciting and another jewel to this addition would be SOI. This new asian kitchen style concept restaurant has fantastic interiors, a casual yet elegant vibe and wonderful service. On a recent visit, a pleasant winter evening and a warm ambience are enough to make one happy, however, the sensational food and cocktails make it hard to forget. We ordered the papaya salad, corn curd pepper chilli,matchstick potatoes.All the starters were divine. The main course was mostly thai green vegetarian curry, exotic vegetables in coriander sauce, veg chilli garlic noodles and leangs fried rice. The main course was equally appetising and delicious. The food here is mind blowing period. The tipple on offer is equally wonderful. Highly recommend whiskey sour, galangal and mint old fashioned, vodka based sweet pine caramel, spicy guava mojito, smoking monk. The bar is well stocked and plenty of options. Special mention to Gavin ( manager), the chef and bartender for making it a super awesome experience. I wish I had more pictures. However, I am coming back here soon again to experience all of it again. Keep up the good work guys!!!

Finally an asian restuarnt which has more than noodles and chilly chicken. 
It is very easy to find, bang opposite to indian museum. And, a little away from the crowds of park street. Plus, the manager is really cordial over the phone while giving direction. 
Ambience : 
There's a huge truck in the restuarnt looking like a food truck, which is where the mocktails are being made. Initially, that will freak you out. But it doesnt look weird anyway. Its a fine dining resturant, with well lit dining area.
About food : 
We had lime soda, 
Tom yum soup with chicken, 
Master Shifu's Fish 
Papaya Salad
Schezwan Chicken
Chilly garlic noodles 
Darshan with ice cream.
Tom yum soup, in the first glance looked like distilled curry, and looked unappetizing, but the moment a mouthful is taken, there can be nothing better in the winter afternoon.  Tangy, spicy and robust of flavours with Kaffir, lemongrass and bits tamarind, it is absolutely delicious and a must try. 
Master's Shifu's Fish, is another win. Pieces of Bhekti, served with sweet chilly sauce and bell peppers. Its is small, tasty and absolutely worth the money. Absolutely perfect size for a starter, fresh juicy pieces of fish breaking down with fork easily and the sauce? i wouldnt mind having one bowl of it. Its that tasty.

Papaya salad, fresh, crunchy, tangy and absolute mouth cleanser

Chichen schezwan, is not as spicy, which would finish your palate. But, it has heat, and a good amount of tang to it. The gravy is rich and the chicken on the other hand well cooked. 

Noodles, good quantity, with a great amount of garlic in it.  

Darshaan with icecream, on clarification, we were told that there shall be one scoop of ice cream, but we receivee two scoops. And who doesnt like extra scoops of ice cream? Small pieces of darshaan, sticky and soft churned ice cream ends our perfect meal. 

Staff : Really polite and looks forward to feedbacks, after the meal

This is a must try place. Food is extremely great and authentic. I shall definitely come for more.

The starter was bean curd pepper chilli which was well made, gooey center and the sauce on the side was good. Loved the magshaw phak with the steamed rice. The steamed rice was steamed in bamboo boxes. 
A must visit.

After reading the reviews on Zomato by various food bloggers, I planned to try out this place. But somehow I felt, this restaurant is overhyped. Interiors and the ambience is top notch. No complaint about that. But the food..was kinda disappointing. We ordered for Manchow soup, which was just fair in taste but the quantity was very less. Then came the Papaya Salad which tasted horrible. None of us could eat it. After this, we had this Chicken Satay. It was again..just fine. Nothing great about it. I didn't like the sauce given with it. Then we had Classic Fried Rice with Hot Garlic Chicken. Tasted fair but the quantity of rice was extremely less! We were 2 people..so we ordered one plate rice and were shocked to see the quantity. One plate rice would definitely not fill even one stomach properly...forget about sharing it with another. We also had 2 glasses of Draught Beer which was okayish. 
So basically, according to me, the food here hasn't matched the standard of the interiors and ambience. Also I found the place a little overpriced as per the food quality and quantity.

Long gone are the days when our meal at a Chinese restaurant consisted of the same hackneyed dishes being ordered on every visit. The word Asian, which is much more comprehensive, has taken over the decades old Chinese dining scene in Kolkata. Almost every upcoming restaurant now focuses on various Asian cuisines rather being oriented around Chinese only. That being said, the modern Calcuttan isn‚Äôt impressed merely by food. The ambience and d√©cor of a restaurant influence his visits as much as the food served there. This has led to a serious rise in the number of capital-intensive dining joints in the city, who invested heavily in their interiors to provide a positive vibe to the customers. And such a restaurant, which is right on top of the game, is SOI ‚Äì The Asian Street Kitchen.

The place is located near The Indian Museum and is a part of the famous Zaranj restaurant. As stated above, a lot of capital and thought process has been put into the interiors, which are embedded with various aspects from the Asian cultures. Among them are two antique three hundred year old samurai clay masks hung up on the left wall. A truck which resembles the bartender‚Äôs station, has been flown down all the way from France. Flamboyant is the word which we can use to describe the place. The place also scores well in terms of seating arrangements and also exudes ample lighting inside the restaurant.
The Suavy Glutton feels extremely grateful to Communications 2.0 for the invitation to the first bloggers‚Äô meet at SOI.

Service was fluent all throughout the event. The servers took note and replaced the empty vessels whenever necessary. Their bar man deserves a special mention for his defining creativity with the drinks and their presentation. Prices are a bit higher than normal. But if you are craving for some Asian food trail, SOI is the place to be.

So folks that was about it from SOI ‚Äì The Asian Street Kitchen.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Soi - The Asian Street Kitchen. Calcuttans were due a place of this kind. Its expansive, well lit , comfortable evoking a sense of relaxation. Seating is low, allowing the customer to enjoy the Victorian ceilings. They have an elaborate liquor menu. Lovely to see a restaurant getting serious about cocktails. The Galangal and mint old fashioned (imported) which uses Jim Beam as a base is fresh with notes of caramel and spice. 
Ordered the Kar Hoe Bai Toey which is Chicken wrapped in Pandana leaf marinated in an coconut emulsion with Thai chilli paste and kaffir lime. A real lipsmaker served with Sweet Thai Chilli Sauce. Followed this dish up with a traditional Kaeng Khiao Kae(Green Curry Lamb). Creamy with tender thin slices of meat. A robust hit of galangal. 
Food like this is not eaten ,it's savoured. 
An experience to remember. 
Thankyou Team Soi.

With so many eateries, big and small crowding the food space in the city, ever so often, it is becoming increasingly hard for a specific establishment to leave a mark on their guests. Guests are constantly being treated to food that is becoming easily comparable to food served at many other joints, hence, losing the impact that a restaurant is trying to leave on its guests. This is where it becomes important for a restaurant to step out of its own comfort zone and into the guests‚Äô. This is exactly what SOI, The Asian Street Kitchen has done.

Loooooved this place. Found SOI on Zomato since it was my first visit to Kolkata. The food was out of this world. We ordered the virgin pina colada and the blue Hawaiian for drinks and the presentation and taste of both were delicious. For starters we ordered the lemongrass chicken, and for the main course the veg yellow curry which came with rice which we thoroughly enjoyed. The ambience was really nice with some fun music.  The waiters were very polite too. Highly recommended!

Amazing and delicious food. Esp the lemon grass chicken starter. Just the right amount of lemon grass and not too dominating over the sauces. The thai yellow curry came with steamed rice. Just the right quantity. Polite servers as well. They helped with the description of the food as well. The drinks in image, pina colada and blue hawaiian were too good.

Best Thai Food I have ever had in Kolkata. We visited there without having any ¬†review and anything and we are just overwhelmed with the food , ambiance & mostly hospitality. I had a very bad throat, once I formed them, they are very cautiosly serving me only luke warm water ... Thanks guys :)¬†
Ambiance is really cool , charming and have a feeling of oriental streets ... It takes you out of Kolkata in Kolkata ! ;)¬†
Regarding food, let's go one by one .... ¬†
1. WONTON SOUP - Which as as usual good¬†
2. MASTER SHiFU'S FISH - Its a bhetki's dish prepared in thai red sauce , still mesmerizing the taste !! :P
3. in main course we ordered KAENG KAE (lamb) ¬†in RED CURRY. Generally ¬†I don't prefer lamb as in many place they don't cook it properly and a typical lamb's smell use to be there. But this dish satisfied me fully.¬†

Chinese/Thai food lover should check out this place at least for once ! :) Hoping to visit very soon

Quirky Decor, Classy Ambience & Sexy Food. This is what defines SOI. My girlfriend was a bit hesistant due to the change of plans, but after the meal,she had the biggest smile on her Face.

Very well decorated in a classy manner. The bar from the back of a Truck adds bonus points to the decor. Since we were in a mood for some munchies and some punchies, we thought of ordering a bit and move on to the party circuit. But, when the food started coming, boy it did not stop(since it was hard to resist, we ended up ordering more than we had expected). The best part was that we tried every meat there was to try at SOI.

To quench our thirst and also to get a bit Tipsy, we ordered the Hairy Buffalo (not a pleasant name, lol, but it does hit you like a Buffalo).

Then the munching began, we started off with Prawn Tempura in Teriyaki sauce and Roast Chilli Pork. It felt like heaven and totally worth the money given the fact that it is very much affordable and not too pricey unlike other Restaurants who charge you insane amounts for Prawn.
Next came the Magshah Kai Chicken & Shredded Lamb in Honey Chilli Sauce.

The combination of flavours for the Lamb was intense and crazy. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine that Gondhoraj and Thai sweet chilli can cause such an exotic burst of flavours in your Mouth. You gotta try it to believe it.

The last order was supposed to be something else, but my Girl insisted that we order the Chicken Tempura with Teriyaki Sauce. Crunchy on the outside and soft n juicy on the inside. We poured loads of Teriyaki sauce on top of it cause the Hairy Buffalo had started it's charm on the both of us. (LoL).

The spicyness toned down once we ordered the Banoffee Pie (banana & toffee pie) served in a very Cinderella manner.

This place is really a Hidden Gem in Kolkata. I will surely go back to this place Once again and I would SUGGEST you all to check it out as well.

#worthit

Cheers.

Ambiance is soothing: very niche and rejuvenating with good energy.¬†
Drinks are handsomely refreshing.¬†
You get a fine balance of quirk and sophistication; tends to weigh on the sophisticated side.¬†
Very well-trained staff and excellent behaviour.¬†
Thai food as authentic as found in the streets of Thailand. Cleaner if you will.¬†
Price is not too heavy on the pocket.¬†
Overall: Definitely worth visiting again and again!

Once you enter this restaurant what astounds you is the ambience, the oriental Chinese masks, the decor, and the real truck used as a bar counter. I really loved everything about the interior which was so perfect. Now coming to the food, the restaurant mainly specialise in Chinese , Thai and Malaysian delicacies.I laud the management and those in the kitchen for impeccable presentation and palatable food.
Among the starters I tried "Papaya salad" and absolutely loved it. This thai delicacy is my favourite and they did not disappoint. I totally recommend this starter. Another beautiful starter is "Tempura Prawn with Sukiyaki and Teriyaki Sauce", if you love prawn then this is a sure winner. Just loved the coverage and the presentation, which somehow reminded me of bong Kabiraji.
Main dishes
Lemon Chicken- This classic chicken dish was a delight, the gravy had that perfect sweet sour ee taste.
Moon Fan rice- Beautifully prepared rice in soya sauce presented on sizzler tray.
Magshak Pork was served as a condiment to the rice.
The restaurant serves traditional thai curry "kaeng moo" in red , green and yellow varieties. This traditional curry is infused with vegetables, meat, Kaffir lime and lemongrass.
As dessert there was Banofee Pie which is a banana based dessert served with Toffee Sauce.
There is a wide variety of alcoholic and non-veg alcoholic drinks. All the cocktails I tried were worth a try, they were Kaffir lime and green apple Martini, Sweet Thai basil and rambutan Caprisoka,Galangal and Mint .
Located next to Indian museum this place is surely a fine dining paradise.

Calcutta- a place where people hog on tasty street food and loads of sweets. Chinese food is probably their fuel. Well, maybe after Rasgulla. But are Chinese take-outs the beginning and end of our exploration of different Asian cuisines?. The answer is N-O! Our city has recently pulled big guns in the Asian food department. One such major hit is SOI- The Asian Street Kitchen. I was invited by Communications 2.0 to attend a bloggers meet and to taste the restaurant‚Äôs carefully planned-out menu. Here are my detailed thoughts on what I felt about the restaurant and its food items. But before we get into it, given below is a brief write-up on how SOI likes to describe itself¬†and its food:
                                                                ...

Well an interesting and tastefully done place with different ambience in different nooks and corner of this huge place. A part of it is urban setting for young crowd  , a part of it is old  world club charm for people out to enjoy chit chat over drinks and part of it for family get together .
What do I say, have to be honest for me there are four important criterions for success for any restaurants 
1.  Ambience - I would say these guys have done a good job and won't hesitate giving them 4****s. Stars. Hope they maintain it. 

2. Passion - the place is reflection of passion of people who has set up and running it. Set up by two young guys with no background of hospitality, this ranks high. I would say 5*****. Stars. 

3.  Food - undoubtedly food is interesting and different. I quite enjoyed whatever I ate as a vegetarian I love food options and they had it all. So guys here is a 4**** stars. 

4. Service. Though I shouldn't be judging them on these parameters , but this place was booked for a family get together of around 20 people, i felt staff was neither experienced nor equipped to handle this number since we choose not to go for buffet. They need to improve their service hence just a 2.5 stars for this. 

Guys long way to go, I am sure you will be there soon. Good luck and I shall be back to enjoy more food. 
The place is worth a shot, it's pleasantly different and refreshing.

From the time you step in, the ambience sets the tone for a great dining experience. Starters to main course, the food is delicious and lip smacking. And would rate the cocktails, very passionately concocted, as the best available in Kolkata. The owners lend a personal touch with their friendly interactions with the guests.

In Thai, ‚ÄòSoi‚Äô means our very own gullys, rather ‚Äòalleys‚Äô in English. This new sensation has come up this November in New Market Area, sharing the same space with Zaranj which was earlier taken by Jongs at the Sudder Street junction. I would like to thank Communications 2.0 for inviting me at the bloggers‚Äô meet at SOI last Wednesday and have a sneak peek of their widely ranged Pan Asian cuisine focusing mostly on Thai delicacies.

The place is really spacious with a very classy d√©cor. It boasts of two three hundred year old vintage samurai masks and a cute little truck, which is used as the bar, made in France, assembled in India. There‚Äôs another bar as well boasting the classic English architecture. The flamoboyant posters of different cities of East Asia, the table runs made by the specially abled children, all of these will give you a very good vibe of the place.

Next, let‚Äôs come to food. It was brilliant! That‚Äôs all I had to say, in a nutshell. Let‚Äôs see what we got to try at SOI.

Appetizers -

Papaya Salad ‚Äì a classic Thai delicacy. Not my cup of tea as it was too spicy. A shout out to all spicy food lovers to try this out as it was very refreshing and fresh and nice.

Satay Kai ‚Äì Strips of chicken made into satays grilled in peanut sauce. A Malaysian beauty, loved this dish a lot. A bit spicy but the chicken was very tender and well done. The peanut sauce was brilliant with hints of grounded peanuts, not completely moulded to paste. A brilliant one!

Corn Curd Pepper Chilli ‚Äì Cream of sweet corn, fried deeply and served with freshly chopped spring onions and green chillies. Not at all spicy, tasted excellent. A very new thing to my experience. Totally recommended to try.

Tempura Prawn with Sukiyaki and Teriyaki Sauce ‚Äì Jumbo sized prawns, tasted excellent. The tempura batter, although they call it the classic one was very different from the ones I had in Kolkata. Loved the whole concept of it. The Sukiyaki and Teriyaki sauce went very well with the prawns. But I would suggest you to have it with the Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce as I did. It tasted even better. This dish was heaven for all the prawn fanatics. I am still dreaming of it.

Main Course ‚Äì

Lemon Chicken ‚Äì A Chinese dish among all other East Asian beauties, but this was very good. With subtle flavours of lemon at the end, I loved every bit of it.

Moon Faan Rice ‚Äì Rice treated with soya sauce on a sizzling plate, this had very unique flavours. I loved it very much.

Magshah Moo ‚Äì Cubes of pork served with the Moon Faan Rice accompanied each other very well. Loved this combination and the Magshah recipe of the pork dish equally.

Kaeng Moo ‚Äì This is the Traditional Thai Curry with meat, seasonal vegetables, kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass. There were options of lamb and pork. I chose pork. There were options of Phed (Thai Red Curry), Kiew (Thai Green Curry) and Kao Soi (Thai Yellow Curry) as well. I chose the Green Curry as it is the least spicy one. The Kaeng Moo Kiew with pork was so well done. It was so subtle with flavours of Kaffir Lime leaves and Lemongrass. The seasonal vegetables were extremely fresh and the gravy tasted fantastic.

Dessert ‚Äì

Banoffee Pie ‚Äì Not at all a banana fan though, still I loved this dessert. The crackers on top, with toffee blended so well with the banana, it was a masterstoke by the chef.

Drinks ‚Äì

Kaffir Lime and Green Apple Martini

Sweet Thai Basil and Rambutan Caprioska

Galangal and Mint Old Fashioned

Virgin Mojito

All the drinks except the last one were cocktails. I, being a teetotaler tried the virgin versions of the first two and the last one. The drinks were brilliant. Perfect concoctions of flavours, right amount of crushed ice and excellent presentation. Thumbs up for the drinks!

Presentation of all of the dishes was brilliant. The cooking was out of the world. Service by all the staffs was very courteous, friendly and heartwarming. So was the hosting by Communication 2.0 representative Shreya Baid and the owner. I will recommend this place to try to all my friends and relatives. I will come back here again personally for the Corn, Prawn Tempura and the Green Curry. Best wishes to team SOI and Communications 2.0 for future. Happy Dining! :)

Not even a month old but making all the right noises and getting double ticks in all the correct boxes, that is SOI for you. The new Asian street kitchen where you get the complete package of fine dining along with finger licking good food. I was invited for a bloggers meet courtesy Communications 2.0. I truly want to thank them for letting me experience such amazing food. The concept of SOI is that they serve all type of Asian Street food but not in the regular way but with a twist added by them which just takes them to a new level altogether.
                                                                ...

For those missing out on the Thai street food scenes, worry no more! Kolkata opened doors to the Asian Street kitchen at New Market area. Easy to locate, they have parking. Located beside Indian Museum, this place is a blast! The owners are lovely to talk to, they have numerous stories associated with every nook and corner of the restaurant. The place is spik and span and shines brightly!
Kolkata needed this place, kolkatans throng Thailand through the year, and what they miss most on coming back is the awesome Thai cuisine!
This place is your one stop solution...Let's look through the highlights of the evening:

Papaya Salad: The freshest, crunchiest, tangy, spicy papaya salad ever!! The fiery thing burns your tongue and smoke emits from your ears but you still cannot get it away from you. You have to have the entire thing!!

Corn Curd Pepper Chilli: The corn is pureed to an extent where the consistency changes to a curd. Then the corn curd is fried to the perfect crispness yet the inside remains soft. Frisked with some green chillies and chopped spring onions it is the perfect accompaniment with your drink.¬†

Satay Kai: The satay in Thailand does not taste as good as this. Thick chunks of flattened chicken is skewered, mixed with a lot of spices, it is a mouthful of delight served with the perfect peanut sauce.

Tempura Prawn with Sukiyaki and Teriyaki Sauce: a modern take on the tempura. This dish looks more like threaded prawns but the batter is light and crispy. The prawn is neither under fried nor over fried, perfect crispness and chewiness accompanied with their in-house sauce.

Magshah Moo: Cubes of pork served with the traditional Magshah recipe. The sauce is yumm. The taste is varied, it is fresh, and recommended.

Kaeng Moo (red and Green Curry): This is essentially a Thai curry, tried the lamb, pork, and the vegetarian version of the curry. Served with steamed flavored rice in a bamboo basket. The curry is cooked with seasonal vegetables, kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass. the perfect main course on your winter dinner night. Eat it hot! The flavors are mild and served in a make shift candle stove which keeps the curry hot.

Moon Faan Rice: Rice served in a sizzler plate laced with wine which adds the sizzle. Can be teamed with a spicy or mild gravy.¬†

SOI has their amazing offers for liquor brands, look out for them while you order! Our drinks for the evening were:

Sweet Thai Basil and Rambutan Caprioska: The cocktail's a mix of vodka, thai basil, lychee crush and lemon with ice chunks. The perfect cocktail to be sipped on while eating Thai food. They have virgin versions of this as well.

Galangal and Mint Old Fashioned: Whisky, Angostura bitters, fresh galangal, mint, syrup, and sometimes egg white makes the cocktail. Served in a glass which resembles a mason jar to some extent this drink was strong.¬†

A weekday evening converted into a fun filled educative evening, thanks to SOI. Will be visiting them soon!!

Spacious Interiors. A little classier for a street kitchen as it portrays. Unpleasant start to the meal with a hair found in the papaya salad which obviously was changed and charged too. Ran out of Green curry and forcefully had to order a Red Instead. 

Average food and drinks for the overall image which the restaurant has portrayed.

Soi !! Name takes you to bangkok!! 

But sadly the Thai food menu is small. Interiors is average, nothing gr8 and not even bad.... it's nothing to talk about.

We ordered American corn and broccoli Perrier salt, which was good, the sauce which they served with that was excelent. The papaya salad was extremely spicy, and fresh. Spicy how it should be. Most of the people couldn't eat it, but that's how spicy authentic papaya salad is, so if you cannot have too much spice, ask them to make it less spicy, but it's a must try.

We ordered mixed veg, in sweet chilly sauce with steamed rice, and it was excelent. Again people who don't have a taste for sweet vegetables won't like it.

Ordered draft beer, and a mojito, and both of them were very reasonable.

This place is a must visit once. 

They should add more Thai stuff on their menu

They say that the first impression is the last impression...well SOI has completely nailed it. From the presentation of the dishes to the creativity of mocktails/cocktails they have not left any stones unturned to make our dinning experience a memorable one. All of the dishes were spot on and the creativity of the cocktails and cocktails was superb. On the other side the preparation time was a sluggish but nothing too much. The staff is friendly and patient and is always ready with recommendations. Try this joint out and I am sure you would not regret it!!!
