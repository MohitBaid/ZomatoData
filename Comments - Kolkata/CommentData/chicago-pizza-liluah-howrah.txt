I bought a non veg pizza with chicken ham, there was lack of variety. The pizza cost 180 rupees. I asked then the size of the pizza they told me it's 6 inches but when I receiveved it, it was definitely not a 6 inch pizza it was way too small. The taste was average (2.5 out of 5) cheese topping was good and great. But actually was a very thin pizza. It's just average place to go, I had Domino's Pizza a lot of time so I went for this. I rank it for the cheese topping and the taste size and cost wise I would have marked them negative.

Very poor pizza quality with a pretty expensive pricing.. they should work on the taste of the pizza seriously and the price as one can get better pizza downstairs from Domino's at Rangoli mall.. I simply didn't liked the pizza...
