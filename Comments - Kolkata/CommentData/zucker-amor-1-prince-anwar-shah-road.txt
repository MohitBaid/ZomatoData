Ok so I wanted to do something special on my birthday and wanted a break from the boring standard cakes my mum always got me from the local confectionery. After a great deal of net search I came across zucker amor .... The pictures of the cupcakes looked lovely and the bakes looked heavenly.  I decided to go ahead with it and ordered a chocolate cake for myself. This has probably been the best order so far. The layers of different chocolate topped with Ferrero rocher chocolate must have been my best birthday treat ever. Zucher amor sure did spoil me on my b'day.

I had ordered 2 baskets of dark chocolate fudge brownie for this mother's day. My mother is really happy with this gift. The brownies are freshly baked and really tasty. Also, the decoration is quite appealing. I will again order something to 'Zucker Amor' as they are providong good quality service at an affordable rate. People who want something new and creative should try them. :)

ZA is like a carnival, a carnival of cupcakes, cakes, cheesecakes and more. If you have a sweet tooth, you should not miss out on the delectable desserts they make. The cupcakes are ideal for gifts too. I am sure you won't mind receiving one yourself. The cakes taste great, better than most confectioneries in Kolkata. The customised cupcakes come in pretty designs and are a treat for the eyes too. I am in love with these little parcels of joy. The 'cake in a jar' tastes as good as it looks and the red velvet cheesecake is yum. Do give it a try, you surely won't be disappointed.

The single word that describes Zucker Amour is fabulous. I had ordered for a birthday cake for my Mum. Not only did it look amazing with fondant butterflies sitting pretty on a chocolaty nest... The taste was equally delicious. What I liked most was the precision with which it was made. The chocolate nest brought sheer happiness.. ?  keep up with such good taste..

This an innovative idea that we get to see here. ZA creates bundles of joy in all its cupcakes and goodies. They make the best gift to present your loved ones on birthday, weddings, Christmas and any odd occasions where you really fall short of ideas. The cupcakes are just out of the world tasty and highly innovative. I personally loved the peanut butter cupcake. I have also loved the way they are made with no unnecessary preservatives and utmost care is given to each product that will surely not let you complain. The price is on a higher side, but every penny is worth it because you will get all homemade stuff and of the best quality. I will forever be your customer. :)

I have been to a few  countries around the world, namely, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, England and Turkey. Since I have a bit of a sweet tooth, I have tried bakery products in all these countries..and I love different aspects of each. However, in my own city Kolkata, the only authentic desserts I can find are ice creams and traditional bengali sweets. I almost gave up the hope of finding genuinely international standard cakes. The nearest that came to that is Flurys and a few items from the Grand, Taj and ITC Sonar. However, after tasting the cakes of Zucker Amor, I can at last safely say that my search has ended. The cakes are amazingly delicious, soft and moist in a way that you have to close your eyes with joy every time you take a bite. Be it a cup cake, or a Red Velvet, the tastes are simply out of the world. I don't really have enough words in my arsenal to describe the taste, but my fiancee wrapped it up in one sentence: "It is orgasmic". What makes it more special, is that, all the cakes are custom made. So be it a 3D toy train cake, or a Pikachu cake, you'll get whatever you want and you can be rest assured that the taste and the ingredients are top notch. I felt like I am having one of those pieces that they show in Discovery TLC. Taste is something that you have to experience yourself, but being an ardent food lover, I would suggest you to give it a try, because then, you'll be coming back for more. The only problem you might face is that no matter how much you have, you will always want some more. When something is this good, it is safe to say that it is made from the heart. So enjoy..and thank me later. ;)

Very rarely in Kolkata we get a bakery that not only makes home made desserts but also is value for money. 'Zucker Amor' is a one stop bakery for delicious lip smacking cakes,pastries and cupcakes. This bakery usually works on delivery basis and caters to customers on a variety from party orders to baking birthday cakes. It also has exciting themes during festive seasons like 'Pujoer Special' 'Pohela Boishakh Special' and varieties like 'Noler gurer Cupcakes' to made to order 'Breaking Bad Cup Cakes'. 

Pocket Pinch: keeping in mind that the baker uses home made ingredients and makes it herself the cost is reasonable.

Verdict:If you are looking for customized pure home made desserts made from pure ingredients this is the perfect place for you.
