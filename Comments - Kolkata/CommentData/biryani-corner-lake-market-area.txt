This is a small eating joint.  Setting area also very small.  A good option for takeaway. The egg chicken chowmein was good in taste.  The quantity also good enough for two people. Also the prices are pocket friendly.

Hello foodizens,
This is one of those place that I thought wont be here on zomato and I forgot to click pictures..but the food is amazing!!
Came here on the insistence of a friend as she said the food is pretty good.
Small friendly place with limited seating and a kitchen always busy with food smelling so good! This place makes hearty in the mouth tasty food!!
Previously ordered chicken egg roll various times and enjoyed it,popping hot and tasty.
Steamed momo- might be on par with the Tibetan joints!! Big in size thin shell with slight oil brushes and STUFFED with chicken well seasoned and juicy 
Fried momo - piping hot right amount of crisp and again stuffed with well season chicken
The momos come with complementary clear broth chicken stalk soup with little noodles in it and egg water poached -very very hearty.
Chicken egg chowmein half plate-this is not half plate its a little less than a full plate!wok fried and crunchy with chicken and egg and with veggies.so in a nutshell-

Ambience -you go with a friend to chat less and eat more seriously its for food hogging so won't rate it,so if you want a quite wind time do a take away.

Food-3.5/5 amazing, hearty,warm,fresh and alll the goodness of flavour and taste, might be a little on d oily side depending on what you are accustomed too and order.

Cleanliness-3/5 its a small joint family run with bus boys for cleaning so they do a pretty good job.

Service -4/5 swift and efficient from putting a cold bottle of water on your table to serve the food so hot that the server is sweating its almost rather amazing to see.

Value for money-4/5 the steamed momo and fried momo along with half plate chicken egg fried rice was all for Rs-190 .
 only downfall its summer the heat wont be a respite for you in the joint if not for the giant fans , there either is an ac section or about to be one soon.
Sorry for the lack of pictures bit know how good the food was will be going back some time again ...!

The food here is cheap, yet good. The seating area is too small, hardly fits 10 people and the fans aren't properly working and it sometimes gets too hot inside but it's a good place to grab a quick bite on the go, it's pocket friendly and also hygienic. I'll give it a go if you're wanting to have good food in a modest budget.

visited once under little app offer, but it was a mixed experience,  took chicken biryani, chicken do piyaja, taste was ok, not to rave about, service was also ok. its very small restaurant & ambience was very poor and dirty. would not recommend

রাসবিহারী ক্রসিং এর কাছে ছোট্ট দোকান । কাছ দিয়ে গেলেই বিরিয়ানির গন্ধ নাকে হানা দ্যায় । তবে খেয়েছিলাম চিকেন রোল । গরম , টাটকা ও সুস্বাদু । দামে সস্তা ।

Located at Rashbehari crossing and is easy to locate. It's a small takeaway joint. Their rolls are decent in taste and not very spicy. Haven't tried anything else yet.

Biryani Corner is at the Rasbihari Crossing. The Biryani here really good. Had their Chicken Biryani for Rs.130. The rice was fine and Chicken piece was good in size. The potato also tasted very good.
They also serve Chowmine and Rolls. People seems to love their Rolls much, as per the reaction of my friend who had Chicken Roll from here and it much.
Good and reasonable price.

The other items of this place is good but the name "Biriyani corner" does not satisfy the place. In short they need to improve the taste of biriyani.
