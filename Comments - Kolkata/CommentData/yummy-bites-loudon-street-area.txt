This is a very small stall serving only veg munchies. One day while I was craving pasta but didn't have enough money this place came to my rescue. Reaching the place, I wasn't much satisfied by the outlook and didn't give a thought of trying the 'Masala Pasta'. Instead, I ordered the Masala Maggi. The taste was Â as usual, nothing extra ordinary. Nothing would happen if you come here or not. That's it.

Yummy Bites is a small sandwich takeaway located of Kookie jar on Rawdon street. They offer a huge variety considering the space the eatery occupies.

The sandwiches are made in a hygienic manner. Each sandwich comes in white bread and brown bread options.

There is an option of eating there itself against the car park on the opposite end of the road. But there's too much traffic and in this monsoon time insects so I'm not cool with that option.

My takeaway order consisted of :

Mexican sandwich
Veggie cheese
American corn bell pepper sandwich  combo with French fries

The sandwich size is quite big and each sandwich comes inclusive of ketchup and a generous helping of plain potato chips.

There are upgrade to combo options where I can add a soft drink or French fries by just adding Rs 10.

They serve variations of Maggi, wai wai and pasta. They have options of Nachos, soups and beverages also.

The person at the counter is very pleasant and most menu options were available.

Taste wise the sandwiches were really good. The packaging was neat, order completion time was quick despite being rush hours.

The American corn and bell pepper one was my favourite of the lot. Considering the pricing each of these sandwiches were between Rs 60-70, they are super value for money.

A small veg take away counter just beside our college.
Definitely beats the over-priced food junctions there.
From the quality to the quantity, this small express is very much reliable!
