Gangaur sweets is located in Park Street, opposite of Bombay Dying showroom. I visited here to try few sweets. Each were excellent in taste. We tried their Son Papri and Chocolate Sandesh, both were really good. Prices were high. Not pocket friendly.

Gangaur Sweets a a popular junction in Russel Street for Sweets. They are much known for their quality and taste. I visited this outlet and tried a few.
The Chocolate Sandesh with choco chips above was completely delicious. It was priced at Rs.65.
Then the Kaju Barfi which I really liked 
Then had a San Papri which was Rs.26 and very good. I haven't had sanpapri so good.
Rose Sandesh was another very good and tasty Sandesh here.
Pocket pinch was really high. Four sweets costed us around Rs.150. But each of them were so good in taste that I don't regret spending that 150 bucks.

Have had sweets from this shop innumerable times.....this shop has been around now for a long time. If you place bulk orders, maybe for festivals like Diwali or Holi , or even for weddings and engagements, they take great care. Moreover their mithai ( sweets) are really good, top notch quality. They specialise in Kaju barfi, ladoos and other such north Indian sweets. Of course they also have a variety of sandesh too. I specially like their dil kushar barfi. Hygiene and ambience is good. Though the prices are on the steep side.

This place is mainly known for the variety of sweets they serve.It's a quite large,clean and properly maintained place where you will find all major variety of sweets and snacks.We went there for some diwali sweets shopping and were completely bowled by the taste of the sweet.Before buying they let you taste each sweet you want to buy which shows its excellent service and hospitality.We had-
1:Gulab ladoo(Must try)
2:Dil kushar
3:Rosgulla
4:Kajukatli
5:Matar puffs.

Food-4.5/5
Service-4/5

Though the prices of the items are bit high but they are worth it.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

Big, clean and hygienic place, but these people suffer from superiority complex. They cater mostly to people placing bulk orders, and hence casual passer-by, like me, you or someone else would be shunned away and neglected as if the person does not exist! The quality here has not been consistent as well. The prices are too steep, and does not make sense for any normal person to spend extra money here than any other medium-priced popular sweet shop! Had dropped in once or twice to try their laddoos and some other sweets, but did not revert back again seeing their sheer lack of professionalism!

First of all, I fail to understand why they do not place price tags in the sweets' counter.Â 

Secondly, the staff is totally indifferent. I agree with one of the previous reviews that unless you buy in huge quantities, the staff will not pay attention. They will simply ignore you. This is the worst part.

Coming to the sweets, the taste & quality are excellent.

Price: Pretty high.

An awesome sweet shop not very popular to masses but people who had from here I bet will surely gonna come back again and again.

**Location**
Bylane of Russel Street which the road right opposite to park hotel.

**Experience**
As soon as I entered this place I noticed it's clean and kept very organized. They have a huge collection and variation in sweets and snacks. Starting from the general ones to special ones too. I loved their designed hampers where they have kept a huge variation.
Kaju Barfi ** is the must try item. After my first bite I was bowled over totally and loved it totally. Pricing is on the higher side but worth it totally. Loved them and do recommend. Will surely gonna come back and try more.

The sweets were nothing more than average. The staffs portrayed a very unprofessional behaviour. The prices they are charging is a little more in comparison with to the quality. There is lot of space for improvements.

this place stands out amongst all other sweet shops in the city!
the variety they serve is quite different from other shops
over the years many shops have tried to copy their signature sweets and failed
remains one the favourites of all time
