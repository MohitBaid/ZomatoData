The ambience is quite good! You have to be selective about food to get the good one.... The location is the plus point of this bar... Charges are ok as well....

This review is based on my many years back food experiences to this restaurant. 
I had visited this restaurant many times but the car parking problem in New market area compelled me to stop visiting this restaurant this is an old restaurant who are serving tasty food, I like it's paneer masala and laccha paratha. This restaurant also serves alcohol. Service was good with very average decor.

One of the oldest restuarents in the new market area. People used to flock to this place. But it has lot it's sheen over time. 
Last time I visited I was amazed to find a shoddy crowd that almost prompted me and my family to exit this place. 

Nontheless I don't think this is something about which the restuarent management can do anything specific. 

Moving to the foods:
Chicken dopiyaza and chicken tikka butter masala goes well with the butter naan (you will find a limited menu options - but whatever is available is pretty much standard)

And if you are in for a drink them definitely complement your beer/whisky with drums of heaven and fish pakora, well prepared and deep fried. 

All in all this place has evolved form a family restuarent to a full fledged bar!!!

This used to be a nice little Vegetarian joint. Nice thalis and decent Idlis and dosas aswell. Over the years it has changed and is now a snookey little bar--a bit seedy and besides the usual beer and stuff the food is no great shakes. Walked into it for old times sake but after a quick beer left. The old charm,high ceiling with the lazy large fans and easy paced service is all gone and so are we !!!

Hindustan , Restaurant & Bar, located near New market. Not very hard to found. Yesterday I went at lunch time. Ordered for beer. I found their beverage menu was not good enough. Don't have much option for the mock tails. Then we ordered for the food, Black dal, roti and chicken bharta. From my personal experience, most of the restaurant I found they prepare roti with refine flour, which is actually not, here i found the same. dal was ok, chicken bharta was not authentic. Ambiance was not so good. This kind of outlet really need to focus on their ambiance and food and beverage. Service was nice, and the staff curtsy also.

This place is near New Market (Lindsay Street). The interior is little dark but it looks nice with the led lights. We had ordered Kingfisher Beer which was chilled and they served Bhujia along with it. The price was little high. The ambience & staffs were fine.

I had been here ages before but I still can't forget the taste..... Chinese is amazing here ... Wat's best is the chilly mushrooms n babycorn dry, now this sounds quite normal and is available in every other Chinese restaurant but the way this simple dish is made here is mindblowing

The problem is, although food is delicious here, you will find the waiters very rude. Their veg preparations are delicious. Non veg preparations are not that too good. Parking is a big pain.

Used to go there when we were school going kids.
Never asked for id's.
Haven't been there quite a long time.
No plans going there soon.
As far as I remember food price was a bit on the higher side.
However they did offer a discount during the happy hours.

One of the last pubs of Kolkata that i visited before leaving the city, the place has some really fond memories. Went their with a group of old friends and after a really long hot day,the place really came as a refuge.
beer menu is quite shallow though with a very few options available,however if you don't swear by your beer brand, you wouldn't mind that much. The drinks and food are quite pocket friendly and it is advisable to try out their kabab menu as it is quite good. The service isn't out of the world however the management is quite friendly.All in all a cozy place to go if you are with a bunch of friends and looking to go light on the pocket.

Went there the last time when we had a small reunion of school friends. The prices were on a bit higher side though the food quality was quite good. They give a 15% discount on drinks before 5 or 6 pm in the evening (just forgot the exact time), tough ultimately they didn't give it and we overlooked it :P
Had Chicken Reshmi Kababs and Carlsberg Beer upfront and then Butter Nun with Chicken Bharta in the main course. No complains with the food though the quantity is a bit on the lower side as compared to the listed prices. The staff there is very polite and gave a warm welcome. I guess they have an exclusive bar too as there was a room from where some hard music where coming sometimes. The place lacked on the decor and the place is a little less spacious but overall we had a nice experience there.

A good place that had some amazing vegetarian dishes on the menu along with the non vegetarian.

Slightly on the expensive side, but impeccable service with a wide range of aloo dishes as well as different version of methi mutter malai. Don't know if they still do?
