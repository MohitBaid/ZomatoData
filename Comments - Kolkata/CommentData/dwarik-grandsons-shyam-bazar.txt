I bet you won't get better Rabdi & Mishti Doi than this, anywhere in North & Central Kolkata. Its definitely a bit costly but that's worth it since, it's very authentic in taste & not much adulterated. Lots of tongue-licking sweets to die for! A must visit if you are crazy for Bong Sweets. :)

Dwarik's sweets are still lingering in my mouth. What can I say  . . . I've very fond memories with it . .  After coming from school I used to wait for my mom . .when she'll come from work and when she will give me the sweets she used to brought from it from there. I still like them and always will I guess.

A well known sweet shop of North Kolkata near Bagbazar Bata. Affordable and varieties of sweets are available. I tried Misti Doi here... tastes good all over. Being a sweet lover, I will definitely try their other mistees.  :-)

Pretty average experience. The sweets are good enough to pick up a 4.0 rating. The service is also pretty good. The rates are very low. Keep up the good work.

Dwarik has an old heritage and legacy of its own in terms of Bengali desserts. It has many branches . Located in shyambazar, a traditionally rich place has added a special bongo charm in it.
They have a vast variety of sweets with showcasing price tag. I just love their rabri , rosomalai , and a variety of sondesh like choco sondesh, pesta sondesh etc.
Quality of sweets is very good.
Staffs are good with good service and nice bongo ambience.
A must visit for sweet lovers.

"Dwarik Grandsons" happen to be one of the oldest pillars of the traditional Misti culture of Bongs, and a name worth mentioning, if the old sweetmeat shops of North Kolkata are taken into account.

So if you are at Shyambajar, and looking forward to savour your sweet tooth with some sweet cravings, a check in at 'Dwarik Grandsons' will not disappoint you.
 From the wide range of sweets & snacks, you can select your pick, and enjoy some mellifluous notes rolling down your tongue.

A very nice option to try out some delicious sweets and snacks, be it to fulfill your Misti cravings, or a sudden hunger pang.

Having my coaching classes near this, I happen to pass by this sweet shop almost once a week. What made me give a 4 rating to this small sweet shop is their rabri, which I brought home for my family. And the best part was that they liked it so much that they finished it without leaving anything for me. This made me curious to know the x factor in the rabri that made my family so crazy for it. I brought another one next day and had it all by myself. And this was the one which I had been craving for ages, a typical rabri which I had tasted long back, which took me to me childhood days. This is so yummy that it can't be shared. Would suggest everyone to try their rabri atleast for once

It was one of my favourite sweet shops during my college life at RGKar Medical College. Rabri, chocolate sandesh , Monohora ,jolvora and makha sandesh were my favourite. Yesterday I revisited this place. Quality remains as good as before. 
They always maintain cleanliness, that's a plus point .

I cannot but be a bit partial towards all the misitir dokans. This one, is however deserves a good rating. They do not have much that is very famous, but whatever they have are excellent. The rabri, various sandesh (the usual and a few innovative ones), the various rosher misti, all are very good

This is one of the very old sweet shops here in Shyambazar region. From my very childhood m seeing this place better never had a chance to visit this place for a try. This time i was all set to go.¬†
An average ambiance where you can only take away and stand and eat. The price tags are been displayed in the front for your ready references. With so many sweet varieties been displayed in the front you got to be get confused what to choose and what to leave.
Tried their few of their sweets in forms of Rasmalai, Sugar Free Sandesh and chocolate sandesh. The quality of every sweet was good. seemed to me very fresh. Prices are very pocket friendly.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

1 OF THE BEST MISHTIS @ AFFORDABLE PRICE....

* Location - From Shyambajar 5 point crossing towards Bagbazar Bata.... Very well known, everyone knows the sweet shop.

* Ambience - All age old sweet shops are bigger than usual. This shop is not any exception. There sweet racks are huge where many different varieties of all types of sweets and its price tags are displayed. Beside the display,you can consume their usual breakfast and mishti standing yourself in the shop. Always busy,good view for any mishti lover.

* Sweets : They make all different types of sweets ranging from Rabri to Kora pak er Taal sans and from  Roso malai to Pesta sandesh.
This time I took......
              1.  Pesta sandesh which is very soft, light, perfectly sweeted and delicious. ( rating 10 on 10)
              2. Yellow flavoured sandesh toping with malai (‡¶∏‡¶∞) is my all time favourite. Any adjective falls short to describe the aroma and taste of this sweet. (rating 10 on 10)
             3. ‡¶õ‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶∞ gol sandesh is another hit from shop. The sweet is made by pure and fresh ‡¶õ‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶æ‡•§ So you can imagine how much soft it can be. (rating 9 on 10)
              4. Cadbury sandesh is also very tasty. Like any other cadbury sandesh producers, the taste is similar but the price is less. (rating 8 on 10)
               5. Babu sondesh is a super hit item in this outlet. you ll fing a pure cadbury ball at the center of the sondesh. Its all very light, soft and tasty sweet item. (rating 10 on 10)
               6. Radhaballavi and alur dom is a hot item of this sweet shop. it comes in the shop every morning at 9 (more or less 600 pieces according to the sales men) and it is finished at about 10.30am. So you can imaging how tasty is this. No health issue ll do even if you consume their radhaballvi even in this heated weather. (rating 9 on 10)

* Price This I want to say to every sweet lovers. you ll not get such a quality sweets @ this much low price. Its quite affordable to every kind of classes.

* Management : Every selling staffs are well mannered and they know how to manage a very popular sweet shop in North kolkata. Only one ‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßÅ ( I ve been seeing him selling sweets for 20 yrs) is a slight rude and rough type. But it is justified always, no issues. (rating 9 on 10)

* Recommended : Rosomalai.
                               kaju roll.
                               All kind of ‡¶®‡¶∞‡¶Æ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∞ sondesh.
                               Rosogolla.
                                Rabri.

Located near the 5 point crossing Shyambazar (towards Baghbazar).

The entrance is properly made and it's comparatively clean than the other sweet shops in North Kolkata, that I've witnessed.
The sweets are good to taste. The best of this place is Radhaballavi (and the Aloo Dum, of course !)
It tastes so great. It's pocket friendly too.

If you pack the food, they would do it properly.
Overall, it's nice for sweet lovers to visit (along with others). :D

when it comes to taste, there's nothing to remember. . .

I've been there in this puja,¬†
and yes... there was a varieties of Sweets and almost all of them are traditional items..
I've taken some traditional items (Sar-vaja, Kalo-jam, Golap-jam)..
but I was really disappointed with the tastes...

to describe in single word I barely can say it's Good..but nothing special as the Glory and pubicity . . .

Dwariks is another Bengali mishti brand which though renowned in years gone by has lost a lot of its glamour and for that matter quality also.This outlet in shyambazar is probably the original dwariks and the one still worth a try.The Dwariks branch in jadu bazar near my place is on the verge of a slow demise.
Coming to the food,i tried their radhaballavi which was decent but not served hot.It was microwaved.Among the sweets they offer the more traditional Bengali sweets.The issue here is that some of the stuff are sometimes old stock.Most of the sweets are nice when fresh but there are no guarantees that you will get fresh stuff.The kalo jam and the rasgollas are the sweets here that i particularly liked.
The prices are more or less moderate.The staff may appear a bit disinterested at times.Overall this is a very old Bengali mishti shop which has deteriorated over the years and at present is just about average.

The sweets are ok. There is nothing great about the taste. I bought misti doi from Dwarik and the yoghurt was bad! The customer service is pathetic. There is always a problem of loose change In Dwarik. They are ready to lose their customer but will never change. So if you plan to visit the shop make sure you have change or be ready for humiliation.
