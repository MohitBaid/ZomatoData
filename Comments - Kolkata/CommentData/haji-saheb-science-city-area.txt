Not bad. Not good either. Prices are cheap and consequently quality of food is not up to the mark. Not at all recommended. A lot better is expected from the brand "Haji Saheb"

The food is playing. Not that great. But prices are cheap and the quality and quantity are decent. It's a small place for a small price. So not that bad

Had got our food packed here once from here because all other places were closed. Got some Paratha along with Chicken Kosha. Food was okay. Nothing great but tasted good as we were too hungry.

This Outlet is located in D.C dey road which is near to active acres, science city area. We ordered their chicken hakka chowmein and it was good in taste and also tried their fried chicken momo which was really good in taste.
