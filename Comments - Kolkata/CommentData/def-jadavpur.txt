A small shop near Jadavpur Railway station. This place serves chinese food which are quite reasonable in price considering the quantity they provide. I went there with my friends after college to have some momo. We ordered 2 plates of chicken steam momo, 1 chicken fried momo and 1 crispy chilly baby corn. Each plate of momo has 5 pieces in it but the size was bigger than your average momo. Also they provided soup with all the 3 plates of momo. The crispy chilly baby corn was a bit different from the standard schezwan taste but tasted good. A nice place to chat and have snacks or even have a heavy meal too.

The only dish u can get good here is chilli chicken and chilli fish. We ordered hakka noodles, that was not so good, also ordered mixed vegetable with button mushroom, that was also not good in taste.

This restaurant is located near our college and I heard a lot about it from my friends.
I have been there thrice.I really like their chinese items.
Also,the prices are reasonable and quantity is sufficient.
It is like any small restaurant with ordinary sitting arrangements.
I had their mixed noodles,egg noodles and chicken noodles.
Noodles is a must try here.
Also,the chilli baby corn,Chilli prawn and fish mandarin are mention worthy. ðŸ˜Š

Good place for affordable Chinese food. I have been having delicacies from here since I was a child. It's located near the jadavpur level crossing near jadavpur station. This time we had 2packets of Hong kong chicken fried rice and 1packet of chilli fish for my dad's birthday. It came within 500. The Hong Kong fried rice was different in taste. Delicious with a slight spicy after taste. 1 packet is enough for 2. Chilly fish was tender and succulent. It melts into your mouth and leaves a sombre flavour. Good place for treat.
