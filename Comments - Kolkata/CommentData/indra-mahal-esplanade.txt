One of my fav places for kulfi since childhood. Today on a nostalgia trip took my son to enjoy the kulfi there and also bought some sweets.. The kesar falooda kulfi was awesome as usual.. Bought gajar ka halwa, my ever fav shonpapri, mung dal sweets.. Loved the shonpapri as usual. The other sweets were also quite tasty. The gajar ka halwa on the lighter side on sweetness meter and dry. Not recommended at all.. Sticking to kulfi and shonpapri is safe i guess.

Indramahal was a place I used to visit  everytime we came for shopping with my parents in esplanade since I was a child.though it didn't remain an everytime visiting place when I grew up but I come here time to time to have that nostalgic feeling of eating masala dhosas with mom and having a kulfi faluda and sharing with my elder brother or sometimes just to eat the hot and delicious Gulab jamun served directly from the kadai to my plate..So yah you definitely should try these three things if you come here and many other dishes too. it's in the Central location of Esplanade...They also have a separate sitting area in the backside which is completely air conditioned.but one thing because of its immense popularity you may have to wait to get a sit. Service is good ,price is cheap.so it's a good place to get a little rest in between or after shopping

The place is really good for snacks and tiffins . Everyone can visit this place as it is purely veg . Tried Dahi Vara , Chana bathura ,Raj kachuri, rose lassi and mango lassi ...Visited this place more than 2 times and loved it because the price is not high .

Not good enough, though the  store looks great from the outside, something lacks in the food, the taste, quality is so_so, but dhosa and the chola bhatora lacks some decent taste , doi bada is ok, 
Pocket friendly though, but not good enough

Well I have been to this place like 100 times, and will also go further. Situated just in the crossing of esplanade, this place serves some lipsmacking south indian dishes, along with chola batura, kulfi, lassi and sweets. Lots of varieties to choose from. Try out the kulfi its great, and also the mixed chat.

 But last week I tried their Masala Dosa for the first time.It was sub standard. Lack of cleanliness is an issue. 
But over all, the experience was not disappointing. Specially when u get the bill, u ll understand how cheap it is!!üòÅ

Everything is substandard. The chaat items are awful, they even look gross. The reluctant behaviour of the waiting staff is irritating. They don't bother to clean up the table of the previous patrons even after repeated reminder. Mango lassi is not lassi with mango but even in mango season they use artificial flavour.

This place was a "must-go" during my childhood days especially during Durga Pujo shopping. I can distinctly remember I used to be crazy about their Dhosa and Kulfi.

Gone are those days. The craziness of the taste buds changed too. But Indra Mahal (?) is still there to serve you with many more than just Kulfi and dosa. This place is situated near the Chowronghi exit of the Esplanade metro. Been there a couple of times this week and the experiences were not very good.

I tasted their Chana Bhatura, masala dosa and Kulfi. Chana Bhatura was served very hot but was way too oily. Chana lacked any sort of flavour so was the aachar. The dosa was average to my liking and nothing was special about it. There are better dosas that you can get in Kolkata. The Kulfi was perhaps the best of this lot. It had balanced flavour and most importantly it was tasty. But I believe that I had tasted better Kulfies here in older days.

The service was good and prompt. The place was quite clean too. You can git this place a try to taste their Kulfi and lassi.

My colleague and I had once ordered Raj Kachouri, but were quite disappointed with it. Both of us had tasted the same snack at Tewari Brothers, and the difference in their qualities was stark. On another occasion we had gone for kulfi topped with falooda, which was at par with other eateries.

Today i went to this outlet and i never had raj kachori chat. So i had one. It was really good but spicy. If you dont like spicy food then don't have this. Other than that it was quite cruncy and full of different flavours. The location is very easy. Its beside esplanade metro station. And ambience is moderate. Its a non ac spot . We also had a masala dosa which was also good. The service is fast and price is cheap. Hope to visit again.

though I am giving pics of only 3 of the menus but have tried a lot of things from Indramahal like papri chat,singhara,khasta kachori,chana bathura,vegetable pulao and various kinds of Dhosas,kulfi. actually every time whenever I go for shopping in Esplanade and start to feel hungry,the first restaurant comes in mind is indramahal and then KFC comes and trust each of the items are really tasteful rather can say foods are excellent. Service is also good. & environment of this and uniform of their members make it more traditional.

If you want to befuddle yourself with good food at an economical price, Indra Mahal is the place. I have been going to this place since childhood. Their raj kachori, chhole bhatura and kulfi are indeed amazing. However a recent visit made me concerned about the hygiene factor. The premises of this place was unkempt, with bits of food particles here and there, things were kind of shabby. If they dote on cleanliness, Indra Mahal can revive its lost glory as a good food joint in the Esplanade area.

Indra Mahal is located at Esplanade which serves snacks mainly. ¬†In all my visits, I have had tasted various types of Chaats - Papri, Mix, Raj Chaori, Singhara and I liked them all. Papri and Mix Chaats are among the best they prepare. I also tried Dahi Vada which is literally fascinating. ¬†The Chana Batura is great but not the best. A few walks away near the Citi Mart will fetch you more delicious Cola Baturas. However, the Singhara served with Chutney is recommended as it will keep you amazed.

Ambience is ok as the surrounding is always crowded and noisy . Sitting arrangement is there.

Quick service and nice staffs.

Tried Dahi vada, Kulfi and singaara. All 3 items were palatable. Singaara with chutney combination was very relishing. Kulfi was highly enjoyable.Dahi vada was soft and tasty.

Pocket pinch is low .

A nice place to satisfy hunger pangs.

Indra Mahal is located in one of the busiest part of the city being the hub for bargain marketing. It attracts enormous crowds despite its shabby ambiance.

I happen to visit this particular place quite a few amount of times and generally liked it. However, the tables are always unclean though the people tries to clean it every now and then. The order delivery is fastest and they never ever mix up with order even after facing large amount of customers.

In all my visits, I have had tasted various types of Chaats - Papri, Mix, Raj Chaori, Singhara and I liked them all. Papri and Mix Chaats are among the best they prepare. I also tried Dahi Vada which is literally fascinating. The Dhosas are not too worthy of praise but I liked the ¬†Masala Dosa and the Onion Dosa was kind of pathetic. The Chana Batura is great but not the best. A few walks away near the Citi Mart will fetch you more delicious Cola Baturas. However, the Singhara served with Chutney is recommended as it will keep you amazed. I strongly advise you to try Kulfi which will keep you satisfied.

A Visit is Recommended.

Situated near esplanade metro gate no. 1 & 2. Sweets and desi snacks outlet. Situated in main market so always crowded with shoppers but they manage to maintain the place clean and arrangement of sitting tables properly. There is nothing to say about Ambience but hospitality was good. Service was quick and presentation was average. Price was a bit high. In this visit I tried their Paneer roll and paneer chop both were true desi, spicy, fresh and tastes very tasty. And I also tried their rose lassi which was refreshing and very Delicious.

They serve some cool and decent kulfi and flavoured lassi.
 Their DAHI BORA is good. Chaats are so so.
CHOLA BATORA: Puri is much oily and amount of chola is low.
DOSA: dosa is OK, but the sambar and chutney is not up to the mark.
They also serve sweets. GULAB JAMUN, SHON PAPRI ( made of ghee) are worth trying.

Indra Mahal is the best place to have a quick grab of snacks after a hectic road-side shopping in Esplanade. The place does not have an AC yet is airy and spacious. However, the set-up is not well maintained and the decor have become rustic due to the lack of maintenance down the ages.
My recommendations for this place are Dahi Vada, Masala Dosa and Gajar Ka Halwa (During winters). The Chole Bature has the chole diluted and lacks proper punch of the spices. The Gajar Ka Halwa is one of the best I have ever had over there. All in all, a must try if you generate a cheap yet tasty foodgasm.

It's a very old joint in Esplanade. I remember coming here with my father.  But the quality of food has really come down a lot in recent years.  This place is good to take a quick bite. Dosa's here are famous but I decided  to give chana bhatura a try. I found it rather disappointing. It was very oily and the chana had no taste. The lassi saved my day. It was perfect in taste.  So i would recommend not to go for chana bhatura have  dosa instead.

A sweet shop with availability of some South and North Indian veg dishes. Have large sitting arrangements...we ordered one masla Dosa,Dahi bara,Raj kochuri,dhokla and lassi at the end. The Dosa was just made,served hot but the sambar and chutney was watery. The dhokla tasted good. Dahi bara and rajkochuri was okayish. I loved the lassi only. Had two glasses of it. The prices are really cheap and their service was fast. Overall a so so place.

Located adjacent to esplanade metro(gate no5). Old most veg joint in Kolkata. Offers decent food at very reasonable prices. Not a very great ambience but the food-they absolutely delights your taste buds. The lassi,mango lassi, dosa,ESP cheese dosa,kulfi... A must visit.. :)

May be the place is not so good like the other restaurants but being a South Indian food lover,I am pretty impressed by the food which we get here. Whenever I go to esplanade, I always drop by this store, to have dosa.  And it is tasty and the price is also okay.  The sambhar vada and gulab jamun are equally good.

Veggies paradise...but for die hard non veg fans like me it bleeds to shell out the bucks for a veg dish....though a lassi or a coolfi with faluda is worth a try. ..

Located at a stone‚Äôs throw distance from Anadi Cabin, Indra Mahal is one of the oldest chaat joints of Kolkata. With all items priced below 50 rupees, this place serves a variety of vegetarian delicacies meant for the soul. Order a plate of Mixed Chat or Dahi Kachori and pair it up for a flavored Lassi or Kulfi. Their South Indian fare is great too, and I also like their Lemon Sodas. In short, this is a place for the explorers, just grab the menu and order what captures your imagination. The quality is awesome and the flavors are delectable, so no need to worry there. And of course, even a 100 rupees limit will not be threatened unless you are full to the brim.

Mum and Dad swore by their chana batura and kulfi. And how right they were! A small place just opposite to esplanade metro gate( near the grand hotel) this one is definitely "old is gold".
It's not much in terms of decor or ambience yet clean. But the chhole bature, lassi and kulfi-faluda will more than compensate. For south indian spread, the butter onion dosa is a good option- the dosas are thin and crisp and low on the oil. The uttapam is worth mentioning as well.
Staff may need to be reminded about your order especially during rush hour. Prices are easy on the pocket.

Love this place! Have been visiting Indra Mahal ever since I was a kid, and continue to do so whenever I'm in the vicinity of Dalhousie. The samosas are the best in the city; the kulfi hits the right spot in the summer month; the raj kachoris are mouthwatering; the gajar haluas and the sohan haluas that are served in winter make the season worth waiting for. I would really recommend this place, if one wants a hearty meal which is affordable and filling. Service is great (one can't expect too much for that price range); the waiter Makhan is ever-ready with a smile.

Near the Esplanade Metro, it's a vegetarian food joint. We tried masala dosa, it was served with samber & chutney and tasted good. We wanted to taste dhokla, idly, but it wasn't available. A moderate place, u can try it after getting tired in shopping in Dharmatala area :)

They've got decent space in such a prime location, in my opinion they should start thinking about using it in some better way if possible. (eg. A renovation of the interior)¬†
This is my go-to place for Lassi in Esplanade area, you can't complain about what you get at 20.
Apart from that, I've tried some sweet items and they were decent in taste.

Indramahal is a cheap and affordable restaurant in esplanade near peerless inn. It offers tasty chats at a very pocket-friendly rate. Have been there twice and had lassi which has a decent taste and as the lassi is not made in mixer, the taste has an earthy feeling. Next comes the raj kachori. Sweet,tangy,salty,spicy this item is one of the best this place offers. The kachori is much-muche and the size is good too. Good quality and hygiene.

Indra Mahal has been around for ages..One of the oldest vegetarian eateries in the vicinity..together with Rallis this place has been a pop pick for some quick filling value for money foods as well as some healthy juices and lassi to accompany.. Sadly Rallis shut down a few years ago so this place remains as a sole hunter to provide economical and tasty veg dishes like Chhole Bhatura, Variety of Chats and South Indian delicacies in a more or less hygeinic set-up,all in all something quite unique and rare in the vicinity and for those regular office goers and shoppers in Esplanade area..I would recommend their chats: Rajkachori, Singhara chat or Tikia chat are absolutely finger licking..pocket pinch is nominal..But keep in mind the ambiance is not at all sophisticated and quite noisy all the time..

Been here twice due to their offering of food at cheap rates. I have had the following during my 2 time visit:-

1. Lassi= Tastes ok & served chilled which makes it comfortable during hot days

2. Chana Batura= Hot & big puris served with batura,onion & achar. The puris are very oily & the baturas are average. Achar & onion seemed a bit stale due to their lacklustre taste.

3. Masala dosa= They make tasty dosas & the veggie mixture provided also tastes great & fresh as well.

The service is very fast & prices are cheap as well which makes this place so crowded almost the entire day

My friends and I were very tempted when we saw the jumbo-sized bnodes from outside but when I finally tasted it, it was nothing like what we had imagined. It was dry and crunchy and not that sweet either. It looked like bonde but did not have any juice in it, was not soft, and I did not like it.

Indra Mahal has been one of my favourite quick food joints ever since my friend introduced it to me 5years back. And then I came to know that my father too had been a frequenter here. That goes on to show how this eaterie has been serving through generations. The primary reason behind this is the service. If you want something to totally blow you out of your senses then this is not the place, frankly. But if you want decent food at decent price after a tired shopping session, or after your classes, then you need not go any farther. Though it serves veg dishes only, the items are enough to satiate your hungry tummy. At peak hours one can even see foreigners clicking their way through huge dosas. I think that makes the little joint an international hit! Okay, that was a bit exaggerated.

Surprisingly found this affordable place offering South Indian dishes in Kolkata, and not just handful but 80% of menu covers them. So we got onion masala dosa & raj kachori for ourselves. Dosa and chutney were quite authentic, however sambhar was not upto the mark. Raj kachori was okay nothing worth mentioning. 
This place is pretty much crowded and it's hard to find sitting place even during late afternoon.

Just at the junction of esplanade,Kolkata a popular snack food joint.Indra Mahal boasts of being one of the oldest restaurants in esplanade.It has both A/C and regular seating spaces with slight price variants in terms of taxes.Menu includes south indian and north indian spreads,sweets,lassi,syrups and kulfi. Last time I went for masala dosa nad papri chaat.Pricing is affordable but food taste is average.Service is prompt but getting a place to seat is a problem many times as its a busy place.Recommended for quick snack desires.

Today was my first day at the Indra Mahal and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the local vibe here due to their nice street food cuisine. Couldn't take any pictures sadly due to me forgetting to bring along my cell phone but, oh well.

The place looked pretty fuming with people from the outside due to it being a busy day and also slightly unhygienic on the inside due to the flies flying around the tables, hopping around from table to table, mesmerized by everyone's food.

We ordered a Cheese "Paper" Masala Dosa. (lol)¬†
The Dosa had Cheese in it but definitely no "Paper" (lol)

But anyway, the dosa was awesome. Period. No complaints whatsoever.
Would recommend this place for its Dosas. Although I felt that the price tag for the Cheese Dosas were a tad too expensive.

Soon after, we ordered a couple of Rose Lassis and they were pretty good too. Pretty rosy too.¬†
The service was pretty fast and the waiters were very prompt.¬†

Overall, nice food, nice prices, nicely located on a busy street and nice hype too. Perfect for quick eats.

Located in one of the busiest shopping destination of kolkata-"esplanade" nearby the metro station. This place has been there for decades now and is one of the most popular food destination for the shoppers in the area. Spread over a sufficiently vast floor space and can easily accomodate 20-25 people at a time. The decor doesn't have anything special, a complete decent set up. They serve complete vegeterian foods ranging from north indian delicacies like- raj kacohories, chola batura, samosa, chinese samosas, veg chops, mixed chaats, tikiya chaat, papri chats etc. Their south indian offerings include- varieties of dosas, idli, utthapam, vada etc. They also serve desserts like- lassi, juice, kulfi, firni etc. Popular sweets like gulabjamun, soanpapri, petha, halwa, swan halwa, laddoo etc are also among their offerings. This place stays jam-packed almost all the times and getting a table is really not that easy specially during the peak hours. If you are searching for a good quality and healthu veg restaurant in the area in reasonable price range then this is definitely on the top of your list.

I am amazed that I hadn't written a review on this place. ¬†Well, this place reminds me of my cricketing days in maidan. We used to visit in a group of 4 or 6 people, we had many match winning celebrations in this place. My personal favourites were chola bathura, masala dosa, uttapam, kulfi, lassi and gulab jamun. Staffs behaviour was okayish....always in a hurrry. They have large seating capacity.
I haven't visited this place recently but i have plans.

Specialist For Sweets!!!!! Kulfi and Firni are quite good :) :)  Special Gulab Jamun and Malai Kalakand are the best in Indra Mahal. Masala Dosas are purely Bengali Style with sweet sambhar and coconut chutney.  Dahi Vada is good :) and they generally seve hot , which i dont like . Son Papri and Special Pista Barfi are good :) ( not always ). Though in few years the hospitality and behaviour of staffs are not that good.

I would say I've had worse, but it is the attitude of the waiters that make the overall experience obtrusive. Food is quite average. Although the lassi was great, the Special gulab jamuns were not so special and too hard. If you do visit. Surely have their lassi.

This place is always burstling with crowd since its situated in such a busy place and it happens to be my father's favorite but the standard of food has declined big time since then and I guess they are relying a lot on their oldtime popularity.

First the location. It's just two shops down from the northern outlet ( chandni chowk end ) of the Esplanade metro station. The place is actually far easier to reach than to comprehend the directions I just said. 

It's been here for as long as I can remember. And I've gone there umpteen times with family, friends, acquaintances, people I've come to meet for the first time in Esplanade. The reason I prefer it to most other restaurants in the area is that it is arguably the ONLY proper restaurant in the area with a large seating space. You can't always munch on the snacks from the mobile carts.  

Prices are on a continuous upward trajectory the last few months. The service is professional and fast. Ambience is a mix of weary shoppers, family crowds with children and college groups. They menu is an interesting one since there are just two predominant sections and they are devoted to North Indian and South Indian dishes. Steer clear of items like the Phuchka, Chinese Singara, Matar Puff, Veg Patties and Chop; as well as the various Uttapams. The reason being that it's pointless to try these at inflated prices having an average taste. Everything else is more or less game. The sweets however are a different story. They are all superb. Try anything

The last time I was there, we had a Masala Dhosa. The size was large. The covering was crispy with a slight hint of saltiness. The masala inside was very nice with mashed potatoes perfectly sizzled with spices and mixed with finely chopped herbs and onions. The chilled Kulfi and Lassi we had later were perfect.

Chakraborty Tips : Ever notice how there's only a precious few places to sit in the entire Esplanade area ? There are a lot of seats here. You just have to order some food.

Indra Mahal - It means the palace of the king of gods.  I guess, this was used to be a palace of its times but now it's just a chaat and mishti corner. Anyways, I have my share of nostalgia with this place too. Keeping this aside, here goes my view:

Food:
Just okay. No more the best raj kachuri place... neither the chholey bhaturey nor the dosa has the old charm. The lassi and the firni are also now, nothing special. The only thing, to me, about this place is its sweets, few of them. I love the kalakand and the gulab jamun (not comparing other best places though) and the multilayered milkose. 

Ambiance:
Poor, unhygienic are the two words that hit me at first. The tables aren't cleaned, the cutlery set is stained and if you dare try to drink the water, just have a look at the glass and the thick layer of oil floating on the water as if you on for a oil pool party.

Hospitality:
Horror! Ki khaben (what will you eat), jaldi bolun -  time nei (say it quick, don't have time)... hobe na onnyo kichhu bolun taratari (it is not available, say anything else quickly) - these will be the most familiar words from them. People wear old uniform with stains and stenches of food allover and wearing a grim look on the face. Only one thing commendable is their memory ¬†when it comes for the invoice.

No more a heaven... just another busy old food corner. Feel so sorry while saying this, that I don't anymore recommend this place to anyone.

If one needs an example of wastage of precious resources then this joint fits the bill to perfection.Located near the Esplanade metro entrance on J.L.Nehru road and yet this joint cries itself hoarse for attention.Quality,hygiene,staff behaviour all have gone downhill.Thus footfalls have dwindled considerably.It is somehow chugging along only due to its attractive location.

I had sampled the samosa chaat,sweet lassi and the boondiya. Chaat items-once upon a time eons back used to be quite tasty and tangy.But alas not anymore.The samosa chaat(Rs 40/-)was horribly spicy and yet tasteless.The lassi(Rs 20/-) was watery and could have been better.Only saving grace was the boondiya which i had got packed was hot and fresh.At Rs 280/Kg this sweet was pretty good and the only saving grace.The granules were pretty large as compared to the bengali version of bonde and is made of pure ghee.Sinful yet delightful.
Other items which are reasonably edible include the dosas,chola batura and the kulfi. Prices are reasonable .Fill it up and forget about it-that is the mantra for visiting this joint.

Indra Mahal - Not a Mahal at all. :P
---------
Brief:
Located near the Esplanade metro station somewhere near the famous Metro Gali which is photographer's hub. It is more like a eat and go place. As its situated near the new market, it caters to a large number of people who are from the new market at reasonable prices. I was walking by and saw this place so entered to have lassi.
---------
Snack and lassi-

As i was bored from the usual lassi, i had ordered

1) Mango lassi - The lassi had flavour of artificial mango juice added and den mixed with the usual lassi. As i am myself a mona punjabi, i would always want the lassi to be proper in taste. From my side, it was a turn off for me. The lassi with mango syrup was not horrible but was not up to the mark. The lassi costed me 25 bucks.

2) Chinese Samosa - As i don't like the usual samosa. I always go for the chinese samosa as the stuff chowmien mesmerises my palate. However, it was also not up to the mark. The samosa costed me 15 bucks.
---------
Summary:

Quantity 3.5/5
Quality 3/5
Hospitality 2.5/5
Promptness 3.5/5
Value for money 3/5
---------
Conclusion:

I would visit Madras tiffin over this for the purpose that:

1) it is more Hygenic
2) Staffs are more courteous
3) Food quality is better.

On 19.03.2016 i tried their milk cake and Veg patties. The cake was fine and the patties was fine too. It tasted good only with the ketchup.

While doing puja shopping with friends one might by mistake forget to save some greens for food ( plz dont counter with an ATM argument ) at that moment 
This place then comes into your feasible set 
About the pros and cons
Pros
1) the food is good i agree not great but a good
Havnt tried the chaats i dont like chaats
2) the dosa is crispy potato filling is like maa k haath ka tasty...uttapam idli are all good their price is pretty low compared to the other restaurants nearby 
Now scoop has a right to charge higher but the other street stalls dont
The chutneys are quite tasty
3) the sweets are fine .... the kulfi 
4) fast service
Cons 
1) hate the waiter ....been there so many times hate the look on that guys face as if he is doing me a  favor
2) always crowded the wash basin is in a very poor condition
3) no  it doesn't have an ac (but that's nt that big a deal )

Overall i visit this place every year during the pujas and not out of compulsion i like the dosa and its light on the pocket but definitely not the best place ever..

Located near Esplanade metro outlet beside the iconic Rallis,this is another old street food joint.The quality of the food here at present is not at all good and it does not do any justice to its wonderful location.
The menu offers mainly street food like chats,samosas,chana baturas and South Indian food.The quality was quite decent few years back.But now it has deteriorated significantly.The last time I had visited this place a few days back we had the chola batura,aloo tikki chat and the raj kachori chat.We did not like any of the three items.The chats were quite tasteless.The amount of chola in the chola batura was pitifully small.
They also have a section for sweets which is the only part I found okay still.The gulab jamun,rasgulla and the shoan papdi are quite nice.
The prices are reasonable.The service is fast but the staff are not well mannered.The interior is spacious and the seating arrangement is quite decent.There is no air conditioning.The place is quite crowded at most times which is more due to the location and the reasonable prices than the quality of the food.
Overall if you are looking for a pocket friendly quick bite around Esplanade,this is one of the options you will have.But I for one would not be recommending this simply because the quality is not good enough and more so because there are many other options nearby.But in case you drop by,do try the sweets.

The owner of this place should thank his ancestors for gifting him one such location, cause the way it exponentially deteriorated, it should've and would've been history by now!

It's a pretty old shop by the way.. You'll find it (if you really, really want to) on the footpath of Metro Cinema.. It has quite a large seating capacity, mostly filled up by budget shoppers or travelers.. The food here is tasteless, particularly the Chaats.. Me n my partner wanted to have some nice authentic Papri Chaats one fine evening and God knows what went into us, we decided to give Anand a break and try out Indra Mahal! It was by some distance the worst Papri Chaat n Raj Kachor we ever tasted.. Weirdly tangy and rubbery to chew, this place has even lost it's once fine homemade Dahi.. The Dahi given was not cold, n tasted a bit sour.. Total put off! Even their sweets they sell in a separate section don't taste so good anymore!  

My granddad still likes their Masala Dosa n Kulfi, but I've lost patience! 

I agree that even with such poor quality, they wouldn't have to wrap things up anytime soon, but seriously, they need improvement! It's not far away when they'd hear an word  from someone for serving stale, rubbery Papris n sour-tasted Lassis n Dahis!

Went there few times for fast food. It is just in entrance of the Esplanade Metro. Have the variety of foods. You can parcel the food items and can used as a gift. Parcel packaging is better. Cost is moderate, neat n clean, have sitting facility, interior is spacious...
Access to the shop is best, place is prominent. Certified by my Mrs. also.

I found this place pretty okay for a quick bite if one is really hungry. I've tried out the masala dosa, dahi vada, lassi and some sweets. The dosa was very good with respect to the price charged. I liked the masala filling more. Lassi was full of unmelted sugar and that created an unpleasant sensation inside my mouth. The sweets are good though. Do try out the son papdi made of pure ghee. I would surely go back to this place for the dosa after my shopping spree in new market! (P.S : The staff and the crowd is not extremely good)

the place used to be at least both affordable and a bit classy once upon a time. but that now is a long gone history. the only reason this place stays crowded is because it is situated in esplaned. otherwise no one will want to eat there. the food quality is not very good and the food may also upset your stomach. taste wise not very poor, but quality wise not good at all and neither suggested. the stuffs are also untrained. and their behavior is also poor. not a good destination for any fellow foodie.
