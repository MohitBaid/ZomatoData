Located between Helabattala and Colony More this momo-shop is an exact replica of wow momo! tried their chicken pan fried momo, and the quality was good. the price shown in the menu here is without GST (5% as applicable here). They have chairs in front the shop and an area to sit inside as well. A nice option for momolovers in Barasat:)

A stripped down version of wow momo! The menu is absolutely same with some change in names. The prices are somewhat less, like chicken cheese steamed momo costs ₹130 in wow momo, whereas in momozing it's ₹110. Taste is very similar to wow momo, as a matter of fact you won't be able to differentiate the taste if blindfolded. The barasat outlet has sitting area too.

If you like momo and not been here, then it's a shame. This place you will like to again and again and again once you been here. They make damn good momo. My favourite is the cheese corn, cheese steam and tandoori momo from here.

Someone bought a veg momo from their outlet and we got to try their food. Packaging was great, the packet had 5 big sized veg momos in an aluminum foil container, a green chutney and a ketchup, tissues and plastic forks.

Tastewise, the momos were good. Had adequate veggies and one plate is enough for one person. The momo wrappers were thin, soft and well steamed. The veggies were fresh and properly minced. The chutneys were quite spicy, or maybe it's because we don't like too spicy preparations.

Nevertheless, wouldn't mind having their food again, would update the review after trying their thukpa and burger, if possible.

Pocket pinch- 75 + 5= INR 79

Note: The attached photo doesn't include all the pieces because the photo was taken after plating, for our Instagram profile.
