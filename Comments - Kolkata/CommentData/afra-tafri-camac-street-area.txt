This place is awesome. An amazing place to visit in the evening with friends. Now coming to food, for starters I tried ‚Äútangra mein bhangra‚Äù which is basically chicken chilli. Harrissa chicken was good, butter chicken was really tasty. I also love their ‚ÄúParadise Island‚Äù mocktail. For desserts i had chocolate and cream.Overall a nice experience.

This place was in my bucket list for a very long time.So finally visited it on 25th December.They have this whole retro set up with beautifully strung lights decorating the bar counter.The seating arrangement is spacious and very comfortable.The whole place is so charming that it just woos you away.We went for their Tangre pe bhangra and big chicken crunch cubes from their starter options along with a mocktail.For main course we opted for their tandoori chicken fettucini pasta.The food is really delicious and the prices are moderate enough for the quantity of food is quite ample.A definite thumbs up!

The aesthetic and food of this place are equally appealing. A bunch of my friends and I raced through our dishes that were all very satisfying (special mention: the Ammi Jaan's dish). The desserts are interesting, although a bit much in amount after a proper main course (not a complaint!). The prices were pretty justifiable to me. Would recommend Afra Tafri if you want to try out a new place!

Cons: The menu is quite confusing because their way of cataloguing the dishes isn't very organized. It was a bit of a hassle trying to figure out our preferred choices. Also, one of my friends was quite sad about the absence of beer inspite of the massive brewery equipments at the entrance.

This spacious restaurant in Camac Street should be a must visit one for all the foodies.
Perfect ambience,with lots of space,nice decor with cordial service.
Food tastes good with a unique style.
Hookah facility is also available,in case you want to try out there's a separate well decorated space for this so as not to Interfere with non-hookah customers.
For starters: grilled chicken cube
Main course: Kung pad noodle bowl (seafood)
Dessert: chocolate fondue

P.S. Mineral water supply is a must here!

Extremely beautiful decor. A very spacious restaurant. The food is good. The signature blueberry shake is just awesome. The staff is cordial but mediocre service. The music played got me a little bored. But what makes this place special are their noodles. The Kung Pao Noodle Bowl made my day. One lovely restaurant for Asian¬†drama lovers.

Afraa Tafri is located in Camac Street in the Haldiram's building. We went there on Christmas Eve and surprisingly the place wasn't super crowded. We got a table easily. The ambience of the place is perfect for a night out. We ordered Crispy Chili babycorn, The farmhouse pizza, mixed sauce penne pasta and a sizzler. The food was great and we had no complaints. We also really liked the lemon cola drink. The service was quick and efficient and even the music was great. All in all this is a good place to chill with your friends.

After my fourth visit to this place I am reviewing it and I honestly don‚Äôt have any complaints.
There service has been the same since the first day.
All the staff members are courteous and have knowledge about the items in the menu, which is appreciated.
I love the Caesar Salad here, as they make it very close to the classic dish. Every time I go I make sure I order the Big Crunch Chicken Cubes which is marinated with beer and juicy inside. 
Pulled tandoori chicken Bao is also one of my favourite. I personally love the Kung Pao Noodle Bowl as it is presented nicely with a lot of condiments.
Shisha is absolutely pocket friendly and good quality available in double flavours @199 ++

And the most amazing fact about this place is that they provide Bottled Water @‚Çπ2 only

Isn‚Äôt that amazing!
Go ahead and savour their delicacies.

Happy Eating !!

Location: Opposite to British Council, Camac Street
How to reach : Doing Afra Tafri üòú
Ambience : Cool place to hang out which will fill you with energetic waves to go to dance floor as they play great music
Service : Very courteous, friendly but there is a room for improvement in respect to management of the crowd which is understandable 
Food: @ my fav was just awesomely delicious as I tried Tangra ka bhangra which is a dry chilly chicken and the savour will make you do bhangra, galouti kebab in its utmost tenderness, chicken quesadillas just mouth watering juicy, harissa chicken pizza, butter chicken platter which was just amazing and best part that it has dal makhani the best in AT, So good garlic fries, desi mac n cheese was the only let down as the one I have had in United States is a top notch so although a desi version but should have been better but other delicacies have made it up
To sum up it is mood setting place üòòüòòüòò

Hey guys, So I had been to Afra Tafri with my friends a couple of weeks back. The place is totally happening and doesn‚Äôt really burn a hole in our pockets. We had tried the thin crust pizza, pan fried chicken and prawn starters which were so so so delish.
Coming to the drinks, I had a Long Island Lemon Ice Tea (LIT) and it is definitely worth it. Service was smooth and the staffs were quite friendly and great at their work. The hookah was the best one I‚Äôd had in the recent times. It didn‚Äôt chock even once and was quite reasonable overall. I would certainly recommend this place for all the party lovers out there. üíñ

Had gone to Afra Tafri to try their Kebab sizzler special menu. Afra Tafri ticks out all the right checklists - good ambiance, car parking, delicious food, good music and professional staff. The only place it falls short is on the portion size. The quantity they serve is not a value for money given the prices they charge. Also they had charged us for mineral water despite us not having used it at all. That aside, it was a good experience. A definite one time visit. Although, if you do not mind spending  1000/head, then you will want to be a regular here.

Been there for the first time ,my friends and I ordered No Nonsense Pizza and to our surprise it was completely contradictory to its name and it was a complete Nonsense pizza ,totally bad. There was too much salt ,no taste ,crust was like papad .even papad tastes better but this pizza was total horror. We simply walked out without ordering anything else. Complete Disappointment. Will not visit this place again. My 400 Rs got wasted :( . The pizza was not even worth eating for free.

This is in the Fort Knox building.
Quite spacious. Sectional, which makes the use of space even more impressive, and there's an entire smoking room with service. I loved the decor. The bar, in particular, looks beautiful.

We ordered the Mangalorean Chilli Chicken and Chilli Fish Goujons. Delicious, both of them, especially the fish. These guys know their sauces.
Didn't try any more food.

So here's the catch. They don't officially serve alcohol yet. And this is supposed to be a microbrewery. You'll get drinks, but they won't be invoiced.
Example - an LIIT costs Rs.500.
It's a shame they haven't got the license yet; probably has something to do with all the microbrewery equipment on the first floor.

Recommended, for the food. I'll revisit when they start serving their own beer.

P.S  There's live music, and the speakers look like a retro cassette player. So cool üòç

Team Calcutta Instagrammers was delighted to be at the Kebab Festival hosted by Afra Tafri last evening!
This is a part of the month long of sizzling hot Kebabs and to spice it up, you get the Kebab served with a sizzler!
The restaurant has a huge variety of kebabs on offer both for the vegetarians and non-vegetarians, for the hardcore meat lovers, I‚Äôll suggest you to go for the Galawati Kebab which served with flavoured rice and if you‚Äôre a fan of fish too, then you‚Äôll love to have the Masahari Kebab Guldasta which has an assortment of Kebabs served on a tandoori roti! Don‚Äôt worry my vegetarian friends, Afra Tafri has got you covered too, but if you go by my suggestion, then do try the Saag Galawati Kebab!
The festival will be on till the 23 December.

This review is based on a lunch experience , thankfully they a have section for those who prefer smoke/sisha while dining. Saying that , liquor isn't served before 6 pm , so enquire about it over phone before planning for afra tafri. We were so dissapointed to hear this on arrival , thus settling for PAN SALSA hookah , SAFE (Lol!) SEX ON THE BEACH , STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE SHAKE and CARIBBEAN SALSA for drinks .

Lunch comprised of
~KOREAN CHICKEN GOCHUJANG ( small cubes of sizzling chicken put on skewers) ,
~TANGRA MEIN BHANGRA ( classic chilli chicken) ,
~PANKO CHEESE BALLS ( cheese poppers served with mayo dip) ,
~RED INDIAN CHICKEN PIZZA ( thin crust and cheese loaded :D ) ,
~KUNG PAO NOODLE BOWL ( hot kung pao chicken topped over a bowl of  steaming noodles , equally disliked by all of us ) ,
~CHOCOLATE AND CREAM CHESSE BROWNIE ( hands down!! the best dessert )

Except the kung pao noodle bowl , all the items were flawlessly made and served , especially the brownie - this cannot be missed.

On a prior visit at late night hours on a weekend , we couldn't stay there for more than few minutes due to the unbearably loud Bollywood music played here literally exploding our eardrums , and had to leave for elsewhere. Please do manage the volume within enjoyable audible range.

I totally loved this pad. It's big, beautifully decorated, they have different sections for sisha non sisha and one can also throw private parties in their place as well. So, I went on a lunch date with a beautiful friend of mine, more like a sister and it was my birthday treat! We had 2 mocktails, 2 starter and 2 main course and the pocket pinch was soooo minimal! We had big crunch chicken which was juicy and perfectly cooked with a mayo based sauce to die for! üòç Next was Ammi Jaan ka something, sorry I don't remember the full name, it was yummy. It had one paratha with a chicken Keema type prep. Then we ordered Kung Pao Noodle Bowl and Classic Mac n cheese pasta. üòçüòç It was soooo yummy. The pasta was the best pasta I had in my life so far! ‚ù§  the only suggestion I have is to have more friendly staffs. With a bright smile and ready to listen and also who can suggest some good or signature dishes of that place.

'Afra Tafri', the name itself is appealing. Located centrally on Camac Street, above Haldiram's, this place is easily accessible. We were there for lunch, so cannot comment much on the pub culture. Huge space with vintage interiors done with precision. Separate closed space for Hookah lovers so that it doesn't disturbs the non-smokers. Spacious place with good staff and great food. We had ordered for 'Big Crunch Chicken Cubes' and 'Chilli Garlic Vegetable Quesedillas' for food and 'Blue breeze' and 'Safe sex on the beach' for drinks. Food tasted really good and was well decorated. Alcohol wasn't served as they said the bar was closed. Menu has a good variety and this place would not burn a hole in your pocket!

We ordered:
1.  Buffalo chicken stripe tease-
 Spice rubbed crispy chicken strips with fresh crisps. Iceberg lettuce & spiced tomato cheese spread in a multi grain bread.

2.Makhan Singh Da Tiffin-
Chicken Makhani with kalonji naan.

3. Chocolate & cheese cream brownie-
 With Vanilla Ice cream  (highly recommended!)

I personally loved the decor/ambience..Great food quality ..the quantity was a bit less compared to the price. 

Overall a good place. Worth revisiting. üíó

The place is quite lavishly decorated, with a great ambience. 
Tomato and hot soup was pretty basic for which I felt it was overcharged. 
Baby corn was crispy, blended with the flavours of sauces. 
Blueberry lemonade was not sweet, nor sour
whereas Strawberry Dawn was overly sweet. 
Kulfi was a treat to the taste buds, but it looked a bit messed up. Overall, I would rate it a 4/5.

This is a place one must visit if you are in a mood to get fleeced. There is no rate chart for alcohol and they shall give you a tally on plain sheet of paper, as per their whim and fancy. They are not sure how much alcohol is put in cocktail.
The person who got the check said we put 60 ml. Bar tender said we put 45..:-)
we hosted a party with a clear understanding to get 20%discount on food and 15%on alcohol. On bill they gave only 10. Upon asking, they said not possible. It was an error. When I told that you have also charged more for certain cocktail, he argued they have not. When he was caught on the wrong foot, he flared up, saying he will not give 10%discount also.
He also commented that why have we come here.... Totally unprofessional and it seemed he cared two hoots for his customers.
Caveat emptor!

Ordered the ‚ÄòCaesar Salad‚Äô and a rum based Mojito. First, there was a no drink menu provided, tough for a cocktail drinker like my. Settle for the mojito, which came in a tall slim glass with all them works but hardly any rum. Not worth the ‚Çπ450 paid for it. 
The Caesar salad ordered with an extra of chicken came with just lettuce and one cherry tomato cut into half and CHUNKS of chicken instead of slices. When asked why the promised French Capers weren‚Äôt included and upon pointing out the one cherry tomato pointed out, the salad comes back with carrots and cucumbers (!!!) 
Overall a tad disappointing. Would not return

The hookah not at all impressive and even everyone sitting near by were complaining about the same thing, the shisha was not having dense smoke nor it had the proper flavour.

I visited this place yesterday to celebrate my friends birthday and we ordered 2 Mojito. They said we would need to pay by cash, but we insisted to pay by card which they agreed to. However they did not give us any bill and charged us Rs.900/- for just two mojito. I feel robbed. I would not recommend anyone this place because there is no clarity on their billing. Probably they are running this liquor business illegally!

We ordered poutine which is really a canadian form of french fries loaded with sauces veggies and chicken .. and between the six of us we coudnt get past two plates to even think of dinner. And they were lip smackingly good!! Great place for music loving finger foodie groups  .. do not rely on the place if you re looking forward to a conversation !!

We ordered a plate of nachos, a pizza and a shake. The delivery was fast enough. The nachos seemed sub-standard. It was a plate of a small pack of Doritos with a topping of paneer which seemed like leftovers from another dish. This was accompanied with less than a tea-spoon of cheese and salsa. The place hasn't started an "official" alcohol business but you can get one if you ask at the bar. However, you won't be given any bill for the same and you have to pay only by cash

The ambiance was really nice good music good vibe.. but the food quality not at all up to the mark I have asked the Manager about their specialized dishes so he suggested me A Kebab Platter.. but honestly I was no all impressed.

Most annoying part was I didn't understand why they have a problem to give a bill for the beers. I was really  pissed off at that time and not only that the Service Guy was asking for Cash separately for the beers. But after a argument they took the card but .. no bill provided. This is creepy.

It truly deserves the rating it gained, and I think this is one of those genuine places having genuine ratings on Zomato. I loved the decor from the entrance till the washroom it has maintained that rustic theme with a very pretty bar, a microbrewery on your right when you enter but they are yet to open. 
We were four and went for lunch just after our convocation, we had ordered for Caesar salad, fetuchini in pesto sauce, pulled tandoori chicken bao and beer batter fried chicken with a dip. Food presentation was deadly appealing and tasted so perfect. To my surprise the orders came out of kitchen super fast with such perfection. 
We also got sheesha and mocktails like paradise island, lime orange iced tea, Mary's and safe sex on the beach which again blew our minds away.
Service was excellent, the bill just gave a bit of heart attack though(just kidding). I deducted .5 from the ratings because of the flies bugging us during our meals and even after mentioning about that they did not do anything about it. Like a place as good as this we weren't expecting  company like this.
Anyhow it's a place me and my friends would love to go back to!!

So, I've been waiting to visit "AFRA TAFRI" since a very very long time. And yaya!üíÉüèª finally went there yesterday and spent an amazing time with my group of friendsüôàüòç.
This place is located above Haldirams just opposite to the British Council in Camac Street. 
Must say, the place is quite huge and is basically divided into three sections. They have seperate areas for hookah & food making it more comfortable for all their guests. 
The decor is quite pleasing along with a soothing ambience‚ù§Ô∏è.
Also, you don't need to worry about the lightning as it has quite good lights around and you can click some amazing pictures as wellüòõ heheüò¨.
Loved the interiors. The service was good and the staffs were really kind & helpful.
Coming on to the food, this place serves you with various kinds of Bengali, Continental, North Indian, Italian, Asian & Chinese cuisines. We tried 3 different items from this place which were equally delicious and lip-smackingüòã. The quantity was appropriate according to the price and the quality was goodüëçüèª.
In Pic- 1.Cucumber and Mint Lemonade listed under Tall and Cool drinks‚úåüèªÔ∏è.
This one has got a sort of tangy flavour along with a hint of cucumber. It was absolutely refreshing and deliciousüòå.
Also, the quantity was good enough as you can already make that out by the size of the glass. Haha!üòõ
2. Harissa Chicken and it contained of jalape√±o, cheese and sundried tomatoes‚úåüèªÔ∏è.
Also, the crust was superrrr thin along with lots of toppingsüòçüòç. What could be more amazing than that?üòÄ
3. The Chocolate & Cream Cheese Brownie. Loved the way they presented it‚ù§Ô∏è.
Overall, it was a great experience at @letsdoafratafri and surely visiting them againüòç.
Do visit this placeüëçüèª. (Recommended‚ù§Ô∏è)

Long due... and well worth it... located conveniently at the heart of the City.... the decor is excellent, in fact one of the most lavish restaurant interiors in the city currently... the minimalist Movie Posters are definitely something which would catch attention.... with an exhaustive menu covering Indian & Oriental choices... for now, we were on a seafood diet....

Recommended for -

Rockstar Shriracha Shrimps - this batter fried crispy shrimps in Shriracha sauce is the perfect starter.... well balanced and tangy in oriental spices

Seafood topped Kung Pao Noodle Bowl - Saut√©ed in brown garlic sauce, this one‚Äôs a bumper hit.... 

Brilliant in taste... great ambience... the trance music by the DJ is a bit too loud for My comfort.... but definitely this place is crying out for the Liquor license.... once that is sorted, this is going to be the talk of the town for sure....

We are coming back as soon as it can get...

In a mood to pub hop ,afra tafri was my destination after 2previous stops..tired from dancing i decided to give my feet some rest and settled one of the inside chambers.From the huge glass windows we could have a view of the entire dance floor. The decor is planned smartly to give you space for chilling with friends as well as have a party on the floor.We ordered for mojitos with the mezze platter.The drinks were not that impressive but the mezze platter was a flavourful little packet of surprise.Great presentation ,good taste and a superb ambience.The party place for the youngsters in town.

Note:-They have a cover charge of 1000 per couple which is redeemable

The review is based on my overall experience after a couple of visits. 

The place is divided in four parts. A private dining area, a long bar section, the main seating area surrounding the dance floor/stage and a separate hookah lounge. The decor is modern with colourful upholstery and plenty of natural light coming in from the huge glass windows. 

They have a microbrewery for which an industrial license is still awaited. They do not have a permanent bar license yet but do serve alcohol on weekends (temporary per day license) which is limited to beer. 

They host stand up comedy, acoustic bands, cooking sessions with renowned chefs, beer yoga sessions and others events at regular intervals. 

We ordered the following food items: 

1. Mushroom Soup - A rich creamy soup sufficient for one person. 

2. Watermelon & Chestnut Salad -  I had ordered a Watermelon & Feta Cheese Salad based on my previous visit. But I was served a different watermelon based salad. On checking the menu, I realised the feta cheese salad was discontinued. And the same wasn‚Äôt brought to our notice when we had placed an order for a Watermelon & Feta Cheese Salad. Nonetheless, this salad was average with watermelon squares topped with apple and chestnut and drizzled dressing. 

3. Mezze Platter - Served with pita pockets, lavash sticks, falafels, baba ganoush, sour cream and hummus. The hummus had mint in it but the the flavour was so strong that it tasted more like an Indian mint chutney than a flavoured hummus. 

4. Veg Farmhouse Pizza - A thin crust pizza with the right amount of base sauce and toppings. 

5. Coffee Caramel - Initially, there was no prominent caramel flavour but the staff made additions upon request. 

6. Blueberry Lemonade - Right amount of berry and citrus flavour. 

7. Veg Thai Green Curry -  The portion is sufficient for two to three people depending on number of other food items ordered. The green curry was really good and the coconut flavour wasn‚Äôt too strong. 

8. North Indian Platter - The Platter consists of a Paneer,dal makhani,salad and 2 breads. One can select the choice of vegetable. Both the dal and Paneer makhanwala had a nice smoky flavour to it. The black dal was quite similar to the one served in Zaranj. 

The only thing to be improved is the attentiveness of the staff. They were  courteous and helpful but less attentive. 

1. Every 2 minutes the Stuart came to our table to confirm the order thrice. They do not have a system of writing the order down on a paper pad or a digital pad. 

2. They‚Äôre always facing the computer systems or talking amongst each other that calling them out was getting difficult each time. 

3. They just put the food on the tables and leave without checking if there is sufficient cutlery to eat as well serve the number of food items on the table.

The decor and the setting is amazing. There is a seperate hookah lounge and dining area and as you enter the place, on either side of the hallway you find the large brewery machines kept. I went there looking forward to try their hard drinks created by their breweries but I came to know they had not yet received their bar license. But that disappointment was very well compensated with their lip smacking dishes. The raspberry cream cheesecake and fudge brownie with ice-cream were a winner.  A place you definitely should visit once. üòÅ

This place was in my wishlist since a long time and visited here with my friends this puja.
The ambience has a rustic vibe and is lively.
Though the music they play here is just too loud.
We ordered two drinks-Safe sex on the beach and Blueberry cheesecake & walnut milkshake
The first one is kind of sweet and sour drink with a peachy orangy flavour and is refreshing.
I loved the milkshake more.Recommended.

We had Herb Chicken for starter.It is basically french fries topped with good amount of cheesy chicken.It tasted nice but you may gradually lose interest on this dish since towards the end its just more of french fries and no chicken.Though it is their recommended dish I did not like it that much.Chicken part was delicious.

We had butter chicken from their hum saath saath hain part of the menu.Its kind of a mini meal with a small portion of rice (or Indian Bread),Dal Makhani,house salad and bowl full of yummy butter chicken.This entire set just won my heart.The butter chicken here is absolutely lipsmacking.Also,the dal makhani is superb.Recommended.

Ambience is nice and prices are more or less reasonable.
Service is prompt.
Will surely love to visit this place again. :)

Had visited this place on Asthami evening with my friend, which is located beside Industry House in Haldiram building at 1st floor. The ambience with dim light, chandelier, movies poster, live music, sports screening, which is pretty cool to chill out with friends. The staff members are so well mannered and courteous enough to suggest the dishes, which I like the most. They serve beer & hookah which is not there in the menu, but you have to ask for it. The food is simply outstanding. We ordered Herb chicken, Bira and a sisha. They should keep different beers too as only Bira was available. The price of the dishes are reasonable, which is good. Surely gonna visit again to this place. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Went for an ashtami lunch buffet here...
First off let me get this straight, they have got some great ambience and d√©cor.. Really, they do... Spread across three sections, one of them being the smoking and hookah area, they have got plenty of seating arrangements..
They also have got you covered with live sports screening... myself being an ardent cricket fan it was a huge plus for me cause it was Ind vs Australia live ODI match going on then.. nd blv me the experience was great...

About the hospitality, they definitely do strike the right chords here too... Staffs are courteous with prompt service...

Now talking about the food!!!
Ok so, even though the number of items were limited with starters and soup having only one non veg option each (amritsari fish fry and chicken munchow soup respectively) the buffet didn't exactly turn out to be as disappointing...

Each and every dish tasted great with luchi and chholar daal deserving special mention (as it is we bengalis have a soft spot for them, so when you do it right you win our hearts instantly)

Being allergic to prawn (yeah, i know i am cursed), i couldn't taste it, but my friends told me it was great..
But it was carribean chicken steak which actually was horrible...

Other than that everything was good about this buffet and at 700 bucks all inclusive they are doing a really great job here...

We had a great time here at afra tafri!!!! keep it up, you guys!!! üôÇ

Visited this place in Aug2017 for a celebration. This place is located just above haldirams camac street. The ambiance is great. They have mentioned FULL BAR AVAILABLE here in zomato but they do not serve. We were told that they just have a temporary license for it so they charged separately for hard drinks at a very high price. üòï Coming to food, we ordered pizza, which was amazing. üòä

Went with frndz on an Saturday evening... As we entered we could feel the energy of the place,the decor is really nyc and comfortable. We ordered hookah with some food and drinks....it was pretty good too. But the best part for me was live DJ who plays good music with good food. Looking forward to be there againüòçü§ó

Afra Tafri will make you happy for sure with it's great ambiance, exceptionally good food and decent service.

We visited for lunch and had ordered -

Baby ko corn pasand hai, Fish goujons and Penne Alfredo. All the dishes were delicious. Portions were decent too. 

Some of you might find the menu options limited. It definitely could be worked on. 

Price is reasonable.

Recommended!

I have been planning to go to this place for quite some time but somehow couldn‚Äôt manage time to go to this place. On a Friday night we wanted to go for a place with good food and great music. Turns out most of the places were either over crowded or they don‚Äôt normally serve good food. We thought of going to Afra Tafri with our expectations low as everyone had a mixed reaction for this place. But what was yet to come was beyond my expectation.

Food is okay at best. The portions are small and the most disappointing thing of all is, their beverage prices are sky high. They will give you half the portions you may get in standard places, and try to call it a standard portion. I don't know why it is rated as a moderately priced place, where we could have managed a much better portion and quality of food, for the same price range, just a little way down the street.

This lounge is located on Camac Street just beside the Industry House in the 1st floor of the building housing Haldirams. The decor and ambiance if the place is wonderful with live DJ's and Live Music being played which really adds to the charm. Food quality is very good and lots of shakes each with its own unique taste is available. Hookah is also available but is not on the menu. Considering the ambiance and location the pricing is extremely reasonable. Overall a place which has left me wanting to come back for more!

this newly opened dining place is situated in the first floor of the building that houses Haldiram's on camac street. it was an impromptu decision by me to visit this place on a sunday evening. the place is fairly big with multiple seating arena and options ( from high chair to sofa to comfort chairs). on a sunday evening, this place was quite full. live band were performing along with couple of Rjs. one could not miss youngsters blowing smoke chains of hookah on virtually every table. as i am not a person who would first waste money on hookah during my youth and on cancer medicines during my 50's, i ordered starters straightaway. ¬†one was veg kofti and other was panner tikka. while the former was quiet tasty, albeit the serving was less, the latter was just an ordinary mortal. in the main course we had pasta which was very tasty and a pizza, which too was crisp and soft and yummy. i find it strange that the menu over here does not mention the price of the dishes. most of the starters are from 175 to 325, main dishes from 200 to 350. drinks are for about 200 each. meal for 2 , without carcinogenic concoction of tobacco and water, would cost around 1500. service charge of 6 percent is added to the bill.

First impression, the entire vibe and setting of the place is really great. We ordered Chocolate Mint cookie shake which tasted delicious and Safe sex on the beach, which was tangy and fresh. The Farmhouse pizza was good and so was the Tandoori Chicken Fettuccini. What I really liked, were the desserts. We got lucky because there was a buy one get one free offer on the desserts. So we ordered the Opera cake and the Crystal Ball, both of which, looked and tasted equally foodgasmic. The oat chunks on the Opera cake were legit mouthgasm inducing and transported me to food haven! 

All in all, a great place to hang with friends and definitely recommended for desserts.

The place was visibly crowded on a Saturday night! The ambience is amazing. The area is divided into two sections -the wider space has the bar and a stage, next to it is an enclosed space for private party. The pub serves hookah and few amazing flavours. We ordered pizza and we found it yummy. The food is highly priced and the cocktails were not so amazing! Overall a 3.5 for the ambience and the courteous staff!

Awesome ambience with the soft golden lights and a fantastic decor. 
We weren't really very hungry when we went there. So we ordered just a plate of pasta and a cheesy poutine. Both tastes nice. 
The DJ deserves a special mention here. Rocked the evening with 'em 2000's pop songs. I couldn't help but sway with the music. 
Wish to visit again when the dance floor is also live.

The place pumps great energy. Went there on a Saturday evening and the vibes were so energetic, all because of the good music they played and the super good food and drinks they serve. Had dumplings, pasta, thai green curry with rice and a range of mocktails, was a great deal. The only problem with these places are that they treat stag men as criminals, and you have to explaina and convince that your friends are inside and have to call for them and and prove the same, is an ordeal.

Located at a very prime location on Camac Street, diagonally opposite to the British Council, this place is at the 1st floor - above Haldirams. I'm saving everyone some embarrassment here, coz it happened with us and can happen with anyone. I think they have a dress code or something, the bouncers were looking at me like I didn't comply to their lofty standards. Once in I took an instant liking to the place, the decor is similar to that of an European tavern and it gave out good vibes. Friends music food drinks are a heady cocktail. I felt the music was a bit louder than it needed to be, however, they were belting out my favourite songs so I had nothing to complain. Coming to the food and drinks, I had a LI Tea and it was the best LI Tea I have ever tasted. Then was had chilli prawns, Bappi Da Prawn, pulled tandoori chicken and some others and each of those dishes were just perfect. 

All in all it was an experience worth revisiting time and again, in and around the party hub of Kolkata this place deserves a mention.

Located in the 1st floor if haldirams camac street,its easily accessible .Spread across 12000sqft it had 3areas- a smoking zone where hookah was there, a private party area and the normal restaurant area. Beautiful music, Big screen and the DJ floor was the biggest plus point .
The waiters were courteous enough to suggest the best dishes.
We had Crumby big chicken, Afra tafri Pub sampler  and the Four cheese Fantasy.
The Crumby big chicken was too good with big Chuck's of chicken fried and spiced up to the exact right amount and was served with a dip.
The afra tafri Pub sampler contained French Fries, Onion rings and cheese sticks with mayo dip,and house dip.
The four cheese pizza was just too good with Mozzarella, Parmesan , Cheddar and cheese on a thin classic margarita base.
The best offer was 1:1  on all desserts.
We had The crystal ball , nutella samba mousse, kulfi tutti tatan and classic brownie with vanilla sauce.

Ps- some of the info's given in the zomato page were misleading as...Full Bar is NOT available.Yes they do serve Budweiser but it's not on the menu, for which they charge extra.One pint of Budweiser costed 300 so definitely not recommended.
And there was no charging points on each table as reviewed by zomato.
Barring these small things Afra Tafri is a grand place to enjoy a good gastronomic experience....

Afra Tafri - A nice place tucked in camac street, great ambience, lifted the mood, the moment, we entered the place. The menu covers almost everything that one may feel like having on a particular day, full marks for taste & more so for the presentation. Lovely to see people all around you enjoying. Portions are best suited for 3 people, if they are light eaters. Amicable, pleasing staff, great music, the only grouse is preference is given to English tunes, Bollywood Music only after 10:00 PM I was told, maybe that's the lounge culture or has a snobbish value! Pocket friendly, worth a visit to chill & let your hair down!

The food was okay-okay. Not as good as expected. Not worth the prices that are charged. We ordered pizza, pasta, babycorn, cheese balls, salad, north indian platter. Pizza was nice, the best among what we ordered. I tried kiwi and green apple smoothie. It was awesome.

Today was the second time I have been to Afra Tafri and it was an amazing experience. When we went we didn't know there is going to be a live band and didn't expect much, but it was fabulous. The band was superb playing all kinds of upbeat and sufi songs. On top of the great ambience the staff attention was commendable. Now coming to the food, we ordered a Classic Margarita Pizza and Paneer Tikka. The pizza was good but the paneer tikka was fabulous. On the whole we found a new favourite.

Had heard so much about Afra Tafri but the first visit was a complete turn-off. Amazingly located on the Camac St, with a huge well decorated surface area, this place has to get its act together very soon post the liquor license goofup. We were told that there werent any nonveg dishes except those of chicken and we had to pay for drinks in cash. Left in 10 mins. Potentially a great place.

A good ambience place to hangout. Its mostly for hookah people. Me being a non hookah person, it was pretty good though. It is quite a big place, with a dance floor and DJ. Great place to chill with friends. 
I ordered a Chocolate Mint Cookie Shake. I expected mint flavour, but they used pudhina for mint. Which was something new and I liked it too. Just that the quantity was a little less compared to the glass in which they served it.
The Baby ko Corn Pasand Hai aka Babycorn was really yummy. It was crispy and spicy. Must order. 
Then we ordered a Paneer Tikka Tikdam Baaz. The paneer seemed fresh and it was very soft from inside and crispy from the outside. Must order. 
Then came the Farmhouse Pizza in whole wheat. Which was pretty good too. 
The dessert platter..Kulfi Tarte Tatin, I only liked the kulfi in it. Rest my friend ate. It wasnt bad, just not my personal choice. üòù
Service was very prompt and humble. 
Overall a good place,worth going on a friday or saturday night once in a while.

I've been to Afra Tafri countless number of times. The ambience is top notch and it sure can set you in your dancing mode. The place is beautifully designed & spacious. I have tried their pastas (white sauce & mix sauce), red indian pizza, saut√© mushrooms, chilli chicken, kung pao combo to name a few. 
The pizza and the combo is definitely to recommend. However their saut√© mushrooms is very dry. In drinks, I personally like their frozen margarita & lichee mocktail. Their brownie with ice cream is the star of the menu. A great place to visit and have a nice time. Cost for two would be around 1300 including taxes.

This is another new restropub-lounge in the heart of the city...situated at camac street...Afra tafri boasts of a large space. The place is delightful in decor with a nice ambience.
The main area is large with a small dance floor and a large screen. However we were seated in the smoking room which was also pretty cool. The music felt a but loud sometimes but that's okay.

The food was good and the drinks even better. Priced aptly, it wont burn a hole in your pocket.

Would like to return soon!!

Delightful food and prompt service! The first two things that come to my mind while writing this review. We went in a sunday evening and enjoyed our time thoroughly. We ordered hookahs, pizza, pasta, indian main course and desserts. The best part was the music and the ambience. Would request he management to look in the portion of the pasta which was quite less. The food was nevertheless tasty and served warm.

Ambience :
This is place another newly opened happening pub in the city. It has three sections to chill and relax which makes it quite a big place. Decor is fun and cute. This place has a soothing ambience and unlike other pubs it isn't very dark inside. Overall I would say the decor and the ambience is impressive. 
Food:
We had big crunch chicken cubes, Rockstar Sriracha shrimp and Fatafati fish. Fatafati fish is a must try and chicken cubes is a very good dish with a lot of quantity. 
Drinks:
Amongst mocktails we had blue breeze, mango coladas, blueberry lemonade and safe sex on the beach. Drinks were all good but I found blueberry lemonade to be the best. 
Dessert :
We had chocolate fondue and chocolate cheesecake. There was one is to one offer in the desserts which was a good deal. Chocolate fondue is an interesting dessert to go for. 
Service:
Service was decently well managed. No complaints regarding  the service as staffs were quite cooperative. 
Budget :
I found this to be budget friendly compared to the other happening pubs in the city. This place is enjoyable and according to me is a must try place.

Location-. Afra Tafri is located in camac street opposite to British council ,it's in the first floor of the building just above I love haldiram
Ambience- This is a big ,spacious restaurant dimly lit with open bar and has a separate room for big groups. The wooden tables and the combination of the lighting makes this place mysterious. Smoking zone is also available.
Things tried- We have tried paach paan hukka. In the cocktails we have ordered cosmopolitan,margarita and a whiskey based cocktail.
Food- Big crunch chicken cubes , Buffalo chicken strip tease.
The good part is that there were sudden offers on all brands of beers.

Quality and quantity was adequate. A value for money restaurant

Service is excellent. I wish to visit this place again soon to try more of their items.

Afra Tafri - Nice concept and a great place to hangout.

Ambiance - I really liked their concept. Beautiful place and amazing interior. Everything about that place is GRAND. Special Mention - Their Bar section and Lighting . - 5/5

Food - Couldn't explore the Menu much.. We ordered their famous AKKAD BAKKAD KUKKAD - It was good and the spices were perfect but it wasn't very juicy. For dessert we ordered FIRANGI FIRNI CAKE -served with coconut ice cream - WE LOVED IT.. a new unique touch.. and a great combination.

Service & Staff - FULL POINTS - super courteous and very friendly.

Overall a good place to visit.

The food here is really good. Had been here both on a week day and a Saturday. It gives the feel of a proper restaurant on weekdays and a pub on weekends. 
The music was really impressive...We almost danced on all the nos. 
The problem that we faced was that the bills were not correctly monitored. There was a difference in the number of drinks that we actually had and billed for. And since we all kept the count, we got the bill corrected and the manager was really helpful in that.

This is a really nice place...I say this because its quite spacious, the ambience is amazing and the interiors are cool
The dance floor is bigger compared to most places so you can let your hair down and have so much fun with your gang.
But the food is not satisfactory. I am a vegetarian and so my options are really limited.But to my surprise there were no sizzlers on the menu. Even the appetisers were really few.The portion sizes really small.I feel the pasta they serve is just enough for 2 ppl.
Go to this place for the ambience guys!

Its a HUGE place.¬†

Thumbs up : The food is simply awesome. If u planning to visit the place then u must order the Chocolate Fondue, its one dish which ull just love it. It serves Marshmallows, Strawberries, Jellies, and other fruits with Chocolate sauce and Milkmaid its simply awesome. Foodgasm for sure.

Thumbs down : Drinks couldve been cheaper and the music was boring. DJ needs to play some peppy tracks .

All in all a real good place with great food and drinks. A must go place with your friends and the stewards are very helpful and friendly. This resto bar has actually managed to tick all the boxes.

Really happy to visit the place. Looking forward for next visit.

Rs. 1200 - 1400 for 2 ( including a drink each )

There are few places which deserves a ranking of 5 on my list . It seems this place is quite lucky to grab all my attention for a decade now . I went there on an occasion which was the friendship day and it did not disappoint me at all . I loved the lively vibes that this bar had imbibed in me . The DJ was good playing all old and new peppy songs however sometimes it just went all gloomy with EDM so just a tip play songs that people can dance to as well as enjoy . Food was good , as did not have so much time to explore the menu due to dancing and posing for pictures so just ordered a Herby chicken with fries and a veg cheesy dip which was also accompanied with fries . In the drinks menu we had a LIT and 3 pints of beer where I just loved the taste of the LIT which is not so common about the bars of Kolkata - a plus point of this place which makes me crave the go again the next month . Another plus point is that they got a nice and big dance floor where you won't feel claustrophobic yet it is cosy for couples as well as for the girl gangs which we were . The crowd is hot and happening, not at all cheap and the management seems to be working fine and we are looking to have a full meal next time as unfortunately we did not get a place to sit and we do understood the reason hence not at all complaining . The place has given me memories to cherish and a hope to go back and enjoy .

I ordered chocolate cookie mint which was so bad that all you taste was only the mint leave taste we had to change it thrice. Paneer tikka and cheeseballs were okayish. I liked no nonsense pizza in which I added mushrooms it was the must try on then. Hookah was good.
Loved the place's vibe.

A new place in Kolkata, very happening and nice ambiance. Interiors are also well built for with separate sections.

We went on a Sunday night and they had a live performance on, they singer was very nice and sang some very good ones. 

Food - Average 

We ordered, quesadillas - Average, Cannelloni - Not well cooked and a bit bland, Brownie - very nice presentation and tasty.

Service - fast and courteous, also valet parking service available.

Cons - Hookah, they charged Rs. 500 for a normal hookah (normal base, gum supari flavor), which is i believe on a higher side, also they do not add it to the invoice, they just charge you separately without accounting for in the bill.

I have only one word pathetic food but awesome ambience.
Except the ambience the food is so bad that we had to leave the table within a hour and went to dine somewhere else.
Herb chicken - I guess you guys should have named it French fries in white sauce. Herb and chicken ??
Classic Ceaser Salad - I did not know what I was eating there was full of lettuce and nothing else.
Thank God I ordered fresh lime soda,it saved me n we left.
Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to hear good music and ambience .

Afra Tafri - located in Camac Street is the newest party spot in town! A place that has Ranveer Brar and Shatbi Basu as their curators, how could anything possibly go wrong!

On Wednesdays, they have acoustic nights. The place is divided into sections. The hookah places are covered, and does not cause any disturbance to non-smokers.¬†
The place was brimming with people on a weekday evening - that speaks volume about the place. 

Their cocktails/mocktails are highly recommended. These guys have the best people in the business. The presentation has been taken care of as well. Each and every drink stood out - and such variety. Gondogol, Afra Tafri Bliss is the from the best of the best lot.¬†

On the food front, we tried their appetizers, and main course, such variety is unparalleled. Their phataphati fish starter, and sriracha prawn is top class! There are much options for the vegetarians too - their mochar chop could give other restaurants a run for their money. Their wings are coated with the best sauce, and good to taste. Their Thai green curry with sticky rice is a perfect main course!

Afra Tafri at the heart of Camac Street has a life of its own when you enter the place. Pretty lights all around, Big giant screen in the middle and upbeat music. The place is quite spacious having a dedicated Bar, Hookah Zone, Restaurant and Brewery.
I was quite impressed by then as far as their ambience is concerned. But the shock came when me and my friends asked for their Bar Menu. So they don't have the license yet and they don't serve alcohol during lunchtime. Okay. First disappointment. Naturally we went for the mocktails, Safe sex on the beach and Carribbean Sea. The former one looked like a blue lagoon and tasted like a lemonade, and the latter had a very okaish taste as per as the flavours concerned. Only the Pina Colada was somewhat decent. Second Disappointment. In the appetizers, their Herb Chicken was nice. Cheesy shredded chicken over french fries with the goodness of herbs. The dish was something new and tasteful though the value for money could be a question given the countable chicken pieces in it. The korean Chicken on the other hand was spicy, but it tasted like a regular tikka chicken kebab with mayonese. Moving on to the main course, we had Kung Pao Noddle Bowl, Desi Mac & Cheese and House special Tandoori chicken Fettucini. Out of the three they did good with the Kung Pao chicken bowl, the noodles was loaded with corn, veggies and the chicken was properly cooked in the sauce. I liked their flat pasta cooked with oregano and small chicken chunks Tandoori Chicken Fettucini, it's on the drier side while the Mac & Cheese was cooked in the cheesy sauce like usual. The staff here offer efficient service, courteous enough. It says 18+ and full bar available in their zomato description but please do call them up and clarify I would suggest from the experience we had on a Saturday afternoon. No Alcohol, Kids roaming all over the place, kitty party happening and more. Personally none of the dishes was too good to linger on or to convince the foodie in me to come back and taste the other ones. Afra Tafri was a very okay experience.

I had a very bad experience here. They have some issue with the bar license. I was told that they will serve alcohol but would not be able to give a proper bill. I agreed. The beer they served was not cold at all nor was the white wine that we ordered. This is no way to serve alcohol. More so when you are charging me a bomb. A pint of beer was 300 while the domestic wine was 500. If you charge five star prices then have the decency to serve it appropriately. 
Beer was served in bronze mugs. I am not sure if beer has a chemical reaction with bronze. Glass is inert and that's why used for serving drinks. 
We ordered a paneer tikka which was not good. The green chutney was stale. We also ordered a box of papads. The papads were not crisp. Seems they were stale too before roasting. They serve it with three dips one of which was the green chutney. They also give three toppings one of which was crushed peanuts masala. The peanuts were also stale. It seems that they will use what is in the stores irrespective of the freshness of the product. If you want to be a high end place at least behave like one. 
We immediately left after paying the fare. I don't mind paying high prices of i get the value for my money. So high prices, stale food and bad servings. Avoid

Visited this place twice and had a number of dishes over there .The vegetarian dishes were great but had little issues with the non vegetarian dishes. Had the veg pasta, baby corn and paneer from the veg menu. The non vegetarian spaghetti was very upsetting, the chicken tasted stale so we couldn't even finish the dish. The chocolate kit kat shake was nice and the fondue was expensive in terms of the quantity.

Afra tafri was on my list since a long time. And I finally visited this amazing place a few days back. 
From service to decor, it was all great!
They have a dance floor, a separate area for hookah and a bar. The decor is simple yet beautiful. 
The service was very good. 10/10 for that. The staff were very courteous. 
We had herb chicken, akkad bakkad kukkad, iced hazelnut coffee, safe sex on the beach, dark chocolate and butterscotch shake and paan orange rasna hookah. 
I had joined their card on the ewards app, thus the complimentary mocktail. 
Herb chicken was on their must try dishes. The taste was good, but there was a bit too much of French fries and chicken almost negligible. 
Akkad bakkad kukkad was nothing but chicken tandoori. The pieces were soft and would just melt in the mouth. 
The drinks were good, too, especially the iced hazelnut coffee. 
Highly recommended, will definitely visit again.

Went there on a fine evening to check out the ambience my friend was so excitedly talking about. It's a beautiful contemporary restaurant, sticking strictly to their theme of "chaos". The cuisine is chaotic as well as the decoration and ambience, but in a good way. Great way actually. Staff was courteous enough to guide us to a table, which was outside the hookah realm (they have the two zones separated by a glass wall). Though there was no alcohol menu, they still offered us with their open bar, but the options were quite minimal. Due to the fact that they had all the cuisines mixed up in their menu, we decided to try one from each, and thus chose the Kung Pao Chicken Noodles, Non Veg Main Course with Chicken Butter Masala and Thin-crust pizza topped with mushrooms and chicken. 

The food was great. Tender and juicy chicken pieces in all the three courses, and the kung pao was spicy enough to add that extra Chinese touch. The pizza was tasty enough, would have liked a little more cheese. The food was a 4.5/5, but what lacked is the coordination between the staff. It became confusing at some point, as to who would attend which table and it became confusing for us to, as to whom to call, as everyone was busy here and there. 

From the money point of view, though some may say that it is a bit over pricey, but it is value for money. Good food, with good people, in a celebratory mode, Afra Tafri provides a pleasant experience overall.

Afra Tafri is the largest transitional gastro brewery pub in Kolkata and has some very heavyweight names of the culinary world at the helm of things,  curating their menu.  On a weekday evening  in this beautifully done up place in Camac Street;  I found it pretty well populated and warming up to the fantastic singer called Avishek. 
From their maddening cocktails we were served the signature Gondogol, stairway to heaven,  mango Colada and couple of more. The mocktails which I drank was Paradise Island was to die for. 
Amongst the starters the one I loved was the Sriracha Shrimps,  the Korean chicken Gochujang with wassabi sauce and the mocha e ulfat.  Though I must say the tandoori chicken Bao was also very well done. But you must try the raw mango  chicken tika with mango salsa. Delicious and succulent. 
Have the sticky rice with Thai chicken curry.  One of the best I have had and also give a shot to the calzones. 
To end it I would suggest the mango coolfie and the mango cheesecake. 
Happy Eating! 
PS it was an invite.

Afra Tafri - the newest party spot in town! A place that has Ranveer Brar and Shatbi Basu as their curators, how could anything possibly go wrong!
The place was brimming with people on a weekday evening - that speaks volume about the place. 
We started with their awe-freaking-some cocktails. Each and every drink stood out - and such variety. Gondogol, Afra Tafri Bliss is the from the best of the best lot. Also, make the most of their Ongoing Mango Festival.
Try their mango hummus, mango salad and dessert platter. The platter has a mix of mango pudding, mango cheesecake, mango montecarlo, and mango kulfi. 
Their phataphati fish starter, and sriracha prawn is top class! Their Thai green curry with sticky rice is a perfect main course!

Nice place...nicely done decor...!!! I walked in and had herb chicken and roasted chicken calzone...!!! Both of which were okayish. Ordered sheesha and since they had a mango festival going on i also ordered two refreshing mango mocktails which were pretty much up to the mark...!!!
The place offers live music and this can be their USP...
Walk in if u want to relax and chill with some live music to groove into...!!! 
But yeah the pocket pinch was a lil too much as per the quality and quantity of food they offer...!!!

This place is one of the new entrants to the food scene in Kolkata. It is yet to get its bar license and also the microbrewery license. Its sprawlin and has multiple seating options.
The menu is vast and you can opt from the various cuisines. Basically there is something for every mood.

What we ordered:

-Chocolate Mint Shake : not that great. Would have loved if it was nore minty than chocolate

-Mango Colada : decent

-Bunny Chow : I expected more out of the dish but it wasn't bad. The curry was flavorful. But I expected it to be more spicy and the bread to be better. 

-Dilli Cholla Kulcha : decent but a dish you can do without ordering. Its better in your regular Haldiram type of restaurants

-Murshidabadi Rolls : very well done. The stuffing was good and thoroughly enjoyed this.

-Veg Biryani : I am not one to usually order this but had to. And to my expectation was disappointed.

-Panko Cheese Balls : its regular cheese balls.

-Abba Dabba Papads : fancy papad basket.

The service was sometimes good sometimes the dishes took too long. I was a little unhappy with the portions with regard to the prices. As surely a bar like this in Delhi would give much bigger portion sizes.

The latest addition in the food circuit of the city is quite exciting and worth the hype. Everything from the ambiance to the decor to the food is pretty perfect. The decor, especially, is very unique and unlike we have seen in the city. The food tastes exceptionally good and the names of the dishes are quite intriguing. Their Daal makhni is a must-try.

I have been going to Afra tafri since its inception three months ago, and it is my personal favorite in Kolkata. It is located at the most popular hub of the city which is 9, Camac Street and I must say it is a Foodie's Mecca!
There are three things to love about Afra Tafri ( What a Cool name! Isnt it!) ¬†:
Firstly the Food and the Mocktails which is reasonably priced , secondly the mind blowing ambience and thirdly the hospitable ¬†and friendly staff!!¬†
I just cant wait for the brewery to open and the place to get its liquor license! For those who have not tried this joint yet, you must surely put this in your bucket list!
TIA! :)

Afra Tafri is located at 9,Camac Street Area  opposite to British Council building . The entrance wall was decorated with loads of pictures and so is the roof. The place was dimly lit. Perfect for an evening dine-out. But the music was a bit loud for the ambience. The Bar is available but as they haven't got the license they won't be giving any receipt of it .Coming to the food we took an Indian Platter ,Thai bowl and a Red Indian Pizza.
The Indian Platter- consisted of rice a bowl of dal makhani, butter chicken and salad. The rice was really long grained , dal makhni was good but I personally felt that the salt containt was a little less. But the butter chicken and it's gravy was full of bursting flavors. Very rich in taste and the chicken(boneless) was like butter.It wasn't that spicy Definitely worth ordering.
Red Indian Pizza - topped with caramalised onions and chunks of chicken and jalepinos. Thin crust, crunchy , a balance of sweet and sour.
Thai bowl - it consisted of noodles, chicken and vegetables. The chicken was a bit spicy but if you have medium chilli tolerance give it a shot.
Service- the waiters were really polite ,helpful and they were constantly running from table to table attending the guests. One of the waiter was kind enough to search for us outside the restraunt as he thought we left the phone at the restraunt.The food arrived within 10 minutes after ordering.
Overall a good experience

Lovely interiors..ambience...music...food & service. Would have rated 4.5 but Their major drawback was that there were more flies than people, which is very unsafe and unhygienic. I think Afra Tafri team should look into the matter at their earliest.

This place, located bang opposite the British Council, was the place chosen for our team dinner on Friday night.
The ambiance makes you fall in love with this place instantly, It is spread across a really big area with separate zones for hookah, private dinners, dance floor, etc.
We ordered an array of veg & non veg edibles, I can't recall all the names.
Specially noteworthy was the pizza. I am not much of a pizza person but here, the pizza was thin crusted & totally yum.
Also, the desert.. Chocolate & cream cheese brownie which was heavenly.
Actually every single item we ordered was good. Staff was well mannered.
To sum up, it was a wonderful experience; the weekend vibes being the cherry on the cake :)
I will surely be visiting Afra Tafri again!!
P.S- I hope they start serving alcohol soon enough & this place will be a perfect 5 on 5 for me.

It's not bad at all. Great ambience. The food was also pretty good in fact! Awesome starters. However I had a major problem with the service. They were beyond horrible. Rude, pretentious and extremely inefficient to say the least. First nobody even came near our table with a menu for 10 minutes, and then again Noone was around to take our order. And if u point it out u get a rude response. It wasn't a great experience only because of the service

Kolkata has pumped up with a chain of new places out of which Afra Tafri is a highly recommended one. This place not only has that vintage essence but also is very classy with the wooden interiors. They have not received their liquor license yet but the bar is magnificent, yes they do serve alcohol now but for that you need to talk through with the waiters. They'll be getting their license by July.

Coming to the food we just loved it, we had no intentions of eating lot but ended up doing so. 

Big Crunch Chicken Cubes

This was a gift to our taste buds! The batter of these chicken cubes have beer in it which livens up the flavour of this dish. 
Tandoori Chicken Fettuccini

Hands up if you love flat noodles ... and specially the taste of tandoori chicken with lemon zest with thyme in it. Just perfect.

We did not opt for alcoholic beverages since they were putting on a lot of taxes on them- as simple as a 100 rs beer you would have to pay 210 for that. Just not worth it. Isnt it?

So we tried out two mocktails instead and we loved it.

Safe Sex on the beach & Strawberry Dawn 

All stars to this place and I would totally recommend you. 

Well it is very hard to say how much it is going to damage your pocket because it all depends on what you want to eat. Some might require less or some might require more. 

For us it was approximately 1500 for two.

I went here to attend a friend party..!! I can swear the ambience and the service were unmatched for..!! I mean gosh they were so spot on to every guest in the party.
Now the food - videsi bhel - yumm ; pizza - okayish paneer tikka - yumm ; a combo of naan dal and paneer - yummiest..!!
This combo guys is a must try - the paneer ka sabji in red gravy and the curry patta flavour was just lip smacking..!
Pocket pinch - average (taking into account the location and the ambience) 
Music played was pathetic - the only reason to deduct 1 point on rating is the music..!!
Rest must try..!! Will be coming soon again..!!

Our disappointment began with witnessing no coordination between the front desk and the waiters. We required a table for 5 and were sent inside. Once in, we were told by the waiters that there was no table available. We had almost left when they called us back and seated us.
The food. Not only were the food choices quite limited but also the portions and taste was outrageous. We ordered a pasta which I don't think would've been enough for even one person. The other item was nachos which seemed like the contents of a packet had been merely emptied. The cheese they'd put on it was pathetic in taste. We couldn't finish it off.
Alcohol. Since they don't have a licence yet, they tell you the liqour options verbally (without the prices). They ended up charging us ‚Çπ750 for one LIIT which is an absolutely outrageous amount.
All in all, it wasn't a very pleasant experience and I doubt another visit to the place.

I was pretty curious for the last couple of months about this new place called ‚ÄòAfra Tafri‚Äô (at Camac Street, Kolkata) and about this whole concept of Transitional Gastro Brew Pub. Kolkata witnessed the launch of this brew pub in the month of March 2017 and this place has been trending ever since then in social media. This is presently the largest Transitional Gastro Brew Pub in Kolkata and has a sprawling 12,000 square feet area. This amazing place promises a fantastic mix of classy vintage interiors, fantastic music from that single array speakers, brewery and global cuisine. This joint venture by Raajiv Nathany, Sachin Saraff and Sandeep Goenka promises to provide the perfect mix of world class ambiance, facilities, warm service, food and fantastic cocktails all under one roof. And recently they decided to launch their ‚ÄòNew Menu‚Äô and I was invited over to this amazing gastro brew pub for tasting of this newly launched menu! So firstly, let‚Äôs start by discussing a bit about the much talked about d√©cor of this place. Afra Tafri is located at 9, Camac Street adjacent to the Industry House, in the Haldiram Building (opposite British Council). The place, as already said, is huge but you will find it is neatly divided into several sections, like the DJ console, bar, brewery unit, the huge dining areas, smoking zone, and stage area for live performances. The splendid old fashioned wooden interiors are sure to give you a warm and classy vibe as soon as you walk in.

One of the new additions to Kolkata's nightlife. This is set up on a very offbeat concept though. The decor of the place is classy and well executed. However, the music is a complete disappointment. 
The alcoholic beverages were good and they have an innovative list of non alcoholic beverages on offer too.
The food is quite good. We orders the farmhouse pizza and the mushroom galouti kebab.
The team is extremely courteous and well trained. A special mention for 'Goutam' for his exceptional hospitality.

They organize private parties too

Great ambience!
Interesting fusion food concepts. But dismal execution and portions. Really small portions for the amount of money they charged. 
Ordered 2 different shakes and both were extremely sweet. My Desi Mac and Cheese's desi-ness was not at all palatable. Just some veggies cooked like sabzi and tossed together with pasta. Meh.
Fortunately the sandwich and burger seemed to have fared better with my friends.
Wouldn't go again.

Been to this place 3 times each time trying to figure out the hype. The food is below average and so is the hookah. The food quantity is really scanty, just about edible and hookah doesn't last for more than 25-30 mins. The ambience is good. Seating arrangements are apt. Mocktails are also yummy. Maybe once the brewery starts it will get better.

Located at Camac Street, Above the new Haldirams, after entering the decor gives a classy feel, the staff's behavior is very nice, the service is really fast, the shisha is probably the best in Kolkata, the food tastes delicious, just the liquor is missing waiting for it to arrive. Prices are easy on the pocket,
Very nice place for Chilling, Meetings, private parties.

Visit to afra tafri was one of the worst experience. 
Hooka was served with the used flavour 
Food was served on the broken jar n more over to make up for all this, a complementary desert was to be served which they have deliberately served us after 40 mins (after too much of shouting n was asked not to provide us the complementary stuff)
The caretaker or the staff members don't even care about the service n the complaint.

Afra Tafri is a casual dining semi-gastro kind of restaurant located on the first floor above haldirams in Camac street. First plus point it has is the valet parking which you miss on most of the restaurants in this area. We went there on a Sunday afternoon and got seated immediately. Ambience is good with a large dance floor and a huge screen at the centre of the dining hall. They have separate area for hookahs and a private area for small parties as well. Nothing extraordinary about the decor. We started with beverages - couple of items on the menu were not available so we settled with frozen margaritas summer holiday and paradise island. Both were really good and refreshing. For food we ordered 4 cheese pizza, Murshidabadi kathi rolls and masala veggie cannelloni. Rolls had good stuffing but was quite bland. A simple ketchup was served with the rolls instead of a chutney which was unusual. Pizza was ok and nothing special. Cannelloni was nicely cooked but again lacked that flavour which you look for in these kind of dishes. Service was quick. Staff wasn't very friendly and helpful

There are a lot of room for improvement in terms of quality and quantity of food. The mocktails are really well prepared. The service is really prompt and the staffs are really well behaved and cooperative. I would certainly like to go again to this place

One special thing to mention here regarding hospitality provided by this joint that amused us ( I went with group of friends) they don't serve anything hot in beverage except green tea. One of my friend was suffering from fever and we wanted something hot for him and to our surprise, they did arrange cappuccino for us. Such things are hardly seen anywhere.

Really looking forward for another visit !!!

Visited this place for lunch on a weekday afternoon and the place had just a few diners. The ambience and Decor was wonderful. The service too was good, a little slowbut tolerable. But it's quite an expensive place and the food is more of presentation and innovation in name than in taste. The taste was ok...Good but nothing extraordinary. But presentation was excellent. Since we went in the afternoon,there was no live music but I got to know that this place transforms to a gastro pub by evening with a DJ and there is even a small dance floor. On entering we could see big steel drums and on enquiry found that it was for their beer brewery... Awesome!

Couldn't understand this place at all. Shisha and food corners are totally different.  You can have shisha, but you can't have food there. And where you can have food you can't bring shisha there. Alcohol are highly charged. The only best thing here is shisha which is quite  cheap in an area like Camac Street, Music is amazing and a catchy name. Otherwise there are much better places than this where this is no such restrictions about shisha and food.

This place offers an amazing selection of food practically according to everyone's taste. Their new lunch menu includes a lot of amazing dishes with the quirkiest of names such as Biryani Bhai's tiffin, Kumbh galauti pehle aap, awesome threesome burger and many more. To add to the amazing food, ambience is perfect for you to go out on a lunch date with your girlfriends or even if you want to go for a nice family dinner . It's absolutely meant for everyone to enjoy ‚ô•Ô∏è
Don't keep it on your bucket list for long, go and try out this place !

It's a well managed place just above the haldiram's in camac street. The place houses a brewery which in non functional for now. The place serves good hookah but it isn't long lasting and we also ordered mac n cheese, it was yummy with loaded mozarella and was lip smacking. The mocktails are good as well.

The place is situated beside joyalukkas jewellers in camac street. The service over there is very unprofessional and horrendous. 
For food we had ordered for chckn reshmi kebab which was really good, the chicken was very tender and tasty. We had also ordered for chckn tandoori pasta. Again this pasta tasted really bad, it was very chewy and oily. 
They offer a half ltr bottle of kinley as complimentary and charge Re1 against them on bill. But they had billed us for 2 bottles. Though amount wise it is only Rs 2, but money is not the concerned point here. It is wrong billing..the data was wrong. This won't affect much on customer being only Re1 but it should bother the management as there's a scope of pilferage thru this. Request you to kindly look into the data of billing even more consciously henceforth.

Afra Tafri was a great experience. 
We ordered the- 
Panko cheese balls, it was deliciously gooey and had a mayo side dip. 
Baby Corn with honey chilli sauce, which was good- but I was too shy to say "baby ko corn pasand hai" isn't it going a little too overboard? üôÉ
And the Penne Pasta with pink sauce with extra spice and veggies. Don't order the veggies with it. Just don't. 
And the masterpiece which sold me to the place was the fruit shake- guava and litchi with the hint of chilli. 
It was probably the best drink I've ever had, and I'm not even exaggerating. Please do try it if you go there. 
Pro tip- Try not playing it safe with your mojito's and iced teas and always ask the restaurant for their special. 
We also ordered the kiwi mint shisha - which was decent. 

The only "bad" experience would be the receptionist in the end. She was very rude and talked to us as if we were a problem to her. We literally asked her to take one picture. So much attitude for a receptionist. 

Anyways you guys should really check this place out. 

Ps, Ambience is #1. 

Cheers ü•Ç

A well decorated restaurant with sufficient space, proper maintenance, brewery but the pinch to pocket is on the higher side. 

Food is good, you will find a whole new menu with lots to try on. Brewery looked good but we were not able to try as its closed for some reason. Nice place to hangout with friends during ipl season and football matches as it involves a large screen but beer could have made it more interesting. Smoking area is there so all amenities made keeping it visitor friendly. 

Visit the place, admire the interiors, relish the music (it is goood). Try something new @food for once. If you know what i mean..!!! üòâ

Afra Tafri is a fairly new place opened in the prime spot of Kolkata. Firstly, the interior is amazing and its extremely spacious. Quite a new fiat when compared to today's restaurant, it's so enormous!
Also, I personally love the fact that they have a separate shisha room so overall the atmosphere doesn't get smoky. Overall ambience is LIT!
Coming to the food, you'll fall in love the presentation. I'm not kidding! We ordered the mushroom soup, pizza, fish, corn and a variety of mocktails. I did not like the taste of the soup and the pizza so much, but I loved the taste of the fish and the corn. The mocktails were amazing! Very refreshing and delicious.
We ended by ordering the Chocolate and Cream Cheese Brownie which was heaven! 
Overall, amazing place to go but keep in mind it's not cheap, which is okay keeping in mind the property. Kudos!

Located just at the start of Camac street, on the 1st floor . Just above the newly opened haldirams branch .
First of all a very very spacious area, loved the feel and interior decoration of it. Two sections of seating, one for sheesha and otherwise.
They also have a beer counter which hasn't been started off yet.
Walls are decorated with trendy frames and yellow lights adorn the inside. I like their armchairs, pretty comfortable.
Live sports screening, good music, and helpful staff.

What we ordered :-
Choco mint cookie shake - thick shake, with a hint of mint. Nice presentation.
Strawberry/green apple lemonade :- refreshing and flavourful. Again loved their presentation.

Mushroom chai :- (I don't have a picture of it) it's a slurpy rather mushroom soup but not the usual thick consistency, served with papad as crackers along with it.

Fatafati fish cakes :- (again no pictures) it is a Bengali style maaccher chop (fritters) with a very rich flavoured filling with spices and all. Served with a ago sauce and lime n onions.

Four cheese pizza :- serves 8 slices. Thin crust and wood fired pizza. I am a fan of thin crust pizzas and I wasn't disappointed though. Cheese loaded. Just wished if the source Cream was a little more than drops.

Chocolate and cream cheese brownie with ice cream and hot fudge sauce :- *heavy breathing* . Loved it totally. We asked for more fudge sauce actually.
The brownie was a huge block, filled with walnuts and almonds and little bits of cream cheese in it which awakened the chocolate flavours all the more. Goes perfect with the ice cream.

Loved the place. Will be back for trying out moreüòÅüòç

My friend wanted to explore a new place in Kolkata so we both went to this new place which has opened up in Camac Street, opposite to BCL. The place is huge, interiors are nicely done. Service is pretty good. Music is wonderful. However, the food and the drinks are not great. Its over priced and does not taste good. You will fall in love with the place at first sight but the food will leave you disappointed. I had ordered a caramel & chocolate yogurt smoothie but it tasted horrible! Hope the Manager/owner looks into the quality & taste of the food. Once this is taken care of this place has the ability to reach the top!

The ambience of the place was amazing. The music was very good too but if you go to a place for dinner the food also comes into account. We ordered 2 starters. The service was quick but the food tasted very bad and was on the spicy side of the palette. We left both the items after tasting. Not budget friendly at all. Ordered 2 cheap starters and a shake and ended up paying 1000rs. Not worth the money at all. Overhyped place.

Located in Camac street, above the new Haldiram's, afra tafri is a microbrewery and pub that recently opened doors. Unfortunately went there when we were not serving alcohol, so tried the mocktails and food.
The ambiance is very good and the place echos pub culture with the brew area, the bar, the use of wood, counters, red chairs in places. 

I met a friend here for my birthday and we ordered the following-
‚Ä¢ Kumbh galouti kebab which was delicious. Loved the soft filling and the crust outside. The sauce too was nice
‚Ä¢ Mezze Platter cane in with falafel, hummus, babaganoush, pita, lebneh and sour dip. Was nice, though the portion seemed a little less.
‚Ä¢ The khurchan Paneer Nachos were nice but the nachos should be homemade because that takes away the experience of eating.
‚Ä¢ Chocolate and cream cheese brownie was nice and it came with an edible cup each of icecream and chocolate sauce
‚Ä¢ Safe sex on the beach and strawberry dawn were nice but could have been made better.

Service was good and the place is definitely promising.
Will return to try the fresh brews!

Had been hearing loads of this place for quite sometime. Finally got a chance to visit it. Located right in the heart of Camac Street, on the first floor of Haldirams. A new baby in the city that deserves much appreciation and love from everyone. As soon as you enter, expect to be enthralled by the amazing decor. The entire place is humongous, with the middle section for non-smokers and the extreme right and left for those who love to have a smoke with their food and/drinks. They also serve hookah. Had ordered a paan flavored hookah which was really well made. For food, opted for a herb chicken poutine, grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies and a Chicken pizza. Due to my problem, the chef himself came up to me and recommended the dishes to me. A huge shoutout to all the Managers who were extremely helpful and courteous.

Would definitely visit again and again and again!!!!

Afra Tafri - A Fabulous Experience.
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located near Monkey Bar in Camac Street Area. A new Haldiram's have also opened just on the ground floor and it is situated on the first floor.¬†

I went to Afra Tafri twice (today once) and my experience have been great both times. The place is HUGE and it has got beer brewery and bar which is not functioning at the moment. However, hope they open it up soon. The ambiance of this place is mesmerizing and is quite a treat to the eyes. I loved it. The interiors are quite beautifully done. I sat in the smoking zone section and ordered for sheesha, food and some drinks.
=====
What i ordered:¬†

‚óã I ordered from their special IPL menu knight riders mojito. It was well presented and tasted great. It was gondhoraj lemon ginger mojito. However, would recommend to add a bit more of ginger into it. ¬†#musttry

‚óã Cola Lime Soda - My brother ordered this and it was just fine. Nothing extraordinary and presentation was just very ordinary for this one.¬†

‚óã Teen Paan Sheesha - I ordered it twice on my visits. It was smooth, smoky and lasted long. However, coal change here is 75 bucks which i think is quite expensive.¬†

‚óã Veg and Non Veg Pizza - We ordered for half veg and half non veg pizza. Both of them tasted excellent. I loved it.¬†

‚óã Korean Chicken Gochujang - The marination was excellent. The chicken was succulent. I loved the presentation on this one as well. The taste was good too.
=====¬†
Meal for two: ¬†600-2000 approximate. Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.¬†
=====¬†
Pros:
‚Ä¢ Excellent ambiance.
‚Ä¢ Decent serving speed.
‚Ä¢ Decent hospitality.¬†
‚Ä¢ Good Sheesha.
‚Ä¢ Excellent food presentation, quality and taste.
‚Ä¢ Hygiene is maintained.¬†
‚Ä¢ Superb lights and seating arrangements.¬†
‚Ä¢ Great for parties and is in prime location.¬†

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Costly place but ambiance and food makes up for it.¬†

Went to this place in a group of 8. The ambience is very nice and Porsche. We ordered Hookahs, pizzas, pastas, fries and sandwiches. The hookah was nicely made and we got 4 coal changes in one of them. The food was also delicious. Highly recommend the pizzas. The staff is very polite. Also the place isn't too expensive.

A pub¬†where the food menu is curated by Ranveer Brar and the drinks menu is curated by Shatbhi Basu is bound to be good right? It is just not good but brilliant! I am talking about¬†Afra Tafri, Kolkata‚Äôs largest Gastro Brew Pub that is slated to open¬†its doors on the 18th of March. Located diagonally opposite British Council Library at Camac Street, Afra Tafri is¬†a grand 12000 sq ft outlet. It is divided into three sections ‚Äî the main seating area that houses the bar, a large room that can transform into a PDR and an open smoking room. True to its name, the decor is quirky, chaotic and a lot of fun.

Ambience is really good and as far as that is concerned would rate the place 5.Food-Food was good but the only downside‚Äã was everything was sweet.We ordered for crispy baby corn,Mushrooms,pav... Everything was sweet.Indian was disappointing for the Main course,However the Global/International cuisines were good but other pubs/Cafe has better food.

This place is only good for its ambience.. nothing more can be expected. 
Firstly entry issues., staff was rude. Secondly., the food we ordered was tasteless especially pasta & even quantity was not good.
Will not suggest this place.

Newly opened..over-hyped pub..situated in Camac Street. The ambience is very nice but staff require some training..not very attentive and poor menu knowledge..the quality of the food surely needs to be improved..ordered for Mezze Platter, Pasta, Pizza..none were upto the mark..definitely not value for money..Brewery may be a game changer for this place..

Please update the information as there is no 'Full Bar Available' in this restaurant. People check zomato to find out new places and I feel there should not be any wrong information update for restaurants.
Keeping aside the above part, its a nice place with a lot of space and beautiful interiors!

Which  place works without  a menu on zomato? They expect us to visit the place just to check  the  menu. That's  impossible. I have no idea about  the food or the ambience but I am surely  not visiting  this place. First  respect  your customers then open up a place and expect people to come  over there. 
Horrible experience with these people over the phone.  
They made me wait for a day as they  were suppose  to mail me the menu but what they send was  an unorganized word file without any price  mentioned. 
Full wastage  of time. 
I asked for a menu  not the names of the dishes  you serve. Pathetic service. Completely disappointed.

Now the most important thing Food ITS NOT GOOD NOT AT ALLGOOD the quantity is so so less as if u will be paying money but u will get very less compared to other cafes even hookah was not so good with this kind of ambiance and staff one should think about the food Quality and its funny to write Quantity also. Food was not at all good  we tried white pasta not satisfied with food

I didn't find anything good here except for the ambience. The food quantity is less. We ordered a mixed sauce penne pasta which was a complete disaster,  it was cold plus it wasn't even mixed sauce, it was plain red sauce, we told the waiters about it, they came back with the same plate saying this is mixed sauce only. The baby corn was okay nothing very good and obviously the quantity very little. Then we ordered their special platter which was another disaster, cold as ice, bad presentation plus it looked as if they had some left overs which they decided to serve as a platter. Very disappointing.

Was here a day back. Will tell all out there to wait before you try out this as they are still in the process of building themselves properly. You expect the service to be quick on the weekdays yet they were slow, liquor section yet to operate, hookah was good, ambience is also good but still i would say people need to wait before they drop in here because they are still not operating at their 100%. The staff generally seemed distracted to me. Will only get back here once i know they are operating in full steam.

Thanx to afra tafri that even my closest vegetarian friends became non vegetarian because of the tasty chicken tikka kabab .... Very beautiful ambience and soothing place .... If you don't drink then the cost will also not be very high .... I loved the decorative bulbs .... And you can understand how tasty the food was by reading the first line itself ... Great baby corn .... The service was also good .... However they insisted us to pay the service charge which we did want to pay as it's not compulsory ( KEEP THIS IN MIND ALWAYS ) .... I guess they also hv a dj but I left early so can't comment on that... However we enjoyed

This is the lowest rating I have ever given to any of my reviews because of the fact I disliked this place a lot. 
The interiors was okay nothing great. The hookah section looked very formal with boring chairs and tables.
Coming to the Shisha, it was 0/5. The flavours didn't seem right to me.On my request they changed and got another one which was terrible than the previous one in terms of flavours and density.It almost seemed like I had eaten Dettol handwash. I know its very funny to read this but seriously it was that horrible.
Had ordered Chocolate Mint shake which was extra chilled,thin consistency,less chocolaty and not minty at all so again I requested them to change it too and asked to cancel the shisha because I was so disappointed.
Had thought of ordering something to munch on but seeing the girls on my opposite table leaving the food on their plates,I decided not to order any further and made a fast move.
I hope they work on their taste factor in terms of everything.

A fun new addition to the microbrewery / hookah joint s in Kolkata. This place is huge so forget feeling cramped up and really well decorated. Love the copper brewery things on display. Kudos for departing the hookah and no hookah side as well. Just makes it more comfortable. The menu is fun and diverse. Found the tandoori chicken with pasta the best dish of the day. The margarita pizza was far too plain to serve the Indian palette. The assorted fries are pretty good and the crispy chilly babycorn and the butterchicken is to die for. Service could be better. Overall a good place for a Friday NJ right with friends.

By the time my review is checked , i am sure there are 1000+ visits already.

Now lets come to the business. As the proverb says when you aim for the moon and you miss then u get a chance to land on the stars. However its expectation meets realty.

Food : 7/10 . the garnishing was good but the taste was average. Bowls for snacks a no no.

Ambiance : 9/10 . One of the places to sit and have the best time with your loved ones.

Music : 5/10 . The in house DJ was playing for money and was not bothered about anyone.common man you are paid to connect to people, music makes or breaks the mood.

Staff : 6/10 . The staff though had a smile on their face but it was like "okay dude just pay and get lost.We got bigger tables to look after". No one came to check on our table as we had to ask for them everytime we needed something . The waitress who served us served us the drinks and then never showed her face. That's unaccepted. 

Menu : 5/10 . First of all there is no menu for Liquor so they ask you for your choice of drink and once you get the bill you get to know the prices.A Corona for approx 900 was overpriced.¬†

Coming to the
point that its a new venture and we all are humans , time and reviews will make future experiences better.

That's all folks .

Just next to Industry House in Camac street, the place is spacious and well designed.

The starters were superb and the buffet North Indian was great! No complaints on the food, drinks and hookah. The only thing that disappointed us was the DJ.¬†

Prices were worth paying for.

The staff's were cooperative and it was a good experience over all. :)

So went with my friends on Sunday. Food was below average, had a mix sauce pasta and paneer tikka, hookah was also kindof average, half of the staff had no idea about whether they can change the coal or not, which is kindof rude when two-three staff come and say no we don't do coal change and after small argument they say we charge 75rs for a coal change.
They only good part was the desert and mocktails we ordered.
Interiors were good, amazing in fact, the name is catchy too

Located next to Industry house in Camac Street, this place is truly an amazing place. Followed by amazing ambience. The food presentation here is excellent. The decor here is very unique. They have a brewery here which is to start soon. The staff communication here is excellent. They have an amazing variety of food and mocktails and cocktails. The must try cocktail here is the blueberry one. The shisha here is amazing and long lasting too. They have an amazing dj followed by a well lit dance floor. The menu here is designed by celebrity chef Ranveer Brar. This place is an absolute must visit, specially for all the party animals. They have a huge amount of parking space followed by chauffeur service. All the best to the owners for their new venture! Cheers!

Located just near the industry house, above haldirams 
This place looks appealing at first glance 
The outside look, the decor, giant area 
But" beauty comes with flaws"
I must say the place is not for your usual hangouts.. 
It's pretty expensive i.e. 1 pint corona costs 900 bucks
Coming to service of the outlet 
Well in simple words it's "pathetic''
The staffs were so rude 
We saw that there is a flaw in their billing system 
We were charged 1 rupee for water which was surprising so we asked the waiter to have a look at it 
He took the bill with him and we moved from the table to take pictures 
Then the waiter came nd we asked"or. Kitna dena h"
He said"ap to uth ke chale gaye apko kya bole, choriye jaiye"
Such a bad mannerd person 
Hospitality was also very poor 
It's like they only have bunch of people who is enjoying themselves being in a such outlet 
They don't bother 
Music was also very dull.. 
If you want to spoil your mood 
This place is for you

Had lot of expectations as celebrity chef had designed the menu.... at first went on a Sunday evening at around 9 pm... had parking issues as the parking was full. Talking about the music and ambience , must say it has all the plus points. The place has energy which keeps u moving but coming on the service , it was on a weaker side may be because it's new. The staffs seems not to be that trained enough as they have little knowledge about the menu. Hopefully it can be improved .
Would surely come back once the things are sorted out.

Went to this place with my wife today, on entering everyone greeted well and all thumbs up to the decor and ambiance. Good team to take care of your need and delivers your expectation. The food was good and sufficient for your appetite. I liked their concept of converting the place into night club post 10pm. Its a combination of Pub, Club and Night club. Since the space is quiet big so they had made different seating arrangements which I found to be interesting. All in all thumbs up to the team and obviously the man taking care of everything- Abhijit. Keep it up.

I was invited for a preview to The City of Joy‚Äôs newest ‚Äútransitional gastro brewpub‚Äù which had Ranveer Brar and Shatbhi Basu on board as the Food and Beverage Consultants so naturally the feeling of anticipation was huge because their reputation precedes them.

Perfect location easy to locate.Would give 5star for the ambience..Huge and lively.Went with my friends and had a pleasant experience.The place was lot empty (lunch weekday).The 1st impression was bad as the menu card handed was like a collection of loose sheets stacked in a folder. The menu darts from Chinese ,Thai Indian, (few) to Conti.The food is but spicy (most of it), so when u order mention the % reqd . Now another strange thing I noticed was they served mineral water w/o asking abt our preference.Usually in a restaurant u are asked if u would want a normal filter water or mineral.They just kept as If we had ordered. Qty was average serving 2-3 .Very few options for mocktails and desserts  ( nothing new the usual ones)  .We ordered something with brownie was highly disappointed as it was a simple brownie wit ice cream plated in a fancy way. Service charge is not to b added as had been declared .But here they charged 8% service charge .We quickly noticed and on enquiring they said if we don't want, it wud b removed. (Funny) .Tip amt is to b decided by us or them??

Hopeless Hopeless and Hopeless. Is this is the way you can describe this place. Extremely costly, hopeless food, very less quantity and last of cheating on total. pl do check the bill calculation.These people should be taken to task.Just visit once if you are dying to see how bad the place is. Food finished on the 2nd day we were there. No menu and we had to rely on waiters for finalising the items. Very small dance floor. Trying best to copy What's in the Name and Grid. But comes no where near. No coordination between the people managing the gate and inside staff.God save them. All the 5 stars must have been put by their friends or relatives.Give one star and as do not have the option of zero.

The staffs are very unfriendly and don't know how to treat customers. I was told that all seats are occupied n we need to wait. My friend asked  them for approx wait time and the reply we get from them is 'we dont know' ..The Staffs are untrained and need to learn about Hospitality.

Does not even deserve 1.0..
The food is good, drinks way too overpriced.
U cannot have hukka nd food together..
And the biggest dissatisfaction was after waiting for an hour for the ordered food, we had to cancel it as it would take another 20 mins and the manager seemed happy with the cancellation.
Already angry at the service nd the manager's behaviour, i paid the bill by seeing the totality of it. Later after we left the place my friend saw the bill and pointed out that they had overcharged Rs. 100 which you can see in the pic.
Since i had left the place i texted their facebook page and was disgusted at their lie and whose screenshot is also being attached..

It's a new place. Went with a friend.. the ambience is great... really different... the food is average though they have garnished it quite well.. I found the quantity to be a bit less..

First of its kind in kolkata . Excelllent and huge place with great ambience. Would be loved by everyone, divided into three sections. Great dance floor in the middle with excellent music, a big hookah section with food and liquor and a private party area. Service is extraordinary and bartender had served me a cocktail which was out of this world. Would heavily recommend to all party goers .
