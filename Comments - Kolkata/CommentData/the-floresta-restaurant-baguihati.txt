Tried their "Chicken Hot-n-Sour Soup", "Mutton Duckbunglow" and "Plain Naan". Although the main course items tasted conventional, the soup was a disaster. The soup was so fiery that it was hard to consume. I finished the soup just because food is precious and I don't want to waste it. The soup should the renamed as 'chicken (infinity) hot-n-hot soup'. Mutton duchbunglow was very tasty, the mutton pieces were soft, tender and juicy. The main course was really enjoyable.

I found their menu card system is kind of weird. Several items were absent in the menu card they have sent me during the order, mutton duckbunglow was not there in the menu card. Again, the menu card displayed here in zomato do not contain the range of their "Roti" items. But "roti" is present in zomato ordering page. This is confusing.

On such a rainy day, when one feels lethargic to cook , then home delivery seems to be the lone saviour. So ordered dinner via Swiggy and received it at scheduled time with good packing. So for dinner, ordered Mixed Fried Rice, butter naan, Mutton Rogan Josh and Chicken Butter Masala. Honestly speaking, didn't expected such sumptuous meals at such reasonable prices. Butter naan and Mutton Rogan Josh is their forte. It's taste will remain for a long long time. Will definitely try more dishes of Floresta next time and will recommend it to my chums. Afterall a pleasant rainy day dinner experience . Kudos Floresta! Keep up the good work...ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

This is a pleasant family restaurant to drop by anytime . We visited this place today afternoon and no doubt it has been a great experience for us. We were a group of 4 and we ordered 'tandoori-chicken' 'katla do-pyaza' , 'steamed rice' , ' chilli-chicken' and 'chicken-noodles' .

 Each and every item deserves a 10 on 10 except for the 'katla do-pyaza' taken by my father . The gravy tasted quite good but the fish needs some improvement as it was undercooked.

The restaurant is quite spacious . Since we dropped by the place at 12:30 p.m., no one except us was there and it was blissful and serene.

The place being located at Baguiati Bazar rests above  'Karmakar jewellers' and is quite easy to locate. 

A place worth a visit !

It's new, it's pretty and it serves amazing food. Floresta is a themed restaurant and is downright gorgeous. The dÃ©cor, the lighting everything is just spot on for the kind of vibe it wants to generate. It has accommodation for 50 diners at once.

Coming to food, it is their biggest strength zone. I've tried their Haryali kebab , reshmi kebab and both were super delicious. Butter naans were also good. But for me the star was "mutton duckbunglow". It was spicy, it was moist and it was so very tasty. I'm yet to try their Chinese menu which I also am looking forward to.
The biggest issue I have with this place is it's service. The food takes ages to arrive at your table. Keeping your customers hungry for long period of time is not the best way to go about your business. In my previous visit I was served only one starter in 40 mins.

Good food. Ambience 4.5/5. Innovatiove idea. Service needs to be improved. Variety should increase. A good location for ppl residing in and around Baguiati area. Restaurant management should think for more options to make the place more effective. My suggestion the place is worth a visit.

I believe in using words, not fists. I believe in my outrage knowing people are living in boxes on the street. I believe in honesty. I believe in a good time. I believe in good food. I believe in sex.
                    And I believed in "THE FLORESTA' restaurant....They kept my heart with good food and a wonderful ambience....It has touched my foodiee heart....And I am in love as they made me feel I AM AT HOME...With their hospitality skills...!!!!!

This is a newly opened restaurant near Baguiati AC Market. The first thing to mention about this is their interior,which is undoubtedly amazing. We tried Indian cuisine and all of the dishes were far better than our expectation. Another plus point is that this is very pocket friendly restaurant. Ambience can be improved by addition of good music. Deserts are not served till now. Staffs are extremely well-behaved. Overall,Floresta is highly recommended.
