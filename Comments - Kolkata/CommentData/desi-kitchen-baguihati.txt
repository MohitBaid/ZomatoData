This hotel was in my wishlist since 4 months.Finally had a plan today and went over there.

Location:-
It resides in a hotel named Geetanjali Regency.Its in Ragunathpur just few steps away from Big Bazzar towards Airport.

Ambience:-
Ambience wise good.Its in the first floor.
Not too much seats.Ambience could be better.

Now lets talk about food.

Menu:-
2 Chicken Sweet Corn Soups
1 Chicken Dry Fry
1 Egg Chicken Fried Rice
1 Egg Chicken Hakka Noodles
1 Chili Chicken Gravy
2 Fresh Lime Soda
2 Scoops Ice cream

Soup was good.
Dry fry was also yummy..
Chicken noodles could be better.
Chicken fried rice was also average
Chili chicken was not like chinese chili chicken.But tastes good.
Fresh lime soda and ice cream is as usual good.
Service was prompt.
Staffs were courteous and calm.
Overall AVERAGE.

P.S:-If Someone wants to go just look at Little Apps for exciting Pocket Friendly deals.
One thing i would like to mention- Seating is available and its not only for Take Away.

Not good experience with food. The place is just on the VIP Road, and it is running as it's close to airport. 
Tried both Chinese and Indian here, and clearly disappointed.

We bought a coupon from LITTLE app but unfortunate after reaching the place,management denied coz they were having some sort of meeting party that day...
So we ordered food from menu ( chicken mushroom soup,mix fried rice & chicken in hot & garlic sauce).
There were no customer inside the restaurant.. Ambiance can be improved and service is also a bit slow..
Food was tasty .. Going again to redeem our LITTLE coupon..

Visited that place all of a sudden. Its resides in a hotel named gitanjali regency. Quite spacious one ambience is not so good need a proper placing of indoor lighting condition. They take a lot of time to prepare dishes. Coming to the food quality it all good taste was awesome. The navaratna korma here is a kind of bliss. Other dishes are as usual. Tried a lots of dishes all was quite ok except the doi mach preparation. The fish seemed to be not fresh. So dont try it rather u can choose other option as well. They provide more than adequate in amount.

The restaurant has a very regular and simple ambience although the hotel has a nice entrance. Service was not at all good. It took almost half an hour to bring the soup and one hour for the main course.
Food - 3/5
Ambience -2.5/5
Service - 1/5
Quantity - 2.5/5
Quality - 3/5

The place was nearly deserted when I visited with my family. The food quality was good specially the Chinese dishes compared to Indian dishes they serve. The restaurant though situated at a good place lacks the vive which a good restaurant have.

Overall am very disappointed. Went there at 10pm for dinner with a little coupon but they told today it is not available as their was a party going on at banquet hall and said to call them before coming. Well then we ordered Hot nd Sour Chicken soup, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Scezuan Fried Rice, Chilli Panner, Sweet nd Sour Chicken. Maximum items are not available from their menu jst bcz of 1 party. As a complimentary they gave us masala papad.
Soup is upto the mark.
Chicken Tikka is normal.. pieces are very small.
Noodle is okayish..
Scezuan rice nd panner these both are pathetic.. üòë
Only the swt nd sour chicken is tasty..
I must say improve the taste of your food. Price is little bit overpriced according to the quality. And quantity is also less.
Service is very good. üëç
Repeat visit will definitely not to be planed in near future.

Well had Chinese lunch @ the Desi kitchen. The d√©cor of the restaurant was good, so was the ambience. The pricing was good enough ordered through nearbuy. Fresh lime soda was served for welcome drink, which was good enough considering the afternoon heat. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was followed thereon which was average. For starters we had Chicken Dry Fry which was the star of the afternoon yummy and really hot must say, no staff is very slow if you are in a hurry not the right place to have a meal. Would visit again if have ample time in hand.

If you go by the name of the restaurant, it looks exciting. And if you go by its quality, it's exciting again. You will be excited to see how worse a dish can be. You will be excited to know that you can cook better than those untrained chefs. So, today, I went there via little deal coupon for Chinese meal. The items were-
# Soup : Okay Okay type.
# "Crispy" Baby Corn : I dont know where the crisp went. It was yuck like hell. I bet no one can eat that dish.
# Chow : Below par
# Manchurian : The best thing that they served me. I rated this restaurant by 1 star , just because of Manchurian otherwise it was a zero rating experience.
# Fried Rice : OK OK type. Manchurian helped me to complete the dish
# Sweet lime soda : too sweetüòû
# Ice cream : they didn't offered ice cream to us. Instead of ice cream they offered us hot gulab jamun. It was also yuck.
I would suggest you all not to go in this restaurant ever. You can go only when you want to compete your first cooking experience with those "chefs" working in there and I am sure you gonna win. üòÇ
       In short, Food was like Himesh Reshamiya's movies. üòÇ

Strictly NO to this place. ¬†Initially we are asked whether we brought any Nearbuy voucher. We said we are just walk in. The place was not ready at all, no basic table amenities , no salt pepper shaker, no napkin . There were only few guests seating that time. ¬†We ordered Basmati Puloa, Mixed Veg, Chapati and desserts for a quick meal. Some how we have to left in hurry and asked the server to parcel the remaining food. To my utmost surprise when I opened the parcel containers later ¬†at home the quantity was miserable. This is very ¬†shocking and hard to believe even we had paid off ¬†the full price we were deprived of our food. ¬†No and Never come back for this kind of service attitude of this place. BE AWARE!
