I ordered chicken biryani from swiggy from this restaurant......it was very average in taste..... swiggy is charging 26 rs extra but I still received cold biriyani......I don't know whose fault is it...... but I am dissapointed...... quantity was good but we can expect that from 136 rs biriyani......I would say not to order

Once i ordered a chicken biryani from swiggy it had a dead fly.On complaining the staff was very reluctant to accept there fault.Also chicken seemed to be stale and was very chewy.

Never i will order food from here.

One of the best restaurant in Howrah for both non-vegetarian nd vegetarians.
Mutton tava is awesum and kebab is really ve Testy. Food rates are very reasonable.

Good location.. very near to Howrah Station..

Have normal and A.C. both seating section..

Service is good, as I took away so cannot share the Dine Out experience now..
the only con I found they didn't accept Paytm payment even after having display on board..
packing style is good, the've wrapped the breads in aluminium foil..

Food was good.. ¬†with reasonable price..
if you're searching for good food in Howrah Station area, you should come to this place..

Brought food from Diamond a number of times and I must say; have always been highly satisfied and got more than my expectation! Their Biryani and Kababs are of course ‚Äì superb! To name specific dishes - specially the Kali-Mirch and Tawa chicken are outstanding. 

Looking forward to order soon from Diamond! Keep up the great quality!
