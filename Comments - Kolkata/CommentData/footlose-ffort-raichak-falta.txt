It's a disc cum bar located inside the premises of The Ffort Raichak( Raichak). Though the pricings are a bit high, but the ambience and decor is extravagant. For party lovers, it's the right place to be. The loud music, the shunted lights and the friendly staffs compels me to rate the place 4.5

The one and only bar cum pub inside ffort with    a great interior decoration and lighting. The entrance itself would give u a feel like you are entering into a prohibited place. Inside there are few sofa and bar tools are kept beside the meduum size dance floor. The bartenders were nice. I was already having Chivas in my room so didn't try to expend much here; just took a beer while waiting for the dinner to be ready at Orient which is 10 steps ahead of footloose. 
If u are going in groups or may be couple, better have ur drink at your room, drop in here, take a pint of carlsberg and enjoy the dance floor with varieties dj music starting from pink floyd to pitbull.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

The bar is really nice located near the swimming pool and has a great variety of alcohol.Â 
LIIT was awesome.Â The dance floor was nice with good ambience, music and lighting.Â 
The only problem was that there were not many people present to make the place happening.Â 

Suggestion: Since it's a bar, I think that children should not be allowed inside.

Footloose as the name suggests is the nightclub at the Ffort Raichak . Its a nicely done up place that is a perfect place for those who want a little tipple and to shake a leg. The DJ plays decent music and since its open to guests only its not too crowded and so he is open to song requests from the patrons. The bar is decently stocked and we spent a pleasant hour there sipping our drinks. The serve complementary chips and peanuts so though there was an option of various finger foods in the menu since we were going to dinner thereafter we did not order any eats beside the complementary munchies. 
The down side the place closes by 11pm would have been good if we could have come back after dinner.
