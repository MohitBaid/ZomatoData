Very small restaurant on the fourth floor of Axis Mall, serving arguably Tangra style Chinese food. There is not much of a decor because of space crunch, and the place is quite crampy because of the same reason. But all that is made up because of the food they serve, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Do not expect new age gourmet Chinese here...they serve good quality Chinese food suited to Kolkata palate...we had chicken sweet corn soup, prwan pepper salt, steamed chicken momo (actually we wanted dim sum platter and golden fried prawn which they could not serve!) Crispy chilli baby corn and the famed honey mustard lemon chicken. The last two dishes lived up to the reputation...while the others were just standard. 
For the mains... chicken in chilly plum sauce and chicken in Cantonese style along with hakka noodles and chicken fried rice...chilly plum chicken being the winner...right amount of space and tang...layered with sweetness ...10 pieces of chicken always makes your life easier...I would always recommend the hakka noodles over the rice....
Never could go beyond darsan as the dessert in any Chinese meal...same here too...darsan should have been crispier...
Expectedly the restaurant was full...

47 South Tangra Road used to be a regular being in my College para and now the office para. Decent Chinese at a very reasonable rate. The interior is nothing special, moderate in size but their food won't certainly disappoint. For the last day of 2017 in Office we went for a Chinese feast from 47, consisting their oh so amazing fish in honey lemon mustard (the best appetizer here at tangra) and spicy drums of heaven. In the mains their popular 5 treasure prawn rice was amazing though the Kung Pao chicken wasn't upto the mark this time given the fact I have had their kung pao earlier and it was good. Ended the meal with a lovely caramel Custard. 47 South Tangra Road at Axis Mall is a clear thumbs up as far as good Chinese and pocket pinch are concerned!

Walked in this place for a quick lunch with office colleagues,  located on the top floor of axis mall, the place offers seating for 25-30 people.Ordered hot garlic pepper chicken & crisply chilli baby corn as starters,  butter garlic coriander rice with kung pao kai chicken as main course. Food tasted good though the serve time was more than expected. In all a good place to visit in.

Visited this place on an occasion of team lunch.It can accomodate 35 people at a time, not so big though.But the food was wonderful.The service time was a bit more than usual.We have tried crispy chilli baby corn,hot garlic pepper chicken as starters, main course consisted of pan fried chicken noodles, pan fried veg noodles, kung pao kai chicken, egg fried rice, coriander egg rice chicken manchurian, etc.All the chicken side dishes have 10 pieces of chick@en which can serve four and are medium spicy.Pan fried noodles tasted well with a gravy as vegetables mushroom and chicken in its ingredients.
I enjoyed the food in every bite.
Wish to visit this place again.

I have tried Drums of Heaven, Wings of Fire, Chili Chicken, Hot Garlic Chicken, Hot Garlic Prawn, Szechwan Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles that were really good. The best dish was Crab that I tried one time and it was really juicy and delicious. Thumbs up!!

We, group of 6 people, went there last week for birthday treat. Ambience is nice,staffs are good.
Now coming to food, we ordered chicken in oyster sauce dry,fish in honey lemon mustard,hot garlic chicken,burnt garlic coriander rice,chilly garlic noodles, szechwan fried rice.All items are impressive.But the fish was out of the box with the exceptional taste of honey mustard sauce.
Warning: almost all the items are marked as spicy.If you are not a fan of chilly then don't try.5 out of 6 people were crying and sweating.Only starters and burnt garlic coriander rice saved their lunch.

I was actually intending to take the family to dine at Tangra but we also had to shop at the Home Centre. So after a little research (Thanx to Zomato!), I chanced upon this restaurant. Located conveniently at Axis Mall (Again relatively closer to my place) this was my obvious choice and needless to say, the name attracted me. We walked in to a decently arranged restaurant which was quite vacant at 7ish (suprisingly!)
The staff was cordial and since we were the only other family in the entire restaurant, were pretty prompt as well.
We ordered Salt and Pepper Fish.. and Prawns in Honey Lemon Mustard sauce as starters. The second one stole the show for us so we ordered Fish in the same sauce. And it was a very simple yet unusual flavour (for me, mind you!)
We then ordered Mixed Meat Hakka Noodles, Mixed Meat Chilly Garlic Noodles and Pan-Fried Mixed Meat Noodles and didn't bother with the sides. I really initially didn't like the look of it, but the taste of the Pan-fried Noodles stole the show for me. Now we really wanted to end with desserts but the portion size for each was a bit too good for even us hearty eaters. So we wrapped it up right there. This experiment was a fairly good one. I wish to visit again and try out other stuff here. These people are good.

On the eve of Panchami dinner I visited here with my girlfriends. It was my turn to give a treat. We ordered munchow soup first. Soup was tasty chows not. Then for starter we had one red pepper chicken or something like that which was good as a starter. Next we had honey mustard fish. Quality of the fish was alright but the sauce in which it was dipped in was simply superb. We became fan of this dish. Nothing was available other than fresh lime soda for refreshments so we settled for that. Next we had mixed Hakka noodles which was bland thick and flat. Completed the course with butterscotch ice-cream which was tasty. Pocket pinch is alright here. Service is moderate.

Was misguided to believe that axis mall has a good platter of dine outs (which is no where close to being true). So I settled with this plac given it had the highest rating. 
Happily proven wrong by the taste. Service and ambience are anything between 1-2 but the food is really worth a try if you are running short of luck with respect to places to eat.

47, South Tangra Road is a pretty little restaurant located on the 4th floor of Axis Mall, Rajarhat. The restaurant is moderate in size but is beautifully decorated and has a cosy ambience. The food is really good. We had ordered Seafood Coriander Soup, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Fish in Mustard Sauce and Chicken in Chilli Plum Sauce. The quality, quantity and taste of food was amazing. One plate of chicken had 10 juicy succulent pieces of chicken. All the preparations tastes different and were mouthwatering. The service was also very good. The waiters were welcoming and polite. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.

The only thing good about this restaurant is quantity of food at affordable price. Staffs are not good. They dont know what needs to be done when a guest is at table. They dont know how to serv and are very slow. I have to remind every time what i have ordered and then only that foos reach my table.
Ordered:
sweet corn chicken soup
7 treasure soup
Honey lemon mustard fish
5 treasure mixed meat fried rice
Fish manchurian

All dishes are tasteless. It seems that they have missed something while preparing. The only good thing is quantity.

I have ordered from this place over a dozen times and their food has always been satisfactory although i am writing this after a particularly bad serving which was delivered to my doorstep. The surprising bit was that as soon as I called reporting the same, a replacement was sent which was again absolutely ¬†up to the mark and the whole thing was done ¬†within 15 mins time with prompt response from the restaurant every time.¬†

Will surely keep ordering for their above average food and excellent service.

My friend treated us here on her Birthday when we all said we want to have Chinese food and she was looking for a pocket friendly restaurant. Its a small cozy place on 4th floor of Axis Mall. The seating is limited but they were not very crowded when we went.

They food, from the soup till the starters and main course was averagely ok. Nothing great but nothing bad either.

We started with 7 treasure chicken soup which was made with a lot of veggies like zucchini, corn, mushrooms etc. This was good and you can give it a try. Rest none of the dishes stood out enough to get into details.¬†
The service was ok but the staff didn't seem to be updated on details of the dishes like what goes into what. The place has a decent decor and ambience.

Having said that, I would not mind going there again if someone takes us again but would not explicitly go from my end and eat.

Visited this place today for dinner. We had ordered:
For Starters:
Salt and Pepper Fish- was quite delicious and I just loved the crispy fresh fish they gave.
Chicken Dimsums- were filled with juicy chicken mince and tasted good.
For Main Course:
Chicken Fried rice- was pretty tasty and the amount was generous.
Chicken haka noodles- good to taste as well
Fish in Oyster sauce- could've tasted better but again, the fish they gave just won my heart!
Sweet and Sour Chicken- is a good option for people who want to enjoy less spicy yum Chinese chicken.
For Desserts:
None as we were told they don't have anything available.
I've deducted 1.5 points just because I had really wanted to eat that Darsan with vanilla ice cream as written on their menu, which I couldn't. Also, the seating arrangement is a little cringed and can be worked upon. All in all, if one wants to taste authentic Tangra Chinese and is somewhere in Newtown/Rajarhat area, this place is where you can hop in.

For starters and appetizers, we ordered the :
Chicken Thick Coriander Soup and Drums in Heaven. Borh were fantastic.

And for the Main Coursw we decided to try the Burnt Garlic Rice(Prawn One)and it tasted heavenly. Then we also had Kung Pao Chicken which was pretty good.

All over a good experience! A must try :)

Went here for a light dinner with a friend. One of the restaurants inside the Axis Mall, the thing that impressed me the most at this place was the service and behaviour of the staff! They are extremely polite and even if I love the food, their service sure was impressive.

We ordered:
1. Sweet and Sour chicken : Age-old favourite.
2. Moonfan Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken : The chicken pieces seemed a little out of place - more like someone had dropped some fried chicken pieces in the gravy! But since I was famished, the rice and chicken was like ambrosia!

We ordered a Fresh Lime Soda to gulp down the food, but it lacked the fizz that is so typical of the drink.

However, compared to the quality of food offered, the price is on the higher side I felt.

After watching a bengali movie, me and my friend mallikarjuna was feeling hungry and we checked into this smallish but well decorated chinese joint located at axis mall,newtown. We first ordered five treasure soup which was just splendid , and was a perfect appetizer...  since we were running short of time so we decided to keep the main course pretty simple, burnt garlic and coriander fried rice alongwith chicken in hot garlic sauce... the chicken pieces though inconsistent in softness , were tasty and the gravy was spicy . The fried rice was just too good, easy on the stomach and extremely well cooked.a special note for their service which was quick, and prompt.... definitely a perfect place to be to have nice,cosy lunches. .. :)

This outlet is located in Axis Mall. I went here one evening with a friend for a light dinner.
We ordered Fresh Lime Soda, and Chicken corn soup for starter. It was thoroughly disappointing. They serve plain soup with a few pieces of corn and shredded chicken.
We went directly to the main course after this and ordered Moon Faan egg fried rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken.
The rice was excellent. So was the chicken gravy. The pieces were a little weird considering that they were fried. I felt they were slightly dry and hard on the inside. Other than that, it was amazing!
We wanted to try the Tutti-Fruti but it wasn't available.
I hope to visit this place again and try out more dishes :)

A small restaurant with a very limited number of tables.
The ambience and the service was good.
For food we ordered:
1. Pan fried chilly fish
2. Hot and sour soup
3. Chicken in chilly oyester sauce
4. Hot Garlic chicken
5. Butter garlic fried rice
6. Burnt garlic fried rice
7. 2 lime sodas and 4cold drinks.
The food was quite good. The line sodas were a bit too sweet but the butter garlic fried rice and chicken items both were great.
It's good for a once try out lunch or dinner.

The quality and quantity of the food was good. Cantonese noodles and Pan fried chilly fish are excellent. Chicken in Tobanjan sauce is also worth mentioning, ofcourse it was extremely spicy/hot but goes well with the Cantonese noodles as that's not at all spicy. Overall a good experience. Delivery was fast and pricing is standard with respect to quantity they provide.

I had the most disappointing meal experience of my life so far at this restaurant. This incident happened on 26th May and I thought I should take some time to write this review. When I walked in with my sisters there was only one table who was settling their bill. We ordered for a chicken pan fried noodles, mixed meat Szechwan fried rice and dry chilli chicken. It took us a while to grab the attention of the server to place the order. The food was served promptly however it was way below average. The chicken was bland and was cold from inside. The rice was too soft and it seemed to have lots of Szechwan paste but no seasoning and glaze. We still compromised and did not want to make a fuss as we had to head back home until I found a big "WORM" in my noodles!!! I called one of the three staffs in the restaurant and asked to see the manager. The over enthusiastic server claimed that he was the manager and apologised. I showed him my plate and asked him again if he could call his manager. The manager then rushed in and started scolding the server. By now I had lost all my patience and decided to leave the restaurant. The manager offered to compliment the meal. To my utter surprise I saw the same server (who claimed to be the manager) gossiping with other guest about the incident. At this point I felt neglected and humiliated as a customer. The bill was 700 plus taxes but since I did not have the exact change I left 500 and left the restaurant. They have lost a customer for life. My overall impression about the restaurant was that they do not want the business to run successfully. All the staff members were reluctant and were not confident. There is a serious need to train the staff on handling guest issues and learn to respect the customer. It really needs to focus on basic cleanliness and hygiene. The food and service needs to improve a lot.

Needed a nice chinese placw near to my house to celebrate my brothers 18th birthday and after a lot of searches we came upon this restaurant.
We were gping to be late so I called up toh restaurant to ask if they take reservations. They said since it's a small joint it wasn't possible.
So we went there directly but there were no empty tables.
The manager asked us to wait and he was pretty polite.
It was already late so 15 minutes into the waiting we placed the order in advance.
We ordered 1. Drums of heaven
2. Pan fried chilly fish
3. Chicken haka noodles
4. Butter garlic fried rice
5. Schezwan fried rice
6. Fish in devils sauce 
7. Chicken in black pepper sauce
As soon as we were seated, they started serving us with the fresh sizzling appetizers.
The starters were really good but special mention to their pan fried chilly fish. It was brilliant. It was fresh and it was prepared beautifully
Next comes the main course.
Both the rice dishes were excellent.
But yet again the fish in the main course stole the show.
The fish in devils sause is excellent even though it is really spicy. But it is a must try.
The chicken in black pepper sauce was blunt in taste and even though it was a recommendation, I would suggest you not to go for it.
The servers were really helpful and quick on their toes.
It is a pretty reasonable place with amazing food quality and when you do visit do try the fish dishes.
They are fabulous.
Would I visit again- I am sure I will pretty soon. !

For someone who lives quite far from the original tangra, this place serves brilliant Chinese. It may be a bit expensive. But the quality and quantity have always been worth it. Their chicken in black pepper sauce and the mustard prawn dish happens to be extremely well cooked. There mixed hakka and Cantonese noodles are also a must try. Highly recommend.

I have been to this place on multiple occasions owing to its proximity from my house. But this place disappoints me. The ambience is okay, nothing out the ordinary. The service is fine too. But the food here isn't upto the mark. We had ordered chicken sweet corn soup and chicken hpt and sour soup, chicken lollipop and dry chilli chicken for starters, chilli garlic noodles and schezwan chicken in the main course. The soups were okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Now about the starters dry chilli chicken was good, the chicken lollipop was very bad. It was dry and the vegetables were undercooked and salty. It was pathetic. The main course was okay too. What makes up for the bad food is the friendly staff. They deserve a special mention. They were super sweet and courteous.

We had prawns in honey mustard sauce for starters and the sauce was yummy.. main course had kung pao chicken (my favourite dish) and fish in butter garlic sauce (this dish had salt missing in it and so tasted bland). Overall the Food was good and even my dad who is not a much a chinese cuisine fan enjoyed the Food.

Aptly named, this restaurant serves very good Chinese cuisine exactly like the ones operating at Tangra (Kolkata's own Chinatown) but without the frills & zany decorations visible there. The ambience is simple & ocassionally crowded, depending on the time of your visit. The service is prompt & competent. The food, as mentioned before, is very good with Fish with Honey, Lemon & Mustard being a standout dish. Some dishes are a bit heavy on the palate as they use the sauces (Soya in particular) abundantly but you can ask them to modify a dish according to your taste.

It has been a favourite place for me for getting mouthwatering Chinese dish. Just loved it. Tried so many dishes, all were perfectly prepared. Good option for Chinese lovers. Only problem of limited tables, so one may have to wait for getting table during peak hours on weekends. But this is very rare.

Dedicated to the china town (kolkata) , 47 south tangra road is a chinese restaurant located on the 4th floor of the axis mall in newtown, rajarhat...went there  for lunch with my girl, last saturday...it is a small restaurant with not many seating options available...the interior and decor reflects fair and square that it is a chinese restaurant...the menu welcomes you to the concept behind the restaurant and then there are the list of dishes, marked as spicy, very spicy and recommended ..the prices mentioned were inclusive of taxes and were overall quite economic i would say..a budget of 500 should be enough for 2 in my opinion..As far as the food is concerned, though we don't generally go for fried rice, this time we decided to try their 5 treasure egg fried rice, it being a recommended dish and to be honest we were not at all disappointed, either on quantity or quality terms...the fried rice had five different addendums to it , mushroom being one of them and tasted pretty good..we had chicken in chilli oyster sauce to complement the rice...there were 10 pieces in a plate of rs 250, which is definitely commendable...the chicken chunks tasted great...we were hungry and had a really good meal at just rs 450..service was good...chinese lovers can definitely try this out owing to it being economic and serving good quality food with appreciable quantity per plate..

got happy to see that axis mall food court now hv a quality chinese restaurant too.. it is a nice restaurant wd decent decor..
we've ordered chicken in chilly oyster sauce and fish in lemon mustard sauce in starter.. the fish was really good wd that pungent smell of mustard.. being a fan of mach er paturi i loved it just.. it tastes different.. the chicken was good too.. i liked it.. in the main course we've ordered burnt garlic coriander rice in chicken and kung pao kai chicken.. i was really having expectations from the burnt garlic rice preparation bt much to my dismay it tasted like simple fried rice... the kung pao chicken was good too to go wd the rice..it was shredded chicken.. all d items had good quantity.. both the starters were of 10 pcs.. overall i very much loved the food..
what i liked much is the prompt service they provide despite being the peak lunch hour.. and the price was reasonable...whch is another plus..
would've given a 4 rating.. jst that the burnt garlic rice fell short of my expectations so m deducting 0.5 for that..
would surely come again.. :)

Had lunch on New Year's Day at this bistro. It's cramped for space, but the simple yet tasteful decor somewhat makes up for it. This is a place where you can sit and enjoy your food.

Speaking of food, we started our meal with Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, which had the right consistency and ample bits of corn/chicken. For the main course we chose Mixed Fried Rice and Szechwan Chicken. The highlight of the Fried Rice were the prawns. They were fresh, succulent, moderate in size, and enough in number. The chicken that was mixed in was probably from an older stock and hence, hard. Anyhow, the rice itself was of standard quality and seasoned beautifully. 

The chicken dish was undoubtedly the dish of the day. The gravy is everything a Szechwan-style sauce should be - hot, punchy, and rich. So many restaurants in the city pass off a orange-coloured version of Chilli Chicken as Szechwan Chicken, but that isn't the case here. What we got was one perfect bowl of authentic Chinese cuisine. Helping its cause was the fact that the chicken used for this dish was really tender. All in all, an amazing experience!

A final note on the pricing. The starters are exorbitant. Rest is mostly reasonable, keeping in mind the quantity served. And yes, the quoted prices are inclusive of all taxes.

This is located in Axis Mall and was my first time at this food joint. With growling tummies we ventured into this quaint little place on the top floor of the mall.¬†

We ordered crackling potatoes, ginger garlic chicken, and egg hakka noodles. For desert, we hollered for darsan with ice-cream.¬†
Food: Crackling potatoes was toasted to perfection. Crunchy exterior with melting interiors. An assortment of spices dousing the taste buds. Try it with a sprinkle of the chilli vinegar on it to add a tangy twist.¬†

The egg hakka noodles was good too. Towards the higher end in the category of egg-hakka noodles. Being an avid fan of meat, i don't usually have egg noodles. But since we ordered a chicken side, decided to skip the chicken hakka.

The ginger garlic chicken had capsicum and mushrooms in it. There were 10 pieces of boneless chicken in fresh gravy. This place does not reheat the gravy, but makes it fresh for each order. You can taste the difference.¬†

Dessert was mind-blowing. I did not have high expectations of the darsan. It was exquisite. Warm pieces of crispy delicacy, doused with honey and sticky syrup. Topped with scoops of ice-cream. One order is good for two people. I am going to revisit this place for the exquisite darsan and ice-cream.¬†

Service: ¬†The waiters are polite and well behaved. They make you feel special and are very helpful. They do not try to up sell and make you buy more than you can eat.¬†

Ambience: The place didn't look very impressive from the outside, but the interiors are done up simply but elegantly. Overall, a great place for a Chinese meal if you are on a budget.

Nothing was upto mark to be honest. We order a seafood soup, prawn in hot garlic sauce, five treasure mixed meat rice, and fish in devil's sauce. Everything tasted like they were prepared well in advance and was just microwaved before being served. Prawns were probably made into pakoras earlier in the day and tossed in a sauce before being served. Such a disaster for such a delicate meat. They had nothing to offer other than chicken and fish (no lamb, crab out of stock).¬†

What ruined the experience for me was the loud television and huddling staff around it watching a wrestling match. Once that ended, they shifted to some tacky hindi song on the same television. It simply ruined the ambiance for me. The staff otherwise was courteous and attentive.¬†

I would rather choose to pick up food from a roadside chinese joint which serves fresh food than this disaster.

I accidentally stumble upon this restaurant on Zomato. At first, I was bit skeptical about ordering from them as they are comparatively new in the new town food scenario.¬†
Anyhow, I ordered 5 treasure rice and black pepper sauce and found them just awesome. ¬†After that, we have ordered for consecutive 3 days from them and everyday the food was as good as the first time. I would like to mention just one thing, ¬†please be careful before ordering any preparation ¬†in Tobanjan sauce , that thing is insanely hot and will blow your mouth.

Would be possibly one of my bad memories regarding momos for sure. This time I ordered two plates of steamed chicken momos along with one seafood coriander thick gravy soup. The order was on time and the staff was co-operative. Thumbs up for that.
Coming back to the main plate, the first bite of a single momo killed my appetite. It's wasn't so good as I usually have. Even, no extra sauces were provided. Packaging was not too good, I must admit. The soup was horrible. No such flavor as per my taste buds.
It tasted rather like a lentil jacked soup for a sick person. 
Bottom line, not a good place I would like to visit back.

Had lunch at this eatery in Axis mall along with my family.
It is a bit cramped with a lot of tables in a small space.¬†
But the food is good. We started with garlic prawns - really tasty and the prawns were crunchy and cooked just right.¬†
Then we went for main course - szechuan prawns, chicken in oyster sauce and buttery garlic egg fried rice.
The prawns were again great in a spicy gravy with veggies. The chicken dish was comparatively less tasty - but sister liked it. The rice was good. Quantity is pretty decent for the price. Service is reasonably fast. Overall , a pretty good experience - if you are in the new town area, this is one place you can try out - if you want to have chinese.
                    
update: The kung pao chicken is really tasty with red chillies - if you like it hot its worth a try.

This is one of those food joints that would have been successful in the 90s as a good standalone Chinese restaurant. In the competitive restaurant scene of 2016, however, it simply fails to impress. For starters it only offered chicken and fish dishes. They were out of crab while the menu lacked any lamb or pork dishes. We ended up ordering seafood soup, prawn in hot garlic sauce, five treasure mixed rice, and fish in devil sauce. Taste wise the food was good but nothing that would encourage me to revisit. Staff were busy mingling and chatting with themselves, which was a bit distracting. Overall, 47 South Tangra Road is a decent joint that fails to wow.

For a restaurant with average rating of 3.5 you should first focus on providing value for money and excellent  taste. Everything else comes later. 

I ordered hot n sour soup it did not have enough vegetables after few 5 sips my bowl was left with just liquid.... Too much of vinegar in soup
5  treasure rice - I had to do treasure hunting to find vegetables in it. 
Taste just fine so a 3
Presentation was just OK so again a 3/5
Customer service get a 3 again. 

Overall just fine experience

This specialised chinese restaurant delivers authentic chinese food. The prawns with oyster sauce is a fabulous item on the menu and a must try item. The seafood here is exotic and if you are a seafood fanatic then this is a place to be. The price though is on a higher side.

Best ever restaurant I have been to. I ordered a non spicy dish without knowledge and after being delivered realized it was a wrong order for me. They immediately replaced the dish with a spicy gravy without any extra charge. Thank you South tangra for proving the best hospitality.

Food quality is pretty good and they also serve the dishes pretty quick and promptly. The price range is also quite affordable given the quantity that they provide. The only negative thing that I found is their relatively small space which leads to uncomfortable sitting arrangements. One small tip - try their "Sliced chicken in Tomanjan Sauce" at your own risk. It's too damn spicy !

We had couple of team lunchs in here. Food quality and taste is undoubtedly best in this region. Services are good and the waiting time for food is also very much negligible. So all points went there. 
Ambience is not very good. They also have space problem. A restaurant with such a good quality of food can certainly think of expanding. 
I'll certainly come back.

Situated at the top floor of Axis Mall, 47 South Tangra Road is not too big restaurant, in terms of seating capacity, you might expect a queue during rush hours. They mainly serve Chinese food. Coming to food, had ordered Mixed meat hakka noodles, mixed fried rice, chicken in oyster sauce, chicken in black pepper sauce. The food was absolutely great. The quantity, the quality highly satisfactory. The service was great too. We were in a hurry, and they served us within 10mins of placing the order, which we really appreciated. The price is very reasonable compared to the quantity they serve. The ambience can be improved a little, other than that, all thumbs up.

Went to this place for lunch - small Chinese restaurant with not a very eye catch ambience. They have tried to emboss some chinese symbols to match with the theme. Tried one innovative starter - Prawn with chilli honey mustard. The gravy tasted good amd the prawns are very fresh - jumbo size. Only i felt that the batter coated over the prawn was not fully deep fried. Rates are reasonable. Staffs are too casual, but well behaved and service was instant.

It is located in the 3rd(may be 4th) floor on Axis mall. We went without booking, a group a 10 people and could easily get a table. The food was good and the best part was for the starters 10 pieces of chicken were available for each item which exactly matched our numbers, hence all could get taste of every item.(+0.5 for that!:) Negatives, the pieces were veryyy small leaving us unsatisfied. 

But at the end of the lunch, we allll were so full that we could hardly move.. and all this for an unbelievable price of just 2700!!! :O pocket friendly royal treatment I must say.. :) +0.5 for that!!

But the Prawn was not good at all and it was smelling bad. After that ordered Szechwan Fried Rice and Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce. Rice was very tasty and Chicken was very good too. I must mention the quantity of the food. Quantity is just awesome! Overall the experience is good.

47 south tangra road is a small family restaurant in Axis mall. This place is not very well decorated but the food is exceptionally good. There is a variety of dishes available and the taste of the food is authentic and you will be craving for more. The waiters are very polite and helpful and will help you make the right choice of food. The place provides perfect value for money as the pricing is not high and the quantity of food is a lot. The only thing which should be kept in mind while ordering the food is that all the dishes are a tad bit spicy so it is better not to order any extra spicy dish. The Cantonese style gravy chowmein and chicken in hot garlic sauce are a must try. It is highly recommended for some authentic chinese food in newtown.:)

I went to this restaurant last week with my office team for a casual lunch. This is a small a cozy restaurant with limited seating.

But the food was really good. Not very expensive, but delicious....

We have ordered Prawn in honey mustard sauce as starter.

In the main course, we have ordered mixed fried rice with ginger,mixed gravy noodles and hot garlic chicken.

All the food was good. But the prawn in starter was exceptional.

You can try this restaurant for a small causal lunch/dinner. )

Moreover the quantity of the food is quite good and can suffice a single person's meal. The management is good. They pay a lot of attention to their customers even during the rush hours. So overall a good chinese restaurant. Have visited a lot of times. Hope to visit again.

Quantity served is good.. quality of food were mixed reactions.. loved their starters.. there was chicken in oyster sauce dry and garlic chicken dry.. Singapore rice noodles tasted good but amount of the haldi might have been on the higher side.. it looked yellow and tasted like the same.. chicken Hakka noodles were same as most Chinese food joints.. rice did not taste that great.. pan fried noodles was tasty.. love them.. side dishes were better than the mains.. kung Pao chicken, hot and sour chicken and oyster chicken.. overall a decent place to try.. !!

It's one of those very uninventive chinese places that dish out food that taste like they used to five decades ago.Or before the birth of mankind.We ordered sweet lime soda,chicken gravy noodles,mixed hakka noodles and american chopsuey.All were just as mundane and regular as they could possibly be.On the upside,they weren't particularly bad,so we managed to finish our food.The price is comparable to the ones in china town,so that's not a worry.It stays vacant mostly,so turning up at any hour without reservation wouldn't inconvenience you.

Tangra is known for food that's reasonable,comes in huge quantities and is 'authentically' Indo-Chinese.47,South Tangra Road ticks all these boxes.Well,almost.

Located on the top floor of Axis Mall,Rajarhat, this place is almost a boon because food stops at Rajarhat either mean fast food franchisees or high-end restaurants like the ones in Vedic Village,Swissotel,Novotel or The Pipal Tree.There are fewer options for mid range restaurants especially near Action area I,New Town.

47,South Tangra Road is a good stop for a hearty meal in a decent ambience,without pinching your pocket.

I went there on a weekday afternoon and it was completely empty.We ordered for chicken Hakka noodles and dry hot chili garlic chicken.

The order reached our table quite fast and the quantity was hugee.So much so that we had to pack some of the food despite the fact that we were famished and hasn't ordered a starter.The food was tasty, quintessential Tangra style, though without that spicy kick.The chicken in both the dishes was fresh,the dry chilli chicken had 10 plump pieces and the noodle dish was jam packed with chicken and crunchy veggies.

The prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes.The staff was polite and attentive.Just in case you want to parcel some leftover food,the waiters won't do it,so ask for a container and chuck the food in yourself.

Recommended.

Upon reaching the axis mall, we decided to have our dinner there and we had an yearning for chinese. And thus, we found ourselves in a small but cozy place with a wonderful ambience along with courteous welcome. 
We order drums of heaven as starters, and lovely were they. They tickled our taste buds and made us wanting for more. Thus, for the main course we went with american chicken chopsuey. The service was wonderful along with the stupendous food. I just went gobbling down till i was full upto the brim. The delicious food, the wonderful ambience and the courteous service will obviously see me coming here again and again.

My sister-in-law treated us here when we insisted upon having Chinese food and we thank her for her choice. We had awesome food, right from the soup till the starters.
We started with 7 treasure chicken soup and were totally satisfied. It was basically a soup with 7kinds of veggies like zucchini, corn, mushrooms,etc. Fish in honey lemon mustard was a very unique starter with crispy batter fried fish in a sweet and tangy sauce. I have never quite seen this kind of starter elsewhere and is anyway the most recommended dish here.
Among the main course we selected chicken in black pepper sauce along with Hakka noodles and 5 treasure rice. The chicken was very subtle in taste and went well after the tangy starter. The rice and noodles were equally awesome.
The only reason for a 4 points ( and not more) was the lack of professionalism of the staff. They were very cordial and helpful, but not very professional. Like they did not have a clear answer or organised way for tackling waiting customers. Also, the place has just decent decor and ambience. Its actually a very small restaurant with only a few tables.
Having said that, I would not think twice before going there again.

They sell stale food, which have become rotten and smelly. I had ordered a home delivery on 16.04.2016 for dinner and the Chilli Chicken was entirely stale.I contacted them and they delivered another plate which was stale too!! And now I am in bed due to extreme food poisoning. I would request all customers to avoid this outlet as their food is stale and will result in making you sick.

Located on the top floor of Axis Mall, this little restaurant offers Chinese, the ever-favourite cuisine.

Ambiance:
A bright red wall with huge Chinese letters welcomes you. The seating is a little crammed up.  You may find very little space. 

Food:
Start with the mixed Hakka noodles. Well-cooked and tasteful, lots of egg, chicken and prawn add up to the taste. The mixed burnt garlic coriander rice is decent too. But, noodles was the best, hands down. 
The fish in ginger sauce was very palatable. The fish was soft and fresh served with lightly spiced white colored gravy. Absolute delight.

Service:
The service was good. Prices are pretty decent. They did not charge any tax, surprisingly. A little hiccups here and there but overall the staff is polite.

Visiting again? Sure. Easily one of the best Chinese in that area. Would love to try the darsan with vanilla ice cream, which I missed last time!

Okay. So when you order, remember to specify how cooked or fried you want your dish to be provided you are not being generic when you order. 
The staff are really helpful and well versed on what is on the menu. 
Try the buttered fried rice. It is really nice.

There was some doubt b4 visiting there seeing their rating in zomato. But I must say..upon visiting..my entire perception changed. Food is good. Average ambience. Overall you will enjoy being there.  Would like to visit again.

Found this out quite by luck browsing zomato...instantly decided to try it out. Lo and behold, a great idea it turned out. I visited today with my colleagues on the occasion of New Year's Day. 
We ordered main courses straightaway. The Chicken Hakka Noodles was very delicious. It had enough egg and chicken in it. My friend ordered Butter Garlic Fried Rice Chicken which again lived up to our expectations. Try it if you are not fond of spicy food. For side dish, we ordered Kung Pao Kai Chicken which in all honesty tasted like chicken Manchurian but was not disappointing. However the best part was the Fish in Chilly Oyster Sauce. Despite being a non-fish eater I thrived on it. If you ever happen to visit here, please try it.

Coming to the location, its a good bet if you happen to work in Sector 5 or New Town. Otherwise its quite accessible from Salt Lake too. 
The only con of the place I found was the space. It's a little too small for a restaurant. If you are a couple, you might lack privacy. Otherwise for a gang, its awesome! Try it out!

It was a sudden decision to visit this place. 
After going through the reviews in zomato we chose this place since it was near our office and the reviews were good too.
Our decision was not bad. Food, ambience, service all were good..n the price was reasonable.
The food that we ordered are:
Sweet corn soup, Kung pao chicken dry and pan fried chilli fish as starters. All were yumm.

Schezwan fried rice mixed , chilli garlic Hakka noodles mixed and lat mein kai chicken in the main course. The taste was nice but yeah a bit spicy.
Also we had ordered a crab dish but it was not that great.
All in all had a good time over there.....

Never knew this place at such a offbeat location will be so good! Though the place is not that spacious, yet your hunger craving would not be dissatisfied definitely. The Chinese flavour hovering around the place comes into its food az well. Crispy chilli babycorn and chicken in oyester sauce are a must in your starters with the lungfung soup.  The rest Chinese menu won't make you compromise with Mainland China, so walk in for a Chinese tummy yum yum!

I live just beside axis mall and so any casual plan of having outside food gets executed through the nearby restaurants. I would say amongst all other restaurants nearby, 47 South Tangra Road is the best! The ambience, staff, food and the location everything deserves full marks. I just love the mouthwatering schezwan fried rice they prepare. The Singapore noodles also need a special mention. Overall a great place to have quality Chinese food that too within budget.

Worthless and disgusting first-time experience! Even though agreeing upon whatever little available out of a large outlay of dishes from the menu, we were made to wait for over half an hour until we just had to leave due to time constraint hungry and disgusted! During the time of waiting we noticed that new entrants were served earlier than us and when we asked the reason the manager could not provide us any substantial reason.

A typical grab a bite slurp up a soup wriggle a noodle , while you shop . Decent taste moderate fanfare and gives u a feel of satiety at the end of a meal . It can actually act as a filler to push you in case your shoulders have dropped after entering the mundane mall .
An area earmarked for a store has been swiftly made up to a food joint which serves simple  bangali Chinese cuisine at premium rates . You won't be perplexed in case you don't dare to experiment with the menu ...

This place is a tidy joint located at the almost dead Axis Mall and provides a balanced chinese meal. It has a disadvantage of location as the mall hardly has any footfall. Inspite of that, we would find most of the seats full. - There were more people in this restaurant than the Big stores like Reliance Trend or Globus and that too just 10 days before Durga Puja, which proves its popularity. We ordered seafood Coriander thick soup which was very good. The singapore rice noodle was slightly yellow in colour but taste was fine. Chicken Chilly Plum Sauce was a good choice. The price is more than what you would pay for a similar experience elsewhere in the city.

This in 4th Floor of Axis Mall. If you are looking for a budget Chinese restaurant in New Town area or to be more specific in Axis Mall you can visit this restaurant. The restaurant is decorated to Chinese Symbols / Letters to give it a Chinese Feel. The food is good and value for money.¬†
Ordered a crispy chicken dish which was bit hard but would¬†suggest you to try their Fish in Honey Lemon Mustard which I would say their speciality and is a must whenever I visit them. The attendants are quite cordial and efficient.
            

Tried, Hot Garlic Prawn Dry (This was too good), Mixed Meat Fried Rice & Chicken in Chilly Oyster Sauce (the chicken was enveloped in arrow root which I didnt like).

Also found a new thing that they dont allow you to swipe two cards (share) if you have gone with friends / colleagues and want to split the bill. Previously they have done it a numerous time but was refused this time. So I am going to keep the same rating....

Went to visit this place on last Sunday with few cousins of mine. It was a complete surprise for them as I did not mentioned the place where I was taking them. For me it was the third visit to this place and the silent ambiance with very soft lights are most pleasant for me here.
Thanks to all the people here as they did not disappointment my cousins and they really enjoyed the surprise and thanked me for choosing this place.
As always the "Fish in Honey Lemon mustard" was the most delicious dish amongst the whole menu. All my cousins were enjoyed that. All other foods which we ordered was also nice to fill our taste, specially the "5 treasure rice" and the Juicy "Kung Pao kai chicken".

Thank you again for the amazing service, will sure come back another time with more new people to enjoy your place.

Ugh! Went over for a quick lunch from office and it was a bad decision. The lunch started reasonable well with the soup but it went all downhill from there. Apparently they have a Tangra connection which should've been enough reason to avoid this place - the whole so-called Tangra Chinese authenticity is overrated and of a bygone era.

From the name I had an expectation of good Chinese food. I am quite upset with the place. In starter,Lat Mai Kai was bit hard and extra spicy. In main course we ordered 7 treasure rice and Fish in chilly Oyster sauce. 7 treasure rice was one of their recommendations but it was served bit burnt. Taste of fish was good but I'm surprised to notice that the fish served in Chinese main course was not Vetki.It was regular ruhi or Katla.. The worst part was Lime Soda. No smell of soda was found.Basically it was cold lime water.

I have dined at this restaurant in Axis Mall twice with my family. The food isn't bad, but isn't exciting either. Suffice to say that the average Chinese restaurant in Tangra serves significantly better food. 

The other negative I found in this restaurant is that their portions are smaller. So one has to order more number of dishes. The prices are also somewhat on the higher side.

This is a dingy looking joint and that is putting it lightly. But by the end of my meal, I was seriously surprised and impressed. We ordered egg haka noodles, veg Manchurian gravy and fresh lime soda. Each dish was a big hit. Yummy street side style flavours and quantities, really quick and courteous service and affordable prices. What more could you want! I am no lover of Chinese cuisine but this is a restaurant I would not mind being a regular at all. Sincere suggestion - if they just turned up the lighting a notch, it would be a massive improvement to the ambience.

We all know about Tangra, the hub of Indianised Chinese food in the city. The name of this restaurant creates a connection to that cooking culture and automatically creates a very obvious expectation in mind of any customer like me.
Never visited the place. Ordered for doorstep delivery on a Friday evening. Dialled the number from Zomato and after a cooperative discussion, I ordered Lat Mai Kai, Fish pepper salt, Fish in Devils sauce, Chicken in black pepper salt, Wood Ear chicken fried rice and 5 treasure chicken fried rice. The delivery was perfectly on time as per commitment. Then starts the bad part.
Even after telling twice, they did not mention the names of the dishes on the containers. It is only our knowledge that helped understanding what was what.
Lat Mai Kai - 2/5 Excessive baking powder usage for creating the coating made the it unnecessarily crunchy. The actual chicken inside the coating was less and hard - not at all fresh meat. Thick and big pieces of spring onions and salt were the only contributors to its ordinary taste.
Fish pepper salt - 1/5 Poor quality fish slices hard fried and tossed with thick big spring onions, chopped garlic and pepper. Tasteless. Whatever the fish was, it smelled bad.
Chicken in black pepper salt - 3/5 Best of the order list. Light and tasty. Thickly coated chicken pieces but overall edible.
Fish in devil's sauce - 0/5 The complete disaster! The same poor quality fish now tossed in a red sauce which was made intolerably hot with red chilli paste. We all know devil's sauce is supposed to be hot but definitely not so hot that spoils the dish. Completely bad smelling and tasteless.
Wood ear chicken fried rice - 2.5/5 Comparatively tolerable dish. Bit oily but had some taste that saved our dinner.
5 Treasure chicken fried rice - 3/5 Another dinner saver. This was also a bit oily but tasted meaningfully. Went well with the chicken in black pepper sauce.

As a whole, the experience discouraged me to think about ordering again. The expectation that was created through the name of the restaurant died far behind meeting. Probably no restaurant in Tangra would serve such a disappointing quality for such an unjustified price.

A great place to hangout with friends and enjoy the Chinese food. Based on the idea of the China town at Tengra, this place offers great styled Chinese food at reasonable prices. Food tastes delicious and the ambiance is decent enough for me. The place offers good and prompt service and is at the 4th floor of the Axis mall. Located at New Town, you might not find the bustling crowd like we see at Tengra here. And I guess that's what most of us like. I would definitely suggest this place to those visiting the New Town area around the Axis Mall looking for some Chinese food.

I Visited This Place Last Evening For A Light Dinner. I Was A Bit Surprised To See The Restaurant Fully Vacant On A Friday Evening. However.... I Ordered "Chicken Off The Grill" & "Fresh Lime Soda". When The Food Arrived The Chicken Pieces Were By No Mean "Off The Grill", As General Perception Of "Off The Grill" Items Are Smoky & Hot.... Chicken Pieces Were Neither Smoky Nor Hot.....It Was Not Even Warm. Also The Quantity Was Also Same On A Price They Charged i.e 300 AI

Also I Personally Felt, The Service Was On A Slower Side. I Would Say My Experience Was Not Satisfactory. I m A Hardcore Foodie. Dined In Many Restaurants In India And Abroad. But "47 SOUTH TANGRA ROAD" Has Let My Expectations Down

Friday evening - Can there be a better reason to dine outside with friends? 47 South Tangra Road is a small place and has a few tables spread out, but we did like the calm and peaceful atmosphere.

We ordered Lat Mai Kai and sweet and spicy crispy chicken. The former was extremely spicy and me, being a 'sweet tooth', was having a hard time coping up. The Sweet and spicy crispy chicken was a good mix of sweetness and spices along with the chicken coated in flour. On came our dishes for pan fried chicken noodles and fish in butter garlic sauce (white sauce). The noodles was great - I would recommend others to try this once. However, I would be able to say the same about the fish - too much of garlic and too less of salt.

Overall : 3

Mixed reactions.

¬†&

Pocket friendly indeed! :)

47 south tangra road @ axis mall rajarhat... Serves good food, but poor ambiance and service. The pricing of the dish are somewhat ok. On the other hand the portion size is a bit strange. 10 pc of chicken or fish in a plate for round 300.. Would have been better if the portion size was reduced and so the price.

This eatery is one of my favourite outlets. Though the Axis Mall outlet is pretty tiny, the food is extremely tasty. Even the decor is very soothing to the eyes. I visit this place often since it is close to my office and whenever we feel like having some good Chinese dishes, we visit this place. The waiters will warmly welcome you here. Last time we wanted to celebrate my colleague's birthday and we thought of 47 South Tangra. We had ordered Crispy Chilly Baby Corn and Dry Chilli Chicken as appetizers. The main course included Mixed Meat Rice, Vegetable Rice, Mixed Meat Noodles, Vegetable Manchurian, Fish in Chilly Black Bean Sauce and Chicken in Cantonese Style. The garnishing of the dishes were really appreciable. Two dishes were enough for three people. We enjoyed a lot at this place. I go back there over and over again. And to add icing to the cake, they provided us with discount coupons because we are regular visitors at their outlet.

We ordered hot and sour soup quite nice but with very less amount of chicken and man chow soup was quite sweet.. 
The crispy chilli baby corn for starters was excellent where as the lat Mai Kai was not at all good.. 
We ordered chicken fried rice and 5 spice rice..  Which was nothing special than veg fried rice..  The Cantonese chicken noodles was great... Loved it!!!
The Kung pao chicken was also not great and the 4 season veg dish was just eatable 

Dishes were good.. But not so good as priced..a pocket pinch

This is the place I always visit whenever I am there at Axis Mall, chinese at right prices... i've mostly tried their take away.. and o boy they are really good... not a big place though but nicely decorated and gives you a peaceful vibe. The waiters are good and helps you out with the menu, the service is quick as well, so no long waiting times. Try their cantonese noodles and chilly chicken for sure, last few times I didn't get their Thai items though but I am sure they will be wonderful as well.

On a very regular lunch hour of the day, we went to this place to answer our hunger calls. Me being a Chinese fan, I literally insisted my friend to try 47 Tangra Road (I expected it must be having some bit of Tangra restaurants flavours in it). The restaurant was finely decorated, limited seats, but is ok given to their isolated location at Axis Mall. We ordered Fish in honey lemon and mustard, Pan fried mixed meat noodles and garlic chicken dry.Overall experience: Horrible.The honey lemon mustard fish, which the service man claimed as their signature dish, had a fish which seemed frozen and not fresh, not even good quality fish. the mustard and honey sauce was good to taste but the mustard had their black shells, and basically was simple bengali 'Kasundi'.The mixed meat that the pan fried noodles had, was stale prawns (an odd smell just strikes) and some tasteless chicken. The Gravy of the noodles was extensively oily and no way compared to China town's noodles. I think we were very gentle to eat those stale oily stuffs and not complain.The Garlic Chicken was claimed to be spicy but came out to be absolutely sugary sweet. But yeah, again those tasteless chickens,Pocket pinch: Rs 764Conclusion: I would not come here again. I would quote my friend's word "People who would come here for the second time must be having serious problems with their taste buds"Advice: Please don't just use Tangra's name for publicity, get some of their trainings too.After effect: I had serious stomach trouble.

If you prefer typical Tangra style Chinese cuisine but fed up of trouble going through narrow and dirty lanes of Tangra then this is what you are looking for.
Located at 4th floor of Axis Mall, New Town with abundant parking space won't get better than this.
Food quality is not only above standard but excellent value for money. 
We ordered at least 11 items and billing came to just INR 2250 including tax and parcel cost.
Our house is about 10kms away from the restaurant but when they realised that they missed to parcel one of the ordered items came all the way to provide the same.
For privilege customers they do provide 10% discount card too.
One piece of advice to them to be careful and mention dish names on the containers for large orders. This reduces chances of similar experience like mine mentioned above.

Items been ordered were
- Chicken Hakka Noodles
- Butter Garlic Chicken Fried Rice
- 5 Treasure Chicken Fried Rice
- Szechwan Chicken Fried Rice
- Singapore Rice Noodles
- Pan Fried Chicken Noodles
- Chilli Chicken Gravy
- Kung Pao Kai Chicken
- Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce
- Hot Garlic Chicken Dry

i liked the food.. particularly the chilly chicken.. it was the softest of all that i have ever had. may be it was better that day only.. not sure though. its a small place.. the waiters are humble and courteous. but the view outside the restaurant is not appreciable.. all in all the rating just goes for the food that i had that day and the overall hospitality

good option for chinese cuisine... recommended for seldom visits to the axis mall (specially Bioscope)
Not sure how this name '47 south tangra road' came through !

Despite being located inside the Axis mall (with very low footfall at any point of the day), this small restaurant always manages to attract people. I had lunch here just the one time, and the overall experience was quite satisfactory. It is quite a small outlet, with nothing much to talk about its decor or ambience. However, the food is quite decent, and well prepared, especially a prawn preparation with honey and mustard sauce.

It is definitely one of those places where I wouldn't mind coming back once in a while to enjoy decent and authentic Chinese dishes!

We had lunch and dinner here at this place several times and we have both dined at this place as well as tried their takeaway. A very decent place to have good Chinese food if you are at Newtown. We have even tried home-delivery from this place, in the locality they deliver by 35 minutes (my residence is 7 Kms away from this place though) and deliver for free for any order above Rs.300/-. They have even issued me a 10% discount card for one year, so it's nice to have such small little things at places where you like to dine out time and again. I feel this place is really very underrated in this website which can be discouraging for many to try it out. Considering the price and the quality of food this kind of eateries are really good to have in your vicinity. The ambiance is really soothing and nice, the place is not very big though. Hospitality and services are good. Food tastes really good, if you are here try out: Stir-fried Chinese Greens, Hot garlic fish, Mixed meat rice, Mixed meat noodles, Woktoss Pokchoy, Veg cantonese noodles. I have dined here 8-9 times and no issues or complaints whatsoever till date. So if you are at Axis Mall or anywhere in Newtown, then please visit this place and just try out their Stir-fried Chinese Greens. Then you can decide yourself if you want to go for more! Cheers!

I live in Rajarhat, so I know that everything is expensive here. From a rickshaw ride to a can of cola - they fleece you each time, and sometimes its even okay, considering the skewed economic balance of the area. But honestly, overpriced restaurants just don't go down well with me. Don't get me wrong I am willing to splurge for that good meal, but its disappointing when you get absolutely no value for your money, especially when there is no skewed economics involved. It is only the restaurant which is trying to compromise on quality just hoping that people won't notice. Sadly, I am not one of them.
The other day I ordered pan fried noodles, veg fried rice and paneer in chilly bean sauce as takeaway. Firstly, I had a tough time placing the order over phone and giving directions - but no qualms about that. The menu said tofu but they said they can only serve paneer. I said OK. The food arrived after about 30 minutes. I paid 560 Rs including containers, delivery tip et al, which was also OK.
But lo and behold, the food was anything but OK. The pan fried noodle was rubbery and over-fried, making it difficult to chew. I had not specified the gravy hoping that they will do a good job out of it (artist's allowance I say), but they had actually packed the same stock paneer gravy for the chowmein as well. Not OK at all. The fried rice was just about OK, but did not justify the 180 Rs that they charged for it, because I have had better ones for Rs40 a plate. Enough said! Paneer was just a stock curry, no chilly bean sauce to be found. It was soy sauce, chilly sauce, and ketchup suspension in gooey cornflour paste. I cook, so no fooling me with ingredients!

Well, if the management is reading this, then I would want to tell you that if I am paying Rs 200 for a plate of noodles or rice, that too veg, then the least I would expect is that you would kindly toss in a few bell peppers, not just impoverished dry carrots and cabbages which have gone stale. A few pieces of mushrooms and some spring onion could also do the trick for me. I would expect you to use better quality rice and noodles and oil. Ready-made sauces are available a dime a dozen. I would recommend you use some , you really don't need to hire a master chef! A local oriya cook would do just as well.
Having said that, I would also want to stress that I refuse to spend half a thousand rupees for 'Jhoop' quality food or even worse, even if I work for the IT. Yes, it gives me the spending power, but what it also gives me is the enlightenment to differentiate between the good and the bad. Amen!

We the food delivered to us. Extremely dissatisfied. DO NOT HAVE 1. Drums of heaven 2. fish salt n pepper 3. fish in ginger wine gravy (or whatever want to forget the taste ASAP) . The Chicken was tough ( like nataraj eraser). The noodles was tasteless and of inferior quality. Same with rice. Only thing edible was cracked potato( dunno why we ordered that but thankfully). I am never going to order from this place again and would like to advice the same to everybody.

Prior to going through the review, please take note that this review is only for the food and not for the ambiance or service because the only time I had my meal here was through delivery at my office.
We had requested to deliver our lunch by 12.30 and they were prompt with the timings.
Our order consisted of Sweet and Spicy crispy chicken, Fish in honey mustard sauce,Noodles, Kung Pao Kai chicken and Chicken Cantonese.
I won't say that the food was delectable, but it was definitely on the better side. I need to specially mention the fish in honey and mustard sauce. This dish proved to be a winner from the first bite. It had a moderately strong aroma of mustard and the overdose of honey along with it made me fall in love with the dish. Be it the texture of the dish or the aftertaste of it, this dish is definitely something you won't find in most Chinese restaurants in town. The other dishes were also quite good. I found heavy usage of pea-nuts in both the main dishes we had. If you don't prefer pea-nuts in your Chinese dishes, I would request you to warn them prom beforehand. 
Considering the food, this restaurant is worth a try. Recommended!

This is a neighborhood chinese restaurant for us as it is close to our office. Their home delivery is really fast. the food is tasty and the prce is also ok. they provide good portion size. One main dish generally have 8 to 10 chicken pieces. Last time we ordered crispy chilli baby corn, hunan chicken, schezwan chicken, garlic chilli fried rice and chicken hakka noodles. complete value for money. meal for 4 cost around Rs. 1000. service is prompt. the ambience including wooden furnitures are comfy and inviting. i visit this place again and again and till date was never disappointed.

Used to be a great place to eat on this sound of town some 2 years back. The magic is gone after the original chef left.

Used to be an authentic, yummy and beautifully presented menu. Used to be better than the best in the city in taste and price.

Its lost its sheen. They need to re work on their team. Thanks

This is a small restaurant located in axis mall at rajarhat. Food is quite reasonable and good. Pan fried chowmein is worth mentioning. On the downside, it is not that consistent in taste.
They are now offering discount cards to regular customers. The discount rate varies from 10 to 20 percent depending on your frequency of visiting this place.

This place is quite better than the China town restaurants. Decor is quite nice seats are well stuffed & comfortable. I have tried probably all the chicken dishes here. Food is good but it lacks flavour.  Veg section don't have much choices. Soups are only the best thing in the menu. Though the price is on the cheaper side. But they should check the Taste, the most important thing.

the whole points go for the food. ambiance is average except the paper table mats which depict the different years in the chinese calender. a small restaurant with just about 30 people to sit. loved their starters but all were chinese. please add a few  thai starters as well. the fish in mustard honey sauce was delicious. we had to order another plate of it. the pan fried chili fish was also good. but the chicken lat me kai could have been much better. i could actually taste the corn flour in it. the portions were good except of the soups. the pan fried noodles were nice. a good experience especially as the meal ended with a perfectly made sweet lime soda. but being on 25th december, we had to wait for a good 20 minutes to get a table for four.

Heavily Indianised Chinese...
Ambience: This 30 or so seater restaurant was the only place that was open for lunch when we reached Axis Mall at 4pm. The place was deserted as is expected at that odd hour. It is clean and the seats are comfortable and lighting is soothing. The Oriental decor felt a bit desperate though.
Service:  Okay, but I do have a complaint. After we finished our appetisers the waiter took our plates away but kept the used spoons and forks on the table, which is quite unacceptable! 
Food: The Hot and sour thick soup was flavoured with Chinese chilli sauce and I hope the black button mushrooms were black because of soya sauce marinade but it tasted okay. The Seafood thick soup was better. The Pan fried dimsums were nice. I loved the Butter garlic fried rice and it went well with both Kung pao chicken and Chilli Oyster fish. The Kung pao chicken was super saucy (typically Indian Chinese) but the Chilli oyster fish was a good recommendation by the waiter. The Hakka chicken noodles was regular. 
Recommendation: If you someday find yourself here, do try the Butter Garlic Fried Rice and the Fish in Chilli Oyster sauce.

Of late , having been very disappointed with the  food at  Big Boss , Tangra I was desperately trying to find a chinese eatery
which would be as good as Big Boss that was a few months ago!
I happened to be at the Axis Mall yesterday for casual shopping, when I came across a poster which highlighted about this Tangra type food being served at this place called 47 South Tangra Road, on the 4th floor of the Mall.
Wasting little time as it was already late, we stepped into this small but cosy little place.
We were the only couple occupying the seat at that time.Going through the menu I found that there were lot of options available, but as we have a liking for Sea food  , I ordered for the Mixed Seafood & Coriander  Soup with a plate of Pan Fried Chilli Fish.
Believe me, I must say that I was really happy to have ventured here for a Saturday Night dinner!It was simply awesome!
Next I ordered for some Szechwan Prawns & Mixed Meat Fried Rice.In the meanwhile I was discussing regarding this place with the  Manager Mr Singh & could not but shower words of praise for the food.
The  main course  was very well made & nicely presented.There were 06 pcs of large prawns in a thick gravy & a bowl full of rice with a distinct aroma reminding me of my favorite Big Boss!

I was surprised to see that they gave me a 10% discount on the bill & the final amount worked out to be  just a little above 800/-.

Well anyone visiting the Axis Mall should definitely try out this place & I am sure you will be very pleased with the food, service , ambience  as well as find it pocket friendly !Also anyone looking for a quiet  place for good chinese food should actually drop in here.They also have Home Delivery facility!

I for one have decided to come here for Chinese Meal with friends & family 
as we were very Impressed with the food & the service too!

There are times in a year I work from Kolkata and during those times I make it apoint to visit as many eateries possible. One day me and a couple of friends thought of visiting this mall. We were hungry and thought of trying any of the restos out there when we bumped onto this. We were a little apprehensive about the food as the place was a bit empty but this place did surprise me. We were recommended the fish in honey mustard sauce and it was awesome. We also ordered pan fried and steam momos. The pan fried was good however I found the  steam momo I lil chewy. For mains we ordered Singapore rice noodles and kungpao chicken. The rice noodles was good but the kungpao was a let down, I had much better kungpao in the city. Neways this is a place which would not give gou authentic oriental, but the food is decent enough. The ambiance is comfortable, a little small place with about sitting arrangements for around 30,may be that makes the place a little cozy and lastly the place is very reasonable. All that we had fetched us a bill of 900

Personally I am very fond of Chinese cuisine and I found the food here to be pretty great, taste wise, I have never, on these visits, found any problem with the service, it was quite prompt. The guys there are very friendly and courteous. I had tried many of the dishes and found they very good indeed.soups starters and main courses. The menu is not very extensive though, I would like to see some more varieties of noodles, rice and starters.  
I like this restaurant and will go in whenever I get a chance.

I had visited Axis mall with a friend for shopping.After we finished we decided to try any of the restaurants in the mall.We proceeded to the food court to find it absolutely empty.Situated in a quite inaccessible place the mall itself was quite desolate but we didnt expect the food court to be so empty.The stalls in the food court were such that we didnt have enough courage to order from there.So we decided to try this restaurant.
At first we were not sure whether even this was open or not.On asking when they said it was open,we went in.The place is small accomadating about 10-12 people,though we were the only customers.The decor and ambience was just about okay.We ordered a fried rice and a chicken item which was their among their recommended items.The food took quite a while in arriving.The quality of the food was not  as bad as apprehended considering how customer-less the place was.We found the food decent.

Visited this place yesterday with friends. To sum it up in one word. DISASTER.
When we tried ordering from the menu, there were very few options in the Menu (in Veg category) that were being served. We decided to order the "Kung Pao Chicken" and when I asked the patron to make it less spicy, he was like it has to be spicy. We can only make it spicy. (Wow that's a first) The order was like this:
Soups:
Sweet Corn Soup - Bland, no taste, too much corn flour
Hot and Sour Chicken Soup - Vinegar + Ginger liquefied
Starters:
Drums of heaven - It tasted like it was cooked last day and was re-heated 
Mushroom Salt and Pepper - We actually returned this item since it was rock hard. I called the patron and demonstrated to him that to pierce it I had to hold a fork and hammer it down.
Main Course:
Pan Fried Noodles - A disaster by all standards
Butter Garlic Fried Rice - Decent
Chicken with Green and Red Pepper - Best dish of the lot. Still was bland
Hunan Style Vegentable - Reminded me of arrowroot juice. Blank. 0 taste. Nothing. nada.
For such a crappy meal we paid 1400 bucks (incl of taxes). All in all I dread the decision of having stepped into this plane. 
Strong word of advice. DO NOT GO THERE. EVER.

Last week I had gone to this place for lunch with a couple of my friends. The lung fung soup was a disaster. It lacked flavour and seasoning. The crispy chilli baby corn was a bit soggy but tasted good. The egg hakka noodles was a shock. For  the first time I experienced veg noodles with long stirps of omlette being passed as egg hakka noodles. Sorry to sound harsh but street side vendors know better! The chicken main course dishes were ok. 

To sum up, there is nothing special about the place other than high price. A thumbs down from me. :(

This place is the only Chinese joint available as of now in Rajarhat New Town area, not including sector 5. However its presence is hardly worthwhile. The tiny joint which looks deceivingly bigger from the outside has nothing more to offer than a bad experience in terms of taste. I however ordered a take away therefore I can't comment on the service. There were two people one being a half witted waiter, as one might expect and the other slightly more knowledgeable and welcoming. We ordered for 'Salt and Pepper Mushroom', 'Butter Garlic Fried Rice' and 'Chilly Paneer' keeping it as simple as possible. On tasting, the mushroom in one word was -- horrible, the rice was half cooked and the paneer was clad in corn flower. I'd give a generous 1.5 to this restaurant. Not worth the price you would pay and certainly not worth saving a bit of your petrol and giving up "Red Express" in Sector 5.

The best Tom yum soup that I have ever had in my life. Mind it, I have tried it at top notch places. The fish in honey mustard is another dish worth trying. Even their noodles and fried rice are lip smacking. But it's been a mixed experience till now. Didn't like their crispy fried baby corn and choupsey. Overall a place worth a try, if not for anything at least for their Tom yum soup.

Not a nice place for lunch. Went there with a group of friends only to get disappointed. Food is not up to standard and service is very poor. Ambiance is good but nothing extraordinary. Not worth your money.

Overall Rating 2.0
Food 1.5
Service 1.0
Value for money 2.5
Ambiance 3.0

Visit only if you are too keen on experimenting or simply out of options

A word of caution: If you have chosen this place to dine out do take at least 3 hours with you. This place is horrible with their service. The first time I visited, it all most took 2.5 hrs for the lunch. The couple sitting next to us was so fed up with their service that they left half way through their meal. Mind you there no other guests at that time and just two tables occupied. The same fate awaited us when I gathered courage to visit this place next time (courtesy the 10% discount which was offered on my next visits). We were sitting there for 1.5 hour and still waited for our appetizers. There was just a single person who took orders and then went in for helping the chef. We were left stranded and had no option to leave after 2 hrs without a single bite. The food is most ordinary and nothing special to mention here. Plan at your own risk.
