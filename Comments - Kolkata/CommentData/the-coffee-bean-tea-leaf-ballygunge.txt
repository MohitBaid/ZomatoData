Really like the cosy atmosphere of this place and their menu has some great choices..hence an apt place for  a caffeine lover like me! Also, the pastry choices are specially irresistible and simply melt in one's mouth when consumed along with some hot coffee or tea! Also notable is the choice of cold coffees that they have to offer!!

The cakes are awesome and so is the ambiance. Perfect for a date or kitty party or business meetings. The cake is too good but I would suggest avoiding that Chicago cake. The coffee and tea both are just as good as it looks.

One of those more or less regular haunts, you are lucky if you can manage a seat at the first try on a weekend. However once there, the food, beverages and the ambiance more than makes up for it. It might seem a bit cramped at the first go, but the sheer energy of the place makes you forget all those complaints and allows you to settle in for a hearty conversation over a cuppa. The coffee items, hot or cold, are creamy and have the right amount of coffee. The sandwiches, generously loaded with chicken, are a steal. Overall, the perfect place to hangout and relax while indulging in some good company. Can't wait to be there soon again.

Location :3Rd floor of Quest mall
Menu : seemingly short menu for beverages ,be it hot or cold but a vast menu for food .
Taste : beverages are yummy as we tasted their signature cold coffee which is a burst of freshly brewed coffee bean with loads of cream and ice cream
Sandwich was grilled to perfection which was loaded with succulent chicken cubes served along with potato chips
Lastly the red velvet cake was the show stopper .it was soft , creamy , delicious and melted in mouth within seconds .
Interior : wood paneled interior with indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements
Service : swift service with polite and helpful stuffs
Pocket pinch : Moderate

The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is an American Coffee chain founded in 1963 and has its own charm.This cafe located at level 2 of Quest Mall is extremely warm and city and is the best place for a coffee date with your special one.We had their signature  Mocha Ice Blended & Caramel Ice Blended.The caramel ice blended is a must try for all caramel lovers.We also tried they Cheese Garlic Bread and Grilled Chicken and Cheese Sandwich.This place is warm and cosy and is apt for a coffee date.

Had an awesome experience in The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf (CBTL). Situated in the nook of quest mall's 3rd floor this well organised cafe has superb ambience, eye-catching chic decor,and very helpful and courteous staff.Coming to the food part.As their omlettes are quite famous I opted for one Ham and Cheese omlette,Chicken stromboli,and Classic Cafe Latte.As a Cafe I strongly believe they should offer much more variety of beverages.The Quick Bites and All Day Breakfast section of their menu offered numerous options and the staffs were very helpful and suggestive.And reasonable prices. The service was quite quick.I must admit that out of all the cafes I visited this place surely makes the best omlette in town.The Ham and Cheese omlette was just out of the world,it was soo fluffy, juicy,soft, filled with cheese,and just melted in mouth.The ham shreds in the omlette was also abundant.And the plating of the omlette must deserve a special mention.The omlette was plated with boiled potatoes, tomatoes,lettuce,and perfectly made crunchy toasts.Just as a perfect English breakfast.ill coming to this place for more such omlettes.The Chicken stromboli had tasty filling but it could be a lil more tender I guess.The Latte was quite good.I will definitely recommend this place to my fellow foodies.

Well organised cafe. Has a great decord and humble people.  I ordered for cold coffee.  There wasn't any drink to choose between because the authorities deeply regretted for not being able to serve non- coffee ice blended drinks. It was worth being there because long chats while sipping cold coffee is a great choice indeed.

This is a LA based cafe franchise, into operations since 1963. Presently they have 3 outlets in Kolkata serving best coffee made beverages I have tasted. Baked items are in abundance at their outlets and they offer generous portions maintaining the quality norms. I have never been disappointed at any of their‚Äã outlets.

Beware is place is charging you Service Charge besides CST/GST which is iIlegal.
¬†Went there a few days back for a cup of coffee and cheese cake, Had a look at the bill saw service charge along with normal CST/GST. By the time I had already paid using debit card and waiting at the table for the order to be served. Brought this to the notice of the manager there......he said this is taken as an added incentive for the staff working there.....what rubbish....that too without customers consent and knowledge. I told him that, what you are doing is illegal......he immediately took away the previous bill, cancelled my payment........made a fresh bill without service charge and I made a new payment. I should have taken a picture of the previous bill so everybody could see.¬†
Anyways guys please check your bill in cafes and resturants before payment, Nobody can charge you for service now or any other charges besides CST/GST.¬† This racket is common, particularly in cafes, where you give your order on the counter, pay the said amount and then receive the bill and hardly notice later.

One of my most favorite places in the city to grab a cuppa and more! This outlet of the cbtl has amazing ambience, perfect for a small hangout with your partner or friends over that perfect cup of coffee!
Over my multiple visits here, I have come to love their cafe latte and iced mocha. The varieties of condiments in the form of mocha and vanilla powder only makes it better! 
Among savories, I love their mac and cheese, it's one of the best in the city and the spaghetti with pesto sauce is also brilliant. Quantity is more than enough for two! The non veg puff is another hot favorite!
But my pick would be their muffins. Do give the blueberry  and the Apple cinnamon ones a try with a bowl of fresh whipped cream -- It's a personal favorite! Another yum dessert is the chocolate mud pie cake. Its chocolatey, its gooey, it's love!üòç
Pocket pinch- 600-650 for two including coffee, savory and dessert! 
Overall-- this place is much more than just coffee or tea as the name suggests. Recommended!

Hello foodizens!,
I have been here been a long time though,it was a sweet tooth ache thing and being seeking other places were filled up and a friend suggested this place, and though its a nice quiet place to catch up with buddies in the middle of a shopping spree with comfortable decor of a classic caf√©, apart from certain bakery goods wasn't there much .
They were out of ice creams all and any(none) only vanilla maybe...which being the start of the weekend was odd, here's the run down though-
Service -4/5 staff was extremely courteous 
Ambience-4/5  perfect coffee shop vibes and chairs
Food- I didn't feel they had much variety in drinks really that was a shame also any options with ice creams were out of the question
Value for money- 2.5/5 in a city of Kolkata which serves some amazing delectable at reasonable rate be it a mall or hole in the wall, although nit expensive they aren't cheap and really you are not paying for much.
Food-3/5 well it wasn't stale or tasted bad but really it was unremarkable 
Probably five this one a pass for food...but go in for chats and some coffee and muffins.

I had been very happy with Coffee Bean and Tea leaf! Whenever I'm in kolkata I would visit this place practically every second day.
But my yesterdays experience has left such a bad mark that now I will have to think of going to other coffee shops in Quest. 
I had gone with a friend and and had just finished eating and drinking our coffee. Suddenly we were approached by the manager and he asked us to vacate the place as he had a couple of costumers at the counter wanting a seat...according to him. Never in a history of my visiting cafes or coffee shops have I been approached to ask to leave because the cafe wants to accommodate others. 
This was totally unacceptable and hope the cafe doesn't do this in future to any other costumer.

After day long shopping mania a cup of coffee with some finger food is all you need. 
So we walked into this caf√©. The interior was quiet interesting with different types of seating arrangements and we made ourselves comfortable in a corner with sofa seats.
Regular Cappuccino - this is by far the biggest cup of Cappuccino served by any caf√© in this city and it was also made strong, just the way i like it.
Chicken and mayo sandwich - simple delicious and filling. 
Blueberry cheesecake - the taste was heavenly and to quench my bong sweet tooth it was perfect. Though the cake should have been a bit more firm.
 The experience is quiet good and i would love to see them open in different places.
Cheers !!

Comfortable. That's the first thing which is all about in the ambiance. The chairs, the tables everything is all about a very comfortable date over coffee/tea.
We wanted the Iced Mocha Latte but it was not available so we went for the Iced Caf√© Latte with chocolate syrup. It was a pleasant summer treat Also, we ordered the Iced Tea Peach flavor. This iced tea was brilliant, the peach flavor is rarely done justice to, this one was well balanced and surely now my favorite.
Also, there Cheesecake is awesome. Good flavor, good balance.
Prices are on the higher end, like any other Cafe of this nature.
A must go to place, for casual cup of coffee.

Quest mall is a pretty costly place (for a garib admi like me) and that's not a hidden secret anymore. But, of all the places here, I somehow love this joint. And more specifically, I've had just a few items and I go back for them only. Let me make this short. The capuccino is brilliant and at 150/-, the regular one is actually huge (in portion size). Also, the classic chololate browney is damn good and full of chocolate. The service is swift and efficient. Overall, love this place.

This outlet of the said coffee parlour is sutuated on the 2nd floor of Quest Mall beside the nike showroom. Coming to the food, I have tasted their food and coffees over time and one thing that was  particular was that the food quality has degraded from good to bad to worst over time. Not only many items on the menu is unavailable but the quality of the coffees have alao fallen. Today I went there with my two best buddies and ordered for iced cappucino as the ice blended mochachinno wasnt available. Anyways we took our seat and our chairs were soiled and dirty. Next came the biggest horror of my life, the iced cappucino was watery bland and even the provided sugar syrup wasnt enough to impart the coffee with any taste. This iced cappucino is worse than the cold coffee I had in coffee house. Atleast they charge 50 bucks a coffee in coffee house but this place charges 200 per coffee for the same shit. Wheres the standard?? Wheres the name?? Wheres my old favourite 'the coffee bean and tea leaf' whose coffee I used to vouch to be the best coffee I ever had?? Highly dissappointed and Angryüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

It is a perfect place to sit by yourself alone, as well as to have a quality time with friends and colleagues. A Must Visit!!!

Ambience of this place is like one of those old comfortable coffee shops. Wooden furniture and big sofas in the middle of a modern mall. As soon as you enter that side of the mall, you get this amazing smell like mixture of coffee and chocolate and a slight buzz of people happily chatting away while enjoying their cup of joe. It's by no means an old place, relatively a newer coffee shop. But the charm of the yellow lights and wooden decor makes me feel as if I'm home ‚ù§ Choco fudge cake The cake looks like any other chocolate cake,But as soon as you bite into it, you feel the richness of dark chocolate based ganache melt into your mouth. The cake was spongy and soft and I was truly in another zone while enjoying it. Do try it out and you won't regret it.

Perhaps my favourite coffee place in town considering how much Kolkata needs a good coffee place. I like the ambience and the furnitures too. Have the muffins and the original cheesecake if you have a sweet tooth. 

Note: I'd suggest you have your own data connection on your device. They are a lil stingy on the wifi.

The coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is located in the Quest mall. It is a small coffee joint which is mostly buzzing with people.
The servers here are quite friendly and helpful.
The blueberry cheesecake which is served here is exceptionally soft and tasty. It melts in your mouth as soon as you put it in. 
Though a tad bit expensive this cakes and cheesecakes served here are worth tasting. :)

This is small cute cafeteria which remains crowded most of the time.
We dropped in here to have coffee after shopping at quest.
We took a caramel latte and one hot vanilla.
The coffee tasted really nice but I loved the hot vanilla more.
There are many options in tea,coffee and cold frappes.

Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf has been a go-to place always to catch up with friends or family with some good coffee and conversations. Sadly, the number of outlets has reduced drastically in Delhi but was glad to see it here in Kolkata. Thus, I just had to visit. Only one complaint that they should have more of the cold blended beverages available since everyone does not prefer hot beverages. Rest it was all good.

Located in Quest Mall, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is a cosy place to sit with friends and/or family and have nice chit-chat over a cup of coffee and/or tea along with some snacks.

What I liked about the place is its interior and ambience.

I and my friend had ordered for a Double Chocolate Latte, Caramel Latte along with some Garlic Cheese Bread.

As for the latte and bread, there was nothing Wow to it but was good.

They really need to up their quality if they want to stand out as one of those cafes which deliver quality beverages.

Hope with time they‚Äôll be able to convert the present minor negatives to positives. 

Cheers! :)

The coffee over there is not that very different.  It is common like any other.  What I love mostly is their bakery items. 
Along with that. I love the interior design.  And definitely a good place to spend with you loved one.

Located in the posh quest mall the cafe franchise did not keep up to my expectation. The sitting area is quite open. Good for quick catch up with friends and family. The sitting is comfortable while the ambience is just about fine. We ordered to iced cappuccino with whipped cream and the quality was not up to my expectation based on other popular cafes. The service was good. Overall based on pricing, quality, quantity, service and ambience I would say a very general cafe outlet just for a quick time pass.

Where would you hit if you want a coffee at affordable rates? CCD 90% of times. But i guess you were wrong all this times. The coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is the best option you can have around when you are craving for coffee with some yummy tit bits.

Ambiance: Cozy and comfortable.The place is beautifully decorated with some comfortable seating arrangements. The best thing about this place I liked is its very open and gives ample amount of space between other tables. So, you can have privacy when u talk. People hit coffee house more often to have some nice conversations and this place is perfectly suited for the occasion. Also, couples can have a nice date here with the soothing romantic ambiance around.

Food: The coffee were superbly done. Their coffee was ice blended not general type cold coffee. But I liked it specially the ultimate mocha and double chocolate. Also the snacks which was given was enough in quantity and also tasted fresh and yummy. The rates are way cheaper than they feel like from outside.

Service: The service was super fast. Also, the ordering process was smooth.The staffs were humble  with a smiling face.

Don't miss it whenever you get a chance to be at quest mall. I hope they open more branches all around in kolkata.

Located in Quest Mall, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is a cosy place to sit with friends and/or family and have nice chit-chat over a cup of coffee and/or tea along with some snacks.

What I liked about the place is its interior and ambience.

This is a cozy and comfortable cafe tucked in at a corner. The spacing and seating arrangement is good. They have cafe style food as well. I simply adore their coffee, especially the hot Latte Mocha,which could be compared to the Starbucks taste. The sandwiches and other dishes are freshly prepared in the back-side kitchen and taste yummy. It does take time for the order to be served, so have ample time in hand while ordering-but it's worth the wait.The serving size is adequate for a person.

A secret little hideout at Quest for coffee and tea lovers. I love the fact that it has outdoor seats too athough my friend and I grabbed a corner leather couch. The d√©cor is simple and nice. I was absolutely impressed by the fact that they reused the boxes which once carried the coffee beans all the way from the farm to factory as tables. The seats are all different all over the cafe. There are chairs and sofas and leather couches.
The food we ordered were two Hot Double Chocolate and a Blueberry Cheesecake. The hot chocolate had foam on top which was good addition to it although I must say I've had better Hot chocolate in the same city. The chocolate ganache was too little in amount even though they call it Hot "Double" chocolate. But the cheesecake blew us away. It was one of the few best desserts that I've ever had so far and definitely the best cheesecake I've had. It is absolutely recommended. The blueberry jelly on top and the biscuit crumbs on the bottom of this delicious dessert turned it into one whole delicious extravaganza. The flavours in my mouth were playing in perfect harmony.
Yes the prices are a bit on the higher side. I've had much better Hot Chocolate at a much lower price. However, I'm so blown away by the Blueberry cheesecake I think that was worth the price. Can't wait to try their other food items. Cheers.

I had been to this joint a lot but never got the chance to write a review on this. So, here goes.

Location: 2nd floor of quest mall, ballygunge. Nearest store is adidas showroom.

Interior designing: it got few tables and chairs outside for customers and inside, it have a very calming environment. Comfortable furnitures and homely feeling. People can easily come here to talk or to read books here. I absolutely love this feeling.

Food and service: the service is quite fast. Today we ordered iced tea and double chocolate. I wanted to have caramel but sadly it wasnt available. Along we that, we had chicago cheesecake. Now this cheesecake is the exact definition of a cheesecake. I loved eating it. Absolutely delicious.

I would definitely come back here again soon.

This place is my families favourite rendezvous point, we often meet up here on Saturday evenings, to have some coffee, some good food and some good times. 

CBTL is a perfect place for coffee lovers and foodies alike, they make amazing chilly cheese toast, pesto pasta, pasta al fungi and even better iced coffees, the desserts are amazing as well, especially the cheese cake is to die for. Overall a great place with good service, just that it might pinch the pocket a bit.

A revamped high street version of a CCD , with cozy seating and good service. Here you wont find waiters coming in unnecessarily to clean the table(to let you know time's up...u better order or go ;)) . I have been to this place 3-4 times and have had various lattes and hot drinks which are pretty standard. However, everytime that I have gone, I have had the Banana nut cake which is pretty good and I have never grown bored of it and It tastes even better with a warm latte.

Hot chocolate 4 / 5
Coffe Mocha Blanded - Great option if you don't like too much caffeine. 4.5/ 5
Hot Vanilla 3.5 / 5
Healthy food is very good and you can add chicken on it
Cesar Salad 3.5 / 5

One of the bigger outlets of Coffee Bean in the city. If you're up for a snack you should try the grilled chicken and cheese sandwich or (for a healthier option) the Caesar salad! They make delicious  flavoured lattes that are well worth the calories. Service is prompt and staff is very enthusiastic to help.

The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in the Quest mall was a disappointment. We dropped in for a coffee before going to see a movie. The Latte was merely coffee flavored hot water. I specifically asked the barista if he could give us strong coffee - we'd pay for the extra coffee (a service that CCD offers now) - but he said they didn't have that option. We also ordered a cheese croissant and a blueberry muffin. The cheese croissant was a disgrace - one thin, tiny square of cheese placed on top of the croissant!!!!! The muffin was passable. The price - very high, and felt even higher because of the terrible quality of our experience.....

This is a place to be avoided if you are a coffee lover....

The blueberry cheesecake was really very tasty with perfect sweetness and flavour. The garlic bread was tasty and filling too. And the coffee was totally extraordinary.

I tried this coffee place after months of recommendations. Having visited it on a weekend, i did face the expected rush. I loved the warm and colourful decor.¬†
Fortunately, i did not have the complaint i have with most coffee shops; the tables being placed too close to one another making it uncomfortable.¬†

The items tried were the Cafe Lattes, the apple muffin and chocolate chip muffin. The apple muffin is a pretty uncommon delicacy which is also hard to make. They, however, made a grand one which I really enjoyed. The chocolate chip muffin was really mouth watering with large chunks of chocolate embedded in the muffin. The latte, however, was nothing extraordinary.

The service of this coffee shop is a little slow, so do expect to wait a little to get served. The prices are a little on the higher side.

After a long shopping spree in the Quest mall,decided to try this place out.
Ordered for Grilled veg with hummus sandwich, Grilled cheese sandwich. Waffles wasn't available which I was craving. In drinks, ordered for Hazelnut ice blended coffee and another chocolate one. The bill came around Rs.850.
First the sandwichs came...with french fries on sides. I was shocked to see the size of grilled cheese sandwich. It was so not worth the price.
The grilled veg sandwich with hummus was ok taste wise...won't order again though.
The cold coffees were just about OK...nothing worth mentioning.
Overall this place is quite pricy. Not visiting again.

I'm writing this review for the outlet of The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf that is present in the lounge of Calcutta Airport. I could not find a listing of this outlet on Zomato so here goes.
This outlet is well-decorated and staff is well-behaved. I had Paneer Tikka grilled Sandwich which was somewhat overpriced- like everything else in an airport- but tasted quite good. The best thing about this place is that they give you board games or puzzles to while away your time as you wait to board your flight. The iced teas are pretty much in demand here and will definitely try out the next time I'm at the airport.

It is tucked in a cosy corner at the Quest Mall. The interiors are soothing with dim lights and comfortable furniture, both ensuring deep and lasting conversations. We ordered a lemon ice tea with honey, a mocha latte with cream accompanied by the blueberry cheese cake (which seemed to be just too irresistible to be sitting behind the counter!) The service was pretty quick and the staff was courteous. The place may be a bit on the expensive side, but considering other cafes, it is all worth it! The ice tea tasted really well and surprisingly the honey enhanced its flavours further. The mocha latte was brewed to perfection and was neither too sweet nor too bland. Also worth mentioning was the fact there was no need of additional sugar to be added to the coffee, for it was just right! We could not have enough of the blueberry cheesecake for it was absolutely lipsmacking! Can't wait to visit this place again!
Ps- Definitely a favourite!!

This is a wonderful place to hang out if you want a quick bite as well as catch up with an old friend. Although it is more expensive than other popular cafes in the city, the quality of the food more than makes up for it. We tried a Caesar Salad with sausages and a Chicken Mac and Cheese. Both were really good. The iced tea and the iced latte were also beyond reproach. The decor is lovely, the staff are courteous and the service is prompt. Additionally, this cafe has a wide variety of delicious choices in food and I will certainly go back there in the future.

A fantastic place to be at, if you are in and around Quest Mall. The ambiance here is superb and the products are equally good. A bit pricey though, but they can easily beat the likes of popular chains like Barista and CCD, where I believe, that any sort of prices they put do not justify the quality and/or the quantity at all. Have been here twice, and have tried the Cappuccino and the Iced Latte. Both of them were fantastic. Right amount of coffee, right amount of milk and right amount of sugar (Combining all of the ingredients for both the items). Their Banana Walnut Cake is fantastic as well. Comes very close to the one at Au Bon Pain, which is very close to my heart. The only downside here is the service, which is usually very sluggish!

Being a tea person I was very happy to get Vanilla ceylon and Tropical Passion flavours. I consider their hot vanilla best in the city. Do try there cheesecakes, they are yummy. The decoration is modern chic and inspite of good footfall the place is peaceful. Go there and enjoy the food.

The food served is also pretty good especially the chicken junglee sandwich. Even the bakery items are good e.g banana walnut cake n the blueberry cheese cake. The non caffeine drinks are not that great though. It's worth trying this cafe.

Located in Quest Mall, this place is starkly yet elegantly decorated. I ordered a Warm Chocolate Pie Cake. Well, when it came to table, it just looked like an ordinary chocolate muffin with icing sugar on top, but just when you cut it with a spoon, warm and slightly salty chocolate literally oozes out. The outer part has just the right amount of crunch, and the melted chocolate inside is not extremely sweet, which makes this all the more perfect. All in all, a great experience. Just deducting 1 because this place is pretty expensive considering the quantity. Hoping to try out their Oreo Mocha Cheesecake next time. 

EDIT. 
Tried the Oreo Mocha Cheesecake and the Chocolate and Raspberry Tart. Increasing the rating from 4.0 to 4.5 because both of these were amazing. The cheesecake has the perfect silky smooth texture, with the bitterness of mocha and sweetness of oreo coming through in perfect proportion. In love with this one. 
The Chocolate and Raspberry Tart had a filling of raspberries compote with chocolate mousse over it encased in a tart shell. This tasted nice too, but not better than the cheesecake. Overall, great experience again. Must visit place for their limited but unparalleled variety of desserts.

Needless to say...this place just blows away the sub-standard so called cafes like CCD, Barista, Lavazza and other establishments. Have been here loads of times and still keep going back for more. Quality of products is excellent. Service can be a bit slow at times. Ambience is very good. My personal beverage favs are the Iced Mocha Latte in cold section and the Expresso Americano in hot. But the show stopper is the Oreo Mocha Cheesecake. It hits the spot every single time. Love chocolate? Have a weakness for cheesecake? Just order this piece heaven and you'll be left wanting for more.

Coffee bean and tea leaf if a cafe that is great for anytime of the day... a quick solitary coffee and sandwich or a lengthy chat with BFF and everything in between it is perfect for it all.... yesterday my friend and I met up for an impromptu grub and gab and gorged on the delicious Caesar salad with chicken sausages and Mac and cheese chicken with garlic bread .... washed down with iced tea for me and iced latte for her.... the food was very well made and there was not a single thing wrong.... and the interiors of the quest CB&TL is lovely... a trhoroughly enjoyable experience. Sayantani Sen

I need to add a footnote to this review about the Machiato and Upside down pineapple cake that cb&tl makes . Both a brilliant and a must try.... infact here in Kolkata I haven't tasted a better machiato.... and the cake was moist, soft with just the right amount of sweetness.... but steer clear of the spicy chicken burrito... too much bean and not much of either chicken or spice....

This is the second best outlet of CBTL after the Forum Mall outlet. This is being said on the basis of ambience. The food is consistently good in all the outlets I have tried. 

I love the decor. They have a much larger floor space here. There are plush couches and also chairs, low tables that resembles packing boxes, quirky and fun but also comfortable. 

Service is quick. 

The endearing aroma of coffee that surrounds you during your time spent inside this caf√© is one of the best things about this place. 

Food is great as usual, I already wrote one long review about their food in the other outlet's page so I'm not gonna repeat it here. 

Once I visited this outlet and had ordered hot chocolate and to be very honest, it didn't live up to the CBTL standard. It was thin and less chocolaty than you might expect it to be. 

That doesn't make the place entirely bad. I still do recommend you to hop in here if you want to have some good coffee.

The moment i entered the mall smell of brilliant quality coffee takes me here. Situated in second floor separate from croud of food court. Nice place to sit and relax with buddies having great cup of cappuccino in hand. Place was cool looking and ambitious was really impressive. Very impressed with hospitality and service as well. Staff was friendly and service was in reasonable time. Price was really affordable. Well they made brilliant quality coffee and iced blended drinks which smells superb and tastes delicious. In this visit i had a cappuccino which was perfectly made just a way i like it. Low suger and extra strong. Smells fantastic and tastes superb. And i also had the original ice blended drink in hazelnut which was something really fantastic i never had before. Just get addicted with this drink it was heavenly delicious. Fantabulous experience here. Must try place. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all cafe lover.

The interior of this place is really nice. I always wanted to visit and today was my chance. A coffee lover like me would definitely choose CBTL because come on, its coffee first, the feel good coffee shop decoration and the tasty treats to go with your coffee.

We ordered iced mocha and cappuccino both with whipped cream. Banana Nut cake which was very tasty, less sweet and filled with various nuts. Totally my kind of cake and the sandwiches were okay too. 

I loved my coffee time with my sister at CBTL.

When you don't have a Starbucks in the city, you head to The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf! Located at the second floor of the Quest mall, this cafe is spacious with a combination of tables and couches for seating. Though they don't have a proper menu at the tables you can take your pick from the menu board hanging above the counter. The double chocolate in both hot and ice blended is a total bliss without being much sweet. One should definitely try the Blueberry Cheesecake which is heavenly! A great place to catch up over a cup of good coffee or tea !

I really enjoy the hazelnut latt√® here. It is really good. They have a variety of ice tea too amongst which I liked the peach ice tea the most. From the food section , the cheesecake , baked mac and cheese , lavash with hummus and warm chocolate pie is good. I particularly like the warm chocolate pie because it resembles a chocolate lava cake. But at the same time it's very heavy and you won't go hungry for hours after eating it. It's a good place to hang out.

When ever I visit Quest mall, this joint is the one in my go to list. I'm a coffee lover and this cafe brews nice coffee. 

Today I ordered Cappuccino along with scrambled eggs with toast. The order was on my table in 5-10 minutes though coffee was served first. Usually coffee should be served along with the food for better eating pleasure. 

Scrambled egg preparation was good and the breads were a bit extra toasted. The butter for the spread was freezing solid and it took extra efforts to spread it over the breads. 

Overall an above average food and service. Staff is polite and quick in response. I'll like to keep visiting here more often

U can get a ambience and vibe quite similar to Starbucks.. As its said a lot can happen over coffee and this place offers u with the exact ambience to sit n relax with ur friends n foes and hv a splendid time.. Price is similar to other cafes like Ccd, barista, aqua Java n all.. Else if u want to try out this coffee shop it surely won't disappoint u..

Though Starbucks not in town but Coffee Beans and Tea Leaf is the closest option available. We thought this time to avail full course meal option in cafe.
In beverages ordered Iced Double Choco Latte, Iced Vanilla Latte and Iced Mocha Latte. I couldn't find this creamy and smooth as we get in Starbucks. Leaves powdery residue inside mouth.
In food nothing can beat Baked Mac and Cheese Chicken. One of the best mac and cheese pasta tried recently and quantity per portion is huge. Molten mozzarella cheese and chicken shredding spiced up with chilli flakes just sinful. Calorie conscious please mind it.
In dessert had Oreo Mocha Cheesecake, Blueberry Cheesecake and Apple Cinnamon Muffin. Both cheese cakes are different in taste but can't afford to be missed. The muffin was on drier side was a bit let down for me.
Service is very slow and have to chase them to serve it on table. Inside the cafe due to lack of air conditioning vent on all sides it feels very stuffy. Price is on higher side cost me INR 1896 inclusive all.

I judge a coffee place with how good their classic latte is, and here, it is nothing great (also taking in account the fact that it is quite the pocket pinch). Ambiance is at the most above average. My brother ordered a "Sunrise orange" drink as an experiment and after having a sip of that i can tell you , they should take it off the menu as it tastes like medicine (i kid you not). The cold coffee mocha was okay. And chocolate latte was better. I am not sure if they have menu cards for individual tables. As we only saw the main options hung on the wall where you order. I somehow don't like that.
Coming to the pros, the banana cake slice was amazing! Will have that every time i go there for sure. Service was fast and okay.

Hi foodies!

-Intro-
Located on a floor where there are no other food outlets, this mostly remains empty. I had tried their pastry once, it was very fresh and tasty. So this time, I wanted to sit down and try a main. (10th August, 2015)

-Decor-
As you can see from the pictures, the decor is very unique and spacious, so unlike the regular CCD outlets. All the tables are at a considerable distance from each other so as to maintain privacy.

-Food-
I had just ordered a Baked Mac n Cheese Pasta. It's sufficient for one person. However, it is advised to share because the cheese will get overwhelming after the first few bites.¬†

-Endnote-
Do visit if you want privacy and a good meal. Will try their coffee next time.

-Bon App√©tit. :)

This place is murderously costly,atleast for a college-goer like me. Tried the blueberry cheesecake which was good,no doubt. But I dont see the point in spending that much when you can get the same thing at a reasonable price somewhere else.
Not going back till I start earning.

Ambience is very nice but. Very comfortable sofa-chairs,great for a nice conversation over coffee,if you can afford to spend that much on coffee that is.

P.S. : I have had the ice blended pure chocolate drink at the airport outlet which was quite impressive,but again unnecessarily overpriced. The cakes,sandwiches and croissants are too plain,dont even bother. At the airport outlet,I mean. Not this one.

The latte,chicken tikka sandwich ,cheese omlets were too good. Very cozy couches to enjoy your food. But certain items were not available so we had to narrow down our orders.

A fairly nice joint to catch up with friends. The bakery section on the menu is quite the treat though nothing out of the ordinary. The blueberry and the Chocolate chip muffins is a pleasant indulge, the banana nut cake is an absolute favorite. The Pesto Spaghetti is a bowl of green heaven. If I was to complain about anything, it would be the lack of innovation and new additions in the menu in a greater variety of price points.

Coffee. Coffee. And Coffee. 
That's what the store smells of..and that is what I love the most about it. 
I took a takeaway iced Mocha Latte . 
Price - 201 (including all taxes)
My oh my. It's tasted and smelled so good. 
Did not add any cream or chocolate or ice cream. Just had the very basic latte and it was perfect. 

Also, tried the Philadelphia Baked Cheese Cake & Apple Muffin(?). 
The cheesecake for 220 bucks is a bit too excessive. Portion size decent but not worth the price. 
Apple muffin for 75 bucks was good. Loved the cinnamon flavour & the apple filling in the centre. Quite a hearty muffin. 
Pocket pinch in total was 600 bucks. 

The ambience was pretty nice. Cozy brown seats. And ample space in the centre. 

Service was good & prompt. 

Would I come back - Yes. 
Why would I come back - COFFEE. 
What would I love to try - the savouries. 

Value for money for coffee - 4.5/5
Value for money for other desserts - 3.5/5

A fairly nice joint to catch up with friends. The bakery section on the menu is quite the treat though nothing out of the ordinary. The blueberry and the Chocolate chip muffins is a pleasant indulge, the banana nut cake is an absolute favorite. The Pesto Spaghetti is a bowl of green heaven. If I was to complain about anything, it would be the lack of innovation and new additions in the menu in a greater variety of price points.

This place serves the best coffee in the city. The food and desserts are good too. Would recommend the pesto pasta. Its fantastic. 

Just hoping they soon open a stand alone outlet since this one at Quest mall is always crowded. Impossible to have a quiet time which one would want with that awesome cup of coffee!

Coffee. Coffee. And Coffee. 
That's what the store smells of..and that is what I love the most about it. 
I took a takeaway iced Mocha Latte . 
Price - 201 (including all taxes)
My oh my. It's tasted and smelled so good. 
Did not add any cream or chocolate or ice cream. Just had the very basic latte and it was perfect. 

Also, tried the Philadelphia Baked Cheese Cake & Apple Muffin(?). 
The cheesecake for 220 bucks is a bit too excessive. Portion size decent but not worth the price. 
Apple muffin for 75 bucks was good. Loved the cinnamon flavour & the apple filling in the centre. Quite a hearty muffin. 
Pocket pinch in total was 600 bucks. 

The ambience was pretty nice. Cozy brown seats. And ample space in the centre. 

Service was good & prompt. 

Would I come back - Yes. 
Why would I come back - COFFEE. 
What would I love to try - the savouries. 

Value for money for coffee - 4.5/5
Value for money for other desserts - 3.5/5

I have only tried coffee - both cold and hot, and I find it pretty good. I like the ambience of this cafe. But the thing that I love is their multi grain croissant. Simply amazing!! So much so that I eat only the multi grain one.

Having said that, the last time I tried their multi grain croissant, it did not seem so good. But the worst part is their cheese croissant which comes with just a tiny and extremely thin square of cheese slice.

Being a caffeine addict I have visited almost all the cafes in the city and this one is my favourite. Their hazelnut latte keeps my life going and it is definitely worthy of being compared to the one served at Starbucks. The desserts need some improvement though. And I often have midnight cravings for their baked mac n cheese.

One of my favourite coffee destinations in Kolkata, the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Ballygunge exudes rustic city charm in it's ambience and menu! The Hazelnut cappuccino is a personal favourite together with their delighful bakes esp the blueberry cakes. I'm not a particular fan of their salads and the creamy pasta is delicious but not outstanding! The warm and cosy high back resting seaters are perfect to snuggle up and have some really warm conversations!

The interior of coffee bean is very relaxing and chilling and it gives u the homely feeling..There is also an availability of led TV and magazines and newspapers..There is a self service but you don't have to wait bcoz the service is fast..

 If u planning for a coffee weekend then this cafe is a must visit..Come here if u want relaxing and chilling weekend..

Absolutely blown away by the Giant Meat Club Sandwich which was a huge three-tier sandwich layered with chicken ham, chicken chunks, omelette; with sumptuous stuffing of cucumber, tomato and mayonnaise. The flavours were very very good and the portion size is perfect for a little more than light lunch.
Peach Iced Tea is a favourite of mine here and this time too they lived it up!
Banana Nut Cake was something new that I tried. I wouldn't really recommend it too strongly as the usual moistness of a simple banana cake was missing. This particular one was on the drier side with walnut as the sole nuts.

This is simply the best caf√© of Kolkata. And I really mean a caf√©, not a restaurant. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is a caf√©, and I want it to be just that. The ambiance is spectacularly pleasant, and the food and drinks is extraordinarily awesome. Its modern, its funky, its also grand, with all those big, long sofas, whenever I go to Quest and want a quick sip or bite, this is the first place that comes to my mind. Their drinks....Oh My God!! are too tasty. I tried the Hazelnut Cold Coffee and it was one of the best cold coffees I have ever had. Their sides are equally good. I tried the Veg. Patties, which was huge and super-tasty, and the Grilled Kulcha Sandwich, which had a perfect blend of Indian and Western attributes, tastes, and textures. Kudos to all the people who work in this caf√© !!!

I've visited the Elgin road outlet earlier and enjoyed Ice Blended coffee there!

I had once seen Mac and Cheese on their menu and was longing to pay a visit to have it..! Finally had the Baked Mac and Cheese, and it was very tasty.!
Also had the Ice Blended Mocha, which started to taste like water after half of it was consumed and was happily replaced by the management.
They have an amazing array of desserts which when seen will make you crave for them, and they really taste heavenly.!
The desserts are a must try, and I always get confused for which one should I take today.!

I had had Oreo Mocha Cheesecake earlier, and it was so very tasty, that this place had gained trust.!
This time I tried the Apple Cinnamon Muffin, yet again, it was very good, and very different.

I shall try more items soon, and will love to have all the desserts, one at a time.!

Good coffee, but I've had a bad experience here once when the server gave us chicken spaghetti instead of the vegetarian one that we ordered. That's a big faux pas to make and though we didn't make a huge deal out of it, it's a sensitive issue and best handled very carefully. I prefer the Forum outlet to the Quest one. This is another place which I think is overpriced...one coffee and a small brownie/cupcake sets you back by approximately 500 bucks in which one can have a meal in many a decent place in Kolkata.

I have been here a couple of times, the recent being the most memorable one, for a dear friend's blog anniversary. Earlier I was under the impression that this place is great only for its coffee and tea. But this time around, I literally had a wholesome feast.
My favorites: Usually the cold coffee along with the chocolate chips muffin is my pick here. This time added on were the chicken pizza, chicken pasta, chicken puff and a whole range of desserts. The Blueberry Muffins were especially delicious.  
Also, the tea that they serve is of an extremely good quality. They are one of the few places who serve triangular tea bags  (containing whole leaves).

I went to the other outlet in forum and I loved the place so decided to visit their 2nd outlet which is located in Quest. It was crowded but we got a place luckily. I always wanted to taste their cheesecake so ordered their blueberry cheesecake with a drink named pure chocolate. The cheesecake was awesome. Loved the smooth texture and yummy taste but the drink was so not up to the mark. I wish I ordered something else. Overall the ambience is good with comfortable sitting.

I and my college friend decided to catch up at quest mall,beck bagan in one evening. We were roaming around and we felt the urge of having a cup of coffee. This joint was on the first floor and we decided to visit it. When we reached there, it was almost full except one table and we settled there. The order has to be placed at counter and we decided upon iced mocha latte, ultimate mocha latte and chicken junglee sandwich with chicken smoked sausage as add on. They served it after 10 minutes. The sandwich was served with tomato ketch up and potato chips and some salad. The bread was like a plain bed roll with butter in top. The layers of cheese, stuffing of smoked sausages and chicken pieces with fresh vegetables had heavenly taste. ultimate mocha tasted good and creamy but i am very disappointed with the cafe latte. It was watery and poor consistency and full of ice cubes (75%) and i felt that the coffee and coco powder  has been mixed with cold water only. No milk or cream and tasted pathetic. Even I didn't get the aroma properly. Service though good but price was very high.

The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf- Only serves what the staffs wants the customer to drink.¬†
=====
Location: 2nd Floor, Quest Mall.¬†
=====
Intro: I had a meeting with a group of friends as one of my friend had a birthday. Yesterday, i had come here and wanted to try out their stuffs. Already made its niche through their elgin road outlet, i thought this outlet won't disappoint me. Nevertheless, i wanted to try some hot tea and i went to order at the counter.¬†
=====
Food & Beverages ordered:

1) First of all, i started with an order of Green Morrocan Mint. The staff said not available. Then i went on ordering, Genmaicha Green. The staff said not available. Then, i asked him what's available? The staff merrily said No herbal i.e. Ginseng Peppermint, Lemon Chamomile or African Sunrise and all the green teas including Jasmine Dragon Pearl were not available. I was quite annoyed and shocked. He recommended me to go for black tea i.e. English Breakfast out of which many were still unavailable. I am like are you really running a tea and coffee shop ? And how can you not keep all this when so many people are going to come to your shop especially opening at the mall? I felt really disgusted with the staffs attitude as well. No wonder how the shop runs. The English Breakfast Tea was decent. ¬†However, my friends ordered hazel nut and they did not pretty enjoy it much.

2) Blue berry Muffin - The muffin was good enough. Tasted decent. But there are many scopes of improvement.¬†
=====
Pros:

1) Location.

2) Ambience of the place is soothing.¬†

3) Service is prompt.¬†

Cons:

1) Staffs need to change their attitude towards serving customers. We are paying you and not doing any charity. Treat with Respect and not just serve as if you are doing a favour on us. I felt really disgusted as half of the items on the menu are not available and they are running a Coffee and Tea shop. Wow.¬†

2) Not reasonably priced.¬†

3) Bloated menu.¬†
=====
Expert Suggestions: 1) Don't bloat your menu unnecessarily to show off.¬†

2) Change the menu if you got other items to serve.

3) Get some offers to keep the customer attracted to your shop. (in case if you want to make it big)¬†
=====
Meal for two: 400-850¬†
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation: 3.3/5
Food Quality: 3.3/5
Food Quantity: 3.3/5
Ambience: 4/5
Hospitality: 1/5
Value for money: 1.4/5
=====
Conclusion: I would revisit only if they have things to serve to their customers and not just bloat the menu unnecessarily. I hope this review goes out as a lesson to them. A decent place to chit chat which can be improvised with a little change in the hospitality.¬†
=====
Note: Unbiased Review based on my visiting experience.

This outlet can beat ccd and barista hands down and will make you wonder if kolkata really needs a starbucks. This place is simply superb with its flavors and ambiance as well as the space and seating plan.  But dude seriously what's the point in keeping two HD LEDs if you tune to news channles and turn off the volume.  There could have been a sports screeing , I was so eager to watch the french open final. However , they said they only subscribe to free to air channels, seriously guys this is not at all expected and the outlet deserves a big zero on this.

If you are in Calcutta, you are bound to end up in a coffee / cafe / tea shop at least once a week or sometimes more. For me it is to take me away from the daily grind and rewind. Be it meeting that friend, a quick bite, an after dinner dose of coffee Caffeine has never failed me. ¬†

Rated for the sandwiches, wraps and the ice blended cold coffees. I am yet to try the mains and the all day breakfasts here. But totally recommended for the quality and the atmosphere it provides.

Ironically, I'm not a huge fan of coffee. This place was discovered as a place to have dessert after a heavy meal at Chili's, Quest Mall. The high price was expected, but whatbi did not expect was cosy seating arrangement and plush chairs. It has the perfect cafe atmosphere and you can simply drop by with your laptop, sketch pad, story book or a couple of friends.
The blueberry cheesecake is big and creamy and one shouldn't miss it. I wouldn't be able to recommend anything about the coffee, however their non-coffee drinks are wonderful. Out of all the times I have been there, I don't think I ordered anything other than a chocolate with whipped cream or a hazelnut with whipped cream. The hazelnut drink is something I'd especially recommend as it's not easy to come across. I've mostly been there to hang out and spend quality time talking, so the only main dish I have tasted and was very pleased with is the spaghetti roast chicken in pesto cream. It's simply delicious. 
When you're tired from your shopping spree and need a quick bite or you're looking for a place to catch up with someone, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is one of the best cafes in town. It's safe to say that the quality of food is better than CCD and the ambience is more luxurious, but then again, it's more expensive.

The place is a bit on the pricier side, but it's perfect if you're looking to sit back and relax, or if you need a place to sit down and work on your laptop. Ambiance wise, it's everything a cafe should be. My staple here is their non-coffee Hazelnut Frappe. Another drink I'd recommend is the double chocolate. Always with extra whipped cream.¬†Their desserts are really good. The blueberry muffin is one that stands out. I've never tried anything from their main course or breakfast menu, so can't say anything about that. The staff are also extremely courteous. I had accidentally spilled my drink the moment it arrived. The staff immediately cleaned up the mess and replaced my drink with a new one, perfectly prepared all over again. Ambiance: 4/5
Food : 4/5Service: 5/5

The coffee bean & tea leaf is not particularly a favourite spot when it comes to coffee and their Forum Mall outlet is nothing less than a horrid place with super bad coffee but one fine day I decided to give this place a try and I was pleasantly surprised. Soft squishy arm chairs, board games and well lit this place is spacious and rather cosy. 
We placed an order for a couple of steaming hot cappuccinos, their classic chocolate muffin and one chicken tikka sandwich with extra cheese & a chicken and cheese sandwich. The coffee was strong and good, muffin was somewhat hard but again the chicken tikka sandwich was full of interesting flavours and something I can eat again and again. The colourful decor really adds to the glamour of this place, I love their interiors and their ambience. Over the weekend it's difficult to even find a table out here and it's usually very noisy, but on a weekday in the late afternoon it's pretty empty with few customers, which makes it a great place to have a conversation over a cup of coffee. It's a good place and one should definitely give this place a try.

Just the reverse experience that I had with their outlet at Elgin Road forum. Here also I ordered an iced tea but it came with a glass three-fourth filled up with crushed ice and one-fourth with the actual tea. The amount of tea was too less to impress me with its flavour, essence and taste. Unreasonably expensive. However, the ambiance is better than the forum outlet.

Just wished to write about my experience at the CBTL outlet at Quest Mall - Kolkata (unit of Global Kitchens Kolkata LLP) . 

I sat here with a colleague discussing work , within minutes I had a staff from the outlet asking me to place my order , I told the person that we will order in some time.  I wanted the discussion to be over first.
Again after 7-8 mins or so a person who claims to be the manager by the name of Navin walks up to our table and says now you have to order .
I ask this gentlemen that is it a mandate or a rule here that you have to order with 10 mins of entering the outlet. 
Disgusted by this my colleague walked away because this was embarrassing in front of other customers and when I asked Navin to give me his superior managers number  he refused saying that the company has kept me here for a reason . I cant give the number , i am the manager. 

Seriously , like seriously as far as i know no coffee chain has a policy of not allowing guests to sit without coffee. 
Let me also tell you one more thing its because of this arrogance and not understanding  what CUSTOMER SERVICE is , is costing you dear. 
I have seen one outlet of CBTL shut in Pacific Mall - West Delhi . If the outlet couldn't sustain in one of highest traffic malls of the country then you expect to be profitable in tiny malls of Kolkata. 

I would also tell you how important customer service to your rivals Costa, Starbucks is . 
Me and my wife were flying back from US to Delhi , we ordered coffee but didn't have change ,  the lady at StarBucks empathised and said its on the house wished us a pleasant journey . 
I am not looking for free coffee ,  I can pay for it . 

Its a pity you hire such inept people , they are doing so much damage to the brand.  For me this experience is the brand. I would never return.

I am usually all game for writing a long review but this place doesn't really merit one.¬†The double chocolate coffee mocha that we had was decent, so was the chicken and cheese grilled sandwich. Nothing distinctive about them, but not bad either.The place looks decent, the seating arrangement is comfy too.¬†¬†
When we went in there today, the place was nearly empty. So we went and sat on a 4 seat table (there were just 2 of us). When we came to order our food, the person at the counter asked us to shift to a 2 seated table which I personally found quite rude and baffling since the place was empty and there were a couple of 4 seated tables which were occupied by single people. Anyways soon after a couple came and they sat on the same place from where we were asked to shift. And they weren't asked to move. Kinda like adding insult to injury. Anyways, this particular couple soon after called up the person serving and made quite a ruckus about the food they were served and claimed it tasted rotten. So there you go, Karma doing its job.
I don't think I'd be coming back to this place.

Just back from here. Was apprehensive about the place after reading some of the reviews. But i must say for me it was a nice experience. A cosy cafe ambience, perfect seating arrangements, absolutely like its counterpart in forum. Loved their coffee but wish the pasta was lighter. But it was good to eat. Prices are a bit too much. But overall a nice experience. And oh. Please have a map or indication of direction- very hard to find this place. Had to walk for full 15 mins. And please add more varieties of  food. They all look same.

Just wished to write about my experience at the CBTL outlet at Quest Mall - Kolkata (unit of Global Kitchens Kolkata LLP) . 

I sat here with a colleague discussing work , within minutes I had a staff from the outlet asking me to place my order , I told the person that we will order in some time.  I wanted the discussion to be over first.
Again after 7-8 mins or so a person who claims to be the manager by the name of Navin walks up to our table and says now you have to order .
I ask this gentlemen that is it a mandate or a rule here that you have to order with 10 mins of entering the outlet. 
Disgusted by this my colleague walked away because this was embarrassing in front of other customers and when I asked Navin to give me his superior managers number  he refused saying that the company has kept me here for a reason . I cant give the number , i am the manager. 

Seriously , like seriously as far as i know no coffee chain has a policy of not allowing guests to sit without coffee. 
Let me also tell you one more thing its because of this arrogance and not understanding  what CUSTOMER SERVICE is , is costing you dear. 
I have seen one outlet of CBTL shut in Pacific Mall - West Delhi . If the outlet couldn't sustain in one of highest traffic malls of the country then you expect to be profitable in tiny malls of Kolkata. 

I would also tell you how important customer service to your rivals Costa, Starbucks is . 
Me and my wife were flying back from US to Delhi , we ordered coffee but didn't have change ,  the lady at StarBucks empathised and said its on the house wished us a pleasant journey . 
I am not looking for free coffee ,  I can pay for it . 

Its a pity you hire such inept people , they are doing so much damage to the brand.  For me this experience is the brand. I would never return.

A cup of coffee have a lot to offer and a fresh coffee can refresh the mind. I have been here on a couple of times and liked the ambiance, coffee and the cakes.¬†

Nothing is extra ordinary but a peaceful place in Kolkata where you can sit with a friend and have a chat. They don't bother you much and you can enjoy your coffee along with some great conversations.¬†

¬†A welcome change in the City of Joy, specially if you want something different that the other Coffee chains.¬†

A must try!

Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf! One of my favourite coffee shops in the world. And this new outlet did not disappoint when I brought my special someone here for a treat. We ordered one chocolate shake, macaroni with cheese and chicken, a blueberry muffin and a slice of chocolate cake. Yes, heart attack on a tray, I know, but we were here to indulge! The two chocolatey items came first, followed by the pasta and the muffin, so we had a sort of salty-sweet mashup, which worked surprisingly well. The shake was just as rich, creamy and chocolatey as anything you've dreamt of in confectionery heaven. The cake and muffin were old favourites of ours - the former sinfully gooey, the latter soft and tantalising with a delightful fruity centre. The pasta was a new experience for us - and lord in heaven, was it wicked good! Cheesy, creamy and utterly zesty. There were plenty of chicken pieces, and the addition of chilli flakes only enhanced the flavour. The quantity was absolutely sufficient for the two of us, especially when complemented with the two desserts. After we polished our plates we were conscious of a feeling of internal bliss, that only concludes the best of gastronomical treats! 
Yes, I am aware of how enthusiastically I have peppered my review with compliments. But really, that meal was epic. I haven't eaten so well in simply ages. And need I even add how fervently I urge foodies to rush there right away?

Such a nice atmosphere of the overall place. The seating arrangements are so lovely. Cosy place. Good place to hang out with both friends and family. Went there with mom and it was a lovely experience altogether. We ordered for the Garden Veg Club Sandwich (which was great), Iced Tea (again a delicious one) and a cup of regular Cafe Latte (which was just wow)... :-)

I have been a huge fan of Coffee Bean but this one seemed to disappoint me twice. The first time I ordered Cold Coffee and a brownie and my friend ordered a sandwich and Cafe Frappe. I did not like the taste of the coffee but the ambience is cosy and the location is convenient.¬†
The second time we went both of us ordered coffee, I ordered a Cappuccino and my friend ordered Cold Coffee. The taste was disappointing.
The service at the counter is pretty decent but once we were seated, then it was a different story all together. There was a girl clearing cups and glasses and allthough the place was half full, she came every 5 minutes to clear our cups. It was pretty annoying and overall something that stayed with me, had the coffee been better, this would have been pardoned. I would not go here again in a hurry unless they drastically improve!!
Coffee for two came to 340 bucks plus taxes, a little on the higher side.

Dropped in CBTL, Quest mall for the first time after some shopping, the last evening . I must say, the interiors look far better and cozier than their forum,elgin outlet.
We ordered
-2 regular cappucino (made strong on request)
-1 iced hazlenut latte
-Spaghetti with roast chicken and pesto cream.

I loved my large mug of hot cuppa,thick and strong,they even made some designs on request :P The staff was very friendly :)
My friend also praised her latte.
The pesto spaghetti was like heaven on plate...superb!! The quantity was great and was truely value for money!
I was drooling over their chocolate pie and cheesecakes, but due to time constraints ,i got a chocolate muffin warmed and packed for myself, and its needless to describe how sweet my journey to home was..sooo chocolately and sinful

After a tiring day day at office i was craving for a coffee and my colleague friend was up for a pepping hot plate of pizza...immediately we searched our reliable zomato...n found this cafe in Quest Mall bang opposite to our office...not giving a 2nd thought we headed towards the cafe...pretty lovely decor...with brick walls....high back couches....cushioned stools...overall the decor was really nice...v both loved it....now choosing the menu....we quickly went through the list...n decided to order:
(a) Iced Caramel Latte
(b) Spaghetti Roast Chicken Pesto cream
(c) Chocolate Muffin
The Spaghetti was...heavenlllyyyyyyy...it was creamy...n yummmy...n so filling.....v just loved it.....the latte was nicely done...refreshing.....bt the choco muffin was a bit dry to our taste...it could have been better we thought...The pocket pinch was just like other cafes in town...But i really wanna ask one thing to the authorities....what exactly is the difference between "Service Tax" and "Service charge"? We are charged both on the bill...so if any1 can explain the theory? moreover its kind of half self service and half they served us....we had to go up to the counter to place the order....n if we want extra spoon/straw/fork...we are shown a table were we can help ourselves...so why service tax & service charge both??

A short visit is enough to know this place.
I was hanging around the Quest Mall(if anything is there to quest for),  when I  found this place. The regular gossip freaks, who are bored visiting CCD and Barista. They can surely breath a bit here. A bit costly(as costly as Barista)place to sit for, but surely the tastes of Latte,Mocha or Double chocolate will make you forget the cost as well as old caffeine taste...
I am always a rookie about tasting new food or drinks..so I try to order the basics with the new items. Here I started with Mocha regular(iced)and Blueberry cheese cake, which I found as worthy in taste (yummm) as it looks from outside...fond of chocolates, so tasted Double chocolate and Chocolate muffin. These did my day...wish to visit it again.

So, it took a national holiday and a quick break from the work to visit the quest mall and we ended up at this beautifully crafted coffee shop located at the second floor inside the quest mall, bang opposite the adidas store. It was a quite afternoon and they had few tables occupied.  It is indeed a beautifully done cafe with very comfy seating arrangements.  We ordered two drinks from their ice blended section. Mocha ice blends and hazelnut blend.  Drinks were average. The dessert that we had was warm chocolate pie, with melted chocolate inside. It was too sweet tho. Decent enough tho and quite enough for two people considering the sweetness level of the dessert.  Service was quick and prompt. Surely a place to visit after some shopping at quest mall for some quick bites and refreshments.

I dropped in with a friend yesterday evening , wanting to drive away my mid monsoon blues. ¬†This was my second visit to this place. We went for two ' Chicken Junglee Sandwitches ' which had chicken and coleslaw leaves in it; and two single cappuccino. The sandwiches which took a while to arrive; were filling enough to skip my subsequent dinner . ¬†The cappuccino though not extraordinary definitely scores above the CCD fare. The bill was for around 700, so some would find this a little pricey; but for special needs like mine, namely ' driving away the monsoon blues' , that may not become an issue. ¬†The service here is a bit standoffish, but somehow that suits me. We did walk out with a smile.

hhhhhmmmm, i find the ordering system annoying , i wish the waiters could come to the table and take your order anyway i decided to have coffee and cake after shopping, my cafe latte arrived first and after 10mins my husband drink arrives , what kind of system is that ??? when a person goes to a cafe with there parters they expect to have food/drinks at the same time!!
only 2 waiters so i guess they need to employ more staff.¬†
the Oreo cheese cake was ok, nothing special.
the seating arrangement and the size of the cafe is however pleasant :-)

Very well decorated place at the 2nd floor of quest mall. had a nice ambience & feel to the place . Ordered one hazelnut & cafe latte cold coffee along with chicken tandoori sandwich . The coffee was nice ( better than CCD) as well as the sandwich. prices were little on the higher side but I guess tht we would expect having a outlet at the quest mall.
Need to try some more options . overall a nice place to hangout with your friends.

Unlike it's Elgin road counterpart, this outlet is roomy and one can enjoy conversation without being drowned out by someone else. 

I liked the Hot chocolate, which was hot and very chocolaty and i highly recommend their oreo mocha cheesecake. Also enjoyed the vanilla latte and the chocolate fudge cake. They were imply delectable! 

Prices are on par with other noted coffee shops and quality better than most.

OMG!!! 852 for four people having only two hot coffee and two hot chocolate with two muffins and that also baad! CRAZY! Knowing it was pricey I still went in with my parents for some afternoon coffee and snacks. I took for granted it will be at least at the level of Starbucks In Orion Mall,Bangalore. What a disappointment!! The coffee tasted regular no memorable aroma to talk about, no lingering taste to note down. The Hot Chocolate tasted like Horlics (Chocolate Flavor atleast). The blueberry and the choco chip muffin were only Warm and thats all. They wre hard and dry, so much so that I actually choked. Service so poor (only with two tables with customer) that they didn't even come up with the water my sister asked for quickly.And to top that paying such a hefty bill made me hear some taunts from Dad about my choice of cafes. Disheartened totally.

This has been a phase where I go A for Apple, B for Ball and C For Cheesecake. So when we came across this place that served oreo and mocha cheesecake along with the classic blueberry one, trying it out became more of a compulsion. 
The oreo and mocha one was a revelation... the crust wasn't crispy/crumbly but the rich chocolate flavour with enough mocha in it gave that extra zing. The blueberry one was just what we expected but the consistency of the cheesecake was so awesome that we were left wanting for more. 
Service
It was pretty swift and clutter-free
Verdict
A quaint place with a tad bit overpriced menu but it was a good enough experience to make us want to return here a bit later because this sojourn did pinch our pockets a little bit.

I'm a BIG lover of CHEESECAKES. I went to Quest Mall today and discovered that this place sells cheesecakes. So me and my friend who by the way has the same fondness for cheesecakes like me, hopped into the shop. We ordered one each of OREO MOCHA CHEESECAKE & BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE. The prices are a bit on the higher side but yes it's affordable. It was served to us within a minute or two and without wasting a fraction of a second we started digging into the two gorgeous cheesecakes which were lying just in front of us. The Blueberry one was soft, supple, layered with the perfect thickness of biscotti and topped with blueberry sauce. To sum it up it was just impeccably DELICIOUS. Now coming to the Oreo Mocha Cheesecake. The consistency of this one was a bit different from a normal cheesecake but it is very delicious too. It was layered with Oreo biscuits and had the perfect blend of coffee and chocolate in it. It was flanked on the top with a thin slice of chocolate which added to its beauty. To sum it up the Oreo Mocha Cheesecake was a treat for both our eyes and tummy. And last but not the least, the ambiance was excellent too and you can spend hours after hours sitting here and chatting with friends, family, etc. It is a perfect place to take a girl out on a date too. Trust me guys she will love it. As a whole I loved the place and would definitely like to visit again.

This place in Quest is quite cool, but on various recent visit, the treatment out there towards customers is quite poor. They don't reply properly and get bothered if you ask them for any advice. I have an Apple store Imagine in the ground floor and had getting this feedback from few of my friends too. Might be the team is not happy or are not trained well to care of customers who are ready to pay a premium for a cup of coffee.

Disheartened, disappointed. That was my experience last evening. My man wanted to have a nice evening to sit and talk over some good food, so i picked this cafe. It is a nice place, perfect setup with comfortable sitting arrangement. I liked the fact that there was something on the television that wasn't sports ( don't judge me, but the last cafe i went had a replay of IPL match on  when the season was already over!! ) but the music was again, same old common English songs.But then again, we have stopped expecting anything else by now.
Coming to the food, we went to the counter and picked double hot chocolate and cheese croissant. We had an entire evening to spend here so thought of ordering the rest later. But there was no later. The double hot chocolate had nothing double or single or slightest chocolaty in it. It was plain drinking chocolate in frothed milk. When will the hip Calcutta cafes understand that a hot chocolate tastes different than a "health drink". It is a nice cafe , u put so much for the decor and the charges are not exactly pocket friendly, but u can't produce a decent hot chocolate.That is really a set back. The croissant was okay, nothing extraordinary.But the hot chocolate had turned my heart cold, so i didn't venture into coffee and desserts as i had intended.What really saddened me is that the place had huge potential, but as the saying goes, u cannot please everyone.So we are on that "not so impressed" list among so many who find their bliss here.

The usual hangout every time I visit the mall cause I always need my fix of caffeine don't I.
The staff definitely need to up the anti and get their act together or I would need to get my fix somewhere else. Decent menu to choose from and price wise just fits the pocket. I ain't cheap but who does not want a bang for their buck.

For a coffee shop their Spaghetti roast chicken pesto cream was just awesome and quite a meal.

Worth a visit to relax and kick back after all the shopping.

Well the aroma of coffee tempts a coffee lover like me to definitely have a coffee even on a hot sunny day.. So well there I was.. Tried the Philadelphia cheese cake which had a nice texture was good to taste ( but I still prefer a berry cheese cake). the coffee which was infused coffee- cinnamon flavor was quite complimentary with the cheese cake. Loved the grand cup and the taste of the coffee. quite nice. 
However they need to teach their staff to be more polite and train them on taking orders as well.

Pretty chilled out place ..this was located in forum and I had gone to meet bf. 
I personally prefer sitting outside. 
So since I was on a diet I remember ordering hot chocolate with Creme. (Mind you on a diet) 
Bf ordered extra cheese sandwich and coffee 
From which I hogged too. 
Hot chocolate ~ it was okay , nothing at all very special. 
Sandwich ~ again it was just fine but the quantity was good.

A group of idle-minded hungry hogs reached Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf around 6.30 in the evening. After seating themselves, they decided to order. Caramel Latte, Regular Latte, Iced Chocolate, Cappuccino were succinctly ordered. The first round of Caramel Latte and Cappuccino lacked the punch, and wasn't made well, so when we complained, they were quickly replaced by a hot, strong brew which pleased us plenty. 

The Oreo Mocha cheesecake came and was devoured under 1 minute. It was quite delicious, with a dense base, creamy and fluffy filling, and a caramel top. 

The masala omelette was all right, but the cheese omelette was light and tasty. The Mac 'n Cheese was average, the Cheese sauce not very cheesy, but veering more towards milkiness which I sort of did not like.

However, a nice place to have a chat in, and laze around in Quest Mall. The photo attests to our level of comfort. :D

This place beats all the Coffee Days combined hands down. What I love is that rather than sitting back on their laurels and the patronage of their loyal customers these guys push themselves to improve and excel. The quality of both the food and the beverages are very good and I always enjoy my experiences here be it a brief stopover to grab a beverage or a leisurely sit in to catch up with friends ! 
Lets start with the beverages .... the Moroccan Mint and Estate Darjeeling Tea and Hazelnut Latte and Cappuccino are delightful as hot beverages and my personal picks.With summer around the corner let me recommend the Iced Caramel Latte , Sunrise Orange Iced Blend and the Iced Tea all of which are excellent.
The food selection leaves me with the delightful task of never being able to make up my mind as there are so many temptations in this section. As a die-hard breakfast fan I love the concept of the All Day Breakfast ..... Personal pick Scrambled Egg with a Butter Croissant and Smoked Chicken Sausages ...yummmmm. Try the Chili Cheese Baguette , Giant Meat Club and the Baked Mac and Cheese as they are all very well prepared. Last but definitely not the least order yourself a Cheese Cake and sit back and enjoy it. If your too full pack yourself one or you will be missing out on one of the best made Cheesecakes available in the city :-)

Ok ! I am a avid Coffee bean and tea leaf fan . And when i am on a diet I have stopped going to forum because every time I see the board of coffee bean I just convince myself that I will just have a black coffee and then I am smitten . 

This time I was walking through quest mall and I was not expecting coffee bean and tea leaf here  and it came in front of me like a Spying better half and said GOTCHA! 

I again got myself a regular americano ( which is double the size of a regular at any other cafe). Then came the croissant, soon the biscotti followed. Thankfully I resisted the cheesecake that is sooo soo sinful always . I don't know why i didn't see another of their yummy things that is the peanut butter bar.  just hope they haven't discontinued it :( 

P.s. you guys rock!

Viola! This outlet at Quest is a complete delight.
Compared with its twin at Forum, this is almost the same in size and yes its bright. The lights are warm, mute and makes you feel very comfortable. I have been a fan of CBTL, ever since I discovered it in Zomato. So, I was glad to find out that CBTL has opened another branch in Quest Mall too.
So, I was recently shopping from Quest Mall and that is when I thought of paying this outlet a visit and I am so glad I did.
We made ourselves comfortable (Yes they have really comfortable chairs to sit on) and then decided to order the following :

1. Cafe Latte
2. Iced Caramel Coffee
3. Chicken Orange sandwich

The service was prompt and the server was nice. Amiable you know.
The food was really good. I even had my heart on the philadelphia cheesecake which was almost glistening from within the counter and begging me to take it away right there but considering my calorie gaining tendency, I let go of it.
But I swear by Virgin Mary, I'll take it away the next time.

The cafe latte was good. We had opted for the w/o cream, so it was not that frothy and trust me, it still tasted good. We loved the bru.
Next in line, this is the BEST thing i've ever had in the range of iced coffee.
The caramel iced coffee was a revelation that was so huge that I was already craving to order one more. This cold coffee is lip smacking and is just delicious, the combination of caramel and coffee created a sweet whirlpool in my mouth. The drink is pretty thick too.

And the sandwich was something I had never tasted before. Chicken combined with orange left a huge curiosity in my head right after ordering it. What came was two big sliced of brown bread. Sandwiches between them were fresh lettuce, chicken and orange flavored cheese.
Yes, you heard me right.  They came with wafers. This sandwich was delicious. The combination of the cheese, the chicken was so good. My tastebuds were pampered to the hilt.

To  conclude, I had an amazing experience here.

I am so coming back for more again.
Cheers! :)
