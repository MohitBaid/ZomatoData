we ordered  egg noodles, mongolian rice and chilly chicken. The noodles was very thick but still okayish, chilly chicken was a bit sour due to excess soya sauce. we were very disgusted with the Mongolian rice, even the smell was a bit sour.They have charged ,
Packaging +delivery =80
Tip=30, is a total waste of money.
 The only plus  is that they were very prompt to deliver our food .

Its a delivery joint in Rajarhat. The man who took the call to take the order was polite. The delivery was in  time, roughly 45 minutes as promised.
Packaging was okay. however, tissues and sauce should be given, along with disposable cutlery for take away.
Food was delivered hot.
Hot and sour soup: okay, nothing special
Chilli chicken dry: again kind of okay
Hakka noodle: really thick noodles were used
Garlic chicken: gravy was good but chicken didn't seem fresh.
Quantity was good for all the dishes.
I would reorder only when there is no other option.t hey need to work on taste.

We ordered for the first time from this place. Initially the lady who answered the phone was extremely polite. But even after 2 hours when our order had not been delivered we called her and she was extremely rude. She went to the extent of hanging up the phone in the middle of our conversation. In the end we had no other option than to return the food that was sent.

Food is decent and value for money. We've always opted for home delivery from them.
The quality of packaging is good and the food stays warm. I specially like the way they secure the bowls by tapes so that there is no spillage.
If you want Chinese food at a good price, definitely a place to consider.

well.... i saw throgh the menu... quite interesting it was... after turning and twisting the menu i managed myself to order combo meal of 1.egg friedrice+chilli chicken+chicken drumstick and 2.. the same combo instead of chicken drumstick, it was chicken momo...
and a coke off 500 ml...
the whole meal took more than 1hr to reach my home..
it reached... i was happy about the packaging...
neat and tidy..
1st i tasted the momo.. i loved it..
then the drumstick... i loved it more..
then comes the main course...
the friedrice was enough to make my tummy happy and sorted.. the chilli chicken was good.. the amount of gravy was enough...
me and my boyfriend both enjoyed the meal followed by the coke.. thank you copper wok.. would love to taste more of your food.. üòöüòöüòö i am so happy..

I have ordered one steam pork momo, one chilli pork, one pork noodles.

The food wasn't up to the mark.

Pork momo wasn't fresh. The noodles was OK. N the worst part was the chilli pork. It has no taste, pork meat was so rubbery n the gravy has no salt.

Waste of money.

Ordered Dragon Chicken, Salt and Pepper Chicken, Chicken Chowmein, Mixed Chowmein, Hot Garlic Chicken, and Chili Fish via Swiggy.

The taste of all the items are below subpar. The salt and pepper chicken was overloaded with chopped onions. Dragon chicken was a uncharacteristically sweet with small cube of chickens in a huge wrap of cornflour batter. The chowmein dishes do not even come close to the taste of noodles served in the smallest joints of Tyangra.

The two side dishes were equally subpar in taste.

We ordered chicken burnt garlic rice and chicken shyapta from this restaurant yesterday. They took almost 2 hr to deliver it to Ecospace and charged Rs.60 as delivery charge plus Rs. 10 for packing. When I asked why they are charging this much their behaviour was awful. When we unpacked the container there was egg rice instead of chicken.
Please do not ever go for this outlet. Pathetic!!

Took a delivery from this restaurant recently. I was really expecting good & quality chinese food but unfortunately their quality &  taste was horrible. I had ordered drums of heaven, garlic prawn, ginger fish, chilly chicken and hot & sour chicken soup. The soup was salty and in plain words absolutely tasteless and worthless. Drums of heaven was little sweet and hot which was OK tastewise in comparison to all other dishes.Garlic Prawn , ginger fish (white gravy)and chilli chicken - i  felt i was having cornflour curry. The coating and gravy was thick and gooey , not well done or cooked. The gravy had the typical cornstarch taste. Was a total disaster. I dont know what specialty their chef added to the items as for few dishes it was mentioned that chef adds his or her twist to them. Dont know what twist was added but the dishes were below average and tasteless. 
Waste of money and loss of appetite. Only good was Delivery was on time.

An amazing home delivery service indeed... We ordered 1plate chilli chicken consisting of 8pieces , 1 plate garlic chicken consisting of 8 pieces and two plates of chicken noodles. Each of the items was delicious and particularly the garlic chicken was really lip smacking . 

There's only one thing that was below our expectation and that is we ordered 2 plates of chicken noodles and had expected that it would be sufficient for three. Unfortunately the quantity in each plate was less thereby leading to some inconvenience .


As regards the quality , no bitter remarks about that.

Hi All,
I had ordered Veg Schezuan Fried rice,Veg Chowmein and chilli chicken from Copper Wok for home delivery. First, the order was delivered after 1.30hrs of the order placement.Secondly and the most important part, the food quality was pretty bad. Even roadside outlets prepare better food than what we got. Too much disappointed with the quality of the food served.

It was a most third class food which I have received today. Wasting of money, nothing else. 
Couldn't able to eat anything from there. Really don't know from where restaurants are recruiting these sort employees, who doesn't have any idea about the food which he or she is making.  Really horrible

I ordered the food from here online so cannot tell about the ambience and decor but the food was good. They do not have many options in the menu but the items they serve are good and reasonable priced.

Love the food here. Have ordered a couple of times. The delivery is very quick and the food is always fresh and delicious. My only concern is that they use plastic tubs to pack the food else love everything about this restaurant‚ù§Ô∏è

A pretty good restaurant for home delivery. The delivery was on time and the prices were low. Pocket friendly, that is the most brilliant aspect of this restaurant. Now, coming to food....it was not anything special. But it was not as bad as the reviews say. Looking forward to order from here again. Though the experience was good, I shall be waiting for a better one.

Ordered food from here through Zomato. Food was delivered on time as promised. Quality was ok and quantity was adequate. Prices were reasonable. Though Zomato gave 10% discount on bill however it was meaningless as the restaurant took delivery and packing charges. Packing charges were very high. Sheer waste of money. I ordered Non veg Fried rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Kungpao Fish, Egg Hakka Noodles, Hongkong Chicken. Chicken side dishes were heavily coated with arrowroot with small pieces of chicken in it. That was a disappointment.

Well the deliver all the way from their place to nagerbazar. That's quite the distance. The food was hot and properly packed. I had ordered a chicken drumsticks a chicken fried rice and szechuan chicken. The drumsticks were not very tasty. The size was good though. The fried rice could have done with little less oil and more flavors and chicken.  But the szechuan was a real disappointment. It was hardly spicy and the gravy was a little bland for taste. The quantity was quite good and the price is quite cheap. Hopefully things will be better with time.

A very hard to locate small Chinese Eatery in chinar park area. It is in the lane opp. to Momo I Am.
Went there for lunch with a friend. We had chilli garlic noodles , veg Manchurian and chilli chicken (friend had chicken).
The food was tasty and quantity was decent. They made the noodles extra spicy on request. Overall a good experience and wouldn't mind going again.

Inside the lane next to koshe kosha. One of the better places in rajarhat serving really good Chinese food at affordable prices. Try the schezwan chicken and egg fried rice. Looking forward to trying other dishes too.

I ordered food from here on Diwali. The manager said they will need some extra time as rush is there and I am glad that the delivery came before the expected time. Food is cheap and good in quantity though I think the taste could be more authentic in case of Chinese. I ordered Mixed fried rice which was over oily, dry chilli chicken which was good and one fish delicacy. The last one was also good in taste.

Reading all the positives from  the reviewers I planned to  order the Chinese combo platter for  my  daughters birthday party  of  around 50 people. Customized to my need the platter had egg chowmein, 2 drumsticks and 2 piece chillie chicken. The food was of  good quantity and taste. It was appreciated by all. The delivery was prompt and by the owner Mr Jyotiranjan himself. The personal touch was indeed appreciated. Keep up the good work.

Have only ordered from Copper wok. Delivery experience has always been excellent. Ordering is easy. Delivery is prompt and the delivery boys are very well mannered and polite. 

The food is fantastic! Possibly the best Chinese food offered via delivery.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION : Chinar Park region is well short of good Chinese Restaurants so finally there is some hope for the fellas out there because Copper Wok is here for there rescue. Situated at Chinar Park just near to Binani Building alley road to Koshe Kosha. Being opened for 2 months they have achieved some good reputation among the local residents and have been getting decent response as told by the owner Mr. Jyoti Prakash when i met him before and after the opening.

AMBIANCE : Its not a too big restaurant, couple of table up for grabs here but the decor is very soothing with decent lightings and wall paintings. Its an air conditioned restaurant to be mention.

FOOD : Before they have got listed in Zomato i had a good discussion with Mr. JP and i took a Chicken Fried rice for a tasting purpose. The rice was fresh and decent but lacked the amount of spices and flavour i looked for, though the quantity was decent for one.¬†
Later this month i visited again with

Delievery time was perfect! No qualms there...
The chili chicken(dry) was absolutely divine...

The noodles however, were lacking in a LOT!.... almost negligible chicken pieces.

But given the cheap prices and super fast delivery, will definitely be ordering from here more often!

It is rightly stated that-  ' A recipe has no soul, you as the cook must bring soul to recipe'
The chefs of ' Copper Wok' have literally brought out the soul of recipe

Delivery on time, excellent food. Reasonable price for food.
