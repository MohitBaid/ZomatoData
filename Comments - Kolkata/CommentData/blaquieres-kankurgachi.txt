Blaquiere's is one of the most delicious bakeries in this city. I had ordered a red velvet for my mum's birthday and they baked it in a day. The cake with a hint of coffee flavour in its icing simply melted in my mouth. It wasn't saccharine unlike most cakes and had the right amount of smoothness and sweetness. Also they are bang on with punctuality. Do try their cakes, I'm sure it will be an unforgettable experience. :)

It was my birthday surprise and I couldn't have asked for anything better than this. I would highly recommend this to everyone that I know. Being a huge cake fan, I absolutely loved the all edible delicious dessert that I ate. 
Can't thank you both enough, it made my day.

Buttercream with Choco chips in red velvet is something that I tasted for the first time and I absolutely loved every bite that I took. 
I would now want to learn a few things from you guys and not just take tips. 
The cake was not just pretty looking from outside but delicious in the inside as well. 
Raymond and Deepika, I wish I could bake as well as you guys do.

Just what i needed after a tiring week. A bakery that reassured me in my love for chocolate, aswell as opened my eyes, and taste buds to a whole range of desserts i had never tried before. Would recommend it to anyone wishing to treat themselves to something more than the usual cafe menu's and a keen eye for the better tastes in life, with a hint of that special touch - warm hospitality. :)

Ordered our birthday cakes from here, and what a wonderful cake it was! The buttercream is thick, chocolaty and sinful and the cake itself was rich. 
So different from the cakes available at the popular bakeries in Calcutta (let's face it, they all taste the same after a certain point). Everyone went back for a second slice of this cake, and I'm waiting for my next birthday just to order this cake again!

They have a fine self crafted line of cakes and delicious is just the word to start with. A confectionery worthy of recommendation. Be it birthday or anniversary, they cater to all festivities and celebrations..a taste worth coming back for..cheers

From birthdays of two year olds to anniversaries and weddings, be it any occasion, their cakes and chocolates always leave a big smile on your face. They have this whole lot of variety, my favourites being the orange and red velvet cakes and not to forget the cupcakes cutely decorated with fondant.  Also, their service is remarkable. #loveblaquieres :D
