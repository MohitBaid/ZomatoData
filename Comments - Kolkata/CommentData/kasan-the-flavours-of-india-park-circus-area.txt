Very good home cooked food. Excellent menu and dishes. A very very friendly owners and staff. Food is similar to Indian taste that you get at your home. So I would say a must visit.

If ambience is not ur priority then this place is perfect in every other way..their coriander soup was too good. Starters were good too. Go for paneer kofta if u don't want to go for the regular paneer buttermasala. Their paneer kofta is a must try. The staff is very friendly. They made us roses of tissue papers nd some really impressive cut outs done without using scissors or any other tool..just nails!! It's a place one can go with both family and friends. Overall a nice experience.

Specially I wanna say about sweet and sour chicken with cold cocktail.

It was just mind blowing. 

Starter and main course was also superb.

Ambience is quite good.

Service is very prompt. Manager was asking me about food quality after having each food. His concern and behavior impressed me most. Hope to go again. Very much Pleased.

Yesterday was my daughter's birthday at flavours of india and we had a great enjoyment alonh with my family's and above 50 nos. Of couple friends. There staffs were very friendly and courteous, they had done all the birthday decoration by Baloons, baloon gun shot, kids jumping bag and tattoo painting in banquet. Not only that we had an elaborate lunch buffet combination of Chinese and indian food. Starters were circulated in tandoori paneer, turkey aloo, chicken shaslik kabab and fish mahi tikka. Items were so delicious and testy. Most of my friends got stuff by starters. At end of the main course mutton rogan josh was just lipsmaking. Kids were fond with vanilla icecream with hot chocolate and gulab jamun also. So fun was unlimuted and we enjoyed a lot. We will arrange more gatherings very soon at here. I gave them rating 4.5 out of 5.

For a long time I have been wanting to try from this chain of restaurants. Finally I went there with my friend for a treat. As soon as we entered, the guy who was sitting on the front desk directed us to go upstairs which was the AC section. The ambiance was pretty basic. We ordered one Spl Mutton Biriyani and a Chicken Biriyani.The order came very soon. The Biriyani tasted good in the beginning but very soon the food became cold. Even the price for the Spl Biriyani was on the higher side.

Next for our main course- We ordered Dal Makhni, Paneer Tikka , Masala kulcha and Butter tandoori roti! The food is rich in flavour and light too, Good quality Chinese at pocket friendly prices.

Tandoor was out of the world; would rate it better than any resturent at the moment. Also tried verity of Kabab, which was wonderfully spiced, came along with awesome parathas. Quick and efficient service. Service persons took care of us really well and helped us in ordering what we wanted. Please give him a raise. Looking forward to many more visits.

The food here is ravishing with north Indian tandoori and Chinese cuisine. The ambience is comforting along with newly transformed decor that gives the restaurant a vibrant yet mellow look. The staff is interactive, helpful and engaging. The place isn't advertised for as well and is a reason for not being as popular as the food commands it to be.

Dont try their pasta or any conti dish for that matter. Havent tried their main course yet.Best service boy is Naeem and the manager Mr. DHAR is too jolly and friendly a person. Huge dining space. Has a separate section for private parties. Alcohol is cheap. Good place to be in if u have a known face and a regular customer. You are ought to get priority. You guys should try atleast once

When we went there, they were celebrating valentine's day. Red balloons, soft music and above all - the candle light dinner. The package dinner started with wine, followed by starters, then main course and then of course the dessert. The food was no doubt good, and what made me love this place was their rituals of giving roses to the ladies and paying extra attention to all the couples..

Everything about this restaurant is good. If it had separate ratings, I would have rated the food full 5. The only reason I rated 3 is when I went there, there was no staff to wait on me. I had to sit probably 20-25 minutes to get attended. The menu card came, and then another few minutes to take my orders. The person who attended me, probably had a chewing gum in his mouth, due to which I barely understood what he spoke when I required suggestions on what to order in spicy item. I was upset. Gave up expectation on the food. I was in a hurry as my lunch hours were over. But when the food was served, I tell you, rest was forgotten. It was wonderful and awesome. Only for the food, I would go back again there. Hope my next visit there gives me a better opinion for them.

The renovation on the first floor has been completed and the ground floor work is under progress. That kind of takes care of the ambience issue ( please do not expect a star rated restaurant decor, at least not yet )...the biggest USP of the first floor is a number of compact private dining areas which can easily Â house personal and corporate parties with about 25 odd members....the interactive , informative and courteous Management and support staff was in itself a great beginning..........The Indian starters (prawn, chicken, fish and mutton), the Chinese and Indian main course.....the cuisine more than delivered/ in fact exceeded Â on our expectations..that considering the age diversity of our family (grandparents to grand children) is a commendable feat and achievement (also the fact that we love our food)...adequate choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages....a real value for money proposition and an evening well spent....a thumbs up from the entire family............the restaurant stands tall in its commitment and passion and desire to improve and innovate on a continuous basis ...exactly the philosophy of its very tall leader

Well, it is a budget friendly bar & restaurant, where the ambience is really not impressive. This place need some real makeover with the decor. If you are looking for a place to drink then you can opt for this joint...coz the price is reasonable. Food is not up to the mark and are a bit overpriced. Service is average. Not a palce for family dine-out.

Decent ambiance, very friendly staff and food which tastes okay, however the main USP according to me is their drinks which are comparatively cheap and that they remain open till the midnight. Not recommended for family, though they have a separate section all together and its possibly because of the location where this restaurant is situated.

The food quality is not bad. sometimes because of crowd, the ambiance got destructed, otherwise the ambiance is really homely.  I should mention about some items they serve like - Fish Malai Fry, Whole Bekti, Mutton Pulao etc.
I have enjoyed lots of offers they brings to the customers, like 2+1 in drinks, special dishes on occasions.

Today I visited â€˜The Flavours of Indiaâ€™ with my friend for lunch. Ambiance of the place was very average and nothing to complain about. First we tried â€˜Mango Smoothie with Strawberry Punchâ€™ which was nicely done. Then we ordered â€˜Tomato Dhania Sorbaâ€™ soup as appetizers & â€˜Murg Afganiâ€™ as starters, both dishes taste just average. For main course we ordered â€˜Peshwari Murgâ€™, 'Plain Rice' and 'Butter Nan'. The Peshwari Murg was just horrible; it does really turn my mood off. The Butter Nan was bit above average only, although the Rice was very ordinary. Even the ice cream tastes very poor. Depending on quantity of food it may feel as overpriced and I will not recommend family dine-out.

CAN'T RECOMMEND A FAMILY DINNER BECAUSE OF THE AMBIANCE  BUT IF YOU ARE JUST HANGING OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS THEN OF COURSE YOU CAN GIVE IT A TRY, WON'T BURN A HOLE IN YOUR POCKET AT ALL.

This is a place for evening party for office goers in the Park Street, Theater Road, Beck Bagan Area. Drinks are affordable and in most cases are available with a discount or offer. Foods are not bad. Especially the chicken cheese kababs are a must try. 

Overall a good place for value for money in terms of low budget office parties. However, the ambiance is not that good to attract a family dine-out. The place is also good in terms of take away service in the surrounding office district

Great indian food and the pocket pinch is pretty neat. This place loses out on the ambiance. A family dinner is less preferred, but has a home delivery which means we don't lose out on the food. Must try - just ask them for a dish that has tandoori cooked chicken stuffed with cheese (Don't remember the name)
