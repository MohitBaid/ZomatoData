Food is amazing at a very affordable price. One can't just simply choose one item and leave another. Service is quite nice however they did not heat the patties even after asking them once. Other than that, there is no complain. The tastes are amazing and I'm definitely going back again.

Located few steps away from camac street more, is this pretty little cafe. 
Very neatly and decently decorated, spacious little bakery. 
You can get pastries and savouries at dirt cheap prices. How amazing is it. I had a cappuccino (which I felt was the priciest thing.. 77 bucks) , chicken Tikka wrap, mushroom pie, blueberry cheesecake, and dark chocolate truffle. 
It's reasonable. And the items are fresh and delicious.

I always used to hear about dariole as a renowned cake shop,so i decided to give a visit. Trust me the cakes and pasteries are so nice that you want to come again and again.
1) it has seating area which i liked the most.
2) try chocolate and blueberry muffin.
3) the price of muffins and cakes is quite reasonable.

Give it a try !

Dariole is a new place just beside Kookie Jar and Cakes. This is a part of the Speciality group. They offer the savouries at 50% off post 8:30 pm. The prices are dirt cheap but the taste needs to be better. The baklav was really a disappointment. Painting some other nut green in colour to give it a pista look just ruined it. The taste wasn't that great either. The chicken pattice was good in taste though. The cupcakes at 25+ gst was a steal though.

A gem in the heart of the city.I bought my dad's birthday cake(Double chocolate cake) and it was yummylicious. The potato mustard puff was  very tasty. Was quite surprised by the low pricing. Ambience was really good. However service can get better. Overall, a highly recommended food joint.

Been here a couple of times now and it's both cheap and really tasty and it's also a place which you probably never heard of mainly because of its location and competition with adjacent Kookie jar, ccd and Cakes. 
I've tasted almost all of their savouries and I'm mostly impressed. Few of the real good ones include Chicken Tikka wraps, chicken chettinad roll (I didn't quite expect this to be good, until I tasted it) and Chicken Seek kebab spirali.
Coming to the pastries almost everything in there is really soft and fresh. Few really outstanding ones being chocolate cup cakes, brownies (obviously) and their cheesecakes.
The smoothies too taste really natural. 

In short, I was impressed by this newly emerging bakery!

Trust Anjan Chatterjee to come up with something creative all the time! The master of flavours has now ventured into cakes, pastries and all things baked. Thus has been born the "Dariole", and in whose search I spent a fruitful afternoon, the November Calcutta sun puff-ing heat in doses milder than when it is at its "baking" best.
The road to Dariole twisted its way from Loudon street to Moira Street and as it finally snaked into Rawdon, I noticed the brownish chocolate coloured signboard that announced I had reached my destination.
Probably afternoon is the cleaning time and so the first thing visible to me , from a distance, was a mop and pail, resting against the glass facade of the shop. Gourmets, like me, are however made of sterner stuff and no amount of mops could deter me from striding in purposefully into the shop.
The review of Dariole, published in a local daily on the occasion of its opening, had advertised about its unique flavours of patties and puffs that, to a hardcore non vegetarian like me, had sounded like manna from heaven. Once inside, it took gluttonous mind and impatient eyes a fraction of a second to search out the stuff of a Bong glutton's soul - kosha mangsho. The kosha mangsho here had been skillfully concealed inside layers of puffed flour. That however had in no way, I realised post my 1st bite, altered its heavenly flavour and very soon I had gobbled up the whole of it and was ready to order another! 
Dariole is a non veg lovers delight! They have prawn patties and chicken Seekh kebab rolls on their menu. However, what made me to consider  bowing my head in reverence to the master of hotels, is the Potato mustard puff. The delectable taste of the stuffing that is again, quintessentially Bong is, in my opinion, the winning recipe of Dariole. Of course I haven't tried all their flavours and I would definitely love to go back to try the other savouries on their menu. 
I do have some opinion on the decor of the shop. The interior  decor of the shop could have been improved a little, in my opinion. The space inside seems to have not been very well utilized and the place could have done with a bit of colour and smarter looking sets of chairs and tables. Excessive use of the brown colour seems to have made the place appear a little drab.
While waiting for my items to be packed, I Googled to check the meaning of the word Dariole. It's supposed to be a French term for a mould used for baking cookies and other savouries.

Situated just beside the giants like Kookie jar and Cakes on Rawdon Street. But for me it will have to work a lot to cause any kind of competition to them as far as taste is concerned. 

Advantages : 

1. Economical in comparison to both Kookie Jar and Cakes 
2. Having a sitting option is a huge advantage and also when u serve tea and coffee at a cheaper rate ( when u consider the presence of a CCD just beside it) 
3. Nice decor and a Larger space than the giants mentioned in point 1. 

Disadvantages: 

1. The taste of the puffs the wraps and the pastries were good but when u already had several times from Cakes and Kookie Jar u will find this pretty ordinary. 

2. Service was too slow. Actually not the fault of those who were serving. Only 2 of them were deputed on a busy Sunday evening. And whenever more people came in ( a good amount came in for takeaways) they were struggling to attend. 

3. The snack options were pretty limited in fact there’s no sign of any sandwiches! On query they said “ you can try the wrap”.

A new kid on the block at the old cake shop destination of Kolkata, which has the first and greatly popular outlets of Kookie Jar and Cakes. Unlike the other two, Dariole is spacious with dine-in facility, which gives it a small edge.

I visited first in November '17 and tried Chicken Sheek Kebab Spirali (Rs 32) and Kasha Mangsho Puff (Rs 40) and ended with Blueberry Cheesecake (Rs 50). GST is added to the prices (which is reportedly coming down from 18% to 5% from 15th November, '17).

Spirali was decent with a juicy, small sheek kebab filling. The kebab went well with the bread in this fusion of tandoori cuisine and western baked savoury. I liked the Kasha Mangsho Puff too. There is little choice in mutton in baked savouries in general and this is a welcome addition. The only point is, the filling is not what can be called 'Kawsha Mangsho'. It's mildly spicy, well-cooked, tender mutton which indeed goes well with the puff form. I would like to know it as a good mutton puff.

All the savouries looked innovative and I found none common to anything available with the mighty competition close by. The forms are not different, it's all in the filling which is much Indian.

I love cheesecake, so I had to try the Blueberry Cheesecake. It ended my snacking on a pleasing note. The cheesecake had biscotti at the bottom and blueberry jam with crushed blueberry on top.

The pricing offers great value for money and seems invitational. It does not look like sustainable for long. Even if the prices go up to some extent in future, it should remain value for money and a cutting edge for Dariole.

I shall definitely come back to try the other goodies, including the salted caramel pastry.

Update:
I visited again in December '17. I tried the Chicken Tikka Wrap. The soft pita bread with a filling of small tikka pieces and veggies lightly cooked with seasoning was delicious! At Rs 42 plus VAT, it can be a better substitute to the vanaspati-laden chicken rolls available in the city. It will be one of the options on my next visits.

A great place to grab a bite of your favorite pastry finds its place at the best part of the city. Dariole is surely a place where you want to be. With its asthetic decor and wide range of pastries and patties available at a pocket friendly rate is totally worth it. But with bigshots like Cakes, CCD ad Cokkie Jar adjoining it faces a bit of competition. Addition of a couple of more tables to prevent the rush would've been good.

Bright and beautiful, Dariole is a new chit chat place for the youth. I had gone there with my friends and we all loved the place. The ambience was great and of course the food was sumptuous. The mutton kosha puff was awesome.....unique concept I must say. Kudos to the brain who had the ideas of these tasty puffs,cookies and desserts. 
I am a big fan of cookies and the cookies here are just yummmmm...:D
I also tried the blueberry cheesecake and once again it was also tasty and the sweet was not too much which made it tastier....
After my first encounter I again went and ordered a cake for my sister's birthday and the designs were very good....when I was handed over my order....I found that they have made it very nicely.....PERFECT to be specific.....
I would like to recommend Dariole to all my family and friends.....:)

Visited recently to order a cake for my son's birthday and tried the lemon teacake and doghnuts. While the Birthday cake turned out to be a visual treat, it was not really a treat to the tongue. The lemon cake was kind of soggy and the doghnuts a bit too salty. But the ambiance is good and the staff very helpful and nice. Price is reasonable as compared to cookyjar. But they have to do better than that to make customers give a miss to 'Cakes ' and  ' Cookyjar'.

As per the quality, taste and the pricing are concerned, I've nothing more to add to what has already been mentioned - the best bargain for quality stuff. However, I would like to share one delightful experience I had there recently : I was unhappy with something in one of my recent purchase and raised the issue through an email. Even though I did not get any response, I was pleasantly surprised when I casually talked about it in the my next visit and found out everyone was aware of it! They expressed their genuine concern for the same - apologised, and I received a complimentary food item and a voucher, coupled with utmost courtesy and care from the staff member there! One of the best customer-service experiences I've ever had..!!

For your sweet cravings like pastries and other bakery items without feeling the pinch in your pocket you can head to dariole. Right next to kookie jar n cakes this place is a cozy joint with good options. I tried their blueberry cheesecake which was ok. Could have been more soft. Sweetness was just about right though I personally prefer it to be a little less sweet. Quite easy on the pocket. Have to try out their white forest pastry. Would like to definitely step in a few more occasions. Overall an ok experience. Staff should be a bit more courteous.

Located near Shakespeare Sarani - Rawdon Street Crossing, this bakery is heaven for cake lovers. Almost all cakes are priced below INR 50/- per piece . Apart from wide variety of cake, they do offer some unusual dry cakes like orange cake and lemon cake, etc and cupcakes too. They also serve tea and coffee there and you can easily sit and enjoy there . Cold coffee ordered by us was excellent. Cakes are also very tasty.

How excited was I when I read about specialty restaurants entering the bakery segment but my hopes were dashed...I did try their savouries and pastries and all I can say is that savouries are a better bet than the pastries as its just not up to the mark considering that they are trying to target the clientele of cakes and kookie jar...please try to match the quality first even though they are priced much lesser than competition...There is a segment which does not mind paying as long as the quality is not compromised...it's surprising that team Dariole has not been able to figure that out

The best and the cheapest cafe in the heart of the city . It is situated near the FBB store in Shakespeare Sarani , very close to Kalamandir so would suggest to come from Mullickbazar side . This cafe is a must place to visit as it offers delicious and yummy doughnuts at just Rs 25 , can you believe it ? There are other cup cakes too ranged the same which tastes as good as the doughnuts . It's a paradise for those who have sweet tooth as the cakes are also cheap . The savouries taste good out of which we had masala bun and veg croissant . The friendly staff and the well lit up ambience is a feast to the eye with old English tunes playing in the background which gives it a feel of the bakeries of London . I am planning again to go next month as it is very pocket friendly as well as taste enhancing .

Spacious and bright, Dariole is the newest French cafe in town on Theatre road. The word 'Dariole' means a small flower-pot shaped mould which is used to bake desserts and savouries. As one would expect, the cafe serves varieties of french style pastries, savouries and coffee. The food on display looked delicious. They also serve croissant which is not easily available in the city. There aren't many options for vegetarians though! :( Very limited options. I tried a pineapple, apple strudel. It was extra sweet. Hoping strawberry cheesecake which I intend to try next time isn't that sweet. My friend tried a chocolate pastry and liked it. Prices here are very reasonable. Majority of the pastries and snacks are priced below 50.

Yet to see how far Dariole can impress as compared to the long-standing, iconic outlets of Kookie Jar and Cakes next door. Unlike these two places, seating facility is a big plus for Dariole. Worth a shot if veg isn't your priority.
