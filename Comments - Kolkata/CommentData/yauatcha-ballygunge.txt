It’s a spacious restaurant with modern wooden furnishing and is beautifully lit by the sunlight during the day. Service is efficient and quick. Their wide variety in the vegetarian menu is fabulous. The dimsums are so good and filling that you may not be able to move to ordering main course. The desserts are different and a must try. It’s an all time favourite. Whether it’s a quick lunch or a long wine and dine , Yauatcha is the place to be!

The food was just awesome  and unique  in taste.  We ordered  a  crispy aromatic duck    which was served  with steamed soft and small chapstick.  That was too good.  The spicy wild prawn curry was very good.  The prawns were so tender.  And finally  you definitely need to eat the chocolate  pebble desert.  That is just out of the  world.  The waiters were very good and guided us so well.

Really loved the food here although the quantity isn’t satisfactory. You get just 3 dimsums in a serving. Why 3!? Who’s gonna fight over the odd piece? That apart, the service is courteous and the food, especially the desserts are pleasing to the eye as well as tastebuds.

If you crave chinese (not Indian chinese, but actual chinese) or taiwanese style dimsums, this is the restaurant to visit. It is easily one of the best dining experiences in town. The cocktails are great, especially the specially crafted martinis.

The most unprofessional conduct at any restaurant by the management.
We were asked to pay ₹2000 per person, per hour as cover charge, that too in the middle of our dinner, as according to them we spent too much time on the table, that was 1 hour 45 minutes by then.

Yuatcha is a Chinese fine dining space on the 5th floor of Quest Mall.
A tad expensive, but most fine dining experience come pricey. Happened to hop into Quest Mall on the new year with my hubby in tow. Was greeted with a nearly empty restaurant. We ordered wrapped chicken with black pepper and there were only 4 tiny pieces of chicken. The saving grace was the vodka cocktail 'Lalu' served with ice, lotus stem,and a generous amount of the alcohol.
The decor was simple and suited to a fine dining ambience.

Fine dine here if you want to spend quality time, not bothering about the pocket pinch.

A fine restaurant with one of the best Chinese cuisines in town. Because of the holiday season going on, it is advisable to reserve a table beforehand. Well furnished interiors, very good ambience. Good for a romantic date too as there's a lit candle on each table. Slight pocket pinch but worth the ambience.

A contemporary tryst of fine and casual dining - all under one roof, that's Yauatcha, the Michelin starred dim sum tea house for you. Based out of London, it is an exemplary restro serving exotic Cantonese food and fine drinks from all over the world. Known for their art of dim sums and culinary mastery, they maintain an upscale yet modernist ambience. So, I when I finally visited the place for a birthday celebration, I found them to be pretty sophisticated which definitely matches with their top notch hospitality and food, in terms of quality & serving size. We tried few dishes from starters and mains. What I liked most about them is that the food is delicious yet healthy. I would love to be back here again.

To differ from popular opinion, we had a very disappointing experience. The staff wasn't interested in helping us with the menu or in bringing the food. The portions are small, and the prices really aren't justified. The taste of the food isn't very unique or exceptionally delectable either. Not a very memorable experience!

» Look and Feel-  Situated in the 5th floor of Quest mall ,this is the only Michelin star Restaurant in Kolkata. This fine dining restaurant serves great Chinese and Cantonese cuisines.The interiors of this restaurant is quiet romantic & cosy. It's not crowded and gives you a beautiful view of the town if you choose to sit near the window area. 
» Food-  (starters)Famous for its dim sums which is a must try here . 
(Main course)
* Hofan Noodles - spicy flat noodles with bell peppers and chicken . I bell peppers gave it a bitter taste .It was moreover bland in taste . I personally didn't like it .
* Malhak chicken- its a gravy based chicken preparation . It's spicy and goes well along with the noodles .
* Kung Pao Chicken- dry chicken preparation. The chicken is tossed with sauces along with coloured bell peppers ,red onions and has dry fruits to top it up. It's a bit sweet in taste and with the hot sauces you will get an explosion of flavours inside your mouth. 
(Dessert)-
*Raspberry Delice- The star of the show. Undoubtedly the best dessert I have tasted in my entire life. The presentation is out of the world and tastes absolutely ambrosial. You wouldn't feel like digging into this beautiful piece of art. It has 3components ... First is the raspberry sauce , second is the dollop of icecream and the third is the heart of this dessert.The third component has a red velvety outer texture ,inside which there is a layer of decadent chocolate mousse and the inner layer has the pulp of a berry.
This luscious dessert is a must try when you visit this place.
»Service & Pocket pinch - The staff here are extremely courteous and friendly. The bill for two was around Rs.2999/- which makes it quiet expensive. Though the ambiance and the service is worth it.

Located on the 5th floor of the luxury mall Quest, beside Bombay Brasserie, Yauatcha is a London-based Michelin starred restaurant and contemporary Chinese dim sum teahouse dishing out authentic Cantonese delicacies with a modern twist. Catering to an all-day luxury dining, and a preferred place for romantic dates, meeting up with friends, celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, group gatherings or simply spending time with oneself pouring over a book or expensive gadget accompanied with some hot tea, Yauatcha is known for their high-end nouvelle cuisine, specially their wide range of spectacular steamed, baked, grilled, and fried veg and non-veg dim sums.
The food menu is also complemented by a broad wine and champagne list, Chinese-ingredient inspired cocktails and different types of exotic tea.

The decor is minimalistic and classy; done up in black and white, with glass walls, sleek lamps, rows of tables and chairs flaunting a simplistic elegance that's not highly impressive or gaudy but soothing for one's taste, it's at par with the relaxing ambiance blended with a fusion of soft and edgy Eastern and Western music.

Upon entering we were graciously welcomed and seated by one of the lady attendants at a cosy table. Tables are tidily arranged (and not too cluttered) with glistening white plates, glasses, neatly-folded cloth napkins and chopsticks for those who'd like to try them for the first time or those who are adept at eating with them.
Following this we were introduced to our server who politely informed us that he'd be taking care of and looking after our needs, like enquiring about our choice of water, carefully taking note of our orders, deflty placing the table napkins on our laps, bringing the food etc. which he performed with expert care.
Another attendant brought the forks and spoons after asking what we'd like to use for eating, for one can either opt for cutlery or the chopsticks, whichever one is comfortable with.
We were also provided with soy sauce, pickled vegetables, chilli sauce and chilli oil in little trays as condiments prior to the arrival of the food.
Servers are well-trained and efficient. Service can be a bit swifter, specially presenting the desserts.

We tried their Vegetarian Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Char Sui Bun - one of their famed steamed dim sums, and the popular dessert Chocolate and Raspberry Delice, a firm favourite at Yauatcha London.
The soup was excellently made, extremely delicious with the perfect warmth and good portions of lovely vegetables. On a cold winter evening the warm soup is a delight to treat oneself.
The three medium-sized dumplings were very unconventional in taste, and honestly some Chinese food lovers may not like the taste, let alone anyone with an aversion to Oriental cuisine in general. Neither too sugary, nor too salty, they had a distinctly light sweet taste, with some tiny chunks of sweet-and-sour chicken wrapped in fresh, snow-white oh-so-soft buns. Recommended but only for those prone to an adjustable palate.
The dessert was a melange of smooth flavours, combined with the bitter taste of chocolate contained inside the lovely red rose-shaped mousse. The presentation and garnishing was picture-perfect.

Overall, those inclined towards experiencing Michelin star-quality food should visit Yauatcha, but one will either be hugely disappointed with their dishes, or simply relish the haute cuisine that they have to offer. Neverthetheless a visit at least once can be paid to this gourmet restaurant if one is fond of trying out newer tastes and cuisines.

Had long waited to visit this place and they didn't disappoint me. The interior is one of the most classiest I have ever seen ,on entering you'll feel like wearing a three piece suit to match the decor. The service was excellent, can't be any better . Now , the food - it's the best Chinese food I have ever tried . The crispy Cheung fun was perfect and the tofu and the noodles were superb . However , I would like more quantity for noodles. The desert was very delicious, but I had expected much more from them in deserts (the reason I gave .5 less). Would be happier if there r much better options in deserts , with more theatre in d deserts nd larger portions. In a nut shell, must try out this place for sure .

Well we went for some fine dinning Chinese experience and indeed it lived up to our expectation. We ordered prawns wrapped served with some mystical sauce and then we had few bockchoy wrapped dumplings with a clear soup for my bad throat. Then for main course we ordered Hakka noodles with fish (Indian bass) in back bean sauce.
The food was great over all other than the fish in black bean sauce which had the did almost pure raw and we couldn't eat. It might be the dish tastes like that but it will not suit an Indian taste bud not even a Bong one. For dessert we ordered a red velvet cake and a chocolate cake with ice cream.
The staff behaviour was great and ambience was greater.

The high menu prices would be the first thing probably you would notice as you browse through the menu card. The prices though shows itself justified in some of the aspects but unfortunately not all. Where it shows are the ingredients' quality, ambience, service, the very savvy and upmarket feel. The dumplings they serve would match or even surpass many of the the Chinese eateries in Europe. The desserts are very special too. The novelty factor is the way they are prepped and presented. However I wasn't impressed by the real deal, which is the main course. The stir fried tenderloin dish or mahlak chicken weren't not up to the mark for me. Specially the tenderloin. Really? Was it tenderloin? I have different opinion about it. Same goes to the honey galzed pork ribs. Although the egg fried rice and Ho Fan noodles with a nice smokey feel to it were quite good. Overall a bit of let down to the much anticipated build up.

Yauatcha – the Michelin starred restaurant at 5th floor of Quest mall, Kolkata. Luxury Fine Dining with a contemporary décor, fantastic balance of Light and Space, comfortable sitting and amazing choices in the menu. The place has all to be the best in the town, but does it really …. !!??

I had visited the place few days before with my friend Siddharth, a culinary expert and moreover a real foodie. We had booked the table in advance and accommodated easily. Welcome was good at the entrance, as we entered the dining area. Our table was next to the Glass window what easily lifted our mood to a certain high, we wanted to enjoy the evening with some sumptuous oriental delicacies. 

Ordered for an assorted veg dim sum basket to start with, and a pot of Oolong tea to accompany those cute dumplings.  Quick service, and we found those delicate dumplings full with flavors. But they were served not hot steaming. The best was none other than ‘Edamame & Truffle’ – what a flavor and taste balance, wonderful. I wish got them steamed hot – could have been enjoyed more. My Server said veg dim sums are not supposed to be served hot and steaming!! What an excuse and that also in a Luxury fine dining – never expected. 

Main course orders were Wok fried Veg Chicken and a portion of Stir fried beef tenderloin in black pepper sauce. We wanted to have them with a simple noodle, what we thought will be best accompany with our stir fries. Our server suggested us Singapore Noodles and we confirmed that without wasting much time.  And the food arrived in quick 10 minutes time, wonderful presentation and carefully plated. Yes that’s true fine dining touch in the crockeries and the presentation. A 10 out of 10.  Now the irony again – plate of cold noodles with warm (not at right temperature) stir fried what we been served. Beef dish ( Rs 695 ++) what was served had full of greasy Oyster sauce and crushed back pepper, and the worst part – they were not at all ‘tenderloin cuts’ what been explained in the menu. When asked the server about this, he looks very confused and never came back to the table till we finished our dishes. 

We had Pear and Almond Tart as dessert. Was ok but nothing special about it to mention. The tart was fine, but I found the Ice cream was much salted than it should be, what was overpowering the mildness of both the flavors. No Michelin touch in it.

Overall, was not a satisfied visit. Being a Michelin Starred, Luxury fine dining, what they project themselves as,” Yauatcha”– Kolkata couldn’t reach to that expectation. 

In the scale of 6 Points Awesomeness Scale, 

Ambience - 5 (The music was too loud and was not matching the ambie)

Food – 3 (Dim sums were perfect as per their taste rest all are not even worth of 3 points)

Service – 4 (Keeping Luxury Fine Dining in mind)

Shall I visit again – Yes, but only for the Dim Sum.

An expensive restaurant offering fine dining experience of Chinese cuisine. First of all the ambiance is 5 star like and the interiors are attractive. The service and hospitality of the staff are one of the best. Waiting time is less too. Coming to the food I must say that I was disappointed. Had heard a lot about this restaurant and based on the high ratings in Zomato I went with a lot of expectations. The dimsums are no doubt awesome but the rest of the items are average, which was surprising given the very high pricing. 
We ordered
Shredded lamb soup- this tasted like hot and sour soup and had apple cucumber etc along with the lambs in it. 
Chicken char sui bun- 3 large balls of soft and tasty dim sums with a sweet coating.
Egg fried rice - tasted a bit bland and the quantity was not enough for two person's meal
Braised chicken with mushroom claypot-a gravy chicken item that tasted similar to light version of chilli chicken. 
Veg Singapore noodles- this was a total disaster. Given it cost a pricy Rs 395 for a vegetarian dish, the noodles tasted insipid and below average. 

Overall the food experience was not up to the mark, specially I would highly recommend not to select the Veg Singapore noodles. Perhaps selecting another noodle item would be better. Except the dimsums, the variety of other items like side dishes, chowmins etc are pretty less in the menu. 

Given that Kolkatans absolutely adore Chinese food and there is no dearth of good Chinese restaurants in town, I would hope that Yauatcha improves in its food taste.

It's the third time that we are visiting this Michelin starter restaurant and each time our experience is evolved and enhanced.
There is nothing to add to the their ambiance font, as it is already known that their ambiance is amazing. I would say very classy yet chic.
Let's talk about the food. The dumplings here are their speciality. As they serve amazing dumplings here. Though we though had tried something different. We opted for Wrapped Chicken in Black Pepper. Let me tell you, it was too good. It had strong flavour of black pepper and was very well presented.
For the main course we had Chicken Fried Rice with Spicy Mahlak Chicken, which was thoroughly cooked in sesame oil and had mushrooms in it. Both the main courses were delicious!
If you are looking for good quality food with a subtle difference in the taste for Chinese/Asian then do visit.A strong reminder, it is expensive and the quantity may not sufficient, but it most certainly helps you experience the Michelin treatment.

Definitely my FAVOURITE Chinese restaurant in the city, perhaps even the country, with dim sums to DIE FOR. All their dim sums are absolutely delicious, even the vegetarian ones. Their sui mai's are a personal favoutie. I'd suggest you go only for dimsums and desserts but if you want mains, then do have their Pork ribs which is absolutely yum. No complaints on the quality of food as it is absolutely yum and gorgeous to look at. Their desserts are sinful - dark chocolate pebble, raspberry delice and tropical dome being the best. Service is impeccable as the staff is really courteous and takes care of your needs/requests. Even their cocktails are really well made. Definitely a go-to for some of the best chinese there is. Although it's expensive, it's TOTALLY worth it!

Visited this place for a dinner date with my girl, had called them up to reserve a table and they were generous in giving us a nice secluded place with a view of the city. The decor and ambience is pretty good.
Food: The waiter was very amiable and offered suggestions.We had ordered two varieties of dimsums, the one with coriander and prawns was pleasing to the palate. The sparkler from Sula vineyards added to the situation. The chicken rice and side were very Asian in flavour and not very pungent which was the best part.
Dessert: Had asked them to arrange for a raspberry cake with a special message. That was done perfectly. The cake was the best part of our meal.Though I don't quite have a sweet tooth, this one made me gluttonous.
Thumbs up to their staff for the cordial and helpful gesture. They are very professional and polite. 
The only aspect that can be improved is the quantity of food served considering its price is on the higher side. It does burn a hole in ur pocket if you go the full three courses so keep your wallet heavy

Even though a bit on the expensive side, this place scores at all the right places when it comes to fine dining. With its swanky interior, amicable staff, prompt service and piquant culinary delights, this place manages to convince you to visit more than once. We ordered nara iced tea, prawn dimsums and veg-fried rice. Dimsums were so soft that they almost disappear as soon as you put them in your mouth. Veg fried rice was quite good but it has scope for improvement. Nara iced tea was delightful, tangy in taste. Just one downside, quantity is quite less compared to the price. Overall, this restaurant is definitely worth an experience.

The place is good without doubt but the food is overpriced. Compared to the amount of food, the prices are quite high. Raspberry delight is a must have if you go to this place. The dumplings are also good although the serving is not adequate. The food tastes good so you won't really regret spending money.

Located in quest mall, this is undoubtedly one of the finest places kolkata has to offer.

Ambience: Well lit and contemporary decorated. Comfortable sitting. Glass walls. Perfect posh setting for family get together or that date with your special one.

Staff: Has through knowledge of what they are serving. Fairly prompt service.

Food: Delicacies at their best, is the way to put it. Super fine dishes with tremendous details. The dimsums are a delight but super expensive. The crispy duck rolls taste out of the world. The mains are also yummy offering much more value for money. The fish and meat are of highest quality and bursting with flavors. The dessert are a looker as well as they taste wonderful.

Overall: A must have experience. Bound to burn a huge hole in your wallet but will definitely satisfy each of your taste buds.

A food hatrick is what I can best define my experience Yauatcha. The depth and complexity of flavors in their dishes with the simplicity of choices is a winning combination. The veg hot and sour soup tantalizes the buds with sour and tangy without any afterburns. This was my third visit and after literally exhausting their menu- especially desserts, I had no complaints. Yes, ok they have three dimsums in one portion and I would have been happier with more. But after a bite or that sinful raspberry delice or their almond peach tart you forget​ all of that.

The best Asian Food I have ever tried. The restaurant is decorated beautifully with extremely well behaved and courteous staffs. Tried the dim sums, fried rice ,noodles and lamb. Dim sums are just awesome. Main course are very delicious. Here, we have taken the meat select menu, it contains one soup and salad, two dim sums, one stir fry with Chinese greens, one rice or noodles, and one desserts.(there will be a list from where you have to select) 
Now, coming to the desserts we tried jasmine honey cake and chef’s special and THIS WAS HEAVENLY. 
Looking forward to coming back soon.

I’m writing this post so that all of u are aware of certain practices that this restaurant in kolkata is doing.
A regular joint I visit is yautcha located in Quest mall. Today while paying the bill I noticed that they are charging a 10% for service charge along with GST. Now this is absolutely illegal. So I called the Manager called “Suresh” I think his name was n told him to remove the service charge coz that shall absolutely be on the discretion of the customer. He argued that it is legal n they have it printed on their menu cards. Later he removed it after I mentioned the details n about me being a lawyer. Till then he argued trying to confuse me on GST. Later he said- we have it printed...
Just cuz u have something printed on a menu card does not make it legal. So my dear members please take note of the same next time on so nobody can misuse the tax slabs.

The best Asian Food I have ever had. The dimsums were the best part. We had Chicken in Pokchoy, Hargau, Lamb and Shrimp dimsum. The coolers were pretty awesome. The ho-fan flat noodles, rice were simple mouth watering. Another eye catching part was the beautifully decorated desert. Loved it to the core. Restaurant people were very friendly and have niche attitude towards handing guests. Nice ambience too. Can't give any thing less than 5.

Yauatcha – a renowned brand famous for offering beautiful food in its true sense.

The restaurant is decorated beautifully with extremely well-behaved and courteous staffs who know what dish they are going to serve to their guests. The seats beside the window deliver a visual delight of the city of Kolkata. 

So, we had ordered for a Lamb Roll with Black Bean Sauce and a Chicken Wrapped in Pak Choi Dumpling for starters and it was just a delight. Loved the presentation and of course the food was delicious. Hot, soft and delicious food cooked properly definitely wins the heart of any foodie. However, the Chicken Wrapped in Pak Choi Dumpling scored marginally higher than the Lamb Roll with Black Bean Sauce Dumpling for me.

Coming to the mains, we had ordered for Kung Pao Chicken along with Hofan noodles – Delicious to heart’s content!

As for the desserts, we went for the Raspberry Delice AND THIS WAS HEAVENLY! Extremely beautifully presented and delicious. The dessert was soft and was like a cherry on top of all the dishes. The dessert stole the crown from all the other dishes. LOVED IT!

Yauatcha is definitely a place to drop by to enjoy and relish wonderful Chinese cuisine though it could be a bit pocket pinching. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to visit.

Looking forward to coming back soon.

Cheers! :)

If you love Dimsum, then this is a must visit place. Although the food price is a bit on the higher side, it is every bit worth it. We had the following - 

Fried and Steamed Dimsum Platter
Pork and Prawn Shui Mai
Crispy Golden Pumpkin Prawn
Pork Belly with Mantao Bun
Chocolate Pebble

Everything was absolutely excellent.

The best Chinese in town. Dimsums are undoubtedly the best you will find in the city. Crispy prawn cheung fung and almond prawn are my favourite. Braised chicken and kung pao prawn are quite amazing. You can’t miss the desserts. Chocolate hazelnut, red velvet cake, chocolate pebble. You just can’t miss them!!

My husband and I first visited this place in the month of July and have been regulars ever since. Located on the top floor of Quest mall, it is recommended to reserve a table before visiting. The place has a beautiful ambience, specially the view from the glass panes overlooking the busy streets of Kolkata. They pride themselves on being a Michelin star restaurant and they have all the reasons to do so. In our first visit, we were not very familiar with the options to choose from. The steward, based on our preferences suggested us the food items and boy they were yummylicious. We had our 2year old son with us and the staffs went a step ahead to get few food items customized for him-like no spice, a little more boiled than usual. The service is class apart. Special mention to Mr. Javed for the suggestions and customization.

Coming to the food, we ordered chicken dumplings, prawn dumplings and squids for starters. Dumplings literally melt in one's mouth. Squids were good too except the overdose of powdered biscuits spreading. For main course, we tried out egg fried rice (shared with our son), Kung pao chicken and a basil fish item. For drinks, we tried Lychee martini, kiwi and lime iced tea and watermelon juice for the toddler. Every item deserves a special mention and one's taste buds are indeed satiated. We decided to end the meal with chocolate hazelnut mousse and it matched up to our expectation.

The pricing is on the higher side, specially if the portions are considered. Each dish of dumpling has only 3 dumplings and thus one is left ordering for more items. Considering the local market requirements, I feel that they might do good in scaling up their portions. But the quality, taste, ambience, service more than make up for the pricing and portion.

My rating on various parameters would be (out of 5)
Food-5
Ambience - 5
Service - 5
Pricing - 4

Overall - 4.8

The first time I stepped in, I had no direction didn't order on a proper track. But, then slowly after 2-3 visits I changed the way how I ordered and soon I was in love with this place. Starting with the choice of Cocktails, the soups and as well the salads all are amazing. Now when we step into Appetizers Har Gau, Spicy Har Gau, Coriander Dumplings, Chicken and Prawn Shu Mai, Prawn Cheung Fun all are deductible. I'm a fan of the Har Gau and Prawn Cheung Fun. I've Tried Har Gau at 21 Places but this is the best. Then the Kung Pao Chicken & Pumpkin Fried Prawns are amazing but the other dishes can improve. Then Ho Fan Noodles and Fried Rice with XO sauce is amazing. This was the food, which is one of the best. Now, we come to the desserts. Simply the best. Yes, the Rasberry Delice may be the World's most Instagrammed dessert but I would still suggest to try the Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse, Chocolate Pebble, Jasmine Honey Tea Cake, Blueberry Pistachio bar and whatever you order their desserts are delicious. O a small note don't forget to ask them to pack a small box of Macarons for you as they have the best Macarons in India.

Visited during Puja this year.Had an awesome lunch, the decor is marvellous, the staffs were courteous. It is definitely a posh n luxurious fine dining experience. Now coming to food, we had ordered their signature prawn dumplings which was light, the flavours were not at all overpowering . For the mains we ate braised chicken with mushrooms in clay pot and pork fried rice to go with it. Their main showstopper is definitely the desserts. They do serve some heavenly desserts. We opted for chocolate pebble, which was awesome. Also not to forget the drink frozen martini which was also pretty good. The only drawback is that the food quantity is bit less so you need to keep that in mind while ordering.

The staffs were courteous. Ambiemce was also good . However didnt understand why suddenly they lit a candle in every table as they didnt dim the lights(incase they thought of giving a feel of candle light dinner) on request.

Yauatcha.
Yauatcha too has nice interiors, well trained staff and some amazing lip smacking chinese-japanese cuisine. We started with ginger ale, a mid spicy variant of chili chicken with gravy, and pork & shrimp rice.
Had luxe Gateau as dessert and it was hell awesome.

Situated in the 5th floor of Quest, with its classy decor and courteous staff, this is a highly recommended place for dining out with family.  The food quality is top-notch. The pork char siu bun, udon noodles and lychee martini deserve special mention.
And the best is reserved for the last - the Raspberry Delice is just out of the world - it looks so pretty and well-crafted that you would be tempted to click a pic before gorging on it.  
If you want to pamper your taste buds with Michelin-star quality food - then definitely go for Yauatcha!

They have great food and even better desserts - who wouldn't love this place?!

Yauatcha is perfect for a quite meal with family or friends. The food is of great quality, the staff is courteous and the decor is just sober enough for you to feel relaxed.

The food quantity is a bit less so you should order maybe 1 appetizer extra. If you don't, even that's good because then you can have more desserts. Make no mistake, their food is top quality Asian cuisine, but the show stopper is definitely the dessert menu. Try anything and guaranteed you will love it!

The food and ambience make it a great place, and add the mouth watering desserts, you have an unforgettable place!

At the onset, very good taste. However, there are other aspects of a top notch restaurant which are expected. Namely, service was not at all up to the mark, had to remind multiple times for water, for cutlery like knife. Also, the price to the portion ratio is really poor, and I can speak of this in comparison to yauatcha, Bangalore. This restaurant has good potential, but needs to really up the service quotient.

Had heard quite a lot about this place from friends and finally visited during durga puja. Service of the staff is remarkable. They make you at once feel at home ans are always smiling. 
We had ordered chicken and prawn dumpling which was very nice. Fried from inside and steamed outside. For mains we ordered flar noodles, chilly rice, spicy prawn and chicken peppercorn. Tastes were extremely good. Flavours are not overpowering and very light in texture. 
For drink we ordered classic martini and it was a superhit. Just loved it.
Course ended with raspberry delice and honey cake. 
Only compalint I could have is the quantity. Would love if quantity served is little more. 
Otherwise would love visiting the place specially for the ambiance and the staff.

A michelin star restaurant and true to its name. An amazing restaurant for first timers; just go ahead and order just about anything from the menu and you shall be pleasantly surprised. I have visited a few times and tried new items each time; They all have been exceptionally nice. Even with a completely packed restaurant with customers, the food comes fairly quickly depending on the number of items. A must visit for all food lovers in Kolkata.

From the moment you get in you are greeted with a smile made comfortable and then comes the person to help you with your food orders
They really guide you well depending on your likes and dislikes
We tried the chicken n prawn fired dimsum with sweet corn chicken soup it was really great the soup has a different texture compared to what we get elsewhere and taste is also far better from many well known joints
The dimsums were perfectly done and will good amount on shicken and prawn filling
For the main course we had shrimp and pork fried rice and braised chicken
The rice was totally different from standard fried rice what we get . It was very light the rice grains were different made to suite chopsticks as well
The braised chicken was well done with mushrooms and veggies with dark sauce just the amount needed for the tangy flavour
For the desert we tried the signature dish chocolate hazzlenut which was another great experience

I would recommend the desert as a must try for chocolate and desert lovers

Overall a fantastic experience but a little high on prices . Off course for a fine dining restaurant it's ok once a while all the foodies out there should try

The waiters were very friendly and welcoming and made sure that one is not allergic to any of the ingredients used. Adding to this the ambience made this place more interesting. I personally felt the main course was a bit okay okay. But I will recommend to taste the desserts that are offered here cause they probably are the best in the city.

Coming to the food. We ordered art of dimsum platter which serves 2 people and comes with 4 types of dimsums. Prawn, chicken, duck and veg. 2beers or tea is included in the platter as well. Their dimsums are to die for.
I also ordered udon noodles and added chicken to it. It was good as well.
Now the dessert we had chocolate hazlnut mousse which ended my lunch affair on a sweet note.

The crispy duck roll with the sauce they provide is perfect.

The chicken  side dishes were well cooked making  the taste buds happiest. 
And at last my favourite  raspberry delice.. Must go for it. 
Nice music playing around  along with the soothing  ambience makes Yauatcha a great place to go for in the city.

Given this place is for luxury dining, the price cannot be talked about if the quality of the food is considered. As we weren't sure what to order, we went for the pork ribs smoked in jasmine tea, pork belly cooked in yellow bean sauce, kung pao chicken and crsipy prawn cheng fung as suggested by the waiter. We couldn't be more happy with the food and the effort put into preparing the delicacies. The staff is helpful and really cooperative. Though we visited at an odd pre-lunch hour, one of them offered to show me how a pair of chopsticks is properly handled which I wasn't comfortable with. Really impressive place. Looking foward for another round because we missed the desserts this time.

Yauatcha is a personal favorite however the service needs to surely improve.
The ambience and food doesn't match the level of the service.
How can a restaurant at that stature delay a main course by 30mins after serving the starters and drink.The appetite is surely lost by then.
Hope you realise that people dining there won't assume or buy the lame excuses of technical issues or be bought over by cover up sweet savouries.

There is absolutely no reason to not give a 5 out of 5 to this place. From Food to Service to the Decor, everything is top class. 

Location - Its located in Quest Mall on the top floor. Reservation is recommended if you are going on a weekend as the place is packed.

Service - Excellent. The service staff was very courteous and they were on their toes to provide a great dining experience to you. 

Food - Everything we ordered was superb, especially the Desserts. I wouldn't mind going there only to enjoy their Desserts. This is what we ordered:

• Chicken Char Sui Cheung Fun - Minced chicken rolled in thin rice sheets. Full of flavour
• Stir Fry Lamb - Winning dish from Main Course. The lamb was so soft and well cooked. 
• Roasted Duck Fried Rice - 2nd best dish from main course.
• Rice Noodles with Shrimp - Okiesh, found the noodles to be too thin. Usually rice noodle is a little thicker than this

Desserts - Raspberry Delice, Jasmine Honey Cake and Chocolate Toasted Rice cake - Ahamazinggg

Can't wait to go back and eat again..

This was my second visit here. This time also not for a full dinner but a quick time pass. Like first time, today also it was a dreamy experience through my taste buds. I tried orchid pao chung cha with hurgao and finished up with stir fried tenderloin in black bean sauce. I don't want to fill the space up describing the beauty of the taste and flavor. I would just write - it did an absolute justification of being a Michelin star restaurant. It was an all round perfect and luxurious dining experience with utmost aristocracy. I know I am yet to try their best. Looking forward to respond soon to the irresistable temptation again.

Was on the bucket list for quite a while. Renowned for their variety of Cantonese delicacies and dimsums, you can give it a try to take a break from the regular Chinese menu of Kolkata. 

The restaurant offers a really serene ambience despite being located in a usually busy and crowded mall. 

We took a regular set menu which comprised of an optional beverage, hot & sour soup with shredded chicken, duck salad, any two dimsums, one stirfry and staple along with a dessert. Along with this we also ordered Stir-fry chicken with Szechuan peppercorn and Ho fan noodle. 

The dishes were prepared really well and there were no shortcomings in any item. You'll never find better tasting dimsums anywhere else in the city I'm sure. Stir-fry kam heong lamb and Roast pork and shrimp fried rice is a must have! 

The staff was really cordial and polite. Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience.

Excellent food! Good service! But, the reservation department messed up my wife's b'day!! Today, 13th August, 2017, when I reserved a table at the Quest Mall outlet, I "pre-ordered" a dessert for my wife, and requested for "happy b'day" to be written on the cake. After dinner, when the waiters asked me to order for a dessert, I knew there was something wrong. I discovered that the restaurant had no "pre-order" for me!!! The Manager said, maybe, the lady who took my reservation on phone (her name seems to be Madhu), forgot to add the request for the cake. This process is centralized in Mumbai, and there seemed to be a mistake. I had to order for the Hazelnut Mousse, but the Manager was sweet enough not to charge for it. 

Despite the sweetness, the damage had been done. The surprise I wanted to give to my wife, on her b'day, was lost.....And, so was my mood!!

Although I will not stop patronizing the restaurant (because of the incomparable food), I'm sure of one thing.....I will not trust them to arrange for something other than their normal food!!

Took my family out for dinner to Yauatcha.. it has been one of the finest restaurants I have ever been to.
Looking at the bill what all we ordered was-
Chicken wrapped in pak choi
Crispy prawn cheng fun
Toban chilli fried rice with added chicken & egg
Stir fry udon noodles with added chicken & egg
Braise chicken with mushroom claypot
Ginger ale
Thea martini
Ginger martini
A small Jameson
Food was delicious..authentic..& wonderfully presented!
Very well mannered staff!
A luxury dining is bound to be expensive, however you pay for the service & experience here & not for the food alone. And i totally loved the Yauatcha experience ❤
Happy eating 😊

Amazing food and great hospitality. The Rasberry Delice is something that you can kill for. The portions are good, they do fill the stomach of an average hungry man. A must place to visit if you haven't yet. It will burn a small hole in you pocket but you will be happy to have that hole.

This restaurant deserves a five star from every aspect. Sleek modern style interiors with fine ambience. Yauatcha was in my wishlist since a long time. The ambience of this place is quite soothing. Coming to food, we ordered Mandarin Dumpling and Vegetable Crystal dumpling for starters. Both of which were amazing. There dumpling are definitely a must try. The dips served along with them were equally good. For mocktails we ordered tokyo cooler and Orange and Chilli. Both of them are worth a try. Coming to main course, we had Toban chilli fried rice, Ho Fan Noodles, Stir Fried lotus root asperagus and water chestnut, Stir fry vegetable with fragrant chilli sauce. Noodles were a perfect blend of spices.
The desserts over here are a must try. There signature dish Raspberry Delice is just out of the world. Even Chocolate pebble does justice to its name. I dont have a sweet tooth and I still loved the desserts. The desserts are for sure a value for money.

Yauatcha is one of the best fine dining options, in the city. It's located in the 5th floor of Quest Mall, and the decor is really brilliant. Ordered a Ginger Martini, Lychee Martini, 2-3 varieties of dumplings and desserts. My favorite dish of the day was the Chocolate Pebble. It's one of the best desserts I have ever had. The service is good too. Happy Eating.

This place was in my wishlist since a long time and finally we visited here today.
As table booking was recommended,we did our reservations through Zomato which was convinient with quick confirmation.
We reached the place on time and the ambience left us awestruck.
I have been to other restaurants in quest and never understood that Yauatcha is so beautiful inside.
We sat by the window from where the view is just an icing to the cake.
Ambience is amazing.
We were guided by Mr. Javed who was extremely well behaved and explained us the dishes patiently since it was our first visit.
We took a set meal worth 1600/- and comprised of chicken noodle soup,Crispy duck salad,two momos of our choice,One staple,one stir fried,one drink and a dessert.
•Chicken noodle soup-A bowl of hot steaming soup spicedup in right proportions was delicious.

•Crispy duck salad-First time we had a duck salad and our experience was good here.

•Coriander chicken dimsum-This is so soft and tasty and the crust melts insude the mouth with an extremely good chicken stuffing.

•Bokchoi wrapped chicken-This is a highly recommended dish and is very tasty and unique.

The steamed momos here are one of its kind and very well cooked.We loved it.

•Pork shrimp roasted chicken-A low spicy preparation of rice with small cubes of pork and generous amount of shrimps.Goes well with any side.Recommended.

•Indian seabass in soya sauce-Three pieces of succulent bhetki baked and topped with soya sauce is pure bliss.
We were given chinese greens with it which is bokchoi in their in house sauce which was unique and nice.

We took a ginger ale drink with this meal which was refreshing.

•Raspberry Deliće-This is one of their signature desserts.A raspberry coated chocolate cake served with icecream and raspberry sauce tastes heavenly.

Apart from this we took one egg fried rice and Makral Chicken in mushroom.Also we took a plum mocktail.
•Chicken in mushroom-10-12 pieces of chicken cooked in a supertasty gravy and big sliced mushrooms went very well with fried rice.

•Egg fried rice-Quantity is sufficient for two and almost an non oily fried rice and tasty.

•Plum mocktail-The taste of the mocktail is very uniqie and refreshing.

Service is prompt.
Staffs are very courteous.
We had a great time here.
Our bill was around 3.2k.
For a good meal for two, 2.5k is safe. 😊

The wide range of dumplings kept on coming.. and we relished each bite. Not to mention the water melon whisky cocktails. The ambience is well suited and taste buds are tantalised.
The management need focus on quantity in each serve with respect to price. 
However, keep serving the fantastic oriental delights and get better at it. Check that the price maintains a sustainability.

On our 1st Anniversary we went to Yautcha for dinner.Yes,it is a luxurious dinning place.They have huge seat arrangement. Ambience was just perfect.
We have ordered one pot Assam Summer Tips tea. 
From cocktail part we took one lychee Martini,one cha la lai. Oh! Lychee martini was awesome.
Coming to dimsum/dumpling side we tasted so many dishes . Prawn Har gau(3 pieces),chicken coriander dumpling (3 pcs),chicken and prawn sanghai dumpling(it is pan fried dumpling ,contains 4 pcs ) ,chicken and prawn shui mai (4 pcs) and chicken wrapped in pak choi with szechuan sauce.(3pcs).Pan fried dumpling's taste was not good ! But all dumplings were made with very fresh ingredients. Quantity was very less base upon the price !!
Coming to main course we ate braised chicken and egg & chicken fried rice.Fried rice was too light.,absolutely pleasure to your stomach.Braised chicken was also good.quantity was perfect for two people.(if u take 1 plate each)
And finally we cut our Anniversary cake which was preorderd-Raspberry cake.The cake was really beautiful by decoration but taste was so so.

Went there with one of my school friends. Location in the top floor of Quest Mall and the view from this joint is just awesome.

At first, we ordered Kiwi nd lime iced tea which was good. Then in starter we ordered Chicken-Prawn Shumai and Lamb Roll with Black Bean Sauce. Both were awesome. 

In mains we ordered Roasted Chicken-Prawn fried rice, Spicy Seafood Noodles and Braised chicken with Mushroom Potclay. All the items are awesome especially the hung chunks of lobster in the noodles were mindblowing. 

Staffs are good and friendly. Decor is also very good.

Only cons is quantity is very very less compared to its price. 

Thnaks for the lovely dining memory.

The ambience is the most attractive thing about this restaurant, known for serving the best dumplings in town. They serve a small portion of salad(not regular ones) and few sauces. First I tried the spinach chicken dumpling, there were three pieces, though it tasted really good but the cost was way too high compared to the quantity served. I then tried their kung pao chicken and egg fried rice. Both were good and quantity was sufficient, the lime soda was good too. For the dessert I tried Rasberry delice and it was fantastic, very much recommended. Staffs are very very polite and well mannered. Pocket pinch is on the higher side. They also gave me good discount on the total bill.

They will guide the guests about whatever items ordered. But the food has very subtle taste people having a taste bud for indian chinese wont find this place apt. Their signature red velvet dessert is just breathtaking!!!!! Its heartbreaking to cut the cake ...just watch the marvellous creation..and when put in mouth thats heavenly..highly recommended

OK. So this place is fancy! And I sometimes really really dig fancy. Welcomed by smiles and led to the perfect table with a pretty view of the setting sun over the Kolkata Skyline(if you could call it so) was what impressed me much and immediately. Then came the funny part, which wouldn't have been that funny if we weren't on a date. OK.. so the person attending us walked down to our table to take orders gazillion minutes after we were seated. But after that again we were attended wonderfully well with good suggestions on what we should try. Now we weren't very hungry so we ordered Chicken-Coriander dimsums? Is that the name? Also Stir-Fried Lamb something. Extremely sorry. I could have figured it out if the menu was available on Zomato. Anyway the starters were good. We also ordered some Mocktails which were decent. We were about to wrap it up when the manager dropped by and suggested the Blueberry-Pistachio-Almond something with lemon something and man was it something! We're glad that we tried it and were fighting for the last bite. Blessed be the man! Overall it was a very nice experience. And I would like to step-in to Yauatcha someday for a tummy-filling experience. And I promise to note down the names this time. ;)

I was extremely excited to come to this place having heard so many good reviews. However, once I visited I was left with mixed feelings about this place. The décor and ambience is very classy and it gives you a feel good factor from the moment you walk in. The food is of a separate standard altogether, but considering the price, the quantity is not even worth talking about. The portion size is too less. I happened to go with my family (who, btw is vegetarian) and we ordered dumplings, salad, vegetarian chicken (which is exceptional by the way), two servings of rice and one gravy dish (the name of which I can’t remember). As good as the food was, the portions were too less, and yes, by the end of it, we were still hungry. To make an average experience bitter, their tax rates on the bill was way muddled up. We usually don’t fuss about these things, but for some reason the whole combination of the portion size, hunger pangs and the over pricing left a very bitter taste. If I were given an option, I would (solely based on this experience) not go back to this place.

I went there with my soulmate the day before yesterday...I can't explain in words that how much I am happy and satisfied after visiting that place... the ambiance was really too good... as our table was beside the glass window we could enjoy the cloudy weather as well as the heavy rain while taking our lunch.. it was an amezing experience and we cherish each and every moment of that marvellous weather of outside... now I should say about their staffs..they were very humble and very friendly... they were very cooperative and guided us in choosing the perfect dishes for our lunch date.. the most amezing thing was there food...I have no words to praise their food....each and every preparation were beyond perfect...we ordered lychee martini, chicken and coriander dumpling, shreeded lamb soup, hofan noodles, kam heyong lamb...each of these are equally mouthwatering...bt the showstopper was the rasberry delice... its presentation,taste every thing was jst waoow!! It was so smoothy and creamy and immediately its melted after taking in mouth... last of all I just want to say if I have any way to give them above 5 points I will definitely give them the highest... I am eagerly waiting for my next visit in that place...
     2. Atlast i got the 2nd chance to visit that place...went there with my family for christmas dinner. This time i ordered prawn cheung fun and the item was just waow! I think the taste of that is still at my tongue. Secondly we had chicken sweet corn soup and that was also excellent. In main course, ho fan noodle but this time based on chicken and the kung pao chicken. Their preparation of kung pao chicken was the best. I tried that item in various place but till date their preparation is the best. In dessert we  had raspberry delice and chocolate mousse and the both were great. Overall again a great time i had.

Recently went to Yauatcha at Quest Mall and had a seven course meal with my sister and the experience is amazing
We started off with momo as they are my favourite and had Chicken Momo Wrapped in Pakchoi sauce and Prawn Corieander Momo and a Pork Suimai. Honestly,am not a fan of pakchoi sauce but the momo was delicious.
For the main coursewe went for Chicken Hot n Sour Soup,Duck Salad,something that i have never tried before. Pork Bun,Lamb with Fo Haan Noodles, Chinese Green in Oyester Sauce and Pork n Prawn Fried Rice,Seabass in Black Bean Sauce.
Among these seabass and the momos were the best. 

Lastly,we had two amazing desserts called Raspberry Delight and Choco Hazelnut Mousse.Needless to say as i am a chocolate fan,i preferred the mousse more.

The service is steady and the decor is fabulous,perfect for a family dinner as well as for a date!

Heard this place was on the level of a Michelin Star rated restaurant. Well, it's a lovely place and the food is really nice. The view outside from the restaurant is also nice. But the place is in a shopping mall, surrounded by plenty of other food outlets and so many people that you won't experience  a quiet dinner. It would have been better to open this restaurant in ne and quiet place with no noise and the same beautiful view outside.

I had a mixed experience with eateries in Quest mall prior to my today's visit to Yauatcha. While Serafina's Sunday Big Apple Brunch was something memorable the incident at Irish House disgusted me to the core. The Chilli's experience was okayish on the other hand. Thankfully Yauatcha did not ruin my quest to Quest Mall this time!

Good authentic chineese food... Dimsum was the speciality and the taste was awesome. However, a bit over-priced. Also, quantity of food was low. In fact, in main course you will be served in a very small plates like starters, which is also a bit odd. Waiting time for the food was a bit longer. Tried steamed red snapper white emperor in Assam sauce, which was prepared nicely.

I was so surprised becsuse of her behaviour . I belive that one should never send their guests away like that. I have been to this place so many times never going back again. There r other out lets serving the same type of food. U people should teach ur staff how to speak to their guests.988

The only thing that attracts me about yauatcha is the dessert that they serve it is like the best thing that could happen to you.
The hazlenut mousse that they serve literally melts in your mouth, its served with vanilla icecream which makes it taste even better.
The food that they serve is average not better than the other authentic chinese restuarants in kolkata.
The dishes that i tried out here were the kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice, vegetable dim sums, the hazelnut mousse and the hazelnut mousse cake that they serve.
All together this restuarant serves average food but the desserts they serve are mouth watering.

Finally managed to visit it today for lunch, the ambience is top notch. There is glass window and the whole city is seen from here.  We ordered one mocktail-orange chilli, one cocktail-lalu, chicken prawn noodle and some chicken item with mushroom, i forgot the name. But all over the food is really great, but we had a plan to watch movie thats why we missed the dimsum and desert. Hopefully we will try it next time. Service is too good and very fast and staffs are very friendly and efficient. Enjoying a lotz.....:)

This is without doubt one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. The staff is extremely courteous. I was impressed the way they made sure that my lady got specific dishes knowing she was allergic to eggs and shrimps. The food was. Amazing. The dimsums were superb. This place served the best Kung Pao Chicken I have ever had. However, if smoked food is not your thing, don't go for the pad noodles. The desserts were. So beautiful that you would be compelled to Instagram them before you touch them. Try this place out, and go for their select menu.

I am surprised why I took so much time to visit this gem of a place.

It was my birthday, and hubby took me out for dinner. Leafing through the menu card, we chose to have the Regular Select (non vegetarian) menu, which was a "mistake" because : how can a regular person eat so much?? :P

Started off with the excellent Lychee Martini - one of the smoothest cocktails I have ever tasted. Hubby ordered Lalu - vodka, lemongrass, tea and lychee juice, whoever thinks of such combinations? 

This was followed by Hot and Sour Soup with shredded chicken, and an excellent Duck Salad (lettuce, capsicum, pomegranate and succulent roasted duck pieces). 

We had chosen four varieties of dim sums, and that would probably have been enough to fill our tummies!
There was:
1. Chicken and Coriander dumplings : a completely unique melt in the mouth experience, with the smell of mild coriander enticing you with every bite.
2. Chicken wrapped in Pok Choi: another delicious gem of a dimsum, most recommended.
3. Pork Char Sui Bun: The last time I had such an authentic pork bun experience was the Chinese breakfast in Teretti Bazaar, and this was just as good, if not better
4. Chicken and Prawn shui mai: I'm allergic to prawn, but the way hubby gobbled up all four pieces must say something about this dish too

This was followed by the main course.
I had chosen Ho Fan noodles with Chicken (wide rice noodles in dark soy sauce) and Stir Fry Kam Hoeng Lamb (extremely well fried lamb pieces, delicious).
My husband chose prawn and chicken fried rice and steamed India seabass in spicy black bean sauce. The second combination was better than the first, because the lightness of the rice went perfectly with the fish steamed in sauce.

There was also a plate of Chinese greens, which was so good that even avid non vegetarians like us finished the whole plate.

For dessert, my Raspberry Cake was decorated with a special birthday message from the hotel staff, which was very gratifying. It was a tremendous choice as well, a layer of raspberry icing, melting into chocolate mousse, further melting into light white cream, and filled inside with raspberry syrup and butterscotch bites, served alongside with vanilla ice cream, strawberry pieces and strawberry sauce. Heaven!

In comparison, the Choco Pebble chosen by my husband probably paled. It was great, no doubt, but nothing compared to the raspberry cake!

I had a delicious birthday thanks to them, and most importantly, the food was so light and of such quality, that in spite of a meal that would satiate the appetite of three horses just last night, I already feel like going back this weekend for a Tea and Dimsum party. :D

Highly recommended!!

I went with my friend to this restaurant for our business lunch. We ordered food and one of my friend ordered soda water. The food was decent and better than most of the restaurant but the service were lousy as to fine dining as this restaurant proclaimed itself. We waited for a long time for the water to be refilled. My friend waited for his soda which never came.
When I was given my bill I overlooked the price and paid my bill which is my mistake. When I went back home I saw they even charged me for beverages plus charges which never came.
This will teach me to look through the bill thoroughly.

Finally managed to visit it today for lunch, the ambience is top notch. There is glass window and the whole city is seen from here.  We ordered one mocktail-orange chilli, one cocktail-lalu, chicken prawn noodle and some chicken item with mushroom, i forgot the name. But all over the food is really great, but we had a plan to watch movie thats why we missed the dimsum and desert. Hopefully we will try it next time. Service is too good and very fast and staffs are very friendly and efficient. Enjoying a lotz.....:)

Situated in quest mall opposite serafina,this is a fine dining restaurant..living up to its fine dining credentials,the prices are exhorbitant and the portions slightly less,but the food is tasty and the staff are very courteous and efficient,checking up on you time and again whether everything is fine(although personally I prefer a bit more space)..overall a decent place with pretty good food,but prices are a bit hard to digest..

This is without doubt one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. The staff is extremely courteous. I was impressed the way they made sure that my lady got specific dishes knowing she was allergic to eggs and shrimps. The food was. Amazing. The dimsums were superb. This place served the best Kung Pao Chicken I have ever had. However, if smoked food is not your thing, don't go for the pad noodles. The desserts were. So beautiful that you would be compelled to Instagram them before you touch them. Try this place out, and go for their select menu.

I am surprised why I took so much time to visit this gem of a place.

It was my birthday, and hubby took me out for dinner. Leafing through the menu card, we chose to have the Regular Select (non vegetarian) menu, which was a "mistake" because : how can a regular person eat so much?? :P

Started off with the excellent Lychee Martini - one of the smoothest cocktails I have ever tasted. Hubby ordered Lalu - vodka, lemongrass, tea and lychee juice, whoever thinks of such combinations? 

This was followed by Hot and Sour Soup with shredded chicken, and an excellent Duck Salad (lettuce, capsicum, pomegranate and succulent roasted duck pieces). 

We had chosen four varieties of dim sums, and that would probably have been enough to fill our tummies!
There was:
1. Chicken and Coriander dumplings : a completely unique melt in the mouth experience, with the smell of mild coriander enticing you with every bite.
2. Chicken wrapped in Pok Choi: another delicious gem of a dimsum, most recommended.
3. Pork Char Sui Bun: The last time I had such an authentic pork bun experience was the Chinese breakfast in Teretti Bazaar, and this was just as good, if not better
4. Chicken and Prawn shui mai: I'm allergic to prawn, but the way hubby gobbled up all four pieces must say something about this dish too

This was followed by the main course.
I had chosen Ho Fan noodles with Chicken (wide rice noodles in dark soy sauce) and Stir Fry Kam Hoeng Lamb (extremely well fried lamb pieces, delicious).
My husband chose prawn and chicken fried rice and steamed India seabass in spicy black bean sauce. The second combination was better than the first, because the lightness of the rice went perfectly with the fish steamed in sauce.

There was also a plate of Chinese greens, which was so good that even avid non vegetarians like us finished the whole plate.

For dessert, my Raspberry Cake was decorated with a special birthday message from the hotel staff, which was very gratifying. It was a tremendous choice as well, a layer of raspberry icing, melting into chocolate mousse, further melting into light white cream, and filled inside with raspberry syrup and butterscotch bites, served alongside with vanilla ice cream, strawberry pieces and strawberry sauce. Heaven!

In comparison, the Choco Pebble chosen by my husband probably paled. It was great, no doubt, but nothing compared to the raspberry cake!

Located in quest mall opposite to serafina this asian restaurant is one of the finest in town. It is a dimsum teahouse offering cantonese dimsums, patisserie inspired by european culinary techniques and asian ingredients, and an extensive range of tea wine and cocktail. It has only 4 outlets in india and kolkata has been privileged to house one of the branches of this michelin star restaurant.
I took my mom to this place to have our sunday brunch. To my surprise all the tables wre booked and we had sit on the bar until we got a table.( so for you peeps out there make sure to make reservations before you hop in on a sunday😉).
The staff and waiters are very efficient in their work and their customer handling is very warm and considerate. These add to its brownie points
We opted for the 5course meal which consisted of:-
1. Drinks
2. Dim sums
3. Soup
4. Chinese green salad
5. Stir fry
6. Mains
7. Desserts
The drinks,dimsums,stir-fry,mains and dessrt were open to choice while the greens and the soup were decided by the house the entire meal inclusive of all taxes costs you around 1700 rupees.
Coming to our order:-
For drinks we ordered a tokyo cooler and a ginger ale.
The tokyo cooler is their speciality and gives u a fresh punch right from the time you take ur first sip. This glass of pure rejuvenation is the perfect way to leave behind the sweltering heat outside which got us exhausted. The ginger ale was good too.
For dimsums:-
1. Chicken and coriander dimsums- the dimsums are love here these purple colored balls of hapiness are the perfect examples of how u gt it correct. The outer coating is thin and soft the filling is tasty and generous.
2. Pan seared pork buns- these blew my mind off, for the first time i had tasted something like this as you take your first bite from these dumplings the extremely soft bread gives way to tenderly cooked small chunks of pork. Its really unique
For the soup we got hot and sour soup with shredded chicken and tofu- it was quiet thick and delicious, a variety of vegetables went into making this soup nd the tofu looked like noodles cut in long strands. It was tasty and good
For the salads we got roasted duck salad. The duck meat was tasty and the plating made it more palatable. It was a perfect accompaniment with the soup.
Next we order crispy fried lamb and steamed seabass topped with hot and sour sauce both tasted good the lamb was soft and the seabass was very tenderly steamed it sort of melted in my mouth.
For the mains we ordered:-
1. Ho fan noodles with chicken- Ho fan noodles is similar to the pad thai noodles but they are softer and broader. The noodles wre very spicy and the paprika used added mire flavour to it.
2. Roasted pork with shrimp rice- This one was more on the bland side the rice was aldent and small shrimos and pork chunks were cooked with care.

And in the end we ended our bruch with their special desserts.
1. Choclate cake with hazelnut mousse( chef's special on that day)
2. Pistachio cakes
Both tasted very yummy and left you craving for more
All in all it was a great experience of dining in a world class restaurant. The delicious food and desserts, the courteous and warm behaviour of the staff really made my sunday.
Thank you guys for the amazing hospitality and yeah!! Keep the ball rolling..

Yauatcha is buzzing with people and it's hard to get a table without reservation during weekends. This review is to comment on the excellent service in the restaurant. The staff was friendly, they knew their stuff and very helpful. Great vibes! Thank you so much for making this visit so lovely :) the food was yum, I'm going to recommend the Lychee Martini if you are opting for some cocktail. Ambience was pretty good too, clean space, modern furniture and set up, well lit. It was a good experience most definitely.

Despite being a regular at Yautcha since it opened in calcutta... was totally disappointed at the attitude of the manager mr. Sanjay! After making me wait for 55 mins for a table (after making a reservation), he chose to offer a table to people whom he knew. When I asked him to show me the concerned persons reservation, he didn't have anything to say. While I was waiting at the bar for 55 mins to apparently get a table, others in front of me were getting tables. Probably because they "knew" the manager. After screaming and shouting when we finally get a table we are told that most of the things on the menu are over! 
If we have such managers running such reputed Michelin star restaurants, in no time they would have to shut down the restaurant instead of just closing down the outdoor section. 

Terrible terrible terrible! Horrified at such incompetent people being at the helm of affairs!

Ok..to start with....a restaurant chain from London created by the same person from Wagamama.I have tried their wagamama in Birmingham and now Yauatcha in Kolkata..and to be very frank didn't find any thing extraordinary about it. Dont know about the hype ...but just charging exorbitant price doesn't create a fine dining experience..(a bottle of water 150/- plus tax)..☺cmon  we are in Kolkata and not in London ..probably this was forgotten while setting the price..neither food ( qty or quality wise) lived upto my expectation neither their service ( even after booking a table in advance..I had to wait for 15 min)... would definitely rate Mainland China much higher than this...

This place speaks of elegance. The time when it opened in Kolkata, I have been trying to visit this place. I finally got the opportunity one lonely afternoon. The staff is well trained. I opted for a four course menu on nearbuy. The food is excellent. I had a kiwi drink which was refreshing. Then baked chicken puff ..sumptuous. Accompanying that was ho fan noodles and kung pao chicken. Both dishes were wonderful. Then then was raspberry delice..yummy..beyond words. I am surely going back to this place to taste some of their world famous dimsums. Truly a great experience.

The first time Yauatcha opened it's gates to the people of Kolkata, sprawled out on the topmost floor of the Quest Mall, I could only gasp at the sheer beauty that it was! I had been counting days for visiting the place, especially after seeing pictures of the beautiful desserts they have on offer. I finally managed to, on a special 5-course Non-Veg Set Meal they were offering during the New Year period, 2016. I was so satisfied with the experience that I have gone back there 3 or 4 times more but I had been saving my review such that I can review as many dishes as I can. I think I have the needed experience now.

A Michelin Star restaurant, Yauatcha speaks of elegance from the moment you step inside the door. The vast area has been judiciously utilised - there is an indoor section and an outdoor seating arrangement as well. The decoration leaves you spellbound - simple and elegant. The waiters are very properly trained and they will help you get acquainted with the kind of cuisine they offer, and they are extremely helpful if you can't make much sense of what is written in the menu. In this regard, I am really thankful to Mr. Wasim who has helped me on multiple such occasions.

Now, coming to the food, one word : EXCELLENT.
Yauatcha calls itself a dim sum teahouse and since my senses are too weak to appreciate quality tea, I will stick to the dimsums and the desserts primarily, since I have tried to taste as many of them as possible.

Cocktails and Tea: I have only had Lalu among their specialities, which strange though it may sound, was quite good. My parents had tried their Earl Grey and First Flush and according to them, it was one of the finest they have ever tasted.

Dimsums:
They have the widest range of dimsums available, and each one of them are unique in their own way. The presentation and the taste both speak of the brand name they have carved for themselves. The names are quite difficult to remember, but I am gonna list some of the ones I have tried:
1. Steamed:  Prawn and Water Chestnut Roll, Chinese Chive Dumpling, Chicken and Prawn Sui Mai, Shanghai Siew Long Bun with Chicken, Har Gau, Poached Peking Dumpling.

2. Cheung Fung: Chicken Char Sui Cheung Fung

3. Baked/Grilled/Pan Fried: Crispy Duck Roll, Baked Chicken Puff, Sesame Prawn Toast, Chicken and Prawn Shanghai Dumpling

I recommend going for the Dimsum Platter to try the Baked/Grilled/Pan Fried Dimsums, as it contains 4 different (and the best) varieties. 

It's very difficult recommending any particular one, since each of them transports you to heaven, and if you're in love with dimsums, you might just skip the starters and fill your stomach with these. If you're willing to try out new stuffs, which you won't get elsewhere, try the second or the third category.

Soup: The Hot and Sour Soup with Shredded Chicken vouches to increase your appetite!

Main Course:
I had been so engrossed in devouring the appetizers that I had never appreciated their main course much. Among the ones I have tried, the Ho Fan Noodles, the Kung Pao Chicken, the Spicy wild prawn curry
with onion and water chestnut, are quite good. I am unable to recollect the lamb dish I have had, but that tasted fine.

Desserts:
Oh! The reason I keep going back to this place! It's an art, how they make such beautiful desserts. You will not have the heart to destroy and consume it. But once you manage to do that, it will leave your tastebuds with a sensation that you have not had before. I can't name any one of my liking, because I love them all. Starting from the Macaroons to the Raspberry Delice to the Jasmine Tea Cake, to the Blueberry Pistachio Bar - all are TOP NOTCH. I only one I have disliked till now is the Mango Mascarpone. The Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse and Lux Gateau are also very much in demand.

Overall, I am in love with this place. Although they charge much more tax than the usual, every penny is worth the food that goes inside you. It's difficult to find a place in Kolkata that invests so much thought and effort into its food, and I am just so glad that they opened up a branch here! If all these praises weren't enough to push you, then am just gonna repeat: TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!

It was a toss-up between Marriot and here. The long overdue visit here did not disappoint. The service was heroically standing up to hectic Saturday night crowds. Yes, a few eminently pardonable slips quickly and graciously corrected.

The cocktails and the food worth every penny of a hefty bill. The skills with went into crafting the vegetarian starters among the best in the city. Desserts pleased the eye and the palate. The general lessons learnt from visits to the Bengaluru outlet is if your appetite is small but refined plan a couple of leisurely visits so that you can explore the starters fully once, and the mains in another visit.

Perhaps it only a prejudice your reviewer has towards Bangalore whispers that Yauatcha on MG Road here tasted a shade better. Could be imagination

Being from Delhi when I came to Kolkata on my regular visit this month I was super happy to see that Yauatcha had opened in Quest Mall and promptly went there for dinner. I opted for the fixed veg menu which was my comfort in Delhi and sat back to be pampered Yauatcha style. Extremely sorry to say it was a HUGE disappointment. Ambiance was ok, service was fairly prompt but food???? It was a regular Chinese style cooking. Where was the sofistication and the subtle flavours of Yauatcha???? The noodles were more like street food.....They smelt of low quality burnt cooking oil, the veg duck salad was like a sweet dish, the lotus root veggies had an overdose of black pepper and nothing else. And the pampering was nonexistent. Like in the Delhi outlet we are served green tea without having to ask for it, so when I asked for it here I was told bluntly that it is not included in my menu. 
Frankly I for sure am never going back to kolkata Yauatcha. Total waste of money.

This restaurant was in my wishlist for a long time especially for the raspberry delice and the dimsums. Though i was a bit disappointed with the raspberry delice because it was a but too tangy i felt and that's the only reason for giving them a 4.5 rating. Otherwise every dish i had was too good. 
We did our reservation from dineout for the taste of yauatcha menu. And every penny i gave was worth it. I will highly recommend everyone to visit this place once if you are a dimsum and desert lover. And please have the Hargao in dimsum if you are non vegetarian and vegetable clive dumplings if you are vegetarian. And chocolate hazelnut mousse in desert.  
And the service was very good as well. All in all it was a perfect lunch for me.

Finally tried this Michelin star restaurant. They serve Chinese food which is somewhat close in authenticity. We ordered two tea based drinks , which were tasty and sweet and had the flavour of passion fruit. When you're in Yauatcha, you must try their dimsums. We had the chicken and coriander dimsum and it was very soft and bursting with flavour. We even had the chicken bun , which is a kind of sweet bun and is fried in a coat of egg wash. It had the filling of barbequed chicken and tasted good. For main course we had the egg fried rice and the chicken mahlak. The fried rice was good , they had used nice short and stout grains of rice. The chicken mahlak was also good, it was cooked in a thick gravy with the predominance of soy sauce and tossed with bell peppers and mushrooms. We even had the prawn cheung fun, which I found very unique. It was fried prawns wrapped in rice paper rolls and served with a light soy sauce. It tasted excellent. 
Lastly , we had the desserts, another thing which yauatcha is known for. We had the raspberry delice, which was a dark chocolate mousse with litchi brulee on a chocolate sponge and dusted wth red fine crumbs. It was served with litchi ice cream on a bed of biscuit crumb. It tasted heavenly. Everything was spot on and the mousse and the ice cream were very smooth. 
The ambience of yauatcha is comfortable and the staff , friendly. The dishes are priced on the higher side and only the dim sums and the desserts are actually worth going for.

We visited this place finally after planning for a long time.. the decor was cool and open plan and the staff were really courteous. Although i must say that they need to rethink the hostess' uniform. Coming to the food.. The kung pao chicken was awesome.. the authentic pungent taste came through.. the pork spicy dim sum my friend tried had a distinct korean flavour in the filling along with a thai twist to the curry that accompanied it. The almond prawn dimsum was a surprise to the taste buds as well. And obviously how could we conclude without tasting the heavenly speciality of this place.. the raspberry delice.. mind blowing dessert.. looks heavenly, tastes even better.. All in all a good experience..

Ambience is excellent. Service is also excellent. Food takes about 15 minutes to arrive but beverages arrive fast. Don't expect the food to be the usual spicy and tasty Hakka food. Its a Cantonese menu and the food us more on the bland but flavourful side. The food is great and portions are pretty decent and to be honest the duck was stringy and slightly tough. Not expected. Pricing given is correct.

The only reason I gave the rating of 3.0 to Yauatcha is for the Dessert- The Chocolate Pebble was pure Heaven! Dark Chocolate Mousse with a Fraiche. The plating and the taste was at par with what I've seen In the Masterchef series. Ones should visit just for this!

Meanwhile, speaking of the Dimsums and main course- the Dimsums were okay. 

When ordering for the main course, we realized that we would not want any MSG in our food and then came the shock- our server said that they used a small percentage of MSG in all their food items. This was completely unacceptable! It should have been mentioned in the menu that this was the case- we would not have sat down to lunch there! 

He then asked the Chef if it would be possible to prepare a vegetarian dish without any MSG and the already few options for the Vegetarians dwindled to just  2 DISHES! The Fried rice and vegetables (Lotus stem, peppers, onion, asparagus and water chestnuts). I felt I was being punished for asking for good food and was given a diet meal :/ 

Well, for the price, the meal just was not up to the mark. I had heard a lot about the place but this visit was certainly a let down. Knowing that they cannot make items without using MSG and since I would not have MSG on principle, the only reason I would visit this restaurant again is for the Chocolate Pebble. 

Also, for the benefit of other Vegetarians, who are okay with MSG in their food, they should increase the Veg spread in their menu.

Meanwhile, speaking of the Dimsums and main course- the Dimsums were okay. 

When ordering for the main course, we realized that we would not want any MSG in our food and then came the shock- our server said that they used a small percentage of MSG in all their food items. This was completely unacceptable! It should have been mentioned in the menu that this was the case- we would not have sat down to lunch there! 

He then asked the Chef if it would be possible to prepare a vegetarian dish without any MSG and the already few options for the Vegetarians dwindled to just  2 DISHES! The Fried rice and vegetables (Lotus stem, peppers, onion, asparagus and water chestnuts). I felt I was being punished for asking for good food and was given a diet meal :/ 

Well, for the price, the meal just was not up to the mark. I had heard a lot about the place but this visit was certainly a let down. Knowing that they cannot make items without using MSG and since I would not have MSG on principle, the only reason I would visit this restaurant again is for the Chocolate Pebble. 

Also, for the benefit of other Vegetarians, who are okay with MSG in their food, they should increase the Veg spread in their menu.

I had heard a lot of rave reviews about this place so decided to drop in here for lunch on my Birthday. Situated on the fifth floor of the Quest Mall this place surely has an ambiance to look forward to. The view from the tables beside the Glass windows is amazing and you get to see the hustle and bustle of Kolkata. Food quality is great and service is also efficient. Pricing however is exorbitant to say the least. Given the decor,ambiance and location high prices are expected but this place surpasses even those high expectations and it is as costly as the restaurants in the biggest of the Star Hotels in the city!!Overall if you happen to have an extremely high budget then this place can definitely be tried if you prefer it above the biggest of the Star hotels in the city.

Since we have recently moved to kolkata we have been mostly visiting tired and tested names for eating out on our special outings and yautchua was one of our fav ones back in mumbai. We were quite looking forward to our dinner here but sadly it was quite a disappointment.
Our server Amir was good and well aware of the menu and the ingredients but besides that there was nothing fine dining about the place... from the ambience to the decor to the lighting to the service and most importantly the food.Everything was very average!

If you believe in quality over quantity, Yauatcha is your destination. This fine dining is situated on the top most floor of Quest Mall, bang opposite to Serafina. I visited here with my folks on the 31st Dec for lunch and it was one of the best decisions made. We were seated on the outer section of the restaurant.
Our orders were placed back to back starting from the cocktails which comprised of Cha la lai, Lalu and a cosmo, followed by the starters/finger food if you call it which had Bak choi and Scallops and were outstanding. We ordered the best meals of Yauatcha for our main course i.e Pad thai chicken noodles, mongolian rice, fried chilli squid
with oatmeal and pandan leaf, stir-fry tenderloin in black pepper sauce, stir-fry chicken breast
with szechuan peppercorn in claypot. The squid and the beef were to die for. I'd suggest, do order the fried squid for starters and not mains.
You cannot leave Yauatcha without digging into there aesthetically pretty and equally bud pampering desserts.
Yauatcha was a wonderful experience altogether. It might create a big hole in your pocket but it's worth the money. And if you're looking for quantity this is not your place to be. Most of us can afford Yauatcha once a month.

This is a modern dumpling house and serves you an array of dumplings, main course, desserts and a wide variety of liquor to go with all this..everything about this place is brilliant ..the service is excellent, the food is exquisite and everything is really very fresh and of very good quality...for what they are providing, some may consider this place to be very expensive but this place will make u feel special and will be worth every penny...

Visited Yauatcha this evening and it was a gastronomic delight of the highest order... It being V-Day, there was a special set menu devoid of the delicacies which we politely declined... A-La Carte is the only way forward... 
Jumping straight to the food, we ordered 
Chicken and Prawn Shui Mai, Lamb Rolls in Black Pepper Sauce and Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun as starters... Chicken Fried Rice in XO Sauce and Spicy Mahlak Chicken for the mains... And Raspberry Delice to round it off on a sweet note... This was accompanied by Ginger Martini and some chilled beer... The starters were delectable and par excellence... The main course was just about good, and I would personally recommend more of dimsums than a defined main course... But the signature Raspberry Delice was absolutely brilliant... It will certainly make you forget all shortcomings, if any at all, in the earlier courses... 

Ambience and service were top notch  although, it being V-Day, it seemed they were hard pressed for time and things were slightly delayed... But nevertheless, on the food front, it was a thoroughly fulfilling experience... And in the end, that's what matters... Best of luck with the names and accurate pronunciation though... And just to add, it is an expensive affair... But it is a "fine" dining restaurant... And the food does justice to that tag...

We had a couple lunch on Valentines Day,3600 for 2 all-inclusive. There were 2 glasses of Sula wine,2 types of dumplings,2 half noodles/rice,2 half mains,and dessert. Only a prawn dumpling(orange in colour) and the dessert Raspberry Delice was worth the price we paid. The waiters and managers behaviour is cordial. Din't like the ambience so much. All the food items are tasty,but seemed a little less in quantity.

Have been there a couple of times. Though i  have pics of my second visit as i only went to have their desserts!The first visit we ordered couple of dumplings ,  noodles and i guess kung pao chicken.The dumplings were very good so were the noodles and the chicken. Service no doubt was hands on.Yes its damn expensive but i guess with time to come they will have to settle down with the price sensitive market of kolkata!The second one was a good experience too as we ordered a hazle nut mouse and lux gateau .Both had rich texture a looked super nice and tasted good too but lets say the presentation is better than the taste .Looking forward for trying out more dishes , month at a time though.....as it can really be a hard pinch at the pocket if i go more than once a month!

Good ambiance and gr8 service is the hallmark of this place.
We tried 3 kinds of dimsums ,started with chicken wrapped in pak choi followed by spicy hargu prawn and last was pork and prawn shumai. The spicy hargu takes home the cup!all of them are gr8 but it is in a class of its own.
We then went for the prawn and mango salad which was okay.
In the main course we had lotus leaf wrapped fried rice & spicy mahlak chicken (gr8 stuff).
Boy oh boy then was the dessert…we went for raspberry delice and it is the best dessert I have ever had in kolkata. Nxt time I am in quest I may just drop in for the dessert !
We washed everything with a marvelous jasmine green tea which is also highly recommended.

4 Course Lunch at 50% Price @ Yauatcha, Quest Mall, Kolkata ☺

Event: Great Indian Restaurant Festival (GIRF)

Duration: 1-10 Feb 2017

Organized By: Dineout, an online table reservation application

Offer Availed: 50% off on Set Menu (4 course lunch)

60 plus Kolkata based restaurants and around 1000 plus pan-Indian restaurants have participated in this mega Restaurant Festival!

Each participating restaurant is providing 50% discount offer in one or more of the following categories -

- 50% off on Food Bill
- 50% off on Alcohol
- 50% off on Set Menu
- 50% off on Buffet

Alongside, an additional cash back option of varying percentage, leading up to 100% cash back is also available!

Once I booked my lunch reservation from the dineout app, I received the necessary e-mails and SMS, containing the booking confirmation and the unique redemption code. Upon reaching the restaurant, I gave the aforesaid code to the lady in-charge of the reception. Promptly, I was provided the window seating with a nice view.

The pre set menu consisted of equal veg and non veg options in the following 4 courses - Dim Sum, Main Course, Rice & Noodles and Desserts. I was required to choose one option from each course.

Being a vegetarian food blogger, I opted for the following veg options -

- Truffle and english carrot dumpling: 3 delectable moist and steamed dim sums or dumplings arrived in a circular cane basket. The dim sums were placed on a circular leaf. They were slightly smeared with some edible green color on top. Each dumpling was garnished with a single thin sliver of red chilli. The whole presentation was subtle and appeasing to the eyes.

The filling comprised of truffle paste and minced carrot. I was asked to pop in one whole dim sum at a single go, so as to enjoy it's burst of flavors. I did so and really liked the soft chewy dumplings with a nice taste of carrot and truffle and an after taste of garlic!

- Braised tofu claypot with mushroom in chilli and black bean: Copper colored thick ceramic claypot with handles and a removable lid came filled with thick black bean based gravy, containing well cooked pieces of tofu, mushroom and water chestnut. This preparation was quite spicy. It tasted nice and well complimented the accompanying fried rice.

- Toban chilli fried rice: Served on a thick black ceramic curvaceous plate, it was the usual fried rice infused with finely chopped french beans, red bell pepper, edamame beans and sweet corn kernels. It was mildly spiced but flavorsome due to mild presence of some sauces and topped with finely chopped spring onion. It tasted nice.

- Pear and almond tart: The dessert came beautifully arranged on a white circular ceramic dish. It was clearly the hero of the meal.

A circular flaky pastry bowl, made of refined flour, butter and custard powder, was filled upto the rim with creamy bitter chocolate infused with mini pear chunks. It was then topped with mascarpone cheese infused pear compote of equal height and glazed finish. This circular mound was finally garnished with thin white chocolate pieces. One such rectangular chocolate piece had Yautcha printed on it in repeatation.

A small scoop of salted almond ice cream was placed alongside atop some crumble, with three peeled pear chunks strewn around it.

Some pear based golden colored sauce was also placed between the flaky pastry and the ice cream.

Thankfully, this dessert tasted quite different from the usual pure chocolate, nutella, blueberry, strawberry and orange preparations.

The pear chunks, both mini and mid sized, were juicy and crunchy. The ice cream had a nice salty taste which complimented the citric pear compote. The presence of almond paste gave a rich taste and texture to the otherwise vanilla ice cream.

The pear compote was freshening in taste. The mascarpone cheese inside was quite fresh and filling. The chocolate filling was too bitter for my taste. The richness of the ice cream came to full use in neutralizing it's bitter taste.

The presence of custard powder gave a nice yellow color and enhanced taste to the flaky pastry.

- Condiments served: At the onset of the meal, the following condiments were arranged on the table in custom designed white ceramic containers - chilli oil, chilli sauce, pickled vegetables (cucumber, carrot and raw papaya) and soy sauce. As usual, the pickled vegetable were sweet & sour and crunchy. Chilli oil was first of sorts for me and I really liked it's sharp and sweet taste. It went very well with the dumplings.

To sum it all, it was an amazing fine dining experience, enjoyed amidst classy ambiance, warm hospitality and good service. The serving staff was quite well informed about the composition of the dishes. Quantity served was sufficient for one person.

Fine Dining at its best. The place brings out the authentic flavors and tops it with their amazing presentation. The ambiance complements the food and takes the dining experience to a whole new level. The menu is compact but for all the good reasons. Whatever you order, be rest assured that your taste buds will rejoice in joy. The staff and crew behavior is also courteous and they take good care and pay enough attention to make you enjoy the entire experience. Good Job guys. Will surely return again. :)

Authentic 

If you love Cantonese and crave for authentic flavours, this is a must visit place. They have branches in Bangalore and Delhi too. We visited the Kolkata branch located in the top floor of Quest Mall. The ambience is chic and unpretentious. I love the setting and the upholstery. We ordered from their limited 4 course menu and the most outstanding dish was the chicken and coriander dimsums. The portions are tiny and make you crave for more. The main course had kung pao chicken which was delectable, a chicken noodles dish and the lamb. The lamb was slightly sweet, so didn't like the flavour too much. The star of the day was the dessert. We ordered the hazelnut mouse and the iconic luxe gateau. Both were excellent. They were a piece of art. The food tasted good, looked awesome and was served with efficiency.

Taste-4/5
Ambience-4/5
Service- 10-/5 (the waiters are courteous; the manager came to our table twice to make sure if the food was as per expectations)
Value for money- Well, it's a Michelin star experience and you need to shell out the extra bucks, but it is worth it!

One has heard a lot about Yauatcha's ambience and food but here I am going to write about it's cake which my friend ordered for her birthday. It was a raspberry delice cake. Red in colour looked amazingly pretty and sexy and my tastebuds were subjected to taste something they never had. It was not sweet but sour, actually a kind of mousse filled with cream and chocolate. A must must order for everyone. 😊

When you love a chain of restaurant a lot and find it in your city, it's almost having a dinner at someone close's house and especially when the AGM personally take care of your table! Love the experience and food at Yauatcha Kolkata tonight!
Ordered one of their speciality steamed chicken Chur Sui bun with a pot of warm Chinese Blue Tea a.k.a Oolong to warm up the evening. The dim sums are at their best in line with their history and lineage, steamed to a perfect softness with a moderately spiced well cooked tender poultry filling inside. The main course was some stir fried lamb in freshly made Kam Heong sauce and a simple fried rice with XO sauce. We requested to serve the XO sauce separately as side as the strong pungent smell of the dried seafood in the sauce is not everyone's choice. Servers were very courteous and friendly. Lighting and ambience are just the typical Yauatcha. Overall a satisfying meal to enjoy the evening in Kolkata.

This was my second visit to Yauatcha, which lives up to the Fine Dining standard. As you enter, you are greeted by staff members with warm smiles. The classy decor(which is similar in all the outlets) is welcoming too. 
The food is delicious. I along with my companions had mixed salad, hot and sour soup, a variety of dimsums, udon noodles among other things. All these were mouthwatering. The flavours were distinct and perfect. This was followed by desserts: raspberry delice and chocolate pebble. Both the desserts were beautifully plated and were heavenly. 
The waiters were very polite and after I told them about my allergy to mushrooms, they took special care to check everything before serving. 
My experience was very pleasant. I'll recommend it for sure. :)

Heard rave reviews about the jasmine honey cake so even though we had a heavy lunch we had to stop by here

The order was a chocolate pebble, ofcourse a jasmine honey cake and a chocolate hazelnut moose.

I enjoyed the chocolate hazelnut the most. The  choco was just the right amount of bitter but not too bad and the moose was just the right consistency; firm and held shape but not too dense nor to airy.

I'd say the same about the pebble and the jasmine honey cake in terms of consistency but I found the pebble too bitter (dark chocolatey) and the jasmine honey neither tasted of jasmine nor honey but pleasant none the less.

Presentation of all were ofcourse really fancy and service was very considerate and prompt. 

Price wise I'd say you get what you pay for (you even get a dot of gold on your cake)

The espresso and American coffee was also quite good

It's not anything decadent or something ud have when your looking to indulge in something; but if your looking to  treat yourself to an elegant tastefully experience...go here!

Went to Yauatcha with my parents expecting authentic Chinese grub and immaculate service. The latter was on point, but unfortunately, the food was nothing to write home about. I've had much better Oriental cuisine in comparable settings and at drastically cheaper prices. This wasn't worth the splurge.
For drinks we got the orange & chilli mocktail and the strawberry and vanilla smoothie. The orange drink had an exciting hint of spice, but I couldn't detect any vanilla in the berry drink. They were refreshing nevertheless.
We ordered the prawn cheung fun and chicken char siu bao for starters. The food began with a bang; the cheung fun was delectably silky, crispy and succulent all at once, and was subtly soaked in soy. Our server had warned that the bao would be on the sweeter side, and I anticipated it to be barbeque-like sweetness, but even the dpugh was too sweet to be palatable. To be fair, I'd been warned.
The vegetable udon noodles were familiarly pleasant and the chicken friedrice in xo sauce a thorough dissapointment. It lacked in flavor, pizazz and quantity. The claypot chicken with mushrooms had all the classic cantonese flavors, but I have had better. The mushrooms were like slurpy goop though.

I had dragged with me a bunch of nay sayers to this place and they were totally taken away by its charm. The entrance was just too beautiful to walk away from. The waiters too were cordial. They helped us with the menu. The lighting and music was brilliant. Just the amount you can take. We preferred the outside seating. We had a range of dim-sum(dumplings). They came in different colours-this totally stole my heart. The main course was mostly noodles and rice. We opted for chicken singapore noodles and some thick duck noodles.I did not enjoy the singapore noodles much and the duck noodles were too sweet. I was a little disappointed with the main course but not after the deserts had me grinning again. The deserts were set on the plate perfection. They were delicate and ornate with care. I was hesitating to dig into it with my spoon-they were just too beautiful and tasted heaven. I would definitely want to go back to this place for the starters and deserts, but I really expect a different experience with my menu.
I definitely owe my experience to the waiters and the chef they were standing by our table all the time ready to serve.

I wanted to go here for a long time and last year finally i went for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. Had such a amazing experience that i took my parents a  few weeks later again and then just could not stop myself from going back. The ambiance of this place is just mesmerizing and the food (though a bit pricey) will not disappoint at all!!! But since i am a Bengali and our appetites are enormous, the quantity of the food is not sufficient specially the quantity of the appetizers (also because they are so delicious you do not want to stop eating). You have to have the desserts which are just an art on your plate and in your mouth. Per head the cost will be around 1500/- plus or minus 300/-. Overall this place is one of my favorite places in Kolkata and if you have not experienced Yautcha yet i say you should go there as soon as possible whether it's for a nice dinner out with family or with that special someone or if you just want to treat yourself.

I was waiting for a long time to taste the well-known authentic Chinese food of this place and every bite of the food was worth the wait. Heard about their famous dim sums so we tasted those first and all of them were heavenly. However, the quantity is a bit less than what one expects at this price but the food is indescribable. We also ordered three desserts which are raspberry delice, chocolate pebble, honey cake and all of them were mouthwatering. All these desserts are also very nicely decorated and have delightful taste. The decoration, service are also worth mentioning. You can enjoy a beautiful view of the city from the 5th floor of Quest mall while enjoying the delicious meal. The service is also very fast and attentive.

The ambience and the service was great too. The waiter attending us was very cordial. Although it burnt a gigantic hole in my pocket, but then who gets such extraordinary dessert elsewhere?! I'll definitely visit this place again when I want to spoil myself with some delicious desserts! Recommend for everyone who have a sweet tooth.

We were very upset by the behavior of a particular Stewart named Ujjal. In spite of booking in advance he was giving seat preference to other guests. When we told him so his behavior was not all cordial which has left us with a very bad taste. I would not prefer visiting this restaurant again nor would I recommend it to anyone. In fact if asked, I would discourage people from visiting.

This will probably come as a surprise compared to the high ratings given by other reviewers. And this 3.5 is earned only by the quality of the food here, which is unarguably amazing. However, being a restaurant of a Michelen Star repute the service is absolutely disappointing. 
The guy who started serving us was determined to push sale all the things in the menu. Even if that is overlooked, once the food was served they just forgot to fill the glasses of water, change a martini that wasn't properly made, or for that matter have the basic courtesy to serve the food. We had to call on 4-5 times for each little thing and this is surprisingly when the restaurant wasn't even swamped. Hate to imagine what it would be on a real crowded day.
The food : Pork dimsums, spicy seafood noodles, sea bass in black bean sauce and chicken fried rice was cooked to perfection. The espresso martini was good too, the ginger martini was not correctly mixed.
It is a request to the management to learn to take better care of the customers at such peak pricing. Show a little more attention and at least visit the table to see if anything is required,

I went to this eatery with family yesterday and it wss the first time to this place. The restaurant was empty compared to other places which was a good point since on 31st you barely get any place to sit and dine! When we entered, we were informed that we will be charged an extra of 2500 (cover charges) per person since we were there after 9! So we decided to leave coz there wasn't any party that the place was having and not that we would have taken part in it. Just wen we were about to leave,they said if we sit outside there are no cover charges. Now coming to food. There is no doubt about that! it was worth the price and that is the only good thing! Service was mindblowingly trrrible!!You ask your customers that if they are there the first time and then the service is horrible! The guy who took our order seem to be attending all the tables but once the order was taken, never bothered to take any other request. We expect a little more hospitality specially when we are there for the first time. Otherwise no one will come back! I believe the team has skipped some of the management classes and do not know how to deal with their customers! You have your prices in the menu in place but the service that you provide is worse and very disappointing!!
The rating is only for the food!Arunita Samaddar

This ones dinning style is unique. 

Git a chance to talk with the manager. He explained me that all Yauatcha all over the world play a same music at the same time in their dinning zone .

They also are the winner of Michelin star award so only one restaurant of that high repute.

Food is classy as expected   

Dumplings aee redefined by these people.

The taste of Yautcha is far more authentic than any Chinese restaurant I've been to in Kolkata, including the Chinoserie and Tangra digs. Yautcha's main attraction are their dim sums. Although they're made using non-traditional ingredients, they still taste very similar to their original counterparts. And anyways one would argue that dim sum, like tapas, is really only limited by the chef's imagination. Anything goes (as long as it tastes good)! 

Second attraction are their delicious cocktails. These pretty but potent potions are especially attractive to the ladies, maybe cause it's easy to drink. But 2 drinks down and I'm buzzed. Plus the combo of cocktails and dim sums relished slowly on a Friday night is my idea of a good time. 

Third attraction are their set menus. Somehow they manage to come up with some pretty good sets that are value for money, and gives first-timers the opportunity to explore a bulk of the menu in one sitting. Yautcha is definitely my first choice when it comes to Chinese.

Yautcha is there in quest mall. It's an amazing place. Good ambience. Excellent food. They have really done an awesome job with dumplings. The desserts are flawless in looks and taste. A must visit. ❤❤❤❤
They provide a gluten-free meal. It's not much but of course it's tasty. It includes red snapper and Jasmine rice :D

An absolute world class food experience, backed with fabulous service - right from the courteous ushers to the very helpful stewards. 

Recently revisited for a special Anniversary lunch & it was the first visit for my Husband, 
We both love dimsums and often lament why our city doesn't offer quality dimsums as in China Town in London, Hongkong etc. Even Pan Asian can't quite do it. 

And delighted that we changed our mind with this lunch. We chose the only Dimsum Lunch and selected 6 types, and each one of them were excellent. The transparent almost translucent covering (the true hall mark of dimsums), the moist and substantial fillings, the chilli oil, the steamed bao - authentic, delicious, outstanding. 

We also took their very well priced 3 cocktails package and thoroughly enjoyed the ginger martinis though personally would prefer a little less sweetness. 

Dessert was an outstanding pomegranate mousse with caramelised yoghurt - unforgettable. 

Will soon go back to savour the set menu and the sticky rice in lotus leaf !! 

Keep it up guys. You are worth the value you create,

Awesome experience. We were planning to visit this place for a long time and finally did to celebrate my birthday. Service was excellent, ambience is nice above all food was beyond words. We ordered three different dim sums, all were good but the chicken coriander was the best. The hot and sour soup was also fantastic. The house made noodle and mahlak chicken were out of this world. We finished with the signature dessert, raspberry delice, no word is enough for it.

A fine dine restro with a five star rating in kolkata is awesome in food quality and hospitality. They are specialised in dimsum. Their soups are also very good. One can't leave the seat without having the dessert. No doubt about their service and food quality. Want to visit there again and again.

A truly blissful experience for your soul and for your taste buds. Visited the place with towering expectations and they have managed to meet most of that. The color of the chairs, the spacious arrangement of furniture, the fragrant ambiance, the tall hangings lamps, all were so minimal yet so cosmopolitan. The arrangement of the cutlery when the waiters came by to serve, showed that not only are they well trained but also well behaved.
We were served an array of dimsums, out of which I liked the pork stuffed one the most which was delicately sprinkled with an aromatic dressing. Also a must mention is the wierd yet extremely compatible marriage of the savory and sweet flavors in the cottony vanilla dimsum. The duck salad was full of various textures from crunchy lettuce to caramelized duck strips to the sweet emami refreshing dressing. The main course had flat noodles(good), a rice dish tossed in assorted veggies(good), a Malaysian red snapper curry(okay), and a stir fried lamb dish(okay again). However I was stumped at the desserts- the famous raspberry delice which had so many components( the chocolate mousse, the ice cream quenelle , the tangy coolie, the chocolate rings atop) and each one of them equally mesmerizing. Also we had another chocolate dessert which though was tasty but was over sweet.
Overall it deserves a thumbs up for the great effort and standard. Would love to revisit.

The only good thing about the restaurant was the set up and welcoming. I went to Quest with my friend, wanted to have a very light bite. We ordered vegetarian dumplings which was OK. The average portion size was small. I wanted to have squids but the chef denied to twik the dish a little for me. Yes he gave options but not what i was looking for. Being in hospitality for many years, I feel Yauatcha should also start being little flexible for customers rather than only sticking by standard menus or recipes or dishes. The standard is good but I found it rigid. The maincourse non veg options didnt attract me, may be the management should think of being more flexible for customer needs. We liked the dessert but were not satisfied with the overall experience. I hope this feedback helps!!!!

This place is a must go on special occasions. Food, especially the dim sums are just awesome. Apart from the usual Al la crate ordered dim sums , must try the dim sum platters both for steamed and fried if you are looking for a tasting experience. Main course was also very tasty and the quantity of food is acceptable. 0.5 deducted on the service. The attendants are not very attentive, lost in Disney land I guess. No cleaning tables between changing plates, no water refill (unless asked), no picking plates immediately when done eating (waited 15 mins before they were picked up). Anyway must go.

It's a fine dining restaurant. Their London shop is Michelin starred, mind you- not this one, as in India- Michelin / Top Hat kind of ratings are not in operation at the present set up , nevertheless the feel you might expect to get from a place of such fine repute is there. It feels nice to be there,  after marathon watching of Aussie Masterchef, this is a place you might want to go and imagine whatever gourmand fantasy you had have in your id is now being... satiated! 

To cut the chase short- the place looks great, food looks great, tastes all right, and the staffs were helpful, courteous, and friendly. Of course the pinch of high service tax is there, but you knew about them from the beginning. So, no complaining. 

Nota Bene: I went there on September 29, and mostly I wanted to try their moon cakes. I bought some back from their takeaway counter. Moon cakes were buttery and flaky on the crust, but assorted fillings they had fell short of oomph that was expected. I hoped them- the salted caramel, lemon, and jasmine filling to be more distinctive, but the shortening of the pastry was somehow overpowering.

So I visited this place as a part of a fine-dine dinner date and i must say with absolute confidence that this place touches every pinnacle of perfection. Upon arrival, we were given the most cordial welcome and offered seats by the window. The staff were very well trained and so damn polite. they responded very well every time and also helped us choose their best dishes from the a la carte menu. The ambience was pleasing enough, with moderately bright lights and cute cutlery, though they could improve a bit on their choice of music. The manager also keep checking on us from time to time to ensure we were having a good time or not.
Now, over to food:
We hit it off with two of their choicest cocktails - Lalu and Cha la Lai, and i must say the rumors i heard about them were absolutely true. A bit on the sweeter side, they are one of the best vodka-base cocktails I've ever had.
Lamb roll for starters were also good so was the soup.
Chicken Fried Rice in XO sauce was tasty enough, but the best of all was the Spicy Mahlak Chicken. It was sauted to perfection with a nice blend of spices and sauces and paprika.
We ended it with the Raspberry Delice and fellas that i one dessert to drool on. Its the Yauatcha specialty, and i must say your dinner/luncheon will be incomplete without it. 
Yes, it is a bit pricey, but hey thats what you get in a Michelin starred Restaurant.
Summing it up, we had the nicest couple of hours at Yauatcha. Cheers!

This place is located inside quest mall.... If you are searching for typical Chinese foods then this is the place to be, but if you like Chinese food in Indian style then avoiding this place will be better for you. Price is too high. Decor is nice. I would have said the ambience is nice if one house fly wouldn't have ruined our drinks.. We informed the staffs and they changed the drink. But this was really disappointing for us that how come a fly enters into a fine dining place like this. Won't visit here again.

Been there for Shashthi lunch. Was extremely disappointed to hear that Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun was not available. So had to change the entire plan and ordered Prawn and Pork Sui Mai and Lamb Rolls as per recommendation of the manager. The dimsums were flawless as expected and amazingly tasty, but compared to price quantity is too less. Next for the main course ordered Pork & Prawn fried rice which was bit sticky,very light along with one lamb item (the name I forgot) as recommended by the manager. The lamb side dish was again a good dish and quantity was much better compared to dimsums. But the star item was the dessert. We ordered Jasmine Tea Honey Cake and my goodness I will never forget the taste though it was too beautiful to eat. Such an amazing dessert I tasted after a long time. Of course their service is unquestionable. Overall it was a good experience. Would have been great if prawn cheung fun was available. Looking forward for next visit to try out their other dimsums. Hope I will not be disappointed that time.

Went for dinner at Yauatcha for 5 people on Asthami night without booking.  The hostess asked if we made any booking or not which we didn't and she offered us a table outside but we asked for a table inside the restaurant. The lady asked us to put down our name for reservation but informed us she can't  guarantee a time when we will actually get the table. Luck was with us as the Restaurant Manager overheard the conversation and straight away organised one table for us.

Service was slow to begin with as no one attended us for 1st 15 mins to offer us water.  Finally someone came to our table took our drinks order. The restaurant manager came to take the food order and recomended few dishes one of them was pork belly and new Zealand lamb chops. We specifically asked if the pork will have crispy skin with crackling but it turned out to be cooked chewey pork with soggy skin as sauce was poured from top. The new Zealand chops were exuberently expensive approx Rs 3000 for one portion and again very chewey and over well done. We live in New Zealand so was really expecting amazing but it turned out pretty bad. And then with no cutleries provided with every course after the previous ones were cleared off with the starters we literally have to share our knives and the repeatedly ask for forks. Even after asking the cutleries never arrived. The cherry on the cake was you charge extra for mixers when we ordered our spirits. Its really unusual to expect to drink neat when the mixer should come with the drink. The taste of the starters  were good but the main course was alright didn't meet up to our expectations. 

Service was bit of an after thought as if we were sitting in no one's land and none of the servers were keen to look after our table and thought it's the other section holder's responsibility. For some one else it might be different but unfortunately I have been working in hospitality industry myself in Food and Beverage department for more than a decade now so my way of looking into this aspect is completely different. 

My suggestion to you will be if you are serving food from a specific region try to cater the way it is best enjoyed and provide attentive service and it should not be felt as an after thought.

Visiting this restaurant was absolutely unplanned. While waiting for our friends in the mall we made a quick visit here and tried their some signature desserts. This place is mostly known for their amazing desserts. We had ordered raspberry delice and it was worth each buck. Ambiance is awesome. Try to grab a seat beside the window, the view is simply mesmerizing. Looking forward to try their other dishes soon.

A three course dinner at Yauatcha yesterday was a total soul satisfying experience. We started with one of the signature Spicey pork wonton which made it to my personal favourite of the meal along with the wrapped chicken with black pepper. Then we went for the Kung pao chicken, chicken and egg fried rice and Ho fan noodles. All of them had an authentic taste of its own and inspite of being a hardcore meat lover I loved the vegetarian Ho Fan noodles with soya cheese. For the beverage section the kiwi & lime drink and plum cut larrisa were a total thumbs up both in terms of presentation and quality. Where as I have had way better Strawberry crush with vanilla than this. The dessert part was the best of the course, their most popular raspberry delight was a charm. Apart from that we had Blueberry pistachio bar which was a delight but the lemon icecream it came with would be a no from my end. The pomegranate yoghurt gateu was something unique in terms of desserts I have had before with stuffed pomegranate seeds in it. The Chocolate pebble would be a bliss for people who have a thing for dark chocolate. The staff were warm and courteous enough and it was a luxury dining by all means. Though it was a Saptami evening but I have to mention the long wait for the main course. The price is undoubtedly on the higher side, though the food quality compensates totally for that but for some of the dishes you do get concious of the quantity. All in all Yautcha has got the food, the ambience and the decor to kill for. Definitely one of the finest dinings Kolkata has got as of now!

Yauatcha by its name itself gives out a hint of what to  xpect when u step in thr geared in ur fine-dine shining armour, especially when u r in Kolkata. They basically named this chain with a 2 word combination - YAU -d surname of its founder and CHA - which means (guess what, dear bong fellas) TEA! :)
N Yautcha is very much a classy dim sum tea house n in fact a place to b right from 6pm to late evening fine dinning. 
I found all the unique tea cocktails exciting n thrilling n tried CHA LA lai n it was nothing like I tasted before n was fun to drink.
The biggest turn off here is tht to sit indoors - cut off from all ambient noise n distractions, u need to RESERVE ur table compulsarily,  which I m not sure if it's mentioned here. So if u r plannin a peaceful-my-special-mood type dine out urself, plan early, walk ins wud hv u sit outside in bright light n avoidable noise along with d main walkway.

A really nice place for quiet dining . Love the momos here . No matter what the stuffing ! Pad Thai noodles are my favourite along with tofu prepared in the perfect sauce ! Mild with all the perfect flavours! Their hot and sour soup is also perfect ! Light and not too tangy. Raspberry delice is not to be missed for dessert ! It's one of the most amazingly prepared desserts which tops my list ! :) it's always a happy experience dining here with the warm staff ! :) And I like the part that they separate their vegetarian and non vegetarian menu cards making the choice prompt! :)

Asian food at its best 🍴
It's one of the best Asian food restaurant in Kolkata as per to me. 
Light food yet very filling, though whenever I visit yauatcha I prefer the dimsums over any other dish.
My order mostly consists of an Asian mocktail and varieties of dimsums and their vanilla macaroons!The ambience is excellent too! Very neat and classy. 
I'll give a 4.0/5 to the service, very customer friendly. 
Do give this place a shot and don't forget to try the char Sui bun.. It's a non-veg dish, Ingredients will be explained by the servers.
Overall it's one of my favourites ❤️

The one and only Michelin Star restaurant in kolkata and as by the name it definitely stands up to be one of the top fine dining restaurant in Kolkata with top notch quality and service. It will not disappoint you. But the thing that will disappoint is the amount of food they serve, it's quite small and compare that to the price is very expensive per se and it should be as it's a Michelin star fine dining authentic Chinese Restaurant.

Waited for a long time to visit the place. Basically saving the money for it. Being a Michelin Star restaurant the service should have good - which it was. Had pork char siu bun, chicken char siu bun and chicken wrapped in pakchoi in szechuan sauce. All the 3 dim-sums were great. Although they could increase the quantity.  Would be visiting the place again for some more dim-sums.

Located at the 5th floor of the Quest Mall,  this restaurant serves the best dim sum in the city. The varieties of dimsums are really amazing. I stop by at this place quiet often just to dig the experience for best dim sums. I still remember amazing platter of colorful dimsums which are unique in taste to mark the celebration of our colorful festival- Holi.

Whenever I need an escape from a bad day or just a day to pamper myself I go to Yauatcha! One of the best in Calcutta for Oriental deliciousness, if you are a vegetarian like me you don't have to think twice before indulging in its flavours. 

Here are my top picks 
1. Veg Crystal Dumpling - it melts in your mouth! 
2. Asparagus Cheng Fun - Always a delight. 
3. Veg Peking Dumpling - The tanginess of the sauce is just wow. 
4. Mapo Tofu 
5. Ho fan noodles 
6. Raspberry Delice 

Trust me, I've never eaten at Yauatcha and been disappointed and I'm a very picky eater. You can order anything and it will be delicious. The mix veg salad with lotus root is also a good choice. And the Hot and Sour soup is just to die for. 

Service is great. Ambience is great. There's nothing missing. If you take the set menu it's not too pricy either!

Food cant get better than this.. 

Was just going around the mall and happen to discover this place. Ambience is nice and comfortable with friendly staff. 
The food was simply awesome and could not help myself drooling over the dishes. Each and every thing was just perfect . Dim sums are too good and best of the taste. 
The sauces are just made to perfection and we had to repeat the chilli oil and chilli sauce as we had enjoyed adding it into everything.  
You cant miss having food here.. Simply superb. Good work guys!

If you are looking for a Michelin star Restaurant; well this is your destination then. Specially abled friendly. Plus vegetarians will love this place too. Exhibits a vast array of platter. My personal favourite is the Turnip cake and the Raspberry Delice. They have a private dining area too. And if somebody wants to take his/her beloved out on a date then this restaurant can never go wrong. The cocktail menu needs a special mention.

We went for dinner on 16th July with some out-of-town friends. The experience was amazing. Starting with the ambience, the food and the service, everything was perfect. Ordered a lot of dimsums including the Chicken Char Sui Bun, the Pork and Prawn Shui Mai, the Truffle Edamame dumpling and the Crispy Duck Roll. The presentation was awesome and the taste, perfect. For mains I had the Pork Belly with Man Tao Bun. Again, a super hit. For dessert, I selected the Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse. Pocket pinch wise its quite expensive but its totally worth it for the kind of food and presentation.

This was my first time and I loved it . Light music and  suitable lighting is great . The service is phenomenal . They make you feel at home .  Diverse food with high quality vegetables and other items used surely uplift the taste and  makes it  different from the other restaurants in Kolkata. 
 It is one of the restaurants that provide you with a separate vegetarian menu . With various facilities ( I just love free standard speed wifi) and great ambience , it will enhance your experience. 
Desserts.  THE PRESENTATION OF DESSERTS IS EXCEPTIONAL . Try raspberry delice and the one with chocolate . It's so great . I have never eaten a tastier desserts than what I had at Yauatcha . Though it is expensive ( come prepared ) it is worth it . The dimsims too stand out from the other.
Now I just look forward to eat here again .

Whenever I need an escape from a bad day or just a day to pamper myself I go to Yauatcha! One of the best in Calcutta for Oriental deliciousness, if you are a vegetarian like me you don't have to think twice before indulging in its flavours. 

Here are my top picks 
1. Veg Crystal Dumpling - it melts in your mouth! 
2. Asparagus Cheng Fun - Always a delight. 
3. Veg Peking Dumpling - The tanginess of the sauce is just wow. 
4. Mapo Tofu 
5. Ho fan noodles 
6. Raspberry Delice 

Trust me, I've never eaten at Yauatcha and been disappointed and I'm a very picky eater. You can order anything and it will be delicious. The mix veg salad with lotus root is also a good choice. And the Hot and Sour soup is just to die for. 

Service is great. Ambience is great. There's nothing missing. If you take the set menu it's not too pricy either!

This was my first visit to the place in Kolkata however I have been a couple of times before to their mumbai restaurant.

Nothing beats the service at this place. The servers are so well trained and polite that you feel luxury and pampered at the best.

The vegetarian selection was very good. One of the few places where you see a complete separate menu for vegetarian people. 

The dimsums are great however felt that the main course stir fry was a little bland for my taste. 

Overall a good experience but a little pricey not in terms of absolute pricing but the size of portion served. 

Would love to visit again to try desserts and their set menu.

This was on the wishlist since a long time
Finally visited the Michelin starred reataurant.
Visited for my sisters birthday treat !
Starting with the ambience.. black long hanging lights , intelligent yellow lighting and very interesting cutleries. Small authentic plates and black chopsticks welcomed us.
From the drinks menu we had :
1.  Lychee martini : with an amazing fruity smell , the pale white martini tasted really good.
2. The virgin lalu and normal lalu : yes i know the name sounds very funny to us Indians. This is a proper citrusy summer drink with lemongrass and a tangy taste.
3. The Cha La Lai : A grape dominated cocktail which stole the show. Visually looked brilliant with freshly chopped red grapes  and grape pulp with a splash of vodka. It was soo tasty ! #recommended

The dimsums (Their speciality) 
Dimsum : small bite sized food served in small steamer baskets or small plates and not just momos as many might mistake 
1. Lamb roll with black bean sauce : the lamb was soft in a little spicy black gravy. Tasted amazing. #recommended for lamb lovers
2. Chicken wrapped in Pak Choi : it was brilliantly presented dish in a steamer basket. Little balls of chicken wrapped in cabbage leaves tasted amazing. 
3. Crispy prawn cheng fung : This was my most favourite! I still couldnt get over the taste. Its tender cooked prawn wrapped in a fried flour shell and then again wrapled in a steamed shell. This is brilliant. A must try ! I repeat A MUST TRY ! #HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
4. Spinach prawn chestnut roll : This prawn dish was also brilliant ! 

Main course:

1. Chicken fried rice : It didnt appeal to me much. It was like a normal yellow rice with chicken chunks and chopped beans . Nothing extraordinary.
2. Spicy Mahlak chicken : Though considered to be one of their best dishes ( by Mr. Manager) i didnt like it at all. It was a very normal manchurian chicken with sesame seeds sort of a dish. 
3. Kam Heyong Lamb : This was tasty. The lamb cooked in a spicy gravy with lots of vegetables. Went well with the rice
4. Hawain noodle : Much like the Pad Thai , noodles was really different with sprouts and a bittery tasty. I got mixed reviews from everyone on the table about this.
5. Steamed Imdian sea bass : A "bhetki" fish dish , well cooked with a black sauce tasted good. 

We wrapped up with the much talled about raspberry delice which was a sweet-tangy-bittery dessert with perfect balance of everything. It tasted amazing like many said..

In a nutshell, the dimsums were too good or probably the best in town.. naturally , it elevated our expectation levels which declined as the main courses flowed in
Service was prompt , a little more knowedge about the dishes , the cutleries would be welcoming though !

Located on the fifth floor of Quest Mall, the interiors of the Michelin starred restaurant certainly has its sense of (understated, not loud) style. The music allows your conversations to flow as gently and easily as the water poured on the squeaky clean glasses. Do opt for a window seat here – you would definitely love the view from the top. 

The servers are efficient, courteous and well-informed. We ordered a five course meal each from the special non-vegetarian menu and helped ourselves to the surprisingly delicious crudités (consisting of cucumber and carrots). Looks like Yauatcha had us at hello!

Hors d'oeuvre     

1.	Salad with Mixed Greens, Radishes, Onions and Pomegranates – I can’t even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this salad. Imagine a salad was that good!

2.	Hot N Sour Chicken Soup - The soup was hot and definitely yummy in taste!

Dim sums

1.	Prawns – A must have at Yautcha, the spinach roll with prawns and water chestnut was nothing short of perfection. 

2.	Chicken – Dim sums are a speciality here, and what better way to highlight that fact than by doling out the most appetizing one of chicken wrapped in pak choi and served in Szechuan sauce. 

Mains

1.	Egg Rice – A simple and tasty egg rice after the heavenly course of dim sums was what we needed in our next course. 

2.	Kung Pao Chicken – I expected this recommended chicken item to be a little better, but the Szechuan dish was still quite well-prepared.
                                          ...

A 1 Michelin star menu , Chinese food doesn't get better than this ... Go for the set menu taste of Yauatcha 
It has it all , the hot and sour soup is a must 
In dumplings the different ones which are a must try are the ones with sauces , poached Peking  dumpling , lamb roll with black pepper sauce , chicken wrapped in pakchoi and Szechuan sauce , shanghai siew long bun where soup broth is filled within and bursts  when u eat it whole , and crispy veg chewing fun are some of the highlights of dimsums 
Mains are also really nice ,
The deserts are the highlight of the meal 
Raspberry delice , jasmine tea cake and chocolate hazelnut are must .

The first time we walked in to Yauatcha was a busy Nabami evening and the smiling waiter told us that this was a Cantonese restaurant and a traditional Cantonese meal had 3 courses- a starter, a main course and a dessert. Cantonese cuisine mixed up with Bengali tradition when we saw that the dumpling platter was decorated with the shape of the goddess Lakshmi's feet. Thus our favorable impression of Yauatcha began. The delicious dumplings were followed by equally scrumptious stir fried noodles and followed up with Raspberry Delice which was sinfully good. 
A second visit to Yauatcha, and I was introduced to a dish called pork belly with Man tao bun. It was so good that I still dream about it sometimes-I am not joking, I really do. The pork belly was absolutely tender and cooked in rich spices but it was not hot at all. The Man tao bun is the softest bread I have ever eaten. Besides these, their soups are also very nice. Their sea food dumpling soup is particularly good.
In the dessert section, I have already mentioned the Raspberry Delice. Their Jasmine tea cake is another delicious dish.
The awesome food comes with smiling, friendly waiters and a wonderful bird's eye view of the Park Circus 7-point crossing if you manage to get road side seats. The prices are extremely high though, but the food is worth it and hence can be managed once in a while.

A brand like yauatcha is something amazing itself. Not only the name, along with it quality and hospitality hatsoff. And here its cery easy to locate as it is in quest mall.
I m not so regular to this place, as i lyk trying new places but have been here and its worth to visit to have chinese there.

In love with their interiors dim lighted lamps nd very fine dining with chairs and sofas on side, area us even quite big with sitting available outside and inside both. Starrfs are friendly nd even helpful to select the order.

i loved their macarons💟, though their sticky rice in lotus leaf is very famous n special, the way they present it, is actually very nice somehow i ddn't liked that leafy smell, they have a variety of dumplings with variations. the steamed one which i ordered its filling was out of world and the one with two coatings as it was fried from inside and then steamed. It was a beautiful place with mouth watering delacies, and the way they present the food makes it more intresting like that bamboo basket and all, gives it a difference defination and tag, not that pocket friendly but worth. For sure i'll plan a next visit soon.😊

In maincourse we took kung pao chicken and braised chicken with mushrooms.one Ho Fan noodles and one Egg friedrice . lastly the super tasty raspberry cake,macrons and ice cream.

The ambience,service, and behaviour are top notch. However this place is to be avoided if authentic modern cantonese doesnt suit your palate. Since it doesnt suit me i found it a complete waste of money. Budget wise a meal for 2 would cost around 2.5-3k

This restaurant is only for those with big pockets and those who crave good dim-sum. Food here is excellent .Those who love sea food can enjoy the huge array of dim-sums and mains. Had my first scallops steamed dim-sum  topped with caviar .........and I am truly satisfied. We had gone there during the Dragon Boat festival, when they had the sticky rice as their specials. And finally when desserts rolled in.........*_* WOW.....go there and have it to believe it. Took photos of only the desserts we had as we were extremely hungry when we reached there. There was also a house special prawn dim-sum (soft and sticky on the outside but crunchy and juicy on the inside).
P.S-
One thing to keep in mind if you order one portion of any dim-sum,you get only three pieces (which was a big letdown for me)
and yes you do not get sushi here :(
But if you want fine dining and Japanese food you are at the right location. 
Cheers! :D

Yauatcha is a name I always associate very fond memories with. All my meals at this particular place has been brilliant. I have been callous enough to have misplaced quite a few pictures of the brilliant looking food from here, but their tastes remain etched in my mind. 

Their drinks are superb, all the cocktails I have had there were very well mixed. And the servers were exceptionally well trained, and were ready with very helpful suggestions all through. The food always looks vibrant and brilliant here, although like most fancy places, the portion sizes are small. But the taste and finesse in them surely make up for the smaller portions. I love their Crispy Duck Roll and the Fish in Black Bean Sauce. Their Sticky Rice Dumplings are worth a try too. 

And of course, their desserts are gorgeous. Not only do they look exquisite, they taste brilliant too. My personal favourite amongst their desserts has to be the Jasmine Tea Cake. 

They now offer vegetarian meat, and I plan to try them out very soon.

I am a big fan of this place since i first went there.. Quite fancy and yes very expensive but if you wanna pamper yourself once in a while or your loved ones you should go to this place. 
We ordered the rose wine which was not good but the food did make up for it.. They do have delicious mouth watering items on the menus but if you are there for the 1st time I suggest you ask your waiter what to order. Trust me they do know well. Now coming to the food, I really really really loved their food and equally their presentation. And most exciting thing I tell you is I am not at all a desert person but their desert made me eat more than half of it only cause I was sharing else I was pretty sure I would have ate that all by myself, as boy they have some super serious awesome deserts and again I had to say they do have an awesome presentation for every single food. So yes please give this place a try for a fancy fine dinning experience. The food is worth each penny you pay.

I have eaten at Yauatcha a few times now. It's amazing to see how the city has embraced Chinese flavors the way they should be served. Having tried modern Chinese restaurants across the country and some abroad, I must say Yauatcha does live up to the name and reputation.

Coming to the food I liked from their menu l,
Have simply loved their turnip cake on my older visits and the do make some stellar dumplings, the hargaos are translucent and are beautifully cooked. On one visit I tried their turnip dumpling, light n purple in colour, and tasted phenomenal.

Coming to the last visit where I sampled the dragon boat festival menu, which is on for a couple more days.

The sticky rice dumplings were out of the world. The rice wasn't slightly chalky and was moist and the meat was tender. All neatly packed in lotus leaves. The lamb with pine nuts and the vegetarian duck were stunning. As was the chicken with Sichuan peppers. The curried prawns tasted fresh and delicate, not over powering.

I'm not really a huge fan of desserts but if one is at Yauatcha, the macaroons and the honey comb ice cream will swoon you away.

Lovely experience every time.

Well I had been to Yauatcha few weeks back and I have absolutely loved the ambience. The hospitality is so awesome that it's surely worth the mention. 
So coming to the food. I love Pan Asian dishes and we started off with a delicious soup, followed by chicken dumplings and steamed chicken in spicy sauce. Coming to the main course we had their special mixed noodles. 
Last but not the least we had the yummy Raspberry Delice. And frankly speaking this is the most beautiful dessert one can ever have!  😍😍
But yes this is surely not one of those budget friendly places and is certainly meant for special occasions. Along with beer, our cheque was 3k approx for 2 people. :) But if you're looking for a lavish lunch, Yauatcha is one stop stand.

We went to Yautcha to celebrate my wife's birthday. I called and booked our table in advance. 
I also booked a cake but later they called and said cake was not available.

Ambiance -

When we reached we were greeted and directed to our table. Ambiance was classic and elegant. 5 on 5 

Service -

Service was top notch. Service staffs were well trained and had very good knowledge of the food they were serving. They gave few very good suggestions. They were very attentive. I must say service was one of the best in the city.
 
5 on 5 on service

Food -

We ordered -

 Prawn and Seaweed dumpling 
- Very tasty. Outer layer was as thin as a paper. 

 Prawn Cheng Fun
 - Star dish of the day. Very yummy. Outer skin was very thin and inner skin was crunchy. 

 Chicken and Coriander dumpling
 - Very tasty. Very thin outer layer.

 Udon noodles
 - Very good flat noodles.

 Chicken fried rice
 - Ordinary. Nothing special  

 Kung Pao Chicken
 - very tasty but chicken was a bit chewy 

 Wok fried lobster
 - very tasty. small pieces of lobster fried in sweet sauce. 

 Kiwi and Lime ice tea
 - Very tasty. Pieces of kiwi in lime and kiwi based tea 

Lime and passion ice tea
 - didn't like it.

Very good food but very small portion size.Three Dimsums per serving. I keep wondering  why 3? It can be 2 or 4 but why 3?

 5 on 5 for taste but 2.5 on 5 for portion size. 

Value for money -

For above food bill came as INR 7237 which is on higher side. 

3 on 5

Total rating will be 4 on 5

Yauatcha is a Michelin- starred restaurent located in quest mall. Last night i paid a visit with my friend. Well coming to the food... One of the best experience i had. We ordered chicken wrapped with bellpepper, veg fried rice and spicy wild prawn curry. Each tasted really good . The prawn curry had a touch a south indian taste . The wrapped chicken was juicy and it melts as u put inside your mouth. I liked the way they served and the presentation of food was really good. Coming to the ambience .. We fetched outdoor siiting. Well decorated and maintained. Overall i really had a nice experience.

I gave it a 5 just for their originality and authenticity and of course taste .... But quantity is really very moderate... Prices soar high in the sky ... But for some reason I recommend it for its sheer brilliance and elegance of plating and the desserts are over the roof fantastic

When the Middle Kingdom celebrates the two thousand year old Duanwu (Dragon Boat) Festival I can close my eyes and picture the gorgeous colorful Dragon Boat Races watched by the local folk who would be celebrating with lots of Zongzi (sticky rice dumplings) and  rice wine. I was excited when I received an invitation from Yauatcha to attend a preview of the special menu launched for the The Dragon Boat Festival as it is one of my favorite places to dine and I love their dimsums and desserts. Their celebrations include a limited edition menu created by Head Chef Wang Yixuan featuring a variety of zongzi, alongside a dessert and an exclusive cocktail.

Oh I love the dining and seating arrangements, classy , elegant. I love this place for my date ;) The set menu is great and being a veg is great place to die for. I love the food and drinks and biscuits. The seats near glass is amazing and private dining ofcourse for your closed ones . We loved the private dining area for sure.

For 2000 years, the Dragon Boat festival has been a time for the Chinese to get together and drink rice wine, eat sticky rice, race dragon boats on water and indulge in festivities with friends and family. Yauatcha is celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with a limited edition menu dedicated to zongzi, alongside a dessert and an exclusive cocktail.

We ordered pork and prawn shui mai, fried chili squid for starters.  For main course it was udon noodles which is basically thick what noodles mixed with bean sprouts soya chunks etc. Additionally steamed seabass in black bean sauce . Dessert a very yummy  jasmine tea cake. 

While yauatcha is known largely for its dim sums and the pork and prawn sui mai was as good as its  reputation, it's the fried chilli squid with oats and curry leaves that was the star. 
The squid was grief in a tempura batter. The oats too were crispy,  a hint sweet  which really brought the flavours together. 

I was apprhensive about udon noodles but it was surprisingly delicious along side the seabass in they black Bean sauce.  The black Bean sauce gravy is actually very thick in texture and  sticks to the fish, giving it a nice rich taste. 

The only thing that is disapointing is the service quality. Not that service personnels dont attend to you.  But when you are in a fine dine restaurant and have to work hard to get attention of these personnels it tells me that the service is very average.  The attentiveness of staff is also a differentiator in a fine dine versus a standard outlet.  This all adds up to the experience.  The 4 rating is stand alone for the food as i can't say much about their service.

Yauatcha is a Michelin-starred restaurant from London and is the fourth Indian city to be present in after Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. It was launched in Kolkata in 2014 in the upscale Quest Mall. Yauatcha has a bar as well as a private dining area. It is well known for its dumplings or dim sums and its desserts. It is a gem in the culinary quest of Kolkata and has been on every food lover’s must-visit list.

The interiors are beautifully done with a minimalistic but classy design and is one of the few restaurants in Kolkata which boast of alfresco dining that is outdoor seating along with a bar. What more could you possibly want! 
Yauatcha is modern, classy and fine dining at its finest. The service is courteous. The portion sizes could be bigger and the prices a little less steep but the quality and the experience of Yauatcha make up for the most of it. The quality of food and service is excellent here with well-trained staff who are extremely well-mannered and make sure you enjoy your meal.

No words to describe this place... I think this was my 1st visit to this place 

Always wanted to try this restaurant near future, due to its good food and drinks menu. Finally we went there with our full family. Food was awesome, ambiance is good, staff is Hospitable and kind, they always give you good suggestion as per your liking. Personally I was not a big fan of Chinese food, but Yauatcha worth it. Once you have given it a try, you keep going back due to the variety of Dim sum Cocktail and dessert, and also they have good collection of wine as well,

Yum Yum Yum dumplings. the best I've had in life so far. Great options and awesome taste. We order 6 different types of veg dumpling and all were spectacular. 
we obviously couldn't have the main course. The steamed dim sums are better than the fried ones. If you're a mushroom lover do try the one with the 3 types pf mushrooms.  what you cannot miss is the raspberry dessert. Its delicious. 

However the staff are very under trained and inefficient. They didn't give us enough cutlery even after asking 4 times. He took 30 mins to get water. Every order had to be repeated. Had it not been for the food, I would never go back looking at the service.

Heaven for dumpling and dessert lovers ❤

In my last visit, tried the chicken and Prawn shuimai, teriyaki pepper chicken , mixed noodles, squid and my all time favourite raspberry delice for dessert. The dumplings just melt in your mouth while the dessert embraces you in the sinful creamy taste. Very hospitable staff and I love the ambiance.

I just cant imagine the restaurant looked so good from outside but the ladies who were hosting outside named Tuhina and Amrika were so rude . 1 st of all they could'nt even communicate in english then i tried hindi then also they could'nt. And they told me that they can only make you sit if you have the exact number of people with you for example if you are three people they wont let you sit in four seater . And we were 4 people and a 3 year old kid, we were waiting for almost half an hour almost now and then a four seater was getting vacant but they could'nt let us in or provide a baby chair . They were so clumsy that we had to ask for spoons, plates and chopsticks . Though the food was delicious but trust me they dont deserve to open restraunt at quest . I ordered the same noodles twice and the quantity was just exactly half of the previous. The cost does'nt seem to be such an issue if you look at the menu card but the quantity is so less that i bet if you dont wanna return with half filled stomach u'll end up with a bill of 5,000 only for yourself. And if you want to go with your family please carry atleast 30,000 with you. Or if you want to go some where who is worth your money , go to Taj instead or if you dont wanna spend that much please visit Chillies which is just downstairs Yauatcha. A complete dissatisfaction.

I was so happy Yauatcha finally opened a branch in Kolkata! We went for high tea and the restaurant was considerably empty that time. The ambience was amazing nonetheless, and the decor splendid. We ordered a pot of Jasmine tea that went really well with the prawn and chicken dimsums and the rich assorted macaroons.

I have been to Yauatcha in London and Kolkata, and I must say, I love their food. The decor and the food in this branch, is good, however the portions are small in contrast to its pricing. Nevertheless, the ambience and service more than makes up for it and is complimented by the amazing quality of food. Great place for a classy Pan Asian fine dining experience.

Yauatcha is an Asian restaurant located on the 5th floor of Quest Mall. We went on a Saturday evening and got seated immediately. Ambience is good and the place is always buzzing with people specially on weekends. We started with some drinks which were ok. Then we ordered some veg chive dumplings and PAN fried Shanghai veg dumplings for starters which were just ok. It was followed by stir fry lotus root, asparagus and water chestnut veg, Ho fan noodles and veg fried rice. Stir fry was not great and quite bland but noodles and fried rice were spicy and perfectly cooked. Portions are quite small and service is standard. Overall a good restaurant for your Asian taste bud.

State of the art restaurant. From the interiors to the staff to the ambience and to the food, everything shouts out class! Having heard a lot about this Michelin Star Restaurant, we decided to go here on a Monday afternoon. The place oozed happy happy vibes. We went for 3 dishes, namely Crispy Duck Rolls, Garlic Fish and Singapore Noodles. All 3 were perfect in taste, quantity and no doubt quality. Although, I feel two pieces of Crispy Duck Rolls could easily have been made four. But, apart from that everything else was just super fine. This place is a must visit. Also, do not forget to have their Honey Cake with Ice Cream, (don't remember the actual name) because that will transport you to heavens!

When you know that a restaurant is “Michelin Starred”, you are bound to have high expectations. That too the only one in Kolkata. When you enter, you’d be delighted with the ambiance. And a place that looks so good, must serve good food right? After all, the term "Michelin Star" is a hallmark of fine dining quality and restaurants love to boast about their Michelin Star status.

Prepare to be disappointed with the food. Heard a lot of good reviews about their Dim sums, so ordered ‘Chicken wrapped in Pak Choi with Szechuan sauce’. They only served three small dim sums. When you are serving so little, you should try to amaze with the flavours and taste. I would give just 3 out of 10 for the dim sums, and I am being very generous.

For Main Course we ordered Braised Chicken with Mushrooms in Claypot and Spicy Vegetable Fried Rice. Well the fried rice was burnt and probably one of the worst that I have ever had. Chicken was just about ok, nothing great.

Pros:

* Ambiance – What you would expect of a luxury fine dining restaurant

Cons:

* Food – Absolutely disappointing

* Service – A tad bit better than self-serving restaurants

* Price – Will burn a hole in your pocket

The only Michelin star restaurant in the city speaks for itself. But just for the fellow foodies, it's that luxury dining place you read about in books, and see on tv. With clicks of fine crystal glasses, fine cutlery n table spread, trained servers, well suited managers, lovely lights, this place decor is slick! Pinch in pocket, but then if u r an eating out freak, this should be on your checklist.

The super hype of this place urged me to pay it a visit.. I had visited it on my anniversary.. And sadly it did not turn out fruitful..
The place is dark but elegant.. But the food menu is miserable.. I think their team needs to work on that bit.
Food is overpriced and quantity is low. Overall I can say this much that I had expected much more out of the place..

The place lacks vibrancy. I love peaceful and dark - but in places inside it was drab. So next time no sweet and I am sitting outside. Loved the chilli oil - thats my kind of taste. Service is attentive and courteous.Almost all reviews complain of small portions at exorbitant price. But didnt find anything out of place. Both price and quantity matches what is typically the case with top grade eateries. Just am not convinced I have tasted enough to understand whether it merits the Michelin star. 
Food is different. We had har gau - excellent,shui mai - good, chinese sticky buns - good new experience but sweet, crispy duck rolls - sweet. In main course we had tenderloin in black pepper sauce - sweet and wild spicy prawn curry - not spicy enough. Also veg spicy fried rice - good. For dessert we had the raspberry pastry and the hazelnut mousse. Wanted to have flower tea and the macaroons but were in a hurry. Ill visit again, to try other stuff but want to be careful about the following - sweet dominated dishes, I dont like sweet. Oh also had an orange and a guava drink. The orange drink was nice and tangy but the guava was too guavaish.

Yauatcha - To begin with , it's a mall outlet. Hence, expensive. Really Beautiful interior and nice ambience. But the food is not worth the price you pay and quantity is equally less. It's not even sufficient for a bird, forget humans. If you charge Rs.400-450 or more for a certain food item, at least make sure the quantity and quality is worth the price. Clever tricks to make business. No offense! Can learn from the standalone restaurants of Park Street. Most people visit to flaunt their social status, maybe. If you are a foodie and live in South Kolkata or near by Quest Mall, am sure you'll love the food in standalone restaurants at Park Street, better than this one, at least. Oh btw! The staff guys here letch badly, while you eat and I had to swap seat with my friend. Being a foodie, I SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPLORED YAUATCHA. Waste of my hard earned money!

Yautcha, a place I believe is a bit too overrated. But that is just a personal opinion. Sparkly clean glasses, and transparent windows would catch your eyes and attention when you walk past this restaurant.

Food quantity: 4/5
Food quality: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5
Hygiene and cleanliness: 5/5

Location:  fifth floor of Quest Mall, located at Syed Amir Ali Road, Ballygunge. This restaurant is on the left with black and transparent contrasting windows and glasses.

Food: It was almost disappointing to take most bites of this place. Food here, I believe is over rated. Yautcha met my expectation with its decor and management, but food was the only factor that it lagged in. 

I am not going a detailed review of the food in this place- (a.) Because I did not like it much (b.) Because I visited this place about six months ago. I do not remember thoroughly what each dish tasted like.

What we ordered and their ratings:
* Stir-fry Chicken Fry- 2.5/5
*Chicken Fried Rice-3/5
*Raspberry Delice- 4/5
*Mango Mascarpone Gateau- 3.5/5
*Grilled Fruits and Vanilla Rum Ice Cream- 3.5/5

Management: ambience was not vibrant and lively enough for a restaurant. Faint music in the background allowed people to converse. Staff was very friendly. Everything is pretty much taken care of, the decor, the plating, the hygiene and cleanliness; just not the food.

Yauatcha is a class in itself. The concept, ambience, service and food makes it one of its kind. A Michelin starred restaurant with vast choice of dimsum and stir-fry, aahhh!!! The same authenticity in taste yet with modern touch indeed well presented.We had prawn cheung fun, chicken and prawn Shuman and trust me they can't be better. For maincourse we tried lotus root, veg spicy fried rice, Kung pao chicken and steamed bhetki in black bean sauce which was good too.
The infusions and well spread bar with pretty nice collection of wines incase you want to pair them with your meal courses. Tried their mocktail virgin laloo, amazed how this all flavors works out so well thanks to the bartender.
Now comes the dessert just picture perfect well balanced in terms of texture and flavor. Raspberry delice was the winner!!
Overall it was a good experience will come back again.

Well, I had been hearing about this Michelin star restaurant since it opened up in India, and though I stay in Bombay, I had not visited this place till now. On my current visit to Kolkata, this was on my radar, and voila, this weekend Yauatcha happened, and in grand style! There were the two of us, and we walked into an extremely noisy environment, torn to shreds by the hellish kids of a large gathering. We asked for some peace, and were promptly moved to a quieter area. The staff were extremely courteous, and even in the big mess that it was, they held their poise.

Anyways, coming to the food, I must clarify in the beginning that I had huge expectations. However, we were also ready to try new things, and as we learned, that is the best way to experience Yauatcha. We started with a pot of Orchid Pao Chung Cha, or Orchid Cha in short (:P), and the tea came in a beautiful looking pot. The flavor was subtle and flowery, and the broth was perfect. While sipping on the tannin, we sifted through the dimsum menu. We ordered five dimsums, namely the Chinese Chive Dumpling, the Lamb Roll with Black Pepper Sauce, the Crystal Luffa Melon Dumpling, the Sugarcane Chicken Roll, and the Crispy Duck Roll. As the items appeared on our table one by one, we just dipped ourselves into a world of the most amazing steamed and fried dumplings ever. The Chinese Chive Dumpling was the first to arrive, a solid mass of prawns and crabmeat encased in a green layer of flour – the taste was simply awesome. Their soy sauce, chili oil and sweet chili sauce were all awesome, as were the pickled veggies. The first round of dumplings were devoured without delay. Then came the Lamb Rolls, and blimey, were they tasty! Oblong minced meat dumplings in a super thin casing bathed in a powerful, flavorsome black pepper sauce and steamed to perfection – this was a meat lover’s delight. Something to savor while chewing, but alas, it was only an afterthought. The next in line were the Luffa Melon dumplings. These came encased in a translucent covering, and with a filling of luffa melon, shitake, asparagus, scallions and black fungus. The taste was oh-so-good and with the in-house dips, these went like a dream. The black fungus lent an authentic flavor that you’d rarely find anywhere else.

Next in line were the two fried dumplings that we had ordered. First to arrive was the Crispy Duck Roll, and mark my words, you have never had anything like this before. When served it looks as innocuous as a spring roll, but once you dip it in the duck sauce provided by the side and take a bite off it, you are transported into a gastronomic utopia – where time flows slowly and all that you perceive is the incredible taste of meat on your taste buds and nothing else. You cannot speak, you cannot see, you cannot talk. You can only dip the roll in the sauce, take a bite, and repeat until you reach the last bite. And that is when you make the toughest decision of the afternoon – you eat it. And then regret it. I may sound raving mad but that’s what Yauatcha’s Crispy Duck Roll does to you. No kidding. And to break the reverie, it had to be the next item, which was the Sugarcane Chicken Roll - the only below par preparation of the meal. I didn’t like the flavor, however it was unique indeed. A mound of chicken mince balled around a sugarcane stick and deep fried, which infuses it with a sugary flavor. To be dipped and had with the sweet and slightly spicy dip that they provide on the side. You can skip this, but do not ever skip the Crispy Duck Roll when here.

For mains, we ordered Steamed Jasmine Rice and Steamed Red Snapper in Asam Sauce. The rice was slightly sticky and the Red Snapper was cooked in a spicy, mildly sour sauce with lady’s finger and green onions. The gravy was delish and the fish was perfectly cooked, maintaining shape but breaking apart at the slightest tease from your fork. The taste of the Snapper wasn’t lost and it complemented the sauce perfectly. Next up were the desserts. We had to make a tough choice and we went for the Mango Mascarpone Gateau, which the staff told us would be “sweet, sour and bitter”. Well, he had our intrigue. When the thing appeared on our table, it looked picture perfect, as their desserts always do. One bite into the body, and we were surprised! It really was a melee of tastes. The mango passion fruit jelly was sweet, the praline mascarpone cheese was sour and the layered pastry was finished with a dark chocolate crumble – it was an experience. There was an amazing litchi sorbet by the side, and the pastry tasted fabulous with it. These guys really have worked upon their combinations. Impressive. Enamored by the sorbet, we went for another dessert, which is a selection of ice creams and sorbets, limited to a maximum of three. We went for two ice creams – Honeycomb and Caramelized Honey Milk, and an Orange Yoghurt Sorbet. All the three were absolutely mind blowing and I bet you have never had ice creams like these. Left us almost speechless, especially the Caramelized Honey Milk ice cream and the sorbet. We couldn’t have hoped for a happier ending to the meal, and my first visit at Yauatcha was a memorable one!

We were setback by quite an amount, 1/4th of it being taxes, but I have no qualms in admitting that this was one of my most extraordinary food experiences, and an indulgence that brought gastronomical delight worth the money spent. More dumplings to try though, will be back sometime for sure!

Kolkata 's only Michelin star restaurant so its all the more reason to eat here atleast once. I throughly enjoyed the food and the out of the world desserts but for the pushy waiters who constantly try to push sell I would have given Yauatcha a 5. If you are in a group you could choose to take the private rooms they offer.

When in rome,be a roman.when in yauyatcha,use your chopsticks.Yeah,the failed analogy might not be the brightest idea to start a review,but that was the feeling I had when I visited yauyatcha the very first time.pretty soon,the conceited idea lost its hold on me,and we asked the Mr.Javed (our waiter  that day) for  knives and forks.We had a heavy breakfast in hoppipola the very morning after a bummer that is batman v superman,and while we had our appetite in our mourning at hoppipola,we ran out of it in the wake at yauyatcha.seriously,what kind of superhero movie runs its  only two big action sequences back to back,almost overlapping each other?-the remaining one and a half hour, left to being doldrums from S.T.Coleridge's magnum opus?Anyways,back to the review at hand.The shredded lamb soup proved to be much of a surprise,perhaps that goes by the name lemongrass.Being an acquired taste,it took some time to grow on us.For the non experimenter's,it's better avoided.For the irascible,it's(to be) necessarily avoided.The chicken fried rice was however,a class apart.The visible ingredients rather simple-peas and chicken,it obviously took  commendable skill set from the chef to make it something so enticing.The spicy wild prawn doesn't come in the best proportions at its pricetag,but surely packs in a punch for the palates.And in the end,this is why we deliberately spend the big bucks at such places-to create memories while having food with loved ones and friends,and for that I applaud the chef again.its one of the best main course I have had in recent times,and Mr.Javed did a splendid job of suggesting items.And just to make this little soiree look more european,we ordered some sparkling water- a san pellegrino-it just felt like something to be done at a michelin rated restaurant.bon appetit!

'Yauatcha' the taste from Japan via London... London based restaurant making its mark in the city of joy.... Something innovative awesome food.... Sweetness lies into its sui mui..... But yes be careful for what you choose, never take the suggestion from the waiter, because they themselves are unaware of the preparations. Luxury branding.... Good pinch to the pockets from the taxes. 
But, go for their Yam Sing, combinations of Beer whiskey or awesome Martini. Never try 'paper wrapped pepper chicken '

A perfect place for luxurious dining experience. Professional staff top notch ambience tasty food . Being a vegetarian I tried the vegetable dimsums and jasmine rice.. The prices are high as compared to the quantity served . Yet I had a very good experience.

Definitely the most unique Chinese dining experiences in Kolkata. The whole concept revolves around dim sum (bite size portions of food) and tea. Almost all the dim-sum on the menu is great. Standouts are the prawn cheung-fun and the hargau preparations. The duck dishes are not consistent, but they're delicious when they're good. This isn't the place for your standard haka chow and chilli chicken, don't expect it because you will be disappointed. A pretty solid experience, service is attentive. Almost fine dining.

By virtue of being a franchise of a Michelin star restaurant, I knew even before going there that the ambience and the service would be excellent but I was a bit skeptical about the food. However to my utter surprise the food turned out to be exceptionally good and exceeded all our expectations. The best part was that they had a separate A-la-carte vegetarian menu with a number of vegetarian options - a rarity in most of the authentic Chinese restaurants. We tried 3-4 varieties of dimsums and each one was better than the other, simply lip smacking. Fried rice was good too and so were the signature udon noodles which surprisingly were made of wheat. The ho-fan noodles were a turn off but four style vegetables in Szechwan sauce was excellent. We tried three mocktails in all and all three of them were unique. A special shoutout to the hot chilli sauce they serve with the dishes, we sweeped several bowls of it clean! All in all it was an amazing experience.
Guys be prepared to burn a hole in your pocket when you're here but what you get in return is something you'll remember for quite some time.:)!

The last time that I had written about this place I rated it a 4 and I told I would actually be rating it a 4.5 or 5 next time around based on my experience. Sadly, as you can see this time around, that it has actually dropped do a 3.
I had visited this place with my cousins and we wanted to try the four course meal. We ordered two meat select meals and a Chicken and Prawn Shiu Mai from the dim sums.
The following is a detailed review of each and every dish that we tried:

Salad with lotus root : This was the first time that I had tried lotus root and it was really nice. Normally I am not quite fond of salads but this salad was quite pleasant. It was fresh and vibrant and looked really pretty. I found it very refreshing. The lettuce leaves were nice and crunchy and the dish as a whole worked really well. My cousins though did not like it much. My only complaint is that the quantity of lotus root is appalling. There were barely two per salad.

Dim sums

Chicken and Prawn Shiu Mai - I have tried this dish before and that is why we ordered it separately. The dish was impeccable. Loved everything about it. The proteins were cooked to perfection. The flavours of the chicken and prawns came through perfectly. The minimal ingredients allow the proteins to shine and this fine sense of simplicity is what makes this dish so delicious. The quantity was ofcourse less but the flavours were sublime enough for me to ignore it.

Duck Rolls - This was the first time I had tried duck and I absolutely loved it. I will always remember this dish as my first and quite wonderful experience of duck. The wrappers of the rolls were perfectly crisp and the meat inside had a wonderful taste. The dish was loved by everyone and we were finally getting what we expected.

Spinach wrapped prawns with water chestnut - This dish was really pretty and looked very nice. I was worried that the sauce on top would overpower the flavour of the actual dimsum. But to my surprise, the sauce actually elevated the dish to a totally new level. The sauce had a great flavour with hints of garlic coming through. Everyone loved this dish too. But the quantity was quite less. Just 3 tiny dimsums which could be finished in 3 attempts!

Mains
The mains were very disappointing. None of the dishes were anywhere close to the food we have had thus far.

Kung Pao Chicken - The dish was highly unimpressive. There is no real praise for dish. The chicken was cooked well but that was it. The flavours were not well balanced. All I could taste was a lot of soy sauce or perhaps balsamic vinegar. The dish was at best, okay!

Chicken Claypot -
Again, very disappointing. Barely anything to say except nobody liked it. The taste was so unpleasant that I felt embarrassed to even ask my cousins to try it out. It was barely passable and was definitely not upto the standard and what made it's worse was the bill that was going to come and lets face it, dishes like this one are quite overpriced. I remember my cousin saying that one can gets better food than this at less than happy the price!

Hofan Noodles - The noodles were cooked perfectly. I have to saying the best noodles in terms of texture and cooking that I have ever had. Not too soft, just perfectly al dente (spelling issue I think!) But that's whereas it ended. There flavour was average if I try to be nice. Too many sauces that didn't go well together and it was in stark contrast to the simplicity of the dimsums. The biggest issue was the quantity. Are you kidding me?! The noodles were barely enough to feed one fully. I thought it was one of the two portions. But the waiter said it was two portions combined. I really felt cheated and if that's what I will be served, I would NEVER like to try it ever again.

Desserts

Caramel Honey Ice Cream - Thank God the desserts came to the rescue. The ice cream was perfect। Loved the rich creamy texture and the subtle flavours. I completely loved it! This was a pleasant change!

Mandarin Sorbet - Another wonderful dish. The taste was splendid. Loved the sourness of the orange that came out prominently. It has a nice texture too. All in all a nice end to the meal.

The food this time was up and down. The starters and desserts were great but the mains were utterly disappointing. The bill of 3005 rupees didn't help to feel better either! I was quite disappointed. My cousin sister even said that she couldn't believe she was going to pay 2000 (on behalf of herself and her younger sister, my other cousin) for that! I felt so bad that I up paying the whole bill. The place really needs to get their act straight. You can be as fancy as you like but the flavour is always the most important. You must nail that first!
My cousins definitely made it clear that they won't ever come back. As for me, I will still like to try it again because I see a lot of potential in this place and I feel that this place is yet to deliver its best!

A modern set up with excellent food, Yauatcha is a paradise for the lovers of Chinese cuisine. From the drinks menu to the dishes, everything they put on your plate offers a distinctive combination of flavours, tastes and textures. What I particularly liked were the stir fried tenderloin and the chilli squid, with the Golden Aster, the Ginger Martini and the Rose Wine to wash it all down. Price wise, it's upper crust, of course, but so is the crowd. Great ambience, great staff, great food - what else could you ask for?

A classy fine dinning restaurant. A class ambience, professional service, top notch food. It is very expensive  but then again it's worth experiencing it once. They have smartly crafted a set 5 course menu @ 988 plus taxed for non veg and they also have 3 drinks offer at 33 plus taxes.

I loved their food presentation. Amazing duck rolls with sauce. Loved their egg fried rice, stir fried veg with shredded chicken in szehwan sauce, hot and sour chicken soup.

Do not miss out their cocktail called LALU. Super refreshing. Also another favourite is ginger martini. Worth visiting.

Yauatcha is a beautifully done up fine dining restaurant. The decor is sleek, modern and classy, and the ambience is wonderful. The food was really good, some of the best I have had in the city. The way it was presented was an added bonus. Service was pretty good as well, and the staff was polite and efficient. All in all, it was a great experience - one I would like to repeat.

Let me begin by saying we are big fans of Yauatcha (Mumbai) and are frequent visitors there. We were so disappointed with our experience at the Quest Mall branch! And this is the second time my family has received terrible service there. 

At the beginning of the meal we were asked if we had any allergies and we said two of us have a severe bell peppers allergy and its to be avoided in all dishes. This is obviously not something the restaurant takes very seriously. Our starters and soup course was great but the main course came in parts. One rice and one veg came first for a table of 6. Our next noodle came 20 minutes later and it had bell peppers. We pointed it out to our server. No apology. He just waved at another guy and said make a fresh one for them. That and another vegetable came 20 minutes after that. By then our meal and our interest in the food was done and dusted! A talk with the manager and he said 'new people are there, what to do?' A restaurant can't charge the customers as much as they do if the wait staff can't be trained properly! 

I cannot imagine this happening in Mumbai! The service is extremely poor and the food does not make up for it at all! (Especially because meals are not served in the correct order!)

Very good authentic chinese food. Wish it was just a bit more spicy though. The veg dumpling was dissapointing but except of that the main course especially was really good. The desert was AMAZING. I can go just for desert. Only wish the portion sizes were a bit more and the prices are a bit high.

Very authentic Chinese i must say. Delicious 
Flavours were bold, breaking well in your mouth. The dishes i'm sorry i don't remember but for 1st timers don't worry. Their managers are well capable of suggesting dishes based on what your palate may be

Durga Puja's Special Menu Launch at Yauatcha

Trends both in dress and eating habit keep on changing during the Puja. As a recent trend the traditional Bengalis are up to try out something new, be it dresses and food. Experiment is taking the place of tradition. The restaurants are also not lagging behind in the race. Almost all of them are introducing some new menus to celebrate the auspicious occasion. One such newly opened restaurant is the Yauatcha at the Quest Mall Kolkata.
                                                                ...

I had gone to Yauatcha for lunch, on my mom's birthday. The ambience is good and i really liked the interiors. Located on the fifth floor of Quest mall,it's hard to miss. You can sit either outside or inside the restaurant. We chose to sit inside. There were so many items on the menu that we found it hard to choose. But finally we ordered wrapped chicken in bell pepper followed by steamed jasmine rice and stir fry breast chicken with szechuan peppercorn in a claypot.
The food was awesome, as it should be, but i just wished there was more of it.
We were in a hurry so didn't have time for dessert but next time i'm definitely trying them.

First time i visited Yauatcha , i loved the ambience and the food . There were 8 of us including 3 under 12 . I do not  rememeber the names of the dumplings but we had three kinds . The green wrap i think it was a cabbage with excellent sauces . I must say the sauces named after two foodies there were really super hot . they were specials . We wiped three large bowls of them clean . 
I had a clear veg soup which was flavored lightly with lemon grass .The Stir fry beans is a must , Anyone who loves waterchestnut please do order the waterchestnut stir fry . The lotus stems are large and very different to what one gets in India . I guess they import for the east . It is one dish with less spice but then one can add the sauces ,
The vegetarin chicken puff were truely amazing , However it does contain egg , 
There were a few more dishes . I do not recall their names but i do know that all of them were worth having .
I ended up eating the spicy fried rice by it self and was wishing my stomach was not protesting .
This place is wheelchair friendly and kid friendly too . It is fine dining at Quest,

Normally the joint in Quest Mall is good. How ever today on my visit with my family I was very disappointed. They were not able to manage things. Food was cold and service was very very poor. On talking to the manager we were told crowd was too much to handle. If so they should refuse customers. They are  supposed to be a fine dine restuarant and not dhaba. Really sad when they take customers for granted.

we have visited this fine dining restaurant at last, we have opted out for a four course menu, the non veg portion among the starters we had hot and sour shredded chicken soup and my spouse had salad with lotus stem 
followed by duck roll and a lamb dim sum then in the main course rice and noodles with two variety of chicken preparation and to conclude we have gone for litchi sorbet and macrons

to rate this outlet one must say presentation 5/5, ambience 5/5 but food wise there is huge scope for development so 3/5 

overall nice experience

Yauatcha keep up your culinary skills. Its good to see that there are restaurants like this are coming up in kolkata. Well your pork sui mai is brilliant and also my favorite pork belly dish. Cooked to perfection I must say. Great attention to the meat temperatures there eh?? I will answer that question myself. Its simply yummylicious. Melts in your mouth and that is the meat not fat. Great dishes great service and very good hospitality. Has a nice menu and does give you the premium dining experience.

Have been to Yauatcha before, but this one was a quiet dinner date. The Taste of Yauatcha menu was a meal full of surprises for us.We tried both Hot and sour soup with shredded chicken and Mixed salad with lotus root. I loved the soup, the aftertaste of pepper was amazing. The salad was nice and crisp, we added soya sauce to it though. For Dim Sum we chose Wrapped chicken in pak choi with Szechuan sauce which was very appetising, but the Crispy duck roll gave us foodgasm with its perfectly crisp coating accompanied by plum sauce.The main course was a little off for us, both the Stir-fry chicken in home town chilli sauce and Chicken claypot with Szechuan peppercorngave a burnt after taste. Maybe that's the taste but it did not help our taste buds at all.Egg fried rice with long bean was a saviour but Hofan noodle was a major disappointment.For desserts, we loved the selection of ice cream and Macaron. We heart the pistachio ones! Kiwi and Lime Iced Tea is my all time favourite drink at Yauatcha.I was majorly upset because I could not make my date try the Raspberry delice, or anything in the menu with raspberry since it was unavailable.The ambience was great, service could have been better.

To put it very simply I love this place. This restaurant chain comes with a fantastic reputation. All their restaurants are loved in all the major metro cities of India and the one in Soho, London is a Michellin starred restaurant.

The food is very good. So is the service. So are the cocktails. And the desserts. The only drawback of sorts is probably the fact that it is pricey but it is completely justified according to me.

Some of my favourites include the pork and prawn shui mai, the scallop shui mai, the prawn cheun fun (love the layers of texture of this one), crispy duck roll, the crispy aromatic duck (this one is to live for), the stir fry tenderloin and pork belly. My absolute favourite is the fried squid with oatmeal. The raspberry delice is simply delectable and the hazelnut mousse and macaroon selections are definitely worth stuffing yourself.

Reach deep in to your pockets and give this place a go. You won't be disappointed.

From the very day I got to know about Yauatcha I was eagerly waiting to give it a visit. Finally the wait was over and I visited it on 22nd Feb. 

What an ambiance !! The soothing lights and the classy decoration caught my eyes instantly. We chose a seat beside the balcony covered with glass from where you can have your meal and enjoy watching the city moving slowly.

We ordered for-

Vegetable Crystal Dumpling
Seafood Shui Mai (Chinese new year special)
Spicy Mahlak chicken
Mock Chicken in spicy sauce (Chinese new year special)
Chicken fried rice
 
The crystal dumplings were like little transparent balls containing vegetables. The taste was good. The shumai was mind blowing. I could actually taste all the distinct seafood used in it. All the dumplings came in a portion of three. The chicken fried rice was simple yet very tasty. Spicy mahlak chicken was a claypot dish with generous amount of fresh button mushroom and spicy sauce. The taste of spicy sauce was new for me and I absolutely loved it. Mock chicken in  spicy sauce was delicious too. Not only the food even the crockery was worth to fall in love with.

The staffs were very courteous and helped us with our orders. Md Wasim was taking care of our table and he was looking after whether we are liking our food or not. We were very impressed with him. 

Though the pocket pinch for this place is on a higher side , I am already saving my money for my next visit to this place. :P

I'll definitely recommend this place to enjoy a classy & elegant dining.

Heard a lot about this Michelin starred restaurant. Been saving it for a special occasion..Wife's birthday and a chance deal on Little app..and we had one of the best food experiences that could possibly be had this side of south China sea..The deal from Little app was a set menu for 1 person and we had two vouchers..so we had two of every course...starting with a Mixed Salad with Lotus Root..and the journey into culinary nirvana was a GO...Mixed with the assorted sauces that they gave, it was an explosion of all myriad flavors in the mouth..followed by a prawn and chive dumpling and a chicken and prawn shuimai....delicate flowers to be plucked from the steaming baskets..
After this came a baked chicken puff which would find a place of honor in any patisserie worth its bakery shortening...so light and airy..
And a Chicken and Prawn Shanghai dumpling...panfried dumplings with succulent and juicy filling..
Just as we were just getting started....the main course is still to make its entree..get it..entree ;)

Lame jokes apart, the Fried Rice with Taro Root packs a wallop of flavor. The udon noodles could have been better..I mean I have tasted better..but its not a dealbreaker for sure...and the two main courses...Lamb in Black Pepper sauce and Prawns with Onion and water chestnuts....full marks there.

What...no..we are not done yet...dessert..most important..the finisher of the meal..the final act..light macaroons and a Chef special dessert platter (basically a chocolate mousse-ish thingy with vanilla icecream)..

Stuffed to the gills and content of heart..we made our way out..

Word of advice..If u want a special dine out for a special occasion..this is it. Better yet..get the Little deal while it lasts..

Another word of advice..don't wait for a special occasion!

We visited yauatcha for lunch today,mostly simplistic jasmine green tea,and dumplings. We ordered chicken and seafood sui mai,crispy fried prawn Cheung fun and poached Peking dumpling..

All of them were a subtle burst of flavours in the mouth. And the tea only served to accentuate that even more! At the end of the plate one wishes that it had never ended .. So it feels like the pocket pinch is on the higher side.

For dessert we ordered religeiuse and raspberry delice. Amazing dishes both of them. Plus points for the ambience and great service. Also the crockery was so amazing , I totally fell in love with them cute pieces! Cheers!

Wanted to try out this authentic Cantonese restaurant for quite sometime and finally visited the place last weekend.

The ambience of the place is quite good with black walls and white roof having pendant lightings.

We found the servers / staffs quite courteous, friendly and suggestive. Being my first visit to the place, the server even explained their concept of 4 course meal

Tea
Dimsum / Chueng fun
Main Course
Dessert

We opted for Rose Wine along with Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun (This is was too good with crispy prawn wrapped inside silky smooth and feather-like texture of the rolls - most probably rice noodles served with sauce - to be frank this was my first try of Cheung Fun and just loved it) and Crispy Aromatic Duck Dimsum (the server brought a full cooked duck to the table and shredded the full duck in front of us and wrapped it inside to prepare the dimsum and tastes good.)

Was too full try out their dessert which I have heard is one of their speciality so already looking forward to my next visit to this place. Though this is bit expensive but definitely recommended and a must try out.

What can u really say when u are so overwhelmed about every little aspect of one of a kind culinary experience. Sublime dumplings. Decent main course, but tht doesn't matter, cos its all bout dumplings and tea. And desserts are delicious.. Though the pak choi wrapped dumplings were just about fine. Nothing crazy. But overall still rate this really high because of the sheer quality of food.

I was very excited to visiting this place on 5th floor in Quest Mall especially for their wide array of desserts. Their most promoted Raspberry delice is made to attract everyone.
So I finally visited this place on 14th of November when my exams got over to enjoy their infamous 'Raspberry delice' and I must say, it really did meet the high expectations.

We also ordered a non-alcoholic drink, a 'Tokyo Cooler' which tasted really good.
We also had two different types of Veg Dimsums on the recommendation of the staff. The 'Vegetarian poached Peking dumpling' which are Steamed Dim Sums, the portion of which was tiny, i must say, but was very tasty. Next came 'Crispy Vegetable Cheung fun' which was again something new but not as great as the first one.

The ambiance of this place is very nice and the staff is very friendly. The pocket pinch for this place is on a higher side. But I would definitely look forward to visiting this place again at least for their lovely drinks and the most awesome desserts.!

The food is brilliant. The ambience is soothing. The soup was nothing like I have had before. The seafood noodles was lip-smacking and I loved the fish in black-bean sauce. All the flavours seemed to melt in my mouth and everything was cooked to perfection.

No wonder, this place has won the Best Chinese Restaurant in Calcutta. The food is absolutely fine, personal attention of the personnel, the wines, the ambience adds up to it's class. The staff is very well behaved. The ambience is classy, maybe not as much as you would expect from a Michelin star connection. Would love to go to this place again. A tad too expensive? The food's taste is worth it. Maybe a bit too much in comparison to the quantity served, like any other high end fine dining restaurants.

The ambience is very refreshing in the inside area however i do not like the arrangement in the mall corridor. It's distracting. This Michelin star restaurant has something special, however it doesn't match my taste. The service was very prompt and at all levels matched its 5 star category but m really upset and annoyed with the team concerned with reservations, as over the phone they always say that they are fully booked for the night however, when we were there, only 2 tables were occupied. I think it's their strange strategy to increase curiosity among people to visit the place.

Fantastic ambience for a soft sunlit lunch. The window tables at the top floor of a posh shopping mall overlooking the not so brilliant skyline gives us a good view of the privileges we enjoy at the cost of hunger. 
Well, poetic angle aside, the food is ok. I mean you won't talk about the food till your next visit, but then what do we, the common, understand of authenticity. If it tastes great for the moment with a digestive price, we're good.
We ordered, Prawn Cheung fun, Indian sea bass with hot oyster sauce, spicy seafood noodles. Sufficient for the two of us. The noodles were a bit too fried for my liking. However the starter, prawn Cheung fun with a soft coating of I don't what was awesome! 
Turn off was the fact that my plate had a stain and so had to get the waiter to serve a clean one.
Waiters and staff were warm and friendly. They will take a pic if requested.
Happy ending comes with a dessert. Jasmine Tea Cake was exquisite and when you share it with your special one, it gets even better. 

Last but not the least, the verdict is - I will visit the place again but I won't try to pronounce the name.

When one googles Yauatcha, an exemplary profile of Hakkasan restaurants opens up and on reading about it one imagines delectable taste, presentation and experience of that befitting a Michelin star awardee. Sadly, Yauatcha Kolkata is such a miserable let down.

The ambience of the restaurant is just above mediocre, the staff is friendly but almost give the feeling of aimlessness and last of all the food is just below average which made our experience quite disappointing. 

The food was off to a good start with the soup (Clear soup with Asian Greens) hitting all the right notes when it came to taste. The presentation, albeit, had no wow factor. Things went downhill when I asked the steward if the chef could prepare a Som Tam (raw papaya salad) since it was not on the menu. He agreed readily and got me a plate of raw papaya dipped in sweet vinegar! Sad! 

After this it was one bad dish after the other. The Singapore noodles were flavourless, the stir fry vegetables in Schezuan sauce and the lamb preparation was so sweet, it seemed the chefs in the kitchen were on a literal sugar rush! 

We walked out without dessert afraid of whether the desserts would have any sweetness at all since the mains had just about covered any craving of our sweet tooth. 

When I think about my experience, I do want to give them the benefit of doubt that maybe it was just me who didn't appreciate the food because maybe my taste buds are just too "desi" to get authenticity. But hey, the idea is to give your tastebuds a good time right...so why was it not just me in our table of 4 comprising of experts at good food that thought we would not walk into Yauatcha again? Something to think about eh...? My rating - Can Avoid.

Visited this restaurant last week. The decor is calm and serene. Very posh set up and nice crowd. The dimsums are to die for. We ordered one steamed and another grilled dumplings, both equally awesome. For main course we order veg fried rice with corn and asparagus and kung pao chicken. I found that the chicken has too much soya sauce which made it really bitter for my taste. The food is within budget. Our bill was around 2300 which is decent enough. If you love authentic Chinese food, you should definitely visit this place

This place makes you feel the aura of luxurious impression and fine dining in spite of not being extremely expensive. This 5th level restaurant in Quest Mall is one of the best restaurants that I have tried out. The large glass facade in the interior of the restaurant provides a panoramic view of the Ballygunge skyline (which may not be very enticing to watch, to be honest). The service is prompt and there are a plethora of seafood items cooked with exotic spices and animal extracts. The servers had made it a habit to inquire about your allergic responses before taking any orders.

We took a Lam Peak Martini and a Tin Hau martini as drinks and Chicken and Prawn Shanghai dumpling as starters. Both of them were quite delicious. For the main course, we ordered spicy seafood noodle with mongolian style lamb. The noodle was supposedly cooked with sperm oil and contained pieces of prawn, molluscs and oysters. At this point, we were reluctant to order any more dessert but now we're glad that we ordered. For dessert we had Jasmine tea cake which is served along with Vanilla Honey ice cream and it was very palatable.

PS: A great place to eat. Definitely try out the desserts.

My City has a gem embedded in Quest Mall..YAUATCHA! A place very close and near to my heart..the mouth watering delicacies, would happily poison myself with the cocktails provided. They have an exotic decor, the excellent hospitality provided, also a closed space provided for business meets or meetings with necessary arrangements made.  Desserts are not to be missed at any cost..The next level Oriental Cuisine. Worth the price charged..
A must visit!

THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH THIS PLACE IS THEY CHARGE SERVICE TAX AND VAT ON SERVICE CHARGE WHICH IS AN UNFAIR PRACTICE.SUPPOSE YOUR BILL IS RS 100,THEY LEVY A SERVICE CHARGE@10% AND THEN CHARGE THE GOVERNMENT TAXES ON THAT 110(LIST PRICE+ SERVICE CHARGE),WHEREAS THEY SHOULD BE CHARGING THE GOVERNMENT TAXES ONLY ON THE LIST PRICE. I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS IN THEIR FEEDBACK LEAFLET AND AM RAISING THIS ISSUE HERE ON ZOMATO AS WELL..
Now,unlike the previous experience,I really enjoyed the food today..veg cliche dimsums are very nice and truly one of a kind..the spicy veg fried rice and tofu were also quite food..honestly the food here is a little bland and not that spicy as compared to other chinese joints but taste is really good..ambience and decor is amazing and staff quite courteous too.. I remember they gave me a complimentary dessert last time when I had complained about their noodles being too bland and some sprouts also sprinkled over it which had given it a bad taste.. I would have given it a 5 star rating here but because of the billing issue,I won't.. I would suggest the management to look into this issue and get it sorted as it may be a matter of just 20-30 bucks but it's definitely not fair..paying service charge is okay but you can't afford to pay government taxes on those extra charges..

After a lot of anticipation, finally paid the place a visit on my birthday. I must say the restaurant entirely lives up to the hype. Had Hot and sour soup with shredded chicken,  Baked chicken puff, Chicken claypot with Szechuan peppercorn, Hofan noodle and the wonderful & delectable chocolate and raspberry macarons! The soup had the correct amount of acidity and sweetness, the baked chicken puff was also the sweet n savory surprise I was looking for. The balance of flavours in the main course did not disappoint us too. And boy oh boy, were the macarons amazing. They left a great after taste too. But if I have to be nit-picking, I think the quantity of starters & dessert should be increased. And the time taken in between the starters and main course could and should be reduced. But in all, if you are craving for an authentic yet unique rendition of Oriental delicacies to satiate your taste buds, your search stops here! At least for now.

We ordered pan fried dumplings, shangai noodles, braised chicken and added an amazing dessert to it. Had a great evening. Do try.

First of all This is not a Michelin star Restaurant! It's the sister restaurant in Soho,London who has the star. Ambience and the service of this place is excellent, very modern. Although I felt at the end of our meal they became slightly reluctant. Our order was

🔸Orange and chili- This is a non-alcoholic drink with orange juice,lemon grass and palm sugar. It has a lip-smacking flavour because of the chili.

🔸Chicken char sui cheung fun- They serve 3 rolls. Slightly sweet in taste, great rice noodle crust which was very soft. You will love the sauce.

🔸Stir-fry kam heong lamb- Best lamb dish I have ever tasted. The meat was cooked with perfection,it was soft,juicy. This dish has lots of small ingredients like parsley and curry leaves and although it might look like a familiar dish but the flavours will keep you guessing.

🔸Raspberry delice- Another complex dessert dish. The light raspberry icecream was excellent along with the coated chocolate mousse. The sourness of the raspberry sauce will neutralize the sweetness of the dessert. What a pretty dish!

Okay here is the thing.. Michelin star or not you will certainly love the experience. The 'wow factor' for me is their dishes,most of them you'll not find anywhere in kolkata. Its one of a kind. You might feel its little bit heavy on the pocket. Only slightly!

✔ Ambience and service- 5/5
✔ Food Quality- 5/5
✔Value for Money- 4.5/5

Yauatcha establishes itself in Kolkata with a massive reputation -- its sister shop is Michelin Star Rated. The one thing to remember when coming to a restaurant of this sort, is that you will probably be left disappointed at quantity -- irrespective of quality.

The first thing you'll notice is that Yauatcha is well decorated, as expected. The staff is friendly and their crockery and cutlery are all polished. Lighting inside the restaurant is good, unless you're the sort who prefers floodlights. I don't make it a point to come to very expensive restaurants regularly, because apart from the financial factor, they often serve up tiny morsels -- Yauatcha is no different.

Even the food is exceptionally good, their quantities are minute. But what were you expecting from fine dining? Their dimsums and their Shui Mai sore through the air and completely wipe out competition. Their mains are very blase. The entree promises so much, only to be left disappointed by a rather unspectacular main course. Their noodles and rice are the same as everywhere else -- I've probably actually had better noodles in most other places. Their sides are also comparatively uninspiring. This proves to be a MAJOR let down, after having some of the best starters Ive ever had.

If you're pricing your food at a thousand per plate - you're either serving massive portions, or you're serving incredibly good food. The starters fit the bill. The mains do not.

Yauatcha still promises to be an exciting experience -- unique in many ways, while paving a new path for fine dining. I also happened to have broken a glass (accidentally of course), which they promptly cleaned up and turned a blind eye to.

Good food. Good experience. Left unfulfilled.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Turned up here for new year lunch to a totally empty restaurant. The young lady at the entrance made a fuss since we didn't do a reservation :-) typical snob attitude i guess or a training issue

The chefs are very skilled. 
The Food is great, bass in black bean sauce stood out. 
Portions are really really tiny and their is no service of serving the food per se.

My takeaway is to dine here when you are on strict dieting or just wanting to spend some bucks off.

YAUATCHA,a Michelin Starred Fine Dining Restaurant,gained fame all over the world in pan-asian cuisine,is now in my own city,KOLKATA,especially in this winter vacation.Situated at the Level 5,Quest mall,this quaint restaurant has carved out it's own niche' in the mind of foodies from kolkata(Also in tummy :) ).Yesterday,Ivisited this place for lunch with a foodie friend and fellow zomatian SAGNIK BISWAS .It was a treat from Sagnik.We went there around 4 p.m. and found it scarcely crowded at that time.The lady at the entrance,polite and elegant,guided us to our seat.
AMBIANCE/DECOR:- A quaint restro,decoration was smart,modern and fussfree.Smart white hanging lamps,Grey chairs and sofas ,complementing very well with Wooden walls.Icing on the cake,it was decorated for X-mas which made it vibrant! 
SERVICE:-Excellent!!!the waiters are very polite,well-trained and pretty knowledgable about their delicacies!!!A real thumbs-up!!They guided us on the using technique of CHOPSTICKS!!!(A real tough job indeed!! :p).FOOD/CUTLERY:- Now the main part comes,i.e. FOOD!! LIP-smacking is an understatement though!!! We ordered their speciality 'Dimsum Trail'(special menu) in non-veg select,alongwith the cocktail and finished it with dessert.In 'Dimsum Trail',one can select total 6 different variations from the list. 
Our order:- Lalu( 2 no.s)-It is their signature cocktail( vodka based),suggested by                                           the waiter and amazingly refreshing!!!Loved it.                  
 Steamed prawn dimsum(3 pc.s)-Succulent,juicy,bite sized pieces with                                                                         soft,marinated prawns.Healthy it is!                    Crispy Duck roll(2 pc.s)- Best amongst the dimsum trail!!! Minced,spicy duckmeat filling in the crispy roll.Divine it is!!Served with hoisin sauce.                   
 Chicken roll(3 pc.s)- Cannot recall the exact name of this dish.This was okayish in comparison to all others.Shredded chicken pieces,rolled in a thin ,soft coating and glazed with soya sauce.                     
 Prawn and chicken fried(4 pc.s)- Cannot recall the exact name,but it was very much palatable!!!Served with soya sauce.Very filling too..                      
 Baked chicken puff(3 pc.s)- A new take in chicken dimsum and quite amazing!!Shredded chicken tossed in caramel and light soya sauce and filled inside the crispy dimsum,laced with caramel sauce.Sesame seeds were sprinkled over it and served in a bed of julienned red cabbage and carrots!Foodies,who love to experiment with dessert,can give it a try and no disappointment!!Guaranteed!!                       
 Chicken steamed momo(3 pc.s)-Succulent,juicy bite sized momo's with a different filling.Casing full of shredded chicken and warm broth,it was served with julienned ginger infused wine sauce.The waiter  guided us about the way this particular dimsum is consumed.Awesome it was!!!!              
 Grilled fruits and vanilla rum ice-cream(1 portion):-Loved it simply!!It was sugarfree and smoky flavour gives a newedge to this dessert.A must try!!                         
Their cutlery collection is worth mentioning!!! VALUE FOR MONEY- Our pocket pinch was 3157 for two people(inclusive of all taxes).Yes,price is on higher side a bit,but it gives you a memory to cherish...so for anything special to celebrate,worth recommendation!!

P.S.:-Their washroom was squeaky clean and fresh!!Brownie points for this,as i am quite cleanliness freak!! Long live Yauatcha..will visit again!

This is a critical review, so I am going to keep it as balanced and objective as possible.
We dined on 01-01-2016 between 2.40 and 3.40 - Chk no - B00028670 - Table 42
We were waited on/served by Amir

About the Food:
We ordered Spicy Seafood noodles and Kung Pao chicken. 
The seafood noodle was well-prepared and we enjoyed it thoroughly.
Kung Pao chicken was good in terms of recipe but poor in execution, as the chicken was so CHEWY that one could have used it as a PENCIL ERASER. 
You do not expect this when you pay a premium.
Portions are small for the price - even Chinoiserie at Taj Bengal offers bigger portions. Anyway, this was not much of an issue for us, as we all are light eaters.

About the Ambience:
Very pleasant - the colours soothe the eyes, and accentuate the typical hues of Chinese cuisine. This is perhaps the biggest plus point of Yauatcha. Out of my rating of 2 for this place, 1.5 goes for the ambience and 0.5 for the food.

About the Service:
This is where it hits the real low. While the service was fairly quick, it was far from courteous. While ordering, we were enquiring with the waiter/server about the non-spicy fish options for the entrée, and this is what he said to us:
"There is a non-spicy option, but it is too expensive."
Believe me, that is what he actually said, with a pejorative look on his face.
My temper shot up a few notches in an instant, and I was about to give him a proper dressing-down when I realised that I was with my kid, and I restrained myself. 
Later on I asked him if we could get a high chair (the one for the babies), and this person did not even have the manners to say "Sorry, we don't have one", or "Sorry, it is already occupied." Instead, he flicks his head and mouth to the right to indicate a negative answer.
Having said this, I am still prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, as he probably comes from a background where such behaviour is not considered impolite. Instead, I entirely blame his manager, whose training of his/her staff is abysmally poor, if not non-existent. The staff does not even know what kind of people come to a place such as Yauatcha.
On the point of service, Yauatcha Kolkata miserably pales in comparison with its London origins.
We were also not presented with a feedback form with our bill, as we were on our earlier visits. May be the delusional management thinks that it is doing spectacularly well. If I had received the feedback form, I would not have necessarily bothered posting a feedback here. 

If the management really wishes to do something about this, it should do better than copy-pasting standard replies for positive or negative feedback.

We came here on the 31st for a reunion treat of cousins! Yauatcha is located on level 5, the moment you enter the retro, a warm ambience welcomes you. We had to prebook the seats as there is a reasonable rush. Hence table bookings are recommended well in advance. We started our lunch with dimsums, heavy multi layered sauces, and white wine to complement with. The delicacies were a treat as we went for the next items. Mushroom, vegetables mixed thoroughly in edible potato whirling bowls came up. It was spicy added with specially made sauces.  Fried rice was another highlight with peas and rice well prepared. The deserts were top notch. We went for the raspberry cake, along with a jasmine tea cake, chocolate hazelnut mousse. The overall experience was great, and would love to pay a visit again. Cheers!

Good Dimsums.. but If you are not familiar with the mall, this place is a little difficult to find.  Amazingly multi layered sauces.. heavenly!! Had the soy noodles - dont recall the name - home rolled - really good, but they are so well spiced in themselves that no dish went with it. 

So check with the chef on your dish choices. the service is ok. 

Overpriced Small serving sizes, 1 noodle serving not enough for 2. But overall good food.

I visited yauatcha for Christmas lunch. Thank god I had made reservations. It was fully crowded by the time we were seated and we didn't even get to seat inside.
We opted for the festive menu that they have made which will be there till 31st. They have a separate drinks menu for this as well but we couldn't drink so much so we ordered beers separately.  It was a five course menu. From the salad to dessert everything was mind blowing. 
The salad was mixed veg with lotus roots. The vinaigrette they mixed the leaves with were really tangy and juicy. Boy o boy writing this review is making me crave for it. We took prawn and chinese chive dumpling and chicken prawn shui mai. Such cute and delicious little things. The duck roll with plum sauce was made crisp to perfection. The pan fried chicken shanghai dumpling with the side chili sauce was good. The portions were really good and more than enough for 2 people. Then came the stir fried lamb in black sauce and spicy wild prawn curry. We took a rice and udon noodle to accompany it. 
The dessert was chef's platter. It was the highlight of the entire course for me. Souffle with real vanilla ice cream and macaroons. 
We gulped everything down with kingfisher pint beers.
Overall really a nice experience.

They have a wonderful range of dumplings and other steamed starters and quite frankly I'm more than making a meal out of them! 

But beware, Yauatcha subscribes to the schezwan style of cooking so if you can't handle a lot of mirchi have a conversation with your server before you order. 

They have a wide range of desserts that satisfy everyone cravings. I would recommend the raspberry mouse and the macaroons.

Came here for 1st time on this Christmas. Overall, its a different experience of mine. The ambience was really sofisticated. Greetings were quite watm. When it comes to food, quality is awesome, however, compare to that, quantity is quite less. Would recommend to look into the quantity since price paid for that is quite high. I specially liked veg fried rice and steamed bhetki. However, would recommend to include some more fish items of betki in starters and msin course with some sweet n sour flavours. Also the desserts were really cool.

Yautcha is a popular international chain of restaurants present in cities like London,Bangalore and has recently opened in Kolkata. It serves authentic and good cantonese and oriental food.However it is very expensive. We went for the set non veg menu for lunch.It consisted of two choices in soups namely Sweet corn chicken and Sweet and sour soup.One person could opt for any one of these. The starters included various type of dimsums namely Pak Choi dimsum rolls, Spinach wrapped prawn dimsums, Baked chicken Puff dimsum and Crispy duck rolls. The last dimsum was the best has it had unique taste and structure and was served with a sweet sauce. We took two drinks as extras namely Tokyo cooler and another Chilli Pineapple mocktail. The main course consisted of Hafun noodles and egg fried rice. Hafun noodles prepared with flat noodles and is tossed in sauces and served with chicken.The clay pot chicken with peppercorns and Kung Pao chicken were good main course items. The dessert options included Litchi sorbet, ice cream and Macaroons. We tried one each. The Litchi sorbet was the best. However the macaroons are the best you will get in entire Kolkata. Overall has a very nice ambience but then the quantity is bit less compared to price taken.

And so it was my birthday, and I finally visited the place I have been longing to eat at. First let me explain the thing about the Michelin Star. Yauatcha is a mutlinational chain, with its outlets all round the globe. The London outlet was awarded a Michelin star in 2005. And so this Yauatcha at Kolkata is not a Michelin Star restaurant but is part of that esteemed chain nontheless.
Now, as we entered the restaurant on the fifth floor of the Quest Mall, the first thing that caught my attention was the wonderful glass wall that offers you the view of the city from the top of the building. We were escorted to the table by the attendant, while the restaurant was filled with people, generally families.
After receiving the menu, me and my 2 friends ordered a Vegetable Chive Dumpling and Chicken and Prawn Shui Mai for starters. The dumpling made me realise that vegetarian food too can be amazingly palatable. The Shui Mai, with its funny name, was okay. For the main course, we had Kung Pao Chicken, Egg Fried Rice and Fried Chilli Squid. Now the Kung Pao chicken was good. The Egg Fried Rice, in all its simplicity was great. The Fried Chilli Squid was the hero of the day!! Served with biscuit crumbs, it was unique, delicious, and worth the hype I am creating!! :P.
For desserts we had Macarons and the Jasmine Tea Cake, which were also good, as expected. And all this for Rs. 3057.
Yauatcha is a wonderful effort to bring the authentic international version of Chinese cuisine to the Bengali palate, and I must say they are doing a pretty good job. Will certainly visit again!

Perhaps a sacrilege, but unfortunately truth is always ugly. A complete waste of money time and effort. Now this is the first restaurant in which I failed to move beyond the entrée. The place apparently famous for dim sum rather be infamous as a scallops dimsum tastes just like pork dimsum. The caviar decorating it is just that, no taste. Need i say more? Hence I feel the review should have an end as similar to our foray into the the infamous eatery- abrupt

Excellent place! Probably the only restaurant chain in India that serves Chinese food in all it's authenticity. You can make a meal out of just having dim sums and dumplings! Try the one with the soup inside (Shanghai dumplings or Hun Dun)!

Terrible food. You expect consistent food delivery from a Michellin Star restaurant. The quality of food in their Vasant Vihar, Delhi or BKC, Mumbai outlets is significantly better. Most of the wok fried food was over-cooked - close to being burnt. Never again to this outlet of theirs.

What a classy place to have a fine dine. The food here is very neat, with a single glance at the food you can be half full. The price is quite expensive but is worth everything they have got. Their food is to the point and they know what they're serving. The ambience needs a special appreciation.

This is not your usual oriental cuisine thing . Yauatcha is this hot girl in college whom you wanted to hang out with only to realise she is not worth the hype. The quantity is dismally low , prices v steep ,but hospitality and presentation out of the world . If it wasnt for the raspberry delice i would say Yauatcha is your quintessentially high priced average restaurant . Blame helen mirren for ranting so much about the status of achieving a michellin star in 'The hundred foot journey' ,that i had my expectations set real high .

This place has a classy ambiance and decent decor. Service was commendable. The cocktails we had tasted good. We tried their prawn dimsum which almost melted in our mouth. It tasted a-ma-zing. Their chicken fried rice was a disappointment. The main course chicken dish was tasty. 
Price is a bit on the higher side.

Finally a michellin star restaurant in Calcutta. Its slightly on the expensive side if you decide to have a full 4 course meal with alcohol. The dumplings are delicious. I ordered the same dumplings thrice, I found it so good. The dessert was pretty good too and it looked beautiful. I had ordered the raspberry delight. The noodles though was a bit overcooked and the s chicken that we ordered with it was nothing extraordinary

Been there on this weekend after hearing or reading about it for so long. It's the only Michelin star restaurant in Kolkata.

1. Ambience -Good

2. Staff- Welcoming, Polite & Efficient

3.Food- We ordered for Tan cha, which included a pot of Jasmine Green Tea, vegetable momos( they were steamed and pan fried) and Macaroons.

The Jasmine tea was perfect, Flavour and aroma of Jasmine in Tea.

Pan fried Momos did not meet our expectation. Used to steam momos and was expecting steamed. The filling of Momo was good , but the Oil they were fried in smelled awkward. My spouse could not eat a second bite due to that smell.

Got 4 different flavoured Macarons. Liked the raspberry and chocolate ones. They were like sugar candies with cream within.

Presentation of course was good.

As the brightest kid on the oriental cuisine map of the city turned a year old recently, it celebrated the occasion, among other things, by meeting a bunch of foodies from diverse fields in what it calls the ‘Evening of Eminence’. This is the name of all such evenings where Yauatcha, the Michelin-starred restaurant at Quest, hosts accomplished people from various fields over dinner. It was an honour to be invited to this edition of Evening of Eminence as a blogger.

My chosen welcome drink was virgin Lalu (The actual cocktail has vodka. I wanted a non-alcoholic drink for health reasons). The lychee juice along with lemongrass set the palate for the variety of dim sums/ dumplings (a forte of Yauatcha), that followed.

There was a special menu for the evening. In the starters (non-veg), arrived Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun, Chicken Dumpling with Celery and Carrot, Xo Dumpling and Crispy Lamb with Raw Mango. I also took Fried Turnip Cake from the veg section. The Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun is my favourite in Yauatcha’s dim sums- a soft steamed wrap (like in a dim sum/ momo) of chicken encased prawn, shaped like a thin roll and is served drenched in soy sauce. The wrap melts in the mouth bringing forth the crunchy chicken casing, followed by the juicy and soft prawn at the core. The chicken and the prawn play the perfect contrast to each other. In the last one year, it has become a signature dish of Yauatcha that reflects its stature of one of the best oriental cuisine destinations in town.

I liked the savory turnip cake. The dumplings at this restaurant are fine dishes, thus they call for an acquired taste. I liked the Xo Dumpling more, made with prawn and topped with mashed egg white. It tasted better with the chili oil and the special chili sauce. The purple hue of the chicken dumpling comes from beetroot. The Crispy Lamb with Raw Mango was good too, with a subtle interplay of the tanginess of raw mango and a dash of sweetness.

The main course arrived. My pick was Braised Chicken with Mushroom in Claypot, Steamed Red Snapper in Asam Sauce, Ho Fan Noodles and Spicy Vegetable Fried Rice with taro and spring onion. Simply loved the Braised Chicken. The succulent chicken pieces teamed with mushroom in the light gravy with a hint of sweetness worked wonders for my palate. It easily became my other favourite in Yauatcha. Being a ‘fishy’ Bengali I liked the spicy snapper fish dish too. The Ho Fan Noodles was a nice vegetable preparation with flat and wide rice noodles (Ho fan) and soya chunks. I took more of the fried rice which had a balanced spiciness and worked fine for me.

Dessert, just like dim sums, happens to be a specialty in Yauatcha and the well-designed dessert platter showed why. It proved enough distraction for almost everyone to stop talking and take a glance at it. It had six varieties of macaroons (a chewy cookie which Yauatcha is especially known for), three types of petite gateaux (cakes, including Raspberry Delice) and three ice-creams. I have known the Raspberry Delice for so long, thanks to posts on Facebook, that I had to try it. The mushy chocolate mousse inside the velvety bright red crust was sublime! The vanilla-black currant ice cream was a superior treat too. And the macaroons, not extremely sweet, were fun bites. They came in strawberry, pistachio, and chocolate flavours among others.

Wish Yauatcha a very happy anniversary and a great year ahead! Cheers!

Umm, I kind of have a lot to say here. I loved certain things and disliked some stuff. The dumpling and soup were good. The rice and noodles were not to die for (which I expected would blow me away). Would I recommend people to come here? I don't know.
I took my parents out for dinner for the first time (which also happened to be the day of their 20th anniversary) and it could've been better.
The prices were exorbitant and quantity too low for a meal. I had an open mind about the quantity hoping that the taste would make up for it. Anyway, i wouldn't say it was bad. It was good. Not very good though. 
Good service. Lovely ambiance. :)

Had another good experience here, despite it being quite crowded.
The smoked pork ribs were really very good -- juicy, tender, cooked just right, and meaty.  
Stir fried water chestnuts, snow peas and black fungus was crisp and succulent -- as good as it gets in any fine dining Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong/ Singapore. Kudos to the chef for actually preserving the taste and texture of the vegetables as it should be.
The Dim Sum basket tasted OK, but the aesthetics and construction of the individual pieces left much to be desired. After all this is Yauatcha, not some sidey joint pretending to serve Chinese cuisine. Dim sum skin is an art form by itself -- it should be paper thin, almost translucent, so you actually see the ingredients within. It definitely should not be thick and gelatinous, never mind the very unappetising colors they came in!!

Also, the stuffing should be tender and juicy -- these were so overstuffed, they turned out like misshapen lumps of meat/ fish thickly coated with maida!! Mr. Chef -- please try not to murder this delicate Chinese cuisine!
Definitely sub standard for such an otherwise top class restaurant!

Enjoyed their refreshing mocktail..loved their pork & prawn steamed dim sum..but the highlight was definitely the dessert..jasmine tea cake is a must try..super yummy & their menu certainly is interesting enough to warrant a second visit with an intention to try out their soups n main courses..hoping to up their rating after another visit..
The only downside would be their prices & maybe the quantity..if they cant reduce prices i would suggest to increase the amount slightly..but nevertheless its a place to try out most definitely..

Review #200

Surely Kolkata got the X-factor in the culinary scenario when lately few biggies decided to setup their outlets in the city. And one of them is definitely Yauatcha which is a Michelin star restaurant, the only one of its kind in Kolkata. It is considered as one of the Top 50 best restaurants across the globe. Yauatcha which was created by London-based restaurateur Alan Yau in 2004 entered India with its branch in Mumbai couple of years back, this branch at Kolkata became operational by end of 2014, so it is still pretty new to the Kolkatans. Originally it was created in 2004 at Soho, London and it specializes in Dim sums. Here our dedicated waiter took out a minute and explained us the concept behind Yauatcha where he spoke about this specialization in dimsums. As I have heard from many, to Kolkatans it seems Yauatcha is just one of those highly expensive restaurants in the city, but few highlights the positives you get from it; to me the overall experience was awesome and highly pleasing, surely a place you can come back with your family or group of highly esteemed guests or clients.   

LOCATION - - - - - You will get mesmerized at this place which is located at the 5th floor of Quest Mall near Park Circus. The area which it covers in this floor is huge and has got both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.

AMBIANCE - - - - - Well I might fall short of words in explaining the ambiance to you! So I apologize in the very beginning, the place is much bigger than my ability to express myself in this review. I am rarely awestruck or mesmerized by interiors or ambiance of an eatery and surely here I was more than spellbound to say the least. The plush interiors redefine class and the overall ambiance exudes warmth and happiness. The suave seating arrangements, lights, flooring, wine cellars, bar counter, everything looks so classy! Also the place has got arrangement of high chair for your little one :)  

FOOD - - - - - With most of its ingredients being imported this place truly tries to maintain its international standards, high ratings and the Michelin star badge! So we stayed glued to some of their delicacies in their special lunch menu along with couple of mocktails. Here are the items we ordered for:

<< Soups >>

a) Asian Green with Tofu - - - - - The soup was served in a nice custom made bowl with loads of vertically cut pieces of Tofu, shredded carrot, noodles and other bits of veggies. The broth or rather the soup was soothing and perfect to start off with the meal.  

b) Shredded Lamb Soup with celery & mushroom - - - - - This was again having loads of veggies, mushroom, lamb chunks and topped with cilantro. Tasted awesome and gives the push to start off with your meal without further delays! 

<< Mocktails >>

a) Virgin Mojito - - - - - Now they do not have Virgin Mojito in their menu but when they found we were craving for some they readily decided to prepare the drinks for us. And oh man! It was probably the best Virgin Mojito which I had! It had the perfect kick of mint leaves and served in huge volume with crushed ice, lovely thirst quencher!

<< Starters >>

a) Chicken Wrapped in pak choi with Szechuan sauce - - - - - It was surely a visual treat. The presentation was awesome. The three dimsums were served in a pool of super tasty and garlicky Szechuan sauce. The dimsums were actually a filling of chicken and veggies wrapped in Pak Choi leaves. It was heavenly! Must Try!

b) Pan fried charcoal lamb bun - - - - - Again the dish had awesome presentation, but the core attraction was surely the dimsums. The dimsums were indeed very honest to say the least; they were filled to brim with well prepared chopped flavorful pieces of lamb, and nothing else. The skin had a unique firm yet tender texture which was one of a kind. The dish was an awesome try and it did thoroughly please me with all its rich contents, surely do try this.

<< Sides >>

a) Stir fry beans with Shitake mushrooms - - - - - I didn’t expect much from this vegetarian dish but then I was truly amazed by its intense flavors! The beans were cut into comparatively bigger pieces drenched in a dense paste of Shitake mushroom! It was so unique yet again. Must try!

b) Braised Chicken with Mushroom claypot - - - - - This is a pretty introvert kinda dish with quiet flavors. The overall dish I would say is very comfortable and soothing, but what attracted me most was the texture of the braised chicken pieces, they were so soft and bouncy. It amazed me with each bite! The veggies in it were all very well prepared with some good amount of gravy in there making it a perfect side for dry rice or noodles to go with. 

<< Mains >>

a) Ho Fan Noodles - - - - - The presentation again caught my eye hands down; it had an array of colors spread over it making it more appetizing and inviting. It was stir fried with exotic vegetables and had a lovely enticing aroma to it. These typical noodles also called the Shahe Fen noodles are broad, bit chewy and slippery; they are somewhat hand cut so in general they are not of equal length or width. But overall with the veggies and sauces they taste remarkable. Must try!

b) Egg Fried Rice with long bean - - - - - It tasted simply out of the world, yes I was blown away. The preparation is so simple yet so flavorful. The aroma of the rice was driving me crazy and I was craving for more when it finished, felt the quantity served was somewhat less! Will surely order this when I’m here again. Must Try!

<< Dessert >>

a) Chocolate Hazelnut icecream - - - - - Again a lovely yet simple presentation. They have a special dessert section here and the ice creams are all kinda home-made i.e. made at Yauatcha only. The two scoops of chocolate hazelnut icecream was finished in a couple of mintes time, they were so good, rich, tasty and dense. 

b) Macaroons - - - - - Oh I loved every bit of these macaroons. I had already heard loads about these macaroons at Yauatcha. It is hard to imagine how a Chinese joint prepares such out of the world macaroons. They are well shaped, mildly moist and were just melting in the mouth. Must try!

SERVICE - - - - - Probably the only place in the city which will get full marks for service. They were super courteous, well-dressed, extremely well trained and very well informed. I was super impressed by all their moves. They kept a close eye on our table and came to us for every little need. They kept on asking me if the dish was good every now and then and as said earlier they took out the time to brief about the place and the food in the beginning (which is ofcourse a regular routine for them). 

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.7/5
Food quality: 4.8/5
Food presentation: 4.7/5
Value for money: 3.7/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

My overall rating comes close to 4.5 out of 5. 

Coming to the pocket pinch, this place charges extra VAT, Service Tax and Service Charge so your final bill will be on the higher side but their Set meals are surely quite reasonable to try out. The oomph of this Michelin star restaurant is sure to amaze and impress you, so do make some plans to visit this special place with your loved ones or family for that ultimate fine dining experience in your very own City of Joy. 

Highly Recommended!

Cheers!

Visited this place on Sunday for lunch... Yauatcha a difficult name to pronounce with their difficult names of dishes... We decided to try this exclusive Restaurant.. We received a very warm welcome and attended nicely... All the difficult named dishes were explained to us... We ordered several dishes starting from soups, starters to main course, desert... We ordered Lamb soup, Crispy prawn cheung fung, Baked Chicken Puff, Chinese Chive dumpling, Stir-fry chicken with Szechuan Peppercorn, Steamed indian seabass in spicy black bean sauce, Spicy seafood noodle, Mangi Mascarpone gateau... All the dishes were extraordinarily tasty and well presented... We just didn't like the baked Chicken puff which was sweet in taste.. It didn't suit our platter... If u r looking for fine dinning then this is the place... A must visit... but yes it's a bit heavy on the pocket.. Thanks to @Debasmita our friend for the lovely treat... :)

The lamb black pepper dimsums had a really nice flavour, must be tried if one's here. But it's the Jasmin Tea Cake as a dessert that should be had here even if one's having dinner elsewhere. They only big downside is the 40% tax in total that adds on to an already premium-priced restaurant as this.

Historically what started as a tea house that serves amazing dumplings.. This Michelin starred restaurant with suave interiors and posh servers lives upto its reputation and still serves amazing dumplings. My best friend and I ended up for dinner on Nabami Night. We ordered the non veg dim sum platter, some sea food stir fired noodles and the much fabled Raspberry Delice. The dim sum platter was good... Loved the Prawn dim sum topped with Salmon roué. The others which included a chicken dimsum, baked chicken puff... A huge snow ball filled with spicy chicken and a crispy duck dim sum. The platter was very assorted and had different tastes to tantalise out taste buds. The seafood noodle was awesome.... Very large portions compared to most fine restaurants... And finally Raspberry Delice.... The crazy great dessert... That tastes as good as it looks... Raspberry dark chocolate mousse, Raspberry ripple ice cream, Hazelnut brownie and Raspberry... All amazingly well crafted and sweet... Just when your palate is a little too sweet you get just the right amount of tang from the Raspberry insert and you are in heaven!!!!
One should not miss Yauatcha ...
Not at any cost!!!!

Another lovely dinner at Yauatcha, this time in my option the food surpassed the last time we were there.... the pork belly in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce with soft melt in the mouth buns was out of the word... with a side of bokchoy and julienne of spring onions for that extra crunch.... the seafood dumpling soup with supreme broth was supreme indeed.... gorgeous and comforting.... the hot abs sour soup with shredded chicken was delicious too...
The non vegetarian dumpling platter with what in my opinion was the best dumplings ever.... especially the one wrapped in onion scale....

The desserts surplussed all expectations.... they were not food but experience.... the Raspberry delice was awesome as always but the mouse with tea and quenelle of tea infused ice cream was delicate and delicious ...
Again the pocket pinched to pay the bill.... but it was worth every penny!!!! Sayantani Sen

I've been wanting to visit Yauatcha since quite some time, and given a friend of mine, shares the same love for Chinese we decided to check the place out. 
We went there during the second day of Durga Puja, just when the crowd had begun trickling in( mind you, consider your self seriously lucky if you manage to find a table at a nice restaurant without much hassle during the Pujas) 
Anyways, the first thing you notice about the place is their plush ambience and really well done decor. The staff is very polite and friendly and that makes it a wonderful experience.
For starters we had the chicken and prawn shui mai and the lamb roll with black pepper sauce. I loved the lamb rolls and the sauce perfectly complemented the rolls, the chicken and prawn shui mai were these cute looking yummy miniature dumplings. 
For the main course we ordered chicken fried rice along with braised chicken.I'd credit them with brownie points for the amazing presentation of each dish along with the fact that each dish in itself was lip-smackingly delicious
Although, Yauatcha is famous for its deserts, since we were on a tight schedule( hey pandal hopping during Durga Puja is a major affair) we couldn't stop to try them out. But, hey that just makes sure I'd visit the place again for the desserts.
Look forward to an amazing experience, soon :-)

The thing which I like about Yauatcha is that the food served is a very different chinese than what I have had earlier..My most recent outing was a friend's birthday treat . We had crispy prawn cheung fun and poached peking dumpling for our starters.A very special mention for the prawn cheung fun which was super delicious. For our mains we had ordered mongolian lamb and penang noodles which too were absolutely yum.The ambience is great and we had a seat near the window with a view..We were recommended the jasmine tea cake for dessert  and found it to have a subtle flavour.Definitely it is a tad pricey but worth a visit .

I never knew that Kolkata serves such authentic Chinese n Asian dishes until I visited Yauatcha.
The decor was beautiful with its own signature style of short heightened tables with its hospitable service. 
For the food - I have started with 'Tokyo Cooler' which was pretty okay but moving to the Dimsums which were just fab, especially the 'Chicken Wrapped in Pok Choi ', 'Chilean Seabass Dumpling'.
The 'Crispy Prawn Cheng' which is one of their signature dishes n was the showstopper, was heavenly awesome in taste. For the main course I have tried Udon noodles with Braise Chicken Mushroom Claypot, which was definitely another very delicious dish.
Now for the desserts, one should definitely try their 'Raspberry Delice' n 'Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse' its just the cherry on top of a cake. Their desserts are the most beautiful tasty creations, which are totally exceptional.
I am very glad to taste their food, n will definitely try it again. :)

Visited Yauatcha for our Ashtami dinner. Really liked the way the staff guided us for selecting the menu. Great ambience, good food but a bit too pricey. 
Would come back though for the amazing lychee martini, the dim sums, the chocolate hazelnut mousse and raspberry delice. So soo good!!

Visited on 25.10.2015 afternoon, got a seating area outside as could not access the landline mentioned on zomato to book a table. Used groupon voucher to dine a 5-course meal, though the offer available at restaurant was less than voucher amount. Decor seemed great, with music heard only inside, choice of seating areas etc. As per menu, Asian green soup with tofu tasted lovely, warm and homely. The dimsum with chicken packed in pok choi in schezwan sauce tasted lovely. Though quantity wise was little, hence had to savour it. Next was pan fried charcoal lamb bun, tasted good, bun was different than normal dimsum casing. We ate in mains was ho fan noodles, egg fried rice with chicken in mushroom claypot and kung pao chicken.  All the items flavoured just amazing and brownie points for presentation of food. Serving staff was courteous and as it was our first visit, even introduced yauatcha to us with a quick briefing. Desserts were sorbet and macaroons which were just awesome and i waited my whole meal for their desserts as they have a fab display as well. Well as it is fine dine and Michellin star restaurant, do not expect to be value for money as quantity was little even though served singly but the whole dining experience is a visual treat and thats what i might come back for.

The Decor was beautiful - spaced out and with courteous service . 
Coming to the food - The 'Dimsums' were awesome and so was the 'Turnip Cakes'  with the 'Chilli Dip' 
I did not want to taste the Turnip Cake but glad I did - I loved it 
'Raspberry Delice' - somehow I felt I did not like it that much - it was good but not something Exceptional 
But I will again try it again though :P

I have mostly eaten in their flagship on Broadwick and that is a hard act to follow still the Quest outlet deserves a thumbs up for trying to render somewhat similar experience in Calcutta . I personally believe that it is always hard to replicate the magnificence of something with so little shelf life (ingredient wise) and still offer something to Calcuttans where the weather conditions just does not suit this kind of an eatery. If I dare say that  It is a brave effort !

I had the "Scallop Shui Mai/ Truffle edamame dumpling/ Raspberry delice , all nicely done and plated properly. Perhaps your servers needs to be slightly more up the street for widely travelled guests  !

The one which I would humbly suggest is that if you could introduce your" Truffle pork belly rib" and some recipes from your top chef " Graham Hornigold"  , cheers .

Raspberry Delice! 😍
The meal that I had there is probably one thing that is going to stay with me for a lifetime. The staff is very attentive and courteous. Everything that they serve feels light and fresh, and not to forget delicious. Do visit this Michellin star restaurant for an amazing experience.
P.s. NO, they haven't paid me for writing this review. :D

I went to Yauatcha yesterday. My experience was simply awesome. This is the only Michelin star restaurant in Kolkata so I was quite curious about it. Yauatcha fulfilled my expectations. Though it is a bit costly but food is with superb quality and also nice ambience and decor. I am looking forward to visit again.

On Saptami this year (Oct 20, 2015) we visited Yauatcha in the afternoon to sample the dim sum trail menu. Along with the six dim sum baskets that we chose from the dim sum trail menu we also ordered for Jasmine tea, pak choi dim sum & raspberry delice.  

Though the food was amazing but I started to dislike my experience at Yauatcha for other factors. Firstly a housefly jumped into my jasmine tea .... How on earth could a housefly make its way into a Michelin star restaurant? And even if it did, how it could go unnoticed by the restaurant authorities? It's a HUGE let down. The server however promptly brought another pot of jasmine tea for us but by then our experience had turned sour.  

Then what made matters worse is the that the gentleman serving us forgot to serve us the sixth dim sum basket chosen by us from the dim sum trail menu. When we prodded him pat came the polite reply: "You have already been served with all the six dim sums you chose from the dim sum menu trail." But when we insisted that he was making a mistake he waited for a second and said he would have to check and went away. After a while he came back accepting that he was wrong and that we had to be served with the sixth dim sum basket chosen by us. 

Even in smaller restaurants (decent but not upmarket) I have never been told that our order was served even when it was not or have not seen houseflies around my table.   

Good food is served in so many places these days in Kolkata, where much like Yauatcha food not only tastes yum but is also presented as a work of art, as a concept. So why visit Yauatcha and walk out with a slim wallet? Why pay 10% service charge for the deplorable service? 

Goodbye Yauatcha ..... would never bother to walk in again.

I was a guest today and it was the best experience ever. Thank you Jonaki for the amazing Lychee Martinis. And the Raspberry Delice Cake was good enough for me to finish 3/4th of it all by myself.

Let me not even get to how good the dimsums were.

Dipankar was an amazing host! :') Thanks a ton, Yauatcha :')

The decor is beautiful. And the blinds going up as the sun sets is a poet's delight.

Yauatcha located on level 5 quest mall is a treat for the senses.Right from the ambience to service everything is just perfect. You get an awesome view of the city if you can get table by the window.Must mention about LALU a really refreshing drink which was marvellous.In the starters don't miss the crispy prawn cheung fun its too yummy.the other dimsums we tried were equally great (don't remember the names though) in mains we had udun noodles and stir fried chicken which was superb.For dessert we had one of the most instagrammed dessert..raspberry delice and it was truly a work of art and heavenly to taste.A bit pricey yes but absolutely worth it.

This was my first and probably my last visit to yauatcha. The only good thing about this restaurant is the ambience and the view. We visited this place on nabami for lunch and initially we sat outside and they made us sit for over 10 mins without serving us water and nor did they give us the menu cards though the restaurant wasn't crowded so I was initially disappointed by the service and the attitude of the staff! After sometime we shifted to the main seating area and the service was somewhat better over here. Coming to the food, we had ordered a chicken dimsum along with a fried Grouper and both of the dishes tasted horrible! The main course which consisted of a chicken fried rice and a braised chicken in mushrooms was good and especially the chicken, it was soft and well cooked. The quantity as compared to the was really very disappointing. Our bill was around 2600 and it was a complete waste of money!

Good ambiance.. Good service.. The restaurant served delicious food presented beautifully. This was the second time I visited this restaurant and had a really good experience. The restaurant serves a good variety of food but one needs to be judicious in the choice of his or her dishes or must ask the staff for their recommendations after stating your tastes and preferences.
The desserts are amazing. One must try the macaroons here.
The only negative thing i experienced was that a few of the dishes were not well balanced in flavor such as the sauce in the chicken and prawn dimsum was too strong and it over-ruled the dish. 
The overall experience is good and a visit is recommended.

It is situated on 5th floor at Quest. We got a very warm welcome and courteous deportment at the very first entry in yauatcha. Although the amount of food is not satisfactory enough with respect to its cost but yauatcha is one of the restaurants who always serves you sophisticated foods and give customers' comfort first priority as well. Their happy hours lasts from 4pm to 8pm on which you can get 3 drinks (both alcoholic and non alcoholic but you have to choose from the selective drinks ) at 388. They chrges 27 % vat on drinks.
Apart from food and drinks,both the interior and ambiance are magnificent.A true foodie should visit here once! Great place

Dimsum is all you can think about the place, was not very much convinced firstly to check into there as I thought it was more about Like a bit luxury dinning and ours was supposed to be a loud lunch with lot of gossip over food,but once we got in, it was very comfortable, a bit expensive but then the special are always special in this place. A thumps up for this place.

When I heard the Michelin starred restaurant  was opening a branch here didn't wait. The dimsum did not disappoint. The jasmine tea was excellent  and to top all the the dessert was one my wife will never forget. If flavours are key to good food they also fill you up with satisfaction.  Never thought so little amount of food would be so fulfilling. Kudos.

So much had I heard about Yauatcha, but just-above-average an experience did we have.
Their famous platter of deserts, which we ordered to satisfy our sugar craving, consisted of the raspberry delice, chocolate mousse and chocolate eclairs. There were also a vivid array of macaroons of various hues. All picturesque and almost pristine though to look at, only the macaroons and raspberry delice were truly worthy of applause for their taste. In a place that serves food notorious for the exorbitant prices, one expects better consistency.

And affordable too as long as you don't get into drinks lol
My must have! Truffle edamame dumpling !!
If you are an edamame beans fan, you can request them to get you bowl full of those , unpeeled with kosher salt
Others: chicken dumpling
Vegetarian fried rice
Stir fried veges with fragrant chilli sauce 

The tea drinks are yummy too!

Tip: ask them to give you the mixed sauce for dumplings, as they do this only on request

When we entered no people were there,we were the first customers, at first I thought since this is an expensive restaurant maybe that's why people are ignoring this,but then people started to come and it got filled up. Anyway, the ambience is so good with little light only on the table.
One of the best dimsums I have ever tasted. Tried 'Wrapped Chicken With Black Pepper' & 'Chicken Wrapped In Pak Choi'. I must tell they are good in chinese.
In drinks, I must mention that they are having some drinks festival or something like that so we tasted 3 drinks, first Sula Red Wine, then a cocktail and at last a mocktail. Here I must mention that the cocktail is very good.

Well I visited this place in Quest mall over the weekend and it was sheer pleasure. I was already aware of the reputation that this place holds and was expecting some great food presented with the same flavour. I was not disappointed. 
There were two of us. For starters, we had ordered Pork and Prawn Shui Mai and Crispy Duck Roll. Along with this, we ordered Citrus Martini and a small fill of Dalwhinnie. Both the starters were absolutely marvellous and leave a long lasting impression. The shui mais were specially very well cooked and served with great taste.
Coming to the main course, we had ordered the below.
Braised Seafood in Spicy Sauce
Spicy Seafood Noodle
Pork Belly
The seafood noodle was absolutely brilliant keeping very true to its genre. There could have been a chance that it ended up like the seafood sizzler s in Mandarin restaurants, but it was not. As I said, the preparation was very true to itself and the noodle tasted yummy. The braised seafood was a tad less spiy to me and the only one in my opinion that might need a bit of improvement. By improvement, I would concentrate on the content and variety of seafood and not the taste of it. A special mention has to be made of Pork Belly which is the best I have had till date in Kolkata. There was a special way of presenting it as they stuff the pork inside a bun. The thin buns are served separately and then they open it up with a stick. Then they fit the pork within it and serve the stuff like that. You just put that into your mouth and it melts and gives that amazing feeling. The taste of this particular dish deserves a special mention and I would keep coming back for this.
Lastly, the showstopper was the dessert where we had ordered Raspberry Delice. This was signature stuff and it wins the menu hands down. The mousse was delightfully prepared and served, while the ice cream stuff was kept aside.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to all the food lovers in the city. It might create a hole in your pocket, but trust me, you would not regret it.

Historically ,Yauatcha  opened as a tea house serving delicious dimsums… that kind of instantly gives you an imagery of a quaint,bamboo structure with low lying wooden tables…. But wait! as I was entering this suave and swanky Michelin starred eatery on the top floor of Quest Mall as that imagery sort of got a makeover. What followed was history as well ! From the interiors, to service and most importantly food it was simply a delight. I cannot more recommend their Crispy duck roll and the Chicken shanghai dumpling for starters. Desserts were definitely the highlight with the showstopper of the evening THE RASPBERRY DELICE & THE HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE MOUSSE… looks to drool over , taste to die for! To sum it up you cannot miss YAUATCHA…. No not at any cost. I plan to go back for some warm brews over comfort dimsums. ah ! my BMI  

I d like to reviese my previous review of this place based on repeated visits. 
Yes, it is still really overpriced. 
But what i ve realized is that they are a dim sum speciality restaurant. If you are craving a proper chinese meal with noodles fried rice soups starters and mains, then i d recommended not coming here. But if you are in the mood for dim sums and some awesome dessert, then this is the only place to go to. My old review is down below. 

Overhyped, just like its Mumbai counterpart. The only good thing about the place is the view. 
You ll find bette chinese at thousands of places in Kolkata. Mainland China over this any day! 
Desserts are good though.

Let's be good, and start with the good - the place is in Quest Mall, the go to place for all those who want to make a statement about something (honestly, I don't know what). So, in keeping with the standards of the place, this fine dining destination comes with a delightful decor. You do seem to have arrived in a truly oriental eating house.

Moving on, the food comes in miniscule portions. Dimsums are good, but are as few as 3 in a box. Frankly, that just leaves you craving for more (and fighting, whether to relish the taste, or curse under your breath about the quantity!)

I'm a vegetarian. I ordered something like assorted, exotic veggies in a brown hunan-kinda sauce, that came in a clay-pot. The sauce was slimy, and the overall taste was average at best. That said, this was unanimously voted to be the best dish of the main course we ordered. And we were 4, the other 3 being omnivorous.

The non-vegeterian main courses came with unpleasant surprises and without warning. Such as accompaniments/garnishes containing raw eggs. Or, enoki mushrooms, batter-dipped and fried beyond recognition.

The cherry on the cake, was the innocent looking sea bass! A good friend, with a passion for trying out new types of fish ordered this. He claimed it was not really the best fish he's had, but maybe that's how this fish is supposed to taste. But, wait for it, it cost us INR 3200 for a single dish! We just happened to miss out the subtle, greyed out, price listing in the menu. Really no one's fault but it just left my friend feeling super embarrassed, almost ruining his lunch experience. Waiter dears - a little heads-up when you're taking orders, maybe!

I mean Calcutta has a HUGE number of options when it comes to oriental cuisine. So you really got to do a fact-check as to what's your USP, people! Pull up those socks.

A friend of mine was in town for just a day, and was really craving for the Chinese food. She has been around the India and has had some of the best Chinese food out there. She chose this place on a whim, and it was tremendous. We need to make a prior reservation for the seats, which is a must in a Michelin star restaurant. She ordered food of chefs choice, instead of going to the menu because we don't want to take chance on the experience . As we left on Chef there were great choices and we left very satisfied. Dishes hail from various regions of World. The food was awesome so was the service. 
Do stay for dessert. 
Cheers !!

After watching the movie.. "The 100 foot journey".. I came across with the concept of Michelin star restaurant.. I searched the net and got one in Kolkata.. My 1st visit was a little disappointing as the restaurant, did not allow to dine without prior resevations.. I did not give up.. Had to visit and indeed it was an experience..!!
Whenever i visit such places with high expectations, I prefer to go by the chef's recommendations and not experiment on my own..

Last Sunday it was our turn to visit Yauatcha as part of the bookings we made under the Restaurant Week India program. The first experience with La Cucina made us so satisfied that we knew it will take something really special for Yauatcha to match that experience. Once we arrived we were guided to our reserved table with a lovely view of Kolkata. The ambience was posh and it was less crowded than we expected. We were also a bit apprehensive about the portions as I've read many negative comments about their portions in Zomato. However we already decided our orders before we arrived and we placed the same along with a fresh watermelon juice from my wife and a chilled beer for me.
The food took some initial time to come but we realised the wait was worth it. In the beginning we were made to feel special with an amuse-bouche i.e. a kind of appetiser as per chef's choice. It was a kind of baked dimsum and tasted lovely. With that we were already in that frame of mind which tells us everything is going to be perfect in future. Next came our ordered appetisers - chicken and prawn shui mai and chicken dumplings. It would be a justice to say that those were the finest dumplings I ever had. The presentation, dumplings and the accompanying sauce was lip smacking. Then we were server the mains - Crispy lamb, steamed snapper in red asam sauce with a fried rice and ho-fan noodles as staples. First the portions were more than enough. So we decided we'll try one main with one staple and pack the rest as we wanted to keep space for dessert. All of them were so tasty but I'll single out two of them. The vegetable ho-fan noodles with soybeans tasted nothing less than a non-veg one. The lamb was in a format and presentation which I never imagined I would be having. We were full to the brink still we made unanimous choice in the dessert section - the Raspberry delice. Oh my! It was a breathtakingly beautiful dish with amazing taste. In the masterchef language there were so many elements in the dish - the tempered chocolate, raspberry icecream, which chocolate granules,the chocolate moose with raspberry spray and many other elements inside. 
Overall wonderful experience in every sense. I'll surely recommend everyone who loves asian food.

One of the most horrible experience from a luxury dining place like this. Day before yesterday, went to this place and ordered a desert. I've had it a number of times but it tasted horrible, on telling the same to the manager, he took the same away and wasn't ready to accept that it had a problem. He asked me what the problem was? How will I know if the sugar is less chocolate us more, I'm not a chef. Will avoid going to this place again next time. Just horrible. And yes, I was charged for that desert which he threw away, and on asking him of the same, he said, I didn't like it, its not his problem. Just horrible!

So I was a bit anxious before going there as the place seems to be expensive however my outlook has changed. The food is so good that it's worth it. 

We ordered the turnip cakes which was plenty for the two of us. It was crunchy outside and really soft inside. Next we ordered egg fried rice and chicken with shiitake mushroom in a claypot. The chicken was succulent and the flavour was mesmerising. It blend well with the rice. And at the very end was waiting the kind of deserts. The raspberry delice. It looks like a velvet cake inside which you will find raspberry dark chocolate mousse. It comes with raspberry ripple ice cream, raspberry insert. 

When it comes to money well it was around 2k for 2 which I think is ok when it comes to good food. 

Hoping to visit soon.

My husband and I were in Yauatcha Kolkata last week for dinner and were terribly disappointed by the service. Being regulars in the Delhi branch we had gone there expecting similar service and the usual wonderful food. However much to our horror our server for the evening, for all the initial welcoming noises that he made, completely forgot to convey our main course order to the kitchen so that after having our starters we were left cooling our heels for the longest time ever. Once we realised what was going on we decided to cancel the order and it was only then that the server came to us and started apologising. Anyway we walked out after the starters and with the memory of this unfortunate experience. Left a bad taste especially since we love Yauatcha food and think that their dimsums are the best we have had after Hong Kong.

I have been to Yauatcha innumerable times since it opened in Kolkata. Excellent food always. I chose to write a review today because of the person serving me. Anirban who took "service with a smile" to another level. I was in a bad mood due to various reasons and kept getting phone calls through the entire meal , Anirban was always there with a smile in spite of my snappiness. So a special shout out to him . As for the food my all time favourites are Hargau ,Chicken  Char sui Bun, Spicy seafood noodles and Spicy wild prawn curry. Great food and the greatest service.

Being an international brand it doesn't really live up to its expectations. The ambience is slightly gloomy, the food is very good though. They have a decent bar. However make sure you have a fat wallet when you are going to Yauatcha because it's a massive pocket pincher! They can do much better!

Made reservation on a Saturday evening (recommended). Our server for the evening  introduced himself and took us to our table. The decor is minimal yet classy. Started of with vegetable crystal dumpling which was very average. For main course, vegetable fried rice with taro and spring onion, chicken fried rice and four style vegetable.i totally loved the chicken fried rice and the sides. They serve chilli oil which went very well with the fried rice. And the star of the evening was the dessert. Was recommended to try their signature dessert which is chocolate and hazelnut mousse and it was mind blowing. Since it's a Michelin star restaurant, it is slightly heavy on the pocket but it's definitely worth it. Also, the server was very helpful and made us feel comfortable. Overall a great place.

One word- speechless. Literally, I was eating with so much concentration that I didn't have time to speak. The food is awesome(as I was just telling you), and the ambience is nice. I really had a great experience on my first visit and I am looking forward to dropping in there again! Keep up the good work!!

Best chinese in town? Yauatcha it is.
Located on the 5th floor in Quest Mall, a very good restraunt. The food is execellnet there! I had gone with my friend, we ordered a Chicken Soup, chicken dimsum, egg fried rice, kung pao chicken. All of them were heavely! The quantity is just sufficient, and its really filling. The rates are surely worth it. Plus the hospitality is great too. Look forward to visit again!

The Michelin Star fame resteraunt with lots of hype. Honestly the ambience is no where near appreciation. But the food is fabulous. Right from its awesomely done dim sums to a very sumptuous main course and heavenly desserts, everything fell in place. Being a veggie, it was a delight to find a place which has more veggie options than meat. Personal suggestion: DONT MISS THEIR DESSERT NAMELY Chocolate Hazelnut...

My bias towards Asian food notwithstanding, I must give an A+ rating to the fantastic menu at Yauatcha. The choice and preparation of dim sums is superb, there's an outstanding tenderloin dish to boot and the red velvet option on the dessert menu is to die for. The last time I was there, we went in a group of 20 people, and the service was somewhat haphazard - that's the only reason they don't get a 5.0.

Went here for a date last Monday and honestly I was left in complete awe by its interiors, beautifully designed sitting pretty on the top of the most expensive mall in the city; very few restaurants can live up to an ambiance of this quality.
As for the food, the dimsums  tasted really well and so did the egg fried rice(the smell was tantalising), the prawn was well decorated but was a bit hard to chew so minus points for that. Ordered a special dessert with Happy Birthday written on it and the staff were very cordial and quick to respond. Even lent a helping hand in us clicking our photos. The price is on the higher side but this is a MUST visit for anyone out there in the city. Looking forward to coming here again. Hardly does a restaurant mesmerise me as much as this one. 
Food-4/5.

Yauatcha rarely disappoints! this was my third visit to this Michelin starred restaurant, which has actually redefined Chinese fine dining in Kolkata. We are madly in love with Prawn cheung fun and this time also it was excellent... prawn and pork sui mai, peking poached dumpling, asian veg tofu soup, mongolian lamb and spicy veg rice with egg were the other lipsmacking items in our list of order. As dessert we opted for Jaffa cake and Jasmine tea cake.. subtle flavours, excellent presentation are hallmark of this place, it has a long menu of dimsums, I have explored only half of it, being a hardcore non-vegetarian I am still unable to jump on to the veg items... however, the veg soup was delicately done to perfection and we loved it.. Mongolian lamb was good.. we were a little bit disappointed with the poached dumpling.. It was a pre-birthday outing or my daughter and ended up as we had planned it to be thanks to Yauatcha ....

Heard about this Michelin Star restaurant from quite a few sources. 
The Setup: Placed atop the quest mall, we were seated at a place overlooking the atrium...which was quite a distraction, with all the people moving around. The other side however looks out onto the rustic view of nighttime Kolkata...a great setting to enjoy a some good food and the accompanying conversation.
The Service: In this segment the place lives up to its name...from the reception to the waiting, its courtesy exemplified...the waiters explaining and suggesting aptly off the menu.
The Food: loved the desserts, starters were good and the main course was average. That kind of sums up the food experience. But we were so hungry, that we were halfway through our food when we thought of taking a few snaps.
For starters, we ordered the fried prawn cheung fa...a good balance of tastes and textures. The lamb roll dim sum was ok-ish.
Main course included steamed Jasmine rice and braised chicken with mushrooms in a clay pot. The chicken was good, but the rice lacked the flavour of Jasmine.
Dessert: The sweetest part of the meal...literally. We went with the waiter's suggestion of Raspberry delise and Mango Mascarpone Gateau and they lived up to their reputations.
Overall, a good dine-out. Would have been happier had they served Sushi.

I have been to Yautcha several times both here in Kolkata and in other cities! I have always enjoyed the food knowing that i am getting good quality food and thus do not mind paying the extra amount for my meals! Today we ordered our usual selection of dimsums but i was quite surprised with how Yautcha Kolkata has decided to cut corners!! The 3style mushroom cheung fung usually has a mix of shitake, straw and another mushroom! Today the straw mushroom was replaced by button mushrooms! Maybe everyone cannot make the difference out, but i was really disappointed as it just did not taste the same as before! If i want to have a common mushroom like button mushroom i can go anywhere in the city and not bother with coming to a fine restaurant like Yautcha and paying a premium!! It was a very disappointing experience as i am very fond of that particular dimsum which also looked smaller and minuscule in size. Its sad to realise that a restaurant like Yautcha has to resort to such underhanded ways to save money and cut corners!! I hope in future they keep the diners overall experience in mind before doing something like this!

Minus points ONLY coz it's expensive and I can't go eat there all the time.There were three of us and we were seated despite not having a reservation on a Sunday.It gets crowded and this was prime lunch hour.We got a table outside but it wasn't uncomfortable and it was rather fun to be able to people watch..The service was efficient and courteous.We went with the drink offer that they have which is 3 drinks at 388 plus taxes and it's a good deal.We tried the Tokyo Slide which was the best cocktail out of the three.The others were Thea Martini and Lalu,yes they have a cocktail named after a politician.😛The drinks have strong southeast Asian flavours and if you don't dig that then go for the mocktails coz they are subtler flavour wise.We wanted to have a couple of dimsums and not go for the mains.We tried 7 dimsums and the lamb in oyster sauce,Hargau and crispy prawn cheun fung really stood out!Perfectly balanced and cooked and the seasoning was delicate but just the right amount. Crispy prawn cheun fung was moist and soft outside while having a crisp layer inside and finally the prawn inside.Really fresh seafood and the Hargau was simple but exquisite despite it being just single prawns cooked inside a pleated rice flour skin the dish blew my mind.The prawn was cooked perfectly and it was juicy which is quite tough to do and what with the covering being so thin I really do commend the chefs skill.Dessert platter was plated beautifully and was so good all we said while eating it was mmmm so good.We got six macarons(different flavours),two raspberry delices and honeycomb icecream with different flavour inserts.Yummy and super worth it. It was a birthday treat and for three people we paid just short of 5 grand but I would totally go back.Super impressed with the place!!

First time there and it was amazing !! 

Orders- 3 cocktail combo for 330 plus tax each and a dimsum trail of 6 for 2000 ai and a raspberry delice 

The cocktails were amazing. We had one martini, a whiskey based one and a martini and all were amazingly made and went well with the food 


The dimsum platter here is to die for!! Starting out with a duck dimsum with an almost pastry like outside to a light chicken dimsum with broth inside of it. All of them were bursting with flavour. You get 6 plates each which has varying portions of 3 or 4 per plate but they are decent enough to fill you up 


The desert was amazing. The delice lived up to its hype for me but was too fruity for my girlfriend Sneha Narayanan

Pocket pinch 3588. Decent for the quality. You can eat here for cheaper and also for much more than that amount. Which is something I loved.

Okay! So let's get to it. Wanted to try out Yauatcha because of all the attention that it had been receiving of late with a multitude of pictures flooding my facebook page. Was greeted by a pleasant gaggle of girls, however while being seated and given an introductory walk-through the lady did seem a tad bit grumpy and dead-pan. Was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. So, the lunch was cosy and quiet which I loved. Our server Javed was excellent. Coming to the food- ordered a light meal consisting of flat noodles in blackbean sauce which was light and flavoursome, however because of the hype around was expecting something more. The dim sums truly exhibited culinary expertise. The pakchoi wrapped chicken dimsums were a pleasure to watch as to eat. Especially the carefully seasoned and fragrant sauce that came with it. Absolutely gorgeous and very fresh!                                                                         Coming to the dessert-their prized raspberry delice was up for my fancy! And boy did I love it. Truly michelin-starred experience. The raspberry delice is not overly sweetened which is a huge thumbs up for me, as is the innovation of the red powder encrusted mousse and little hidden treasures within. Overall extremely happy with dessert. Hope to see more of you guys!

Classic Dimsum and Dessert place... Wide variety, steamed/ fried... Different fillings... Nice sauce accompaniments with dimsums...
You can probably give the mains a miss and gorge on the starters and desserts!! The desserts are pretty as a picture and exquisitely balanced in flavour.. Something that will attract you to return.

The obvious pincher is the high prices, but then again, once a while it's worth it.

As the famous Alan Yau creation Yauatcha crashed onto our shores from London, pictures of their stunningly-plated dim sums hit every social media platform with force. Expect each portion of their signature dishes to be plated beautifully and served by waitresses dressed as Chinese ladies in a setting that is dainty with an air of whimsy. For optimal visual pleasure, go for the gorgeous classic dim sums, high tea, desserts or the refreshing cocktails exclusive to Yauatcha.

My friend and I had a wonderful evening at Yauatcha few days back! After a whole day of weighty meal we came here only to enjoy some cocktails and desserts. While entering we were politely informed that if we had any prior reservations or not, since we didn't call ahead but as soon we informed that we didn’t make any reservation they immediately allotted us, our choice of table and our waiter, was a wonderful server.

This is one spot you foodie people need to check out pronto. Charmingly situated on the top floor of the Quest Mall, serves a variety of cocktails. We ordered ‘Lalu’, ‘Nama Bay’ and ‘Tokyo Cooler’ in cocktails and in desserts we love to try out their both signature speciality ‘Mango Mascarpone Gateau’ and ‘Chocolate Mandarin Tart’.

Doesn't the Lalu – oolong tea infused vodka, lemon grass and lychee juice sound awesome? One sip and you find out its one-of-a-kind drink, as the bartender prefers adding his own twist to create this unique cocktail. This elusive restaurant serves some of the most bizarre cocktails you've ever heard of. Anyone up for Nama Bay? It was also an amazing drink made with gin, campari, lemon grass, ginger and fresh orange juice.

It made your thirsty heart thrilled with every sip. Wait till you feel the kick these beauties give you! Tokyo Cooler was very refreshing it combines lemongrass, raspberry, guava juice, peach juice and elder flower syrup. This place will definitely have something to suit your distinct alcohol personality. So hurry down to get your fix of cocktail flavours in seemingly absurd but surprisingly delicious concoctions.

In desserts, my friend Abhijit Chakraborty had the Mango mascarpone gateau and I went for the Chocolate mandarin tart! Both just melted in our mouth (I snitched a bite of my friend's).

Yauatcha’s chocolate mandarin tart was probably one of the most expensive desserts out there, but if you're hankering for a really indulgent dessert and have mad love for chocolate, then you're going to want to get your hands on it. Its super smooth, extra chocolaty, rich and creamy – does it get any better than this? In chocolate mandarin tart the orange yoghurt sorbet was perfect enough to offset the sweetness, and was a nice contrast to the soft braised tart. You wouldn't want to share this.

What's truly enticing about a good dessert is a balance of sweetness and flavours, and Yauatcha totally nails it with their Chocolate mandarin tart with mandarin caramel cream, orange confit and orange yoghurt sorbet. As always, be sure to have some cocktails here — my opinion Lalu was perfect with this sweet treat!

Another must-try dessert is their Mango mascarpone gateau -- a truly innovative dessert of Feuilletine crunch, mango passion fruit jelly, praline mascarpone cream and fresh litchi sorbet. Life is like mango, it’s sweet, it’s sour, and it becomes yellow as it matures. Enjoy life a little bit more with their awesome Mango mascarpone gateau.

This rendition is close to flawless in every way and in the case of Mango mascarpone gateau, the innocent pat of mango passion fruit jelly that adds a depth as it melts into liquid gold and becomes one with the praline mascarpone cream. This was absolutely delicious, though I tried a little portion; still I felt it was one of the tastiest mango desserts I've had in a very long time.

They usually gets busier in late evening, so be sure to call ahead for a table if you are planning on going there. Come for a birthday treat or enjoy time with friends & family or for a day-time date! Oh Yes, these pretty delights are pretty pricey too! Can't wait for another special occasion to go there again!

Yauatcha had been one of the places we have long wanted to visit, owing to the ratings on food blogs and reviews and recommendations of our friends. Finally, we were able to go there for dinner a couple of days back. Well the first thing you would notice about Yauatcha, even before you actually enter the place, is the hospitality. We were warmly greeted on arrival and welcomed into the restaurant. Then the waiters would actually come and introduce themselves before introducing you to the concept behind Yauatcha. The ambience was very sober with gentle music playing in the background. Also, since Yauatcha is located on the top floor of Quest Mall, and We were able to get seats near the windows, it was actually a great sight to look out to the Kolkata skyline at night. Coming to the food now. For starters, we ordered Chicken and Prawn Shumai. It was an awesome dish to have in terms of the quality. Even though the quantity might seem to be a bit low, four small pieces of Shumai, yet the taste would delight you to a great extent. For our main course, we had Egg Fried Rice and Chicken Szechuan Peppercorn, both of which, again, were delicious indeed. Another thing I would like to point out is the customer service. After each dish, they would come and ask you how the food was, and even if they should change the cutlery. They attended to every customer with care. Well, I guess people would not mind if they did it a little less too. Anyway, at the end of it all, it was a great experience.

Being the only Michelin starred restaurant of Kolkata, Yauatcha enjoys undisturbed superiority. But truly saying, it could have been much better if they gave a little more helping of their esteemed delicacies. The decor and ambiance is absolutely like a heaven with those mall lights glowinv your artistic sofa-chairs. The staff seemed serious, not like the traditional "bosses" of other restaurants to whom you'll have a quick gossip. Probably it was the professionality which was the culprit. However, they were very helpful. Coming to the food, I'd recommend only the die-hard chinese and Japanese foodies to go there, not without a reservation, as the food is truly authentic,  not the Indian-type "chowmein and fried rice with magic masala". The taste, hence,  may seem a little awkward to some people. As for me, I went there for the first time with high expectations which to some extent were fulfilled. I tried two kinds of dim-sums of which were undoubtedly the best you could find in the city. The special Tokyo Noodles and Fried Ruce with a gravied vegetable-tofu add on was also good, but without a dash of their chilli sauce, it would seem bland to any Indian. The Tokyo Cooler mocktail was a great drink to have with the food. The dessert was the highlight which I was looking forward to. If ever you go to Yauatcha,  ven if you don't eat much, don't forget the dessert. I had ordered a dessert platter with 6 macarons of various flavours which are a must have with the raspberry,  coffee and chocolate delices combined with three ice-cream scoops for the best experience.  At last, I went out with a very memorable experience which was reflecting on my happy face. If only the helping was more,  this could have been a perfect 5 star.

Extensive choice, bit confusing, didn't know. where to start. As a first timer,would have appreciated some guidance, set menus or combos would be helpful. The staff were having their private laugh at our ignorance. Michelin stars means nothing it's the taste that matters. The duck puff was just puff but no duck! They should introduce roast duck with plumb sauce to wrapped in corn bread. Momos were fine but 3 pieces for Rs.275 is unrealistic. However, intend to visit once again just to unravel the mystery of their menus....

A perfect combination of dreamy ambience, mouthwatering bites, and smooth service.
We had dumplings and sweet prawn wrap for the starters. The dumplings were good, but the wrap was too tasty to describe! My friend planned for surprising me, 3 days before my birthday and she managed to arrange a birthday cake and according to her, the busboys and a service girl turned to be Very helpful and made it easier for her to plan everything.

Just dined today at yauatcha..It was a good experience bcoz it was my first time bt I don't think I will repeat this restaurant any more. The ambience of this restaurant was good with a huge sitting capacity. 
We tried many dishes such as dimsums , stir fry,fried rice,side dish in chicken, deserts n soft drinks. 
Bt apart from the dimsums and the desert didn't like any other food. 
The chicken fried rice was not so good , not like the fried rice, we Indians are used to.
The portions were also very limited, so make sure how much you want to eat before you order.
The price was also little bit on the higher side.
All in all a good restaurant for a different and one time experience.

Yauatcha is probably the only Michelin Star restaurant in Kolkata. I was admittedly never into the fine dining aspects of things but being a foodie I had to visit it. In summary, my experience was mostly positive. The food is great and the presentation lovely. I was particularly impressed with the Raspberry Delice, and the Fried Rice was tasty as well. Moreover, the waiter was cordial to ask us if we had any allergies or if anybody amongst us was vegan, a nice gesture.

The only negative point I could find was due to the overall serving time. Much of our time in Yauatcha was spent waiting for the food to arrive - something that I hope would definitely be improved upon. Overall, I had a good experience and would love to revisit to try some more awesome dishes.

Nestled neatly in Quest mall amongst all the Gucci and Armani stores, yauatcha is, no doubt a place to look up to much like the designer labels mentioned, in the world of food. Do not go in hoping for quantity, you will be disappointed. But go in to truly appreciate the complexity of the dishes that make it legendary. We ordered all of two things, chicken and prawn dumplings and the famous raspberry delice I had been so eagerly waiting to try. The dumplings are much like the traditional dumplings in rice paper and tasted good no doubt. But. The real delight comes in the dessert, fine dining is simply the best for dessert. The raspberry delice was beyond delicious, it was a piece of art. From the presentation to the many components it was almost heartbreaking to break open simply because it looked so beautiful, and tasted incredible. The raspberry essence merges beautifully with the chocolate and ice cream. Surely a must order.

The Michelin star restaurant spreads its roots into indian soil. Thank god they are as authentic in their preparation as they can be and live up to the name.
We true an array of dimsums. From truffle stuffed to a whole range of pork, chicken, prawns and what not. Each of them was a bundle of flavour.
The mains were equally enticing and spot on.
For deserts, the macaroons, the green tea infused ice cream were lip smacking.
My only complain, the seating was a bit too cramped and the lay out for seating could have been a little more spread out and as extravagant as the menu.

Once the Yauatcha bug bites you, you'll find it hard to satisfy yourself with anything else! This Chinese fine dining experience leaves a mark so deep, that it can't be undone. And you want to go back again and again. But you can't - because it's just too damn expensive! At least for me, it is...that makes it even more special, I guess. And I would say, totally worth it. If you're a Chinese-food-craving Calcuttan, you better save up and visit this zenith of Chinese cuisine!

Yauatcha is slick. It's suave and slick...classy in every way. Nothing is overdone - from the gentle tint of the glass to the perfectly diffused lighting, from the minimalistic furniture to the smart yet warm staff, Yauatcha spells out satisfaction with assured ease. And we haven't gotten to the food yet!

The most important thing, when you are visiting this kind of a place, is knowing what to order. This is my recommendation based on what I've had occasion to taste at Yauatcha:
• a quarter portion of crispy aromatic duck, with the absolutely yummy plum sauce and pancakes.
• the prawn and pork shui mai
• crispy prawn cheung fan (this can be easily divided and shared among a group - many dishes are too less in portion to divide - ask for assistance). It's a truly memorable dish with a velvety outer layer of rice and many layers of taste as you go inward.
• the egg fried rice - simple and superb.
• Yauatcha offers quite a variety in noodles. Choose from thick udon noodles, flat ho fan rice noodles and fried Singapore noodles. All of them bring some novelty of taste along. You won't believe you are having soya beans in the ho fan noodles unless told...it's literally like meat. But the soya sauce content in the ho fan seemed a tad too much.
• the spicy mahlak chicken
• do try out their delicious cocktails. Lalu and cha la lai were quite new and exciting.
• for dessert - 1. Raspberry delice. That's a must. Make sure you don't walk out without having that. 2. The Jasmine Tea Cake: this is a piece of heaven, simply sublime. The subtlety of taste will bring tears of joy to your eyes.

As I mentioned earlier, the staff is very helpful and smart. It's a great feeling sitting at the bar, or at the high stools, feeling the pulses of the busy kitchen beside you. But the food is best enjoyed from the comfort of a table, of course. A note about the prices: it does feel quite overpriced, but again, the value-for-money quotient feels quite high as well!

Do try it out, if you haven't already. If you have, and can afford it, keep going back! And if like me, you can't afford too many repeat visits, then dwell on your fond memories and write a review...

The Prawn Dumpling served here is my favourite. The  detoxing tea served here is also good. I had been to this place for around 3 time and the food i had each time were very tasty indeed. The "Lalu" drink here is worth a try. I like the Mongolian styled lamb served here and the crispy duck roll . The ambiance of this place is very good. The blue theme of the restaurant will make you feel relaxed. Nice Restaurant and very good  service from the staff.

In a different league ~ forget about the superb starters, entrees and desserts, even the vegetable fried rice is such a great tasting affair that it can be had by itself. I've seldom had so well-prepared food in which the whiff and taste of every ingredient could be felt subtly. Greatly recommended.

This is one place where i hv been yearning to visit for a long time and yesterday finally i got a surprise dinner treat by my hubby. Everything about this restaurant is classy starting from the ambience to food quality and decoration. 

On arrival we were pleasantly greated by the staff and everything about the restaurant and menu was explained nicely. We opted for the set menu which had soup, salad, starters, main course and desserts. 

The hot and sour soup that we ordered was very different from what we get in any other Chinese restaurant. It was much tastier and had an amazing aroma. The salad was very fresh . This is the first time i had duck rolls and it was juicy n tasted perfect with the plum sauce. We also had shrimps which was tender n tasted more like Japanese. 
Coming to the main course the noodles was extremely saucy n the tastiest iv had till date would give it a 5/5.  The egg fried rice was not bad. The kung pao chicjen n chkn with black pepper was again very dif from what we  get in other restaurants. The meat was tender n juicy n cooked to perfection. 
The macaroons specially the chocolate macaroon was excellent and so was the raspberry icecream. 

I would love to go there again and try all the other items in the menu as i hope each of them would be unique in taste n quality and as good as i had yesterday. 

I would also like to mention our service personnel Mr. Amir who helped us through the menu and served us very well.

This one is bit of a surprise when you hop into the elevator and go all the way to the 5th floor of the Quest Mall. It acquires ample ground and I love the fact that it has some sections differing from one another, including a cute alfresco dining section under no Sun. Lovely decor sets your mood while enjoying the warm humble service of Yauatcha. When it comes to food, we ordered a dim sum meal, including dumplings, fried rice with seafood sides, noodles and desserts. Every item which were put on the plate were amazing. The only thing which draws me back from giving it full marks is the consumption of time in between ordering and serving something. Being a lover of Chinese cuisine I would definitely recommend you gastronome take a visit.

I had ordered for a dumpling,one of the items in the vegetable sections to have with Ho Fan Noodles. 
All three were equally good. I specially liked the Ho Fan Noodles. The presentation as well as the preparation was right up to the mark!

So this is the second yuatcha outlet I have visited after bangalore. The food is consistently good in fact I would say better than its bengaluru counterpart since they were willing to modify the spicy quotient something it's bengaluru counterpart refused to! The staff were very warm and the unique twist to the regular Chinese fare was refreshing. .for all foodies and those tired of the regular high profile haunts ...yauatcha is worth a visit!

On a cloudy Sunday late afternoon we three went to Yauatcha! With Prompt response of the hostess, we settle for a window side with a great panoramic view of park circus stretch. It has well lit, comfortably spaced modern elegant decor. The waiter quickly asked for water type and any pre mentioned allergies, courtesy expected of any fine dining experience. 
Going through long list of food and drinks menu and with generous help of a well informed server, we placed our order.  
We ordered one pot of Earl Grey Tea and ginger ale for drinks. The tea was aromatic, refreshing and a hint of honey was complimenting it. 
The lamb soup had a clear broth with tiny pieces of the lamb. The best part about the soup was the freshness and crunchiness of the vegetables. The duck rolls with oyster sauce was minced duck meats stuffed in a roll. It was small portion, compact,  light - that's what every entrée should be. 
For mains we had chicken fried with XO sauce. Singapore fried noodles and stir fry chicken with szechuan peppercorns. Noodles was served with squid, it was slighty bland for my palette with thin rice noodles. The fried rice was one the best I had. Spot on flavor, moisture and cooking with tender pieces of chicken. The stir fry chicken was too soya saucy, for the lack of Better words. 
Raspberry Delice is the most prettiest dessert I had in Kolkata. Fineness and precision was blended with Raspberry tang, chocolate and vanilla scoops. It was an art in display which we brutally destroyed it seconds! It was treat by one of us and bill was quite a hole in the pocket with too many taxes to cover. But It lived upto it's expectation of Michelin one star restaurant fine dining experience. Keep up the good work.

Food and ambience is  good.. But i must say its overpriced and the quantity of food they provide per portion was too small..  I went to this restaurant with my mom, dad and sister for dinner.. Everything was perfect till we received the check.. It was Rs 23000...  Apart from food we took 5 large peg of scotch... My mom and dad both are poor eater. There is one more thing I would like to mention that the menu was too short.. I expected a bit more variety but the menu was too short.. The bottom line is the price should be lower than it is and the food quantity should be a bit more than they are providing and variety of good food is something that attracts a foodie again and again.. Thats all I had to say.. I hope I am not wrong..

It is perhaps the best food experience I ever had . Every delicacy was too good right from the drinks to the desert . In drinks we ordered ginger and thea Martini , for starters we ordered chicken wrap in pak choi and crispy duck roll , for main course it was chicken fried rice, Red snapper in asam sauce, and stir fried chicken with Szechuan peppercorn . But the best part was desert. It gave a nice ending to our food experience. We ordered choice of macaroon and and religieuse .. The price is on the higher side and the portion are small but the quality made up for the quantity .

We were explained the concept of the restaurant which I hardly explained apart from the fact that it's house special are dimsusms..
Being a true Calcutta Chinese lover that I am I ordered dimsums and sweet corn soup...Coz any Chinese restaurant that I go..it's a must
The dimsums didn't dissapoint , the soup did...not what I had expected..maybe that's the way their soups are...the main courses was ok..what can possibly go wrong with fried rice and chicken..over all ok experience..

Posh restaurants, expensive meals, small quantities are almost synonymous. We did not go there with the hope of being given a mouthful within our "small" budget... But nevertheless expected that what would be served would just blow us away! Sadly, it was very average. The mutton shui mai was quite interesting having a grey wrap and tasted wonderful. So was the pork-and-prawn one. However what came after the starters was quite meagre and average. Egg fried rice and platter of sea food. We weren't full inspite of having one dish each. The only thing exciting for me was my first taste of scallops. That's all.

Yauatcha Kolkata lives up to the Michelin Star reputation that its Restaurant in London carries.

One will be spoilt for choice with the dim sum options available. 

We tried the Edamame, crystal, mushroom & Vegetarian poached Peking dumplings. All of them were fabulous and we couldn't get enough of it. 

The cocktails were equally good; the ginger Martini was my drink of choice.

One of the best places for Fine dining in Kolkata. The staff are well spoken and well versed with everything their extensive menu has to offer.

Definitely a place worth visiting more than once.

Gr8 ambience to start with. This joint provides you a glimpse of the skyline of Kolkata....which is quite refreshing. Coming to the food....it was quite a pleasant deviation from the traditional oriental food.Spicy seafood noodles is must for all who want to titillate their taste buds. The Crispy duck(dim sum) roll will leave you wanting for more. The desserts were worthy of being served on the table for the Royals. Not only the taste but also the presentation of the different items were unique. Even tried my hand at using chopsticks thanks to the training of the very hospitable stewards. Did good with the chopsticks but will do a better job the next time around for sure. 
This place is a must try for all foodies and especially for people into Oriental food.

It's a surprise to most to find such a huge fine dinning restaurant inside a mall. Located on the 5th floor of the Quest Mall, Yauatcha is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've tried in town.

The ambience is super and quite elegant. Their preparations were quite delicious and the service personnel are humble and prompt with the service. Although the rates are towards the higher side, it's absolutely justified to be so with everything that's on offer here. I would definitely recommend this to Chinese cuisine lovers in town.

For a change kolkata can claim its share of fine dining. Minimal decor. Nice view of the kolkata skyline. Remember it's a fine dining... So each serving is for one person. The dim sums r delicate and nicely flavoured. Soups r a bit different.... Not much choice in that section. The staff is courteous and help you choose the food. Main courses are good but can get better. Expect to spend much more time having your meal here cuz they space out your courses as it's suppose to be in a fine dining. Avoid this place if you want quick food and want to share your dishes. The portions r just right for one person. Overall a good place but can get more fancier.

We wanted to try out something 'different' in Chinese for lunch today so we headed for Yauatcha. The ambiance is good, nice view. The decor is simplistic. The service is good, but I found them a little uninformed about what is available at their own restaurant. (Perhaps we got a rookie waiter), however he was very helpful and keen to serve. 

We had a light lunch in mind so we ordered a couple of portions of Prawn Har Gau, this was followed by a main course of Stir Fry Udon Noodles (Veg), Four style vegetables, Spicy Mahlak Chicken, Chicken Noodles accompanied by a Trio of Mocktails (Plum, Passionfruit and Kiwi) and a Gin & Lime (which surprisingly they did not know how to make and I had to give them directions).

The food was good. Especially the Prawn Har Gau was fantastic!. However I found their portions a tad on the smaller side. But I was happy to note that they don't compromise on the quality. 

We were 6 of us and the bill was quite reasonable. I look forward to visiting again and trying more items on their menu.

The ambience and the service is outstanding.
The taste of the food is pure Chinese. Though filled with very sorts of spices yet not hot, sour or spicy. The essence and taste of soya sauce will be realized in every spoon of ur dishes.
Tried chicken and prawn shui mai as starter. It's a combination of boiled chicken nd prawn in a momo like covering. U can say its an advance sort of momo.
Spicy seafood noodles is a lovely main dish. It's a combination of mushroom, prawn, squid nd other seafood nd also enough veggies. Tossed mainly in soya sauce and barista.
Braised chicken as main dish is also nice. Served in claypot. Not much spicy. Lots of capsicum nd juicy sweet and sour mushroom.
The quantity of food is much less. Every dish is ideal for single person. No such complimentary dish.
But as a whole a lovely experience if r wishing to spend ur evening.

The dimsums and cocktails both are very good. The soup and mains shouldn't be order for several reasons- quality, quantity and value for money!
The portions are too small. Rice and noodles portions are not sufficient for one person also and so overpriced! Don't mind payin more money only if the quality is there! Sadly the mains don't even taste good, compared to the dimsums.

The perfect way to celebrate a Father's day when they make it even more special for you at the joint. A very fresh touch to the Kolkata eating out scene. We ordered a hot and sour shredded chicken but it tastes very different from all versions of the same soup I have had at other places. For starters we ordered chicken wrapped in pak choi, chicken char cheung fa and chicken in spicy juices. The pak choi dim sum is so light and just perfect with the spicy sauce on the table. The chicken char is a bit on the sweeter side. We followed it with chicken fried rice in XO. sauce and spicy mahlak chicken. The rice very light with only celery is a refreshing choice after the usual fried rice we are used to in Kolkata. Go for the mahlak chicken if you are really sure about spicy. For dessert, we tried choice of macaroons and religieus. They have an offer of 6, you can pick any 3 macaroons. The other sweet fare was a choux pastry and extremely well done. They even provided us with a laminated picture for our visit. The staff were extremely helpful too. I wish I could definitely visit this place again soon!
And don't forget the Lalu to wash it all down ;)

Nice interiors, decent food - very very poor service. Had to remind the captain and the steward a couple of times before it landed on my table. Food was served cold - looked like it was sitting at the delivery station for long. I requested the food be changed as it was ice cold and was not ready to eat cold ribs. The left over remaining food  was brought back reheated. Fine dining??  Really?? Why??  is it because the Indian consumer will take it and not complain?? Please change your attitude towards giving people the experience while they are in your premise for the experience and not cheap business tactics to cover up the faults. Peace

This is my second visit to yauatcha. The first one long back when they started their operation in Kolkata. I didn't impress much in my first visit, found all items quite average. But after seeing constant positive review in zomato decided to visit it again. But this time they proved why they are Michelin starred restaurant. All the items we ordered are so fresh and delicious. I ordered hot and sour soup with shredded chicken and my wife ordered cocktail Lalu. Both soup and cocktail were very good. In starter  we ordered chicken and prawn shui mai, chicken wrapped in pak choi with Szechuan sauce, crispy prawn cheung fun and sesame prawn toast. I must say all are very tasty out of above 4 crispy prawn cheung fun was devine. In mains we ordered ho fan noodles with chicken and egg & chicken in mahlak sauce. Both are great in taste. In deserts we had raspberry delice which was average but macaroons are good. Overall a very satisfying experience. But one thing I would like to mention this is an expensive restaurant here cost should compare with quality not quantity. The ingredients they used are so fresh may be the reason for their success . Staffs are very polite and attentive. A highly recommended restaurant for Asian food lover. Just go and enjoy.

The summer special offers available at Yauatcha allowed us to finally visit this place. First of all, the decor is fantastic. Its very simplistic and classy. The staff was very nice. We ordered for a "shaken" and two "stirred" combinations. The drinks were good. The food was really good. It was light. We had hofan stir fried noodles and chicken. It was really tasty. The desserts were the best part: Raspberry delices and chocolate hazelnut mousse. The bill came to around 2k. I loved my visit to Yauatcha. :) Next time needs to wait till I save up enough  :P

I did my study of the restaurant menu before I went with my family because I didn't want to feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of ordering the right food for the lunch guests. I also read the reviews. I must confess I was very little impressed by the decor which was minimalistic and the overhyped view of the city was a disappointment. But the food was delicious I ordered the famous chuneg fun, we got the chicken version. We also took the pan fried prawn dumplings. Both were delicious. I was disappointed with the selection of soups. They were too few. We didn't go for any salads. We dived into the main course. We order the much raved about jasmine rice and wild prawn curry. While the curry was a deadly tasteful combination of water chestnut and coconut favour with skillfully cooked soft prawns,the accompanied jasmine rice was quite blah. Yet it teamed up well with the flavourful curry. We chose the spicy seafood noodles and it was a delight in itself not requiring any accompaniment but we had ordered Kung Pao Chicken, this was another revelation from what we are used to which is obviously miles away from the real oriental flavours. I was enthralled by the food.
One confession, after the starters we felt the portions were small but half way through the main course we knew these were sufficient portions. We savoured each bite we had.
We finished the lunch with a tiramisu ,sugar less, very interesting to have. But the second dessert was a capital fail with its bitter chocolate and orange zest combination. The ice cream in both the desserts were full of ice and gave me a brain freeze.
But a Michelin star food joint deserves a trial. I am happy enough with my first experience but I wish to explore more of their menu. In fact I am excited about exploring the other Yauatcha joints in other metro cities. 
I hope the team is not disappointed with the midway rating because the fact is there is a lot to be explored before I am in a better position to rate at a higher level. 
I must mention the set menu combo did not have many choices. I felt raising the price point of the menu may allow for more choices and that is what I would be interested in when going for a quick lunch with friends.
My heartiest thanks to both Firdous and Kaushik for taking such good care of us.

I never thought much about a fine dining restaurant in a shopping mall.I was wrong.
I never thought that a dimsum serving tea house with a different menu can work in a city like Kolkata.I was wrong.
I thought that the taste of authentic Chinese might be alien to the Kolkata Palette.I was wrong.
Yauatcha is all of these and more.
I had a reservation for a table of four and inspire of 15 mins delay they kept it for us.The cool decor and contemporary lighting,the jazzy bar,the beautiful upwardly mobile folks in their Saturday finery,all get you into a happy frame of mind as you are seated by the attentive waiter.
We started with chicken and prawn siu mai,pork and prawn siu mai,crispy prawn cheng fun,prawn salad with mango.There was Chinese beer and green tea.The siu mai's were average,the salad was good and the cheng fun was excellent,a revealation.It was suggested by the waiter.The sauce platter was very good as well.
We followed with a spicy seafood noodle,steamed seabass,and spicy pork belly served with Hong Kong bread like in Peking duck.Here the noodle was excellent,the seabass ordinary and the pork belly the best I have had in a long time,especially with the kind waiter called Saddam doing a good job of preparing the sandwich for us.
We ended with a raspberry delice and jasmine tea cake both of which were excellent.
This was our second visit here and I can see them going from strength to strength.Also their waiters are well trained and polite and so are the manager/stewards hovering around you.We were told during bill presentation that 10 % service charge is included in the bill which showed a candidness missing in many establishments.Keep up the good work folks.

My friend loves this place and I can see why. We ordered these turnip cakes and it just melts in your mouth. The stir fried veggie were also good. I think the best part was the raspberry delice , they have a great combination of mousse raspberry jelly and raspberry ice cream. I liked that they have a separate vegetarian menu which you don't really expect in a Japanese restaurant.

Where should I start. Okay so let's start with 'this restaurant is amazing'. It deserves the Michelin star. They have the most amazing dim sums. You can choose from the steamed, baked or the fried options for dim sum. We tried the chicken wrapped in pak choi with Szechuan sauce, hargau (shrimp) and the vegetable Shanghai dumpling. For main course we had stir fried chicken breast with Szechuan pepper corn in clay pot, Singaporean fried noodle and steamed jasmine rice. We had religieuse ( chocolate choux pastry, dark chocolate cremeaux, hazelnut praline, gianduja ice cream) and raspberry delice. Both the desserts were so delicious. The whole experience at yautcha was amazing. I definitely recommend it.

So finally finally finally I could manage to eat a meal at Yauatcha. My expectations were sky high and I was not disappointed on most account.  We started with Cucumber and lime iced tea - prefect for this scorching summer.  Fresh and not overtly sweet as most mocktails are. It was a good start. I was a tad disappointed that Chicken Char sui bun and Prawn cheng fun were not available so we settled for Chicken and prawn sui mai and Hargau - both class dishes.  Perfectly steamed dimsums,  great on palate. For mains we had steamed jasmine rice with braised chicken with mushroom clay pot. But what blew my mind was the Raspberry Delice;  I had heard so much about it that I had to give it a try . What was served before me was the most beautifully laid dessert. For once I felt bad digging into it! Light chocolate mousse filled with a raspberry jelly on a chocolate disc , served with a fresh icecream.  It was a perfect finish to a great meal. The husband thought the portion size was a little on the meagre side but I give it to Yauatcha being the fine dining restaurant it is. I will be going back here many more times for the desserts and yes the dimsums too. The only thing that bothered us was a stray housefly hovering over us , hope the management will tk care of this.

Yesterday  we had dinner at yauatcha while service was good it was not a very satisfying experience.we had ordered pakchoi chicken dimsums & there were only 3 tiny dimsums  in 1 plate shockingly.  There was just one plate the size of a side plate given I wonder why? The rice the fish stir fry were also average the fish sauce having a strange smell. However  the service was  good  even though it was an overpriced experience.

This place redefines fine dining. Lovely ambience with very humble, polite and attentive staff. The biggest surprise was the fact that they had a separate menu for vegetarians, I was expecting just a couple of vegetarian options on the menu but to have a full menu with vegetarian dishes was mind blowing. The chiu chow dumpling and the cheung fun is a must try. Their cocktails are also brilliant! Try the saffron infused concoction. The Rasberry delice is a must order. Just the way it is presented is a class apart and tastes even better. You might find that you need to dig a little deep in your pockets but its worth every penny.

It was my first time at Yauatcha with family and friends. It was overall a decent experience. The décor is warm and elegant, the staff was courteous. The bar is pretty cool. We had ordered three kind of Dim Sum- pork and prawn shui mai,Lamb roll with black pepper sauce,chicken and prawn Shanghai dumpling. All of these were good especially the pan fried Shanghai dumpling.  The stir fried chicken with Szechuan peppercorn was good but the best one for me was the Spicy seafood noodles which was just delicious. The Braised seafood in Spicy sauce was average and I did not like the taste much. Now coming to the desserts the Chocolate Hazelnut mousse was orgasmic and We had also ordered a seasonal dessert Mango pie with sorbet which was heavenly. We had ordered a classical cocktail Cha la lai and I really liked the taste of the vodka with the sparkling wine and the mild Baron Vert was good too. My only grudge is that compared to the price starting from the Dim Sum to everything we ordered except the drinks the portion served was literally peanuts, we had to order for a hell lot of the aforementioned dishes. So although  I know its in Quest mall and one will expect the charges to be more, but even then  when you compare it to the prices charged it was way more than that expected especially with meagre amount that was served , hence I would request the concerned authority to look into this.

Excellent food fiesta with quick delivery service and attractive prices. Have eaten a couple of times here and loved their dimsums and prawn hargow a lot. Soups and noodles are very good and their chicken dishes too remind you of sitting in some nice Asian restaurant overseas. Private dining experience for ten or more in their secluded room is a good option with personalised service

The stark simplicity of the place strikes you the moment you enter. The staff are extremely courteous,sometimes to the point of being overbearing at times. They know the menu quite well and can guide accordingly.

What we had ordered was chicken char sui bun, pork and praen sui mai,crispy duck roll for dim sum. All of them were excellent. Then for stir fry we ordered indian seabass in black bean sauce, mongolian style lamb and spicy seafood noodles. The spicy seafood noodles was nothing nrw and the other stir fries were good. For dessert, it was the ubiquitous raspberry delice. Along with the food,we had ginger martini, citrus martini and cha la lai.
The dessert is alone enough reason to visit this place. My observation is this is a place for excellent dim sum and dessert but not for mains. As for me, I would go back just for the dim sums and the dessert.

Excellent food and ambiance! But restaurant service staff / waiters needs to be trained on the following. 
- knowledge of the cuisine
- knowledge of the item / dish
- better English and explanation capabilities
- confidence building

At one moment of time was nearly frustrated due to communication failure. Thanks to Mr. Adhikari who salvaged us.

Last sunday we went to dinner at 'Yauatcha'. This London based Michelin star restuarant comes all the way to kolkata with lots of exotic flavours gr8 ambience fine dining...the tables are nicely decorated with ceramic plates and chopsticks....
Now its time to taste some food so we ordered chicken and prawn poached peking dumpling first with cha la lai and ginger martini to start our dinner....the cocktails were nice and the dumpling was just delicious but the thing disappointed me was the quantity of the food because they serve only 3 small pcs in one portion which I think little less for any starter so we decided to order another dumpling so we took lamb roll with black pepper sauce and citrus martini which was mouthwatering .....
In main course we choose ho fan noodles with kung pao chicken and in dessert we took raspberry delice ....the food was perfect taste of the flavour and delicious ....The staff were courteous and we left the place with happy feeling
Overall a nice experience and we would love to visit again specially for the dumplings.....

Located inside the Quest mall, this restaurant is the Kolkata branch of the famed parent restaurant in London.
            I went there for lunch. The décor is modern and elegant (although there is nothing particularly Chinese about it). The service prompt and courteous (although the servers sometimes give the impression that they are parroting lines that they have crammed the night before.)
            Now coming to the food. This restaurants describes itself as a dimsum tea house. So dimsums are their specialty and they have a wide variety of dimsums on offer. The ones that I went for were indeed soft and tasty. The highlight of the meal was the dessert. The raspberry delice was awesome both in its presentation and taste and is indeed worthy of a fine dining restaurant.
           But the one serious complaint I have about this restaurant is that the portions are too small and so most dishes seem way overpriced. One can no way justify serving three small dimsums for about Rs. 300 no matter what the quality. Unless the management takes a serious look into the pricing of dishes, I doubt this restaurant can sustain itself in a city like Kolkata (No Kolkata is not becoming London any time soon).

The best part about yautcha is the distinct Pan Asian delicacy. Far different from the Indianised Chinese that commoners are used to having.  There is always excessive use of spring onions and soya sauce a long with red pepper and red chillies.  The enormous usage of meat and poultry is also something to look forward to. The duck,  lamb and shrimps. Ambience is to die for and pictures turn out to be really amazing. Thank you for bringing in authentic Pan Asian in Kolkata.

First of all, I'd like to say, Yauatcha I am very very very  pleased with you. 
After long nagging from my friends to visit this restaurant, I finally gave it a visit on 3rd May, 2015. 
I, who is not a big fan of dimsums, just loved them. Well, I gave a visit here with my parents. We ordered a plate of steamed and a baked dimsums. They were just awesome. The taste were ecstatic and it would just melt in the mouth. The food quality was just great. After which we ordered the chicken fried rice, Cantonese style noddles with a side dish of spicy chicken and a plate of chilli fried squids. They were just mouth watering. They smelled good, looked better and tasted the best. Well it's not the end, we had no idea what to order for a dessert. So the waiter over there to try the JASMINE TEA CAKE. I'd like to express my gratitude to that waiter because that was the best. 
The sole thing I was dissatisfied about was the time taken to serve these extremely tasty dishes.
And prices being on a higher side, this restaurant is for fine dining with friends and family. But believe me the money you are paying for the food is completely worth it.

P.S.: On my way home I even got myself packed another jasmine tea cake and I took another in the same week. I just love the jasmine tea cake.

The one which made all d ryt noise befor it opened its Gate in the luxury mall of kolkata.went there only to try out their dumpling..was awestuck by the grandeur,which we rarely find in kolkata.after being ushered to our seats next to those big glass windows(i mean BIG) we settled to look thru the menu which surprisingly had good options for us veg diners!I tried out their vegetable shanghai dumpling, sato bean and cashew nut dumpling and their golden fried vegetable puff.The dumplings were exactly the way our server had explained.the sauces were light on the tongue thus letting one enjoy the taste of the dumpling.even the drink(tokyo cooler),an innovative one i must say, deserved a thumbs up!surely coming back again.too many options left to try!
It is pretty pricey but good for the times when youre in a mood to splurge. :) After all it commands the price for being a Michelin starred luxury dining.

Yauatcha, in Quest Mall, is a place I have been wanting to visit for a long time. We had made prior reservations and managed to get a seat by the glass panes, overlooking the hustle and bustle of the street below. The ambience and decor was lovely. Coming to the food itself :

Turnip Cake - The crisp exterior contrasting well with the gooey interior and the crispy bits of garlic and chilli kicked the flavour up a notch. Quite nice.

Crispy Vegetable Cheung Fun - The silky exterior, the crispy interior and the crunchy vegetables in the centre provided a lot of textural contrast, but the flavour was just a tad bland.
Chicken Char Sui Bun - Although the bun was melt-in-the-mouth soft, it was a bit too sweet for my taste.

Chicken Wrapped in Pak Choi - The dainty little chicken balls wrapped in a thin layer of Pak Choi tasted a bit flat on its own, but burst into flavour when combined with the slightly gelatinous, flavour-packed broth.

Vegetable Singapore Fried Noodles - My least favourite of the lot. It lacked any complexity of flavour and the big chunks of soya were insipid.

Kung Pao Chicken - Savoury and delicious, the chicken was served with a lot of onion, bell peppers and cashews. Loved it.

Raspberry Delice - Certainly my favourite of the lot. The velvet sprayed jewellery box of a mousse with the perfect quenelle of rippled ice cream and the intricate chocolate work catches your eye immediately. The bittersweet chocolate mousse is mellowed down by the raspberry ripple ice cream, and the tiny bit of raspberry sauce and the raspberry centre in the mousse helps to cut through all the richness without overpowering in its intensity. The crispy chocolate inserts and the bit of crumb added the much needed textural crunch to the dish.

The condiments were excellent. The pickled vegetables were deliciously fresh and was the perfect palate cleanser between dishes. The chilli sauce and chilli oil helped to add an added dimension of flavour to the dishes.

The service was good and the waiters were helpful in choosing the dishes and courteous in their manners.

Overall, it was a good experience. In hindsight, I could have skipped a couple of dishes, but it is the dessert that will lure me back for a second time.

This place was on my list for a long time but everytime I walked inside quest mall Serafina which is located just opposite to this place would distract me from entering yauatcha, because honestly I love Italian food more. 
On a busy weekend I visited this place with my mother because she loves South East Asian cuisine and honestly she was in for some major gastronomical delight!!
We ordered two drinks : Lychee Martini & Peach Guava Smoothie. 
The Peach Guava smoothie was a little too sweet for my taste but I tasted my mom's drink and it was really nice with interesting flavours. 
For starters we went for a crispy prawn cheung fun & a baked chicken puff. Since I don't eat prawns I can't really comment upon it but my Dim Sum was simply out of this world. I have never tasted something like this especially in Kolkata. We also ordered for Steamed Jasmine Rice, Kung Pao Chicken and almond prawns as main course. 
This restaurant has a very charming appeal, on one side there are huge glass windows overlooking the hustle bustle of the city and the other side is an open area where you can sit with your drink and dim sum for hours and watch people! 
It's definitely a high end restaurant but the service and the food is top notch and hence I have nothing to complain about. 
Awaiting my next visit !

I have been to Yauatcha for three times and every time this was a delightful experience for me. They have a variety of dimsums in which they specialise and each one of them are excellent. The sui mais and cheung funs are really good. They also have a chicken lollypop sort of stuff in their menu with sugarcane sticks. That is really yummy. The egg fried rice and wild prawn curry is awesome as well as their sea bass in black bean sauce. But the red snapper fish in main course is a little bit stinky. Well, this doesn't end here. I have a very queer habit of switching over restaurants at Quest Mall for desserts. For that, Yauatcha is one of my favourite hangouts. The raspberry chocolate mousse delice, chocolate hazelnut mousse, mango mascarpone cheese cake and also, chocolate religieuse are my favourites from the list. I love their macaroons too. They even gifted me a complimentary box of chocolate macaroons on my birthday! Well, this Michelin starred luxury dining is one of the recommended place for tickling your Pan-Asian taste buds in Kolkata. And do not forget, when you visit the restaurant, don't miss out to ask for Mr. Ujjal Adhikary for assistance. He is an expert for helping you out to place your order and enjoy a great meal. Happy dining! :)

First of all congrats Calcutta for scoring your first Michelin star restraunt! The food certainly lives up to its standard. The dim sums are amazing and are certainly the first thing you should try there. A negative though, the portions were quite small, but I guess that's a "thing" in Michelin star restraunts...Now the deserts....to die for! Be it the presentation or the taste, both are impeccable...I had the jasmine tea cake and found that it was very delicate and the tea was perfectly infused in it...and they make their own ice-cream...which was of course amazing... And lastly the macaroons...delicious! The ambience is very sophisticated and classy as well. Overall yautcha has impressed me.

Just two words to describe it perfectly - delicious food. Now Yauatcha is a bit of a pinch in the pocket but it is worth it if your are a continental fan. The dim sums are mouth watering. The tenderloin beef steak was too good. The jumbo prawns felt like it melted in my mouth. And plus, each food is so beautifully decorated that at first you HAVE to click a pic of it. Lol. Everything was superb. Apart from the cost part, it is worth giving it a try!

Loved it - simply did. Beautiful food, lovely ambience and exceptional service. Fist things first - a big thank you for being able to provide non spicy egg noodles for my 3 year old son to have. And he liked it too. Just made it great for me and my wife to have a good time. Special mention on the food front the prawn toast, chicken wrapped in pak choi and Singapore noodles. The fried chilli squid was a bit of a dissapointment for my wife who wanted it spicer. However there is so much more still to explore in the dumpling front. And had no room for desserts. Going back.

By far one of best restaurants for Asian/Oriental cuisine. The food is just fantastic! The appetisers, the main course as well as the teas and the desserts- everything's delicious. Some of my fav dishes would be- the prawn and waterchestnut rolls, the steamed Indian sea bass, the udon noodles, the jasmine tea cake and the raspberry delise (absolutely sinful.) Oh I almost forgot they have a well stocked bar with a pretty good collection of wines. Okay so this place is slightly expensive but the ambiance, the quality, taste and presentation of food; and of course the undeniable feeling of indulgence that you derive everytime you eat here makes it totally worth it.

Celebrated my birthday with friends yesterday and had a wonderful gastronomic experience at Yauatcha. The ambience n set up looks alluring at night.. the daylight makes it equally dull and boring. So prefer visiting for dinner to add to the Michelin experience.
we started our meal with SHREDDED LAMB SOUP WITH CELERY AND MUSHROOM.. was mildly spicy..uniquely tasty..and unanimously appreciated by all..
CHICKEN CHAR SHUI BUN was a fluffy bun with a sweetish stuffing.. i completely loved it.. PAN FRIED CHARCOAL LAMB BUN was delightful.. CRISPY PRAWN CHEUNG FUN was the Mind blower!!
Main courses arrived after a while.. and we gorged on KUNG PAO CHICKEN.. BRAISED CHICKEN AND MUSHROOM CLAYPOT.. SPICY VEGETABLE FRIED RICE.. EGG FRIED RICE WITH LONG BEAN.. and the HOOFAN NOODLES.. all were brilliant.
For desserts we sampled the colourful MACROONS(specially loved the red one) HONEY and HAZLENUT Flavoured ice creams.. the famous and gorgeous RASPBERRY DELICE (yes, i pre ordered it..n its a Must order!! ). My friends gifted me a half kg HAZLENUT MOUSSE Birthday cake from their bakery... And oh heaven! loved everything of them.
the food n service scores full 5/5

however the only negetives are..
first, the portions per plate are very less for the prices..
and the second, they lack the effort make u feel special on occasions like birthday.. many restros now a days have come up with beautiful concepts of celebrating special occasions...like singing or even playing the birthday tune.. or providing a complimentary candlelit dessert or so.. yauatcha lacks it.
third, the high end prices along with a grand taxation on the food bill pinches very hard.
But again, their dimsums and desserts are to die for!

It's just a nice descent restaurant with polite staff around and the manager taking the feedback, yes the menu is quite descent and I loved the table setup. The Michelin star restaurant explains it very nicely that it's not always about the fancy things around to be in the list. The food is just perfect I had tiger prawns with jasmine rice and yes the flavours are just perfect, prawns perfectly cooked with a nice texture, you may not find enough things on the list but whatever you find is gonna be great, the dessert I ordered was jasmine tea cake and yes it's fancy nice and what else it's a good restaurant!

Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and luckily we did not forget to make a reservation which was made just one hour before we entered the place. We were given a corner seat and i was not at all impressed and therefore, did not enjoy the ambiance at all. I would have loved the whole experience a whole lot better if we were given a table near the glass panes. Now coming to the food we ordered poached peiking dumpling and chicken char sui cheung fun as appetizers and both were absolutely delicious. One downsize about this very sui mai dish is that it contains only 3 pieces which got over in just a second that made me real sad. It was the first time that i tried something like cheung fun and i absolutely loved it as the item just melted in mouth and it was not spicy but perfect for my taste bud. The restaurant staffs were excellent in their behaviour and gave us bang on suggestions regarding the main course so listening to him we ordered spicy seafood noodles and steamed red snapper in asam sauce. The noodles contained good amount of prawn scallops squids etc and was not very spicy but very yummy and the side dish was well cooked and good in taste but personally i do not prefer the tangy flavour so much and that is why i would not try it again. For desserts we took chocolate hazelnut mousse which had an excellent presentation and tasted equally good. In drinks we ordered kiwi ice tea which was really fresh and well prepared. Overall i had a great time and the bill amount was around rs. 3200 would definitely visit it again.

The fifth floor of the luxurious Quest Mall welcomes yet another flavour pit stop on the gastronomic race course with Yauatcha. Patrons are in for an exotic experience of a typically Cantonese tea house; and when a London based Michelin Star restaurant comes all the way to the City of Joy, be rest assured nothing can ever go wrong. 
One is pleasantly surprised on seeing a dedicated 50 outdoor seating complete with an open air alfresco bar and kitchen with an additional 100 seater enclosed dining space. The tables are neatly decorated with amoeba shaped ceramic plates and rosewood chopsticks. If you are one of those who are clueless about using a chopstick in the first place, let that not hinder you're eating experience at all as first timers are assured a free chopstick usage lesson. 
The menu boasts around 51 varieties of Dumplings and Dimsums that are reasonably easy on the pocket and are served in a Cantonese portions of three per plate for the number four symbolises death in the Chinese customs. With four different menus, come prepared on being spoilt for choice. Vegetarians in the city have a special Jain menu they could totally indulge on. Start off with their exquisite cocktail of Litchi juice served with a dash of tobacco sauce. Being primarily a tea house, Yautacha patrons can indulge in over 21 different varieties of teas that are imported straight from China and London. Coming to the Dimsums; do try Wrapped Chicken in Pak Choi that not only looks too adorable to eat but its melt in the mouth flavours engulf so seamlessly on your pallet that you simply cannot resist one more. Vegetarians could opt for the Crystal Dumpling that comprises an exotic stuffing of vegetables and dead mushroom fungi wrapped in a potato starch flour giving that transparent appearance. The flavours are orgasmic and the vegetables still crispy and succulent on every bite. If seafood is more your liking, go for the Chicken wrapped Prawn Dimsums with Chilli Soya condiment. The Cantonese menu too boasts about varied varieties of rice, noodles and side dishes. If you're a budget friendly individual, you could always opt for their set meal menus that are reasonably priced at Rs 898 for vegetarians and Rs 998 for the non-vegetarians. 
Since Desserts are to die for at Yautacha DO NOT MISS their three show stoppers- The Jasmine Tea cake, the varied flavoured Macaroons and the Raspberry Delice, i.e a Raspberry Dark Chocolate with Raspberry insert and Hazelnut Brownie served with Raspberry ripple ice-cream. 
All in all perfection has one name :)

I haven't ever been to another Michelin-starred restaurant. Therefore, I really do not have a standard of judgement in that area.
However, what I expected from this place was less than what I really got.
The prices are in range with other high-end fine dining places, the catch being the quantity which is way too less.
We ordered Ginger Martini, Beer, Chicken dimsum with black pepper wrapped in lotus leaf and butterpaper, chicken and prawn poached peking dumplings, mahlak stir-fry, egg fried rice and raspberry delice.
Although the raspberry delice was beautiful to look at, it was the peking dumplings or rather the soup they were floating in, which brought back my belief in Oriental Cuisine which I felt rather degraded in our lovely city over the years.
The taste was simply DIVINE. The whole dinner cost us around 3.5K and while the starters came in tiny quantities, the main course was filling, the staff were courteous and we left the place with a happy feeling.
Would love to go many more times (when the pockets are full of course).

Went to lunch at yauatcha a few days ago and the experience was way below the standard I was expecting (my earlier experience was far better than the current one). 

We ordered a veg dim sum platter that consisted of 5 puny dim sum, which on the outside looked colourful and intriguing but on the inside I couldn't tell any of them apart! 

We asked for yellow egg noodles (Hakka style) and were given a plate of yellow coloured rice noodles that seemed to have been spiced with garam masala ! 

The Kung pao chicken was ...for the lack of a better word ...meh... It was made with incorrect ingredients which just destroyed the dish completely. They substituted cashews in place of peanuts and tossed in red and green peppers...(why?!) 

We asked the waiter if he could put in a request with the chef for some sweet and sour prawns (because I couldn't decipher the bloody gibberish on the menu), to which the waiter said that the menu is set and no requests for making any dishes differently will be entertained! ...bummer! So we ordered some 'pumpkin-prawns' which was more like prawn pakoras! 

Thankfully we had a movie to catch so we paid the bill quickly and got out! 

But the story doesn't end there entirely ...I received a call 2 days ago from yauatcha enquiring about my experience. Somewhere in the midst of my relaying my experience, the lady who called just hung up. 

I'm not sure if I would like to go back there anytime soon. The service might be courteous but apart from that the quality of food is getting more terrible. Everything is over-salted and oily. Even their soups come with a layer of oil on them!!!

If you decide to pay a visit to yauatcha let me warn u they dnt serve dat typical indian chinese dat you get in the other restaurants! The food there is different and yes unique in its own way! Only 1 thing that disappointed me is the quantity of the food! The portions served ws vry less so we had to order for double dan we normally do! And that double quantity was actually normal! The food is really tasty! And the desserts.. Yummmm.. The mousse, the sorbet~ perfect taste of the flavours! The decor is simple yet appealing.. And their tea is very refreshing!!

Being Dim sum tea house, Yauatcha has an extremely high focus on its selection of teas. The most famous and tasty Tea and Signature Cocktails are Lalu and Cha la Lai. My personal favourites among the Non-Alcoholic cocktails are Tokyo cooler and Nara Iced Tea. I believe this is one of the best and proper classy chinese Restaurants in Kolkata ... With a result of Cantonese cooking with a contemporary flair. Some of the specialities are French Beans withShitake Mushrooms, Truffle Edamame Dumplimgs, Stir Fry udon noodle in Black Pepper sauce, Crispy Aromatic Duck, Kung Pao Chicken Vegetable Crystal Dumpling, Four Style Vegetables in Schezuan Sauce and Chocolate mandarin Tart.
My opinion people who are classy and very fussy and choosy about food must try out Dinner here sometime
... Not even so expensive but great proper Chinese Food.

Set menu for 850 is worth your money ! As there were three of us we could sample all there was to offer across three different  set menus. The food is good and different from the ' run of the mill' Chinese.  This restaurant in Quest Mall is definitely worth a visit.  Ambience and service score 4/5. What needs improvement is the diction of the waiters. Hindi or Bengali is preferable to incomprehensible English!

True gourmet place, awesome food, ambience and service. I went with a friend today for dinner. We had dimsum of crisp prawn (highlight dish), spicy wild prawn curry and egg fried rice. Food was perfectly balanced with different flavours coming through. Dessert was a chocolate dish. Loved it. Overall had a fab dining experience

I literally got sciatica while writing this review because the dichotomy I faced  was extraordinary. Just to give you a perspective it was as difficult as learning it's name and pronunciation.

The original Yautcha in London is a Michelin star restaurant so of course it's congeners bear the great mantle of carrying out the same perfection even if it is in an almost manner. The décor is minimalistic with no special comments. But the menu is highly restricted for a vegetarian (so everything worth trying can be done in two visits) but the pricing is quite appropriate seeing its lineage. Though I don't like to advert on isolated dishes but it will be a grave mistake if you don't try Ho Fan noodles and it's desserts. But it's a shame that the other noodles couldn't yield the same expectation by even closest measure. The dumplings are good with picture perfect presentation but taste wise bear wobbly prospects. 

The staff members are amicable, knowledgeable and quite professional. For a memorable first experience do make a prior reservation proximal to the window. Its a great choice for 2-4 people who would like to give their linguae a novel experience. To be truthful, my first two experiences were worth 5 stars but the deception of the subsequent visit have placed a permanent barricades for my future visits.

“Blah Food - Insipid Drink - Michelin Prices”

Ordered the following:-

Starters: 1) Turnip cake = Tofu 'Pakodas'
2) Duck roll - Good
3) mushroom rolled in rice - Nice but too overpowered by Soya Sauce. 
Mocktail: Too much ice . Felt flat . Did not like.

Main Course: Spicy Fried Rice with Vegetarian Chicken - OK

Finally - Did not suit my Indian taste buds. At these prices I would have had a better time at Mainland China.

We were a party of 3 for dinner. Given that the London outlet was Michelin-starred, I came with high expectations, most of which were met. 
For starters, we ordered two dimsum- the charcoal lamb and the black pepper duck, and crumb fried chilli squid. The crumb fry was absolutely fantastic, seasoned to perfection. With the right sauce, the mix of heat and sweetness was spot on. I preferred the lamb dimsum, as the duck was a little too fried for my liking (almost like a samosa), and it takes several dry bites before you actually reach the filling.  
For main courses, we had the ho fan noodles and egg fried rice with the sides being steamed Indian sea bass in black bean sauce, the mahlak chicken, and the Mongolian style lamb. Did not care much for the fish myself, but that is most likely my own dislike of black bean sauce, and the others quite liked it. The lamb and chicken were both great, though the chicken was my personal favourite. 
Desserts were really what blew me away. We ordered the Jasmine Tea Cake and the Raspberry Delice. You could actually taste the tea flavour distinctly in the former, and the latter is easily the best looking dessert I have ever seen (It looked so beautiful I hesitated to even cut into it!). Taste wise, both were spectacular, and what I particularly liked about the Raspberry Delice was that even with all the chocolate, the taste of raspberry remained the dominant theme of the dish. Would come back here just to try more of their desserts.
In Kolkata, where Oriental food has ended up tasting the same pretty much everywhere, Yauatcha is not just a fancy Michelin-star brand, but really brings some distinct flavours of this cuisine to the city.

Lets start from the beginning....The place....top floor quest mall...crisply decorated i would call it...with some of the seating arrangements having a view of the outside world....great staff i would say...the uniqueness is that a lady at the entry always introduces you with a staff who will attending your table....not for once did i had to find for a person to meet my requirements...someone was always there to attend...5 on 5 for service.....Now the food....this place is what you call a authentic Chinese lovers den...We had three types of Dim sum...Lamb roll with black bean sauce (steamed)....it had a great taste....lamb was nicely minced with a wrapping....well prepared...excellent...next..Wrapped chicken with black pepper (pan fried).....i would say good taste...nothing out of the world...similar to what you would find at some other places...and lastly Crispy Duck Roll (Pan Fried)....very crispy...sweet and tangy in nature....liked it very much...again excellent....Now the main course...Spicy veg fried rice.....again very good taste...but portion was very less.....was craving for more....this we had with my favorite...Mongolian style Lamb.....just awsum....out of the world preparation...must try everyone..tender pieces of lamb which melts in your month...a bit on the spicy side...though i like spicy. Also had Stir fry Udon Noodles....kind of wheat noodles...very thick and it had a smoky flavor...did not like it much as it was too smoky for my taste buds....did not have desserts as was too full by then....overall apart from one or too dishes rest of them were excellent...great service...nice interiors...would surely recommend.. Surely revisit if i get an opportunity..
Pocket Pinch: Rs 5000 for 2....(a bit over priced, drinks are costly and too many taxes and charges)....

Heard a lotttt about this Michelin starred restaurant in Quest Mall, but turned out miraculously disappointing. For one evening I was ready to shell out much more than what I normally do. But it was pretty much a bad experience. They had a fixed platter option for the Chinese new year. So 4 of us ordered that, and rest decided to go for the normal ala carte. Soup seemed decent. The crispy lamb was so average. I don't know why would I have it here rather than a normal cheaper restaurant. The dimsums were actually different and pretty good. We had prawn dimsum. Poached peking dimsum was phenomenal. They r their speciality. But you can't run a restaurant based on just 1 item. Rice quality could have been better. My uncle has a fascination for good rice and he knows it more than anyone i know. He was extremely disappointed with the quality of rice being served.
Food more or less was OK. But the service was really poor. I guess the guy was new. But that can't be a reason to make so many blunders in one table. My uncle is a vegetarian. They served him non veg soup and by mistake served the vegetarian soup to my aunty. Now the funny story is.. When my uncle complained about the soup being served wrong, they simply took the soup from aunty which she had already started having and have it to uncle, and vice versa. They should have immediately changed the soup and given a fresh one. But unfortunately that did not happen. Yes, disgusting approach!!
He asked for a bottle of wine.. They gave him a glass of it. Careless silly mistakes in handling customers!!
The dessert.. Macarons with a chocolate cupcake.. I assumed, and the waiter also confirmed.. The cupcake was like a molten lava cake with chocolate oozing out of the cake as soon as I take a bite.. Well it had solidified.. The cake was overcooked and tasted bitter. The macarons were too sweet that I could not even complete one.
I can name 10 restaurants right now which would serve much better tasting food than Yauatcha and also cost you lot lesser than here. Then why should I visit Yauatcha? Only to have dimsums? Well apparently they want me to do the same, as I understand from their food. Nothing else is actually worth it!

You cant just decorate a place like a classy restaurant and serve average food. You should maintain the food quality also. 4000 for 2 people, and so much disappointment! Not coming back here unless they have a dimsum festival!

'Yauatcha' is located on the 5th floor of Quest Mall.I've visited this restaurant today with my family.First of all the ambiance of this restaurant is very good & well decorated.Waiters are well behaved & helpful.We ordered Wrapped Chicken with Black pepper as a starter,I don't like it.Then,In the main course we ordered Steamed Jasmine Rice,Vegetable Fried Rice,Chicken Fried Rice with XO Sauce & Kung Pao chicken.Chicken Fried Rice is light,it tastes good.Kung Pao chicken is also tasty but it has no gravy.In the dessert I ordered Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse.It serves dark chocolate with vanilla ice-cream.This tastes little bitter.Price is extremely high than their food quality.Their food quantity is less.Food service is also late.

Yautcha in mumbai is one my favorite resturants and hence wanted to try it out in Kolkata too. The food , service, ambience are excellent. 
Do try this cocktail called lalu.. Highly reccomend it  . For starters we ordered char Sui chicken bun and baked chicken pepper . Both were outstanding. The char Sui bun is slightly sweetish..but yummy. Main course was egg fried rice, Uday noodle and stir fried chicken in schezwan sauce, needless to say it was very tasty. Did not try out their dessert as were too full by then. Will save it for the next visit:-)

First and foremost this is not a Chinese restaurant

The food is very different from the regular joints in city

It's a pleasure to sit outside the enclosed portion and enjoy your meal, it's Al fresco indoors ☺

Somehow I never seem to save space for the mains as I overload myself with the starters 

The various dim sums (steamed/fried/baked) all are just too good

The drinks menu is also worth taking a look at as most of the mock tails we tried were very nice and refreshing 

My main course usually comprises of Mabo tofu and steamed rice but the udon noodles and the French beans sides are also delish 

Zomato is full of reviews for the deserts so I have nothing to add to it

All in all this restaurant can be best enjoyed with friends and family (groups of 5 and more) so that you could sample all the starters on the menu

What better way to spend Valentine's day than to be in the company of the most special person in your life while also celebrating good food. The day began with a movie date, Roy, which was to be honest rather Kafkaesque. However that disappointment was easily forgotten thanks to some wonderful food from Yauatcha.  

The restaurant, present on the 5th floor of Quest Mall, has a modern sleek look. Seating arrangements are present both indoors as well as outdoors and decor is, for lack of a better word, chic. Because it was the 14th of February, the place was perhaps more crowded than usual with all the love birds gathering in numbers. We were given a seat on the outside arena. That perhaps was the only disappointment to an otherwise perfect lunch. 
We ordered
 1. Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun - The starter was easily the winner of the day. The soft outer layer combined with the crispy inner layer filled with succulent prawn was heavenly.
 2. Ho Fan Noodles - Nice and tasty. Given in good quantity with a lot of veggies. Decent. 
3. Braised chicken - Brilliantly done, served in a clay pot with mushrooms and corn. The taste was slightly bland compared to their lofted standards but combined well with the noodles.
 4. Raspberry Delice - Signature dessert of Yauatcha and bears testimony as to why their London based outlet is Michelin starred. The presentation was great and it somehow managed to taste better. Recommended.  

Looking forward to the next excuse to visit this place again. :)

A perfect Michelin Star experience! *_*
Located on the fifth floor of Quest Star, it certainly isn't a place for everyone i.e for people who are accustomed to have simple stereo-type Chinese cuisine! The whole three course meal takes you through a journey which defines authenticity of Chinese cuisine! Extremely courteous stuff, wonderful interior decoration and ambience are the two positives of this restaurant. The fried rice is completely different from the fried rice, served at any other Chinese restaurant of Kolkata which is quite evident from the picture i provided on Zomato and it's served traditionally on a Chinese bowl and you have to eat on a Chinese bowl, not a plate. Singapore Rice Noodles, Wild Prawn Curry , Kung Pao Chicken and Stir-fry Chicken with Szechuan Peppercorn were just fabulous! And the Chicken & Prawn Suimai as a starter was the best suimai i have, ever had...and it's a tough competitor with the suimai of Mainland China! And Raspberry Delice, as a dessert was a treat to have. Everything is perfect here, except the quantity of the staples i.e fried rice or noodles and this is the only reason why i am not giving it a 5 star rating. Quantity of side dishes are quite ok though. And it's quite high on the pocket, but it's worth it.
All in all, a complete thumps up!!

Unparalled in quality Chinese offering this place spells class. Did try some of the dishes which were served in personal portions was awesome. All the items was delicately crafted to perfection by artists, which will surely impress the host and the guests alike. Special mention to be made of the different and exotic herbs they use in the preparations makes the taste stand apart. Did like the famed raspberry delice also which was not overly sweet. One should select the dishes carefully depending upon the taste/ preferences and moods as the dishes are too costly to be discarded-- Bon Appetite.

To be fair, Yauatcha is not for someone who is used to normal Chinese fare, but the other day, I had an epic meal there, which consisted of the following - 
1. Ginger Martini - sweet, with a kick from the vodka and ginger.
2. Hot and Sour Soup - filled with chicken, tofu and cloud ear fungus. Yum. 
3. Peking dumpling - unusual. silky smooth dumpling skin with pork and prawn. There is a broth of soy and mint which is quite unusual. 
4. Har Gao - plump, juicy prawns stuffed inside thin skinned dumplings. 
5. Lamb Rolls - Nice, but could have skipped it - the meat filling was slightly dense, for the lack of a better word.
6. Almond Prawns - reminded me of thread prawns. In a good way. 
7. Lalu - a strong alcoholic lemongrass flavored concoction with the kick of a mule. 
8. Hakka - with real passionfruit instead of processed puree. Also, there was coconut cream. 
9. Pork ribs - They apparently import their pork from Belgium. They were tender but held their own - PERFECT.
10. Beef stir fry - with black bean and oyster sauce and a touch of Hoisin. Very tasty and was great on its own. 
11. Chicken Noodles - reminded me of Char Kway Teoh for some reason. Nice! 
12. Fried rice - Okay-ish. Not my favorite thing on the menu. 
13. White Sangria - refreshing, fruity and extremely potent. 
14. Raspberry Delice - tart, with a bittersweet chocolate bottom and a jellied raspberry heart. Served with a raspberry swirl ice cream and some biscuit crumbs. Easily one of my favorite desserts in town. 

Despite my attempt to make this post short, it can't be, for the sheer number of things I ate. I have to say, this place makes very good pork. I will have to come back for that, and the Lalu. And okay, also the Almond Prawns and Beef and Peking dumplings and Raspberry Delice. Service was polite and attentive, and the window side seat got me a great view.

From all the raving reviews of thr place, it has got to be a smashing place to dine.
For me,I did only went for the desserts here which obviously is the talk everyehere and rightly so.
They were amazingly good. I had thr Raspberry Delice which seems to be the top dessert here. The chocolate Hazelnut Mousse too was off the hook.

2nd Visit Review:

So after a long gap finally went here for a full meal and must say I wasn't totally joyous. I tried various things which turned out to be rather average 

What I had:

:Chicken & Prawn Shui Mai - pretty decent. Ut unhappy with the portions and lack of dipping sauce

:Lobster - pathetic

:Fried Turnip Cake - good stuff better presentation

:Spicy Fried Rice - really good.

:Udon Noodle - again very well made

:Spicy Chicken Mahlak (Star Dish) - lovely. An experiment that paid off. I could eat the entire dish with wither the rice or noodle. 

:Jasmine Tea Cake : the honey ince cream was more inviting to me in this dessert.

:Chicken Soup Dumplings -they are the best.

The service was a bit lethargic and all over the food was little below expectations and obviously really expensive. But hopefully it won't disappoint again.

Enjoyed but I still find the Chinese dishes better at Red Hot Chilli Pepper or Mainland. Tried some spicy fried rice, it was ok. Also tried some side dish made of soya mix ( veg chicken) that was good. Surprisingly they didn't serve Chinese or jasmine tea which is normally complimentary at best of places. Their service was also sort of erratic.

I was ecstatic when I heard that the famed Michelin Starred Yauatcha was finally opening its doors in Kolkata and started counting the days to the opening with bated breath. My first visit was in October, so the first part of this review is rather delayed. The first word that comes to mind when one walks into Yauatcha, is sophistication. The décor is elegant and the overall ambience is very upscale.

 

On the first visit we started with Jasmine Green Tea, which was quite pleasant and served as a palate cleanser in between mouthfuls. For starters we had the Chicken and Prawn Shui Mai, which was sumptuous and so good that we ordered seconds. The way the flavors of the chicken and prawn had come together was just magical and every bite was delightful. The main course consisted of Vegetable Singapore Fried Noodles, Spicy Seafood Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken and Stir-Fry Tenderloin in Black Pepper Sauce. The vegetable noodle was vermicelli noodle with “mock meat” and very enjoyable. The Spicy Seafood Noodle was lip smacking and simply delicious. It had bits of squid and scallops in it, which we were trying for the first time, but it tasted heavenly and I personally would recommend it to all seafood lovers. The Kung Pao Chicken was amazing! It was garnished with cashews, which greatly enhanced the taste of the chicken when eaten with it. The Tenderloin was superb and was just melting in our mouths. We didn’t have dessert because the raspberry delice was unavailable.

 

My second visit was on New Year’s Eve. There was a special NYE menu for food and drinks. I started with the Hot and Sour Soup With Shredded Chicken, which was the perfectly balanced between hot and sour and was delicious. Next I had the Chicken Charsui Bun which is a soft sweet bun filled with slightly spicy chicken. The sweetness of the bun and the spiciness of the chicken complimented each other and had a pleasing effect. I had a portion of Chicken and prawn shui mai, which was even better than the last time! Then I had the Veggetable Shanghai Dumpling, which was pleasant. For the stir-fry I chose the Steamed Red Snapper in Asam sauce and the Kung Pao Chicken. The snapper was excellent and had a tangy touch to it, which I really liked. The Kung Pao Chicken was as fabulous as last time. For the staple/main I chose Singapore Fried Noodle. This contained squid and prawn and was exquisite. For my dessert I chose the famous Raspberry Delice. The thing looked like a work of art and one look at it made me realize why it’s the most Instagrammed Dessert. It looked and tasted extraordinary, and it was a fitting finish to the lovely meal I had.

 

The service is excellent and the staff, very helpful. They patiently answered all my queries about the food. I

Yauatcha has been a place I had been excited to visit since I got to know about it. It's Michelin starred heritage made for a nice mood to visit the place, and clearly, Yauatcha didn't disappoint. 

I have visited the place almost once every week over the past month and I absolutely believe that I should have visited more often. 

The food is very well cooked and exquisitely seasoned and presented. The quantity may become an issue for those preferring larger meals. The taste is however impeccable. For those on a budget, I suggest you visit the place during the week for lunches as the prie fixe menu is good and serves well for one person. If you wish to indulge, go for the Chicken and Prawn Shui Mai, Chicken Char Sui Bun if you prefer sweet dimsum or the Chicken wrapped in pak choi with Szechuan sauce if you prefer a light dimsum course. Do not forget to have the Fujian Blue Roasted Tea here to go along with the dimsums. For the mains, go for Kung Pao Chicken with Chicken fried rice in XO Sauce. The desserts are all exquisitely made and presented so suggestion would go to the Raspberry Delice. Don't forget to pick up a box of Macarons on your way home.

The staff is polite and the ambience is pretty cosy. Bit pricey but you wouldn't be disappointed if you remember its lineage.

I was jumping with joy when the famed Yauatcha finally opened their doors in the city (being a major fan of their first Bombay BKC outlet) and let's say they did not disappoint. I have already visiting them a couple of times but writing this review for the most recent one which was for the first dinner of this year.
This place is best to go bonkers on the dimsums. Being quite the greedy pigs, we ordered Vegetable Crystal dumpling, prawn and water chestnut rolls, chicken wrapped in pak choi  with szechwan sauce, shitake mushroom dumpling, indian sea bass mooli roll, crystal luffa melon dumplings, 3 style mushroom cheung fun and crispy veggies cheung fun (Phew!!!!). And all of them were excellent and highly recommended.
For main course - The steamed indian sea bass with spicy black bean sauce with steamed jasmine rice is a must try but given a choice, I'd just hog on dimsums.
They have recently introduced their alcohol menu and their martinis are yummy and extremely well mixed.
Never really tried the desserts over here because by the time we get there, we are stuffed.
Service is excellent and try and get a table inside with a view of limited sky line that the city has to offer.

Yauatcha located inside quest mall is Chinese delicasy packaged in classy decor.
we went there for a birthday celebration with prior booking and two confirmation call from them. But there wasn't anything special for my spouse birthday. Anyways the arrangement is outside as well inside. Do insist seating inside if you don't mind spending a lot for a food court type seating feel.
The decor inside is classy and charming with chandelier and wooden table used. You can see the busy road outside from the glass. The stuffs are trained but you may feel odd with understanding of English with probably staffs who are non-indian . They are good and coming to the food its sheer class.
we started with Dimsums , its exequsite ,then fried duck rolls,continue with fried chili squid (squid was very crispy as well soft)stir-fried penang noodles(it was one of the best noodles tasted in kolkata) ,then the signature raspberry delice and flavoured macarons to satisfy your sweet tooth.
The food quality was awesome, servings was apt for one dish for two persons .
All in all terrific Chinese experience with awesome food is yauatcha's signature; don't mind bit extra pocket pinch ,considering the Michelen star rating. Go enjoy.

Ballygunge’s Yauatcha is all set to serve something different with their whopping list of teas, noodles and other yummy items. If you have an inclination to try out something different from your regular food items come to this place which is popular for its various healthy teas such as green tea, blue tea, black tea etc. Well you may ask what is the difference between the green tea you make at home and the tea served at the restaurant, the answer lies you will find in the restaurant itself. Apart from that you will find Indian teas like Assam summer tips, organic first flush Darjeeling, Kashmiri Kahwa etc. And when it comes to their dumplings the restaurant is simply unbeatable. Take their vegetarian poached Peking dumpling or vegetable chive dumpling or vegetable chiu chow dumpling, all are simply mouth-watering. The restaurant truly masters in Chinese traditional khana and thus introducing Bengalis with Chinese delicacies. Among their other items my personal favourite is crispy duck roll, almond prawns and crispy lamb. The spices of these dishes mix with the meat pieces very well. The restaurant is also championing in sea foods like fried chili squid, wok fried lobster, spicy wild prawn curry, etc. With that there are rice, noodles, deserts items. Surely here you get something which you may not get somewhere else.

Two times in a span of a week after clearly mentioning during our reservation to give us seats inside the resturant, on reaching the venue we were offered seating outside. Surprising on creating a ruckus they were wiling to accommodate. What a way to kill a brand ... 

Reservations managed by Mumbai and seating decided by kolkata, it's a joke. Better to enjoy the resturant anywhere but in Kolkata

Yauatcha is one of the elite group of restaurants that has come up in Quest Mall, and has been enjoying a healthy word-of-mouth publicity. The three of us went there for lunch earlier this week. Seeing the rush all around, I was wondering whether we would have to wait for a considerable amount of time standing in the queue, but, surprisingly, it was quite empty inside (although, by the time we were done, almost all the tables were full).

The interior has a very sleek feeling, and we got one of the tables adjacent to the window - the last one in the row. For starters, we went for chicken and prawn shui mai, and chicken and prawn Shanghai dumpling, which arrived after a considerable wait, and didn't seem quite upto the mark. Main course was much more satisfying - egg fried rice, seafood noodles, spicy prawn curry, and Kung Pao chicken. For anyone planning to visit, the seafood noodles is highly recommended. In fact, this is one of the very few places where the main course was more fulfilling than the starters.

The service here, however, leaves something to be desired. The waiters seemed to be having a tough time even with the place at half capacity. The prices are also on the higher side, and neither the quality, nor the ambience, justifies the pricing.

In short, you can go if the brand mane appeals to you, but if quality Chinese food is what you desire, I am sure there are better options.

Having now eaten in Yuaatcha a few times now, this is now time for a dispassionate appraisal ! In terms of repertoire and culinary excellence, it certainly is a superior experience, especially compared to the levels that Chinese outlets have sadly descended to in Kolkata! It's newly introduced cocktails in the recently opened Bar definitely adds a zing to the dining experience ( try the Thea Martini & the Lychee Martini) !

Having said that, is it a Michelin Star experience? Ummm, perhaps not quite yet! Michelin Star dining is a serious and discerning affair, and, normally just has that 'something extra'! Also, the fact that such an outlet would choose to be in a Mall ( albeit a 'luxury' one), in my mind, takes away from the experience!!!

We went to quest mall on 25th December and planned to try Chillis but due to huge rush we changed our mind and thought to try out with this one. The first thing I did not like about it is the open seating environment although they have a big hall to accomodate the customers but they kept it only for the reservations which even after repeated request was not changed.

We ordered hot and sour chicken soup although the taste was good but I did not understand the reason for the overpricing. For starter we went for steamed spicy chicken and for maincourse we had udon noodles with tofu in Hakka style and dry chilly lamb. Taste wise I am not complaining at all but quantity wise all the dishes are too overpriced. I am not sure how this cost is justified, is it just because of the place or something else. I simply cannot recommend this because with similar or better taste same dishes will be available in many more places in Kolkata.

Super food. Pretty lousy service. Enjoyed all the things we normally eat at the Bangalore outlet. Loved all the cheung funs and dim sum. The soups were awesome too. The service was bad though. Our drink didn't show up. One cheung fun didn't show up after an hour of waiting. We had to repeatedly ask for napkins. Things were just out of whack. We had to cancel some of our order cos we got tired of waiting.

Firstly this is a slightly delayed review.Yauatcha was the venue for our foodie group's Diwali meet.We were all extremely excited about this meet at such a reputed place and on such an auspicious occasion.Our expectations were understandably extremely high but our overall experience was unfortunately a mixed one.

Firstly I was rather disappointed that we were made to sit in the corridors outside the restaurant proper.The interiors seemed very classy.The seating arrangement outside was decent but much more casual.The specially designed tables and the signature amoeba shaped plates contributed to the charm and special feel.But I would have preferred a seat inside.

Coming to the food,we were fortunate enough to get a taste of a number of their delicacies.I started off with a Lime and Kiwi Iced tea.It was a wonderfully refreshing drink to start off my meal.The dimsums followed.I had the pork and prawn sui mai.It was quite brilliant.The pork and prawn inside was soft and it retained the original taste. The unique thing about their dimsums is that the coating was almost paper thin.It was the thinnest coating I have ever seen and I loved it.Then came the soups.I tasted both the Hot and Sour and the sweet corn soup.While the hot and sour soup was about decent,the sweet corn soup was pretty disappointing.

A complimentary Turnip cake was up next and it was surprisingly the one dish which was more like the quality we expected.The soft turnip inside and the crunchy crisp exterior paired with the delicious kashmiri chili made for an absolute treat.It was the one dish that all of us unanimously enjoyed.

These were followed by the main course for which we had egg fried rice and singapore noodles.The egg fried rice was again average.I liked the fact that they used duck eggs though.The Singapore noodles cooked with sesame seeds was also an average fare but it tasted better with the kashmiri chili.We also had stir fried veggies with lotus stem,asparagus with french beans and a complimentary okra dish.All these three veg items were pretty poor.The okra dish was so bad that we wished we didnt have it at all.Then came the Braised Tofu Clay pot.It was another dish that I really enjoyed.I loved the texture of the dish and the smokiness to it.The Non braised tofu was no way near as good.
For the non veg main course we had a Chicken peppercorn and Kung pao chicken.The kung pao chicken was pretty nice although not exceptional.The chicken peppercorn was not at all great.On the whole the main course left us quite disappointed apart from the braised tofu clay pot.

Up next were the desserts and this is where Yauatcha scored big according to me.The Chocolate hazel nut mousse with ice cream was sinfully brilliant.The Red Velvet cake was also an absolute delight.The macaroons were also pretty nice.I really liked the jasmine and blueberry flavoured ones.But the fact that quite a few of the flavours we wanted were not available or in limited quantities only was rather disappointing.

Now the service.This is one area where Yauatcha was a huge let down.They were aware of the visit from our group and the menu we were to have a long time back.But they were totally unprepared.The service was slow.They forgot what all we wanted.They ended up serving us the wrong stuff.That I had

On a special day in my life I decided to visit the most buzzing Chinese restaurant in town. Did reservation prior and received calls back from hotel couple of times as confirmation. Ambiance is top notch how it should be in case of fine dining.
To start with dim sums and rolls we ordered Chicken wrapped in Pak choi with Szechuan sauce, Pork and Prawn Shui mai and Crispy Duck Roll. They are all stuffed heavily with meat and every item tasted fresh and different from each other. They only provide 3-4 pieces per portion.
In main course we ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian style Lamb, Chicken Fried Rice with XO sauce and Veg Stir Fry Udon Noodles. 
In desserts we can't resist the temptation to order Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse and Rasberry Delice. 
Every and every dish has its own uniqueness and must try. Good collection in bar too, will try next time.
Innovative presentation and noting to complaint about quantity and taste just exquisite but so less in quantity compared to exorbitant pricing. They will only give small side plates to eat which is so annoying. As if we are from land of Lilliput. Service is simply pathetic. Two times they sent wrong order on table and on complaining they were apologetic. Such service from a Michelin starred brand is completely unacceptable when they are sending final bill of INR 4651. Got much better service from their next door neighbor Smoke House Deli or Serafina.

Finally gave Yauatcha a try after so much of hype and I must say I was happy. The first thing that strikes one is the decor and the ambience of the restaurant. Plus, the seats provided are some of the best in terms of comfort apart from looks. Coming to the food, I'll say I'd prefer the starters over the rice and noodle dishes(we had ordered Vegetable Fried Rice and Spicy Seafood Noodles) as they felt quite regular(as did the Braised Chicken). The starters, however, especially the Prawn Chueng Fun and Chicken and Prawn dim sums felt amazing, which had a subtle but great taste. There is a good variety in desserts and I've never seen such an assortment before. I tried the Raspberry Delice which was good and the the way the dishes were presented is another plus point. The starters feel a little expensive for the quantity served but they make up for it with the supreme quality and taste. Overall, had a good experience and I'd definitely like to go there again!

The food, and especially the dessert, is quite good. And so is the decor and ambience. Also, the chilly fried squid with oatmeal was something amusing. The server told it would be mildly spicy. But on tasting it turned out to have a hint of sweetness! Not that I'm complaining about it. But I'm curious regarding this dish. The desserts are of course heavenly. We had the jasmine tea cake and it was just right for our sweet tooth. What could probably improve though - is the service. Though the server may have mentioned the preparation time, I guess it's still a bit tardy given the weekend rush. The dessert wait was something. But it was worth it!

I totally loved the food, the ambience, the courtesy of the employees and off course the drinks too. It is a bit costly but it is worth that amount. The ginger martini was awesome. The right flavor. The kung pao chicken, the fried rice with XO oil , the shui mai and the hazelnut mousse was too good. Will visit again soon. One thing that i liked was the waiter(Sanu) attending us actually asked us if we are allergic to prawn when we ordered prawn and also warned us that the XO oil has pork. So that was really very helpful for anyone.

Main course of noodles and rice along with two veg side dish were absolutely fantastic. Specially the side dishes were too good. Deserts were not that impressive. On the whole kolkata has got a new dinning place so good after a long time. Three cheers.

Swany clean modern interiors which i LOVE. the truffle shiitake dumpling is to die for. I'm serious, its little fluffy ball of heaven.  Avoid the tofu claypot. Its terrible. The udon noodles are good and my personal favorite are the beans and the chinese greens. But if you are a fan of clean food , ask them to put very little sauce. They kill the vege taste by over saucing it. Soups? the green soup i got was literally bouncing due to the starch content. I do not get why they need to put shit ingredients in food when it can be made minus all that liver killing junk? dumplings, the veges, noodles are worth it. egg fried Rice is good too. Oh one thing.... they do not give you the tea leaves in the teapot... so ask them to leave the leaves in if you want it stronger...

The hand made flat rice noodles i ordered is by far the best noodles I've tasted, the other dishes i ordered were exquisite and did leave me asking for more, the portions of servings were also just right and one would not feel cheated compared to the pricing, its a total value for money unless you include alcohol, over all an excellent experience and look forward to my next meal at Yauatcha! Great Place must visit!

Ever since Yauatcha opened up in kolkata, there's been quite a hype surrounding it which put it on top of my bucket list. And Yauatcha did not disappoint. The ambience, decor and the quality of food is truly deserving of a Michelin star. But the quantity of food with regard to the prices is very disappointing. Coming to the food, the crispy duck roll is out of this world. The udon noodles, mongolian style cooked lamb are equally delicious. And as for the desserts, they taste even better than the way they are presented. One can come back to Yauatcha again and again just for these delicacies.

Was eagerly waiting for a dine-out at Yauatcha...finally went for one. The ambience was awesome and d staffs were friendly enough. Had ordered a mocktail- Tokyo Cooler and a cocktail- Lampeak Martini... they were not bad at all. Loved the dumplings: Duck roll and chicken wrapped in pok choi... Chicken sweet corn soup was also very tasty. For main course we had Chicken Fried Rice and Mongolian Lamb. Both of them were scrumptious. Also loved the desserts: Raspberry Delice and Chocolate Mousse. Looking forward to another fine dining at Yauatcha.

Kolkata's culinary landscape is evolving fast. And perhaps as a testimony to that is London's Michelin starred restaurant opening its kolkata branch at level 5 of Quest Mall. 
The decor of the place is amazing if you can manage a table inside. Outside the feel is more of casual dining than fine. The dark tables made from knotted pinewood, signature amoeba shaped plates and chopsticks from china add to the charm.
I visited Yauatcha as part of a foodie meet and the overall experience was most enjoyable though not mind blowing.
I had the kiwi iced tea to start off. Its a very pleasant pulpy drink. For the dim sums i had the pork and prawn one. And it was absolutely amazing! Soft delicious pork and prawn covered up with the thinnest coating I have ever seen! Pair it with the kashmiri chilli oil on your table and the tastes pop on your tongue. The soups followed. I had a taste of the chicken sweet corn and the chicken hot and sour. The sweet corn was pretty bland and the hot and sour was tasty but nothing special. A complimentary turnip cake was also served. And i must admit it was a work of sheer genius. Crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the insides. Never knew turnips could taste that way.
For the mains we were served egg fried rice, noodles with shallots cooked al dente, stir fried lotus roots, asparagus and french beens, some okra dish, chicken peppercorn, braised tofu claypot, a non braised tofu dish and kung pao chicken. None of the above dishes were unique or special as the starters were except the braised tofu. It tasted absolutely amazing! The fried rice used duck eggs which was nice. The kung pao chicken and the non braised tofu were decent. The chicken peppercorn and stir fried veggies not very good and the okra dish was downright bad!
The desserts brought back the charm of the starters. The chocolate hazelnut mousse tasted like heaven and was beautifully presented! The macaroons were real classy espcially the blueberry, looked beautiful and tasted even better with just the right texture and sweetness. The ice creams were delicious as well but unfortunately they were missing most of the flavours we wanted to try that evening.
All said and done, what really lets Yauatcha down is its service. The waiters forget orders, are slow and frequently mess up orders. The portion size of each dish is strictly for one. Each plate of dim sums have 3 to 4 dimsums only. The pricing is steep; no doubt about it but the dimsums and the desserts are worth every penny. The mains, not so much.

We visited this highly rated outlet situated on the 5th floor of Quest Mall as part of a special package offered to us by the restaurant. We were treated to a variety of delicacies.

Started with a non-alcoholic beverage. I chose the Orange and Chilli Cooler. Good orange juice with a hint of chilli, that you feel when it goes down your throat. A tad more of the chilli would probably be in order.

Then came the soups. I opted for the Chicken Hot n Sour one. Rather disappointing as I expected something vastly superior. Both this and the Sweet Corn Soup looked rather yellow and did not have the comfort feel generally associated with these soups. They were in fact quite impersonal. 

I opted for the dimsums. I asked for the Pork & Prawn Shui Mai. Four pieces very nicely presented in a bamboo case. Very delicately made, though I felt they were a bit on the harder side. Served with a couple of very interesting sauces (I forget the names).

The lower than average score has much to do with expectations.

By the time the main courses were served, they simply gave us a taste of a large amount of them. I particularly recall the Kung Pao Chicken and a similar chicken which was a stir fry. Both came with similar vegetables, and honestly I was impressed with neither. Look at it this way, if any other restaurant made them we would be happy, but here I expected something more! The noodles and fried rice was just so so! What really impressed us were two items that were served, one a complimentary serving of the Fried Turnip Cake (very nice and crispy) and the Braised Tofu Claypot.

Moving on to desserts... what really caught my fancy was their much touted Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse! A true delight here. Delicate mousse with a serving of icecream. Go for it.

Service was below par. There was a lot of confusion as to what we would get, and some of the items were not served correctly. In addition, sitting outside on the corridor somehow does not cut it, in a premium place like this.

Yauatcha at Quest Mall is my next door neighbor and I am satisfied with the food, interiors and ambiance. But it will be a misnomer to compare it with her Mumbai counterpart. Today I went there during tea time and had Chicken  Cheung Fun and Raspberry Delice. You know it is best when you taste it. No words more as taste is where lies the answer. Going again tomorrow to give a treat to my guests.

 My 2nd review - Today went with my BFF. We had Hargau which we voted best, Lotus leaf wrapped rice dumplings, Egg Fried Rice, Stir Fried Chicken Claypot and Raspberry Delice. We loved it especially Hargau.

Well as expected the dim sums were outstanding!!  Was quite disappointed with my main course. The sticky rice and the fish were totally off. A great gesture by the restaurant for not putting it on the bill. Will be there again soon.

Awesome experience. The best place to have dimsums in Kolkata. Ambience very neat and uncluttered. Brilliant service. Food very neatly presented and very carefully cooked. Not a point missed.

A new concwpt of chinoise nouveau cuisine concept but needs attention to manning of the place...too much wait in terms of ordering however it seemed to have paid off well with our palate. One advice, gate control and first come first serve concept shall help them- reason being , with all spirited and upscale restaurants in the vicinity, people would not wait for a table like we did. Pre-Book only on special occasions to earn the extra buck but not for slow and steady weekend lunches. You may lose to serafina and smoke house. Table wobbling needs improvement, and some one needs to assist Michelle -seekingly the gate manager there, this adds to her very cheerful and yet strict demeanour. Menu must have descriptions.

I visited this place for lunch today with friends. I must give full marks for ambience. The place is lovely, with seating outside and inside the restaurant, the indoors also offer a lovely view from a full length glass window on the side facing the road. Service was also very good. 
We ordered 2 dimsums, chicken cheung fun (soft, steamed dimsums in soy sauce) and a prawn deep fried one with a sweet sauce. Both were quite lovely with delicate flavours. The main course was quite disappointing though. We had spicy seafood noodles which had plenty of seafood but was sweet rather than spicy. The kung pao chicken was also too sweet and the stir fried tenderloin had an overbearing burned taste apart from being too sweet like the other dishes. I wanted to have thier desserts which I have been hearing about but the main course left us nauseated with the bland sweet taste of everything and no desire for more sweets. The place is rather expensive but that is expected since it is supposed to be fine dining. 
Overall it's a good place to go for if you want a great ambience and the dimsums are nice. Would I go again? Probably not.

Quite an exotic place to dine at. Had been to the london branch. The calcutta branch is yet to meet the standards i had expected. Nevertheless i have enjoyed the dinner. Though the service was at times slow, the staff was friendly and cooperative and the dim sums were quite good but rough from outside and a bit too dry. The starters were not bad but they tasted either same or too spicy. Chicken and pork dim sums and prawn rolls. The rolls were quite sticky and starchy- could do without the gravy/syrup. The main food was served in reasonable portions which impressed me. Lamb, pork, prawn-chicken noodles and fish in asam sauce- they were quite spicy but quite good too. I loved the deserts- chocolate ganache, jasmine-rasberry chocolate mix cake and different flavoured three macarons. We were in a group of four and between us this all was shared- it was enough and quite filling! We had a good time. But the ambience needs to be more colourful- dash of delicate Mediterranean colours can do. Thanks for a lovely time!

This is definitely one of my most favorite restaurants. Been to the BKC branch in Mumbai several times. Was very excited when they opened in Kolkata and have been raving about it to all my friends. However I went there yesterday for my birthday and had made a reservation too mentioning it. Pretty surprised there was not any special welcome for a birthday. I am yet to visit a restaurant anywhere in India or abroad where they always do something special. You broke my heart Yauatcha :(
       Moving on I highly recommend the Edmame with truffle oil if you really want to experience a completely new flavor and ofcourse the crispy prawn chow fun.
        The decor is no where near BKC which was disappointing too.Liquor license yet to get :(

Went there for a lunch. Ambience & quality of food was pretty good. But quantity was very low as compare to the pricing. Presentation/garnish was accurate which shows there standard. 
But service:- need lot of changes. When I am paying 10% service charge, I can expect the service person will serve the food to me. They are even not clear about the not available items in the kitchen. 
These are the points needs to be improve immediately . Overall good, recommended those who love Cantonese food.

Located in one of the most elegant malls of Kolkata, Quest mall, this restaurant has a huge seating area.. However with the price tag it holds for its items I doubt there will ever be a need to reserve a table..
I went here with family (I must admit it is one of the places where one MUST go with family), we ordered fried and steamed dumplings for starters along with some soup. Soup was good, though I wouldn't say so for the dumplings. Dumplings were small, oily and lacked taste. The main course was brilliant and worth every bite.
There is a saying that the first impression is the last, however it is not so with this place. Just when we were forming our opinions about this place, the desserts came.. Each dessert has a unique taste and prepared to perfection. If one could, he should visit the place only for its desserts.
Overall, an enriching experience.. Though ambience surpasses the food.

The food here is some of the best authentic chinese dishes that you can come across town, coupled with exotic dishes as the likes of duck, tofu, squid which are pretty rare in Kolkata. The dim sums, noodles and desserts are to be watched out for. The service here is warm and friendly. They take into account the very little details of you and makes sure that you are never in discomfort. The ambience is to be highly spoken of. The light lightings, coupled with the city skyline looking past the restaurant's skyscraper panoramic view is something to admire. The light shade of sunlight falling on your face as you are sitting by the view takes you to another level together with the delicacies being offered. It looks like a small aristocratic modern restaurant.   The only downside to this place is tat it is a bit too pinchy on the pocket. 1000 INR as taxes for a meal of 4 is not something that the folks of Kolkata would abide by.

I should not be writing this review now because i plan on visiting this place some more times so that i can try out as much as i can but i could not help myself.  if you are a fan of asian fare this is the place to be. 

We tried out the sweet corn soup which was amazing. I have never had such a different version of sweet corn soup. It actually did justice to its main ingredient that is corn. 

In the dim sum section we tried the crystal dumplings and mushroom cheung fun. Both were amazing especially the mushroom. Being a through and through mushroom fan it was a treat for my taste buds. We ordered for the vegetarian fried rice and chinese greens in schezwan sauce even though we were too full from the dimsums. But we could not leave without trying a few more dishes. All the dishes were amazing.

Finally came desserts. We ordered for the raspberry delice and oh boy was it a sight for sore eyes. It was the most beautifully plated dessert that i have ever seen in my life. And oh did it taste amazing. I could go back many many times just for this.

Yauatcha is the closest I have gotten to the White House I think. I mean they keep out as many people as Obama's guards are advised to scare away. I live in Bombay, yet, wanted to dine at the new outlet in Kolkata during a trip last week. We walked in at about 9.30pm at the outlet, where only two tables were occupied. We asked for a place for three when the woman at the reception emphatically said, they are completely booked. Despite our friends having complained about absurd behaviour, we thought they really meant it - it was during the Durga Pujas and it was perfectly possible that they were booked. We settled down at Serafina, right opposite the restaurant instead. Curiously enough, none of the tables got filled the two hours we were at Serafina. There were several empty tables, in fact there were not more than three tables occupied at a given time. I mean since when did hard-to-get become a restaurant's best resort ? it's the food which is supposed to speak, right? So what's with the cheerleading team captain from Hollywood behaviour guys?

What an experience! Yummiest food! You just can't live your life without having the taste for such luxurious dining. 

Really liked the bottle shaped hanging lights. The staff are very friendly and courteous. If you have a table booked you are the king, if you don't you have to be lucky to get a table inside. I felt those who don't have their table pre-reserved are given one in the lobby section. 

Had the best Tofu so far(unparalleled), the chopsticks sliced it so fine that it felt it was sliced by a blade. Awesome! I am coming again Yauatcha. See you soon

This review has nothing to do with the food. I have heard good about the food here and went on 7th Oct afternoon. I regret to say that when i asked for a place inside, the lady there asked us to wait and then she was discussing something with another lady who had a laptop. I waited for 5 mins without any response from either of the persons there. I believe it was really very unprofessional. I went over to another restaurant for having food, purely because i felt insulted. 
Am sure your food must be very good but unfortunately the first instance of mine with your restaurant was definitely not a good one.

Thanks

On Sunday 4th October 2014, we approached the hostesses for a table for 3 (we were 3 women). The place was nicely packed with a few tables empty. We were informed that they were all booked, and would be for the next 45 minutes. We believed them and asked for a booking after 45 minutes, which we were refused and asked to just walk-in. This did not make sense to us. If the place was packed now it could be the same 45 minutes later too. We opted to not risk it and enjoyed a delicious meal at Serafina opposite, with impeccable staff and mind-blowing food. 

By chance, we were in the mall on the consecutive Monday (5th October 2014) evening too. It was dinner time, and the outside seating was absolutely deserted, with not one customer in sight. There were a few tables occupied within the inside seating area. There were 2 of us this time (2 women) and we asked for a table for 2. 

Imagine our shock when we again heard the word "Booked!" When I asked one of the hostesses, whether she actually wanted me to believe that 100% of her tables were booked at 7:30 pm on Monday evening when everybody could see that more than half her restaurant was empty, she whispered to the hostess standing next to her "Should I give them a table?!"

Understanding that we were experiencing a modern version of "Indians and Dogs not allowed" we left. 

I have seen the related company's staff answering previously disgruntled reviewers with "We deeply regret that your experience at Yauatcha was very unpleasant.Please accept our sincere apologies on the behalf of our staff for the dismal service.
Request you to please give us the opportunity to connect with you offline." 

Please note I am not interested in connecting offline. And this is not your staff's shortcoming, this is a lacuna at the manager's level. 

I hope you will not continue with this bizarre, wrong and completely unnecessary profiling.

Yauatcha is a place I absolutely love visiting. I can't tell you all how very glad I am that its opened up in Kolkata and I don't always have to head to the Delhi one to eat there. Its truly "fine dining" at its best. The sheer range of delicate subtle flavours and layers in every bite make this place an absolute foodies delight. The original Yauatcha opened up in London in 2oo4 and got its Michelin Star in the very next year no small feat because London has no dearth of excellent restaurants. 

The ambience is very elegant and soothes you puts you in a mellow mood perfect for a Dimsum Tea House. But underlying the casual elegance is the fine attention paid to all the detail. The beautiful signature Oriental embroidery on all their upholstery which is featured in all their outlets globally . The Scottish clay lights which never heat up and provide perfect ambient changes at various times of the day. The lovely dark furniture made from knotty pine-wood. The delicate rosewood chopsticks which rest on the little porcelain holder with a delicate greenish infusion specially sourced from Japan and their signature white amoeba shaped plates all just add to the lovely ambiance.

The food does full justice to the delightful canvas it is served upon. Its delicious , delicate and simply put elegant food at its best. The portions are individual portions which makes it easy to order a greater variety of dishes if you want to share your food as well.

The mocktails are spectacular my personal pick is the Kiwi and Lime Iced Tea .... its brilliant and I love the kiwi pulp in it . The Tokyo Cooler was rather nice as well. 

We started our meal with Dimsums (naturally) their signature Truffle and Edamame is spectacular melt in your mouth delicious. Dip it in your dipping sauce and pop it in and your transported to foodie heaven. The Scallop Shui mai followed which was delicious one of the few places which cooked the scallop perfectly and a touch of fish roe on top gave it a depth of taste that I enjoyed. Crispy Duck Rolls followed and I am personally not a big lover of Duck but order these blindly. Love the minced duck mixture in it and the best part is the roll is perfectly crisp. This was followed up by a divine Prawn Cheung Fun which is crispy prawn/chicken/vegetables wrapped up in a covering and steamed to silky perfection.... the balance of textures is perfect and delicious..... Loved it. Chicken Charsui Bun was served next and it was soft light and heavenly loved the bun and the filling .... a must order. Jasmine Smoked Spare Ribs which were beyond delicious and my must order Ho Fan Noodles were brilliant and I love the silky texture of the noodles and the crunch of the fresh peppers and sprouts .... awesome is the word. For all you sea-food and prawn lovers do try the Wild Prawn Curry which was just Wow ! One of the most delicately and perfectly coked prawn dishes I have had in recent times.

Now after such a meal we were stuffed silly but you can't go to Yauatcha and not eat dessert ..... their signature Raspberry Delice was not available that day because their rule is no ingredients that are not supremely fresh and measuring up to their high standards will be served. I salute that and will just have to go back soon to have my fill of that spectacular dessert. That day I settled for three flavours of their macaroons orange , pistachio and jasmine tea all of which are wonderful and washed it down with some delightful  Jasmine Tea. 

I simply can't wait to go back for more ! Highly recommended and undoubtedly one of the best places to open up in the city in recent times ! Happy me !!!!!

Special thanks to Anindiya and his entire team for such a wonderful experience.

As a diehard fan of Oriental cuisine, I had been waiting eagerly for the day I would visit yauatcha. I would reserve my opinion regarding the price vs portion debate as I am led to believe that specialty cuisine is about quality and not quantity! While the starters were exceptionally delightful, I especially enjoyed the crispy duck rolls, I would say that that quality was vastly amiss in the items we ordered for mains. The sea food noodles could be called average at best and the crispy lamb was all crisp and no lamb! The signature dessert was not available and the other ones we tried couldn't make much of an impression. The service was extremely poor and the delay in getting the food to the table was quite a bit. For a restaurant that spent the many months prior to their opening parading their Michelin fame, the experience was truly disappointing. I suppose the only thing Michelin about them was the haughty manner in which we were informed that they were booked out for the night, although, during the entire time that we were there the restaurant didn't even fill up!

One place I'd really been waiting for ! The dumplings are to die for.. The edimame, crystal and prawn dumplings are a must try. Also if you're a non-veggie you have to have to try the steamed fish in black bean sauce.. Their desserts are the best in town ! Try the hazelnut one and also the mousse cake ???? ORGASMIC !!

Finally after a long wait I had the opportunity to visit what is probably Kolkatas most anticipated restaurant in years, but unlike most things desi or bollywood, the fanfare and publicity did not lead to a disappointing experience. Much to the contrary, the experience was in fact better than expected. 

Now some may argue that its misleading to advertise as a michelin star eatery as the star is awarded to individual establishments so its really the london outlet that has one, but then that's being a little harsh. Movies advertise themselves as 'academy award winner' not that the artist won the award for that movie. Its a certification of the mettle and quality of work. Luckily I have had the fortune of dining in a few michelin star restaurants in the past and that said, the experience may not have been up there but the enthusiasm sure was. The food was excellent and exuded the quality you would expect from such a place. 

Getting to the food, the first dish on the cards was a chicken pok choy dumpling, a chicken cheung fun, crispy duck roll and a prawn hargao. Each dish was brilliant to say the least. The pok choy dumpling was moist and full of flavour. We ended up drinking the ginger sauce it came in as it was simply divine. The cheung fun is like a fried spring roll that is then wrapped in dumpling sheet and steamed. The crispy duck roll was nostalgic reminding me of the peking duck I had in Beijing some years ago. The duck was moist and the wrap was crisp and piping hot. It really was perfect right down to the sweet black bean sauce, but a word of caution as this is an acquired taste. The prawn hargao was beautifully cooked with the sweetness of the prawns and the crispness of the bamboo shoot bits really shining through. I would also suggest that if you enjoy the pungency of chilli and sesame oil but can do without the spicy punch, try the dumplings with the chilli paste served at the start. It really enhances the experience. 

But a strange experience that accompanied this was that the server warned me that the dim sums were going to be 3 pieces and the cheung fun was going to be a larger portion. Apparently, this was because many diners had complained that they didn't expect to be served a steam box of 3 dumplings. However, to be honest, not being alien to the concept of Chinese and Japanese Tea houses, I was well aware that the portions would be that size and furthermore, the dumplings themselves are generous in size needing usually 2 bites but I can understand the shock that many diners feel when they get served so please take my word, this is quite normal and demanding otherwise could come at the cost of quality and they certainly would not want to do that otherwise they would be just another standard oriental restaurant in Kolkata. 

Moving to the main course, the udon noodles and clay pot chicken really hit home. The udon tasted super fresh and not like they were made from a packaged variety, the bean sprouts in the noodles were fresh and crunchy and the vegetable still retained a lot of flavour not masked by the sauces on the noodles. The clay pot chicken was again superbly seasoned and the black mushrooms were juicy and melty. Truth be told, if it wasn't for an overdose of starters we would have ordered more main courses. 

Now for the part of the meal that in my book is the piece de resistance which can make or break a dine is the desserts. First of, each dessert is unique and has so many elements that you have to be patient and savoir every bite slowly and intently. Furthermore, each is paired with a special fresh in-house ice cream (not the box variety) specifically for the dish. Example, the Choc Hazelnut mouse is covered in a dark cocoa powder that hits the taste buds sharply before you sink into the sweet mousse. The flavour of the hazelnut shines through as you roll it around in your mouth. Hidden inside is a solid chocolate ball filled with soft crunchy nougat that really whack the senses. This is coupled with a lovely honey based icecream that melts away if you're not fast (since its fresh) and served on a bed of fresh chocolate crumbs that slightly nutty but smoothly chocolaty. And then the burnt milk caramel tuille is a pallet cleanser. The experience continues with the 'Religieuse' which a soft moist choux pastry stuffed with smooth caramel custard and served with an off beat fruit ice cream. The choux is superb and so is the ice cream decorated with disks of white and dark chocolate that is smooth yet snappy. 

To wash it all down the beverage list is unique and has some lovely stuff (unfortunately the liqueur license is yet to come) like the passion fruit ice tea or the orange juice with chilli syrup and lemon grass (both extremely refreshing). 

My only grouse was that they have been out of their signature 'Raspberry Delice' for a week now and no one knows when its coming. So before you decide to stop reading further here goes: 

Food: 5. No complains and needs many more visits to try everything 

Ambiance/Decor: 4.5. Its really nice inside but a mixed bag since the presence in a mall for a restaurant of this standard is off putting especially the outside seating. 

Service: 5. They jump in to serve a pregnant lady, ask everyone on the table for allergies, suggest the best dishes and accommodate to make a special drink that will taste good at room temperature for someone who has a cold and being asked how the food was after each course.

Value for Money: 4. My grouse is only that it doesn't feel as premium as the price demands and that too due to peering of the mall crowd through the windows. The food suits the price as does the decor but maybe a bit more seclusion was better.

It was a Sunday night me and my wife decided to go this star place!!
We reached at 9:10 pm. I asked if we could get a table for 2 inside the restaurant and not outside. I was told no it is not possible. I would have to wait till 10 pm and I did agree to wait.
Suddenly things changed and I was politely told that the lady would check if something came up. After 10 mins I was offered a table.
Went in sat and waited for around 10 mins for someone to attend.
Luckily I had someone very helpful to attend us and we placed our orders.
The food was served at a good pace. They did apologize for the delay of the beverage rather forgot but acceptable.
All the food that had been ordered pictures below was really tasty.
Sticky rice was the only thing i personally did not like coz it seemed a bit too salty.
Food would not be  that expensive only if there was less
Kol food vat @14.5%
Kol Bev Vat@14.5%
Kol Bev carb @14.5%
Kol Svc Charge @10%
Kol Svc Tax @4.944
according to my bill my tax was around Rs 1050.
Over all experience very Good!! Service was also very good.
Friendly smiling staff.

Yauatcha, London was awarded Michelin Star in 2005 (which they have retained). I don't see why the restaurant is marketing itself in a manner which makes customers reasonably believe that the Kolkata branch has been awarded with such a title. This kind of publicity only leads to an increased expectation, and more often that not, you shall be disappointed. 

Pros: At the outset, the four stars are entirely and only because of the exceptional food. 

Ambience: If you re lucky to get a table by the glass, you'll get a good view of the city, which makes it even better on a rainy day.

Food: The appetisers were the winners of the meal. Each appetiser prepared exquisitely, great presentation, lovely balance of flavours, every bite was a treat to the palate. The crispy duck rolls, are indeed extremely crispy on the outside and tender flavoursome duck meat inside. The prawn pork shui mai is also made to perfection, steamed and juicy! Sesame prawns toast, a large prawn hiding under an umbrella of crunchy sesame, tasted best when dunked in a chilli soya dip. The tea smoked spare ribs was delicious, smoked meats with a great tangy, sweet sauce. 

Cons: 
Service is very very poor. Unavailability of items on their menu, handling crowd and pressure, delays in taking the order, preparing, and billing.

No coaster on the table: As a result of which there is water accumulating at the base of your glass on the table, and when you move the glass, it's watery everywhere. 

No specific server assigned for the table: So someone took the drink order, someone else came for mains, another person for dessert. No service follow up, no one really asked if the food was good, no one to see you out/thank while leaving - in other words, not very courteous. Not the kind of hospitality you expect at a chain which boasts about it's Michelin Star. 

Pro to some, con to others: Portion sizes v Price: 

Personally, I loved the portion sizes. The concept itself embodies small portions; every plate can be shared ideally by two (avg 2-4 pieces per appetiser) The mains can be shared by 3. This gave us options to try more dishes. However, larger groups (4+ people) may be disappointed. Most items are not very expensive, unless you choose to pick the Crispy Aromatic Duck, Lobster, Seafood soup, etc all together! 
However, we were disappointed by the seafood soup! Served in a small clay pot, one dumpling and barely any broth (see pic), priced at Rs 800 is not worth it.

Verdict: This outlet has much work to do, before it can boast about being a part of the Yauatcha chain. However, you will love everything that is in the menu! The food is really exceptional at Yauatcha.

Fantastic place to sit and enjoy the fine taste they serve on amazing paltters! 

We got a seat after two trials. Some how the BLU lady at the entrance is been trained to say a NO to whoever comes to eat. This is only after repeated Requests they would let you in. So one day we were the lucky ones! 

We truly enjoyed whatever came on the table..  had ordered a variety of dimsums. I felt the portions were lil less. Like 3 dimsums per portion for four ppl really becomes a tough task to order and enjoy meal. 

Loved the baked / fried ones. They came in a really cute looking standing bowl. The sauces were excellent. Super cool service & friendly staff inside. (Unlike the Blu Ladies)

Overall a fun place to be.

First ever Michelin star dining experience in Kolkata at Yauatcha.Inspite of taking reservations,the lady at the reception told us that they were sold out.On insistence she realised her mistake and we got a table at the quiet indoors as compared to the hustle bustle at the mall facing seats.
Took us minutes to filter the v (vegetarian) dishes from the menu..it has an array of dimsums and we ordered the steamed chinese chive dimsums and the pan fried shanghai dimsums.We finished the steamed dimsums even before they served the yummy dipping sauces.I found steamed chive dimsum okayish and rather bland maybe coz they hadnt served the sauces.
Then came the stir fry udon noodles with mock meat and bean sprouts.Finicky me,removed the mock meat and had the rest.It had flavour in every bite.The black pepper sauce seasoning was one of the best Ive had.
The only vegetarian option of the dessert was  chocolate hazelnut mousse.The top of the mousse looked as if it was blow torched.The hazelnut bit hid below the velvet textured mousse and the caramel and icecream complemented the dish super well.
Apart from the dimsums which is supposed to be the super speciality ,i loved both the other dishes.
Overall portion size was too less for the dimsums so you end up ordering more and increasing the bill value.Felt that it was short staffed and that they need more training.

Hi Guys !! Hav been a big fan of Yauatcha since its inception. Their Mumbai outlet remains to be one of my Hot Favourites in addition to Mainland China, when it comes to Chinese Food. I usually don't write my reviews on the web & this is probably the first time am writing one for reasons best described here. I was overjoyed to hear Yauatcha's announcement in Kolkata & could not resist to dine here. The ambience as usual is superb, I would rather describe it as casually smart. The whole atmosphere is very funfilled & their servers are really doing a great job. Kudos to the entire team !! I somehow did not savour the Food as much as I have on couple of occasions at Yauatcha Mumbai. The Dimsums were overcooked & tasted more of its crust than its filling. Moreover, being a hardcore non vegetarian, the Dimsums had a very strong smell of meat, dunno yyyy ?? Found the Lamb to be undercooked on the other hand. It felt quite tough. However, there is always scope for improvement & probably they will come back to track like the one in Mumbai which has always been delighting its customers. I leave it to this now. I thought I had another destination in Kolkata to go for Chinese but I think I would rather stick back to my preference for Mainland China as usual, for their trust that they have build up over the last many years now.

YAUATCHA CALCUTTA !!! SUPREMELY Sublime!!!  A MUST TRY and MUST do repeat visits kinda Restaurant in  the Quest Mall.
Dimsum is an old friend of mine.In Los Angles the city I lived in was famous for its numerous Dimsum restaurants. In San Gabriel Valley the variety, quality and service is just incredible.
I was wondering whether Yauatcha could match my expectations ..IT ABSOLUTELY SURPASSED IT.
If you understand that Dimsum is an edible ART FORM and it needs utmost precision and care to make it, then you will appreciate that...
YAY !!!. Team Yuautcha and Dimsum Chef KHUSHAL LAMA got it PERFECT!!! Yauatcha gives you a complete, classy kinesthetic experience.You see beauty in a basket, it smells delicious,presenting a wide variety of texture,sending your taste buds into a tizzy and you hear the bells ringing as you reach the Satiety Heaven

Please  be advised that most Dimsum come in 3 piece serving size.Also know that Dimsum CANNOT  be doggy bagged because it is made of pure ingredients and spoils if not eaten right away.
Here are some of the items I tried and loved. 
 1. STICKY RICE IN LOTUS LEAF ( also known as Lo mai gai)  SUUPERB!as authentic as can be!! A MUST HAVE.
 2.STEAMED BOCKCHOY ~ most delicious greens, cooked to perfection with flavorful sauce.A must try.
 3.JASMINE TEA SMOKED PORK RIBS ~ EXQUISITE.. best I have had anywhere in the world. It has a light smokey barbecue flavor with a slightly sweet and tangy flavor.served with pomegranate seeds. A MUST HAVE.
4..CHICKEN CHAR SUI CHEUNG FUN (  also known as rice noodle roll) ~ amazing, tasty chicken bits,wrapped in big rice noodle roll.One of my all time favorites.
5.CRISPY DUCK ROLL ~ perfectly made.its like a spring roll only better.w/ delicious dipping sauces.
6.WRAPPED CHICKEN  WITH BLACK PEPPER  ~ delicious, cooking in the lotus leaf like our banana leaf dishes,it retains the flavor.
7 INDIAN SEA BASS MOOLI ROLL ~  great for fish lovers.
Will go back for desserts next time. :)
All in all a fabulous dining experience.. its a treat to have different flavors and textures cooked with utmost care and served in  a classy environment.

A terrible experience ... We were 5 ladies ordered veg set menu during lunch ... When they got the soup we were shocked they literally got about 4 spoons of soup ... We called the server and he informed that this the quantity served ... We called for the manager n he said the same thing one lady told him that in Delhi they don't serve like this ... Manager started arguing saying that in Mumbai it's served like this and then told us he will call the gm ... Nor did he come back or the gm ... After a while they took the soup and served us a full bowl .... What a liar 
Me vijay Rane yauatcha Kolkata 
Good food though

I have been waiting for this place to open for a long time after eating at the other ones in Delhi and London. Super food and service. Little pricey when you call them and ask for a reservation but I was offered a table when I got there. Quality fo food is super. The mocktails are great (no bar license yet which is a shame). Prawn and water chestnut dimsum, beef in black pepper sauce, crispy lamb with mango, Jaffa cake, hazelnut mousse are top picks. Enjoy.

Guys, if you are fiodie and you love asian food - this is must go place. Gone there today with some friends. Amazing place, great decor and tasty food. This is luxury dining at its best. Must try dishes are dumings and duck roll. Wd want to compliment the management of quest mall as well, 5th floor has all luxury dining joints with great settings. This place must be rocking in the evenings.

What to expect from a Michelin Star restaurant but excellent food , service and ambience.....Yauatcha provides all of them. The Indian Seabass in black bean sauce and Truffle Edamame Dumplings are exceptionally finger licking good. Macarons are a must try in the desserts. Would love to visit again and again.....

I can define this place with one word. Classy !! The classy decor, the sitting, the fantastic view from the restaurant, very polite n well mannered waiters and then comes the food. Wow. Our Anniversary was just perfect. This place is costly but worth it. I haven't tried the macaroons but I am definitely trying them on my next visit. 

Bon Appetite

What a place and what an experience... what else could you get from a Michelin starred place in the first place... as per the advise of a friend who informed us that the big chefs from all other cities are here for training and the food right now will be top notch so to check it out as soon as possible... 

we did just that... and were surprised... on a Tuesday night this place was almost full to the limit...

First the Cons.... the ladies standing outside trying to fix a place and help you out are just rubbish... just cause you start working in a big restaurant does not mean that you can talk rudely and misbehave with people and think you can get away with it...  god bless the manager of the place as he is really polite and well spoken... on the contrary normally in big places the people are so polite and nice to talk to cause they know the value of a customer.... 

the service in overall is very average... this is because they are right now highly understaffed and they making the best that they can do with the people they have....

the serving of the dishes is also pretty small and the portions even smaller...

Now the PROS!!!! the FOOD!!!! oh my god the FOOD!!! from the shitake dumplings to the crispy veg rolls to the hot and sour soup to the Orchid tea!!!!! everything was out of the world and made to perfection... nothing i have eaten in Kolkata can come close to the rush that this place could bring... it was just amazing and everything was served properly and together with no hiccups...

they do not serve alcohol yet... and the mock tails are in numbers... and they too are made with a twist which makes them just amazing...

in the main course for veg they have specialized the Udan noodles and the Chinese greens in Garlic sauce was to die for...

the best thing about this place is that there is quite a number of options in the overall menu for vegetarians as compared to other specialty restaurants... which is a great bonus

DO NOT try the dessert as they are so very average... the raspberry dessert was enough to make me choke with the bad taste....

overall this place and the food has won me over and i am waiting for the next time that i visit them....

My review is totally based on the food and the ambience...... 
The much awaited restaurant that I have been thinking of going 
A Michellen star restaurant more than an elite restaurant I can say 
Really expectd a world class service well Wich I did get somewhat,  now the food well it's yummlious mouth watering dishes,  the dumplings are a must have dish in there starter's tho somehow I feel keeping the food lovers in kolkata the quantity is a bit saddening I mean 3 pcs....  Do try the duck roll as it's another highly recommended dish in the starter's again the quantity is a major setback atleast according to me the ambience is really nice comfort setting lovely view of the entire area overall a great all day dining place,  in the main course u can try the crispy chicken with green mango it's yummy 
For the pricing it's a bit heavy on the pocket but it's worth a go

I have never really eaten dim sums before. 
After eating here, I now know I was missing out on something in my life ! 
I'm glad I went for dinner with someone special  - it just made everything so much better. 
 So we ordered the Truffle ademame dim sums which were extremely light and tasty . More than that , I just love the sauces they serve with it - the garlic chilli sauce, garlic chilli oil and soy sauce . Mix it all together and the taste is impeccable ! 
Then we had the spicy vegetable rice and lotus petal+water chestnut vegetable .Damn ! Veg food can be tasty:D 
Once again, I added a bit of that sauce to the rice, which undoubtedly tasted brilliant ! You will get lost in the flavours. 
The best part is that we had room for desserts ! Normally after a meal you feel extremely full and heavy, but their portions are so appropriate and food is filling but light that we ordered for 2 desserts ! 
I particularly like the pistachio and raspberry macaroons than the jasmine flavoured one. Although, their macarons can be made better as it tends to flake out soon and are pretty flat and big. 
Then again, the raspberry Delice just made my night. Not only does it look tempting and makes your mouth water but it is everything you hoped for and more when you saw it. 

Another thing, these suggestions were made by the waiter who did not hesitate to answer my curious questions about the various types of dim sums ! Just amazing . 

Happy Dining ! :)

I had been eying this place ever since I visited the eatery opposite to it! Well finally mom took me out for lunch and this was the place :) amazing hospitality... We were guided to our seats and the staff were very courteous! We planned to take a hargau dimsums... Bliss! The chicken and prawn sui mai .. Which was very good... The barbeque chicken steamed rolls which was average! The portion was small for all... And they really need to work on it! 3 Pieces dim sums per plate! I had a dessert with mango and it was at it's best! The service is very slow and thats the worst part!

There ought to be a provision for negative rating on Zomato, because, as Meghdeep Bhattacharyya has said in his review, Yauatcha in Calcutta deserves about a -5. We went there and requested a table for two; we did not have any prior reservations. I would have understood their "problem" if the restaurant had been choc-a-bloc -- it wasn't. There were at least a dozen tables empty. The English lady at the counter was very nice to us -- when we requested a table for two, she immediately responded in the affirmative. A split second later, her Indian colleague, a young woman with stars tattooed on her neck -- she left us waiting at the counter in order to go scour a half-empty restaurant to "check" if a table for two would be "possible" (there were, as I said, numerous such tables sitting empty right in front of our eyes in the outside section) -- overruled her and told us that no two-seaters were available, so would we please come back with prior reservations? When quizzed about all the empty tables, she told us they had all been booked and the guests were expected. As Meghdeep said in his review, we then went to the stellar Smoke House Deli, which is just a few feet away from Yauatcha, and watched the proceedings -- not a single one of the tables that were ostensibly "booked" was taken right up till the the time that the place shut for the night. I watched the lady with the star tattoos leave for the night, right past the rows of empty tables that she refused to us for no good reason. 

As a good friend put it, Yauatcha at the Quest displayed its version of a "fascinatingly crass casteism of judging patrons by the potential weight of their wallets." Disgusting. Do yourself a favour and don't spend your hard-earned money there. I cannot comment on the quality of the food, but judging by the other reviews here, it's been more disappointing than good.

The long and the short of it is that this is a place you have to eat at if you want authentic tastes. 

Wonderful food. Really good vegetarian options. The dim sums were phenomenal. Crispy vegetable dim sum was superb. A crisp veg spring roll inside a perfectly steamed outer shell. Just amazing. The shanghai dumplings as well as the veggie chive dumplings were great. The flavours were clean and you could taste each component. 

Spicy Aubergine and okra, spicy veg fried rice and the udon noodles were excellent. Never imagined eating eggplant and okra with such different taste. The tofu clay pot was a bit of a let down but the mains were still good. 

The desserts were what took the dinner to a whole another level. In a group of 6 we ordered 4 at first thinking it's a lot but then ordered two more and would have ordered even more if we were not full and not feeling guilty. The raspberry delice, the mandarin chocolate tart, Jaffa cake and hazelnut mousse were simply awesome. The chocolate profiteroles were good but in comparison were a let down in comparison. The real argument is which one two order. The mandarin chocolate tart or the raspberry delice. 

But after all this there were a couple of let downs. First a number of items were not available. Second the a/c in the outside seating was very warm. Finally there a few of start up pains like the chilled water dispenser not working etc. which should be sorted out fast. 

I will definitely go back again and often as long as they maintain the quality and pricing.

The first michelin star restaurant in kolkata lives up to the expectation in food but not much when it comes to service .

We ordered Shitake mushroom dumplings which was very nice and i had to order another serving. Also, its just three dumplings per serve. Truffle edamame dumpling was ok , Veg shangai dumplings were nice and fried turnip cake is a must try for starters.
 
As for the main course we ordered Szechuan veg tofu claypot and Hofan noodles which were good.
And finally for the dessert Rasberry delice which was very nice. 

The problem with the joint is that the service is very poor, there was confusion regarding the reservation with the staff at the counter and they need 4 servers to decide which table to alot.

Try and get a seating inside as outside is very hot and noisy , you cant really enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant .

Also the place is Rs. 1500 per head easily as the quantity of food is not much , so you end up ordering more.

Went on the first day, after waiting for an hour we got our seats even though the restaurant was not full..Ordered 3 starters
Duck roll, pork and prawn Sui mui(had better) and Chicken wrapped in Pok Choi.Found a piece of paper on the chicken even after pointing it out we dint get any response.....
Had to wait nearly 45 minutes for the main course which was okay nothing extra ordinary.the waiters names the dishes different and were not properly briefed about the menu....
Desert was good the raspberry delice and the Religieus both were the best dish for the night.the bill came up to approx 4500 for 9 dishes.
Ambiance: 8/10
Food: 8.5/10

Tried this out with high expectations being a michelin star. While the dim sum was good, the portions were very small considering the pricing, I.e,  3-4 pieces at most. Stir fried tenderloin had good soft texture but was too sweet for my liking. Also wild prawn curry was mediocre and desserts were decent, the rasberry delice being the best of the lot. Overall an average meal but sadly not the amazing Michelin star quality expected to justify the current pricing.

I was eagerly waiting for this restaurant to open its doors in calcutta.. had heard great reviews oof the same in bombay. I had made a reservation but when we went there they said my reservation was not registered in their system. .the manager immediately looked into the matter and we got a table.
The food is good..Of course a michelin star restaurant. .this is a place for dimsums.. there are a variety of them and its definitely worth trying..the staff are friendly and courteous. .
though i felt their service is a bit slow.. though the steward came and did apologise for the delay in serving us. 
Not many options in the main course though but yes their quality is very good.. and yes the glass panels in the restaurant definitely doesn't make u feel u r in calcutta..
so for those who love dimsums definitely must visit.. but yes its a high end restaurant but definitely worth trying.

I visited newly opened yautacha after having an excellent experience in Mumbai. However, while the food was good (we just managed to taste one dish before walking out after an hour) the restaurant seems to be struggling with teething troubles. There was a mass confusion regarding orders and the staff seemed clueless! It may take more than just big ads in leading mainlines for Yautacha to get it right in Kolkata.

I feel compelled to update my review of this restaurant.  The issues mentioned below have only worsened over time rather than improving.  Especially customer service.  
Food:  Great dim sum and desserts, (9/10);  Main courses were sub-par, (4/10).  

Service:  Friendly, slightly disorganized; was disappointed that one dish that was returned uneaten because of unsatisfactory preparation was not automatically removed from the final bill.  Although, it was removed immediately upon request, (7/10).

Ambiance:  Music was louder compared to other Michelin-star restaurants; floors were not the cleanest.   Some might find the temperature inside a bit on the chilly side.  Otherwise, good design, good quality dishware, glassware and silverware, (7/10).  

Cost:  Comparable to other high-end Kolkata restaurants; lunch for three (beverages, dim sum, main course, dessert) about 1500.00 rupees per person, including taxes and service charges.    

Miscellaneous:  Publicly advertised (in newspapers and with a big banner inside Quest Mall)  prix fixe menu was not available; some would call this false-advertisement and deceptive.

I went to quest mall on Sunday and was really delighted to see the restaurant for which I had waited since long has opened its doors. But alas! The experience was quite a let down. We saw the restaurant was nearly empty so went to the lady and asked for a table for two. But was shocked when she told that they are full and we have to reserve our seats over the phone. 
It's always good to educate people about prior reservations but in hospitality industry one cannot restrict entry into a restaurant when it's empty . We observed for another few hours but the restaurant was never full. I am not gonna spend my hard earned money on their attitudes they can keep their attitudes in their pockets. There are other premium restaurants in the mall with well behaved and cordial team, so why will I go to Yauatcha anyways.
