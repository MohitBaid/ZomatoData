Learnt about this place from zomato and was instantly impressed by the floor seating setup and obviously there were awesome reviews. So went there for dinner with a friend. Had no difficulty in finding the place ( thanks to Google map). At the entrance, the place looks like a house. There are two doors which lead to the two sections of the restaurant. One is "The Fat Monk" another is "Thakali". The former is the one with the floor seating arrangement, the latter one has normal seats. We went for the former. I had never been to a place with floor seating, so was awed by it. The ambience was nice with a touch of uniqueness. The seating was comfortable as there were cushions. We loved it. Overall the place was cosy. The place had four tables and was otherwise empty except for another group of four people. We ordered a "chilli bean rice" and a "chilli pork". The service was a bit slow as it took almost 25 minutes for the food to be served. Coming to the food, the quantity was enough for both of us. The rice was well cooked. The taste was very different from whatever we had had before, it was nice. The pork too was well cooked and tasty. The quantity was generous. Next up we ordered their "banana Nutella pancake" as I had seen people praise the pancakes in their reviews. It was mind blowing. The pancake too was unique. It was hot and crispy and was stuffed with yummy mashed banana and nutella and was super yummy. I just loved it. I feel my visit would have been incomplete if I hadn't tasted it.
So overall, good place to have slightly unique food. The prices are very affordable. Their pork items are extremely pocket friendly, plus good ambience. They did not have taxes when we visited which was before GST. The only issue is their service which is a tad bit slow. But I was completely won over by the floor seating and the pancake. A must visit.

Food is good, fat monk specializes in tibetian cuisine,

Ambience is sober.. 
Truly a HIDDEN GEM

Had eaten from their kiosk shop in front of City Centre. Heard about it shifting to BE-30. We gave a visit.
The place is literally small but the food is really delicious.
We had: 
Chicken wings in BBQ sauce- The sause was sweet with a bit of a tanginess. It had sesame seeds.
Pork Kothay Momo- It is basically a a steam momo with one side friend. It had the perfect taste.
The cost of each item is really affordable.
This place doesn't take tax yet so if you are on a low budget and love Tibetian food you must give this place a try and I promise you won't be disappointed.
Happy fooding ✌

Zomato needs to update the maps & directions given about this place . Though the address is correctly given the map is not . They have shifted from a kiosk near City Centre 1 to a small restaurant at BE 30 which is located near Tank No 4 . The place is divided into two parts - a Nepali food section named as Thakali while the Tibetan section bear the name The Fat Monk . Mostly visit the place for their mouthwatering momo & kothay ( a type of momo ) . Be it veg , Chicken or pork the momos are of real good quality & reasonably priced too.

Firstly zomato should seriously consider changing the location from city centre to block BE and their phone number listed just below the restaurant name here. The place did have a kiosk beside CC-1 but it has been shut and they have opened into A small 20 -25 people seating Tibetan and nepali joint located in Salt lake, block BE. The place is divided into 2 sections, one serving tibetan food & one named Thakkali serving nepali dishes and thalis. The menu is simple and to the point where customers are not confused as to what they are being served and the management is very humble. It has a cosy homely feeling. I had a little chat with the co owner and learnt that she is the daughter of my favourite restaurant Blue poppy owner and this joint is run by her and her friend ( not sure if friend or sister) but both of them are young entrepreneurs running the show. 

Now coming to food i had ordered for pork ribs, chicken and pork momo and piro alu dum. I absolutely enjoyed the chicken momos with the piro chutney. Was yum. The pork momos could have been more moist but it wasnt bad. The pork ribs for me was a disaster as it was not properly cleaned and trimmed. I noticed long coarse hair on the ribs which kind of killed my appetite. I like my meat well cleaned as am a hygiene freak and i am sure noone enjoys hair popping meat. Although it was quickly rectified and they were very apologetic but I couldn't enjoy the dish thereafter. The sauce of the ribs was way too sweet and lacked taste. I just felt i was having pork with bbq sauce or brown sugar syrup poured over it. They need to blend and balance the taste of this dish so that you dont end up feeling wriggly in your stomach . It also had good amount of fat and less meat so if the sauce is so over powering it can really make your stomach churn. I actually tried balancing the ribs with piro chutney. Coming to the alu dum, it was good but i have had better before. Since i have spent my school life in darjeeling , momos and piro alu dum was our patent food and adding too many methi seeds just made the alu little bitter. The seeds were getting stuck and was leaving a bitter after effect in my mouth which was annoying at times. Otherwise the alu dum was good. Their iced tea was relieving after all that hotness and spicy food. 

Price wise the place is really pocket friendly and i just wish they had trained their staffs well as because they had little knowledge about the food being served and every time i asked something the owner had to come to his rescue and reply.

Overall a homely atmosphere but still needs to focus on serving palatable ( taste & look wise) food. Hope they grow big to carry blue poppys legacy forward and create their own.

Hoisin Pork Combo tastes like the bengali sweet dish known as MALPOA. 
Quantities are too less for a fulfilling gastronomic experience. In other words, too tiny for a gargantuan bong tummy. 
Steam momos are too slinky. 
Not coming again, Fat Monk.

A small joint, but quite a good one. This one is just for takeaway and there's another one which has seating arrangements.
Momos are good, the bowls are a bit over oily and the pork dishes more or less taste the same. Overall the food is nice.
One thing I love about this place is their banana nutella pancake. If you are here, make sure you ordr one and it won't disappoint you I promise.

The Fat Monk is one of the rare places in Saltlake which serves authentic Tibetan food. I was invited here for a food tasting session, after the joint shifted from a kiosk to a casual dine in restaurant at Sector 1. 

The restaurant is more or less a 20 seater and has a very relaxed look. The seating arrangement is comfy and the décor is minimalistic. 

Coming to the food now. 

We started with Pork Kothey Momo, which tasted perfect. The momos had a generous stuffing of minced pork and were burnt on one side, that is unique only to Kothey Momos. If you want perfect momos, you can't give this place a miss. 

Next, we were served with the bomb of the evening! The Pork Ribs! Oh my god!!! This tasted out of this world. I haven't ever had such amazing pork ribs! The meat and the fat were in perfect proportion which made me extremely happy! The ribs were tossed in honey and sesame which added more flavour to it! 

The last item of the evening was the Bangkok Street Style Pancake which was stuffed crabmeat and was topped with spicy mayo! It was amazingly crispy and super delicious. Definitely going back for this particular dish! 

So if you're looking for a place in Saltlake that serves perfect Tibetan food, look no further, The Fat Monk is here. Satiate your cravings to the utmost with their brilliant and lipsmacking delicacies. Also, keep in the mind the very reasonable pricing!

Little nook hidden away in Salt Lake. Perfect for a cosy meet. Simple ambience, almost feels like a slice of a village home, which I love, I can be myself. Service is warm and polite and friendly. Now, we ordered hoisin pork sandwich, orange chicken noodles, chilli chicken wings and banana Nutella pancakes. My favourite was the noodles, light and fragrant. Chicken wings was a tad too hot for me, as I had a cold anyway. My sandwich was superb, it's am open sandwich with a lot of pork and a fried egg piled on the gravy-soaked bread. The pancake was unusual, it was a crispy fried pastry. The chocolate was dubious, wasn't sure if it was Nutella? 
But that slight bit apart, I loved the place. Going again so very soon.

The pork thali at Thakali is kind of ok, but the service sucks big time . I was always cynical of generous blogger reviews , when you are having free food, you have to sing praises , but this proved beyond doubt that some restaurants take their customers for granted after creating some initial buzz . You had to tell them 100 times for a refill and then you are told that they have run out of stuff. These guys are reluctant to serve water as well. Appalled by their hospitality, or lack of it !

The small counter got bigger & better flied from the streets of city centre 1 to the roads of 4no tank. Just get down at 4no tank in saltlake & go straight towards the city centre,it's just a few steps actually it's in the left-hand side of the roads.They open a bit late in the evening by 6pm.Coming to the ambience it's really cozy & homely.They have a special Japanese style sitting arrangements on the floor with cusions and tables.which is very unique.another area they have wooden chairs & tables.Also they play some Asian music.So for ambience a 5 out of 5.Coming to the service, they were really polite and service was in a ok speed not too fast nor too slow.so a 4 out of 5.Finally coming to the food, we had chicken kothay,Honey BBQ chicken wings as starters,for main we had Hakka garlic chicken noodle,& chicken noodle Bowl.They were all awesome.Special mention would be the chicken wings they were samcking licking good.To hatch all this down the stomach ally we had fresh lime soda & green Apple soda.so another full house 5 out of 5.Visiting soon.Also this review yet a special one as this is been my another land mark as this makes me expertise in saltlake sec 1.

I specifically wanted to try the pancake from this place.Ordered for a banana caramel pancake, chicken wings in chilli barbeque sauce and blue lemonade via Swiggy.
The pancake was so delicious with warm gooyey banana in the centre with a light caramel drizzle and  a soaled crispy outer layer,anyone having a sweet tooth will absolutely love this.The chicken wings were again very good,the chilli barbeque sauce was nice and spicy,the wings were plump and juicy and had a crispy outer covering.But the pancakes are the showstopper and a definite try for this place.

The small but elegant restaurant is tucked away not far from the main road, in one of the major cross-roads of Salt Lake. It is easy to locate and has an unostentatious look about it. The insides, tastefully decorated are divided into two parts - one with tables and chairs and the other with seating on the floor. We chose the former.The food we were served with a Thakali thali (we took one chicken and one pork) was mmmmm tasty. The daal, the pumpkin mash, the saag and the chutneys were divine and the pork and chicken dry curries were too good to do justice with mere words.
The ambience is very homely. We were late in reaching, so the place was practically empty. The proprietors, from Darjeeling, came and sat with us and we had a leisurely dinner and chatted with them about the food we ate and the ingredients.
Congratulations! We will be back.

Went there for a quick snack. We ordered barbequed chilli chicken wings and chicken chilli garlic noodles. Really really dissapointed with the food. The quantity of the noodles was really less,with really small and less chicken pieces, and had a distinct flavour of raw cabbage. Really dissapointing if ur paying 100 bucks for a road side stall. Coming to the chilli barbequed chicken wings, there was no sign of chilli, it was sweet and the taste wasn't satisfactory at all. Wouldn't recommend anyone to try these two dishes whatsoever.

I had heard of this place; a small establishment right across City Center 1 in Salt Lake. My friends said that they serve excellent pork dishes here, but I had my reservations. After all, having had lamb and pork in North Bengal, how good would this be? So, when my friends said that they will bring food from there for a party, I wasn't much excited. But then, when the dishes came served, I took a bite. And then another, and then I kept going. They had ordered the Chilli Pork and the Pork Shaphalay. While the Chilli Pork was hot and spicy, the Pork Shaphalay was sweet and juicy. They complemented each other perfectly. The next time when I called my friends over, I ordered from here again. And now, I am a fan. Personally, I have never been there. But the food speaks for itself. I wish I had taken a few pictures. I will surely do that the next time. In the meanwhile, do please go and taste some of their specialties. You won't be disappointed.

The kiosk looked very untidy and unsettled to me. The huge menu was eye catching and my foodie self surrendered to tasting the food here. I ordered for a chicken sapata sandwich and chicken wings. Didn't like the sandwich much but the chicken wings was just mind blowing. Its a must try item and should not be missed at all. I took the chilly barbeque sauce option and it was rocking. The pricing is fair enough. I just feel the place needs to be kept clean and hygienic.

This place looks more like a makeshift food stall than a permanent eatery , and is located right in front of the Just Baked cake shop opposite Bata, City Centre . The place is pretty popular , with people grabbing a bite on the go , thanks to its pocket friendly prices. The pork pan fried momo here tasted good, though the momos were slightly over fried. The serving time depends on the number of people waiting in queue, as they have limited staff here. However , the food is worth a try in this new kid on the CC1 block .

I ordered some home and was pleasantly surprised - the chicken wings had softened from a long journey, but the garlic and chilli glaze was absolutely delicious, and the wings were tender and moist. The momos were delicious, but the sauce provided was a lot less than what I had expected, and they forgot to give me noodles, and sent me fried rice instead (which was nice, so I'm not complaining).

Wonder why this isn't more famous! Located beside Just Baked,Opp to Balle Balle Dhaba. Other landmarks: CC1,Petrol Pump.
Cheap prices,good quantity and prompt service. No extra packing charges.
Have tried their sandwiches,albeit a little expensive for the quantity-they are yummy with loads of meat and cheese and filling.
Chilly pork is only 100,good quantity and good taste. A lot of fried rice.
Special mention: Banana nutella pancake. Yummy crispy pancake with loads of nutella and banana slices. Great dish,and only 70 :) worth a try
