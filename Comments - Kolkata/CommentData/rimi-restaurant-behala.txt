Nostalgia creeps in as I enter this place. This used to be our only dine out destination during childhood. Surprised to see that Ashok da, the old server is still there and was even more surprised to find that he recognised us greeted us with a smile. We ordered egg fried rice and golden chicken. While the former is normal, the latter is a speciality and should be tried. Six succulent pieces of chicken in a hot and sweet chinese gravy which again is full of shredded chicken and prawn. Loved the dish. The wall to wall aquarium is yet another attraction. Will definitely visit again.

This place is located very close to my aunt’s home, and my cousin used to frequent there a lot. I too accompanied her from time to time, and have always been amazed by the food....both quality and quantity! I have tasted only the Chinese cuisine, and be it their chowmein, fried rice, chicken or fish items – everything is superb; my favourite is golden chicken. I only wonder why it does not enjoy more footfalls. The ground floor looks rather dingy, but the first floor dining area is good enough; there is also a wall-to-wall aquarium with gold fishes which I believe is another attraction for me :)

It is situated near Ajanta. We ordered crispy chilly baby corn and chicken biryani. Quantity is sufficient where as quality can be improved. The corn was slightly under cooked. Biryani was so so. Service is good.

It's a restaurant located beside the ajanta movie hall. The ambience is pretty average and food quality is also average. The only plus point is that the price won't hurt your pocket. Won't recommend.

For some reason this restaurant is one of our choices  for any celebration. Only had chinese from here which may not be authentic, but it have a good taste. Quantity is good so is quality.  Hope it stays the same.

This place provides good food at low cost. Since school days i have been frequent here. The most unique dish here is golden chicken. The mixed fried rice and schezwan noodles are great too. Though the drums of heaven is a bit too spicy. Overall the chinese items are good.

Thanks to Swiggy that I even thought of ordering from Rimi!!! It's after 15 years that I am eating from this place.. We found this place 15 years back during Durga puja!!! I stopped eating here when they served chilli fish instead of paneer... But it was déjàvu when I ate the Chinese today..: the food was very good... The manchurian chopsuey and noodles... Good food easy on the pocket and good quantity!!! Note that I a veggie*... Now will order frequently... Thanks

This restaurant is right beside Ajanta cinema hall In Behala. Its is not as cheap when it comes to cost as it might seems

I came here for once when we were out of options , had no time. I had an American chopsey and sweet corn chicken soup. I was thoroughly disappointed with the cooking. I am sorry to say the food didn't taste good at all.

I did not dare order any main course meals so I am not able to write a further detailed review.

But they have a large variety of dishes which you can try and also they have meals on offer if you are interested.

Ambiance is not quite good , the furniture was small and crammed into small place and service was nothing to brag about.

It's a myth that they don't serve good food. I tried them tonight and I was satisfied. I ordered Thai Soup, which was superb. Full of meat, thick soup, spicy and tasty. Main course was also pretty good. I had Szechwan Fried Rice Non-Veg, which was nicely spiced, good quantity, colored well enough to entice you. The Garlic Chicken was sweetened to perfection. 6 pieces of chicken, meaty, however they were slightly hard, but tasted just great, and the gravy was delicious. The waiter was attentive enough. The place is equipped to seat 30 people at least at a time. It's a pity that localites don't visit this restaurant often enough. I would for sure try again. Decent food, at reasonable prices. VAT extra.

This could have turned into a great restaurant with such an advantageous location, right beside Ajanta Cinema...but this is really not that good place. The food is a bit below average. But if they want they really can improve in every area. Only positive thing coming to mind about this place is that it is a bit cheap.

Probably one of the worst restaurants except Chinese you barely found anything available.though I visited couple of times because its one of the nearest as well its never so crowded (may be because of their negligence) but still I wont recommend you because of lack of availability of items and service persons. 

Ps- one can spend hours with Hakka noodles here ;)

Went to the restaurant for dinner with friends. Hard to spot at night. Went in and felt like we were in a different world. The interior needs a LOT of work. Food was ok. Not bad. We ordered the chicken and egg rice, chilli chicken and Singapore chicken. Quantity was good and price was cheap. So overall I'd have to say it was an average restaurant. Not too bad, not too good. Just nice.

I have been to this place so many times. This is tucked away behind the bus stand in front of Ajanta cinema hall. For a chinese resturant these guys used to make the most amazing chicken bharta ever. But that was in the past. The quality of food has dropped considerably over the years unfortunately. I would love to see this place regain it's former status. Never the less, this is always a very good option for a quick takeaway.
