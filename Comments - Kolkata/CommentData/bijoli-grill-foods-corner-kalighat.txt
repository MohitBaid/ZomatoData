The quality of food was bad...really bad. Ordered through swiggy this evening....Chicken cutlet hardly had 2-3 minced pieces...couldn't believe it was actually "Chicken" cutlet...just filled with chopped onions for Rs.70. Next came Egg devil with mutton keema...that's what was written on the menu...but I could only taste plain egg devil with potato filling.
Next was Fish roll...it looked nice from outside...but for Rs.120 it was a total waste.
Didn't expect this from Bijoli Grill. I always have  liked Bijoli Grill food...but this particular outlet sells bad stuff.
No more online order again.

This is one of the food joints of my locality so visited this place a few times. It's located on the same footpath as of aponjon, a two or three minute walk from the kalighat metro station.  
This is not really a great place to have a seat and enjoy your food so takeaway is suggested. They are famous for their cutlets and other such fries . Their bhetki stuffed fish kabiraji is good, the other items in the menu are mediocre.

This is barely 50 metres from my place. This food joint is mainly for takeaway purpose, though they have a few chairs arranged in front of their joint. It has home delivery service as well. I have ordered from this joint a number of times. Their food is good. Though their quality of food varies at times, but you can't expect anything more than that at such a cheap price. 
Conclusion: This is a good food joint for takeaway purpose at a very cheap price!

They offer some combo meals and these are quite reasonable and filling. The chinese dishes are also tasteful. 
When it comes to bijoli grill, things that one should taste are the fish snacks. Starting from the fish orley to the prawn kabiraji, all of them are lipsmacking.

Ordered mutton biryani through Swiggy. The food arrived late. The biryani quality was not good. The mutton did not seem fresh, and had a weird smell.

The shop is located on Sadananda Road and is very close to both Kalighat and Jatin Das Metro station. That way it's very convenient to reach this shop. It is primarily take away but they have sitting arrangement for two to three persons on plastic chairs. The best thing is to carry or ask for home delivery. 

In one word the food quality is awesome. Great taste and particularly the Bengali preparation is the best . The Basanti Pulao , Kasha Mangsho and the Fish fry with French fries are mouth watering. One should try and the taste is heavenly. 

The Momo is also very tasty along with Chowmin  and  Chilly Chicken . 
I recommend this place.

Been here once or twice and tried their cutlets, kabirajis, fish fries, and momos.
The momos were terrible and was a terrible order. I particularly like their mutton kabiraji and mutton cutlet. Both of them are delicious and even the price is not too high. The fish fry was standard. 
Their main problem is that they take a very long time to serve the food and it gets troublesome if you are in a hurry. So keep that in mind.

Located on the same road as of Apanjan, I have noticed that this place remains mostly empty. Once everything got finished at Apanjan. So we had to come here to meet the cravings of fries in the tummy.
We had taken the Fish Fry and Mutton Kabiraji. The fish item had a thick coating with lots of spices. I didn't like it much. The mutton kabiraji was comparatively better. So it is okay to give a try when you're left with no other options.
