I was on my way home when I found this posh restaurant around the corner.. And honestly, I think I made the best decision.. The food here is lip-smacking and delicious! And to top that.. the staff here are delightful, happy people.. it's said the food becomes even more delicious when served by a smiling face, and you can definitely understand the meaning once you visit here.. So this has my 100% recommendation and is one whom I will preach out now! 

Recommended: KABULI PULAO (Chicken/Mutton) 
                               Kheer Ranjha and.. Mocktails obvio!

Tanduri Chicken is something that everyone  has had a thousand times.  But today l had the best tanduri Chicken of my life.  This was At a small And cozy  place At sector one salt Lake.  
Rasoi Villaa offer us a complimentary mocktail And that to was amazing.  The waiter brought in a couple of glass of smoking mocktail.  The waiter had a smile of pride on hi face As if to say ''ENJOY THIS PLZ" ☺☺☺
It was interesting to fine a mocktail smoking like that. 
The next was a tanduri Chicken which@ was ready yahi.  I am not sure but there was something special about it.  It wash@ cookie to Perfection And seasoned
erfection. 
Next we had a kandahari murgh which was Awsome. 
Just Perfect with the butter nun. 

Ill gie 5star to this small but brilliant property.

We ordered Anchari Sabzi and Garlic & Cheese Naan.The Sabzi was very good.It is a must order I will Say.Needs improvement in Breads.Naan was not that soft.Staffs were also polite.The problem was that most of items were not available and in Starters not a single item was available.

Had a very worst experience. Pathetic quality, stale foods which I had never experienced in my life. We order many some items for breakfast and they brought them made two days ago which one of their staff accepted. Seriously guys please don’t even think of going. People were also typical type like someone has brought them from a village. Don’t want to say more here but really wondering why the people spoiling there investment in such type of business when they are not concerned about their actions.
Please don’t visit by mistake.

Pathetic restaurant.. we ordered for tomato soup and malai paneer tikka.. both the items were cold as ice.. there is no supervision over the staffs and both the dishes were blanc.. we did not have the guts to order for main course.. so we left.. inspite of both items being completely wasted by us, they billed us for both the dishes without any shame. Dont waSte your money on this restaurant.. donate instead
