Ok... I was waiting a long time to write this review. Don't know why but I will try to be as unbiased as possible while writing this review. The reason behind of mentioning the word Bias is because I started visiting this place about 3years back and I haven't been able to stop yet. I visit this place from time to time, atleast once in a month is not just because of the place being just half an hour's drive from my place but also due to the Great Food and the Great Service that one can have and that too at such a small-scale place.

Food: In one word amazing. The quality and quantity of the food that you get here is better than most of the restaurants nearby and not just that but also the ingredients they use are fresh and on top of that the price is pocket-friendly. I would not use the word cheap but it is in a way pocket friendly. If you are a guy like me who loves to start from soup and end the course of meal with dessert then the bill you will receive will shock you as it will be 2 times as less than most other restaurants. 

The Service - The service provided by the restaurant staffs are always a factor to be considered while visiting a restaurant, be it a fine-dining or a simple one at the corner of the street. This restaurant in particular will not disappoint you when it comes to service. The staff at this place is friendly and will always look after a issue if you have any. 

P.S  - The only reason I am not rating this restaurant 5 stars is because of the lack of the size of the place. The should have upgraded the size of the place by now..

Anyways still a great place to visit and don't worry even though the sitting capacity is a bit less, no one should face any issue unless it is the festive season. :P

While pandal hopping in Behala,I came across this place near to the Behala Nutan Dal Pandal. They serve Indian and Chinese food. 
Fast selling items were Biriyani,Noodles and Rolls.
We ordered 2 Chicken rolls. The paratha was crisp and was a perfect match for the juicy chicken pieces.
Each Chicken roll cost Rs. 40/-

Food quality is very bad.. So as the service. They even don't provide proper plates, rather they give food on cheap paper plate. Don't go there.

I cannot fathom why this place has such a low rating. The chicken and the mutton biryani is by far one of the best I've had in behala. The special mutton biryani has generious portions of meat and the rice is super soft, delicious and non greasy. We mostly do a home delivery and the guys are pretty much on time.

not sure why this place has such a poor rating.... always did a take away from this place which is at the james long sarani four point crossing going towards 14 no.  bus stand.... bang on main road and this place probably has a seating upstairs.... took food after a long time from there n it was delicious at super inexpensive rates.... 8pcs of garlic chicken gravy,  a mixed fried rice, 2 lachha parantha and 4pcs of kadhai chicken cost me only 379 bucks..... and the qty was really generous.... the kadhai chicken was delicious.... the garlic chicken tasted sweet and not how it shud be made but nevertheless it was delicious too.... its open till late and recommended for take aways for sure

Located near the James Long Sarani crossing in 14 number Bus stand area, Handi Food Court offers a nice view in its upstairs seating. But the food quality isn't of the highest quality. The best part was the chicken pieces in chilli chicken were soft and unlike some other shops does have a good quantity in them.

Well i am a regular visitor of this food joint .  Regular means , at least once in a month if not twice. I am quite familiar face with the servers and they are sometimes naive but nice . 
if you are looking for  more or less tasty food with  affordable price . This is the place to hang around.
you can spent some time in homely atmosphere with your near and dear ones.  Usually i order Chicken Hakka Chow-min or Reshmi Kebab  with Roti. The ingredients are relatively fresh and you get the food in time. They accept PayTm and all cards with relatively small bill. 

But i would like to see some addition in menu like 'Chilly Baby Corn ' or ' Red Pepper Chicken'.

one downside , they don't have any rest room which can be set back for all food lovers.

Ps :- Please stop using Ajino Motto/Chinese salt  because it is a health hazard  chemical.

Situated just next to my house it's a good place to get food delivery whenever there is nothing cooked available at home. 
For snacks rolls are good enough and dinner - well they have a lot of things to offer but I feel their paratha and chicken tandoori are good enough to score big..... 
Chinese delicacies used to be good but now, they just lack the extra punch they used to have at the beginning.

Handi ... I think is a underrated eatery at present... Visited three times and the food is great... Satisfies your palate ... Biriyani, paratha,chicken tikka butter Marsala,mutton Kadai... Just awesome... Really mouthwatering mughlai dishes and surprisingly at a much cheaper rate than haji, tandoori darbar, and panna... But food is really good... Service is good... The place's ambience is OK... But the food makes it up... So to me a nice place to exploit... Its both pocket and palate friendly...

Its an old story. Had biriyani from this place long time ago. After that no biriyani from this place.

After i have literally stopped eating at behala due to dearth of good restos ( except jafran, marufaz and hatari ) , i have no idea how is this place now. The rating is simply of my previous experience.

The biriyani was quite below average. And as far as i remember it was not cheap. The quality didn't match the price

Sorry no pics cz the story is old and forgotten.

Heard of this place from my uncle. Gave it a try last week. Well to say the truth it's quite a small restaurant with seating capacity of around 16 in the first floor. The ground floor has this takeaway roll center. Wait time is longer than you expect & with only one waiter managing the dine-in area you can be assured your calls will take a time to be answered.
Chicken lollypop was not what I expected it to be nor was the fried rice. Will give this restaurant a pass when next time going for a lunch in behala .

If you are a biriyani lover please try biriyani at your own risk. The mutton is as hard as a rock with rose water/biriyani essence so strong that ruins your appetite. My next catch was masla kulcha and chicken butter masala and chicken bharta. The kulcha was average compared to the cost (you can get much better kulcha at a and hind dhaba in new alipore at nearly the same price ), the chicken butter masala was some other dish but not butter masala I bet and lastly the chicken bharta which was not bad. Next comes chicken tandoori , I nearly had the feeling of not having chicken tandoori ever in my life after having this one. Semi cooked tandoori was what I received as I opted for take away. If you really want to visit this place rolls are the only option you should go for.

Hong kong and schezwan chowmein is the must try for anyone who comes here i can bet u, u can't get a better hong kong and schezwan chowmein at this price anywhere in kolkata.

...the dining area is quite small so i would suggest to go for home delivery or parcel....
Another very appreciable speaciallity of this resturant that they customize their preparation according to ur choice if u want them to do so....

Pocket pinch:- 250 for two

Conclusion:- Quality food at pocket friendly price.
Hope they keep up the good quality for the people of behala :-)

I recommend to try Indian breads with Chicjen Handi spcl.. Chinese is palatable as well. It used to be a fast food joint previously which was somehow converted into a restro. U need to climd steep staicase to reach the dining area. Also they dont have proper trained waiters.. But food indeed is good. Worth a try if u stay nearby. Pocket friendly as well.

Location: It is located in Behala in the roy bahadur road when you head from Taratala(mani towers) towards the Mp birla school. It is located on the right side on the second maincrossing after you cross the big park. 

First of all, I had been to HANDI Food court this afternoon and my opinion totally changed. They were previously a very small fast food joint but with the low prices and good customer service, they have converted it into a restaurant type with prices a bit on the higher side. I previously used to home deliver my food but these days they have stopped home delivery services. 

Secondly, I had ordered Indian food but they had the gravy items but no breads. I was like "Shocked". Nevertheless, i planned to order Chicken biriyani and Hakka chow with Garlic chicken. I specifically mentioned the waiter to make the garlic chicken in the white gravy but all these food joints do is add tomato sauce with soy sauce and mix it and make it a "SWEET" Gravy. I was disappointed again. Nevertheless, the chicken of the biriyani wasn't tender at all and was hard to eat. The Biriyani Aloo was half done. The garlic chicken was very very sweet and the boneless chicken still had bone in it due to improper cutting and removing the bones. The hakka chowmien was on the oily side. I hadn't expect such a RUBBISH food from HANDI. 

Thirdly, Seats were cramped and it was not the VALUE for MONEY. 

To conclude, it was not just worth it. not happy at all. 

Suggestions: 1) Improve your services. 
2) Keep all the dishes.
3) Improve your dishes. 
4) Serve quality food. 
5) Keep replacing dishes and provide exciting offers.



----- 27 Jun, 2013 -----

Location:- Handi food court is located in Behala and has been serving for years. I always used to order for home delivery but they stopped it due to staff shortage. They had a small shop which they renovated and made it big. I get inspirations from these people :-P they serve Chinese cuisines and tandoori items.

Let's come to the point. The pros and cons of handi.

Pros:-
1) Food is tasty 
2) prices are damn cheap. You won't get chicken so cheap anywhere
3) tandoori chicken is very different and sizzling.
4) located near the main more so automatically attracts customers.
5) Staff is very polite

Cons :-
1) quality of food needs improvement
2) it can serve a lot better 
3) service needs to be faster

Rest all is well :-)
