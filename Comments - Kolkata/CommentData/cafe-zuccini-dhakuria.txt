I have been in this place a month ago and my experience was really bad. Starting from the entrance to the food and ambience was absolutely awful. First of all the cafe situated in a building where they haven't given any sign board of mentioning the floor number. It was really hard for us to find out the place. Now coming to the foods we had were Honey Mustard Shredded Chicken with Veggies, 1 Veg Coleslaw Rice, BBQ Chicken Balls, Veg Coleslaw salad, Lemonade. All of them were absolutely awful, not at all quality food and quantities were not sufficient enough to share between two

In one word it was just a horrible experience. It's a small cafe situated opposite AMRI hospital within an apartment. We had three nearbuy vouchers of 149 Rs and booked a table yesterday for today's lunch over phone. They asked whether we would take veg or non-veg when I called. Actually there were options also among the non veg items on their nearbuy menu but they didn't ask us at all about our choice of foods. As far as the nearbuy menu we supposed to have,
* Lemonade
* Shredded Chicken in Honey Mustard along vegetables
* Veg Colesaw Rice
* Chicken meatballs or Chicken fingers
* Salad
But they didn't even ask us about our choice and served by their own. First of all they served the lemonade which was not good at all with very less sweetness. Then after that they served the starter and it looked horrible just like a salad. We hardly found any shredded Chicken into that item. It was loaded with cabbage, corn , bell peppers and it was excessively sweet. In the main course the rice was tasteless with no proper flavors. The gravy Chicken dish they served was blunt in taste. No spice no salt just nothing. It seemed like disaster in our plates. They just forgot to serve us the salad. All our money went in vain for buying the coupons. Only the quirky decor is attractive. Don't be carried away by the good reviews on Zomato. It's not worth a visit at all. Very much disappointed. We left in hunger from this pathetic place.

Been today for lunch with my family at this new Cafe. Bought burger combo and rice combo meal. Plus we ordered masala pasta. Food is excellent. Not very spicy. Loved the chocoberry blast. Very quick & prompt service. Very reasonably priced. The best part that I liked is their homely ambience. I liked the decor very much, especially the thread bottles and the plant bottles design. Very aesthetically done. I would have enjoyed more with my friends.  Overall had a very good experience. Shall visit once again very soon.

Never ate such shitty food in my whole life.. It was burnt, tasteless and torturous.. I availed nearbuy voucher for a non-veg combo meal.. Why do they even open such eateries I wonder? Just to get their shutters down very soon I reckon.. Want to forget about the horrible experience I had here and less the said better.. It is s cafe within a bloody residential building! And I am sure the owners get their bloody maid to cook the food they serve.. I brought one of my frnd here, I was so humiliated infront of her.. After coming out this shit hole called cafe, we had food outside.. Beware of fake ratings! I also fell pawn to the 5 star ratings by a select few.. They must either have been on dope or surely they have some vested interest (may be relatives)!
