Well a pocket friendly place.
Has a wide range of ice creams and shakes.
Tried the Badam shake with vanilla ice cream
And special Badam shake. They're were fine, nothing out of the ordinary. Garnished well with a layer of cream and dried fruits and nuts. 
The Monika special chocolate ice cream was pretty ordinary as well. 

If you're low on cash and Would love a place to sit and chat visit this place. 


Also they don't offer any bills. This is kind of disturbing;bills should be provided.

Monika icecream parlour has variety of flavors that also at a very reasonable price. Minimum cost is 50 rs and maximum is 90rs...they have in their menu card icecream soda
         Fresh fruit icecream
         Fruit asalad with icecream
         Cold coffee
          Vegetable icecream
          Snacks
 The cold coffee was not that good but the icecreams were very tasty...the Cold coffee with icecream is of 70rs and the Monika spcl cold coffee is 90 rs...in this special one you get to choose two different scoops of icecreams of your choice and the one which is 70rs that comes with vanilla or butterscotch ice cream.
There ate sitting arrangements and fully airconditioned but its a small place. Bit anyways the food is good ...though haven't tried the snacks i.e
 Mc Cain
Sandwich 
Frenchfries‚Äîand many more
Thid is a very pocket friendly place situated beside the wow momo exide outlet.

I have been here innumerable times, had atleast 100 ice creams over here. Apart from the usual vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, butter scotch flavours, the blueberry, black currant and the 2in 1 flavours are the speciality here. Always recommended for a quick grab while shopping in esplanade area.

Today, I had a long day at college and was desperately searching for a decent eatery near Chowringhee. I was also accompanied by one of my classmates and we were almost on the verge of giving up! After our failed trials, we were returning back to our campus and that is when we chanced upon this new place.
Initially, we were happily greeted by a woman and eventually took our seats.I chose to order Pasta with red sauce. Well, to my utter shock, the staffs were least concerned about the awaited customers and were more into chatting away their boredom. The food came on a paper plate within a few minutes. Well, this place is a fully furnished parlour and the whole "food-being-served-on-paper-plates" episode was beyond our expectations.Anyway, the pasta tasted decent and successfully satiated our hungry stomachs. However, when we asked for a bill, they refused to give us one. I personally felt that they had a sheer lack of professionalism.
I hope they upgrade their services in the near future so that I can ignite a second thought about visiting this place, once again. Otherwise, a BIG NO! Authority, are you listening?
