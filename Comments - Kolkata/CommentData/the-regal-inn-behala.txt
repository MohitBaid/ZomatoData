The Regan Inn is a popular fast food centre for Parnashree locals. It is situated in the midst of Parnashree Crossing almost adjacent to Chopsticks.

Mostly ordered here are rolls which are fairly decent in taste. Saucy and hot in the inside with big chunks of protein and a fat piece of bread to wrap everything in.

This place has an open kitchen so you would get to see your orders in making. Sadly this place does not have a proper sitting area. Service is fast and Kolkata's street food essence is strongly felt here.

Negative: not much hygienic, especially during monsoon.

A roadside eatery to be precise in my locality. Rolls are nice as tasty, though. No sitting arrangement. Situated in a very congested area. Okayish place to have snacks or so. Needs a hell lot of improvement.

This is an awesome place. Very good food quality. You get very good quantity in less price. Please try rolls here, and also the pulao and laccha paratha.

Worst fast food stall ever. Ordered a double egg double mutton roll, told mutton roll not available. So went with the double egg double chicken roll for takeaway. Waited for 10mins after that my roll was ready. It did not have double chicken and the roll was full of dalda and the sauce was scattered all over the roll which made it very disgusting to taste. Also the chicken chunks were chewy and not tender. I will never ever visit this place again in my life. The chicken roll costed me whopping 48/- bucks. There are much better options for rolls in behala like arsalaan, panna's kitchen, haji saheb etc but definitely not this one. I am attaching the pic of the chicken roll. Look how disgustingly they served the roll.
