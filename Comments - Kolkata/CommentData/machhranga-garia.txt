The restaurant is located near Patuli Police station and it used to serve good quality food but, there sell is now dropping. Ambience is dull never liked much. Been there many times. Their Chicken Moghlai is must try. It's available outside for take away.

Ambience is pretty and cozy. Staffs are well mannered. Chinese is good here. We have tried almost every starter they have.mixed fried rice and gravy items are also good. Once we tried masala kulcha with reshmi butter masala, it was awesome.

It's a neighbourhood restaurant very nicely located. But it's empty most of the time. Tried to find out by ordering myself a mutton egg roll. My snack was okay in taste but I didn't find the person sitting in cash very friendly. Probably it's unwillingness to excel letting the customers go elsewhere. I would LOVE to buy this place, any financiers listening? Recommendation: NO

Shit ambience. Manager keeps watching stupid serials on the TV all the time with annoyingly loud sound that is bound to bother the customers. Waiters are confused and rude. Manager is absolutely obnoxious. Not a single dish tastes good here. To sum up, machchranga is equal to poop.

As my neighboring restaurant,for its defence I can say, Ogo "unnoto nasika" publics, don't expect a fine dine experience like "Mocambo" here ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. But if you are looking for a pocket friendly, tasty (again not your mocambo level ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) food in an ac restaurant this one is good.
Must try american chop suey (really tasty/fulfilling)
Tandoori chicken is good an tender.
Dried chilli fish, crispy chilli chicken ( some of the waiters call them "criPSy" CHICKEN ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)

WARNING:
biriyani is awful
Not a dating place.
You should just come here to fulfil your hunger after Having some fresh air in our beloved (newly renovated) jhilpar.

Must get a higher rating.i doubt this rating system of zomato.
Try their masala kulchas and reshmi butter masala.it will take you to heaven.chinese items are also good.they have decorated nicely in recent times.staffs are cordial.delivery is good too.and obviously pocket friendly.
Zomato must do something with their ratings which is just NOT TRUE.

Visit this place at your own risk! They have the pathetic service and whenever I had something from them, I had to suffer from bad stomach. I don't think they use fresh stuff. The restaurant is vacant all the time even after being at prime patuli more and the reason is their pathetic food quality and service...Visit at ur own risk!!

It's located just at the patuli more bypass area. The space is small...a few months ago it used to serve great quality n quantity dishes. But nowadays the quality is deteriorating. The price of the food items are very much affordable with the quantity. All over a so-so experience.

Its located at a prime location just beside the Lottery stalls at Patuli More. A medium-size restaurant just beside the busy road so everyone can catch a look. 

I am writing this review after a long time though. It was during the Durga Puja last year. I went to this restaurant with my very close school friend since we didn't have any option neardby to dine in. To our utter surprise there was not a single person in the restaurant expect the waiters. Anyway we were happy that we would get our orders served real fast. So we order Mutton Biryani. Since we were continually staring at the waiter. After around 5-10 minutes our Biryani were served. It was a relief that finally we could savour.

But we were disappointed. There wasn't any such taste that resembled the taste of biryani. Rice was somehow okay. The potato piece was soft though. And the important part, mutton. I was really sad after taking a bite. It was not tender enough. The smell of mutton wasn't even there. I don't if they have improved these days but that day I really had a saddening experince overall. 

Later once I had roll from here. Surprisingly the roll was made comparatively better. 

I will wait for you people to share your experiences. Happy eating!

Machhranga name seems typical Bengali restaurant where you can enjoy bengali rice & fish curry. But over here its totally opposite. Their menu card is full of Chinese & Indian Tandoor dishes.

Location : Machhranga is located at Patuli Crossing on EM Bypass Road. Near to Benu Bana Chaya Park towards Patuli Police Station.

Decorations : The restaurant is normal sized & pretty simply decorated. Red & brownish newly colored wall, some ball kind of chandeliers hanging from the roof, glass & metal table & chairs spread around. A small old fashioned CRT TV was their playing Bengali movie songs. Two spilt ACs were on a side. Lot of windows are there in the restaurant but all were covered. Overall all this creates a very simple ambiance.

Staffs & Management : There was only one person who took the order, served & was managing the reception table. They took quite longer than usual to serve our orders.

Foods : Their menu card was holding a big number of Chinese dishes so I ordered some basic Chinese food.

Chicken Chowmein : Chowmein was very thin & long. The quantity was somehow good & manageable for 2 people. There was very less vegetables & less chicken pieces too. Vegetables were nicely sliced where chicken pieces were very hard. It was also very oily. Overall the chowmein was spicy & for that it tasted good. 

Red Pepper Chicken : Red Pepper Chicken seemed Chicken & Tomato Soup to me. There was 8 small chicken pieces dipped into excessive gravy than usual. Chicken pieces were soft but it doesn't tasted that good. Gravy wasn't good enough & it didn't clubbed well with the Chowmein.

 Pricing : Looking at their food quality, pricing of every dish seemed little higher to me. Although quantity was kind of okay.

Conclusion : The restaurant is in a locality where other restaurants are at distance. Nothing excellent or exceptional is waiting inside. Very basic food for a little higher price tag. Not recommended if you aren't feeling too hungry being over there.

Years ago it was one of the best restaurant in this area, specialy for it's lake view. But now there is no lake view because they turn that area into a kitchen and shifted the restaurant on the other side. If you go there in the evening time you will see a TV on the right side of the restaurant and all the employees are watching star jalsa in it. And they will be busy with that sash bahu TV series by not attending the customers. Food quality is also average.

A small place in Patuli bus stop. We were frequent visitors for their rolls. However the quality dropped over the last few years. Prices are not that high but food is not great too. Parking is a hassle. No proper washroom. Clientile is very messy. Interiors is cheap. Staff not trained too.

Reshmi Butter Masala and Masala Kulcha.
These two dishes,i have tried here for almost 3 to 4times.Just Blissful.
My wife just loves the gravy here.
A must try for the reviewers who have rated such harshly.
Chinese here is average.
Fried rice is also decent.
Kebabs are good,infact Awesome.
Considering the fact that this is a highly pocket friendly A.C restaurant and without VAT or service charge,do not compare this one with other branded restraus.Go for the food.It wont dissapoint you.
Newly decorated recently,with a decent view of Jheel.Great service.
No idea about their home delivery service or their Rolls.

Paid a casual visit last month. The restaurant seemed too old fashioned from outside. They have a kitchen which is half visible from inside. The decor is a big 0, the interiors have not repainted since a very long time I guess. The waiters are not attentive at all and they were busy watching the TV. We ordered a fish platter and crispy chicken in the starters and Hong Kong Noodles and Red Pepper Chicken in the main course. The food was quite average though the crispy chicken was decent and had the right crisp. The Hong Kong noodles was of okay type tough had a rough smell of the oil used. The garnishing didn't impress me at all. The chicken side dish was not that bad and the chicken pieces were quite succulent and tasty tough the sizes were too small.

This is basically a fast food joint. When you are looking for quick service and average food you can go for this option.
This is just two minutes of walking distance from my house so I go to this place for a quick snack.

The prices for the regular things like chowmein and fried rice etc are overpriced with compared to the quality. The quantity is very good. The taste is okay.

The home delivery service is quick , I receive my deliveries within half an hour of placing the order usually.

Just an average place. Not too good not too bad. They have an almost visible kitchen from the insides of the restaurant. The ac is a little too old to keep the entire place chilled. However, the staff tries their best to please the customers. We were greeted with smiles and warmth while we entered and also when we left.

There is hardly any difference between the fish finger and the fish finger (special) except for the quality of salad that is provided with them. However, one plate is enough in quantity to serve two people for starter. Next we ordered a special chowmein, which was not too special taste or quantity wise. The sweet and sour chicken was not bad though.

Can be tried if you are around Patuli because this place is pocket friendly. Try and get a place near the ac and choose your food wisely. The service is fast and sweet. They would make sure that they provide you with their best.

Due to the proximity to my office, i'm a regular visitor of 'Machhranga'- one of the few decent dining options in patuli. Easily accessible as it is located in patuli more beside p.s.  Coming to the food, one can hardly complain about their cuisins. But also i will not exaggerate by saying 'very delicious food' or something like that. One common bengali phrase is enough to describe them and that is "Valoi, kharap noy"(good only, not bad). But their chinise is pretty good especially their speciall chowmein, its my favourite. Biryani and kebabs are also up to the mark.Waiters are well behaved. Prices are moderate. But have to mention the drawbacks. I dont know why they are reluctant to change the decor??? Its so dull compared to any restaurant in same standard. And the ambience!!  who has gave them the rubbish idea of placing a t.v inside the restaurant, is it a cafe or what!!! Thats why im deducting 1 rating, otherwise it deserves 4.5. Hope they will look into this. Overall a nice place for eating and time passing.
