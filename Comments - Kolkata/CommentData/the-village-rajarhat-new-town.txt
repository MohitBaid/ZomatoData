Not sure if there was any signage but we couldn't find one hence had a bit of difficulty in finding The Village. Due to lack of proper meal options at Ecospace, the probability of opting for this is high. The ambiance and decor was pleasant. The food offered in the buffet was okayish. Being a non vegetarian, we still managed to get best of both worlds. Some of the dishes were quite delicious like Coleslaw, Dahi bhalla, some fish item and worth a repeat but rest were average and meant to just fill the tummy. The staff was courteous however at times they could not fulfill the request of providing hot butter naan or likewise. 30th December being the last working day of the year for most people who work around the area, the footfall was apparently high which kept the staff busy resulting in some delay, we were told. Anyway, it will still be an option but not a die-hard choice. With respect to the overall experience, the bill (about Rs. 450 including GST per person) seems costlier.Suggestions: (i) Knife please along with fork and spoon!  (ii) There should be a separate table to place used dishes. I didn't feel great seeing that if people had to put away a used dish so that they can take a fresh one then both can be done from the same table.

Well this space is at Eco space. I am not quite sure why the restaurant bears the name, 'the village',  as there isn't much decoration in sync with the name. However, the buffet here is nice. Not too many dishes but whatever they served were good. Especially the fish items. Here please do not expect starters like flame and grill or barbecue nation, but overall it was a pleasant experience.
We had gone for a lunch buffet on a weekday. It had cost us 440 inclusive of tax. Well a fair deal it is!!!!

Went here for a buffet lunch on 16-11-17.The decor and feel was good.Well buffet for 475+ taxes in really easy on the pockets but when it comes to the menu..one might feel short of choices.Two veg and two non veg starters followed by the main course but what was surprising was only chicken items when it comes to non veg main course.They only had chicken stew and chicken curry.Well you expect at least an item of fish and mutton alongside a chicken dish.Coming to the desserts they were really nice specially the chocolate mousse.Hope to get more varieties in main course of non veg.

The biggest mistake I made recently is visiting the Village at ecospace business park. They serve buffet for 400+ and the menu they offer does not worth it... only couple of starters , that too one veg one non veg(fish). Guess u dont like fish what will you do??.... for main course rice pulao dal and fish!!! Thats it... I cant find chicken anywhere!!! It was terrible for veggis as well... they had rice chapati dal and cauli flower... 
 Never ever gonna visit....

There are not at all good options (nearby) of a sumptuous meal experience when your workplace is Ecospace. Whenever there's a team lunch, people are left with no other options than The Village.

An extremely average place with okay-ish decor. Their buffet doesn't cost much mainly because of the average quality food they offer. But their fish items are really tasty unlike most other dishes. 

The staffs are not at all nice. We found hair in tandoori roti but they behaved like nothing much has happened! Moreover, when we gave bad remarks in their feedback sheet, the staffs made us modify it to save their back!

Located in the vicinity of IT sector, this restaurant is common buffet option for all the corporates. A buffet here costs approx Rs.450 which is a very cheap option and value for money. The only downside is that they don't have a fix menu and thus the dishes (taste/preparation) change everyday throughout the week.

Variety of Salads:
Papdi chat / Dahi Vada along with lettuce salad and lassi consists of the salad section.
One veg/non veg starter: On two different days I tried Poha Kebab and Veg Kebab; the former was out of the box which I had never tried. Both starters were equally good in taste. The Non Veg section included Murgh Tikka which was also good in taste as recommended by my friends.

Main Course:
One Continental and two Indian dishes are most likely to be present. Since we were a group of 25, we asked the chef to prepare Kadai Paneer, Daal Makhani and Veg Lasagne in the veg section. Daal Makhani was tangy in taste while others were nicely cooked and rich in taste. The Non Veg section consisted of a Fish in Barbeque Sauce and a Chicken Item.

Desserts:
Misti Doi, Gulab Jamun, Baked Rosogolla/ Custard were the items in the dessert section along with Vanilla/Chocolate Ice cream.

I will give a thumbs up for the ambience, service and the village themed interior. The food quality and the price is unbeatable but a change in the course of preparation which further would enhance the taste is strongly recommended.

This place is well located inside ecospace. It's inside the ecohub . The place has good ambience. We had buffet lunch here with my team and with the pricing of Rs 350 ai it's a good catch. The food was good but with limited options. There was choice of two fish and one chicken. The staff was good and the service for hot rotis was good.

Have been there for first time with my colleagues. My experience was not so good.
Ambiance and decor was decent. But the food quality was average. 

They serve only two starters and some salads. One is veg another is non veg(fish). And no chicken item was available in starters. 
Again in main course only one chicken item was available, nither mutton nor shrimp. Inspite of being that rice, ruti, grill fish were there.
Desserts were quite decent in taste. Hot malpoya was nice.

Won't give more than 2 rating because of following reasons:
1. Opening time mentioned is 12  but they started only at 12:45. The manager asked us to wait as they were still preparing and arranging for buffet.
2. Only 2 starters one veg and other fish item(tasted very bad) were available. I expected at least one chicken item in starter.
3. Other items were just average, nothing so special except ambiance which was just decent.

The funny part is, this place was recommended by one of my friends and she took me there. This lunch was supposed to be my treat. But, she felt so embarrassed to take me there that she offered to pay the bill. 
I won't recommend this place to anyone.

Have been there for quite a few times with office colleagues and clients. Good ambiance, nice decor.

In terms of food and taste, I have seen some ups and downs of this place in my last few years. So, the current rating is based on my recent visit.

The place offers a lunch buffet in a reasonable price. It starts with assorted salads, raita etc. There will be two types of rice, two types of rotis, daal, two veg sides, three non veg sides and few types of desert.

In the last outing, the three memorable dishes are - okra salad (a crispy okra fry with some transparent batter), bhatti da murgh (actually chicken tikka but a bit spicier version), daal makhani (although looks simple but quite difficult to bring out that authentic taste).

On the downside, the "bhatti da murgh" chicken pieces were not boneless. Can anyone imagine square shaped kababs on bones?

Also note that they are not offering any complimentary drinks at this point. This should have been great considering the scorching summer.

An okay-ish dining experience. Their Paneer kebabs, Village naan and mutton biryani were the only items that really pleased us. The rest were all pretty ordinary. 
The decor is nice, and so is the service. 
But the place is too far and it's not worth going the distance.

Went for a team lunch here. Service was good but they need to improve the food quality by a quite some bit. We had the buffet lunch. There was a dedicated salad station. The pesto potato was nice. However, there was no clear starter section. They had lemon fish, chicken roulade, a chicken curry, malai paneer, aloo dum and peeli dal. They served tandoori roti, naan, plain rice and jeera rice with these. We didn't know what to pair the lemon fish and chicken roulade with. The lemon fish however was my favourite item in the spread. Dessert was limited. They had baked gulab jamun which was a tad bit too sweet but went well with the vanilla ice cream. Wasn't overly satisfied but would expect better next time!

Had been to this place for lunch during my official meeting at Eco Space. 
Had lunch for two subsequent day, and noticed the menu to be entirely different which I never thought while entering for lunch 2nd day.
Offered quite decent quality food, be it starters, main course or deserts and the staff behaviour seemed to be courteous enough. Being buffet, the variety/options felt to be a minus. Whateva, I loved the sweet boondi n jalebis.
The ambience felt to be good with loads of painting around and some art pieces trying to give a villages' theme.

Overall, quality food and good ambience for the subjected price tag for the buffets !!

Situated at ecospace , the restaurant provides cheap buffet for corporate gatherings and parties. I went there on the occasion of one such gathering. Ambience is good , nothing unique or creative but good enough to accommodate large gatherings and parties. I have to say starters were below average. Only veg starters were available Options were less compared to other buffet restaurants i have visited in town. Main course was satisfactory with normal butter chicken , butter naan, fried rice, lemon batter fish... For the veggies there were paneer and aloo matar.. Very limited options.. For the desserts they kept vanila cake and gulab jamun.. Taste wise they were good , nothing special.. Choices were very limited for a buffet. But considering the amount charged for buffet this can be accepted. They should focus on improving their menu and including better items for starters and desserts. Taste need to improve too. Only option to avail for parties when you are looking for a super cheap buffet .

We were a group of 4 . They told us they will clear a table for us . A group of 8 people went after us and they were allocated our table table as it could accommodate 8 people. The managers their told us to adjust in a table of 2. Plus , there were not even communicating with  us properly. This kind of  service is not acceptable.

Better not be here , unless you prefer unhygienic food for thick cash. Had buffet for 350 (taxes extra) . Not worthy , I know standard buffets are available in barb-Q-nation , sigree global for 600 onwards. But also had Since 2016 and Irish house buffet for 325/330 and they were much better. Almost no variety .. veg cold starters. Only basa and chicken in main course with rice and some rock hard roti. Experienced flies beside a warmer .. and found one floating in gulab jamun.Pathetic experience. They also trick you with the bills , take 15% as VAT.

Went there on Tuesday for team lunch and had buffet, Thanks to my Senior colleague for the treat. food was good, but option was a bit limited, no mutton dish. Probably can add a few more sweets. Decor was very nice, and options for salad were great. Kashmiri pulao turned out to be a bit of of a let down.
But for this price it will get a thumbs up from me.

Better not be here , unless you prefer unhygienic food for thick cash. Had buffet for 350 (taxes extra) . Not worthy , I know standard buffets are available in barb-Q-nation , sigree global for 600 onwards. But also had Since 2016 and Irish house buffet for 325/330 and they were much better. Almost no variety .. veg cold starters. Only basa and chicken in main course with rice and some rock hard roti. Experienced flies beside a warmer .. and found one floating in gulab jamun.Pathetic experience. They also trick you with the bills , take 15% as VAT.

Quality and taste of the food was not  satisfactory. Ambience was very good... Hospitality moderate... Budget wise ok.. must improve the quality of food..

If you feel like going for a long and pleasant drive and eating out on a Sunday, then, this is the place to visit. The drive is comfortable, minus the weekday heavy traffic yet not too far away. We could find this place easily as the directions were clear. Once we reached we were happy with the ambience, outside there was landscaped greenery with lovely white frangipani flowers greeting us in all their glory. Inside the restaurant, in keeping with the name, the decor had a rustic appeal with jharokas and pics on the wall. The Sunday brunch theme was coastal flavours. ( excellent... we got to try new flavours,some new names but known items!!!) Started with the soup which was mulligatawny (good). At the salad bar there was cabbage salad( mixture of fresh veggies..good),fresh garden salad, a coconut- carrot salad( interesting). There was also an assortment of chutneys and pickles. But the hero at the salad bar was the Idli salad( fusion dish of fried idlis tossed in veggies and sauces...awesome). The mains were somewhat of a disappointment ( becoz of limited veg options). There was a veg cutlet( with an exotic sounding South Indian name)..ordinary in taste. The Paneer pepper fry was good as was the potato vindaloo( veg makeover of a non veg speciality) There was a Brinjal preparation( tasted like baghara baigan but had a different name), which was tasty. But only one type of bread...Malabar paratha ( flaky and good ). Lemon rice was a bit dry and bland. The desserts... Coconut pudding was excellent, while payasam was somewhat less sweet. They had regular chocolate icecream( could have had a coffee ice cream or lime flavour ice cream or even coconut ice cream, in keeping with the theme) Overall it was a good meal, but the service was not up to the mark, items were not replenished immediately. But for me, the day was made as they were giving a great discount to all Mothers who dined. (Mother's Day Celebrated...Thnx !!)

It is just opposite to my office. Frankly speaking went there 2 to 3 times. Good quality buffet with whelming customer service. Some times refilling is a bit slow. However, the taste of food compensated it. Will recommend this place for ambiance, and it also provide good value for money ratio. You can get really a lot of items and deserts in around 350 INR.
Cost for two 700* INR.

You want to impress your guests right when in hospitality? well my friends who are in charge of this place probably thinks otherwise, and were ready to welcome us with cold starters(that too self serving), limited main course options of two fish items,and one chicken item..there were 3 veg items as well, one rice and paratha/tandoori rotis.Oh wait, did I mention there were only veg starters, no non veg starters? desserts were only sweet tart, bonde and ice cream.  Honestly speaking, I did not have such a bad time in an office lunch for a while.

I understand, in 350 you cannot provide us a barbeque nation, nor an oudh..but guys, the customer base you have targeted are the IT people of ecohub DLF2 and geetanjali, why to keep the bar low and dissatisfy then? My suggestion would be to restructure your buffet menu and increase both the options and the price. People are never unhappy to pay for a decent meal...that too in such a close proximity

Being in the Ecospace IT hub it gets a regular visit from the IT specialists. I have never tried their ala carte menu. It has been a year I came to this area and already visited this place 3 times. The buffet is a complete package of good food. On the level of taste it is not too great. But al that price its the best one can get. It is worth 3.5 rating.

Went here to have lunch buffet today with family.I love the place and ambiance and the feeling was very homely.The restaurant was also well decorated.Coming to the food, the quality is not at all bad.There are not many varieties but whatever food were they were good.But they have to improve more to come into today's market competition specially in Kolkata.I am satisfied with the taste and the buffet is Very pocket friendly. If you want to go for a low budget buffet, you can go to this place once...:)

Had a team lunch at village this Monday. We took buffet and unlike others, it does not have any starter. The menu includes salads, three non-veg, four veg side dish along with luchi, kulcha, pulao and steamed rice. Baked Rosogolla was added as a desert, but it's not comparable with one from Balaram mullick's. Overall decent taste and pocket friendly to customer -Rs 350 w/o tax etc. Ambiance is good. Recommended for casual lunch.

Went there for the lunch buffet to have our team lunch on this Wednesday. The place is beautifully decorated and sitting arrangement was also good. But the food was not upto the mark at all. There were no non veg starters only some veg salads. Main course had only two options of fish and one preparation of chicken and also deserts were very limited. I only liked the chicken, grilled fish was okay and a veg dish aloo do piyaza was really very good. Cost wise okay.

Bring located close to our home went on an evening to celebrate an occasion with better half. The decor is something one can look forward too. Menu is limited and among that limitation every items were not available.

Waiters took ages to have attention at our table. Came to ask for orders rather serving water on table first.

We ordered Murgh Lababdar and Garlic Naan. Food was sumptuous and finger licking good. 

If they improve their service then the restaurant would have been in different genre by now. As this is part of Eco Space club here non-members of club are allowed.

The Village... ya absolutely.. if we are talking about Ecospace it suits well! Though  corporate campus of this locale is spellbounding...the problem of conveyance still exists...!😡😢
When The Village came up the corporate employees working within the campus had gone hush hush about this new eatery... nearest possible place to have team lunch!
Enough of background..now coming to business...
Its a compact place with neat and clean presentation.. very corporate ambience during lunch time... nice!!
Now coming to FOOD... it is OKEY..!!

Lesser spread compared to other places... and no separate starters on the table! The starters , salads, maincourse and desserts are available as buffet spread... Good Quality, Good taste and value for money.. 
This is the perfect place for low budget buffet.. 
👍👌

Been here on Sunday evening. It's located bit far for South calcutta people. As the name says it has village kind of ambience. They offer you dandiya sticks to dance, puppet show etc. They offer good variety in both veg n non-veg. Food is decent n they need to improve on it.

'The Village' with colourful interiors is at the ground floor of Ecohub inside the Ecospace campus. This restaurant is a good option for an economic buffet at only Rs. 350 + extra taxes (on weekdays).

The ambience inside is decent. Good hospitality and response of the staff made us comfortable to choose our menu.

The buffet spread here is decent with respect to the 'economics' of a safe wallet!! 2 Non-veg dishes, each of chicken & fish, were a part of the buffet spread having rice, roti, salads, veg dishes, desserts etc.

We ordered some kababs 'al-a-carte', as the buffet did not include starters. Though the dishes served were good, it didn't give any extra scintillating memories to our taste buds!

Tip: Recommend to visit the place on WEEKDAYS (as it is economical on weekdays) if you stay or work near Ecospace/DLF 2 area.

The place is at the eco club at Rajarhat new town.. They serve lunch buffet at a very low price.. But I feel they should add some more non veg item to the menu as only one type of non veg item is available.. Food wise its not more than ok.. And dessert section is still better... Service and gestures are good I appreciate.. But have to be more versatile if you want to give tough challenge to the l competitors in market..

I was looking for a place to give my birthday treat, and suddenly I found "The village", nearby to my place.. The food was average but the ambiance was above my expectation. You'll truly get the vibe of a village.. They have a lot of activities to get you indulge into.. Allover, I had a mind boggling experience..

The ambience of this place is good, nice & cosy. But the buffet menu is not so good, there is no starters which is quite a disappointment.

Even the desert section has only icecream, pastry. They can do better.

Please change the menu
