If there was anything like negative review I would like to give. Never think of visit this place. You would experience the wrost ever place in terms of service. The behavior of service man or waitor is wrost. Thier behavior is as if they are objaling us by serving us. Best think is you yourself go and experience their behavior. Or else you will not understand.

I have visited there & had a bad impression about this club type restro. First of all, service was really slow. They have taken order after 15 Mintues. We orderd Chicken tandoori(half),crispy chilly babycorn. Tastes were delicious bt quantity was bit less. Piecess of chicken were too small. But price is 220+gst.They were giving food in thermocol plate. May be this was for puja's crowd,bt on that day, restro was allmost empty. Even beside our table, I observed fried rice has been served in such a less quantity & In thermocol plate. Ambience is average, bit noisy. I will never visit again.

The worst restro i have ever visited..I have never left a negative review in my life and I do realize that this is not a five starred restaurant, but dear me, I also think that you can expect some sort of standard when you go out to eat. Unfortunately, the standard at this restaurant was very poor. Where do I start? Having entered the restaurant, we had to wait for several minutes to be seated,The menu cards very ABSOLUTELY disgusting, covered in oil and all sorts of dirst with the foil peeling away from the paper .
 I will never go there again !!! It was terrible !!!Don't be fooled, this place has nothing to do with good food, and the service was very poor.

A decent place to have snacks or dinner. Though it's not mentioned here, but they currently are also serving alcohol, and that too, descently priced and easy on the pocket.
Overall, a great location and nice place to spend your evening.

A restaurant very strategically located, beside the Kalighat metro at Rashbehari more.

We have ordered various dishes out of which the Kebabswas very delicious. The amount which is given is well enough with the given price.
Also, the mixed frice and chicken tikka masala upto the mark and hence, its very good to carryout small gettogethers and meetups with friends at this Restaurant.

Situated strategically at the Rasbehari Avenue crossing, this place is just ok for a fast bite. One should not expect a fine dining experience or high quality food here, If you are in a hurry and just want to grab a mouthful without a pinch on your pocket, then this fits the bill... we opted like wise for french fries and chicken hakka noodles ...average, but serves the purpose

I went to this place with my cousins day before yesterday after watching a movie in Lake Mall as it was the closest eatery place. We had ordered for mushroom soup and fresh lime soda for starters. The soup was really delicious. The lime soda was just about okay. We had ordered for chicken hakka noodles, chicken fried rice, thai chicken (gravy) and chilli chicken (gravy). The main course was quite disappointing. The dishes tasted very average. I will certainly not recommend this place to anyone for main course.

If you go by the name with hope to see lush green scenic view your are doing it all wrong. Located on 1st floor of a building at Rash Behari more. It's weird that although a such good location the footfall is to the minimal. Altogether there just one staff will take orders and serves and greets you when you enter. Highly unprofessional who doesn't even know when to take orders and when to serve. Food tastes nice and fresh. Quantity is kind of less as per price is concerned. Service is astonishingly fast.

Located right next to the Kalighat metro, the only green view this place offers is the sea of green Auto rickshaws right in front of the restaurant. The décor is average and so is the menu offered. I tried their Fish fry, Chicken Mushroom Fried Rice and Thai Chicken. I cannot say that the food was terrible, neither was it superb. It was just average. I do not know if I will revisit this place again. The location of this restaurant is superb and they could have done much more with the décor and the food. Since it is a new place, I would give it a benefit of doubt.

First of all letz start with the ambience which was ridiculous. Next comes the food. The cook served us with a blanched soup which had a pale taste and so called crispy chicken which was quite soggy. It was not at all crispy and later on when we asked whether you call it a crispy chicken they had nothing to say. And the time which they had taken was more than 45 mins and at last we had to leave the resturant with a hungry stomach with no regrets from their end. Seriously the worst restraunt i have ever went to dine. The cook needs to learn the basics of cullinary again from scratch.

We went to this restaurant for the first time tonight. Environment was neat and clean and I was delighted to see the seating arrangement with comfortable sofas. We ordered chicken hot and sour soup , jeera rice, chicken butter masala and fresh lime soda at the end. Soup and chicken butter masala was good . Jeera rice was the best . Quantity was more than enough for two.  Our bill amount was Rs 440. The price of the food in the menu is inclusive of all taxes. I am satisfied with this place because of  good ambience with good quality and quantity of food at cheap prices. I would like to go back the restaurant during festive season.

for some reason i like this place, and in spite of the mixed reviews about this place, somehow, i've been there quite a number of times. food is good and reasonably priced. moreover, if you're here in a group of 3 or 4, they'll let you have a go at the dart board and carrom board. the waiters are nice people, i have been there with my family, my friends and my fiancee in different occassions, haven't been disheartened even once. there is however a slight problem, if you're travelling in a car, finding a spot to park might be a challenge, my suggestion would be the by-lane behind the restaurant which is parallel to S P Mukherjee Road. It stays empty more or less, so its calm and quiet and quite enjoyable.

Date of visit: 
31st December 2015

Why did I choose this restaurant: 
me n my hubby went to park Street. We returned to raahbehari by metro. After getting out of kalighat metro station ,I found this resto located just opposite to the station. 

Inside the restaurant:
Though it was new year eve it was almost empty. Only two tables were occupied. There was only one waiter who was attending all the tables. 

Food ordered: 
Ordered dry chilli chicken, butter naan and chicken tikka butter masala.

Taste of the food:
Dry chilli chicken was not so good.  Naan tastes like sweet bread. Chicken tikka butter masala contain smell of coconut which I did not like.  It didn't taste like usual tikka butter masala.

Pros:
If you want to avoid crowd, you can come here. But don't expect good food. 

Cons:
Food bad.
Single waiter to attend. He forgot to serve us water.
Nothing special or great about the restaurant.
