First of all thanks to Very Berry for sending me the Chocolog hamper.In it there was a chocolog cake decorated with christmas theme and along with that came some almond flavoured chocolates.We tried both of them and they tasted quite good.The log has the perfect balance of chocolate and bread which made it even more tastier.

Food-4/5
