This place is a pure nostalgia for me. Being a pointer, this is a store where I have been since childhood. Be it their radhaballavi or kachori, the items taste exactly same as they used to 15-20 years back. They have been able to stand the test of time truly with top notch quality and service.

Went here innumerable times when I was in South Point. Always liked the place.  All of their items are remarkable in taste especially the kachori, radhaballavi, dahi bada and potol sandesh. But the items are overpriced. And now, I feel both the taste and quality have degraded a bit.

Popular sweet and snack corner in South Kolkata. It's pretty expensive for a corner shop. It's popular for its kochuri and samosa. Sweets are not the best.

This place gives you a similar exlerience to the riadsidw kachori shop we grew up on. The only difference is, it simply glorifies the experience. When the others shops are boring you with the same old Chinese and other Asian cuisines. This place gets you probably the best kachoris in the city. I was returning by foot. Yes thats the only time I could get to this place despite passing it twice a day by cab. I ordered kachoris, 2 for 30. Do not get fooled though. 2 are equivalent to 4 if compared with a normal shop. The curry they gave was divine. I went to order samosa, cause it was revisiting childhood. The samosa reminded me of the evening snacks we indian are technically forced to grow up on. But then again its life and not everything is perfect, and the gulab jamun did prove that. It was horrible. It was everything but not a gulab jamun. So skip it. Specially when they re taking 10 rs for one. The samosa though could have been a tad bigger at rs 15.

This snack shop is located near my school, so have visited this place many times. Do try the famous hing kochuri there. It's worth the hype. Among sweets my favourite is Gajar ka halwa, it just melts in your mouth. At the end , have a good cup of tea. :)

There are some Sunday mornings when you don't care about the calories you consume, and put your fitness goals to the backseat. Went to this place with four hostel mates on a Sunday morning. Hogged and dominated Jalebi, Hing Kachori(North Indians know this by the name of Poori and Aaloo subzi with hing), Samosa, Lassi, Dhokla and chai to end it all. I must vindicate the rave reviews that I read about this place.   There is no place to sit here, but I guess you don't mind when you have single minded focus on food. Reached there quite early and enjoyed the freshly made things. Totally worth the price charged. Highly recommended.

Tasty Corner is nostalgic place for South Point Passouts indeed .They have witnessed tbe metamorphosis the place went through . We, bengali's have experience of being defamed with out machher jhol connection pretty often . But some of us are vegeterians . Infact , we can choose a delicious 100% veg snack over some non veg in itz average avatar . Tasty corner is much more than just a sweet's  corner and perfect place you can eat delicious indian snacks and end up with some delicious sweets .Mishtiukh matters after all . 
Tasty corner's famous Radha ballavi served with sweet n chili achar is delicious . I must say you get affordable snacks here . You do not get sitting arragement but for snacks this is an ideal place . Lassi here is seriously amazing . If you visit this place in winter try their kesar tea. This place serves 100% vegeterian food so ... if you are consuming veg during navaratri time Tasty Corner is a place for you . They keep juice, flavoured cold coffee and soft drink that launches in the market , so i this place is loved by kids too.

A nostalgic association for me. Being a pointer this shop is connected to me as an integral part of my school days. Used to grab a plate kachuri n sweets from here on way to tuitions from school. 
The shop since then has changed to a better decor and added many items to its kitty. But that hing er Kachori is still the best. I am being a little biased in giving it 0.5 marks more than it deserves simply because of my nostalgic factor.

One of the biggest heritage food stalls of Kolkata, tasty corner does not need any introduction. Located in the bylanes of Ballygunge, close to South Point junior school, this place is ideal for quality indian snacks. They offer a wide variety of sweets, from enormous rasgulla to yummy goja. One must try their Kachori Sabzi, and the very famous malai lassi. Might seem a little overpriced but the quality of food surpasses it all

This is a place in ballygunge where people from all over the locality flock to explore the traditional breakfast delicacies. This place serves excellent kachoris and dalpuris with some lip smacking sabjis. There is a man outside the shop who is only focused on dealing with the customers who want tea so that is a good idea for diversifying the total crowd. People with sweet tooth will find this place very interesting as this place has a lot to offer starting from hot gurer rosogollas to large jolbhoras, the list is endless. Do check into this place for a wonderful experience of breakfast :)

But the problem is with pricing. It was not so a few years ago. But nowadays they charge inexplicable amounts for simple food items. Quality is good no doubt. But there is no parity between pricing and quality.

With a brother who is a Pointer (Student of South Point) you can very well expect that this joint has been a staple in our growing up process. With my morning school and his afternoon, it left me with time to often pick him up from school on his way back home in the evening; and en route eat to our heart's content at Tasty. Those were days when we weren't counting calories and oil or spice in our food (well, I still don't when it comes to real good food); and so the shingara kochuri and the mishtis were enjoyed full heartedly without any guilt pangs.  From today's perspective, parking may be difficult right in front of the joint.

Mandeville Gardens, a posh area - back in the days, (I mean the 90s) was known for its picturesque small houses which later gave way to elegant luxurious multi storey buildings.
Tasty Corner was a small snacks corner located at the beginning of the lane, serving kachoris to the little kids of South Point School. As the little ones grew and went to join the seniors in their Ballygunje place SPHS branch, they never forgot to visit the corner again. Sometimes mom used to pack our tiffin boxes with pedas and Kaju barfees, and I still remember my "bainas" (English: pledge and request) for kachoris. I still remember that I had my first fountain Pepsi here - Old memories coming out from the Nostalgia Box

Coming down to business, kachoris for breakfast and tea and to team it up with try the Amritis and Jalebis. Your kachori experience in the winters will be incomplete without a cuppa tea. Sweet endings to be taken away are barfees and pedas.

Ok fine I know its tasty, hygienic and so on...but have you ever look the price?  They charge '50 rupees' for 1 piece of dahi vada!!! Its just too much. There are  lot of good food stalls serving same quality food  in kolkata!!! My friends got a huge shock after seeing the size of dahi vada comparing to price. vegetable chops, gravy for the kachori were good though.  Not a good experience.......never again ..........

Being a student of South Point this is one place that I have literally grown up with. Located in Mandeville Gardens, I believe they serve one of the best kachuris in Kolkata. Years have passed since I have left school but the love for this place has only grown. So much so that it has become a nostalgia. The taste and the quality remains the same till date and does take me back to those wonderful childhood memories. Their Hing Kachuris and their Jalebis are an absolute must have when you are there. They have a wide assortment of sweets too which are also pretty delicious. Pocket pinch is reasonable and I think it's the best place in the area to satisfy your hunger prangs.  Highly recommended.

Everything you eat at Tasty Corner is really TASTY. Tasty corner stands out for its famous kachuri- sabji which will rule your taste buds and ask for more. Kolkata has an eternal love for kachuri and it is at Tasty Corner that I have had the best, fresh and hygienic kachuri of my life. 😊 At Tasty Corner, spices are the variety, be it hingh kachuri, Matar kachuri, they have all. And aloo sabji has perfect blend of flavours. They also serve free chutni. Jalebi is also very tempting, so are the other sweets and you can't resist to taste one. Tea, coffee is also very refreshing and served hot.
No seating arrangements but one can park their cars and bikes to eat inside in comfort. It's always crowded but the staff never loose their patience and take order with love.

I have wonderful memories of this place when I was in school. Our school bus used to pass everyday from this place and the smell of the sweets and samosa was so tempting. Once a week all of us in school bus used to collect money and then request our driver to stop for 10 min so that we could buy samosa and amriti. The samosa with their sweet chutney is just awesome. This place is famous for its kachori, jalebi and amriti. If you are in neighbourhood do stop by to grab a snack.

Anyways, coming to the food, I really didn't have much expectations (may be due to the outer appearance of this place) . But their kachuri had proved me wrong. Trust me, it was one of the best kachuris that I have tasted in last 5yrs.

I can vouch for the name and you should try it out. Amazing kachori sabzi, samosas and sweets. This place should be known for its savories which are Kolkata trademark delicacies and which you will find only in Kolkata so it's highly recommended. Only thing is it's not a sit n dine types place and you have to stand and hold your plate while eating which I eating is perfect for eating kachori sabzi. 😊

This place should be known for its savories which are Kolkata trademark delicacies and which you will find only in Kolkata so it's highly recommended. Only thing is it's not a sit n dine types place and you have to stand and hold your plate while eating which I eating is perfect for eating kachori sabzi. 😊

This place is having a great collection of bengali fast foods and sweets, snacks...almost like a smaller version of haldiram, but taste is positively better, I loved the Kochuri/alu dom/ lassi, jelabi...suggest to visit at least once if you are around ballygaunge

This used to be one of my favourite evening snacks joint when I was in high school. Everything starting from the fluffy hing kachoris to the hot gulab jamun and the rasmalai is a pure treat to the taste buds. Is a must go for every foodie in ballygunge area.

Tasty Corner takes me back to 90s - early 2000s and along with that, a nostalgia of sweet memories of School Days shower over my heart.♡ Situated near South Point School & South Point High School (Mandeville Gardens/ Ballygunge Place), this place used to be our 2nd school canteen. This place always used to be flooded with our school students. The most popular and favorite pick of students were the Hing Kachori and Radhaballabi.

Ah well, what can I say about Tasty Corner. I am from South Point, so that should say it all. Still, I will be specific about it. No pointer in the world will ever forget the steaming shingara with chutney, or the hing kachuri with alu sabzi and chutney, and ending with a pantua or some sweet. It is perhaps the most nostalgic eatery in Kolkata - quite literally actually. I've been seeing this place since 1993, been a customer for at least 15 years, and I have never been disappointed.

Tasty Corner is much much more than a sweet  shop. For some its about the sweet and spicy memories from their school lives. And for a good some, it is a permanent fixture on their food calendars because there is tasty food around this corner, always. Listing some favourites: 
All time favourites - Kochuri ,hot out of the stove, into the cane basket and onto your plate. Served with aloo sabji. Follow ii up with a big juicy jalebi. Sip the hot masala tea. They sell about 100 cups in 2 hours!

Winter favourite - Mirchi pakoda. Mind blowing. Stuffed with spicy aloo mixture, just one is good enough to make you a fan and you will be back every winter. Followed by hot  creamy sweet chai

Summer favourite - Rich creamy lassi

Monsoon Favourite - Veg or paneer cutlet followed by coffee sprinkled with cocoa powder on top. 

While dhokla, samosa, idli are available this 100% vegetarian outlet, it is known for its snacks(mentioned above)/ chai  and the wide range of sweets. Don't get intimidated by the crowd, its almost part of the decor!

For a Pointer, Tasty Corner is much more than just a sweet shop. It is pure nostalgia. Located near the South Point School junior section, it is famous for the hing kachori and radhaballavi. The kachoris or the singaras used to be our regular orders while waiting for the school bus or after the summer special classes. Items are bit overpriced, but as far as taste and quality are concerned, there's little to complain. If you are around it's a must visit.

the concoction which is added along with milk and tea leaves is the secret which adds a beautiful flavor to the tea .

Sweets available are also very good especially Amriti and Jalebi.

Lasso offered is good though less in quantity for the price charged.

They also offer tea and coffee at this shop.

It's basically a one stop shop for all things savoury and sweet at a pretty affordable price.

The dal was okish but then the singara n potol misti couldnt leave that expected grand effect.
Lastly, this place is grossly overpriced, specially if taste is all matters..!!

You must have the tea here. They serve it in cute little earthen matkas. The lassi too is great. It is thick, smooth and filling, all at the same time.

Location: The alley by ITI, towards south point school and kasturi restaurant. It falls to the right.

Review: My friend lives in swinhoe lane right beside The Tasty Corner so lazy hangover mornings are fixed just right with a plate of hot piping kachoris and chholar dal with chutney from there. The kachoris are fluffy and crunchy even if you consume them after 2 hours. I absolutely adore the lassi they make. It's creamy and chills the insides of your soul. Lovely place and good service, that would explain why it remains busy at all times of the day!

A slice from childhood, this is to me, as it is to all the other ex-Pointers. The taste of kachori-sabji from Tasty Corner is homely, familiar and comforting to all of us. The prices may seem high to some, but college life has taught me that those prices were a lot cheaper. 
Special mention- the Kheer Goja. It used to be my favourite indulgence. I miss having to frequent my school area, partly because of the sheer attraction towards the Kheer Goja alone.

The breakfast scene in Kolkata is very interesting. Never in my life i would have dreamt of having Kachoris, samosas and sweets for breakfast. Back in Chennai, we used to have it in the evening and that too occasionally. 

Tasty corner is a small outlet located in one of the by lanes of Ballygunge. The place is kept reasonably clean and there is huge crowd for breakfast waiting for their turn of kachori and subzi.

We ordered kachori (Bhatura) subzi, Dhokla, Singara (Samosa), lassi, Malai sandesh and a special tea.

Kachori is nothing but bhatura stuffed with a spice mix and it was brilliant to start off, may be the best dish over here. The green chillies served along with it makes the difference. Dhokla was soft and nice but would have preferred it to be served a little warmer. Singhara was once again great, served hot right out of the tawa. Malai sandesh was decent, not the best. I was wondering why a tea is charged 50rs per cup and then later came to know that special tea is made with saffron. Now, this is something i have never tried before. Tea in Kolkata is served in beautifully made mud pots and it adds to the flavor. The tea was one of a kind and tasted brilliant.

It is basically a self service joint and prices are bloody cheap. The entire bill came to around 200. But i still wonder how people can eat this much of fried food for breakfast. Too heavy for me.

I have been brought up around this place, mainly because of the location of my school, South Point. So, I have seen it transform 15 years down the line. Having observed the hike in price of 2 kachoris from Rs 5 to Rs 20, and the size of the sweets getting bigger with each year, this corner is a very nostalgic place for me.

I have almost tried all the sweets and the namkeens they serve, but the Kachori followed by Jalebis remains my personal favourite. It's just something you don't get elsewhere(especially the chutney)! The Dhokla isn't bad either. Also, the lassi they serve is excellent for a hot summer afternoon. Though it's a little overpriced for the quantity, it's thick and full of malai. And well, the size of their rosogollas or pantuas, I wonder if anybody can have it in one go! But do try the Kheer Goja- it's one of their best.

Cheap and best. Their curries that accompany the finger-lickung good kachoris are even tastier. The gulab jamuns were tender and hot as promised. And a lassi at the end was the icing on the cake. A person will have a very hard time spending more than 150 bucks here. The food is oily but what do you except? It's authentic Indian chaat. ;)

Location- If you come from the side of ballygunge station side you need to walk 10mins to walk to the lane next to kc das to find this place. If you come from ballygunge phari sdide need to take the next lane of cesc office. 
Land mark- South Pint High School, Fish Fish restaurant.

Ambiance- Its a clean hygienic sweet and snacks shop.

Food ordered- Hing Kochuri, Vegetable chop, Paneer cutlet, Amriti, Kheer Goja

Food quality /quantity- As I already mentioned its hygienic, this place also serves great food but cost is on the higher side. Each hing kochuri costs 10rs but the taste is really good. The aloor torkari which they serves is very good. Its even beter if you take their chatni.
Veg chop is 10rs each an excellently made. Its made up of  beet,potato,paneer,raisin.
Panner cutlet-Paneer cutlet is like a small snadwich of panner and allo. It has a thick layer of panner up and down and in the middle there is filling of potato.  
Amriti- Amriti tastes good but nothing special. Pric- 10rs
Kheer Goja-Its wonderfully made. Full of kheer and they will heat it before serving which will make it fabulous. Price -10rs.

Tea- Here normal tea costs 10rs while kesar tea costs 50rs! 

My recommendations- Hing kochuri. Veg chop .
Kheer Goja.

If you dig Kolkata street food,and reside anywhere near South Kolkata,then this is a place which you must visit at least once for fantastic snacks - either morning or afternoon through evening.

This is a shop I remember thoroughly since my school days, because it is situated at the junction of Anil Moitra Road and Mandeville Gardens and that is a stones throw from my school - South Point.

We were almost daily visitor when in senior school , at one point of time,and today I relieved that memory by visiting again after a span of many many years. 

Happy to say, it has remained the same in terms of food taste and quality, it has grown only in its modern look and cleaner way of serving food.In our childhood, food was served in 'shaalpata' and now it is served in thermocol plates ! Packing for takeaways have improved tremendously too.

But the taste - Ohh so great ! I had three samosas in a row and then moved on to katchoris with potato curry, and other stuff.Just have a bite of their awesome samosa or the big sized katchoris ( Rs 10/ each). Even the jaw-dropping array of various sweets and the finger-lickingly good 'Rabri' (Rs 500/kg) is fantastic. Or try their 'dhokla's or Laddoos. 

Both snacks and sweets are outstanding. Pocket pinch is reasonable and their service is quite prompt as well. Keep in mind, its a completely vegetarian joint.

One food tip : Ask for the typical reddish hued spicy-sweet , tamarind chutney for your samosas or dhoklas.

Cons, if any - No place to sit. You have to hold the plate in your hand and stand in front of the joint to eat. Or else get a takeaway.

Located at Mandeville garden,was introduced to this place by my husband an ex pointer who was fond of their food stuffs.Not to mention their speciality lies in the hing kachori and alu sabzi.Really crispy kachori and delicious alu curry makes it an ever popular breakfast and snack item.Accompanied by a sweet and sour tamarind chutney it is a recommended food item. Sweets are also fine accompaniments. Also tried the alu samosa,however its the hing kachori which stays with you.

It's situated near South Point School... I had there kachoris plenty of times... they are awesome... also having a jalabi or amriti after that is just a perfect ending to the treat... other preparations are also good... staffs are polite... service was quick... zero deco... pocket pinch was very very friendly...

You are hurrying down towards Swinhoe Street late for your law classes and you see suddenly see this joint called Tasty Corner at an intersection...on closer range you find people devouring hot steaming kachuris and slurping tea...your mouth sinfully begins watering and you decide to bunk the class and check out what's hot here...kachuris are served and one bite gets you hooked...yup this love affair began decades back when i was a law student...even today when in the area i still check them out and as always they sure are tasty as ever 😊

Location- If you come from the side of ballygunge station side you need to walk 10mins to walk to the lane next to kc das to find this place. If you come from ballygunge phari sdide need to take the next lane of cesc office. 
Land mark- South Pint High School, Fish Fish restaurant.

Ambiance- Its a clean hygienic sweet and snacks shop.

Food ordered- Hing Kochuri, Vegetable chop, Paneer cutlet, Amriti, Kheer Goja

Food quality /quantity- As I already mentioned its hygienic, this place also serves great food but cost is on the higher side. Each hing kochuri costs 10rs but the taste is really good. The aloor torkari which they serves is very good. Its even beter if you take their chatni.
Veg chop is 10rs each an excellently made. Its made up of  beet,potato,paneer,raisin.
Panner cutlet-Paneer cutlet is like a small snadwich of panner and allo. It has a thick layer of panner up and down and in the middle there is filling of potato.  
Amriti- Amriti tastes good but nothing special. Pric- 10rs
Kheer Goja-Its wonderfully made. Full of kheer and they will heat it before serving which will make it fabulous. Price -10rs.

Tea- Here normal tea costs 10rs while kesar tea costs 50rs! 

My recommendations- Hing kochuri. Veg chop .
Kheer Goja.

If you dig Kolkata street food,and reside anywhere near South Kolkata,then this is a place which you must visit at least once for fantastic snacks - either morning or afternoon through evening.

This is a shop I remember thoroughly since my school days, because it is situated at the junction of Anil Moitra Road and Mandeville Gardens and that is a stones throw from my school - South Point.

We were almost daily visitor when in senior school , at one point of time,and today I relieved that memory by visiting again after a span of many many years. 

Happy to say, it has remained the same in terms of food taste and quality, it has grown only in its modern look and cleaner way of serving food.In our childhood, food was served in 'shaalpata' and now it is served in thermocol plates ! Packing for takeaways have improved tremendously too.

But the taste - Ohh so great ! I had three samosas in a row and then moved on to katchoris with potato curry, and other stuff.Just have a bite of their awesome samosa or the big sized katchoris ( Rs 10/ each). Even the jaw-dropping array of various sweets and the finger-lickingly good 'Rabri' (Rs 500/kg) is fantastic. Or try their 'dhokla's or Laddoos.

Roaming around the srreets of kolkata I found this place saying their name itself as "Tasty". So I stood there for a while and checking out the menu and what other people were eating and ordering frequently. Then something got my attention saying Gobhi singara and I asked the owner that what is a singara then he told me we here in kolkata call samosa as singara. I said Ok let's try that and that was very BAD and I regret my unique choice. So I asked one of the people eating there and he suggested me Aloo poori sabji and I ordered it and it was Good , poori was crispy like some kind of slim kachori and subzi was nice. After that I ordered their misthi doi and their special sandesh and I must say that Mishti doi was superb and worth eating. So overall my experience was nice if I neglect that weird singara thing.

Every pointer (south point students) has fond memories of tasty corner and I'm no exception. Makes some of the best kachori served with alu sabzi and sweet chutney. Pure bliss. This place makes me very nostalgic and love visiting it whenever I get a chance.The samosas and sweets (personally love the amriti) are also very good. They have jacked up their prices considerably but then again quality has its price

Not being a pointer,  not being brought up at kolkata,  and hearing from my friends about this joint and the raving comments on the kachoris,  i finally got a chance to make my breakfast there with kachoris, paneer chop, rasmalai,  rabri and cup of tea.  The hing kachoris are really nice, if not THE best as claimed by most,  the rest were good too.  The prices of the sweet section seemed on the higher side compared to other famed mithai shops of the area.

I have been having their kochuris since my toddler days and decades later, they still taste the same. All Pointers (students of South Point) have a nostalgic relationship with this place and it's fluffy and flavourful kochuris. Being served with the perfect aloo and chutney, it is a taste which spells comfort and remembrance for me. Also, they make wonderful lassi and hajar ka halwa.

Probably a grade lower than Maharani in terms of 'kochuris' but still quite a treat to the palate. Used to be a frequent haunt after school where I used to have these cheat meals and pretend not to be hungry till dinner. Till date the place is very reasonable and hasn't dropped much in terms of quality.

This place has been my favourite since I was a toddler. Their kochuris and the aloo sabzi with the chutney are droolworthy *-* I absolutely love them. Their dhoklas are fluffy and soft and perfectly made. I run out of words for the jalebis and radhaballabis here. The gulabjamuns are great too! At last but never the least the lassi in those super cute bhaars  are a must try. Pocket pinch is low. Highly recommended place :D

One thing I can guarantee is that this place sells the best Radhaballavis in town. The shop being just next to my school has always been very special to me and believe me the quality of the snacks here has kept growing year after year. The Laddoos and Jalebis there are pretty famous but I have always loved the Malai chamcham they sell. Maybe some people may think of this place to be a tad bit more costly than other sweet shops in the area but it's definitely money's worth. Again finally capping it off by saying if one hasn't had the kachoris & radhaballavis then they should go there as soon as possible and start munching away.

tasty corner. situated near south point school, this small snack joint is the highly preferred snack destination for every student. being an ex South Pointer myself, i have been visiting this place for the last 17-18 years. the only thing i remember from then is my dad buying hing kachoris and alu dum, early in the morning everyday and packing it in a small tiffin box and keeping it safely in my tiny school bag, so that i could gorge on that delicious food later on in school. ^_^ well, by now this snack joint has changed a lot and has become even more popular now. prices have obviously increased since then, but the taste is still definitely amazing. it's usually crowded the entire day, being a regular stop for almost every school student and guardians and localites..so,if you are near ballygunge and you need a great place for a quick bite, please do drop by and try their kachoris and the mouth-watering jalebis. :)

When you go and stand there, deciding what to order, your mouth will start watering at the exhibition of delicious sweets and you end up trying multiple ones because each one is worth a try. The mishti doi is fabulous! The creamy piquant Lassi leaves your taste buds craving for more. The kachori sabzi and the sandesh are also toothsome! Do give this place a visit! 😊

Everytime my school bus passed through Madevilla Gardens, a smell would overpower me and make me salivate. As years passed by, the longing for the kachoris at this place only intensified, never getting a chance to satiate. Finally at around class 7, I had the chance to gorge upon these delicious "what to call it"? At that time it was two for 5 bucks. And it was heaven. Eating a kachori is not just breaking the fried bread with your fingers, dipping it onto the kasuri methi infused aloo sabzi (with occasional traces of matar) and gently brushing the sides with the imli chutney and then putting it into your mouth. It's much more than that. The time between placing the order and receiving it is crucial. After you have placed the order, you need to take a deep breath and with it the saliva-inducing smell of fried kachoris inside your body. It's not just your body but rather your soul that accumulates the experience. I have had kachoris all over Kolkata but what tasty corner offers is something unique. I do not know if it is me or my sensory organs, but nowadays, these kachoris do not taste as good as they used to in the nineties. Maybe that's because the longing isn't that strong as my mind knows I can have them anytime I want. But I am sure, for a nouvelle experience, one must visit this place.

For us Bengali's, kochuri is all time favorite snack. Tasty corner is located near south point school. You will find this place always full with all the kochuri lovers. The kochuri tastes really good and is quite big in size compared to other places. The subji is also very tasty and they give a chutney which is a chatpata one. Its my fav place to have kochuris since my childhood. The sweets are also very fresh and yummy, specially the jalebi and gajar ka halwa. Basically, all the famous kochuri centres are in north, but this place in the south, is worth your taste and money.. So, its a must try for everyone...

We friends & foodies of Patha Bhavan High School used to drop in there to have the kochuri and specially I loved the red chatney with it. Even now after years with my friends I use to go there to relish the red chatney then chat and a must the tea 🍵 /coffee. When no friend is free I go there in evening to refresh my mood with their chatney & food.
Time has changed so the getup of tasty corner also. But time failed to change their great taste & smell. It's such a small place with so much varieties. One funny 😁 problem occurs when someone pays the bill & at the same time someone goes to the basin to wash hands.they get collide. But nobody gets angry as the taste cools the situation. Foodies don't get afraid with the Kochuri's price per plate. Have it with the Red Chatney I am sure you will thank me later. Don't forget to. Have chat/ dahi bara too. Jug jug jiyo Tasty 😋 Corner. Foodies they are always better than Maharani at Desopriyo Park.

Tasty Corner will be a place really special in the heart for everyone who grew up as a student of South Point School. I remember this place as a daily snack joint after I finished school and on my way to tutions. Still now the Kochuri and alur dum there is magnificent and top it off with a amriti. The prices have gone up from the time I was in school but its not that high and the above combination is available for 30 bucks; but the quality and the taste for this still remains the same and reminds me of the good old days. There are other options available as well like samosa khasta kachori etc and also the laddoo and raajbhog are good things to try here. Overall a trip down memory lane for me and a great place to snack during the evening. I will give it 4/5.

This joint is an essential part of my memory lane, where I frequented almost everyday after school.

Its practically crowded at all times of the day. Situated at the corner of the road near the junior school of South Point- it serves lip smacking radha ballavi and alur dum. I usually had their dhokla which are a all time favourite of mine!

Even though I have passed school years back, I still don't miss a chance to drop by at this place whenever I get a chance.

My suggestion to all you guys- if you are nearby this place & hungry for snacks please do visit this place!

Located beside South Point Jr. School, Tasty Corner is a bliss for localites like me. Lip smacking Kachoris with aloo dum and Radhaballavis to die for. Very popular stop for a varied clientele from school students, guardians, localites to taxi drivers and passers-by. Tad little expensive compared to other shops selling the Kachori Radhaballavi  fare, but worth every penny. Sweets are good too. I just dont like their lassis. Also, the tea they make is great. Must try if in this area.

Visited the place many times while returning from university. Kachori and dhokla is very tasty there. It is a verty pocket friendly shop and appropriate for 'choti choti bhuk'.

I have been a student of Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan and used to come to and go back from school by a pool car. While returning, me and my friends would always request our 'driver kaku ' to stop by this shop so that we can fetch some kochuri-alu torkari or dhokla or may be sometimes a glass full of lassi for ourselves and enjoy it throughout the car ride to home! :)

I have always loved the sweets of this place...especially rasgullas...heard a lot about it from my father whose school was nearby..

Their kachoris should not be missed...Though I'm not a fan of sandesh.   but I love their "rosher mishti"..especially malai chumchum

My school till class V was on this road.Alas there was no tasty corner then.What can you write about a shop which serves killer kachoris,with one of the best bhajis in town,having uniformly good sweets the speciality being the jalebis and kheerkadams.One word of advice.......never for your life miss the lassi.Its the best there is.....

when you are in this popular street side tea stall cum sweet shop i.e Tasty Corner, the food snacks will certainly be tasty, some refreshing authentic (Marwari) snacks-bhujia, some good quality sweets (of every kind) and other items would definitely win over any evening adda sessions or for breakfast appetite. 
apart from my all time favorite hing-kachori, the thing at which i marvel & gape every time i am here is their one mammoth size rasogulla, kamavog or laddu. & each of these oversize bombs come at 50rs. but recently i found this price has soar up to rs100 and yes their size too has gone 2 times larger. i wonder what these are made for!    
the price here is quite reasonable but some items are overpriced, but given the quality & demand they are worth it. here it's always crowded but the staffs need to be more genial.

Tasty Corner.. For 12 long years I have been a regular customer at this place, just like any other fellow Pointer.. 
Open almost all day, this place provides some of the best evening snacks you can find in the area.. 
Kachuris, dalpuris, singaras, dhoklas, serve it all- for the hungry students who have less than half an hour between school break and tuitions.. The quality has not dropped one bit over these long years and at the same time, its healthy(not once in all these years have I fallen sick from their food) and damn cheap.. 
Tasty corner will always have a special place in the corner of my heart, wherever I go..

A very crowded place if you visit during the school hours. But this place is a heaven for kachori lovers. Yummy food at a worthy price. Dont complain abt the price as the food more than compensates for it. Lassi n dhoklas are also good.
A huge thumbs up if u r willing to wait for your bite.

This place is heaven for a person like me who just loves his flour fried and desserts sweet. I started with tea and gradually moved on to their famous khachori sabji. I liked the cholar dal more than their alur dom may be because of my sweet tooth. That's why their  sweets did not dissapoint me.  I had gaja and pantua. Lovely. No sitting arrangement but get ready to find the place real crowded during peak hours. Located at a corner (how obvious) near south point,  the location of the place is superb. I found the prices on a little bit higher side but based on the location and reputation, no one will complain ?

Tasty corner has been around the corner for sometime  now. Just located besides south point school this place has remained packed and overcrowded as long as I can remember. I am heavily into deep fried food and my love for that has led me here lots of times. 
Their amriti & jalebi used to be amazing but over the years I personally feel their quality and taste has deteriorated. 

But what remains the same is their hot hing kachori, khasta kachori and the very much talked about phoolkofir samosa and radhaballavi. The potato gravy served along with these is indeed lip smacking and along with their tea they make a filling snack be it an early morning breakfast or something to munch on in the evening. 
Also with their hing Kachori comes various options to choose from cholar Dal or aloo r torkari. 
Their luchi is also quite nice and when served hot makes quite a delicious snack! Their food is reasonably priced and within 100 bucks you can actually have a good meal. 
The final verdict : if you love deep fried food traditional Bengali snacks don't look anywhere else!

The place is overhyped. Probably since it is in a good location, near south point school. The kochuri are good indeed, especially with heeng flavour, the aroma and taste is really inviting. They also offer you 3 options to savour the fluffy kochuri - chana dal, alu dam and matar alu sabzi. This benefit sets this place apart from rest, or else you get similar kochuri in many places. Gur rosogolla is also decent here. Ask them to heat it in microwave for 15-20 seconds. Yummm....

Visited this place after 10 years. They used to serve great Radha Ballavis and aloor dum. Although the quality has deteriorated and the price has stotup immensely, still you can enjoy their Hing Kachoris and Radha Ballavis. Sweet varieties has also increased than the past.

This place is nostalgia objectified for Pointers.
It was our go-to-place for a party during school when Rs.50 was a big deal.Their kachoris and coke are famous among both students and general folk.The jolbhora talshash of my childhood used to have jaggery in the middle and is a stuff from heaven.Same goes for the other kora pak sandesh available.
Kachoris to take you to heaven?This is the place to be.

Being a student of South Point and spending my entire childhood around this location I can proudly say Tasty Corner has been a part of my life quiet long. As a matter of fact this store is also famous among Patha Bhavan students.
Every afternoon while returning from school the smell of Khasta Kachori and Samosa use to drag me at their doorsteps. Taste and freshness never ever disappointed me.
I have seen the shop attendants use to know students by their names and this proves the patronage of Tasty Corner. 
During morning all walkers gather here for their famous Radhaballabis. Have so many fond memories here thinking of which gives me goose bumps still.

Just happened to be in Gariahat for 3 days for some work with my husband. While hunting for a vegetarian hangout we found this shop and were amazed with the hing and daal kachauris and parathas they offer. They are too tasty and have a great quality. Easily affordable. Loved each and every item we ate there. Awesome variety of sweets, snacks n chutnies too. Also try their tea.

This place doesn't really need to be on zomato for it to be popular. It is arguably the most famous aloo kachuri breakfast place in South Kolkata.
If you reside near Gariahat or Mandeville or if you happen to have been a student of South Point High School, you must have had the kachuri aloo like a zillion times.
The speciality with their kachuri aloo is the red sweet sauce. The sweetness of the sauce blends perfectly with the spice of the aloo to produce a delicious meal.
Their sweets are also really great. Actually most of their items are good.
I know its just a kachori place but it is as good as kachuri places get.
After all it has kept hundreds of Pointers happy for so many years and continues to do so..

If you are looking for a place to have good breakfast near Ballygunge/Gariahat,  this is an excellent option. Garam Garam Kachori, aalu sabji, chatni ke saath Kesari Jalebi.. AHA!! this is one of the most awesome bengali breakfast option. Yes it might not very healthy, but hey.. sometimes u shud have chit days u know...
There are other sweet options also, but their Jalebi is really nice.

Simple love this place. Its very close to my heart, well for several reasons. This is my favorite place for having kochuri with aloo gravy. The chatni they give with it, makes it all the more tasty. I love almost all the sweets they have here. rosho malai and khirer sandesh being my favorite. Used to come here with dad straight from Anderson club for breakfast during school days.Even today, I often stop by and have my favorite coffee on chilly evenings.

If you are a Kachori lover like me, this place is just made for you. The place is located very close to South Point and mostly crowded during peak hours. Tasty Corner is very well known by the students of South Point and also by the nearby residents.

Their Kachori with Dal or Sabji is like match made in heaven, and not to forget their sweets and other mouthwatering snacks. They prepare their kachoris and radhaballavis early in the morning, as early as 6:00AM. They also give you three options for kachoris with Dal, Aloo Dum and Sabji. I like Dal the most but the other two options are also good.

Next thing you would definitely want to try is their mouthwatering Jalebi. One of the best jalebis you will find in South Kolkata. They are quite big in size than usual size.

The sweet collection is descent, there is a good collection of both Bengali and Non-Bengali sweets. The 'Shank Sandesh' is really good and innovative. They are quite big and perfect for gifting someone.

Snacks include another quite unique item i.e.- Phoolgobhi Samosa which will definitely be my next try.

Beverages include soft drinks like Pepsi, Sprite even Red Bull (all available in Cans). Tea is also available throughout the day.

Service is quite good, they are quite swift in their job. Crowd is however too much during 7-8AM as it is the breakfast time. During this time, there is barely any standing space outside the store. Good thing is that they have change early in the morning.

This one's a place which grew and thrived due to South Point. As a Pointer I remember Parents foregoing breakfasts for their children and giving money to buy tiffin from the same place. The Hot Hing Kachoris and Aloo Subzi, Jalebis , Lassi, Dahi Vada , Radhaballabhi with Aloor dum has never given us any reason to complain. Their quality is consistent and the ambience is pretty clean. The crowds of Pointers vouching on behalf of their Hing Kschori bears testimony to their reputation.

One just cannot take Tasty Corner out from a Pointer's life.
Similarly,1993-2008,as a Pointer, this shop has fed me with some sumptuous Radha-ballavi, Dahi-vada, Rabri, Lassi and innumerable sweets. One can always find Pointers and their parents crowding this place post school.
Going in groups, post school to feed on hot Radha-ballavis,hastily finishing them off and asking for that jug of water still makes me nostalgic.
Prices have always been on the steeper side and lately having climbed a few nothces more, is the sole con of this shop, but again filling that hungry,empty stomach with those tasty dishes,can be adjusted.

If you are a Pointer, this place would definitely be familiar to you. Back in my school days the footpath along Tasty corner was full of students and their parents after or before school timings. Though this place is famous for its radhaballabi and kalakands, I personality feel its a bit over rated. The prices are bit high also. Though during my school days I was soo hungry that neither the price nor rating it came to my mind..

Alu dumm or dal or alu mutter sabzi . If that wssnt enough ,.. They spoil u more by letting u chose between two types of samosa . 

The sweets looked really inviting and we tried the jalebis and sandesh . Both were brilluant . 

The gentleman on the counter is very friendly .

I've been to this place so many times that I can't even remember. Used to be good for Radhabalavi and Kachori. Now a days they don't put much daal in the Radhabalavi, but Kachori is still good. They provide bengali sweets which taste good. Tea is good, but sometimes it is just not up to the mark since it is not their forté. Good for fast food and the quality of oil they use is appropriate. Not enough parking space is a problem here.

Location: Near South Point School, Mandeville Gardens.

This place is located at the dogleg of Mandeville Gardens and one can locate it while travelling from ITI College, Ballygunge towards Kolkata Kathi Rolls.

This place is a sweet-snack shop which manages to dish decent savouries as well as sweets.
Happened to drop by this place for a snack while was around Ballygunge. Located it with the help of the directions given in Zomato. This might look like a big shop but, it does face a space crunch once the crowd levels rise.
No such ambiance to be expected out here, just a 'stand-n-eat' by the pavement style or a takeaway facility to be expected.

About the food, it's a pure vegetarian outlet and has a widespread menu on offer. I ordered for the following:

- Paneer Cutlet
Okay, it wasn't as tasty as it looked like. Was a tad too oily for my palate.

- Samosa (Potato filling)
The only reason to mention the filling is the availability of a variant (cauliflower filling).
The samosa was decent and the filling was just near satisfaction in taste.

- Dhokla
Was soft and spongy. Tasted good.

- Luchi & Chana Dal
Two fried-on-order fluffy luchis served with sweet delicious chana Dal!
Recommended.

-  Kachori Sabji
Same as Luchis, fried on order kachoris which were fluffy and non-greasy. The sabji was flavorful too. The tempered chillies on the side was good too.

- Gulab Jamun
Hot and decently-sized gulab jamun to finish off the little snack I was enjoying. Delicious.
Recommended.

- Lassi
Chilled Lassi served in earthen glasses. Tasted good. Helped me flush down the tasty snack.

The service was quick and the staff were happy to help.
Hygiene levels were well-maintained.
Prices are super pocket-friendly!

Overall was a good experience.
- A happy tummy left with smiling face.
- Coming back for more.
- Yet to try the remaining fare.

Those who are Pointers would vouch for this legendary confectionary joint just near to South Point Junior school. My Relationship with Tasty Corner started in my school days when my Mum used to buy Kalakand for my Tiffin from there. They are till date the best kalkand I had. I remember my Ncc days when after any function we used to go to tasty corner..those adreline rushes encountered for then we for the first time started commuting on our own. The Dahi Vadas and Cold drink was my staple there. But what makes it legendary is the Kachori Sabji. Perfectly doughed Kachoris crispy from the outside and explosion of hing and dal in the inside and the aloo ssabji adourned with the chutney is too delightful to ever leave. Potol mishti is another favourite of mine of this joint.

**Brief = I have been there many a times and it has been my saviour during my exams, as I have to go to South Calcutta Law College. While returning most of the days I am bound to have Radhaballabis and alu matar sabji,samosas,amriti. :)

**Ambiance = Pretty neat and clean shop, with attentive servers. But during crowd times, its bit difficult to adjust as the space is not much.

**Recommended = Amritis and jilipis(must try).Radhaballabi or other kachuris(must try),Gulab Jamuns(wow),Potol Dorma mishti(a superb sweet and must must try).

** Purse Check = Rs.200 for 2 perspn is enough for some heavy snacks :P

**Overall = A place close to my heart and always will be :) Keep rocking

The food is awesome but once you are ready to pay, then all the nice feelings fade away fast. It's too pricey. They cannot just price the food high being located in a good locality, rather should invest in the ambience too like the haldirams do. 

They can easily afford to either increase the quantity or lower the price

Tasty Corner, one name which associates with great kachoris and lots of nostalgia for me.

Located at the intersection of Ballygunge ITI and the extended end of Mandeville Gardens, this place serves probably hottest hing kachoris available around.

An instant hit,particularly among the students of South Point and the local residents, do try out their Hing Kachoris, and Gulab Jamuns . Tea is served hot and nice . They have all those varieties of a normal sweet shop(Samosa,Dahivada,Sonpapri,Chamcham) but i believe the legacy of Tasty Corner lies with their Hing Kachoris.

The price is a bit much (Hing Kachori @ Rs.10/piece) ,but who cares as the shop seems to ride high with the love of its customers and the location in the ever posh Mandeville Gardens too somewhat explains it.

I still keep repeating back right from my schooldays for the last 15 years..

Tasty Corner, located near the south point school,is a popular snacks joint in South Kolkata. Food is good here, specially their Hing Kachuri (puri) with sabji and Gulabjamun that they are serving for more than 20 years. You'll always get it hot and quick. Apart form Kachuri and Gulabjamuns, do try their samosas (singara) with chutney and jilipi (jalebi).


They also serve, masala hot tea, Dhokla, Dahi Vada, and some sweets.


I had Kachuri from them after 4 long years few days back, but surprisingly, they maintained their quality and taste that I experienced before.


Please note that, they don’t have sitting arrangements, but they serve some quality finger licking food. I found price is bit higher than other regular shops.


Do visit Tasty Corner, (near South Point School and not far from Gariahat Crossing and Ballygunge Station) to experience their Kachuri and Gulabjamum if you ever visit South Kolkata.

A few paces from the South Point School (Mandeville Gardens), this place is favorite among a majority of Pointers. Taking a bite of the kachori/radhaballavi wrapped in a preparation of steamed potatoes is never so delicious anywhere. Among the sweet-meats sold here, the laddoos and all forms of rasgullas are a must try. Apart from selling kachuris, jibeygajas, rasgullas, they also sell canned rasgullas (so if you are travelling outside and wish to take a souvenir, here you have the chance), cold beverages, milk (in earthenware glasses), coffee, tea and mineral water too.!! In my school-days, a number of Pointers (those who were in the Afternoon section) used to fill their tiffin boxes with delicacies from this joint.

Tasty Corner is located near south point junior school. One of my favorite place to have snacks. Their kachoris are awesome and probably the best in town. Apart from that the masala chai and dhokla are also mouth watering. Service is very good. They waiters do not keep you waiting for some. Most of the times you get what you want instantly!!

Tasty Corner, located near the south point school,is a popular snacks joint in South Kolkata. Food is good here, specially their Hing Kachuri (puri) with sabji and Gulabjamun that they are serving for more than 20 years. You'll always get it hot and quick. Apart form Kachuri and Gulabjamuns, do try their samosas (singara) with chutney and jilipi (jalebi).


They also serve, masala hot tea, Dhokla, Dahi Vada, and some sweets.


I had Kachuri from them after 4 long years few days back, but surprisingly, they maintained their quality and taste that I experienced before.


Please note that, they don’t have sitting arrangements, but they serve some quality finger licking food. I found price is bit higher than other regular shops.


Do visit Tasty Corner, (near South Point School and not far from Gariahat Crossing and Ballygunge Station) to experience their Kachuri and Gulabjamum if you ever visit South Kolkata.

Everyone who is a student of SPHS has at least once have indulged to Tasty Corner's Radhavallabi n allurdam or Kachori Sabji,Kalakands,Potolmishti n so on. And i am one of those lucky ones. I hate having kachoris...but then the Kachoris in this place just makes me order for more and more. Perfectly round kachoris stuffed with dal is just a treat worth million bucks. The stuffing gives out the distinct taste of hing but its not overpowering. What i love is the chutney, a thick sweet sauce made to perfection gives the needful acidification complementing the sabji. Apart from that i am a big fan of their Potol mishri,kalakand and dahi valle. The price compared to other kachori shops is lil higher but then...what you cannot pay to satisfy your tongue isn't it.

Tasty Corner, a place that every student of South Point School has frequented multiple number of times during their school life, is a famous food joint in Calcutta known for its Hing Kachoris, Gulab Jamums, Masala Chai and the never ending list of sweets they sell. The positive point for which you should visit the place is that it has been known for maintaining and never compromising with the quality and the taste of items they serve over the last 25+ years.

This outlet practically symbolises South Point School. Very cheap, quick service and the staff are good too. Food is good, especially the kachuri. The ideal outlet if you are in a hurry and want to grab a quick bite. The sweets could be a tad better, given that so many people eat every day.

Not very far from my house this place has been a rage for many people and they keep telling me to eat here every now and then... i will keep this review very simple and short as there is nothing much to talk about this place... the radha ballavi is amazing to have... the taste is spot on and i dont think you can find a better place than this to eat it... the samosas are a sure shot avoid... cause they are made is such a way that the oil will react and the taste comes in your mouth... more so they have this new concept of fusions samosas and other items which are a sure shot Miss!!! cause it tastes just not good...

if you look in the terms of hygiene this place is definitely not for you as they have dirt all over place... the lassi (normal) one is a little liquidy but really good to taste...

all in all if you just passing by and need a super fast bite then stop over and enjoy... but be warned.. if something is great to taste that does not mean that everything will be great as well...

Few places are close to your heart for quick snacks, and tasty Corner is one of them. Located near the south point school, this was my fav place to eat kachuri + jilipi in between school end and coaching class. 

Throughout the day, the kachori (puri) and sabji gets prepared there, and its awesome. They always serve it hot and tasty. 
Finish your quick snacks with a cup of coffee/ Lassi , or at least some jelabi.

Totally, they serve the best Kachuri around that area. No Question about it.

Visited this joint on a sunday morning .. the place was obviously crowded. Ordered a place of kachori subzi along with normal singhara. The kachori subzi was good and so was the singhara which was pretty large in size.Also I parcelled 10 pieces of kachori subzi with 5 phul gopi singhara(winter special) . I reached home in about say 15 mins and started to eat the hot kachoris and singhara. To my surprise the kachoris had become hard and was not as good as they tasted freshly out of the frying pan. Even the singhara had too much of garam masala in it. I found the normal singhara much better. Indeed its a great joint but the kachori did not quite come out as expected in the parcel. .

kachuris and dalpuri s are bit overpriced.
no complain about food --sweets are just awesome and snacks they will always provide you hot and fresh.
Had been a customer there since a student of class 6.
The rabree and Capsicum chop are the two more items I would suggest people to try out.
Price is more definitely but a feeling of nostalgia and there maintenance of quality bounds me to give a 4.0

The final bell of South Point High School rings and I pack my bags and rush down the stairs to meet my mother who brings Tasty Corner's delicious kachoris and alu matar sabji for me.I gobble up the food in the front seat of our car (as I am running late for my English tuitions). 10 years later when I take a stroll down Dover Lane the familiar smell of the delicious kachoris and radha ballavis makes me forget that I am on a diet! I do not listen to my brain and march up to the shop and demand not only their delicious snacks but also their mouth watering gajar ka halwa(only in winters) and rabri!Every single item in this shop is worth eating from the giant sized laddus to the amazing chai!This underrated shop tucked away in a corner of Mandeville Gardens makes me nostalgic about my school days and I can't help but keep coming back for more!

The other    attraction  to   the   delicious   food  provided   by  this   place   is   the  nostalgia related  to  this   eatery! Tasty   Corner   was   the   favourite eatery   during  our   school  days !  The  delicious   samosa   and     kachori  accompanied  by    the  aloo  sabzi  and  the   aam   ada   chutney  would  instantly    light   up  a  smile   after   an   extremely   tough   exam  paper!   The   sweets  are  various  too ,  and   each  one proudly holding   true   their  reputation for  decades! The   samosa     which   was  bigger   than  the  average  sizes   offered  in  most     shops used  to  have   this  delicious  palak  and  aloo   filling  ,  something  which   am   craving  for   even  as  I   writing  this  review!! That   along  with   the   radhaballavi  and   kachori   are   on  my  must  have   list   the   next  time   am  in   the  neighbourhood!

I have been a loyal customer of this shop since the last 20 years. Even before the CCDs and the Baristas opened shop in Kolkata, this used to be the default hangout place for me and my friends during our school-days. The piping hot Hing Kachoris and the Radha Ballavi taste the same even today. Governments have come and gone, inflation has hit us, and life in Kolkata has changed so much. But thankfully, this place’s food still tastes awesome. Even the elders at my home swear by the taste of the Dhokla and the Dahi Vada. My personal favourites include the Hing Kachori, Sweet Potol (Parval), Jilipi (Jalebi) and the Kheer er Goja

The food junction serves for a really good spot for college n school goers...but one thing that goes without saying is that the food is fresh...the employees have a spirit and are ready to serve but what the con for this joint is that certain items are not up to the mark and that includes the simplest 'alur dum' or even the humble 'cholar daal' tastes imperfect.
But for the quality of the sweets and the freshness of the food it serves this place is definitely worth a try.

Whenever I think of Tasty Corner, the image that conjures up is that of piping hot, cripsy hing kachoris served with spicy subzee and sweet chutney. Crunchy, hot samosa served with sweet chutney is another delicacy with which I used to treat myself whenever I dropped in at Tasty Corner.  Situated at 18, Anil Moitra Road, Mandeville Gardens, Gariahat, Kolkata, Tasty Corner enjoys a whole crowd of school students who throng in there, especially in the afternoons and evenings, to enjoy spicy kachoris, mouthwatering samosas, cutlets, dhokla, sugary sweets, sweetened lassi or steaming hot tea. 

I was fortunate enough to study in a school nearby and thus, could eat a variety of snacks and savouries from Tasty Corner. The USP of Tasty Corner is you’ll never find stale or cold food here. Everything is served fresh and the snacks are always piping hot. Also, there is no question of their serving stale food to customers because by the time it is evening, the heap of snacks and sweets get sold i.e. devoured by ravenously hungry customers. The place is clean as compared to other sweet shops or roadside eateries.  It’s true, there is no seating arrangement, but you can comfortably stand and enjoy your plate of snacks and sweets. Although, there is a whole crowd there in the afternoons and evenings, you never get shoved by an angry customer or pushed by a school boy. There is enough space to stand comfortably. 

If you drop in at Tasty Corner do not forget to try their lipsmacking hing kachoris and mouthwatering samosas. If you have a sweet tooth, then heaps of sweets displayed on trays will attract your attention first. You would love to eat a hot Amriti or Jalebi, soaked in sweetened syrup. How you will enjoy when with every bite sweetened syrup will trickle down your mouth! Spongy gulab jamouns or milky malai chamcham can simply make your day. Those who prefer dry sweets can try some laddo, chena toast or milk cake. Tasty Corner offers a variety of sweets and snacks. But to tatse these varieties, you must drop in here in next to no time.

Being very close to my school itself I have enjoyed the hot piping kachoris and alur dam.The samosas are really good but the paneer chop is not as delicious as the others are . The rates maybe pricey but the taste really makes it value for money.The rabri is awesome and gulab jamun is just pure bliss.The gajar ka halwa however is not upto my likeness. It is a sweet shop so don't expect a clean environment but it is worth dropping in there for a quick round of snacks.

Tasty Corner! This name was something I grew up with. As a child and as a food lover the only times I visited this place was every day 5 days a week after school to have Kochuri. Tea, snacks, sweets, these are also available here but seriously never thought of having anything but Kochuri. It tasted heaven. And it still tastes heaven. Kochuri from Tasty Corner. The best place to have in south Kolkata. PERIOD.

'Kaku duto kachuri dao.. Ektu besi kore chutney dio na...' A common dialogue by pointers after 5pm every weekdays only at Tasty corner..

Tasty corner! I still remember the aroma of hot and fresh hing er kachuri being fried from a long distance.. That is honestly the smell that makes me remember the memories of pointers gathering like flock of birds infront of Tasty corner.. Nostalgia! Pure nostalgia.. Situated near ITI and very near the South Point junior and High school Tasty corner is a tasty treat for many people.. No you can't dine-in.. you can't even sit.. It is just a snack shop where they serve you like a sweet shop.. But the food is extra ordinary.. Hot hing er kachuri.. with vegetables and chutney. Radhaballavi. The hot samosas with fresh potatos inside.. Aaah heaven.. I can imagine the smell and taste as I am writing this.. A hot favourite for pointers.. A place to hang out after school is over.. Students from South Point, Patha Bhavan and the locals loves tasty corner.. The sweets are really special too.. The goja, small laddoo(even the small one is big), the gajar ka halwa, the various types of sweets still remains in our taste buds.. I can feel my saliva coming out.. Ohh!

The only thing they should do now is arrange some seats which I know is impossible as the shop is really small but still it will put the shop at a much higher place.. But all people should try tasty corner once.. Not saying because I am a pointer but I can assure you tasty corner won't be a nasty experience.. You will return for some more. Its finger licking good..

Pure, unadulterated nostalgia ! That's how I will start writing about the place where we spent countless days gorging on the super awesome radhaballobi, alur dom/chholar dal and the various assortments of sweets. A hot favorite with us, South Pointers, this shop is located right on the first junction after you take the road running beside ITI near Ballygunge Phanri. I still recollect going there from Jadavpur quite a few times (it's a 15-20 minutes drive depending on traffic.) in the morning with friends for our breakfast and it was rewarding each time. Yummy !! The pipping hot and delicious radhabollobi with alur dom followed by a variety of sweets like Kalakand, Moti Pak, Gajar ka Halwa, Rosogolla and assortment of various sondesh just makes me salivate at the mere though of it. Just be aware that this is just a simple sweet shop with exemplary food quality. Be sure to visit this place if you happen to visit Ballygunge area.

If you are a Pointer (in case you don't know who or what is a Pointer, you don't deserve to know!!!), then you swear by this place. The best Radhaballabhi and Kachuri in the  area. The sweets are all too good.

Only cons (which I, like all Pointers, don't recognize) are:
1. There is no dine-in facility. You most often find yourself standing on the footpath outside the shop while you eat like a glutton.

2. In today's age and time, they might start to consider about accepting cards. If Monginis can, Campari can (you don't know Campari??!!! You not a Pointer or what???!!!), why can't these guys??!!!

For non-Pointers: Forget the Ponter pinch. Go grab the food.

This small food joint reminds me of my school days.In the evening while going for tuition after school it was such a pleasure to have Radhabhallavi or Kachuri in Tasty Corner.The taste was enhanced by the sweet chutni which always accompanied both Radhabhallavi and Kachuri without fail.Though I always preferred Radhabhallavi over Kachuri because the Alur dam served with Radhabhallavi  tasted better than the Alur tarkari served with Kachuri.
After I completed my schooling I relocated to Bangalore.There I used to crave for the Radhabhallavis of Tasty Corner.
When I returned back  to Kolkata after 5 years, it was such a delight to discover that this small simple sweet shop is still serving  very high quality and offcourse TASTY sweets and snacks.The price has increased a lot over the years.But it is worth it.

The very name "Tasty Corner" incites nostalgia in the hearts of Pointers-  some lip-smacking kachuri after school, before going to tution.. Basically a sweet shop- better remembered for its tasty kachuris and hence the name perhaps.. Whenever you are in Kolkata 19 area, just drop by Tasty Corner (between ITI and South Point School) and have a feel of the nostalgia and the taste of hot kachuri- u may top up with a jalebi as well..

From my school days at South Point, I frequent this place, with friends, and family. Their kachuris are mind blowing, at least that's how I described them a few years back.

Now though, after eating at various kachuri eateries, I reckon they should really do something special to bring back the magic.

Pure, unadulterated nostalgia ! That's how I will start writing about the place where we spent countless days gorging on the super awesome radhaballobi, alur dom/chholar dal and the various assortments of sweets. A hot favorite with us, South Pointers, this shop is located right on the first junction after you take the road running beside ITI near Ballygunge Phanri. I still recollect going there from Jadavpur quite a few times (it's a 15-20 minutes drive depending on traffic.) in the morning with friends for our breakfast and it was rewarding each time. Yummy !!

This shop, located just behind ITI, certainly serves some really tasty snacks and desserts. The radhaballavi and hing kachori are a must try. We tried the huge, piping hot radhaballavi and the flavoursome hing kachori that comes with a fair amount or alur dum and some tangy, sweet chutney. This combo will just leave you wanting for more even if your tummy is full. 
Now on to the desserts. Almost all the sweets are  priced at Rs.10 each and they are all amazingly BIG in size and delightful as well! Even the small laddu is double the normal size of that of any other good shop. A roll of cottage cheese exquisitely wrapped in a thick layer of aamshotto (an evergreen Bengali household savory item which are sheets of dried and candied mango), was one of the best mango sweets I ever had. The kheer goja is also quite good, if you're fond of the fried delicacies. 
The only drawback according to my view was the lack of a few seats, as a lot of elderly people come here and they have no option but to stand and eat. Just a small wooden bench would make this place perfect!
Overall, Tasty Corner is a must visit for any foodie and is worth dropping in every time you're there!

Located at one corner of mandeville gardens,this corner is really tasty. There was a time when every morning i would go to this place for having breakfast which would obviously be hing kochuri or radha ballavi with alur dom. And that small kid in me would always ask for more of that mishti chatni which goes very well with it! I used to end it with a gulab jamun. This is primarily a sweet shop,quite hygienic and worth mention is their gajar ka halwa. Yum! I guess whoever crosses this place would be tempted to have something from here!

Tasty Corner lives up to its name completely and serves delicious and tasty snacks !!! I have been visiting this place since my school days as a friend lived in Mandeville Gardens and continue to do so. What attracts me is that the taste and quality of the food have remained the same as ever. Hing Kachori , Luchi or Radha Ballabi served with the Aludam or Cholar Dal is super as is the Samosa. Finish off with the excellent Gulab Jamuns or the Sonpapri. And if your family likes food as much as you do would recommend that you pack a few gulab jamuns for them as well.

Tasty Corner used to be a regular haunt of ours. Right after school and just before going for tuition this was our favourite snack place. Then again after I left school and my mom got transferred to her Ballygaunge branch we would often have breakfast here on Saturday mornings. Somedays she would carry back snacks home in the evening. 

My favourite here is ofcourse the Radhaballavi with Alur Dom.  They serve it with Cholar Dal or Alur Torkari as well. The Radhaballavi is always served piping hot. The spicy Alur Dom and the Misti Chatni goes perfectly with it The Radhaballavi might seem a little pricey, but then two is more than enough for one person. Infact, I myself struggle to finish two at a time.. I also absolutely adore their Samosa, Vegetable Chop and Paneer Chop.
 
I do not have much of a sweet tooth but I love the desserts from this place. They make this green colored oblong sweet which just melts in your mouth and is a must try.I love the Kalakand from this place as well. And I have to mention the Gajar Ka Halwa. It is just the right amount of sweet and it smells divine and you can actually taste all the different spices, the elaichi,the cardamom. It is the definition of what a mouth watering dessert should be like.Too bad you only get it during winter.

This place is just a sweetmeat shop really. So expecting a high end restaurant like ambiance here is unfair. But it is clean and hygienic. You would even get filtered water. The food served is always fresh. Also I have always found this place to be crowded for the last 13 years. A testament of the good standard that they have been maintaining for all these years.

This place was very close to my school and consequently I have gone here a thousand times over many years. Tasty Corner is pure class. The best Radhaballavis in town are found here, and it is served with a very good subzi and an excellent chutney. The sweets are great too, notably the Gajar ka Halwa. The Lassi also tends to be top class. I rate this place very highly, but the only downside is probably the prices have escalated in the last few years; maybe to keep up with the quality.
Recommended !!

Gorge on some tasty munchies and sweets at Tasty Corner!

Those who are raking their brains to find out where this food joint is located, let me help you out - it's on 18, Anil Moitra Road, Mandeville Gardens, Kolkata. It is not surprising at all that a very few people know about this outlet. But Pathak Bhavan students and South Pointers are mad about this place. Why? Well, just try their samosas, kachoris, gulab jamuns and jalebis and you'll know why.  My courtship days were filled with regular visits to Tasty Corner. 

What makes Tasty Corner different from any ordinary sweet shop is its food quality. Whether it's their hing kachori, khasta kachori, matar kachori or paneer kachori- all the items are immensely popular (though REALLY oily). My favourite was their hing kachori which was served with a delicious sabzi (vegetable curry) and sweet chutney. There are three varieties of curry you can have with your kachori - allu matar sabji, aludam or chollar dal. I always used to have my kachoris with allu matar. Apart from kachori, Tasty Corner offers some mouth watering samosas, dhokla and dahi vadas, which are students' favourites.

I have a sweet tooth, so I never failed to try some of their luscious sweets. Their gajar ka halwa, moti pak, kalakand and gulab jamun are my all time favourite. Even now whenever I get time, I make sure I drop in at Tasty Corner to try their lip-smacking sweets and savouries.  Unlike other sweet shops, where you often get to eat stale sweets and savouries, people at Tasty Corner like to serve fresh munchies and sweets to their customers (something I really appreciate as a foodie). Fresh food is prepared every day since leftovers are served to beggars and needy people at the end of the day. Their policy is never to serve leftovers of the previous day to their customers, and that is what makes Tasty Corner a reputed sweet shop in the Ballygunge area (and in my book).

Hungry for snacks around South Point High School? Tasty corner it is! I still remember the first time I came here around 10 years back, and had kachuri. It was piping hot and perfect, and I came back over and over again to sample more food. On a recent venture, we had hing kachori, samosa and took home six dhoklas back. The food was really hot, well-seasoned and perfectly satisfying. Although prices are slightly higher, you have to also acknowledge that the location is prime, although the ambiance has a lot to be desired.

Anyone who have studied in South Point and the neighborhood institutions knows how much good is "Tasty Corner".

I first ate here in the year, 1988 and I am still doing it. Yes, its been 25 years. 

I vouch for every single item on their menu, its best on both price and delicacy. However punishing our economy may have been. they have not compromised on taste, as many others did. That's why its still "Tasty Corner". With time, they have brought some additions which were not required like radhaballabhi and option of having dal over aloo curry. Die-hard fans like me, think this was done too woo the ballabhi people and health conscious.

To me, its Kachuries with Aloo Curry and Dal Dhokla with chutney. I can gorge on them endlessly. and that too without any side effect like acidity or stomach pain. I will not name others, but "Tasty Corner" has a magical aura by which it beats them all at all the levels. The kitchens and the cooks are cleanest too. The food is always freshest. They are open from early morning to late into the night. 

I started eating here while I was in school, in college. My studies and job took me all over India. Whenever I return home, I plan with my friends, both of Kolkata and from outside, to be at "Tasty Corner". Its a ritual for all the Pointers, as the students of South Point are called. We are approximately 50,000+ all across the world. Each of them can vouch for the goodness of "Tasty Corner".

"Tasty Corner" has not only stood out being the "Tasty Corner" across generations but also has become a DNA of our lives.

The place that will forever be attached to my school memories. How often i would come here after my school( South Point) used to get over at 5.30 , and eat as fast as i could before going for a tuition.  The singaras are the best, with good blends of hot potato, ginger and gobi, which gives an awesome test to it. The amritis are awesome too. I never get bored with it. Tasty Corner, you rock!
