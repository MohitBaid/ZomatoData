The restaurant is really good and the food quality can be compared to some of the best restaurants in city.
However, staff behaviour is not good during rush hours.Maybe to some it doesn't matter that much but when u have such a good expectation from this place this kind of "finish your meal and leave " attitude is very bad..They even tell lies that certain items are not available so that you leave and  to accommodate more people during festive seasons..Kindly change this attitude
