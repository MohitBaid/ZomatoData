I came here on 25 December evening.
Solemnly swear to never come back here again.
The waiters were unprofessional from the very beginning. Made us wait for long just to give the menucard even though the restaurant was empty.  Now we were hungry af and we ordered a chicken platter. There were very thin 3 4 small sized salamis. And 2 chicken sausages. Two pieces of bread and one big boiled tomato i dont know why. And two poached eggs. There was too less chicken in the chicken platter that was costing us 300 bucks. And also the waiter couldnot serve it properly and dropped some of the vegetables on our table. Did not even come to clean it. Sheer time waste.

With that ambience they can do a lot better.

Although I've never had a full fledged meal here, the items I've ordered have always been rather palpable and the quantity, sumptuous. It's mid-range for those concerned with price.

This place is situated at Lake Gardens just opposite the Ram Mohan Mission Junior section school. The place is quite large, ambiance is great and the management along with the staff is extremely courteous and well mannered. Food quality is however not upto the mark and barring a few items like the Seafood Coriander soup, most of the other items need improvements. Pricing is a bit on the the higher side and a wholesome lunch for two costed around 1200 bucks excluding taxes. However, being one of the very few restaurants in the locality this place can definitely be tried if one feels to have relatively decent food without venturing too far out!

The place is very cheap with a lot of space with good food and good staff. We ordered bong belly club sandwich it was a huge sandwich and chicken sausage with 2 cola and a cappuccino and the bill was 580 only. There is no hidden tax or vat. The staffs are quiet friendly and they will guide you with the menu. Overall the place is good with good quantity and the quality was also satisfying.

Went with a friend yesterday. Â Place is below average.
Ordered Chicken nuggets, Aam panna, cold coffee & caramel custard. Custard was just horrible. Overall experience was bad . Was thoroughly disappointed.

Visited this place today and the food was great . We had ordered soup and the taste was awesome just perfect . The waiter was polite and well behaved but the manager had no courtsey. He came and sat in front of us staring at the tv  . And one thing i must say being such a good resturant  the owner should try to do some publicity as it is situated in an off place . Apart from that in summers ac is a must,  seeing  so many of them but none operating. Kudos.

All things are priced higher according to quality and quantity.Food doesn't taste good neither bad.In summer they don't turn on the AC(when there is 2-3 table are booked)despite having a fully closed place without ventilation thus creates a hot chamber which is highly uncomfortable for a place like where u supposed to eat and chill .

Came to visit this place with my sister. Unfortunately the place was closed for a banquet of an anniversary party. We insisted on if they could serve us the food outside and they agreed. It was really a sweet gesture on the management's part to agree to serve us food although they were having a full fledged party inside. Hence, we were satisfied to try the place of this food by turning my sister's scooty into our dining table.
But the food was really poor, pathetic is a more apt word.
Things we tried -
Bong Belly Non Veg Club Sandwich - Contained ham and roasted chicken along with cheese. The cheese was greasy and had a really eerie smell. Didn't feel good about it.
Fried Calamari - Liked eating this only because the squid tasted good in its very own qualities. The coating was thick and the oil in which it was fried was not good.
Bong Belly Fish Fry - Goodness! They charged us 130 INR for that thick piece of biscuit crumbed coat. There was barely fish in it and tasted really bad.
Both the sandwich and the fish fry were served with french fries. I will never recommend this place to others to try but the courteousness of the waiters was worth mentioning; they were kind enough to agree to serve us separately whatever we wanted in the middle of an anniversary party that was going inside their banquet. Happy Dining! :)

Nice place with a very good ambience. The place is very much new and yes the chef is on the verge of learning. The quality is no doubt good but then again only a few adjustments are needed. Like say for the toasts served with the platter are very much dry in nature. So this dryness need to be deleted.
In short cheap & best place to hang out with friends on every day basis.

I found this place while returning home, when I entered this place I was really surprised. The place is very well decorated though it doesn't look that good from the outside. I ordered a chicken burger, a milkshake and a chocolate ice cream! Was I impressed? Definitely I was! The burger was really great, and I literally mean that. The milkshake was also very well made, and the chocolate ice cream was well the best thing to end with. The prices are decent for the quality of the products. The service was appreciable. Keep up the good work.

Located in the interior of Lake gardens a few mins walk from CCD after 2 crossings on the left. Ambience is just okish. Ordered kit kat shake which tasted very yummy and a chicken bacon burger for a take way which was okish. Service is very slow, but the rates are very pocket friendly.

Absolutely amazed by this cafe. The location of this cafe is a bit difficult as they don't have any advertisement. If you know CCD (lake gardens) then go straight for about 2mins and this joint will come on your left hand side. Ambiance is excellent. Really loved it. Coming to their food we had opted for combos. In one we had fresh lime soda and chicken pasta salad and in another we had roasted chicken sandwich and fresh lime soda and along with these two we even tried their cola float. Food was great and this place is very very reasonable. A must visit for the students. Staffs were really courteous.

The place is aggressively average. I dropped into this place a few weeks ago for a quick bite, while I was waiting for a couple of friends to turn up. 

I ordered for iced tea and sliders. When I was informed that the sliders were not available and not in production either, I chose to settle for the grilled chicken sandwich instead. The iced tea was served at room temperature. On bringing it to the notice of the server, he seemed utterly confused and enlightened me of the fact that iced teas are supposed to be served the way there were, here. This went on for a minute or so, until someone of higher authority stepped in recognizing the problem and asked for replacement on my behalf. The replacement that appeared was not chilled either, but was cold enough to enjoy, hence I chose to settle for it.

After my friends had arrived, we ordered a chicken burger and fries as well. While the fries were nice, the rest of the items on the table were quite average. The place is a considerable option if you are looking for some secluded or quite time with a bunch of friends and a quick munch in a budget. Well, thatâs about it.

A refreshing new cafe which doubles up as a banquet located on the old mini bus route. The food is freshly cooked and comes in handsome portions. I tried the pork platter which was throughly enjoyable. I was promised home deliver of any item on the menu which is non liquid. Looking forward to having burgers and pork platters home delivered. I think cooking perfect rashes of bacon is a tougher job that it seems. Over cook them and you get crispy bacon which can get chewy,  under cook them and the fatty  and a raw flavour comes through. The bacon at bong belly was cooked to perfection. I have found my perfect retro cafe in Lake gardens

There were roasted chicken, ham & cheese, calamari and many more which simply bowled me out. The pork platter, recent addition to Bong Belly's menu just left me spellbound in every respect, be it taste, presentation or price. The cafe recently added some more dishes which are yet to be tasted by me and i am sure that those will be delicious as well. Thank you the Team Bong Belly.

The ambience is really good. Cosy atmosphere. A perfect place for friends and family to sit and chat and taste the delicious food.
The customers should definitely try out the ham and cheese sandwich. It's immensely tasty! ^.^
In this summer, people can also try the cold coffee with ice cream to get a relief from this scorching heat. ð
You also get to hear soft Hindi retro music which completely sets the mood :)
Besides these, there are more lovely and tasty dishes which the customers should also give a try :D
I loved this cafÃ© and definitely looking forward to visit it again with friends :)
