Want to have the best beef biryani at dirt cheap price ? Then without a doubt go and have ur packet from Adil ! Located a few blocks away from Bright street in Shamsul HUDA road, Adil has earned a name for itself in the area. Biryani is light and not oily, aloo is soft and juicy, fine Basmati rice and they give good pieces of meat too. 70 for full packet and 50 for half .Even though cheap  they never compromise on quality . Best option to fill your stomach  without burning a hole in your pocket . Would suggest a takeaway though  .

I found Adil Biryani Centre once while walking from Park Circus Station towards Seven Point crossing. Biryani here is really good for just Rs.65. I had the chicken biryani and it tasted very good. The chicken piece given with Biryani was big enough.
Total value for money.

Found this joint by chance. Best for takeaway . Went for Beef Biryani and Chap , tasted good even though it had a weird smell to it. Needs to improve on the quantity.

Good food and nice biryani. It has to work on its consistency as sometimes you get awesome biryani and sometimes just so so. Service can improve a whole lot better

This is the place to have a great plate of Biriyani. Beef Biriyani being their speciality.
But this is also a tricky place. I have been to this many a tines but have sampled diff kind of biryanis at diff times. When i went there at lunch hour say around 1pm i have got excellent piping hot and fresh biriyanis but at say 8pm evening the biriyani i had wasnt good at all. 
So advisable would be go at peak sale time. Preferably 1pm .. I have never been disappointed having biriyani whn bought at that time.

Stands out amongst all the local biryani shops in park circus besides the big names like Arsalan and Shiraz. Pocket friendly yet tasty. Only ZamZam can be a competitor if held. But off late the quality has really reduced. So opinions may vary.

If you are in park circus area and looking for quality biryani in 60-70/- then this place is a right choice,the place is little small, but you will get quality biryani in a pocket friendly range,but it's better to pack the biryani and take away home,not proper space to seat and enjoy.

Depending on the cost the biryani is quite good , the place is quite small , that's a disadvantage , at last you will be satisfied if you have just 60-70 bucks

Okay for the price. Biryani is nice and can be tried if you are in that area and want to eat cheap and best biryani. Go for it if you want to eat biryani at low cost.

Happened to have the Biryani from here once as had heard a lot abt the place but it was a major disappointment when I ate the food.. The Biryani has a disgusting smell coming out of it whic probably is of the low quality of oil tht they use and the various kind of fat tht they put in to meet their cost.. Never again ate from here..

Considering the price, one of the most enjoyable biryani places in town. Mostly a take away joint. Though the food maybe a little too greasy at times.

Cheap and best biryani you can get in park circus area. Enough said. It makes your tongue salivate and not a big hole in your pocket. â‚¹60 bucks and you're sorted.

Best biryani in park circus locality in terms of small joints. this is a Takeaway service. I used to takeaway while going to office for my lunch/dinner. I even used to take it for my friends in office. its not even a year that it has opened. very near to my place.
