Guys this is a small joint very less seating arrangement. It’s Opp Calcutta hospital. But the quality of food is very very good and the price is placed absolutely perfect. Mostly it’s of ppl coming to the hospital to visit. They would bed a place which is cheep and gives not only good food but the quantity is great. The owner is a sardar Ji. Superbly friendly and very well mannered. Had noticed him going out of his way to assist old customers and make sure they and other get the right thing on time.

My Monday Mood is all about finding tasty ways to lick my finger and honestly enough Drop In gave me that opportunity. I literally dropped in to the buttery goodness and realised that i am eating the 3rd Roti. Whoever is in search of veg food in reasonable price, knock their door. But please dont go for noodles with gravy. That's the only spoiler there. Go and try. Enjoy.

I had ordered 1 veg chow(Rs50) + 3 Chinese samosa (Rs 8 each)  + 1 chana Masala (Rs 50 )+ 4 tandoori rotis (Rs 8 each). The total was Rs 160(with tax).

PROS:-
#chinese samosa was large in size but okish in taste.
# veg chow was good both taste & quantity wise.
# chana Masala was average.
#tandoori rotis were soft.
##delivery was 20mins earlier.

CONS:-
#quantity of chana Masala was less even for a single person. 
# tandoori rotis were burnt in some places .

If you are interested in trying out some yummy punjabi food , true dhaba style this is a place- just like your corner office, this is your corner fast food joint. You should try out the their nan and dal tadka with the Paneer items. The owner is a friendly person and very receptive to feedbacks. As i used to stay close to the joint i was a regular visitor although i have moved out of kolkata my friends still visit the place. The rating is purely for the tasty food they , ensure you have Glass of lassi to enjoy the meal. Balle Balle time

Me and my girlfriend are regular at this restaurant and we have tried many things however this is for my last and very recent experience wherein we ordered paneer tikka masala which was so tasty n inside my mouth it tasted heavenly even the quantity is service was great. The best part is their staff and the onwer are very courteous and helpful. Even tried their other dishes like aloo paratha and their sabji which are awesome. One thing which is really like about this place is their hygine...Very clean..Would recommend their food if you want Punjabi veg food at the best price.

Been there for a quick lunch. Ordered for aloo paratha and paneer butter masala. Service was prompt but the paratha was not so well cooked.They messed up with aloo bharta inside the paratha. Paneer butter masala was too mediocre. Lassi was okayish, cool enogh to quench a mid-day thirst.
Place was not clean, fly was buzzing around.
Cost to quality is too much tilted.

Small, not neat, looks dirty, street corner shop, crowded. Still why would u try this place??
Its their fantastic taste and quality they serve. Has a genuine north Indian, precisely Punjabi twste they have in all their items.
For everyone in this neighborhood.. A must try.
