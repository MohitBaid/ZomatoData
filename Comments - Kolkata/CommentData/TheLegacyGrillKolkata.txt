Situated on the second floor of the Lalit Great Eastern Hotel situated right opposite Dacres Lane. 

OVERVIEW AND INTERIORS:

As a brand The Lalit hotel needs no introduction. It is a nationwide 5 star chain with some of the best properties across the country. The one in Kolkata is quite recent. While I personally feel that the hotel could have been better located, the interiors are obviously in keeping in line with the Lalit groups pedigree - Modern, eclectic and luxurious. You are greeted with a smile right from the valet handing you your ticket outside to any and every hotel staff bumping into you on your way up. 

The restaurant itself is tastefully done with couches running on one side and tables with huge luxurious chairs on the other. Personally I loved the interiors of the restaurant with its simplicity, elegance and color combinations.

WINE & DINE: 

Me and my wife were the only diners at the time and called for Chicken Ceaser Salad, Grilled Tenderloin, Kimchi and Vegetable Wraps, Penne Arrabiatta, Salty Chocolate Tart and Vanilla Bean Panna Cota.

The Chicken Ceaser Salad was served with spiced cold chicken, a cheesy Ceaser dressing, bread crumbs and olives. They served a bread basked along with it and some iced olives. The salad was absolutely perfect with well cooked chicken and the right balance between the greens and the sauce. It truly made me want to have more after I was done which in a way is the true measure of how good a dish is.

My wife's Kimchi and vegetable wrap, although decent, was a let downer in front of my Ceaser salad and I could actually see it on her face :(. While the dish had nothing wrong with, it failed to surprise or delight due to subdued spicing and Kimchi salad served with it which did not go with the wrap.

The Grilled Tenderloin with potato fondant and ham was good. The steward failed to ask me how I wanted the meat when he took the order. The meat was well done and honestly I would have preferred my steak to be medium rare. However, Supriyo was serving us with so much care and attention that I did not want to point this out and get it re done. The meat was a little tougher than I would have liked but the fresh green pepper corn sauce was great and the fondant was done perfectly. 

My wife's Penne Arrabiatta was again a let downer because of an imbalance between the pasta and the sauce. Do you know that feeling when the pasta on your plate is over and you are left with more than half the sauce?. That came 10 minutes into her main course which is the reason I had to point this out. 

The Vanilla Bean Panna Cota was very well presented with just the right amount of everything. I though the dish could have had more vanilla flavor. While it was still tasty, that punch of vanilla bean was missing.

TOP RATED IN THE CITY:

My reviews contain this section if I feel that a particular dish served to me is or was the best in the city I had eaten till date. This is my first review for a restaurant in Kolkata with this section and that was because of a spectacular Salty Dark Mousse Tart that was served to us.  The dessert was a bitter sweet symphony of flavors with different shades of cocoa. The cocoa biscuit below the tart was perfect with just the right amount of softness and hardness to give a crunch but melt in the mouth after. The Mousse and the cocoa icing on top were so well balanced between sugar and cocoa that the first bite made me go ummpppph!. Chocolate based desserts in the city have mostly become more about sugar than cocoa which is unfortunate. But good chocolate based desserts where good quality of cocoa beans have been used always have a way of their own.

This dessert for me is at present the best chocolate dessert of the city as on date. Go, try it and blow yourself over.

SERVICE:

While there were some errors, the personal care and attention made up for it. Supriyo served us with a smile and was very approachable. A special word of recommendation for him

VERDICT:

A dining experience torn between two courses -- one ordinary and one great. A few let downers but then a few show stealers also. Go for the chocolate tart. I surely will !

One of the most romantic place in whole kollata to dine-in. Its even one of the most expensive place to drop in. Nothing can be said about the high price level coz after all its The Lalit Great Eastern.
The ambience is absolutely fantastic, very peaceful and very soothing..
The staffs are very well trained, professional and informative.
The food was just magnificent, tasted heavenly..
The presentation was beautiful.
We tried Ceser Salad and Egg Devil for appetizers, Grilled Tenderloin and Fish for mains and Tiramisu and Chocolate turt for dessert accompanied with glass of wine.
The wine was of premium quality for sure.

Overall, I had a fantastic experience dining in here.
Lovely place.

This fine dining restaurant at the reborn Great Eastern can be one of the most expensive places on town. So when I saw that they are offering on option on Nearbuy of trying out a set 3 course meal plus a drink for INR 1000 per head, I decided to give it a try.
The restaurant is located on a higher floor and exudes an air of quiet elegance. Since we were three in number, we had the chance to try out a number of courses on the menu, which we did. Â Almost everything on offer, from the Caesar Â salad, to the grilled bekti to the tiramisu tasted good and at these reduced prices offered a GREAT value for money. But at the same time, I felt that none of the dishes on offer had that wow ! factor, that something extra which one expects from a specialty restaurant which normally asks for such a premium.

Dinner on a Saturday night. 

The decor of the place is old world and cozy with the brick walls and everything.

For starters I ordered the egg devil and she had the chicken Caesar salad. Both were excellent. The salad had bits of this excellent cheese that would burst with an amazing after flavour. For mains, I had the pan seared Norwegian salmon and she ordered the chicken breast. Brilliant, cooked to the right point and a good portion as well. The salmon came with this little yellow dip which was too good. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and another chocolate/caramel pastry (can't remember)- again, excellent. 

The staff was well informed and very courteous at all times and went out of their way to make everything top notch. The food as well as the wine kept coming in without having to ask/indicate anything. The food was obviously great but more than that it was the service that had us so impressed. 

Definitely visiting again!

The name says it all if you're wondering if it would be right to spend that much on food.
Kill that confusion already because the magnificent The Legacy Grill has successfully tingled my taste buds with the Norwegian Salmon fillet, New Zealand lamb chops and the smoked Tenderloin.
Now if you're planning to compare the smoked tenderloin from here to that of The Steak  Factory - DON'T. Both the preparations are different and both are worth your money.
You can as well try the fish of the day or the seared chicken breast but honestly, you'd get seared chicken breast at a lot of places for quarter the price.
Last but not the least, since we always have place for desserts -  The espresso brownie is one like I never had, and it won't disappoint you!

You got to do the Great eastern Legacy grill for blissful old world charm- in the food, in the service and in the ambience.
There is something about old time Kolkata food - be it. Mughlai or continental that is unmatched any place else. And what better place than the great eastern itself.

Be it the biriyani or the chaap or the kastoori kabab or baked bhetki- not basa mind you : fantastic and delicious. 
It's even in the way they serve the LIT. 
Just loving it- killing it with calories. And signing off with baked sondesh which is just perfect.

And the quaint retro fusion music- nice:)

On the list for every kolkata visit. 
Just wished the new decor paid more homage to the 175 year later of the property's heritage
Makes me the full bong ðŸ¤“

Pre-Launch Tasting of Restaurant Week India â˜º

Food Event: OLA Prime presents Restaurant Week 16 - 25 Sep 2016

- What is Restaurant Week India?

Restaurant Week India (RWI) is the pan India food event, wherein the participating fine dine restaurants, of the participating cities, offer a well curated three course fixed menu, with enough choices, to their diners, for both lunches and dinners, at a very lucrative and heavily discounted fixed rate, for the entire duration of the event. All the required info can be found at - http://restaurantweekindia.com/

About my dining experience:

The RW menu comprised of almost equal veg and non veg options. Each of the Appetiser and Main Course sections consisted of 4 vegetarian usual options and 1 vegetarian RW Signature option. Main Course was accompanied with Staples i.e. 3 types of vegetarian rice preparations. Dessert section consisted of a total of 4 options, out of which 1 was eggless. 

I opted for the two available RW Signature options, one of the Staples option and the eggless dessert option.

Finally, my meal comprised of -

Appetiser - 

Penko Crusted Goat Cheese - Mesclune greens, fig marmalade, Valencia orange vinaigrette:

Presented in the small circular depression of a big round white ceramic plate, this salad was a beautiful melange of bright peeping colors amidst an assortment of multi greens. 

As per the term Mesclune, which is "a salad mix of assorted small, young salad green leaves, which originated in Provence, France", the salad was a fine entangle of - green and colored lettuces, and rocket leaves. Further, there were equal sized round scoops of - kiwi, melon and watermelon. These citrus balls were colored green, red and yellow respectively. The color scheme was further enhanced by light orange colored Valencia slices i.e. the sweet hybridized orange. Fig marmalade and vinaigrette were used for dressing. Two big chunks of penko crusted and fried goat cheese and an accompanying long thin slice of toasted bread, gave the required sumptuousness to the crunchy salad. A couple of edible seeds were also strewn into this leafy mesh.

The whole preparation was absolutely fresh, and it had the right balance of sweet and citrus juices. It looked very attractive, and tasted nice. The fried cheese chunks had the right outer crisp and the perfect inner gooey texture. They tasted very nice.

Main Course & Staples - 

Vegetable Manicotti - Cannelloni of ricotta, edamame and organic vegetable and Vegetable Pulao:

A white bulbous triangular ceramic dish was served with a round white ceramic bowl of Vegetable Pulao and a rectangular white ceramic bowl of creamy Pasta. A solitary long thin toasted bread slice also accompanied this combo.

The pasta was well cooked and rich in cheese, both in the white creamy sauce, as well as the topping. It was infused with Edamame bean and some other Vegetables. It tasted nice, and the topping was well grilled, which imparted it a nice golden color.

The vegetable pulao was well infused with carrot and beans. Some fried cashew nuts were also there. Jeera (cumin) tempering and chopped coriander leaves gave it a nice flavor. It tasted nice.

The quantity served was more than sufficient for a single person.

Dessert - 

Peanut Butter Chilled Cheese Cake - Orange marmalade with fresh crisps:

After blueberry and strawberry, of late the international food circles were abuzz with the ongoing trend of peanut butter cheese cake. Naturally, I was quite happy to see this option here, and that too in an eggless avatar!

A rectangular slab of the aforesaid dessert was served in a big round white and chilled ceramic dish. It looked small in proportion to the dish, but while having, because of it's dense texture, and extremely filling previous course i.e. the main course, I found it quite difficult to savor it alone. The rectangular slab was plated on a rectangular creamy smear, upon which green pistachio slivers and a couple of dried red flower petals were strewn. Throughout the length of the cheesecake bar, a depression was created, and filled with, an inch plus long thin pieces of crisp orange rinds, cooked and coated in orange marmalade. Three irregularly shaped paper thin cookies were also placed upon them, as well as, on their side. The cookies matched the color of the rinds! Just for visual appeal, few small and big strawberry sauce droplets were arranged at a distance.

This dessert was relatively new, and it tasted nice. If you have a fancy for peanut butter, then you are sure to like it's concoction with the cream cheese. The orange crisps were a revelation. They well complimented the cheesecake, and were a pleasure to nibble on their own as well. They had a nice orange flavored, sweet-sour taste.

Since I had to wait for my co-diner, I was served fresh watermelon juice upon arrival. Finding, the main course little dry, I also ordered for an additional aerated beverage. Wine lovers can always order a suitable wine. However, these additional beverages would be charged separately.

All in all, it was a nice dining experience, in a warm and friendly ambiance.

Restaurant Week is a great opportunity for the foodies to enjoy the offerings of the prime restaurants of their respective cities, at less than half of the actual price!

Yesterday evening we went for dinner at the Legacy Grill and lounge at Lalit Great Eastern. The revamped iconic hotel of central Kolkata is situated in the business district which remains chock-a-block during the daytime, but was deserted in a Saturday evening as compared to the places in and around Park Street and esplanade. However, it turned out to be a boon for us as we were given full attention at the restaurant. Being a five star joint the ambience, dÃ©cor all were spot onâ€¦so let us go directly to the food..

Appetizer:

Classic Caesar Salad with Chicken â€“ fresh crunchy greens with immaculately done chicken breast fillet topped with bread croutons and a poached egg â€¦sublime, fresh and a winner

Egg Devil â€“ made to perfection accompanied with mustard and tomato sauce, bot of which are highly flavorful. The devil itself was perfectly done with melt in mouth kheema fillings..

Soya Honey marinated Chicken Wings served with House salad and Tomato Ginger Glaze â€“ the level of simple wings took a soaring flight because of the tomato ginger glaze â€¦very juicy and succulent

Smoked Salmon with chive cream cheese â€“ this is the winner, simple, fuss-free and full of flavor, the smokyness of soft salmon along with cream cheese â€“ simple divine

Mains:

Grilled Tenderloin with parma Ham, fondant potato and Green pepper corn sauce â€“ we asked for the tenderloin to be welldone, but it was overdone destroying all tenderness â€“ the green pepper sauce helped us to gulp it down..

Thyme marinated Grilled Chicken Breast along with grilled polenta, sundried tomato pesto, burnt garlic sautÃ©ed vegetable with mushroom sauce â€“ once again the chicken breast was too dry and cheweyâ€¦ grilled polenta was good, the veggies were fresh and crunchy, but the centre of attraction was not succulent enough..

Pan seared Norwegian salmon accompanied by potato fondant, butter tossed vegetable and saffron Beurre Blanc â€“ By far the best mains, always dependable; however, I would have liked the skin to be crispier.. the pink juicy flakes of salmon dipped in beurre blanc â€“ winning combination

Dessert

Tiramisu with Amaretto â€“ All time favorite and the best of the lot, the use of amaretto was just perfect, not overpowering the other ingredients

Vanilla bean panacotta with peppered banana â€“ the panacotta was topped with chopped kiwi â€“ did not like the banana pieces, but the panacotta of crÃ¨me anglaise was done ok, should have been a little more wobblyâ€¦

Salty caramel chocolate tart with dark chocolate mousse â€“ this was a downer, the caramel tart was too salty and the mousse, not at all salivating..

If your idea of dinner is a quiet relaxing ambience, reminiscing the essence of nature andÂ satiating the feeling of food cooked in an open fire, the Legacy Grill atThe Lalit Great Eastern KolkataÂ is the perfect place to be.
I was invited to their limited periodÂ Grill and Chill FestivalÂ that showcased 10 varieties of grilled delicacies accompaniedÂ with 7 equally relishing sauces; gushed down with a glass of wine or a pint of beer.

My fellow diner and I being hardcore non vegetarians, ignoring the vegetarian section was an involuntary action for the both of us!
However the menu does boast of pretty delicious combination of grills likeÂ Grilled Eggplant with Tahina yogurt dressingÂ ,Sweet Chilli Marinated Pineapples, etc. so vegetarians donâ€™t lose heart or your appetite.

I ordered aÂ Red Wine Garlic and Herb Marinated Lamb Chops with Pepper Jus,Â while my partner in crime ordered theÂ Dijon Marinated Chicken Escallops with a side of Mushroom Jus.

Personally the lamb chops had a perfect smoky flavour , bringing about the essence of a typical campfire night. This accompanied with grilled tomato, roasted potato wedges and onions was a total A+ affair. However, the meat was well done for my liking and I initially found it difficult to slice it with my knife; the flavour within needless to say, was succulent and highly delicious. So if you give this a try, I recommend you intimate how you would like your meat to be cooked while placing your order.

TheÂ  chicken escallops on the other hand, was bursting with flavours thanks to the generous corn stuffing within. The meat was tender and perfectly grilled, making it a top notch affair altogether.

All in all a wonderful experience I would be willing to get back to in the near future :)

Ambience is nice, I went to try it out during restaurant week.
The fried
Goat cheese I ordered was very nice and a very generous portion.
My friends wild mushroom soup was possibly even better.
The main course was not that great. I had the Manicotti and it wasn't really doing it for. Moreover the way they served it seemed a bit odd.
Overall decent place but I would probably not want to come back.

The erstwhile Great Eastern symbolized class and pomp since the time it opened in 1840-41 in Calcutta. Its numerous mentions in books, movies and memoirs testify its presence and importance in those days. When it reopened its doors once again in 2013, the one question which raised unanimously was if it will be able to match its past glory. Well, I do not have first hand experience of its previous hospitality, but my experiences at their Bakery and the Al Fresco, had both been very fulfilling. So when I went to the Legacy Grill with a friend for a weekend dinner, my expectations werenâ€™t too basic from this place.

Awesome house breads, as awesome as their attentive warm service! Lovely pallet-rejuvenating risotto ... Good ambiance but it's not an inexpensive affair : PS Norwegian salmon preparation is simply matchless!!

During my family trip last month we visited there. It feels something special for me because of the delicious dishes we get. 
The staffs were also good. Overall a nice place to dine in.

Ambience is nice, I went to try it out during restaurant week.
The fried
Goat cheese I ordered was very nice and a very generous portion.
My friends wild mushroom soup was possibly even better.
The main course was not that great. I had the Manicotti and it wasn't really doing it for. Moreover the way they served it seemed a bit odd.
Overall decent place but I would probably not want to come back.

The erstwhile Great Eastern symbolized class and pomp since the time it opened in 1840-41 in Calcutta. Its numerous mentions in books, movies and memoirs testify its presence and importance in those days. When it reopened its doors once again in 2013, the one question which raised unanimously was if it will be able to match its past glory. Well, I do not have first hand experience of its previous hospitality, but my experiences at their Bakery and the Al Fresco, had both been very fulfilling. So when I went to the Legacy Grill with a friend for a weekend dinner, my expectations werenâ€™t too basic from this place.

I visited The Legacy Grill during India Restaurant Week , Kolkata and had a very enjoyable meal. The service was excellent and I love the way the new management has conserved the retro feel of the old Great Eastern Hotel and woven it into this new avatar.Â 
The Corn Chowder was wonderful and was the perfect way to start the meal. Â The Risotto Tasting Platter was nice and Â the Prawns were fresh and excellent as was the Smoked Salmon. I particularly enjoyed the New Zealand Lamb Chops and the Tenderloin both of which were very good.The Chicken however was a slight disappointment as I felt it was a tad overcooked so therefore a bit dry. Desserts were good though to be honest I was too full to do it justice.
If you like your grills specially if your are a carnivore like I am this is a nice place for a quiet meal filled with good conversation.

So this was the second restaurant other than La Cucina which to my mind looked like a really great menu for citibank restaurant week kolkata. I was quite surprised to find such negative reviews and almost changed my mind. But we still ended up going as I have always had a good feeling about this place whenever I have come here for other events.

Anyway about the food...we ordered some of the signature dishes and liquor so there was no chance of eating within 1800 for two. For starters we ordered the chermoule prawns and the smoked salmon. Both were outstanding. Four really thick slices of smoked salmon crispy baguettes and and a fresh house salad was just the kind of simple starter I liked. My prawns too were nicely grilled l, not overdone and went well with the very balanced tzatziki. Sorry we forgot to take pictures and remembered halfway through our appetizers.

Main course New Zealand lamb chops and grilled tenderloin. The lamb chops came with pea mash and quinoa and a side helping of jus. I loved that they did that. The Indian palate most food critics n chefs say is designed to want sauce with every bite. I am shamelessly Indian that way. I drowned my lamp chops in jus and even ditched cutlery to gnaw at the little bit of meat on the meals. The hubby's grilled tenderloin too was perfectly done ( we both prefer well done, medium is too rare for us haha). The meat juicy, the potato nicely baked... what on earth were the others complaining about. The desserts were scrumptious. Lemon meringue tart with a lovely light lemony sweet filling and the esspresso brownie and icecream making a winning combination. What a lovely meal.

My only peeve is that the liquor is too expensive even by five star standards. If La Cucina can serve Italian white wines for 580 per glass surely they can do the same for at least Indian brands? Also portions could be better. It didn't bother us as our meal included appetisers and desserts but it won't fill us hungry bongs if we skipped a course.

But the last verdict? Great menu and great meal.

Went there as part of restaurant week and disappointment was the best dish served.  Firstly the manager made a hue and cry about not informing him that we were a  party of 6 instead of 5 when half the restaurant was empty.  While the servers were courteous they didn't have the basic sense to fill up our glasses of water in spite of asking them thrice. There was no bread basket provided in spite of noticing that the starters took more than twenty minutes to arrive.  For the main course while the tenderloin was good the portion was too small.  My friend ordered prawns which were not tasty while her veggies were undercooked and not eatable.  The mashed potatoes  were dry  and not savoury. The only good main course was the risotto which was really well done. The wait in between courses were too long to the extent that I had to request the server to please make it  a little quick. The dessert was mediocre which was weird because I know for a fact that their bakery is amazing and I have had a wonderful time there.  The point of restaurant week is that the restaurant showcases its  best such that I am tempted to go back to it again.  Legacy grill seemed to have not understood that point.  On paper their menu looked wonderful, it was a shame that they couldn't make it into a reality.  If the Lalit wants to have a loyal clientele and rise up to the competition of grand, itc and taj, it really needs to work on these small things which helps in making the guest feel special.  I would rather go to their Al fresco which has great food.

Was looking forward to dine here for a long time and finally went there yesterday. While I was pretty impressed with the brick and wood interiors and the ambience of the place, I was disappointed with the food and service. We'd ordered cream of chicken soup, smoked salmon, grilled chicken breast, lamb chops, grilled bhetki fillet and grilled prawns. It took them around forty minutes to serve the soup. Main course took alot of time too. In terms of taste, the food was nothing extraordinary. The desserts, however, saved the day. Espresso brownie and Lemon Meringue Tart were pretty good in terms of both taste and presentation.

The grilled tenderloin & salmon has made our day. Enjoyed single malt very much on a lonely evfening. Good place to chill out, & classy as well. The staffs including the manager are quite vibrant & energetic. Would love to come back. Ideal place for the private parties.

The restaurant is having heritage look. It was really nice for a change to relax in such a quite place with its own heritage charm. The grill food great during its cocktail hours. We were suggested the Lamb Chops & Fish of the day. Good Job Mr. Kunal & Tushar.
