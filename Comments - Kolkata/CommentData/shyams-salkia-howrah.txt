By far one of the best sweet shops in the city. From Rosogolla to Sandesh to Jayanagar mowa, very well made.
They also make dahi vada and dosa which is descent.

Well to be honest with my review i didn't went to this place personally. But i had the tasty sweet of this place which came to my house.

It was a Rasmalai which came to me. The Rasmalai was really sweet and equally tasty. Very soft indeed and good in shape and size. Folded in the upper crust and the inner crunch was really feeling good. Contained in the plastic wrap seemed very good.

RASMALAI : 8.5/10

THAT'S ALL For this review.

North Indian Snacks are just horrible!! Service is too cheap along with the very tiny place. Regarding the hygiene, its so so. Apart from the snacks, variety like Choco Sandesh, Mango Rasogolla in sweets section, bit of to justified for the brand.
