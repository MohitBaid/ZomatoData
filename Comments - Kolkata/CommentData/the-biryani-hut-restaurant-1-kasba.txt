Perfect quantity, perfect taste and super cheap what else would you want. Yes the ambience is very ordinary with nothing fancy so may want to consider taking food home. The biryani is just perfect and the chicken/ mutton pieces are very tender. The momos and very nice and pretty big in size. Overall very good food which is pocket friendly for most.

Decent, good enough for some Kolkata street food lovers. They serve good Biryani and some chineese dishes.
Being pocket friendly, a good hangout for students. The only negative, the place is not air conditioned, so will be a thumbs down during summer noons.
Service is quick and decent.

Called them and ordered for Chicken Biryani. 
They delivered it within the stipulated time they had mentioned.
The biryani felt more like the ones made at home. The quantity was decent, good chicken and potato pieces, no complains regarding that.
I believe the prices are a little high as compared to the food.

Biryani Hut is a standard roadside eatery with a non-AC and AC section accommodating about 20 people rougly. Other than their dining customers, there is always a queue for takeaways and that's what caught our attention. Irrespective of which day it is, the staff members are always on their toes for cooking, serving and packing. 

So, one fine day when the lingering aroma of the biryani, reached our noses, we could no longer control our inquisitiveness and ended up ordering the following items. 

1)Standard Double Chicken Kolkata Biryani @Rs.130.00 (4/5) : [Sufficient for 2, with a moderate appetite.] Small eateries serving biryani, have the tendency to add kewda and rose water to an extent which is much higher than the desired level but the biryani served here, was spot on with the aroma part. It tasted quite good with well cooked rice, a flavourful potato and well cooked chicken. The special biryani comes with 2 chicken pieces and 1 egg.

2)Mixed Friedrice @Rs.110.00 (3.2/5) : [Sufficient for 1.5] Typical bengali friedrice with independent grains of rice and standard amount of shreded chicken, scrambled eggs and prawns. 

3) Mixed Chowmein @Rs.120.00 (3/5) : [Sufficient for 1.5] This was oilier than the other dishes. Again, more like a roadside shop serving Chowmein - just with better ingredients and better noodles.

4)Hot Garlic Chicken @Rs.100.00 (3.5/5) : [Sufficient for 2] There were 8 chicken pieces but were a wee bit smaller than it should be. The gravy was spicy and hot to the taste buds. Pretty decent.

5)Chilli Fish @Rs.120.00 (3/5) : Again, there were 8 pieces which were a bit small but you cannot expect any more for 120 bucks. The quality of the fish was very good. However, I wasn't a very big fan of the gravy. 
Next time, I would make sure to go for the 'dry' version of the chinese side dishes. 

6)Chilli Paneer @Rs.100.00 (3.5/5) : [Sufficient for 2] This gravy tasted the same, but the paneer used was very good!

7)Vegetable Friedrice @Rs.60.00 (3.5/5) : [Sufficient for 2] At just 60 bucks, a plate of vegetable friedrice is a steal deal. Tastes quite decent.



A person with 250 bucks can easily eat till they are full. Pretty reasonable.

Recommended. ✌🏻
Happy eating. 😁😁

Biryani Hut which is just 2min walk from Acropolis Mall prepares one of the best biryani in town. In just 80 bucks their biryani is just brilliant.
Its far from my place but whenever I go near Kasba, I always keep time to visit this place.
The restaurant may not look good or they may not have a good ambiance but what do you want more then a high quality chicken biryani at Rs.80.
Beside biryani they also serves a good Chowmine, take the mixed Chow, its full of chicken, prawn and egg and a full plate cost just Rs.120.
This place is really good for regular visits and specially for students if you want some budget place in sacrifice of the Ambiance. And they don't ask any Tax which is again a good point in lowering the overall bill.

The place is very close to my home. Occasionally have briyani from here. Its basically a fast food joint with plastic chair and tables for dine in facility. Nothing about the declaration. The Chinese fast food and the Indian fast food are cooked in a open kitchen. The place his crowded and hot because of the open kitchen. 
I ordered 3 plate chicken Biryani at Rs 80, Biryani comes with 1 juicy tender soft chicken, one flavorful potato and lovely long grain nicely seasoned fragranced rice.
Overall it's a nice place to have cheap take away. Definitely a try.

My friends swear by their biryani and had ordered for their food at their place. Good quantity biryani. No dalda is used in their food and it is evident when you use your hand to eat and later wash them. 
Big container filled with rice and big piece of potato and a meaty piece of mutton. 
This was accompanied by chicken Kasha and they had requested for all leg pieces and the pieces were big and chunky. Having such good food during a good weather really is satisfying.

Went to this place without any plan one day for lunch.  Since we lived in the area, we packed chicken biriyani and had lunch at home.. The biriyani was good, I would say, above average.. But, again, keeping all the points in mind, the quality, quantity, price and ambience, we would probably never go there again..

Had been to Vasan eye care hospital nearby and thus,decided to take a few packets for dinner and take something to eat as well for the moment. Ordered 3 Chicken rolls and 6 plates f Biriyani. I don't like sides with biriyani as without it I can eat 2 plates. Nice taste...quantity is sufficient but not at all happy with their chicken size,bones mostly. Their potato was so huge that the rice was not there...next time ill tell them to give me more potatoes and no rice. The restaurant is located too far from the main road, thus u have to walk a bit. Ambiance is nice..calm. Take away is my option mostly. Their rice tastes fair and the biriyani is rich as well. Tried out their chicken roll as well. It was ok. The meat was so soft that I had only the paratha to chew. I doubt the chicken was fresh.

DO FOLLOW ME IF U LIKE MY REVIEWS. I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT INTENTIONALLY.
