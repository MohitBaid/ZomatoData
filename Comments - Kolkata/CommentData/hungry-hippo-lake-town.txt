Small, casual place. Pocket friendly. 
Limited menu but good, quality food item. 
Courteous, prompt staff. Order time is not long. 
The pasta dishes are a must try. 
 Recommended for any casual, random food rendezvous.

The food is good. But this isn’t a place you would love to dine in on a hot day. There is no space and it’s just good for low cost takeaway food.

This place is apt for college students like me. The range is affordable and plus it's cheap. The food is good. The cheese sandwich is jus appetising. This place was recommended by a friend, even though it's vegetarian, I must say I like this place. I have order food twice from here and it has satisfied me to the fullest in these two orders. Would love to order again. Thank you!

This place is just the most disgusting place in Lake Town and Bangur. The place is maintained well and the owner has made a lot of efforts to keep it up to the mark but all his efforts are in vain when the food is so much disgusting.  We ordered a corn cheese Maggi in which the Maggi was not properly boiled we returned the food back to them again after correcting it tasted the same. And same condition was with vada pao and corn Sandwich.  The Sandwich had he'll lot of mayo which tasted sour and not properly grilled.  And horrible the staff is too. 
Please shut down the outlet if you cannot manage your food.

Visited today with my sister for an evening snaks. This place is located behind lake town nursing home. Its too easy to find. Ordered cheese corn sandwich, corn jalapeno sandwich and cold coffee with ice cream. All the three items are so freshly served. Sandwiches are tasty and sufficient for a person. Cold coffee is tasty too. You can easily hangout in this place when your pocket condition is little tight.

The outlet is not quite big. A few chairs , so better to stand and eat. The owners and the Friends were sitting there. They tried to find a good edm song to play , but sucked at it. Although the place is very nice and very cheap. We had the signature garlic bread, paradise pizza, cold coffee and litchi krusher all of which came under Rs 220 only. The garlic bread was very nice but the pizza was not as good as expected. Beverages very nice. Service is a bit slow though. Nice for a small meal or something. Would appreciate if they expand their business and improve their food!

This place is a disgusting place.  Though one can easily get attracted to it by its well maintained looks but the main criteria food is just pathetic. In their language they call mayonnaise as cheese they fool people by serving mayonnaise in all the dishes instead of cheese.  And more over disgusting is the attitude of the staff in the argument. Please shut down the outlet if you are here to fool the people. Will not even think to come to this joint again.

I recently discovered this tiny joint through Dwight and I was very impressed with their dishes. Although they have a very limited menu serving only veg snacks at really cheap prices, it's worth a try. The cheesy garlic breads and the vada pav is really good for small bites at pocket friendly prices. Whatever you order, make sure you have these two dishes especially. :)

The four star rating is for the garlic breads and vada paos. The best that you can buy in Laketown. Pastas and sandwiches are ok, nothing special though decent quality, filling and pocket friendly. Haven't tried the Maggi or Wai Wai or drinks, would like to try them someday. Must try the garlic breads and vada paos. Super delicious and pocket friendly.

Small outlet, but offers good food at reasonable pricing. Do not expect any fine dining experience here, but if you are looking for some quick snacks and combo offers, this is the place to be. The Burgers and Vada Pao's are some of the popular items here, but the showstopper for sure is the Garlic Bread. Must try, if you around.

If you know toaste adda then you can see the outlet of hungry hippo if you just look at  your opposite left. This is a very small place with some chairs. 

We had : Signature garlic bread and cold coffee with ice cream combo.

 The garlic bread was big in size but didn't taste good. It lacked seasoning and flavour. The cheese on top of it was less in amount. Now coming to the cold coffee with ice cream, what it actually was we couldn't figure out!! It tasted horrible. Seemed like Cold coffee lacked coffee flavour. The vanilla ice cream I think was of half a scoop. Didn't like their food at all.. the service was also very slow. It is just a okayish kind of a food outlet. Probably not going to get there back. I'd prefer toaste adda over it......

I was at Lake Town Area last evening and was looking out for a vegetarian fast food joint to satiate my hunger. Noticed Hungry Hippo as we parked our car on the lane. My curios soul told me to try out the new joint once. And there I was wondering in front of the shop to eat or not to eat there. There wasn't a single customer so I was a bit apprehensive but then I thought what's in trying the food once. The person at the counter was cordial and asked us what we would like to try. The menu was in front and on browsing through we found quite an interesting spread starting from garlic bread, sandwiches, pasta and various types of Maggi. Along with this you also get a variety of cold coffee and shakes. We ordered for a cheese garlic pizza only. It didn't take much time to be served. I found the dish to quite good and it was perfectly baked. The quantity was good for one and the price was very reasonable. Though we didn't order anything else, yet we have the intention of visiting this outlet again to try out other items from the menu. They also have various combos which is economical and trendy.

I have been ordering online from both  the outlets (Diamond Plaza and Lake Town) of Hungry Hippo for quite some time. All I can say is that the food is good considering the price.

I have tried all the type of pizza,burgers, sandwiches, pasta, vada pav, maggi, waiwai, crushers and smoothies they have on menu. Most of them were good.

They just need to improve on the packing part. Items like Burgers, Pizza and Garlic Bread gets messed up in the packaging.

■ Avoid Crispy Chilly Babycorn and Crushers

■ My favorites from their menu are Club Sandwich, Pasta Alfredo, Signature Garlic Bread, Cheesy Vada Pav, Veg Extravaganza Pizza with some addon toppings, Cheese Burger, Mexican Burger, Spicy Maggi, Spicy WaiWai, Mango and Orange in Smoothies.

Hope that helps :)

Well, believe me when I say that I had planned to visit these guys (Hungry Hippo) when they used to operate nearby the Diamond plaza mall @ Jessore Road – but unfortunately couldn’t as I was informed that they had relocated to Lake Town. So, today, I visited them @ their Lake Town address – and believe me that all my efforts definitely were not futile. You need to walk may be just for a minute or 2 - leftwards from the Big Ben @ Lake Town to reach them!

From the outside, the place might not clinch you much – as it is pretty small, and the kitchen taking up majority of the area – seating space is just too small and it is impossible to provide tables for dining. You might just have to enjoy your stuff either while holding in your hand or by placing it atop another stool. It was nice to see that they were running several combo offers – which obviously carried a discount on it’s head! I decided to go for their cold coffee with ice cream as well as their signature garlic bread – which were served within a few minutes. Coffee was fine, although, the temperature was too moderate – expected it to be much cooler – but, still, it was fine. What disappointed me was that the cap of the coffee cup was too loose and kept coming off! Was neither served a spoon to eat the ice cream afloat the coffee, nor was served any tissue papers – both were made available only on request.

Coming to the show stopper – indeed a signature item – their garlic bread! Well, we don’t often get 5 slices of garlic bread – topped with mayonnaise mixed with several vegetables and baked to perfection – for just 60 bucks – and yes, it’s exactly what I got here! These breads were almost perfect – sprinkled with oregano seasonings as well as mild chilly flakes and served with ketchup – indeed the face-saver and goal-scorer for this outlet.

Hygiene might be an important factor @ this outlet and I had a difficult time having my food – specially when I am being bothered by scores of houseflies.

Prices are low, quantity served is decent and service is fine. They definitely have a long way to go and need to work hard in the highly competitive Lake Town food market.

May be their prices are low but the quality is just below the average. They serve a Rs 5 maggi with only the maggi masala in it and charge ot Rs 30 I mean we can make it at home thn why eat it at ur outlet.

Those who have experienced food at this place might question me for putting a 3.5 rating against this food joint. Well, to answer your question, I would like to iterate that the guys who are running this joint are not putting you in any gimmicks; setting an AC place up infront of your eyes with designer interior decoration and well polished waitors ending up with a 23.5% Vat+Service tax - Nope!! There is an inherent message, "Boss, hum chhote aadmi hai...jo hai bas yehi hai....par khana aapko aachcha khilayenge, yeh guarantee le lo" 😀😀!!
We dropped in here while returning from office. Located in the lane beside Wow Momo and Toaste Adda, this place, as I said a very small shop with few tools for outside sitting. We took a random glance at the menu displayed very properly just at the door and ordered for one cheese maggi and one plate of cheese garlic bread. Being an oregano lover, I spreaded some of it over the maggi and that definitely added bit more extra taste in it. But the garlic bread was out of the world. Trust me, in 60 rupees you won't get such soft garlic breads anywhere else. The maggi was also very nice. Waiting time was not that much, the stuffs were very courteous and zeal for performing above and beyond was very evident in their attitude. While watching me taking snaps, one of them asked me to put review and also asked separately if we liked the food.
Of course bro!! It was really good and you have much long path to go to get renowned among more people.
One suggestion I would like to mention based on the menu (if I have not missed it), they should add non veg items as well to pull more crowd.
P.S: Swiggy supported!! 😎😎

This place cannot change. I had visited their jessore road outlet  while my visit to Hanuman mandir I saw the outlet of hungry hippo here . I had been requested by Mr gaurav the owner of hungry hippo to visit the outlet again after a bad experience with their outlet at jessore rd. I was assured that this time the i will be served with good food. But to my surprise the food here was more disgusting. I couldnot find the trace of the owner there was a staff only sitting after placing the order who unwillingly made the order. I guess they seroiusly need to put a check on their recipes. And please stop writng cheese on the menu when you only have to give mayonisse loaded in it.
And no more trials for hungry hippo.
Cannot risk my money for the third time.
Thank you
