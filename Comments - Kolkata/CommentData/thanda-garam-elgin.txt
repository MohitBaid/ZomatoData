A small kiosk inside the food court. The place offers very basic stuff. Tried coffee and slush from here. Was decent. Prices are economical but the place needs to improvise to sustain.

Want to have cold drinks then this is the separately designated kiosk. This kiosk serves both cold and hot drinks, as suggested by the name. Of course it's not exclusive as all the other food kiosks in the food court also serve cold drinks and one even serves hot coffee.But this is there and one can avail from here if on so desires.

It is located on the Food Court - the top floor of Forum Mall. It is just a small outlet and got nothing much to describe about it.

The beverages it provides are just so okayish and nothing satisfying which gives them a lincese to charge such rates.

Avoid it in all your might!

Located inside Burp! Thanda Garam is this outlet that sells  small varieties of drinks. The beverages are plain average. Mostly items here are not available. I personally was not much impressed with their drinks.

This is so far my lowest rating. I really can't describe how disappointing the drinks were. We ordered a Virgin Mojito and a Fresh Lime Soda. There's hardly anything that can go wrong. Yet, the fresh lime tasted quite bad. There was not balance between the sweetness and the acidity. Definitely the worst I have ever had. The Mojito was quite nice when I had them first sip. I quite liked it. But after having a quarter of it, the rest had no flavour! It was literally tasteless! I really felt cheated and would not like to ever truly this place again!
The only reason I am not rating any lower is because the prices are kind of low and the drinks were drinkable, I mean they weren't so bad that we had to just throw them away!

Horrible beverages! Gave me a bad stomach :( they did not have aam panna available. Settled for something they suggested Nd it was bad. My friends jal jeera which is the simplest thing to make was also not well made. Would never opt for this place... Thats rating was for getting served at our seats! Lol

One of the best places to have fresh beverages at the Forum mall. The cold coffee which I had ordered for, was decent as well as reasonably priced.

Only beverages! Yes, that's it. This little corner joint located in the food court of Forum Mall only serves beverages. The options are very little to choose from as they only have 10-12 items in the menu. Nevertheless, Fresh Lime Sodas, Aam Panna, Jaljeera and Ice Teas are available on a hot day to please you.

I and my friend took one Fresh Lime Soda each and found it quite refreshing. My friend says he likes this stuff so much that he can drink even 1 liter of fresh lime soda everyday. Sadly his thought was far away as this outlet has only one cup size available. The cup is somewhere between small-medium but there is no other option such as a large one.

Pricing is a bit high if you consider the quantity. Service was mediocre, first of all there was no one at the counter and we had to wait for the guy to come, then don't know what took him so long but our actual food came well before the soda. Nevertheless, he bought the fresh lime sodas to our table at last.

All and all, despite of having so less options, people will still visit this outlet as the food court doesn't have any other beverage stall available. However considering the size of forum's food court, this outlet is wasting a good stall space. If they don't bring some good options such as seasonal fruit juices, chocolate shakes etc., I would call it a waste of space.

Location: Food Court (BURP!), Forum Mall.

Thanda Garam is a counter right beside Cream and Fudge Factory which has a fare consisting of beverages.
As my friends and I were on our "relive the old days" mode at BURP! and were already done with our meal, we head towards this counter to flush it down.
I called for a Soda Sikanjee whereas my friends called for a Fresh Lime Soda and a Jaljeera.
- The Soda Sikanjee tasted just near decent.
- The Fresh Lime Soda was great to taste.
- The Jaljeera was okayish. Passable.

The staff was polite and the service was found to be quick.
Prices felt a pinch in regards to the quality.

Overall was an above-average experience.

This small outlet is located on the "burp food court" of forum mall at 5th floor. They generally specializes in various types of refreshment drinks like sodas, lassis etc; their offerings are pretty limited, which includes- fresh lime soda, soda sikanji, fizzy shakes, lassi, masala cold drinks etc. Among everything the "fresh lime soda" is served with perfection over here. So after a heavy meal this is the perfect place in forum mall to give some relief to your stomach and to freshen up yourself.

This is the beverage counter in the Burp Food Court of Forum mall.The one place at Forum food court where one can actually get plain mineral water!! I sometimes wonder if I am the only one who feels that when you are really thirsty plain drinking water is much better than any other soft drinks or whatever. Anyway,during such times,I have found this outlet to be useful. Apart from this the other sodas and mocktails on offer are okayish and more or less refreshing.The Soda sikanjee is decent.But then again I feel the prices are far too high.If you are in need for some much needed refreshment this outlet could be worth a try.

This is the beverage counter at food court in forum mall though with limited options to order. The fresh lime soda is pretty good for a 50 bucks otherwise most of the items are from vending machines be it a aerated drink or the tea, coffees. Jaljeera is decent, aam panna is not yet tried by me though appreciated by most of the fellow foodies but i would suggest one to stick to their fresh lime soda apart from the standard machine stuff.

An average place with an average price with an average presentation and average service. That would be gist of the review I am about to give the place. Have tried the following:
 soda shikanjee: Pretty average. Had ordered salt but the amount of salt was pretty less
mango panna: tangy and good 
deep blue sea: Could have put more ice and less of syrup.
Tea: Could have been a bit more strong.

Overall a decent place when one is running out of options and does not prefer any kind of cold drinks.

An average place with nothing to boast about. It serves cold water, cold drinks and the normal beverages like sikanjis aam panna and likes 

since I'm trying to avoid cold drinks nowadays soda sikanji has been my drink of the season. The soda sikanji here isn't bad and it will cool you off almost immediately. A little expensive compared to what it should be charged, however the location matters!

Located in Burp ! the Food Court at Forum Mall this is a decent little place to grab a beverage especially if you have been on a shopping spree and want to chill for a bit. The Soda Sikanjee is pretty good  as is the Aam Panna and Jal Jeera and they are all perfect beverages to cool one off in the hot Kolkata summers. The Lassi was something else I tried but did not like at all ... a bit watery and had a strangeish aftertaste !

There are places that serve soda and there are places. This outlet at the 5th floor food Court at Forum Mall does one thing well, that is their Fresh Lime Soda. It is not inexpensive by any means, at Rs 50. But with prices sky high everywhere, at least you get fresh lemon, and not a watery tasteless mess. I wish the serving size was larger. Also, the plastic straws tend to float and fall off the plastic glasses.

They also have Pepsi brand soft drinks, Lemon teas and Masala Sodas.

I tend to have a fresh lime soda here because apart from it being healthier than sodas, there is certainly more taste than in the watered down ones they serve at other outlets.

Ok ! this place has nothing worth writing about . It is nothing but a soda joint in the forum mall food courts. With vending machine coffee and iced tea the place is quite lame . Only thing barely drinkable is the jalejeera and the lime soda / shikanji . The staff looks lost > very very uninspiring . 

Colorful mucky plastic glasses of pre-made drinks are very very repulsive .

This is the place in Burp where you can get cold drinks and other beverages.
I never forget to take a fountain pepsi from here whenever I visit Burp. They also sell masala cold drinks which they preoare very well and lemon ice teas. Staff are friendly and prices are reasonable. Only one or two staff are present there.
i would rate 3.5 for THANDA GARAM.
