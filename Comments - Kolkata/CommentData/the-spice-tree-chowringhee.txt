Located in Metro plaza, this is a favourite place for all the hungry people who are on a shopping spree! 
I love the Pav Bhaji and the cheese pasta here! 
Vada pav is also one of their popular items.

A small snacks kiosk inside the Metro shopping center. This place serves good snacks and I have always found the food to be fresh and well made. Have tried items on two occasions.
The dahi papri chat was surprisingly well made. The corn cheese sandwich was good. Loved the filling inside. The veg steamed momos were tasty though a little too salty ( maybe it was the case when I tried). Momo sauce was good.
The prices are reasonable and I find their menu has a good variety.

Overall a decent place to grab a quick snack.

"The Spice Tree"
It's located in ground floor of metro plaza shopping mall,,(outside),,where the entrance and exit gate it will be in right hand side...
Whenever I go for shopping I tried their food...
It's quite reasonable..
They served fresh and yummy vegetarian foods..
I just loved their "VEG CHEESE CORN GRILLED SANDWICH",,"CHILLY GARLIC CHOWMIN",,"PAV BHAJI"..
Sandwich is really yummy with potato wafers..(5/5)..
Noodles also good... tasteful ...(5/5)
They don't have seating arrangements..but you can eat in metro plaza mall(fountain area)..and you can seat there and eat..
Overall good...best vegetarian food joint...
Next time I'll try corn chat..

This eatery is located on the ground floor of Metro Plaza from where you enter the shopping complex and also exit from here. So if you want to can have food from here before shopping or after shopping. They have a wide variety of sandwiches,chillas,vada pao,burgers, pastas etc. Their stuff is mostly good and reasonably priced
 I like their chillas and sandwiches. Value for money 
ðŸ˜ƒDownside....no sitting place, the authorities discourage sitting on the stairs and so one has to stand and eat!ðŸ˜ž

There is one item you should definitely try when you visit The Spice Tree - Metro Plaza.. CHILLA !! You can go for cheese chilla or paneer chilla as you like.. This was one thing I did not commonly find at stalls or food courts around so I always preferred chilla.. It is a very common dish in UP usually made of moong dal or besan..Â 
There was no such seating arrangement so you have to sit on the stairs and eat !!

**Location = Metro Plaza entrance, Ho Chi Min Sarani.

**Brief = Have been there many a times accompanied by my shopaholic Friend :P

**Ambiance = There are no seating arrangements, but the servers are really quick.

**Things tried = The Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are awesome, served with potato wafers.
I have also tried the chillas,pav bhajis and corn chaats(which are very popular amongst their patrons).
They prepare it fresh and the food is really good.

**Recommendations = Cheese Grilled sandwich and pav bhaji.

**Purse Check = Rs.250/- is enough for 2 people .

**Overall = Definitely a good vegetarian food joint and will be going back for more.

Cheers!

This small eatery is located jst near the entrance of the metro plaza in the ground floor.. It serves veg food only comprising of sandwiches, momo's, burgers, chillas, corn chaat,vada pao, maggi, pasta...as we were not much hungry we ordered for a veg steam momo.. The stuffings of the momo was good and the outer part was soft too.. Preety decent to say.. We also opted for a corn chaat which had whole lot of coloured capsicum, corns, tomatoes and it was good too.. The service was prompt and the outlet was pocket friendly too !!
