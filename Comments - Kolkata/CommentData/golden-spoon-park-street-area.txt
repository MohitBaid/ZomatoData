Nice place for people looking for a budget restaurant.The ambiance is good,but it is a little bit less spacious. I went there with friends had hakka chicken noodles, Manchurian chicken,lemon chicken. Every dish is worth a mention. Only grievance is that the waiting time is long.

Happened to be in Park Street with my friend on the Christmas Day. It was next to impossible to find accommodation in any restaurants of Park Street. There was huge queue everywhere and even fast food joints were overcrowded. We were really hungry and the hour called for some deep digging, hence we found this small restaurant off Park Street.

The restaurant Golden Spoon, is extremely small no-frills restaurant and to our surprise there was absolutely no queue and even the tables were empty. Though the restaurant houses in a two floor building, the ground floor has nothing but the billing counter. The first floor has 5-6 tables and probably the kitchen is also located in the same floor.

Talking about the food, this restaurant serves Chinese and North Indian preparations. We opted for Chinese menu. Tried dishes were Hong Kong style Chicken Chowmein, Chicken 65 and Red Pepper Chicken accompanied by Fresh Lime Soda for beverage. Hong Kong style Chowmein was mildly spiced and had that peppery taste. The chowmein was well tossed and was less oily. Chicken 65 was descent and had all the required Chinese flavours to it, slightly oily though. Red Pepper Chicken was supposed to be a gravy item but somehow ended up being a dry preparation. It tastes nothing like Chinese at the first place and more like Indian chicken bharta style. The dish was too oily and completely killed the taste of Chinese cuisine.

Ambiance is noisy as the tables are too close to one another. Air condition unit is located uncomfortably low which causes the food to get cold. Staff would occasionally switch off the air conditioner and turn it back on after some time. Since it is a no-frills restaurant, no proper decor can be seen in the restaurant.

Service is descent, the food was brought to our tables in about 15 minutes. However the lime soda took ages to come. Billing was done fast.

Final verdict, can't say a must try place as there are several restaurants in the area. However this restaurant can be a savior during festive seasons when there are huge waiting times outside other restaurants. Food can always improve and be a little less oily.

A less known food joint in park Street area. If you want to go for a cheap restaurant in park Street then you can surely go for this place. You may not like the ambience first, but once the food come, it will grab your attention for sure. We ordered the chelo kebab platter. It was good. You will surely get the 'value for money' thing here. The only problem is there is no washroom in the restaurant. The authority should think about it.

One of the best low medium budget restaurant around park street Area. Prices, food quality, quantity and staffs behaviour everything is okay. They won't take any GST added to bill. The prices mentioned in their menu is included GST.
450 for 2people (approx). The location in the heart of park Street area, just beside Peter cat and opposite KFC.
But inside the restaurant the place is very narrow and in a short place all the tables are arranged very congested.. the only reason I gave them 4/5. Otherwise I would hv easily give them 5/5

An amazing place on a budget in park street. It is right opposite McDonald. The place is really small and a bit claustrophobic but the food makes up for it.  Tried the peas pulau, chicken tikka butter masala and butter nun. Every single dish was worth a mention. If they have a better ambience, the place would become a sure success. Will definitely visit again.

Had been here with friends for an early lunch on Christmas this year. We had decided to pop-in for the early lunch since we know how the scene would get soon enough (when we left, the queue outside was pretty big). It was nearly empty and were seated immediately. There were six of us. Service was cordial and prompt as soon as orders were given. We had ordered Veg Fried Rice- this dish didn't seem to have much of a flavour factor and seemed much like a what a health-conscious person would love to have. It seemed much like polao. Secondly we had Kung Pao Chicken and Schezwan Chicken. Both were really tasty and had a good blend of flavours though the flaws were that the Schezwan one lacked the peppery kick which is a hallmark of the Schezwan cuisine and Kung Pao chicken lacked roasted peanuts and sesame as we'd find in an authentic Chinese Kung Pao. But, nevertheless it was a pleasant lunch and I thank the people of Golden Spoon for having us.

We(8 friends) reach the restaurant around 2330 hours and are asked to wait. Wouldn't mind waiting in such Christmas ambiance. Staff comes to take order 15 minutes after we are in. Since it was a long order, we asked him to write. But the other staff described the one who was taking orders as "computer hai, bhulega nahi". Unfortunately, seems like the hardware crashed that night. He messed up all the orders. After 10 requests at least, water glasses appeared. No complimentary pickle or salad present. Worst staff and tasteless food. Hope to never visit the place.

We were a group of 8 who went there for Christmas eve dinner! And instead of being greeted, we had to face the rude behaviour of the staff. The waiter wasn't writing down our order, even after being asked to do so several times, and later he brought us food that we had never ordered in the first place, the chicken main course was really bad, with oil instead of gravy, and I can bet there was a hair in my food!
Overall, a very bad experience in terms of food and service alike! The best of the evening was the laughs that we had because it seemed that the waiter was high on something!

Considering it's offerings, I'd say this place is quite underrated. Situated just beside Parkstreet's Baskin Robbins and right opposite to KFC, this is a not so big, pocket friendly restaurant that serves both Indian and Chinese. 
Won't talk much of ambience because there isn't much to talk about. It's small, it's simple and that's pretty much it. Service is also good, didn't have any issues during my visits.
The food here though, is absolutely excellent. Be it Chinese or Indian, it doesn't disappoint you plus it also comes at a very reasonable price. It's good in quality, tastes great and also comes in good quantity. I'd say most main course dishes might even suffice two if you have a low appetite.
What I've had -
1. Cheese Nun - must try
2. Garlic Nun
3. Chicken Butter Masala - must try, goes well with Garlic Nun and Cheese Nun.
4. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala
5. Chicken Chanp
6. Hong Kong styled Chicken Rice
7. Garlic Chicken
8. Chicken Hakka Noodles

Overall, a must try place for everyone out there. Be it for the price or not, you'll enjoy what you eat here.

On your way to Loreto House and right opposite to KFC in Park Street is this quite old restaurant offering sumptuous mouth watering Indianised Chinese cuisine. Pretty petite place, might seem a bit too congested but don't let that overshadow the truly delicious flavours that this place adds on to the items on the menu. In budget friendly prices, you can satisfy your hunger pangs here with your company. Ample quantity and quick service add on to why I totally loved my experience here!
•Try the Egg Hakka noodles - lightly tossed noodles in spices and sauces which can go well with any gravy side dish that you order.
• Egg Fried Rice - Sufficient to make two people full, nicely cooked. 
•Crispy Chilli Potato - My favourite! I could have completed one full plate all by my own. They were indeed that good. Lipsmackingly delectable! You must try this on the menu as a starter or a side dish-  goes well as both.

Visited this restaurant during the Pujas. Went with friends and had a good time having tasty food. Although all the dishes were good in taste, hygiene is a huge factor that they should concentrate on!

We ordered Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Konjeey Chicken for starters. Then placed an order for Hong-Kong Style Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmein, Kung-Pao Chicken and Garlic Chicken. All the dishes were tasty. But their service was late which made us a bit irritated. But during the Pujas it is quite natural too. The staffs need be more courteous and friendly.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 600 for two (approx.)

So when you are hungry and looking for cheap options in Parkstreet area go for it. The rating is just for food don't expect any fine dining ambiance. This place is always crowded but not a lot though you can always manage seats.

I love Chinese  so ordered from Chinese menu but also tried their Indian menu in my previous visit. We ordered Chicken mushroom soup, konjee crispy chicken, Hong-kong style fried rice and Chicken in hot garlic sauce. The taste of konjee crispy chicken was just simply awesome, we loved it. The other dishes were also as per expectation and quantity was also good.

The staff was fine and good service. This place is good value for money.

Golden Spoon is a very cozy joint tucked in a corner of Park Street , right opposite KFC and near Loreto College and Loreto House School. I have often visited this eatery during my one hour lunch breaks on college days. This is a gem of a place when it comes to good and cheap food. It's a multicuisine eatery so there is no dearth of options. I feel their Chinese and Indian food items are very good considering the price. This is the go to place when Park Street is highly crowded and a must visit for college students on a budget. They have lovely chello kebabs. It is quite comparable to what is served at Peter Cat barring a few differences . Their chicken malai kebabs , crispy chilli baby corn and rolls are very well made. Special credit goes to their gravy chow as well. I'm a little particular about Non-veg Cantonese style noodles and this place did not disappoint me. A big plus for this place is that the food is served piping hot. The only problem that one might encounter here is that the eatery has very limited space and one has to climb a steep flight of stairs to get to the tables upstairs. However the joint owner tries to maintain it as well as possible. It is air conditioned as well. This place is not for those looking for ambiance. It is for satiating ones hunger when on a budget or when other restaurants are too crowded or when you just feel like trying something a bit different . I would definitely recommend this place. It is high time that such pocket friendly eateries start coming up in park Street and are given due encouragement. Just for the food I'm giving this place a rating of 4.

This is the go to place when Park Street is highly crowded and a must visit for college students on a budget. They have lovely chello kebabs. It is quite comparable to what is served at Peter Cat barring a few differences . Their chicken malai kebabs , crispy chilli baby corn and rolls are very well made. Special credit goes to their gravy chow as well. I'm a little particular about Non-veg Cantonese style noodles and this place did not disappoint me. A big plus for this place is that the food is served piping hot. The only problem that one might encounter here is that the eatery has very limited space and one has to climb a steep flight of stairs to get to the tables upstairs. However the joint owner tries to maintain it as well as possible. It is air conditioned as well. This place is not for those looking for ambiance. It is for satiating ones hunger when on a budget or when other restaurants are too crowded or when you just feel like trying something a bit different . I would definitely recommend this place. It is high time that such pocket friendly eateries start coming up in park Street and are given due encouragement. Just for the food I'm giving this place a rating of 4.

Located in a posh area Park Street Golden Spoon automatically attracts a humongous crowd who love to eat rolls.
This place is not only famous for rolls but also for chicken lollypop and baby corn.
One must try fried rice and various naans which Golden Spoon provides with.

Cost for two- 500
Where - middleton row, Park Street

I have had many wonderful rolls from Golden Spoon but never had dinner... So when I decided to order some take away and it turned out so wonderful it wasn't a surprise.. it was more like reassurance... I ordered the chicken reshmi butter masala... It was actually cooked in butter and instead of the north indian red it was the mughlai white curry.... And very subtle and not too hot!!!! I loved it! The butter tadoori roti was soft and a perfect accompaniment.. I also ordered some salad for the "greens" and it was ample and great!!! I will certainly order more often!!!

This restaurant is Located just after peter cat ! Its a very small and clumsy space , so if u go there on a busy day u have to wait for long ! And also the service is quite poor as there is generally only one person who is serving ! Next the food is good ! We ordered konjee crispy chicken and chicken biriyani ! Both of them were nice.. Also its not that heavy on your pocket !

Located right opposite to Park Street KFC, the restaurant is easy to find. With a seating arrangement on the first floor, it is good enough to host about 30 people at once. The food tastes quite good and the quantity is amazing! They lack a bit of professionalism though. We ordered Crispy Konjee Chicken, Egg Noodles and chilly chicken. The starters arrived much later after we started our mains. Service is okayish. But value for money is good again. An apt joint for college goers. Wouldn't regret visiting again.

Its has been my all time favourite since my college days.Its not only pocket friendly but serves really delicious food.Both Chinese and Indian dishes are equally good.Very recently I visited the restaurant with a friend of mine,we ordered pan fried chili fish,butter nan,chicken resmi butter masala and cold drinks.The nan was really soft and and the chicken gravy had 5 big pieces of chicken.So the quantity is good enough for two people to share.The best part of the meal was the pan fried fish.The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was spicy and yummy.Overall  the bill came up to 520rs for two inclusive of taxes.
I really like the quality of food here.If you are looking for an option to have a delicious meal in Park Street area without burning a hole in your pocket do visit this place.

When it came to rolls it was always Golden Spoon. As a child, I loved the rolls of Golden Spoon. It used to be large in size, with proper chicken fillings. Over the years, the quality of the rolls have degraded, and it isn’t as it was before. The rolls don't taste that bad even, but no longer as good as it used to be.

Very lowly priced food but the quality compared to the price is high. We ordered fish fry and crispy chilly baby corn along with lime soda. The fish fry was obviously not made with bhetki but tasted good. Crispy chilly baby corn was yum. But the only demerit of this place is it is always crowded and the sitting area is so small with 2 waiters only who are always busy and hardly listening to people.

Mouth watering rolls at its best. The delicious aroma is definitely going to attract you to this joint located right beside Peter Cat and opposite to KFC. It is the best place to grab an on-the-go roll specially for working men and Loreto students. 
The rolls are made out of a very soft melt in mouth dough knead. They are large in size, fresh, hygienic and filling... very very different from local roll shops. Moreover you can see the staff preparing your roll through the transparent glass and can ask for any changes/add-ons you feel like. My personal favourite is egg and paneer roll. 
Oh yes for a proper budget meal one can take the stairs which leads to a small dining hall. I have a very faint memory of the dining since I visited sometime in 2013.

And the dishes they serve are just too delicious.There is nothing to talk about the ambience.It's air-conditioned and cleaned(it's definitely small) so if you're looking for a good high-fi sort of dinner/lunch, this isn't the place to visit.The waiter is very well behaved.
Iv tried almost all the dishes here and none seem to disappoint me.From North Indian to Chinese, everything is just yummalicious !! 😁
This time I had a Chinese Combo(priced at Rs.199 only) and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup.Simply splendid.No extra taxes applied on the menu price.
It will always remain one of my favorite go-to-place in Park Street. Just love it !! ❤️

A very small and humble joint smack in the middle of big time restaurants and legendary outlets, Golden Spoon offers you good quality food at a very very reasonable price.

Pros -
i. Food - The gravy dishes of chicken are absolutely delightful. The snacks are good as well. Must try - Crispy chilly baby corn.
ii. Price - highly cost effective given the location at the heart of Park st.
iii. Prompt service.

Cons -
i. Food - yes, a downside is some of the things in the menu are not so good, special warning about the biriyani and chopsuey.
ii. Less spacious - the place is small and tables are cramped.

Overall -
If you are looking for good quality food at a very reasonable price at Park st, then Golden spoon should be on your list. It has just the right mix to be a go to restaurant for general purposes. Do not expect much regarding ambience and signature dishes though. Golden spoon is that budget restaurant which fills your tummy with good quality food at a reasonable price, and makes you come back for more.

Edit --
On my recent visit today, a new dish surprised me, Pan fried fish. adding a +0.5 to the review.

Took my gang there for a pending treat! It's a really pocket friendly, cosy little place.. there is nothing much to talk about the ambiance. It is comfortable.
We ordered Kulcha, chicken bharta, Egg fried rice, Egg noodles, red pepper chicken.
And food was good, the quantity being decent.
The only reason I give this place a low rating is because .. we found a hair in one of the dishes. Though they replaced it on being informed, however compromising with hygiene is a big NO NO & I am not going back to that place again!

Tried their pan fried chilly fish and konjee crispy chicken. Both were very spicy and tasty . Food was satisfactory both in quality and quantity.
Though the pieces of the fish were small but still it was okay considering the price .

Service was prompt enough . 
The place was less spacious but overall ambiance was okay .
The best thing about this place is you get a variety of cuisine at a very less pocket pinch.

So yesterday we hopped into this place after golden dragon was closed, because this one was the closest.
Me and my friend went thr, the ground floor was for the culinary things...and the 1st floor for dine out.
Actually this restaurant has been expanded...previously it used to hv a lil space...now it can easily accommodate 40ppl at once.
The decor and ambience was okay...nothing special to mention abt.
Coming to food, we ordered :
Starters :
Pan fried chilli fish : this one was really tasty..they brought out the exact taste of pan fried chilli fish... But they used a specific fish which wasn't basa or bhetki either, which interfered with the taste.

Main Course :
Kung pao chicken : shredded chicken pieces with sweet spicy sauce without cashews...this was disappointing.

Mixed Hakka noodles : this was fine.

• Portions were ample.
• Service was fast... But again their staff took my glass of water without asking.

One thing great about this place is that its cheap. ✅

Well, I'd like to say that is a good place for hangout.. The ambience is moreover nice... The food quality is also satisfactory but which I noticed is that the service is not proper...At first if anybody enters in a restaurant... Sits on his/her table.. The first thing to do is to serve the water... The waiter was not so Cooperative...we're continously asking for water and he was unaware of our calls.. This striked me the most... This is something really unexpected from golden spoon... So I cannot help it... I wish to give 4.5 for the overall atmosphere... But it dropped just for the service purpose... But i must say the food quality is Amazing...

The place is good if you are looking for some good food but not that expensive, this is the place one should go at. The food is average and so is their service. Only one server seems to take all the order which undoubtedly makes it time consuming. The server also does not make a note of all the orders that he is given. Which makes it difficult for him to remember all the dishes ordered and mix the orders. Other than that the food joint is not that bad.

Just great. Yes it has a small space than others. But it will sure entertain your tastebuds. Fried rice, chilly chicken gravy, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken roll are best.

Another pocket friendly eatery in and around Park Street area. I have been to this place quite a few times and suggested a lot to pay it a visit.
The sitting area is small and cozy but absolutely comfortable. Their Chinese section is better than the North Indian section. The quality and quantity of food are both upto the mark with the price.
They also have an fast food corner which i never tried.
If you are broke as well as hungry then rush to the Golden Spoon and thank me later.

I was just passing by this restaurant and i suddenly saw that they have  outdoor counter for rolls nd kebabs only for a Quick bite or a takeaway. 
So i quickly grab a Chicken Rolls fr a quick bite &  the taste was good enough, paratha was thick nd chicken pieces are big but they put lot of capsicum in it that ruined the taste a little bit but never mind..@  ;) 
It cost 50/- nd its worth it..  :D

Good Food at a easy price. Really nice to know that there are places in Park Street where you can go with someone & have food within Rs 500.
Very close to Peter Cat this place is small but good. 
But ya not good for elderly people as the stairs are too steep but for young guys nice place to hangout with pals.

Golden spoon restaurant is located in park street, kolkata that is in heart of kolkata.it offers both cuisines that is north Indian as well as Chinese food.   ordered mixed fried rice and dry chilly chicken for dinner And best thing it's really pocket friendly .And food was good.specially their dry chilly chicken was too good,nicely balance of spice and sauce. Rice was aromatic which made the dish more appetizing.

It's really value for money.

Great pocket friendly place for students.

Golden spoon is a small restaurant located at Park Street beside Peter Cat. It serves you good food at a cheap price. We tried chicken reshmi kabab, chicken achari kabab, red pepper chicken, kung pao chicken, pan fried chicken, schezwan mixed fried rice, mixed fried rice, mixed noodles. Both the kababs were really good n a must try. In the main course I really liked the red pepper chicken. Pan fried chicken along with the other items were also good. The staff was also very polite.

Went their long time ago... nothing special about the place... only positive thing is... it was one of the most pocket friendly place in the posh Park street area... we tried their chicken cheese roll n the all time favourite chicken drum stick... both were very tasty... also had their mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noodles, garlic chicken n chilli fish... all tasted very good... the reason behind such average rating was... firstly the the place was pretty un hygienic... secondly the staffs are very causal... thirdly service was very slow and last but not the least they served one of our strict vegetarian foodie a veg biryani in which we found some traces of chicken... not at all acceptable... I'm rating it rather high... if I consider the last point hardly... Consider this 3 as 0...

It's a very small place, very cramped with very limited seating area. The ambience is also nothing much to talk about. But the food is reasonably good. They have North Indian, Mughlai and Chinese cuisine. All are Good. But what I like the most are their rolls.....They have a great variety and I have had their paneer roll and potato roll. The paneer roll was delicious but I'm not a big fan of the potato roll. In Chinese their Hakka noodles and veg Manchurian were quite good, nothing exceptional but great value for money. Their black dal and paratha too were good. So this place, though ambience isn't great but prices are slightly less and food reasonably good for the price.

The restaurant is on the cheaper side among the other restaurants in Park Street but it does not compromise on the quality of food. Of course it is not as good as Peter Cat or Bar BQ however, if you are on a budget this is the place to be while you are at Park Street. If you compare this restaurant with mobile phones, you can call this as the One Plus 3 among the Apple (Peter Cat) and Samsung (Bar BQ).

Golden spoon restaurant is located in park street, kolkata that is in heart of kolkata.it offers both cuisines that is north indian as well as chinese food.this is a budgeted restaurant and pocket friendly restaurant.it is small sized restaurant but it has always lots of customer .i mean this place is always crowded which symbolizes that food is very good and prices are reasonable.though this place has less number of tables and chair and somewhat clustered.SO I should say it has average ambiance and average decor.

I am a student of loretto college so one day after college we friends were damn hungry so we dropped in.we ordered crispy chilli baby corn, schezwen noddles, Manchurian, veg rice and chilly paneer. we were served in 15 minutes and we were dying out of hunger.crispy chilly baby corn is damn tasty and the noodles were very well cooked.To be precise very well cooked even a five star hotel would fail.

I loved the food of this place.best part of this restaurant is it is pocket friendly.helpers out there are very helpful.i would next time get food packed for home.

It wasn't Christmas though, but still the mandatory Park Street visit during winter is never complete without some nice food and a nice adda at a nice place. And Golden Spoon served all these criteria perfectly. Firstly, the food is "yummy" without any second thought. someone should have watched me licking the last drop of gravy. Secondly, the quantity is ok too... Just the place could have been more spacious.

Located just beside peter cat in park street this is a small but cozy restaurant. We were really hungry when we walked in. 
We had ordered for mixed fried rice, mixed gravy chowmein, hot garlic chicken, crispy chilly babycorn and fresh lime soda. 
The drink never arrived. Almost at the end of our meal when we asked about the soda they informed that it was not available.  
The food was below average.  Just because we were damn hungry we were able to complete the food. The rice and the chicken were like any other roadside stall. The noodles were with no taste whatsoever. It was just boiled noodles and a starchy gravy for us. 
The babycorn however was average.  
Coming to the service, i must tell you that the staffs are really confused and miscommunicated among themselves. 
1.We were first served with a plate of hakka noodles. On being told that it was not what we had ordered for, the waiters were almost fighting among themselves in front of us. 
2. We had to almost shout out to the waiters for our bill. Nobody was even interested.  
3. On getting the bill which had amounted to 1580, four of us had checked the amount  and it was absolutely ok. The waiter took the money away and came back saying 100 rupees was less in it. We were pretty confused as to how it could have happened as four of us were absolutely sure that the amount was perfect. I am not sure about the intentions of the waiter but it was fishy. 
If these things are taken notice of i guess this place has a lot more potential.

Honestly, Golden Spoon is one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata. Can't count how many times I have hopped into this restaurant. I have tasted almost 70% of their food items. Their Chinese cuisine is better than Indian cuisine. Very cheap and pocket friendly. Absolutely perfect dine out destination for students. Chicken 65 does worth a try. :)

Located in the lane of park street church,if you walk a few steps after Peter cat you are going to find this place.
This is a small place which can accommodate less number of people. This is mainly famous for the different kind of rolls it serves.
I have been a fan of this place because of the kind of roll they serve.
The veg roll is itself a delicious one but if you take chicken and veg roll you will just love it.
The chicken roll is also quite good.
The size of the roll is quite good and it's according to the price they ask for.
I have recently visited the place and they are maintaining their quality.

Gist: A pocket friendly small place with great Chinese & Biriyani. Behaviour of staff is bad. If you are in park street and missed the entry in any well known restaurant, try this, won't regret.

This place was visited during lunch hours around 35-40 times maybe. The place is small with seating arrangement on 1st floor where only hand washing is possible. It can accommodate 4+6+4+4+4+4 people. If you consider the price they do serve great biriyani and Chinese at park street w.r.t. quality and quantity. Rolls are good not great. Behavior of waiters depends on their mood. Service time can improve.

Golden spoon is a pocket friendly restaurant in Park street. The ambience is not good and the restaurant is very small and cramped . The ceilings are very low and the stairs are very small and uncomfortable. The worst part is the fact that they do not have any restrooms The service also takes time. 
 However, the food is good. We tried the mixed fried rice and the chicken manchurian. The mixed fried rice has a lot of shrimps in it and the portion of the manchurian is also quite large . 
All prices are inclusive of tax.

Went there yesterday with a group of 11 people. We had to take 3 tables and they were readily available. This restaurant is located just opposite to the Wyx night club. We were greeted by a narrow staircase which was difficult for a single person to climb. The first floor had a low ceiling. It was so low that we had to stoop our heads low while entering. The service was on the slower side. We had ordered for Tandoori Roti, which came with a thick crust, Veg Biryani, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Butter Masala and Chicken Do Pyaza. The chicken biryani and the chicken do pyaza was good. But the butter masala wasn't praiseworthy. The veg biryani was nothing but pulao. Prices are pocket-friendly. A moderately good place to have a bite if you are low on budget.

It's very hard, as we all know, to find a pocket friendly restaurant for a college goer at Park Street. I had heard a lot about this place. So it came 1st to my mind when a friend was looking for an affordable restaurant to have lunch. Since then it has become one of our usual diners at park street.
Yes, the food is very good. The noodles, the biryani, the kebabs among various other delicious dishes, we found to be very good. Quantity is satisfactory. The reasonable price is a win-win thing!
The only drawback for me was the space. The place is very small and stuffy. Though the cushioned seating arrangement makes it cosy, there is still a space crunch for a big group. Seriously, if u r planning to visit here with a large group it might be an issue.
Despite this, I'll definitely encourage people to visit this place, without a doubt! Happy foody-ing! :)

Don't judge a book by its cover. This saying goes so true for this place. Golden Spoon Resturent. Overall resturent is over a very small area with even smaller seating arrangement. The ground floor has Hardly 10 seates and 20-seater arrangement on the first floor.
But. the main thing is Food. It serves heavenly, finger-licking delicious food.   I still can't get over the taste of the food their even when I visited 2days back.  
We ordered for 
•Tandoor Butter Roti. which when served was hot and melted butter on top of that. You can even eat the roti alone without any side dish! 
•Plain Nun- tasty.
•Chilli Mushroom- Awesome. Large mushroom pieces in hot chilli gravy. cooked well.
•Chicken In Reshmi Butter Masala.- This goes the best with randoor roti. The taste of Reshmi butter masala on chicken is such a pleasure for your taste buds!
•Chicken 65- Nothing to say about it. Just go and try once! 

All these tasty foods and a bill of only 630. Plus the behaviour of the waiters is so good that it makes the food tastier. 
Highly recommended place!

We just had some starters and north indian dishes.The quantity of a north indian delicacy doesnt even serve two properly. The staff members are arrogant and not at all friendly. The place is very congested and you have to adjust everytime the waiter passes behind or by you.They also close early.Plz avoid this place.

I am seriously dissatisfied with this restaurant!
That is mainly because of a waiter, who had the sheer audacity to ask me face-to-face if I would pay the tip in cash or by card!!! Who does that! That too while we were standing infront of the cashier, who didn't bother either.
Firstly, unlike other restaurants, the food wasn't served by the waiter, so he practically had no extra role to play.
Secondly, the food itself (Mutton rogan josh and Veg malai kofta, with butter naan) was quite ordinary to taste and was limited in quantity, the gravy in both the items would barely suffice, as it was mostly oil.
I didnt really wish to pay any tip, but was tactfully coerced to do so!

Small and cosy place but a wonderful taste!! Located very close to Park Street the place offers a variety of great food. But the rolls are simply too good. Perhaps the best in Kolkata. My personal favourite is the double egg double chicken roll. It’s enough for a meal. You wouldn’t need to have anything else after it. Moderate on service time and cost as well. Rather a better place to hangout with your buddies and have quality time!!

Just a step from my house the outlet is like the next home for me whenever i feel like grabbing a bite. The taste is good but the servicing and the sitting could be improved much more.

A small restaurant in Park Street , which may not look impressive from the outside , however the food they prepare is excellent and this is what makes you want to visit this place time and again.
Recommendations :Double Chicken Roll, Chicken Fried Rice, Red Pepper Chicken...

The place is very small.. Maximum 4people can go in a group.. But the most advantage is the price is very pocket friendly .. If u have a small budget then u should go at golden spoon. One thing you should try that is konji crispy chicken because its awsoem in taste. The looks of the golden spoon is not so good but the food is good :) it is very good for school students

The rating that I gave is solely for the food. The restaurant is just like any other small eating joint. Nothing special about it. But, the food comes in hugeeee amount. And its super tasty. Totally worth your money. My taste buds have found that this place serves the best drums of heaven!

How would you lime to see dripping blood from tbe chicken lollipop that you just ordered??Well,as far as i know my attraction for food has taken me to places like mocambo and even a roadside makeshift fast food shop but it was utter disappointment that the same happened with me upon asking the waiter about the blood on the plate!!Platters like mixed singapore noodles and schezwan chicken was ok.Uploading pics is just for the sake of increasing my rank in zomato & not for the popularity of the food hub!!

With a number of big businesses dominating the restaurant scenario on park street, a small fish like Golden Spoon would soon be a non entity. Therefore, there must be something special about the place for it to reign on Middleton Row despite big, popular names around it. 
Well, in my opinion, this place, though like a ship's cabin in size, can create quite a food storm. Firstly, it has the best kathi rolls in the city. Apart from beef, you will get a whole range of rolls. Unlike other places, its vegetarian rolls are great as well. It serves tasty Indian cuisine and Chinese dishes. 
A plus point on the edge of glitzy, pricy Park Street is the reasonable pricing which enables college students and office goers from the area to frequent the place. Those who have to think twice about entering Peter Cat or Mocambos can easily saunter into Golden Spoon for a fulfilling, delicious meal or stop over for a roll. 
A cosy place for friends. The rating given is for the first rate service and food quality.

One of the more underrated restaurants, in the midst of heavyweights like the 'Peter Cat' and 'Olypub'.
Apart from the rather cramped space, the restaurant serves some mouth-watering Indian and Chinese dishes.
Service, the second and final item on their con's list, could be better in my opinion.
Visit this place any time other than the Durga Puja, and I guarantee that you will find yourself coming back again and again!

A nice place to hang out. The staff is friendly and cordial. The food is good too. And the expense is on the lower side. Just the place is quite small so you get to hear everything the other person at the other table is saying. Other than that I guess it's a nice place. We ordered Mixed fried rice and Chilli Chicken and the food was okay. The chilli chicken seemed over cooked. Fried rice was good.

We had a club solitaire card.. And we were eligible for a 15%discount, just to deny that the manager issued our bill before we even completed our order when we complained he came up with the nonsense that make a fresh order of 300 plus and they will discount 15% on that 300 bucks... And i haven't seen such high ended and to some extent rude and mocking replies coming from a manager as i experienced in Golden spoon...! This is not it.. We went in a gang of 7 ..6 of us took biriyani we all are sick suffering from food poisoning.. We have our doctors certificates as proof.. Please do not fall into the lust of having cheap food in a tax free zone..!

A very small place. Recently had been there for my friend's birthday treat. Although the food here is super cheap, but also that will be reflected on the taste of the food. Except 1 or 2 dishes, the rest were not worthy of having. Also, half of the dishes that we asked for seeing the menu weren't available. 
In short, it was a really disappointing experience.

Situated near peter cat. Dine in section was on 1st floor and on ground floor they have kitchen. From outside it looks big and beautiful but actually it was average looking and medium in size from inside. Ambience and hospitality was average. Service and more or less good and presentation & plating was also good. Pocket friendly price and tax included menu. First i ordered veg roll which was in taste very good. Spicy and full of veggies potato masala in less oily paratha. Liked it. Recommended. So far everything looks fine on average so what's the reason behind such low rating. Let me tell you... Second dish i ordered was veg biryani it was also very tasty. Aromatic and full of veggies but in vegetarian biryani i found chicken pieces inside it. Yes when I asked the waiter he just say sorry and take the plate with him and gave me the bill of rolls. Being a vegetarian this was very big issue for me but restaurant didn't did anything about it. 
It was a suggestion for restaurant management that please upgrade for cooking way. You cannot simply cook veg and non veg biryani together. 😠

At Saturday lunch we thought of going to a less crowded restaurant nearby office so visited Golden Spoon.
We had typical and very common dish which include Chiken-Mushroom soup, egg rice ,egg noodles & dry chilli chiken .
As these are common food so we had no complain with the taste & quality.
Their quantity is more than any other restaurants. (1 plate of noodles or rice is enough for 3 ).
However the concern is with the payment , its a small place and very congested along with 1 POS that too with lazy staff make it more horrible. Carry cash than card for this place.

Located opposite to Park Street KFC in the Middleton Row. Came here with a few foodie friends of mine last Sunday. It's a very basic kinda restaurant with take away arrangements in the ground floor. The ambience is nothing kinda boast about when you go upstairs climbing a very narrow flight of stairs.
We had ordered Chicken Cheese Roll, Chicken Drumstick, Mixed Fried Rice and MIxed Chowmein along with Hot Garlic Chicken and Hong Kong Fish as sides. The starters and the staples were very basic. Tasted very ordinary. The chicken side was pretty good, so was the fish which helped us throughout the meal.
Would want to share an important event that had occurred. We had a vegetarian friend accompanying us that day who took a veg biryani for himself. There was a chicken piece stranded in the plate of his veg biryani. Although they wanted to change and get a fresh one, this kind of incidents are just not expected. That's all I had to share. Okay for visiting once. Definitely not worth repeating. Happy Dining! :)

Park Street and its associated neighborhood has always been adored and admired to be the booz & gourmet zoned party hub since ages. And in recent times, one of the names that has acquired a status of 'talk of the town' is "Golden Spoon", located on Middleton Row, a few steps from "Peter Cat".
However, this small cramped up place happens to be overhyped out and out, and the food served is completely average stuff, with nothing much to mention apart from the pocket friendly pricing.
And service too need vast improvements, specially when it comes to professionalism. One just can't be so casual to serve a veg dish to a vegetarian person that turns out to have chicken flakes in it!!

High time to buck up, to sustain in long term!!

A very small restaurant just some steps away from peter cat, this is also one of the favourite eatery for the college students for it's reasonable pricing and big portions. We tried the cheese chicken roll which was a bit oily but tasty never the less. Other that that the mixed rice and mixed chowmein qere nice. The chicken and the fish items were also good to taste. The drums of heaven was though a bit ordinary.

I have heard a lot of people talk about this place so finally dropped in today. Over hyped in my opinion.
Started with chicken cheese roll..the paratha was too oily and it tasted okayish. 
Ordered drums of heaven. The pieces are huge but they are not cooked properly and the sauce was a bit sour for my taste.
Both the mixed fried rice and noodles were just about okay. The chicken in hot garlic sauce and Hongkong fish were the saving graces.
The worse thing that happened was that we had ordered a veg biryani as one of our friend is a vegetarian to the core. But there was a chicken piece in it!! Just imagine! Thank god he had seen it at the right moment! 
Makes you rethink stuff you ordered in a restaurant which served both??

Being a past pupil of Loreto House , Golden Dragon is always going to hold a special place in my heart. The rolls are a personal favorite. Yet if you do have some time on your hands you should go upstairs. Though not incredibly spacious it has been done up pretty well. 

The waiters are polite and the food is alright. 

Ps_ I didn't have enough change to give the waiter a tip so he was very rude and said giving a tip is mandatory. I can't deny that that  did put me off a bit, though I cannot entirety blame him. Waiters do work hard and barely earn enough to keep body and soul together.

Still for rolls a one visit is a must.

So we ordered both combo... Except dal makhani all the items from both meal was excellent mostly the kabab and chicken 65 and up to the mark and the best part is both the meal was just in 199/- each,its damn cool and very low priced in this area,So I recommend to everyone that you guys definitely tryout their food at least one time,you guys loved it.

Imagine you are in Park Street area, stuck in the afternoon due to some job and gotta have lunch. But lo, you don't have enough in your pocket to afford a meal in one of the costliest places of Kolkata. If that's the case, look no more and just walk in to Golden Spoon. 

Golden Spoon offers good food, nice ambience and air conditioned cooling as well in an area like Park Street but without burning a hole in your pocket. That, I think, is one of the greatest strengths of Golden Spoon. 

Coming to the food, the quality is quite up to the mark. However, there's only one waiter serving in the first floor which is air-conditioned and he sometimes messes up the orders and brings you something else altogether. But that's not much a problem for they readily take it back too. Just ensure to clearly state your order and repeat it once or twice or insist on writing it down if it's a long and complicated one. Delivery of food is a tad bit slow but not something unbearable.

This is one of those places you visit with your friends. The food here is affordable and worth the money. The Chinese dishes are better than the Indian ones . The chola bhatura is filling and enough to stuff you up. The biriyani is not as good but would not call it bad either. The ambience is friendly and cosy  to hang out with your group. I have been there often and would recommend you to try the Garlic chicken, the chola bhatura and the rolls.

I am a bit polarised on this one. If I am not mistaken, then Golden Spoon is among the oldest and most renowned restaurants in Park Street Area. Despite that, this one is just an average place to eat.  Located just next to Peter Cat, this restaurant is a poor reflection of the exuberance of the Park Street. 

We ordered Tandoori Roti, Hakka Noodles, Chicken Do Pyaza and Crispy Prawn for our lunch. The noodle was standard Chinese, nothing out of the extraordinary. The chicken was juicy and had ample amounts of gravy but again, you could find the exact same thing in your neighbourhood outlet. The prawn was the thing that I liked the most. It was crispy and yet not too  greasy. 

The eating area is on the first floor and by eating area I obviously mean the eating cubicle. The place is very congested and we had our heads two inches from the AC. There is also the thing with the crowd. In the case of heavy demand, you might need to stand outside and wait for a while. Apart  from these minor glitches, the place is okay for a quick bite or two.

I went there yesterday after some shopping and found it to be nice. Situated next to peter cat, this place is easy to find. They have the restaurant in the first floor. The seating place is small but nicely decorated. Coming back to food, we ordered tandoori roti,peas pulao and chicken reshmi butter masala. The roti was okay,  the pulao was very tasty but the chicken reshmi butter masala stole my Heart. It was just too good with the chicken being very tender. It had the perfect blend of the spices and i ended up eating the major part of it. The best part is that they don't charge any tax on the bill which makes this restaurant secure a good place in my favourites' list. :)

located just beside peter cat and opposite to kfc in park street, this small place serves really good dishes at a very pocket friendly price . it is usually crowded . now coming to the food , food is also delicious and very cheap. tried some of their indian dishes  like chicken tikka butter masala with garlic naan and paneer nan. i would like to add that , its better to take butter naan rather than those fancy naans which are no better.  there were 5 big pieces of chicken in remi butter masal , looked awsome, tasted delicious . looking forward to taste chinese dishes. last but not the least . prices are inclusive of vat and service tax also :)

I Visit This Place Very Often. Food Is Decent,Specially Indian. Unpredictable,At Times Food Is Awful..  Space Is Too Small. But If You Want To Have Some Decent Food At Low Price Then Golden Spoon Is A Good Choice.

A good place to hang out with a negligible pocket pinch...the food is good and the service is good but they do take some time to serve the food which is irritating when you are too hungry...otherwise the seating arrangement upstairs is quite good and it is quite a calm place with a broad mirror to take a perfect groupie.. :)

I think this is the lowest I've rated any restaurant. But let me tell you, this is because they deserve it. 
I'm very irritated by my experience. Being an ex-student of Loreto, this has been my go to place for the last 3 years. Amazing food and cheap rates. But the management sucks big time.

Yesterday I brought my school friends here, and we were disgusted by the service. 
No, I'm not complaining about the food, it was amazing as usual. We ordered Mixed Hakka Chow, Chicken Hakka Chow and Garlic Chicken, which we washed down with sweet lime soda. 
Pocket pinch - 540

Now coming to the worst part, right after we finished our food, we were sitting and chatting deciding what to order next. And suddenly this guy comes up and hands us our bill. Yes, even before we asked for it!
I had a 15% discount card which I couldn't avajl of course as they had prepared our bill from before hand. I went and spoke to the guy at the counter and asked him, which restaurant ever hands over its bill before the customer asks for it? He was extremely bad behaved and told me that "it seemed that you guys had finished eating and were simply chatting. This is no place for chatting. After you're done with eating you leave."
I was flabbergasted. It disgusted me to the core, and I'm never ever coming back. 
And one more word to the management, I was an ardent fan of this place all throughout my college days, but how they ruined it for themselves.

Compared to other Park Street places, this place is cheap.

Cosy place, nice ambience.

Peshawari Kebab Full Plate: Lovely. Enough for appetizers. Beautifully soft and aromatic kebabs. Not too dry at all.

Chicken Sandwich: Not dry at all, with ample chicken and mustard sauce.

Red Pepper Chicken: Another beauty. Pieces of chicken in a spicy, tangy sauce. Quantity is a bit on the lesser side when shared.

Konjee Crispy Chicken: This was my personal favourite. Shreds of crispy chicken in a sweet and sour dressing with three kinds of bell pepper that just blew my mind away. 

Great place for birthday treats, and prices mentioned on the menu card are inclusive of taxes.

Had not a very good experience... The waiter bought paneer butter masala when ordered dal makhani...a lot of dishes were not there...the biryani was average. They could manage to get just two plates , we ordered four. It was just 9:15. The naan ordered was hard as a rubber. The paneer was totally bland...no flavour no spices...paneer monchow was average..the paneer was not cooked properly..schezuan chicken was good...starters were costly but good

Horrible food. How can an outlet make such food. Ordered 1-chilli chicken and 1-veg haka noodles for take away.
The chilli chicken was worst than what is available on street side, the gravy was nothing but thick soya sauce,there was no taste in the chilli chicken apart from the taste of soya sauce. A piece of black stone was embedded in a piece of chicken.
The noodles were worse. Filled with only capsicum and onion, these half cooked noodles looked horrible from the time we opened the box.
Stay away.

Golden Spoon is located just opposite to park Street KFC or beside Peter cat... either ways, every easy to locate.. They have a roll counter downstairs.. I have tried their chicken roll once, it was extremely oily.. Other times, I have had their biryani, chicken tandoori and some Chinese dishes.. Those were decent enough.. the sitting area is upstairs.. it is a very small place with a low ceiling.. so if u r a tall person, do mind ur head!!

This tiny place located near loreto house and opposite KFC screams of affordability.
The quality of food is good enough at that price..
You wouldn't expect excellent ambience or decor at this place, all you get is a more than decent eatery with air conditioning and at a place like park street it's a steal for college kids on a shoe string budget.
The staff is courteous and speed of service is good :)

After having the disastrous roll at Anamika, I decided to have something more tried and tested. So I took off for Golden Spoon in the evening.
 Golden spoon serves a whole menu of north Indian food, but their main business is their rolls.
I ordered for a Chicken roll, and yep it was prepared right in front of me, I was able to see the entire process though a glass window. 
The roll they served was amazing, the parantha was thick and crispy so it gave a good bite of what i am eating and when you hear the crunch sound while taking a bite that is when you should know you are having a very good roll. Even the filling was tasty, spicy and flavourful. They didn't add in keema but just pieces of chicken and onions.
As usual every roll consist of raw onions, sauces, lemon, chillies and coriander topping. Though i suggest they should add green chilly sauce for people who don't like green chillies( I am one if them).

I highly suggest to take the more spicy roll, other than a bland one. Golden spoon knows what they are doing and they are doing it right. The rolls are very good and priced perfectly.

From the Chicken items, the kung pao chicken is not something you want to miss.

Located in a corner of park street, the establishment has got very nice ambiance but it is but cozy especially in the upstairs... I ordered oriental, which tasted fantastic.. And over the top one cannot imagine having such a great oriental flavor in this price tag in the heart of the town... But the service was bit slow... But that doesn't matter much if the food is such...
Hoping to visit again and try some Indian flavor

This is a tiny restaurant in park street. Me and a few of my friends decided to go to the cemetery and while coming back we were very hungry and decided to drop by. 
The restaurant is very small and is frequented by office workers working nearby so it was crowded but we got seat.
We opted for Chinese as people praised it's Chinese food but the food too was a let down
The only reason I didn't like this restaurant because the food was served so late.
Chicken 65 - soft chicken with a sour sauce which had some spices which gave it a certain indian spices but it was the only dish that was nice.
Crispy chicken - supposed to be a starter but it was served at the end of the meal and it tasted awful.
Chicken In schezwan sauce - ordinary chicken as u get in every other restaurant serving chinese and the pieces were extremely small.
Chicken Manchurian - same as the above only this was a little hot and the gravy was blackish.
Chicken Hakka chowmin - this was really disappointing the chowmin was very plain and with maybe 5-6 bits of chicken just like the chowmin u get in stations.
Fresh lime soda - the usual stuff but it was also full of lemon seeds which was very odd. I mean they should at least have the courtesy to not put lemon seeds in the drink.
Total an awful experience. Maybe won't visit again

One of the most pocket friendly joints in park street. Heard a lot about this place. As I was in park street,hopped in for lunch post exams. We ordered veg gravy noodles with konjee Krispy chicken. The starter was really tasty. Not too spicy..right amount of spices. The noodles was however a bit bland in taste..had far better gravy noodles in other restaurants. However definitely recommended if one is in park street nd low on cash. Quantity of starter was perfect. A plate of noodles was sufficient for two. Would try other  dishes in future.

I absolutely heart this place. Whenever I'm in park street and am low in cash, this is the place I hop in.

Location: Just beside Peter Cat and right opposite to the park street kfc.

It has two floors, I personally prefer the first floor. Decor is nice.

Food is soo darn awesome. I love just loooove their chicken 65, long strips of chicken in tangy sauce with curry leaves and bell peppers.
Other fave dishes include kung pao chicken, drums of heaven, chili prawn, schezuwan rice and their kebabs
And the best part is the price. Price to taste ratio is amazing.
Sadly I have no pictures.

P.S.- their soups are not that great(if u r like me who can't stand raw egg smell)

Service is satisfactory.
Ambience - not so magnetic. 
One reason why I'd visit here is the variety on their menu card. An easy spot to check in at lunch break.
P.S.: The card payment option is often encountered with "network nahi hai sir".

Located opposite KFC or MYX in Park Street

Its a pocket friendly eatery and serves basic chinese or Indian cuisine,

The interiors are very basic but well maintained and clean.

Food delivered is hygienic and more or less in proper quantities.

Indian food is better compared to the others.

Quick and efficient service is present.

Pocket pinch is fair and one can always hop in a for a nice evening snack.

Golden spoon is a small restaurant with decent food. It is located in Park Street which is quite famous for its posh restaurants. Golden spoon is in quite contrast to the others, not necessarily in a good way. For one, the place is very small and congested. The hygiene factor is okay, but definitely has a lot of scope for improvement. However the food is not in that bad a state! I have had the following dishes -
Chicken Momos - The momos here are quite nice. I have certainly had better momos, but that would be in Darjeeling. In Kolkata, I certainly think that in terms of taste, it's one of nice few!
Chilli Chicken - Quite a nice dish. It's just at the same level as what you'd expect at other decent restaurants. So, in simple words, tasty but not memorable.
Red Pepper Chicken - this dish is quite different from other dishes I've had. Obviously the first time I've had red pepper chicken (anywhere for the fact!) and so the flavour was kind of new but in a good way. Though it's oily, which may put off some people.
Mixed Fried Rice - Another average dish which was in no way anything new from what you've already had.
So to sum it up, all the dishes were quite average but tasty nonetheless. The reason I give it a 3.5 and not 3 is because the prices are cheap and well the momos were well above average! It is a nice place to try for once. You may or may not like it but I can guarantee you won't be too disappointed because you don't have to spend a lot! It's a good meal at a decent price! I would certainly be going sometime soon!
Their home delivery service is also fairly good. I was quite delighted by their sturdy packaging and well the food was piping hot! What else does one really need?

Rating-

Food: 2/2.5

Présentation: 0.2/0.5

Finding new places to have lunch during office hours near my office is now becoming a task. So i decided to give this place a try. Located in park street next to peter cat and opposite kfc this place serves up indian and chinese as well as rolls. We decided to climb up the narrow stairs leading to the mezzanine floor where around 8 tables were laid out to accommodate guests.

We sat and ordered for the veg hong kong style chowmein and dry chilly chicken and a bottle of pepsi. The noodles were well prepared and was spicy just as i like it and the chilli chicken was about average. Probably the chicken wasnt cooked to the optimum level to make the meat tender. The flavour though was good. We had our lunch and the bill was 320 for 2 people which i feel is pretty decent.

Nothing much to write about the ambiance and the staff was hospitable and service was prompt. I would like to visit again and try their indian food.

Visited this place with friends last week.  We ordered kebabs, butter tandoori, naan , murgh makhani,  and chicken bharta.  Even though the chicken bharta and murgh makhani are two different dishes,  they tasted the same. The rotis were good.  The fresh lime soda, we have ordered, tasted funny. The price is low, but can't say that the food is very good.  The service is so slow, that at one point we thought that they are cooking the bill before giving it to us. Visit this place only if you are on a tight budget.

It's a small set up bang opposite to the park street KFC. They have their sitting area in the 1st floor, ground floor is mainly for rolls and take away. I visited the place twice and really liked their food. Pretty pocket friendly in terms of the location. We had the dry chilly chicken with mixed noodles & on the other time we had mixed fried rice with sczhwan chicken. The quantity was good enough;. One plate is sufficient for 2 person (though varies from person to person). The waiters are also prompt and service was up to the mark. If you are looking for a budgeted place with quantity & quality, it's a must visit.

I had my first roll picked up from this place quite a few years ago and I must say that I became fond of them so much so that any roll from any other place had to meet the standards of those served by Golden Spoon to satiate my taste buds.

My favourite is the Paneer Cheese Roll and its awesome. One must taste it to believe. Even a Cheese Fondue is not so cheesy as this roll.

They serve best rolls of Kolkata indeed!!!!

It is I guess one of the cheapest reataurants in the entire Park Street area.
The place is not too big. There are two storeys ; ground floor is mainly for the kitchen and 2/3 tables.
I have had their Crispy babycorn. The wuantity is good and if tastes really good. I also had their chicken hakka noodles and one plae is sufficient for two people. Next; I also tried their Kung pao chicken and Chicken in hot garkic sauce. This is where I was disappointed. The chicken didng seem fresh. The preparations too were quite basic.

All in all; it is a good place for a meal when you dont want to spend a lot.
Only if their chicken side dishes were a bit better.

Awesome chelo kababs, good kulchas and cheese nun, nice masala papads, fine cold coffee.

This is a relatively new restaurant to have come up at the Park Street area. Situated just opposite to the Myx and KFC outlets this small yet cosy place packs quite a punch. Seating is comfortable...ceiling height is a bit less and could do with an increase. Coming to the food...the quality is decent enough, taste is good and pricing is unbeleivably reasonable. It has surely got to be the cheapest restaurant in its locality..and the reasonable prices do not compromise with food quality at all. Overally a good place to be at for having delicious chinese food at extremely pocket friendly prices!

Affordable, reasonably moderately priced chinese restaurant in park street area. Located just opposite kfc and beside peter cat. Good variety in the menu. Good in quality and quantity. We had a chicken65 starter , veg fried rice and kung pao chicken in the main course. Both were well cooked and good in taste. The chicken starter and the side dish had good amount of vegetables and chicken. Though both had slender shredded pieces they were far better than our conventional starters and side dish. Different in taste than that of chicken lollipop or drumsticks. Kind of a sour chilli taste. The side dish on the other hand had a spicy aromatic taste. This came within a bill of 450. All in all quite a good change from the conventional. While you are at it, please do try out their fish coriander.

This is a pretty good restaurant in Park Street..the only downside is its size with only around 8 tables..bt who cares for that when the food is great & prices are cheap! We had mixed chopsuey & kung pao chicken..both were awesome but the 2 dishes did not go well with each other.. Chopsuey would taste best without any side dish.Service was also decent.. Ambience is nothing great..& best thing is they dont take taxes :D

Would you believe me if I said this place serves u food at such a price at such a place(park street)  that your pocket will hardly cry out loud?   Yes it's true. Best place to have a sumptuous meal if you're running low of cash. And good quality food too. Both the cuisines are equally tasty. So don't wait anymore. Try this hidden gem out asap. 
Pros: 1.the price definitely.
2.Good quality food. Main course quantity pretty average. Side dish quantity GOOD. 
3.Conveniently located(besides Peter cat, opposite KFC) 
4. VAT inclusive menu.
Cons:1. very very small place. Hardly can accommodate 40 people. 
2.no bathroom folks.

By far my best Chinese experience on Park Street. The appetizers are so delicious, once me and my gang decided to settle the dinner with appetizers only. The Pan fried Chilly Fish and the Konjee Crispy Chicken are absolute delights. However, the Mughlai/Indian cuisine is not so much...Pulao-Biryani "chalta hai".... The Kadhai Chicken could have been spicier. Shame, they dont serve alcohol with those mouth watering starters. Anyways, definitely the place to hit on Park Street when you are low on budget. Cheerio.

Located at Park Street, right beside Peter Cat, Golden Spoon is a small restaurant comprising of 7-8 tables and it is one of the best restaurants of Park st,if you're low on budget and you want to have some delicious North Indian Food or authentic Chinese food. Their Chicken Biriyani is delicious, the chicken is well cooked,juicy and the rice is thin, long grained, and the Biriyani is a treat to the taste buds. Chicken Bharta with their Cheese Naan proved out to be a superb combination and so did the combination of flavourful Chicken Fried Rice and some fiery red Hot Garlic Chicken, with a robust flavour of garlic.The staffs are extremely courteous and the service is fast as well.

Being a student of St. Xavier's, Kolkata this has become my regular lunch spot as this is the best possible option which is nearest to my college.Because which college student doesn't want lip smacking food at such prices?  ;)

Thumps up for this place. :"D

I was here yesterday for lunch with my friends as one of my friend suggestes this place which has good Chinese menu and is reasonably priced. The place is tiny and the ambience is simple , we went upstairs and took our place . Mirrors everywhere which made the look pretty. We were so hungry because of our long walk from park circus to the said place, therefore, we quickly orderes konjee crispy chicken as starter . It was amazing , shredded chicken perfectly made with correct spices and sauce. Next for the main course we opted for chicken hakka noodles , schezwan fried rice and chicken in hot garlic sauce. The side dish was good and noodles was okay ( i had better) , but the rice was uncooked with vegetables which was just steamed and not fried with less salt and nothing tasted like schezwan which was a big disappointment . Anyways the chicken dishes were comparatively quite well so if i visit again i would definitely have the konjee crispy chicken .

It was expected to be a good dinner with the family but i shall say i was a bit dissappointed. Firstly, we ordered starters and we didn't even get to complete it, our dinner was there. I won't say it was fast service because our  server was in a hurry for god knows what. The food was okayish and i liked the quantity. Other than that just a okay experience with Golden Spoon. The restaurant needs to work on the workers behaviour.

Located right next to Peter Cat almost, this is a small Chinese and Indian food joint. 
It's very small and not more than 35-40 people can eat here. There's no great ambience as such but it's nice for a family dinner or quick bites.

We were two and ordered Pan Fried Chilly Fish, Hong Kong Chicken Chowmien and Garlic Chicken. They took some time to take our order but they served it pretty fast.
The fish wqs crispy and well flavoured, the noodles was well made and the garlic chicken was also well seasoned and flavoured.

Quantity was good enough for the both of us and the bill we paid is 490. So it's relatively cheap considering what we had and the quality. 

Therefore, I won't definitely suggest it for a good and relatively cheap meal.

Finally visited this place for which I was planning for so long. The place being small and so are the rates compared to the restaurants nearby. The food quantity as well as the quality is average but a bit extra oily. Tried chicken 65 for starters and butter chicken tikka masala for final lunch. Both tastes nice specially chicken 65.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Second experience (Take away)
Ordered veg hakka noodles, fish in garlic sauce and egg roll. Quality was good, noodles were a bit tasteless, the sauce given with it made it spicy. Fish in garlic sauce was great, and the egg roll was too big. Overall, same rating for today as well.

I don't understand how this place got 3.6 on Zomato when the food quality as well as quantity is pretty much below average. Though it's cheaper than other restaurants in the area, it's food is way worse. Made a mistake of ordering chicken noodle soup, it was pathetic. And the mixed fried rice and the chicken reshmi butter masala were just average in taste but below average in quantity. Don't waste your money on this place.

Situated just opposite KFC, this is a rather small joint, what it lacks in prompt service it more than makes up for in the quantity and quality of the dishes served,ideal place for casual dinning or to chill with buddies after bunking college. A hearty meal for two costs within rs 500, we opted for Chinese cuisine and the food was mouthwatering..will surely be visiting it soon.

Visited Golden spoon as it seemed worthy from the reviews. Firstly had to wait for a long time for a simple order for 3 people and during a time when there were hardly any other customer. Confusions among waiters regarding the dishes ordered. Very less spacious, table for 4 are not at all comfortable. All the pain blew off when the food came in. Delicious food. Undoubtedly a place where u can get quality and quantity at an affordable price.

The 2nd visit!
The waiters are rude other than that the food is good enough, we had chicken hot and sour soup which had no traces of chicken though and naan with chicken tikka butter masala which was yummy!

3rd visit!
Tried their chello kebebs. The quantity is enough for a person and it tastes good too! ✌

This review have been long due as I visit this place often. The USP of this place is that it's cheap and serves good Chinese food ...however, it is a rather small restaurant. Considering its location, which is just opposite the Park Street just a few buildings ahead of Peter Cat towards Loreto College, you get a two course meal for two within 500rs ( take into account that me and my friend are big time foodies and love to gobble on huge quantities at a time :p)
Coming to the taste - 
Chicken Noodle Soup: hits the right note :D
Dry chilli chicken: chicken is fresh and soft and all the things you expect out of a dry chilli chicken.
Pan fried Chicken: This is the best side dish I had here. It has a tangy , sweet and hot and salty flavour added to it and if you  love spicy... U won't be disappointed.
Fried rice, try any of the varieties and you won't be disappointed. 
However try and avoid ordering the chicken sandwich here, unless you are on hurry to lose weight ( dearth of cheese or mayonnaise in a chicken sandwich is a serious mood killer).
I also did not like the American Chopsuey they serve here. Your taste buds become numb after a while.
Finally, to end in a good note, you will have a good experience if you know what to order. However, this place has got potential and would like to see it flourish in the years to come (and get a bigger space please)

A perfect place for students if you are looking for cheap food but the taste is drastically compromised. The biriyani is tasteless such that we had to add to salt and all it became was salty rice with hard mutton. 
The chicken butter masala was comparatively better paired with butter naan.
Whats is utterly disappointing about this place is the service. People forget to place orders with the kitchen and a basic order of one plate of biriyani comes after 25 minutes.

This restaurant is right opposite to KFC and is very easy to locate. The decor is minimal and has nothing unique to specify. Moreover this restaurant is not much spacious. Manager was indeed polite and arranged us a table for 10 people. The waiters were decent too. We started with the starters and ordered their pan fried chilly chicken, chicken 65 and crispy chilly babycorn. The quantity and quality was good. From their main course we ordered their mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noddles and kung pao chicken, chicken in hot garlic sauce and chilly chicken. Chicken in hot garlic sauce was the best according to me. The food they served was really tasty and mouthwatering. From their beverages we ordered fresh lime soda, lassi and cold drink. Overall we all had a huge appetite last night.

I visited this place few months back, according to me they provide decent food; wisely priced and decent quantity. They basically offer a decent menu range, but I didn't find anything special about their décor. And the covers were arranged in a clumsy manner, but that might be because of shortage of space on park street. This joint is joint located beside peter cat. Students will be delighted to visit as this place somewhat do justice to their pocket. Earned another visit for budget friendliness.

Located right opposite Myx and KFC park street this little joint packs a punch.

Decor and Seatings are basic and not very spacious but they do make it up with their service and food.

Service wise they are apt and fast and communicative.

We went for Chicken Mushroom soup, Chilli prawn and Chicken 65 along with soft drinks and sweet lime soda.

Quantity wise the amount is sufficient.

The soup was really nice,thick topped with ample amount of chicken shreds and mushroom did delight the taste buds.

Chilli prawn was bigtime delicious tangy with a tad bit spicy with the prawn cooked rightly that one could dig into them with utter joy.
Chicken 65 was ok,I think they added a bit too much soya but somewhat wasn't bad on the palate and the chicken was cooked well otherwise.

This is one place you should visit if you are on the go also its easy on the pocket.
I also recommend their rolls which are real delicious along with their north indian mughlai dishes.

The bill came upto 580INR  (inclusive taxes)

The restaurant is located just beside the famous Peter cat and opposite to the Park Street KFC. At first we were a little perplexed of whether to choose this restaurant as our lunch destination or not since there were ample of famous food joints nearby. Anyway, we moved in with a zeal to explore something new. The restaurant is upstairs. The place does not provide a big seating space. But the hospitality made by the waiter was too good to mention. He was single handedly managing all the tables with utter perfection. The restaurant has a large menu to offer. We ordered the Chicken Sweet corn soup and it tasted awesome. We wanted to try something Indian for the main course. We ordered Butter Tandoori Rotis and a plate of Chicken kebab Masala. Every item was budget friendly. And the quantity is sufficient. Moreover they do not charge any extra taxes. 
Would love to visit the place again.

For the taller ones mind your heads because the ceiling is low. Mind the stairs too, its a bit crammed of space. Leaving aside this cons the food and restaurant is a worth place to dine out casually.

Went here twice. Just near Peter Cat. Small cozy place. Filled with mirrors to make the place feel bigger. Tables are places too close so avoid if you are looking forward to some cosy dinner or lunch with some chatting. The food is great. The butter chicken, mixed fried rice and the mutton roganjosh(in the picture) all tasted awesome. The service was quick and prompt. They include potato in their biriyani and a huge boneless mutton piece in my biriyani. That was awesome! 
Visit for good food and soft comfortable sofa chairs. Avoid for seating arrangements and ambiance

Beside Peter Cat. We initially thought of going to Peter cat but due to its heavy rush at that point of time around 10pm, we opted to golden spoon which was nearby to it. We only need a little amount of food but ended up eating a lot. Well impressed with the wide varieties of food they offered. Ambiance is good for a less numbering. As a major Takeaway restaurant its more than enough. Service is good and fast. If you are in need of rolls, this is the best place to check in. Chinese Hakka noodles and fired rice are also Delicious. Prices are very reasonable for the quantity they offer. But if it is already crowded, it would be problematic.

Located in a place where everyone can find it, beside PeterCat and opposite to Myx. I gave 4.5 for the large quantity and pocket friendly dishes. Me and my friend went there and wanted to have momo . But we order red pepper chicken and chicken momo. Both were in ahold amount and yummiest taste. It may be a little more oily but it tastes good. I didn't go there to eat healthy but the typical Kolkata Chinese food.I was fully satisfied. We were full to my surprise. It's a small place but that's ok for a small group and enjoy the food. U can't get sofistication here.I would recommend to try this place once. Mostly students and working people visit here .

Location: Park Street. Beside Peter Cat. Opposite Myx.

Ambience: It's got both Dine-in and takeaway. Super untidy place. Only 1 personnel who takes orders, serves, cleans up. A sure thumbs down. The crowd is mainly the working class who come for lunch. Good crowd but read on...


FOOD: I really don't know if was my bad day or they serve this quality of Veg food. Super pathetic food. Had ordered vegetables in hot garlic sauce and Veg Fried Rice. 

The RICE was uncooked, hence hard. No salt. Tasted flat . 

Vegetables in hot garlic sauce was comparatively better than the Rice but better than the worst doesn't make it good either. Lacked that spicy taste. Too much of mushrooms. Not worth it.

Do not be deceived by the else fancy exteriors. HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED for vegetarians. Nothing good about the place.

We had a Lunch here. We started with Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, which was good. Then we ordered Non veg Chello Kabab which was served near about 45 mins later and good in taste but nothing to tell about as the Kabab was quite a bit stiff in nature. Though overall experience was nice and the food served, was enough quantified.

A small place where one can relish lots of good food without worrying about the bill. This mirror themed restaurant has a quick and polite service. The Hakka noodles we ordered tasted better than most other restaurants.

The seating arrangements are cramped which makes conversing difficult. We could practically hear everything the two women were discussing from the other table.
We ordered Mixed Fried rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles at 140/- , Kung Pao Chicken at 160/-, Mutton Biriyani at 180/- and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. All the dishes were perfectly made and executed. The flavours were intact and there was no lack of chicken anywhere. The Kung Pao Chicken tasted sweet and sour at the same time. It goes well with Hakka noodles. The mutton piece given with Biriyani was satisfactory. The Butter Masala's gravy was made to perfection.

This restaurant is popular because of its quality, but it's not yet famous due to lack of space.

EDIT: We again visited the good place. We ordered plain nan and Mutton Roganjosh. The Mutton dish was very tasty but too oily. It didn't seem different than a plain Mutton Kosha.

This place is situated just beside Peter Cat on Park Street and is not that tough to locate. Kind of cramped up for space, it can seat 30 people at max. The interiors are nice though with proper air conditioning and decor. 
We ordered chicken fried rice, garlic chicken, red pepper chicken, sweet and sour chicken, pan fried fish and crispy chicken (yes, LOT of chicken lovers there!).
The fried rice was good, but we had asked for 7 plates worth of it, and there was some inconsistency regarding the quantities we got. 
Garlic chicken- not good. Have had much better.The sweet and sour chicken and the pan fried fish were nice.
The crispy chicken was really good.
But the star of the show was undoubtedly the red pepper fried chicken. So good that we had to go in for a second order of the same.
Service is good. 
Prices are decent enough. A nice place for birthday treats in the area (IYKWIM).
Have heard the rolls here are decent too. Couldn't try them out today. Am definitely willing to come back again.
Would I recommend? Well, if you're on a budget and you're visiting Park Street (which is rarely the case), a definite YES.

Went to this place recently for lunch. The best thing about the place is the price range. Among all the restaurants in Park Street, I think this place serves the best food in this price range. The place is a bit small so we had to wait for sometime to get seats since we were a large group. We ordered a number of items including veg fried rice( 2 plates were enough for 3 of us) ,butter nan, chicken kebabs, mutton dopiaza etc. The service was good..we got the food within 15-20 mins of placing the order. The food was very tasty especially the kung pao chicken and chicken reshmi butter masala. Definitely try those if you are visiting the place for the 1st time. :D

The quality of the food is good. The best part is, it is one of the cheapest restaurants in Park Street. The place is too small well that doesn't matter anyway.

Heard a lot of praises about this joint from several people over the last couple of years.Discovered the reason last Saturday over lunch. The place was full and we had to wait outside for sometime. Th seating area on the first(mezzanine would be more appropriate i say) floor is quite tiny and can barely cater to 30 people max. The menu is pretty exhaustive and had both Indian and Indianised Chinese dishes. Ordered chilly mushroom dry for starter.In the main course ordered chicken tikka masala and butter naan.All the dishes were extremely tasty and well-prepared.The star item was the naan no doubt.It was extremely soft,fluffy and tender.Comparable to Amber i dare say. People who know their food in Kolkata will surely vouch for the fact that the naan at Amber is the benchmark. Prices are pocket friendly, no wonder students in the vicinity flock to this joint in droves. Quantity of side-dishes is slightly inadequate and will not serve the needs of 2 reasonably hungry eaters.Service is polite and attentive.A hidden gem in Park Street which holds its own in the maze of big heritage names.

Super Kolkata style rolls! Functioning both as a takeaway and dine in place, this small eatery opposite KFC is a gem! My friend and I swear by this place. Have tried the chicken & egg roll,  the double egg roll and more. The meat is flavourful, while the base can be made crispy or soft as per your need. And quite filling too.

This is a great budget restaurant right up the costly alleys of park street. It is good for a quick working lunch, students and shoppers who want tasty food in an air conditioned place without burning a hole in the pocket. We tried the Konjee Crispy Chicken and the Crispy Chilli Babycorn. I will rate both dishes 4.5/5. The seating arrangement though a bit cluttered, is comfortable. And do try their rolls. They are awesome!

Golden Spoon is a restaurant at Park Street area where you will find food with very affordable and reasonable price. Chiken tikka butter masala and tandoori roti were on our plates and the chicken dish was tasty but the roti was a bit oily. The restaurant is not so spacious and a part of the restaurant is not air conditioned. Besides these disadvantages, you may give it a try since it is very pocket friendly.

Today i went to Golden Spoon..This restaurant is located opposite KFC and it is near Peter Cat Restaurant..

This restaurant has limited capacity of seatings but it is ok,the service of waiter is slow,I've to wait around 15 mins for my order.. The interior of this hotel is just average..

The speciality of this restaurant is that it serves overload food,I've order chicken hakka and they given me a lot...

Well u can try here all kind of hakkas,rolls,starters,biryani,kebabs etc etc..

This restaurant will remain underrated because there are lots of grand restaurants  in park street but if u are a hangout lover and a true foodie,u can come and check out this place.. Moreover, it is also a pocket friendly restaurant... !!!!!

After a hard days worked,I was trying to find "One Step Up",when I hit this one.

This one is an extremely small restaurant just beside Peter Cat.It can seat about 32 people at a time.The interiors are nicely done.

The menu card had the choice of chinese and indian.Seeing most people ordering Indian,I decided to go for it.The waiter was not present.After a few minutes when he came to serve another table,that he took my order.No glass of water was provided.I had to ask for it twice to get it.

I ordered Chicken Biriyani with egg and mutton kasa(on the recommendation of the waiter).
The chicken Biriyani was piping hot.It tasted very good.The chicken was tender.However,the waiter had forgotten that I had ordered chicken biriyani and he fetched the egg later.The quantity was enough for a person.

The mutton kasa tasted good,but the quantity was little too less.It had two medium small pieces of mutton.The quality of the dish was very good.The mutton pieces were tender.

No VAT or other taxes are mentioned on the bill.
These two items costed me below Rs 300/-.
Happy Man.Satisfied tummy.Visit it for a filling time without spending a lot.
Recommended.

This pocket friendly place was discovered by my best buddy when we were in Higher Secondary School, and since then we have been visiting this place many a time.
I have a very sweet memory of meeting a traveller cum photographer friend from Ireland who came to this friend to have food.
The restaurant is a very small one with 5-6 tables in total, with very ordinary decoration. I find one single descent guy taking orders and serving food for the last 5yrs.Every item is very low priced, however they have not at all compromised with the quality. They don't serve alcohol, and may be one of the reason you dont have to wait in a long queue to have food on special occasions like New Year or Christmas,etc.
Love going to this place every time.

First of all they have a very less seating capacity. In the lunch hours the restaurant is full with the corporate employees. I had chicken biriyani. It was served cold. So i had to tell them to take it and serve a plate of hot biriyani. One of the staff came and took the plate of biriyani and came back after about half an hour with the same cold biriyani, in which i had to play tressure hunt to find the tiny peace of chicken. No egg but a big potato.  Very bad experience. I would never visit it again.

This place has been a favorite for us over a no of years. The food they prepare is delicious and wholesome. But we have found the waiters in Golden Spoon only cater to people who offer considerable tips. We were presented with fine behavior and treatment when we offered a good tip. But sometimes as students you can't afford to do that.Inspite of being a regular customer we were made to wait more than an hour for order and we had to repeatedly call them to take the order and give us water. Yesterday when we asked for a special Chinese dish and they said it was over . And while the waiter asked an immediate customer for coffee , for us in the afternoon there was no coffee. I just want to find out the owner of the restaurant and tell them that these people would even go to the extent of bill manipulation to earn tips. And they just lost some regular customers.

Just opposite to the KFC in Park Street,Golden Spoon is not that hard to spot out.Inside, it is pretty small and cozy with a handful of tables and small fans attached to the walls.If you walk in on a hot day,don't expect the air conditioning system to work as it is literally "dilapidated".After we took our table,the waiter served us with normal cold water ( thank God!).We ordered Konjee Crispy Chicken with Paranthas and Tandoori Roti,Chicken Biryani and Mixed Hakka Noodles.When the food arrived,the quantity of biryani with its distinctive weird taste disappointed me.And the noodles!! Horrifyingly too bland and sweet at the same time.The only thing that was upto the mark was the Konjee Crispy Chicken with its tangy flavour.But thankfully the bill perfectly complimented the food we had.So if you are looking for a good place to have any sort of Biryani and Noodles dishes in Park Street,I'd rather you scratch out the name of Golden Spoon off your list.

The very first thing about the Golden Spoon is that it is very cosy, humble place. However one must not be fooled by the absence of proper air conditioning and space at large, as it serves very good food at very affordable rates. The chicken tikka or the butter masala melts in one's palette if taken carefully wrapped inside a butterlicious tandoori roti. A gay place, even merrier for nimble pockets!

Finding a pocket friendly restaurant in Park Street is like finding a diamond in a coal mine. Golden Spoon is one of those diamonds unlike other restaurants in the area, where your wallet won't feel any lighter after leaving, and at the same time you get food of fantastic quality. It's a win win situation for everyone.

In an area like Park Street this place definitely stands out for the pocket friendly food it serves up. Popular for the rolls the place has a seating air conditioned seating upstairs with a wide variety of food offerings. The waiters were courteous and the service was quick and it was a good experience.

The food was to my delight and tastier than I was expecting the place to be. I Ordered chicken bharta , Dal tadka with Garlic naan.
It was better than my recent lunches and would recommend the place for a quick meal.

The place will not disappoint you with the quality of food and yummy dishes it serve.
Ambiance is good but not ideal if you are in for a royal date but the immaculate place for 2 people willing to spend 450 bucks.

Park Street was the place to chill and hang out during my growing up days in Kolkata. And this was a favorite haunt of us friends to have rolls over an "adda session" or when we were hungry and could not afford expensive meals, or a meal on the go... 

Their paneer roll is awesome, with extra onions and green chutney, its just lip smacking! Being a Veggie, i had limited options, but my friends have also sweared by their chicken rolls. 

A must try for all visiting Kolkata - this place is just a few feet away from the iconoic Peter Cat restaurant. And pls dont expect very healthy stuff - rolls are supposed to be had that way..

Thanks to zomato I came across this place. And trust me it's a pleasurable discovery for me. I love the food here. The interiors are conjusted and maybe suffocating. BUT the food is worth it all. Go there to have a good hearty meal within a low budget. I have been there twice, ordered veg pulao, egg tadka, chicken tikka masala and chowmein..it was yum. Breads are also really good like butter naan. Don't miss it! Next time ordered Chinese, like chilli chicken, fried rice and chowmein. Even that was nice. But mughlai is better.

This is a tiny place next opp kfc park street. It is truly a legendary place. I remember my father take me as a child and we would buy 1 plate of noodles and chicken. It would be enough as they serve in large quantities. They still do. I like this place. The prices will not coz a pocket pinch at all.

This is a take away place, which has a seating capacity. Simple as that. And staying true to that tradition that take aways give you more food than normal serving, they load you with a lot of food. I went here to grab a quick lunch. Veg Hakka noodles, chilly chicken and a glass of sweet lime soda was what I had. And it was filling and fulfilling. I could not understand the concept of lining the walls with mirrors though. Its as if everyone is looking at each other while they eat. Not appreciated though. Good food, cheap price. Go here for budget lunch/dinners! NOT a dating place, mind you.

A favourite with the Lh'ians when your budget is limited. Food is nice. Kebab roll is amazing. The only factor which needs to be improved is probably the seating arrangements which is a bit cramped.

May be this place is too small to be comfortable..may be there is only one person in this place who handles both taking orders and serving the food..may be you have to wait for a long while for the chinese items to come to your table, but the quality of the food will make u forget about all those cons of the said restaurant..situating beside the legendary food joint peter cat,this place may not be noticed at a 1st glance..but it is a perfect place for all the people who prefer a standard quality food at a low cost..lastly, i really wish to go there again..

Went in a rain drenched afternoon to this place on park strt ,located just opposite to the KFC, ahead of Peter cat.....to begin with the sitting area is quite small..the entire sitting place and all the customers were being managed by a single waiter who was taking orders..he wont take them down in writing and kept on forgetting..he came back after 10 mins to confirm orders again....and then finally when the food arrived it ws different from wt we ordered !!...we had ordered for hong kong chicken fried rice and wre served with  chowmein...i  am still giving them a 3 bcz:-
a) the other two items the chicken malai kabab, hot garlic chicken were quite good
b) dre was no Vat charged on food so thats a plus
c) hoping that we wnt on a rainy day ..so the poor service ws coincidence and nothing regular.
Overall ..wl visit again sometym bt not something to b added to my list of top food hubs..

Golden Spoon really surprised me....I used to pass it by on a regular basis but never paid much attention as thought it to be another typical restaurant serving Indian Chinese and north Indian cuisine. However one day I met a friend there and had a egg double mutton roll and that changed the way I thought about the place. Yes the place is abs cramped and for a tall guy like me it is a problem manoeuvering the stairs and then getting into the dining area but the food is all worth it. The waiters are very helpful and well behaved. Service is quick.
I had ordered a single egg double chicken roll and my friend ordered a plate of fish finger. The food was served very quickly and was piping hot. I had mentioned not to put any sauces in my roll and my instruction was followed. The roll looked very inviting. The paratha was properly fried and had that proper crust. The first bite and I knew I had reached food nirvana. The first bite had a crunchy sound of capsicum and onion with a bit of the flaky paratha. The next bite I had allnofnthos plus a portion of the meat....perfectly grilled chunk of mutton. It was divine ;) in no time I finished my mutton roll and ordered another one of the same thing ;)
Now coming to my friend's fish finger. We'll marinated fingers or fish and then properly crumbed and fried. Very fresh fish served with slices of onions and cucumbers.
since then I have been a regular and I intend staying that way ;)

When I was in college this place acted saviour for me. Whenever I was low on cash, I knew it's time to Go Golden to grab the spoon. Walking down the lane we friends would sweat like anything so the A/C here would be the coolness you require living in this city with humidity. Coming to the service, the service is good. You are attended and re-attended couple of times. The servers are very courteous and friendly. It's a never ending menu would confuse you for a while if you are not sure what exactly to order.

The food is good and it couldn't be more cheap at Park Street. Enjoy your meal !

You are at Park Street, you need a quick budget lunch, think no more and knock this restaurant, by Park Street' s standards this is simply cheap and good. There are a variety of food items to choose from and attendants are very well mannered and they DON'T possess a face that reflects ''know all types''. Items are priced reasonably and they taste good but not superb. I went to this restaurant last Sunday and had Chicken Hot & Sour soup which was not that good, this item got followed by Chicken Chilly and Mixed fried rice but the taste was a bit bland, now this experience was a sudden one as many a times I have been to this restaurant and on all those occasions the items really tasted excellent. Others platters like Fish Kebabs and Rolls are very tasty and they are a must have items for all food lovers, get into while bumming around Park St area.

Chilli mushrooms at Golden Spoon are to die for! Strategically located at Park Street, making it accessible for all. I'd say don't waste time reading the reviews.. Simply go and try a couple of your favourite dishes. N the best part is that you won't  even feel the pinch in your pocket. Well done guys@Golden Spoon for keeping up the good work for so many years! Cheers!

This place has been a survivor so many times for me when I am low on cash and when I am very hungry for quick, tasty and clean food to indulge in park street area , so when I come here I have a positive atmosphere to eat as there is a nice split
A/C blowing the exact coolness you want in this humidity so that's a plus point , then coming to the service of the restaurant is bang on as the servers are very curtious and helpful so choosing the food isn't a problem here as the menu has evrthn possible from north indian to chinese for a regular meal to indulge in with great tastes available right here .

My verdict - low in cash but want good food ? then don't worry just visit this place and you will repeat the visits then after .

Located well but needs improvement in food quality as well as in ambience.

The location beside Peter Cat has advantages. But I think the management doesn't know how to utilize it well. 

1. They do not have ample no. of waiters to serve the customers.

2. They don't have a great or rather have a so so ambience to attract customers.

3. The biggest problem is that they do not hav Card payment. I had to hunt for an ATM to pay them after I was full with food.

 Regarding food, the food is not great, its sort of ok types.

If they improve all of these along with the food quality, I think they can easily beat restaurants nearby with similar cuisines.
Most importantly all of the above cons can be considered as the food is just very cheap compared to other ones in that area.

This is one of my favourite place in park street. As it is near to my college, my friends and I usually go here for lunch. I have been here so many times and as I remember I had eaten here lunch and dinner on the same day.. Chicken butter masala, chicken reshmi butter masala, rolls are must to have. Chinese menu is not that good. Avoid Chinese. 
Eating here won't even pinch your pocket. Once I went with a group of 11, bill was just 1300.
Ambience and service is at par with other good restaurants.

With my little sleepy son in my arms, was looking for a place which could serve quick wholesome takeaway meal. Golden spoon served us flat in 10 mins. We ordered paneer rolls, chicken bharta and tandoori rotis. The rolls were sumptuous and quite big compared to the various rolls I have had across the city. Chicken bharta had almost ten chunky boneless pieces which is unheard of in a dish and the rotis were bigger than regular ones for mere 10 bucks. All in all a great value for money joint. Reasonably priced and good quantity! Glad to have found this :)

So, if u r harassed with unmsnagsble queue of Peter Cat.... U can easily slip into this option....

The staffs are well behaved... But i felt they are not adequate in numbers...
The 1st floor is quite a small place making too many tables accommodated forcefully...

But my overall experience is good....

The restaurant looks a lil shabby from outside . It's a tiny place,a lil congested actually. We had ordered chicken biryani and chicken reshmi butter masala.After 5mins,we were informed that chicken biryani wan not available and we had to change the order to mutton biryani.The biryani was okayish with juicy and succulent pieces of mutton.The butter masala was good.The prices are cheap but I would have to think twice before visiting this place again.

Located adjacent to Peter Cat , this small restaurant has gained quite a name for providing quality food at a reasonable price in a pocket pinching area like Parkstreet.  They expertise in rolls although the chinese food here is equally satisfying. The space for dining is a bit small and is definitely not a place for a bigger groups . The waiters are cordial and swift.  A meal for 2 costed me Rs. 440.

I visited park street to celebrate new year's in midnight with 3 other friends & we reached there just on time :3.. It was very crowded as expected & after fighting off the mega crowd we managed to reach the Peter Cat lane but to our dismay it had shut down by that time so then we saw "Golden Spoon" which was open & still serving at 12.30am. So we decided to have our dinner there & we were the last batch of customers to enter there :P.

So we had ordered:-
Chicken Tandoori full=Tender & well marinated(4/5)
Hot garlic chicken=Tasty(3.8/5)
Hong kong style chicken chow
Mixed chowmein
Chicken chowmein=was a bit dry to my liking but maybe it was due to whole day's rush(3/5)

Total bill came to around 1300 inc taxes.. It's an ok-ok place to dine out..

When it comes to food, I swear by Park street. And I never fail to hit and try new joints at Park st. So for a sudden weekday lunch I and a friend decided to hit this place situated at the Middleton row. This is a small joint. It would not be right to call it a restaurant. So, we walked the stairs and got seated ourselves upstairs beside a huge mirror. Now this place has a severe space crunch so it is not advisable for a big group. The staff was polite but I did not find them really guest concerned. We ordered chicken tandoori, malai kebab and chicken biriyani. Chicken tandoori was passable. Malai kebab could definitely have been better. Biriyani was not bad. They served decent proportions. This is a cheap place & you need not worry much about your pocket that is the best part of this place. I would suggest people not to expect really high quality food here but you can give this place a shot if you are running out of money and yearning to eat out.

This small cozy food joint is located beside the big name of Park Street:Peter Cat.. There were only 10 tables to accommodate due to lack of space.. We ordered for chicken hot n sour soup,konjee crispy chicken and chicken gravy noodles.. The stuffs were good and the food was delivered on time.. The soup and crispy chicken were mind blowing.. But I really didn't like their gravy noodles!! So we ordered for chicken hakka noodles and that was a satisfactory one!! Prices were absolutely pocket friendly.. Overall had a nice experience but the lack of space can be a bit problem for a large group to enjoy over there.

On a hungry evening this place struck as a place full of people who were coming out satisfied.
However I was with my grand parents and hence didn't choose to go upstairs and took their ground floor seats.
This place was congested and we had to ask them to switch on the AC.
When we ordered, the dishes took some time and the plates served had a hair on it.
The other plates were wet.
The dish we ordered were paneer chilli which smelled faintly of soap.
The dish was just finished when the waiter showed up with finger bowls , not giving us a chance to order anything else.
Also while billing they gave us the wrong bill.
The next time he had charged us extra on a dish due to misprint on the menu card.
Overall except for Roti's, nothing was tasty and it's not a recommended place to go.

I would have given a 4 if not for the space otherwise I think this joint is one of the cheapest in Park Street area and the food served here can compete if not better with the legendary joints in Park Street. The Chinese is simple and good . Though it lacks in variety and also the customer service can use some smile on their gloomy faces but its real friendly to your pocket and you don't have to compromise much for the taste as well.

Was here with my friends today..
The place is very small and accomodates just 5-6 seating arrangements..however this place has no such speciality..the veg food sucks..its really disgusting with blank taste..we managed just to take a bite or so and left it..
Perhaps,no doubt the non-vegetarian dishes were bang on..from pan fried chilli fish to chicken tikka kebab,these starters made our day..the Chinese cuisine were far more better than the indian dishes...among the veg in the main course we had ordered paneer butter masala and dal,makhni which tasted real bad..the friedrice and chicken in hot garlic sauce was delicious..the butter nan cooked to perfection along with chicken tikka butter masala..i prefer my foodie friends to try out the non veg dishes if you are heading to golden spoon..
A very average experience for me..

The Indian Food served over here is better than the Chinese cuisine they serve.

This is a pocket friendly restaurant in an area like Park Street.

Very good Mughlai. Never cared to try their Chinese and never will. Their naan, chicken butter masala and chicken tandoori were always the best for me, considering the price.

Good choice if you are short on cash or time. Good choice for students. The taste and price will make up for congested ambience.

Went there on new years eve. Service was excellent so was the food. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn for starters it was really tasty. Later on we had paneer tikka masala,dhania chicken,reshmi butter masala along wit tandoori roti and paratha. The roti was too crispy to be called a roti though but the taste of other stuff made our day. And so pocket friendly for us students. Will visit it soon!

As per the location is concerned in park street the food is extremely cheap. The quality and quantity is really good. I ordered Murgh Malai Kebab which was yummy. Biryani was good also. Mutton Roganjosh was okay but overall it was good. Ambience was also good. A good speedy service. They don't give finger bowl but I asked for it & they also did that. A good experience.

Food is average. A very small place. There were cockroaches on the table when we were served. Service is not upto the mark. The quantity of food is not satisfactory. The only posetive poist is that it is pocket friendly.

Golden Spoon, the famous rolls destination in park street. A childhood favourite. The resturant is like a bird's nest but they serve you wonderful chinese dishes. Two waiters and both are friendly. Though the location is parkstreet but for a pocket friendly treat to you girlfriend and to eat in peace hit the place!

It is the only possible cheap food that you can get in Park street. I have tried different kinds of rolls here. Their one roll suffices your hunger and tastes pretty good also. But they put too much of onions which i don't like.

Nice small place which many people are not aware of. If you dont want to stand in queue to have chelo kebab from Peter Cat for the 567th time and dont wnt to spend much either,this is the place to be in. Its few steps away from Peter cat just opposite to the KFC.The place is mainly for takeaway, however they do have a small sit-in on the first floor with mirrors all over.The chinese is good,price is cheap. Not really fond of their mughlai cuisines.

Okay place. Food is average, quantity too. Service is good. The ambience is okay, but seating space is very very cramped. Prices are reasonable. It's goable, if not anything more.

On my second visit, I ordered veg zhalfrezi, which was okayish, with butter naan. The starter was konjee crispy chicken which was absolutely delicious.

I was asked to definitely try the popular rolls in kolkata. Since i was apprehensive about try street food, i decided to try the rolls at Golden Spoon. They kitchen looked very clean and hygenic. I did a take away of a egg+veg roll. Was shocked that such a LARGE roll was just for 40 rupees. One bite into the roll and i was blown away. Was delicious- well cooked and wrapped and super delicious. I could barely finish half of if. Must try if in the area.

Too small of a place. Feels claustrophobic even if you aren't one this place will make you. The tables are just way too small. Food portions per plate is very less compared to the price being paid. Food quality is not a plus either. Probably the zomato reference this restaurant flashes off is paid. This place doesn't even have a washroom. Totally a no no for this place. All that glitters is not gold for this place.

Located just beside the Peter cat. It is a nice and simple restaurant. They serves Chinese as well as Indian cuisine with equally well prepared. We ordered murg malai kebab, peas pulao, chicken tikka butter masala and fresh lime soda. The chicken tikka butter masala was delicious and juicy as well as the malai kebab but the lime soda was not up to the mark. The prices are on the lower side comparing the other restaurants in this area. Overall a nice experience. Best wishes.

We ordered Chicken and Mutton Biriyanis with Chicken Chowmein (Gravy) along with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. I was a bit disappointed with the servicing. It was quite slow and the gravy of the Reshmi Chicken and the Tikka Chicken were the same, which it shouldn't be. Food taste was okay-ish.

Golden Spoon serves a mixed potpourri of Indian, Chinese and Mughlai. and it is safe to say that you can enjoy almost all the cuisines. The Chinese, albeit an Indian-ised version, is quite a tasty fare. but if you are a sucker for the biriyanis and the kebabs, the Mughlai dishes here taste quite decent too. the upside- you dont have to shell much for your gastronomical nirvana. price here is pretty affordable and food, tasty. they serve a fair portion too, so you wont go away hungry. If you are at Park Street and dont wanna dole out a lot on food, this tiny restaurant situated in Middleton Row can be your rescuer.

Went with one of the colleague. We were in Park Street area and we need to discuss something. We were hungry too. It was 12.00 noon and thus I have decided to go to this place. This is my first time.
You have to climb a stair case and you will find only two tables there. But if you look carefully, you’ll find that you have to pass through a little “gully” there and you will find a moderate size place to seat.
We were in hurry and we left it on the restaurant person to decide, what he wants us to have in Chinese cuisine.
He suggested Hongkong Chicken Fried Rice and Schezwan Chicken.
Food was good and that too very cheap.  Service was prompt and the behavior was very good.
I’d like to come again.

One of my favourite restaurant's in park street. I go there every time I am short of cash yet have cravings for good and quality food. I have been going there since the past four years now. The food quality is simply awesome. I've tried out most of the dishes. The noteworthy dishes are, chicken tikka butter masala, lollipop [ which is huge and the gravy is mouth-watering], babycorn, cheese chicken roll, mutton biryani, Kung pao chicken and a few others. Its a must for every Foodie out there :)

Whether crispy chilli babycorn or pan fried chicken, the menu appears to repetitive.  Nothing new to experiment. But u might as well give it a shot.

I haven't been here very recently, it may be a year ago, and I was not a Zomato user then . .
though I'm feeling so sorry for reviewing this place such late . .
because had an amazing experience here . .

No, this is not like a star rated one, or a very comfortable dine out place,
but the reason behind the Amazing experience is the ratio of Cost and Food quality..

Located in a Park Street area ( just beside Peter Cat ), it is really unbelievable to serve quality food in a very low cost according to the restaurants nearby..
The space is small, though they have decorated the place well and good..
( the con I've found is they don't have any washroom due to insufficient space )

The service is also fare enough..
And quality and quantity was good ( I only had Indian so cannot say about the Chinese ) .

Location: Park Street, diagonally opposite KFC. 

Had heard about this place a lot from my colleagues. 
Just got an opportunity for a quick bite so couldn't try anything from the cuisines. 
Just tasted two of the rolls from what they had to offer. 

- Cheese Paneer Roll 
Perfectly cooked paratha with succulent pieces of Paneer topped with onion, lemon juice, pinch of salt n' pepper, generous amount of cheese, chilli sauce and ketchup! 
Tasted great! 
But, a bit oily. 

- Cheese Onion Roll
Thick and crisp paratha with a generous filling of cheese, onion, freshly ground pepper, pinch of salt, chilli sauce and ketchup.
Yummilicious. 
Was slightly greasy.

Prices were pocket friendly. 
Quick service. 

A good experience on the basis of what I had. :-) 
Yet to try the dishes, would revisit soon. Comments due on that part.
Would update soon.

I have only had rolls from here. Chicken and Chicken Egg Rolls. I have not been impressed with them in the least bit. The parathas I find thick, while there is spice and sauce carelessly strewn inside the rolls. While I will not be able to dissect it, I found their rolls not up to the mark at all.

Much rather walk up to Kusum across on the other side of Park St and have their rolls. Vastly superior :)

This place is a must for everyone who enjoys a good Chinese meal... 
The eatery is on top of the roll shop and a bit cramped as well.. But the quality of good served more than makes up for it..
My staple - chilli chicken and HongKong noodles along with  veg Manchurian is a killer combination..

A good restaurant, serving good food at a reasonable price is all i have to say about this place. This is very near to my college and we often go there for a roll or a quick lunch. it is a small cosy restaurant serving good food. Service is good. I would recommend the Chinese rather than the North indian. The chinese is better. They renew their prices during christmas every year and hence are becoming more expensive by the day. Over all a nice place.

This restaurant made me realize why I signed up for Zomato.com in the first place. It was to find good quality, affordable, restaurants which provided a comfortable eating experience. All of which is provided by Golden Spoon in Middleton Row. For the ignorant, it's the road which turns right in front of Music World. Its one of the cheapest places to have a hearty meal in and around Park Street and later gush about it. A hit with the girls from nearby Loreto college, the place always has a few seats empty. The pedigree of the establishment is not grand, but its been around for decades and is still going great. Service is nice and wait time is minimum. No VAT was charged n our meal. Ambiance is nothing special but it has a cozy feel and therefore is an appropiate destination for a romantic yet non pocket crunching date.

The food is better than average. I only had the American Chopsuey and I found it to be delicious. The portion was quite satisfying and the visual appeal of the dish was also nice. The egg had a perfect soft yolk. The crispness of the fries complemented the smoothness of the broth. The spices were just right. The noodles were unbroken and soft.The chopped herbs were fresh and the overall effect was bang on. However I found it slightly disconcerting that it tasted exactly like it should, offering no uniqueness. 


Chakraborty Tip : Don't get too comfortable once you're in the generally empty upstairs. The cameras may look sloppy, but the wall mirrors make everything visible. Beware. :)

This is one of my favourite restaurants of school life in Kolkata. ’Golden Spoon’ in Park Street serves pretty nice food yet you will never feel any pocket pinch. I can say one of the cheapest restaurants in Park Street area. I went there with my two friend Soumitra Kumar Sahoo and Vidyasagar Das , ambiance is so-so, neat but not spacious enough. We are in the mood to have Indian dishes. So we ordered 3 ‘Veg Pulao’ (with extra butter), 1 ‘Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala’, 1 ‘Chicken Tikka Butter Masala’ and 3 ‘Fresh Lime Soda’. We loved it so much that we finished off everything within few minutes. One thing which will take me back there is their Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. It was heavenly, a must try for Butter Masala lovers! Finally the price was just right, for the location, and quality of food. Will definitely make another visit soon.

The egg had a perfect soft yolk. The crispness of the fries complemented the smoothness of the broth. The spices were just right. The noodles were unbroken and soft.The chopped herbs were fresh and the overall effect was bang on. However I found it slightly disconcerting that it tasted exactly like it should, offering no uniqueness. 


Chakraborty Tip : Don't get too comfortable once you're in the generally empty upstairs. The cameras may look sloppy, but the wall mirrors make everything visible. Beware. :)

This is one of my favourite restaurants of school life in Kolkata. ’Golden Spoon’ in Park Street serves pretty nice food yet you will never feel any pocket pinch. I can say one of the cheapest restaurants in Park Street area. I went there with my two friend Soumitra Kumar Sahoo and Vidyasagar Das , ambiance is so-so, neat but not spacious enough. We are in the mood to have Indian dishes. So we ordered 3 ‘Veg Pulao’ (with extra butter), 1 ‘Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala’, 1 ‘Chicken Tikka Butter Masala’ and 3 ‘Fresh Lime Soda’. We loved it so much that we finished off everything within few minutes. One thing which will take me back there is their Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. It was heavenly, a must try for Butter Masala lovers! Finally the price was just right, for the location, and quality of food. Will definitely make another visit soon.

well a very low price restaurant with cramped up seating arrangements.. laccha paratha was piece of Italian leather...it took me 1 hour to eat one paratha...the waiters respond to ur requests after half an hour..and sometimes piss u off..bad service under the excuse of cheap pricing is no excuse at all..still for college goers with friends for a low budget party at park street...this is the only option ..

cheap to say for a restaurant in such  a location. the food quality is ok. Avoid for sit-and -dine. the take-away food counter is better. Try mutton rolls....thats the specialty of this place.

I have been going to golden spoon for quite some time now.nearly 2years to be precise and have recommended it to many of my friends who are all faithful customers there now.i find the food to be really good.i have not yet tasted the rolls and sandwiches,but apart from those so far whatever i have had,was simply great keeping in mind that this place is way too economical.the chicken tikka butter masala and the kungpao chicken are absolutely amazing.so is the baby corn and drumsticks.

well a lot of my fellow foodies and connisoeurs have underated golden spoon but i can tell u still the chicken kebab masala and the briyani has kept to its standards over the last two decides every since golden spoon opened out on middleton row serving the students of the loreto house school and college. incidently i tasted the food when it was first opened way in 1990. thats some history for fellow foodies.

Golden spoon has no longer been  an egg roll centre only,they now serve indian dishs with some scoop from china also
it just lacks in ambience,n it is the bestplace to dine in in part street when you have a little money to spare

This restaurant is a bit cozy. The foods taste good, no no a bit better than good. They make best eggrolls in town. I had Double Chicken Egg Roll and you know what I had my lunch done. My partner is a poor eater she managed her eggroll after a li'l fight. The interior is not that good and not so clean. But in a area like Park St. if you want to have your lunch without burning a hole in your pocket you must visit golden spoon.

QSR quick service restaurant - in my lingo 
Been going there for a long time. Student takers. Rolls. Ask them to make it less Greasy and they will laugh. Nonetheless rolls are good and very filling. Footfall is good. You get to see the kitchen. 

Eat in isn't fancy rather it's down at the heels. Service is slow but I never complained. Food used to be dam cheap but economic pressure for survival; surely it had to go up. Few hundred bucks and you wont stay hungry. 

You have choices now - KFC, MacD etc. But if you are out round that area during lunch and a want a quick bite, go ahead and try; won't kill ya :) you will save a few pretty penny ...

Even though I am from Presidency and Golden Spoon is pretty far away, we frinds always made sure we had our birthday treats from This particular joint. The place has been renovated of late but when we visited it was not well in shape. But the food,, oh god, mashallah what taste and what quantity. I love everything about this place, the cosy and warm feeling, the service of the waiters especially a short  bhaiya ji who has a pretty smile on his face no matter what. The reshmi butter masala or the shahi tandoori, I mean the food is cheap and easy for pockets as well fit for your stomach. One should also try out their kaati rolls which are mouthwatering and one queer thing about this place is their quality which has improved with time. I hope it grows and more people come here to satisfy their tummy !

I decided to go to Golden Spoon on the insistence of my wide who remembers their rolls from about 10 years ago. First off. The place is in my definition, cramped. Kolkatans might call it cozy. Thankfully there was no one else sitting on the table next to our or else it might have seemed like they were sitting with us. I ordered a double mutton double egg roll while she ordered a double egg chicken roll. There was some confusion when the rolls arrived since hers was bigger than mine. Anyway, we proceeded to eat. The mutton seemed slightly underdone. My wife though was highly disappointed. Her roll had chicken that did not seem fried/roasted/cooked. I'm definitely not going back there. As for the service, I have come to realize that the average Kolkatan does not mind bad service (based on the reviews below). The menu took literally 5-6 minute to arrive at our table. The table napkins were some fibre kind that seemed more like those you can use to wipe a glass rather than your hands. No absorption capabilities whatsoever. I have had rolls elsewhere (in other cities) and all I can say is Kolkata needs to recalibrate their standards of "Amazing".

This small little eatery with 2 levels, serves the most amazing kathi rolls I have ever tasted.
 And mind you I rate them over Nizam's any day. Nizam is highly over rated to say the least. They have the 3-4 basic rolls:
Veg Roll - with lovely masala aloo bhaji, stuffed with onions, capsicum, radish sometimes, their particular chutney. 
Veg Roll with Egg - The same with Egg paratha.
Egg Roll - Double egg with the mish mash of salad & chutney. 
Chicken Tikka Roll - which practically oozes out with chunky pieces of chicken.
Chicken Egg Roll - This is practically enough as a full fledged lunch/dinner by itself.
Mutton Roll & Mutton Egg Roll.
For all of this you have to take a token & stand outside near the cubby hole from where your order is shouted out & given.
The inside is AC & serves besides the indian/chinese dishes; some great sandwiches, nimbu paani.
All in all a place that is just ideal for the school down the corner, love birds wishing to spend time & anyone else who is tired of the gamut of so called specialty restaurants on Park Street
