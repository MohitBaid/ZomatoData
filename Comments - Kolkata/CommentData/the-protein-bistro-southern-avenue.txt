Visited around 1 pm. Ambience OK. Small cafe serving palatable healthy food. Had non veg platter good quantity and quality. Salsa chicken wrap- delicious. Supposed to serve salsa and sour cream only served salsa. When i mentioned it they initially denied then said it was not available. Points deducted for that. Desserts or almond protein shake were unavailable. Grilled chicken with pasta, sauted shrimp were delicious as was the detox juice. What irked me that they denied when some part of food items were unavailable. Did not give anything extra or discount for it. Quantity of food items good enough for two people. Quality, taste also mostly good. Calories and protein mentioned for most items in menu and most of them were packed with protein( meat content ) true to the name of the place. I did not like the grilled fish part of non veg platter. Quinoa and pork items were not available.

Ordered for a Scrambled Egg with Spinach and Feta Cheese Wrap along with a health drink. They served a wrap with eggs and cheddar cheese and no spinach. When I pointed this out, they said sorry they do not have feta cheese and spinach. When I asked them why they took the order, the reply was sorry and the dish would be complimentary. After the meal when they gave me the bill, I saw they had charged the full amount for the wrap. When I told them they had not served me the wrap with missing ingredients and they had promised it was complimentary, they said bill is already generated and they could not do anything. When I refused to pay the full amount and demanded at least a discount, they said discount was not possible in their computer system. When I was adamant that without at least a discount I wouldn't pay, they magically generated a bill with a discount of Rs 39! I paid the amount and walked out. Very bad experience!

Visited here for lunch. Food was ok, at its price range. ordered for a grilled chx burger, was served in 10 mins. It was nothing that special, except chicken had good flavor of the marinade, probably oyster/barbeque sauce, served with a bowl of ketchup. The burger was layered as a standard of lettuce, cucumber,tomatoes and sliced onion topped with mayo.

Ambience is pleasant, specially if you want to laze around or spend time reading books, this is a good place to be. I  rate the restaurant as ok, with 3 points considering the overall experience.

Healthy options for a complete foodie is always a delight. This corner joint with nicely lit ambience serves the best protein packed meals in the city. Ordered Dinner Meal there. Taste was awesome. Enough for sharing. The most important part of the menu was the nutrition parameters of each dish. Interiors was decent ,service was prompt.However broken seats took the fun part away.

Visited this place quite a few times now. I love the cozy ambience of this place. Perfect for a chill out and gossip session. This cafe serves health food, as such the menu has been quite interestingly made which actually shows you the breakdown of calorie intake and all such details. I love the yogurt shakes and bacon and chicken items out here. Desserts are healthy yet mouth-watering. Space crunch is a problem of the cafe. Service can be made faster, and more trained staff is expected in such a cafe!

Date of Visit – 02/08/2017

Location – It is located in Lake terrace area near vivekanand park just opposite Karma Fitness.

Ambience - It is a small around 16 seater place. Seating arrangement are comfortable. Also have some health related books to read.

Service – Service is good. Staff is attentive and serving time is great.

Food & Description – A health cafe is in these days with people getting more contious of their health. People are concerned about calorie count , sugar content, health benefits etc. But when you get a place where you get healthy as well as tasty food, you are bound to fall in love with it. The menu has a huge varieties of health food and few items also shows calorie contents, fat contents etc. Coming to the food:


Paneer Salsa Fajita Wrap - The wrap was served with sour cream & salsa dip. The wrap was oil free stuffed with paneer & chopped vegetables. The wrap was served hot & it tasted amazing. 


Banana & Oats Protein Shake - These days I love trying healthy drinks. This drink had amazing flavour and it was extremely healthy with no sugar added. Only honey was added that too absolutely right balance to not make it too sweet. A must try.


Overall the experience was great. Guiltless rating is the best thing. You eat tasty food and you feel like not harming yourself. Recommended.

Pocket Pinch - 800 for 2 approx.

Gone are the days when healthy eating translated to a ban on eating out, as the city is witnessing a spurt of growth of Health Cafes and Restaurants. And The Protein Bistro is definitely one of the trendsetters in the field. Tucked beside the Vivekananda Park, this bright, little, orangey place is the dream place for healthy eaters who aren’t ready to let go of the pleasure of eating out.

Mention must be made of their extremely well-designed menu, which specifically mentions the contents of each in the minutest of details including the amount of salt used. It also mentions the calorie count and also the fat, carbs, fibre content in grams. So even for those who keep a tight leash on what they eat, choosing an option from the menu at TPB is as easy as it gets.

 The meal started with a cup of my favorite brew, Earl Grey and their Chicken Hawaiian Salad. The salad was brilliant, with perfectly grilled chunks of chicken, pineapple dices and a host of other veggies with a light dressing. This was followed by a Rice Bowl, served with an egg on top and a brown garlic bread on the side. Though the rice for me was a tad bit undercooked, the crunchy bits of chopped vegetables in each mouthful made for a non-monotonous texture. The Pork Loin Sandwich which followed was a simple, hearty one with overflowing fillings, enough to satiate any hungry tummy. And finally the meal ended with Exotic Fruit and Nut with Protein Splash. For all those who believe healthy-desserts is an oxymoron, they need to drop everything and rush to The Protein Bistro to change their opinion. This pretty jar of sweet goodness is filled with almonds, raisins, dates and a range of fruits comes adorned with a crown of spun sugar and is the perfect guilt-free yet sweet ending to a happy healthy meal🙂.
                                          ...

As the name of this place hints, the food menu is mostly based on high protein diet like eggs, chicken etc. The ingredients of the dishes are made quite healthy by avoiding the use of unhealthy spices. Perfect place to head over to if you're looking for a tasty & healthy meal specially after working out. 
Only drawback : Quite Expensive

Found about this place through my search of healthy snacks in the city , it's in southern avenue just the lane after whatsapp cafe. I ordered mediterian chicken and protein shake. A good filler , the shake was very good. I kept ordering that since that day. Will definitely recommend everyone to visit this place if looking for healthy food.

The endearing facade of the building drew us to the place. 
The ambience was warm and comfortable even in a small space.
We ordered : Organic vegetable burger and caesar chicken salad.
The veggie burger had a crunchy and juicy efficacy with each bite and the salad was very fresh and lightly cooked.  Overall it was a good and healthy experience.

Today I placed an online order at Protein Bistro through Zomato & our Sunday dinner was spoilt! 

So what went wrong? Well, almost everything.... grilled chicken was oily (they r supposedly championing healthy diet) & tasted average. The pasta that came wth it was equally bad in taste.

Grilled fish, was the most epensive item in our order. The fish was so salty that we had to throw it. 

The biggest surprise was the ceaser salad - to our horror it was pipping HOT! & Yes, apart from letuce & 4 small pieces of bell peppers it did not have any vegies... 

The other putoff factor was the quantity of food, the portions were too small... We wasted Rs 1077/- & went to bed hungry!!

Thumbs up for the food quality.I had ordered for their famous almond Protein Milkshake along with Brown Rice Bowl with Eggs and Chicken for my lunch .It turned out to be amazing and very satisfying healthy food.

The ambience was good and the staff members are friendly and helpful as well. I wouldn't mind going there everyday for breakfast after a good workout from karma fitness studio (gym) which is right beside the cafe.

My husband and I went here for a healthy dinner. Though the place is pretty small, but that has no effect on the quality and taste of the food which is sheer top class. We had one non veg platter Hulk Meal, poach egg and bacon burger and one detox drink (photos attached). I will surely be returning here at least once a month.

Continue the great taste, Protein Bistro team. Also, if you guys read this then do add more options to your detox drink. And, all the very best with your upcoming new outlets 👍

The delivery time was 45mins but as i had requested them to see if an early delivery could be made, the food was delivered at my door step 15mins prior to the usual time. The packaging was good and above all, i loved the food. I highly recommend this place to all.

This place has it all! To top that the menu shows the exact protein amount each dish has! So food lovers and fitness lovers this is definitely your place to go. We also got one extra dessert as a complimentary​ dish..Way to go protein bistro!

I ordered a chicken sandwich from here and it was okay. It tasted like something I could make at home. I prefer my sandwiches grilled but it was a plain bread sandwich. The mayo dressing was okay and it had no exotic veggies. The USP of this place is it's cheap and it has some healthy food options.

Protein Bistro has been my favourite since it started. As by the name, it does mainly focus on protein rich food than then Low-calorie food even though they do have amazing soups and foods for health conscious. I love their risotto, to scrambled egg on toast to egg and feta wrap. There are more items that I like, but these are my favorite. The service is impeccable. The staff are friendly and keep a tab on any special notes or requirements. I was called for a special course meal, where all the items from the salmon to the dessert to the appetiser, everything was fantastic. I hope the quality and service remains as good as it is.

Healthy & Tasty Dining @ The Protein Bistro, Kolkata ☺

Any food item, first appeals us through it's sight, then it's smell and finally it's taste and texture! No wonder, any food item doesn't seem half as good when one is suffering from common cold, simply because one cannot smell the same with a blocked nose!

Till sometime back, people and dieticians associated health food (specially the vegetarian kind), with - boiled vegetables, fruits sans seasonings, sprouts, bitter juices etc. In short, the whole diet was tasteless, boring and impossible to find outside home. Once outside home, people on diet had to contain themselves with either a plate of idly or a packet of popcorn, and still worry about the presence of coconut in chutney and/or butter in popcorn!

Thanks to the discoveries of super foods, health food recipes, health supplements and the current advent of health food joints, healthy eating is now - tasty, filling, visually appealing and easily available.

These exactly were my sentiments upon visiting The Protein Bistro, the 16 seater and less than a year old health food cafe, situated in a quaint lane of Lake Terrace area, opposite Karma Fitness. The cafe is situated around the corner with ample parking space on both the sides. Huge glass window panes provide a good view of the outside. Decor and branding is centred around orange color. The seating provisions are both inside and outside. Enough reading material is strewn around for a good time pass.

"The bistro has a wide range of items to jazz up your mornings with scrumptious breakfast and end the day on a healthy note with lip-smacking dinner options. This place serves you a balanced meal with all required nutrients that one needs on a daily basis to stay fit and kicking."

Their menu comprises of - tea, coffee, protein shakes, protein smoothies, energy drinks, desserts, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, add-ons, starters, salads, soups, breakfast dishes, protein bowl meals, lean meals, continental main course dishes and fixed meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu consists of both vegetarian and non vegetarian options.

They strictly refrain from using artificial color, flavor, preservative and sugar. If required, they use honey in place of sugar, even in their coffee!

The items (all veg) presented for tasting were -

- Almond Protein Shake (Rs. 189/-): It comprised of a big glass with a sturdy biceps shaped handle, filled with a healthy drink made of powdered almonds and protein shake powder.

It tasted mildly sweet and was quite filling.

- Couscous Salad with Grilled Artichokes (Rs. 299/-): It comprised of a mound of couscous served along with a colorful side salad. Couscous was infused with fine choppings of bell peppers and topped with a sprig of green. The side salad comprised of red lettuce, grilled artichokes, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes etc. Some sliced prunes and almonds were also strewn for added taste and visual appeal.

This dish was enough in quantity, but was still light on the stomach. It tasted nice.

- Paneer Salsa Fajita Wrap (Rs. 149/-): It comprised of an almost zero oil wrap stuffed with chopped vegetables and cottage cheese, served along with small bowls of sour cream and salsa. The wrap was made of multi grain flour and organic seeds like - flax, sunflower seeds etc. The fajita was devoid of sauces and salsa was devoid of sugar or ready-made puree.

It tasted average. May be because we are too used to the sugary-tangy taste of assorted sauces!

- Starch Brown Rice Bowl (Rs. 169/-): A healthy serving of brown rice was served with some vegetables cooked in white sauce and a toasted slice of bread. The bread slice was topped with some grated low fat cheese. Assorted vegetables like - carrot, broccoli, zucchini etc. looked nice and colorful. Coriander leaves were garnished throughout the dish. Some onion roundels were also placed alongside.

It was a nice and filling dish. The vegetables were well cooked and still crunchy with their nutrients intact.

- Sofrito Spaghetti Aglio Olio (Rs. 230/-): This spaghetti dish was infused with chunks of tricolored bell peppers, herbs and enough chilli flakes. It was topped with a big sprig of coriander leaves. Two toasted and low fat cheese topped slices of bread were served alongside. The spaghetti was made of whole wheat and semolina.

The dish tasted nice, but the chilli content was a tad bit high.

- Exotic Fruit & Nuts Protein Splash (Rs. 269/-): It was a beautiful jar filled with yoghurt, blueberry compote, vanilla flavored whey protein powder, honey, mint, oats and chunks of green apple, pineapple, orange. It was topped with a healthy portion of assorted nuts like - prunes, almonds etc. An intricate praline mesh was placed on the jat, upon which a big sprig of mint leaves was fixated. The jar also contained the probiotic drink called Yakult for better digestion and immunity.

It was a zero fat but tasty and filling dessert. In fact, given the quantity, it was a delicious light meal in itself.

- Cappuccino (Rs. 89/-): A cup of low fat milk cappuccino was served with a small bowl of honey. I tried a couple of sips both with and without honey. Honey did bring a mild sweetness to the coffee which tasted nice.

This coffee was not pre designed by the cafe in the tasting menu. I called for it to understand the honey concept and inform the readers about the same.

To sum it up, The Protein Bistro is a nice health food cafe, co-owned by three health conscious partners, who look forward to provide healthy, tasty and attractive food in all the food categories, amidst a friendly and cheerful environment and well trained staff.

A lot of eateries are coming up with the concept of healthy eating; targeting the bodybuilders and models - tasty+healthy, a mix and match of carbs and proteins in their terminologies. Protein Bistro, located at Lake Road, a  stone's throw distance from Vivekananda Park, is an example of one such eatery.
Be it a veg or non or a drink, it is prepared in a way that balances the combination of proteins and carbohydrates - mentioning the amount of proteins involved.

Been here many times post workout or just as a hangout, I have always been moved by the delicious vanilla milk protein shake. Some of their other dishes worth mention are the burgers and the fish wraps.
A must try out for all gym lovers. Non-gym people can also be a part of this outlet. The health related books kept just under the tables are a good read. Price is also on the economical and affordable side.

I missed them very badly when they taken off their Salt Lake wala joint... but became very happy aa soon as I found them in Zomata again... so planned a visit their some days back... Now it is very well place along with very good deco n comfortable seating arrangements... a perfect place for hangout with friends n family over healthy food... yes you heard it right... Healthy Food... and here is my reason for liking this place... they provides yummy & tasty healthy foods... I known it is bit different for you guys to belive me but it is true... 
In my last visit I tried their...

💝 Juicy Detox~ Very very well made... tasted so good...

💝 Grilled chicken with pasta~ So tasty... I can still feel the taste... 

The positive thing about the place is you can grab anything without the worries of getting fat... ha ha ha...
Pocket pinch was very very justified...

Had visited the place today with a friend on an invitation.  Located in southern avenue near Vivekananda Park,  it is a small but decently decorated place. They have come up with the concept of tasty and healthy food which essentially provides you all your vital nutrients without the excess oil and fat. We were greeted and served a cup of Earl Grey and a Latte. The menu has a lot of options from different salads, sandwiches,  burgers,  rice bowls and full plated meal options. We had the chicken hawaiian which was tasty with a lot of green vegetables, pineapples and bug chunks of grilled chicken. Then came in the brown rice bowl with a fried egg on top. The rice was a little too hard but overall it was nice and garlicky and seasoned well. Then we had a pork loin sandwich which was good but nothing extraordinary. We finished our meal with the exotic fruits and but protein splash which was a visual treat. Loaded with seasonal and dry fruits it also had one big mesh of spun sugar which added to the presentation. The staff is very courteous and the chef Mr. Somalia Banik also came multiple times for the feedback on the food. Overall a good experience. Thanks to the chef and protein bistro for hosting us. Will surely visit gain. And as their motto says "Next time someone says healthy food is tasteless, fork them" :)

No beating around the bush here. Being a foodie and that too an experimental one I simply loved the food here. Wht really set me up was the availability of each and every dish on the card. I tried the smoked salmon with scrambled egg toast which was appetizing as well as satisfying. Chicken fajita was equally flavorful and filling. I felt like trying every dish on the card. I ll keep going back until I am done with the entire lot.

Talking turkey, my rating for The Protein Bistro is solely based of the sautéed vegetables and omelette they served me today in the breakfast platter. The Protein Bistro is located nearby Vivekanda Park and serves healthy food. I ordered for the non veg breakfast platter with mushrooms as add on. The platter came with certain pros and cons:

Pros:

1. The omelette was fabulous, it was soft and juicy and perfectly seasoned.

2. The sautéed vegetables were too good, soft perfectly glazed and properly seasoned.

3. The mushrooms were perfect.

4. The chicken sausages were excellently cooked.

5. The fruits were fresh.

Cons:

1. Bacons were properly cooked. Looked and tasted more on the "rare" side rather being crispy.

2. The breakfast platter had 'oats' as per the menu, but it was missing when the platter was served.

3. They served everything on single plate, everything was cluttered, the fruits had bacon grease on them.

4. The potato wedges were excessively charred.

Suggestions:

Please serve the fruits separately. And please cook the bacon to a crisp finish. And include everything that you have mentioned in the menu when you serve the dish.

Apart from these, the decor was soothing and the ambience was perfect. The staffs were polite and friendly. And a great job on the omelette and the veggies. Foodies can consider this place for a hearty breakfast.

The Protein Bistro is a health food restaurant founded in 2016 with the goal of offering people a nutritious alternative to fast food restaurants. It is located near Vivekananda Park.The Protein Bistro has a vast array of healthy meal options with presence of Vegetables and Protein. It's a small joint located cozy corner of street. Providing a cover of around 20 seats. Very much neatly organized as the kitchen is just a feet away from dine in area. They also having few outdoor seating arrangements. The Menu Card was interesting and provided a tag of "Form Them". The interior wall was full of write ups based on Nutrition and basically Protein. 

We have been served with Almond Vanilla Protein Shake in the very begining. Served into a huge glass with Muscle shape handle. It would be easily contain 750 ml + pure healthy drinks. The drink was superb & refreshing. Made with skimmed milk and richness of grind almonds. A very nice start to the healthy Protein Ride.

It was time for the salad. Corn Potato Salad served with boiled eggs.A pretty salad with added some spices/fresh herbs. Bright colors. A good line up for the meal to arrive. 

Petits Farcis (Provencal Stuffed Zucchini) was next item on the menu. These stuffed vegetables are typical fare from Provençe - the region that hugs the Mediterranean coastline in the South of France. Vegetables, olives and olive oil are used in abundance in Provençe, and this recipe really captures the sun and fragrance of this much-loved area! It was an excellent light dish perfect for dinner. 

It was time to move forward and have some non veg protein meal. Norwegian Salman with Sweet Potato mash.  This classic winter comfort dish is topped with a nutritious sweet potato mash that is sure to go down well with your family. Cool presentation and healthy ingredients. 

Let's go back to Lebanon. Chicken Sish Tawook.  The name points to its Turkish origins (Tavuk şiş) however it is quite a common chicken bbq dish in virtually every Middle Eastern country, it is one of the tastiest chicken kabbab around served with grilled veggies.Served with three dips. Salsa and  two others. 

Going through an organised meal in the evening, it was time for shut down the system with an Mouthwatering deserts. 
Yakut Protein Splash. Desert version of Yakut Products. Sweetened with blueberry and contained chopped oranges, pineapple, apples, bananas and sweet lime. Flavoured with honey and cinnamon and cloudy ornamental decoration on top with a ming leaf. A diet dessert. 

Here is your chance to dive in endless healthy dishes and loose the stubborn fat by eating out Protein Dishes. 

Thanks

One of a kind restaurant. Honestly been across so many restaurant but none can be parallel to this one. It is not a very big place but the covers have been laid out strategicly. Deals with 20 covers or so in total. I first went there when i had a bodybuilding competion coming up in next 2 weeks. Fed up with the boiled chicken and boiled eggs i wanted to try something good but healthy.

Parked the car right next to the restaurant. Went inside got a table pretty quickly. The menu was very interesting as it dealt with majorly healthy food and beverages.

Ordered a honey glazed grilled chicken along with a shrimp starter. The chef on my request made my dishes without salt. Even after no salt both the items were amazing to taste. The beverage ordered were almond vanilla protein shake and chocolate protein shake. Both came in a towering huge glass. Easily would be containg 600-700 ml of yumilicious protein shake.

The service is quick and the food is good. It doesn't dents the pocket either.  It is a good addition to kolkata's healthy eating scene. Job well done team the protein bistro. 
Recommended for all healthy food lovers!😍👌

It's located near Vivekanand park. Small place with couple of table for outdoor sitting. 
First, food is really nice. Tried the wraps, burger and pasta. When food is kind of more healthy than always. Burger not making you feel but also is healthy. 
However, for the namesake they could have included items which are very low on carbs and high on protein. 
All the items have good amount of carbs. Wrap had very thick outside, almost like uncooked. Too much of maida it was. But taste wise it was good. I hope you work on wraps before I order again. Also, as per menu it says 16g protein but am sure it wasn't 16g. 
I am rating it well, till next time. Because it make taste buds happy.

Almost in every nook and corner of Kolkata nowadays you will find one food joint or other. There they remain for sometime, some very popular, some not so, and then they disappear to give place to some other different joint. So in order to attract patrons, they offer something different from the others around themselves. This joint is one such joint.

Today I was feeling a bit hungry so I wanted to try some food joint which I haven't visited before. As I steered down the lane beside Vivekananda Park, my eyes fell on this joint. Healthy food is what attracted me. There being ample car parking space, I comfortably parked my car and walked in. In this area where there is almost back-to-back food joints of different types, this certainly stands out for offering healthy food.

There is seating arrangement outside the joint as well, but I preferred going in. A very tiny joint with I think ten seating arrangement. Seems a renovated garage space. Beautiful and warm decoration. There is television running in silence. What I liked about the place is the table where underneath the glass top, you have books of your choice and menucards. Quite a novel idea. At one side of the joint is the juice cellar which is decorated like wine cellar. 

I was welcomed by a hefty person who is the manager. I made myself comfortable and took out the menu. It is actually more of a book. It tells us of the history behind the formation of this joint. I read the full menu card from cover to cover before placing order.

Although it focussed on health factor and calorie counting, I doubt if all the food offered by it is at all healthy to the true sense of term.  At last, with the consultation of the staff - a smiling boy whose name I could not quite catch (Suvendu?) - I chose Mediterranean chicken skewers and protein fruit splash. 

Chicken skewers arrived shortly. Chicken pieces were soft and juicy and yes, not much oily. It tasted light, accompanied with colourful capsicums and cabbage and lettuce leaves. Delicious, but I forgot about it as soon as protein fruit splash arrived. It looked hugely tempting the colours of white and berry and green. Actually it is a mixture of yoghurt and fruit with a tulsi leaf on top as garnish. And oh I loved it. I am going to come back for it whenever I feel the craving for sweet something.

The staff is very polite, without a doubt. The food presentation is also quite noteworthy. 

Pricewise it is on the steeper side, though.

I walked into this place with a lot of hope, at a time when I was on a protein-rich zero-carb diet. What I saw on the menu was a disaster, with recipes brimming with carbs and protein together. Their menu is designed to cater to the common misconception of people - that if you cut out all kinds of fat from your diet, it's healthy. The problems with the menu? a) macros not mentioned. When a person following a strict diet decides to eat out, he wants to know how much of fat, carb, protein, fibre, calories, etc. he is putting into his mouth. b) each and every food has high carb content. This is problematic not only for those who are on a low carb diet, but also for those who want a balanced diet. When I spoke to the people, they could not help me with any of the questions I asked. All they could say is that it's a professionally designed menu, and their chef is highly experienced. Since I had gone for a take away, they suggested that they would slightly undercook the pork and pack it in foil for me, and that the pork would be cooked perfectly when by the time I would reach. When I bit into the pieces at home, the pieces felt almost raw, to the point where the meat was still slightly translucent. I had to throw the entire dish away. I had also ordered some chicken satay, and s burger. The satay was dry and weirdly spiced to taste like Bombay mix. And that last one was a special kind of disaster. Of all things they could have eliminated carbs from, they chose this - the patty of the burger. So, what I got was a burger with some Mayo and veggies, and some pieces of chicken sitting top. It was like making a burger with leftover chilli chicken, something that college studenta would do when out of option. This is the kind of restaurant that discourages people from eating healthy.

If I was to rate this place just on its service and decor only I would have scored it a 4 but with the food this is the best I could do. The protein bistro has been on my radar for a while and finally made it this evening . We ordered for the pork sandwich and a spinach and egg wrap. 
The pork sandwich was dull. The pork though tender was cut in big pieces and with Huge slices of cucumber and tomato the sandwich was plain cumbersome to eat. Absolutely no seasoning and was served tomato sauce on the side . The bread was the best bit here. 
The wrap looked beautiful on the plate. The shredded vegetables testament to excellent knife work. The wrap looked promising but again lacked seasoning. Though feta spinach and eggs go really well together the wrap reminds you of the Emirates economy class breakfast . Thank God for the source cream and salsa dips on the side. 
Healthy food shouldn't be dull or bland and proteins are flavour full by itself so this isn't the best experience here. I recommend binge watching Jamie Oliver for a week.

Today i visited this place for the first time i ordered for a grilled chicken pasta and fish wrap followed by almond protein shake . I can say the foods were really good with nice texture. They serve a good quality of pasta which tastes little bit lemone flavour and the grilled chicken is nicely jucy and tender which i got with brown sauce which tastes different from rugular grilled chicken fish wrap is ok and the shake is really healthy. I also had a good conversation with the chef . Overall experience is good i will surely recommend my friends to visit this place and i will be back soon to try the other dishes

Ordered from here via Swiggy. The Protein Bistro was a much needed addition to the lack of legitimate healthy options for fitness enthusiasts.

Ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad and a portion of grilled chicken with spaghetti.

For a place which touts the fitness tag, the salad was drenched in a mayo laden dressing. It would be better if the dressing was provided on the side instead. The grilled chicken was a hearty meal but the spaghetti was a tad too oily. Again, multigrain spaghetti and a little less oil would further increase the health quotient.

Would order again as well as recommend, but these small issues may be a deal breaker in the long run. Hopefully they're rectified soon. 

Edit: Rating has been improved after prompt reply from the management. The orders were specifically stated to be without the Mayo on the Swiggy app. But it was never conveyed.

my first visit to this Bistro was after puja when u r very much dedicated to have clean food as now you are content with guilt of having those fuchkas and biriyani😢😢 during puja.they have a tag that fork them who claim healthy foods are not tasty. and beleve me they are justifying it every way. though it s a small place but the arrangement is quite good as you will get books to read and which s not chargeble😆. unlike some "other places" they provide their wifi to u.

       ziippping it and starting with the food. we first ordered bacon wrapped chicken which was tender and juicy. the pasta was completely whole wheat made. and we had grilled basa which was really the best basa after a long time. the banana and oats smoothy was in itself a complet food. the choco milkshake i really dont want to comment apart from saying OMG(find out of ur own😈😈😈) we were offered a complimentary dessert from the house which made me feel really special.i soecially mention one name who made our fooding experience more than just a lunch was Albin. a very nice person and we r glad to meet him.overall like after sitting there for lunch we r now in a habit of getting their food in our home tabble. it s really a healthy and may be a first chain of this kind in kolkata and happy😊 with it.

This little place is situated at Lake road right opposite of The Karma fitness club. The idea behind this coffee shop is to serve health related drinks, more specifically, it is targeted for the health conscious guys. However, it does not mean one would get only health drinks and food.
I visited the coffee shop with Tanwyee Ray and Sayan Bakshi.
The place has a good décor. Ambience is good, with well-lit atmosphere and comfortable sitting arrangements. For a small hangout, it is quite comfy.

The staff was very friendly and with a smile handed us the menu. Every item on the menu comes with a calorie count, which is good for one who prefers to have a measure of each bite. Since we were out to try something new, we preferred measuring the taste than the calorie.
From the menu, we ordered one Mixed fruit protein smoothies, one cucumber juice detox and on Earl grey.
The mixed protein smoothies tasted good but nothing special. The juice detox with cucumber flavour was something special. With crushed ice the cucumber detox juice was rely good. I liked the way they presented the drink. The Earl grey, which is a different flavour tea blended with the oil of bergannot, was smooth in taste. The glass cup with the tea was also elegant in presentation.
For starters we ordered, one sauteed shrimp with lemon, garlic , butter and parsley as garnish.
Sauteed Shrimp dish - Shrimp was fried nicely with butter, which added to the softness and the garlic made it a little spicy. The dish was garnished with capsicum and cabbage which added sweetness to the dish.
Chicken skewer - Although the dish was spicy but I found the chicken as hard and difficult to chew. The dish was also garnished with capsicum, and cabbage.
The pork tenderloin- This I felt was the best of all. The pork tenderloin was cooked nice, even and it was soft. It was garnished with mashed potato, which complemented the spicy flavour from the Pok choy sauce added to the dish. If one is not averse to pork, then I recommend having this dish.
In the end, we decided to have a Exotic yakult protein splash. This sweet dish had Yakult, a probiotic skimmed milk, as the base with fruit as toppings along with a little chocolate syrup. The presentation of this dish was attractive but in my opinion is a bit too much. The splash was good in taste.

Our experience was good with the resturant and will definitley look forward to coming again. I do hope they have a bigger place so that I can bring all of my friends here.

Been there once. Lunch hour. Hardly a crowd. Excellent service. Personal looking after. Good recommendations. Tasty food.
Will certainly go back. With friends this time.
Menu conveniently tells you how much protein you will be eating at every meal. It does not tell you how much fat, carb and how many calories. I was told the revised menu card will have it all.
The kitchen is too close to the dining area and conversation is often loud and at times disturbing. Otherwise a pleasant dining experience.

Salmon steak with asparagus : The life cycle of the salmon completed in its totality finding its way to the plate with a complement of tropical and sub-tropical flavours. The taste however could have been better but not something easily  forgettable. In the whole a good  experience. Beware of the juice detox though. It bites.

Loved the presentation of the dishes and the taste combinations. Good service and the seating was quite comfortable, not to mention plenty of outside view. 

Is the food really healthy? Yes, you actually get excellent options here that are way better for you than what's available at the average eateries around.

If you are health conscious or watching your diet I would definitely recommend this place.

I will only change my review when i get a delivery from this protein cafe. 
Today i tried twice. 
First time order got cancelled from online zomato delivery. 
Second time order was accepted and then i get a call from the protein bistro that order cannot be delivered because of unavoidable circumstances. 
I don't know what was the actual reason, whether it was my rs 99 order or delivery boy unavailable. 

I will change my review after i visit this protein cafe in person or a successful home delivery.

For the last few days I am searching for some healthy food joints in Kolkata. Suddenly protein bistro caught my attention so I thought of giving it a try and thankfully it did not disappoint. It's a small cafe but the person's are very friendly. Myself and my wife ordered salmon and spaghetti with grilled chicken and also have a whey protein drink. Food was very delicious yet healthy. I will love to go there again to try other dishes. Thanks for serving a great lunch.

The Protein Bistro is located bang opposite Karma Fitness Studio at Lake Terrace. This is a small cafe that aims to serve healthy food. Now, healthy food is a fairly new concept here and there are very few players who are working in this niche genre. Thankfully, The Protein Bistro is one of them and fortunately, they dnt disappoint. So, the health food here isn't bland or devoid of flavours. Sure, you wnt find cream or cheese or anything that adds bulk to your frame, but the food is surprisingly good. 
Post work-out, I was in mood for a light lunch and was in the area, so headed to The Protein Bistro to grab a bite. The cafe can sit about 10-12 people at a time. The huge window panes and the all glass door give you a sense of space as you look down Lake Terrace. The cozy chairs are quite relaxing and they have a collection of books available at each table for diners to go through while they wait for the food. 
I was suggested the Grilled Chicken with spaghetti and a detox juice. Now the detox juice is something I wouldn't have ordered in the first place; but I did try it since it sounded exciting. It was actually, with cucumber, honey, ginger, mint and apple cider. It tasted different and fresh, however, it's not something that I would like to order again. The thyme scented grilled chicken was amazing. The spaghetti was good without any cheese or fat whatsoever and the grilled chicken was tender with a delicious mushroom sauce. The dish was a riot of colours with the bell peppers giving in different shades. It's a tad bit pricey, but then the price is justified; its that good. Surely the grilled chicken or the spaghetti will not replace my old favourites from other eateries, some of them being close to The Protein Bistro, but it's certainly re-assuring to know that healthy food can be equally delicious. I shall visit soon to try out the salads and the wraps.

Nice concept restaurant. Menu is quite well designed. Provides the right selection choices. Fast service and interactive and well trained staff. Chef caters to personal taste requests. That's a big welcome feature. Highly recommended for health conscious people. Poached egg  bacon burger and almond broccoli salad was wholesome and tasted like a fresh home made meal. Salmon was out of stock. Next time!

It's a small place near Vivekananda Park which has quite an impressive menu and endless literature on nutrition adorning one entire wall. We went for a quiet dinner for two and felt good about the healthy choice we'd made. Started with the Chimichurri Mushrooms which came with a side of crunchy but well-dressed iceberg lettuce and bell peppers. The mushrooms were done just right....with correct seasoning and flavouring that enhanced their shroominess! We ordered a detox juice and a cup of Darjeeling to wash down our dinner....both were nice. For mains I ordered the Lebanese chicken platter which contained hummus, Baba ganoush, raita and four fat chicken and bell pepper skewers. Very filling this was though the raita was tasteless and a bit too watery and the baba ganoush reminded me of simplified baingan bharta. The chicken was tasty, succulent and well-seasoned. As for the pork that my friend ordered....some pieces were cooked to perfection and others were a bit chewy but the bed of potato mash it was served on was creamy and eminently edible. All in all it was a simple yet good meal which ensured no guilt about the calories consumed or the amount spent.

What a great place in Lake Terrace.

Very small place with only 5 tables in total, but well made and decent.
Creative thought had been put in the entire concept and the menu.

We had ordered Veg Organic Burger, Paneer Salsa Fajita Wrap, Lemon Detoxify drink and a Vanilla Protein Shake.
Burger was fantastic, nothing I have had before, very different fulfilling taste, really loved it.
A little less of Garam masala would have been better.
Paneer Salsa Fajita Wrap - Yummy.
Lemon Detoxify and Vanilla Protein Shake was refreshing.
Their menu card gives details on the amount of protein each item contains, the walls contains information on the types of fat and protein details - very informative.

This is a must go for all food lovers, health buffs and who just want to experience something different and unique. Icing on the cake - Pocket friendly.
Loved the place, would definitely visit again to try something different next time.

Read about this place from zomato and planned to visit this place.Its a very small cafe with sitting arrangement for not more than 10 to 12 people but the ambiance is very beautifully done. When I went I could see most of the people after there workout session at Karma studio were visiting this place.Menu options are pretty good with many healthy beverages. I ordered Almond Vanilla shake and Spaghetti with soft roll. Shake was good but I had a trouble drinking because it was served in very tall glass with lots of almond pieces so could not sip it through straw and since the glass was tall having with spoon was difficult . Apart from this the spaghetti was very nicely done .Prices are at a bit higher side .

 Ordered a Chicken Fajita wrap and a Vanilla Fruit protein shake. The food was good, and as promised, much less oily and healthier. Extremely tasty too. Definitely suggest this place, for some healthy eating.

PS added quirky signs like "No Smoking - unless you're fresh off the stove".

place were too small and i didn't expect that in a small place how can they serve food with well platting and portion size was too enough for one person and its too reasonable, affordable for everyone. Staffs were very friendly with us. Food quality were beyond my expectation. very soon i will visit again.

I came over here just few days back, the place  was too small but the ambience and staff behaviour was so good that i cant explain it in a words. Food was out of expectation of mine and its totally new concept fully healthy. Service guy "Debangan" and "Sandip" was too polite and well discipline and so friendly.
We have almond protein shake that was awesome its so huge.....after that chicken hulk meal-taste  was awesome chicken serve with mashed potato, sauteed vegetable, poached egg and garlic bread..well platting and garnish with rosemary sprig. As we talk with chef Prasanta he was so polite and smiley face.
I will Definitely visit you again.
This new concept of healthy food is best for the jymer people....

Finally Kolkata got its cheap and affordable protein paradise ! The prices are reasonable , don't care about the ambiance , cause fitness freaks ( like me ) will always go to places like these for the food and it's nutritional values , had an almond protein shake , was huge and much better than having lassis , the scrambled eggs and pork was filling , although I wish the bacon strips were more crunchier !! Maybe next time for sure !! I would definitely keep going to this place after heavy workouts !

 Address:
Lake road , opposite to karma fitness centre. 
Staff: very well behaved !
This lil joint which can attract ur eyes very much if u are fitness freak or if u trying b on diet. Very innovative menu i must say that! I personally loved it. Those protein smoothies and shakes were out of the world. I expected lil shallow ( as they don't use any sugar or any sweetener) while I had that smoothie but it's perfectly made without sugar☕️🍧. They use pure honey as sweetener which is very impressive.  They make all food with extra virgin olive oil. 🍾They use real protine powder inside smoothies. 🍹Price very reasonable and very clean place. 👌🏻I wont say super interior or mind-blowing comfort zone inside.this place for them who love healthy food and also for them who thinks "healthy food can't be tasty"
