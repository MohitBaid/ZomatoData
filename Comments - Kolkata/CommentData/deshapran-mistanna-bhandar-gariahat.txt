This sweet shop is located next to Spencer's, Gariahat near Basanti Devi College. It has been there since ages and continues their appreciable services till date. I have had their servings a couple of times. On my recent visit, I tried their Aamshotto Mishti and Lyangcha. I loved the Aamshotto Mishti and would like all the sweet lovers to try it out. The lyangcha was so-so; I have had better lyangchas elsewhere. Deshapran is particularly famous for their namkeens. The Kachoris they serve are amazing. They are a must-try. Arguably, this is the best sweet shop in Gariahat area.

Deshapran misstanna bhandar is very popular in Gariahat area near basanti devi college. Located beside Spencer hyper retail outlet, this sweet shop was renovated recently after decades. Pricing to quality all was top notch. Their cholar daal and kachori a must try.

Well this sweet outlet is among the oldest ones in this area. "Deshapran Mistanna Bhandar" is a synonymous name to all the sweet lovers in this locality. Previously it was situated just beside the gariahat "Spencers" but now it has been shifted inside a lane due to construction purpose. As everyone knows this place is a perfect destination for quality sweets and savories. Among their offerings the "kachori and chola daal" is the most cherished one by the people and is one of the tastiest available in town. This joint doesn't have any kind of fancy decor, they completely focuses on delivering quality products to their customer. To be honest delivering satisfaction is the most important priority afterall which is delivered with perfection by this joint.

Deshapran is best known for their yummy dal kachories rather than their sweets in South Kolkata. They are one of those legendary confectioneries that have been doing their business for ages. The small sweet shop is located just a few steps ahead of Spencer's in Rashbehari Avenue.

Visiting there has only one purpose, their hot and fresh dal-kachories. However they also have a descent collection of sweets such asÂ  rasgulla, chamcham, pantua, soan-papdi, jilipi and mishti doi. Snacks are also available like samosa, veg. chop etc.
