Great Biryani and real easy on the pocket too. But Home delivery is not that great. Have not tried other items on the menu. They are probably decent too.

Good restaurant. Just next to my house. I keep on ordering chicken steamed momos and they are realllyyy yuuummmmyy. Every week a plate of momo is must now. Anyway, each and every food is best. The quality is also good.

Polao and chicken tikka masala
Shezwan dry with chicken gravy noodles
And Biriani for addicts.

And many more may be.

Very poor communication skills. Being a regular basis customer I am very sorry to say that when I complained that last time the Biriyani was bad they don't want to know even talk to me very badly.

Excellent quality of foods with bearable prices. Specialy Biriyani is awesome. Quantity is also very good. But there is a very small space. They need to be aware about there space.

The Biryani of this eatery is pretty legendary. people come from faraway places to savor this exquisite delicacy. They also do prepare several other excellent dishes. It would be great if somebody could upload their menu. Hope they provide Home delivery to DPS North Kolkata in near future.
