It's the horrible food joint I've ever ordered food. Somebody recommended and I ordered 30 nonveg combo meals for a party at my place which is a 200mtrs away from the joint.The food was supposed to be delivered by 9.Out of 30 they could deliver only 10 at 10.30 pm,another 10 at 11.30 pm and rest at 12.30..by that time my guests had left hungry. The owner Reshmi and Durjoy left me with nothing but terrible embarrassment.i never found such unprofessional approach anywhere. They are simply horrible

Good enough place if you want to have absolutely street side kind of  food. Nothing by way of ambience. It's quite shabby looking in fact. A vast menu.....Too many items put in....
Don't do justice to what they serve. Momos are just about ok.

I had ordered combo pack, non veg for my office colleagues on Viswakarma Puja day. It was fantastic. In this combo meal pack, they served, Fried rice, Dhokar dalna, Doi Macchh, Chicken Kosa and chatni. Quantity was enough against payment. We were very satisfied to had these. thanks to Durjoy Roy, Kokos, team. In future , for our any office function we will order them. Â I will visit the place with my family also.

Horrible joint. There is nothing good about this place. My first experience with this place will always be my last experience.

Was passing by this place, when I thought of a takeaway and that was my biggest mistake.

I got 3 double chicken rolls. The roll was so rubbery. It was dry like anything. We practically, had problem chewing it down. We actually needed the help of soft drinks to gulp it down. 

One of the worst experiences, I ever had.

No minus rating here, food was real bad! Chilli chicken and teriyaki chicken tastes totally same, tremendously sweet!! Prawn cutlet was burned black with bland batter, crispy chicken was not at all crispy but better than those nightmares, chicken pakoda was good, nothing like Dukan type... 'ghar ka swad'..nothing hatke! fine. One request, change the cook! He sucks! ðŸ˜•

My first Zomato Online order ruined by them... Paid via Paytm Wallet for 4 Chicken Chowmien.  After 30 mins they said they are cancelling the order and the guy "durjoy'' keep pressurising me for COD order ... Worst experience.

Again a good place for Chinese food...I wouldn't say it's excellent but yes the quality and quantity are good. As per price paid you will be satisfied. So a good place to go. Non appetite :)

This restro even delivers to paschim putiary..amount is enough for the price paid..the combo meal consisting of fried rice..noodles..chicken manchurian..two pieces momo and chicken lollipop,is enough for a hungry soul..but the non veg steak was simply HORRIBLE..never had a steak that tastes this bad..my request to this restro..please exclude the steak from your menu
