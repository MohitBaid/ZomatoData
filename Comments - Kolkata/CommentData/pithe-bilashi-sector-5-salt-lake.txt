Recently got to about this place at city centre newtown's nolen gur utsav. This place is a bit pricey but it is worth it.  We opted for their chocolate patisapta, mango patisapta and chingri malaicurry patisapta. The chocolate and mango are served witth chocolate sauce and mango jelly respectively.  They are quiet good . But the chingri malaicurry patisaptathe  is something to drool on. Its just wonderful.  Such an innovative thing  and  that too the taste is just too good.  Will love to visit this restaurant.

Recommended this restaurant to many friends who wants to taste authentic Bangali pithe. We ordered baked patisapta, coconut kheer patisapta, nolen icecream gokul and mohan puli. Baked patisapta and nolen icecream gokul are to die for. If someone is not fond of sweets he can order coconut kheer patisapta.

● Date: 8/1/2018● Location: Nalban food park, salt lake sector v, opposite cognizant office.● Description: After having lunch at the all fish there I went to this restaurant along with my sister for dessert.● Order type: Dine in.● Menu: They serve mocktails, tea, coffee and some snacks too but we were there only for the pithe.● Item: 1 baked patishapta, 1 chocolate puli and 2 coconut keer patishapta.● Price: ₹210.00/-● Staff and service: Staff were polite. As soon as we entered the served us water in clay glasses. But the time taken for cooking is high so we had to wait for sometime.● Ambience and decor: It is a tiny and beautiful place. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. They use clay utensils which matches with the theme of the restaurant.● Food description:◆ Baked patishapta: It was not good-looking at all. But as soon as I tasted it I realized that it is great. It was delicious.◆ Chocolate puli: Keer pulis with chocolate sauce on top. ◆ Narkel kheer patishapta: It was an ordinary patishapta for me. It had coconut in the filling.● Food recommendation to other foodies: Baked patishapta.

Bought a few items from them from the Fish fest. Three types of patisapta.. One normal that we make at home...it was hot and really good, freshly made. It deserves full marks. Then second was the baked in gur patisapta.. It had turned a bit off. So a disappointment. Then the chocolate patisapta... it was really yumm. We also bought gokul pithe.. did not like it much as the batter was too thick.

Winter has come. We bengalis are craving for our good old 'pithe' and 'nolen gur'. Pithe bilasi has come up to satiate our craving with some traditional pithe with a twist of modern touch.
CHOCO PATISAPTA, MANGO PATISAPTA, NOLEN ICE CREAM GOKUL and many more are in the menu.
Their 'pithe's are unique in the sense that those are not too sweet rather a hint of salty taste make them unique.
Apart from pithe, khichuris are also good. MUTTON KHICHURI with coconut posto bora and chutney is yummy.
This outlet is small, seating arrangement is basic. Service needs to be improved.
A must visit place particularly during winter.

Tasted Pithe Bilashi's mouthwatering patishaptas at Ahare Bangla 2017 yesterday. They have got more flavours of pithes than you can even imagine there can be. I went for their special khir and narkol patishapta and mango patishapta. Priced at 40 each, the pithes taste simply delicious. Worth every penny. Would surely visit the outlet soon!

Actually, I have not visited their outlet. I have visited their stall in misti utsob at city centre 2 and hostosilpo mela. On both occasions, we were really impressed with the taste and quality of their food. We tried their vetki patisapta, baked patisapta, mohon puli and also bought a bottle of nolen gur. Both the baked patisapta and mohon puli were delicious. The filling made of pure keer mixed with various ingredients  was too good . The vetki patisapta was unique with a filling made of fresh vetki. The nolen gur was also satisfactory. The staffs are friendly and full of energy. Will definitely visit them here to explore other options on the menu.

Loved their Cheese Chicken Baked Patisapta. The chicken patisapta is like a crepe but thicker than it. The chicken filling should have been less dry to stick to the crepe properly. Eagerly waiting to try a few more items.

Great pithes.. Since my childhood I had pithas of different kind made by my mother. I had always been skeptical of pithas made by eateries. Often they lack the finesse required to make these delicacies. However today i ordered by home delivery from them. Baked patisapta, kheer narkol patisapta, gokul pitha, mohan puli. Every thing was awesome, huge quantity and so beautifully made. Anyone yearning to have great pithas and can't have them at home, please do visit /order from them
Thumbs up

Great ambience and yummy fusion. We came for gokul pithe with icecream. But no icecream dish was available. Hence we tried kheer gokul and nolen payesh. Both of the items were superb. However, giving rating 4.5 because of the unavailability of the icecream items. Hopefully we will get this next time.

Pithe itself fills every bengali heart with nostalgia and memories.
Pithe Bilashi has come up with the traditional pithe with a twist of modern touch and it touches every bengali's emotional cord.
The pathisapta pithe's have never been so great and the experience has left me awestruck with the different varieties of pathisaptas.
My eyes fell on the variety of pathisaptas which i have never tasted before and it was simple yet so tasty in my tongue.
The price is reasonable enough to indulge yourself in this gastronomical journey of pithe's.

Pithe Bilashi is the perfect example of experimentation going right.

Ordered khichuri combo and got the surprise of our life time. They sent rotten food. The smell in the AC room was so horrible that we had to spray room freshner to chase it away. The food...well we threw it away too. I think the management should look into their kitchen before selling food and about the 5 rating, please remember that in this digital era reviews can be bought.

We ordered khichuri platter on a rainy day, each cost us 175 rs. The platter comprising of ghee khichuri, narkel posto bora, papad, chatni. The khichuri was awesome and the quantity was good, the narkel bora was okish, oily smelling and the chatni was awesome. The only cons was its price, which was not worth 175, but if u want good khichuri den do visit but not for the narkel posto bora please!

This place has been in my wish list for a long time since sector V being my work place made plans to visit a number of times but could actually make it happen today. "Just amazing" will be the adjective to describe the place. Sitting arrangement was quite innovative as well as also the food served there. However today only got the chance to taste their famous Baked patishapta and choco gokul pithe. Patishapta was heavenly, while the gokul pithe was good but could have been better! Staffs are very well behaved and cooperative.

Nice place for a sinful indulgence....highly recommended and shall definitely look forward to taste their other delicacies very soon.

Must be rated high.
Zomato must note this.
Located inside the Nalban Food Park.
Decorated with wooden texture and white transparent glass.Simple yet Beautifull.
Orderd baked patisapta.
To my surprise it tasted so so awesome.Smell of pure ghee,kheer and smoke gave it a mind blowing taste.I cant forget the feeling after i had just one spoon of that patisapta.
We then packed some more for my family and close friends.Everyone was amazed.
Keep it up guys.Kudos to you.
Never expected PITHE to be so so yummy.
Their menu is also interesting with all sorts of fusion like fish patisapta,veg patisapta and ......
Unique,simple and beautifull.
Highly,happily and strongly reccomended.

Well, my experiences with the popular Bengali dish – the Patishapta pithas have never been great! A couple of experiments at some local outlets with this sweet dish had always left me with a sour tongue – but today, simply the converse happened!

My eyes fell on this newly opened outlet – just besides the Nalban food park, Sector 5, Saltlake. Since I was somewhat insatiate after having a very light home-cooked meal, I entered this outlet without a 2nd thought!

Simple is beautiful – and yes, this is what this place teaches you! Seating arrangements are designed like the ones which used to be in retro Calcutta – wooden and very modest décor on the walls of the goodies they offer! Space is huge – mind it and simple lamps light up the place brilliantly! They gave me a decent welcome and offered a cool glass of water in a clay container – just superb!

The chocolate patishapta was my 1st choice – as I had never tasted such an item before, which was served in 10-12 minutes. Full marks for the presentation – a long log of neatly folded chocolate mixed rice cake topped with streams of choco sauce – just PERFECT!!!!!!!!

Most importantly, the taste was heavenly – and I just kept on marvelling the chef at every morsel – Damn – the pitha was over in just a couple of minutes – wish I could keep eating it forever!

The chef bragged about several food awards they have received for their signature pithas – Man – they do deserve them and pretty much more!

Pocket pinch is so reasonable that you need not wait for your pay check to arrive - you can visit this place anytime!
I am grateful to the management for this experience – I reward you with a 5-star rating, several re-visits and huge RECOMMENDATIONS!

Now looking forward to taste their khichdi platter!

I have been here more than thrice. The owner and her daughter in law(cook) are super friendly. Last time I went they haven't put up their shop in Zomato. I have waiting to provide a positive review since February.The first time I came across them was in 'ahaare bangali' ( one of the biggest and super successful food festival to be organised in Kolkata). By the crowd I understood the food was something special. And indeed it was. They sell mainly 'pithe', one entirely different sweet cuisine of Bengalis. Yes cuisine because 'pithe' are of various type that I feel they are a cuisine of their own. The second encounter was at nalban fish festival where I finally found out the stall was just opposite to my office.

Location : Just opposite to MC Donald saltklake or Cognizant Office, in the nalban food park.
Service : bit slow. May be because of less working hands. Need to be improved!!
Food : worth a try. We had pithe Puli with icecream and heavenly it was. Baked pathisapta to chocolate pathisapta. Everything was too good. If u are a sweet lover, this is the place to be.
