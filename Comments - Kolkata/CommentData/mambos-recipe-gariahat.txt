At the very first visit I dived into some red velvet muffins, lemon and blueberry muffins. They were just heavenly. Nice decor with sweet music. Must visit!!

Located in the by Lanes of golpark, this is a very nicely decorated cake shop. Interiors are all white with cute decorations, it can hardly seat 5 to 6 people at a time. They have a live bakery where you can see what are they baking and the art of making a cake, specially the smell of freshly baked cakes is a crowd pleaser. 
I had a red velvet cake, a chocolate brownie from Mambo's, I wish they served the hot brownie with an icecream or at least chocolate sauce but there's no such option, it was pretty dry and choking my throat. The red velvet cake was pretty decent though it needed to be set for tad bit longer. Prices are very reasonable it costed only RS. 155 for the whole deal. They have lot of cupcakes, designed chocolates also they make customised cakes. The lady in the shop is very friendly and made us comfortable. 
One thing I would like to request, when you have a live kitchen/bakery going on make sure you make it a bit hygienic, for example the person making the cakes was not wearing those plastic gloves which is something, some people like me don't appreciate. 
To sum it up if you are craving for something sweet, if it is cakes then you know where to go if you are in golpark!

Just ordered Plain Cake slice through Zomato. The delivery was prompt. Priced at Rs 30 each, the cake tasted good and was baked to perfection. Would love to order again from this outlet and try out their cupcakes.

Cupcake and another sliced cake (can't remember the name)were really bad.The only saving grace was the chocolate spoon.They should really focus and know what they are serving.

The location and decor of the place is beautiful,the staff is extremely friendly;but unfortunately the chocolate mudpie that I bought for a takeaway was disappointing to say the least,i have had chocolate mudpies leaps and bounds better than this one,the sheer size of it was impressive but unfortunately taste wise it was a huge disappointment.

So today I ordered MUD CAKE and it's suppose to be your speciality. Firstly delivery was so late and it came after the estimated time when I nearly cancelled it. Never mind. 
Next the cake. 
Looks: It looked great. Looked tasty and mouth watering.
Product quality:But it wasn't fresh at all. It wasn't soft as well. Even if the cake was good the frosting sucked. 
Taste: like I said it wasn't fresh. So it tasted worse. 
      Please improve yourself and when you can't reach on time at least try selling good products. 
Worst experience ever. 
Please improve.

Ventured this place today. Parking is a bit of problem in this busy lane, I walked all the way just to try it.
The atmosphere is very positive. You feel elated as soon as you went inside. Nice seats. Decoration is off the mark so pleasing to the eye.
The staff is a friendly young man ready to serve. I took one Arabic busbusa which tasted like our indigenous sooji cake. I also tasted red velvet shake which was heaven.
Price is a bit steep.

Had a really bad experience with a very watery and rancid pannacotta...it had not set properly and had an unpleasant kick that would have a really bad aftertaste if you're in after a good palatable meal....i know it's mambo's receipe but you have to please the senses when it comes to dessert...no matter how unique your pallate is.

The outlet is very close to my home. In fact, it looks cozy with the pinkish decor. Never been inside before. Ordered Chicken patties and Chicken envelope through Zomato. They are packed in decent looking large boxes and real surprise awaited me when I opened the packet. The size of the envelopes were huge and tasted great. The patties looked good but I felt that the inside of the patties was a bit too Indianized. Anyway, I was really impressed by the size and taste and would love to order again some day soon.

There are some spellbinding pastries and Mocktails here. The ambiance is also on point. But then they have limited space to accommodate people.

Last night we had visited this new bekar bakery shop near my place. Such a cute shop with all pinkish & white decoration üòç.
But food quality was not so good.  We had ordered a chocolate mud cake which came up for 100 bucks & it's quality like not praiseworth & other one was Oreo shake (it's too worst) came up for 99 bucks , could have been better testing. 
It's a new shop & I think it can do wonders üòäüòä

Ordered cupcakes for someone's birthday. Apart from the fact that they look awesome the owner was sweet enough to also put in the effort to make little additions for the birthday-person. I have had pastries over here earlier. Their flavours are good.

This place is a newly opened cosy joint a few minute walk away from the golpark momo I am..a nice decorated cake shop with a much welcoming staff.
We had the chocolate mud cake which came up for 100bucks and it was worth each penny we paid.
We also longed for some more desserts but it was quite late.. around 10:30pm..and the were out of their stocks..and though there were other varients of cupcakes we carved for something chocolaty so didn't go for more choices..but would surely drop in for some desserts!!

Mambo's Recipe is a such a cute shop with all pinkish and white decor. A must visit for all the cupcake lovers. Situated at Golpark, opposite to Momo I am.
Staff was very welcoming and well behaved. 
I just tried a cupcake (forgot the name) but the icing wasn't upto the mark. Overall the taste was good.

Keep up the good work.

The ambience and the interiors are very cute and nice!It's a small shop but very welcoming!
But I was disappointed with the red velvet cake it was just not up to the mark for the price!
The Chocolate cupcake was moist and good the icing could have been better tasting!
It's a new shop and I think it  can do wonders but the quality and quantity should be better!‚ò∫
