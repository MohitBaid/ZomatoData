I am a Medical Doctor & an International Foodie from Kolkata. I order food daily from many restaurants in and around Salt Lake City to pamper my taste buds. I am very selective about everything as far as food is concerned. Mom‚Äôs Kitchen is one of the very few restaurants that has got into my list. I have been having their food from last one month and now I feel it is time to write a review. I would simply say if you are really looking for authentic tasteful and healthy food just go for Mom‚Äôs Kitchen...my top picks are chicken tikka butter masala, chicken reshmi butter masala, egg biriyani, peas pulao, naan, mixed hakka noddles, chilli chicken dry. Taste & Quantity wise they are the best üëå
Really am in love with their food. A must try for all üôèüòä

We have a pathetic experience in MoM's Kitchen today. Trust me, they used to serve out dated foods , mostly on veg section. 

We have ordered Veg thali, that cost around 100 rupees. It has one item , with kabuli channa... it smell like hell. Bitter in taste. We asked to replace, but the Manager don't. Even he behave like nothing happened. 

It is really pathetic to have this type of food here. Will never recommended anyone to be there. We are sure ,to be have stomach issue, if we have this lunch today. Thanks god save us today.

This is located near Chingrighata more and based on the reviews from Zomato we ordered food for your office night during the wee hours of a Saturday night. 
* Ordering was a breeze thanks to Zomato. 
* Packaging: Just enough packaging.
* Delivery: Delivery time was average. We had ordered 4 dishes, took roughly 40 minutes. Food was delivered hot. 
* Food: We were there and had ordered Chinese after reading some (misleading) reviews. 
1. CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES: Tasted a notch better from the ones available in fast food joints. Portion of chicken seemed less. 
2. MIXED HAKKA NOODLES: No Chinese flavour in the noodles. The prawns were fried with turmeric looked tacky. Portion was decent though.
3. MIXED FRIED RICE: The apparently Chinese item had rose water fragrance and taste. The cook was clearly confused during the preparation. Protein was but was drier then normal. 
4. GARLIC CHICKEN: Disappointing. After trying the noodles I had anticipated that they'd get the easiest (Chinese) main course to the point. But to my surprise it was sweet af. The chicken had a thick coating of floor but I mustn't ignore to mention that the chicken was very soft and melted away in the mouth. 

I had expected better stuff from the joint. I hope that the further order (strictly Indian stuff) would mitigate this not so good experience.

Went in for dinner. Ordered a chicken tikka kebab as starters and went for the regular chicken do pyaza for main course, alomg with indian breads.
The Tikka kebab was quite good. Chicken was soft and tender, perfectly cooked for the kebab. Tasted great in mouth. But unfortunately they served only one food plate.
For the main course, the tandoori butter roti was ok, but wasn't the same for the chicken do pyaza. The pieces of chicken were not well tender and didn't taste very good.

Ordered food from here today and loved it. The Biriyani is a little on the heavier side and could use a little better dum treatment which incidentally would ensure that more of the spices enter the potato which could soak some of the extra oil that remains at the bottom of the handi. Loved the mutton keema which I believe was the highlight of the meal, lightly spiced but again a bit heavy on the oil instead of mutton fat (which can substantially replace the lost quantity of vegetable oil in a dish) and the chicken bharta was again a great basic dish cooked here. The service is exceptional in matters of punctuality and customer rapport. All in all, loved the place. 19.10.2017 Ordered the Biriyani again and loved it today. Perfect cook on the mutton and the potatoes.
