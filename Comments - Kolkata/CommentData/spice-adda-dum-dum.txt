This is one of the very few places which deliver food very late in the night till 3 pm. I had ordered chilli baby corn and schezwan chicken dry at around. The food came around 2 15 which was alright given that there distance was quite far. Now the food was not really great, just average and the oil used could have been better. But I am sure they can do better. Hope to order again when hunger calls dead at night.

Read a lot in Zomato regarding this restaurant's food quality. Believing that reviews one day I went to this restaurant with a friend. We ordered lachcha paratha, chicken korma & chicken bharta. What I felt after taking some bites of the food items was completely opposite of the zomato ratings! The lachcha parathas were totally drenched with oil! Anybody easily could get a cup of oil by compressing the parathas! Next, the chicken items. I don't know from which date chicken bharta became chicken korma!! Those two items were more or less similar in taste! Our order cost Rs. 250 & that Rs. 250 went in vain! I have given 1.5 rating because quantity was enough but not the taste!

Most happening food joint now in Kolkata, they have their hotels throughout India and now started food chain in Kolkata. I came to know from my best pal ( Rajesh ) and indeed their biriyani is the best now in kolkata. I would rather correct it that its the best and the largest in quantity - 2 pieces of mutton with egg in mutton biriyani and same with chicken and as per their challenge they really serve without cheap vanaspati and proper good oil later felled.I wish all my friends and co kolkatians to taste the best from them

This place is best for the guy like me. They start their service from 6Pm and continue up to 3.30am. I am trying to find places like these. They serve fast and makes home delivery without any charge. I have ordered Mixed fried rice with crispy chili baby corn at 2.30am. They just took 35 minutes to deliver. That's cool as this place is not near from my house. This place gives us a large quantity in every order with great taste. This place just touched my mind. I have no hesitation to be a permanent customer for this restaurant. Big like.
