Ordered Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Chaap and Rumali Roti via Swiggy. The prices are cheap but the food here is just horrible. Chicken was completely Raw and I had to eventually throw it in the Dustbin. Total waste of money. Not recommended at all.

Your everyday roadside food joint. Located near pantaloons. The prices are reasonable and the food in question is more than what you ask for

Located just beside pantaloons in the same footpath. Doesn't have proper seating arrangements. Looking for good food you can check this out. Makes delicious haryali kababs and rolls. The price is just like any other roadside stall.

Another road side fastfood corner. Prices are perfect. If you have low budget and want some delicious to eat go for this restaurant. Though there packaging is worst. But love their food.

Beside the building that houses TBZ jewellery, lies this small eatery, beneath. The variety of the food might be limited, but the variety of the cockroaches that serve you whilst you're there is vast. It should be named HNS food & cockroach corner. We ordered two fried rice half for two, the portion was decent for one, the quality of the rice in the fried rice is below average, the taste of the dish was okay. The low rating is due to the poor hygiene & prehistoric organisms that adore you!

Tried both chinese and north Indian food from this place via home delivery.The place is cheap but the food reflects that.The chinese gravies are aweful.The chicken pieces are hard as rock.The noodles was very oily and salty.On the other hand the chicken tandoori they served was burnt completely.Not going back to this place for food.

All the items were really impressive and delicious that we ordered from this place. It was above our expectation. We ordered egg rolls, mixed Hakka chow, mixed fried rice and chilli chicken & all the items were too good. The chow and rice were full of chicken and prawn and the chilli chicken was really spicy with 8pcs of boneless chicken. The quantity was also very good and the food was delivered within 40mins.

absolute crime. i had heard the rolls were good. but i think i must have heard about some other place because the mutton rolls i received were horrible. waste of money. we threw them away. the mutton tasted like nothing. it seemed we were eating cardboard. no sauce in the rolls also. just a lot of onions. onion extravaganza. the paratha was small and thin. recommend avoid this trashy place.

Where do i start...i read favorable reviews on zomato about the rolls of this place. Pleasantly disappointed. 

1. roll size was small as compared to other places. 2. no sauce or minimum sauce given in our 3 rolls.3. we ordered mutton roll. very low amount of mutton. i know mutton is pricey. but the amount given is ridiculous. (8 small pieces between the 3)I have nothing against this place mind you, and this was the first time i had ordered. 150 rupees down the drain. All the reviews are 2 - 3 months back. maybe the place was good then. now its just awful.Try any other place. I Recommend YOU SKIP THIS PLACE. DON'T CONTACT ME. I WILL NOT CHANGE MY REVIEW.

The Paneer Roll here is quite good . Next to Saima at Exide. Staff behaviour good. A good place to have a quick bite though you may find it a bit unhygenic and I have seen them use the same oil again and again.

The chicken momo.....just love it. ₹60 for 6. I am a regular here. Chicken momo is a must try. The sauce that comes with it leaves one salivating. Overall it is just amazing.

Wonderful sandwiches and good rolls. Good lassie as well. Do not waste your time time and money at the food court at Pantaloons, Kankurgachi this place is real value for money. Had the best egg sandwiches here.

No words to define their food quality. They provide good foods at pocket friendly rates n over that the quantity is sufficient for one. For me its was must during my school time while returning home from school.

It is one of me & my frnds' college time fav. food joint. Its a small take away fast food center located near Kakurgachi Pantaloons & TBZ jewellary shop.
Its mainly a take away corner but they also have lil tools to sit & eat.
Don't know why but me & my frnds call this place 'Fast food' :p
And for any small treat,we came here.The mixed rice,rolls are just fatafati.... Though its a small place,but the quality of the food is very good!

Egg chicken roll of 50 bucks had only one small piece of chicken. And not tasty either. Had to try there as it is beside Suraksha Polyclinic (MRI facility). Don't know about other items though.

This is the perfect neighborhood stop when one is hungry and in the mood of a take away. This small outlet does not have any dining facility. It was mainly started as a Roll shop. One can go for its steamy momos.. the typical Calcutta roll..or for other snack type / finger food items. I personally like the biriyani here a lot and often get it packed for home. The biriyani here is on the lighter side and its quality and quantity both suits me well.

Happy eating!

It's a nice place for rolls and momo. Nothing fancy. It's your typical neighborhood roll shop. The owner pays attention to detail. The food is always good. And clean.
