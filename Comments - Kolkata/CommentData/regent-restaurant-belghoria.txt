It's in my locality. Visited the restaurant on numerous occasions. Taste is a subjective matter. But one must try the fish finger here. Normally we all are quite aware of the fact that most of the restaurants don't serve u fish fry made of original bhetki. Some of them openly declare that it's basha fish. But this restaurant is an exception.

Other items are of so so nature. Nothing special. Never order a tandoori chicken here. You may have a cardiac arrest seeing the size of the chicken pieces served in the tandoori at that price.

They have various good seating options. An outside lawn, an air conditioned space and an air conditioned family and couple space.

Overall I would term it as a good restaurant and Bar as compared to other restaurants in this locality.

Only good thing here is space and atmosphere. 
Food is really waste. 
The thing that most annoying is the Staff behaviour,. Very rude... 
Ordered vodka, Whiskey, but god knows what they gave to us. It seemed that they piled them with low quality liquor. 
Only reason to go thr is that there is no family bar in vicinity of the place. But don't order premium quality drinks. Order minimal food and lower grade drinks.

We visited the place few days back. We had 1 bottle of Tuborg strong beer, fish finger and tandoori chicken as the starters. Food was really good. Loved the ambience. A nice bar cum Restaurant in the suburbs of Kolkata. I can say that it is the place which can satisfy your evening time cravings for food

Deciding between the landscaped outdoor seating and moderately decorated interior is the first beautiful dilemma everyone faces here. The food can be rated quite well in the Chinese Cuisine domain. If breaking in with a big fun gang pre-reservation is preferred.

Worst services, contaminated food & zero hospitality. I'll rather drive 5 Kms Up and Down on B.T Road than wasting my time in there. The service persons don't have the etiquette to handle guests; that's what happens when you keep low graded staffs to earn some business out there. Won't recommend even if you are in a hurry to dine out.

It was a very bad resturant . We ordered our seats two days ago. We , 12 of us , visited today . We were not given a space to sit. Still we arranged for a table. It was very dirty eveywhere . When we went to sit . We saw bottles of drinks everywhere . It was very bad behaviour by the staffs. The butter nun were fried in white oil. We asked for mutton korma and they gave us chicken korma. The quantity of ice creams were less.And it was very costly. 

Really , I had a really bad day off.

Regent restaurant is situated at BT road, opposite of the maruti show room of Kamarhati. Me and my would be hubby visited here in 2015 & will not go there further. The ambience of the restaurant is good. Outdoor seating is also available. But the waiters decide where you will seat. It is too bad. The food quality is not good also.Here ordered mutton biryani.It does not taste good. Mutton pieces are so hard and didn't satisfied us. Also the price is not reasonable. Overall, I don't like it.

Hakka noodles,chicken manchurian are also tasty.But biriyani is average.. moctails such as mexican sun rise and virgin blue lagoon are very refreshing.. but I think foods are overpriced compared to quantity and quality and service guys are not friendly at all..

Located on the barrackpore trunk road in belghoria, this restaurant is well crowded and a den for foodies and beeristas. There are many varieties of food and beverages on stall and you will receive a good enough service. Seating area also present in lawn is truly a cherishable preference for people to hang-out. Pocket pinch is bit on the highside.

Pathetic service.Was there with my wife & 3 friends with 3 more about to reach.We asked for the family zone & they kept on reiterating "how many people r u?" We waited & asked for orders & they kept ignoring. Till they said "untill u r 6 people with 3 girls, we wont serve".We asked repeatedly to take our orders & they refused! After 30 long minutes we left without any. Manager was not worried at all.Being in a service sector today it seemed exemplary of a place where u dont wanna be.My rating is 1 because it could not be a negative figure. One pathetic restaurant who dont khonw what or why they belong.

Regent restaurant cum bar is located at Belgharia which mainly serves Indian & Chinese cuisines along with drinks at an affordable price.

Ambience is relaxing with nice sitting arrangenents.

Service is slow.

Tried Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chaap & Green Salad. Biriyani was average in taste, though quantity was nice. Meat pieces were not so tender . Chicken Chaap was nicely made.

The foods are good - both Indian and Chinese cuisine, however the standard varies Â sometimes. If you're looking for a nice drink, this is the place to go in this area! They server good drinks at affordable prices. Â The waiters are all very friendly they will greet you every moment with smile on their face.

Went there so many times because, cleary we had very less options to choose from.. recently went there after quite a long time.. it was 31st night.. the ambience was fine.. we ordered some drinks along with a plate of fish fry. The starter was nice.. then 
For the main course, ordered some mixed schezwan rice, chili chicken, mutton biriyani, butter nun and chicken tikka masala... The food was average.. I didn't like the biriyani at all.. the signature aroma of the biriyani wasn't there at all.. the rice and chickn was fine.. talking about the rice, it was just some extra spicy chinese rice, not schezwan.. bt the indian foods i.e. nun and chickn tikka masala were better than the rest... Fine service bt they are a bit slow... Overall just an average place to go for..

Loads of nostalgic memories popping up when I am writing a review of this restaurant.Â 
My grads was from a college in this area and thus we used to visit this place frequently. Be it a birthday celebration or just a normal get together, Regent was a preferred option. The food is nothing to talk about over here, as good as normal eateries or joints. However, the alcohol was cheap over here and thus it was never a burden for us.

If you have enough time to sit and relish your dishes one by one this one is the perfect place for you and within reasonable range. The outdoor sitting arrangement in small coupes would add a different flavour to your dishes I'm sure of that. And try tandoor and north Indian items rather than chinese.

This place is located near Kamarhati crossing on B.T. Road. One thing that attracts me a lot about this place is its outdoor seating arrangement. I should mention here that it wouldn't be appropriate to go for outdoor seats during the summer time.
The indoor ambiance of the restaurant is also pretty good. Staffs are well behaved and their service quality is also commendable. I wouldn't say food quality is excellent but it's good. Last time when I went there it was almost one year ago, at that time I did not find their items to be overpriced.

With nice ambiance, spacious interior and good food, Regent was a good option once when I visited it with couple of relatives. Though I don't exactly remember the names, we'd ordered mixed fried rice, butter naan, chicken rezala and some other chicken preparation. We'd enjoyed the food for it'd been quite tasty. A humble restaurant without much decorous froufrou that makes one feel like a regent presiding over royal delicacies for a few good moments.

Lets put it this way... You aren't exactly spoiled for choice when you are looking to go to a decent restaurant and you are on BT Road. Given this was the closest restaurant to my location, I decided to check it out for lunch yesterday.Â 
The place was quiet and a few folks were in, having their mid-day beers. The first cue that it was going to be an experience to forget was that the lights were out and it was really dark in there. The staff tried to shepherd us towards a dark corner of the restaurant. We took a seat near one of the windows just as we were not sitting in darkness.
Apprehensive from the start, we decided not to test the deep waters and asked the waiter which would be their best starters in non-veg. The Chicken Lasooni Kebab was half decent, but the Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish was below par - the tempura batter was too thick and as a result, the dish tasted floury.
The one Mutton Biriyani we order surprised us even more. With the first bite, you could smell the scent of uncooked ghee, and to round things off, one of the mutton pieces was actually covered in gravy - as if it had been taken up from a different dish and mixed with the biriyani.
To top off your misery, they charge you 1.25% extra if you decide to pay by card. Who does that now a days?
Overall, it was one of the worst food experiences I have had in a while, and the only reason this doesn't get a 1/5 rating is becuase the Chicken Lasooni Kebab was half decent.
I would strictly recommend avoiding this place unless you want to absolutely waste your money.

Overpriced! Overhyped! Overpriced!Â Average service! Overpriced!No I have not repeated anything. Been there 3 times. Had something either over or undercooked every time. Service can be a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it takes too long to serve something. The price for what is served is astronomical. Especially for the location (Kamarhati). One seriously doesn't expect to pay that kind of money in a restaurant in that part of the city (panihati, Kamarhati, etc). Having said all that, take some like minded friends there for a few drinks and the ambience can actually be pleasant. So may be stick to your drinks and snacks if you don't want to take a risk.

A vast lawn, lots of sitting arrangement in the outside as well as well decorated interior. I have visited this place numerous times since this is in my locality. We usually have drinks with chilli pepper chicken and roasted tandoori chicken. In the main course, butter nun with chicken bharta or chili garlic chicken serves good. Though food quality is quite impressive, service is a bit unorganized. Sometimes u may get your bill first then your cold coffee or cold drinks after dinner. The floor manager keeps asking to the customers whether their orders have reached to table or not! Anyway, its overall performance keeps it going in Kamarhati area without any competition.

This place has a lovely ambience... Good during world cups as they show live matches... The food is as good as the ambience... Chinese food is their speciality.. Another interesting thing is small green board which is at the entrance and to see whats written u hav to visit the restaurant...

I find the food tasty. Prices are reasonable. Dining is average. But in my opinion the overall servicing is the point which connects the customer to the restaurant and it is lower than average. But one can find a more varieties here. If you can bring some extra light with you as you will need it.

Been here on last Monday evening (08.03.2015) for having couple of drinks after office hours with a friend. The restaurant has a vast lawn and we were offered a seat at a corner. The place was awfully low lit ( Visibility was such low that had to use mobile flash light to distinguish between salt and pepper). The staffs are highly unprofessional. After having my whiskey on the table had to wait for around 10 minutes to get soda and ice cubes ( includes two reminders from me) . Food is average . Ordered crispy chilli baby corn, chicken lollypop and chicken 65. Chicken 65 was best of the lot as rest of the two were very much oily and tasted somewhat abnormal to me. The crowd is also not the type which I liked. There was a birthday celebration going on and they were screaming and hooting at will and there were none to stop them. Some people started dancing on the lawn ( nagin dance). Nobody cared how other customers may feel. Now the joke of the day we got while paying the bill. We opted to pay via debit card and while returning the card the waiter literally asked for some tips !! Yes he asked for it  !! (" sir kichu diye jaben") the experience was not very much enjoyable and I will certainly never return there .

On this New year eve,I had my dinner with my family.... The food was really delicious and tasty....I had ordered for Chicken tandoori...It was really tasty soft and juicy and then called for Prawn tandoori,although we had to wait for sometime due to the rush but it was worthy....The prawns were tender, juicy, flavourful and aswsome in taste.... Then the Resturant manager insisted us to order a 31st night special dish "Prawn Lasses" and it tasted heavenly..... All this made our last dinner of 2014 memorable....

Very good and crowded restaurant cum bar nearby kamarhatty. In this area hard to find a best place for dine in. So regent is the king of this area and serving best from past few years. I have visited long time ago but writing this review after very long time but its true that they are very good at this place no doubt about that.

This place is not for the people who loves to enjoy the food and alcohol on the basis of quality.If you want to drink whatever comes with anything they offer as food then it is a great place.Don't come here with your friends and family.

This place is near my home. I once ate from this place. It was reshmi kebab, chicken kasha and butter nun. Kasha was okay but the kebab was stiff and the nun was hard to break. 
Ambience is good but foods not really up to the mark.

Regent.. Its food quality is good,  but could be more great. Services are great.  Very spacious.  But not to mention its lil pricy.  But they hv some of the great bar.  In the area. But the foods are allover somehow lil oily.  Personally i dislike oily food. Thats why i dont like the much.  Mainly the place is more or less drinking place.  But would have been much great if they care fr food more

Ambiance wise the place is okay-ish, inside the restaurant there's a nice big lawn where you can have your food. We were very hungry, so I ordered â€˜Mutton Biryaniâ€™, â€˜Chicken Bhartaâ€™ and â€˜Green Saladâ€™. Mutton biryani they served is at least two days old and an odd smell coming from it. When we told the issue to the waiter he just ignores the matter. Chicken Bharta tasted good but we already lost our appetite and one of my friend found it very difficult to finish the biryani. The service is very poor the waiters donâ€™t know certain basics of waiting on tables rather clumsy I would say. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

A well decorated restaurant-cum-bar with a vast area, outdoor sitting facility (you can smoke there) and Family room. Food at the restaurant is not up to the mark, and drinks costs low.  

Service is not so good, but they let you enjoy your food/drinks and are in no hurry to feed you or to bring the cheque.

If you want to go to this restaurant, go there for the ambience and low cost, but that is basically all.

this restaurant and bar has a huge space,a vast lawn with outdoor sitting facility and also has a family segment.
 at the entrance its written -people wearing lungis are not allowed-.
though the family part remain closed through out the day and you cannot sit at the lawn due to intense attack from mosquitoes still you can use the 7tables available.
beware of the substandard crowd and the undaunted ignorant waiters. the food quality is ok and all of the gravy and curry items taste the same.
i will rate them 2 because it has a low price for drinks and .5 because it doesnt lungi wearing drunkards n also they have security at the parking.

Regent.....restaurant....cum bar....is situated near Kamarhati...looks just like a 3-star dhaba.....and once you get inside you will feel its spacious, well-decorated and indeed a good place to eat.....until food arrives, and bangs your mindset to take a set-back!!! There's a nice lawn here where you can have your food. I was there to eat lunch...and found it is not at all a good place to eat. Food is far from being delicious....content is very meager...and waiters are very reluctant to do what they are meant for. Eat at your own risk.

No disrespect, but this is just what it feels like to eat in the suburbs. Below standard staff behavior, below standard crowd, below standard experience, no ambiance except what your fork and spoon creates!

You might want to visit this place only in times of desperation.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. But the only reason I gave it two stars is because the food is edible. Enough said!
