Ever since I joined court, "The Little Place" has been almost a regular joint for evening bites and lunch at times. 
Since its very near to my workplace, we opt for the delivery option. So didn't get the chance for dine-in yet.
Now, the food they serve is too good! Too good and I mean it!!
I have tried almost all the items from the menu. Hakka noodles, rice items, chicken, fish and momos (especially the pan fried ones) are lipsmacking good!! Gravy chow is a bit bland, but tasty. All items are authentic and well prepared served in good portions.
Service is quick and the food served is piping hot always. 
To sum up, this is the perfect example of "sostae pustikor".

This Chinese eatery serves tasty and hygienic foods.Price is reasonable enough compared to other Chinese restaurants.Located at one of the busiest roads of Kolkata most of the time it remains crowded.It has also got combo meal offers at lunch time.Lastly nobody would be complaining after a visit.

This is a  well known outlet for the office goers in the Dalhousie area though others have little knowledge of it . Space is very cramped & there is not much to talk about the ambience. But they provide food at a very reasonable cost . Their lunch pack is very attractive & sufficient . Today visited here for a chicken roll . The paratha was good but the stuffing was somewhat cold & was quite disappointed with it . Apart from today had nice experience on my previous visits .

When hungry inn office and pocket in thin, this is the ultimate place. A small joint but great food. We have been ordering from this place in office (Dalhousie) n amazing Chinese food it is. They have a Thali style combo for Chinese only for delivery purpose. 130 cost n u get a good amount of chicken fried rice(amazing taste) , 4 pcs of chili chicken and 2 chicken steamed momo. The food is packed in use n throw plate covered with plastic wrap. Ketchup vinegar and plastic spoon. Prefect to eat at office. Food is fresh and hot and served u well when hungry. Must mention their service. Class apart service. If they say it would take half an hour then it is exactly gonna be half an hour. We have ordered in twice and never have they failed in their delivery timing. Other than combo the alone foods are good add well. Piping hot food. Normal noodles may seem a little blunt in taste but order a schzwan or something like that it's tasty.

** Location = Located at Kiran Shankar Roy Road, very near to Calcutta High Court and City Civil Court.

** Brief = Being close to my workplace I am almost aregular visitor of this place. Only Cash and 

** Ambiance = A good takeaway joint, but they have a seating capacity on the 1st floor of about 20 people. But it is very very small and sleek and you are bound to be cramped for space. The servers are real quick in their delivery(in your chambers).

** Things tried = I have tried their momos, chicken rice, chilly chicken,schezwan rice,egg chicken chow and the lunch combos.

All the dishes are prepared nicely and served hot, packaging is also decent in case of deliveries.

** Recommended = Chicken Rice Combo. A great deal in just Rs.125/-

** Purse Check = Rs.250-300/- would be enough for 2 people.

** Overall = Its like a savior during a tiring and hungry afternoon :D

The place is really LITTLE but the food is awsome! Specially there momos and thupa.
Had ordered a lunch platter which had chicken fried rice, chili chicken and momo. It was superb. The quantity is enough for one person and the flood tasted very good.

The place Is literally "Little" and yet when it comes to Thai, Tibetan and Chinese, it's one of the best places to eat. I often grab quick lunches here, being right adjacent to my work place. It never disappoints and I can vouch it's truly amazing. The service deserves a special mention being beyond expectation for what seems like a small eatery.

As the name suggests...this place is actually small & very difficult to adjust..
But they served nice food & this is damn cheap so it is a better place for office ppl at dalhousie or a home delivery cause it is total pocket-worthy but not for a proper dinner maybe.

I went over this little place a few days back after reading about it in Zomato. Location - After you cross the Yellow Straw shop and the court crossing you will find this small food joint. Appearance - Indeed it justifies the name it holds. A small passage leading to an iron stairs will take you to 1st floor of this small food shop. Tables and chairs are small but if you are a thin person you won,t find much problem.Food and Service - I ordered just two chicken sandwiches ( parcel ). The service guy who spoke less and took my order , received the money and told me to wait. After 15 minutes he came back with two chicken sandwiches in two boxes. Taste - The chicken sandwich I ordered was without cheese and so I could feel the taste of the sandwich much better, The bread had good toasted crust and the filling of the sandwich was tasty. It was well packed with some potatoe chips. However the quality of the sauce was disappointing and If the sauce came of a little better quality it would be more nice. Looking forward to try the maincourse dishes from here.Overall - This place is worth visiting and I am sure other dishes will taste as good as the little snack I had in Little Place.

High court is a very busy area.... calcutta's one of the oldest and most crowded place u can look for...  so, does a busy place need a food hub cheaper and tastier?? Yes it does...and little place is just the joint... as its name suggests it is rather with congested or simply "LITTLE" ... but do not go with the size of the restaurant coz he food here served is a marvel..... little special non-veg chopsuey, an typical chinese lunch pack, and pepper chicken... i could just feel its taste while writing this review... so..... where will you drop in when you are in the legal zone of calcutta... its... " THE LITTLE PLACE"...

Indeed a small little place in the office para. Now I know the reason why people of the office para do not go beyond their realms. The sole answer would be. There are too many good restaurants which serve amazing food. And the little place is one such wonder place.

This is just located near the high Court , the Secretariat.  One walks straight towards great eatsern and there stands this joint on thr right side, it is nearly unnoticeable,  but one needs to be careful. On entering an iron staircase leads you to the first floor. 

This is a superb crampy place with hardly 16 seats fitted in through a narrow passage. They specialise in chinese and tibetian. 
Heard their pan fried momos are heavenly,  so tried their
Chicken pan fried momos. .indeed it was heavenly. it was fried to perfection and the sauce that they put was just too amazing and the momos were tasty as never and it just melted in the mouth. 

The next order had to be noodles, since the portion of the noodles that they were serving was too huge for me to finish off, I went in for their thukpa. Well I assumed it was going to be just average. But when it arrived, the portion of chicken thukpa was huge. The first sip of the soup made me feel that this was heavenly. I wish it just did not stop and went on and on. It is truly a recommended dish indeed.

Well the total bill was 150 rupees and such great food at this meagre rate is unbelievably true. A must try for everyone.
The little place surely deserves to be celebrated :)

It's a decent roadside joint where you get passable Chinese food and rolls...
The place is nothing fantastic but the food is decent for a lunch in court... Nothing more...
They have a lunch combo with mono.. Chilly chicken with rice or noodles at about 100 rupees... That's good value for money

The name of the restaurant truly resembles it's set-up. One has to climb up the high iron staricase in order to have a seat. There are very few tables (5-6). But it serves good Chinese dishes.. I had pan-fried chicken momos and it tasted wonderful. The service is average.

This truly 'LITTLE PLACE' has made my daily office-para-lunch so colorful that almost twice in a week I go there. They are tasty, pocket friendly, helpful, their take away combo meals are excellent, so as their dine in. Momos, Hakka noodles, chilli chicken are grand. Though it's bit tough to find out from road, but once u go in u will be addicted.

Truly little... just a small passage in a mezzanine floor.... you have to climb a very steep iron stair case to reach there... and its always ... seriously . They serve excellent Chinese cuisine... we frequently visit there. But its a non air conditioned one and extremely  hot and humid. They make excellent Momos... both the steamed one and pan fried one are mouth watering. Pan Fried Momo is a delicacy here. They serve good soup... good chowmein.. both hakka and gravy one. Their dry chilli chicken is simply divine.. with saute capsicum and big onion slices...ahhhhhaaa.

Another thing you must have is their dry chilli fish.... definitely the best in Kolkata.... yumm

Another of our regular haunts in the High Court area. The Little Place is actually little, its a hole in the wall leading up to a mezzanine floor. The place is very cramped, with some five tables with 20 small chairs thrown in, the place gets very crowded during the lunch hours, and that's because of the good food they serve. However, the place definitely needs an air-condition, during summers it becomes nothing less than a furnace in itself. Their chicken sweet corn soup is one of the best I have ever tried. The thai soup, the momos and the fried rice varieties are all good and filling. However, each chicken side dish comes with only 4 pieces of chicken. I would recommend increasing this to 6 at extra cost. Taste wise, the chicken dishes are pretty decent. Overall a good place for grabbing a quick lunch if you do not mind the heat. The staff is very friendly and courteous. A meal for two comes to around Rs. 300/-.
