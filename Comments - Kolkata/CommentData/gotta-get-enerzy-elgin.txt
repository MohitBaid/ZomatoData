Had a Mint Mojito while waiting for someone in the food court. 
I must not say it was upto the mark but it was not very different from a normal mint Mojito. The taste was average but the staff was really nice. I told him to add extra ice and he did very sweetly.

BAD juices. Why do you even sit at your outlet at the Forum food court. Request you to shut it down as soon as possible. I had ordered for a watermelon juice and a guava juice. Both of them were so bad that I had to throw them. No point in wasting customer's money when you cannot match the basic quality standards. Shameful and disgraceful.

This outlet makes decent pasta and very good shakes and mocktails. Tried the piña colada based, strawberry milkshake and mix sauce pasta in a few visits and really enjoyed the food. The milkshakes and mocktails are refreshing though I feel they are slightly overpriced for the portion served.
Overall the place is a good stop to grab a quencher or two
 
Recommended- strawberry and Mango milkshake.

This is a small kiosk located on the Food Court at the top floor of Forum Mall. It means to serve various stuffs but I mainly approached them for beverages.

I have had tried Mango Lassi and Fresh Lime Soda. Whilst the Lassi turns out good, the Lime Soda is not at all worthy of praise.

However, the person serving are extremely polite and even asks us to get ourselves seated when the drinks are prepared and personally serves us in the table.

You can pay a visit and judge them.

Gotta Get Enerzy is mainly a drinks/beverage outlet located inside Burp! Forum Mall. Last time I visited them was a long time back. I remember trying their Strawberry Shake. It was decent in taste. Service is fast and staff team is friendly.

Located at the Burp food court of Forum Mall this joint serves pasta, shakes and juices. 
We order Chocolate Shake and Green Mango Serbaat. 

Chocolate shake is very good and Green mango Serbaat has curd, jaljeera and Lemon. I find bad Taste on that.

Though I did not order for their signature fresh juices, what I did order for instead, was their baby-corn and mushroom pasta, and I was not disappointed. Though it tasted a bit tangy, the pasta was yummy and priced at Rs. 150 per plate, which seemed pretty decent, compared to the other items available at the Forum food court. Nice, small and clean outlet, and they serve pretty fast as well.

Gotta Get Enerzy deals in fruity drinks such as Milk Shakes, Juices, Smoothies etc. It's a good alternative to the usual fizzy beverages on a scorching hot day. The small corner joint is located just two stores from the left at the extreme corner of the food court in Forum Mall.

I wanted to try the Black Current Smoothie however it was not available, so asked for a Strawberry Milk Shake. It was quite descent and was far better than aerated drinks. Gave quite a relief to the throat after an hot meal in the food court.

Service was quite fast and the guy got the milkshake to the table where I was sitting. The milkshake was prepared in a snap. Pricing is a bit high, but that's okay considering that it's the only descent beverage shop in the food court.

Healthy,pricey and not very tasty.That's how this place can be described in short.Located in the Burp Food court of forum mall this place offers fresh fruit juices in various desired permutations and combinations,fresh vegetables,pastas and corn.The fruit juices are fresh and in general do not have any artificial flavour.The Tex Mex Corn salad is decent but in general the salads though healthy,I do not find them tasty enough.My mother prepares much much better and tastier healthy stuff at home.The prices are pretty high as is usual for any outlet at Forum.Overall this is not an outlet I like but one can give it a try if you are looking for something fresh and healthy.

One of the better and healthier alternatives to soda !!!

I am a lover of fresh fruit juices which is pretty decent here but they have a couple of very healthy juices too made from fruits plus vegetables that could be customised to your liking. A great attempt to serve you healthy stuff which does not taste bad. I wont say i love the taste of final product but passable given the benefits. Its a great option for people like me who are not so keen on soda. They have salads on offer too but yet to try them.

This outlet, situated adjacent to the soft drink outlet, is more diet friendly. The most visible is the display which has pastas, corn, freshly cut vegetables etc which you can mix and match to create salads. These are pretty nice if you can ensure they go easy with the dressing. I personally liked the Tex-Mex Corn Salad.

They have a range of juices, shakes, smoothies and chilled teas. I haven't tried these out, except once. Nothing exceptional, and then again if I wanted a Fresh Lime Soda, I would probably have it from next door, though prices seem the same now.
