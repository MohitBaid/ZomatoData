Nothing can be better than a quick bite of a dosa or idly or anything south Indian along with filter coffee to fill your hunger,  especially when very well prepared. 
This South Indian outlet located in the heart of Dalhousie area,  is situated on the street opposite to Writers building.  So for everyone working in the commercial hub of Kolkata,  this place offers good and well-prepared South Indian snacks for all office-goers. The service and behavior of the attendants is also worth mention

Items to go for : rava dosa,  Dahi wada,  meals

To early to judge for a first-time visit, but small and cozy place to get snacks in need. Went with family to try out the flavour of south Indian dishes. We had ordered masala dosa and it was crispy and tasty. Quality of sambar is good. We also had lassi in the end, thick and adequate in quantity. Looking forward to try out the others as well.

I usually take meals in this restaurant.
Before 4-5 yrs this restaurant food was authentic south Indian.
But in these days the staffs and food both are worse.
The water they will serve you tastes like a hand pump water and in a uncleaned glass of course.
If u are hungry then go otherwise avoid this restaurant

Service in afternoon is very very bad. There was only one man and the manager and I had to wait for 35 minutes for the thali. Food is not bad. Thali is quite good. But they add a little much chilly in sambhar vada.

Madras tiffin is located at Esplanade area, which mainly serves South Indian snacks, juices, shakes etc at a nominal rate.

Ambience is ok, crowdy with sitting arrangenents.

Service is prompt with nice staffs.

Tried Butter Sada dosa & Kulfi. Dosa was nice. Kulfi was enjoyable.

Overall a nice place to eat whenever one comes to New market area for shopping.

One of the most cheapest and best south Indian food outlet for office babus. There was time, I used to visit Birla Building very often and with little money in pocket I found Madras Tiffin the most exciting option. I had pulaw, rava dosa, pongal etc and all of them were of good taste and quality. I used to have hot coffee in old madras style i.e. in steel glass and the rava kasouri was just an excellent dessert I had.

Even I took my wife there for once just to let her taste pongal. The warmth of the people were heart filling and I was touched. The nostalgia of the place still calls me for a day but how unfortunate I am not to make another day.

After a shopping period in Esplanade,a visit in MADRAS TIFFIN for a food break is quite mandatory for me. My mother is also a fan of their southern dishes. We have tasted almost all the dishes here except the upma. They used to cater filter coffee before which is a past story now.
Let's come to the food point,their DOSA is a star in the menu card as you can have many varieties of it. UTTAPAM( coconut) is my personal fav. The sambar and chutney give the best accompaniment with the dishes.IDLI /SAMBAR BADA is not much good. You may try the DAHI BADA.,which is average.
At the end,LASSI is not a good choice,better to try KULFI FALUDA or the Syrup squash.

Pocket friendly south Indian food joint in busy esplanade area. Near to Esplanade metro, Lenin Sarani side.
Interior is very basic. You have to share table with others. Staffs are most of the times irritated probably because it's always busy.
I tried Idly, dosa and uttapam. Foods, though not so great, are good and value for money. Coconut chutney tasted good but taste of sambar varied: sometimes ok but other times runny and bland.

Well a saviour for south indians like me . 
In a city where meals are a rarity , madras meals at 40 bucks is killer . 
Its your everyday dhaba and food is really good for the price point . 
Ambience should not matter , its a dhaba .
The rasam is really good and if you want to have a fulfilling meal at a cheap price look no further . 
You have your winner . Do check it out

Age old joint..the decor is pretty ordinary..landed up there in a rain drenched afternoon..the waiter was way too busy to attend us...
We were refused cheese masala dosa...hence had to order an onion masala dosa..well..to be honest the dosa was plain and simple with the stuffing filled up generously..the coconut chutney was amazing..blended coconut with ginger and some other spices made it a heavenly lip smacking item..the sambar was rich and thick.. good enough
The chhola bhatura we ordered stood complwtely in the opposite pole..the bhaturas were not fluffy..hot to touch balls..the chhole was bland...and failed my taste buds..

It's hard not to miss Madras Tiffin when one's in the vicinity of Esplanade. A favorite haunt for some of my schoolmates, this place oddly gives me the vibe of an eatery in South India that offers tiffin-like snacks such as idli, dosa, vada, uttapam, upma etc. Food here is good, tasty and fulfilling. They also serve tea, coffee, fresh fruit juices, lassi and kulfi. For South Indian breakfasts and quick bites, this place can be added to one's food palette.

I just don't like South Indian food outside because what mom makes is much better than all of these. The idlis are hard and I don't like it. The dosas are decent, still the chutneys lack a flavour. It's good enough to satisfy people for their South Indian craving but not me as I get super delicious home made cooked food by mom!

Madras Tiffin as it sounds by the name is a south Indian fast food joint around the Metro theatre. The place is an authentic Esplanade style hot spot for a quick bite without any fuss. You don't get to see lush warm interiors and comfortable seating. What it offers instead is old school wooden chairs and tables with local fellows serving some good food.

Prices are not a concern when you are trying Esplanade fast food joints cause Madras Tiffin in particular is cheap by all standards.

Leave aside the hygiene part, the food is  absolutely "unhealthy". The interiors are bad. They follow the tradition of serving food in steel utensils , which are not even wiped properly.

This small but yet a influenctial joint is located in the esplanade area nearby metro cinema hall. It doesn't have as much of a decor. A simple medim sized outlet with decent and plain outlook. As the name "Madras Tiffin" suggests they serve authentic south indian delicacies. Ranging from wide varieties of dosas, idlis, utthapams etc. Along with that they also offers south indian thalis comprising of - rice, vegiies, daal, chutney etc;(cooked in authentic south indian style). Beverages like lassi, juices, cocktails, kulfis are also offered here. They serve the best south indian dishes with complete precision in the whole esplanade area in a reasonable rate. So if yiu are nearby and wanna go light on your stomach but still wanna enjoy a tasty meal then this is your more than perfect destination.

Location: Near Metro Cinema.

A small south indian joint located a few shops away from Metro Cinema is amongst the hidden gems of Kolkata which manages to serve delicious food.

A calm and soothing ambiance with a clean environment would surely uplift the mood of the forty heads which can be seated there.
Was at Esplanade for some work affairs along with my colleague when we happened to cross this joint and south indian being one of my weaknesses, I convinced him and simply hit the place!
Ordered the following:

Idli
Was soft but, cold. However, the taste was fine.

Vada
This too was cold, lacked the crispness and was quite oily too.
Disappointed.

Plain Dosa
Was delicious! Soft and decently sized.
Recommended.

- The coconut chutney tasted good but, was runny.
- The sambhar was too watery, but, had a decent flavor.

Lassi
This was the star of the whole experience.
Thick and sweet.
Highly recommended.

The service was prompt, and, the staff was friendly and polite.
A pocket friendly affair it would be.

Overall was an above-average experience.
- Revisiting soon, yet to try the remaining fare.

I have been to Madras Tiffin  quite a few times and I am happy to say that it is one of best choice in Esplanade area for Dosa, Idli, Juice, Lassi, Shake & Kulfi. Although I do not like the ambience here. It feels a little crampy if the restaurant is full. Today we are not in mood to try Dosa, so we just ordered Kulfi and Blackcurrant Milk Shake. We really enjoyed their Kulfi  and the Blackcurrant Shake. The prices of the dishes are very nominal. I definitely recommend this place for south Indian food lovers in Esplanade area.

Located close to the metro cinema hall in Kolkata and beside the exit point of esplande metro station you can easily spot this restaurant which specialises in only south Indian foods in snacks and platter meals as well.
It has been a very old place  in the eating scene of Kolkata as from child hood and every now and then whenever I visit new market I look forward in having their foods as i love the whole set up as inspite of being located in such a congested area due to the hawkers outside its a very different feeling once you get in here how it acts as a relief is magical after surpassing that crowded scene.

MY ORDERS ,THE AMBIANCE &EXPERIENCE -

Uncountable times since I have visited this place as a result I have almost tried the entire menu but what I usually stick to is the MASALA DOSAS and MASALA UTTAPUM as they are made out of perfection I feel  and apart from that  there is idlis,vadas ,uttapum ,sada dosa ,paper dosa ,onion dosa ,sambhar vada ,upma and then of course the south Indian lunch meals as well.
Coming to drinks and juices i always ordered FILTER COFFEE over anything over here as they make it in proper not only by name but by what's in it really is a real taste experience, however juices ranging from orange ,pineapple ,mosambi and grapes are also available and so is lassi and kulfis which is definetly a great listing in their menu to offer apart from coffee .

Talking about ambiance well I must reveal some truth that in my intial times when i used to come here I always saw baseless and absolutely no interior designing and seemed very normal as a restaurant with tables ,fans and chairs which was kind of boring then over the years it was shut for a month and renovation had been going on at that time and after it had got a make over the restaurant really was very eye catching with brown and creme colour false ceilings and interiors with wallpapers and wood crafted finishing and to add on well the regular tables & chairs were replaced with new nice and spacious ones definetly setting the whole environment very different from what it was .

Finally the service by the staffs was always very fast and efficient in terms of taking orders and getting the food pretty quick and also getting water as you sit and the tables used to get ready in a snap of a finger.
 Overall  its a very nice place to eat south Indian food with proper attentive staff and in a cool and bright environment around you .

Great food, good serving sizes, neat and clean surroundings, very reasonable prices, just not air conditioned.

Located near metro cinema hall, tried this place recently on the move and was surprised at the great experience. The place is big and spacious. The staff are very warm, polite and attentive. Cleanliness is maintained pretty well inspite of the ever continuing rush. 

Coming to food, upma tasted good but would prefer it without the turmeric overdose. The dosas were pretty well made with decent masala served alongside. The chutney was lovely and was served in good quantities which was the best part, moreover was being refilled pretty fast. The south indian thali do not have poori in it and only has plain steamed rice so dint appeal to me. The juice and cold coffee were good and actually great if i consider they were just priced at 25-30 bucks each. 

All in all, a great joint to satisfy your hunger if you are around !!

This is quite a good and affordable place to have south Indian food. On a sudden craving for idli, I decided to pay a visit to this place (i was also low on money). Ordered a plate of idli. It was served in no time. Simply cooked yet tasty. The coconut chutney was so well prepared that I asked for a refill. They were happy to serve. I was really satisfied and my pocket too.

If you are looking for some vegetarian restaurant and South Indian restaurant in the dharmatala are , this is a nice and cosy place . the coffee served is especially good. Fruit Juices are worth trying. Prices are pocket friendly. The food is hygienic. Nice place to visit after a film show at the Metro cinema.

Madras tiffin - a place near esplanade metro station.
---------
Brief: 
I'm sitting here while writing this review. As I was passing by here, I dropped in to try a juice. The decor is clean and place is hygienic. 
---------
Juice: 

Ordered pineapple juice - it costs 25 bucks and it's absolute value for money.  The crowd is generally of the decent side. However, the juice tastes like little mixed with water. It is ok. Generally, the south indian people come here to eat as far as my eye of observation noticed. 
----------

Summary: 
Ambience 3.5/5
Hygiene 4/5
Juice quantity 3.5/5
Juice quality 3.5/5
Value for money 4/5
