This kiosk is located in Russell Street , Park street area , selling Ghugni.

Service is quick but overpriced as the taste is nothing special, just regular taste like other Ghugni stalls.

The price should be reduced or special toppings should be added.

Ramji Ghugniwala is in front of Bombay Dying showroom in Russel Street. I had a plate of Ghugni here. The price shocked me at first, he charges Rs.40 for a small plate of Ghugni. Being a street seller Rs.40 seems big. Moreover his quality was very average. Nothing much to spend Rs.40 on.

This ghugni stall was situated in Russell street of park Street area in front of Bombay Dieying showroom. Not a good experience here cause price was very high and taste was lower average. Staff was friendly and service and fast. Serve ghugni only which was very basic. Simple ghugni nothing special but price was â‚¹40. Quality was good but quantity was less and taste was not good. Not recommended.
