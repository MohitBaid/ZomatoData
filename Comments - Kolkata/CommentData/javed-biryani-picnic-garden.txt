Came home with a packet of mutton biriyani from here... Nothing to say about the staffs, service and deco... it just a small unhygenic outlet below an apartment in the bylane of picnic gardens... smells good... mutton was well prepared... overall taste was ok... Pocket pinch was friendly...

I SUGGESTED THIS SHOP TO ZOMATO AND IT HAS BEEN ADDED.
As per its surroundings, this shop serves the best Chicken Biriyani at Rs.60 between Bondel Gate and Colony Bazaar.
Well behaved people. You can choose fine is as they do have tables inside but not air conditioned . Its a small shop.Mutton Biriyani is at Rs 70 which is also the cheapest in the locality and best too.
It's Rich and has a perfect blend of spices and fats. The quantity is enough for one's dinner unless she/he is a monster like me. I had 1 and a Half plate. In most shops you won't find egg Biriyani, but here they have it most of the time.
Ordered:
2 Chicken Biriyani (8/10)
2 Mutton Biriyani(8/10)

Both had a very good quantity of rice and the potatoes were perfect in size, well cooked and taste wise, commendable.
In one box, the mutton was a bit hard but the other was perfect. They had ran out of Mutton so they gave the mutton pieces from Chaap.
The Chicken was also, very well cooked , it was moist and soft and the spices had really got into it.
I've has here for more than 3 times and was never disappointed.
DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF BIRIYANI. KEEP GOBBLING.
