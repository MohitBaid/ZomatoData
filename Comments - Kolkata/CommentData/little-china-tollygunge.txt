This place used to be our 2nd home when i was a kid.
Located just near my place.
But as time changes, everything changes.
Now you can get a good meal..with a reasonable price but the quality and the taste is a bit different.
Much disappointed ðŸ˜£

Worst restro I have ever seen in my life , I didn't have options, & I went that horrible restaurant , and food was also horrible.

Sorry for the feedback , but it's really disappointing, Zomato should maintain their standard.

Disappointed !!

The food quality is pretty good at this food junction. The noodles and the side dishes are pretty good. The quality of the noodles were pretty decent to me. The chilli fish was also very good. The service was good overall, and my experience here was also decent. The rates aren't that high if we see the quality of food. Keep up the good work.

Though it is a very small place with only 3/4 tables to sit the food is quite good here..Old fashioned chicken fried rice& chili chicken are served quite well here..The price is reasonable...If you are a localite here you should have their food atleast once....

If you are expecting food, ambiance, service with in a budget, then this is not a place for you. The waiters are multi tasking and the service is somewhat average. The food however tastes good though I will not say that it is authentic. It is all about good 'indian chinese dishes' at affordable prices.

Came here on a saturday for lunch as I was very Hungry and needed a quiet place to sit n think about some issues that needed to be solved. 
The place is situated near UBI naktala. The place is a dingy one with very small seating place. The seats are wooden chairs and tables. 
The waiter is a coughing old man who doubles up as a vegetable chopper as well. Kinda makes u want to get up n go out . But was in the mood for chinese so thought of giving this place a try. Also for a place this shabby , the menu is quite extensive and elaborate.

As its a Saturday, I had ordered the HongKong Veg Noodles and the Hot Garlic vegetables.
They dont have any Pork items which is a dampner. 

The service is however ok and the quantity of food is sufficient. The taste is surprisingly wow in terms of the ambiance. U wont have a hint of the food tasting this good based on overall appearance of this eatery. But as they say Never judge a book by its cover. Pricing is very reasonable.

The rating is strictly based on the food. Nothing else is worth mentioning. Its worth visiting for a cheap budget chinese experience.

This is a very small eatery in the tollygunge area, near usha. It is a takeaway joint. Food is basically indo-chinese. It is more like a street food stall only with a sitting arragement. The food is really good here and prices are very less so you won't feel a pinch in your pocket.

A very old and one of the earliest Chinese restaurants in this area.. Good Chinese food at budget prices.. Recommended for takeaway.. I personally do not recommend seating there as the inside of the shack is a bit messy..

Fantastic place. Do try the chicken Peking fried rice and thousand rice. They are meals unto themselves... have tons of meat and a fried egg. I have been going here for a while and have rarely been disappointed.

little China is always one of my choiceful fast food center in reasonable budget . m little bit surprise that now a days also they used to provide better quality of chines fast food at comparable low price then other fast food center and restaurant. i must mention that interior of L. C. does not up to the mark but the test & quality they provide is really great n sufficient.

Ordered Mixed Gravy Noodles from Little China in Naktala, Kolkata for take away. 
They gave us 2 containers, one containing the plain boiled noodles and the other containing the gravy and instructed us to mix it when we want to eat

The moment we unpacked it, we realized that something was wrong/missing. But we still persisted

We mixed the contents and heated in the microwave. And we got this BLAND, DRY and TASTELESS dish.  Plain noodles with pieces of prawn and chicken. The gravy was totally NONEXISTENT!

Used to be a nice, family place but seems to have lost all the flavour now.

A very popular food point in one time, however the standard of this restaurant has fallen down in recent times! Still it offers great food in good quantities at a reasonable rate. The staff is also very friendly. The interior of the restaurant really needs a renovation. Try ordering from this place!

I've been a regular customer to this place since I was a kid, mainly because it's near my home. Though there are sitting arrangements, we always did take away. Our staple order was fried rice and chilli chicken. They used to make heavenly chilli chicken. :) Lately, however the quality and quantity of their food seemed to have dropped. After a long time, I ordered food from here, Chicken Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken. Service took about ten minutes. The food was not at all satisfactory. The chicken pieces in both the dishes were hard and chewy. The gravy of the garlic chicken was very bland. Not sure if I'll be visting this place again unless they make improvements.

This is an extremely cramped place - so do not think of eating here. A takeaway would be the best. 
The food however is very good. 
I've ordered their spring roll (the filling of noodles however lacked salt), chilli paneer dry and babycorn for starters. For the main course I usually stick to fried rice and keep on changing the side dish from manchurian to chilli vegetables to veg in hot garlic sauce. 
The chilli veggies however is my favorite. 

The quantity is huge and the prices are very reasonable too. Recommended for a takeaway.

The ala-carte section is at the back of the restuarant. A small dim place...perfect for couples surviving on love & pocket money.
Restuarant caters to both, little tangra and zeeshan customers. 
Food isnt that great but good if you consider the mughals marrying the Chinese.

food quality gone down dramatically. if u wanna try good chinese food, then this restaurant is not for u. its all happened because they dont have a good chinese cook. somehow the owner managing the home delivery order. menu prices also gone up. my advise, if u really dont have any other choice, u can try this restaurant.
