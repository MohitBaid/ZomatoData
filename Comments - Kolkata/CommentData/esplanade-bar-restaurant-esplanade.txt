Decent place with cheap booze and dancers, ofcourse females. Waiters are greedy for money and will try to exploit you as much as possible. Cheap booze and girls. Go with enough money in pocket and do whatever you want.

Food quality is good and not spicy... Just try chicken choupsey and chilli panneer... It will be finger licking.. The place needs little renovation ... The creepy staff and the rude cashier must be changed.

Esplanade Bar & Restaurant is a decent place for people to grab drinks at reasonable prices. Females won't find this place that attractive or interesting cause the crowd here are mostly hard core drinkers not bothered about ambience or service quality.

Old school. Downright Classy. Love the ambience. Totally cheap and the music gives it a feel of drinking with your buddies in your Hostel room. Just the reason why its always crowded with students. The food is average and the it is a place to exclusively drink and smoke. The music can be noisy at times and the waiters tend to be preoccupied at times. But rest is just good enough for me.

This is not at all a vegetarian restaurant, How can Zomato show it in vegetarian category and mislead people like this? Zomato should urgently correct it.
