The worst because  they are using child labour ! We had seen this when to pay bill otherwise we would not go or leave the place immediately. Second most danger thing is how did they get fire license  becasue only narrow entry they are using for cooking and frying and even a narrow ladder/stair is used to reach the above floor which is enough dangerous  as it has not even a single window for safety and if entry door catches people have no chance to escape. Just an another AMRI will repeat ! Really horrible !

Very unhygienic place,  behavior of the waiters(if they can be addressed by the term) is really rude,  Mutton preparations are always undone as if by rule. Too much oil applied to cover the staleness.  It is a cheap place,  but the money you save here is bound to gush out of your pocket on account of medicines.  Shall not recommended to this place to ANYBODY.!!

This is a small restaurant. We ordered rumali roti, butter tandoori chicken. Price is very low. But the food was not upto the expectation. Chicken preparation was too oily, and the chicken pieces were not fresh, hard and chewy. There was a piece of hair in the gravy and there were cockroaches. I am never visiting this place again.

The Biryani is good in terms of quantity but taste wise there are better options available. The price are cheaper compared to most other options nearby. The best part is their delivery. Their delivery is not just quick but also they deliver till late hours.

A good place to hop in to have some food... Located just beside the metro station.. Ideal to locate easily...
The food is cheaper hence the pocket friendly tag remains constantly with it throughout all the seasons... The place isn't a fancy restaurant you see these days but is a small place to grab a seat & fill your appetite.. The food is good enough for its price & comes in good plentiful amounts... Food is fairly tasty & the staff were friendly along with providing us with prompt service.
A perfect fooding solution for low budget hangouts..

Located right behind the entrance to the Rabindra Sadan Metro station,is this small establishment known for its Mughlai Cuisine and budget friendly prices.

As you pass by the narrow stretch of footpath,you will notice a big pan at the entrance of the place,with a variety of Kebabs and meat preparations kept along the edge.
Seating arrangement is a bit cramped up.
Service is quick.
Rolls,Biriyani and Kebabs are to be tried out when visiting this place.

An okayish budget-friendly (quite cheap actually) restaurant at one of the busiest and expensive parts of the city!
●Location: Rabindra Sadan/ Exide More. Right beside the Rabindra sadan metro station outlet, the one beside the exide office. The tantalizing smell of restaurant makes sure that it's hard to miss out.
●Ambience: Do not look for an 'ambiance' here. It's crowded & chaotic. It's even dirty at times. It's nerve-wracking during the tiffin-hours and on specific ocassions. It's divided into two stories. the ground floor houses the kitchen, a cash counter and 2-3 tables accomodating 10-12 people. The first floor houses another kitchen & a cash counter and accomodates over 30 people at a go. 

●Food:
*  Rolls: the varieties of roll on-the-go is a good grab. I personally like the egg roll and the chicken roll here. A must try.
* Tandoori & Rumali roti: do they even make tandoori rotis?! I clearly doubt. Never have i ever seen it available. It's always 'out of stock' whenever i visit. The Rumali roti is quite average. Quite floury & dusty actually.
* Lachcha paratha:  Good. I can't have more than one. Big, soft and a little oily.
*Mutton tikia : used to love it long time back. But Not anymore. The taste has deteriorated abruptly. One can try though.
*Mutton liver fry: one of the most ordered dishes here. Okayish..
*Chicken biryani : Not bad! Light textured. Made with dalda/vanaspati though. Eat it as fast as u can, coz once it turns cold, it's not so nice anymore.
*Chicken Reshmi kebab: okayish. Not too soft & succulent though.
*Chicken Bharta: Shredded chicken pieces cooked in a creamy yogurt-y gravy, along with half a boiled egg. Tastes okayish.

So, to wind up the review:
Food : 3/ 5
Ambience : 1/5
Cleanliness : 2/5
Service: 3.5/5

Would i visit it again? Well, i have been asking this to myself over 10 years now! YES, for the rolls; Maybe for the other stuff.

We have ordered chicken biriyani, chicken tikka butter masala and coke,and boy was the biriyani good! It was one of the best biriyani i have had. The side dish was ok and enough for two people.

This place is situated just adjacent to the rabindra sadan metro station. This is a very small and cozy place. Though this place serves great food but there is no such privacy while youre dining or on lunch . The food is really great as we ordered one mutton biriyani, one chicken egg biriyani, mutton butter masala and cold firni. The food is no doubt good but the place needs improvement.

If you are so hungry and you have only 100-150 rupees in your pocket, even only 70 rupees, you can easily have a tasty lunch here. I have been here nearly 15times.The best dish, according to me, is the chicken tikka kebabs(20 pieces). I have tried it quite often. And it costs only 110 bucks(may be now increased). The service is too good with both ac n non-ac rooms. The waiters are so generous. Over-all a reasonably good foodstation it is. Do try once atleast.

Visited this eatery today(30.11.17) around 1.20pm. It was already crowded by then. It was that famous. We had already ordered for Murg Musallam at 12pm since it needs to be ordered 1hr before. On reaching there, we went upstairs since there was not much room to sit downstairs. The stairs were pretty narrow and the ceiling of the first floor was way too low even for a shortie like me. Two ACs were on and they even had CCTV cameras, though I doubt whether they actually work. I am mentioning these because it is rare for a roadside eatery to have these and still not charge any extra tax. 
Anyway, coming straight to food, along with the Murg Musallam, we ordered Butter nan, masala kulcha, aloo dam Kashmiri. 

*Murg Musallam- Very tasty and very rich. The coconut paste overpowered the flavour a bit though. And it was hard for us to divide it among the four of us. 

*Butter Naan- Not that buttery but good nonetheless. 

*Masala Kulcha- I found it okay, but my friends thought the masala was too much. 

*Aloo Dam Kashmiri- This one was the worst. It was plain water mixed in turmeric and aloo just happened to be in it. 

All in all, for the cheap rate that they serve, I thought the taste of the non veg items were good enough. The Hygiene factor is fair. It was not squeaky clean. But it was not that horrible either. In addition to that, no gst is applied here.

Not the ideal place for your fancy food. Just gobble and get out. Literally they will throw you out as soon as you finish your plate, our at least make an attempt to make you uncomfortable sitting at your seat. Just don't bother about their service or ambience coz they don't care a shit goddamn it. 
Coming to the food, I must admit it's good, flavourful and quantity is sufficient. Sometime the chap, rezala or biriyani would be extra oily but that's okay specially when the price is that cheap. I have visited the place near rabindrasadan metro station 3-4 times and every single time I had the same food quality and quantity wise. The seating arrangements upstairs are a bit clumpsy and cramped for room. Head room, leg room is very less. The whole place is buzzing always with people, attendants, smell of biriyani and foodies.

Me and my friend ordered two chicken biriyani, one mutton kasa and one plate tandury chicken.
Chicken biriyani and mutton kasa was good. But the tandoori chicken was very dry and hard to chew. Service was fast and the stuff attitude was good.
The prices were quite reasonable according to the quality and quantity..
Take out is better option than dining..

Been this place countless number of time reviewing for the first time.. Located at the Exide more opposite to haldiram...
The place is very pocket freindly and the food is good at its best.. best place for students..
Tried almost every item in here over the years... This time we tried

1ST Chicken biriyani --- which was as random and like usual biriyani dishes and tasty as always it has been...

2ND Chicken tikka masala --- which also an ordinary dish nothing special but tasty..

This place is very popular for serving at a pocket friendly price...
Hence the speciality of this place is serving tasty foods with very much pocket freindly price comes the popularity...
Its another random resturant in kolkata but the location and those taste defenitly serves the purpose and makes this one an unique... Will visit more times...

If you are hungry and have limited money in pocket and of course you are near sadan or exide, Saima is perfect place to satisfy your appetite. Quantity is sufficient (compared to the price). Tandoor items are better. Rolls are delicious. Apart from tandoor and rolls, biryani deserves a try.

Despite being a busy street eatery, the quality of food had been consistent for quite some time. It might feel like another biryani and chaap restaurant,  but they serve lot more things. Even if you are in mood for a vegetarian meal like - dal, roti and sabzi, you get it here. Same for fish and rice, or egg curry and naan. Its not one of those typical biryani places. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and location. A good place to have lunch. Quick service and fast billing. Cant recommend any thing in particular. Almost all the items are fairly good.

To start off, the myth about the food being 'cheap' in price must be broken , for it is not. 
ambience - busy /hot/ couped (which is not the problem, I have had better food in smaller joints)
service - good
food quality - If your chicken is sweeter than your firni, you are not doing it right. 
the chicken rezala we ordered was either stale or made with a lot of sugar. It tasted nothing like it looks.
Food quantity - for one piece of chicken , the price is 90 rupees. however, even the leg piece of the chicken was cut in half vertically to give the illusion of a full piece. 
this place is nothing but overrated.

and the total bill for two came out to be 500 . Unsatisfied. Disgusted. Dissapointed.

This place is located very close to the Rabindra Sadan metro. It has a small seating arrangement in the ground floor along with the roll counter. There is an AC section upstairs. This place is mostly crowded, so one should be prepared for the waiting time. Also since its so crowded you may have to share your table with strangers. Now for the food. This is a mughlai joint, so biriyani is one thing that most people order. However it is nothing special. Also the quantity served is less than average. Most people will not be satisfied with one plate of biriyani. Yes, it is cheaper than other more renowned places. Overall this not a place where you would plan to visit twice, but if you are in and around the area and want to quickly satisfy your hunger pangs, you can drop by at this place.

Saima restaurant which is situated beside the Exide building is very famous for its biriyani and other foods...The biriyani was excellent and the double chicken roll was also very good it was filled with chicken chunks...For ambiance I would say that its not that good...there is sitting arrangement and the first floor is air conditioned...but when it gets crowded its not possible to sit there and have food...But for food i would give Saima 5/5 but for ambiance 3/5

I automatically have a wide smile on my face while walking down the rabindra sadan metro stairs if going for Saima. Their Mutton biriyani is love. So is their tandoori chicken and kebabs. Mainly famous for take aways it's difficult to bag a seat in their small and limited space to offer. Cheap, student friendly and tasty. Saima has always been a favourite since my college days.

Heard alot about this Restaurant,Went there this afternoon for lunch, It was overcrowded the ambience is okay but not much attractive and if there is a heavy rush(jst like today) in the A.C section then be prepared to share your table with someone else.

Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Biryani and Chicken chap, it was absolutely cold yeah but the taste was fine...but still Biryani and "thanda" yak !! Overall not much satisfying 😒 A roll would just be enough from this outlet...will surely never go back .

double chicken  roll- ordered it and wanted to change it as soon as possible but the waiter refused to do so and bought in just 2 mins....the chicken pcs were so hard inside that it wud take minutes to chew them... had a bad experience,, the roll delivery was so fast that i thought it was pre made hours ago..

chicken rezala-the worst chicken dish i had on this planet was this one as it was beige coloured and a single pc with lots of gravy..wen i tasted the gravy i was yukkkedd... it was a sugar filled gravy and i just cudnt have it....no masala no such flavour nothing......
      i regret going here.

chicken biryani-atlast a chicken biryani was ordered by a frnd which was ok.....i just found the biryani ok ,, dats it...

prices are eco friendly but the food quality is cheap and the service was too low grade as waiters were full arrogant.....if u go here by mistake than plz beware before ordering anything.......

If you are looking for good rolls at reasonable price,saima definitely serves you tasty rolls.
I have even tried the Biryani that tasted just normal nothing that special.
But yes,according to the price of the food,the quantity and taste are definitely appreciated.
If you are looking for something on the go,Saima is good option😋

In this restaurant I went many times and I taste many foods like chilli chicken with lachha paratha ,Mutton kasha with special chicken biryani ,chicken rezala and many more Mores. Yes as compared to other restaurants the price of this restaurant is quiet reasonable and foods is ok as compare to price but the restaurant is quiet Messy and crowdy.

I have visited this place numerous times in my college days and now its very near to my head office. So, occasionally I go there to grab a quick lunch. Located beside Rabindra Sadan metro station. It is a very small capacity, non-ac restaurant having mezzanine floor and very suffocative.  Services are good. Behavior of the staffs are also decent. Food quality is excellent and total value for money but ambiance is not at all good.
P.S.: Don't go on the summer season.

A quick bite when I am hungry or when I am having massive roll cravings. I am especially fond of their chicken roll. The food they offer is cheap and of good quality. The sami roll however is a big turn off for me, I wish it was as good as the chicken roll. 
The cold phirni they offer is pretty good and quite fulfilling.
A good joint to satisfy your fast food cravings.

Dont look for the ambience,surroundings and service of like a high end restaurant. Hence not very ideal for dine in , although they have managed a separate space for the same.

Beside the Rabindra sadan metro, one can not wait longer from appetizing because of the blissful smell and looks of chicken being cooked... Whenever I have weekend meetings the place is a regular visit... Ambience is moderate and air conditioning is poor... The service is very fast and no service tax is charged on orders... I will recommend chicken Biriyani, chicken Tikka butter masala, mutton Saima special for must try items.... Mostly the high spiced items taste the same.... From the takeaway counter roll may be tried.... Firni tastes very dull as compared to expectation.... Price is very reasonable.... In order to fill your guts it must be a good choice...

I have ordered two items and I paid through paytm. The delivery boy and restaurent authority clearly had no idea what paytm is. He continuously harrassed me for 15 mins in my work that I hadn't paid. It was so much difficult making him understand and show messages that I paid. It was too much to take. When I called repeatedly the restaurent, after twice that fellow admitted that I paid. And Zomato didn't take any action against it. What a shame and waste of energy. Utter disappointment.

Twice tried food over here. First time had eaten chicken roll which was good and second time tried chicken pakora, masala kulcha,butter nun and paneer butter masala. Also taste chicken biriyani as my friends ordered.Chicken pakora is the only thing for which I would like to go again there. Rated 3 just for the roll and biriyani, otherwise would like to rate 2.5 as paneer butter masala gravy tasted so bad. I think worst paneer dish I ever have. Kulcha was ok,full marks for garnishing while the nun was so hard ✋. Now coming to the service, slow service with little attitude. So overall for sudden unplanned hunger it is okay and pocket friendly.

I can't remember how many time I hv been there or ordered home delivery from them. Saima's chicken biriyani, rumali roti , liver curry are in my top preference list. I must say u can't hv such delicious food ny other place at this price. I hv also tasted the chicken korma , chicken tandoori , chicken reshmi kabab, egg tadka here. They were good but not perfect as the tandoori ws little bit burnt and rubbery, korma ws bit oily, and the reshmi kabab ws good in taste bt not have the perfect 'resham' softness. The ambience is nt so pleasant too. Bt if Ur pocket is pinching nd ur appetite is nt listing u then u cn try Saima.

The place is quite popular for street food and quick bites

No decoration at all for ambience

Staff is quite polite

But the main thing is the food and its taste

The kebabs and the mutton preparations are off the hook keeping in mind the size of the place

Its authentic mughlai recipies are a must try for everyone

The pocket pinch is quite average and will never burn a hole in any pocket

Will visit again for more good food

This joint is located at one of the busiest crossing in Kolkata. The location of the restaurant is so unconventional that one can never locate it without proper direction. It is a perfect restaurant from where you can take your food and have it in your home, but if you think to have food in this joint you have to be extremely lucky. This place is vary small and few plastic chairs are there to sit, so don't expect to find seats easily in peak hours, like noon or in some occasion. The have an upstairs sitting arrangement but the ceiling is very low. The Restaurant is not at all neat and clean. But it has made his name for mainly two reasons, their location advantage and the pocket friendly pricing of food items. As the restaurant is run by Mohammedans as it name suggests, it will be wise to visit restaurant before six during Ramadan month.
I visited this place for two times with my friends. Food quality is so-so. I tasted their Chicken Liver curry, Rumali Roti, Chicken Kabab, Chili chicken, Mutton kasha. I will not compare the taste and quality of the food with giants, but no one can delivers these items in such unbelievable low price.
So my recommendation is, you can visit the place for once or take food with you, but do not expect hospitality like other restaurants.

Saima is a small restaurant just beside Rabindra Sadan Metro Gate 1. Even though it is a small joint but there is no shortage of crown in here. Any day, any time of the day you will always get this place almost filled with people. Anyway, Saima is my gateway to cheap and good quality food whenever I'm returning from college and hungry. I have even forgot the count of how many times I have been to this places. I have tried almost everything on the menu here. They all taste almost equally good, but one of my favourite is their Chicken Rezala with Lachcha Paratha. If you are looking for some quick bite, try their Chicken Sami Roll, its delicious - as simple as that.

Cling-clang-clunk!!!

This is what we hear when we enter the petite restaurant just beside exide. The clinging sound of tawa and laddle, the clattering sound of fork and plate, the hustle bustle line for roll takeaway, makes it a compact place. Famous for its mughlai delicacy...

Coming to the food joint- small, compact and not oh so clean looking space.

About the Food- Do not have any idea how much cleanliness is maintained in preparation inside the kitchen area but the food tastes good... Lachha paratha size is quite decent and goes well with any side dish to fill up the hungry belly...☺ Chicken chaap, Chicken bharta, chicken kassa, mutton kassa, chicken rolls, all tastes good.
Hope the cleanliness gets much better position in the upcoming days...

This joint is situated at the exide crossing, just beside the metro gate no. 1..
I have visited this place for several times.. Yesterday I went there maybe after 2 years after watching movie at nandan..
This is a small accommodation with poor ambience.. sitting arrangement is so bad that a woman had cut her fingers in a fan placed right behind her head and surprisingly the staffs had no sympathy at all.. Now come to the food..
Food ordered: 1) rumali roti: as it occurs normally..
2) chicken bharta: worst chicken bharta I have ever tasted.. quantity and quality both are unsatisfactory.. they served literally pieces of chicken in their so called chicken bharta..
3) paneer butter masala: we were regretting when took the first bite.. gravy is so poor in taste and the pieces of paneer were also hard.. this is also worst paneer butter masala I have ever tasted..
The staffs aren't friendly at all..
And lastly, my friend is suffering from loose motion after having their food.. Their quality or quantity wasn't this bad before but this time it was a horrible experience for us..
Total wastage of money.. I think I shouldn't visit there again to waste my money..

Mostly good for take-away rolls. Location in the busiest crossing of the area, one would find it hard to step inside the below-ground hall of the restaurant. Mostly frequented by lorry staff and trucksters, this place doesn't boast of a good decor or a fine-dine experience. The only thing I like here are it's rolls. They're not too expensive, and the quantity is good. However, they're dry and lack a certain element that makes rolls great. A plus point is that they offer home delivery for nearby areas, and do not take much time.

I went for a movie date at Nandan which was scheduled in the evening. And though me and my boyfriend was already full with our lunch but suddenly after reaching there we started feeling hungry and just gave a quick surf through zomato to get to know about this place near us which can serve us good biriyani. Like mood swings, I sometimes get Biriyani swings(It happens 😜) so our menu was already decided. We followed the map and gave a walk from Nandan. It took nearly 15-20 minutes to reach there. As our menu was already decided, we got our biriyani instantly. According to me the quantity was too less as compared to the price. But about the taste, there is nothing much to complain.

Saima Restaurant is located in Exide More.It's a place to enjoy pocket friendly Chicken Biriyani .Biriyani is satisfactory.Other chicken dishes with gravy are also delicious but oily.They used to serve Plain Rice at lunch time with dal,vegetable and curries in reasonable range which is the best part of Saima Restaurant.Place is tiny and congested.

I visited this place from my school life ..
It's located at exide more ..
Its a busy place during the lunch time 
Most of the time i tried briyani 
It's good by quality and quantity ..
But one negative point 
It's little unhygenic ..
A pocket friendly resturant to dine in ... :)

When you board off at rabindra sadan metro station or exide crossing you will be drawn with a smell of biriyani n chap ... and if you follow the smell you will come across a very old mughlai restaurant a total non classy look but crowded with people of all ages mainly school, college and office goers ... Firstly Roll, awesome taste and yummy for tummy ... Now if tou want to try the chap and rumali roti or boriyani then you can have there or you can take away ... The best combination id like is Chicken biryani and mutton chap ... otherwise the dishes you can try there are: chicken boti kebab n paratha, chicken rezala with roti, chicken chap n roti, tandoori chicken ... First by look u will not like it but once you taste the biriyani you tongue will always want that biriyani irrespective of the ambience, place ... Will go there soon it is calling me

Went there with my friends for lunch ... Good quality of food with good quantity as well ... Very much pocket friendly and affordable ... The only disadvantage I feel it has is the space ... It's really popular so it would have been much more better with a greater space ... Otherwise it looks very crowded ... Overall, a nice place to eat in cheap price ...

Without a doubt "Saima Restaurant" which is at exide more, kolkata has the best rolls i've ever had in this city till date with a super affordable price✌🏻️. Personally, its one of my favourite place which helps to satisfy my hunger..🙈😘
You will find here almost all kind of rolls be it paneer roll, chicken roll, vegetable roll and many more.😊🌯 Not only rolls but they have many other variety of dishes which I haven't tried yet but i'm gonna do it soon😛. So you guys must visit this place and try out their dishes.

This place is pretty underrated, I would say. The ambience isn't great and there's little to no provision to sit and eat. However the food is delicious. I always get it packed and eat it at the comfort of my home/office space. Their rolls are a die for! Their chicken biryani is also good- not the best in town, but in terms of quality, price and taste, it makes a good meal.

I am seeing this Restaurant since my College days, During the College days I've just taste the roll from this restaurant.. 

Now I've decided to check the other food items from this restaurant, I've ordered the chicken biryani and it was ok.. The only disadvantage of this restaurant is the seating capacity, but thank god they have the upstairs room which is much more decent then the downstairs..

As this is very small restaurant, so it is needless to comment on the interiors of the restaurant.. I"ll recommend this restaurant for the College and the Office goers.. This restaurant provides quality food in reasonable price..

If you want cheap but tasty healthy food then I recommend you Saima. When ever I went there I always ordered chicken biriyani and some chicken side dishes. There service is good but one minus point of there restaurant is space . They don't have sufficient space for their customers specially in there 1st floor they arrange some seating arrangement but it's not spacious even fully closed no window is there.
But according to cheap food I liked it, even I like their egg chicken roll also.

For a joint of this scale to act both as drop in for quick bites as well as serving authentic is simply amazing.

My favs include their mutton biriyani,mutton kasaa and the rolls.
Very quick to serve...although shabby.

Broke? Running low on cash and yet craving for lip smacking food? Saima is the best place to be!

What I love about this small eatery is not it's ambience, not it's location, but it's value for money food and the behaviour of the staffs.
All the dishes are delicious and you'll get Chicken biriyani just for Rs 110..Also the quantity is very sumptuous. In gravy items, I've tried chicken bharta and chicken kasa..Both were good and the prices were very economical.

P.S : this place doesn't levy tax..And you'll get tasty food for a very pocket friendly rate.
So without a doubt this place totally deserves a 5 out of 5 rating :)

You will get enough food in just 300 Rupees! Sitting arrangement is not at all good, this is the main negativity of this restro! But yes, you can try here or you can buy for your home while returning from your office! ;-)

Great quantities of food at low prices. Have tried their tandoori and biriyani many a times. The only gripe is the hygiene of the place. The tables are sticky with oil. I have found strands of hair in their mutton shami kebab many a times - not sure if human hair or goat hair. The food is oily and full of flavour. If they renovate the place a little bit, it can be a hugely popular place, but then they would probably revise their prices.

Dropped in here with few friends as budget was limited.. This place was on my list for a long time but unfortunately never happened so today was the day..
Location is just beside the Rabindra sadan metro Opposite The haldiram's..
This one is a small place with limited sitting option on the ground and top floor.. place is unhygienic and really small..
We ordered Chicken biriyani, chicken Bharta, Paneer butter masala, lacha paratha, rumali roti, firni..
Biriyani was really good, gravy items were all same just chicken Bharta had chicken and paneer butter masala had paneer, lacha paratha was good.. 
At the end of the day happy eating😇

You can have any mughlai dish here in such amount & quality that you don't have to worry neither about your stomach nor wallet..

It's beside Rabindra Sadan metro station. Whenever you walk beside this restaurant, you will smell khusbu of foods and its hard to control yourself after that. A friend of mine suggested me when i was in college. Maximum time I used to go there for their lovely biriyani and mutton shami tikka. It's pocket friendly also. But I also tried their roll biriyani lachha paratha mutton kasha mutton shammi tikka , and I still love it. But area is congested though you will find a ac dining area at the first floor and sometimes service of the waiters are bad. Overall still it is a very good place to eat if you want to spend small and eat a lot .

Saima is a famous restaurant located in Little Russel Street. As it is centrally located in Little Russel Street, just beside Rabindra Sadan Metro Gate. It caters to both offices and residential orders. They have a wide variety of menu to choose from and their turn around time is also impressive.  They provide good food in reasonable prices. They have the facility to sit and dine and the ambience is moderate. I would recommend this store for all the food loving giants in Kolkata. So next time when you are passing through Rabindra Sadan Metro area check it out. You’ll love the food.

Located just beside Sadan metro station at exide more...
Its a wonderful place where you can get amazing dishes at surprisingly cheap rates.
Be it Nandan, or while returning from British council, or from Forum mall even...
This restaurant has been my favourite for ages.
The recent delivery of food has also improved and surprisingly we three could have a full appetising meal at a nominal price of just 300 rupees.
Chicken Biriyani, chicken bharta, chicken liver Fry, all the different types of rolls are the ones I generally do depend upon !

Tiny joint you probably will surely miss on the Exide crossing. 

Tucked behind the Metro Entrance 2 just opposite to the Haldirams it's a busy joint of spicy mughlai delicacies. Their thick and juicy meat rolls are legendary. Try any mughlai cuisines starting from Biryani to chaaps, all are savory. 

Prices are surprisingly low and thats why its very famous among the students.

Located right next to Rabindra Sadan Metro station. 

The upper section of the restaurant is mainly for dine-in while below its just take away. 

We tried the lachha paratha, chicken chaap, chicken reshmi masala. 
Loved the paratha and chaap combination. Chicken reshmi masala was bad. Hard pieces of chicken in a horrible gravy. 
Nevertheless, food is value for money.
Service is decent.

One moment you order your food the next moment it's on your table. The place is always crowded. And guess what, for only Rs. 110 you get chicken biryani and an Air conditioner cooling the air. And there are no taxes. 
I love every item of theirs and the best part after having a heavy meal also the bill never exceeds 300.

Almost all of us who appeared out of the Rabindra Sadan Metro from the Exide Gate have had once experienced the strong aroma of food being prepared and it is from the Saima Restaurant. The two floored eatery is located just beside the Rabindra Sadan Metro in the intersection known as Exide Morh.
It is one of those places where you will found office goes flock and hence one might expect the prices to be standard but amazingly enough it is quite low for the area it is situated. The quality of food is good and taste too, keeping in mind the amount being charged. You can also term it a reasonably priced restaurant.
However, there are few things one might dislike there and one of them is Child Labour. Also, the upper floor is too low and makes anyone uncomfortable followed by burst of air freshener which make you more irritated than refreshed.
I have had tried both Biryani as well as Moghlai which seemed okayish to me.
One visit is advised to form an opinion.

Hungry? Searching food at a cheap rate because your wallet is nearly empty?? Don't worry... This is the perfect place for those foodies who want food at a cheap rate & don't think much of interior decoration... They serve delicious dishes & moreover they don't add vat or service tax... Though they're not famous for biriyani still they serve delicious Biriyani... Their Rolls are one of the best in kolkata... Though it is a bit clumsy place & decoration is not upto that mark.... Bt still it is efficiently comfortable to dine in..

Saima. If you're looking for good place to eat a lot of food and pay very less for it then this is the place for you. Went to have an early dinner with friends after the film festival. We were walking around a lot so in the process we worked up an appetite. We ordered chicken biriyanis, a tandoori chicken, masala kulcha and mutton saima spacial. I have to say the quantity was great. It will fully satisfy your hunger pangs. Taste wise also it's great. And it's cheap. It's the best of both worlds. Ambience wise, maybe it's not that great but it okay for the locale. I love it and will definitely recommend it to all. 👍

It's just near rabindra sadan metro gate....the place where it is situated and the way the cooking is done it's quite accident prone...and talking about the food...chicken biriyani with egg is just a mouth watering one....it's spicy and the flavours are amazing...and on the other hand the palank mutton and mutton keema is just a disaster.....the behaviour of the staffs is really nice and they always hold a smile on their face that's kind of overwhelming....if you really love something spicy you must visit...

Once visited with my friends and ordered mutton biryani and chicken kasha. Chicken kasha was so so bt biryani was horrible. It was like the cook has put rice and mutton together. Ambience was also not good as it is located exactly beside the rabindrasadan Metro Station.

Makes great rolls and biriyani that offers a lot of bang for the buck. Their side dishes aren't as good but decent enough. This place is recommended just on the basis of their very tasty and cheap biriyani. Perfect place to visit if you are craving biriyani but low on cash.

Located just close to Rabindra Sadan metro station. This restaurant 🍴 serves good quality food 🍲, and that too at a very reasonable price. Worth a shot if you are somewhere close, and you can feel the rats in your stomach.

Rolls are their speciality. But we were hungry so we decided to give something else a try. Most of our choice was unavailable. So atlast we ordered chicken bharta, paratha and firni. Taste is average. Staff behaviour..a bit lethargic but its manageable. A little bit of upgradation would not have harmed either

We had ordered biriyani and lachcha parantha with mutton kasa.Even though this place is famous for cheap biriyani and other dishes.I was disappointed by there service.The place lacks cleanliness and is not spacious.There was a hair on my plate for which the waiter apologized since there was rush at the restaurant and wanted to change.Hope the management stresses more on cleanliness from now.

This restaurant is located just beside the rabindrasadan metro . This place is always crowded . They prepare great biriyani and rolls . The paratha with mutton chap is a must try combo if you visit this place. It is a super pocket friendly place. 
But if one is not habituated to eat unhygienic street foods,then this place is definitely not for him/her.

Being here 2-3 times
U can't miss this joint since it's just feets away from the rabindra aadan metro ,exide outlet
Roll experience was up and down
The 1st time I ordered chicken roll.....it was grt
Crisp and flaky and chicken was tasty
The second time I ordered egg chicken roll I was disappointed..... The paratha wasn't as gud as last time.....it was more on the soggy side .
Next: had lunch around three times there
1st time was with Tut friends where we all ordered biryani....no complains .....3-3.5yrs ago
2nd time was dinner after a Clg fest with a frnd....had ordered roti, chicken Bharta and chicken tikka butter masala. It was better than biryani and real tasty...2yrs ago
3rd time was sept 2016 ,went for lunch .
Ambiance : no change this is the only issue one won't prefer to sit and eat..... Though the 1st floor is a.c it's clumsy, and too crowded to move freely....less spacious.
To my disappointment I saw cockroaches roaming around the wall not once but twice today.... Major turnoff and the reason I give 3 rating .👎👎👎👎
Food : ordered rumali roti: it's was not warm at all. 👎
Lacha paratha : loved it.... Very less oily , flaky , tasted awsome 👍👍👍
Chicken reshmi butter masala : kabaab size is on the larger side.
Gravy tasted awsome .👍👍👍
Pocket pinch for 3 of us was rs 210.
A request to the people there plz do something to the interiors and the cockroaches .

Frequently visit this place as it is near to my office. This outlet is  located at a convenient place -  just beside Rabindra Sadan Metro Station . Mainly prefer to have biriyani & rolls here . The seating arrangement is not much to speak about , very much cramped & noisy . Biriyani is so so - but at that price it is ok . They make good rolls - be it mutton , chicken ,  egg or their combination . Quite a few mughlai dishes are also available but not all of them worth trying . Overall experience - value for money at their prices . One piece of advice - avoid on very rainy days as the whole place gets submerged in water .

Saima..very easy to locate. As you come out of sadan metro station (exide building gate) u will notice this by lane which is always crowded because of the rush! The aroma of biriyani and chaap makes it easy to locate it in the gali! It's a small place..getting a table depends on the luck! As it's small , the sitting arrangement is cramped.. And gets messy during the rush hour! Coming to their food , tried their chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken qorma, mutton keema with roomali roti and chicken roll. Reasonable pricing. Tasted good. But preferred mutton biriyani and chicken roll over the others.

It won't take to you long to find the place. Once you get down from the train at Rabindra Sadan - you could smell the Biriyanis and the Chaaps from the platform itslef !! This place is famous for its rolls and Mutton tikkis. The Biriyani and the Chaaps are great as well ( Would recommend the Mutton versions of both ). Sit in dining is not recommended - very cramped arrangements !

The place is good for budget mughl and awadhi food.  The best to try here are mutton tikia and rumali roti. U can also try the mutton shammi roll. 

The firni and Biriyani is worth a try. A special mention to the egg do piyaza . 

Do visit if in the mood for delicious food on a shoe string budget.

''Achha Bhi...Sasta Bhi!!''It is their tagline and they stand up to it. Biryani,rolls and kebabs are the specialty at unbelievably cheap price along with gorgeous quantity and quality. Located just beside the entrance to RS metro station. Takeaway is the preferred option since the sitting accommodation is not air-conditioned and tends to get stuffy and very crowded.
            **Folks looking for some fine dining should steer clear.

This is situated right next to Rabindra sadan metro stn,opposite to Haldiram's. This looks shady from outside and the interiors are no different. The only thing which will drag you here is the smell drifting from here,and believe me it will be worth it. The rolls here are good. Made pretty efficiently and fast. This restaurant does have a first floor,which is air conditioned but does nothing to improve the 'dingyness'. Have had roti,chicken bharta and 1-2 other chicken dishes here. It tasted good enough to me. This is an ideal place for hungry students to grab a quick bite between tutions.

Food is good considering the price factor. This place is for those situations when you have very less money in your pocket but want to have a sumptuous Mughlai meal.

Most unpleasant restaurant experience of my life.
ill-mannered waiters are enough to ruin the restaurant.
They literally force us to pay tips and almost snatched the balance from us.Why should one pay some tips for the overcrowded,dirty,clumsy place!!
I will never pay a revisit here and would rather like to have the parcel or home delivery option.Because amidst all these hell their Mutton Saima special and laccha paratha and Lassi were lips smacking and very pocket friendly.

I don't know why haven't I reviewed this place before. The smell of the biryani reaches till the gate of rabindra sadan metro. I have almost been here 10 times and every time my order was mutton biryani and chicken chap. The taste and aroma of the biryani is amazing. The soft, well boiled and well marinated mutton piece is the actual hero of the biryani. The chap is great too. The place is hygienic and offers good food at extremely cheap prices. The only thing which I disliked was that during my first visit, as I didn't give any tip, the waiter was behaving as if i had not paid my bill !

This is exactly the place you must hit to. Just beside rabindra sadan metro station (exide gate), they serve you excellent food to diminish your hunger. Though there is a space crunch, but the pocket friendliness of the place overcome all its drawbacks. Have a plate of plain rice daal and a plate of chicken or paneer, you are ready to say goodbye to hunger for few hours. They serve you real quick and the staff is is friendly!

This was our go to place while working in a place in Camac Street.This place was a boon during weekends as very less eateries use to be open.

We particularly gorged on the Rolls,Somali Roti,Paratha,Rezala,Chaap, Tadka and Firni.

The eatery is very economically priced and located beside Exide.

It's best to order for delivery or take away as it gets very hot and humid inside with all the cooking going on.

I've eaten here only once.
Location : Just beside the Rabindra sadan metro gate.

This is a two storeyed restro, the ground floor being mainly a takeaway and has a few tables. However, the first floor has proper sitting arrangements, although the ceiling is quite low for a tall guy like me.

I had mutton liver masala, chicken tandoori, paratha and phirni.

The tandoori chicken was good. Nothing special.

Didn't like the liver masala at all, it was hard and not cooked properly and the gravy was runny.

Parathas were oily albeit tasted nice.

Phirni was okayish

I have been bypassing this outlet since my childhood but never did I try the menus. On a winter noon, one of my school friends, insisted us on having Biriyani from Saima. TBH, Saima's ambience is a major turn off. The overpowering smell almost made me barf. I literally cringed and made faces. Hygiene is a crucial factor for me. Dissatisfied. Never ever going back there. Errrm, 1 star.

Saima has been a favourite place for me since childhood as my school was nearby and i was a frequent visitor to this place. But aftr my school got over i make sure to hav food frm.here whenever i am nearby. They serve the most mouth watering biriyani in town giving tough competition to arsalan and the others. The other items like the mutton and chicken dishes are mouth watering and oily spicy. Its tasty but unhygenic. Rolls are also fantastic. But its a take away joint the restaurant is really a let down for the dine in option.

Located exactly at the corner of exide crossing but ridden from view by the metro entrance is the pocket friendly restaurant. As far as ambience is concerned this place doesn't stand out, but the service is quick and it is hygienic(i.e. the tables, plates and spoons are clean)
I have visited this place countless number of times, so finally decided to write a review. 
I visited this place yesterday with few of my friends and we ordered the following:

Murgh musallam:(3/5) We had to order it in 1 hour advance. To our disappoitment they only gave us half of the chicken and not the whole. Nevertheless it was quite tasty, the chicken was soft and succulent, and the spices were well balanced.

Chicken Bharta:(3.5/5) A mildly spiced dish with lots of shredded chicken cooked with milk.

chicken shikh kebab:(3.5/5) 20 small boneless pieces of chicken with capsicum and onions. a Very ordinary dish. The chicken was the same that they give in chicken rolls

Mutton handi qorma:(2/5) worst dish I have ever tasted. Couldn't find a single shred of mutton and was extremely  spicey. Almost threw it away.

chicken reshmi masala:(4/5) One of my favourite dishes at this outlet. A delicious chicken dish

If you ever visit this place DO NOT order a mutton dish. Try out the various chicken dishes also the Chicken tandoori(dry) is quite good.
Overall a good place if you are on a tight budget.

Amidst the hustle bustle of Exide there stands a great mughlai-awadhi joint.
A two storeyed building having enough space to occupy more than 40people at once, no fancy decor but yet air-conditioned for much relief.
So we ordered their special chicken biryani with mutton kosha and of course to digest it we did take cold drinks! 😆
Biryani was absolutely marvellous with enough portions for two, with a gigantic aluu...which I loved the most (absolutely sheddho, so no complaints)
But didn't like the kosha much, becz I had better in many places.
Pocket pinch is quite cheap.
Service is fast.
Prompt staffs.
These are enough to stabilize a hungry stomach.

RECOMMENDED! 👑

Every review for this place begins with its negligible ambience and poor hygiene and it's completely true. But there are no bugs on your food and the service puts even fine dining to shame.
Leave your inhibition at the entrance. Smell the aroma. Forget the surroundings for some time, it's not difficult because you will be lost in enjoying the taste and you are in for great food without a pocket pinch. Just get that insanely cheap biryani (mutton biryani for Rs115), throw in a few side dishes like luscious chaap and liver fry or a silky rumali roti and you have no complaints, well maybe the excess oil but again who seeks good health in biryani.

Coming to my personal dining experience.
Had ordered mutton biryani and mutton cutlet type thing and a rumali roti. The mutton in the biryani was a big chunk and melting soft and the potato was excellent. The entire portion was huge but had to leave the oil, haha. The mutton cutlet was oily likewise but tasted very good. The tang of the curd it was fried along hit the Palate like an arrow. Ate happily with a tissue soft rumali roti.
Two people dined, mutton biryani, mutton cutlet and rumali roti. All to a total of Rs320.
Heaven on earth and heaven in real if... Hehe

The service is really quick, but food is quite rich & heavy & oily.. Moreover, the sitting area is not so comfy.. This joint is located just near the metro entrance at Exide more.. Yet, this has been and always will be one of my favorite food joints, so many memories with friends..

Mutton Biryani- Although the mutton was soft, the taste wasn't quite up to the mark..
Chicken Tandoori- It was well marinated and well cooked.. not too dry... it was good.
Overall, it was OK, but surely could have been a lot better..

Located at a prime and advatangeous location, the restaurant is a disgrace. cleanliness is a major issue. We found a dead cockroach in our food. Imagine our horror! the rumali roti and chicken butter masala (whatever we could eat) was not that bad but it was too oily and spicy. the firni is very very bad. The rolls are the only redeeming factor.

such a disgrace though the location is well known to everyone. the management team could build a restaurant in such a prominent location with high standard of service. horrible entrance and seating area. If one front table is full, the members of the adjacent table can not move or come out even when they are finished until the front table members leave. but their business has flourished because the exide and nandan goers who abandoned haldiram option, kept coming here. 
firstly we have to wait 20minutes to get a table. there was no one in the upper floor they were just cleaning the area for 20minutes. we didnot get desired food due to unavailability of those particular dishes. Mutton quorma came with excess oil floting on the top left us terrified. We replaced it with mutton butter masala. consumed very small amount and the rest we could not eat. inedible oil curry and distasteful mutton pieces. price was really cheap. but they were not happy with the 'tips' so they deliberately hid it an told no tips was given. well played -_- not going there again.

Location wise this place is spot on. But the space is a huge issue. I liked this restaurant a lot but recently I've started noticing inconsistency in their food quality.
The food is quite cheap in comparison to other restaurants and taste wise it is good for most of the times. 
MURG MUSALLAM is a house special and ohh yes, it is special all right. It costs about 200 bucks and is quite a delight for the taste buds. Tandoori butter masala, liver roll,chicken qorma are delicious as well.

But Biryanis and parathas are not up to the mark. The first floor is not very clean and visually not appealing at all. But the place is very busy and loved and has a loyal customer base. 
As mentioned before, space is a huge minus and you'll see what I mean once you visit.

Saima oh you beauty! It's like having an old scotch within your budget, which will give you a ecstatic feeling. Mouthwatering dishes in very cheap price and that too damn delicious! Ahh... Yesterday I had mutton biriyani with egg and chicken reshmi kebab butter masala! Yummy... The biriyani was a surprise item for me, the quality which they are serving for such a low price is just wonderful surprise for biriyani lovers. Please give Saima a fair chance to surprise you. Even though the ambiance is not so comforting, the food will make up for it.

The Place &Location : On the crossing of RabindraSadan, hidden behind the metro station. The smell of its rolls and other items roams in the entire crossing and it will make you feel hungry for sure. One of the most popular and old restaurant that serves varieties of flavours in North Indian at reasonable rate and awesome in taste. This place is divided in two sections, the ground floor has less seating capacity and mainly a takeaway but on the second floor its a good place for dining in air condition with fans over your head. The seats are properly managed and the place is decently clean. The staffs are always around to take orders and it hardly take time to get the recepies. A small restaurant in size but a big bomb in the matter of taste.

The Food : Heard a lot about this place's Biriyani and was determined from somany days to have it at this place. Finally got a chance and had 1. Chicken Biriyani& 2.Mirinda Cold Drink.

1. Chicken Biriyani : A Biriyani with such awesome taste at such reasonable rate. Biriyani is served at most of the places in the city but hardly many of them comes closer  to provide perfection. But this place was very close  to it. I must say their Biriyani is comparable to the taste and quality of Arsalan or Aminia. The quantity was decent and fit for a single person and the chicken piece given was great as well. Every spoon was full of taste and i got my money's worth. Must Try.

My Rating : 3.5/5

2. Mirinda Cold Drink : Orange in colour and makes you feel refreshed after having rich food. 

Overall Experience &Recommendation : My rating for this place would be 

3/5 for Ambiance

3.5/5 for Service

3.5/5 for Taste

3.5/5 for Reasonability

A satisfying place whenever you feel hungry. Their dishes are worth money and they are great in taste. A small place running so successfully and providing awesome taste instead of having so rush in such a crowdy place. Must visit place if you are in the area of rabindra sadan.

Located just in front of the Rabindra-sadan metro entran, this place will catch your eye. Visited Saima Restaurant twice and actually want to give them a rating of 3.75.
This place is clumsy, not well maintained but apart from that they are really good. They serve decent biryani, chaps at a very reasonable price.
I had mutton biryani and chicken butter masala. Biryani tasted nice to me with a well cooked mutton piece. Chicken masala was oily but according to the taste, it was satisfactory.
Their service was really quick. They manage to accommodate so many people inside this clumsy joint only because of their efficient service.
A place to recommend, if one is looking for some quick bites.

The place is small and appears to be even smaller with its low ceiling. You may feel claustrophobic at times. Ignore this and you get superb food at really low rates.
I've visited this place a number of times and have tried various kinds of dishes. The food quality was always up to the mark.
The service is prompt even when it's crowded to the fullest.
It's a great place to grab a quick bite or have a dinner; the restaurant serves both purposes equally well.

P.S. Don't forget to check out their Shawarma Roll, it's quite popular.

So here, place is the only issue and there is a lot of noise which sometimes gets unbearable.
Still why is such rating then? Right?
Because absolute quality foods at very affordable prices which is why there is a lot of crowd rush here all the time.
Students, office-goer's, everybody sleek in here for a meal.
From rolls, kebabs to biriyani, rumali, firni all has been fantastic. Quite sufficient in food quantity is the best part and the taste is also awesome. Had been here many many times.
Good place to hang around if you have a tight pocket :)

For a guy who is 6'5" tall, the upper storey of this restaurant is, well, almost inaccessible. The place is also pretty small and feels cramped. So, why the 4.5 rating? 
It's Because of the food it serves. Ambience wise, this is not a place where you can go on a blind date. But if you are a food lover like me, this is a place which should be on top of your go-to list. Saima, provides incredible cheap prices, which perhaps is the biggest reason that attracts me to this place. Secondly, this is a place where you can go with rs 100-150 and eat your hearts out. My favourite item, is Obviously mutton liver, which is nutritious, tasty, and goes well with a couple of lachcha paranthas. Biriyani is simple but the quantity of rice is enough for an adult person. If you're not going for anything heavy, the rolls provide an awesome alternative. 

P. S. If you're a dessert lover, try the firni. It costs 20rs merely

This one is near to my college so every single day or the other i use to visit the place. This place has fed me wid there mutton tikiya & rumali roti many a times, which can make ur stomach full in just rs 50, it saved me many a times during the month ends :P else i would have died coz of hunger. Coming to the biriyanis, its average, the mutton kasha is delicious. The lacchas are soft, the chilli chicken is totally an indian dish here but tastes really good. More than the food, the nostalgia surrounding this place will bring me back here again & again.
P.S. always try to get a seat on the ground floor u'll get an onion salad for free ;)

Located just next to Rabindra Sadan metro. For the metro users and all other people passing by on a daily basis, the day starts with the aroma of the biryanis and other non-veg dishes which covers up the entire gate of the metro. That acts as an instant appetizer. Although the place is quite clumsy, they still manage to accommodate many heads under the roof. Food tastes good. Biryanis, chaaps are mostly consumed here. Only the hygiene is to be looked into a bit.

This restaurant is located just beside the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station near the Exide foot. This is a small restro having two stairs. Upper floor is air conditioned. But one must have to take care of their head when climbing the stairs. 
From the ambience perspective it is very simple and small. Nothing that special about it but at least it is clean which is the main part. 
Now coming to the quality of the dishes i must say it is more than okk for the price. I had already had their rolls several times before. This time we dined in. 
We had chicken chili along with roomali roti and laccha paratha.  Taste wise all the preparations were really good. 
Serving was also very prompt and friendly. Love to visit here again....

The service is quick and the food lip smackingly good. Today I ordered chicken biryani and chicken tikka kebabs. The biryani packet worth 110 bucks is a steal! The quality and quantity is excellent and I'm a fan of their cooking. Love this place!

You can smell the brilliant taste of mughlai cuisine when you passed out in front of restaurant. This place was not so clean may be because of over crowded all the time and also simple looking. Ambitious and hospitality was good they treat their customers very well. Service was quick and their staffs were also decent. Food was delicious. One of the best restaurant of mughlai cuisine in kolkata. Their veg biryani smells very nice and tastes amazing. I also tried their panner tikka and surprisingly it was also tastes very good. Highly recommended to all mughlai cuisine lover.

If you r near rabindra sadan n carving for cheap yet a fulfilling meal this is the place to be. It's just tucked away behind the metro station and serves mainly north Indian dishes. If you don't know the place let your sense of smell guide you. Lol.  But avoid this place if you r a hygiene freak. Food is okayish compared to the dirt cheap price charged for them. Their rolls vanishes like hot cakes during the peak hours. The chicken biriyani ia a thumbs up too but chicken chanp and other items contains way too much oil. :-( 
Service is super fast as this place is always crowded owing to its prime location. Don't expect any ambiance though.

"Don't judge a book by its cover". The same applies here. Although the restaurant is very small with very less space and overly populated with bad ambience, still the taste of the food makes you forget everything. It's so far the best restaurant in Kolkata with very cheap, minimal priced food and a very fast delivery service. Do try it once and let me know if m wrong.

Warm service, very small interiors but good food; that's Saima for you.
Post shopping I was really hungry so I dodged. 
Service is warm, polite, attentive and very quick. 
We ordered Rumali Rotis with Chicken Chaap, a Chicken Biryani for myself, and a salad and Coke. We further ordered a Mutton Biryani because, well....more Biryani is never bad. :D
Biryani was spicy, slightly heavy (wouldn't be very good if had cold) but tender potato, adequately spiced meat. 
Mutton was ridiculously tender and melt in the mouth, extremely good. Chaap was oniony, dark, mildly sweet and very tasty, had with Rotis and my Biryani. 
Rotis were soft and stayed so even in the AC and the ceiling fan. 
Total hoggage came to 315, absolutely no complaints!

This is a small joint hidden behind the metro exit at exide crossing. 
The place is burstling, and sells a variety of greasy food at very low prices. 
I've had a variety of their dishes as take away. The food tastes okayish,certainly good enough when you have hunger pangs and cash is low. The tikias ,rolls and kassa are good. However, I'd recommend you to stay away from the liver fry. The liver tastes wierd,very chewy and hard. I've only had take aways so can't comment on service...however the dining area is very small.

Situated just beside the Rabindra Sadan Metro station at Exide More. A small two storied restaurant, mainly popular as a take away counter. Seating capacity in 2nd floor increased from the last time I visited. Well frankly speaking it is not a spacious, very hygienic kind of restaurant. Ambience was also not great. But I must say it is Kolkata's best pocket friendly restaurant. In my opinion food is the main considerable point in a food joint. It is a foodie's paradise considering the price they are charging. We have ordered Lachcha Paratha, Mutton Shami Kebab, Chicken Seekh Kebab, Special Mutton Biriyani & Lassi.
Paratha - 6.5/10

I have been taking food from this joint for a very long time.

this is one of my favourite places from Kolkata for its very very affordable and tasty dishes.

if you like a good seating area, I will not recommend sitting here to eat, rather take away your food.

because the seating area is cramped and might not be comfortable for most people.

food recommendation :

mutton/chicken biryani

chicken reshmi kebab

chicken bharta

chicken tandoori butter masala

take food away. sit at home comfortably and eat their delicious dishes.

Have been to this outlet on several occasions. Although space crunch is a big concern, good food at pocket friendly rates is something that will be served every time. For ambience it will score less but it makes up with good food. Try chicken bharta, or mutton handi keema with rumali roti or paratha. As far as biriyani is concerned, its good but better available in Kolkata. Crowd favourite seemed to be those concerned with livers and can be tried by"liver lovers".

If you are in Exide More and you smell yumm tikia then its definitely Saima. The Biriyani is good and with less oil. The Rolls are quite good and pretty quickly served. But this place has a big disadvantage of its dining space which is too small to stand or sit comfortably. If you are planning to eat from Saima its better you parcel it

Even u might feel puckish because of the pungent smell of the open chicken cooking, while passing down the narrow lane opening to one of the Rabindra Sadan metro outlet near Exide!! But but but as i said above Do not go by its looks!! They serve awesome food..Mughlai is their cuppacino !😉 Saima is my one stop back to back sharp-set ! Whenever im hungry they are a call away... and trust me quick service!!! 😘😎 My quest of one true love for biriyani meets its satisfactory end here!! Its Biriyani is just fab...light and drooling!!! Other than dat... I love their tadka...rezala..and paneer butter masala!! 
Its been years i v been ordering and will continue the saga!😁😁🍲🌮

This is a place to have some quick lunch. Don't expect nice decor, proper hygiene or separate table for your group. But if you are at exide more and want to grab decent lunch within 100 bucks, that also in AC ( upstair is having AC), this can be your to go place. Stuffs here are quite nice and as the place is always crowded, you can expect fresh food.

We had CHICKEN CHAP, CHICKEN KASA, ROOMALI ROTI, SALAD. These things were OKAY in taste, nothing special.

If you are in Exide More and you smell yumm tikia then its definitely Saima. The Biriyani is good and with less oil. The Rolls are quite good and pretty quickly served. But this place has a big disadvantage of its dining space which is too small to stand or sit comfortably. If you are planning to eat from Saima its better you parcel it

Good things comes in small packages! and  Do not go by the looks -- is Saima!!! There aren't any proper sitting arrangements rather its more clustered...upstairs and downstairs too! Even u might feel puckish because of the pungent smell of the open chicken cooking, while passing down the narrow lane opening to one of the Rabindra Sadan metro outlet near Exide!! But but but as i said above Do not go by its looks!! They serve awesome food..Mughlai is their cuppacino !😉 Saima is my one stop back to back sharp-set ! Whenever im hungry they are a call away... and trust me quick service!!! 😘😎 My quest of one true love for biriyani meets its satisfactory end here!! Its Biriyani is just fab...light and drooling!!! Other than dat... I love their tadka...rezala..and paneer butter masala!! 
Its been years i v been ordering and will continue the saga!😁😁🍲🌮

A tiny joint at the entrance of Rabindrasadan Metro station. One can never miss this outlet by the sheer fragrance of simmering shami tikia which fills up the entire area. Besides biryani, the must try is the shami tikia with romali roti or the tikia roll. I bet, its one of the best. However, if you are really a hygiene freak then this place is not the right choice for you. The seating area both in ground floor and the first floor is very congested, though service is really first. best option will be for take away. One of the best cheap eats in the town.

I dnt have any complaints on preparation time but that was unnecessary burnt and carbon deposited too much in one side made the dish out of Jucy....then ordered laccha Parota and chicken bharta... Bharta taste pretty bad..not at all match with Parota and they even can't suggest anything else...Firni was good.

Visited and entered this restaurant at 3.15pm . This is one of the most economically pocket friendly restaurant in this area, but as per its prices the ambience is suited.
Very good service and the restaurant stays crowded most of the days. It should be present in student favorites..
Heads:5
Orders:
4 Plain Biriyani(6/10)
1 Chicken Biriyani(6.5/10)
2 Mutton kassa(7/10)
3 Laccha Parathas(5.5/10)
1 Paneer Butter Masala(7/10)
1 Salad(10/10): I mean where do you get salad for Rs 15? In bigger restaurants, when you need salad for yourself, the options available results in wastage 

As per the price, the quantity and quality of Biriyani is satisfactory. The Chicken piece was big and good is quantity as well.

Mutton Kassa was Good, but it was not cooked evenly, some parts were soft, some were hard and chewy. It was rich and the blend of spices were fairly good and came out very well.

Laccha Parathas were actually 80% oil free...thus, I wasn't happy with it. It was too dry and thus, needed water to make it go down my throat.

Paneer Butter Masala was just average and some of the pieces were hard and thus, had to be rejected. .
DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

This restaurant is just behind the Rabindra sadan metro station. I have visited this place for a friend's birthday treat. We have ordered Vegetable biriyani, Chicken tandoori butter masala, salad and firni. The biriyani was good. The chicken tandoori was too good and tasty. The quantity of the biriyani was enough. Personally i don't like the taste of the firni. But otherwise our lunch was awesome and in affordable price rate. Like to visit again.
Updating the review after I have taken some food parcel tomorrow for my Birthday celebration from the restaurant. I have taken parcel of 4 plate Veg biriyani, 1 plate Chicken seekh kabab, 1 plate Chicken hot kathi masala and 1 salad worth of 445 rs only. The quantity of the food was sufficient to feed six of us. Biriyani was good. Chicken seekh kabab was very tasty as well as the Chicken hot kathi masala. They served quality foods within cheap budget. All my friends were happy with my treat so I am also very satisfied.

Apparently, you can spend 200 bucks and eat to your stomach's content. If you spend a 100 more, you probably might not have to eat anything else for the whole day.
Saima's Mutton Shami Tikiya is probably the best in Kolkata. If you are thinking I have not tasted Arsalan's special Tikiya, well yes I have. I wouldn't say the biriyani is overwhelming, but considering the fact that you get it at 100 bucks it is delicious. Chicken Chaap and Paratha along with a Shami Tikiya are my favourite orders in Saima.
The ambience and seating should be improved a little.
Special tip: If you have time on your side, try their Murgh Musallam.

Come on now..if you are in Kolkata and love food then you have been here! This is the cheapest for the pocket and provides with mouth watering mughlai cuisine. The eating space is a bit cramped but that can be over looked if the other goodness are considered. Wish they used a bit more good oil for cooking or may be a bit hygienic kitchen as some friends complained of ill health after eating out here. Overall experience was great on my end.

The place is divided into two parts, the take out shop and the upper floor, which is an air conditioned room. The ambience is not delightful. One has to walk with their heads tilted to avoid banging their heads to the stupid beam.
Service is an active one. However, we had to remind the waiter twice about the order. Seating arrangements need heavy improvement. The place is perfect for a take out. Biriyani tasted dry and cold. However, the mutton dishes are an absolute delight. The place is always filled with hungry customers, be it afternoon or evening. I would recommend this place to hungry pedestrians for a quick snack or lunch, without worrying about the bill.

Edit: Rolls are delicious.

Located just beside Rabindranath metro station this place is for those who have very little to spend but also want great food. The place offers moghlai and Indian dishes that to in low a price. The place is very small and is always crowded by office people and students. But dont let the small size and lack of sitting space fool you. this place has lot to offer to the public. The food is awesome to say he least with respect to it's price. My favorite is the chicken briyani, mutton liver, mutton shami tikya, rumali roti and paratha. If you are going for the first time i would suggest trying the mutton liver and chicken bharta with paratha. The only thing that is not going with the restaurant is probably it's quality and the fact that the food is a little oily. But what can you expect for so small price.  

Overall great. Happy Eating. :)

They make one of the most awesome Biriyani in Kolkata. ?120 for both Chicken and Mutton Biriyani. Very reasonable price rather cheap price for such an awesome Biriyani. Though it has Air conditioning upstairs,the place is very congested. But,to get such awesome Biriyani congestion doesn't bother me. I took many of my friends over there, they all loved the Biriyani.

Ever since my friend told me about this place , i didn't wait to try them out. The kebabs were ordinary but their biriyanis are well made.  Side dishes are not upto the mark but rolls are tasty
Visit this place specially for their kathi rolls and biriyani. One can take away home.

Coming to food..we had CHICKEN BIRIYANI which was okay..and CHICKEN TANDOORI..this was nice..we took half plate and it was only 115 bucks..seeing the price i thought the pieces would be small..but when they served i was surprised...both the pieces were quite big and juicy.nicely cooked...if you ever pass by try out their rolls...

And today i ordered sami mutton roll and paneer egg roll for me and  my roomie for home delivery. The speaker over the phone was really rude and the sami mutton roll was disaster coz i got that a yuck smell , it didnt even tasted like mutton. Well, the panner egg roll was nice.
Never try mutton dish there.

Just take a quick look at their menu.You'll hardly find such a pocket friendly food corner in the middle of a metropolitan.Located just near Rabindra Sadan Metro,this place provides good food at a cheapest rate.Don't go here with your loved one,but do visit with your friends at the end of the month.Ambience is a problem,maybe the biggest problem and that apparently doesn't have a solution either.

Located at a corner of one of the busiest parts of the city, this place is a favourite for most people visiting that part of the city on a regular basis. The biryani, the bharta, the kebabs- you name it and you'll get it and you'll love it. Prices are astonishingly low without compromising on the quality a bit! It's crowded almost all the time, but I guess that shows the demand it has to contend with. The take away counters are very efficient and speedy too by the way. If you're ever hungry and you are near Rabindra Sadan metro or the EXIDE more, as it is better known as, (and you're not vegetarian) just pop in for a quick bite. You won't regret, I promise!

Located just outside the gate of rabindra sadan..this small outlet caters to the cravings of people at really low cost.. from rolls to biryanis and frm rumali rotis to chicken tandoori and chaps..
The ambience is nt at all good..although they have a so called ac dining arrangement upstairs..yet its badly arranged and clumsy..
However ignoring the poor nd clumsy ambience of the place.. u cn go there jst for the taste of their rich savoury and very oily mughlai nd tandoor dishes..saima is nt for health concious or faint hearted..the biryanis are comparatively nd surprisingly less oily but a bit dry.. laccha paratha is good nd so is the romali roti..however the side dishes are very oily and rich..specially their famous saima tikka.. the taste would vary according to the dishes.. gv it a try but nothing fancy or brilliant..the highlight point wud b dere price nd no vat is charged.. i wud suggst u stick to rolls nd biryanis nd chaaps.. i found the taste a bit too overpowering nd oily...

It's just outside the exide gate of rabindra sadan metro station.Since it's at such a convenient location the and serves decent north indian food at dirt cheap price..its is always crammed.Their biriyani n mutton korma is good.Heard that their rolls r too good..didn't try them though.But I didn't like the kebabs here..were completely dry n lacked in flavour.

This place serves one of the best biriyanis in a good price. The quality is not compromised and home delivery is made quick. In addition to mutton or chicken biriyani which is an obvious choice..I would suggest any non-veg lover to try the mutton Saima special and chicken resmi kebab.

I really liked this place though i mainly dig into their rolls which is good.But the last time I went there with my family,we ordered chicken biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala.I was really disapointed to see the chicken was half cooked.It was raw inside and the gravy was also not properly done.It was really crowded that day.May be that was the reason.

1) food is good and  not expensive.
2) we can order food here without worrying about money that we are spending here. Because the food is very cheap in price.
3) food is much more tasty in such a less amount. 
4) you should try at least once. 
5) whenever i don't feel like cooking at home we just order food from saima because its not so expensive and tasty .

Yes i am from Shri Shikshayatan..... And of course i spent 11years of my life.. Moving past the aroma of this tawa dats situated right outside the restaurant...
This restaurant had once been burnt totally due to an unfortunate accident... But again came back with a bang thanks to their loyal customers😊
I have i guess tried almost all the dishes on their menu... And have successfully dragged most of my buddies there too. 😊
Today was no different... Went with my school buddy after a muvi n ordered chkn tandoori butter masala, egg biriyani nd rumali... Taste can be easily guessed from d rating. 😃
And the price doesnt burn ur pocket.. The prices are tax inclusive....
They have a.c. Upstairs... But the prices are the same.

This place might be a little small and congested but when it comes to food, Saima never disappoints.. I simply love their Mutton Tikia Chanp with Paranthas.. every time i visited this joint I made sure I ate that.. biriyanis are quite good and so are almost everything they have on the menu. Saima ensures a good meal which is also very easy on pocket. :)

And, just like all the other restaurants serving this cuisine, I don't even bother looking at the chicken items... I've had mutton kasa, mutton saima spcl, and mutton shami tikiya so far!! the shami tikiya can be addictive!! absolutely no complains!! taste buds fulfilled always! more from this place in store!

Worth visiting only for their rolls and biriyani.

Back in my college days i used to frequently visit this place with my friends. This place offers variety of north indian and mughlai food at a very cheap price point. Place is very small and no point talking about ambience. Waiters are usually grumpy and arrogant.

  Their rolls are very good. You can even customize your rolls. I have never seen any place where i can get a "double egg double chicken" roll, but here in saima you actually can. Biriyani is oily but good. Rumali roti and mutton tikka make a good meal. But the other items are no short of disaster. Too much spicy and oily. Most items have same gravy, they just throw in boiled egg, chicken or mutton piece depending on your order. Whenever i had anything other than roll or biriyani here, i had stomach problems later. So if your light on pocket and want to have good roll, biriyani or roti tikka then only visit this place. I would recommend not to try anything else.

This is one such place in Kolkata which is an absolute must for all Biriyani lovers. Though this city boasts of a lot of good biriyani places but this place lies right on the top bracket of the list. They also make delicious Mutton as well as Chicken Chap. Inspite of being there a lot of times, i haven't tried a lot of their dishes which clearly testifies to the fact that how good are they at preparing the Biriyani and the Chap items. The seating area is a concern. It is a lot stuffy and very unhealthy and i would recommend everyone for Take Away. The Prices are really low which makes this place more crowded but the guys are efficient and they will serve your food really quick.

Epic parathas. One of the best I ever had. I have tried a few items only like Sami Mutton Tikiya Roll, Chicken Kassa, Chicken Bharta and Mutton Liver. All of them goes very well with the paratha. Easy on the pocket too. 
The upper floor is air-conditioned but charges a few bucks extra.

This place is located right outside the rabindra sadan metro outlet opposite haldirams. The whiff of mutton and rolls is inviting ,even from the metro escalator that opens out to the side of the shop . The space on front of the shop is very narrow and constricted. So is the space inside the shop . But they make great rolls and the place is ever busy with it's never ending flow of hungry office goers and college students . It used to be a regular haunt for us yatanites during our school / college days ! The aroma of this shop is quite irresistible !!

There was an article on TOI yesterday about the best places to have rolls in Kolkata and after going through the options, we decided to give roll from Saima's this outlet a try!
Location:near the gate of Rabindra Sadan metro station.
Ambience:A very small place,with a few tables,we didnt check the upstairs though.
Food: We ordered two egg rolls. Being on homeopathy, I am not supposed to eat raw onion, which I forgot to tell them. And when I told the man making the rolls, he threw away the onion along with the sauce and all I was given was a paratha with egg! I have never seen such an egg roll with only onion inside. Bad it was! May be the other dishes would be good. But the 1st impression matters a lot to me and I will rather stick to the Saima at Russel Street that being handed over egg paratha!

It serves cheap and delicious food. The ambience is not that overwhelming as the place is really small and remains over-crowded most of the time.
I regret having only 50 bucks in my pocket when I first visited this place. You wont get a proper lunch meal in any restuarant serving Mughlai and Indian food items. But to my surprise, I had my lunch with humongous rumali rotis and yummy egg kasha. 

I would love to visit this place again, preferably, with a lot more money. :P

The place is exactly beside the Exide building side metro outlet. It's small, looks unhygienic (I don't care) and people are swarming the place almost all the time. Saima serves some delicious food items and their lachha paratha is one of the best. The food might contain excess oil but then, this ain't a place for diet conscious individuals. Many might not like the ambiance and the service but then at a place bustling with people, you need to understand that it's not a restaurant or a five star. Go there, order your food, have it, pay and leave.

The demand is so high for a place so small, people are bound to be more occupied. All in all, good food at very reasonable prices..

Well,  for starters,  the place is really small and overcrowded.  The waiters are really ill mannered and disgraceful.  They were busy arguing among themselves as to who will take the order.  Then,  they were forcing everyone to pay bills separately as they needed separate tips.  Rubbish. 
The food was decent with rooms for improvement.  so,  on the whole,  a decent restaurant.

I think by now all of you know the location of this place so i'll come straight to the point. 
Ambience : Well its a very small place so very much congested. A funny thing is that you will not be able to stand straight in their 1st floor section if you have decent hight. But all this does not matter for real foodies.
Food : Well this is where they beat all the odds. Food is just delicious, well coocked. we had mutton biriyani, chicken seekh kabab, chicken butter masala. Didnt like the seekh kababs though, but the other two things were great.
Service : Service is fast enough but they can be warm to their customers.
Pocket pinch : 400/- for two "foodies". 

p.s. I think they charge 5/- extra per dish if you are eating on the 1st floor section which is "airconditioned".

Whenever you get out of the Exide crossing gate of Rabindra Sadan Metro, an aroma of kebab and tikia will drag you to this restaurant, even before you see it. The first thing you notice is the restaurant is very congested with a narrow entry. If you value decor more than food, this is not recommended. However, if you choose to ignore the crowd pressure, a wide range of delicacies with a very pocket friendly rate awaits you. I had been there since I was a student, the mutton tikia and 2 piece rumali roti was my choice of food. The mutton biryani, chicken bharta, chicken curry and egg curry are the dishes I tried. They have nice taste and standard price. One suggestion, try out their first floor, it has moderate space.

Saima, a little place just behind the Sadan metro gate had been a memorable place for me since my college days.very little pocket money, new found freedom, mouth watering good food smells and equally delectable north Indian fare were the most important factors to me in those days which could way put backs certain others like near zero ambience, low ceiling floors, over crowded eatery specially during lunch hours etc.
Not to repeat extreme pocket crunches in those college days,we (me and my frnz) mostly landed up ordering rumali ruti and chicken tikka costing us a bare 30/40rs!!! And the taste was pure heavenly!!!!!! I mean,nothing could be more priceless as fresh and oh so tasty biriyanis /rolls/ everything written on the menu is available at that price to a hungry soul... SAIMA was, is a gastronomic delight till date with fond remembrance of my college days ... Long live!

Saima Restaurant, a small food joint behind d rabindra sadan metro station may go unnoticed but d smell of d food being cooked der wud surely attract ur nose buds. Dat it's being running for more dan 15 years now is testimony enuf to its popularity. Although d ambience is worth not being mentioned, d food ova der is equally delicious and fresh. I wud say fresh coz each and every dish is served piping hot and in a amount worth serving 1 at dat price. Recently i had chicken biriyani(100) and chicken kassa(60) over der which left me wanting to come back once again. and i was again der after 3 days and had roomali roti and chicken chap which wer equally lip-smacking..

well, d rolls over der r most bought by customers. d chicken used in d roll is quite juicy and d parathas very crunchy without d use of too much oil. Now i've been der 6-7 times but found d place overcrowded each and every tym and dat too wd very standardized people, thus proving its popularity among every class of people. Its gud if u pack d food fr home instead of having it der but each tym i go der i cudnt resist myself from having it over der. d phirni over der is a must-have. D service is very fast. As long as d food is gud, i dnt quite mind d small congested place and d unhygiene of d place. a gud value fr money if u want to eat something very filling in ur loose pocket money. just LOVE going der over and over again.

Saima, a small outlet beside Rabindra Sadan, one of the cheapest and offers good quality Mughlai food. Have take away quite some time, and every time they were up to the mark. Their Chicken Chanp are very tasty, and priced as low as Rs 70.

Went to the Film festival couple of days ago and after that we wanted to try some roti and mutton and suddenly this restaurant came to mind. Located just behind the Rabindra sadan metro station. When we came to the restaurant it was full. So we had to share table and ordered chicken seekh kebab, rumali roti and mutton saima special. Seekh kebab was not that good.  Mutton was nicely cooked and the meat was very tender. But the place was very unhygienic to eat. So it's better to pack the food for home. Also the behaviour of the staffs were pathetic. A good restaurant for take away.

Saima, located at just Exide/ Rabindra sadan junction beside the metro, is one of those places which reminds us of old times- sharing tables, superfast waiters with more hurry than you, noisy and khao-aur-nikal lo types. So, you speak of ambiance, it is a busy one, with small section at ground floor, and then at upper floor, a short ceiling, and closely placed tables. Recently introduced AC in upper section. You cannot just relax and eat here, you need to wrap up first. :-) However, the food is pretty good, and I have tried this many times, with rolls, kebabs, bharta, liver fry, biriyani.. they are all good and will not disappoint you. Take away the food if you can. And also try the firni. Highly pocket friendly.

Have passed by this place about a million times but didn't try it out until very recently when we were nearby and decided to try it out after confirming that the place has an a.c section ! Honestly that didn't help much as the ceiling is too low and we had to share the table with another couple. My friend suggested the Chicken Kosha, which he had with rotis. As I was famished I decided on the Chicken Biryani and Chicken Kosha. The biryani was simply made, nothing to rave about....but at the given price, quite okay. The Kosha was indeed nicely done, although a tad bit over salted, I felt. Overall, a place to go if you are on a  budget. Yes, the wonderful smell can draw you in too ! :)

Best Biriyani in Kolkata... Kababs are also quite good.their mutton dishes are also just superb(Mutton Saima Special)!! The location is also very good to find the place easily...
Just near Rabidra Sadan Metro Station.
Those who are watching the calorie should avoid the place... for others it is a must try...
It is value for money. If you want to taste Kolkata's Briyani, you must have visit once here.

Sami roll is also a special mention. Bt adding to it the atmosphere is not good.  Would look ahead for improvement

Like I've said in many of my previous reviews, I do not judge a food joint by it's ambiance. 
One of the the dingiest restaurants in the city. But if you want to have a quick biriyani, then this is the place to be. The biriyani has no distinct taste. But hey, for around 80 bucks, you get more than what you bargained for.
Oh and I think the rolls stand out. Absolutely amazing rolls you get in this place. The chicken chnaap is pretty decent. 
I like to have a plate of biriyani, chicken chnaap, salad and a bottle of cold drink. Pretty decent. :)

Dont know how many-a-times have been to saima whenever I do not have cash and i am super hungry. Whenever its chowringhee, i feel the dire need of dropping to saima, mqy be for a roll. The mutton roll which finishes off very fast is my dead favourite. I bet except for nizam , its hard to beat the kathi rolls of saima. I am not a mughlai lover. But at saima i do feel that the biryani is exceptionally well made. Its tasty, less oily abd superb. I can nearly eat a plate lof it  thats the achievement of saima because I stop gorging once I have reached to half a plate of biryani. Along with the mutton biryani, the chicken chaap tastes gorgeous , and then a salad to team it up with. The mutton tikia and the tandoori roti is a deadly combo. the chicken bharta n the phirni. No elaborate decor. Nothing. Yet the food speaks for itself.

This is a tiny little place behind the Rabindra Sadan metro. You can get the smell of chicken whenever you pass by this place...mmm...... :)
Different people have different opinions about this place. I simply love this place! It's not one of the cleanest or coziest restaurants in Kolkata, but this is a place where you can stuff yourself with chicken and mutton within 100 bucks. Being a meat lover, that's Heaven on Earth for me. 

Let me start with the rolls. The Chicken roll is great! The Veg roll is good too! The Mutton roll is lovely! But what really stands out is the Saami roll. It's like a tikia roll, but it's different. Its better, it's stuffed with chopped meat. Its brilliant!!!! You have to try it to understand.

Other than that you get biryanis, rumali rotis and brilliantly made laccha parathas. Along with that you have have the saima tikka of course. A piece of mutton tikka with the mutton rezala oil poured all over it. Simply mouth watering O:)
Egg tarka, Chicken chap and Liver curry are other delicacies they serve. 

If you are a meat lover and don't mind oily food. This is the place for you. (y)

The place is very easy to locate its in the ground floor of the exide building. Its is a quick eat joint so do not expect fine dining experience. If you have little money to spent and need stomach full mughlai food this is the place you shoud visit. 
Mutton Sami Kabab with Roomali Roti
Chicken/Mutton Biriyani
are worth trying. 
The quantity is huge. 4 Ponits are because of Price and Quantity

Update :: Don't order take away, they sometimes provide bad quality in take way.

The fact that it is almost hidden behind the Sadan Metro Station made me look at it as one of those shady places, till i tried their food sometimes back. Chicken kabab and Chicken bharta were the 1st two items I had ordered due to its proximity to my office. Decent taste and it encouraged me to go for the biryani. There is no point comparing this places with your typical Arsalan or Royal (two of my favorite places). This is a different price range altogether, and taste-wise i will not mind trying it couple of times more. But I have a serious issue with hygiene in this place because my food did not look like it was cooked in a clean place. The 2nd time i tried i was even more convinced after i found a feather in my packet. Therefore a sure miss from my side for this restaurant. Whatever score i have given is based on the taste of the dishes i have tried.

It have been ages we friends go to this place for a pocket friendly meals. It was all fine. But last time when we went there some days ago, we ordered paneer biriyani and mutton saima spl. The mutton was so hard that we couldn't tear it apart. And there's one more thing i.e their A.C. In that scroching heat of may, their A.C was not working properly.
So, it can be said that there food quality and services have take their position down. Saima was not like this, there service needs to be upgraded.

The second you step on the escalator at the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station, an insane smell of Meat and Mughlai Spices Overpower you. The food is to die for and I have been having their Mutton Sami Rolls since the past 8 years from the time I used to get out of  my coaching classes and devour their rolls. It still retains a lot of its old charm, Amazing Mutton Sami Kebabs and Rolls, Soft Rumali Rotis and Fragrant Biryani.

Though the first floor is AC, it pretty much cramped wid low roof, etc, but this place is a must to have a good lunch or dinner fr a reasonable rate in this over-priced posh neighbourhood. 
N.B. Chicken Roll from this place is a must I would say. GOTTA try them if you haven't as yet.

Well there was a gap in between as was not in town for some time but today when I ordered after few months my feeling was oh its exactly the same no change in taste or quantity and this is what I love about Saima. No changes good food in affordable price. Best Chicken Biryani & Paneer Biryani.

Tremendously cheap..In fact, one of the cheapest restaurant, I ever have been to. And the best part is, in spite of the eye-catchingly low rates on the card, they don't compromise with the quality of the food. Ahh! Still can smell the liver and tikya! Awesome! Keeping aside the only negative point about Saima, which is the location, indeed an over-congested, that too being in behind of the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station, otherwise, it's a big thumb up!!! A place to must have an experience of!

Okay,so I have been to this place for more than 30 times in the last five years and have tried nearly everything in their menu.What prices you see today is a result of increase in prices,as much as three times in the last two years!!
That being said,this is a typical roadside eatery,but the taste is pretty good,as well as the food quality.You will get good value for money over here,and all the dishes are quite well.The biryani is good,spicy and cheap too (unless you compare its quality with the Arsalans and Aminias!).
You may find the parathas tad oily (though not always) but rotis are soft and good to eat.Among the non veg side dishes chicken bharta is good,and in veg you can try the aloo butter masala,its really great.
From 1pm-2:30pm approx. one will find it very difficult to get a place here,the visitors mostly being students and office goers.
Service is prompt and good.

this place has pros and cons almost equally weighed 
if you have come to catch a film at nandan or to enjoy ur evening at mohor kunja or to cherish victoria ( pegi 18 ) 
and you are not too keen to spend a lot .........Saima is the place you should go to 
if you go through the escalators opening of rabindra sadan metro you are bound to sniff out the mouth watering aroma from saima  
the ambiance is substandard . low roof . over crowded .... the waiters are not very responsive 
i sometimes doubt their sense of hygiene
but once you see the menu you will be all revved up    
i had the mutton tikiya  with rumali roti and mind you i cant stand the smell of mutton ...but i wdnt even notice it was mutton if my friend didnt tell me 
it was so well cooked and it was so amazingly delicious   it was a 5/5 for me and it cost only 23 rupees
it was so tasty i cajoled my primly girlfrnds into the congested food joint ... they too were flabbergasted by its zaika  we had a veg frnd she took paneer butter masala which was very substandard ..........
the biryani i have heard is ok 
many people have complained they had digestion problems after dining here and that the food is rancid or not healthy 
i personally had no such issues yet

This place is positioned at the Rabindran Sadan crossing, but not easy to spot. I have been noticing this diner from my early age. But only few years back I did get the hap to visit this place. The place is set on both 1st and 2nd floor which you would not understand by looking; the second floor’s roof is shorter than normal standard, that you will find difficulties while walking. 

As my stomach was etching for food I placed my bet on Chicken Biryani and Chicken Kassa. As I started to gobble my food I found it tastier than I expected. Biryani was not that oleaginous as you find sometimes in famed food joint. They serve ample amount of rice (Biryani) that is adequate for single person. The chicken (Biryani) was very delicate and submerged in spices. The red color Chicken Kassa was light on your diet that you would not feel guilty about it. 

The stewards are very fast and eager to help you. I have noticed a middle aged man (stewards) who always hangs a pretty smile on his face and cracks jokes around you. I have already visited them few times now because quality food and reasonable price. If you are hungry and also thinking about your pocket, this is the place you should be.

A wonderful place for good food at really reasonable prices. Every time I went to this place, I made sure I ordered Biriyani. The flavors of the food here are awesome. And their location and prices serve as a cherry on top. Also, for quick munches, they make wonderful rolls which are tasty and filling beyond doubt. After having a hearty meal you can finish things off with a Firni. Keeping in mind the exponential rise in prices all around, this place is an absolute delight. The only downside is that it's not at all spacious. It gets difficult to get a place during peak hours. But I'll say that the wait is totally worth it.

Have been to Saima many a times and it has seriously NEVER been a letdown.
The BIGGESt usp is their tad cheap price which is affordable for any crowd.

As school students, with a basic pocket money of 400-500, we friends huddled away to Saima after some shopping or maybe a quick chat.
It is easy on the pockets yet they do not compromise with the quality of food.
On the ground floor, you will see an open tawa and kadai, and dishes are being prepared.

Respite is the first floor where they have installed ac and hence saves the mass from such robust heat outside.
Ambience is not be considered here. Its a basic mughlai roadside restaurant.

I love their chicken biryani, chaap and kebabs. Pretty nice. And yes, pocket-friendly.

You will see bunch of people swarming around this little eatery and most of the tyms college or school pals.
Hence, I would recommend Saima if you're a bit tight on the pockets.

Happy eating guys,
Cheers! :)

I think it would look clear if I make a list of what I feel and think of this place.

Positive:
1. Biriyani, biriyani, and biriyani. I have had their biriyani so many times and never experienced any problem with the food.
2. They are also popular for other Mughlai dishes. Especially Tandoori, Chicken Chap, Shami Tikia, and their famous rolls.
3. Cheaper than many other places, even when it is located in such a prime area (exide crossing).
4. Fast service. I generally don't have food here. Ask them to pack it and they do that within few minutes.

Negative:
1. Too much crowded. If you are attracted by the smell of this place and curiously try to find the source, you're stuck amidst people who have no hurry.
2. While their service is good but the way they behave with their customers is not up to the mark. They should treat their customers with more respect.
3. I would suggest try not to have the food here. It's a nightmare if you are tall and have to climb upstairs to find a table. The roof is so low that you will have to walk like an ape man while you are on the 1st floor.

KICKASS with a K! This place tucked away in a corner beside Rabindra Sadan Metro cooks some of the BEST mughlai dishes in fine style! Quite disturbing for the casual passer-by hurrying to catch the metro, who coughs uncontrollably at the strong smell and smoke coming from the open kitchen which is in front of the eatery. It is this tantalizing smell that led me to this place. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP really (especially considering this is one of the ‘main’ areas in Kolkata),they have a dish for every budget, and they deliver food to the nearest homes and offices too! I often stop by this lovely place, almost always bustling with activity, especially when I visit the British Council. I ask you all, WHO in this whole wide world would charge ONLY Rs25 for Chicken Liver, Rs8 for Plain Rice, Rs12 for Moong Dal fry, Rs15 for mixed vegetable, Rs20 for Tarka, Rs16 for Firni, Rs23 for Mutton Shami Tikia and  the like, and YET cook to certain hygiene levels?

My favorite here is the Firni, romali roti, Murg Musalim, Chicken Tandoori, Mutton Shami Tikia and Chicken Chap. By the thought of these, I’m already salivating and wet my keyboard…and yes, upstairs they have a window ac cooling the place. Here, the charges are marginally higher. Damnable if it’s summer.

P.S: If you’re a gastronomic, stay away from the mughlai dishes, and settle for something less rich. The others- INDULGE! But, I must warn you, this place redefines ‘spicy food’, so be aware of what you order…

Been there for a huge no. of times. Food here is strictly Mughlai.... you know, Biriyani, Chaap et al. Sometimes a tad bit towards extremely oily. Won't say I am head over heels for the food here, but still like it quite a lot. The actual problem in this place is the place itself. It's small.... wait a minute.... Micro... to be precise. And highly claustrophobic at that. The major seating area is on the upper floor of the duplex, and there you cannot stand straight since the ceiling is very low. Plus, the crowd ain't good all the time, although couples and families do frequent the place. Seating is highly limited, and you'll have to share tables with others in busy hours (read: most of the day). And, the place is visibly shabby. 

You can very well give this joint a miss. however, you might consider kidnapping the cook (just kidding!!!!) who makes delicious dishes.

This place is located behind one of the outlets of  Rabindra sadan metro.I have been to this place a number of times.The place is very small and it is very crowded almost all times of the day.
The food they serve is very tasty indeed but very oily.The quantity of the food is also very good.The prices are very cheap compared to other places.Tasty food at cheap prices is the thing about the place that keeps it going so strong!
There are two sections,one upstairs which is airconditioned and one downstairs which isnt airconditioned and is very crowded.There is nothing called ambience as such.The staff are not at all well trained.But they serve the food real quick.
In spite of these,I find the food here quite tasty and I dont mind oily food once in  a while.So I have dropped here quite a few times for a quick meal and this is a place I quite enjoy.
Still,the place can and probably should have quite a few improvements.At least they should try to improve the hygiene and cleanliness.Other areas where there is room for improvement include the ambience,the seating arrangement,the service etc.
In short if you are not too concerned about ambience and really oily food ( atleast once in a while) and you enjoy tasty food at quite affordable price then this place is certainly worth a visit.

Hidden just behind the AJC Bose end of the Rabindra Sadan metro station, this place is famous for it's Mughlai fare. The Biryanis and Chicken , Mutton dishes including the Kassa, Chaap and Qorma have made it a prominent name and the relative affordability of the items make it a hit destination for foodies. Portions served are average. The egg dishes are not suggested, hilariously though they are bunched under the "Anda ke Funda" section. The vegetable dishes are nice but try to stick to the Non Veg. Special suggestion : Paneer Biryani. The Kebabs are quite good as I had heard.
The Sami roll and Paneer Roll should be your top picks. 

Its primarily a takeaway and most people order the fast foods. There are two tables downstairs but they're always full. The restaurant section on the 1st floor is essentially a large storage room in a half floor that they've crammed with the maximum number of tables. It's poorly ventilated, cramped and cluttered. Add to that the overflowing people at all hours of the day, the low ceiling hitting your head at every turn and temperatures such as inside a hothouse and you'll get the picture. The food takes time to arrive with a small kitchen and a narrow staircase where I twice tripped. The waiters are a bit rude having to work under these circumstances. Sit and eat at your own discretion, especially if you have claustrophobia. 

Chakraborty Tip : I appreciate the the fact that they let you have a seat inside even if you've ordered a roll. Many places don't do this.

I could see some really positive reviews about this place. Well the aroma of the biryani attracted me one particular day,but as soon as i stepped into this place,the roof banged on my head,and i was like Eww,where am I? The aroma soon turned into an intolerable nauseating smell and we were forced to share a table with strangers. The ambience is filth personified! Just like some foodies,even i was happy to see the menu but once i placed the order and waited a bit,another man came and said they've forgotten our order and we ordered again,chkn bharta with tandoor roti. The tandoor rotis were way too elastic,my teeth got a good exercise. The chicken bharta had some chunks of chicken and egg crumbs immersed in a bed of oil which probably was rancid. I guess some of the foodies are really high on immunity,but i got terrible stomach ailments soon after. i am not ready to pay low at the cost of my health. I just wish the rating scale started from zero.

You will never hate or love the place. Saima resides in the grey area. Although the smell of biryani emanating from the kitchen of the unkempt ground floor can be appealing to potential customers, the restaurant can be bothersome to the pedestrians, especially those to or fro the Rabindra Sadan Metro station.

The place is generally brimming with people (more than its capacity). Taking the steep staircase, you reach the air-conditioned floor with a particularly low ceiling. The service can be quick, lagged, friendly or impersonal. You will be rushed to choose something because there are people in queue.

They make good Chicken Rolls. The biryani, although on the oilier side, is quite tasty. For 65 bucks a plate for Chicken Biryani, it is the best it can get. They also serve Plain Biryani for 40 rupees, allowing you to spend more on side dishes of your choice. The Chicken Kebabs (especially Tikka) are worth a shot. Unfortunately, they botch all the Kebab dishes with gravy. The gravy does not compliment the Kebabs (yes, they seem to serve the same one for all of them).

Granted Saima is not the best biryani-maker nor is the environment ambient, but they do make good biryani, at half the going rate and still manage to provide an air-conditioner. I say, hell yeah!

Well for Saima nothing to talk about ambiance, entertainment, quality...nothing. It's a HOP IN...EAT N GO type of place just outside Rabindra Sadan metro station adjacent to Exide building. Try their lachha paratha with chicken/mutton masala/kasa. I never tried their Rolls but seen people eagerly waiting to get one for them. If you really want to have something tasty and fast around Rabindra sadan area go for it.

It is an ideal place to eat for school college students; the pocket pinch is light but the food, if you are careful with your selection, is decent.

The rolls are very good; the parathas are thick and rolled in folds like a lachha. The biriyanis, even at such low prices, are quite good. Though I would like it to be a little less oily, the tastes are in the right place. The butter naans had absolutely no butter on it whatsoever; we had initially thought the waiter had messed up our order and given us plain naan instead. Moreover, the bottom of the naan was dusted with raw flour. The pieces of chicken, be it in kebabs or biriyani or the gravy dishes, are perfectly cooked; when you chew it falls apart in your mouth. But the mutton- and my only point of reference is the mutton biriyani I had once- was quite tough. The buttery gravy dishes don't taste good at all. I tried the tikka butter masala and the reshmi butter masal, and found the taste to be very peculiar. Not only was it bland but it did not do the name (tikka/reshmi 'butter' masala) any justice due to the apparent lack of butter. There were also some incongruent ingredients, maybe mustard or something like that, which gave it a strange taste and a grainy texture. So, my advice is to order biriyani and sides that do not have 'butter' to their names. The chicken chap and paratha/tandoori roti is another combination that has never failed me.

The place is unhygienic to put it mildly. I once saw a small cockroach flitting across our table. Service is appalling! If you order anything apart from the biriyanis and the chap, be prepared to wait for a good fifteen minutes. The waiters are quite rude and would non-chalantly wander about, chatting with each other; you'd be lucky if you get a glass of water without asking a few times. They bring the plates of food piled on top of another and I don't like my food touching the bottom of another plate especially at a place where the least concern is the hygiene. They are so slow with the bill, me and my friends usually have to get up and pay it at the manager's table. Also, that is the only time the waiter will come smiling and wringing hands saying 'Please visit again'. I confess that I hate when the bill returns more than five rupees because I wouldn't want to pay any more than that as tips.

Location: When one is in the stairs of rabindra Sadan metro station one must have thought that from where the awesome soothing fragrance is coming, that's where you discover Saima Restaurant. Located opposite to haldirams chowringhee road just on the left side of the rabindra sadan metro station. 

Pros: 1) Very cheap prices. One cannot find such prices in any of the restaurants. 
2) Always crowded which makes people think what's there inside? Attracts customers basically.
3) The awesome smell of the delicious chicken chap wins the heart of the daily metro travellers to either stand by for a roll or a chap whatsoever. 
4) Caters to a large number of population and daily travellers.
5) Suitable for those who are very hungry and are not carrying a large amount of cash with them.  


Cons: 

1) Very unhygienic
2) Very oily food 
3) Very bad ambience- no efforts are taken to improve it
4) staffs are not that literate and persuade people for tips after eatout. 
5) No efforts are being given to renovate it. It's like a business running for earning profit and not referring to the health of the customers. Basically very customer unfriendly. Maybe, they have forgotten ' Iron law of responsibility'. 
6) uncleaned plates, plastic chairs, small area occupied,  messed up floors, openly cooked chicken chaps which can cause insects or Mosquitos or lizards to peep inside causing various hazardous problems to the customers


Food quality- less than average. Delicious food- yes as they use lot of oil and dalda be it roll or biriyani. Prices- very cheap and very affordable. Basically, one should try it when they are broke or are too hungry. :)

A good place for having rolls. The chicken roll and egg sami roll were tasty and the biriyani was also good. Chicken Biriyani is well done. Staff are polite and half of the time this place remains crowded. Prices are reasonable and ambience is okay. 
Chicken Tikka Kebab was also scrumptious along with rumali roti.
Once I had taken away tandoori, chicken korma and plain naan, all were very delectable.
Overall a good restaurant.
I would rate 3.5 for SAIMA RESTAURANT.

Saima may be a menace to Metro commuters coming out of the Rabindra Sadan Metro station, but the food they serve is good, and a couple of their rolls are excellent. It is a small, cramped eatery on the ground floor of Exide House with a few tables, and also has a small section on a mezzanine where diners can sit and eat.

Perennially crowded, Saima is well known for its rolls. The one roll I order on a regular basis is the Mutton Saami Roll, where the mutton preparation put inside the roll is excellent. The parathas used in the rolls are also quite well made.

The rice and meat dishes that need to be eaten sitting down are remarkably cheap. Most of the dishes are average, but on the better side. Orders can get muddled up because of the large crowd, so diners are warned to keep an eye on what lands on their plate. The waiters are polite, though, and can suggest items provided the place is not too crowded and they can take time over an order.

A good place to drop in for a quick meal or even a snack. However, one wishes they keep the place a little cleaner, and also not encroach onto the pavement as they have currently done.

The first time I had been to this place was when I was just a kid. My brother would treat me with rolls from this place while returning from Nandan or Shishir Mancha. The scenario is still quite the same with the bustling crowd, fast delivery and the smell of mouth-watering food. The rolls are cheap and tasty.Their parathas are very ordinary. Recently i tried out their biriyani and it was a BIG surprise! It was so light and subtle with no trace of oil or dalda! I would surely ask health conscious foodies to try it out :)  Would like to have their food again. For now they get a 3.5 (Warning: There's a total lack of space!)
There were many more visits to this place. Solely for one reason; their biryani. Almost everything is perfect about it!

I remember my friends coaxing me to come along with them to Saima Restaurant almost 6 years back from now. We ended up revisiting this joint a lot many times after the maiden trip  during our undergrad days because you can't really keep a Bengali away from savory Mughlai if it is within his/her accessible limits. Though the full name bothered me initially as well as the crowd and then the horribly low ceiling upstairs along with the grimy plates and dingy interiors, my prissiness didn't last long as the aroma of the delectable kebabs and mouthwatering biriyani invaded my nostrils.I must say that much of  the absense of my unwillingness to eat at roadside shacks / truck drivers' dhabas nowadays during long trips was inspired from those trips to Saima :D

Saima is a North Indian restaurant with two outlets, one at Little Russel Street and another at Chowringhee Road behind Rabindra Sadan Metro Station. The first time I visited this food joint, I was not so disappointed as I was when I visited the Little Russel Street outlet. The ambience there is not appealing, but the restaurant has a small but proper seating arrangement on its first floor. I was there with one of my friends on my way home from office. When we reached there, there was only a couple dining there. So, among the four remaining tables there, we took one. We placed an order for Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Bharta. Prices are reasonable - Biriyani @ Rs. 80 only is unimaginable nowadays. Our orders were served almost instantly. The biriyani was not as awesome as Arsalan or Zeeshan - so so. Chicken Bharta was quite good, but nothing awesome; nothing to talk about and not too appealing. This outlet did not disappoint me at least because you can't expect something out of the world at such reasonable rates.

Being satisfied with Saima at Little Russel Street, within a few days of visiting there, I planned to check out their Chowringhee Road branch which I have often found overcrowded with people while returning home from office in the evening. I was there with the same company. We moved upstairs to sit and dine. As we were upstairs, the ambience shocked me. A food joint cannot have such unhygienic ambience, dirty tables, untidy walls and an awful ceiling. But still I saw more people here than Little Russel Street (perhaps due to the location). We placed the same order here as well, but when the food was served - my god, I lost my appetite! No properly cleaned plates and spoons and the taste was appalling - a total waste of money. We wasted a lot of the food as it was just impossible for us to have food at such an untidy food joint. However, it was our fault we choose this place, so we had to pay the bill. When we paid the bill and were about to leave, the staff member who served us almost forced us to pay him tips. They are not only untrained and unfriendly staff but also ill mannered.  This dine-out was a shocking experience for me.

I love this place. And not just because its fast, tasty and smells like heaven. Its because, every time I get out of the Rabindra Sadan metro, my sense of smell is thoroughly tantalized by smells emerging from this place. 

Following my nose, I go inside this super-crowded place and order chicken liver, rolls, chicken chaap and biryani. Each item is absolutely on the money and reasonably priced, to say the very least. Also, they deliver if you live nearby (evil manic grin!). 

The only reason why I will not give this place 5/5 is possibly because the sit-down area is dirty. However, totally compensated by the service which is SUPER FAST despite the crowd. If you are tired of the biryanis from the top joints, try this.

If you have ever been to the Rabindra Sadan metro station and exited through the exide end, you know that this place is one of the most commercially viable projects in the region. You can feel the rich aroma of their food lingering a hundred feet down below the earth in the metro station. As you walk up and feel the stomach muscles making their presence known, you exit the station practically into the restaurant - it is just three to four feet from the gate.

If you are in a hurry, you grab a bite of their delicious, soft and meaty rolls. If you have some time, you step in with an excited bladder that's waiting to be served piping hot Mughlai food. You close your eyes to the dirty, dismal decor and the pathetic ambience and wait for your order to be served in five minutes. You are tall, and you have to bend your head inside before you get a seat, but you don't mind because you are hungry.

The Mutton Tikka arrives, with the full glory of a Golden Biryiani and naans. You gorge into it - without looking at the broken chips of the plates and the greasy fan that's rotating barely inches above your head. Within seconds you are done, and if you're lucky, you might get the Haleem as well. Now you get up, pay the modest bill and bend your head again to walk up outside this constricted place.

If you can turn blind, this is worth it. Cheap, good food.. what more?
But if you look for more relaxed ambiences with courteous, attentive staff .. don't step in! you'll hate it.
In other words, take your food home if you can and you won't regret it.

I have been here few times. This is a unique restaurant where most dishes tastes almost similar to each other. The alurdom and egg curry have identical taste , so does a few chicken dishes... Service is quick. Only biriyani and chaap is worth trying here. Rolls are also good and are hopefully the most ordered item here. I love the tadka too, especially the veg one. Place is congested but the location is good.

Though This resturant does not have luxurious space, The quality of the foods are A class. And In This place is really So cheap and good. The special biriyani is the one of the best dish there. The mutton liver is also good.

But If you really want to eat something in some little budget I will suggest Saima As one of the best resturant.... So when ever you are in Rabindra Sadan just don't forget to eat once at Saima.

The ambience sucks. The restaurant upstairs is only 5 feet in height. But the food is amazing. The kebabs, chaap, rumali roti and the greasy biriyani are just awesome. I have been coming to this place for more than five years. Even the rolls are heavenly. Must try is sami roll which is thick and filling. Screw ambience. Come here only for the food.

When you are at rabindra sadan area and you feel hungry and you are in a little hurry, dont think anything, run towards saima. It is very easy to find, just beside rabindra sadan metro station and under the exide building. This restro does not have a great atmosphere but the service and food quality is very good. Saima also goes very easy with your pocket. 
When I was a college goer, I was a frequent visitor to this restaurant. I am telling you a few combinations to have over here.
1. Rumali roti n mutton tikia
2. Paratha n mutton chaanp(mutton kosha is also good)
3. Chicken biriyani with mutton korma

And please dont forget to taste the shaahi haalim in the ramjan season. Its very very delicious.

i dunno about others but i love it. the food is cheap, and for that kind of money what they are giving you is quite nice. the biriyani is oilier than others that i have tried but still i love it. i love the shami kabab, chicken bharta and the chicken chaap. Of course when you compare these with the kind of food you would get at Aminia or Alibaba, you would be disappointed. the ambiance is not good i admit but still if you want good mughlai cuisine and you are low on budget, you can easily drop in.

Prepare to rub your butt and plates with other people while you eat, oops, try to eat! Food? Have the same from esplanade or gariahat footpaths, and save yourself the misery.. And man, cleanliness is so not their thing! They gave me my food on a plate which looked like one collected from the maidan dumpster and hasn't been washed.. You woudnt wanna touch it, forget eating the food.. Overall, awful! If I could given it a rating of -1, I would've!

If you look for ambiance this is definitely not your place at all. The staff is also not very well trained. However the only saving grace for this place is the very decent mughlai food it serves specially the mutton chanps. The rolls are also pretty good. The place is very cheap and is targeted for the daily commuters and office workers of the locality. But if you are on the move and want to grab a bite in Exide area this is definitely the best place.

I consider, I am ready to pay up little extra to attain a good quality instead. I strictly do not like to compromise with quality. And if you really agree with me, do not dare to dine at this place. 

A low price is an ok debate. But you should know how a place can sell Biryani with lesser price if they are not compromising with its quality. And the truth is, they are. I am not stating that, the chicken or mutton piece on your platter is not a real one, but just don't eat, analyze ! You will find the real answers, if you push yourself little hard.

Nothing is great about this place! Not so hospitable staff, bad ambiance, and a congested place that bites you till you leave this place. 

Overall, this place is only good to grab a roll on run.

The place is quite hidden. The food is quite nice. As one steps down the Sadan metro station and enters the gully, the smell from it's Chaap counter will surely bring you in. Although the biriyani is nothing exceptional, but at the given price I love it. Prices are what makes this place good. Chaap and kebabs are recommended. Go for the simple and easy options.
