This was my third visit to drunken monkey and i really liked the watermelon lemon electrolyte. But this time, it didnt maintain to the same quality. There was hardly any watermelon but lots of lemon and it was watered down. 
Management please look into the quality.

Great place with budget friendly pricing. The nutella shake was thick, tasty & had the perfect quantity. This place severely underrated. Definitely recommended.

People r nowadays gtin more health conscious n places like drunken monkey is gtin a boost.. Place is Cool and music being played at d background wid many games available at the table to spnd good time with ur frnds.... Cumin to the menu it has many shakes, smoothies, juices, coffee's n other milk n water base drinks.. red velvet shake is a must try.. v also ordered kiwi smoothie bt wasn't upto d expectation.. Irish coffee was very much like normal cold coffee.. They didn't had most of the seasonal fruits n v culd not hv anything from dat so d management plz note this... Among sandwiches v tried paneer Tikka n baby corn n it was really yum but der r very less option to chose from.. der r many vegetable shakes for those who like all dis varieties... Must visit dis place n vl try few more variety of shakes...

Great place. Numerous varieties of shakes available. Easy location to spot on the main road. A really cool hangout place for some off time. Games like UNO, Crossword, Truth and Dare Jenga etc. on tables keep you busy on the chairs. Shakes doesnt let you down either.

Well, with increasing pollution, food adulteration, work-stress, urbanization and what not, physical and mental health of people have definitely taken a back seat. To counter these, people often resort to visiting gymnasiums, doing yoga, working out etc., but often miss out the most important of them all ‚Äì i.e. eating healthy!

With eating healthy, the new peril which emerges is ‚ÄúTASTE‚Äù! The lay man often perceives that healthy will not be tasty and vice-versa! To people of this class, I hereby introduce the latest health bar ‚ÄúDRUNKEN MONKEY‚Äù!

The name does confuse you and this seems just another health-threatening hookah bar or lounge but in reality, it‚Äôs just the opposite! Based conveniently at Sarat Bose Road, Lansdowne, it‚Äôs just a 2 minute walk from Minto park crossing!

Ambience is definitely soothing, but some background instrumental songs will enrich it further! All seats are wooden styled with fine polish and walls decorated preaching the monkey and the place accommodates 24 odd heads! Few board games like chess / jenga / Uno etc. are available to keep you engaged!

They offer all arrays of health drinks one can ask for including:-

(i) Fresh fruit smoothies and shakes

(ii) Detox smoothies

(iii) Vegetable smoothies

(iv) Protein shakes and hydrators

(v) Coffees

(vi) Meal smoothies

They don‚Äôt add a single drop of water, nor a pinch of sugar to their shakes and smoothies, a complete rarity in cafes! So, in short, they impart you simply the NATURAL taste!

Apart from these, they offer a limited but decent sandwich range also to munch upon ‚Äì paneer tikka sandwich, baby corn sandwich and the like!

I relished the below items:-

(i) Sultan dry fruit shake ‚Äì Indeed, in line with thy name, this was the ‚ÄúSULTAN‚Äù ‚Äì a great blend of assorted dry fruits in milk ‚Äì figs, cashews almond, raisins etc. ‚Äì drink a little and munch the rest!

(ii) Pomegranate ‚Äì Fresh pomegranate juice, served thick!

(iii) Sexy Spinach ‚Äì Spinach blended with cucumber and green grapes, purest of the pure juice, a good deal, which will improve further once the winters arrive and better quality vegetables are available!

(iv) Brownie Nutella ‚Äì This goes down as my all-time favourite, Nutella blended with brownie, sip and munch at the same time, the chocolate sauce dressing gives this one a special touch, much better than the shakes we have at Keventers or the like!

(v) Black currant shake ‚Äì A winner as usual, who does not love black currant!

(vi) Eternal sunshine ‚Äì It counts as 1 of the best ‚ÄúDETOX‚Äù agents, a decent combo of cucumbers, mint, apple and lots of spinach!

(vii) Corn flakes meal shake ‚Äì Indeed, this one is a complete meal ‚Äì cornflakes blended with dry fruits as well as fruits in milk base, it‚Äôs a myth as to how the corn flakes crumbs stay crispy inside the liquid! I bet 1 full bottle of this is sufficient enough to satiate a behemoth hunger also!

(viii) Baby corn sandwich ‚Äì Great vegetable content, small baby corn pieces ‚Äì served with regular tomato ketchup after fine grilling, out of the world!

Their serving size is more than 400 ml, so 1 bottle might be enough for the faint-stomach! Prices are perfectly commensurate with what they offer ‚Äì starting Rest. 139 /- Service is exceptional and you don‚Äôt often see the captain of a place running helter-skelter to attend customers and trying hard to impart the best experience! A big thank you to Pallavi Sharma for an experience of this calibre and chef Prabir and others for this effort!

To sum up, this one stands out as a health bar in the true sense! Their working hours vary from 9 AM till 12 midnight ‚Äì my personal preference would be a breakfast since this is the most important meal of the day, although, one might prefer a lunch / a dinner or even a casual visit for a coffee. They are upcoming with their hot beverage collection shortly before the impending winters and currently offer only cold selections! I strongly suggest a walk in ASAP, to experience taste and obviously health at the same time.

The succulent juices,the luscious strawberry and scrumptious chocolate smoothie was extremely tempting. Would love to visit this place again and again to complete the massive list of fresh juices, smoothies and shakes and of course the cheesy,mouthwatering sandwiches.The environment is simply refreshing with games to play as well as guitar.

Finally this Hyderabad based chain has landed in kolkata!! Placed next to central plaza (HDFC Bank building) on minto park, sarat Bose road crossing, This place has a new definition to milkshakes. 

The menu is massive and I have tried nearly seven items, "monkey confidential 2"being my favourite. The interiors are stylish and classy. Good to see a vast variety of protein shakes for the health conscious, meal replacement smoothies, fruit shakes, detox shakes and so on !!

Best part is the that every drink has its own unique taste and the pocket pinch is far below its competitor.
