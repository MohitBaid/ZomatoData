A regular visitor of this restaurant. I keep trying things on their menu and they never disappoint me for anything.
Tbt, their speciality is South Indian cuisine. All the variety of Dosa, Uththapam, Vada etc. are going to excite your taste buds.
For North Indian things, I don’t try those much.
And it’s really rare to find such a neat and clean place with good food and ambience at this price range. It’s a great place to dine in with family and friends.

The pricing is the best thing about this place. Finding this cheap and comfortable place is rare. The dosas are great so is the chola bhatura. Been there a lot and it's perfect every single time.

A small restaurant hidden in some narrow street by the Technopolis bridge. South Indian food is a real winner. I love the Rava Dosa they serve here. However, when you switch to gravy and veggies, beware; you might not like it much. We had ordered Chilly Paneer, Dal Makhani, Roti and mix veg. We did not like it much. However, the dosas and other south Indian items were good like Dosa nd Vada Sambar. 

An excellent value for money restaurant if you are looking for South Indian food.

This is a small restaurant near east enclave with variety of south indian dishes.  Tried their masala dosa for the first time. Taste was good. A masala dosa costs only Rs. 40 with unlimited serving of sambar and coconut chutney.

Frequent visitor. A good place to have your regular meal or snacks. South Indian food is a go go. Rest other items on the menu list is value for money.Do not expect it to be a lavish restaurant.

I visited this place with 3 friends and we ordered cold coffee, aalu parantha, chana masala, paneer butter masala, chapati and masala dosa. Aalu parantha was the best of all the things that we had ordered. Both aalu parantha and chana masala will remind you of homemade food. Cold coffee was a little disappointing. Masala dosa was well cooked. You won't regret coming here. The service is nice.
