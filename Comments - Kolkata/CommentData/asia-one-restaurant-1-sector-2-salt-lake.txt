I visited this place with my office colleagues for dinner. It was really awesome. They serve authentic Chinese food.... We ordered veg and non veg manchow soup along with paneer and drums of heaven as stater. In main course we ordered mangolian veg rice and triple fried rice with chicken manchurian. The food was awesome also value for money. It's a must visit place for some authentic Chinese food...

A string of new restaurants opening in Sector 5, every now and then, and me experimenting them ‚Äì one at a time! This time opted for the Asia One, an office delivery, mind it!

Ordered their Veg premium combo, which comprises the below:-

(i)	Dal fry ‚Äì Tasty, but half the taste was over-powered by the excess garlic content!

(ii)	Roomali roti ‚Äì chewy, which is understandable, as this is a home delivery. Too much efflux of time between preparation and eating had rendered it so! However, the same was also improperly prepared (quite uneven),

(iii)	Kadhai Paneer ‚Äì pretty tasty, the sweet gravy deserves a special mention!

(iv)	Salads

(v)	Papad

(vi)	Steamed Rice - Fine

(vii)	Gulab jamun (Complimentary with Zomato treats) ‚Äì pretty hard, expected a much better ending!

Prices are somewhat high and quantity served is low.

Packing is excellent and most convenient, so is the delivery!

Cheers!

Located on island 8 salt lake, boasts of nice interiors and take aways but was a dissapointment of sorts. Just had starters and still the waiting time was huge. Food was a downer. Ordered fried wantons and a salt pepper chicken. The chicken was stiff and really nondescript, with no salad. The wantons jus came with a regular tomato ketchup and was again a disapointment to the taste buds. The dishes came separately. On the beverage side ordered a virgin mojito, was served in a mason jar, was refreshing but not really well made.
All in all not very promising place, except maybe if you want spend a cosy time.

I thought it to be pretty good, the way the look and feel of the restaurant appealed to me. However, I didn‚Äôt find the food to be anything extraordinary. The paneer was just like some other paneer recipe and the chicken, which they claimed to he their best dish, was just not meeting the standards. The fish fry was somewhat decent. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone else. The scorecard is something like this:
Food: 2/5
Service: 1/5(Because I had to wait for water to be served and they was noone to attend to us.)
Pricing: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5
Overall:2.5

: I work in Salt Lake, so I had to meet up a friend, who suggested that we check this place out since it was making a lot of noise over Zomato. The ambience is pretty decent, the staff is very well mannered and courteous. The best part about the staff is, they don't promote the most expensive dish or the most popular one. They'll try to know your liking and then advice you on the dishes you'd want to try.

Coming to the food, the quantity is decent but fluctuated. We ordered 2 bowls of fried rice in total, there was a misfit in the equality of both the bowls, when pointed out to the staff, they apologised but made no effort to rectify it. 

The prawns were rather small and in a couple we found the shells to be intact, which was a mood changer to the negative side. But the taste of the prawn was simply out of the world. Despite this, the shells created the bad ruckus in the mouth.

The chicken was nice, though it missed the good taste because the sauce was highly over cooked, the pieces of the chicken should be a little bigger as compared to the prices we paid. 

The only thing that took my heart away was the dimsum, which was cooked to perfection and the spices were exactly on point.

Overall, the experience was kind of disastrous but I feel it's human mistake, which is bound to happen to everyone. Maybe I was the unlucky customer. But nonetheless, I would recommend this place to everyone majorly for the ambience and service.

Hope to be luckier the next time I visit there after gathering enough courage.

All the best, guys!

This place got occupied and preoccupied by different names, Asia One being the latest and probably the best of the lot. 
Sudden dinner plans led us to this restaurant on a Sunday Night. It was comparatively full and has a good ambiance. 
The staffs are very polite and cooperative and are very well versed with the menu. They offer a vast range of dishes primarily covering the oriental and indian genre. 
On our visit we had ordered chicken clear soup,chicken dumplings, prawn siu mai, vegetable spring roll, Korean chicken in chilly plum for starters. In the main course we had chicken in spicy Hunan sauce, Kumpao prawn, Pomfret masala, mixed fried rice, chicken burnt garlic fried rice and jeera rice. 
Both the quantity and quality of the oriental dishes were good. The dumplings were very soft and well cooked and so we're the chicken items. The prawn was juicy and flavourful. The rice items were rightly seasons and had generous portions of meat, mushrooms and veggies. The only let down was the Pomfret masala. The gravy was decent but the fish in itself was very bland. Overall, a good experience.

M giving 4.5 cz they made a small mistake in the billing which they corrected once I told them.
It's a small place with ok ok interior.
Ok, now coming to the food..we were three people and we ordered sweet lime soda ( I fell in love with it ), fish finger with chilli mayo ( insufficient salt) meat Chinese fried rice, chicken Chinese fried rice, fish in oyster sauce, chicken hot garlic, chocolate ice cream.
I loved all their dishes. The total bill amount was only RS 960 which is really less for so many dishes plus they did not take tax etc.
Would recommend everyone. Do visit them.

Once we fill disappointments the background music is bit rock manager can change to some slow track
This is a complete family restaurant and if you have family who love outings this is the dining room you should check into

Went for a quick lunch alone on the way for a meeting. The restaurant looked quite perky from outside so decided to try it out. Ordered some dimsum and Thai green curry. The service was quite slow with no service staff in sight to call out to. Dimsums were ok but the Thai Green Curry was a total disaster. To begin with, the green curry was BROWN in colour, the consistency was like water and the it tasted only of chillies. Expected more from a restaurant which brand themselves as a "Asian" cuisine restaurant but fail to make a decent tasting basic green curry.

I have ordered food  four times via Swiggy. Since I like kebabs, I've ordered couple of them. The stuffed Tangri is quite nice.. The drumstick is stuffed with cheese. 

The chicken seekh, is a little dry, but the taste is good. 

The ajwaini paneer tikka is quite good. The quality of paneer is excellent. 

The murgh lazeez kebab is quite interesting. A light brown marinade, it is really nice. 

Overall good flavors. Will try the oriental soon.

I was expecting the food here to follow in the Indian tradition but was pleased to find the menus trending in a contemporary direction with emphasis on lean, fresh and organic fare -- while still keeping with Low Country/South Asian ¬†convention. My favorite dish at the Asia One Restaurant, in fact, was Butterfly prawns with Sweet chilli mayo Dip and loaded with locally netted ¬†shrimp, which are positively unmatched for flavor.

The chef and his staff are staunch advocates of the farm-to-table concept, sourcing produce, meats, poultry and dairy products almost exclusively from organic farms.

It was my family trip from mumbai to Kolkata I was looking for Restaurant to have proper Dinner I checked in zomato found a outlet Called Asia one in salt lake Area I called & Reserved the table when we visited the outlet the staff was very polite. I don't know Bengali language they started speaking me in English & Hindi. The order taker suggested‚Äã first mocktail virgin mohito it was great then we started ordering food and we started with chicken lemon coriander soup followed by starters and main course. In starter we had lazeez kebab, fish in Asian sauce and kungpao prawns. In main course we ordered for mixed meat burnt garlic fried rice, chicken in Hunan sauce, my wife asked for chicken butter masala with butter naan and my son had Thai chicken red curry with Jasmine rice. About food I would say each and every dishes starting from soup to main course was just awesome, well balanced of spices, quality of chicken was excellent. We finished our meal with caramel custard as desert and it was just perfect to end our meal for the day. Good hospitality, quick service and excellent taste of food under one roof of Asia One. After experiencing the meal at Asia One I would simply say that yes Asia is really one. Thank you Team Asia One! Keep up the good job. Will definitely visit again whenever I am in Kolkata and will surely suggest my friends and family for a great meal experience at Asia One in Salt lake City in Kolkata.

A new addition to Salt Lake.The reviews did not impress me much but still gave it a try.Packed some jeera rice,chicken in lemon coriander sauce and Amritsari fish.The jeera rice was really nice,they put some extra spices which is normally not found in other places.The sauce for the chicken was again different and really suited our pallate well but the chicken pieces were really small.The Amritsari fish was a disaster.Tiny pieces of fish coated in a thick bland besan batter.Quantity of food is less on an average and as a whole I did not find anything speacial about this restaurant.

The Rumali roti was not cooked well, it was too thick on the edges. The Kadhai Murg quantity was not good enough & the Chicken pieces were more of bones.

Ordered chicken dum biryani for home delivery from this resturant. Well packed food was timely delivered. The biryani came along with mirch ka salan,and a big peice of chicken and tasted good.Would love to try other dishes from this resturant. Also the rates are very reasonable with no hidden taxes.A thumbs up for this.

Though the restaurant is meant to be for Asian delicacies, we tried their biriyani and rara mutton. I would say. It tastes very well. Most importantly it is very light on stomach. You don't feel heavy after the meal. The ingredients used for the dishes seem to be of good qualities, i mean dalda stuffs are not much used. Though it may look very oily and spicy,but the foods are very well balanced in all ingredients.

So I order Dal Khichadi for lunch as I am looking for something healthy to eat.. and my parcel is delivered well within time and Dal Khichadi turns out to be indeed good and healthy with loads of veggies and aroma of garlic which is exactly what I am looking for. Perfect in terms of value for money and quantity. #yummytummy #tummyFull #yomYom...

This review is on the home delivery order.
I had ordered just one dish that's chicken schezwan fried rice.
First thing is that they should look into is giving at least a plastic spoon with the order, unfortunately there was no spoon, no sauce, no tissue paper which is not at all expected.
Plus points: delivers late nights too, quantity is good, easy on pocket, fast delivery. Delivered hot.
However I would Like to point out that there was less chicken in the chicken fried rice.
I have tasted better schezwan rice than this.

Omg !! Must have been my past life sin that I turned up being here today !! Jokes apart, have been watching this new place with an apparent nice appeal on my way back home, and thought of giving it a try.

Its a two room tiny eatery. The room being very clean though. There were two of the staffs, who were more after watching IPL in a tv stuck right above your head(if you are in table 3 and 4 ). They had no intentions of serving us water, taking our order or whatsoever. The loud volUme of IPL and their reaction to the match was a total mismatch to the ambience.

The order, comprising chicken wanton, baby corn & spinach, schezuwan f.rice and hongkong chicken took them 1 hr 30 minutes to serve..perhaps they went shopping for groceries. The wanton had a disgusting rotten odour, which they claimed and taught us to be typical of all wantons(as if!!). The baby corn was the only item worth eating. The f.rice had chicken pieces, which were too fibrous and stiffly fried to be chewed and gulped. The chicken gravy was nice though, except for the fact that the vegetables were undercooked, and that, the spring garlic was full of inedible scales.

Finally, the billing. We refused to pay for the terrible wantons , to which a 'senior' came in and almost ordered us to pay the full. I refused, and upon questioning how could they even talk of charging for an inedible product, they backed off. Too bold and adamant behavior for a start up eatery I must say.

Prices seem to be okay. If only the items were as expected, if not brilliant. If you wish to taste 'chinese' cooked in a very non chalant and amateurish way, but consuming a hell lot of time...you can give it a try. But please, just once. Who knows, next time these wantons are served to you ??

The worst restaurant according to me. After ordering food you have to wait for minimum 50 mins to one hour only for the starter. After waiting for such a long time they wouldn't give you good quality of food. Me and my friend went to this restaurant for dinner. We ordered chicken wanton but it was not edible. The chicken of chicken wanton was very smelly, like dry fish. Also we ordered scezwan chicken fried rice and Hong Kong chicken, but the chicken pieces were very hard. So my suggestion to all foodies ' Please don't visit this restaurant'.

Awful is one word for the food at this joint. I know harsh but the truth. We had ordered food from this joint last week for our office. Each and every item we ordered were simply inedible. The rice smelled, chikcen pieces were hard and smelly too. In short we had terrible lunch and to wash off the tastes from our we had to have cold drink

Not much to say about this restaurant. It is a small restaurant serving good chinese food. But the north indian dishes are a big dissapointment. I ordered the mutton boti kebab last time it was much below expectations. They say it contains 6 pieces, but actually serve 4 pieces which to are not of good size.

Pretty good ambience
Amazing food ( Special mention for the starters and the soups. Too good) 
Awesome hospitality 
Well mannered staff
Welcoming owner. Mr Raj Ghosh is really an amazing person. He made sure every item ws good and also said he would serve the best tarriwala curry. We ordered the lunch meal. It's a buffet system. They will serve u with the food u want. The owner Mr Raj Ghosh has got a good experience of working with The Sanjeev Kapoor. 
Impressed with everything 
Guys do visit the restaurant.

Walked in to Asia one as to wait for someone in that area. The ambience was good, met the owner Mr Raj Ghosh  who was  warm and courteous. Started with a virgin Mohito which was refreshing  and one of the best i have had in kolkata. The lemon corriander soup was superb. Although the restaurant  serves indian also we had a manchurian and a thai junglee curry. The flavours were evenly balanced and  thr taste of each of the different flavours was standing out. The items are very well priced and easy on pocket. Would visit again to discover other flavours of asian food.
