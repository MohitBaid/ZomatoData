Just an average restaurant in New Town between NBCC tower and Axis Mall. Nothing great or nothig bad about the place. The Ambience and Food are okiesh. So is the service. 

We went for dinner one night to see what the place has to offer. Mutton Daak Banglow was not great, the mutton pieces were hard but gravy was ok. Chicken kadai was alright.

With so many good restaurant in Axis Mall, I feel this plc will have a struggle in surviving.

Overall the ambiance, service and food was good but the staff behaviour towards their costumer was not favorable somehow. The music running in the restaurant was enjoyable. The food we had ordered arrived on time the Indian cuisine and tandoor dishes had perfect quantity the chicken quality could be improved.

Ambiance - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Taste - 4/5

There bill is really fake. First of all they are taking Rs.30/- for the water bottle and apart from the Rs.30/- they are charging 14.5 % VAT which is illegal as water is already inclusive of all tax. If this is service tax then it was fine but they are taking as VAT and when you demand the regular water they will give u hot water so that you can purchase mineral water at their rate. Its a really very bad restaurant and very bad nature of staff. When I told him about the bill then they told me that it is done by accountant and the thing done by accountant is correct.Its really very worst.

A nice Indian, Chinese, Mughlai restaurant at a calm, secluded part of New Town. The restaurant is spacious but I found problem with the  blue light so would suggest to change the lights. Food quantity and is good. Chicken quality could be better. Special Biriyani is awesome and tandoori fish is a must try. Mention must be made of the good service.

I came here with 2 friends for a light meal. We ordered schezwan noodles, crispy chilli babycorn and chilli paneer. The food was nice. Chilli paneer wasn't crispy. The service is appreciable. Can't say anything about the main course because we didn't eat much here but you can definitely visit this place for snacks. If you live near NBCC, New town, Kolkata or you visit Axis mall, Kolkata and you're hungry, you can definitely visit this restaurant. They won't disappoint you.

Its a new restaurant close to axis mall. Its nicely decorated and the service was great. We had gone for a quick lunch and we were the only customers. They switched on the ac and immediately served us water and made us feel very welcome. Coming to the food its ok. We ordered chicken tikka, mutton dakbanglow, rice, daal fry and green salad. The chicken tikka had very small chicken pieces , u cant compare it with the tikka u get at aminia or arsalan. 
Im very fon of mutton dakbanglow and i usually only have it at bhojohori manna. This one had 4 pieces of mutton, potatoes and one egg. The quantity was good but the taste wasnt. 
The daal was very tasty and the quantity was decent. 
The service is good and the staff is very helpful. 
Might try out their chinese items

Quality of food is very good. Staffs are very friendly. A neat & clean place to have food. Little bit costly but the quality of food compensate your every rupee.
