Food is very nice, we have taken multiple times from them and each time the experience was excellent. Party delicacies as well as regular home delivery are both worth a mention. Delivery is as well on perfect time and perfect packaging. Certainly calls for trying out. We will of course retain our relationship with you for a long time.

I ordered veg thali, taste wise it is exactly like home made, never felt that preparation is more oily or spicy,  quantity wise value for money. Totally satisfied. Thanks

I live in Abu Dhabi and during my visits in Kolkata in recent past, many occasions were there when either the food was directly ordered by my family or as a guest I had the opportunity to enjoy Adhya's Ranna.
My collective feedback - highly appreciable food quality, taste of each variety was equally good, if not better. Most amazing part was that they can customize the menu as per client's request even with items which are used in our Bengali Cuisine seldom.

I'm a  non bengali but m very fond of having authentic bengali food & this surges me to look for the best n for that i usually hop around in restaurants. Sometimes at home i wanted to enjoy the same- home delivered but couldn't get the one who satisfied my Tastebud but today my search ended at Adhya's. They are really serving good food at a reasonable price n that too in a very presentable n hygienicaly manner. Wish good luck n prosperity to them in near future.
