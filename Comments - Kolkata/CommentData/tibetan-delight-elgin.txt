Delightfully delicious, food served hot and fresh. If you wish to have pork (roasted chilli pork, pork momo to be particular), this is your place to visit. 
Quite affordable in terms of price too.

The location of this place is horrid. It let down our spirit already. The red lights inside and the all red decor isn't really very appealing. The prices to be very honest given the standard of the place seemed quite high. So we expected an exceptional quality of food.
‚òÜKothey- Starting with good things first. This was super delicious and probably the only item we found remarkable enough. It was having a well smoked flavour.
‚òÜPrawn Noodles- The noodles were very oily the taste was fine, nothing exceptional.
‚òÜMomos- I had momo cravings n that was the sole reason we visited this so called popular place but honestly it was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Firstly, they served no soup which renowned shop doesn't serve soup. Secondly, the momo covering was so thick that it felt pulpy in the mouth. It was so ordinary that it hurt paying so much money.
The service was extremely slow. The place is situated in such a cringy dark lane. Maybe people who get pork here at dirt cheap prices enjoy this place, we definitely found nothing in the food taste to return to this place ever again.

Another hidden gem in heart of Kolkata. I did not know about this until my friends took me here. The sitting arrangements are a bit shabby, but all those vanished when the dishes arrived. The pork steamed momo was on point. But the best ones have to be smoked pork with bbq sauce and roast chilli pork, And best thing is : totally pocket friendly.

The momos and thukpas are also good. The ambience is very vintage and cozy

My go to place for some good old Chinese food when I'm running low on money. The place is really tiny and doesn't have much of an 'ambience'. The first time I went, I was actually quite turned off by the location and the lack of cleanliness.
But well the main hero of a restaurant is the food and I can't really complaint about that!
I love their pork momos, soups, the mixed haka noodles. The quantity used to be so huge that two of us actually struggled to finish one plate. But yesterday when I visited I found that they have reduced and we were still hungry after finishing one plate. The taste is still bang on!
Pocket pinch- 500 for 2.

When it comes to Chinnese and Tibetian food, the first name that comes to my mind is Tibetian Delight. It does an extraordinary setup and brings up a great food for its customers on a regular basis at a price you can't even imagine. A well known pork destination for all pork lovers. Please do visit if you love Chinese and you are a momo lover. 
Last time i tried Egg Meifoon and Chicken Thukpa and it was love... ‚ù§

It is really difficult to find this restaurant for one as it's situated in a small allyes but the name Tibetan Delight makes itself so popular that any one can tell you the direction. It is small eatery and famous for its pork dishes. 
We ordered chilli roasted pork, pork Hakka noodles and Tibetan Delight Special Thupka. Thupka came with a big bowl and contained good quantity. Roasted pork and noodles was also come with good quantity and all the items were delicious and value for money.
It's a small joint and hardly 20-25 people can dine at a time. The ambience may not attract you but the overall atmosphere is nice. One must pay a visit to Tibetan Delight to experience the Chinese and Tibetan dishes.

It was the first time I had pork...and I was blown away. It was very finely prepared, well cooked. The oil content was a bit high, but it was each bit tasty. Chicken chopsuey was mild, yet so perfect. Filled with veggies, chicken pieces and long long noodles. And the chilli roast pork was just perfect.

After a long time, your Hungry Nomad is back with his in depth reviews..!! ;)

Okay!! 

To start off with, Tibetan Delight.

As far as i remember, i visited Tibetan Delight some 10 days back. MAN!! This food hub never disappoints me. With uts lip smacking Roasted Chilli Pork, dry chilli chicken and its slurpy noodles...Tibetan Delight is indeed a delight for your taste buds...

Location : Near EXIDE crossing. You'll have to ask the locals for direction, because the place is not near the streets. It is located in a hidden lane, a very narrow one..which will make you a little uncomfy.

Food : The food is really good for the price list. They surely know how to cook meat. For it's a meat lovers paradise. You can get pork, lamb, chicken etc..I will definitely suggest their famous Roasted Dry Chilli Pork..with Hakka Egg Noodles.. delicious!!

Ambience : The ambience is pathetic.. No AC..Not properly lit..only fans and lanterns. Very poor seating arrangement. And most importantly, you have to visit this place during Monsoon or Winter...since this place can be a lil too sultry if you go on summer..In one word its a typical Tibetan Restaurant in the middle of Kolkata.

Staff : The staffs are very unprofessional. But they are polite and very kind people..I liked their service...fast and they are good listeners.

I have to mention this, that the Hygiene of the place is not upto the mark. So if you guys wanna pay a visit for its tasty meaty foods, they thumbs up. Youre good.

Hungry Nomad will rate this place.

Food : 3 / 5
Ambience : 2 / 5
Staff : 3 / 5

Overall : 3/5

Happy food hunting Nomads.

Today it was my 1st visit to Tibetan delight. Exact location is difficult to explain. But I can assure you that it was a hidden gem in the Elgin road. 
Ambiance was not so good.  It was a very old & small place with 4 table &  16 chairs.  Bt I love the place most. They serve one of the best Chinese food in the city of joy. It was a old restaurant serve various Chinese food.  Today I ordered dry Chilli chicken, smoked chicken barbeque, chicken fried rice and chicken hakka noodles.  I jst loved the smoked chicken barbeque. Price was not so high. &  the best part is there is no GST.

unless someone takes you there you cannot find this place at all. maps are useless for this place. we i will try to guide you. take the first small lane after crossing the road containing chai break if you are coming from exide¬† side. this lane is very small and located just beside a pan shop . place doesnt look nice at all. but what matters is food. we have tried a lot of items from here starting from chicken fried rice. pork noodles pork kothey . chicken thukpa, and their roasted chilly pork.. only one complain quantity of rice and noodles are very less . you can get better quantity with same quality in many other places .¬† their rice noodles were not available¬† on may occasions . prices are tax inclusive and they dont provide you with a bill . this is what i completely disagree with. they just ask you for the money vocally . unprofessional

This place is situated in a very small alleyway. It was even hard with the Google map to trace this place atva go for the first time. Still, we managed to reach this place at the evening time on 28th Dec 2017. This tiny place can accomodate about 12 people at a time with its 4 table sitting arrangement. I could see that some people were sitting with their food outside which I found to be roadside sitting arrangement instead of outdoor arena. Anyway, we got a table for 3 of us in 20 minutes or so. The restaurant was dimly lit and there was only one serving person. The same person was taking the orders, cleaning the tables, bringing the food etc etc. We waiting some more time to provide our order. 
We ordered chicken steamed momo, pan fried chicken momo, Schezuan chicken noodles.
Steam momo was good but the momo covering seemed to be thick and overcooked. The pan fried momo was nothing like fried. It was the steam momo with a spicey sauce covering it. Still, the sauce was tasty and only one thing which I liked about this place. The Schezuan chicken noodles' dish was super spicey and full with some undercooked, hard green leaves which were irritating to chew. 
Overall the experience at this place was not nice at all. They should also consider the hygiene seriously. There must be some differences between a roadside food stall and a restaurant featured in Zomato.

Okay straightly coming to the review-
After post Christmas hangout,I & 3 other friends just rushed into Tibetian Delights with hunger Chinese food.
First thing,it's really hard to find the restaurant. It's actually in an alley to the opposite of P.C.Chandra Jwellers,Elgin. The alley is really narrowüòí
Secondly the restaurant is really small,it's actually 1 room place having 4 tables & 16 chairs. But still there was a good thing that the kitchen is not being overlapped with the sitting place so there was no smell or smoke of kitchen.
Now coming to food- We ordered chicken pan fried momo,Mixed haka noodles(without pork),schezwan noodles(non veg),Schezwan Chicken,Chicken in oyester sauce.
All the dishes were really really good,both in quality & taste,but if the Schezwan noodles was a little more spicy,it would be better.
Service was first. Prices were reasonable and if two or three people go together then it is very much pocket friendly.
So just don't go with location or space because food is really good and would love go again üòç

A total let down today. I was a regular visitor here for more than 5  years. I always enjoyed their Momos and the momo sauce was always top class. Today the sauce was very sour. The steamed momos were VERY VERY oily. Earlier they used to serve very soft momos but dry. It took them at least half an hour to deliver one plate of Momo and another 10 minutes to return my change. 
I have decided to stay away from this place permanently. A sad goodbye but they have deteriorated a lot.

First while entering this place I was thinking like where have I come as this place is inside a dark narrow street. But as I entered the restaurant I felt the Chinese ambience. The service is not that good. According to the range of cost,the food is not upto the mark. So overall I didn't like this place a lot.

P.S. - Only I liked the Kothay here

Located inside a dingy alley in Elgin Road. Not very clean. My friend was craving about this place which seemed to be quite famous, according to him. We ordered Pork Pan Fried Momo which happened to be great but the Pork Fried Rice and the Roasted Chilli Pork were an utter disappointment. The only upside about this place is the food is fairly cheap.

Taking about the food its just Lip Smacking .I call it "Fingerlicious" because u cant resist urself licking ur fingers. We went there late at about 9.10pm and they served us by 10mins hardly. My girlfriend also loved it. We were lost locating the place so the owner send their staff to receive us which was a great hospitality on their part. We both loved it. Ambience wise it is not so grand but just like other small eating joints and Chinese Eating House in Kolkata.

Tibetan Delight is one of the hidden gems among restaurants of Kolkata. It is located inside a narrow shabby lane which is very very hard to locate. The nearest landmark is HDFC bank and P.C. Chandra Jewellers. The lane is just opposite Rabindra Sadan Metro Gate no. 4 .Have to cross the road exiting metro and take zebra crossing and go to another side of the road near CHAI BREAK and then turn right to the footpath and take left for that narrow lane which is just opposite the HDFC BANK. If u have difficulty call the restaurant no and they will send their staff to receive u near metro gate.

It's a place of good food..don't come here if you value decor more than good food..because you might not be too happy with it..although the ambience with those mysterious lighting from Chinese lanterns and the amazing smell of momos in the air is worth it ! Inspite of not having good enough interiors the place attracts people who are crazy for good Tibetan cuisine..so be ready for standing in a long queue before treating your taste buds with some authentic Tibetan food!

This small food joint is actually hard to locate but once you reach the place you will definitely like it. Having seating arrangement for around 16 people this place may keep you waiting for sometime as it is always full being popular among the students mainly. This place is quite shabby. We had Chicken steam Momo, Chicken Pan Fried Momo and roasted Chilli Pork as starters. For  main course we had Mixed Chowmein, Mixed Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken and Chicken in Thai Sauce. Steam Momo lacked salt and stuffing was less whereas the sauce of the pan fried Momo won my heart.Roast Chilli Pork was so good.  The Hakka Chowmein and Mixed Fried Rice was good having generous amount of pork,prawn and Chicken. Chicken in Thai Sauce and Schezwan Chicken was okayish. Price is cheap and service is exceptionally quick.

Near Exide, this restaurant is quite difficult to locate. The place is pretty average and small but has a homely pleasant atmosphere. It is dimly lit with a lantern hanging over every table. The best thing about  Tiberian Delight is it's extremely cheap and delicious dishes. If you are low on budget, this is the best place to hit for a full happy meal. Service is slow, but worth the wait. Will visit again.

I'll give 2 for location. 3 for the ambience. 4 for the food. 2.5 for the service.
We were a group of 10 friends. Ordered almost everything. Food was good. Nothing extraordinary. Price was OK. 2200 for 10. The place is too small. Just 4 tables. And you'll have to cross dark alleys to reach there. They took a lot of time to serve. Also the person denied giving us bill twice. I had to pester him to atleast write it down on a piece of paper instead of verbally announcing just the total price.
Thukpa was not so good. Schezwan pan fried Momos were the best thing we had. Also, they have Hakka noodles that's good. And fried rice is also fine.
Overall, considering only the food, I'll rate 3.5

A sudden visit to the restaurant turned out very nice. The place is very small. Dimly lighted and decorated with beautiful hanging lamps. The service is quite prompt and the prices are decent.

I ordered Chicken pan fried momo and Chicken Barbeque. The momos are very tasty here. So highly recommended for all momo lovers. Go for their Chicken pan fried momo ( deep fry ).
I am going back again for sure.
A hidden gem indeed. Hard to locate.

üòãüòóWell Today I Decided To Visit Cloud Kitchen, Chowringhee For The 1st Time But When I Visited The Shutter Was Closed. What A Shame. After That I Decided To Visit Tibetan Delight, Elgin For The 16th Time. It Is Located Near Lashmi Sen And Sons Store Jewellers. So I Called Up This Restaurant 4 Times In Their Mobile No. To Reserve A Table For My Dinner Which They Did. This Restaurant Is A Hidden Gem I Can Assure You That. Getting To The Food, I Ordered 1 Plate Veg Hakka Chowmein For Rs. 100/- And 1 Plate Baby Corn Manchurian For Rs. 150/- With No GST Charges. I Enjoyed My Dinner And Myself. I Can't Think Of A Better Chinese Place Like Tibetan Delight. So Thank you Tibetan Delight For Making My Day Marvelous.üòÉüòÑ

Now the first thing that any reviewer would like to say about this joint is its awefully bad location.one can never find it on his/her own unless guided.it is located opposite to the PC Chandra jewellers in elgin road crossing and towards exide crossing.. A narrow lane followed by a right turn.Now the restrurant is not at all clean like others but it has that old shabby look which has a beauty of its own.Air conditioning facility is not provided.The best part is its has a halloween type look.The lights are suspended in halloween pumpkins and it looks really good.However a food lover will definitely like this place.It serves good quality food specially momos(pork momos,chickn pan fried etc),the gravy chowmein was also great and you can get it from its taste that it is an authentic chinese restruarant.Worth for a try for foodies.The service was good and price is moderate.

A little place for having the essence of pure Chinese food. After so many cancelled plans, we managed to go there. The ambience is very enigmatic with red lights. We ordered Mixed Hakka Chowmein, Roasted Chilli Pork and Gravy Chilli Chicken. Every dishes were unique in it's own nature but the Chilli Pork was outstanding. A little bit less spicy but that can vary from person to person. A must go place.

This place is highly recommended by some people but my experience, the only one time I went there was not good. This review and rating is strictly on the basis of my experience. They provide decent food and good quantity but the place is too shabby for my taste. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for a fine dining experience. This is not the place one would like to spend an evening. You can instead get some food packed and have at home. Cost-wise its great value for money.

chicken was bland and had no taste.Noodle quality is bad . all over the experience was like hell.

Situated inside a small & shabby alley near Rabindra Sadan Metro station, this food joint is often regarded as the popular most amongst the gen X!
I also had the same idea about this place, but after today's experience, it has taken a turn!
Food is OK, but the service & hospitality shown by the staffs was very inappropriate and it seemed like they were doing us favour by serving food..
We waited almost for half an hour, and as we entered the joint, the waiter & a lady, who I thought is the owner, kept forcing us to give our order quickly.
And after we completed our main course, they didn't even showed courtesy of asking us if we need something more & removed our plates and gave us the bill.
We were not the only one to suffer, also the family seated beside us was also treated the same.
Disgusting! üò§

This is a hidden gem, very hard to locate. It will be very helpful if you could ask a local pan wala after chai break. It has been in my wishlist since a year. Today, I was craving for momo, as the momo plaza was closed, I opted for tibetan delight and ordered for chicken steam momo and chicken lollypop with pan fried sauce. The entrance was by the narrow‚Äã lane and you have take right side after walking sometime. Both the items were delectable and the prices were low. Services were too good, but the place was little bit cosy (having 4-5 tables). I keep looking forward to come and dine in.

Went here twice. Both the times I tried their momos. Quality has deteriorated. I remember relishing the momos of Tibetan delights 4 years ago. But this time, I found them pretty ordinary. Even some of the road side stalls serve better momos. The soup accompanying was good though. Few chinese lanterns are hanging to create an ambience.. but still the location, the dingy lanes and the plastic table and chairs gives the feeling of a shabby food joint.

Only problem is locating the place and you have to know the lanes and alleys in Elgin Road to find it.

The place used to be one of my favourite pocket friendly Chinese joints back in the days. I have tried quite a number of dishes from their menu, which I dont recall though. Recently a friend and me wanted to have tasty momos and this place happened to be around. So without wasting any time we hopped in but was disappointed to see the waiting line. However the fifteen minutes wait was worth it when plates of perfectly fried and steamed momos appeared right in front of us. A must visit.

A small yet good food joint for having authentic Tibetan dishes. It is somewhat difficult to locate this place. It is situated very close to Momo Plaza and Chai Break, Elgin Road and opposite to P.C. Chandra Jewellers. We had to take help of Google map to reach here as we are not well-acquainted of Elgin Road area.  

We went on a Sunday evening and had to wait for some time to get a seat! The crowd started increasing with time. It's a very simple restaurant and the ambience is not much alluring too. We ordered Chilli Pork and Tibetan Delight Special Chowmein. The Chilli Pork was extremely tasty but the noodles wasn't that good! Considering the price, it was an okay-okay experience. But I'm giving good rating for the tasty Chilli Pork!

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 400 for two (approx.)

The place where the restaurant is located is very unhygienic and so is their kitchen. At first look one might not want to dine here, but their service is good and so is their food and prices are quite reasonable too. It's a non-AC restaurant with only four tables. It's very hard to find this restaurant if one is not accustomed to this area.

This is a hard place to find if you are not accustomed to the area around Elgin Road . If you are walking towards Elgin Road from Exide Crossing cross Bhishop Lefroy Road first & then Suburban Hospital Road - continue walking & you will get a narrow lane ( non motorable ) on the left , once you enter this lane a signboard of Tibetan Delight will welcome you to the restaurant which is on the right hand side. It's a small joint with four tables & plastic chairs . The dimly lit room is decorated by hanging lamps . The lane itself is not very comfortable to walk & the situation worsens after a shower . 
Waiting time is a bit longer here . 
Coming to the food I ordered the following : 
Vegetable Chowmien Gravy : It lacked right quantity of salt & when I added a pinch a salt it became tasty. The gravy was quite good with adequate amount of vegetables . Quantity is sufficient for a person . 
Roast Chilli Pork : My favourite side dish with Chowmien . I asked to make it dry & they obliged . Pork was cooked nicely while the vegetables retained their crunchiness making it tasty . Quantity was again sufficient . 
Price is reasonable but one thing to be kept in mind that they do not accept cards , only cash .

As the name suggests it is truly a delight for authentic Chinese and Tibetan food lovers. Located in a small lane this place may not be "good looking" but real foodies dont worry about ambience much. Coming to the food two of us decided to go for their popular dishes namely "chicken thukpa" "pork pan fried momo" & "dry chilli pork". Till now one of the greatest thukpa I had and very much within the budget. This authentic places deserves special mention and thanks to Zomato these places reach to more people now!

The place is hard to locate though it is close to high road. You shall need precise directions to reach here.

The ambience is not impressive. There are four wooden tables with red top and red plastic chairs and Chinese lamps are hanging over the tables. The non-AC place is dingy and it seemed that to cover that up a bit, the lighting had been carefully planned. 
Because of the space crunch, you may have to share table with strangers. But, well, it has its loyal base of patrons and they don't come here for ambience or comfort but for good food.

I had heard good things about its pork dishes, so I ordered the red hot favourite of pork lovers- Roast Chilli Pork (Rs 160) and to go with it, Mixed Hakka Noodles (Rs 170). No tax is charged on food. The service was quick and the food reached in 11 mts. The portion of noodles was just enough for one. It had shrimps not prawns and in less amount. Chicken, pork and egg were in reasonable quantity and it tasted good. However, going by portion size vs price, I won't call it value for money. 

The Roast Chilli Pork had a lot more gravy than average serving and the pork pieces were swimming in it. It was desirably spicy and flavorful. The pork was cut out of slices and there were plenty of it. Unfortunately for me, it was lean meat and a little chewy hence. I like a bit fatty and tender pork. So, the meat bit was not satisfactory.

I would like to come back here for its steamed pork momo which are strongly recommended.

I have been here quite a lot. The only dish i loved the most here is their pan fried chicken lollypop. The rest of the stuff is quite ordinary and some are below standards as well. Lately i tried their chicken momo in pan fried sauce.The sauce tasted like vinegar.And loads of sour vinegar. Totally not worth the money.They have tried to make the ambience romantic by hanging Chinese lanterns and all but the place is too small.All these can be overlooked had the food been the talking point. Buckle up guys!

Always wanted to visit this place. We took Chilli Pepper Chicken as a starter. It was a good dish. Then we took Singapore Fried Rice(Non Veg) and Tibetan Delight Special Chicken in the main course. The best part of the main course was the Rice. It was just too good. It was a bit sweet and melts in the mouth and a perfect complement after the starter. Chicken was also good.

The service was also very good and price is also on the lower side.The place is not that big. So may be you have to wait a bit long to get your table. The atmosphere inside is calm and very beautiful.

Just love it... and we don't order chicken or fish outside coz that we eat daily in home... it's just pork üòã ... we had pan fried pork momo, mixed Hakka noodles, pork with capcicum (in white gravy with mushrooms) and dry chili pork.... with Kaushik Basu

First of all I'd like to say, I'm feeling sorry to put such poor rating..
but that's the max I can do based upon my experience..
It broke all the thought or image I had in my mind of this place..

I won't introduce this place.. about the location, decor etc.
that's already been the in the reviews before..
I'll say only about my experience.. and its only about the food..
its really surprising..¬†
because though being located at a odd location, or though being tiny or cozy..
the only attraction of this place is their food..
I also had the same idea.. with the lot of zomato reviews and heard from some friends.. 
I'm really disappointed with that, the quality and taste also..
I don't know whether its a degradation of them or my own bad luck...

I could not find proper ingredients in their momo..¬†
We've ordered Pork steam momo.. it was feeling like eating only steamed flour mix.. the soup was tasting like any road side joint..
also ordered Mixed noodles.. yes, it had adequate pieces of chicken, pork and shrimps.. but nothing remarkable in the taste..¬†
they've served the noodle with a fork only like any roadside roll-chowmien corner.. no spoon with it..
but all these thing I could forget if the food was good..

though being disappointed with my 1st visit.. I would like to visit again..
because I'd like to check whether it was my bad luck or its really the degradation of their quality..

Located at Elgin Road. But a bit difficult to locate from main road. Have to enter a narrow lane to reach this restaurant. It offers authentic Chinese cuisine. We ordered Chicken & Pork Pan Fried Momo with Schezwan sauce. Both were delicious but chicken one was better. Ambiance is good & a reddish light pervades. And it doesn't remain closed on Monday. We went there last Monday itself.

I visited this place quite a number of times. Although over the years their get up did not changed much but the quality of the food has gone down a lot. My last visit was very disappointing. The quality of the fried rice & noodles has become like the roadside stalls, chilli pork was half cooked and was smelling. I brought food for my family and I had to waste a lot of it. I still believe they can regain their old respect if they work on the quality of their food. My best wishes.

Even multiple visits to this place will never satisfy my heart.One of the favourite places from college days. 
This place shall always be a favourite.
Though it is hard to locate for first times because the lane that hosts Tibetan Delight often goes for a miss.

So if one is taking the metro to reach Rabindra Sadan they should ask people out once they reach the metro station.

Talking of the food.
I have tried almost all their best items,since I have lost count of the number of times I dropped in at TD.
The chilly pork is a MUST HAVE.
And,
The momos,be it steamed,pan fried or just fried.
They are all equally good.

The fact that they do not charge any extra tax,makes it affordable to college goers which is why it is always crowded and there hasn't been a single day when a table was available without waiting.

Needn't say that I will keep visiting this place.

This place is a gem to be found. A little difficult to locate as you would have to know the alley and walk for 100mtr in a very narrow path, but this place will surely surprise you. As for the ambience, don't expect much. It's a dark dull non ac place with 5 tables only. 

But the food here is just fantastic. Be it momos, or noodles, it's tasty. The real deal breaker is their pork dishes. They make it awfully good. One of the very few places that offer pork without 50% fat.

One of the oldest chinese eatery in Kolkata. Tucked in between the lanes, its real hard to find out. We went there on a casual day out. A very small eatery with no AC, no ambience & not even the proper entrance or signboard. But dont mind all these stuffs. Just be there to experience their food which is total love. Had their "Bbq Chicken" as starter which was rocking good. Chicken smoked in BBQ Sauce along with sauted veggies. Goes really well as starter. Next we had their normal "Chicken Steamed Momo". Particullarly for this one I was really disappointed. Momo was really bad. The whole outer cover was very slimy & undercooked. Even the stuffing was not well prepared. & the chutney along with the momo was bad too. But next we had "Mixed Hakka Chowmein" which was really good & lipsmacking. Silufficient portions of chicken, prawn & veggies made me feel good after the momo disaster. Along with hakka chow we had "Lemon Chicken". It was on a lighter mode. Tastes amazingly awsome with a significant presence of lemon slices. Goes well with spicy hakka chow.
Overall it was really good to be there & have thir amazing foods but their momo gave me a thud punch. Even roadside momos are far better than theirs. But except momos, each & every items were great.
Would love to visit againüíùüíù

Tibetan Delight, as the name suggests, is indeed a delight for people who love to eat, and especially for those who are on a budget or broke. 

Located at a walkable distance from Rabindra Sadan metro station, this place is hard to find if you don't have someone accompanying who has been there earlier. Even Google maps fail at most times, such is the tricky location! It's located in a dingy lane, almost looks like a old school drug dealer's lane, and you'd get the vibe that you're there for some smuggling while walking through the dimly lit, narrow, dingy lane between two buildings. 

The place has almost no hygiene, which can be considered as the only con of the place. No AC either. There are barely four to five plastic tables with plastic chairs, each with a red Tibetan lamp over it. One can hardly see the other tables from their own table. 

Coming to the food, we ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles, Schezwan Noodles, and Hong Kong Chicken. The chicken dish had a white gravy along with medium, soft pieces of meat which came with vegetables. The Hakka noodles were very tasty with different kinds of meat present in them, and the Schezwan noodles were very spice and were a little sticky. I liked the Hakka noodles more. One plate of chicken and two plates of noodles would be sufficient for three people, if not eating lushly. 

The service was okay. They weren't too slow, and served us hot and fresh food.

The bill was nominal and to add to our joys, they did not charge anything extra than the prices mentioned on the menu card. 

If you can find the place, you're in for a secret world of authentic Tibetan food! 

Happy eating!

It is not always Necessary to Eat food in a well decor restaurant sometimes small restaurant taste is far good from well decor restaurant.'Tibetan Delight' Like this restaurant.Firstly it is situated in Elgin just near the famous Momo Plaza.Overall the ambience is Sort of okay.There is hardly about 3-4 Fans (No Ac) I highly recommend to visit this in monsoon or Winter. The main thing is the food,Taste Very nice & Pocket Friendly also.All the Chinese & Tibetan dishes are limited if you visit the restaurant after 9 the availability is less.Overall the food quality is nice whenever we visit we ordered a Thukpa, Chicken, Soup & Momo.Remember if u get the Momo it's your good luck.Overall for lunch & dinner it's a good joint for us.

Decent place. Narrow lane leading to the small restaurant. Specialises in Chinese cuisine. Overhead lamps may be a bit disturbing but adds to the ambience of a Chinese shack. Not enough space, not a place for a large gang to hangout. Food quality fresh and decent. Friendly attitude of workers. Ana average place for a low budget hangout.

Dropped down into this famous eating house a few days back !! Though the place does not require any review as it is well known by all. Particularly famous for pork dishes we ordered a plate of¬†

-Dry Chilli Pork (it truly does not require any review...as because it was so delicious , perfect combination of spices , overall wonderful and yes don't forget to mention that you particularly want those "chorbi" parts.)¬†
-Thai Chopsey (as the waiter told us to try this and it was too good better than American Chopsey , especially what I would love to mention is about those fried Noodles, which were so well prepared)

The place is small with four tables and not such an impressive ambience but the food is YUM !! and the staffs are so friendly.The quantity was good enough to satisfy 2. And they don't charge any VAT so therefore you can easily enjoy without burning a hole in your pocket.

The only problem that you might face is while locating this place and once you're done , trust me you will surely not want to leave this place !! .
One more thing Rice Noodles or 'Meifoon' is only available during winter.

We came back absolutely Satisfied :) :)

Visited this place quite a number of times and it never happened to disappoint me. A very small, cozy restaurant on the shabby lanes of Sadan. Most of the time one has to wait for this place is always, always crowded. They serve a good range of Tibetan food, starting from momos, thukpas, noodles and everything. A very pocket friendly food joint too. A highly recommended place. Would always visit for more.

This tiny restaurant is located in a narrow dingy alley , a little away from Momo Plaza, on the left towards Hazra. The low lit interiors are decorated with Chinese lamps that hang from above the tables , which can seat upto 15 people in all. The food here is amazingly pocket friendly, and value for money ! The pork pan fried momos here are not that great , and taste too sweet and too soft . The pork Singapore hakka noodles, however , is amazing. So is the slice pork with mushroom, that has a white sauce base , and capsicum and onions in the gravy. The service here is fairly quick , but they might not always have the soft drink of your choice. Overall , a must visit restaurant for pork lovers in the city .

Tibetan delight has always been one of my favourite being a Chinese lover. The prices are moderate, service is really good. The staff are cordial. The place is just a single room, a very small place. Often we have to wait outside for our turn. It is located inside a dingy alley & ambience is quite dull. Tibetan delight is a hidden gem!
Food in Tibetan delight is just heavenly, variety of taste bursting in your mouth, something to die for. I love the pork preparations very much. One who has tasted their Pork dishes will never opt for Chicken preparations. The chicken preparations are good however it's no match with the pork dishes. My favourites areTAMIYUM SOUP, CHICKEN HOT AND SOUR SOUP, PORK HAKKA  NOODLES, SCHEZWAN HAKKA NOODLES, ROASTED CHILLI PORK, PORK IN SCHEZWAN SAUCE. 
There is a slight increase in the prices recently but it is still very reasonable. However there's a sharp decline in the quantity of the food offered at present compared to what was offered previously.  
Inspite of the ambience, size, I absolutely love this place. The food is extremely pleasing and have the potential to uplift your mood in a moment. 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

One of the hidden gems in the Elgin area, Tibetan Delight is for those people who want to have good old spicy Chinese and Tibetan at a pocket-friendly budget. A lane opposite the Elgin-Chowringhee P.C chandra leads to it, and the first impression is sure to make you rethink your decision.

But trust me, that shady place is one of the better Tibetan joints in the city! They give a generous (rather, too much) quantity and has a feel of the home-made comfort food. I have gone their quite a few times, and I love their Pork preparations, Hot Garlic Chicken, the Chopsuey and the Fried Rice. The momos aren't worth the hype, so if you're visiting this place, my recommendation will be to go with the pork dishes.

Not a very spacious one.
Coming down to the food.
This place serves some good dishes.
The pork here is good call for all. Some chicken dishes are good.
But this place has been detoriating for day to day.
Like every alternative time i get to this place i find something lacking.
Well you can visit this place with some of the pork lover, if you are in to avoid taxes.

Heard a lot about this place from my friend's who came here in their tuitions time So finally been here to try some of their delights. Honestly first impression wasn't that good cause ambience is very average but when they serve me my veg fried rice I fall in love with this. Fried rice were so aromatic and tastes heavenly delicious. Hospitality was good, staff were nice, price was pocket friendly and taste was delicious. Wonderful experience. Must try place. Strongly recommended to all. Personal favorite.

We ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Hot Garlic Chicken and dry chilli pork. The pork was a bit spicy. The other two dished was delicious.

When in college some of my friends introduced me to this place. On the first visit, I was not too sure if I'd be able to locate this place alone on a second visit but then again I wondered if I would even want to. I totally doubted my friends' Tibetan taste buds. "What would they know of the Tibetan flavours" is what came to my mind. We had to wait for some odd 15-20 minutes and then were offered a table inside this dingy place (which could accommodate to the most 15 people together). The place didn't look clean but we were students and back then with friends, anything, just about anything was cool. So we waited for the TD Special Mixed Thukpa, Garlic Non-veg Noodles and Dry Chilli Pork that was ordered. And man, did I suddenly drift away to my childhood days of the mountains. It was special and really really a treat for the taste buds.

Now when I would sometimes pass by Elgin I wonder if I wouldn't want to go locate the dingy food joint and enjoy a bowl of steaming thukpa! Again.

All of a sudden I decided to pamper myself with a platter full of Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken with Baby Corn. It was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. Though this restaurant is located in a murky place near Elgin, the delectable Chinese cuisine here which never fails to satiate my taste buds compensates for it all! Also, a few days ago I tried their Singapore Fried Rice, Szechwan Fried Rice and Hong Kong Chicken as a side dish which had star anise enhancing its savour. Food is delicious, but thumbs down for cleanliness and ambience. It's a pocket-friendly restaurant. #Tibetan Delight

I have visited this place a couple of times before but after my last visit am really disappointed because their food have degraded over the years. Located in a dingy Lane opposite to the p.c.chandra showroom it is very much tough and hard to find the restaurant and without the Google map or asking the way out to the local people one would never reach the place if it is a first time visit. The ambience is nothing informative but at one point they used to serve authentic Chinese and Tibetian dishes  for which it is still a bit popular among the young crowd and students. 
On my last visit we ordered 1.chicken pan fried momo 2. Mixed gravy chowmein. The momo was good, 5 in no though the amount of chicken filling was very less. The soup was good so I wanted some more but alas the added soup they gave me was just horrible. It was more portion of salt mixed with some boiling water and nothing. Even vendors selling momos at footpath gives better quality soups at a decent rate. The mixed gravy chowmein however was the saviour but I wish the quantity could be better.
Nowadays when every restaurant is so particular about each and every detailing and that to in such a place where competition is really hard they should start working on their hygiene and even if not, their food because unless and until it is definitely not recommended.

This place is hard to find but once you enter this "den" there's no looking back! The food, the typical aroma will surely tickle your nostrils and salivate your mouth! Coming to the ambience, it rather looks cheap! To be honest, I never thought that their food spread would be pretty much amazing! Never let the looks fool you!¬†Speaking of their items, they contain pretty much everything Tibetian. We ordered one plate of Chicken Steamed Momo and Pork Fired Momo. Needless to say, they were delicious! Then for the main course, we ordered one plate of Chicken Thukpa and one Thai Chopsuey. In my recommendation, I would suggest, go for Thukpas any day, it's awesome! But somehow I didn't like the Chopsuey. As for the side dish, Roast Chilli Pork was the best thing that happened to us that day!! It's terrific! I could finish off plates of it (if only I had that much bucks!). We had a veggie freak in our midst, so¬†she ordered Cashew Vegetable (God knows how it tasted! She mentioned it's like veg balls).¬†That said I would say, all fanatics of Tibetian delicacies should at least¬†visit this place once. It will be a treat, I guarantee! But the place is not at all suitable for a date. It's a¬†nice hangout place when you visit with your gang of friends. Personally, I felt they could have improved the overall hygiene of that place. It's a letdown.

Location wise it's not so easy find at a glance by the help of Google maps. Anyway step out at Rabindra Sadan & take an exit from nearest metro gate of Brand Factory or Forum Mall. Then ask for the location any of the local shop.

Ambience & Decor mostly nil from my view. The shop is situated in between a slum, . I'm very much doubtful about the hygiene of the food.

Now the food, we ordered
#egg_chicken_Szechuan_hakka_noodles
#egg_fried_rice
#hot_garlic_chicken
As per price quantity is good, they also allow customisation in rice or noodle, but when we came to taste it not so good, rice was quite good but Szechuan noodle wasn't. Hot garlic chicken was pretty average. Actually the coating of the chicken was just floating in the gravy.

Importantly if you are first time who is willing to go there then take some time in your hand because they don't have too much seating facility. May be you have to stand there for 20-30 mins for to getting your table.

Okay, please note these points.
1. Don't visit in weekends especially Sunday. They just have 4 tables available, rest all have to stand outside ( The area is extremely dirty and stinky ).
2. The staffs won't greet you, they aren't humble or trained at all.
3. Most of the items are unavailable.
4. Food is tasty, especially Momos but with all the above bad experiences your mood is likely to go bad.
5. They pronounce the bill, yes they just verbally say it and don't even give you a paper. When asked, they do give you but utter words like " Ah. 65√ó4 + 25 = 285 ". So basically they expect people to calculate the amount rather than expecting a slip / bill.
6. They don't even give you a glass of water unless you ask for it..

Not recommended for people who want to have quick food or are looking for good ambience.

This little food joint (very hard to locate though)  serves some authentic Tibetan dishes at a pocket friendly price. 
¬¨Roasted Chilli Pork is tender, juicy and delicious. Quantity is decent. This is a must try. 
¬¨Mixed Thukpa is nice loaded with plenty of prawn, sliced pork, some chicken and veggies. 
¬¨Grilled fish in schezwan sauce is hot and spicy. Leaves up to the expectations. 
¬¨Momos are ordinary, don't go by the hype. 

Yes, authentic Tibetan food lovers won't be disappointed with the taste or quantity but of course the ambience isn't suitable for dining out with family. College goers with a stringent budget do check this out.

One of the hidden gems of Kolkata indeed!!! This places is indeed hard to locate for someone who would visit for the first time..it is located near Chai Break. The entrance and ambience is not at all appealing to the eyes but once you set forth for the food..One would understand that why this place is always crowded! The momos, thupkas and the pork dishes are delicious and will want you to keep coming back for more. And I think that's the only best thing about that place.

Thank you Sananya Datta for re-introducing me to this gem of a eatery . My last visit here was in 2004 , I have absolutely no memory of that and was quite eager to be here.

Located very close to Chai Break Elgin road outlet, this is one place that is known to all true foodies. Very easy to be missed if not careful. Located in a dingy lane , there is lip smacking good. The entire rating number of 4/5 is based on the food. I have very few times come across any such good and authentic food at such prices.

We ordered the chicken steam momo, the pork pan fried momo , and the mixed chilli garlic noodles. The food was excellent and exceptional. The quantity and quality both were great and I am in love with the place . The momos were huge and filled to the brim.
Pan fried momos were awesome too. They used like juicy pork filling and it was filling .

Recommended highly to all who love Chinese food. Let's have it again soon.

Want to get a feel of ol' world Chinese ghetto or secret hideouts? This is the place. I'd given this place 4 out of 5 just for the ambience and food. Well, these are the two most important criterias for rating a restro, right? And hell, this place scored damn high. I'd never come to know of this place not if a friend mentioned.
Also, it was fun to locate this hidden treasure.I'd not give the location here but will just drop a hint. It's close to Rabindra Sadan metro. We ordered just two dishes -- Chicken steam Momos and Smoked Pork in BBQ sauce. Tha latter was delicious. It was refreshing to have a pork dish cooked in sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. It was like finger lickin' good. Juicy pieces of pork with fresh veggies. Perfect for quick appetizer! The only complaint is that the quantity is a bit less compared to the price and the soup that was served along with the momos wasn't up to the mark.(I get better soups in roadside momo stalls) Price is reasonable but might not hurt if the quantity is boosted up a bit. Otherwise, its a place for college goers like us with almost empty pockets and lots of appetite and plans and addas to conjure up.

Dont get scared from the outside environment as the ambience inside the restaurant is dim lit and comfortable. The food is great and in huge quantity, so be careful before ordering because one plate can easily serve two. The roast chilly pork is amazing. But as people praise the momo out there, i didn't find it that great.

Perfect place to throw a low budget birthday party and getting food parcelled for home.

Running out of money, but craving for some good food. Don't worry, Tibetan Delight got your back. 
Serving good food at very pocket-friendly rate, this place has been really popular among college-goers. A bit hard to find, it is located near elgin road crossing, through a narrow street.
Ambience may not woo you, but their served dishes definitely will. Try out their momos and thukpas.

the place is really hard to find; like really hard. the decor and the ambience is nothing that sort to mention. not even clean enough. heard a lot about the food. well the pan friend momo was steamed momo with a lot of chilli sauce. the pork with oyster sauce was good though. another good thing about it is no taxes. anyway, a really average experience

This place is definitely one of my favourites! Though the outlet is very small and located in a dingy alley but the quality and quantity of the food they serve is really worth the money. I have visited this place many a times with my pals and we have never been dissatisfied. The roasted chilli pork is lipsmacking and to die for. The noodles,momos,soup all are palatable. This is a very good place to visit if you are looking for chinese cuisine at reasonable prices.

Very few options to choose from, but if you are searching for Tibetian food, then this is the place.
Only 4 Tables available, so if you need a seat make sure you be there before time.

Tibetan Delight being a small restaurant would never fail to put up a big satisfying smile on an individual's face.

The place is wayyyyy too difficult to locate.
Went there with my friends to try authentic dishes.
We ordered chilli pork which was good but too few pieces and more of onions. Then we ordered chicken steam momo , I felt the stuffing was too less.
Then came fried rice (mixed, included pork) 
This dish was good. I loved the shrimps. They were fresh and i love sea food being served fresh .
Coming to the mixed chowmein, it had the right flavours but served cold (I prefer my dishes served piping hot!)
And yes, the gentleman serving at our table was nice 
Decor was okay...  I loved the fact that the moment we entered the staff immediately switched on the stand fan near our table,after all behavior matters as well.

This place being almost impossible to locate is a hidden gem. Despite of having only one small room and three to four tables, it is really popular among the young crowd of the city. Dim lighting and tibetan decor set the mood right from the beginning. Pricing is reasonable and quantity is quite good. Pork dishes are the speciality of this place but chicken pan fried momo is also recommended.

So I finally visited this place that I had heard of for so many days and from so many people.But what a huge disappointment it was.Nothing in this place that has got the name of a restaurant is appealing.AC is too much to expect and even the ceiling fan arrangement is awful.Basic hygiene is not there even.Frankly this is the worst eatery I have visited till date.The food is not at all up to the mark.I ordered Pan Fried Chicken Momos and Chicken Spanish Soup along with Chicken Coriander soup.The pan fried Momos though tasty,were spicy as hell.I finished all the drinking water that I was carrying because they didn't even serve us glasses of water and I didn't want to touch the dirty jug that was on the table.No tissue papers even.We had to ask for them.The soup,was the only saving grace.Lastly the price is a tad high compared to the gross quality of food served.In short,this was the worst experience I had.

They prepare very good momos and soups.Specially chicken thai soup. Also their thukpa is very nice.
But what i recommend is their Roasted chilly pork..soft juicy pork pieces tossed in a chilly sauce.Also their gravy noodles is tasty though some deterioration in taste when i visited last.

A shabby little foodie's delight located in a narrow alley in Elgin Road which almost missed our eye but kudos to Google Maps' accuracy. The place has limited seating, and is perfect for a quiet little meal. We had Veg Hakka Noodles and Chilli Fried Pork. The noodles could've been better and the quantity was a bit less for two. The pork was extremely delicious and leaves you wanting for more. A hidden gem in the truest sense of the term.

There are three things worth mentioning in my review. First, the walk upto the kerb of the restaurant is hauntingly beautiful. It's impossible to loacte if you don't consult who hasn't been there before. The walk is unbuilt, dingy, narrow (maximum two people can side by side if they are cautious about not hitting each other) and deserted. To me it felt like I was about to meet a drug lord in hiding. Second, the feel of a really old tibetan joint is up and about as soon as you reach. It's tiny with hardy  four tables inside. The lighting is dim and of asian furnishings. You can't see anything but your table. Third, the food. With all the built up expectation the food comes as a huge disappointment. Add to that the joint's crazy popularity and the disappointment dips. Nothing that I had is worth mentioning. The Momos were average, would anyday prefer momo plaza or thela walas. Maybe they did serve well a few years (decades) back, but as of now the charm is gone.

Locating this place is not only tricky, but the path is not smooth either. Well, the cleanliness status of the place is worse. Had to wait for about 30-40 minutes for a table.

The ambiance is very ordinary, keeping up the Tibetan theme up though. A place with very less seating arrangement.

The guy who took our orders had gutkha in his mouth. So he could hardly speak when we sought his suggestions in deciding the order or questioned him about any dish. Yes. That experience was awful.

Ordered the following:
Chicken Kothey
Roasted chilli pork
Mixed nonveg Mongolian rice
Mixed nonveg Schezuan rice
Manchurian chicken

Kotheys were tender, juicy, big and delicious! I definitely recommend this one.
Roasted chilli pork was tangy and mind-blowing. Just one issue; the plate had too much of capsicums and onions compared to pork pieces.
Both the rice dishes were good. The quantity was huge too.
The Manchurian chicken dish was a disappointment. It tasted very average and we regret ordering it.

This place, though located on Elgin road, can get slightly difficult to identify. It is through the narrow lane just next to Lakshmi Babu Jewelry Shop, almost opposite to P.C.Chandra Jewellers. The space is small with 3 tables inside and a couple of tables outside, but it makes up for the amazingly lip smacking food. It is one of those places that serve pork for a long time. The momos are outstanding and so are the other Chinese foods, both in terms of quality and quantity. The price is also very reasonable. I've been a regular visitor to this place for long and it was one of our regular place for celebrating birthday parties, get togethers, etc. Overall, I would be recommending this place for a quick bite or lunch/ dinner with friends. This is literally a hidden treasure for foodlovers.

Interior is very dim. The food is quiet good in quality and quantity as per the price. Though i feel the taste of momos has gone down,and i dont understand why they put extra oil in steam momos. We ha chicken and pork steam momos. The place gets constant customers,so one might give it a visit.

This place is located in a narrow lane exactly opposite to my house. Yet, it took me 19 odd years to know about its existence. Such is the location of Tibetan Delight. It's truly a hidden gem of Kolkata. I first visited this place when an old friend took me here. It was a reunion of sorts, and hence I developed a soft corner in my heart for it. Since then, I've visited this place about 10 times over the course of two years. The place is a little cramped for space, but the decor is thrilling. A dimly lit room, with chinese lanterns hanging over the tables give you a feel of the magical Land of the Dragon. Their chinese and tibetan dishes are too good. I have ordered Garlic Chicken, hakka chowmein, chicken fried rice, fried chicken momos, American Chopsuey, Chilli Pork, Schezwan chicken and egg noodles here. The quantity and quality they offer is too good compared to the cheap rates at which the dishes are priced. They offer a huge quantity in each plate, and two people having normal apetites may find it hard to finish two dishes between themselves. Among these, the one dish I will strongly recommend is their Garlic Chicken. They serve eight huge, boneless pieces of chicken with a lot of thick gravy at an affordable price. The gravy leaves you licking your fingers. I customarily order this dish everytime I visit this place, and I've also ordered just this dish for take-away on numerous occasions. The fact that they don't charge taxes makes the meal even cheaper! Overall, this place tops my list of favourite go-to restaurants if you want to eat to your heart's content without burning a hole through your pocket !

The restaurant is situated in a narrow lane just after the Rabindra Sadan Metro Gate 3 towards Bhowanipore. Even though the ambience here is not good but the food quality and quantity here more than enough to compensate the below average ambience thus a good rating of 4. And trust me, when I said food quantity I meant it, quantity is actually great at a very low cost. Me and my friends normally come here for a good session of 'adda' as we say alongside some good momos and pork dishes.

This is not a fancy place for those who like their ambience, this is more of a place where food is the primary concern. Their dry chili chicken is to die for, though I didn't enjoy the sweet and sour chicken. But the mixed fried rice quite made up for it.

This place serves the usual Chinese dishes and all of them including the momos, the soups, the chowmeins or the curries are pretty awesome. Proportions are good enough as well. One of the better places to have Chinese. Maybe a bit cramped for space, but other than that, a good enough restaurant

I studied in Bhaggu so Tibetan Delights was our usual hangout place for Chinese¬†food. Located in a dark alley at Elgin Road, the place is quite popular for authentic Indo-Chinese food. Some of the Must Try dishes are - Pan Fried Chicken Momo, Chicken Kothey, Chilly Pepper Chicken, Schezwan Chicken Noodles and Slice Pork with Hot Garlic.
One other good thing "was" Aunty, a very humble lady who knew how to serve and make customers comfortable. I used "was" because for the last six months or so she remains absent and now her daughter runs the place.¬†
Other than that, Tibetan Delight is not a delight now in terms of food, ambience or serving. The ambience was cool a decade ago, which they forgot to redecorate. They should change the lighting and the walls seriously need¬†a paint job. The daughter seems to be more interested in her mobile than in the restaurant. For the last 3 to 4 times of my visit, the food quality has gone down. Even the normal Chicken Lollypop was served cold and when I told them to warm it up, the response was that the plate is hot then how come the dish is cold. I mean, seriously, what the hell. I was shocked and that was the last of me. The waiter doesn't respond¬†very humbly and quickly. Though the pricing is good but not the experience. If this continues, the restaurant will be forced to close in a year or so. I was a regular there for more than 4 years but now I don't go and will never go.
P.S. - There are other restaurants¬†now in the area, go give it a try.

Tibetan Delight, is in Chowringhee,nearby to Elgin Road,just opposite to P.C.Chandra Elgin road showroom, in a small lane entrance. The taste of the food was undoubtedly good.
However, the place is rather dingy and the entrance is not upto the mark.Light dim reddish light make ambience ,calm and cool one. its a pocket friendly eatery joint with good taste of thai and chinese dishes.¬†
I recommend:

#Pan fried chicken momo
# chicken drums of heaven
# Chilli pork
#Chicken Kothey
#Mixed Noodles

Hidden from the main street lines of bhawanipur, this place serves some badass tibetan dishes. I went there a long time ago. Ordered steamed momos and schezwan veg noodles. Were good and i mean it. The ambience is pathetic btw. Dim lights make it more eerie. Cleanliness should be taken seriously here. Overall a good visit.

My friends and I went to this place last summer. Finding the location is a task in itself! The interior is pretty balmy due to lack of air conditioning. We ordered quite a few things out of which pork in Barbeque sauce was a favourite. We didn't like the chicken in oyster sauce ( too bland) ,but the momos were good. Would like to go back there again someday.

Went there a few months ago . I think the place is overrated . While I liked the mixed noodles , the schezwan chicken was too bland . Schezwan chicken is one of my favourite chinese dish and seeing the ratings of this outlet I didnt expect the food to be this tasteless . Also the lighting of this place should be improved .

Hidden inside a small lane beside Chowringhee Road, this place serves mouth watering indo-chinese/Tibetan food. Already famous for its dumplings, Tibetan delight also offers variety of other pork, chicken and fish starters. The soups are pretty good as well. The place is quite small, ambiance is ok. ¬†Staff was friendly and service was quick. Do visit this place if you are looking for the good chinese in pocket friendly rates in kolkata. A hidden gem.

An old authentic Tibetan place on the streets of chowringhee.... a hard palce to find out but once you do the rest is fine.... this is a small cozy place with great Tibetan foods....They are well known for their pork items and delightful momos..... their oyster sauce items are also very good... you would have a bit china town feeling once you visit this place..... so if you are a Tibetan food fan then this place is a must visit.

This used to be one of my favourite joints during my childhood days. Awesome Chinese and Tibetan food used to be served here. Their pan fried momo was always the best among all the other momo joints in my knowledge. But now, the quality and quantity of the food have degraded over the years. Slow service and not a very clean place to dine at.

I had read good reviews about this place on zomato itself and went on a visit with high expectation,but was disappointed to a good level.I won't complain about the conjested place much then i will not have the space to talk about it's food. I ordered pan fried momo in schezwan sauce,the sauce was not only too salty but also excessively spice.To get over the utterly wierd and amazingly terrible taste of it ordered chicken clear soup which was nothing but boiled chicken floating over tasteless water. I don't know how people say it's a good restaurant at cheap price,they should charge no money for such foods. I will never make a mistake to visit that place again.

Worst environment i have ever seen. Rats and cockroaches are roaming around freely. Total unhygenic! If you order something you might get cockroach fry or smoked rat as complementary dish like i had!!.

Check properly before having your order if you are ok with the unhygenic environment and do care only for food quality.

Or else you can end up in hospital instead.

The location and hygiene is a huge issue with this food joint. Even though they serve really great food, but you just dont feel like enjoying the food untill you have a proper ambiance. It has just 4 tables in a small room with old, gloomy, and shabby decor . We ordered fried momos and chilly pepper chicken. The food was no doubt good. But then again you just dont feel like its worth the price at place where proper cleanliness and hygiene is not taken care of.

Tibetan Delight is a chinese resturant.It locates near Rabindra sadan metro.But it's very difficult to locate it's exact location. It's a very small resturant with only 4 tables sitting arrangement.Ambience is average.Light dim reddish light make ambience mysterious,calm. 

       I have visited today evening with my friend.But we were disappointed.Not only because of their cold lumpy food ,the staff's behaviour was also rough.
    We ordered Chicken steam momo which was just like palatable.It was cold ,poor.Next we took Egg Thupka Which was not soo bad as  like as momo but tasted average.

     Overall this resturant is not worthy of eating anyway,some how overhyped.And staff's behaviour was so rough ,not expected now a days. So ,it is not recommended.

Tibetan Delight a Chinese restaurant at Elgin. Visited here today and had a poor experience. Took their Chicken Momo when they served without warming it up. When I complained about it, they said as I have tasted it they can't do anything else. Are we supposed to touch to food and check if it is warm or not ? And tje soup they gave with the momo was nothing but cold salty water. The footpath Rs.10 momos would have tasted much better.
This is not the 1st time I dined in here. Never faced such thing before. My last experience here was much better.
Took the Thuppa which was average.
Bad experience.
Tibetan Delight please know to look after your guest and let them not suffer due to your mistake.

I tried there momos and my favourite is pan fried deep fry pork momos. *Heavenly* !!
The chilli pork is also amazing.even smoked pork with schezwan sauce.

It's really tough to find this place initially. Even the place is quiet small. But when the food came I would say it was really yummy. We ordered the smoked pork in schezuan sauce, mixed fried rice Singapore style, chicken lollypop, pork in oyster sauce. The pork was cooked really well, it was soft. The sauce of the pork was really tasty. The pork with oyster sauce was a bit bland. But overall it was a good food experience.

Chilli potk was the best and dry chilli chicken too.I think they prepare proper chinese food. If you are thinking about the ambience then it's a wrong place for you but about food it's a must have and i visit this place several times mainly for their roasted chilli pork.

It is a lil difficult yo locate if you're going there for the 1st time.When I took my friend there,he thought I was gonna sell him to some other guy.Lol.The place does not boast of its ambiance.A very small place with 4tables. Now I know people love their momos but being a faithful worshipper of Denzong,I beg to differ.The dough is a bit thicker and the filling is a lil less than the usual.The pan fried lollipops are a perfect combination of crispy and spicy.They fill you up very fast.Noodles are good,both the Hakka and the gravy ones.But the one thing that is a must try over here is their roast chilli pork.Brilliant.You won't find such great quantity of lip-smacking Chinese and Tibetan cuisine within such a small budget anywhere in Kolkata.

The first time i took my friends here, they though it was some elaborate plan of mine to mug them of their belongings, later they realized that the only thing i mugged was the impression from their mind that only flashy places have got good food. Used to be a bi-monthly visit at the minimum for me before i switched cities. Still try to make it once there when i am in Cal.

A bit hard to find, would recommend asking the locals. The inside is very small with plastic tables and chairs but the interior decors give it a nice look. Coming to the food, tried their momos, were nice, nothing extraordinary. The rice quantity was very average and we had difficulties to share them in numbers of two because it wasn't e out. But the main dish was very big and we couldn't finish the main dish with the rice given. You could go for it, if you're in the area

A true hidden gem. -0.5 for the decor,ambience and especially the entrance(You will have a hard time locating it. The narrow passage leading to it will give chills to first timers during night). The food is superb in taste. Quantity: Admirable. Price: Comparatively cheap probably because you don't have to pay tax.
Now everyone must have heard and read the reviews all pointing to momos and noodles and porks etc.
But a must try dish is Thukpa from this place. They make awesome thukpas and damn its such a soul soothing and wholesome dish. Any starter or a side dish with a bowl of chicken thukpa, a perfect dinner for me and my girl(yes we love thukpas :P).
Overall, our experiences in this place have been pretty good so far.

This was one of my favorite food joint in kolkata as it was always a pocket-friendly one dealing with superb quality of food! I have been visiting this place for the last 3 years now. But I was really disappointed after visiting this place last saturday. Overpriced food,which I still would have ignored had the quantity  and quality of the food been good. I ordered a mixed noodles where hardly did I find any meat apart from a few pieces of scrambled egg and hell lot of vegetables. The plates,spoons and forks they use are literally never washed properly perhaps. And keeping in mind the location, the ambience and the behavior of the people at the joint,it is not worth the price,the time and the wait these days. 
Well,before visiting here next time,I bet,I have to rethink quite a few times.

The taste of the food was undoubtedly good.
This is one of the few places that use solid slices of pork meat which does not contain any rind.
However, the place is rather dingy and the entrance to this is not a Tibetan delight in the least.
The people who were serving are well mannered, unlike many other places of this standard in India.

I recommend:
#Pan fried pork momo
#Sweet and Sour Pork

The ENTIRE rating is strictly based on the food. Do not go by the location  (which is quite difficult to find), by the decor (as you might also find it dingy and unclean), by the service (nobody really cares), by the cutluries (try cleaning them before you put food on it). 
But there is a BUT.
And it is the food that they serve, the quantity of it, and the amount at which you get it. No complains there whatsoever.  
If you are out of money and craving for good chinese, this is the place to be. 
We had stuffed ourselves with pork hot and sour soup, pork pan fried momo, roast chilly pork, mixed fried rice. Very satisfied ! Thumbs up. üëç

I heard a lot about this place from my friend so thought of giving it a try today .. the momo we took had only onions and not chicken but the sauce was tasty , then we ordered thukkpa  (it was a Tibetan delight's special ) to my utter disappointment the prawn was not cooked it had a terrible stench , then we took chicken in barbeque sauce to me it was more of a dried chilli chicken with vegetables . The place is not at all hygienic .. it is a hidden gem only in terms of price coz they don't charge taxes .

Discovered this place from Zomato and gave it a visit today when people reviewed and said that they make the best pan fried momos in town!

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: Well, the mistake I had made last time with Hamro Momo.. I didn't even dare to look at the kitchen of this place. Still, not a hygienic place. The two staffs had a very weird, casual attitude.

FOOD: To the reviewer who said that they make the best pan fried momos in town - I don't know what was he even thinking! Or is it our bad luck today that we were served the worst.. WORST MOMO! Were they even Momos? Forget about pan fried! The Momos were so soggy that we couldn't even CUT out a piece.  It was all mixing in the sauce itself and becoming a "khichdi"! Mostly onion in the already very little filling. The sauce was sweet - as a result of putting lots of tomato ketchup, clearly! Chicken Thukpa was equally bad. I, personally, don't like thin noodles! No other veggies except smelly spinach, cabbage and carrots. And then there were smelly chicken pieces too.

Given the quality of food and ambiance and service here altogether, the pricing is too much!
The zomato reviews were misleading and we definitely tried the wrong stuffs.
Sorry, there is not a single thing for which it deserves a rating more than 1.0!

Yesterday Evening suddenly I had an urge for Chinese cuisine and with in an hour and after covering nearly 20kms, I found myself at a place where "Ali Baba" with "Google Maps" won't be able to find them. 

 Thanks to the "Reviewer's" and there truthful reviews I had a rough idea of what I was walking into. 

But seeing there UTTER LACK OF HYGIENE in the KITCHEN I was shocked like anything.

A desperately request to all the foodies who are visiting this place. Please take a peek at their kitchen and see yourself WHERE the Food is being cooked.

After hearing a lot about this great place I visited twice in last monsoon. Ambience is a big zero. Dark single room with no AC and suffocation. Backside of that room is a waiting space turned dining space with one sitting table where cat roams around. Only one service boy and the owner herself sitting in front of the guests. I had a couple of short chats with her (Nima Lamu is the name if I remember correctly) about the history of this place which started their business during British era. It was wonderful to talk with her. Coming to food. In one word - excellent, but when you look at the price, you have to say 'its exceptional'! Zero maintenance cost probably makes it feasible. No proper invoice or bill. They just give hand-written slips with no tax added. Special mention - Pork momo, Chicken gravy noodles and above all Roasted Chilli Pork. Heavenly taste! It is a delight indeed! One of the must visits in Kolkata.

They say, never judge a book by its covers. And this totally goes for Tibetian Delight. I really didn't wish to dine in here, the entrance was shabby. Yet on my friend's constant nagging, we ended up here as we were too hungry.
Ordered the basic chicken hakka noodles and a  chicken dish. I really liked the preparation, honestly. Both quantity and quality were good. Chicken pieces were soft and moist.
Our bill was around 290. No extra tax need, hence you return with happy tummies.

I first went there almost half a decade ago with friends, and of course in the first year of college. Trust me, here you'll find the most delish and most pocket friendly Tibetan dishes ever.

Finding this place is quite tricky, so go ahead and ask anyone nearby. The dingy lane, shabby d√©cor might be a huge turn off but just wait till the food is served.

(Here's a li'l secret : this place has a mid-century Chinese drug den vibe - you know, dim red lights, dark dingy lanes, smoke filled rooms. This place has everything except the drug lords and the smoke filled rooms. üòâ)

Anyway, khilli apart, whatever you eat, just make sure you try these specialities of Tibetan Delight:

üî∏Chicken Lollipop (Pan-fried with sauce)
üî∏Roasted Chilli Pork
üî∏Pork in Hot Garlic sauce
And of course,
üî∏The Momos!!!

Their Chicken Lollipop is one of my absolute favorite. They are yumm!! *Slurp*

Located in the quiet interior of an alley in Bhowanipore, this place is a hidden gem in every possible way.
You might find yourself in a queue because the place houses  only four tables, but the wait will be worth it.
The place is dimly lit with paper lanterns which kind of provide a calm ambience. It's quiet shabby, but who cares, you're going there for the edible stuff.
Rest assured that you'll get an array of flavours with each bite, all of them hitting the right notes.
I ordered the pan fried chicken momo(yum), chicken noodles with gravy(yum) and the roasted chilli pork(yum yum yum :D).
A must try place for all.

This place is over hyped! The ally and the dim lit interior was adding to the shady image , but probably that is the charm of ¬†the place. The veg momo we ordered was not hot enough. The thukpa that we ordered lacked salt and taste. We simply loved the ginger veg . The pork side dish that we ordered was good to taste but a bit under cooked. Now , I have to prasie the pork chopsuey , it ¬†was sour and savory and one of the most filling and tasty chopsuey I have ever had.

I had been to this well known chines joint innumerable no of times.though yhey have very less place but its always full because of the mouth watering food they serve.
The chinese dishes are always sp well prepared. I like the pork preparation of them a lot but might have tried a max ni of dishes.. i would have rate much more if u can keep the area a bit clean.. the benefit fo having food over here is no extra taxes. Pay only for what you eat.

A pocket friendly place to have good tibetan food.
It's a small cosy place.... The staffs over there were friendly... and the service was real quick.
We ordered Thai Chopsey (Non veg), Roast chilli pork , Chicken Fried Rice and chilli fish with hot garlic sauce... Thai chopsey was very tasty .. and tWe he pork was good too... We were trying fried rice & chilli fish here for the 1st time.. well, Fried ¬†rice was ¬†okay but the fish preparation was not at all tasty.....

Located opposite pc chandra jewellers near rabindra sadan metro station, it is on of the best kept secrets in kolkata culinary world. Hidden among narrow alleys, it is a treasure hunt for a first timer. The momos and thukpas are really nice and the ambience is shady and age old. There are limited seats on offer and it remains houseful irrespective of time and day.

Lovely food at a very cheap price. The problem is the lack of an air conditioner which made life difficult for us as we went during a blazing afternoon.
Do try the momos and the main course pork dishes.

what to say bout this place ..I am ¬†a frequent customer of this place ..try out MOMOs soups, Chicken Drums ticks..fried rice or chicken ..you will love it...though the place is not an A/C restaurant but that no issue when u have a hidden gem lyk this..the only reason of giving 4 is guys if you are looking at it plz do something with the seating..because often it gets crowded and the outside wetting lawn is also small, in that case customer may not feel like waiting and may go back..

You might address this place as The place to have tibetan food. It is a bit hard to locate and a very small place. There is no ac. So, if you are okay with having good food at a not so elite place, this is where you go. All the items are affordable and tasty. The roasted chilli pork is their signature dish and it truly is amazing.

Over hyped yet again! Visited after hearing a lot from friends that there is a place behind momo plaza in the nook which serves awesome food. They brought me here to relive their childhood and man they were taken aback. But I found a new variety of momo's here definitely Thts 'onion momo's' on asking the waiter that we had ordered chicken momo's so kindly get those as well to which he replied 'ye chicken momo he hai aur agar problem hai to Malik se baat Kar lo' haha who the hell says that ? But it was a big turnoff after walking in those narrow galli's with high expectation and having onion momo's instead of Chicken!! My friends were saddened and has to go to orchid to feel good!

I had heard about this place for a long time.....finally visited it last week. Since i was out for a client meeting, decided to have a quick bite instead of a trying out too many things. So i ordered for Pork in Barbeque Sauce with a cold drink. Awesome taste... the pork was very well cooked and they provide mainly fatless pieces.Good quantity as well. Plan to visit again very soon. Only challenge was the location of the place which is difficult to find out for the first timers.

Have you ever played a game called "treasure hunt?" Well, that's how we felt while searching for the place. Even GPS wasn't sure how to reach this little place which has got such hidden treasure in the form of food. It is situated just opposite to P. C. Chandra Jewelers in a very-very narrow lane near Elgin road. Coming to the food part, it was good. The ambiance was cool. Authentic Tibetan food. Their kotheys (a kind of steamed on the one side as well as fried on the other momo) were something new that we had tried. It did not disappoint us.

Awesome cool ambiance to have food especially in a Non-Ac environment.Don't freak out as this place is in a narrow alleyway just before elgin road while you are coming from bhawanipore or south side,when you finally enter this place you would forget the passage through which you came.Now coming back to the point this friend is a good place for student hangouts as the food is good,pocket friendly and the ambiance.The pork hakka chow which I tried I felt that the pork in it was not well cooked otherwise would have given more ratings

Yesterday me with my friend went to this place.It is situated inside a very narrow lane near Elgin Road opposite to PC chandra Jewellers.We heard a lot about this place so went there with lots of expectations.It was a small dingy place with only 4 tables and no AC.
Now coming to the food,

We Ordered : Chicken Steamed momo, Chicken Thukpa and chicken Drumsticks.
Food Ordered For Takeaway : Chicken Pan fried momo, Chicken Fried Rice and Manchurian Chicken.

TASTE of the momo was average and the filling of chicken inside it was very less in amount..It was served with a tasteless soup.
CHICKEN thukpa was decent in taste.It was mild in flavour with lots of noodles,vegetables and boiled chicken pieces.
CHICKEN drumstick was deep fried and served with a hot sauce,though the batter was very thik.

These 3 dishes which we had in the restaurant were good.But we were very disappointed by the takeaway food.

Chicken Pan fried momo : It was tossed in a very spicy red sauce with almost no filling inside the momo.It tasted so hot that it was literally getting impossible to consume.
Chicken fried rice : Tasteless, Mushy rice with no seasoning, less amount of chicken and prepared with hell lot of Black pepper.It was disgusting.
Manchurian chicken : probably the only dish which was good.

Overall I thik it is very over hyped place regarding its standard.Prices are also on the higher side considering this place has no AC, where many other restaurants with all these facilities charge lesser amount than this restaurant. The menu card that is in zomato is the older one.. Not a good start to Pujor pet pujo....

Definitely an overhyped place. We ordered a chicken steamed momo, one soft drink and a mixed haka noodle.The pocket touch was just 260 and that is the only bright side of Tibetan Delight experience. I have heard a lot about this place and its heritage, and took real pain to find it out.
The biggest disapponitment is the hygiene condition of this place. Well I will like to clarify thatI am quintessential Bengali thrift and try every fast food/streetfood places I come to know about. The open sewerage,stinky narrow lanes are pointers to far worse hygiene inside the small little family run restaurant... Their bright red lighting and dark worn out walls may act somewhat of a camouflage to not so attentive guests.
Coming to food, chicken momos were too miser in stuffing.Although it was juicy, to my surprise it tasted sour. I hope it was an overdose of vinegar and not the case of perished ingredients. Finger crossed till tomorrow morning for that! Mixed noodle tasted like any regular footpath stall and chicken or porkpieces were not visibly too many
Apart from the dark dingy rooms, I felt the service guy was also sullen. I wont deduct a point here as he was the only serving fellow and perhaps was tired or was not in his mettle,somehow. Also fyi, the place has no ac and lacks proper venatillation(no windows except one ope ong to kitcheb and the other has an adjoining wall).Therefore, it may be quite u comfortable in the most humid months if you are not taking away.

This was my first time and i was quite excited cause i heard a great deal about this this place! As it was a holiday had to wait a bit but that was totally fine. We started with Chicken Momo, Pork momo and Pork Kothey. Compared to the Momos the Kothey was something different and should be a must try avoid if u are allergic to pepper. Then we ordered Pork Fried Rice, Hakka Chicken Noodles with Smoked pork with Schezwan sauce. The chicken pieces in the noodle was just boiled and served . My hopes were really high with the Schezwan pork but it all came down with the first bite and mostly the pieces were composed of mainly fat. Either it was a bad day for me or the chef was in bit rush. Overall its a pocket friendly joint for college students and i am sure i will be back for more till the next time the rating is 2.5 for me.

Price is very Reasonable, and taste and quantity is GREAT. Must try "Roasted Chilli Pork".¬†
You might have to wait to get a table, because the place is small and most of the time it is Full.

Was hearing a lot about this place from my friends so today we decided to visit the place for lunch before a movie outing.

Location: Really hard to find,really slender lanes running in between restaurants and buildings all standing tall beside the small joint.

Type: Its not really a restaurant, its a rather walk in Chinese joint that serves mediocre quality food with pocket friendly rates.

Ambience: Not at all decorated like the other restaurants around it but it looks decent with the Chinese luv a lamps. Other than the lamps the place is not at all maintained at all with dust and spider webs dangling here and there on the walls. The tables were those normal plastic ones with no table decorations and the sauce variants kept on the table didn't looked good enough for trying. So for ambience 2 out of 5

Service: There are only four tables with a single waiter handling all the tables but inspite of this he does good service. For service 4 out of 5

Food Quality: We ordered a chicken soup which was good with huge amounts of chickens but the only thing that disappointed was the amount of black pepper that made it spicy but due to the rainy weather our friend who ordered it loved it. We didn't had time for starters so we decided to order the main course. The plates were really normal with no garnishing at all. We ordered schwean chicken with schwean fried rice and for myself i ordered mongolian mix fried rice. The quantity was good but the taste and quality was maching the price tag(mediocre). The schwean fried rice was really very spicy unlike the mongolian one. Both the quantities were enough to fill our tummies. But the quality of the rice used in the fried rice were very normal.¬†

Overall: When you are really hungry,does't bother about the quality of food,and the decors, this place promises to satisfy your wish in every sector.

HEART : I am always looking for places with a heart, unlike the new age restaurants and pubs and shallow shisha joint, with garbage food and glamorous ambience, which attract the new IT - LOT who have enough money to waste pointlessly............. TIBETIAN DELIGHT IS A PLACE WITH A HEART.

They are not running after show, but what a restaurant or eating house should be about, serving good food. And since they stick to the most important aspect of this business, even though it is difficult to find, people find it. Even if people have to wait, people wait. The food quality is pretty awesome, its stomach filling, satisfying, priced very reasonably and logically (which is what matters).And I really don't know where they can improve. I have no interest to tell them to improve the ambience or anything to attract the WICH ( a wich means, wallet rich , who have no responsibilities and can spend a whole lot on just themselves or their so-called-lovers, but they are just the middle class kids ). Tibetian Delight - Keep serving the good food, and you will never run out of customers.

I really don't want to talk about the ambience at all. Yes! It's that shabby. Coming to the food, we ordered a chicken manchurian fried rice. It's just like a normal fried rice. I don't know why have they added 'manchurian' to it. The Chicken in Thai Sauce was again very much average. Basically if you are a pork lover you may visit. But if you don't, better avoid this place. Momo plaza, orchid, etc in that area are better, both in ambience and food at similar prices.

It is very hard to locate this restaurant as it is situated in a very small corridor lane. I went there with a friend of mine so it was easy to locate. I am from tangra and as soon as I entered, you know what was in my mind? Tibetan delight resembled a low budget AhYung ( a chinese restaurant situated in narrow lane in Chinatown). We ordered two pork steam momo and thai chicken soup. The momo tastes likes how my mom makes it at home so I enjoyed it. But the place could get some touch up as it looks scary at night.

I usually prefer their all kind of starters.. I love their "Smoked chicken with red pepper" , "Chicken in barbecue sauce" & "Smoked chicken with schezwan sauce".. but I don't like main course here.. if u don't have enough money at the end of the month just go there and satisfy ur stomach with their delicious foods because this place is very pocket friendly.. ;)

When I was in college I often used to go there to eat momos whenever I had cravings. Though I don't eat porks and all my friends always used to order this pork thupka I suppose and they always used to say that it's nice. Similarly, I in fact find the momos are awesome, not only that but I also used to take parcels for my mom and my siblings. This place is quite old and the space is really small but one must come here to taste the quality food they prepare.

First thing first.... If you are searching for this restaurant, there is a huge chance, like us, that you have missed the small entrance..... Better ask people.... It'll save time.... üòÄ 
Now, the restaurant is a 'no fancy, decent food ' kind of restaurant, and the place is very stuffy and small....
But, the food they offer is quite good in quality and also in @quantity.... Do not order all the items together.... If you love authentic Tibetan and Chinese food, this place may surprise you....

One scarily dingy lane between rabindra sadan metro and the turn towards forum mall leads you to this fabulous but underrated place. I visited this restaurant back in 2012 and it has not changed much since then. That food is still great which is a positive thing but the ambience god! Age old table and chairs, same old lights covered with Chinese lanterns. The food however makes you look beyond the flaws. The pork momo is beyond words! We had also ordered chilli pepper chicken, pan fried chicken momo, hakka noodles, chilli pork. There's no complaint about the food whatsoever. Quality and quantity wise. Plus so reasonable!!!!
If only they change the ambience the place would be so much better a place to dine in. üòäDishari Sarkar

It's in Elgin. Very near to my college. So we visit this place often. Brilliant Chinese food and very pocket friendly. The only drawback is the seating area. This place is very small. One needs to wait outside to get seats and the waiting area is not good at all. But this is still a favorite place to hangout.
P.S. No VAT or service tax!

Tibetan delight is quite a famous food joint but very difficult to locate. Just get down at the Elgin road gate of the rabindra sadan metro and take a left turn. Easiest way is find out is to ask the shopkeepers and they will tell u. It located inside a very narrow lane which u would normally not notice. 
It is a very small place but well lighted with lampshades. There are I guess 4 tables with 4 chairs in each of them. 
Now coming to the food... It is just great. I have had pan fried momo, chicken chowmin and other items. The pan fried momo tastes great. The quality and the quantity both is good enough. And worth of your money. The pocket pinch is not very high either. 
Service is quite good.

I heard about this joint couple of years back but couldn't identify its location, as it is situated in very narrow lane near Elgin Road.. But the day discovered, it was very crowded I didn't get chance to enter.... Finally one evening I manged to wait for half an Hour to taste the delicacies of this restaurant... I ordered
1. Chicken Kothey [ 3 / 5 ]- Taste of Momo was good but the filling of Chicken inside it was very less... Sply now a days when Wow Momo outlets r giving a tough competition to other momo makers,they should think of improving its quality ....¬† It was served with soup, tasteless, just flavored boiling water, u can get better soup if u buy Momo from Exide More vendors...

2. Chilly Pork - [4/5] - Excellent ,spicy but chewy chunks of Pork as they use¬† fat-less piece..Good for three- four people bcoz at time u'll feel over eaten...

Best part of this restaurant is that their food is cheap and they don't charge vat n service tax on ur bill..
Another afternoon I went for Lunch n ordered

1. Chicken Thukpa [4 /5 ] - Good portion ,Mild taste ,U might have to add condiments to enhance its taste a little...

Last Thursday 20 July 17 we went for lunch at this place.. Due to Rain the hotel ambience looked more shabby..
We ordered
1. Chilly pork (4/5) - Perfect taste ,only they should increase the portion of pork slices in it..
2. Egg chicken Hakka noodles (5 /5)- Light and thin noodles, less oily .....
3. Hongkong Chicken ( 5/5) - Light , tangy ,lemony gravy chicken prep, with eight pcs. of chicken and chunks of onion and capsicum in it..It has a mild flavour of peper, star anise in it.. But Small pcs.of star anies may irritate u....
4. Egg chicken fried rice (4.5/5)
Bill was around 600, Best part is they dont charge taxes seperatly...
They should think about cleaning and renovating the@ place a bit...
Nov 17 , 2 days went for lunch...
1st day oredered
Mix Thukpa (5/5) : Good in quantity and quality as well...
Next day orderd :
1. Tibetian delight spl chowmin (4 /5) : Good at taste but quantity is not sufficient for 2 people..
2. Mix chowmin (4/5):
3. Hongkong chicken (3 /5): Taste was not same as earlier...
They took lot of time to prepare spl chow r chicken preparation, as the quantity was not sufficient we ordered another mix chow,which also took more than 15min to arrive on my table ..

Seated amidst dark alleys, the backsides of houses and some ups and downs which you must jump over, it's a hideaway for excellent Tibetan food. It's only slightly bigger than a shack, but once you've had their momos nowhere else's taste the same. Highly recommended. Want to visit again.

This is a really small place. And not so good ambience. But don't go with its looks. This place serves the best Chinese and tibetan food. Momos were really juicy and thukpa was awesome. Roasted pork chilli was simply fantastic.
I really recommend everyone to try their food.
I bet y'all visit this place again and again.

My friend and I visited this place solely for their momos. And they were amazing. We had chicken steamed momo and the pork pan fried momo. They were both really good. The chutney was a bit sour and not spicy at all, but the gravy from the pan fried momo made up for it. We even had crispy chilli baby corn which was very oily , but tasty. The food all in all was good , like you would expect in a place like this. It is extremely pocket friendly. Getting there is a bit tricky but ask anyone and you'll know because it's pretty famous in that area. Would go there again.

This gem of a place is located in Elgin Road. Opposite P.C Chandra Jewellers, Elgin Road and near Rabindra Sadan metro station. It may be bit difficult to locate since its situated inside an alley. The place serves amazing yet pocket friendly food. Service is quick. One should definitely try out their Chilli Pork and the momos. All in all you can let out a happy burp after you come out of the place.

Firstly, I would say that one should not go there hoping to land up in some spacious restaurant. The restaurant is pretty small with only four tables. But the quality of food makes it up for the small place. The momos are great and unique. A great place to enjoy pork and traditional Tibetan delicacies.

It's a small dingy place with only 4 tables. I heard of this place a lot, so went with a bit high expectations. However it didn't really met my bars.
Starting with the good one, the schezwan noodles was really good. But the fried and garlic chicken could have been much better. 
I heard that they do serve some great momos and chilli pork, so will surely try out that some other time.

Tibetian culinary at your service. The place is located in a akward passage and you may have trouble finding it. ¬†Facing brand factory move to right u will find a small passage,follow the path and voila!
Now let us come to the ambience, its dark. Not like the DC movies but the darkness gives a calm feeling. The decoration with lights over every table makes it a decent ambience,specially for couples desiring candle light dinner without candle.
The service was good, their behaviour was good and the whole ¬†thing about the place was good.
Now lets come to the main part... FOOOD!!!!We ordered Pan fried pork momos and chilli pork.... Believe me the momos were like melting in the mouth and the sauce was sweet sour spicy, in one word mouth watering..thats two word though. The chilli pork had the chill in them and the meat was juicy,that shows the choice of meat.
It is a very nice place to hangout as the pocket pinch will also be satisfying for students.¬†Overall it was a decent experience and yes they do have chicken.So those who dont like pork, come here, order a chicken dish, droll over the pork dishes in the menu,order and taste them and now you also like eating pork..

When I had heard the name I was bit surprised because elgin is very known to  me and i have  never heard this name . But when i reached the  place i was more shocked 2 find  out dat place. The place  situated in a very shady maze lane. Even u cant imagine that if there any Restaurant  was....but the thing is its little bit  difficult to find out the Restaurant.  The Restaurant  consisted only 4 tables , non ac. But if you ask about the food, it's  just  awesome....and pocket  friendly too. The Chinese  lovers can find the  place good for getting  the authentic  chinese food . May b you don't  like  the  ambience  of the Restaurant but food is just finger licking.

several non veg options. nicely cooked tasty food. very cheap. the access to the place is extremely shabby and difficult to find out by yourself for the first time. but this is a popular place that everyone around knows of. nothing luxurious. dim lighting.
Tip: avoid in peak summers. enjoy in winters and rainy season. try using a chopstick instead of a fork.

A place situated somewhere inside the maze named Eligin road, dingy and shady at first glance but once you enter the premises, it is no less than a Pandora box full of Tibetan food gorgeousness! The pork momos both fried and steamed are lip smacking and the happy people around will make you happier! Pocket pinch? You can proudly say "It's my treat, today!" to your friends.

Loved the food. Amazing! Though a bit difficult to find, the food is definitely worth the search. Panfriend Pork Momo is bliss. The sauce they serve is something to crave for. Damn. 

Though the place is a bit small and dimly lit, the food quality and quantity will make you forget about the discrepancies. Recommended highly.

Price is okayish and no tax or such is added to the total amount which makes it reasonable too. Staffs are also good. A must try.

Its a tiny shabby eatery,in a small easy to miss lane opposit to PC Chandra Jwellers, Elgin Road. I had heard of it too many times but never had the chance to visit. It's one of thw momo pioneers in the city. Their thukpa is easily the best thukpa I've had in Kolkata. they serve both pork and chicken variants of momos, chowmeins, friedrice and thukpa. The momos were okay.

Not a fancy AC restaurant, but the food can be tough competition to the best Chinese restaurants in the city. We tried Mongolian rice, chilli fried pork and chicken in pepper and each one was equally delicious. A must try restaurant! üòä

Location: If you're coming from exide, this place will be on your left. Cross the lane that leads to forum, keep going straight, keep an eye for an aisle on your left. head straight down the aisle, turn right and you'll find this eatery.

Ambience: dark and shabby with red china lights hanging from the ceiling. Plastic chairs and the use of age old crockery( some of the plates have broken edges) worsen the experience .I've been here quite a few times, especially when I run low on cash. Food Quality and the overall hygine of this place is really questionable. Once you spot the open drains, the dirty kitchen and the place where they wash the dishes, you won't have the appetite for sure.However, I like their pork dishes ( the dry preparations). Momos here is good but not worth the hype. The pan fried momos have soggy coatings and Sweet and sour chicken tastes like boiled mixture of water and ketchup.¬†
If you have a stomach made of steel, give this place a visit.

Don't know about gem but this one is truly a hidden place. Well known for their Momos but very difficult to find. Patience is virtue with this good expectation shall we start this journey?

Location : Take a deep breath before you start to search this place. Better if you like adventure. First locate the HDFC Bank on Elgin Road that is near to one of a Rabindra Sadan metro gate out. Just opposite to that you will find M/s. M. Das. Jewellers. Cross the road & just beside that you will find a very thin lane. Don't get afraid enter into that lane & go straight then take right. There's no banner or hooding outside, so its impossible in every angle to understand that there's a restaurant inside. So be prepare for that.

Decorations : It was like getting into a cave, dark ambience inside, lights focused on the tables only. There was sittings for hardly 16-20 people managed withing very small space.

Staffs & Management : At that time a single person was there to take the orders & serve the food. Even the restaurant was pretty empty at that time still they took quite a long to serve the food on table. So order whatever you need at once.

Food : With pretty obies choice we started the journey with their momos & ended up trying few items. There was quite a large options to choose from various Chinese dishes.

Pork Pan Fried Momo : As per other reviewers on Zomato their Momos are must try. These were one of the most biggest momos I had tried. Unlike other pan fried momos this one was just steamed momos dipped into the tangy sauce. Momos were big in size but it was absolutely empty inside. Only 10% was filled with the pork meat. Sauce was excessive tangy & over spicy that didn't tasted good. Personally I didn't found anything to be liked about their momos. Actually it was less momo more pickle.

Chilli Garlic Egg Hakka Noodles : Noodles were served in a plate & of very thin quality. Vegetables were very nicely sliced, eggs were fried & mixed well. But good things stopped here, garlic was diced into small pieces in it, that felt odd crunchy in mouth & got stuck in teeth. It was not how garlic noodles should be & it just made the taste worst. Although it wasn't very oily but the quantity was pretty less.

Roast Chilli Pork Dry : A restaurant can't make good pork isn't a good Chinese Restaurant for me. Roast Chilli Pork is most common over here. Served in a plate sliced pork pieces were pretty big. But diced capsicum & onion pieces were used more than the meat itself. Meat was nicely tendered, spicy & well cooked. It tasted good but not very good cause I had tried better pork than this before.

Pricing : Pricing on the menu card was quite similar to other simple Chinese restaurants. Our total bill for all the above mentioned dishes were Rs. 375 with no extra Vat or Service Tax. But considering the food's quantity, quality & non AC environment I can't say it a satisfactory one.

Conclusion : Coming to the final words, A low on pocket Chinese hub famous & highly rated for their Momos, Is It really good? Is it recommended? Well, Absolutely Not. The food quality was not up to the mark & not at all preferable for Chinese food lovers.

Finding this place is difficult,as this is tugged inside a narrow lane oppositte p.c chandra jewellers at Elgin Road.The ambiance,is not beckoning,its rather a dingy place,with a crammed up seating space,which again is dimly lit.However, its the food,that would make me wanna go back to this joint,again and again.Chinese never tasted so good,quantities were never so generous and the pocket pinch was never so light...all hail Tibetan Delight..The Mixed Hakka Noodles,the Chicken in Oyster sauce and the Pan Fried momos are few such dishes from this place...which I fell for...This indeed was a treasure hunt...

This is one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata. It's small, it's cheap, and it serves very tasty food. The location might be a huge turnoff for some but trust me, their food is as good as any out there. However, the schezwan chicken that they serve is not the best. The menu is versatile, the service is prompt and the atmosphere is cozy. Dim lighting adds to the charm of the restaurant. Seating arrangement can be a bit tricky due to lack of space, but other than that it gets the highest praises. Will keep visiting this place :D

No airconditioner. No posh decor. No prominent location. No extravaganza. But this place provides you with every avenues of food your chinese flavoured stomach will crave for. Located near Rabindra sadan metro station this place is quite hard to figure out at one go but once you get to know it, it is pretty easy to loacate. Ask in local people to help you out. Must try are the momos. One of the best momos in town. Schezwan pan fried and chicken steam must be on your bucket list along with chilli pork fry.
Go savour your taste buds!

Kudos to zomato for enabling probasi bengali's like us to shortlist these fabulous places in a short span of holiday.

A rating of 5 befits this place, considering its quite a value for money, and food is quite awesome, quantity was also great. We tried manchurian chicken fried rice, and mongolian chicken fried rice along with gravy chilli chicken.

The food was delicious with special mention of the flavor. The lane is difficult to find, but keep looking for semi-dark, less illuminated lanes on your left as you walk from Rabindra Sarobar. Look no further than Shambhu Nath Pandit Hospital. It is just on the opposite of the hospital, this is a landmark. ¬†It closes @ 9:30 sharp.

This place is impossible to find alone. Must be accompanied by someone who has atleast been to this place twice. One of the oldest aisan eatery of kolkata, located in one of the dingiest bylane of elgin road. Small place with minimum decor but the food is yum on a shoestring budget. This gem of a place will remind you of times forlorn.

They say, don't judge any book by its cover, but covering for will be the only option to drop by this 66/1 Chowringhee Road. As this book has good few stories to share.  
While tracking it down could cause a little contribution for your appetite, but would you definitely find not such comfort as its name suggests. And then they might have hung up a notice board invisible, saying 'Beware of Culinary Art'. 
Holy pork!!! O'sh#%!! 
And as every sinner must be punished what could be more sinful than distrust. Me too had to pay its cost, a cost of watering my mouth too heavily..

This is a hidden gem in true sense.I dropped by this place with some friends after shopping.It took us hell lot of time to find it.It's located in a narrow dingy lane.But it's worth the visit just for the sake of really good food at a pocket friendly rate.

We ordered a chicken sweet corn soup and panfried pork momos.

‚ñ∂‚ñ∂Chicken sweet corn soup-Every mouthful was a complete delight.Soup was thick,had the right balance of sweetness in it with ample amount of chicken and sweet corn.It was an ideal hearty bowl of warm soup on a rainy evening.

‚ñ∂‚ñ∂Panfried chicken momo-This was the only disappointing dish from this place.Coating was too thick,momos weren't at all crispy as expected it panfried momo and I didn't like the sauce too it was tossed in.

Mains we ordered were mixed garlic gravy noodles,mixed mongolian fried rice and roasted chilli pork.All were top notch.

‚ñ∂‚ñ∂Mongolian fried rice-We wanted to have 1 spicy staple but not as schezuan.We took this on suggestion of our server saying that this will be mildly spicy and tangy.It lived upto the description.We liked it a lot..It was a good dish

‚ñ∂‚ñ∂Mixed garlic gravy noodles-I loved this more than the rice dish..so much that i would've licked the plate if i was at home! :P
The gravy tasted so good with loads of veggies,meat and prawns.Flavour of garlic was infused in a beautiful subtle manner so that it doesn't overpower the delicate flavour..but the presence of garlic was very pronounced.Completely loved it.

‚ñ∂‚ñ∂Chilli pork(dry)-This was a winner dish.Pork was finely sliced and not at all rubbery/chewy.It was very tender but was spiced with a good kick in it.The stir fried veggies in it were good too.I love to have pork which is very spicy and Tibetan Delight exactly gave me that.

I'm surely going to drop by at this place many more times in future when I'll want to have a sumptuous pork meal without burning a hole in my pocket.

The food the price can anything get better than this !!! Best place to have fried pork and wholesome momos both chicken and pork .. 
Travelling through the narrow lane that leads to the small cosy restaurant holds a different charm in itself üòÜüòÜüòÜ

The Restaurant is inside a typical serpentine Kolkata lane.The entrance is a major turn off. It is a low budget restaurant with no sprawling space. The service is fast & they offer quality food. The dishes are lip smacking. One must try out the typical Tibetan delicacies.

Nth Visit:
I have a robust reason regarding decreasing my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars. All my previous visits to Tibetan Delight never led to sheer disappointment unlike this one. I chose to takeaway Chicken Steam Momo and Egg Thukpa. The moment I reached home and opened the packets, I found the momos were all fragmented into pieces. Is that possible? I tried gulping down a piece and found it to be outright stale & tasteless. Although the Egg Thukpa was delicious but I found a strand of hair in it. (-_- ) Terrible! I discarded it immediately. Adding to my plight, I have a upset stomach since the last night. I never expected their quality to go down the gutter. Clearly going to rethink about the further visits.

The place is shabby with almost no light and in a cornered area where its difficult to find for those who are new.. but the food they served was pretty good at a very reasonable price... if you are looking for a fancy diner then this is not the place for you... but if you are looking for tasty food and low cost then this is the place for you.. an ideal place for students!!

Inspiration to visit?
I have heard about this place a lot. One of my friends is a big fan of this place as it's cheap. I used to think they are really great as I heard a lot. I have visited all other restaurants around it but since it's location is weird I could never find it out! At last i became determined and decided to visit here anyway.
Location?
U will never be able to find it out if u r not accompanied by someone who knows. Honestly speaking being a girl I literally got scared while walking through that damp dark extremely narrow lane where only one can walk at a time.
Ambience?
They really tried. Some lights and 4tables are there but the place looks really shabby and unhygienic nomatter how they tried.
Food?
I have heard 'DRY CHILLY PORK' is their special dish! So is pork and chicken MOMO and their special Thupka! Ordered then all together with a plate of mixed chow mein. The only thing we could eat was the noodles!
Thupka? The soup tasted pathetic! The noodle strands had just no flavours! Not much veggies were there and the little amount present was not properly boiled.
Momo? Yes the size was big! But does size really matter that much?! I tasted better momos from the hawkers! Momos tasted so dull! Not much chicken or pork filling was there! Only onions n onions! The covering had no such taste. Too much dull.
The most important one! Their special Dry chili pork??
The most disgusting, pathetic and worst pork dish I have ever had! The meat was inedible! So damn hard! Chewing a rubber could have been much easier! No flavours, not at all juicy! No sign of any pork fat! Nothing absolutely!! We complained, they said they will change the dish! Change? They brought back the same pieces of rubbery meat after heating them! We were completely shocked! They complained again! It was inedible!!! We asked them to change the dish! Those pathetic pieces of inedible meat!! They just didn't want to do that! Though they admitted that their meat was faulty yet they didn't! They told us that their was an issue with their meat shop so the pork was not good for that day! If they could accept that then why couldn't they just change it??
Finally after a lot of disgust we came out throwing away all those nasty food right there! They dismissed the pork dish at last. We paid fr the rest.
Pathetic service! Disgusting experience!
And ladies never try to visit their washroom no matter how bad u need to go! They told me that they have one but it was horrible. No lights, no water, no lock.

Visit this place once and you will know why it's called so.
This is a joint near rabindrasadan metro,situated in a narrow gali. Very shabby , no ac and with plastic chairs. But you will forget everything once you eat there...went there today with a friend. We ordered mixed fried rice,chicken chowmein and roasted chilly pork with gravy..they were tasty but quantity wise for 1person only.
The roasted chilly pork was totally outstanding and mouth watering. Will visit again sometime :) -with Chirantan Dutta

Tibetan delight is not just an eatery, it's sheer nostalgia. If you haven't eaten Chinese and Tibetan food in one of these dingy, oldish restaurants, you must have been missing something. Being situated in a narrow, dark lane and being clumsy and wretched in decor, it may appear unappealing to certain eaters however that exactly is the charm of this place. And mind you, this place is NOT unhygienic. Go only if you don't have tantrums regarding apparent cleanliness and decor.

Pork is the signature attraction, though fish, chicken and prawn dishes are equally good. For me smoked or roasted chilli pork is a must. Then comes the other items like the momos, or noodles, or chopusey. The noodles are indeed worth a try.

If you are comfortable with eating in shady places this place is worth a try. You won't be disappointed.

It is literally a hidden treasure! Hidden in the gully off Chowringhee Road, Tibetan Delight used to be the go to restaurant for my group of pals and I. And today I set foot in it after what seems like eternity.... the decor is largely the same... and the food equally delicious the portions slightly reduced.... though that was an illusion! The roast chilli pork tasted like memories and nostalgia rolled into one... the pan fried steamed chicken momos, the Tibetan Delight special thukpa were like heaven in bowls.... though it was too large for me to finish!!! The dry chilli chicken was the only thing that was a turn off... dry and too much soya sauce!!!! Tibetan Delight is somewhere where we return time and again.... to relive the days gone by....

Love and adore this place! Tucked away in an alley this place is a foodie's delight. the thukpa, pot roasted pork, thukpa, pan fried chicken momo and the mixed rice is deliiiicious. The place is not air conditioned and is a little cramped but again hardly matters as the food makes it up for all these. The chinese lanterns are mysterious and lend a quaint charm.

This place is truly worth remarkable as hidden gem. We have to find it using maps and after 15 minutes of searching we finally reached the spot. Hidden in a narrow lane beside¬† Lakhi Babu Gold Shop in chowringhee road, the restaurant surprises you with it's location and ambiance. Just a small room having only 4 tables with maximum capacity of 16 peoples to eat at the same time. The dim light and shabby dark atmosphere gives a different feel. We have ordered Chilli garlic chicken noodles along with Roasted chilli pork in Thai sauce. The noodle tasted good. The pork item was not so good as expected. The slices of the pork were hard enough to chew. But the taste of the gravy was good. The prices were very much pocket friendly with no extra tax at all.

It is located in such a clumpsy place that you cant even locate it easily.But food is flavourful there.Althought its name Tibetan delight but it also serves american,thai and schezuan style food and no so called authentic tibetan food is served.Seating area is not upto the mark and look dim and unhygienic,but nevertheless the food there has intense asian flavour. Pork soup, mongolian chicken fried rice, lemon fish, chilli garlic chicken have been tried by me.They were nicely cooked with flavours but no such presentation is paid attention. Overall its pocket friendly and good food joint for college goers but not the one to die for.

Tibetan Delight for me is more than a restaurant. It is nostalgia. I started going to this place when a plate of steamed pork momos was just rupees 16. This place used to be our savior when we were hungry after a movie or adda at Nandan and couldn't afford expensive places. Prices have shot up, but it is still pocket friendly.

A place cannot run for so long just for being pocket friendly. The food here is good too. Yes, they are a bit inconsistent, but most of the time you will be satisfied with the food here. 

It is located in a narrow lane behind the other Tibetan restaurants of the locality, so a bit tough to locate for first timers. The single dining room might look shabby, but the dimly lit room has a mysterious ambiance of its own. 

The thukpa here is decent and filling. Momos are good. Pan fried momos, with the spicy sauce, are good options during winters. Most of the Chinese items are good. We prefer the Pork items here.

Service is really fast. During evenings, most of the times, you will have to wait to get a table. But as they are real fast they manage it well. 

In all a decent place to visit if you are around and craving some pocket friendly but good Tibetan and Chinese.

Located in the dingy lanes of Chowringee, finding Tibetian Delight is nothing less than going for a treasure hunt. And, the result can be equally rejoiced. The moment you enter the place, you are welcomed with a quiet atmosphere of red lighting aand occasionall sounds of utensils banging in the background. Coming to the food, their momos are simply exceptional. Nice and soft on the outside and has a good filling inside. Though i found the soup somewhat salty, it could be managed. The thuk pa was also nice. Overall it was a good experience

This place is located inside a lane. Its a hidden restaurant. Its located on the opposite side of the Cafe 88+ inside a house lane i would say. They offer quality Chinese food. Specifically pork and schezwan rice. The soups and the pan fried momos are delicious as well. The restaurant is quite small and ambiance is not good. If you don't mind the decor and ambiance then this place tops the list.

This place is the true hidden gem of Kolkata. With that name they totally delights you with the Tibetan food which you are bound to fall in love with.

**Location**
A bit difficult to track this place as its located in narrow lane of Bhawanipur.  It is just adjacent to Laxmi Babu Sona chandi shop.

**Ambiance**
DO NOT GO BY THE LOOKS...
I agree that the place is a bit shabby and little dark too. But that's not their USP at all.

**Experience**
I have been to this place quite a no of times from my college days. As I m a big fan of momos and thupkas this place was absolutely a favorite from old days only.

If you are a pork lover do try out the pork momo options as well. Soups are also a very good option and loved each of the preparation tasted till date.
Must Try:
MOMOS ( Fried / Pan Fried/ Steamed)
THUPKA
LEMON GRAP SOUPS

Service is super quick and they don't waste your time neither their own. 

Recommended strongly ;)

Well, to start with it is very difficult to track down this place. It's basically within a very narrow lane, with outdoor seating as well as indoor facilities.
This place is one of the finest authentic Chinese eateries I know within very cheap rates, I keep coming back to this place from my college days! üòÄ
They've these beautiful red dragon lanterns giving a very soft cozy vibe, lovely deco! üòÑ Though Non-AC but I still go fine with that.
Now the main key factor to this restaurant is their FOOD.
Absolutely the BEST PLACE FOR MOMOS (in entire Kolkata)
Oh-so-perfectly delicious momos...specially the pan fried ones sauteed in such tangy gravy! Totally yummilicious! üòÖ
Another signature starter is their dry chilli pork.. Do try it if you're a pork lover.
Lung fung soup is also yummy.
Well if you want to try authentic thukpa this is the right place for you.
For main course portions are well as per the price!

****DO NOT JUDGE THIS PLACE BY IT'S APPEARANCE! THIS PLACE IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT! üòÉ

TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!

With the place almost so hidden that it goes unnoticed, it is a real miss if you are one of the many who fail to find it out.

I discovered this place on a friend's suggestion, who almost has one of the best taste for Momos, if I could say.
I dont really have a liking for pan fried momos, but hey? Try the Schezwan Pan Fried Momos.
Pocket pinch? Nah, not much. 
Absolutely worth each penny.

P.S: Need to keep the place a little more tidy.

But i think it should be bit less sweet....
Ordered schezwan noodles, chicken in barbeque sauce and chicken lolipop pan fried..

The noodles and chicken was good....but lolipop was way too sweet...

Aart from that, its having very small sitting arrangement which generally makes people keep waiting often...

I don't know which dish to suggest because they prepare it good, but it totally depends on your taste...

On my to go list for a really long time. Finally got a chance to pay visit to this not-so-appealing place with yummy momos.Its a little tricky to find this place. Tucked in a small lane right opposite to the footpath of chai break, Rabindra Sadan metro station.A very small shady place. with seating capacity of 4-5 tables each having 4 chairs around it. It was still very crowded.we ordered Pan fried veg momo and pan friend chicken momo. Contrary to what Ive heard, the sauce was undoubtedly very delicious but I was not very satisfied with the amount of filling in the momos.Happy eating. :)

Crossing lanes & bye-lanes & even narrower lanes, lies the address of Momo heaven.¬†Remember myself, following a few friends through dingy lanes, just to fill my stomach. And I had way more than that. Varieties of Momo, Kothe Kothey, Thukpa & Noodles later, I finally understood the magic of Tibetan delight.¬†
Not a place for snobs; but eating at this age-old eatery definitely gives you some bragging rights. Come here for good food, for the love of food & nothing else.

If you're likely to be a person on a short leash (read: less pocket money), this place is absolutely perfect for you and your friends.

Watch out for any pork dish (duh) and also the Manchow soup. 

On a lesser note: avoid during the summer months, they don't have an AC in place....yet.

Visited 2days back with my childhood bestie... We ordered and absolutely loved their "Pork Pan Fried Momo..." The garlicky sauce is to Die for. Previously a few days back I had their Chicken Momo Pan Fried in Schezuan Sauce which was also amazing... Though I personally believe they could try to improve the broth they serve along with :)
For the mains we had Chicken Chili Garlic Noodles and Roasted Chili Pork... In terms of flavour and taste, they were toooo good! Gastronomic heaven! They absolutely nail it...
Non-ac ambience in Indian summer heat is a problem but who cares when you get such good Food... The food compensates for all...

Pocket-pinch 370/-  :) :) 

CONS : I was really really disheartened by their Egg Chicken Thukpa that I had another day, in March. I have had better Thukpa everywhere... In terms of flavour and mingling of flavours and taste among the ingredients it was such a let down with lot of dull chewy veggies! :(

Hi all, it is value for money restaurant if you do not want to burn yourself and eat on road.
If you are looking for nice ambiance with AC,seat, light or quality dishes then I think you are in a wrong place. 
I have ordered for thuppa which was under cooked. 
Garlic chicken was not sweet rather it was blunt.
Chicken Chow was good, though it's a Tibetan restaurant but their Chinese items are good.

It's a very pocket friendly place. The food is great. I make sure I have the pork chowmein and the momos every time I come here. The place is a bit small but it's worth waiting for in the queue.

This food joint is difficult to locate, located inside a narrow gully in bhawanipur. They serve delicious momos.. one of the best momos i have ever had in kolkata! Their pork dishes are awsome too.. specially chilli pork(fried) and schezwan pork. The prices are pocket friendly.üòä

This is a place that makes me nostalgic...i have been visiting this outlet since my college days, when momos were not a local name..rather there were only a few outlets in this area selling this Tibetan delicacy..
Their momos are a must try especially the pork momos
They make the best thukpa in this part of the city..
If you are a pork lover do try there dry chilli pork..
The place is a bit difficult to locate as it is situated in a narrow bylane close to  Rabindra Sadan....near the road leading to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital..
The interior is very simple and its a non ac joint...its a small room that can house at the most 25 ppl but the food is out of the world

This is a good Tibetan joint in Kolkata, probably the only "nearly" authentic one, aside from Blue Poppy. Kolkata need a few like these, which serve good Tibetan pork (which is when I really miss Delhi).¬†

Location is tricky, as mentioned in the previous reviews. ¬†And I'm even worse when it comes to describing locations. So apologies for that.

Food was a 3.5 on 5 for me. We ordered:

Pork Steamed momos- Juicy with a respectable amount of stuffing. Served hot and the meat seemed fresh, what with the right smell.

Pork kothey- Pan fried momos, with stuffing that tasted very grounded and granulated and great!! Right amount of frying. Very appealing.

Pork fried rice- Honestly, didn't quite enjoy this much. I felt it was a bit more fried than usual as was evident from the grains.¬†

Pork with oyster sauce- Looked great, tasted even better, good portions of fresh meat and right portions of fat and flesh.¬†

Will definitely visit the place once again to try the other pork delicacies as I am a big fan of Tibetan pork dishes. Good place to eat.

Intro :  It would take a bit of the Sherlock Holmes in you to find this place - tucked in a small lane behind Orchid & Momo Plaza this place is really tough, but it's a treasure hunt !
No AC - a small room with around 16 to sit , deemly lit and quite hot in this weather .It took us a bottle of chilled mineral water to cool off !
This is a family run place ...

Food : Here we go - treasure hunt 

Chicken Thukpa : Amazing ! The noodles itself is special , the soup tasted fantastic, The mix of vegetables, chicken was just fantastic. Tasted real yummy 4/5
Egg Chicken Gravy Noodles - Again the noodles used is special , thinner than usual , might be rice noodles , would ask in my next visit , overall very nice, only the quantity could have been a little more generous 4/5

Garlic Fish - Must say, amazing the amount  of garlic used was just perfect giving a beautiful aroma and taste which made the gravy special , quality of fish was also good 4/5
Service - Very good , the guy was polite and service was overall quick 4/5

Overall - Other than that this place needs an AC badly , rest was amazing, such a small place serving such nice food is a big thumbs up 4/5

Tibetan Delight is delightful in terms of food but not in terms of ambience. Located inside the dingy lanes of Bhawanipur(nearby metro station-Rabindra Sarabor,Elgin Road Gate), this is a very small restaurant that is almost always full, courtesy their delicious food. So if you do not mind the shady ambience and the often long wait, this is the place to be for fulfilling your secret love for Pan Fried Momos tossed in Schezwan sauce, or for enjoying the Chicken Lollipop. Pork dishes offered here are cheap and yet maintains its standards. This is a pocket-friendly,must-visit for all those craving Tibetan!

Tibetan Delight is the kind of place you'd hear of from a friend, who heard it from this friend, who once visited the place and found it to be great.

And this is absolutely right!

Located in a little dingy alleyway between sullen buildings, the place is hard to spot for the uninitiated. Take that friend along, or ask the locals. Just a few minutes of exploration away from Exide Metro station, this little house is tucked away in semi darkness: the kind of place you'd expect seedy people to gather around tables and discuss all kinds of mischief.

Walk in. Make yourself at home. All the people there (oh, there always ARE people there) won't appear as seedy in the dim red lantern light. The food will always be warm, abundant, and delicious. The lady at the counter, or the cook behind the window are always hospitable, and are a fountain of stories.

The ambiance is warm, not just because it is enjoyable, but also because there is no AC. Gather around your table with three other friends, and relish your meal. The taste and affordability of the food will make you re-visit again and again.
 The simple decor will stay with you, and make the search for the place worth it.

It's the kind of place you'd tell a friend about, and expect them to tell another friend of theirs.

Locating this place amidst the crowded Elgin lane is really a hard job...but once located you can finally devour some really great food at great price...barring the ambiance quotient..
There is nothing called ambiance and the narrow lane leading to the food joint might cause different repercussions from different people...but to me the FOOD was important so I let it goo..
Friendly staff and ¬†quick service..this low lit simple eatery is definitely worth a visit overlooking the fact whether you have cash to spare or not!!

For the last three years or more this has been the place I've visited again and again and again because of the simple fact that they serve good food at extremely reasonable prices. I've tasted their noodles, fried rice, different chicken and pork preparations, momo, kothey and chicken lollipop and I have nothing to complain about! Very little place which remains crowded most of the time, but those momos are worth waiting for! This place is an old love of mine and I never say no about going to Tibetan Delight!

An essence of ancient China and Tibet is the main attraction of this place. I have had never been before , so today I got to visit this outlet of Tibetan Delight. Homely experience and small sitting arrangement make the ambience more cosy. Took the deep pan fried chicken momo and steamed chicken momo along with cheesy veg soup with Tibetan sauce in today's plater. Taste was quite good. A mouthwatering dessert was at the last. The price is quite cheap in regards of the quantity and quality of the food. But the only negativity is it's not well spacious. That should be taken care of. As a Pocket friendly nice Tibetan food joint, I'm rating this with 3.5 out of 5.

Tibetian delight is one of my fav place..  You can get the best food in the least price. Right from the dramatic ambience to the hot and spicy food everything is awesome. This place serves the best thukpa I have ever tasted. However recently the food quality is degrading.specially the pan fried momo which is the main attraction of the place is no more as tasty as before.the place is a bit difficult to locate. But once you find it. It's a must 10th time visit

Well, that's what is called a hidden gem in the heart of Kolkata- Yes, "Tibetan Delight" surely deserve this tagline. Located at a dingy narrow lane, parallel to Suburban Hospital Road, this restaurant apparently appears to be a bit shabby.  The interior space is pretty small and congested, with around 4 tables(with 4 chairs in each table). And you may have to wait for a table if the tables are already filled with guests. Oh, yeah!! Its a non AC place.
But the decor inside resembles an old school Tibetan charm, and once you take the first bite, the show begins with the delicious treat to pamper your taste buds. Genuinely authentic and mouth watering delights is the ultimate USP of this place, which is sure to make your day. Trust me, you'll forget all the cons I mentioned in the first paragraph, after having the food. Yes, the taste is more than enough to compensate all the cons, and ultimately you'll come back with a smiling face.
A must visit for all the foodies out there.

Note- The pork and prawn pieces in Thukpa will have a signature generic smell. That does not mean it is unfit for consumption. If you don't like the smell, you may avoid Thukpa and try out the other options.

The outlet is pretty small. The place is congested. But the food makes up for it. Brilliant food proper Chinese flavours. And the price is also very reasonable. Now coming to the food, their momos are really good.  The chicken hot and sour soup is good. They are known for their pork dishes mainly. And we weren't disappointed when we tried out the schezwan pork. In short, their food quality never disappoints. The food quantity is also really good. The reason I have given them 4.5 instead of 5 is because the ambience can be improved. It's a really small outlet. But their food is so delicious that I would love to visit it again and again.

The decor is vry simple and those red lights take u to back in old kolkata. If u love the old kolkata essence r then u will love the place.
Now coming to the food part.Fried Pork momo is to die for, order it with dry chilly pork. The spicy thin pork slices with lots of green chillis.. Slurpp.. i also had their chowmain but it was a little oily for me.

I always love to visit this place again and again for their good food and different type of ambience.

Have been here twice. Nice things first, cozy place with decent ambiance. Tried Egg Chicken Thukpa and Veg Choupsey on our first visit. It tasted as good as it looked. Very pocket friendly and quantity too is really good. Was really excited since then and very soon gave it a second visit. The second time was so disappointing. First, we had to wait for nearly 20mins to get a seat which we would not have minded had the food tasted the same. Momos tasted below average and the chicken thukpa tasted as boiled noodles floating in a soup of spices.
Maybe it was just a bad day but im really in dilemma whether to recommend it to my friends.

This small eatery is one of its kind!! Serves excellent Tibetan and Chinese delicacies...
It was difficult for us to locate...Inside a narrow lane..between two buildings..the lane was kind of smelly!! The ambiance wasn't good at all... Since the place is really small ..it gets quite suffocating because of all the heat.. Coming to their food..ordered Pan fried chicken momo, American chicken chopsuey, pork fried rice, Hong Kong chicken and chicken noodles !!! FOOD WAS DELICIOUS!!! Portion was good too !! Very much pocket friendly!! "Do not judge a book by it's cover" ..this proverb is apt for this eatery !!!. It might not have great ambiance or follow highest hygiene standards but the food they served us was mind blowing !!!..It was a happy meal day for us..
So rating it 3.5 just for their food :)

First of all, I would like to mention that this place is bit difficult to locate for the first time visitors  but, I was accompanied by a group of friends, that is why I was quite hassle free. If you focus to gorge on food only with friends, this place is a good option. 

We had chicken momo which was proper with soft and sufficient stuffing inside. Later we had egg hakka noodles and egg fried rice with chilli chicken dry and chicken manchurian. It was budget friendly food joint with authentic taste.

The quality of the food has not changed a bit..its simply impressive & delightful.Me and my husband had chicken steamed momo and chicken thupa..thupa is a must try at this place..infact you can try the pork dishes and the Fried Momo with Schezwan Sauce..!

I have been visiting this place for around 5yrs. Initially went there to hve some pan fried momos bt couldnt resist myself frm the roast chilli pork. The prices are affordable. Bt the ambience is not so good. PS: try to avoid dis place during the summer months. Must try: pan fried momo and roast chilli pork

Very ugly place . I would rate it 0/5 for cleanliness. Though the food was OK along with the service which was fast. The whole lane where this place lies smells awful and have nothing good about it. This place is quite hard to locate but is quite popular. Being such famous place , they should enhance the ambience and should maintain hygiene . I ordered for Thai chicken chopsuey and pan fried chicken momo. I would rather recommend "momo plaza" which is at 2 minute walking distance from this place . they offer better food along with better hygiene.

Honestly speaking.. When I first stepped on to this place it seemed a bit shabby from its appearance.. But the taste of the delicacies overshadowed the appearance of the restaurant. Pan fried momo is something which all should try!! Mongolian chicken friedrice is another dish which is at the top notch!! Overall it was a great time there.

Awesome place to have a quick bite on a budget and they have good tasty dishes too to its a win win when ever you visit here.

Food: I usually have a Sweet corn or Manchao soup here, then I have the pan fried pork momo with gravy( its finger licking good for the price of course). They have a delightful chicken lollipop and the side dishes like Ginger chicken, schezwan chicken, pork with oyster sauce, etc. The have a long list of food itesm you can choose from, but the fried rice and noodles might feel a little generic across the different dishes.

Service: Service is fine, can't really complain for this price now-a-days

Ambiance: Little shady ambiance, secluded from the crowd in a dimly lit corner down a narrow alley, might give " the creeps" :P

Verdict: Must visit for a budget meal, don't expect very classy food or service though. My rating mainly represents the value for money, more than anything.

Not really a place to take your girl out for a date but if she's the adjusting type and you both crave pork randomly and you're short on money you can go ahead and land up here. Food was not too bad the last time I checked (which has been a while now), try the pork chop suey

Yes indeed it is a hidden gem in Kolkata. Tucked in a corner of a lane near chai break it is really difficult to locate this place. But the food they serve is so damn tasty and surprisingly affordable. Of course you got to neglect the ambience part and concentrate only on the food. Only then will you be able to appreciate the delicacies. I will surely recommend this place.

Old school charm! Another hallmark of Kolkata's culinary diversity and depth!
And winters are the best to enjoy this cuisine..! After a Friday lunch at The Blue Poppy, I headed here with friends on Saturday evening - two of them had just an evening to spend in Kolkata! Hence, we got them here! Pork & Chicken momos, followed by Chicken Thukpa!!Really nice taste and service is really very quick! Nothing fancy about this place but an old charm surrounding it is intriguing!

After reading the rave reviews, i made it my mission to have a sumptuous lunch in the restaurant.  And tucked in a corner was Tibetian Delight. But it turned out to be a disappointment. Mostly because of my high expectations on this mediocre restaurant. Its ambiance is the biggest drawback and so its sense of hygiene.  Only the momos  were worth  the trouble.

Awesome is an understatement for this place. However, that is not what you think when you enter the poorly lit alley that leads to Tibetan Delight. That dark & narrow lane triggers doubt: You ask yourself do I really want to do this. And then, when you enter a small room with just four red plastic tables and a lot of red lamp shades, your expectations start tumbling further. That, my friends, is the time when the drama ends. Because that is when you start ordering. I won't write anything about the food, the ambience or the service. You, a true foodie, should go there and explore for yourself.

This small dingy place inside a small lane in Elgin Road squeezed within two building is actually a "delight" and haven. Though the place is small and and not so flashy, it has got its own ambiance and feel. The place serves really good momos and their chilly pork is one of the best in the city. Their special Thukpa comes loaded and is very hearty. The food makes you come over again and again.

Had the pork pan fried momo here, because I heard it was good. It is, but it's too soft. Makes the use of spoon and fork a little tricky; yes, they provide a spoon, instead of a knife. The smoked pork with red pepper was really good. Ambiance is nothing special. They have these big hanging balloons lit with red light. Adds a touch of romance to this very small place.

A small, hard to locate shop, located inside one of the very narrow sub-lanes of Elgin, this place gives the feel of a chinese eatery, provided the red Chinese-Tibetian lamps they have, as a part of their decor.
We ordered Chicken Pan Fried Momo, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Garlic Chicken.
The Pan Fried Momos were one of the very best,that I have ever had, it was super delicious. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn was also a treat to the taste buds. But,the noodles and garlic chicken were equally bland and unsatisfactory. Go there for their Momos (specially pan fried) and starters, main course is highly NOT recommended.

This is a cute little delighted place to have pleasant snack or dinner within anybody's pocket money. Loved their thukpa, mixed fried rice, pan fried momo with schezwan sauce. Only drawback was the Hong Kong style fish which was sweet to my taste. We went at 5 o'clock and all the 4 tables were occupied but it took 15 minutes to get a table. Don't go if you prefer classy environment and on the toe stewards.

If you are crispy chili baby corn addict then this is the ultimate place to be. They take extra care in making their baby corn crispy and every piece is separate unlike other cheap restros where the batter leaves a tinge of flour in your mouth.¬†
I would not recommend it as a place to dine but take outs are great. The pan fried momos come with a special chili garlic sauce and not the usual mix of tomato sauce and garlic.
Do not get turned off by its location and outlook. It dishes out great food.

Never was a fan of momo... But after eating the Pan Fried Momo in Schhewan Sauce... I visit this place regularly only to eat those.. But would like to mention one very important thing about the seating arrangement... Plss guys make it double seater so that couples like me do not need to wait much as the other seats remains vacant if a couple acquire it,  irrespective of the queue outside..

Well my secret love with Momo grew from this place..Have been visiting this joint for almost 18 years now, and for the foodies of a city where Momo is such a treasured anytime staple..this place has carved a unique spot of its own..Located in one of the dingy bylanes asjacent to Laxmi Babu Sona Chandi shop, for a first timer it may not be so impressive with its shabby ambiance and dimly lit small dungeon..but once you dig into a plate of Piping hot STEAMED MOMO alongwith a bowl of soup, surely nothing else would matter much..Apart from that do give a try to their in-house THUKPA..even PAN FRIED MOMO and KOTHEY are worth giving a shot..
Coming back to the Momo, it is as Tibetian as you can taste in Kolkata.. nice,generous portions, stuffed heavily with Chicken/Pork, a true foodies delight at such a cheap rate in today's world..Also do sample their Chilli Pork dry..
Overall I don't think there are many noted foodies who are yet to visit this place, but for everyone else do go and re-define your notion of Momos..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

Been visiting this place for the last 10 years. The location is a bit tricky as most of the times I miss the lane that's adjacent to the jewellery shop. The reason why i come here again & again is the top class momos they have been serving for years. 
The ambience has not changed,  it's still the mini hut with very low lighting. The pan fried chicken momos and mixed thumpa stand out. If you love momos u can't miss this one!

We recently visited this joint tucked away in a narrow lane during the Christmas season and being too particular about ambience, the bench on which we had to wait gave me no high hopes about the service. However, the waiter seemed quite efficient and prompt in assigning seats. The chicken lollipop was just out of the world with the meat dipped in a spicy tangy red sauce and just falling off the bone. Though the schezwan chowmein was a little too spicy for my taste, my better half seemed to enjoy it quite a lot. If food remnants drifting away in a lane turns you off, it's better not to visit this one. But then again foodies can cross every lane for lip smacking food :)

It was in my wish list since a long. Today I finally visited this place. The restaurant is located in a little tricky place. You have to go through a narrow lane and then we will see their hoarding. Being a famous place its always crowded. We had to wait for 15 minutes. But the taste was worth it. I had the best pan fried momo here. We also ordered noodles. It was very tasty as well. It was a good experience looking forward for our next visit.

I read a lot of positive reviews about this restaurant and finally got a chance to visit this place. Location was not a very problematic because it locates just opposite to pc chandra jewellery shop elgin road crossing but a little bit inner side of a narrow road. Opening hours is 11.30 so I went at 12 o'clock and they told that please come after 1 pm and when I came the total place was packed up so it was a little bit disappointing and finally entered the place after 30 minutes wait. Ambiance is typical chinese type but not great the whole place is very small and I think a small room is converted to a restaurant.There are only 4 tables and each table contains 4 chairs.Now about food I ordered 1 pork steamed momo, Singapore mixed hakka noodles and Ginger chicken. I heard a lot about their momo but the taste was not so impressive infact I didn't find anything special here. Noodles was horrible it was extremely sour and oily I think they don't know how to cook good noodles, the only positive dish was ginger chicken though there was little bit smoky flavour in it but the pieces of chicken was fresh and big. Finally I would say that if you try to experiment your taste then you can visit this place otherwise there are plenty of other restaurants in Kolkata which can easily fulfill you crave for chinese food.

Well this place had been on my wishlist for a long period of time due to its hype from foodies all around kolkata. So i decided to visit this place today with my friends for a delightful lunch.

Well the first thing was to find this hidden place which was tricky indeed. To locate this you have to take the narrow lane opposite of hdfc bank. Just keep going inside & you will see their board hanging there. The place is shabby. Upon reaching there we found a long queue waiting for their turn. So approximately we had to wait for 45mins until we were seated by the helper over there. After being seated we quickly ordered the following:-

1. Pan fried chicken lollipop- 8 pieces of chicken lollis served in spicy chilli & tomato sauce with sauted onion,lemongrass & capsicum. The taste was splendid & the lollis were succulent but the chilli factor was on the higher which gave a great taste to our buds. Recommended & do specify to the helper to make it milder if you cant bear the chilli factor.

2. Veg schezwan friedrice- This dish was very disappointing due to the fact that the rice was undercooked which made the dish bland.

3. Chilli garlic veg chow- This was very tasty & the spice factor was good in but my complain would be the high amount of oil being used to prepare the dish. Overall I was left dissatisfied.

4. Hot garlic chicken- Our original order was chicken in thai sauce but it was unavailable & so we went for this item. 9 pieces of succulent chicken were served in garlic sauce along with onions. The spice factor was ok.

The quantity of chow is well on the higher side as compared to the rice. Overall my experience was okayish. The pocket pinch was on the lower side since our bill came to rs.630 for 3 people. They could improve more!!

If you want to taste the most authentic momos, thupka, you must visit here. Its opposite to the Rabindra Sadan metro station (near Elgin Road) & situated in a narrow lane between two buildings. Pls visit here at least once.

Writing the review for one particular momo place reminded me of Tibetan Delight. And I felt a sharp pang of guilt for not having written a review for my most favourite momo place in the whole city. Yes the food is fantastic, but it's got a lot to do with nostalgia for me as well. I have had some of the best moments here with my partner and it's one of the places which we have made "our special little place", right since the time I was a poor little college student with not much money to spend.¬†

Tucked away in a dingy little gulley, it's pretty hard to find, but that's what adds to its charm as well. A tiny little place, there have been many times when we have had to patiently wait for one of the tables to clear. The decor is frugal, with red Chinese lanterns and around 4 tables to seat people. If you are visiting, have no pretentions of a fine dining experience. Value for money, delectable Tibetan food? Yes, that's something you will definitely find.
Coming to the food, it's one of the best place for momos without a shadow of a doubt. The steamed chicken momos are succulent and wonderfully fresh every time we had tried it. Never let us down. The pan fried chicken momos are heady and spicy and we usually order it with a plate of chicken fried rice. Generous portions and pairs wonderfully well. We love it! 2 plates of steam chicken momos, a side of pan fried momos and fried rice, washed down with Thums Up is our staple menu over here and we have never really ventured beyond it. Oh yes, the kotheys are brilliant too! The second best I have had, really.¬†I think we did try the garlic chicken and the stir fried noodles one one occasion, but the momos are the main reason we visit Tibetan Delight. That, and a whole lot of memories.

Tibetan Delight has a special place in my heart. I have so many food memories of this place that I always end up here, every time I am in Kolkata.¬†

Cooped in a narrow lane, this tiny little place has little to offer when it comes to ambience. However, what makes up for everything, is the food. Their momos are exceptional. These succulent, meaty masterpieces are worth every penny. I am particularly fond of the chilly pork here. The result of the most perfect combination of crispy and chilly, it leaves you craving for more.¬†

I have tried almost everything in the menu and have seldom been disappointed. This place is a must visit for all the foodies out there!

Its a difficult place to find to be honest, located in the back alley of Momo Plaza. From the outside it may not look very appealing but their food is amazing. If you are bored with the regular steamed, fried or pan fried momos then Kothey is a must try. Its basically steamed momos which are lightly toasted and they taste quite different. Fish Ball is another dish which is worth trying. Pricing is fair compared to the quantity. One big downside is that seats are limited, only 4 tables! You might need to wait for a while to get seats.

Have read and heard about this place a zillion times, but visited it the first time, as they say wonders come in a small package, likewise wonders are also found inside a few-inches-width lane, where you have to stop if one person is coming from the other side, let him or her pass, so that you can proceed, "ghupchi" is the bengali term for this place. As i enter this four table accommodating room, i see beautiful red lights dangling around and parallely my nostrils were full of aroma that hit my brain instantly and i started feeling hungry! it was my cousin sis's birthday treat and taking time off from clicks and hehe hahas, we finally settled down and ordered fried chicken momo, panfried chicken momos, mixed chowmein, hong kong chicken, shanghai chicken and thumbs up!¬†
the momos were just excellent esp the panfried one, the fried ones could have been a lil less oily, the chowmein was perfect, dint like the ¬†hong kong chicken much though...but the stealer was the shanghai chicken with its rich, full of nuts gravy, it own all of our hearts!
the bill amount was somewhere around 900 for 4, which is quite reasonable!
would go back again, and this time for their pork delicacies!

Locating this place reminded of those famous chase scenes of the underworld movies, running through tight lanes, turning at sharp angles, passing the staring windows, jumping over buckets of soap filled water; only the chase in this case leads to a queue of hungry souls waiting outside, to get a table :) The Yautchas and the Mainland china give you the inferior versions of these momos and you pay through your nose eating those dumplings made of cardboard compared to these puppies here. If you get a table here after 7pm, do visit your place of worship next day to thank your stars.

Inside lie just four red tables, all lit by deep red lanterns to make you feel as if you have entered the dragon's lair. The dragon himself sits at the end of the room staring at his world with his sharp squinting eyes. We ordered steamed pork momos and panfried pork momos in schezwan sauce. Both came with a bowl of warm broth. Now, how can one make a better momo than another? the key lies in the filling, the thinness of the dough wrap and the artful skill of those pretty little curly folds making each momo look like a piece of art. While the steamed pork was oozing with umami, the pan fried version like a naughty twin of the sombre brother, teased all our senses with its sweet and spicy rich coating.

After all that yummy pork, my mind craved for some more and I ordered smoked pork with red pepper. This is what I would describe as a perfect aftersex food, or even a mind starter if you are leading a dull boring life cuz it shakes ur senses from inside and you view your mind as an outsider questioning your entire belief system :)

Good foods do that, they are orgasmic and they stir your soul. Good food is like a guru that makes you get rid of all the pretensions and you eat, making your hands dirty, with your face smeared in all those yummy sauces :)

Hey fellas..!! Posting a review after a long gap..!! Actually visited a good place after a long time.üòÖ..!! Nice place (though it was a bit difficult to find).. But it carries that essence and aroma which gives you a classy , old n damped feeling .!! This place(only two outlets are there in Kolkata) is generally known for its Chinese cuisines n mesmerizing momos..! But we guys went there for hunting some pork for a heavy lunch..!! We had schezwan pork fried rice/ noodles(both), n for gravy we had Roasted chilly pork...!! N I must admit that it was damn tasty n chilly. I loved it..!! We 3 were full after having that n paid a bill of ‚Çπ495 (...which was satisfying enough considering pork prices n a full appetite). So visit this cool place this winter coz pork keeps u warm..( n don't get lost while searching this outlet). 
Thank you.
Eat good. Eat healthy.

3.5 for cleanliness, ¬†4 for service, 4 for food.If you crave for pork, pork and pork, this is the ultimate place for it. Pork momos are awesome. The location is really tibetan like..it gives you the chill of walking into a samurai den but then the food is really tooty-frooty. Must visit for people who love to experiment.

Tracing the location for this restaurant is a big challenge. It is a very narrow lane that leads to the restaurant.
Service is good but somehow the food is not enticing. The food lacked basic taste. What I mean is that if I m blindfolded and given to eat, I would not be able to say what I am eating. Not very keen to visit next time.

Located just beside the lane of Chain break  & Rabindra Sadan metro station. 
Shabby place but very well known for its MoMo.
We ordered Pan fried momo with schezwan sauce & fried momo. 
The sauce was extremely delicious. 
Then we ordered chicken gravy noodles & Manchurian chicken. Both quantity & quality just made me happy.
Price was extremely reasonable.

I finally ended up at this place after having heard so much about it being one of the best chinese and thai places in town. So naturally I went there with high expectations and sadly I was a little disappointed. We ordered thukpas, chopsueys, garlic pork, pork fried rice, and fish bowl. the thukpa was quite delicious. The food was good, at that price and the quantity they provide ( a plate suffices two stomachs ) , it was a good deal. But is not mind-blowing great as is often said about the place.
Yes, the place is located deep inside a shady, ill-lit lane; but I liked whatever they did with the place they got.

Having tried only their Pork and Chicken steamed momos for Rs 130, I'm rather disappointed. The momos are gigantic but the stuffing is non-existent. So it tastes like a ball of steamed flour.

The location on Google Maps is almost correct but you'll still have to ask around. Almost impossible to find this place otherwise. But not having tried their other food and having a "horrible" experience with their momos, I'll not visit again. Thank you!

Visited this outlet today in evening. Was very difficult to find its outlet. Tricky location, situated inside two building narrow lane. Heard a lot about its momo, as m big fan of momo. But I didn't find it at all good. It was crowded. It can be possible that I had tried vegetarian, and in many tables they were having non-veg. Small outlet. It gives the feeling of Tibet restaurant. Filling of the momo was not at all good. Went with huge expectations, but was disappointed.

Visited this place for a post-midnight¬†Saptami dinner and yes this was a saviour when we got nothing opened in the area. The appearance is extremely deceiving but the food definitely takes away all the awards. The best part is even at the dead of the night we had to wait for others to finish, so you can well imagine the demand :):)

We ordered just so much because we were 6 hungry souls tired after all the fun! The order went on as a haka noodles, pan fried chicken momo, two plates of mixed fried rice, a lemon chicken and a plate of schezuan chicken. We also bought a bottle of mineral water and together the bill came up to Rs 1020 only!!! (Yes I know that is like an OMG moment even during the Durga Pujas) :P :P

Service: Prompt

Quantity: superb

taste: good

ambience: not bad

Experience: super satisfied¬†

Conclusion: absolute value for money¬†

Cheers! :):)

The creepy looking lanes in the midst of which lies this excellent food joint - a perfect destination for those who love Chinese and Tibetan food. It's pocket-friendly and delicious. Right from momos to the very special roast chilli pork, this joint serves the best. However it is not spacious and houses only a few tables. You might have to wait during festive seasons to get yourself a table.

After reading all the reviews from Zomato and I finally decided to try this place. Finding this place is very much tricky. You have to go through a very lean lane beside Momo Plaza. There is no advertising on outside. Only four tables are there. Ambiance is not good and it is like street food corner. Anyway we first ordered chilli pepper chicken as a starter. They served within 12 minutes. After having it I think I made the right choice for coming here. So we ordered singapore mixed fried rice and Tibetan special chicken.
First off all Rice quantity is enough for two people but rice is sticky and pork is not cooked well and rice has cucumber on it. I cant figure out why someone cooked fried rice with cucumber. Taste is very bad. I regret for it and special chicken is not so special, it has fried cashews all over it, no salt, and no taste also. Worst lunch ever after "Naushijan" experience. .

After hearing recommendations from friends, we decided to pay a visit to this place on one hungry afternoon. One thing that was a turn off initially was the location. It's not quite possible to find this place on your own, but when you finally do, you might feel a little disappointed as it is nothing but a tiny little room at the end of a dingy alleyway. But once inside, the decor is quite nice with pretty red lampshades, and the food makes you forgive everything. We decided to order the Steamed Pork Momo and the Tibetan Delight Special Thukpa. The momos were quite good. The thukpa was served in a huge bowl, and was quite filling and healthy, complete with noodles, vegetables, soup, mushroom, chicken, prawns and a poached egg on top. This is a very good place for the times when you are craving to eat out, yet you feel you should watch your weight. :P I would definitely visit again.

I went to this place only recently. It is located next to the Mediclue and opposite to the P C Chandra store at Elgin. The place can be reached by following a winding course inside a very old building. It will be a daunting task to iron it out for people who don't know much about this place. So it's better to keep asking the locales and follow the Google maps on your phones verbatim.

The place presents a motley of Tibetan dishes. So you are welcome to expect more than just Momos. The soups and soup noodles are a wow. The dishes are really prepared with a lot of heart and they will make your tummy feel satiated. Also being really inexpensive a restaurant, your pocket will not take umbrage of this indulgence. But yes if you're more inclined to spicy meals at least for that day then switch over to some other restaurants.

The place is also really dinky. And also owing to its popularity, their is always an ever prolonging queue in front of the restaurant. So if you can then wait for your turn.

One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb, is the surroundings of this eatery. It appeared untidy and not very clean and definitely not really well-maintained. And since I went during the rainy season, the sight was little too much for me to come to terms to. The silver lining for was the food that was definitely tasty.

Hidden away in a narrow alleyway near Rabindra Sadan metro station, which will make you feel like you are in a scene straight out of a Feluda novel, Tibetan delight is one of the finest Chinese eateries in the city. Don't not get deceived by the look of the place. It might seem old and shady, but trust me, once you taste the food you will want to keep coming back for more.

Recommendations: anything on the menu :)

To be very clear--¬†
For Food; A big thumbs Up and 5 out of 5¬†
For hygiene, location and overall atmosphere- Thumbs Down, only 1 Out of 5¬†

Tibetan Delight, the most talked about eatery for serving mouth watering Momos and other Chinese & Tibetan delicacies, really live up to its expectation when it comes to their food. I tried their Thupkas, Chicken Kothey and Chilly Peeper Chicken. All the dishes are tasty and indulge your taste bud to urge for more. The quantity is decent enough. Price is reasonable, as the place is without A.C & providing manual bills.¬†

Its located in a dingy lane of Elgin Road and most importantly, the immediate entrance and waiting area is inhospitable, untidy with open drains. One cant avoid to close his eyes to this "Spectacle", as one need to compulsorily wait outside, as the joint can hardly accommodate 10 people at a time. ¬†Its a painful experience to witness such a pathetic ambiance in such a celebrated food joint. Though the inner part of this small eatery is marginally better and the services is quiet prompt and timely.¬†
Through this forum I would like to personally request the TD Authorities to take care of the basic hygiene & ambiance of this place. ¬†
Thank You.

This is the second time I've visited this place for food. 1st time I was amazed by the quality with the charge ratio and again it felt great to be back for Chinese and Tibetan food. The hot and sour chicken soup was mouth watering though I found the quality has dropped from the last visit but still if you want stomach full of good food in reasonable price then go for it. 

P.S. Finding the place is bit hard, if you haven't visited thrice or more it'll a challenge to pic the right shabby lane.

If trying out dingy places which serve awesome food is your thing, then Tibetan Delights will make you come back every week. When I started out as a food blogger in 2011, a lot of people recommended the place to me for its momos. Since then, I have been a regular visitor. The entrance may be a revolting sight, but those daring to continue would be rewarded richly! The food is quite inexpensive given the quantity. And served SUPER quick! Don't forget to try their Pork Kothey, Pork Pan Fried Momo, Deep Fried Chicken Lollipop and Pork in Barbecue Sauce. (If you don't want to try pork, you can always opt for the chicken versions of these dishes). (Not giving a four star mainly for the entrance and waiting area of the place)

The restaurant is small and dimly lit with only 4 tables inside and 1 outside. We ordered chicken and pork steamed momo, chicken fried rice, chicken noodles and chicken thukpa. Quantity was good. Quality was average. Momo was served cold and there were no fried momos. What a bummer. Service was quick though.

A shabby lane leads you to the restaurant, the ambiance is not great at all only the hanging lanterns creates a beautiful illusion.
Talking about the food, it is standard especially the pork preparations are nice and prices are affordable in range. The pork momo which was relishing on my very first visit about 3 years ago has deteriorated though. Visit this place for tender pork in subtle prices.

First n foremost..
Unless u r CIA n there is bin laden hiding here u r unlikely to find this place.... 
Or mayb a friend knows this almost secret eatery and leads you there. 

Coming to the food, just about okayish nothing special.
Regular Tibetan/Oriental fare which is available around your place too.
Noodles and Rice preps are slightly better than the other dishes. 
Got there wid some expectation but the momos disappointed me.

Went there today with a friend for the first time and now I knw whre it is actually located. Its inside a narrow lane beside Chai Break in Elgin road to be precise. The place is cramped with 3 to 4 tables inside and a bench outside. It might look unclean at first sight, but the food they serve is really good. Ordered a mixed gravy chowmin as we were hungry as well as in a hurry. Quantitywise its decent. Tastewise found it mediocre. I wish I had ordered Momos instead today which is usually the popular stuff there. Next time its going to be Momos n Chilly roast Pork, for sure. 

Review no. 2: Visited again today and as per my plan tried their Chilly Pork Dry and Pan-fried Chicken Momos in Schezwan sauce. Pork was little oily but very tasty, little chewy but not rubbery. It had little amount of fat and tasted divine. Momos were decent. I personally prefer spicy, so ordered Schezwan sauce, but it wasn't as spicy as i expected it to be. However, it was nice.

A small  joint amongst the ghetto of the other Tibetan food outlets @ the bylanes of Elgin road . The approach to the joint can be bit erie after sunset as the meandering pathway is dimly lit . The place is shabby damp cramped and woo it's a pressure cooker with hardly any ventilation . It seems a mid size kitchen has been doubled up as the gorging and gulping area !!!!
I wanted to try out the food at this interesting place but it was really ordinary and I don't find any reason to compromise on the luxuries of fine dining for the food served by Tibetan delight .  An interesting stuff was the fried and chilli tossed pork which was cooked well and was stripped of the fat which made me less guilty while gorging on it . 
Apart from it I really do not have anything to write as you get tastier and delightful Tibetan food around !!!!

Located in an interior area of elgin, this place is a decent place to whet your momo or chinese craves any given day. We actually had a hard time finding out this place as it can't be seen from an open road. You need to actually ask the local people the way to get to that place. The food are decent but be sure to go early coz you won't get everything after 8. Anyway, the chicken drumsticks we had sucked a bit. The soups were decent. But the show-stealer was the chopsuey. They tasted perfect. The prices are decent but the place is too small and at times might feel a little dingy. But nevertheless worth a visit once.

Well, this is the only place left for me to eat roast chili pork ( with extra fat) after closing of blue poppy at salt lake.. I am aware of the fact that this is a gully restaurant and with a huge hyped one.. They are generally good with Thukpa's and other items... Basic cleanliness is not there but I always love to dig my fingers to eat pork in this place... It is not rated by overall experience but by heart which loves to be messy sometimes

Tucked in a little corner, this is difficult to find if not previously known. 
The decor is not grand and flashy, but the quaint light lamps hanging above the tables creates a magical atmosphere along with the smell of steamed momos wafting in. 
Being one of the oldest Tibetian food joint, obviously there can be no question arising about the authenticity of their food served. And at prices which don't actually burn a hole in your pocket. 

What they should improve upon is that they should increase the closet space. Sometimes one needs to wait for long to get hold of a table.

If you want authentic Tibetan good, Tibetan Delight is the place. Located much inside from Elgin Road, between shabby alley, you'll reach the destination. Perfect food joint for school and college goes specially low price range but its also a perfect food joint for people of each and every age group. Im going there for past 5 years, same environment, same interiors, same tables, same chairs and same people. if you go during peak hours, you have to wait outside for some time to get your seat. My favourite picks are pan fried momo, american chopsuey, pan fried drums of heaven, mixed noodles. When ever i go there to that area, i definitely visit TD to have a bite of their mouth watering delicacies.

I have been going to this place then n now from my college days and this place is just still the same. This place serves the best momo in town,hands down!! The location of this place is quite tricky...and its actually quite difficult to find the place for the first time as it is in one of the shabby dark lanes at elgin road. But with a little effort put right for the location, this culinary experience in this place is worth every bit of it. This place has nothing mentionworthy about exterior decor or sitting area with a maximum sitting of 20. But tibetian delight is all about great food. I have been here many times and tried out many things but my favourites are definitely the steamed momos, the pan fried ones, and their thukpa. The momos here are soft with a thin coat and ample amount of chicken inside. The thukpa and the other soups are quite tasty but  their signature dish would definitely be  the roast chilli pork dry. It is the most delicious dish that I have ever had and absolutely nothing comes even close to it. The pork is well cooked and the chilli and onions sauted  along with it  gives a delightful flavour to the taste buds. Its a must order dish from my side whenever i visit this place. The price of the food items is fair with the quality. Hence if you are a true foodie at heart and can cope up a little with the shabby environment this place is undoubtedly a food paradise.

This place serves great Tibetan and Chinese food. It a bit difficult to locate but once you found it, n had the food, you'll realize its worth the effort. A very comfy and clean place. And their service is fast. 
My friends n I had mixed Spanish soup, schezwan mixed rice, schezwan mixed noodles, chilli pork, chicken in oyster sauce and chicken in barbecue sauce. The food was delicious especially the soup. The schezwan items were hot n spicy but overall the food was great.
Planning for another visit soon.

At last i visited tibetian delight... I am so so excited to write this review as this place was in my bookmarked list for the longest time. Never had an oppurtunity or time to find this place but today atlast i did it.... Yesss i found tibetian delight.

Location -- right opposite rabindra sadan metro station and p.c chandra jewellers showroom,bhawanipur . In the lane right beside another jewellery showroom ( name i forgot.. Something nafar chandra das ) . Well this place is pretty difficult to locate for first timers and if one is not from south kolkata. Though i am from south kolkata i faced a little difficulty too. But thats okay. It was worth it. 

Ambience -- well a small place , a very small place. Some plastic chairs and dim lights. Very very simple decoration and has a traditional tibet touch with all those lights and that big fan. 

Food -- i ordered chicken steamed momo only as i had a little time and i had to rush home. I can just write one thing. The momo was just just just awesome. Nothing new to write about
 Everyone knows tibetian delight serves soo fantastic momos.   What else can i write. Ohh!! I love these momos. 

I would surely revisit and have more of them cz i was not satisfied today with what i had. I want more........

The place is located just opposite PC Chandra on Elgin Road. Though the ambiance is not really great ,and it's a non-ac place, the food here is just wonderful. The price is extremely pocket friendly. However, since the place is small one may have to wait a bit for food. All the rating for the awesome food.

I should call it a Hidden gem. The place you still get good food with affordable price and great taste. Difficult to locate
Its located in a small lane on the footpath on Elgin road. if you walking down from Elgin crossing towards Exide  on the right footpath just before the crossing of Momo Plaza on the right u get a small lane inside you will find the place
The Thupka  is something you must try here along with Momo they have maintained the old taste. It has a small sitting arrangement of 4-5 tables only
Good Luck keep up the taste

A place which is there since long and has been serving great momos. The place is a little hard to find and is small.Hence, you might have to wait for sometime if you go during the evening.

Other chinese dishes are also great with proper taste and quantity though I find the soups to be a bit on the watery side.

This place used to be a hide out for most of the couples during college days, and it continues to be still I guess, more so when you are hungry. Bit difficult to locate, but they would try to make up for it through the food they serve. I remember the days when the food here used to be dirt cheap, but not anymore. I am veg, so my encounter here is wid veg steam, fried and pan fried momos. I have loved the filling of the momos here, but the skin is not the thinnest you would find, which makes it a bit chewy. The momo sauce is not always the same, which is a huge hangup for people like me who love spicy sauce like that Blue Poppy. The quality here is not always same, so be prepared to be disappointed at times, while at other times you might not think twice before licking the plate. Chef is moody I guess. Haha!! Overall, if you are around here and not particularly in the mood to spend a lot, while looking to have wholesome tibetan experience, this is the place to be. Your tastebud and appetite would be genuinely satisfied.

Heard of this place a long time before I could manage to visit here. Quite a hard place to locate, must say. Small little place with four tables, red lights and weird decor- the ambiance is not what ¬†you'd take away from this place.¬†
We ordered a plate of hakka chicken chow, pan friend chicken momos and chicken kothay. The chow was really nice, the pan friend momos kind of sweet and saucy, the kothay a bit of disappointing (considering we had taken it on a recommendation).¬†
The service is fast, the prices reasonable, the food decent- but overall, this is a place you'd go to for a light snack in the evening or something similar. I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the place, but I wouldn't be the first to recommend it to you either. Will I go back? Yes, maybe. Just for the chow!

Tibetan delight momo is like a phrase and truly it is. Though the place is shabby and damped and hard to find but if all that is ignored then u will get a yummy platter. We ordered chicken steam momo. Momo was steamed well and was served with soup. Then we ordered # Thai chopswey with# chicken with Thai sauce .Thai chopswey was tasty and crispy with the correct amount of spice. Momo lovers should definitely give it a try.

Visited this place on 30th June 2015 with 1 of my vry old friend..

The following orders wer made:
~ Pan fried momo - tasted good with spice in it..
~ Veg garlic noodles - it tasted avg as the order made was garlic noodles but it didn't had any taste of garlic..
~ Veg manchurian - the size n quality have gone down from before n evn the taste was about avg..

Its a small family running it n its a good n pocket friendly place.. Hygiene can be Improved.. 

Visited again on 13th july 2015, jst to have my fav dish pan fried momo.. but this tym it was vry disappointing.. they served momo without any gravy & onion toppings over it.. there is a drastic downfall in der quality n quantity of serving foods.. the person serving even dosn't check before serving..

A small tibetan  eatery featured in " great momos" situated in elgin close to momo plaza  . The place offers mouthwatering momos which are their specialities along with other dishes like chowmin, fried rice , chicken and pork. Today four of us went there and once entered we are given a seat of four under a paper latern (which makes the place decorative) . We ordered two plates of steamed chicken momo accompanied with soups. Momos tasted great . Then we quickly ordered two plates of hakka chowmein and a plate of hot garlic chicken. Tibetan chowmein is different from chinese and i like their uniqueness. Boneless cubes of chicken with perfect combination of spices and sauces made the hot garlic chicken the hero of the afternoon. 
My friends are not a fan of pork so i had to stick with chicken. On my next visit i will go for their pork momos and chilly pork .

You need a friend to take you to this place. Else, you have to wait to have a friend like that! Jokes apart, the pain being taken in reaching will be surpassed by the gain in eating!!!A very small joint with very shabby d√©cor is what you find in the first place. But mark my word, first impression is not the last always. If you are a foodie who loves ‚Äòthat‚Äô Chinese smell and taste, this surely is the place to be.

Start with Steamed or Fried Pork Momo. Then taste a bowl of Prawn and Crabmeat soup or Pork crabmeat soup. The juicy tender crabmeat along with the fresh prawns will definitely set you on the mood. If you want something veggie, close your eyes and order a plate of Crispy Chilli Babycorn.  For main course pick any one from the noodles and rice. Now the signature item here   is the ‚ÄòDry Chilli Pork‚Äô. Just go for it and wait impatiently for the marvel to arrive. If you think that the flesh is of the best quality, then I must assure you that the preparation is even better. If you love prawn, you can   go for the ‚ÄòSweet n Sour Prawn‚Äô. 

This is one of the reasons I love this city-you get the richest (in taste of course!!) dishes available at the cheapest prices.

Tibetian Delight is a very small joint located in a congested lane near  Rabindrasadan metro station. Though a bit difficult to locate the place for first timers, we found it quickly since a friend took us there a year ago for a takeaway. I went there yesterday with my beau to have some good Chinese delicacies for lunch. We went around 2pm and found the joint quite empty with just 4 people having lunch. Since we heard a lot about this place being famous for momos I wanted to try chicken pan fried momo. But my beau insisted on chilly pepper chicken as the starter so I went for it. It tasted awesome. The chicken was saute with bell peppers, garlic and sauces and garnished with coriander leaves. It had a peppery taste, but not the burnt pepper one but the one that soothed your taste buds. Next we had veg Hakka noodles, veg fried rice and schezwan chicken. The rice tasted moderate but the chicken and noodles tasted quite good. Moreover the quantity of the food served was more than enough for us. And it was a 'Voila!' moment when the bill came. Rupees 430 only with no other service charges! A must-visit for everyone if you want a hearty meal without a pinch in your pocket.

Tibetan Delight is a small and  delicious little food joint. Not only is it authentic but the rates are pocket friendly and food is amazing. The place is a little shady and service is brilliant.
Recommended : The pork in barbeque sauce is mouth watering. A must have for every pork lover ( I'd give this dish a 10 on 10) . Momo fans may have the Momo of their choice done to a turn. The hakka noodles is a little dry but it tasted brilliant, with its more than generous portions. 
Thumbs up: love the lanterns that give it a cozy feeling and the place along with its food has its own authenticity.

There  is probably no other place in kolkata where you can have a full 3 course meal with your taste buds satisfied without a pinch in your pocket like this one. Although you have to be very good at the game of hide and seek to find the restaurant. It is a family-run restaurant with quality food. All the items are good especially the chilly pork.

Tucked away in a tiny tiny bylane in Elgin road, this place is truly a hidden gem worth discovering. Get past the dingy appearance and treat yourself to the best tibetan food available in the city, that too for extremely pocket friendly prices. The momos are heavenly and so is the roast pork. The thukpa here is a bowl full of pure happiness. So if you can find this place (good luck with that), the quality n quantity of the food will make it worth your search.

This place is an old favourite of mine and my hubby's. So on 24th we went here again for dinner. Had pan fried chicken momo, roast chilli pork dry, mongolian chicken fried rice, tibetan delight special chicken chowmein, chicken in thai sauce.
Pan Fried Chicken Momo - a little too sweet for my taste, but good nonetheless;
Roast Chilli Pork Dry - loved the taste, but a few pieces were a bit rubbery;
Mongolian Chicken Fried Rice - absolutely mouth-watering;
Tibetan Delight Special Chicken Chowmein - good taste, a little too oily - in short nothing really special about it;
Chicken in Thai Sauce - disaster with a little too much vinegar and lemon pickle pieces in it;

The place has become cleaner than before (earlier it used to stink a little), so that's a sure plus;

But the quantity and quality of food has gone down by a notch. So cannot rate it more than 3.5

For the last four years or more this has been the place I've been visited again and again because of the simple fact that they serve mouth watering Chinese foods at extremely reasonable prices. Very little place which remains crowded most of the time but those dishes are worth waiting for.

1. Are dying for some Chinese, Tibetan unconventional dishes
2. Don't give a damn about the location and ambiance
3. Don't mind walking down creepy lanes to reach your destination
4. Want to do something crazy suddenly
5. Take a creepy selfie somewhere and eat happily too

(B)
1. Decor: Don't bother. Just focus on the food.
2. Staffs: Just one guy. He serves the food on time. Be happy.
3. Food: Lovely.
4. Complimentary Drinks: Nya.6. Crowd: Decent
7. Value for money: Depends on your definition of value.8. Referable: Yes
9. Alcohol: No

This is one of those place which you want to visit again and again. First of all, Tibetian delight is a little hard to find but then its worth to search for a place like this and make your stomach a little more hungry. Once you reach the place after passing few super narrow shabby lanes you will find a small place with 4 tables with a board tibetian delight hanging in the door. 
Coming to the food, I have tasted pan fried chicken and pork momo. Chicken and pork kothay. I habe never tasted pan fried momo better than Tibetian Delight. The quantity is decent,quality is superb. Service is fast and price is pocket friendly ,the menu card prices includes taxes. I would love to be here very soon.

My first review of a calcuttan restaurant after my grand return to the city where my soul has always dwell no matter where i've lived..
This is that Chinese restaurant which i've been visiting for the last 9 years to be precise and this is the same chinese restaurant which has made me learn to relish the indian version of chinese cuisine... so now it's needless to mention or even calculate how many times i've visited the place...
Went there after a few months wid my bff for lunch.. as usual there was a queue! Waited for around 20 mins to get a table.. Ordered a pan fried chicken momo, a chicken chili garlic noodles nd a chicken in hot garlic sauce..
It took them some time to serve...first came the momo which wasnt up to the mark, not even close to what i have had last December.. the soup was terribly bland.. no trace of seasonings at all.. the whole thing was really sad!
Then came the noodles nd the chicken prep.. the chicken chilli garlic noodles saddened me nd my frnd even more! All we could taste was chopped coriander leaves in it nd nothing else.. that was such an aweful feeling on our taste buds!
And Lastly to talk about our all time favourite hot garlic chicken, the chicken pieces were hard instead of being soft & succulent, and there were hell lot of garlic with no sign of red/green chilies anywhere in the dish! It was a sad bland garlic chicken, just like what i had cooked once for the same frnd when she was ill..
This was a very very sad day for the two of us who grew up eating in tibetan delight! There were times when we used to swear by the quality & quantity of all the Tibetan delight's dishes.. i remember introducing many freshers to this restaurant who equally loved it as i did once..
We seriously would like to know what went wrong that day...or has it dropped its standard completely?!
P.S. we both r having stomach aches since last night!

It's a bit difficult to find the restro. A five minutes walk from the metro station, in Elgin Road will land you to a shady place in a lane. Quite old it is with very limited sitting arrangements. Looking at the place you will never realise how good the food is.
You might have to wait for getting a table there, but it's worth waiting.
Food is delicious and lip smacking and you will definitely try to visit the place again.
The pan fried momo and dry chili chicken is worth mentioning.

It's difficult to locate, its too dark, dirty and many times I had to wait outside to get a seat, even once I had to sit with a couple once but nothing can beat my love for this place.. I love their momos!! Pan fried pork momos.. Those are the best!! The soup that comes with the momo is delicious.. During winter, one must try their thukpas, its amazing!! Their hotcake is chilli pork, which is also amazing.. Even their noodles, fried rice all of them are great :)

The place is a bit difficult to find. You need to take a very tiny lane on the left,just  after crossing the momo plaza lane near rabindra sandan metro station. The food is very tasty.. One of the best pan fried momos i ever had with a beautiful aroma. But the place is very small and usually crowded. But the wait is totally worth it.

If you live to eat, and can go any miles to have the best dishes then this place is for you.
Secretly hidden in a narrow ally on the opposite foot of the HDFC bank Bhwanipur branch the place is small with just four tables and does not provide the comfort of air condition. For some the place may consider the place shady and dirty. But all this complaints will surely vanish once you take a bite on their delicious dishes.

This place was in my wishlist for quite a long time. Even though finding the place was bit difficult but the taste of the food compensated the struggle.

Coming to the food, we ordered mixed fried rice, mixed thupka, and chilli chicken. The fried rice was awesome with tons of chicken and pork and prawns and egg. Chilli chicken had a very different taste from what I had earlier in other places, and it was different in a good sense it came with 8 pieces of succulent boneless chicken and chunks of bell papers and onions. Last but not the least the mighty mixed thukpa. A bowl full of happiness with noodles, meat, prawns cooked in chicken stock.
On the table you can grab the various sauces, chilli viniger, and dark soya sauce. Mix them to you dishes in right ratio and experience the magical flavour in your mouth. The quantity of food per dish is huge, can be share by two people easily. In fact me and my girlfriend had to pack the thukpa cos we were so full eating the mixed fried rice and chilli chicken.

It's worth a second visit. Only thing I would suggest to the owners is that they should put a sign board outside the ally and just clean the place a bit more. Lightning should be improved a bit. Looking forward to the next visit.

On the second visit,
We ordered pan fried chicken momo and chicken thukpa. The sauce of the pan fried momo was awesome and the momos were tasty too. However the stuffing could have been more. The chicken thukpa was outstanding. Previously I tried their mixed thukpa and this time chicken thukpa and I must say both tasted differently awesome.
A must visit place you are a Chinese food lover.

I have read very good reviews on zomato so decided to try it for myself.Yes,finding the place is very difficult and I had to go back n forth many times till i landed on the correct lane.The lane is very smelly,dingy and dirty,the place being even smaller.But the food was awesome.When I say pocket friendly,it indeed is pocket friendly.I had ordered their special gravy chow,chicken drumstick deep fried and chiken and mushroom gravy.The prices are cheap when I see the quantity.One plate is more than sufficient for two people.The tastes were good too.I was wondering why I was haunting momo plaza all this days when thid beauty was always there.This sure is going to be my new fav joint.Its a must try place for everyone.

"Pocket-friendly-finger-licking-good" food joint. Hard to locate if you are a first timer. Infact the alley leading to it is smelly and unimpressive. The place is very small and almost always full with visitors. You might have to wait. But trust me, if you have a strong will, you will never regret it! I have actually lost count of how many times I had been there (sometimes twice/thrice a week!!). My personal favourites are : lung fung soup, chicken thukpa ( I simply adore it), steam/pan-fried momo, hakka noodles and chicken drumstick (ah! The tangy red sauce). Long live Tibetan Delight. I hope they expand the joint and open more branches :)

I had visited this joint a long, long time ago, so much ago, that I even forgot the name.. All I remember, two of my friends led me down an alley, as shabby looking as it possibly could be, and into a place, which was more of a shack and hut, than a restaurant.. 
The interior is dimly lit, by lanterns and pretty grim inside..
I ordered Chicken Thukpa and Roasted chilli pork, as recommend by my friends who had been there before.. Another one took American Chopsuey..
The thukpa was brilliant, not too spicy, not too flat, just the perfect amount of spices and the noodles and soup in exactly right proportions.. Intact, truth be told, I have never enjoyed thukpa at any place, after Tibetan Delight.. 
But, then came the pork and it just blew me away.. This is a must try for anyone who visits the place, it is so good that you should visit here just for the pork.. On top of that, this place is damn cheap and gives good food for money.. I plan on visiting there again, and take a few clicks.. ;-)

Lets keep it short. Its small cosy place with little red lanterns hanging above each table making a good ambience. It certainly surprises more because of the slim untidy lane you venture through to finally find it out. Food: Pan Fried Momos were great. Had heard about its chilli pork but was dissapointed, they were rough and chewy. Thupkas were as bland as can be. But what i really found offensive was the rude behaviour of the waiter. I have went there a couple of times and there was only one man doing it all. From not offering a bill, to not getting a extra spoon and serving a known group who were ordering more and might even be tipping more right at your face at your expense. The first time I considered, but the second time was enough and certainly never went back. Not a good impression to leave with.

You might find it hard to find but the pain to locate it is worthwhile. Very pocket friendly and the pan fried momos are just too good. This is one of my favourite momo joints in the city.¬†

A trip to Kolkata would be incomplete without a visit to this place. The Thukpas and the Chopsueys are delectable. You could probably fight with your friends over the last bits of food on the table and the best thing is that it's very affordable.

Hard to locate at your first visit, this place is a pork paradise.. their Pork Momo's & Speciality Roasted Chili Pork is to die for.. chicken lovers will also get a range of options, but pork lovers will understand what I am talking about.
My recent visit last week had been a hit like every time, and my tastebuds were filled with joy. This is a highly recomandable place.
P.S. it is a little cozy place, with plastic tables & chairs and not so bright lighting, so don't expect any fancy thing there, except for the FOOD, that speak for itself.

Tucked away inside a dingy alley is this small restaurant delighting the foodies with its delicious momos, sumptuous pork pan fries, and warm comforting thupkas. Although a bit difficult to locate (right opposite Rabindra Sadan metro's gate no 4) and a bit small, the piping hot food served on a budget makes up for it.

Try their speciality, the spicy hot pan fried pork momos (fair warning: it's very hot). And if you have a more delicate palate try their steamed momos which comes with a mixed broth. Do try their thupkas which always reminds me of Darjeeling. For side dish try their Fried pork with BBQ sauce or Fried pork with oyster sauce, both of which are a steal at the price they serve.

If you're more into Chinese, they serve some spicy rice dishes here, my favourite being the fried rice. They also do a mean Garlic chicken and fairly good Manchurian chicken to go with that.

The food is served quick and never in all my years had it ever been less than perfect.
Don't miss this one.

Finding this restaurant is bit of a challenge if you dont know where it is, it is situated in a tiny narrow lane just under a building before elgin road on the left side if you are walking from Nandan. ¬†Once you have find it you will forget the hassle of finding it (however we found it adventours) .Once, Inside just got mesmerized by the Classic Atmosphere and lighting, We ordered Chicken Steamed and Pan Fried Momo , Followed by Chicken Soup and Thukpa and Thumbs Up.! It was soooo i mean amazing, too delicious, And the thukpa & pan fried momo was the best i have ever had in kolkata, (being from North Bengal, i get to taste theme always back home in jalpaiguri :P ) .

¬†Just Loved those !! and of course these superb quality food comes ast superbly cheap price compared to other kolkata momo shops. They also provide Pork Specialities and Chinese Items like fried Rice and else. ¬†also there service was very good,

However This restaurant has only four tables. so you have to wait for sometimesas most times as the place is immense popular among the mass ¬†Over all Great Experience

The food is also quite filling and definitely worth the money. Thus to sum up its a real good place to hangout. Though the major concern is locating this place, it's inside a small lane which makes it unnoticeable.

This review is purely based on my recent experiences . ¬†I have visited this place hundreds of times because of their mouth watering pork items . But I am never visiting again. The quality of food has degraded insanely. The roasted chilli pork had roasted capsicum and onion with unnoticeable amount of pork. Pork thupka had no trace of pork. Forgetting about hygiene and cleanliness, used be here only for the cheap food. Now its not that cheap either. Kind of breaks my heart to say goodbye to my once favorite destination.

One might find difficulties in locating this restaurant as it is situated deep inside one of the lanes in Bhawanipore area. But once you enter this restaurant, it will show you an atmosphere of a traditional Chinese Restaurant with Lamps hanging and so on.
Now coming to their food, I was really shocked to see that food is still available at such a low price. No doubt about their quantity and quality, this place is a must visit for all foodies and a perfect pocket friendly restaurant.
P.S. Their momos are to die for.

This is one of the best Pocket Friendly restaurants in Kolkata hands down. The food here is absolutely delicious. I'm personally a big fan of the pork they serve here very tasty each and everyone of them. Chicken items are also good. I personally like the noodles at this place more than the rice items. i can guarantee you, you won't be disappointed eating here. Few issues are of course present, it is impossible to have a meal here during summer no ac, although they serve the food really fast there no proper service as there are no waiters only one person at the counter and other taking orders and serving. Now I'm really nitpicking here. It is a must try Chinese place even if you don't like pork rest of the food is equally delicious.

Had an horrid time finding this place. but the time was worth wasting. as the food here is a total bliss. spicy level is at its peak. excellent value for money. quantity of food is also good. Service is super quick. the place looked cramped up. highly recommended for all. simply waste 20 or 30 more bucks in here rather investing in local street side eateries for momos and chowmeins.

If you can find it, you won't forget it. The best momos I've ever had. Their pan fried pork momos are sexy. Steamed chicken momos and any soup if its a winter afternoon. If you are planning on having dinner, this place won't let you down. Its wide array of rices and noodles are equally awesome. I'd recommend any pork side dish alongside.. Service is excellent. But if crowded, you'd have to wait outside for a bit due to space constraint.

Location: It resides in one of the alleys of Bhawanipore, near Momo Plaza, opposite of P.C Chandra Jewellers. This place serves one of the finest quality momos, and chinese dishes. We had Chicken pan fried momo, chicken chowmin and chilli chicken. But, this restaurant has only four tables, can lead to waiting for the customers. Atmosphere is not that cozy, but the mouth-watering taste of the dishes puts everything behind. A must visit for afternoon or evening snacks.

One of my favorite Tibetan eateries in whole of Kolkata, Tibetan Delight is a place that must be visited if one s a fan of Chinese cuisines. Nestled in one of the alleys of Bhawanipore, just outside one of the exists of Rabindra Sadan Metro station, one can easily miss this place if they are going for the first time. Its a cozy,dimly lit place which makes you feel at home, every time you go. The food is outstanding and if one is a Momo fan, one must try out their Pan-Fried Momos. Also, their special Pork Barbecue is something truly worth having. The place is generally always full during the rush hour so one might have to wait a bit before they get a table, but its worth every bit of it.

Delightful Tibetan fare

Thanks to my two friends for introducing me to this small Tibetan joint, hidden inside a narrow alley near SNPH.¬†On a hot summer day as this, it may not be the most comfortable of places. Then, there is the onslaught of spices coming in from the adjoining kitchen - one of my friends had a merry time sneezing away!
Talking of food,¬†I was very glad with the choice of our soup, the Thai soup, it was delicious. The star of the day was the chicken with barbecue sauce which will tickle your taste buds.¬†Service was very prompt. I have to revisit to try out their famous momo-s.¬†I would rate them 3/5, adding an extra half point for the wonderful company I had: 3.5/5 it is.

One of the smallest places I have ever eaten but on the contrary it's equally "large" in its flavour. A place where everyone should go at least once to experience, how amazing the food is here. Extremely affordable and extremely delicious are words which fall short to explain the aura of this place. Go and experience is my advice.

I bet you while walking by the footpath of Rabindra Sadan Metro u will miss the alley that directs you straight to Tibetan Delight! I visited the place in consecutive three Saraswati Puja in my college days! A bit difficult to locate for the 1st time, but those who are a regulator visitor of this place will remember the ambiance and taste of chinese served by it.. Price is affordable and quantity is also sober. Number of seats is very less approx 15-20,so if you can wait for a while to get your table U will definitely love the food and the service.

This place is a small joint located inside the most unhygienic narrow lane. There is no delight in this "Tibet" ! We went and asked for dry chilly pork , pork momo, and mixed thukpa. First, the pork was chewy and and stiff. When i complaind, they took the dish , cooked it again and send the same item! Wtf. !!
Asked the boy( who was serving) to taste it! Taste that disgraceful dish! And tell me i m wrong. ! (Having good reviews dosent mean you can serve any shit to someone. ! )
He refused. ! He said , that "the pork they bought was of poor qulity thats y its chewy and stiff"! Then y in the name of blue hell they were serving this shity pork.!! 
Maybe others customers dont care about the food they eat..but i do!
And then comes the momo! Neither the outside nor the inside , nathing was good with those momo s! Evrything was falling apart! 

Then it was thukpa! Wow! There are many ways to cheat in cooking! They found one too! They mixed red chili sauce with boling watr and added some veggies and unseasoned bad qulity same  pork , and prwan. 

they became too proud of soo many reviws,that they refuse to accept any criticism!

There are many small joints that provide qulity food in minmum price! But this restaurant is sick , unhygienic and shoud be closed.

And ladies, pls avoid the toilet , if u need to go then take a flashlight and someone with you. Kuddos!

It's  superb, 
This is my favorite restaurant in my city. The reason is very simple, the food is delicious, excellent food quality. Am truly delighted of their cooking skills that's  for sure. Believe one must go for this one my friends. I try to taste their food almost every week possible. Although they have very less accommodation as you have to wait outside but it's worthed. The service is good the young chap who does the service is very polite. Even if you go there with a group he will manage it for you any how. 
The 'Pan fried chicken lollipop' is my favorite dish here. Can't wait to try it again. Check my photos fellows 
Stay tuned... :)

After searching about 15 min finally decided to call to the restaurant and after their guidance we find the restaurant. This restaurants in side a narrow lane just opposite side of the HDFC Bank. So it is suggested not to struggle to find it for long time, just make call to the restaurant.

Now, after entering found the ambience is good and very much Tibetan. We have ordered fish item and fried rice. The test is good and like original chinese food. Amount of the items are more than enough for one people and bit less for two people. But prawn not available.

It is absolute value for money with good test and nice serving. Menu card is not available in the Zomato. We try to upload the menu card. But fail as system automatic crop the image as per they need.

My uncle first took me to this place when I was 14. I had the best Pork Momo (steamed) then. Till now, the taste hasn't changed but the quantity of meat in the momo has decreased. A new thing that I didn't get to have at other momo places is "Koth√©". It's half fried steamed momo.

This is one of my most favourite joints in the city.I was blown away by this small place tucked away in a gully in bhawanipur.The ambience appeals to me every time.The place is quite small,with just four tables seating 16 persons at a time.The reddish theme is quite romantic.Always be prepared to wait,before getting a table.

The service is quite fast,and the food is quite good.

Its hard not come across this name once you are in and around Elgin! Its one of the oldest momo plazaz situated here. A must try if you are a momo lover!!!

To start with this place serves the best authentic Chinese and Tibetian delights. My rating goes hands down for the pocket friendly yummy food of Tibetian Delight. You cannot really talk about the ambience or location of this place as it is located in one of the most narrow dingy lanes which may almost go unnoticed if you aren't with a local folk! The place is shabby and dark! The interior is very basic with tables and chairs and dim Chinese lanterns!

Coming back to food,what this place really makes you come back for more are their mouthwatering pan fried momos dipped in red spicy sauce ( bonus if you are fond of spicy food).The mixed thukpa and chilly pork and soups are also among my favorites. Of course almost all the chicken dishes are worth trying at such affordable prices. You can almost always find a que waiting outside. If you are up for something delicious to satisfy your hungry taste buds, then this is the place to be (only if you can look past other considerations )!!

This one of the best places to have hot steaming momos around bhawanipur area. During my PG days there, me and my pg mates used to frequent this place often.The eatery is located at the end of a narrow dark lane. The way up to it os not at all nice.The eatery has a very basic set up with few tables and chairs. But if your topmost priority is to ticke your taste buds, avoid all these considerations and go ahead and bite into those soft spongy momos.

Tibetian delight is very hard to locate, on one of the bylanes of bhowanipore in a dark alley. I have been a regular visitor to this restaurant right from my college days, the place lacks ambience, lacks professionalism, lacks every bit of a fancy restaurant but the food is worth dying for. One of the best chinese/tibetian restaurants in the city - yeah that true, it may give way to many criticisms and challenges - but hands down Tibetian Delights is spectacular.

Go for pork dishes - pan fried pork momo, chilli pork dry and schezwan pork - all tastes heavenly. Also mixed fried rice, chilli chicken and thukpa are marvellous. Go for manchurian chicken and chilli chicken dry too.

One word of caution - don't look for fanciness in this restaurant rather enjoy the food, you would not be disappointed.

Then for the main course we ordered Non-veg Schezhuwan rice, Non-veg munchurian rice, Garlic pork, Pork in barbeque sauce(dry).. All the foods cme within 10-15 mins and all the foods ws damn good..
As we love pork more so we ordered mostly pork dishes..
So if you are a pork lover then go ahead and try out..
For anyine who is goin for the first time might have a problem to locate the restaurant..

Coming back to some of the things you should order, make it a point to try out their deep fried version of pan fried momos, Mongolian Rice and of course the Roast Chilli pork.

When the taste of food and the mysterious discovery of the restuarant spurs up nostalgia, I must write a review! Going back to early college days when my friends and me discovered this "delight" with an empty stomach and little funds and from within a very narrow lane a few flickering lights invited our curiousity as we were drawn inside to find out what lay ahead.. Hot spicy pan fried momos with a chilled thumbs up, thukpa, dim lights and chopsuey!!! 
We took back with us memories, happy abdomen, lots of pictures and a new favourite to hang out..
Its one delight that can light up ur day! Go grab some urself...

A very congested place to be in. You will have to literally fight your way to a table. Lighting and ambiance is horrible. Prices are not that low as compared to the quality of the restaurant when you enter. But when I ordered food I forgot everything else and had to concentrate on the food itself. They were not too concerned about the structure of the restaurant but they were involved deeply in improving the food and believe me Tibet will be on your plate. Authentic Tibetan delight while the momo's are a standout and the I realized how perfectly the food are priced. Highly recommended to all those who's looking for a joint to spend some time with their dear ones and also enjoy great food while going easy on the pocket.

Tried their chicken pan fried momo, it was kjhdspjjnxcohd-ly AWESOME!! Can still feel the taste of those momos! But the soup they provided with the pan fried momo had a bit fishy smell!
Also tried their chicken fried rice and manchurian chicken. Both were tasty. The chicken was of good quality and was nicely cooked. But there is one thing that I didn't like. The sauce bowls ( in which they kept different types of sauce) were kept open, and all the flies were having a great party there!! Apart from that everything was great about this restaurant. Planning to try thukpa and hakka chow next time! :D

How could I have not been to Tibetan Delight earlier? Well nevertheless, sooner or later, for the sheer love of food, do drop by. Having heard oodles about this restaurant from innumerous people, I finally reached Tibetan Delight, positioned at the end of what I‚Äôd call a maze.

If you finally happen to find your way out right, you‚Äôll walk into a small restaurant enveloped in blue with dimly lit red and yellow lights. With accommodation for only a handful, and a table for 4, very informally placed on the outside, colossal patience or vast luck is required to get you a table here. This place is always crammed with people and chattering noises lingering around the restaurant. 

Determined, we waited for almost 40 minutes after which we finally got seated, hunger struck. The menu slopes more to the Chinese side, and everyone unanimously agreed that they served some of the most delectable pork in town. We ordered a portion of Mongolian rice followed by one of Roast Chilli Pork, as suggested by a friend. Firstly I need to mention, they are anything but frugal when it comes to their quantity they dole out. The Mongolian rice tasted liked ordinary fried rice, nonetheless pleasant. What absolutely blew my mind was that pork. It is beautifully roasted, cooked to aptness, not chewy and yet not buttery tender. It‚Äôs more about savoring the pork because it awakens all your possible taste buds.

Their momos is what they are known for. But after gorging on endless helpings of pork, I decided to leave some surprise for the next visit, because how can you not come back to a place like this. Surprisingly, so much so, without even burning a large hole in your pockets. Each dish is priced reasonably maximizing your satiety while keeping your wallets happy. However, I‚Äôd like to mention of course, this place might not be aesthetically pleasing, in fact is not one bit, it is clumsily located but I guarantee that if you‚Äôre able to get past that mind block, you are in for an exultant indulgence. Until next time‚Ä¶

Can‚Äôt wait to go back! :)

I really need time to talk about this place. I am in love with their food. The place is nothing attractive. Placed in a narrow lane, very much old Kolkata. A family runs this place. All kind of chinese and tibetian foods available. In kolkata you will find lot of places for Momos but when it comes to Tibetan Delight, please try kothay. Awesome!!! And the soup served with it is also wonderful. Another dish to try is Thukpa. Authentic chili chicken...well fried food. Not a place for vegetarians. Ice creams lovers you need to sacrifice for a day. It is worth it for the delicacies.

Not at all expensive. If you are a food lover then you must go. If you are a student and saving money to take your partner to a decent place then please try out thia place.

I have been to this place uncountable times and would love to.

Tibetan delight is one of the better Momo places around the Elgin/Bhowanipur area.¬†

Located inside a shabby lane, it is quite difficult to locate but its worth the effort.¬†

The ambiance is very basic yet tidy with 4-5 plastic table and chairs which can seat around 20 people at the max.

I have tasted their steamed momos and Thukpas and I would strongly recommend both. Another favourite is the schezwan momo which is prepared with hot, spicy and tangy gravy. Pricing is very affordable.¬†
Must visit if you are near Elgin and want a quick bite

Well on a chilly January afternoon one craves for something hot and steaming and when a friend suggested momos I was sure he is talking about my regular joint . I was slightly taken aback when we reached the location . Going through a thin maze like lane we were greeted by thing tapestry of artificial flowers and this blue door. The smell and the whiff just blew me away . We stepped into a small red light filled room with for tables .

We quickly got down to business and ordered momos and thukpa . The steamed momos were not refined but bursting with flavor . The broth of the thukpa was mind blowing and the noodles were thin and light 

The chicken with chili pepper was delicious too  . And in spite of the fact that we had a huge meal the bill was bare minimum . 

The service was quick and efficient . Simple good food ..... No frills attached ..

Loved it !

Awesome place for authentic Chinese. Don't go by the looks and set up but it's the best place for Chinese.  Price reasonable. Went  with my friends bt was not sure about the quality.  But I wasn't disappointed.  Momos were too good.

On initially arriving at the place, one may think twice on whether they are at the right place or not. But don't let the sober setting and the otherwise small size of the place fool you. 
One of the most beautiful experiences one can have in Kolkata. The food is, in short, genuinely made. The pork dishes are made to perfection and the meat is tender. 
An ideal place to visit for someone with a moderate budget and a large appetite.
Surely a must visit.

I got food packed from here! Was dificult to locate and when I reached there I found it a little unhygienic. I took steamed momos which was good. The pan fried chicken momos were okay...too saucy for my taste! They need to work on their hygiene to be at par with other momo places nearby!

This little (and I mean it literally when I say little) piece of heaven offers some of the best pork dishes and Chinese as well as Tibetan cuisine in Calcutta. A special shout out to their pan fried momos, thukpa and chilli fried pork. 
          It may take you a little while to find the place and you may even be hesitant to go into a shabby place such as this, but boy is the appearance deceiving. It's worth the wait too and absolutely pocket-friendly. Love this joint.:)

Tucked away in a hidden gaalli in the heart of South Kolkata, this unassuming place takes you to the north-east and also perhaps in time with its modest prices and old-school dimly lit ambience. Yet it does not compromise in the one thing that matters - taste. We went there on a busy New Year's Day and gorged on thukpas, gravy noodles and chicken lollypop in pan fried sauce. I have been to Nepal and Gangtok and I found the food right up there. It really made our evening and the wait worth it. The only con is finding the place. You really have to know where to look for! It is nothing fancy, but manages to put a smile on one's face! These are the kind of places where memories are made........Bon Apetit.

I have seen this restaurant long long ago in Zomato........ But i was never able to go here because of our tight schedule.. Finally the chance came yesterday... We were looking for a place to eat at the Rabindra Sadan area and suddenly this name came to my mind... But the tough part was yet to start, locating the place... GPS.. Local people and my better half found it out.. Phew! There were about fifeteen people waiting outside to get a chair.. It was Christmas, so the crowe. We waited outside on a bench and i started clicking pictures. Their staffs are very well behaved.. That impressed me a hell lot. Now whem we got the seats we were impreesed by the romantic ambience.....the red light... Prospect of good food.. And my girl in my arm.. I needed nothing else. We saw everybody ordering their chicken lollypop in pan fried sauce..and decided to order it. The food came within five minute. The dish was Awesome.. It was hot and spicy.. The chicken was juicy and tender.. They gave a good amount of chicken......which you will not get normally.We loved this place...looking to visit again....... Went tiday.. The chowmein and fried rice were BIITER... CHIIIII... NEVER VISITING AGAIN

Take a bit of dirty and shabby entrance and add it up with delicious food, you get Tibetian delight. Definitely, this is a place that lives upto its name. Delightful. If you start thinking from a broad aspect, this small, cramped up room would appear mysteriously romantic to you! I have eaten here before too but let's review about it.

I have a bad affinity towards pork and this is not something that would easily disappear. And Tibetian Delight is known to serve awesome pork. So, me and my partner S, decided to land up here and have some awesome pork. To start with the whole journey, I would have never figured out the place if it was not for S. I never figure it out! The cramped, antique lane invited us and as usual, it was crowded with people. Four tables are definitely not enough to quench the hunger of so many fans. We waited for more than half and hour before we got a table.

We both were hungry like mad and straight jumped onto the big menu. We ordered chicken fried rice, roast chili pork(semi-gravy) and chicken steamed momo. This place has an attached kitchen with all the food aromas and steam coming into the eating place and soon enough turns the place into a sneeze-fest. I was a prey to this fest too with endless sneeze and coughs. However, the food arrived soon after and I was too hungry to care about anything else.

The quantity was moderate. A plate shared would leave you hungry for a bit more. The chicken fried rice was tasty, very similar to the taste that you would expect from the Tibetian restaurants. However, the chicken that they give with it, is very dry. It's so dry that if you chew on it, it would seem like dry paper. However, the chili pork is delectable. They give you a 3/4th filled bowl of the dish and it smells amazing. The bowl is loaded with pork and definitely it quenched my pork thirst for sometime. I had loads of pork with the gravy which is packed with garlic. However, the capsicum, that should be present in a chili gravy was missing. It had very less capsicum.
After finishing the main meal, it left both me and S hungry for more. So we ordered chicken steamed momo. The steam momo arrived soon after and it was big. The size of the momo is big but it is not exactly juicy and succulent. It is an above average tasting momo with a soup that actually is clear and tastes only like chicken stock.¬†
Oh and finished it off with a thumps up!

Positives: The food, the service and the authenticity. The best part is the price.¬†

Negatives: The cramped up space, the wait.¬†

Th bill rounded up to around 300/-, which is affordable like anything as nowadays, a small lipstick costs you much, much more than that. A hearty meal with such awesome contentment, surely costs more.

I have visited this place more than once and I would definitely visit this place again!

A bit hard to locate as it is located in a dark alley. ¬†Ambience is good. There r these red lights. ¬†Not many seats so max time housefull.
¬†We ordered chicken soup, chicken panfried momo, hakka noodles, chicken gravy chow and chicken hot garlic .. momo was superb, chicken gravy chow was also good. hakka noodles was superb but the hot garlic was a setback for me.. hot garlic was expected to be more spicy and a bit less gravy...hakka noodles and momo were really good here.!!.
this price you pay here is really less compared to other restaurant. Our bill was 400/-. a cost effective place.
i would definitely ¬†try other dishes here. this place is really good. would visit soon.

In love with the entrance of this place. Its a very narrow lane with twists and turns and yellow street lights. Its like you are entering a restricted area. I used to like the food.. the chicken and pork momos, soups and noodles. Its a small and cozy place. Nice during winters. bit clumsy when it rains.

The entrance to the restaurant might be scary to some. The location can be a bit hard to find. Seat can be tough to get as most of the time its house full. But gosh.. The food.. Single bite and you will forget all of these inconvenience that you had to face to reach the place.

Nice cosy Ambiance, nothing too fancy. Awsome food. Cheap price. Be prepared to indulge yourself. One of the best place in city to bring friends along to have good food and do lot of adda.

Will be back soon to the place again.

Hell lot of tough to find the place. Anyway, courtesy GPS, finally managed to find it. You have to pass through a dim alley, which doesn't quite look very decent. However the place itself is a cute lil one. Don't get swayed away by the waiting area :P Anyway,  coming to the food,  we ordered one plate of pan fried chicken momos, one chicken manchurian, one veg chilly garlic noodles and one chicken fried rice.  The momos were amaaaazing. *_* With the perfect combination of veggies n sauce, they were a total treat. The chilly garlic noodles too were pretty good. However,  I found the chicken fried rice a tad too bland, lacking flavours. And I didn't like the chicken manchurian. Didn't seem to be much different from the roadside Indo-Chinese food stalls. Doesn't create a big hole in the pocket. 3.5 stars for the momos. :D

My first restaurant love in Kolkata. I ve taken everyone I know to this place, as a favor, cause its very remotely located and quite honestly impossible to locate unless you know the exact location. 
As a student, its one of the best places for the best food with the best prices.
The spicy chicken thukpa beckons to me everytime I go anywhere near Exide. Steamy chicken momo with the clear delightful light soup is a mandatory order of almost everyone that comes here.
I've also heard a lot about the pork of this place but never tried it. Instead, the garlic chilli hakka noodles and the awesome juicy pan fried drumsticks just blows my mind!
I ve been here almost a gazillion times and probably know the menu by heart!!
I recommend this to anyone who can locate it!!

This is a weird little place, it's like a secret club, unless you know what you are looking for there is no way you can find this place. My colleague had taken me there and I actually was scared to even enter the street but the food was really delicious. Had noodles and chili pork. Both were of hearty portions. nice little reddish glow in the dining space. ¬†If you can find the place, visit once. ¬†definitely worth trying. You will definitely get value for you money.

The food was alright but the ambience put me off. And to top it off as soon as i had finished eating and was stepping out of the restaurant a giant rat whisked past me. First and last time for me.

I went there yesterday after my college and since there was not enough money we decided to give this place a shot. The entrance will lead you to a shabby alley. The place is cosy and small and dimly lit. We had to wait for 15 minutes to get a seat. We ordered chili pepper chicken and pork noodles and roasted chili pork. The food was extremely tasty and delicious. The staff was prompt and price was very much reasonable. The only reason why I will give this a three star is because the small ambience here. Overall a nice place to visit and I recommend it to people who loves having pork delicacies.

Single disadvantage of this place is it is very small. Only 16 people can dine here at-a-time & you have to share your table with some stranger alwys :( As for food, I found pan fried momo really yummy. Chicken Thukpa- one of my fav items of this place.

I have been to this place couple of times. The quality of food is deteriorating day by day and so has the crowd in this food joint. 

We ordered steamed momo, pan fried pork momo and dry chili pork with bar-b-q sauce. The steamed momo they served was ice cold, I had to ask them to replace it. The pan fried momo has lost it's taste. The sauce they served with steamed momo was awful. The chili pork tasted alright but the pork was not at all tender.

I loved this place initially when I had visited, but I think I am losing my interest at this food joint with time. They should improve their quality to hold the reputation they had.

Well i love Momo's and i have heard of this place quite a lot. That it's around the Bhawanipore area but never located it among the glam sham places it has to offer nearby. Yesterday i went there for the first time and yes, now i know why i couldn't. Located in a very small goli as we say here and very low on style and glamour, this place is indeed very hard to find.

I didnt have much time. So just ordered a plate of momo's and yes, they are good if not very good. The stuffing is nice and the price is relatively cheap as well. The soup they give is not what i would like to have again though, very salty for my liking. 

The place is very lowly lit and dark. Not much tables around and in a small place. So its not something i like. Also because of the people sitting and gossiping next to it. Uncomfortable. 

For a fast bite of momo's atleast it's good and cheap. Otherwise I will not really like to go there with time in hand. 


Again. It's based on just momo's. Am completely unaware of the other dishes. As of ambience, it's not something i liked honestly.

Let's start with the goods things. The thing that counts for our visit to a restaurant is good food. Speaking of good food, there are plenty in here - starting from the grilled chilli pork, drums of heaven,  thukpa. The combination of spices are just perfect. It's gives another dimension to Chinese cuisine.  So,  what prevented me from giving it a 5 rating?  It's ambience and location.  It's surely not a good place to run a eatery.  Inadequate facilities in comparison to the price would surely make you wander if got enough value for your money.  But if you are a real foodie,  this is surely something very close to heaven. I would highly recommend this restaurant and it's grilled chilli pork.

Roasted Chilli Pork, Mixed Thupka and Chiken Pan Fried Momo. You will never forget these name if you ever visited Tibetian Delights. I dont know what is authentic chinees food is, cause I never visited china. But as I have visited Tibetian Delights I got a clear idea. If this is chinees, then I must say that I LOVE chinees. I will visit Tibetian Delights again and again untill my liver gives up.
Oh another thing - those who visit resturents not for food but to relax in AC, spend cupious amount of money or watch something else, this place is not a good idea for them. This place is for crazy food lovers like me who is allways hungry, who can travel to HELL in search of a decent meal.
Soon I will be there again.

This place is pretty hard to find. It's located inside a tiny lane near the Rabindra Sadan metro station.¬† You need to ask around to find this spot. The restaurant itself is tiny. It can accommodate¬† at most 10-12 people. By the looks of it most of the people who were there were regular customers.

Coming to the food, we first ordered the Pan Fried Momo. It tasted pretty good with a kinda sweet and spicy taste. Nothing that would blow my mind. Good enough! Then we tried the Tibetian Delight Special Chicken. Now that was brilliant! It was like chicken marinated in BBQ sauce and deep fried. It was really amazing and the taste was pretty unique! Plus, the food was not that heavy on the pocket! :D

Used to love this restaruant. Previously rated it 4.5 . Today they dissaponted me. They did'nt have any mushroom or prawn dish. Served poor quality hakkas and poor chicken with mushroom. They did'nt have time to dice the mushrooms, so made two pieces each mushroom. The Hong kong chicken was ridiculious. Dont know what have happened to them. Really dissapointed.

Was returning home and had the craving for some pork. Tibetan Delight and Orchid being close by decided to stop by the former for a takeaway. Ordered Thai Pork in red gravy and barbecue pork, also wanted to order some steam rice but they were out. So I had the red curry with some home made hot steam rice, the gravy was pretty good and the pork slices were meaty with the right amount of fat. Same for the barbecue pork, could taste the bbq sauce, the slightly roasted feel, with fried onions and green capsicum was a perfect blend.

Very pocket friendly considering taste and quantity. This place is a gem

Among the many tibetan joints in this area, TD, is the best and the most authentic. You simply will go mad if you try their Roasted Chilli Pork, Chop Suey, Momos and Soups. If you like pork, that to spicy hot tibetan style, this is heaven. Close your eyes and you will realize it's the best damn tibetan food you have ever had outside of Tibet!

The Tibetan Delight - what can be written about this delightful place, excepting that it is an absolute delight to visit it every time. We, implying my husband and I have been visiting this place from the time we were in college and we still do so even after a decade. The food is something that you can never forget, the experience being one of the most exhilarating for your taste buds. The simple Thai and Chinese dishes are kept so - simple and that is were the actual delight of the place is. My all time favourite is the mixed thukpa. Closely to follow is the roasted chilli pork. One of the best joint for pork lovers. The pork is left juicy and succulent and not over cooked like most other joints around. My husband's all time favourite is their mixed fried rice with any of the pork dishes, mostly of the roasted variety. The momos are delicious ... almost yummy to the taste of infinity. 
The only drawback being the location that is hard to find without proper signage and the rather too less number of seats. But then I think that is the main essence of the place, it is never to be found empty. That is the amount of popularity it had amongst the Kolkatans.

Very disturbing experience, I mean I have been there once and took a parcel the other time, sadly when I took my friends to this place, they disappointed me! Firstly it rained so much and the small gully that leads you to the place smelt in the worst possible way! also its a shady place, not giving the right vibes, the interiors are nothing different except for some hanging lamps. Now after about waiting for 15 mins in a queue and getting a place to seat, my friends ordered 2 chicken haka noodles and 1 lemon chicken. I wanted to take something for home, but guess what the menu card was snatched away even after repeatedly pleading not to take it only to be kept on the counter and not even to another customer. The waiter was just not that attentive, we had to ask twice before being served with the basic necessity, water!! I was super angry, to add to that the food took another 10-14 mins to be served. We were hungry and took almost 7-8 mins to complete, in between I took a break of 15 seconds when again the waiter came running, this time to snatch away my plate!!

I am just not coming back..

The most loving tiny restaurent..
I will surely give 4 if they increase the amount of the foods.. The quality is really good there.. But the amount is much lesser..
The chilly pork is one of the best dish of tibetian delight..
The momos are so so but the other foods like noidles, sude dishes are mych more better than momos..
Anyone goes there must try the chilly pork..

A nice cozy place it is. I have been here many a times and the serving guy kinda knows me by my face. The roast chillie pork is an all time favorite and as I personally love spicy food, the Schezwan fried rice is my favorite. Also, I and my friends order Pan fried Momos and Pan fried chicken drumsticks. They are a delight to the tongue... A must visit for all foodies.

Snobs call it dingy, but pocket friendly food lovers know how to appreciate a non-ac not suitably located inside chinese and tibetan food joint :D... Located in a so called dingy galli of bhawanipur elgin.. this place is a momo lovers delight. Be it the juicy pork momo which is a speciality, or the spicy pan fried momos, they are lip smackingly good. So is their grilled chilli pork.. which is just hot and awesome! Other good serves are their mongolian rice, manchurian chicken and dry chili chicken

This little gem of a chinese outlet was the place to be, until my last visit.
My friend had introduced me to this great outlet where you would get cheap and tasty good. A couple of weeks back, after a movie , my friends and I went over to the place for some take away. Our regular food of fried rice and a few side dishes didn't take long to be given to us. The food was alright but after a couple of hours I started feeling a little ill and right throughout the night I was visiting the toilet.

I had a temperature the next day, I thought I was the only one suffering from this but my friends were also in a similar condition, sadly it seems this one great establishment which would provide great, cheap food for college goers has lost its charm and lost a few customers as well.

This was the last time I ate at this place.

Not a good looking or a attractive of the lot. Yet i so so love this place.
To start with the place - its tough to find as its in the interiors of a small by lane and you would never expect it that there can be such a delightful restaurant there. The few people who work there or run the business are good bunch of people. Low light, No fancy decoration, only 4 tables and 4 hanging Chinese lanterns and a couple of fans and is quite stuffy inside.
Food if we talk about are above average and good in quantity. I have been there a couple of times and i love their pan fried momo, mixed noodles, chilli pork and the mixed thukpa and they were well made and delicious
Its very very pocket friendly. 300+ tax for 2.

You have to be to this place to have the fun. Do visit soon.

A very small place...Ambiance is average... the place can be very hard to find if someone doesn't knows it's exact location... one may find a queue almost every time they visit... the staff are not that good...if they see a regular customer standing behind you... then they'll call them first... and this is not the right thing to do... quality of service should be improved hugely....

Now coming down to the food...its delicious...great food in great price...try anything and every ting.. you'll find everything tasty... if you haven't tried it yet... do visit soon.......

As a new patron of this long time classic place.. Initial perception was a bit sceptic, how good might a dingy lane might be? :P But the small para-shop ambience, and the fabulously tasty food.. Mahn. :) Have returned here three times since. Service is quite prompt, the waiting guy, quite friendly. He suggested those pan fried momos, and the barbecue chicken and we took that on the side of some noodles, and side dishes.. All of the food were equally good, and piping hot. And the prices were equally great too. Will return here any time I'm around this place. :)

Small cozy environment for a nice winter evening. Chicken and veg steam and pan fried momos of Tibetan Delights are popular in the whole of Kolkata. Service is prompt and up to the mark. Though the place is small and cramped up, the crowd which it attracts is highly envious. This is a quintessential case of a restaurant which is a hit just because of the amazingly superb food that it has to offer, nothing else matters. So, next time you are in town and are keen on trying momos or any dish in the Chinese cuisine, you have to come to this place. You just cannot miss it.

If you thought good things come at price, you are in a delusion my friend. If it is month's end, you are broke but your appetite for good food is insatiable, then always find Tibetan Delights by your side. There is no corner in Kolkata that doesn't have a Chinese restaurant but there is no single corner that can emulate Tibetan Delight. If you are a fast timer, it will be difficult for you to spot the restaurant but all the hard work invested in finding it out is absolutely worth. The interior might look shady but follow the old saying, 'don't judge a book by its cover'. Pork with barbecue sauce and pork pan fried momo are the must ¬†tries at Tibetan Delight. Also, you will find Ashis, the manager, who will suggest you the best order according to your taste or need. It is of course a food joint where quality and quantity go hand in hand, unlike other restaurants.¬†

So, if you are somewhere near Bhawanipore or Rabindra Sadan and your taste buds complain of not treating them with good food, then you must visit Tibetan delights without giving a second thought.

Firstly I would say that this is a very small eatery with 4 tables so if you plan to come here then you might have to wait sometimes for the tables to clear.
Now secondly if you feel like the food is not good then I am sure you are  big time fooling yourself and others, cause this place offers the best in the menu according to the rates in todays times.
Now finally if you feel that its located in a shabby joint then I would agree to this but the food isn't served outside so that shouldn't be a problem and the people serving are polite too
, so one can give this place a try .
My verdict - give it a try

My college was near Elgin road and 3 years I was regular to this place wid my pals and we all used to hog here left right and centre.. Their pan fried drumsticks were another masterpiece.. juicy and delicious..¬† Their chinese dishes are good too.. spclly the Chili pork is highly recommended and the Chicken side dishes.. Fried rice and noodles were good too.. I still dream of their momos and will surely be back to have some :)

This was one of the regular eating spots for me in college. Thankfully, my office is nearby so I can drop by pretty often now as well.

Who would have thought that a dingy, soggy lane would lead to this AMAZING eatery?

Yes, I'd admit the ambiance is a bummer, well at least before you manage to get a table for yourself. But who cares?

The Chili Roasted Pork is just iconic! I can eat up one whole plate by myself. I love the Hong Kong rice over there, its a must try.

The momos are absolutely pleasing. However, its the momo soup for which I crave for.

The pan fried momos are absolutely gorgeous!

If one is lucky, you'd get a table at one go.

I really like the service provided by the waiters and the owners. I'd say the quality of the food is way way way superior than some really fancy chinese joints.¬†Coming to the quantity, the portions are very much satisfying.

I've heard many people (read SNOBS) complain about how "tacky" the place is. All I have to say for them is DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVERS.

Seriously, this place is just not to be missed.

Tibetan Delight is a long time personal favourite of mine and one may say I am a bit biassed towards this place.But the fact of the matter is that Tibetan Delight has been delighting me for a long long time.
It is a bit difficult to locate at first.You will find this place once you enter a narrow shabby alley while proceeding from Elgin road towards the Chai break fifth element.The first time I visited I was kinda fascinated by the shabby entrance which suddenly led to a Darjeeling-esque small cosy dimly lit place filled with wonderful aroma.In fact after innumerable visits I still am fascinated! The place is small with four tables accommodating around 15 people and there is no air conditioning.
In spite of the presence of Momo plaza,Hamro momo,Orchid etc which are similar places are more renowned places for most people located in the vicinity Tibetan Delight has always been my preferred place among all these.
The menu is quite diverse offering various Chinese and Tibetan dishes.The momos are wonderfully soft.The pan fried momos are one of the best you will have albeit a little too spicy for my liking at times.They make a wonderful kothey.This was the place where I had kotheys for the first time and I have been a big fan of them ever since.The soup and thukpa are also very nice and perfect during the winter months.I make it a point to visit every winter for the thukpa,momos,kotheys and the spicy pan fried momos.The main course is also pretty tasty and the quantities are quite generous.The pork items here are very good and one of my personal picks is the roasted chili pork.
The serive is swift.The prices are very reasonable and they do not charge any vat or service tax.The prices have gone up a bit over the years and honestly the quality has also become a wee bit inconsistent of late.This is the reason for me deducting 0.5 from my rating.But still this remains one of those places which are close to my heart.

A dark, mysterious lane leads to this place. The lanes do not look very clean and hygienic and you start to wonder what is this place going to be like. On reaching you realize it is a very small room with a few tables. The look and feel is oriental and it is an experience to go there once. After trying the food you'll probably go there more often. The place is cheap and the food tastes good.  No taxes or extra charges. Service is a little slow but you cannot expect all that from a place like this. If you're looking for good, cheap chinese and tibetan food joint, you should try this one.

Okay,I may be a little biased,but this place is really great! A relation that goes back 6years.I have visited the place sooo many times since my college days.The first time i visited this place with my friends ,I was not sure whether I was going to find anything at the end of the shabby path that leads to this place ;) But since then i have gone to this place again and again and have conquered about 80% of the menu that they offer !!! To start with,this place is very cheap,the don't charge any VAT or service charges. They serve good soup,the thin soups specially taste good.The momos are a delight for any glutton.They serve good ,soft steamed momos.But the draw is the panfried avatar.The panfried momos are great to taste and are big in size too(Strictly personal view-I find them finger licking good).The noodles taste very good,specially the gravy noodles- be it chicken,prawn,pork or the mixed variety. The rice they serve is regular to sum up,whether it is pork ,chicken or mixed. Among other dishes you can surely check out their dry chilli chicken,its good too.The pork here tastes nice(try roast chilli pork).
You may find the entrance difficult to locate,and then you may feel skeptic of what kind of a place is waiting for you from the shabby path that leads to the place,but trust and go on-you won't be disappointed and will surely keep going back.

Location: Bhawanipore.

This little eatery is tucked away in an alley adjacent to M. Das Jewellers.
It can be reached by keeping to your left while moving towards P.C. Chandra from Exide, after you cross Chai Break (Elgin).
Once in the alley, the aroma of the food which surrounds the air, would easily lead you till the joint. ;)
There isn't any ambiance as such. Had a small seating capacity with just four tables (Sixteen heads at one go). One thing to add to it's plus is that they have placed a couple of benches outside the restaurant for the people waiting to be seated (Yes, it's pretty crowded thanks to its quality of fooding).
The lanterns hanging just above your table looks nice, but, you might just bang your head while eating since it's quite low. :-P
You might spot rats running across the lane you walk through. :-P

Had been near bhawanipore along with a few colleagues for some work and were famished when this place crossed my mind. And, here we were for a quick bite which later turned into a heavy meal owing to the delicious dishes which made us order more. :P
Hands-down authentic preparation it was!

Our order comprised of the following:

Steamed Momos (Veg)
The steamed momos were perfectly steamed, the wrap wasn't thick and had a flavorful and generous stuffing comprising of shredded carrots and cabbage. (Five pieces a plate).
Tasted great.
-Sadly, no clear soup was served along.

Pan-fried Momos (Veg)
The steamed momos were pan-tossed in a mildly-spiced yet, amazingly flavorful Sichuan sauce with saut√©d garlic and spring onions. (Five pieces per plate)
Delicious.
Recommended.

Schezwan Rice
This was ordered on the recommendation of the server there.
And, we didn't mind ordering since we all over already head over heels on their Sichuan sauce preparation.
Undoubtedly, this dish tasted great!
Recommended.

The server was friendly and prompt in processing our order.
The service was brisk.

A pocket friendly affair.

Overall a good experience.
-Highly recommended for people who wouldn't mind the ambiance. And, others who wish to try the delicious offerings should also give it a try. :)

I tried after a long long time... And it really till date flags its fame. Hats of to the owner who really emphasized on the food and did not go for expensive interior and expansion.
This is the first time experience for my wife. We managed to locate the place near Rabindra Sadan Metro. 
The dish we tried were 
1)  pork steam momo: The dumplings were just out of the world melts with the flavor
2) Chili Pork: Perfect combination of garlic,chili and soy sauce. Wish it would have been in beef. I tasted similar kind of beef preparation named as Kobari Beef. They just pinched the same eternal taste.
3) The chili pork actually made me and my wife craving for more and we ordered Roasted Pork and Shezuan Noodles.,
Need less to say both were quite good but I am more leaned towards Chili Pork.
Thanks to the owner to keep the price within the range of college goers and budding lovers. But taste is much better to many big players. 
normally non ac and this kind of interiors should get rating 3 but just its food could fetch 1.5 more points.....

This place is a bit difficult to find,if you are going for the first time. It is situated in a small alley in bhowanipore,near forum mall. A very tiny and cozy place wit dim lights. The ambience is just about okay,a disappointing fact is there is no air-condition. Now coming to the food,their chicken/pork steamed and pan fried momo are worth mentioning. The thukpa is also worth trying. The other chinese dishes are just about okay,nothing extra-ordinary. If you love momos, and want to go easy on ur pocket,i would definitely recommend this place.

Located in a small dark alley opposite to the rabindra sadan metro outlet near the direction of brand factory, this gem of a place is almost impossible to find on your own. Food is quite tasty and very very light on pocket. Also one of the few places that offer yummy pork dishes. I just love their pan fried chicken drum stick, pan fried momo, roasted chili pork and barbq chicken. Also their one and only waiter Asis da is very friendly. Many people would say that the place is very congested and cleanliness is an issue but still i would say given the price point and tasty food , ambience hardly matters. I was almost a regular during my college days. Even now i come by to have a bite whenever i am in the area. Only major drawback is very small capacity and during holidays the waiting time is huge!! Highly recommended if you are in for tasty tibetian dishes and got small budget.

Hands down the best PORK WITH MUSHROOMS is ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY available only at this joint.. I am in love with this dark dingy in a by-lane dirty little restaurant.. They have a no fuss system.. hanging lanterns, steel plates, plastic jugs and Awesome food this place is a foodies paradise. The prices are pocket friendly and that is a reason i could spend so much of the time we spent after bunking college here . The place is small and they tend to hurry you out after you have eaten but that is because of the loooonnggggggggg que of people awaiting their turn to devour the tasty treats this place has to offer.. i like the momo plaza momo better and the complementary soup is a little like soap water . I recommend you do not touch that at all  

Must try:
1. pork with mushroom 
2. chilly pork
3. chicken lollipop
4.hot and sour soup

over all it is a place you can chill with friends even end of the month  when your  pocket is on the verge of "empty"  and still come back full and happy if you order the right things

but the only fault is place is too small only 4 tables..so little space..also the the small alley isn't clean enough..but those shortcomings are covered by their tasty food..

i like the pan fried momo way too much..mouth watering i must say,even when writing my mouth is filled with water..

next their tibetan mix chow with pork egg chicken mushroom .a delicacy with chicken side dish...the spicy pork items are also tasty..

a must visit for the chinese & tibetan food lovers...

A small little joint located in a tiny lane beside Rabindra Sadan metro station, this has become a hub for youngsters in a short amount of time. The first thing that'll strike you as a downside is the location, although located in a prime position, it is situated in a shabby little lane that many may deem unsafe and many would prefer to avoid the place solely coz of the location. It's dingy and I cannot really guarantee the hygiene but what I can guarantee is the taste of the food.
As a college goer,  I always look for places that serves tasty food without draining my pocket and this was an amazing find. Reasonably priced, and tasty food is always a good thing.
The pan fried pork momos are amazing, even the steamed momos are a marvel. I prefer pork momo over chicken but they make both pretty good here. Chicken in Barbecue Sauce and Roast Chili Pork were much better than I had expected. Pork Chop Suey was very tasty but the Thai Chop Suey was a let down as there was no material, no pork chicken or anything. They might have served veg for some reason even after repeating the order a few times. Pork with Schezwan Sauce was also good, and manchurian chicken was standard.
Now do not get carried away, when I say that the food is amazing, you must always keep in mind the price you are paying, compared to that it is amazing, it would be an injustice to compare it to well known expensive restaurants. But as for me the price plays an important factor, in my opinion this is good place to hog.
I do have complaints against the staff as there is only one man taking the order and he's very slow to respond and it seems as if he is in his own world. Although the food doesn't take very long to arrive. And it'd be good if the place was air conditioned but that might be a bit too much to ask.
A must visit to all college goers and momo lovers. The place is mainly famous for it's pork momo which you should definitely try.

Tibetan Delight used to be our hangout place in college days as it was very pocket friendly and the food was awesome. It's located in a shabby neighbourhood , and you might actually not be able to locate it the first time. The restaurant itself is dimly lit, and gloomy and the ambience is not very inviting.
Coming to  food,  Roast Chilli Pork is an absolute must. The pan fried momos also used to be a regular for us and we used to gobble up several of those. The thukpa and noodles were also pretty good and we were always satisfied with the food here.

A very nice joint for momos and ofcourse the pork and I would definitely suggest it.

Missing those college days. :(

If I want to eat pork in Kolkata, this is 'the place" .  Only the foodies know this place and I can bet they love it. If you are going for first time, definitely go for their " Roast chilli pork" . I love their  "chicken thukpa" and "chicken ga thuk" as well. All tibetian delicacies made by them are good to eat. And it will fit your pocket well. The appearance of the restaurant may not be eye-catching , but I am sure the food will compensate for that.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a silver fork to eat Good food‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs all about Tibetan Delight. The very first day when I visited this restaurant, the first thing came into my mind was ‚Äúhow dirty‚Äù. And yes, it is. The location is not at all promising. A small restaurant with 4 tables and the most annoying part is, if its full then you‚Äôll have to wait in a dirty stinky lane. Well once you enter, the ambience is acceptable. The decor and the Chinese lamps complementing each other, gives you an ‚Äúok ‚Äútype feeling.  Coming to the food section, starting with the momos, this is what Tibetan Delight is really famous for. It provides you delicious momos (both steam and fried).  Apart from this, the Chicken lollipop with pan fried sauce is mouth watering of which the fried onions, capsicum, veggies are yummy. The chicken lollipop with barbeque sauce is crispy n spicy which caters to my taste bud the most.  Moving forward to the main course, I generally prefer chicken rice with sadded chicken/lemon chicken/Manchurian/hot garlic chicken. The taste of the rice is good and they provide adequate amount too.  The side dishes are also flavorsome. The hot garlic chicken is spicy than the rest of them.  Recently again tried their lemon chicken, didn‚Äôt liked it.  The chicken pieces were hot, at least, but otherwise nothing special. I tried their Chinese chopsuey once and then only decided not to have it ever again. It was merely warm and flavorless.  They make palatable noodles, only the garlic noodle is yummy. 
Overall, the starters are far better than the main course.  The quality of the main course has drained a lot; I can say this coz I have been here countless times. Most importantly, its time they should relocate to attract more crowd. Waiting for it!!

I highly recommend this small bit of heaven for food fanatics in Kolkata...may be hard to find..in a dingy galli...4 tables only...bt apart from that...its pure bliss. Arguably the best pocket friendly Pork dish in town

From today this is the go to place for me when I crave good chilli pork!!
This place has been there for ages and I have been visiting since my college days. Rock bottom prices seemed heavenly for our restricted budget. One of the best momo I have had and the place where I discovered the delights of the Thupka!!
But in recent years I have not really been here. But today on a whim and under the whim of this uncontrollable craving for chilli pork I decided to hit T D since I was in that area. And boy was I surprised!! I had expected a chilli pork with generously loaded with pork fat but instead found amazingly lean portion (just one piece containing fat!!). The dish was not overly spicy like some other places and was quite balanced!!
Yes its dirty and hard to find but then I recommend the people complaining so to steer clear since seems to me that they have been lucky enough to have experianced lavish stetile places but unfortunate enough not to have split 2 happy plates of momo between 3 people and still happy to have jst enough money for the bus home.
This place is what it is. Period.

I would say the most 3rd grade, Z category restaurant. It not only insulting the name Tibet  , it also making a wrong impression for those who are small and having not a suitable location but still can provide good quality food. To day I went to this place with one of my colleague by word of mouth and I get served a chicken chowmin which was not fresh, cold, bad smell and surely made day or before than that. 
I believe road side food stall cook better and provide good quality then this. I request every one who read this review, you can make research with food or provider but keep this out of your list as always. I couldn't post my comment before this rating, so I gave least one but originally I would like to give -5 rating / 5 review.

What did all, yes, all of my friends saw in TD that I didn't? No, I mean, seriously, so below average a place has such word of mouth! Only because it is easy on the pockets? Maybe.

The location: For the first timers, don't forget to take someone with you who's been there before, or be prepared to ask plenty of people for the direction plenty of times. Situated in a shady and possibly one of Kolkata's narrowest by-lanes, you have to cross a couple of drains on the way, and after that, you have two choices. Either you're fired up and super hungry, or if you're like me, all of your previous excitement is out of the window. The interior is fine, small place, four tables, Chinese lanterns  hanging from the ceiling, giving the room a warm red glow. No problem.

We ordered Steamed Pork Momos and Mixed Chinese Chopsuey and had planned on ordering a thukpa later. The momos arrived almost instantly. How? It was brought out of the refrigerator, heated and served. The skin was thick, chewy, so much that we dumped it and ate the filing with the broth and the sauce, not spicy enough to accompany momos IMO. Pissed, we completely focused on the Chopsuey at hand, only to find out after the first spoonful that it was too sweet for our liking. The amount was generous enough, but we couldn't finish even 3/4th of it and ditched the idea to order thukpa. 

Definitely not impressed. Might give it another try to see if it was a bad day in the kitchen. Till then, I'll trust the Sami Roll from Saima to save us like it did this day.

This tiny little restaurant tucked away in a lane which is in a lane is my favourite restaurant to have food in. It is usually very crowded out front as people wait for those who are inside tobget done with their meal, but the wait is definitely worth it. The extremely informalbwaiting staff take you order and serve you within minutes and the food that they serve is superb. I would personally reccomend the thupka and any preparation of pork. TRY IT!

Pork steam momo : Perfectly steamed soft momos with delicious pork fillings. loved it. amazed !!
Mixed fried rice, Mixed noodles : Well i wold say simply gr8!! perfectly cooked which comes with the addition of pork.(though they ask you whether they will put it in or not). Awesome!!
I would have rated 5/5 for the above dishes.
But not at all satisfied with their gravy dishes. I don't know why they coats a lot! I had their "Pan fried chicken lolipop" It was sauteed well, sauce was good but really surprised by the coating of lolipops it was nearly 1.5 inch thick :| I was feeling that i was having cornflower fried balls with chicken sticks. :( They do the same for fish and chicken gravy items. cornflower coated shell bombs :( disappointed. I would say less coating gives better taste.

The service is good but they need to take care of the decor as many of foodies visit this place so if they take care of better hygiene and decor, it would be a fine restaurant.

Well, heard about their "Mix ghatuk" and "Roast chilli pork" and looking forward to revisit again !!

Great reviews, decide to visit the place, hard to find, shabby surroundings, small tiny restaurant, long waiting time, disappointed, get a table, just want to eat n go n never return, food comes, amazing food, love the food, decide to try its other items again, may be would prefer it for a takeaway next time ..............thats Tibetan Delight in short.............

Located in a small alley bye-lane exactly opposite PC Chandra, the place might be a bit harder to find than one is prepared after having already read about it in almost all the other reviews. Its a small restaurant with just 4 tables in a small room. And thanks to the great n consistent food it serves, there is always some queue which becomes even more troublesome since the waiting space is pretty dirty n stinky. The place is small, packed, very dimly lit and no air conditioning. The service is pretty fast.
¬†
Coming to food, the food is pretty good with extremely reasonable prices and generous serving. The steamed momos are really good and one of the most sasta in the whole city. The red pepper sauce is pretty average alongside. The noddles are well made and tasty. Obviously the quality of noodles isnt top notch but pretty well made to be liked. The vegetables are decent but few of them are pretty nice especially the garlic veg, babycorn manchurian. Szechwan fried rice is well made and could be tried if one is of with spiced up food.

Overall, the food is really value for money but i would prefer orchid restaurant nearby which serves better food in more decent sitting arrangements but charges a 20-30 percent premium and as far as tibetan delights is concerned, it would be my recommendation to go for a takeaway rather than eating inside

This tiny joint, perhaps the original one of the ones dotting Suburban Hospital Road has been there for as long as I care to remember. I remember the first few visits we had trouble finding the place. One would enter through a narrow alley on the main road, walk quite a few feet and take a right and suddenly land up in the courtyard of a house. That was it. Tibetan Delight. For many it was the last word in Momos.

Four tables meant long queues. The dark alley meant stepping out into almost unknown territory when you finished. But yet the crowds kept coming, into this not too clean, not too efficient place to have Momos. And what momos. They were decent, but the broth had a chaat masala like taste to it that would always put me off. Meat masala I presume. Portions and pricing was decent of course. I never really tried anything else. Looking at the present menu, I see it is still may less expensive than other places.

Must visit again soon.

Absolute gem of a place if you're into pork. Was introduced to this place by a friend, and it took quite an effort to find out the place. The first look of the place was enough to make us think about turning back, but we are so glad that we did not. There is seating arrangement for about 15 people and in busy days you have to wait a while to be seated. The main intention of us was to savor huge amounts of pork, and so we started with the pork steamed momo. Sadly, the fried or pan fried ones were not available. They tasted alright, not anything outstanding. Then for the main course we ordered chilli garlic noodles, roasted chilli pork, and sliced pork in hot garlic sauce. The noodles did not have any garlicky flavor whatsoever, but tasted good. However, the food of the day were the pork items. The roasted chilli pork was just the right amount of chilly with a crunchy taste. The sliced pork in hot garlic was soft and succulent and almost melted in your mouth. We were 8 people, and we all eat a lot. After a very filling meal, we each ordered a bottle of soft drink, and was pleasantly surprised when the bill came to a low amount of 1400. Don't be deceived by the look of the place, it is a must try.

Heard about its 'awesome'ness from a friend and thought of giving it a try . Quite hard to locate as you need to enter a narrow lane and you'll end up in shabby little place . Well having such dim lights in that small a place is not a good idea , it looks more of a gloomy sort than romantic or pleasing in any manner . The smell i got as soon as I stepped in was not very inviting . We ordered chicken lollypop pan fried , vegetable hakka noodle and pepper chicken . And it looked pretty good , but then came the greasy spoons!!! My appetite fled right away. Asked for spoons and forks and saved myself but that was a major let down . The noodle was glass thin and not very soft with minimum flavour . The only difference between the two chicken dishes was their size , the latter being in chunks, what i mean is both the lollypop and pepper chicken were tossed in the same sauce and loads of celery , a bit too sour . 
In a nutshell It is not a very great place

Everyone's been chanting hymns of Tibetan Delight but I , on the other hand find it very average.

Read on...

J coaxed me to try this eatery one fine day after a shopping session at Forum. Initially I was not very sure but then again I agreed. I had to wait outside for my turn. This is shabby little place nestled in a lane. Tough to locate for first timers.
J had been telling about how great food they serve so I ignored the ambience and the not so well made tables, chairs.
Its shanty, and has mosquitos hovering outside while one is waiting. No proper lights either. Very dimly lit place.

We were starving so without further ado, ordered Schezwan noodles and Manchurian chicken.
What came to my table left me aghast!

Thin glass noodles, with no proper seasoning or any hint of hotness in it, just the plain roadside stalls that sells noodles, a ditto version of it sat upright!
The biggest shock came when I found out that instead of serving manchurian chicken, they gave me garlic chicken. The entire dish was smelling of garlic and I kept cursing myself for giving this a try. I very well knew that this was a very popular joint but what I did not know was the standards that went down so drastically!

Disappointed and wont be back again!

I have been a regular patron to this eatery from my taj days. Was introduced to this gem of a place by my first colleagues. 

Most aren't aware of this place and end up at the 3 other momo joints, on the main road, opposite rabindra sadan metro station. 

This place is hidden and one needs to venture thru one of the narrow dark lanes, between 2 old buildings. The place being so downtrodden yet always has a waiting. They have placed a small bench outside for that. Please do not look into their kitchen while waiting. It might ruin your appetiite!

The restaurant is one dimly lit small room with 5 tables - max 20 covers. 

But the food is mouth watering. The steamed momos, roast chilli pork, mixed fried rice are my favourites. 

Very easy on the pocket. Popular with students & young proffesionals.

Tibetan Delight situated almost near to Shambhunath Pandit hospital is a very small,shaby sort of eating place.
Ambience-not good,the only thing i like was lamp shed n low lighting effect :D :P
Food-we odered Roasted Chili Pork N Pan fried Chicken Momo.
           Pork was good but just tooooo oily,it was actually not roasted but fried instead n served with atleast 4-5 spoons of oil(may be more :P)!! :/ .Momo was served with some red sauce(i guess a mixture of tomato n chili sauce n some xtra chillies were also added,which made food completly a waste :/).later on momo  is separated into its inner content n its layer,due to excess of overpouring of sauce!!!
NOTE-the boy serves there was full of attitude!!he was busy entertaining himself.
##I found TIBETAN DELIGHT no more good as it used to be.So no plan of visiting it second time..

A friend was raving about this small place with the out of the world momos so finally we landed up there after some searching (as she too was visiting after 2 years) and oh boy it was so not worth it at all! We ordered 1 hot n sour veg soup, 1 veg steam momo & 1 veg pan fried momo. The soup was superb and in tune with our expectations, and then the momos arrived... They were a total disaster! The steamed ones were luke warm at the max & the filling had a strong hint of ginger which didn't quite taste nice, also the momo shell itself was way too thick & hard. The pan fried momos were worse! They were stone cold, not fried at all, with a red sweet sauce just splashed over it. When we mentioned the same to the waiter he was downright adamant and refused to do anything about it. I am definitely not going back there in a long while...

If you are a real foodie then without giving a second thought just rush to tibetian delight for mouth watering tibetian delicacies. . Though the place is quite small and you need to struggle to find the restaurant too, but once you have the food you will surely forget the rest..
One must try the pan fried momo's, pork rice,  schezwan noodles and my favourite roasted chilli pork...!!!
Thumbs up to tibetian delight. ! :)

Believe me, I am visiting this particular place for last 03 years on a routine basis. The food is awesome and something one cannot expect out of such place. They really serve one of the best Chinese food in that area. And please don't ask for the rates, its really not in comparison with the taste you are going to experience. Ambience is not at par but the Taste & Quality is certainly of high level. If you want to enjoy food (Keeping your pocket healthy & fine) you must once visit TIBETIAN DELIGHT...its really a delight.

I 1st heard of this place when I was in class 10 when my friends used to go out and eat here. So ever since I started studying MBBS at IPGME&R and SSKM Hospital, I have been meaning to visit this place but didnt know exactly where it was! I recently located it using zomato and finally decided to visit it today! But it seems locating it on a map wasn't quite enough as I had to ask quite a few people to understand exactly which alley it was located in. Finally having gone down the small alley I found the place and though it is a very small food joint, I quite liked the ambience of this place, specially the lantern style lamps lit over each of the table. I ordered for pork pan fried momo (deep fried), pork kothey and chicken thukpa. Service was well enough. The momo was a total treat! From the covering of the momo, to the minced meat inside and the spicy gravy in which it is tossed, everything about it was delicious! Its a real shame that they dont provide soup with the pan fried variety though. The kothey was quite tasty too. As for the thukpa, having not tried thukpa ever before I can't really judge it but if thukpa usually tastes like that, I don't think its really my cup of tea. So all in all a place of nice ambience with good food at really low cost. The location could have been better though. So I'll be rating it 4.

To be frank this place is unfortunately no more as good as it used to be. The momos fortunately are still good. One might find the fried momos a bit too oily otherwise all the rest are pretty good. The steamed momos are fantastic and especially the hot sauce that comes with it. My personal favourite is and has always been the pan fried momo. The slightly sweet and then extremely hot gravy the momos are served in is just mind numbing. The momos are ordinary fried momos but just served with this gravy all over. It is a must try. The clear soup served before the momos is not too bad but that is about it all. The rest of the food served here are pretty ordinary and one will not miss anything by not trying them out. The service is basic but efficient and I also love the ambiance and seating arrangement. Especially the dimly lit setting. The only thing perhaps one may find repelling is the path approaching the eatery which is quite dirty and may put many people off.

I went to this place during christmas this year. One thing about this place is that it is hidden in an alley and hence the people visiting the place are regulars. The food was excellent!!! The service was reaaallllyyy good. one should defifnitely try the chicken drumsticks, they serve eight pieces for a mere RS 110 which is unbelievable. The momos are great and the size is astonishing!! some might find the place cheap and not up to the mark but i really liked it and would definitely suggest it if you are a foodie. Its a small place serving great food, i would definitely go back for more.

Hidden away in a creepy lane inside one of the buildings,this place defines old calcutta food joints. Plain plstic chairs,simple tables,a few standing fans,and a small bulb above every table.... the ambience strikes the eyes of every person who knows what calcutta was like a few decades back. And if you dont know,you must make a visit here to get an idea. 
Despite a drain running right below the waiting area,the bench is always full. The place is always crowded and the air smells of tibetan sauces. A small window gives a sneak peak into the mini kitchen.
The pan fried steamed momos,the thukpa... both are my favourites. Very pocket friendly a place too !
This place is a must for adventurous foodies !

There are certain places that will remain in your memories even though the people you associate it with is now a passing memory. 2 years back we went there once but some of our friends did not want to enter it instead chose for my then favourite Momo Plaza. Then I went there with someone I had been rediscovering the numerous places to eat in my beloved City of Joy... A little background check and I was more than ready to give it a choice....
One thing I want to say is what gets foreigners inside a dark winding lane through houses to a small eatery has to be something good and well talked of, just as we noticed on our first visit. Then the food, oh! the food, the taste, the softness of the momos, the Thukpa with fried chicken and the Shya-Phalle, the Singapore rice with fish with garlic sauce it became a place I loved, o so loved...
It was just the place to introduce to friends as the place is cheap yet which serves good quality food....
Have not been there for quite some time and I have heard negative things about its quality especially when it comes to pork. While some claimed it stale, some said it was too chewy for comfort. I am yet to go there to givbe my final judgment so I shall re rate only after my experience for now it is still etched in my memory as one of the cheapest and the best place for Tibetan cuisine at that price.
If all this is not enough to make it trustworthy it's name being cited in the movie Hemlock Society as something one will miss after death is enough a reason , I guess

Its was a real pain in the ass to find out Tibetian delight in the first place as it is located in a small alley(2 min from rabindra sadan metro).. even my gps got confused. The ambiance is not good and the surrounding was not that clean. We ordered Smoked Pork In Red Pepper, Thai Chopsey and Pan Fried Pork momo. It was quite decent but I felt there was room for improvement. The momo was really really too spicy... If you are not a fan of chilly stuff, I would rather advice you to stay away from it. Too much spicy even killed the taste. But the staff was really good and helpful. We got our orders minutes after  ordering. Really fast service. But the real dissapointment was the unavailability of Ga-Thuk, Kothey.

Our group of 7 marched into this to loot our dear friend on his Birthday treat! If you don't know this place from previously then it is a real pain to locate it the first time (even the GPS failed us)! It is located at the end of the thinnest of lanes between two houses and behind an apartment and diagnostic centre. There is an inconspicuous little yellow board announcing the place to the world.
The place is dirty to say the least! There are open drains, dogs around the very filthy and sooty kitchen and so on. The restaurant is very dark with lantern like lights covered with crimson cloth hanging from the top. Only 4 tables of 4 are available so it is not likely that you will get to seat immediately. My opinion? Try the takeaway!
We ordered smoked pork with red pepper, pork with barbecue sauce, pork with thai sauce, fish in chilli garlic sauce, hunan chicken and mixed gravy chowmein ( no prawn was available and I was surprised to find no mein foon on the menu).
The pork items were really spicy and tasty just the way I like it but the pork meat hardly had fat with it, I was very displeased with that as without fat pork tastes like chicken's poor cousin! The fish was very bad, tasted very bland and powdery. But the hunan chicken was heavenly! THe mixed chowmein was good too.
The service is slow and inefficient. The quantities of food served are decent and the prices friendly.
In short, a place for decent food for takeaways but does not justify the rating that it enjoys on zomato.

Tibetan delight is certainly a delightful place located on a  pinch of land and hidden from the rustle bustle of the all time busy rabindar sadan- bhowanipore connecting road, inside a 'very' narrow lane. The place itself speaks that something secret is dere about it. And so it is....very small place, with 4 tables, having lamps hanging over each table, making the place dimly lit. The place is not air conditioned yet it is way protected from the heat and sweat of the city. Coming to its food....anyone would love it , specially when they see its cost. They serve genuine tibetan and chinese delicacies. I would specially say about chicken thukpa, chinese chopsuey and definitely chilli garlic pork. This is an all time favourite for college goers as it was of mine in my college days. This place definitely makes it to the list of must visit in the 'explore Kolkata' plan.

Though most people who come here about the space and ambience, I find the atmosphere quite similar to one visiting a small food joint in the hills maybe. Space is a factor when you are going there in a big group. But, whatever the lack is it is overly compensated by the delicious foods there. The pork preparations are really tasty. I always order one or the other pork dishes when I visit the place.

Tibetan Delight is one of those eateries which may not boast of a high end dining experience but does enough justice to the regional cuisine and promises a pleasant gastronomic journey nonetheless.

A long narrow alley bounded by high walls off the busy Chowringhee road, with yellow sign boards flashing the name "Tibetan Delight" proudly, secretly leads to a small bend that opens up to the hidden treasure of true culinary delight.
After a lot of planning and braving the brutal sunshine on a hot summer afternoon, when we finally reached this place, it was completely full. We had to wait for a minute outside, before we were called in politely by a server. On entering, we were greeted by a tiny dark room, dimly lit up with swinging red lanterns, the unclean walls beautified with some Tibetan paintings and four tables set up at the four cozy corners, where mostly young people had gathered for lunch. My very first visit to this place brought back fond memories of the amazing little food joints and pubs in Sikkim.

Our order comprised of Pork Steamed Momo, Pork Hakka Chowmein, Roast Chilli Pork and Pork with Barbeque Sauce (yes, we were fiercely longing for a lot of pork!). The food arrived within 5 minutes and I hungrily dug into my share, slowly revelling in the delectable flavours.
The momo filling was dry and the skin, a bit thick and floury. Unlike the momos, which weren't really served hot, the soup was hot, clear and very soothing. I loved the Pork Hakka Chowmein which was absolutely delicious with lots of fresh vegetables, mild spices and small slices of pork. It contained the least amount of oil and a plate can be shared by two.
Then it was time for the best part, which really made our day. The Roast Chilli Pork, based on a slightly tangy sauce had some perfectly cooked pork slices with a fair amount of spice quotient. The crisp-skinned roasted pork with the succulent fat around the edges had the subtle hint of a smoky flavour that accentuated the richness of the dish. Combined with chillies, onions and bell peppers, the preparation was an instant hit! The Barbeque Pork was equally good with around 10 juicy and slightly chewy slices of the meat and we did not care to look up until the last morsels had vanished from our plates.

Overall, this is the best place for some awesome pork items at the cheapest rates. At this place, one can have a filling meal at even less than 100 rupees! I would highly recommend their Roast Chilli Pork and the Pork Hakka Chowmein to go with it.

P.S: Even if this is a better place for takeaways, my sit-in meal with friends was highly enjoyed. Sometimes, the surroundings get overshadowed by tasty authentic food at such low prices and Tibetan Delight proved how!

Ambiance : 3/5
Food - 3/5
Service - 2.5/5

This was my first meet with the Calcutta Restaurants Facebook community as I was visiting Kolkata and got chance upon to be part of it. I arrived to find other foodies already taking their seats in an already cramped place which can only fit anything less than 25. I chanced upon an empty chair but the heat and the already over crowded place almost forced me out if it for some fresh air.

Since, I did a bit of research on the best dishes to order, I was prompt to order a plate of steamed chicken momo which was served soon, however without the clear soup. I did not bother to remind as I had already hogged them. Next on my wish list was chilly roasted pork which was promptly served too.

I was indecisive on the main course and wanted to a have a plate of pan fried chicken noodles with the white gravy. The waiter did not ask for the gravy options and instead reminded me that it would be spicy. I was little miffed as usually it is bland and needs additional sauce to spice it up. However, I let go the thoughts considering it might be a different variation.

To my utter surprise, I was served schezwan noodles and that too without the chicken. I verified if it was the chicken pan fried noodles, the waiter insisted. I started to have couple for spoons in search of the chicken. Alas! I couldn't find any and had to re-verify with the waiter who then scuffled through my plate of noodles and confirmed the chef has forgot to put the chicken pieces. He got hold of some boiled pieces of chicken and mixed it the noodles on my plate.

I felt a little disgusted as I was having high hopes and my sky high expectation on the food, was just inches above the ground. To level that was the utter disappointment with service. The food joint had information on the expected crowd turnout well ahead of the event but did not add to the service staff. The lone warrior was zapped by the barge of orders coming from the hunger mongers. The service quotient screwed up badly leaving a bad taste.

I hope they take note on the service part to cater on the larger crowd.

i went to Tibetan delight during peak afternoon hours..had to wait 30 minutes..a little tip if you want to get a place straight ahead go either at 1:15 or at 3:00 pm..we ordered chicken steamed momos [the momos were great but give the soup was a miss],chicken panfried drumsticks,mixed Hakka chow,chicken thukpa and the special fish. the food was awesome and yum. but I did not like the special fish..too much cashew nuts overpowering the gravy. the ambience was warm and cosy..the service was fast..so overall a great place considering the taste in the food and the value for money you get..

I don't even remember how many times I've been to TD.
I've got so accustomed to this place that hygiene,ambiance, service  etc doesn't even matter to me except the food.

I first went there almost 5 years back and my first reaction was"where am I going,I might get robbed here!!".
Nevertheless,I trusted my friend and went as he had said the momos here are out of the world!

The chicken steamed momo was really out of the world(however that was 5 years ago)

Now,the momo is still good but not as good as it used to be.
There is only one guy serving you and he is really good at his job.

Likes:

1.Steamed Momo (Pork and Chicken),Chicken Hakka noddles and Chicken drumsticks(dry)
2.Service
3.Price (a total value for money)
4.They even give you Chopsticks if you ask for it.

Dislikes:

1.Pan fried momo and Chicken Drumsticks(with sauce) is way too spicy.
2.If you ever get the chance to see their Kitchen,you'd think twice before going there again.
3.The place where it is situated (yes,it is in Rabindra sadan,but you have to go inside a very creepy lane)
4.Small place (on a weekend evening,you have to wait for 15 mins or more to get a seat)
5.If it gets too crowded,you'd even have to share your table with a stranger.

If you are someone who wants to have some tasty food without thinking about the amount of money you spend,then please go and explore this place!:)

These days there is a increased hullabaloo over 'ambiance'. Everywhere I go I hear 'ambiance' taking precedence over people's taste buds.  Now 'ambiance' is quite subjective , so while beautiful furniture, perfect lighting , excellent service, polite host, excellent food can all be marred by loud parties in your adjacent table and these days loud groups hog most of the restaurants with perfect ambiance but that can never be confused with hygiene and cleanliness which should be mandatory for all eateries. 

This tiny little place located inside a lane on Chowringee road  is wonderful for delightful takeaways. Locating it can be very tricky and had my friend not pointed it out on a previous visit to the area I wouldn't even have known where to peep in. Even then I would have missed it had I not seen two college going kids coming out of one tiny lane which reminded me of by-lanes of the Northern part of the city. once you start walking in there is a sign to direct you further inside the lane and you are greeted by some helping hands washing dishes in a small tiny courtyard. 

The little room serving food is dimly lit but the flooring makes it extremely dirty because of the modern tiles which become muddy very easily. There are a few small tables and so I decided to opt for takeaway. I ordered steamed pork momos, steamed rice with mixed gravy minus the prawns since I am highly allergic to prawns and chili roast pork. After having placed my order I noticed an empty table for two on the side of the entrance and decided to try a plate of pork kothay while I waited for my food. Having traveled extensively in the land of the momos my personal opinion is that while the dirt is a put of the food is delicious. The dough of the kothays was thin and perfect, the red meat was of a melt in the mouth texture . 

The only defect was that the filling was not enough for the dumpling. Either they should have reduced the size of the outer dough or they should increase the amount of filling. While I slowly tasted my food I found it difficult to eat it because of the dirty floor and so I looked around and was delighted to see Tibetan wooden wall hanging adorning the red walls and also that the peeling walls could do with a coating of paint. The lighting is perfect and the Tibetan lamps delighted someone such as myself who adores the mountains especially eastern Himalayan range. The roast chili pork is truly a delight. While it is not your usual melt in the mouth texture but quite succulent what sets it apart and gives its distinct flavour is its smoky taste. 

Their chili roast pork is a culinary addict's delight. As my fellow reviewer has pointed out the steamed rice with mixed gravy could do with a better serving proportion of gravy and since this easy dish can be tossed up anytime at home I would say it can be given a miss . My four dishes cost me only Rs335 and that indeed is a delight. That being said I must say that the meat in the gravy was soft and wonderful. So I would definitely not recommend visiting this place for a sit down meal but when one does get a hankering for Tibetan cuisine this place is the perfect one for takeaways. 

P.S. The Tibetan lady asked me how many people where there with me she greeted me with a very warm smile and invited me in. There has been quite a number of instances where the hosts have asked me with an unbelief in their voice if I was actually dining alone. also my rating for their food would be 4 out of 5 taking the cost into account but the overall rating would be 3 considering cleanliness , space etc.

Recently went there with my school buddy,we met after ling time,its been almost 5yrs since we left the school.
Now about the restrnt its quite a place to visit after watchng a movie at Nandan,
Had to wait for our turn for like half n hour.
The place is still small and only four dinning table,so had to share ours with another two unkwn fellow.
But the crowd is good there so not much of a problem its was there.
Now the food was awsm.
We ordered a PAN FRIED MOMO n a MIXED THUPPA (with pork).
Both the dishes were just FATAFATI and no comments on the quantity.
Both of us were stuffed for the evening.
Great place to grab a snack or dinner.
Prefer the take away to avoid the everlong conjested que.

Been there a few times,good food,good quantity and reasonable price.though the place is quite clumsy but the service is very humble and friendly, tibetian wall hangings and lighting effects adds an extra X effect..
Take away service is also available. Located in a very narrow lane, for first timers i would refer to go with someone who have visited the place before.

This is hole-in-the-wall kind of eatery. It is hidden within an old house along Chowringhee, and if you don't know the exact alley, you are bound to lose it. Once you find the correct place, you have to wait outside because there are only 4-5 tables. The place is dimly lit, and the tablecloths and utensils are dirty. This place is mostly visited ny nearby school and college students, and that's how I also got introduced here.

The momo is a bit too oily for my taste, but I like their gravy noodles. The portions are huge and can easily be shared. Overall it's a cheap hangout and I liked it when I was a student, but now probably I won't go there when I crave chinese or tibetan!!

Dingy exterior, a dirty lane leading you to THE place ~ but once you're inside, there's no turning back. The steamed pork momos and the pan fried momos are to die for! It's easy on the pocket, but filling. You can go there for an evening snack or even for a lunch or dinner. There are 4 or 5 tables and it's usually always full, and you might have to share tables with others ~ such is the demand. A must have when in the area (and otherwise too!).

Apparently this place seems to be very shabby and the entrance is also very very filthy. If anybody is hygiene conscious, then this place is absolutely no no for them.

The only good thing about the same is its tasty food. Their Momos and thukpas are quite good and the 'Kolkata' style Chinese food is good as well.

To me its not one of those "must go" kind of place. But considering its reasonable price and its tasty menu, it wouldn't be a bad idea to visit there for once..

My review of Tibetan delight will span over 10 years. This was a joint I grew up with, and was introduced to when I was a wee kid of 18, first venturing out on my own. Friends would take me with them, wide eyed and gawking, to this place, and we would gorge on the so-called "forbidden" meat, i.e. Pork. 

10 years down the line, the other day Tibetan Delights was the place I ran to after a shopping affair, and I hurriedly ordered a couple of things to take away and something to eat right away. The pork fried momo was too oily, but the sauce it came with was really tasty, so i ate that quickly. The pork chopsuey and steamed rice with chicken gravy, both disappointed, because the chopsuey was very oily and the gravy was too little for the rice.

Update: Went there for the pork kothay and thukpa. Faith Redeemed quite a bit.

Tibetan Delight is a decent place for momos and other kinds of Tibetan food. Slightly difficult to locate, it is a very small place tucked away behind Chowringhee Road.

The steamed momos are rather good. The kothay momos are not. I've been told that their pork dishes are excellent, but on the day I ordered pork, there seemed to be very little meat in the dish.

The place is small and dimly lighted. While that is all right, the darkness also hides the fact that it is very dirty. Cleaning the place up would help a lot. Till then, getting food packed might be a better option.

DELIGHTFUL AND CHEAP FOOD!

In the heart of Kolkata, a dinghy lane leads you to a small Chinese eatery called Tibetan Delight. Don't be fooled by its name as it serves both Chinese and Tibetan fare. Like many Chinese restaurants in Tangra, Tibetan Delight on Chowringhee Road also has a loyal clientele for its authentic and tasty Chinese food. It is a small eatery that serves up brilliant food with efficient service.

This is one food joint in Kolkata that serves not only good but cheap and stomach filling Chinese food. The small establishment is best known for their fiery Chinese dishes. They are synonymous for their momos. Whether pan-fried or steamed, their momo's are always delicious and come in generous portions.  Once there, you can try their pan-fried chicken momo's with golden fried prawns and chicken satay. For the main course sample their Mongolian fried rice with Manchurian fish. If rice is not your thing then I would recommend their Non Veg Chilli Garlic noodles and other Hakka noodle dishes. Otherwise, try their Chicken Lollipops which are considered by many to be the house best seller. Some other unforgettable Chinese items to be had here are Chilli Chicken (dry), Sichuan Chicken and the two kinds of pepper chicken. Both versions of pepper chicken are full of flavor; one version is with the sweet and spicy sauce while the other is like fried chicken strips. Chilli Roast Pork is considered by many to be one of their signature dishes; I really liked it. The meat pieces are well cut and are presented in gravy of onion, chillies and capsicum. This is not the usual chilli pork roast that is found in many Chinese food joints. 

At times, the food quality of certain items might suffer but this is definitely a place that will continue to have takers for its cheap and tasty Chinese delicacies.

I had to wait there for half an hour to manage a table.The waiter there thinks himself very over smart,too arrogant and rude.Firstly I ordered them for chicken satey which wasnt available,next I asked for a pan fried chicken momo(deep fry) which too was not available,finally i asked for pepper chicken.Again I was informed that it is also not available.I felt so annoyed that I decided to leave the restaurant without eating and I did the same.But when I was leaving the place that indecent waiter  spoke to me in such a way that as if he is doing a big favor by serving us.Moreover when I said that here we get nothing for this he stated that do not come here ever in such a bad attitude which is unexplainable....Pls try and avoid going TIBETAN DELIGHT....

tibetan  delight is neatly hidden  behind  all those laxmi babu's  sona chandi ka dukans on jawaharlal nehru road in between elgin road crossing & exide crossing.... had it been 10 years  ago i would have definitely given it a  five out of five , because it was headed  by a small bhutanese / tibetan family back then & at that point of time there were no competitors for momos  to tibetan delight . but i went there recently i found that the quality of momos have dropped a huge deal than it was 10 years back . Although it   is still considered the pioneer of momos  in kolkata   & some say india , but sadly  the same taste is missing . now coming to my experience i had   chicken pan fried momo deep fried  , along with golden fried prawns  & chicken satay.  for the main course i had mongolian fried rice  along with fish manchurian & szechuan fish . Overall decent experience but not like old times . i would  say go back there for the nostalgia  but not for the taste . 3.5  from my side . just wish it was the 90's once again for tibetan delight .

Tibetan Delights is one of the small restaurants in Kolkata which caters awesome food with excellent service. Their food quality is excellent compared to some big names in Kolkata. Previously we used to visit Chinatown for some good quality authentic Chinese delicacies; but not now. We normally maintain a 2-3 times a week visit frequency at Tibetan Delights. Don't go by it's look, it might be little bit odd to find out the restaurant location, but believe me this is one of the best yet reasonably cheap restaurant in Kolkata.

This is a small, dainty little place near the Exide crossing. Finding it is also a task in itself as it's located in a narrow gully that sits between a row of shops. However, once there, you will not regret the effort as they are, quite easily, one of the best Tibetan joints in the city. The Momos are delicious, served with Chilli Sauce that is a little too spicy. The prices are very reasonable and the service is quick and efficient.

The only real negative is that the stock for cold drinks is limited so whenever you need that extra drink after all that Chilli, you might just find yourself in bad luck.

Had some wonderful times here during my college years. Easy on the pocket, this little place has its charm. The entrance alone, replete with twinkling lights and prayer flags, sets the stage for the quaint eatery. Try their pan fired momos and the chili garlic noodles - unforgettable stuff of legends, done inimitably in the old-Calcutta style. This is Tibetan cooking with a distinct Hakka touch, and the result is magic on your taste buds. Highly recommended!

A bit difficult to find out, the ambiance may put you down but wait till the dishes come to your table. Must try- roasted chilly pork, garlic chicken, the mixed fried rice and pork momos. An excellent value for money place. One of the oldest places to serve momo in kolkata, i guess it dates back to 1960's. It would seat about 16 people together, on weekends you might have to wait for an hour to get a place. 2 portions of rice/noodles, 1 starter ,  1 side dish would cost you around 300. A little info for the first time goers- the restaurant is located on 2 feet wide lane beside laxmi chand babu ka asli sone ka dukan( the dukan which is adjacent to the road leading to momo plaza or the backside of sambhunath pandit hospital), gather some strength and walk straight in you will find the place.

The reason i chose to give it four stars is because it manages to fill hungry stomachs without pinching the pocket and leaves the taste buds happy and satisfied-which is no mean feat. 
The best thing about Tibetan delight if you ask me are the spicy chinese dishes it serves-from the non veg chilli garlic noodles,to the chilli chicken dry and the pepper chicken(incidentally i have been served two versions of pepper chicken from this same place-one which was awesome cooked in the perfect sweet and spicy sauce and the other,well forgettable-just fried chicken strips,nothing special..so before you order make sure you ask which one they have on offer).
I also had momos here..Both fried as well as the Pan fried versions(am not a great fan of steamed momos)..While the fried momos were okay,the pan fried momos were just steamed momos cooked in some sweet sauce which i didnt like(if you really want to have momos head next door to Momo Plaza)..
P.S.Once you're done with all the fiery chinese food,wash it down with chilled Thums Up or Coke and you'll feel yourself up on Cloud Nine..

tibetan delight- basically famous for its momos,however did not quite succeed to make me tag their momos as the "best",
i tried their veg momo which was way too salty for my palate
coming to their thukpa-its quite decent or rather good but definitely not the best
hakka noodles- tried both the veg and the chicken noodles but for some unidentified reasons i liked their veg noodles more
roast pork- the only dish that i could say was the best
chicken- i ordered pepper chicken from the starters section and found big pieces of chicken with gravy was served which tasted more like manchurian. however the schezwan chicken was good
gravy noodles-tried their special mixed gravy noodles which was absolutely spice-less,full of veggies and stuffs, topped with a fried egg.
taste was good
fried rice- makes you regret for ordering it after a moment
ambience- don't expect it to be an air conditioned place with a good ambience.it has got only a handful of seating arrangements,dimly lighten and 2-3 fans.
the alley leading to tibetan delight is very dingy and narrow which makes this place very hard to be discovered.
overall its a place that lacks consistency in their quality. sometimes its good and sometimes it makes u feel like having utterly cheap quality food and hence it might not make you visit this place again!

I'd have given 3 stars, but it deserves 4 for the amount of times it has satiated the immense belly needs and with such good quality and low price. In short, I love this place.

Pork/Chicken Steamed Momo - Probably one of the most 'cheapest-but-tastiest' things in the city. Generous size of the momo shall also make you happy. Interestingly, their momo soup has rather been evolving and tastes quite good now - unlike the blandness I use to face back in the day.

Pork Roast - This is specially for the lovers of the animal. Slender, well cut pieces (with or without fat) comes in this crazy, not dominatiing, gravy of onions, chillies and capsicum. This is not your usual Pork Chilly. You'll be left asking for more. Guraranteed.

Chk. Garlic Noodles - The much loved fare is cooked to perfection. Although there were instances of it being a little burnt, but funnily that added to the taste.

Their Tibetan fare is quite nice. I do not completely recollect my thoughts after having food their most of the times. But, I have never come out disappointed and with a very light wallet. Now, that is food.

Finding it is usually a problem for first timers. The goli just comes from nowhere and is quite sharp on your left as you walk on the pavement that leads to Elgin Road. However, once found you'll never forget it. It is also away from the hustle of the main road.

The problem is space. I have had to wait on numerous occasions. they just have 4 tables, which will seat 4 people (a one of two extra on one table maybe). Instead, they also spread table outside the eatery in a little open space. However, the wait is worthy of the act. 

If you have not been here, you are missing something.
