Amazing food , ordered a 4 cheese pizza and thick dark chocolate shake . Shakes are to die for. They dropped in some free ice cream too as they were running a promo . Overall the food was delivered in 30 mins at 4 o clock in the morning . A very good and economical option

Ordered their Pineapple Paradise . The Ice Cream was delivered in 30 minutes . It had a nice packaging . What was most surprising was that it tasted so natural . They have very limited flavours right now but was informed by the staff that they started operations yesterday only . Hope to try more flavours too. -.5 coz they don't have a seating yet. Therefore you have to buy before you can taste but I hope all flavours are equally good.
