Given it's the oldest outlet of Kookie Jar in the city, it's a bit clumsy and congested adding to it is it's huge daily dose of loyal and new customers. It gives you the old bakery feels but the relatively newer ones have been revamped and they look beautiful. Kookie jar is my favorite, and I bet most of the people in Calcutta's, no matter how many new bakeries crop up.

Kookie Jar makes one of the best cakes in town. 
Have had their black forest cake, pineapple pastry and other chocolate pastries. All were good and very light. 
Special mention to the pineapple pastry.

Nothing in world can replace my love for their chocolate cakes. Specially chocolate pyramid, noughat... I can forget all my stress and worries with a single bite. And that's how you win our heart. I have travelled all across Europe and I have never such chocolate cakes ever.  I mean nobody can replace you. They can take away your names but not the taste.  You are the best kookie jar.. Whether bday or anniversary or any occasion you are the only one who comes to my mind... Pls keep on baking the love..

On complaining..they told me fruit cake is like this only...not sliceble .(.as if I am having it for the first time...)....All this after paying whooping Rs.2200 for 2 lb cake .

Kookie Jar has always been a legendary name in the gourmet chains of the city. Though it is in a strong competition with Cakes, French Loaf and Flurys,it's the most trusted place for bakery items. Ruling the city since a long time back, this is the joint serving some of the best pastries and cakes of the city.

I was satisfied with they grub they had to offer. I had their Chocolate Mousse, Brownie and Chicken Burger.

I loved their burger which had a great filling with large chicken chunks and was finely garnished with mayo and onion slices. With goodness overloaded the mousse and the brownie were absolutely amazing. And it tasted heaven in my mouth.

Items are bit over expensive but totally worth it! üëå

An age old name in Kolkata that one may blindly trust. Quality is never an issue here. Their cakes and other savouries have been made to near perfection and theirs is a legacy which continues even today. What they have done is spread throughout Kolkata and that has been a smart move on their part. Love their Quiches, sandwiches and special mention for the chocolate cakes and pastries.This time around I ordered a 'Tom' themed Chocolate Truffle cake for my daughter's birthday and what they delivered was scintillating. Simply adored it. Way to go Kookie jar.....

Mast majaaa....was rushing to the airport when I stopped at this awesome joint to grab some food....I didn't even need to say I was in a rush....this sweet aunty who runs the store immediately sensed the urgency and helped me pick out some of their best dishes....Soo....here it goes

I got a chance to have the chicken burger, chicken envelope and strawberry crumpled pie......the chicken burger was one of the best I have had, the minced chicken was properly cooked, the mix of onion and garnishing in the patty was blissful and perfectly topped with sliced onions and mayonnaise....the bun was a bit too fat.....but the remaining stuff made it up for it....

The chicken envelope was mainly a pie stuffed with chicken marinated with white sauce.... simply delicious.....

The strawberry crumpled pie was something which took me by surprise....sweet on the outside, a lil bitter (like the actual strawberry).....sink your teeth in to this one and there's heaven.... Just as the sweet aunty said.....it was just truly divine...a bug Thumbs up..... Highly recommended....

On the occasion of Diwali, one of my relatives bought us pastries from the reputed Kookie Jar - the finest confectionery in Kolkata. To my utter shock, after I opened the box and distributed the pastries for consumption, I found a "Big Fat Fly" sticking into the pastry. From a Brand which is loved and preferred by all for any occasion, it's my earnest request to kindly double check into the food standards and the products before delivering the same to the customers. The management should look into this on a very serious note and take necessary actions so that the same does not get repeated with any other customer. But for me the faith in the brand has been lost. Also would request the consumers to be more aware and careful before buying food products. As its always believed that "Health is Wealth" !!!!

The best of the lot are nutty triangle, chocolate praline pastry, lemon tart, macaroon tart and shawarma. Lovely food with extremely helpful staff and great ambience. Impeccable standard. A must visit to this bakery for a taste of delicious sweet and savoury delicacies.

Situated in Loudon Street, just beside one of the famous bakery shop, Cakes, Kookie Jar is also one of the most reputated cake shop in the whole of Kolkata and it has been so for many years. 

Though it is old and famous, it has a lot of customers coming in daily to order from here. When I visited this branch, it was really crowded. I ordered for a half pound pineapple cake, 2 chicken egg sandwich, 2 veg sandwich and 2 corn puff. The sad thing is it was almost out of stock at 4pm. I wish they put out more stock fast. 

Cake was delicious. A bit expensive but worth it. All of it costed me rs1001.

After our not so happy visits to Workaholic and Kitchen Stories, we came here to pick some Easter cookies for my baby niece. I was booming with overconfidence that I have already reviewed this place and didn't click any pictures. Thanks that I took a few before eating them at home. Once I tried to click one of a cute Easter egg, the management asked me not to, hence I refrained. 
Every year, Kookie Jar makes pretty Easter eggs and cookies which I have always been hogging over ever since I was a child. Growing up, the intended person has changed and now it's the baby of the house, my niece. We had picked up three designs - Easter bunny, his carrot and a chick. All of them were so finely iced. Just loved every bit of it. They were simple butter cookies, baked perfectly‚Äã. 
Kookie Jar is one of those old bakeries in the city who have never compromised with their quality. I love their Praline Pastry, Blackforest Pastry, Chocolate Mousse, Chicken Quiche - everything. This is one of the best bakeries. Highly recommended. Do give it a try. Happy Dining! :)

Thank God I don't live in Kolkata - it would be impossible to be in the same city and not binge here often! 
We started out thinking we'd grab something savoury for breakfast, and 3-4 sweet things to share. We ended up buying 3 savoury things each, an assorted box of 9 pastries and an even bigger box to take home!
My recommendations: the chicken puff (so, so good. Do have it heated before consuming), cheese straw (perfect for tea time or to accompany soup), chicken sandwich - the one in the hot dog bun (good). My favorites in the pastries: the jam ring (reminded me of a good jam tart), the Cappuccino tart (light and delicious), the lemon tart and the nutty triangle (my favourite of the lot!)

Gist : Great snacks, Pastry. Bit small place so try for delivery or take out. May feel just a little bit overpriced.

I visited this place on 8.1.17 around 5.40PM. Easy to locate. A small sized place which can attend max 10 customers at a time. They don't have a large number of staffs also still well managed. Ordered Shawarma roll, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Mocha Biscuit. Given within minutes but one by one as requested. Shawarma was full of chicken so justified the price. All items tested good. A place to keep the food while eating will be hard to manage for such a small place but will be nice. Will visit again for cakes.

Note : Felt cookie bit overpriced (Nearly INR 100 each) so will try if a review can justify it !

My idea of a perfect birthday cake..gooey, chocolatey, mushy, soft inside and filled with crunchy walnuts and caramel ...and no one has been able to satiate this quench for the "oh-so-perfect" birthday cake except the Truffle Cake from Kookie Jar.You need to taste it to know what I am trying to get through here.The store in Loudon Street, close to La Martinere, is a pretty sight by itself and you will be reminded of the bakeries in London with its whitewashed exteriors and the delectable savories they have in store for you.As you enter you will not be able to take your eyes off the pastries, (I keep drooling, every time).The wide range of sandwiches, envelopes, and puffs will be difficult for you to forego, and then the Souffle, the black forest cake, the chocolate boats will sweep you off your feet!A party for your tastebuds!Go ahead and find your dream cake!

Bad attitude and extreme arrogance is Kookie Jar, Calcutta. 

I specifically told the server I need the products to last a flight to Bombay. Carried the box on me without tilting one bit and realize on reaching home that the Chocolate Tarts are too high for the 'special box' and have been squashed. Two of them were stuck to the cover as you can see in the photograph. The Toffee Tarts have melted during the journey. The Lemon Tarts thankfully are okay. Not once did the person serving advise me that the tarts would not properly or not last. Surprising since he specified pastries would not last and tarts were my only option. 

Little sweet shops in Calcutta now have special boxes to carry on flights and I have never seen them charge for it even though the sweets they sell are priced at INR 10/- per piece upwards. But Cookie Jar with its INR 55/- per piece starting price charges you for the 'special box'.  

Food quality: Good 
Service: Arrogant 
Attitude: Terrible 

With so many new patisseries around, I so regret going there.

Kookie Jar is one of the most talked about place if we consult about buying a cake or pastry. The kind of cakes, pastries and relevant dishes they make are just beyond words. Being doing extremely good in the city of joy and winning thousands of hearts everyday they again dragged me at their outlet for some desserts. Tried the Black Forest and Praline Swiss roll. Both were just silky and smooth. Got a feeling like it was baked and put on the plate. Melted in the mouth as it went in. RECOMMENDED.....

'Kookie Jar'  is slowly but surely overshadowing other confectionaries of Kolkata. Most people nowadays (including me) think of Kookie Jar first whenever we have cravings for pastry. 

This outlet of Kookie Jar is located near Auckland Square near Lamartinerie School for Boys. I was in the area, so I thought of visiting it. This outlet is smaller than the Sector 1 outlet and a smaller one too. I was surprised to see it crowded at 1.15 p.m.All the sweet and savoury items were kept in the shelves. The billing counter was at the centre. One can notice mountains of packets at the upper sides of the room. 

I ordered one 'Chicken Egg Sandwich'  first. It was filled with egg, chicken, veggies, chesse and mayonnaise. The sandwich was delectable. 

Next, I went for the 'Chocolate Praline Pastry'. I have always went for the eggless one. But, today I thought of trying a different one. I was amazed by the taste and  the pastry. The presence of caramelized nuts in the pastry made it an even more delectable dish. 

All in all, a good outlet and I will definitely visit again.

Oldest outlet of the city - my all time favorites that has established its brand in the area of pastries - located near the crossing of shakespeare sarani and rawdon street. Simply die for their pastry and dessert, though the rates are pretty high. The seasonal fruit pudding, pineapple pastry, chocolate truffle and tarts the the outstanding ones in their pastry platter.

Has to be considered one of my favourite bakery in the city. They are quite the pioneers in Kolkata. Great cakes, puffs and some other stuff. Always feel and pricing just right. You could not ask more from them.

The best place in India, according to me, for European savouries and desserts like gateaux, tarts and so on  is the legendary Kookie Jar belonging to Lovey Burman. The cakes and bakes from here can easily give a complex to the likes of Grand Hotel and Lalit Great Eastern. 
I personally have a hatred for patties. This hatred was done away with when I sampled Kookie Jar's patties. No one makes cakes and pastries, or for that matter, tarts and patties, sandwiches and bread like Kookie Jar. This business endeavour has changed the consumerism of European confectionery in Kolkata. The centre for the same used to be the various shops in New Market and now there is only one boss in the arena - kookie jar.

Many times i have taken and ordered cakes from here every time i get brilliant  taste and my all time favourite is the chicken parcel and the choco pyramid. Though the price is a bit high for me but people should try or they will miss it.

I simply love this brand because of their consistency in terms of taste or quality. They have always been terrific with their products and have always impressed me with that.
On a recent visit had chicken pizza and Chicken egg meso sandwich. Both products were freshly served and tasty as usual. The stuffing and quantity of chicken in it is quite appreciated . The quality and taste justifies the price as well. I will alwys recommend them as the finest bakery in town.

Location-Loudon street.

This place is one of the oldest and reputed bakery of Kolkata.Even after decades of its establishment Kookie Jar has maintained the same taste and quality of its Dessert.Kookie Jar has four outlets in the city and supposedly this was the first one.I have been sharing a special bond with this place since my childhood.

Service-The service at this place is commendable.The staff is very cooperative and has been trained very well with the food item.
 
Food-To be honest we have tried only their desserts till date and found it very delicious with perfect amount of cream and bread.We have tried almost all the dessert at this place but some of our favourites are-
1-Chocolate truffle
2-Rich Chocolate gateau
3-Chocolate Noughat gateau

Hope this place carries the same delicacy in the future.

Service-4.5/5
Food-4.5/5

A must visit place for all the dessert lovers.üòÉüòÉ

I have been going to KJ for decades and still its charm/taste/quality is retained. Not a small feat considering the shelf life of eating places nowadays. 

For years whenever some one came from Kolkata (as I moved out in 1989), I used to get Chocolate Boats and the variety of breads without fail. 

Everything here is super delicious. For the first time went there myself to pick up stuff and I felt like a kid in a candy store. I could have bought the whole store. Tried their much talked about Chocolate Eclairs and its heavenly! Wanted to pack it but due to their cream content its shelf life is very less.

Compared to Kolkata prices, its a tad high. Pastries, tarts etc start at Rs. 55. Same goes for their snacks and breads. 

If you want to have delicious bakery stuff, this is absolutely the place to be!

At last I visited this outlet of kookie jar after so many years. On a rainy evening when we were hungry all I wanted was the chicken egg sandwich and chocolate praline from kookie jar. Without much delay my friend and I landed up at this outlet and we ordered for two chicken egg sandwiches , chicken envelopes , chocolate praline and chocolate boat. The decor and interior is pretty decent and has an old world charm. The railings on the top gives the place a very English feel. I loved the array of breads available in this shop. Also the variety of the cakes and pastries available. There were also a section which showcased gift items of various types and prices. The clock on the top of the entrance door caught my eyes. This added to the feel of the outlet. The staff was very cordial and were very good at servicing.

Oh Nooo.. (That is how any Martinian would start)

Recently having done with my birthday, a friend of mine had placed an order of a chocolate cake from here.¬†
While the cake was elegant, here are the problems which I (having a chunk of friends in the baking industry in Mumbai and Pune) observed -

The cream was rich, which is fine, but, all I could taste was cream and more creak. It was like having chocolate butter down my throat. The sponge was really less and the cake was just (2 pounds) one and a half pound of putter cream. That's all!¬†

Now in a cake, everything matter, even the texture and the presentation, i get it, but most importantly the taste, the thickness, the variants. For this cake, it was just butter, a taste of chocolate, and just butter and more butter. ¬†

The most unfortunate part was the fact that I couldn't enjoy my own birthday cake.¬†
Guys, please think once again before ordering a chocolate cake from here.

Full 5 stars for the place. Epic cakes. Epic desserts with its famous chocolate boat and lemon tart. When I was a student in Singapore, people used to ask for them and I had to take these there. They have a special cardboard box for taking while travelling.
Snacking items are also available but I have never tried.
Great job KJ, keep it up.

Its very unfortunate to write this very harrowing experience about Kookie Jar, where I have been frequenting for the past 20 years.

I had sent my office peon for purchase of 2 Marble cakes for delivery the next day with my Credit Card, which I was aware Kookie Jar accepts. On accepting the Order Kookie Jar refused to accept the card, for best reasons known to them. Furthermore, they demanded a Delivery amount of an unheard amount of INR 300/ for delivery from their factory at Kasba to Ballygunge.

This is simply unacceptable and if Kookie Jar wish the support of their long term customers, its high time they buckle up and understand what proper customer service is...

Their service and relationship with their long term customers have become absolutely pathetic.

One confectionery brand which has not lost its glory in the ages of time unlike some other popular names in this city. They still retain their old popularity and keeps serving some of the most delectable patty and pastries within a cheap and affordable price range. Come here to savor their Chicken Pizza or the Chicken Sandwiches. For pastries, Truffle and Pyramids are my all time favorite. The items are fresh and in my long association with Kookie Jar, I have hardly had any complaints against them.

Goes without saying, it's one of the best dessert parlors in town. They make such soft and delectable pastries. Freshly baked, too. Anything in chocolate would do for me, however, it's always pineapple or black forest pastry for my mother. I am curious to know, if they take order for frozen fruit cakes and hazelnut cakes for special occasions. I'll drop in soon. :)

Whenever  I visit a kookie jar before ordering any other item I eat a pyramid cake, that much love I have for their pyramid cake. I have eaten pyramid cake else where also but I can't compare the taste of it with kookie jar. As a whole I feel if you are a chocolate lover then you would find the texture and taste of kookie jar food items are much better than its competitors. A pyramid cake is a must guys... Do try them...

If you go through my previous Kookie Jar review, it won't be hard for you to comprehend the close but weird bond I share with the brand. It has always been my go to place to satiate my ultimate chocolate craving and continues to be so, even today. 

When I think of Kookie Jar, the first memory I have is of this outlet. I have been visiting this one, ever since I was 9 years old and have not been able to hold my self back ever since. This is the best place to get your hands on some of the best confectioneries in the city. 

Not only have the cakes always been a delight, but it is Kookie Jar that led me into falling in love with dark chocolate. I find Kookie Jar's Truffle Cake in my sweetest desires.

Kookie jar is one of the best cake outlets in kolkata. I have been a regular customer of this outlet since my childhood. Cake and pastries mean kookie jar to me. All my birthday cakes are ordered from here. Love all their pastries and cakes. Favourites include jam tarts, chocolate boats, chocolate praline, chocolate eggless, truffle cake slice, nutty triangle, macaroon tart, chocolate mousse, evasion slice and toffee pastry. Every single pastry in the shop is worth a try. Even their breads and puffs are brilliant. 

Only downside is they dont serve varied flavours in cakes. They only serve cakes in chocolate, truffle and butterscotch flavours, but then its better to rule the sector with few flavours than be a waste with many flavours.

Undoubtedly a Kolkata classic! The tortes, meringues, tarts, pralines, birthday cakes as well as some of the savouries like the corn puff, the mushroom quiche and the chicken burger are matchless. The price is quite steep though, and the management clearly has issues with the staff which is evident in service, break out chains offering the same food at better prices and service and suchlike. Yet, a bite of the cakes here is a must for Kolkatans.

I doubt there is a calcuttan who loves sweets and has not been to this place or had pastries or cakes from kookie jar. I have been treating myself to their macroon tart for more than a decade now. Their chocolate truffle cake has been cut for my birthday for more than a decade now. That sums it all!! If macroon tart is not your thing a close second according to me is their pineapple pastry, nut corner or chocolate boat. A kolkata tradition worthy of its fame !!

I've grown up having the Truffle Cake as this was the one that the entire family loved- it was ordered for every birthday and anniversary! The Lemon Tart, Macaroon Tart, Chocolate Boat, Mocha Biscuit, Chocolate Pyramid and Nutty Triangle are my favs. My suggestion- these are a must have if you have not tried this Dessert parlour yet (which is the pride of the city of Joy!). The Marble Cake is great too!

When speaking of Savoury options- the corn puff and Veg, Pizza are amazing! The Masala Bread and Tomato bread is really nice- you can team it with a dip or have them with a generous topping of cheese (baked to a golden brown) or just plain old, hot buttered toast.¬†

Over the past few years, they have reduced the pastry and bread loaf sizes and increased the prices. However, the quality has been maintained. So, a give and take here.¬†

Last but not the least, their Cookie and Pastry trays/hampers during special occasions make great gifts for close family though the prices can be a bit steep.

Too costly.....Cakes are delicious. Pizza, Sandwiches and other snacks are not so tasty. According to its cost it should have tasted much better. I could have rated it as 5 but if something is kept in the store you need to see if its worth being compared to the cakes or not.Else the rest of the snacks are useless.

I tried their lemon tart and that was pretty good too.

Regular at this place since birth. Among the Best cake shop in the country. One request to the management is to please open your outlets in different parts of the country because whenever I have to travel to any other city, I get Pre orders of your cakes etc n literally be like a courier.

It is a very good place to eat pastries and cookies at. Iced cookies rock! Can have more variety of cookies. 
It is very close to Loudon street and I visit there at least once when I am in Calcutta.
The ambience is good.
It is a really good place to hang around with your friends and family.

In a city full of bakeries and confectioners, Kookie Jar is probably the best by a mile. And has been so since they opened up.

Bite into their succulent shwarmas or try a quiche if you aren't in the mood for something heavy. 

Amongst the sweeter stuff, the chocolate and lemon tarts are a must. Their brownies are quite delectable as well. 

Note: Probably the best and most trusted place to get birthday cakes from in Calcutta.

Price for 2: 300-400 INR

Kookie jar will be on top of my list when it comes to chocolate pastries. The taste and the softness of the chocolate fudge is another cause of delightness. Today itself  I ordered a birthday cake for one of my friends. Basically, I don't give a second thought while purchasing here. It's just yum!!!

What's not to love about this quaint little gem of a confectionary?!  Well almost every single thing! Their decor is rather cute and the smell of the freshly baked items and pastries is mind blowing. 
Be it the legendary chicken envelope, corn puff, chicken & mushroom patties, chicken & egg sandwich or a cheese sandwich their baked items are too delicious. 
Amongst the pastries I love their chocolate eclairs,chocolate praline, mocha biscuits, chocolate boat, nut corner,nut square, super creamy chocolate macaroon tart and the best in town Black Forest cake! 
Each year as I turn one year older....my birthdays, my parents anniversary or a friends birthday is incomplete without their customised creamy buttercream filled vanilla icing cakes! 
I can't even imagine to turn to some other shop! 
Okay so now what's not to love about this place : THE CASHIER - rude & sulky I find it annoying to go to this outlet because of this bespectacled loser, yes it's true he remains busy because of the many many customers, though he hasn't snapped at me but I have seen him losing temper or showing attitude many a times, he has been downright rude to the customers. 
I do feel these days they are HIKING the price way too much which is not cool. As the price is increasing ...simultaneously their nut corners sizes are getting smaller. A couple of pastries and sandwiches costs a whopping 700-800 bucks easily! If they think that just by increasing the price they are making their brand more powerful I guess that's just not fair. 
Nevertheless no matter how much I complaint about the price I do keep coming back here ! But it would be rather nice to see if they could do something about this super rude cashier and of course the price.

My wife had gone to buy breads for dinner today evening at your Alipore outlet. After buying two loaves, she sighted a bun as well, she got that packed not realising that it was another large loaf. When she came home she realised that she is landed with three loaves.We ran back to your otlet only to be treated very rudely, my wife said that for that Rs 60 she is willing to take another thing, but was denied. Having been treated like this she left the loaf on the counter and told the person to enjoy it on our behalf.
Do you treat your over 15 yrs old customer like this , when we buy breads, cakes and nut corners every now and then, pl examine your rules and revert to us, we will appreciate a compensation and an apology. Thanks

While I have heard great things about the pasties and cakes this place serves, and despite this being my first visit to Kookie Jar, their bakery products were the things that we missed out on. But the other food was so good that surely there will be many 'next time' down the pipeline.¬†¬†The building is shaped like a tower and is bound to catch your attention. They have a takeaway counter in the ground floor and an almost lounge-ish dining place in the floor above. The whole feel, the decoration everything seems minimal, avant grade. The staff are non intrusive, friendly and helpful.¬†Now let us come to the food.¬† We ordered¬†¬† 1. Coffee Shake - Just as it should be.¬†¬† 2. Home made fettuccini with chicken in red sauce - Tasted good, looked even better.¬†¬† 3. Orange rind ice cream - Yummy...! ¬†
¬†Recommended.

To say that baked goods served at this place is legendary is an understatement. This place is on our must visit list in Kolkata no matter how small the stay. The pastries and cakes are so fresh and tasty, they almost melt in your mouth. The same goes for the puffs. And there is so much to choose from, you feel bad for choosing one over the other.

Ambience: You can treat your eyes on the vast array of sweet pieces of heaven kept on the shelves. And the aroma of freshly baked goods is just too tantalizing. It is a treat for all your senses.

Recommendations: You can of course try anything and you won't be disappointed. Nevertheless following are a must try -

1. Fresh Pineapple Pastry - By fresh I mean so fresh, that you can feel the juices burst in your mouth when you take a bite. The fresh cream just adds to the delight.

2. Chicken Patty - Another marvel from the bakery, its crunchy on the outside and oh so juicy inside. How they manage it I have no idea but it tastes damn good.

There was a time once when kookie jar was one of the best bakeries in town! But the ridiculous price hiking and the monotony has brought its legacy to pieces.

One of the most overrated bakeries I have ever come across. The reason for the overwhelming popularity is that it hardly has any competition. some of the products, like the nut corners, truffle boat, evasion and tarts are worth mentioning. The usage of butter in most of the products instead of margarine, is also highly commendable.
However, the glaring downside, which actually brings down the brownie points , are the high handed attitude of the staff. Customer service is zilch. I had ordered for a birthday cake in the shape of a tyre. After spending almost an hour at the shop, and going through the nitty gritties, the end product doled out to me was very disappointing. The cake looked like an LP record! And they charged a bomb for it!
They have some set designs for 'customised' cakes. Beyond which their creativity ends.
Prices are obnoxious too, considering the size of the pastries and savouries.
I sincerely hope that Kolkata sees some great bakeries in the future , so that people would know the difference between a great pastry and a mediocre one.

Kookie Jar is an iconic bakery in Calcutta. The moment you enter, the smell of the freshly baked breads and cakes fills your senses. Try anything at this place and you will definitely come back. I am specially fond of the walnut brownies, the macaroon tarts and the chocolate evasion pastry. There are other bakeries around this place which offer similar stuff but trust me, they don't even come close. For me, a perfect dessert means ¬†any pastry from Kookie Jar.

Not really a pocket friendly place. But provides quality cakes and pastries but at a lil high rates.

Visited quite a few times and amongst them once was for my cousin sister's birthday. It was a chocolate cake (didnt remember the name exactly) and it was really awesome. Its a good place to have quality cake and pastries and I may say you won't regret slipping few extra coins from your pocket.

Kookie jar still holds a glorifying spot in kolkata, when it comes to cakes and pastries..
But now they are not thinking much about customer satisfaction...
The serve portions for everything has been lowered and the price has been increased..They are selling cakes at such high cost that it may not hit someone's mind about kookie jar while thinking to buy a cake now..
Still..their pastries and cakes are awesome but too expensive...
They don't compromise on quality.
Still, There are alternates to everything now, and if they continue like this then they will lose customers...

This outlet of "Kookie Jar" is located in the lane of La Martiniere school and adjacent to the basin ribbons outlet. They serve the similar types of flavorful pastries, patties, cakes, tarts, cookies, pizzas, breads, sandwiches as they do in their other outlets. The service provided here is smooth and hospitable as you would expect from "kookie jar". The ambience around here ideal too. Definitely one if the busiest outlets and preferable for picking up quality pastries, cakes tarts etc; in the nearby vicinity.

Picked up a chocolate mousse cake and didn't really have any extra ordinary expectation, going by earlier experience. But this time I was surprised. Amazing cake, perfectly made with perfect mousse consistency. Light fluffy melt in the mouth mousse with right amount of sweetness.¬†

Overall, I would say it is just another bakery. Nothing special except for the mousse cake.

Post a horrible dinner experience at One Step Up... this is where I headed for satisfying my crave for somethng sweet. (Again based on Zomato rating).

The items on offer were nowhere close to what the pics on Zomato suggested. The counters were mostly empty and whatever was left ws seeming to be asking to be picked up! 

The rates of the pastries was wayyyy over what I saw in Flurys the other nite. 

Finally settled for an Apple Pie... though the serve portion was small (didnt justify its price tag)...bt the taste was good.

I can swear by Kookie jar's mutton patties and truffle cake. And how can I forget the nut triangles. They are just awesome. Kookie jar is the best.

Post a horrible dinner experience at One Step Up... this is where I headed for satisfying my crave for somethng sweet. (Again based on Zomato rating).

The items on offer were nowhere close to what the pics on Zomato suggested. The counters were mostly empty and whatever was left ws seeming to be asking to be picked up! 

The rates of the pastries was wayyyy over what I saw in Flurys the other nite. 

Finally settled for an Apple Pie... though the serve portion was small (didnt justify its price tag)...bt the taste was good.

I fail to understand why this taste is so hyped about
 It's just an ordinary bakery and the tasty is not even good. The cakes are soggy and wet and whenever I have tried it, I have never found it fresh. But I am amazed to see the rating here. Well, it's one's own choice, but honestly I do not like the pastries at all in this place.

This is part 2 of my sweet tooth double weekend binge and it is with a huge stone on my heart that I am rating it this low.

First let me get one thing clear. I have grown up seeing the place grow from 2 display cabinet shop to what it is today. That is nearly 18 years or more so I have seen their portfolio also grow from their classic 6-7 items to their variety today. Unfortunately, the baggage of expansion has not been kind with a steady decline in quality, portion size and now flavour.

The quality faltering came to my mind almost 5 years ago when 2 of my relatives got severe food poisoning from a cheese sandwich. I argued that I may be wrong but two people having only this sandwich in common for lunch a week apart is less coincidental. This was confirmed when I followed suit a month later. Needless to say I stayed away from this sandwich since then. This also brought to my observation that their cheese based items and puffs and some heavy butter cream pastries gave me and many people I know a slight indigestion. Same of course was not the case for dry sweets like brownies, cookies and marble cakes.

The occasional change in the portion sizes, I chose to ignore because lets face it, all places do the same before a price hike to avoid price hike as long as possible.

The true face of disappointment came only over the last few months or maybe a year, its difficult to point exactly when. The pastries started to loose the natural bulk and became more sugar water soaked brittle sponges. The chocolate brownies and cookies had more colour and less cocoa flavour and sugar. This apart from the strange unexplained reaction to the butter and cheese heavy products (whether on my account or theirs, although its difficult to say its just me when most family and friends complain the same) lead me to believe that the Kookie Jar I once knew as a kid, that the one for whose pyramid I would walk home from school to save taxi fare and the one whose requests were paramount to your safe return to college upon returning from home (yes, even my friends from Delhi and Mumbai were crazy about it), was now long gone.

I hope somewhere they do return and this is only a blip on the radar but until then I will have to stick to this rating.

I don't remember exactly from when I have been visiting cookie jar and from when lemon tart became my favorite. I only remembered the fact lemon tart used to cost 25 bucks that time and still I m loyal to it happily. In fact now a days I m in love with chocolate pyramid and tofee pastry too along with chicken foccacia.! Looking forward to more outlets in the city ..

This is one of the better bakeries in Kolkata but if you were to rate it compared to other brands outside Kolkata - it is an ordinary place. The pastries are good but nothing extraordinary. I think Kolkata lacks good bakery chains and Kookie jar is one of the big beneficiaries of the same. The local guys love it. They have other fast food stuff also like puff etc. But I am not impressed.

This is simply the best bakery in Calcutta. One can't have enough. The cakes are moist, light and perfect. My favourites are the Black Forest, Chocolate Pyramid, Truffle and the Mousse. If you aren't in the mood for sweets, you may want to try some of the delicious savoury items. It's useless to say that they are good too. It never failed to bring a smile to my face when having their pastries.

Kookie Jar used to be synonymous with pastries and cakes. Oh what a beginning. With a Calcutta fed with Kathleen's cakes, the coming of Kookie Jar was a dream.

The dream spawned many similar places, Cakes comes to mind, and it is still there, located right next to the original Kookie Jar.

Kookie Jar serves a variety of cakes, savouries, pastries, sandwiches, along with smaller chocolates, breadsticks etc. They do a good variety of breads.  They introduced the Chicken Envelopes (chicken patties where the chicken is in a creamy white sauce) which others have copied. It has remained, one of the popular items on the menu. They have other chicken and mutton items,

They also have a range of excellent chocolate based as well as fruit flavoured pastries, many made with fresh cream. I will not suggest any particular ones, as most have their personal favourites. Once again, the among the ones that have endured are the Lemon Tart and the Chocolate Macaroon Tart.

Personally, I feel while at times the quality is better than Cakes, it is often not worth paying the premium. Also, there have been cases recently where we have been given products that have got spoilt, something that has not happened with Cakes. They need to pull up their socks, regain the lost glory.

Their cakes are super! Black Forests, Trufles, Fruit cakes, you name it.

Most of the stuff is very tasty! You will not go wrong.

Been visiting KJ whenever in Cal and when living in Cal.Yes I agree they should open a larger Cafe where one can sit the whole day and immerse yourself into the yummies on offer---and to boot give Flurys a run for their money.Possibly one of the TOP Cake and Pastry shops in the Country .One of the reasons to keep coming back to Cal regularily .

KJ has no place to sit, finding a place to park the car outside is a major hassle, getting my hand on the pastries at home amidst the ever so increasing tussle for them is a big task.  But what drives me through all the hassles leading to the pastries at Kookie Jar are the pastries of Kookie Jar themselves !!!!!!

Kookie Jar changed and has moulded the way we feel about our cakes and pastries for more than 2 decades. For such a long time it has been the undisputed leader in this business of tempting the kids like me with their sinful pastries and have been part of all our celebrations through their cakes. But what makes it relevant in today's scenario with so much of competition and even after not changing so much over the years is the consistency of quality and taste instead of price.

The shop is neat and clean and well lit. Presentation of the food is mouth watering. One very important thing about a bakery is the freshness of their ingredients, especially the cream. But that becomes a no brainer coz they have literally nothing left after a few hours of their opening. So whatever you are eating is fresh and if one decides to visit in the evening after office hours, you will be left drooling over the name tags of their desserts. 

But the proof of the pudding is in eating, and KJ does very well in inciting the taste buds!! Some items are certainly better than others, and I'd recommend their chocolate pyramids, black forest, lemon tart, choc boat, mix fruit pudding over others. In the department for cakes, pineapple pudding cake could be made on order which is fantastic, otherwise chocolate double truffle cake or choc evasion are very good with minimum fuss. I'm not a fan of their cheesecakes though. Savouries are good but not so overwhelming.

I have always wished that they open up some more branches for better accessibility. As for the decor and ambience inside, there's really not much to say about this one and on top, the lack of a seating arrangement. The only bakery that comes close to it is the biscotti in my opinion whose flavours i prefer over KJ for pastries but nothing has replaced the cakes from here. Nevertheless, it has its own essence attached which drives everyone to their outlet even after so many years.

I bring my birthday cake every year from Kookie Jar and that's why it is so special. Their black forest, truffles, puffs, mousse, gateaux, fudge cake, marble cake, fruit pudding - every little delectable thing I've tasted. All of these taste out of the world. Quality-wise Kookie Jar no lesser than Flurys, but on the positive note, the former charges much cheaper than the later. For me, KJ is a perfect excuse to gorge on cookies everyday!  I'd rate it 4 out of 5.

While people in Calcutta are madly in love with Kookie Jar, this place has dated a bit. 

Lots of chocolate pastries on offer and not many of them very tasty. There are so many different kinds of pastries which exist today. It shouldn't be very difficult to make consistently good pastries if you are supposed to be the best bakery in the city. I have been a huge fan of the chocolate pastry here but it seems a bit off now. Pastries should make you crave for more.

The decor of Kookie Jar also needs renovation. You feel like you have gone to an old neglected place when you enter Kookie Jar. One should feel joyous in a pastry shop. 

Kookie Jar needs to improve itself a fair deal to compete with even the local desert shops on offer in almost every city now as far as taste is concerned (Example: Simi's in Indore.).

I had been introduced to Kookie Jar some 7 years back from now and even though the items are bit overpriced compared to that of Cakes, I can't help but return for their Marble Cake and Chicken Shawarma. If Cakes is a rather regular affair, then Kookie Jar is a treat, for all the right reasons.

Kookie Jar on Rawdon street is one of the first stand alone patisserie which introduced class confectionery to Calcutta. As students we used to hit Kookie Jar during fests at LMB or LMG. Going to Kookie Jar was an event as there were no other Kookie Jar or Cakes stores in the city some 10 years back !  Right from the black forest to the lemon tarts ... everything tastes like a dream. But recently the prices have shot up. Comparatively Cakes is a bit affordable. But when it comes to quality Kookie Jar stands out. I simply love the Black Forest from Kookie Jar, better than any other place I have tried till date. The Mixed fruit pudding is over priced @ Rs75, so is the Chicken Egg Sandwich @Rs56. Still I would rate it 4 as the pastries  like the Black Forest, Truffle cake and Chocolate Boat taste heavenly! Classics like Lemon Tart, Chocolate Pyramid and the Chocolate Swiss rolls are definitely worth a try. 
There is no seating arrangement in this store, so you have to stand and have :) Its best to visit the around 12 o clock in the afternoon as all the items are available. 
In short my 2nd favourite confectionery after Cakes :)

Kookie Jar is Calcutta's best bakery, hands down! Thankfully, it doesn't try to kid its clientele into the 'gourmet dessert' brouhaha thats been gripping Delhi and Bombay, but remains true to its roots as a place that serves brilliant desserts and bakes. Its difficult to pick and choose in its offerings, but the Chocolate Boats have me returning again and again.

I have recently visited a newly opened patisserie in Kolkata and though the food was fascinating and teased the taste buds the prices seemed very much out of line and so I decided to pay a visit to the old bakery which gives a sense of comfort. I must say that no new bakery with their goodies can woo Calcuutans the way Lovely Burman has.  At prices which seem quite reasonable when compared to the new patisseries the taste is a notch higher than most bakeries in town. One should definitely try their chocolate praline pastry which is a delight with its ganache icing and butter-cream frosting which sandwiches the two layers pf chocolate sponge cake but the real ' icing of the cake' are the little bits of crystal pralines which gives an unique taste to the pastry. The evasion slice is a chocolate lover's delight being utterly chocolaty. The mocha biscuits are  a must try if one likes the taste of coffee and crispy biscuits with coffee flavoured whipped cream. Their marble cake is a perfect accompaniment for hot beverages. The chocolate swiss roll is for those days when you want to drown in chocolate buttercream       frosting with perfect sponge sheets. Their range of bread is not very wide but the ones they offer are made with care. The wholewheat bread at Rs40 is fresh and a healthy option for any meal.  The tomato bread has a touch of spices and herbs. The garlic bread is the perfect accompaniments for soups. Their range of savoury items could be improved. Though the egg chicken sandwich is quite delicious the range of items in this department is not a lot and for  customers who have visited the shop for more than a decade the options get old and boring.



----- 02 Apr, 2013 -----

One of the best bakeries in town, Calcutta owes its gratitude to Lovely Burman for whipping up these amazing baked products for over two decades. The tiny bakery situated, not on Theatre road but on Rowdon street is a treat for all cake lovers. I have always found it funny that it is situated right next to another shop selling baked goodies but having tasted the items of both these shops I must admit that the quality of Kookie Jar is one step ahead and so is the price which absolutely gives value for money. I have always had a soft corner for their mocha biscuits with the strong taste of coffee in chocolate over a biscuit and the biscuit never gets soggy. Their macaroon tart is equally worth mention for its chocolate filling and crispy, buttery base. The chocolate nougat pastry is certainly filled with bits of nuts with honey or syrup and lots of chocolate. I personally prefer English puddings and hence do not like the pudding which is an overload of cream. Thank God Calcutta has so may good bakeries.

Kookie Jar used to be one of the best bakeries in the city. Kookie Jar cakes were always in demand, and even today, people order cakes from there on on account of their quality.

Sadly, the same cannot be said of their other, smaller, ready-to-eat products. Over time, prices have been jacked up and the size of each item has decreased considerably. Moreover, a couple of items are now very bad. The Chocolate Mousse and the Fruit Pudding, both very well-known Kookie Jar items, now have a great deal of fluffy dough instead of chocolate or fruit or cream,and the containers they come in have nearly halved. The same can be said of most of their pastries. The savoury items are better offf, though - sandwiches, patties and burgers are still good. The open sandwiches introduced by them are not that great, though. Among the larger cakes, the Cocoa Fudge Cake is a personal favourite because it doesn't have cream in it, but the cake texture is still very good.

The Rawdon Street shop has no seating, so a quick snack is a little uncomfortable, since people keep milling around inside the shop and one risks obstructing the display by standing in any particular spot. On balance, it is best to order cakes from here - most of the other products are no longer worth it.

This is my first choice for buying a birthday cake. Located close to st.xavier's this outlet is the closest to my current residence. Their cakes are way too good to be true, heavenly bakers delight i must admit. Truly this brand is the best bakery in town. I am in love with some of their pastries like praline gateau, black forest,etc. even macaroon and lemon tarts are out of the world. Among their snacks, i have really relished their foccacia. Prices are slightly high,but rest assured of the best quality!

i always loved the confectionary items of kookie jar right from the truffle cakes, the moca biscuits, blackforest cakes, lemon tarts, the chocolate eclare are brilliant, however i must mention that patties standard has gone down a bit the mushroom patties,  the chicken envelope and chicken keesh were much better in the past for sure. the standard of breads also is not bad. but definite the prices will burn a hole in your pocket but then who cares if u really wanna buy value for money items, undoubtedly the best bakery in town still miles to go for other bakeries to come close to eat and most of all maintain such prolific standards.

This is one of my favorite bakeries.Love their shawarma roll and chicken mushroom puffs.The cheese puffs could however have bit more filling and be softer since the taste of the pastry becomes too overpowering over the cheese.
Amongst the sweeter options we love the macaroon and lemon tarts.Their chip cakeis also quite nice and loved since it is less heavy tban the cream filled chocolate cakes.The double truffle cake however still remains a much craved sinfull indulgence.However might have been better if it was a bit less sweet.
The cookies also are quite nice but somehow seem priced on the higher side.However for the quality I suppose we would not mind indulging once in a while.

The best bakery in town I must confess. I am totally in love with this place. Nothing disappoints me here I love their bakery section as well as lip smacking snacks. Every year my Birthday cake has to be from here without fail. Yes the prices are high but after tasting their food you all will agree that the awesome food and cakes deserves the high pricing to stand out. 
I would give them 4.5 and will never get bored of visiting this place. 
Whether chocolate, strawberry, black forest or tiramisu flavoured cake there is only one place in Kolkata to go to and that is this one.

One of the first places that I visited in my College days, the Rawdon st outlet is definitely a chocolate lover's dream. We returned here a while back and tried out the delicacies. Strangely enough I realized that the Lemon tart and the mocha biscuits were worth returning for. Also, had the citrus roulade and it was silky and good. I tried the chicken mushroom puff, which was airy and delicate and filling. 

The service was fast, with the people brisk and efficient. I would return here soon.

Kookie Jar.

I have reserved a special place in my heart for Kookie Jar, particularly the store at Rawdon Street. I associate Kookie Jar with school. Being from La Martiniere, I'm sure all martinians would share this feeling with me. Its like when the last period at school is really boring,we imagine a chocolate pyramid or a pineapple slice and wait for the bell to ring at 1:20. The excitement doubled when friends accompany you to kookie jar. I ve been visiting kookie jar since 1993. The price of a black forest pastry or a nougat slice was Rs. 14 back then. Over the last 20 years, of course the prices have increased but so has their quality and the freshness of the cream is intact.

Cakes and pastries are baked to perfection with the correct amount of sweetness, cream and icing remains fresh at all times and has smooth textures. Their signature items are the Chocolate pyramid, chicken envelope, chocolate eclair, nut corner,mocha biscuit, chocolate brownie mousse and of course the nougat slice! I must also add that the chicken and egg sandwich has a delicious stuffing to it which is with gives the required crunch from a capsicum mixed with egg and diced chicken in a special dressing. The additions to their erstwhile range includes the foccacia bread pizzas with chicken, mushroom etc. Slightly overpriced however, great taste!

The best thing about the shop: The unique packaging. Their pastry boxes and the plastic packets which have various landmarks of Calcutta printed on it. This is one of the things that set the shop apart.

My personal favorites and my must eat suggestions are:

1. CHOCOLATE ECLAIR: Soft eclair shaped confectionery item with a fresh cream filling covered with chocolate at the top. 

2. Citrus Roulade - A soft pastry roll flavoured with lemon cream topped with a slice of lime. Lovely on a summer afternoon.

3. Chocolate mousse- A little expensive for its portion the mousse is served in a plastic cup fluffy textures, very chocolaty with a layer of brownie at the bottom. Just how I'd want my mousse to be.

4. Chicken & Egg Sandwich: The tastiest best snack in the shop.

5. Macroon Tart: A biscuit cup full of nuts and chocolate. All chocolate lovers should love this one!

So next time, you re on rawdon street, please walk past all other shops on that street and enter kookie jar for a sinful indulgence of the best pastries in town.

Confectionarily Yours.

A loyal Kookie Jar Customer.

Hmmmmm.....'Kookie Jar'...........My most favourite place of having small snacks especially pastries,patties and the biscuits or cookies. Staffs are well-mannered and i think so far in all my birthdays i have been ordering cakes here and the black forest here is a must try. Prices are affordable and i like the way they store boxes. When you enter there you will be able to see the boxes kept up and the ambience is clean and neat. At the right side,the pastries and cakes are kept while in the left side the patties are kept. The Choco Mousse is also amazing followed by the yummy chicken patties. Kookie Jar has never failed to satisfy me and i also like their boxes in which they pack the food having several designs and but as i know that the meaning of kookie is strange so s it really a "strange jar"?? Anyway a great place and i visit there very often and the cake they make and sell is also luscious. It is just located beside Cakes and Baskin Robins and guys, you must visit there...5 stars for it... Keep it up Kookie jar....

Still one of the best cake shops in Kolkata but as other foodies have pointed out the prices get higher and the portions get smaller. The chicken envelope, mutton patty and chicken pizza are good but the quality of the chicken burger is just average now. Their nut corners, jam rings , lemon tarts and macroon tarts are still good though they have shrunk quite a bit in size. What I miss is the old taste of the Chocolate Pyramid .... not that this one is not good but the "orignal flavour" was awesome.

At one point of time this place was my favourite cake shop... but not any more. The quality of the cakes has really come down especially the Pineapple Cake... their paineapple cake was one of the best in Kolkata but it is way too watery and lacks any flavor now. Even the quality of cream has come down. 

The savory items taste decent... but their sizes have reduced and prices have increased. Having ordered a cake from here for a friends birthday... I was charged Rs. 50 extra per pound just because I wanted a Prada sign changed to Chanel...

Their shavarma wrap has huge pieces of raw onion... but the chicken envelope has always been tasty and still is... the chocolate truffle cake is good but the basic chocolate cake is very dry and woody. 

we dont mind paying a premium price... but only for quality.

i have been a very loyal customer of kookie jar and end up buying almost every 1-2 weeks. But on the 25/09/12 i got a 2lb eggless truffle cake for my daughters bday, there was a long strand of hair in it, which was highly embarassing in front of the guests and then when we complained they were unclear about the matter over the phone and instead insulted us when we were at their shop holding the bill and the strand of hair.They were asking us to get the cake back to replace, which was not possible that day, and now they say its too late. The response from a such a professional store was so unexpected and extremely disappointing. Really sad and disgusting!!

1. One the best bakeries in Calcutta.
2. Moderate pricing.
3. Good quality simple pizza slices, foccacias, puffs, pastries, cakes. I'd rather have Kookie jar pizzas to Pizza Hut, Dominos.
4. Very good sandwiches
5. All the food is fresh, and stock runs out in the later part of the day
