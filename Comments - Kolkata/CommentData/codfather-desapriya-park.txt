This place is near deshapriya park. The place is small nd also not so much decorative. Ambience is okishhh. Loud music i hate most üò¨. Service is not up to the mark. But food quality is good. We took 2 starters .. Both tasted good. Specially bbq chicken wings was outstanding my favorite one ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§. Also creloe fish finger taste was gd.
‚û°THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING TO THIS PLACE

The ambiance is good. But the prices are high for both food and drinks. The happy hour does not have a pocket friendly choice. The quantity of food is not much according to the high price.

Take the lane beside Jugal's to reach this place. If you're coming from the lakes, any lane beside Vivekananda Park. Codfather is nearer to Rashbehari Avenue.

Now to the food. We were 2 people. My companion ordered  fish with lemon butter. I requested a spare ribs. We both ordered mocktails. All of them came after a decent interval. 

Both the fish and the spare ribs were tasty. The fish was deliciously Bengalicized, a sweetness adding an extra yum. The sauce slathered on the pork ribs was top of the pops. The meat was perfectly barbecued, perfectly juicy and chewy.

All these deliciousness can't take away the fact that portion sizes are too small. Even a wannabe Miss Universe will order a second helping.  Prices are too much compared to the amount they serve. Mocktails were excellent. 

Servers courteous. Ambiance good. Will I come again? Yes. But only if I'm sponsored.

Situated close to deshapriya park it serves good food but the decor and ambience is pretty dull. Moreover they don not play their own music instead unpleasant songs from tv.
We ordered: herby chicken fingers, fish mornay(lots of cheese) and mexican fish with tomato salsa and
Cocktails: pineapple wih rum, whiskey shower and codfather special..all were nice and had an buy 1 get 1free offer..just had put more ice than liquid.

It was on my booklist for long.went there with my school buddies for our 2nd reunion,food,fun,adda and masti.its not a very huge place,but nicely designed.we ordered one paan flavoured hukka,first experience so can't really compare,x on beach,whiskey shower,mohito,all drinks were good. BbQ chicken wings,it was good but I had better,chilly pork-it was really good,baby corn-ok.for the main course,we ordered chicken burger,mexican fish with rice and veggies,grilled fish and baked fish platter.all of these tasted really good.
But the problem was the service is tooo slow,only because we were with friends and busy with our adda that's why we didn't mind it that much,any other day it would be annoying,we had to ask for our foods and drinks again and again.The prices were really quite high and the quantity was really very small.

Excellent place for hanging out... Nice music & tasty foods! 
Good quality alcohols available.. A bit costly but worth for the money! 
The location is really fabulous... Especially if you visit during 'Durga Puja' days!

Was planning to visit this place for a long time and was able to visit in a rainy sunday evening. This bar cum restaurant is situated in Triangular park area near Ballygunge cultural puja pandal. The place was totally crowded when we arrived. They serve mainly Italian and continental food and fish items are their speciality. We had Herbed chicken fingers and Beer battered fish as starter. The chicken fingers were prepared from chicken fillets with a coriander based batter and served with mayonesse . The fish and chips is their signature dish-two large basa fillet beer- battered fried and served with french fries and white sauce-really tasty and lip smacking, must try dish. We had a desire to try their lamb lasagna but it was unavailable. So we ordered cheese chilly toast and chicken strogonoff in mains with soft drinks. Chicken strogonoff is prepared in a creamy white wine sauce with plenty of bell peppers with chicken and mushroom and served with steamed rice. To improvise this dish- reduce the bell peppers amount and increase the amount of chicken and mushroom and make the rice herbed with a little butter. The dish would have been perfect then.The ambience and staff behaviour was nice and the loud music playing also need special mention. Loved the experience.
