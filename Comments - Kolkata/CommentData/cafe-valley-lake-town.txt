This is one lazy ass restaurant I've ever been to . It's nicely decorated but there is nothing much to it . The guy was sitting there with cold dead eyes , doesn't really care about anything or anyone . We ordered Hot Chocolate which tasted a lot like bournvitta .

A small place in laketown which can easily go unnoticed by anyone. It's a bit hard to call this place a cafe. It's located a few buildings away in a lane near Jaya Cinema in Lake Town. It's kind of a very average place, where couples can actually sit for hours and spend time, probably hours. I had ordered a sweet corn soup and a patties for myself. Nothing if the two turned out great, for the soup was made infront of me  out of a ready-to-eat soup packet of knorr soups. Not being a packed food fan, I had to let the soup go to waste after tasting it. The patties however was average and edible.

Located near jaya movie hall in lake town. This place serves good coffee and snacks. The coffee is really good and is pocket friendly. The sitting is cozy and is not overcrowded. Thus one can hang out here as long as one likes. Great place with an affordable price tag.

Located just near Jaya Cinema at Lake Town nearly 5mins walking distance. After movie, if you want to grab a coffee, CAFE VALLEY is one the best place. It's a small cafe, it can accommodate hardly 15 people at a time. The ambiance was wonderful with a large LED TV and I was very well satisfied with the foods. Ordered for Cappuccino with Oreo, French Fries and Chicken Fried Momo. The hospitality was pretty good. Less pinch in the pocket, overall my experience was impressive.

This is one of my favourite Cafe. For me it's far better than so called Cafe Coffee Day.The food is fresh, people are well behaved & you can sit here as long as you want.Ambience is good,the place is neat and clean and of course they make tasty food and good coffees.Today we were so full that is why we only had eggless brownie with vanilla ice cream it was divine!

Given the place and the price, I did not expect the coffee to be this good. Nice little place for regular hangout with friends, or even a simple date. The food is decent enough, not the brightest part, though. But you'll instantly fall in love with this place if you're a coffee lover.

Little far from Jaya cinema hall in Lake town towards Jossorroad, It's a small joint with a nice ambience.only two people to welcome you in their domain,the mood was being set by some of the new Bollywood songs.so a quite place have a evening chitchat with friends.But the disappointment came our way through their foods.we ordered cappuccino regular which was ok to its standard, next we order some of their snacks after a few minutes thought we asked for their chicken nuggets & chicken Veg Pizza the name it self is bit confusing so we asked what that would be.so they said its a chicken pizza.so we waited for 20 minute for our order to come,by looking at them it was presented nicely & rustic.but the first bite on the Nuggets let me down fully it was a mix of soya & maybe some chicken which I really doubt there was any.next went for the so called chicken veg pizza which was topped with some pieces of chicken some onion bell papers & tomato & yes some cheese.but the bread it self was dry like anything.so yes food was total let down. when we had not taste their food we thought the price was reasonable but later it was why did we came here.so yes just to have a chitchat with some warm coffee its a ok place to visit but definitely not for their snacks.

Located at a short distance from jaya cinema, lake town, this little cafe offers a decent snacking spot where you can hang out with friends once a while. Ideal for school/college students since it's pretty reasonable. The menu has limited options to choose from (which btw saves time and all that brainstorming :P). We tried cappuccino which was pretty good; chicken tandoori sandwich was ordinary; the eggless brownie was surprisingly nice- light and just the right bit of gooey. People staying around the corner can head straight to this place without much thought whenever they feel like filling up with regular evening snacks with a cup of chai or coffee made outside of home.

It is a decent and calm place for a small date, or a small adda. The best part about Cafe Valley is they never rush on to you for orders or bill. You can take your time, they often take theirs too.
Food is not very delicate, to be honest. But you can try the cold coffee and the Kiwi drink. The Kiwi drink tasted refreshing and seemed like the only noteworthy item on the menu.

This place is in the proximity of jaya cinema. Went there with a frnd. There was just one couple sitting. A very quiet place. Enjoyed the ambience. The coffees are moderately good, nothing exceptional. But the prices are on the cheaper side, so good for a date if money is short. Plus we sat there for 2 hrs and chatted. Therefore a very good place to hang out wid frnds!!

I and my cousin were out for pandal hopping on ashtami morning. In the afternoon, we reached laketown to visit the famous pujas over there. In the mean time, we were too tired and hungry since we haven't had breakfast that day. When i suddenly noticed this small outlet in the by lane, i couldn't resist myself and had to hurry to have some snacks. I was expecting it to be full but to my utter surprise, it was almost empty except the owner and one customer. We took a side table and settled ourselves. Very basic seating arrangements with no such decoration, plain orange walls may make you feel monotonous though air conditioned. After few minutes i noticed that it's self service. We went to the counter and ordered orgeat almond cappuccino,iced mocha, chicken nuggets and walnut Brownie. Within 10 minutes, mocha and cappuccino were served. I liked both of them. Consistency of mocha is good. Then came the chicken nuggets. It was fresh and very hot and tasted decent but the tomato sauce with it was too hot. I had it without sauce. Then came the brownie garnished with chocolate sauce. It was soft and not too sweet. I loved it. Service was fast and price is very cheap. The owner was very helpful and well behaved.

After minutes of frantically searching for a eatery which would satisfy our appetite as well as not burn holes in our pocket on zomato, we decided to give a try at Cafe Valley. Little did we knew that we would be having so much difficulty in locating this cafe as gps led us elsewhere and the contact number of the place given on zomato does not work anymore. We had almost given up while searching it the old way, by the building numbers, when we suddenly spotted it at two lanes before jaya cinema towards jessore road. This little cafe looked pretty impressive to me as we entered but we had little doubt as the recent reviews said otherwise. The doubt was confirmed when we ordered Rara Chicken with japanese flavouring As I have never tried anything japanese before, I was expecting something other wordly, but I was terribly disappointed at the sight of it, as all I could find in the bowl was top ramen noodles with a handful of fresh veggies and some lonely pieces of chicken. I mean this is not about profit, this is downright fooling unsuspecting people. After such dismal experience, the coffee (Cappuccino regular) came to the rescue. The coffee was great and the only reason for me giving this place a 3/5.

The space is not too big but has sitting arrangements for 18-20 people.You have option of sitting in sofa or chairs. It is located in a inner road just 2 minutes walk from Jaya Cinema Hall (near 215 bus stand).We ordered for Cappuccino and patties. Cappuccino was well made - hot and well blended. The chicken patties was tasty. You also get choices of pastry. Overall, this cafe offers a very good alternative to CCD.

I was a regular customer of here till today.But after todays incident i would not suggest any one to come here..it was heavy rainfall outside when the staffs told us to leave as they will go for lunch after closing the shop. In that heavy rain we had to wait outside for more than 1 hour, and on the top of that, the staffs were inside the cafe n were having lunch. None can think of such shameless behavior like that ever. It is the worst worst place i have ever gone.

Caf√© Valley is an up and running caf√© in Lake Town for the last one year. For those who are looking at options beyond CCD and Barista in Kolkata, CV is definitely a good option. Being a comparatively new address, let us enter the caf√© with a 1 rating and then score up or down on various parameters.

The ambience is nice - bright, well lit, airy yet cosy. The cooling is good. The space is not too big but nicely seats around 18 people. Both the sofas and chairs are comfortable. The shop is 2 mins from the Jaya Cinema which is the most prominent landmark in Lake Town - yet being tucked in a little from the main road, gives it a peaceful location away from the hustle bustle. Being inside from the main road also solves the parking hassles. Plus 0.5 for ambience and another 0.5 for location.

The food - the coffee menu (Lavazza options) is well spread. There is good choice of both cold and hot coffees. The equipment is impressive. I have had a variety of coffee here- Mocha (both hot and cold), cappuccino and Americano. The mocha is a personal favourite. The coffee blend is perfect with strong aroma and flavour - just as you would expect from Lavazza. The whipped cream is fresh. I haven't tasted the teas. The food options are mainly variety of ready to serve pizzas, puffs and patties. I have tasted the chicken patty and chicken pizza - both very fresh and tasted excellent. There are some instant noodles options also but I have not tasted the same. There is a good assortment of desserts and pastries - have tried the latter and liked it. Also serve soft drinks, branded chocolates and energy drinks. The pricing offers good value for your rupee. On the whole a "super like" for the coffee - so a plus 1

Service - the place is personally supervised by the young owner Biswanath Ghosh. Hence, the service is good and prompt. Ghosh is extremely courteous and lends a personal touch to the whole setup. Being a caf√©, there is not too much scope of service though - hence a 0.5 for this parameter.

Finally, Caf√© Valley is a perfect example of how a stand alone caf√© should be run to compete with CCD. The owner has not cut corners. The Air conditioning is good and there is no tendency to switch it off if the number of customers is low. They accept Credit and Debit Cards which is a rarity in establishments of this size. The place is Wi-fi enabled and connectivity is great - something that even CCDs don't have (god knows why). They have a well maintained wash room - a fantastic convenience, especially for customers who sit for long time - the poets, writers, romantic couples and professionals working on laptops. An extra 0.5 for these standards.

Adding the above scores the rating is 4.0 now and I think that is a fair reflection.

Some of the well known stand alone cafes can take a tip or two from CV and its really a good option to break the monotony and monopoly of CCDs.

I've always assumed CCD to be the only proper cafe in the area. I honestly withdraw that opinion: Cafe Valley is my new favourite here. 
Located very close to Jaya Cinema, you might not notice it unless you're looking for it.....but try it out, and you'll have a cozy time with little tidbits to enjoy.
I loved their Cafe Mocha and the Dark Ecstasy pastry. There are a wide variety of hot and cold brews to choose from. Also, there are snacks like sandwiches and burgers (only vegetarian though). Oh, and did I mention free wifi?
The prices are extremely pocket friendly too, and the whole place has a warm touch to it.

The only improvement needed is in the area of variety of dishes. While there are several hot brews available, I'd like to see some more frosty drinks. Other than that, it's been a great find.
