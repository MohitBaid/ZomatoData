I have tried their chicken roll , mixed roll and egg roll and their taste was excellent.. I really love their parathas of their roll and specially th echat masala they use its enhances the taste of their roll..

Cheap normal looking desi snakes which taste very good. There are many foodies who love that kind of food. Try samosa, puri sabsi and sweets etc. All taste good.

if u are in the mood for extravagance, this isnt the place for you. this is a plain and simple fast food joint which boasts absolutely no decor. mostly used for takeway purpose. The food is average and not that tasty. it serves chinese and is a saviour when you are walking across that hatibagan to Sovabazaar metro station stretch n u hv nothing for your rumbling stomach. Its easy on the pocket.
