I had never thought that cakes made by home makers would be so good. Much better than what you get at five star hotels. Plus eggless. Loved the cake and the presentation. Have been recommending all my near and dear ones to try once.

The cakes are super soft, yummy and beautifully designed! We ordered a 2 Kg cake for a friend's party. At first I was a lil apprehensive regd taste and quality while ordering from a home baker but was thoroughly impressed with the cake and taste and the quality. A delightful surprise, definitely recommended to all lovers of super tasty, fancy and occasion perfect cakes.

Ordered a strawberry cake for my sister's birthday. I was totally amazed seeing the perfect highlights and vibrant colours. The strawberries covered in chocolate was star of the cake. The aroma and taste was so fresh that we couldn't stop after having just one slice of it.
Wish to place another order very soon ! Surely going to recommend it to my friends.

With so many home bakers coming up in Kolkata, I called up my friend for new options in customized cakes and ordered a cake here by his recommendation. 
The cake was a customised one, a red velvet cake with vanilla cream, this combination was out of my imaginations and what I tasted was yummier then what I thought it would be. Perfectionaly made and delivered on time, will love to order cakes and specially the jars and glasses on further occasions from here.

Perfect combination of taste and look! I had ordered a cake to welcome our lil princess, and the cake made was exactly what I wanted for the occasion. Amazing creativity! Not just me but also the guests loved the cake. It offers a wide variety to pick from and is light on the pocket too.
