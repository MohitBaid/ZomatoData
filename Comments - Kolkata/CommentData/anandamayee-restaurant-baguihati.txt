I will give this a 4.5 rating. Yes, I live near baguiati and and Anandamayee is my place of secret food joint. I have been eating from Anandamayee since year 2008 and it rocks! If you have a tight budget and need a lotta good food, then go for it. 

As usual, have the half tandoori chicken if you are alone, it's a value for money. It's Rs.120 and you get two large piece of chicken.

You can also have the Biryani, it's obe of the best pocket friendly Biryani that comes with an egg. As I love chicken so, yes go for chicken biryani, it will mostly cost 110 or 120 (Prices may vary a little). Overall, it's awesome. 

Highly recommend if you are need a light food and low budget tandoori dishes.

I don't know why there rnt any reviews....
let Me start....then
this restaurant is situated in baguiati main road....and it starts working from 5 pm in the evening....and its a kind of fast food cum restaurant ....(street fast food good restaurant)...
I have had chowmein here....which is OK
chicken lollypop-which is OK....not bad(considering the cost)....
though looking at the Reshmi and tikka kebab I feel.like eating I have never had .....
rolls -no not that great...
service ya ok.....
ambience too bad....(decent people but dull)....
