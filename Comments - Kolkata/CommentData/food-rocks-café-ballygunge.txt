I bookmarked this long back and finally ended up going yesterday. They tried their best to better things up with the ambience. Though people might get negative with the ambience but one have to wait untill they order food and tastes it. We ordered hot chicken wings, mixed kebab platter and chicken roast. The chicken wings were crispy fried and juicy under the crumbs, just perfect it was. Then came the mixed kebab platter there were 4 types of kebab served on a plate, one won't regret ordering that. Finally came the roast and it was the heavenly. Tender chicken pieces with a bit gravy. Once we thought of taking a paratha with it but we didn't. I was very much satisfied with the food, the taste. I'll be visiting again soon.

Lovely place for lovely food. Absolutely pocket friendly. The place was previously the Shaina Chicken , but the ownership changed. Shaina moved next door. Leaving this place for FRC. Both the offer similar food. Chicken Roast tossed in Butter and fresh cream. Luccha paratha, biriyani , no mutton item , everything chicken. Luccha paratha is not as good as Shaina . Shaina 's paratha is heavy and large. But not easily available. So this place is the best alternative. 
This place also sell kfc style chicken fry and burgers. 
One of the best place to have cheap meal. Loads of chicken.loads of fun.

Small eating joint but serves delicacies...
Love the
chicken and cheese burger
Swarnama wraps
Delhi tandoori

The staffs are genuine and food is served quickly!!!
Rates are very reasonable when compared to taste which is why this is a more than one time for me!!!

I tried to order food from this resturent but they said they charge 100 rps delivery charge for just 20 mint far away. I said i ll pay the delivery charge and so i tried to order chicken hot wings and strips but again they said that they cant delivery that small amount and said that they mention in the above that@ mimimum order is from 200 but there is nothing written like this above nor in the menu. Service is not good at all...  i went to their cafe and asked about all this.. they said they dont take delivery charge and bla bla.. then why the hell they say on phone like that... just cheap.

Location : In the wide road right next to Quest Mall, just beside Shaina chicken corner.

This joint serves similar kind of food as Shaina chicken corner.

We ordered a [;ate of fried chicken wings and a chicken burger.

The burger was decent I'd say. The wings were similar to Shaina's chicken fry. Skinny chicken wings coated in batter and fried.

Extremely inexpensive.

Well tried this joint in two occasions. One was a take away and the other was a HD.
Well i've got to admit that their HD really needs to improve. Though they deliver for even the minimum amount of food but they surely take ages to deliver. And when it comes to food quality, again I feel it differs a little if you go for take away, sit and eat or opt for HD. While we ordered for two chicken burger and a kebab as HD they took 1hour to deliver it though the place is around 15minutes away. Burgers were cold and soggy but kebabs were really good. 
On the other hand on our take away day the burgers were soft, nice and crunchy and again kebabs were really good. 
So to conclude they do offer good food in low price ( though we really can't expect a chunky piece of chicken in between the burger but surely its not disappointing) , specifically the kebabs are really good. But they need to work on their HD. Or else its a pocket friendly good joint.

Don't ever order from here! We are 15 minutes away yet they delivered after 1.5 hours. Charged for 3 chicken & 1 chicken cheese burger but delivered only 4 chicken. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ 
Coming to the burger, they broke 1 chicken nugget and spread in the entire Burger...  Terrible terrible terrible.. 
All reviews are misleading,  yes it's cheap but definitely not value for money!

This is a gem of a place especially for Chicken lovers. Their Chicken Burger and Fried Chicken absolutely delectable.Â  Their Kebabs are also brilliant. They are soft succulent and grilled to perfection.Â  The biggest plus point of this place is the food prices, i mean this is a place where you can stuff your tummy @ just 100 bucks. They don't charge any VAT or services charges. So I would suggest you people to visit this place and share your opinions.

On a rainy day, my friend & I decided to go on a random food trip for lunch. So we zeroed down on food rocks cafe.
This is located in the lane opposite of dominos,3mins of walk inside the lane. Also the functional timing of this place is wrong in zomato since they operate from 4pm not the 2pm mentioned over here.

Anyways after waiting for their service to start, we took our place to have our food. The place has a small sitting capacity. Also the hygeine is a big issue over here since we saw flies hovering over our food which was a major turn off. So coming to the food we had the following:-

1. Paratha- Decent round shaped paratha with high oil content as expected. The dough was light in texture & wasn't soggy.

2. Chicken tikka kebabs- 6pcs of decently sized kebabs presented with salad & chutney. The kebabs were very juicy & succulent. Loved the coating & spread of masala over the kebabs. Recommended.

3. Half chicken roast- 2 tandoori pieces broken down into small pieces served in cream,kebab oil & chat masala. The chicken was nicely charred & cooked but the gravy was the ultimate winner which won my heart. Tangy & soury in taste!! Recommended dish with roti/paratha.

4. Masala cold drinks- Normal cold drinks with jaljeera.

The place offers mouthwatering food at dirt cheap prices. Our total bill came to 245 only. The service is fast but they should try to improve on their hygeine.

Lcated near quest mall , i went there with a couple of friends on a Monday evening after office... few colleagues from office had recommended this to me...

Had taken the chicken cheese burger.. Alu burger, fried chicken, masala thumbs up and chicken malai kebab..

All the items were in one word amazing..
the burger bun was very soft and the chicken very juicy..
The chicken malai kebab was just melt in the mouth..
Will be visiting regularly.It's just a chepaer option for kfc and just as good...

This place is a delight because of nothing else but the food.. They serve up fried chicken Kentucky style at extremely affordable prices ( no VAT, no service charges).. and the taste is almost 80-90% similar.. have tried the combo meal which included 2 burgers, 2pcs fried chicken, fries and a coke.. and the chicken cheese kebab was also kind of nice if not great..

Are you craving for meat? 
Are you hungry for chicken?
Then please visit this place.. if you are vegan then no need to think for this restaurant.
Location: beside quest mall next to Shaina chicken corner 
Seating available but cosy. live tv available. Non AC Newly opened outlet it really rocks.. 
We ordered:
2 chicken cheese Burger: 60/-
1 chicken Burger combo(includes chicken cheese burger,French fries and coke): 105/-
Half plate roasted chicken served with yoghurt in Delhi style: 130/-
6 pieces of chicken hot wings: 70/-
3 pieces of chicken tengri kebab: 150/-
1 plate chicken nawabi kebab: 120/- 
2 thumbs up of 1ltre & 600ml.
*Taste: burgers,French fries and chicken hot wings is one of the best. The taste is better than KFC. 
Roasted chicken in Delhi style was good but not best because of the sour yoghurt which made the soury taste and tasteless.
Tengri kebab was awesome perfect spices and tasted so good I can't explain! 
The nawabi kebab was yellowish with a thick layer of malai with spices coated in chicken pieces..
Staff was very good unlimited ketchup, chutney and  tissue were provided. 
I don't need to tell about the price as I have mentioned earlier, as a whole the bill was rs 815/-
**THEY SERVE FOOD AND WATER IN PLASTIC GLASS AND THERMOPLASTIC PLATES,IF ITS EMPTY THEN GONNA MESS WITH IT..
Or else I would have rated 5.

This place is often confused with Shaina Chicken Corner as they are adjacent to each other, but the items offered are quite different. FRC has a spacious seating area with a small open kitchen. We went in and ordered for a Chicken Cheese Kebab and cold drink. The Cheese Kebab is uniquely made with big chunks of soft and juicy chicken wrapped in a sheath of cheese and a thin yellowish roti like substance which we guessed was probably made from semolina. The kebabs were smoked on the oven and served to us after lacing it with some fresh cream along with a plate of pudina chutney and salad. A bite from this kebab made us further revel in it. The chicken was moist and mushy with a generous amount of cheese oozing out from it. A plate of this kebab is a delectable and filling meal in itself. 
Their service, hospitality and sense of hygiene is pretty good. What was extremely disturbing though was that their menu listed the kebab having a price of 150 rupees but they later charged 200 in the bill saying that they had revised it's price. However, this place seems to serve good food at really low prices!

We wanted to visit 'Shaina Chicken Corner'  as we were having chicken cravings. But, when we reached there, they told us that they would be requiring half an hour to get things ready. So, we decided to come back. But then our eyes fell on 'Food Rocks Cafe' . It has been recently built. We decided to give it a try. The waiter invited us warmly and showed us to our seats. He told us what food items were available. We ordered one half roasted chicken and paratha. We could see the preparation of the roasted chicken. After the chicken was roasted it was mixes in a concoction of Amul Fresh Cream and hot ghee. The roasted chicken was then served with salad which consited of onion, beet, carrot and chutney. The chicken was delicious to say the least. The gravy of fresh cream and ghee added to the flavor. It was really a remarkable  dish. I will visit again in the near future.

Visited this place just few moments ago with my best friend. We were looking for Shawarma,but they were unable to serve it at that moment, they assured us we will get it from next month as it is newly opened. We have tried Chicken burger with the live screening of cricket match. Burger is amazingly tasty and chicken was delicious.Chicken nawabi kabab is mouthwatering and yummy,Fried chicken is wonderful as well as nuggets. Roasted chicken is just superb, looking forward to taste their other items.Ranges are pocket friendly and quality is good. Ambience is little crowdy.Great place for snacks lovers.
