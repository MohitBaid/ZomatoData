On the way towards Lalbazaar from Central Avenue, just few metres from the Central Metro Station you will find this "Badshaah" (pun intended) restaurant glossing itself to the masses. While the name – King Khan might sound exotic, the only reason one might feel to enter the restaurant is for the sole reason that it remains empty most of the time. From a distant look, it seems a low walled restaurant but the ambience is quiet and kind of soothing.
The behaviour of the staff are monotonous, lacks smile but they acknowledge you. The taste of the food is okayish, keeping in view the price of the items.

Qs) Should you visit it?Ans) One visit to form an opinion, but, I would not encourage you.

Qs) Why have I rated them 3 stars?Ans) Honestly, I did not find anything great to give them good ratings. Even after being located in the prime location, I am sure it does not attract crowds.

Today i went to King Khan restaurant. I ordered 1 Mutton Kassa with 2 tandoori rotis.
I waited for half an hour. The mutton they served was not cooked properly. The meat was harder then rubber.
The staff who lacked any sense of customer service forcefully took the entire amount for the bill. Even after knowing that the food served by this restaurant was pathetic, the person in the counter was so adamant that he took the entire payment even though i left most of the pathetic food. The adamant person in the cash counter said " Agli baar aayiye.. Hum acha khana serve karengey". 
I would suggest u all not to visit this place.. Rest is up to you.  My experience was very pathetic. I would never visit this place again.

Food is average and service is a bit slow. Nothing to boast much about the food, had ordered noodles and some side dish but it felt as though they had just prepared for the heck of it. If there is no other alternative and you wish to fill your tummy, then you can grab something from here. However not recommended! If you visit here once, most probably you wouldn't want to step in the second time. Plain average..

I was here for a quick lunch as I was on travelling mode but my god my quick lunch became late lunch due to slow service as there was only one waiter and 4 tables with guest service is really slow. The decor was nice for a small restaurant the wooden look was quite nice. Now let's come to the food part well we ordered for 1 mixed fried rice, 1 chicken fried rice and 2 chilly garlic chicken we were four of us the food was mediocre nothing to boast about but yes  pocket friendly.
