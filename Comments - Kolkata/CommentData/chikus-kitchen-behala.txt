This place used to make so-so food earlier. Recently their food standard has deteriorated. Have tried their chilly chicken and rumali roti. Needs hell of an improvement!

this small takeaway joint is located at James long porasatthatola...Tried their rolls which are lighter than the bigger and fancy joints...the dough they take is somewhat less...overall it was average...

Its been quite a good number of years we get yum rolls and quick bites from this take away food joint. Good food.. light food. Rolls, mughlai parathas, parathas are good.

It's a very normal street food place which you will get every para in Kolkata. Food is nothing great but if you compare with money it is ok not bad. I will rate it average. Food quality is ok with its cost.

Nothing special here. Just a roadside shop for local people. They think they are the best shop in the neighborhood but its not very good . Momo is OK type and rolls are drab n dull. Its beter to avoid.
