Well there comes a time when people overdo their profile with five star reataurants.
So here I am going down the ladder to speak about this place .
A simple yet genuine place for some good food with good people .
Nothing fancy or eyecatchy yet holds upto the quality of good food on a daily basis .
So try this place it worth a shot .

An amazing bengali restaurant! This is definitely a place you must try! We went there to dine on panchami night. We ordered long grain basmati rice, special sabji daal, basanti polao, lau pata mora chingri bhapa and mutton dakbangalow. Each and every item tasted outstanding. I bet their other items taste as good as the ones we ordered. Its also extremely pocket friendly. It was surely bangali good as its best! Words of a truly satisfied customer.

Ordered here Today for the first Time, the Items where Shukto, Potol Dorma, Chanar Dalna, Yellow Pulao and Boro Papda Shorse. First of all, Food was delivered on Time, good Behaviour of Stuff. 
The Quantity was small, and they use for different veg Gravies the same Base, Chana Dalna and Potol Dorma had the same Gravy, Quantity of 2Piece per Item and a little gravy was not that great. 
Taste wise i have eaten better! 
Shukto was ok, watery Gravy, nothing outstanding. Lower Standard. 
Boro Papda Shorse doesn't deserve the Name Boro, more over Choto, and for 160 Rupees overpriced and way too much Oil. 
THE SET OFF WAS THE YELLOW PULAO:I was quite hungry, so i started with the Pulao and the Veg Dishes. I was half Way through, when i saw some brown Thing in my Rice, first i thought it was Dal Chinny, but for my unpleasant Surprise it was a COCKROACH EGG!!!!!!! Of Course i complained immediately, and They send me a fresh Batch of Pulao as well as one with plain Rice, but i have NEVER even in the Roadside experienced such a Thing in my Food. Sorry, but this is a big no Go, a Refund would have been only fair for this disgusting Experience, but they did not agree. So, all over i can not suggest Anyone to eat there, God only knows what Surprises they hide in their Kitchen. Actually sad, seems like there are no trustworthy Bengali Restaurants in our Area.

I visited there several times. It is located in Garia, just opposite to Mahua Cinema hall. It's a small , cozy, air conditioning and pocket friendly fusion ( chinese nd as well as bengali items available here ) restraurent. I mainly ordered chinese foods like various types of fried rice, hot garlic chicken, szechuan chicken, etc. and next time, we also ordered a north indian dish , ie, mutton roganjosh and lastly my family members ordered a bengali dish ,ie, chitol muitha and dab chingri ( tastes is awesome)  - these chinese food are good and taste is oky nd the quantity of these food is much better . Decoration is very simple and the stuffs are good. For  college goers daily hangouts, its a good place.

we went there on a Sunday noon. ordered basmati rice, aloo bhaja, spcl veg dal, aloo posto, bhetki paturi, basmati polao, chicken dakbangla. also took misti doi as dessert.
Taste  was decent for all the foods. Everything appeared fresh and good. Served very fast.  Manners of waiters are pleasing. 
Only the paturi tasted a little extra salty.
In the Garia area it is the best budget  Bengali cuisine available. The prices are very competitive and reasonable. No extra charges too. A cons is that the place is a little congested.
Conclusion: They ofcourse deserve better reviews than their present avg 3.4. And in comparison to Bhojohori Manna garia and Saptapadi Gangulibagan they are better.

Located at about a couple of minutes walk from the Kavi Nazrul metro station, the place can be easily located. Ambience is average and so is the service.
                We tried out Chicken Dakbanglow, pabda jhal, Dhokar dalna, potol dorma and rice. Food was average and I was a little disappointed with the quantity.

FINAL VERDICT- Overall I would say I'm a little disappointed with this place, had a lot of expectations but wasn't able to meet them.

This is an authentic bengali cuisine restaurant which you can handpick classic bengali dishes to suit your taste. I have been there on the auspicious occasion  of Subho Noboborsho with my  friend Soumyajit Kanjilal and we were engulfed in the Havana of bengali cuisine ecstasy . Only disadvantage is that often there is a wait there because of demand as short space and passage.

By roadside, a very small gate will make you doubtful , even u will overlook it as I did many times. One of friends took me there and I said 'really?' .. yeah . Really, food is much satisfying and pocket friendly. Dim light and the bottles of water gives a different touch. Their speciality's bengali foods(mutton dukbungllow , ilish vapa, murighonto , bhetki maachber paturi 👌 ...But never try basanti pulao, fries are good) . They provides 'popular in bengal' as a lot of bangali look for chilly chicken and fried rice whenever they go for restaurants. It's worth-saying that those dishes are really finger licking, even better than the bengali foods. 
Although small place, staffs are slow , this restaurant can give u surprise with their food quality.

FOOD - very average. Never seen so much oil coming out of polao. Chicken kasha was also not impressive.

We ordered biriiyani only as we didn't want to experiment. Now I  have had biriyani from a lot of places, reputed places and also from local stalls, and it has not always been good or worth the price. However, looking at the rate here, the biriyani was pretty good. It wasn't absolutely dry, which is what I like, the quantity was also more than sufficient for one person. Yes it wasn't mind blowingly good. But for that money it was worth it, coz you do get biriyani at Rs 120 anymore

It is good to find a restaurant serving Bengali cuisine at the heart of Garia. Close to the Kavi Nazrul metro station, this place has a small entrance but easy to locate.
I was passing by on a sweaty noon and thought of buying lunch from there. Unfortunately, they had no small fish preparation that day so I opted for chicken dakbanglow and lote shutki bhorta.
I love dry fish preparations and was definitely not disappointed by the dish.
But the chicken preparation was average.
Service was prompt. Another thing, they do not charge any taxes (just the container charges).

Had ordered Chhanar dalna; basmati rice;Special Dal; Masala Aloo bhaja and Chitol Machher Muittha. 
1) CHHANAR DALNA was awesome but quantity was less.
2) Basmati Rice was ok.
3) Special Dal was ok.
4) Masala Aloo Bhaja was crispy but no masala was there. It was plain jhuri aloo bhaja. But good.
5)Chitol Machher Muittha was totally a homely preparation which reminds me of my childhood memories. Won't say outstanding but quite good and like home-cooked food.
But the delivery timing was very poor . Furthermore my bill was Rs.395/- but they took Rs.400/-. Otherwise overall a good home cooked food.

Location- Walk straight from kavi nazrul metro towards patuli. Just after 3min look to your right and there is Raja Bhaat Khaowa.

Ambience- Well decorated. Calm. Peaceful.

Food- Had lunch here. Well, they have well justified their name- Raja 'Bhaat' khaowa. They don't deliver roties or tandooris before night.
Delivery was slow.
• Punjabi Chicken bharta- presentation? Check.
Taste? Check. Chicken? No. Not boneless.
• Sada Chawal- Good quantity. Enough for two people.
Not satisfied.

This is the restaurant from where we had ordered food on a rainy morning a couple of weeks ago. They took the order, but when the lunchtime was already over and the food didn't come, we called them up and they said how can we deliver food now? It's raining! And since we had ordered food from them, we didn't make any arrangement at home. After much cajoling and pleading, they finally delivered the food, but by then I was late for office.

And this time they sent us stale food-- cooked on the night before.

And they are awfully rude (which is an understatement), I must say. These people are not fit to be in restaurant business.

Do keep this link handy if you order food from Raja Bhat Khawoa: http://wbconsumers.gov.in/HtmlPages/index.aspx

This is the link of West Bengal Consumer Affairs department. You might wish to move the consumer forum after ordering food from here. All the best.

Abysmal service. And rude and ill-behaved staff. I have never felt so insulted in my interaction with any other business establishment. What was supposed to be a special Noboborsho meal turned into a nightmare that left a bitter taste.
It all began with a leaflet in our letterbox with a special Poila Baisakh combo offer. As instructed I called up on 14th to place an order for 4 thalis and some extra items on the side. I was asked what time I would like the food delivered and I said around 1pm on April 15. I was told the food would be delivered between 12pm and 1pm.
The next morning I received a call from a delivery boy around 10am asking for directions. When I asked what time the food could be expected, I was told he was just 5 minutes away. Surprised, I asked why food that was meant to be lunch was being delivered so early. He said there were a lot of orders and he had been instructed to deliver mine then. I kept the phone and called up the restaurant to say that I wouldn't​ accept such early delivery as the food would go cold or could even go bad considering the heat. The reply came as a shock. I was told that I should consider myself fortunate that the food was being delivered one-and-a-half hours early. Would I be happy if my food was delivered at 4pm instead? It was as if he was doing me a favour. At this point I remarked that the shop perhaps didn't have the infrastructure to handle such a flood of orders and hence the strange delivery schedule. This time the response was even more shocking. I was told that if I wanted better I could go to Oh Calcutta and pay Rs 1200 for the same thali that they were giving us at half the price. This put me off seriously and I pointed out that it was not in his place to tell me where I should go to eat or how much I would pay there. Further, Rajabhaatkhawa had decided the thali rate on its own and should have taken into account all factors in doing so. After some argument I realised the conversation was not going anywhere and decided to accept​ the order in fear that otherwise the food really reach at 4pm. But when the delivery boy handed us the food, we found that all the food was cold. When I pointed this out I was told I could reheat it in the microwave. Somewhere along the line both the shop manager I spoke to over phone and the delivery boys let it slip that the food was cooked all night, which meant I was being delivered stale food!
On my request the delivery man took back the food, promising to deliver it by 1pm. When there was no sign of the food at 1.15, I called up the shop after several attempts (no response) and was told it was on its way. The food finally reached after 2pm. When I asked for the bill while making payment, the delivery men first said they didn't have it and then asked us to look in the food packet. I was able to retrieve an poly strip of paper where nothing was legible. We made the payment nonetheless.
Now for the food itself. The curries had spilt into the rice making it a mess and this we showed to the delivery men. We were still unpacking when they left and I told them I would contact them in case of any problem. Soon after they left we realised 1 plate of ilish and chutney were missing. I promptly called up the delivery person but couldn't connect. I called up the shop and told them. I was assured that they would send it immediately. After waiting for a while, we gave up and sat down to have the meal.
This afternoon (April 16), close to 24 hours after the conversation, I called up the restaurant to say that neither had the missing items reached nor had there been any communication from the shop. But I was totally unprepared for what followed. I was accused of harassing them ( if complaining about poor service is harassment, I plead guilty) and was told that according to their CCTV footage 4 plates of hilsa had been packed and so I had received them or they didn't know where it could have gone. This in effect meant I was being accused of lying for a piece of wish. I f I was able to pay more than Rs 3500 for a meal, I don't think I needed to fall that low for a piece of fish. Never have I felt more humiliated and insulted in my life. The phone was banged down before I could say anything further. For the next few minutes I tried in vain to call them. Both their numbers either went on ringing or was disconnected after a couple of rings. Clearly, they didn't want to take my call. Left with no choice I called up the delivery boy and begged him go let the shop know that I wouldn't even accept a grain of salt or rice from their shop. Yes I lost my cool at this point. But who wouldn't have. Never had I imagined that ordering a Poila Baisakh meal for the family would amount to such a bitter experience.Sibendu Das Achintyarup Ray Samabrita Sen Nayantara Mazumder Indranil Das Gupta Stephanie Das Gupta Tilak Shankar Mazumder

এখানকার পোস্তর বড়া অসাধারণ। তবে তালিকায় থাকা বেশ কিছু লোভনীয় খাবার কেন শুধু রোববারের জন্য তোলা থাকে বুঝলাম না। তাই এখানে যাবার আগে তালিকায় থাকা যে যে খাবার খেতে চান তা আদৌ সেদিন মিলবে কিনা তার আগাম খবর নিয়ে নেওয়া ভালো। মোটের ওপর খাবার ভালো। তবে কোনো এক অজানা কারণে একের বেশি ভাত একবারে নিলে পরিমানে যেন কম হয়। তাই তিনজনের জন্য দু বৌল ভাত নিতে হলে দু দফায় নেওয়াটা ভালো মনে হয়। আর হ্যাঁ এই গরমে এখানে কোনো ac দেখলাম না। সব শেষে বলি খাবার মোটের ওপর ভালো, পকেটেও চাপ পড়ে কম। পাঁচের মধ্যে ৩ টে তারা দেওয়া যেতে পারে।

Appearances can be deceptive!
When you see the small entrance amidst Garia Bazaar, you generally will overlook the restaurant completely or be doubtful of the quality it serves.
But the restaurant does serve some quality food and that too not burning a hole in the pocket , the interiors maybe subpar but it serves it's purpose.
I always go for take-away option, coz for me, a siesta after a hearty meal appeals greater than sitting in a dimly-lit, average interiors.
Ordered "mach er matha diye daal", "masala alu bhaja", "chitol muitha", "mutton kosha" and "dhokar dalna" . Bill came to an exact 500 (VAT and ST are not charged exclusively )
The food was prepared good, the problem being bengali restaurants all over town use the same base gravy for multiple dishes and this is done here also. Plus you'd find the things like chittol muitha and dhoka being pre-cooked and cooked in gravy when ordered. This does happen in other restaurants too and you will miss the element of freshness. But here, you won't be charged so high to have the bong pleasures which you hardly have in your home.
Albeit little stuffs like this, the food is really good, some dishes like "macher matha diye daal" will remind you of "ghorer khaoya" and you can visit this restaurant if you're fed up of the daily dose of "charapona and katapona" and want to have the bong delicacies.
 This restaurant can give other named bengali cuisine restaurants a tough competition as this restaurant delivers good food without ripping you off.

On a budget? Craving for bangali-ana? Don't want to be ripped off by other bong restaurants with exorbitant prices? Do give this underdog a visit!!

The ambience is not good at all.Very cheesy interior. The price is cheap.Not VAT is charged.Employees are not so professional.Got a hair in our first visit,and accused that it was our fault,anyways they changed it.But after that we avoid that restaurant.But after that only once we had our dinner because it was too late at night and we were hungry,we have ordered tandoori roti and chicken item, I can't recognize the name of that item.It was not at all tasty and roti was also hard.But I heard their Bengali cuisine is good as my friends who stayed in the mess they used to order from there.I never tasted it and I don't think I can dare it too because my previous experiences.May be I will try once by ordering some dishes,hope for the better.

This place has been a surprise package!
Interior is below average but don't just go by it. Food here is amazing.. Have lost my count for how many times I had paid  a visit to this restaurant!
Bong cuisine is their priority.
My favourites are : Mutton dakbanglow, Pompret preparation, Chicken kasha and Ilish bhapa.
PLEASE do try them out guys. I swear you won't regret tasting them 😉
Home delivery option is available too.
I would have been happier if they had been more particular about the neatness of their washroom. :)

My initial expectations: A small restaurant where Bengali dishes (typical Bengali lunch/dinner) would be served.

Impression upon visiting: The restaurant has a very small front facing exposure to the road, narrow welcome door. High chances you'll miss it, on such a busy place like Garia bazaar. Interiors are below average than the competition (similar themed restaurants with similar target audience). The interiors are decorated, but something just isn't right, which would eventually make you question yourself - is this place really tidy as much as it apparently looks?  Staff members were polite and food was served relatively quick.

Food: We ordered a veg thali, a non-veg thali, pabda fish curry and bhetki paturi. From here on my impressions would be highly based on the above and thus, would obviously vary from others. Rice served was not only less, it was cold, mushy and NOT white. It was creme colored, like a light liquored milk tea. Every part of the standard thali was ridiculously small in volume than which the direct competition serves. The fishes were good, particularly the paturi. 

Price: Good news, it costs almost 60% of it's direct competition.

Summary: A restaurant which is light on pocket, half in quality than similar niche.

Went to get a parcel of mutton dak bunglow and a chingri bhapa posto.the quantity is so less that even a person can not have it at upto satisfaction.nextly do they really think that people who aee going to buy food does not even know how to cook? If bengali people are taking advantage of the customers at the tike of puja,when people of all standards go for a special dinner or lunch or to have something special..some are spending an amount which they really earn after lot of struggle...then this kind of restaurants are not going to last more than a year...people visiting once would never visit..at least i would not recommend any one as I would like to convey that the amount of food they are serving at 150 is just a worthless piece of shit..3 pc mutton was a dream in dak bunglow and chingri bhapa posto was jus 2 tpsp of quantity..quality was below average.

They say when the food is good there is nothing more that u need to add to it! This place has hit the bulls eye for me on that..!!! After a very long time found a place which serves authentic Bengali cuisine matching the standards of much hyped restaurants in Kolkata at just half the price..! Excellent food! Amazing service and great location..!!! The interior is your regular restaurant, not an extra luxurious fine dine however if ur looking for mouthwatering finger licking good food don't look anywhere guys just head here! Great for hangouts and family dine outs! No special suggestions on what to try, we tried out 6 items and each one out of them turned out to be just perfect!

This place is very near to my place. I am yet to have a dine in here but have taken parcels on multiple occassions. The owners and the service boys are extremely courteous and helpfull. The food quantity is Ok. Quality seems to fluctuate. At times it is excellent and at times it is average. But still this joint is much better in adjusting Quality & Quantity along with the Price than many big "Bangali" Restaurants of the city. The only thing that is hampering its growth as One Of The Best is its location far far south of Kolkata, otherwise it has all the potential to become The Best. Will give a more detailed review once I do a dine in here.

RAJA BHAT KHAWA, the name itself is enough to crave for some delicious Bengali dishes. So, gave it a try and ordered through Zomato. The items were Shukto, Alu bhaja, Elisher matha die kochu & mutton kasha. The sukto was not up to the mark. It didn't have that elegance of sukto but a soft mild pale gravy of bitter veggies. Anyway the disappointment didn't last long when ELISHER MATHA DIE KOCHU came in between. It's a delightful kochu patar ghonto with juicy and fleshy Elisher matha. The ALU bhaja was OK. And then it's the mutton kasha full of three succulent pieces of meaty neat mutton. The gravy was rich but less oily and certainly the taste was good. I was only craving for a good chutney. May be next time I'll order one to finish their Rajokio lunch. Will surely order from here again.

Our food was delivered in time and it was too hot. The tikka kabab was very tasty and flavourful,with 7 big pieces. Liked it really. The chicken dakbanglo looked yummy,tasted good and  the quantity with 4-5 decent pieces of chicken,one potato ,one egg was enough for us. So overall a good experiance. Surely ordering next time.

Initially I have been underestimating this place because of its narrow entrance in between some shabby shops in the Garia bazar area. But the zomato reviews made me enthusiastic to get my Sunday dinner packed from this place.

The interior is completely different from the deceptive exterior. It is comfortable
enough to enjoy a lavish Bengali meal. The wall decor is quite elegant.

The staffs were very keen to help me with my order. I took Lau Pata Chingri Bhapa,mocha and rice. It costed only Rs 200/ including packing charges and the best is thing is that there were no taxes.

Lau pata Chingri Bhapa contained four medium sized prawns in a thick and tangy mustard gravy along with lau pata and were garnished with few whole green chillies. The spices were in right in proportion. Prawns were fresh. The shells were removed properly and cleaned well. The mocha was also cooked with perfection and garnished with raisins. The rice was not original basmati as they charged only Rs 30/ for it. Quantity of each of the items were sufficient enough for consumption of two.

If it was not located at one end of the city it would have given a tough competition to the well known Bong restaurants that charge us almost double for the same quality food.

I loved to have their food again and again . Few days back I ordered thru Zomato order , Bhetki Paturi, Aam Chuney, Dhokar Dalna to share with my wife together & enjoyed thoroughly . Since Nov. 2012 , I was panicked by the name of Paturi in Kolkata , b'coz I was greatly Cheated by " OH! CALCUTTA" who looted Rs. 510/-+ from me for small pieces of  Bhetki Paturi had a thin card board like Fish & huge thick layers of very strong pungent Mustered non- edible pieces & you have to leave it as it is . They never felt a regret , I'll never visit any of their Rstnts.  That fine dining standard & Bengali's Status . Where as " RAJA BHAAT KHAWA" is a boon for me . Those B' Paturi they served was the best Paturi I ever ate in Kolkata. Keep it up RBK. May God bless you . Aam Chutney & Dhokar Dalna & Echor Chigri  was simply divine . All the dishes they served were very good & well on time . I look forward to get more of other fish dishes & Veg food & matha dieya Dal. Good luck.

The interiors are cozy and clean. The food served was hot and tasty. We tried kochi pathar jhol which was cooked to perfection. The mutton dukbungalow was tasty but a little on the sweeter side. The tok dal was extremely well cooked. The best part of the meal was the desert, we tried mango kheer and pan coolfi. It could not have ended on a better note. Would definitely go back expecting for more.

Will keep the review short as my lines were said (rather typed) by @Adv Sushmita Banerjee in an earlier review.
Food quality : 4/5 -- The Kulchas could have been a bit larger in size.
The boiled egg in the chicken bharta was broken to pieces.
Delivery : 3/5 -- They failed to cover a distance of 15 mins in one hour even after calling us and getting the direction .. After one hour again we called and they said the delivery boy was yet to leave the restrau .. 
All in all food quality is average and availability of all the foods in the menu is less.

It's located near Kavi Nazrul Metro Station, Garia. 
I ordered for a home delivery through the Zomato app. 

I ordered for Normal Rice, Moong-Masoor Dal, Aloo Bhaja, Begun Bhaja, Pomfret Jhal, Bhetki Paturi, Chicken Kasha and Aam Chatni. 

Upon the confirmation of the order I got to know that they don't serve Normal Rice so I had to opt for Basmati Rice. That was my first disappointment. If you can't serve the dish, don't have it on your menu either. Then the second disappointment was that due to high market prices Pomfret Jhal wasn't available for such a low price, and I substituted it for Katla Shorshe Jhal. 

The Basmati Rice was cooked okay. The rice wasn't so fine as Basmati would've been. 

Moong-Masoor Dal wasn't cooked well but still eatable. The quantity was very much for two persons. 

Aloo Bhaja tasted great as it was cooked down to perfection. It was less oily and was very crispy. 

Begun Bhaja tasted well but it was more oily. Would like to have it less oily the next time.
 
The Katla Shorshe Jhal just tasted fine, the gravy wasn't that delicious but the piece of fish was. 

The Bhetki Paturi stole the show as it was mouth watering. It was cooked just perfectly and was delectable. Wrapped inside a banana leaf and the piece of fish was very delicious. 

The Chicken Kasha tasted good as Usual. It was a bit spicy and the gravy tasted nice. 

And lastly the Aam-Chatni was toothsome and fingerlicking. The Aam-Chatni was the second best dish after Bhetki Paturi. 

The quantity was more than enough for a person and the quality was good. 

It's a very cost effective restaurant and provided the price at which they are providing the Bengali cuisine, it's worth a try. 

Still there are some flaws, and I hope I get served better the next time.

1 Month ego I visited Raja Bhat Khawa, situated in Garia near Kavinazrul metro station (Garia Bazar Area). Bought a deal of Bengali Combo for 2 from Mydala. The ambiance was not excellent but homely. From my experience it seems to me that stuffs are new and in experience but they are trying their best.Food quality was also good at reasonable price. If you are searching for average bengali restaurant for family lunch or dinner then you can try this out.

Little area ! Price is reasonable, quantity is disgusting.
Well, this time i tried punjabi chicken bharta with butter naan and basanti pulao. As i've said before , quantity isn't sufficient at all. Serving is good though. Naan wasn't that good.

Well, this restaurant is situated from a stone throw distance from my home. Nice ambiance, nice customer service, nice food. Today i visited this place for the second time..!! Well, their kabab is superb and are reasonably priced.
Last time i tried chicken biriyani.. And tbh, i didn't like it. The Indian dishes were good. 
Overall a nice cosy place and yes, they do provide free home delivery.!! :)

I am a regular to this newly started restaurant in Garia.And mark my word no restaurant in Kolkata offer such a delicious food at this  unbelievable low price! Service is good and moreover diners are hosted with warm hospitality. Now coming to the main part ; the food. They offer both Indian & Bengali food but this place is worth visiting to smaple bengali dishes.Each and every dish will leave you satiated without burning a hole in ur pocket. They are probably the only restaurant in the city who serves some popular dishes from the kitchens of rural  Bengal like sutki maacher bharta, kochu saag, kucho chingri bora, bokful bora, laupata Mora chingri bhapa etc to name a few. Among regular dishes yellow polao and mutton dakbanglow , chingri malaikari , ilish bhapa are superb !

Newly opened A Authentic Bengali Cuisine Restaurant is this. Most Positive thing is here, Availability of variety dishes at a time.Well Decorated, good Co-operation, reasonable price, better tasteful arrangement till now.We have tasted many dishes according to their suggestion, Basmati Rice, Postor Bora, Topse Fry, Mutton Kassa, Chicken Kassa, Vetki Paturi, Ilish er  Matha Diye Kochu Sag but Shutki Varta, Chitol Muithya & Lau Pata Chingri was Superb........Mutton & others were too good also. the quantity of food is a little bit low but as the price basis its OK. Thanks to Raja Bhat Khawa....for making a Different Tasteful Sunday Lunch time for Us.

I love this eatery so much that it is frequented by me on regular basis. It serves good Bengali and Indian cuisines and the icing on the cake is that it is priced moderately. I find the staff quite hospitable and the restaurateur too is such a receptive person. So, by and large I've had a really good experience.
