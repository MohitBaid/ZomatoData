I really dont know how why and when this place happened. But it just came across my fone's screen when I was trying to order lunch for me on a Friday afternoon and Voila! I had the one of the best of Mushroom Mixed Sauce Pasta ever from a Cafe/ Restaurant. 
Quantity- way too good for 1 person
Quality- Perfectly cooked vegetables, al dente pasta and perfect sauce.
Also, they gave a bread which supposedly was a Garlic bread, however not that great with flavours. Yes the Pasta made my day! 
Sector 5 people, do order the pasta once.

Well, another new outlet inside the Bytes food court, Sector 5, Saltlake ‚Äì and another experiment!

A couple of zomato reviews by other users suggested that their Veg Pasta is a must try! Hence, opted for a dine-in of the same ‚Äì red sauce. This was served in some 12-15 minutes and looked beautiful ‚Äì full marks for presentation ‚Äì especially the cheese and coriander topping! Nice to see some chopped vegetable content also! Taste wise, however, I was somewhat insatiate! I was hugely surprised to see the pasta go cold within a minute or two after preparation!

Quantity and quality served is fine, and the complimentary toasted bread slices along with the pasta bowl made up a complete meal! Pocket pinch is on the higher end and service is fine. Since they are based inside a food court, seating arrangements etc are fine.

Overall, a decent visit!

One of the most amazing pork pizza I ever had...
It was just mind blowing...
The topping and crust were just perfectly baked.
The pork slices were juicy and crunchy.
It was surprising to have such a delicious snack at a reasonable price. Wish there were some beverages to accompany the snacks...
The only problem was being in the food court one needs to have the food card which is somewhat ridiculous.

If you want a perfect moment to call it for a day then 'Samarosa' is the best way. We had Medium sized Regular Crust Grilled Chicken pizza topped along with mushroom, onion and capsicum. Though medium sized but contains 8 pieces i.e 12 inches! üòÅ It was a delicious cheesy pizza with perfect balance of veggies and grilled chicken which will greatly tempt your taste bud.üòã Moreover, I am not going to pass out the profitable section of my review which is, this restaurant will save you a lot of bucks. And I'm pretty much confident about it. So grab along with friends and hit the 'Samarosa' in no time. ;)
