Truly one of the hidden gems of Kolkata, this eatery has been in hype recently in many Facebook foodies forum so this weekend I thought to give it a try, to see what all the hubbub is all about. And true to all the hype, Suruchee did not disappoint at all.

Ambience - It is very simple, unassuming, no fancy bells and whistles, this place has simple seating arrangement. The place was packed with people, but the staff were handling things flawlessly.
Staff - The staff, from their outlook is not like your other "uniformed-high rung-sophisticated sounding" lot, they have a simple outlook but they are true professionals. The service was prompt and everyone was courteous.
Food - I should have guessed about the food quality by judging the large number of patrons. We ordered mixed Chowmein which was truly marvelous, and rumali roti and Mutton Rezalla. The Mutton Rezalla has been one of the best I have had in a long time. The gravy was also splendid.
Value for money - As evident from the menu card, things cannot get any more bang for buck than this. No added taxes or whatsoever.

Overall, I am rating this place 4.5 for now. Although this place deserves a perfect 5. I am saving the remainder till my second visit, which I am planning to make at the earliest.

It is present in Dacres Lane. While entering the Lane I thought that the restaurant may not provide that good quality food. But I was impressed after reaching there. The service is too fast and the waiters are very cooperative. And speaking about the food I must say I have become a great fan of this place. The food quantity and quality that it provides at such a cheap cost is unbelievable. This place is mainly famous for its Chicken Stew but you will love the other items too. I beacame a great fan of the fish butter masala that they provide here.

This is such a restaurant which deserves a 5. What an amazing afternoon it was , having lunch at Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant. This place was famous for its chicken stew but now it provides you with loads of finger licking dishes. The old "Chitto Babur dokan" still exits and Suruchee is an added joint with proper sitting, which is two to three steps away and is always ready to serve you with some amazing dishes. The staffs are amazing though they are always busy but will welcome you with a big smile.

As you enter the shabby lanes of "Dacer's Lane" , walk straight leaving the old Chitto Babur Dokan on your left and you will spot it out without any problems. In case if you are new to this place you can ask the locals who will direct you. This is such a lane which remains crowded always.

Coming to the food we ordered a plate of chicken bharta which was too good , accompanied with a plate of chicken chap and Rumali Roti. Everything was so so tasty , far better than any other well decorated restaurant. Absolutely satisfied.

Just an added information , it remains closed on Sunday. But the rest of the days it's open i.e Monday to Saturday (12 p.m to 9 p.m)

Chittoda is synonymous to dacre's lane. Most of our office gatherings seem incomplete without the presence of chittoda's food. Tasted almost everything from their menu, such good food in so little price really amazed me. Great food great value of money.

I was on my longest streak of not having chicken the day I visited this place. Staying outside the city, each home town visit is special for the chance of having the food we miss almost on the same level as we get to see our familiar faces and visiting this place probably was the best thing I did for myself in a long time.

On reaching dacre's lane which is at a 10 mins distance from Esplanade metro station towards Rajbhawan, this small but organized place you'll find at the very end of the queue of roadside chai-chowmein-chilli chicken vendors serving hungry office goers, Do not confuse it with the "chitto Babur dokan" serving chai, fish fries and chicken stew, it is at a 1 min walking distance from there on the same side of the road.

Having a seating capacity of at most 30 people at a time, this place is almost always packed up and should not be of your interest if you're looking for a fancy dine-in restaurant. There are no menu card offerings, the wall-hanged menu may confuse you, but those are the actual prices which you'll see, almost none of them read a three digit number, idk how they're maintaing their quality at that pricing.

The ones who'll take your order knows almost every dish they offer inside out and you may ask for suggestions and you'll not be disappointed. Order a cup of tea while you decide on your orders and order upon arrival of your cup of one of the best teas you'll find at esplanade area and your order will be served even before you're done with your cup for most of the menu. A few items take a bit justifiable time to arrive.

Coming to the food, the one dish I wanted to write about the most is their chicken bharta. Mashed perfectly cooked tender chicken coming with two slices of almost half boiled egg and cream on the top of some holy gravy is all your taste buds deserve, the one dish which I may let to compete with my "maa er banano mangsho" and probably that will win on a few lucky days.

you're from Kolkata and haven't been to this place ? you don't know what you're missing :)

The food is always good over here. Prices are reasonable and staffs are friendly. The place is very congested but never fails to deliver. My personal opinion their mixed fried rice is the best but their biriyani and mutton kasha is also good. They still doesn't accept card payment. They have parcel system and do accept large orders for delivery to particular destination...

Went to this restaurant for the first time today..its lies near peerless building.. U have to enter a narrow Road not too decent though and after 2 minutes walk you will reach your destination. 
Coming to the food.. We ordered rumali roti, chicken bharta (was super awesome) and fish fry (did not like) 
The ambience and the sitting is not impressive 
The amount for two of us was only Rs192

The food is amazing and very much affordable.. Located in a busy lane of Esplanade, namely Dacre's Lane,  Suruchee provides you diversified cuisines and I can assure you the mouthwatering taste.. You must taste their Chicken Bharta as it is out of the world, and Chinese dishes are delicious also.. I went with someone and ordered Mixed Chowmein along with Chilli Chicken and it was yummy.. The only thing you may moan is the ambience, but provided the quality of food and friendly budget, you mustn't really complaint..

this place was in my bucket list for months ever since I joined court. finally, dropped in on 30th december, 2017 afternoon. i was ravenous hungry and craving a good homely meal. and now, i can say that i chose the right place.
ordered a mixed rice and chilly chicken. mixed rice was suggested by the waiter. it was very tasty as well as filling with ample amount of veggies, chicken, prawn and egg. chilly chicken was made indian style with 6pieces of scullent chicken coated in light batter. the gravy was a bit sweet for my taste otherwise very good. they served salad with it.
very pocket friendly, it took me 156 rs for the entire meal. quantity is huge. it was too hard to finish it off. and quality excellent, superb tbh.
the staffs are very friendly. the waiter serving me even poured extra gravy on my plate without asking me. since 'm almost a regular at their other shop 'chitto babur dokan', many staffs knew me already by face and greeted with a large smile.
ambience is good. overall a nice experience. now i am going to be their regular customer. 
only glitch is that since the area is too small, it remains crowded and many may find it unhygenic due to being a roadside shop.
but if anyone craves good food in low price, highly recommended for them

Well its year ending almost and to meet some friend i found myself near Esplanade.We were quite late for lunch.Thus we thought to visit this already famous place for the first time.This eatery is located in James Hickey Sarani or popularly known as Dacres Lane.The street is thronged with food stalls serving fast food.we were relieved seeing that this eatery had seating facility available.The speciality out here is the bread toast with Chicken stew.The stew out here is marvellous and different from any other place.We had the Roomali roti with Chicken kasa.But the other delight of the evening was The Fish Fry!!..The place is pocket friendly and the service is prompt!!..This place is truly an hidden gem in the busiest part of City of Joy..

This place is nothing short of a hidden gem. The only drawback is perhaps the ambience, as some people may not be comfortable in sharing tables with strangers. Apart from that, everything else is pretty Damn good. The service is amazingly quick and the staff are well behaved and courteous. Food comes at an extremely pocket friendly price. Had chicken bharta with rumali roti and fried rice with chili chicken here. 
Chicken bharta- priced at just 90 bucks, this dish is a winner. And highly recommended. If you visit this place, do not I repeat DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE CHICKEN BHARTA. 
Rumali roti-the rotis were warm and soft. 
Fried rice-this was pretty average but keeping the price in mind it wasn't disappointing. 
Chili chicken-the chicken pieces were succulent and were not too heavy on the coating which is a plus. Though there's room for improvement of the gravy.

This restaurant is in famous Dacres Lane.
I went there as everyone was talking about this restaurant. But I didn't liked the food there.
I ordered :-
*Chicken stew with bread :(1/5) This is the famous item on their menu. But I found it to be tasteless. The gravy was thin and there was no taste at all. I wonder why is it so famous. I personally didn't liked them but others might.
*Fish diamond : (2/5)  average.
*Egg Chowmein : (2.5/5) tasted like home 
*Chilli chicken : (2/5) average

Located near Pearless bhavan, in Dacres lane. Basically one may call it a food gali.. There are lots of street food shops along both sides of the lane. This particular shop is on the left hand side. 

If u r looking for fine dining then this is absolutely not ur place. If ur motive is to taste some awesome snacks and nothing else,then visit this place atleast once. Price is very pocket friendly. Place is congested. U may need to wait to get a table. 

I went with my friend. We ordered fish kabiraji, fish finger, rumali roti, chicken varta, mutton biriyani. I can't describe how much I loved their fish kabiraji. Fush finger was very tastyüòã. They served chicken varta with an egg on top of it. And it was superb in taste. But I didn't like biriyani that much. 
Overall nice place for experimental foodiesüòÄ

This place is located in Dacers Lane near Esplanade Mansion. It's a simple and small place with nothing much to say about the ambience. I went there with my friend. We ordered Chicken Fried rice, Mix Fried rice, Chicken Butter Masala and Dry Chili Chicken. The quality of both chicken and mix fried rice was satisfactory while the quantity was enough for us. The chicken Butter masala was very tasty. The Dry Chilli Chicken was just awesome. The service was quick and the staffs were very courteous.

Today I have visited this renowned restaurant in Esplanade for lunch with some of my friends. Location : This place is located in Dacres Lane , the typical "Food Street" in Kolkata. If you are coming from K.C.Das you follow the straight road and then take right side alley. There is a sign board indicating Dacres Lane just beside Aaheli. 
Ambiance : Nothing much to say about the ambiance of this place. Simple dining area with moderate space. 
Foods : There is no menu card served in each table but there is a big menu hanged in the wall. We chose for our lunch some of their specialties.
* Fish Fingers ( 6 pcs )
* Chicken Fried Rice
* Chilli Chicken ( 6 pcs)
Fish Fingers tasted really good. Salad was served along with the dish. 6 pieces of fingers were served with adequate fish stuffing. Chicken Fried Rice was decent in taste and quantity was enough for feeding one person. The best dish of today was Chilly Chicken. 6 succulent pieces of boneless Chicken were served in a semi spicy gravy. Quality is really appreciable. 
Service : The only thing they need to improve is the service. They must not hurry taking the plates while we have not still finished eating. It seemed quite unprofessional. Prices are relatively very cheap. Chilly Chicken 66 ‚Çπ, Chicken Fried Rice 80‚Çπ, Fish Fingers 150‚Çπ. No added GST on the total bill. 
So our today's experience with this legendary hidden gem is overall good. If you want a tummy filled meal at a lower price you definitely visit this place.

Located in Dacers lane this is one of the oldest and famous place to eat lunch at a reasonable price. Suruchee is famous for the chicken strew with bread toast, Biriyani and many more items.

Went there after 4 long years!!
It hasn't changed much in this time...
As usual, tasty foods and superb hospitality is the USP of this place!!
We had Chicken Pakora, along with salad to begin with, which were tasty yet not much oily!
Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Bharta came later..
Biriyani was succulent and Bharta was the best of the lot!! üëåüëå

Situated at the lane beside peerless bhabhan, a busy lane with lots of food hawkers..... Not a big place.... But yes full of customers.... So it's a busy place... The waiters are well behaved... The prices are very reasonable.

We ordered fish kabiraji, fish finger, chicken carts, roomali roti and mutton biriyani.
All the items were tasty ....specially the chicken varta was Awsm and the others items were also very good....

Went there for lunch today with my mother, after getting so many recommendations from all my foodie friends!!
And yes, from now wards I'll also recommend this place to others..

For the Kolkata people, Dacres Lane is not at all a new name, but for me, I have never been there before though heard about a lot..

Now coming to the ambience part! Full Office Pada! So do expect a noisy environment, no such fancy decorations,but if you are a hardcore foodie then you must visit this place.

Now coming to the main focus - #Food#

We ordered Diamond Fish Fry (5/5), the fish was literally melting in our mouths,they do provide you the fry with kasundi, tomato sauce, chilli sauce and salad, but I would suggest you to taste the fry without any sauce or salad, and then only you can understand that actually you don't need anything with this, it is just sooooooooo good!!

Thanks we had
Mixed Fried Rice (with Chicken,Egg and Prawn)
(4/5)
and
Chilli Chicken (Boneless) (4.5/5)
The quantity of 1plate of Mixed Fried Rice is actually enough for 2 people who don't have such a biiiiiig appetite (like me üòî)
Quality wise it is good, but not excellent!

Regarding the chilli chicken, it was really too good! Pieces of chicken are quite big and as a side dish, 1 plate is defined enough for two people!!

And the best part is.. NO GST!! üëèüëèüëè

So, all the foodies out there just go for Suruchi, at least for ones!!! üòäüòä

Comes down as one of the heritage eateries of the city of joy.
Serving quality food for more than 6 decades.
Stationed at Dacers lane,esplanade.
Practically existed in the stories that i heard from my grand dad.
Well never the less the taste that people found quite some years back hasnt changed an inch even.
Well tried out : Rumali roti, Chicken Rezala , Chili chicken.
Something that this place gained this name and fame from could just not be ignored by me- Chicken Stew.
Every thing i had was so good and such unique to taste.
Every bit of what i had from here satisfied me to a great extent.
Specially the chicken stew which was the best dish i had here.
This joint has produced something which will just not let me stop from coming back here again.
This place definetly gets a 'Must visit' tag from me.

Right in the famous khao gali of esplanade area, dacres's lane. Legendary place. Always crowded, but service is fast. Lip smacking food in such a affordable price. Had fish fry, chicken bharta & rumali roti..all for just 170 bucks with complementary salad. You may have to share your table and they don't have a.c section...this is the only drawback. Otherwise we had a very satisfying food experience.

I love to roam these places, where I find the real Kolkata in it's purest form. I recently heard about this place and wanted to try, but I was already full when I reached there, so I had not much place left for eating. So I ordered diamond fish fry. They told me that it's made of original Kolkata bhetki, and worth trying. It was really superb. Light, less oily and tasty. I wish to visit there again then my rating may change. My expectations regarding this place is very high

Ambience, don't consider this much, it's not a place for romance. But wait u can do romance with food.

Just go and enjoy good food.

Well if you are having a tight budget, this place is the right one for you. It can satisfy your taste buds at an extremely affordable price. Located in Dacre's lane, the decor is not so impressive.. but food quality is very good. I went there with my friend and had Chicken Butter Masala, Chicken Bharta and Rumali Roti. The food was very tasty.The service is also very prompt. A perfect joint for foodies.

This place is extremely famous for their chicken-stew & fish items like fiah-diamond-fry or Fish-Kobiraji or fish-butter-mashala, but you can try other things too.... Recommended....

If you are searching for tasty and spicy food in affordable price then this place is for you. Lightning fast service and extremely delicious food. We have ordered 1 plate chicken stew with toast, 1 fish fry, 1 plate polau and the famous chicken bharta for 2 persons and all of these have cost only 280 Rs.
What I understood from other people's orders, rumali roti and chicken bharta is the main USP of this place.

The location of this highly underrated restaurant is Dacres Lane, near Esplanade Tram Depot. We had ordered Fish Kabiraji, Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet. 
The Best was the Fish Kabiraji. It was succulent, hit and tasty. Pocket pinch is not much. Fish Kabiraji costs 80 bucks and Chicken cutlet and Fish fry, 60 anf 65 respectively. Hugely recommended.

Visited the place so many time. In the heart of the Kolkata, Esplanade, and the food lane (Decars Lane), at the end of this lane you will find it.
There are not so many items in the menu. But the foods including Biryani to Chinese like Fried Rice, Chowmin, Chilli Chicken, and the other chicken dishes like Chicken butter masala, Chicken Bharta all are very good in taste. The chicken is too soft, and not at all frozen. The service was good.
Though you will not find a gala ambience. But it is like a heaven for the students like us. As per the quality and quantity of the food the price is cheap. Just love the place.

Let us talk about one typical joint in the heart of city- Esplanade. Have you heard of the name Dacre‚Äôs Lane ? You may or may not. Now, this area is the father of all khao-gully (food lane) in Kolkata. A whole stretch of around 100 mtrs is full of street food vendors on both sides of the street,or should I say lane, and local babus from government and private offices flock them like anything. Till 1 PM, the lane remains almost empty and just after 120-130 PM till 3 PM, you have to literally push your way in- remember the lunch break timing in offices ? And, somewhere, tucked inside the lane, lies Chitto da‚Äôs shop and a more royal version (if I may say so‚Ä¶ ) Chitto da and his Suruchee restaurant. Let‚Äôs pay them a visit.

If you‚Äôre availing the otherwise famous public transport in Kolkata, the metro rail is most convenient here. You need to get down at the Esplanade metro station and follow the google location above, or if you‚Äôre technically challenged like me, ask anyone where is Dacre‚Äôs Lane and Kolkattans are famous for answering random questions. For timing, any weekday post 12 noon is fine. Shops are set up, mise-en-place is done and piping hot food are getting ready. After the lunch session is over, it goes to sleep (well almost from 4-6 PM) and again rises up after 630 PM ‚Äì but lunch time is the best timing for visiting here. And I won‚Äôt suggest anybody to go there on a sunday, any weekday is a lot better.¬†
Now, as every great story has a prelude, so has this lane. Once you start walking towards Dacre‚Äôs Lane from Esplanade crossing, on your right, you‚Äôll find few lassi shops wish ready glasses of Mango and regular Lassi throughout the year (god knows how) and that too, of quite good quality. On your way, gulp a beer mug (yes, the lassi is served in that) and keep on walking.

And finally, you reach Decker‚Äôs Lane. Now, the tricky part starts. You‚Äôll fine lots of stalls on both of your sides ‚Äì each trying to seduce you with their offering. But be strong and determined. You‚Äôve some here for Chitto da‚Äôs shop and he‚Äôs there for some 60 odd years and still going strong. Suddenly, some youngster can‚Äôt just take his place. So, keep walking. In 50 mtrs, on your left, the stall will come. Chitto da is no more. But his successor, Sandip Roy, is doing pretty well in managing the quality. Wooden benches are put on the street itself and food is served there by over-enthusiast servers- managed by Sandip babu.

As he asks for you, politely tell him, you‚Äôre going for their restaurant and be sure to spot that proud smile in his face. Your destination is a few shops away. And, while walking and cursing me, on your left, there‚Äôs Suruchee Restaurant (opposite to some suspicious looking Unisex parlors) and it‚Äôs easily recognizable. Before you start your fight to get a seat, take a few minutes rest. It‚Äôs another fight inside. Tables are almost always shared in Chitto Da‚Äôs Suruchee with complete strangers, so take a chill pill and plan to start a new friendship. 

You‚Äôre not expecting any fancy seating- right ? just some basic chairs and tables and lots of people shouting- some for placing their orders, few for taking the orders and lot over phone‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a mad rush. The menu board (yes, not menu card) is hung on your right ‚Äì take a deep breath and look at it- in disbelief. ‚ÄúAre they real pricing ?‚Äù that will be the first question in your mind and while searching for the answer, order for one Diamond Fish Fry and one Fish Roll. You‚Äôve not come alone- right ?

Orders will be served within 5-8 minutes. Ignore the rubbish salad with kasundi and straightaway attack the fry. The coating is super light and Fish Fillet is of pure Kolkata Vetki ‚Äì a damn thick fillet. Frankly, apart from Apanjan, this is one of the best in town that I‚Äôve tasted. You don;t need to utter another word- cut the Fish Roll instead. Now, I don‚Äôt understand why this gem is slowly disappearing from today‚Äôs modern Kolkata. Thin fillet of freshet Kolkata Vetki wrapping a minced fish with shrimps (slightly sweet in nature) and few raisins, is what makes it stand apart. I don‚Äôt understand how they can serve it at 70/- , but it‚Äôs pure bliss, trust me.

You can check about Apanjan by clicking here

While you‚Äôre coming towards the end, order for the main course. It should be their Chicken Stew (paired with buttered toast ‚Äì not in the menu) and start thing of what next. The stew here is like a full bodied species- thickened with mashed potato and with a proud breast / leg pice of chicken standing with few other vegetables, it‚Äôs definitely not to be missed. The toast is laden with ample butter and properly browned- delicious.¬†

And the final showstopper- there should be an array of their best offerings. Order for their Fish Butter Masala, Chicken Bharta and Mutton Kassa- maybe paired with Roomali Roti. The fish butter masala has got 3 pcs of boneless bombay vetki. The gravy is fantastic (and the sole reason for which this is recommended) but the fish is a bit over-coated. Chicken Bharta is rather fine. Maybe, not as divine as the Russell Dhaba one ( You can read about the Russell Dhaba experience here ), but pretty close. And, a note to the management, if you can please pout half-boiled egg instead of those full boiled ones, it‚Äôll take the whole dish to a different dimension altogether. Mutton Kassa (firstly, I don‚Äôt get how they can sell it at such a low price) is 3 pender pieces of mutton, with low bone ratio, tucked in a semi-thick gravy. It may not be a typical Mutton Kassa, but of the taste is spot on, what the heck ‚Ä¶ 

Oops, did I just forget to mention about their Fish Kobiraji ? Though personally, I don‚Äôt quite like the fussy eggy nature of the dish, but here, the thick vetki fillet and awesome size at a pocket friendly price always push me to change my mind. A Kobiraji lover shouldn‚Äôt miss it here.¬†¬†

The final verdict ‚Ä¶.. If you haven‚Äôt been to this place and crave for good food and food only (not ambience), forget everything and plan it on your next visit to that side of the city and you can thank me later.¬† I‚Äôve lost the bill somewhere and hence, unable to post it- apologies.¬†¬†

Bon apetit !!!

My favourite budget-dining destination. The ambience is humble and nothing to write home about. They serve good food at reasonable prices.

I have liked the Fish Diamond Fry, Fish Butter Masala, Chicken Pakora and Fish Finger here. The Fish Butter Masala was surprisingly good, complete with cream poured on top. The Diamond Fry was awesome with the cruncy breadcrumb coating and beckti fillet inside! I‚Äôve tried the Egg Noodles too and found it average. It is not a place for Chinese food.

The best value for money food joint in Kolkata. The fried rice, chilli chicken, chicken bharta, each and every item is superior in terms of taste as well as amounts‚Äã of quantity served considering the price of the food. They even provide salad without any extra cost. However, avoid trying the chicken pakora. Not up to the mark. A must visit for people looking for cheap and tasty food.

Situated in the middle of dacres lane. I have been to this restaurant for quite a number of times. Suruchee is an awesome restaurant when you are in esplanade or chadni chowk area and you are hungry and want some delicious tasty food in reasonable prices. Mixed friedrice, chilli chicken, chicken manchurian, fish butter masala and the most famous fish cutlet is a must try for everyone. Quality and quantity of the food is great and so is the hospitality of the staffs. Must visit for everyone.

Had a chance to visit this place. Located on dacres lane it's quite easy to locate. The restaurant is quite good and extremely pocket friendly. I had diamond fish fry. It was ok n d the first time I had ever had a diamond fish fry. I am a big fan of fish batter fry so the diamond fry didn't excite my tastebuds as it does.
The next dish I ordered was chicken bharta n rumali roti. The bharta was huge in portion enough for 2 people. It was really very nicely done. It's among the best bharta I have had.

Exceptionally good food at exceptionally low prices = Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located right in the middle of Dacres Lane. Very easy to locate it.¬†

I had been to Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant thrice. Though, my office is just very near to it, i never had been here before. The place is quite simplistic but don't just go by the looks, the food is quite impressive here.¬†
=====
What i had:

‚Ä¢ I have tried Chicken Bharta with Roomali Roti on my first visit here alone. The whole meal with two roomali costed me around 102 bucks. The bharta is exceptionally good and super tasty.¬†

‚Ä¢ On my second visit, i went on trying the Chicken Fried Rice. The rice made here is quite simple and what makes it more delicious is the extra fried onions they add inside it. My vegetarian friend went ahead with ordering for his hakka chowmien.

‚Ä¢ On my third visit, i came here along with a friend and tried chicken bharta, chicken rezala and roomali roti. The rezala was also quite nice but nothing beats their chicken bharta.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 250 - 600 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.)¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Good hospitality.
‚Ä¢ Tasty food.
‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced.

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Hygiene is a bit of a factor.

Been there with my best friend on a casual experience! We asked for their much known Mutton Kosha! But it wasn't left as it was around 5 pm. So we ordered one fish kabiraji which was awsome in taste & also in price! You wont get such fat,soft & fluffy kabiraji in 85 bucks. You just cant compare it with the mitra cafe or allen's kitchen one but in its price category it's the best. Along with kabiraji we also had chicken chowmein(Rs-70) & chilli chicken. Chowmein was the avg one but the chilli chicken tasted superb!! 6 pvs of succulent spicy chicken chunks for 66 bucks! Strange na!? Such interesting figure?!our total bill was 221. Afterall had a good experience at chittoda's suruchee. Loved it.
If u r running out of money but hungry like hell then its the right place for you.

This place is located in the very conjested Dacres lane just a few minutes walk from the Esplanade metro station. This eatery stands amidst many other stalls serving freshly made street food.

Happend to visit this place on a rainy afternoon foodwalk and had their fish fry and chaa.
All the items are priced reasonably and is a must visit irrespective of being a foodie or not.

Chitto Babu'r Dokan - is the upmarket version of Chitto Da's stall. The menu too changes accordingly. Instead of the regular Bengali fare it has now moved to Biriyani, Champ, Rezala, Butter Chicken and Chicken Bharta to the ubiquitous Kolkata street Chinese. The basic Bengali version is reserved for the old outlet down the road. But, they were good enough to get for us the day's special vegetable - Pumpkin and Potato with Fish Bones, Daal, Prawns Malai Curry. But, the outstanding piece was the Mutton Kalia or Kosha. Tasted the Biriyani too at the end - it was very good too - light and aromatic with very high quality Mutton. And, oh - their "signature dish" - the Beckti Fish Diamond Cut Fry. Overall, a satusfying experience for a travelling salesman.

You can find many restaurants serving tasty dishes in kolkata but there are very few who still serve the lip smacking dishes without making a hole in your pocket.Chittoda's Suruchee restaurants is one of such kind.It is easy to find.From KC das sweet shop go towards James hickey sarani or so called DACRES LANE and after few food stalls and bars you will find the restaurant on the left side.On the basis of ambience,its okay.Nothing special regarding the ambience.But once you order the food,you have to wait hardly 5-6 mins for the dishes to be served.This is the time you will feel like gobbling up all the food at once because they look so yummy.We ordered Mixed chowmein,Mixed fried rice,Chilly chicken(Boneless),Chicken manchurian ,Fish kabiraji.Fish kabiraji tasted way to good and yes,it was stuffed with sufficient amount of fish inside.The Mixed chowmein and Mixed fried rice contained prawns of optimum size and chicken was plenty.Chilly chicken gravy and pieces were very tasty,no extra saucy taste,just plain chilli chicken.Chicken manchurian was good.I will recommend all of the above dishes and chicken rezala,biriyani here.The best part is all the  dishes was less oily,including kabiraji.Loved the food here.Looking forward  to visit again.Keep up the good service.Owners and staffs  of such restaurants should always be appreciated for their continuous quality service.Thank you.

Located in Decres Lane this is the best food joint in cheapest rate.The food tastes here amazing and will surely make you fall in love with this Place.This is basically a street food joint where you can sit and have the best food without paying in tax.The place is bit stuffy if you visit in very hot weather conditions coz kitchen is at the back and the place is not air conditioned.Here you will find the best chicken bharta in town..Do visit this place once foodies.The food is lip smacking and will surely make you want more.We had a delicious meal which dint even drill a hole in your pocket.If you are running short of money and wanna have delicious meal in good quantity then this is the right place for you.. Visted for the second time yesterday again.So order chilli chicken,rumali roti,fish kabiraji and chicken cutlet.As usual the food is amazing and they have kept the service as usual superb.The best place to have the most delicious food at cheapest rate.

The best known food joint at Dacres Lane, Heaven of Kolkatan Street Foods. Offers various dishes. Chilly chicken, fish fry, pakodas along with refreshments bread toast, ghugni etc. And most of all, if you are reluctant to eat food here, have their tea atleast. Its heavenly. Been there many times and always will continue to be whenever I get around Dharmatala.

Hidden gems at Kolkata. You will get good quality food in budget price here. Restaurant is big enough to accommodate 35-40 people at a time. We visited this place to have lunch on Saturday. We ordered Fish Kabiraji, Chicken Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and Mutton Biryani. Though it was a busy hour, service was very quick. All the items were good enough according to price. I will recommend all to taste the Fish Kabiraji here. It is really good. Mutton Biryani and Chilli Chicken was also good. Fried Rice was ok. Overall good quality and quantity of food in low price.

I have been to this place almost 50 times. It is situated very close to my office. An awesome food joint at Dalhausie area, at THE DACRES LANE. They are famous for their Diamond Fry, which is a Betki Fish Fry. Biriyani is all time favourite. Also the Chicken Stew is one of the staple dishes. A very cheap place. And u won't get a table by urself. Someone is going to share the table with you if u are alone. If u are not a food connoisseur and just want the pure taste of Kolkata in a budget like our previous generations used to have, then this is the place to go to. A belly full of food for two will cost only 300 - 400 INR. Njoy and Cheers!!!!

Location:This place is located a few min walk from the starting of a small,narrow and overly crowded area just before peerless bhawan.the lane has numerous food stalls both side and the crowd is a gather of cheap as well as students and office working staffs until u reach this place which gives a better feel.
Ambience:it's a small and too ordinary food joint which is much cleaner than rest of the surrounding which gives u a good feeling after u have crossed the lane and finally reached here.the staffs are too quick and and helpful.
Food: coming to food which is the sole reason I came hunting for this place..we ordered one chkn biriyani ( 110), muttoon biriyani (120),chkn bharta(90),the biriyani was good but the pieces of meats were comparatively small and contained no boiled egg though quantity of rice was good enough,the chkn bharta deserves special mention,a real good and proved it was worth coming here.
A tax free bill came up and lit up our facesüòÑ
A must visit place to have the best chkn bharta at the cheapest rate..

In a month I visited this place twice.. Though the are is quite shabby the smell of the food around is hard to resist. 
First I went to this place with my college buddy.. Ordered 4rumali roti and a chicken bharta at the cost of 114.. The best bharta to have in kolkata...it can give competition to any big restaurants. 
The second time I visited this place after shopping with another friend of mine... Ordered 4rumali roti, a chicken bharta and a chicken butter masala @ 184.. The butter masala wasn't upto mark..
One of the most economic food joint. 
Hoping to visit this place again and again.

I first got to taste its food at a Seminar a few years back where the organisers had ordered from Suruchee. Be it the Chicken Biryani or the Chinese Fried Rice-Chilli Chicken combo, the lunch packets on both the days were mouth-watering. This prompted me to explore the restaurant; my colleague and I decided to visit Dacre‚Äôs Lane one afternoon and search for the place. The atmosphere inside was just like any roadside eatery in Kolkata, but all inhibitions simply disappeared once the aroma of the myriad cuisines came wafting by. We ordered a plate each of Chinese Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken, and.....lo! it arrived within minutes. But what actually stumped us was the number of boneless chicken portions...a whopping dozen! For a minute, we even speculated whether the waiter had wrongly noted down our order for one plate as two. Upon enquiry, we were pleasantly surprised to know that it was not a mistake; it indeed was 12! Both of us wolfed down the food to our utter glee, and left the place with utmost satisfaction :D On a second instance, we ordered its chicken biryani...this time too it was good, though I felt the oil content had increased.

An almost road side eatery which has recieved iconic status. Almost opposite shahid minar this narrow lane is the haunt of office goers in dalhousi area. Chittoda's chicken stew is a craze among foodies. We reached there a little before lunch time and ordered their chicken stew and special chicken cutlet. The cutlet was ok nothing exceptional. But the stew was awesome...light wholesome and truly deserving of its fame.

If one wishes for a tummy full of food at affordable price, this is the place. Best known for its yummy chicken bharta along with rumali roti & chicken soup with bread toast in the morning. But any other dishes are also quite delicious.
Please keep in mind that, it is a non ac restaurant and if you are a hygienic person then, it might not be the place you are looking for, otherwise one of the best places to grab a mouthful and also for your family. 
Ideal for school & college students or any office person. It is one of the legendary food outlet known by almost every Kolkata people.

After a really hectic days had dinner with a freind at Chittoda's Suruchi Restaurant, Dacre's lane. Heard about it from a friend & wanted to try it. We were really hungry, so went for chicken biriyani & chicken bharta. Food arrived on our table within 5 minutes.

‚óè Food was really good. Flavour of biriyani was soothing, quantity was enough. (3.7/5)

‚óè That chicken bharta was really delicious. It was perfect to go with that biriyani. (4.3/5)

They served us a plate of delicious salads. We loved the food. They know well what they are doing.

Price: 2 plates of good chicken biriyani, 1 delicious chicken bharta was of 305 Rupees, yeh it's true!!! Don't know how's it possible.

Don't expect good ambience, food is good, price is astonishingly low. Staffs are very friendly. It was a great experience.

This place is of nostalgia for most of the Calcuttans. This small joint is satisfying our taste buds with such perfection for ages now. Situated on Dacres Lane, which is a must for every food walk in Calcutta, always crowded for their cheap and quality food, Chittoda holds its own place. From Khichuri thali to Cha, from bread toast and Chicken Stew to Fish chop...everything is fresh and tasty. My personal favourite amongst everything is Chicken Pakora which is a famous of this place too. The workers work here from their hearts.

A very basic ambience, but pure nostalgia with good food - it's all about chittoda. They have two food joint, one is roadside eatery which is much inexpensive and proffered by middle aged office guys. But we went to the small restaurant type eatery, suruchee which is equally good. We ordered chicken strew which has a big portion of chicken with some carrots, raw papaya and beans. It tastes great with butter and pepper toast which has a thick layer of butter. Then we had tea which was again good. Over all it's all about excellent pocket friendly food, which is Kolkata speciality!

I have never seen ChittoDa, but whether you have seen him or not, he is a universal "dada" to everyone, specially, to the office goers in Dalhousie area. Long back, before ¬†the restaurant boom in Kolkata, or when a "chowmein-chilli chicken" combo was still something we longed for, Suruchi has satiated the hunger of our stomach as well as our soul. I remember those days when me and my brother, after doing Puja marketing (we were still not used to the term "shopping" then) from the Dharmatala area with my parents returned home typically after having dinner from Suruchi. Thus, it evokes a sense of nostalgia every time I pass along the Dacer's Lane. Even now, the price can't get any cheaper or food any better, be it fish fry or chilli chicken. Hygiene is compromised, but then again, who cares, when the food is good... it has a charm and aura of its own... I have been to numerous famous and not so famous eateries later in my life, but Suruchi still happens to be one of my eternal favorites....

Overall experience was very nice. The behaviour of the staff was polite. Must visit again.

This is our Saturday food joint. We have become regular on Saturdays at this place.

One of the oldest restaurants, located in the diagon alley of the food wizards, Dacres lane at Esplanade, serves all staple food choices of bengalis. Starting from fries,pakoras to chicken stew with bread, biryani, chinese.. all of these with a Kolkata touch to it. 
For this wide spectrum of food items, we get the option to choose the delicious chicken stew on healthy diet day or may be fried rice and chicken on a cheat diet day. The biryani and chicken chaap are also good. Go for it!!

The ambience is not so good, but certain facts of this outlet is exceptional, its service and food. The outlet is easy to find by google maps. We ordered Chicken Cutlet for starter, in the main course ordered for Veg fried rice and Chicken Rezala. The quality was fine and the waiters are very friendly. 
The outlet is open so not sure fully of its hygiene and the attendant spilling over a glass on my pants, asked of me not to give a five star. In nutshell, a good experience.

It is situated at Dacres Lane, Esplanade. Dacres Lane is known for foods, it is one of the best known food alley.
If you been there you will will be mostly amazed by the quality of food they are provided by that cheap prices.
But sometimes you have to share the table with unknown persons which veritably I don't like too much.

Yessss....Now, here comes the one and only Chittoda. The famous, the benevolent, the ever-constant in this changing world. Chittoda was never short of fan following of it's own.
I am making it short because Chittoda doesn't need a review. It don't require any at all. The place looks a bit clumsy, maybe very dingy at times, but food here is heavenly and finger-licking good. Our very own Bengali fast-foods like Fish Fry, Fish Roll, Fish Finger and Chinese staples like Chicken Stew, Chilly Chicken everything is available with really a non-profitable price tag while maintaining authenticity of the food itself. Try anything here, situated just opposite Raj Bhawan beside the bye-lanes of Tito's Bar.

A perfect place for office lunch and evening snacks. Located in dacres lane, near esplanade. You will find plenty of street food shop in this area. This place have proper sitting arrangements, though the ambiance is not good, remains crowded most of the time, not hygienic ¬†either. ¬†But food is freshly made and taste good. ¬†Prompt service and very much pocket friendly.

Situated in the very narrow passage of Dacres lane, this small eatery is a must try! 
Very reasonable, and delicious. Every item here is made freshly and the chaa is the best :)

Ghoogni with toast, fish items and chaa.. best combination ever. Do visit this place!

Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant is located at Dacres Lane, Esplanade.

Ambience is shabby . Sitting arrangements is there.

Staffs are very nice with prompt service.

Tried mixed chowmein and chilli chicken. Both were very tasty and well cooked. Chowmein had nice fillings. Both had sufficient quantity.

Pocket pinch is very economical.

A very nice place for satisfying hunger pangs if one overlooks the ambience.

Ambiance is not really good or hygenic. There are flies all around.
Service was very slow. The staff was good, though. We cancelled an order almost after half an hour when they were taking too long to bring it and the man didn't say a word.
We ordered a Fish Fry, a Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Kassa with Rumali Rotis, a Mixed Chowmein (which we cancelled) with Chili Chicken and a Chicken Biryani.
Both Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet was tasty. Chicken Kassa and Chili Chicken was okay. The Biryani wasn't even warm so it didn't taste good. Moreover, there were tiny bits of mutton bone and cartilage pieces all over my Chicken Biryani. Didn't like that.

Food is good enough given such cheap prices if you can compromise on hygiene. But really overrated. Deserves a rating not more than 3.0!

First lets talk about the food.
1. Veg fried rice: Too oily, otherwise good in taste and the quantity is enough for one person only. Price is cheap.
2. Chilly chicken: Good in taste. Enough for two people. Boneless pieces, 6 in number. Price, again cheap.
3. Fish fry: Just like any other fish fry. They used bombay bhetki.
Service was really good. We didn't have to wait much for the food. The people are nice here. They also offered us extra gravy to have with the rice.

While strolling along Esplanade Area, I along with my friend wanted to try this eatery out, which has kind of a celebrity status in the Dacres Lane. Reaching the door step, I found it to be jam packed and was about to leave when the cashier asked us to wait for a minute and then in a snap made seats available for us.

Getting ourselves seated, we ordered for 1 Fish Kabiraji, 1 plate of Paneer Butter Masala and 3 Rumali Rotis for both of us. The order delivery took a bit of time which is very well justifiable taking into account at the crowdedness of the restaurant.

While waiting for our meal, I observed the restaurant being a small one but possess clean tables. The basin it holds is a clean one but lacks liquid soap being present. Its staffs are very efficient, polite and always smiling. One hardly has to remind them for their order and it is served at the fastest pace possible.

Getting our food, we were amazed at the quantity of it. The Kabiraji was way bigger, the Paneer Butter Masala was provided in a big bowl and the Rumalis were of standard size. The taste of the kabiraji was really wonderful and I enjoyed it a lot. The Paneer was okayish, not very enjoyable and the rotis were brilliant.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) It is a Value for Money restaurant serving good quality stuffs. Worth a Visit!

Qs) Why have I rated them 4 stars?
Ans) Small and Clumsy area urged me to deduct a star.

Dacres lane is the synonym of the "soul of Kolkata", in the truest sense, offering awesome lipsmacking foods at unbelievable prices!! This place shows the reason to an age old saying , that there won't be a hungry soul ever in Kolkata.
I have a faint n fond memory of visiting this place when I was very young and finally here I was again with my missus, ticking, this place located in this tiny dingy goli of the office para, the holy place of street food lovers, off my bucket list!

It was a typically cool, early winter evening and we both entered the newly made restaurant of chittoda. Settled in, we ordered a chicken stew with bread toast. The chicken stew was very different than the usual , almost a very diluted jhol/curry of chicken! Bit spicy and flavoured the stew tasted yummy with the toasts. 
After that we strolled on to the original chittodas dokan/stall. I ordered it's legendary ghugni n the wife settled for a fish chop. The ghugni was extremely spicy and fish chop was nice! 
We both were on restrictions regarding the food we can eat outside or else , the hot chicken pakoras or the extremely seductive looking desi fried rice and chilli chicken were making us drool over them! 

Anyhow, with heavy heart we paid our bills n left, hoping to come back again to this place soon and gorge on rest of the delicacies .

Ps. don't worry about the money, it's almost free!

This hidden gem in the office para of the town gives you good quality food in cheapest prices!!!
So, me and my friend visited this famous street-joint and trust me, we were full to our wishes...
We ordered Mixed Chowmein and chilli chicken... Quality-wise both were good, especially the chicken... richly cooked and definitely in good amount too!
I liked the fish kabiraji also.. I felt it had a unique scent to it!!
Lastly, the service was worth mentioning... some high class restros should learn from it!!

The shredded chicken was simply mouth watering.. The service was quite good and most of all it is one of the most pocket friendly restaurant in kolkata serving delicious food....

I first ordered fish fry and chicken stew.
The fish fry was yummy but the size was too small. I have never had stew before so I wasn't able to judge it. But my friend said it wasn't too good.
Next we ordered chicken chowmin and chilli chicken.
Both were very yummy and the quantity was enough keeping in mind that the low price.

This restaurant being situated just opposite to my Ex. College, was subjected to my regular visit for lunch. Being situated in a lane congested with numerous food stalls and other restaurants, this restaurant has got a breakneck competition. Accordingly, you can expect to get a variety of foods (Chinese and Indian) at very reasonable price with good quality and quantity. Variety ranges from chow mein, roti, biryani, rice, and so on. Of course you can't expect this restaurant to compete with the big bosses, but this restaurant gives a value for money. The only drawback is that the ambience is too poor, with the sitting place often suffering from smokes from the kitchen. Overall, its a nice place to visit when you are too hungry, and your budget is too limited.

Nostalgia and throw-back to street food. Even before the uprising of popular food joints across this city, there was this place serving delicious street foods with a homely touch since time immemorial. The legacy continues till date with the same zeal and enthusiasm. Located at the popular Dacre's Lane, I happened to land up here to try their Bread Toast, Chicken Stew and Fish Fry. Topped with some salads, the Stew was a dish made in heaven. The price tag was surprisingly low compared to the quality and quantity. The disappointment was however the Fish Fry. With an elite fast food shop like Aponjon standing next to it, this Fish Fry was dry and wet, with no crispiness whatsover. Nevertheless, the entire saga was quite good. Hoping to drop in soon.

65 years ago a small street side eatery was launched which now has become a full fledged restaurant serving Chinese and Indian food. Located on the narrow alley of Decker's Lane is this untouched gem of foods. The place is not flashy, and it does not need to be so as long as the quality of food is awesome. I accompanied one of my friends to this place. We ordered chicken roll for starters and mixed chowmein, chilly chicken and fish butter masala. I know the combo does not suit but I can assure that the Indo Chinese combo did not conflict on the plate. The food was awesome and the price was very reasonable. Thank you Abhishek and the restaurant team who made my monsoon evening special.

This restaurant is Located inside the busy Dacker's Lane beside the peerless at Esplanade. There is nothing special about their ambience. Just a simple restro having little seating area available. The resto is clean inside hence you wouldn't mind to have dine in here. 
We ordered roomali roti, chicken bharta,  veg fried rice and chilly chicken. 
I had the rotis and bharta. The rotis were very large in size yet soft, so 2 of them were enough for me. The bharta was just amazing. It tasted really awesome. It comes with a egg divided into two pieces on it. 
I didn't had the Chinese items so can't tell about their taste but according to my friends they were also very tasty. Only a con was that the amount of rice they serve was quite less for even a single person. 

Love to visit here again and had some other dishes...

one of those old hotels type restaurant¬†in a busy small lane in Kolkata. Don't expect a great ambience like a big restaurant. A small shop with only 30 around seats which doesn't look like a great food place. But don't go by their ambience. Their foods are awesome and cheap. We had fish kabiraji and chicken stew with butter bread. They don't provide you any menu card. Instead there is a menu board. Foods are of heavely tatse. moreover the behavior of the staffs are good and very informative. waiting time is also very less. Stew was only 65 rupess chicken butter masala 90 rupees/plate which way more less than the any restaurant. So go there for some real good food and get the good old days feeling seating in a 4 chaired tables with fan over your head as no AC is there.

i believe that one should never dare to call yourself a foodie if u haven't been here in Kolkata. this is paradise. one better than the other. none that u can say no to. none that u can afford to miss. start with the stew variety and fish fry. continue with the ghoogny and the rest. this is a foodie place. just enjoy that. no great ambience. not even a proper seating. but what you get is a remarkable feeling and experience. only problem i face is lack of a parking space. but that's it i guess.

Not actually a family restaurant to dine in. But absolutely a pocket friendly restaurant with top knotch food. Seating arrangements are okayish. Mixed Chowmein along with Chilli Chicken turned out to be tasty. The fish fry was heavenly just. Quantity and quality of the delicacies are good too. Just the location is a bit difficult to find. The bad thing is that the waiters demand for tips. Otherwise, recommended.

Chittoda is a popular name among the office goers of central-Kolkata. And Chittoda's Suruchi Restro is an iconic food joint famous for its cheap-but-good-food with an old-Calcutta charm. Tucked inside the "tiffin para" or the iconic Dacres lane off Esplanade and a few shops away from the "actual" Chitto-babu's shop.

This non-AC food joint has a very minimalistic decoration and quite humble in appearance. Every time I went there, I found this place crowded with every tables full. But during rush hour , it becomes way too much congested to eat your meal properly. So if you are planning a visit, avoid the lunch or tiffin time.¬†

Unlike Chitto-babu's shop it serves many more other than only fries. It has quite a range of items in their menu-board (well, I never saw their menu-card, they have a board displayed in the wall with the list of dishes they serve)- ¬†from fries and chops, to Chinese, to North Indian and many more. In my recent visit this week I ordered their famous chicken stew with rumali roti and fish fry. The stew was very tasty with big chunks of papaya and carrot in it. The chicken piece was big in size but mostly bony with less meat in it. One can taste the excessive butter in the whole preparation. The roties were soft and went good with the stew. But, the fish fry stole the limelight. It was crisp outside and soft Betki fillet inside and was served hot with salads and mustard sauce. It was so good that we ended up ordering another one immediately. In another visit last week, as I was in a hurry I could only manage a Fish Kobiraji. It was quite big in size but was a bit too oily to my liking. It was tasty, however. The fish was soft and properly spiced but certainly not Betki . The staffs were quick and friendly.¬†

So, if you are up for some quick meal around Esplanade and do not want to spend a lot, this place can be it. But for hygiene-freaks think twice before you enter here cause you can end up yuck-ing. But, truly it's a "Hidden Gem" in Kolkata-food -scenario.

This is one of the old Calcutta eateries tucked inside the narrow lanes of the Office Para, which also happens to be my office area. So for many small celebrations in office, we get boxes from Suruchee. The Fish Fingers are brilliant here. The food might not look super-fancy here, but the extraordinary taste more than makes up for it. I also totally dig their Roomali Roti - Mutton Kosha combo, which brings back memories of old celebrations at my place, where it would be a regular feature.

This restro is definately made for the students and the officials cause of the place it is located !! 
Ambience is ok inside but the location of this restro may be killing a lot of couples and family goers !!
There is one waiter rather i'll prefer to call him uncle he is really nice !!
It's very pocket friendly food is all good according to the price !!
If you are wandering around esplanade and you're hungry but you don't got much money you can opt to come here !!

Been there for 2-3 times during my High Court internship days.
One of the cheapest and tastiest restro at Decre's lane. 
I had their chilly chicken, chicken bharta along with rumali ruti.
The food is the most delicious of all.

(No! Don't look at me like that!! If you are really wondering the reason of rating this place a 5, Please scroll down and read the review)

There are some places in the 'city of joy', that takes you back to the time when it used to be CALCUTTA, not KOLKATA. And one such place that anyday deserve a standing ovation for sure is Dacres Lane, a narrow dingy lane at Esplanade East.
Named after Milner Dacres, the then collector during the British reign, this lane is more than 200 years old, and used to be a place to eat for sailors coming from various parts.

Time passes by, but some traditions remain the same, and continued accordingly, no matter how fanatic the pace of the modern day citylife turns with time. And that's the way, Dacres Lane has been a pioneer place for grabbing some delicious bites, specially to the office goers of the area since ages. Even today, it is often termed as 'Mecca of street foods', by connoisseurs and aficionados.

And the legendary stalwart, that keeps the pride of Dacres Lane glowing with all of its shine is none other than, one and only "Chitto Babur Dokan"
Yes, this small eatery at Dacres Lane has been catering to its patrons since ages, and even today the shop remains crowded most of the time, a huge chunk of the crowd being regular patron since years.

If you are in Kolkata(or a resident here), and not tried this yet, perhaps you don't know what you are missing out. The beautiful aroma, the delicious taste and the historical legacy, altogether makes an experience worth remembering, every time you visit this shop. In fact the deliciously delightful taste of the food and its addictive aroma is more than enough to make you a fan of this place.
So, just forget about ambience, forget about classy decor and indulge yourself in the ocean of some heavenly taste.

And to conclude, I must say that "Chitto Babur Dokan" is one such pioneer which cannot be estimated/valued/rated on the basis of ambience, decor and hospitality. It is a vintage destination which contributes to a part of the history of this city to keep it alive and glowing. So it should be estimated accordingly.
A must visit for all the foodies out there.

A sudden idea to have lunch in chitto da's dokan & it was proved right. Though I am not a street food person But heard a lot about this place. Ordered chicken stu with bread. They served quickly and it was just yummy. The food was healthy too. The behaviour of the staffs are also really cordial. I will surely hop in again.

The place is just beside Peerless Bhavan. It is located inside a narrow Lane which can be definitely described as the "food street". There are so many vendors and even small restaurants on both sides of the lane. I had heard a lot about this restaurant and also checked zomato to see it was one of the most highly rated restaurant in the Esplanade area. You will not be impressed with the decor nor the ambience. It is a very small restaurant with maybe a capacity of 30 seats. The place is highly chaotic as mostly the office goers have their food there. We got an empty table at the corner of the room and as we were 2 people we were asked to sit on the same side of the table so that if more people come they can accommodate them and hence we will have to share our table. There were few foreigners too having their lunch which published the reputation it had in bold letters. As we were in the mood for having some Chinese we ordered mixed fried rice and chilli chicken. They took around 15mins to serve was which was really prompt. The fried rice was really good with properly cooked rice and the other ingredients. The chilli chicken was also delicious. The chicken pieces were soft and properly cooked. The amount of Friedrice was enough for one. The thing that really touched me that their staff though not trained like 5 star waiters but they take very good care of the customers. Every 10mins the waiter came and asked me " r kichu lagbe sir". Which felt really good. I never had to ask for the glass to be filled with water as they did it spontaneously when it got empty. Overall a very good experience for me. Though the food is very very cheap but taste has not been compromised at all. I would definitely like to taste their Indian cuisine and update the review later. A must visit

Today I visited the famous Chitoo Babur Dokan(Chitto Babu Shop) in Decades Lane Kolkata, again . Ordred the evening snakes. It was the Gugni Pauruti (Bread with Gugni), Mutton Chop and Tea. I found the bread is not so good enough it became a hard. When I made a bite the crunchy sounds became irritating the person seating beside me, but Gughni was so good and testy. I liked it. Rs17 for 2no Bread PCs and 1no plate Gughni. It's cheaper and quite havy food for evening in my  point of view. The next item was Mutton Chop. Name was appropriate why? Because if you cut the Chop in to the 4 to 5pcs you find Mutton keema in your mouth in every bite. Pur ( inside mixture) was good , the Chop was not spices, fried as per requirement. Rate was so cheap 20rs/PC. Last but not in the list was the Tea. Had my evening refreshment with only 42rs. Chitoo Babur Dokan Jug Jug Jio.Love You.

My mother says if you do not get any food in Dacres Lane, that's probably not available in Kolkata. From momos to biryani including food for a jaundice patient, you would get everything at this lane. Chitto Babur Dokan is one of the jewels in this food crown of Kolkata.
Mainly known for the stews and cutlet, this place is running since ages. The stew is very different here. It's best devoured with Roomali Roti or Paratha other than the continental bread thing. Also love the Chicken Kabiraji Cutlet here. A must visit. Happy Dining! :)

From fish frys to chilly chicken, you should try everything. They have the best hand to serve you the best which will take your taste buds on cloud_9. Do not underestimate this place because of location. Just go for it. Highly recommended...!!!

Searching this place was a trouble job as I confused peerless bhavan with peerless hotel. My bad. After getting proper directions, we landed up here. It is located beside peerless bhavan, adjacent to KC Das in espalande crossing. The lane and the restro from outside will not impress you by looks. We were 2 people and got a chair, sharing the table with 2 other people. I had heard so much about the stew here and ordered for chicken stew, chicken bharta, rumali rotis. This is a small congested place with chairs stuck to the next chair behind. It was full house and people were waiting outside too. Our order came within some time and boy, what great taste it was. But wait, the bharta looked awesome as well. Taste is great for both products we tasted. Pricing is highly affordable. Quantity is enough for 1 person. The waiters are okay and can guide you if you want suggestions. There is no menu on table but on the wall.
My only disappointment was the waiter gave a wrong bill amount ( we too did not verify being in hurry ) increased by some rupees and on top of that we paid some tips. Tips is a custom here.
A must visit.

Well this place need no special mention. It's one of the hidden gems of Street food in Calcutta. Everything on the menu is well prepared and lip smacking. They make great butter toast and Chicken stew. I am a big fan of their Tea.  Fish fry, Chicken Cutlet, Vegetable Cutlet...all are darn tasty. Plates, cups and saucers are unhygienic though. But then it's a street food of India. You can't expect a fine dining.

A real hidden gem in kolkata..perfect example of a value for money hotel..The food quality and taste is just awesome.. even better than shits of some so called reputed mughlai restaurants. The price is of 60's kolkata and the taste and quality of 2016...For example ...a plate of chicken rezala, 2 rumali rotis, a plate of chilli chicken (6 pcs)and a plate of veg fried rice=guess what???It's INR 180 man...yes u heard it right INR 180.Place is very clean and the waiters are really gentle and provide excellent service.Plz don't 4get to give tips to them as they really deserve it ,(though it's not mandatory. ..)Plz every body give it a try. ..

Chitto Babur dokan is something that really worth a story to be tell about it.... I know about this place since my childhood as my father used to take me there every time while travelling to my uncle's house... I loved their crispy toasted bread and omelette, fish fry, ghughni, fish finger almost everything but the chicken stew is worth a try, 4.5/5 is what I will give it... Light yet tasty, but it's a shop on a busy street so ambiance is 0 but service is
 fantastic they will help you out to choose the dish you want... It's a famous shop at Dacres Lane... And famous as office para's Chitto Babur dokan where you will see the college students, Office employees, traffic police everyone having breakfast or lunch...

I don't care about hygiene if I get food that is as authentic as it gets. Visited this place a year back after a bad experience of having morning momos at Territy bazar. It was 9am by the time we reached and even by then they have bread baked till crispy brown with butter and suger, half / full boiled eggs and tea ready. We heard people complaining, "Ki! Akhono ghugni hy ni? Tahole Khabo ki?", however the tone was not at all that of a complainant. It was that of a "bhagne" in "mamabari" doing "abdar". How they move about in that small shop to churn out such wonders is a feat in itself.¬†

I wont talk about the taste of food available here. Because I know those who are going to read this review after searching about this place in zomato has already been to this place and know the taste,

It was sort of food exploration with the help of zomato. Upon entering the busy Dacer's lane I was totally clueless. There were shops on both sides selling every kind of Street foods from tea and toast to nun to chowmein. It is a bit difficult to locate the eatery. I took help from locals. This is not a place for family dining. And good ambience and decoration are not expected here. It is only for gastronomic reason and chittoda's restaurant delighted me. First I should mention the special Fish fry (not in menu), it was out of the world delicious. It had generous amount of fresh fish inside it. Chicken stew was another hit. The staffs are very helpful. One of the staffs greeted me so nicely as if I am a regular there.
Recommended for having snacks in pocket friendly price (if you are energetic enough to locate the eatery)

My full family makes a point of visit this same, amazing place every year.
Inside a byline beside peerless offices. This place is surely not a place where you can expect a very good looking dinner. But one thing you can surely expect is amazing food.
Everything here is served with 2 bread pcs.
The mutton kasa and chicken kasa with bread is sensational! A must try. Fish finger and fish fry are great sides. A place where you can eat till you drop without a pinch in your pocket.

The famous & soul of kolkata's one of the most popular food joint located in the iconic dacre's lane of esplanade,chittoda's restaurant delivers some of the kolkata's favourite food varieties starring from fries to biriyani to chinese & what not. So today after office i decided to visit this place to avoid the crowd rush.

The time i went there it was empty so getting a seat wasnt a problem. I decided to try something light & hence i got myself the following:-

1. Fish fry- Medium sized crispy coated with masala mixture & a pure bhetki fillet inside. The fish fry was nicely made although the masala fixture overpowered the taste but the fillet was fresh. I found the item to be okayish.

2. Chicken cutlet- Thick in size,the chicken fillet was nicely marinated in a spicy masala mixture which i found it to be very appetising. The cutlet was spicy & hence suited to my taste. Recommended

The above 2 items only cost Rs100. The helper over there was very attentive & his service was super efficient. So the experience left me wanting to come for more & i will be looking forward to visit this place even more.

Chitto babur dokan is the hotspot for office goers in the Esplanade area.Ask anybody in Esplanade area on where they are¬† going to eat after their office hours.The answer is unique-Chitto babur dokan in Dacres lane.I have visited this eatery three times till date.It will¬† not score big in the areas of ambience and overall environment but it will certainly get full marks when it comes to the quality of food and service.The quality and value for money of this store are beyond amazing.I have tried their butter toast,chilli chicken and chicken pakoras.The prices are cheap but the taste is so damn good.The chilli chicken and butter toast have a love story which has been probably made in heaven.The chicken pakoras are delicious.I will visit this eatery again and again.

One of the best street food shop in Kolkata. A busy and buzzing place in the afternoons. This famous office-para shop, has many accolades to its name. Those who know it, know the value of this shop. Excellent food quality, from bread/pakoras/chilli chicken to stew or fish rolls, all have a beautiful flavor of its own. The only downside is the place is a bit unhygienic and unclean, but if you can look over the same, I guarantee you, one of the best food items can be tasted here at affordable costs. They even started serving Khichuri now!! #ChittoBabu'sDokanHat'sOff!!

Sums up a street eatery in the most appropriate manner. The shop in actually a semi kitchen, the owner / manner sits on a high stool with cash in hand and the customers sit on the opposite side of the lane, on benches lined up against a old Red brick wall and there is a tarpaulin cover on the top at one end..... Seems like a story!! 

They serve toast and bread with stews and liver curries, and great fries with bread crumbs like the cutlet, fish fry, fish rolls et al. My pick is toast and liver curry and fish role. And last but not the least, the tea served in porcelain cups, typical Kolkata Bangali chaa. Terrific place.

Saw the 4.2 rating and decided to give it a visit! Located on a rather congested lane in esplanade, you're not really going to like the ambience as you walk to the place. The whole getup of the restaurant is also not going to please you. But then, it's located on a busy office area, so ambience is not really what one should have in mind while visiting it. And when you taste the food, you'll know what all the rating was for! We ordered biriyani and it was great - not too spicy, not too oily, just how I like my biriyani! And the quantity the serve is also more than one can ask for! It's after a very long time that I had such good biriyani at only 100 bucks!

One of the oldest eateries in Kolkata. Dekers lane. 
I have tried chicken stew and fish roll. 
Chicken stew accompanied my bread toast. Tastes great. Just dip the bread into the stew and voil√†. 
Fish roll is a must try. 
Mutton is also good but couldn't try it as it was Thursday and they dont prepare mutton that day.but rest are a bliss. For a foodie. Sitting area is a bit clumsy. Road side.

Two years back my office was in this area. So being a regular in this area made it a delight to work. As everyday I knew that I am going to dig into some "oh-so-delicious " moments at Chittoda's. This place is a Legend. It finds a royal place in Kolkata's history of office para. Must tries is a long list. I would suggest you to go and discover your favorite. My favs are chicken stew with some nicely toasted bread,fish fry and cutlets and their aromatic tea. At suruchi restaurant you can gorge on chowmein and chilli chicken or roomali roti with chicken chaanp.

This place is and always will be in my heart. It's a food lovers Paradise. Located at the food Street of Kolkata and they offer city's one of the greatest fish fry and chicken stew. The stew is lite and delicious with tender chicken pieces and you can always ask for a second helping of stew, believe me, you will want to. They also offer fantastic chicken bharta, mixed fried rice, chilly chicken. 
Now the most important thing is the staff. They will treat you like family. They will take care of any of your queries and make you feel very comfortable. 
Lastly the price, quantity and quality may shock you. If good food is all you want, don't miss it.

After a long afternoon of hunting around Radhabazaar area for the perfect pair of sunglasses;hunger hit our purchase-happy tummies and on my dad's recommendation, we visited the renowned Dacres Lane in anticipation of a delightful lunch. Dad took my mom and me straight away to Suruchee,we sat and ordered. As soon as the food arrived,I fell in love with it,even before tasting. Dad had chicken stew with butter toast- he said it was delicious. Mom and I shared chicken fried rice and chicken bharta, both dishes of plentiful quantity and superb taste.Chicken bharta was garnished with cream and cost only RS.75,just imagine! The staff was polite and helpful,and the eatery is nice and clean. Pocket friendly and delicious food! I plan to visit here again and again.

Amazing experience at Chittoda's Suruchee restaurant. We (a group of eight people) had gone on two successive days and the food was god level on both occasions. I especially liked their mutton keema matar, chicken bharta, chicken stew and the chicken cutlet. Ambience is okayish but the food is out of the world and for that price too!

Nothing can beat chitto ... the quality.. the value for money.. Try a simple toast or ghugni or vegetable chop... chitto is the undisputed leader in kolkata street food. the fish fry or chicken cutlet is also great. Try the chicken stew and bread toast.
they have recently introduced 5 course lunch at Rs20/- consisting of khichdi, tarkari, chatni, payesh and papad. Its served hot and is very tasty. They may try for the world's best value for money lunch for this thali.

I infact benchmarked chitto with another joint at old postoffice street .. when i had toast from within half hour from these places.. chitto is fr superior.
I keep visiting chitto whenever i get opportunity.. ¬†Its a part of Kolkata's heritage.. Every Kolkatan should try chitto atleast once

Would prefer some hygienic place rather than this Outlet but gave it try out of nothing... Staffs were okay.. Menu options seemed quite good though of the authentic types... Ordered Chicken Diah with Rice and was impressed with quantity... Quality can be a bit better though it's better from other such outlets... Overall good experience..

The best of the best street food that kolkata has to offer. This place is famous for ages and unlike others havent fallen from grace with time. Located at Dacres Lane bang opposite to kolkata traffic police headquarters this place is famous for its butter toast, chicken stew, ghoogni, fish fry,fish finger, chicken cutlet and pakoras. Price is decent enough. A must visit if you want to grab a taste of kolkata s street food. Statutory warning: forget hygiene and enjoy.

Want to taste pieces of sheer happiness ? Chitto da's chicken pakoda is surely what you need to have! I have never tasted chicken pakodas better than what they serve! The place may be small, not fancy. But do not judge the place with its cover! It has a lot in store for you . From the bread and ghugni till vegetable chops and chicken pakoda , Chitto babur dokaan provides you with a tummy full of happiness without even putting a pressure on your purse. Go ahead and munch on! Take your friends along! After all, khushiyaan baatne se hi toh badti hain! ;)

Office people do get hungry. They also need good food after the whole day of work at the same place. Where Chittoda's Restaurant located at the office locality of Dalhousie is most popular among them.

Location : From Esplanade K.C Das you need to go to the Peerless Bhaban & find the dirty congested Dacres Lane. Over there you will find a lot of street food shop & people having those food sitting on the benches over there. Go deep & you find the Chittoda's Restaurant.

Decorations : Old fashioned Calcutta style, not furnished, not air conditioned, no special lightings, no wall arts. This is exactly how a typical office area restaurant should be, where those things doesn't matter at all to the office people. You don't wanna date someone over here but you will come over here alone or with friends to satisfies your foodie needs.

Staffs & Management : Manager to staffs behaves good with the customer & takes care of them well. Although it is located in a congested dirty lane, they keep the restaurant clean as much as possible.

Foods : Got the chance to taste their Fish Fry only. Hoping to taste other dishes later on.

Fish Fry : Pure deeply steamed fresh soft juicy Vetki fish found inside the crispy fried layer of the Fish Fry of Chittoda. It tasted pure & unique compared to other restaurant. The exactly needed fried & the taste melted in the mouth that felt really really good. Overall an authentic taste of fish fry that Chittoda offers.

Pricing : Although there is not a much of dishes available like you get in a Chinese restaurant but every dishes available here are decently priced to the lower end & satisfies the quality for the price you pay for it.

Conclusion : This hidden gem is a must try if you only care about foods quality & not much about ambience of the restaurant. Not only that with the very decent pricing & excellent quality food it becomes one of the best regular option for foodies in Esplanade area.

It is really a hidden gem. It's little hard to locate the restaurant. But with the help of local people we reached there. It was the lunch time and the restaurant was full. The staffs were courteous. We had seat and ordered fish finger, chicken biriyani, rumali roti, chicken bharta. The food was very good and pocket pinch was low. I would recommend this restaurant. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Again visited this restaurant. It is always over crowded. However, got seats after waiting for 10 minutes. We ordered chicken pakora, chowmein and chilli chicken. Quantity was good. And the taste was also. And comparing with the price the taste was amazing. I would love to revisit this restaurant again and again.

This place is a gold mine. The surroundings of a mine is never pleasant but what you get out of it is priceless. I like to visit this place whenever I can. I like almost all their options, but my favourite is the fish roll and tea.¬†
Last visit was on 21-Jan-2016. It was a post lunch visit, so I only had tea. I have never tasted tea like what they make. Only Rs.5. ¬†I had tea at Balwant Singh, Sharma etc etc.. but no one can beat CHITTA da. Long live.

This is an awesome eating joint..  The ambience is nice, neat and clean not something to be too much, I took chicken rezeala, romali roti and green salad, the chicken was one of the best, without using too much spice, you can eat daily..  And the meal cost me only 90 bucks which is surprisingly cheap..  If you want a decent meal, not a fancy one to impress girlfriend but to impress a real food lover and your hungry stomach, give it a try you should like it..  


PS- the whole Lane is filled with hidden diamonds like it..

This is not the first time I visited but this food joint is nostalgic for me. Foodies will definitely love their Chicken Stew. Decade after decades Suruchee is serving people with their quality and homely gestures. It is pocket friendly also. The main reason I love the joint because of their fresh foods. From my childhood I never saw him serving foods casually. They are very well behaved towards customer and often it's a natural tone that their all foods gone finished. Now it's your turn to be Chittoda's guest.

One of the fabled places of Dacres Lane, the food heartland of Esplanade, Chitto Da's is known across the city for its Chicken Stew. So naturally that was the first item we ordered on one of the food walks during my visit. The stew was simple and traditional, with papaya, carrots and beans, and tasted light and hearty. We enjoyed it with bread.

We also ordered for a Chilly Fish, and that was great too, especially for the very moderate price. This is not a fancy place, situated in a lane full of food stalls. Go there looking for tasty food, and nothing else, and you shall have light!

This place is located in the heart of Dacres lane.I visited this placer after seeing it on Zomato's 'Hidden gem' collection.I had gone to Esplanade so i thought i should give it a try.
Upon entering Dacres lane i saw a line of shops on both sides selling every kind of street food..from naan to chowmein to lassi..It was a food lover's paradise almost.Without wasting any more time i headed for the restaurant.At first sight the restaurant didn't seem to be much.Cramped sitting and all..I went in,took a seat,saw the menu on the wall and ordered a plate of mixed chowmein and chili chicken..The service was fast..On tasting the food my mind completely changed..The food was delicious..And the quantity was really good..
The bill was only 130(70 for the noodles and 60 for the chicken)..I was really surprised to see such a food joint offering such good food at so low costs..
After that,whenever i visited Esplanade i made sure that i had something from this place..
All of their items are good..
A must try is their chicken bharta,rezala and stew..
The fish roll is also not bad..
If u still haven't been to this legendary place u are really missing something..

Situated in Dacres lane,this place may seem like an ordinary joint but trust me,their food is quiet awesome compared to the quiet affordable prices on the menu.went with few frnds on christmas,we ordered chilli chicken&paneer butter masala with rotis,chicken cutlet..nd tea to wrap up the meal.Must say their chicken cutlet is one of the best I have tried in that price.highly recommended if you are near the  area.Now making it 5star on my second visit when I gave a try to their Fish Kabiraji,which I personally felt to be one of the best in town

The place was little crowded as it was lunch time...we managed to find a table for us and ordered Roomali roti & Mutton Kosha.Roomali was so soft and mutton kosha was sooo delicious.Mutton pieces were very well coocked and soft and it melting in mouth.Waiters were very well behaved and friendly.Last but not the least the restaurant is very pocket friendly.I would love to visit again.All total it was a great experience and would love to recomend all of you to visit this hidden gem of kolkata...

What better than chittoda's suruchee restaurant...It was crowded, but the waiters were very helpful in finding us a seat... We took rumali rotis and chicken bharta... The chicken bharta was too good with an egg and cream topped, the rotis were warm and soft.. And what's appealing is that they provide extra gravy and salad free too.... I also brought fish fry home... It was very good too.. Service was good and the restaurant is stomach as well as pocket friendly üòä

I read all the reviews about this joint and I knew something was missing..... Nostalgia. Today, my review will be more than just an evaluation of ambience and plating and courteous staff. Its about the effect that this eatery has on the lives of people. I still remember visiting this place as a kid,with my grandfather and having a fish cutlet which I found to be spicy. Today chitto babu isnt there, nor is my grandpa... But what remains is memories, a small eatery in a crowded lane with hawkers calling out to people, the distant sound of a tram passing by, the rush of the office goers,the stew and bread toast, the chai and the adda..... This is Kolkata, and may it forever be the same. Cheers.

I used to come there with my friends & my brother after Mohun Bagan Match right from Maidan in 1960 for Tea & Ghugni+bead Toast, amazing & true the taste of both & Stews are still same Even today ¬†in 2015, unchanged ! How is it possible ? How a street food shop can maintain ? It's a great wonder. They must having the Food Magic Wand! I travelled various places of India & abroad , without exaggeration I should always have the question in my mind about quality. Most of the celebrating Chefs of India like Sanjeev Kapoor, Ravider Brar, Aditya Bal are among many & they had their bite & gave their opinion positive. Such is the reputation of of Chitto Da's Shop. All these at very reasonable price.

One of the hidden gems of Kolkata. Ask any office goer in Dalhousie where he goes for lunch, and 99% chances are the answer will be Decker's Lane. The humble 
Chitta dar or Chitto babur shop offers varity of snacks items. The fish fry is superlative in taste. So is the fish finger and mutton cutlet. The stew here is a very light concoction with vegetables and chicken. The ghugni is tasty. It is really a roadside shack, you will stand here to eat. It is absolutely pocket friendly.

My dad works in Peerless so any visit to his office is marked by the chicken stew from Chittada's dokan and a fish fry parcel for back home. The food is top class. The vegetables are fresh, the chicken is well cooked and the stew is super tasty. The fish fry is also superb! I just love this place although the sitting arrangement is not quite comfortable but I guess it has its own charm. I would definitely go back to eat their and also recommend others to try!

It was very warm last Wednesday and me wanting to eat light was passing by Raj Bhawan.
My initial plan was to go to Blue Poppy to get my stew fix but then the smell and the sights of Dacres Lane made me in.
Mom and Dad were regulars here and they'd asked me to try the stew at Chittoda's. 
It's located very deep in the lane and for once I thought I'd get lost and never find it.
The place is open, airy and filled with the chatter of office men and ladies doing a fast lunch.
Sitting was really cramped, and I don't have an idea how a healthier person might fit into those chairs.
I ordered the stew and buttered bread.
My stew came in five minutes, the toast a couple minutes later, accompanied with a small mound of salad.
The stew was of the perfect consistency, milky, brothy flavourful goodness. It'd a huge piece of fall-off-the-bone tender chicken, papaya and carrot and beans and was so comforting. The buttery, crisp toast dipped in the stew and a bit of the chicken...wonderful it was.
The server was so very helpful and attentive, despite me being a solo diner, providing extra tissues, chili and water without even letting me prompt, and so fast. 
My bill came to ‚Çπ72 INR, and I must say its worth its fetch, and much more.
I am definately coming back here!

Pretty popular among the people who's office is around Dalhousie or Esplanade. It's a restaurant with most ordinary get up but offers very good Indian dishes and most important, at a very cheaper rate. You must try their chicken bharta or chicken butter masala...very tenderly cooked chicken with graevy and I m sure that you will just love it.

Came to know about this place and its good food from one of my and one day to explore that, came here. Its located a little bit inside from the main road and esplanade crossing. The nearest landmark is beside LIC building. The approach lane for this shop is very dirty and like a typical street food lane. But the shop is clean and well maintained. The tables are clean and staffs are always available to take your order and you don't have to wait. If you are new, they will also suggest and guide you with food selection. Their behavior is also very humble. I went with a friend and just to try out, we ordered a chicken cutlet and Chitto da's famous chicken stew with bread toast. The order came within 5 minutes and it was hot. The cutlet was good to taste but i just loved the chicken stew, it was just awesome. Later we also ordered a fish fry, which was also very good but we was so eager in eating that forgot to take a picture of that. Will surely upload the pictures of all the food i'll order next time, when i'll go there next time to eat.

Awesome bang for the buck restaurant. You will find typical office para crowd. Mouth watering dishes served humbly and at a very modest price. Chicken  bharta was really good. The seating arrangement is little cramped ( hence 4 star )

Don't go by the reviews. I went there about a week before. 
OVERHYPED
NON-FRIENDLY STAFF
Staffs were so non friendly that they will ask you for tip even if you have a cofee. And the food they serve is okay. But nothing special in it to be categorise under HIDDEN GEMS.
Please don't go by the rating's. I was fooled too.

It is situated deep down in Dacres lane. It is small clumsy place and Non-AC. Amazing food at pocket friendly prices. The workers there are also very good. We had Veg.Fried Rice with Mutton Kasha. I simply loved its gravy. Next we ordered Mixed Fried Rice with ¬†Chicken Butter Masala. This place is really a Hidden Gem. Definitely coming back for more. :)

I have always heard of Daecrs Lane.  So was always curious to go there.  So one day for lunch I went there.  The lane was disappointing and was very shady. I was about to leave when I saw this restaurant. It's a a non air-conditioned outlet with seating arrangement for around 50 people.  You don't get a table to yourself. You have to share it with others.  I sat there and an old waiter came and greeted me. He told me to try chicken bharta and rumali rotis. I ordered the same.  The service was prompt and my food arrived.  The chicken bharta was topped with a boiled egg and cream. It was the best chicken bharta I ever had. The roti was tender.    Amazing food. And it was very cheap. The bill was 110 including one soft drink.  I am definitely coming back for more. Highly recommended. It's one of the few old places that is still worth the hype.

My boyfriend took me to this place after his little research on old gold eating joints in kolkata.
We started with their fish fry and chicken stew with bread.
The fish fry was crispy outside and soft within. It was fresh. The taste of the fish was great. It was served with kasundi and salad.
The chicken stew was light and tasted awesome. The chicken piece was very soft and delicious. It contained beans, raw papaya and carrot. All cooked very well and were very tender. It was served with two slices of toasted bread.
The next items that we ordered were mutton kasa and chicken bharta with rumali rotis.
The mutton kasa came with three mutton pieces which were well cooked and soft. The gravy was spicy and was less hot in taste. You can ask for extra gravy which comes for free. The dish was less oily and tasted great.
The chicken bharta was served with a boiled egg and garnished with cream. The gravy was delicious and was light and was not very hot with unnecessary chilis.
The rumali rotis were big in size and were prepared right then and served hot. They were soft and tasted good.
The ambience of the restaurant is good with friendly staffs. The patrons are basically office goers. Hygiene of the place is good. The price for food is really worthy and it is very pocket friendly.

This is one restaurant I have been visiting since childhood. Just love the taste of the biriyani there. The food here is simply a gastronomic delight. The place is very pocket friendly. After an entire day of shopping at new market, this is the place to go to to complete the outing. Chicken stew and rumali roti is also amazing. I have taken almost every friend of mine to this place. I will very gladly pass on the discovery of this food joint down my generations in the same way I have received it from my father.

Revisiting old memories was the buzz of the day. Chitto da's chicken stew was introduced to me by my father when I was very young & it was a wall side eatery with a great reputation amongst the office goers of the dalhousie area & I went back to revisit those times without much expectations. Infact I was expecting with time & tide may be that glory of taste buds was gone. I was wrong & happily so!! The stew,the same pale yellow & the perfect taste!! For once I happily finished even the boiled papaya in the stew given that I hate it otherwise. Awesome it is!! Ordered mutton biriyani,mixed fried rice,mutton kosha & all of them made our day. Made us forget all the trouble we took to reach the place, the awefull heat outside!! The mutton was literally so soft that one can cut it apart just with spoons!! The mixed rice was packed with prawns & chicken & was delicious to the least & my biriyani lover husband almost packed another biriyani to take home for dinner!!The mutton in the biriyani also was very well cooked & tasted great!! I hope somethings donot change over time & chitto da's is one of them!! This place is a GEM & I hope they retain it that way!!

If i could i would rate this place 4.7. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†After a long tiring day of shopping, i decided to pay a visit. It was not that hard to find. It is situated deep down Dacres lane. First of all the people working here are so very nice and they really made us feel like home. ¬†They were really patient and catered to each and every need. they really made our visit memorable. ¬† ¬† ¬†Being famished we ordered the famous CHICKEN STEW first. It came within 5mins. Wow it was such a comfort to sip into the warm soup after being partially drenched in the rain. Once i started i cudnt stop. the stew comes with a chicken piece, a piece of carrot and half a baby papaya, The papaya was surprisingly tasty. After we finished the soup they brought another complimentary plate of the soup and poured into our plate. how generous of them! this kind of thing is really hard to find in other places. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Next We ordered CHICKEN BHARTA with ROOMALI ROTIi. It was a nut based gravy with shredded chicken and an egg atop. It was very nice very appropriate for rotis. Huge amount of gravy enough for 4 roomalis. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Next came in the MIXED CHOWMEIN, MIXED FRIED RICE with CHILI CHICKEN n CHILLI FISH. Both fried rice n chowmein were good but i loved the chowmein more. It had more prawn n chicken and it was really tasty, not so oily, quiet spicy. The sauce the give with the chow was also nice. Chow ¬†with sauce yum. you would not need any sides with the chow. Quantity of each plate was good enough to be shared by 2 people. ¬†Fried rice was good but could have been better. ¬†Now chilli chicken and chilli fish both were average. The fish was flaky quite soft n juicy Thats the good point. Gravy was not so good. We 3 were full to the brim. I will definitely come back again for all the other dishes. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Surprisingly the Bill came around 450 ONLY! ¬†So great! this place really is A GEM.

Visited it a couple of months back to try out the delicacies at this legendary place! A decent joint amidst the hustle bustle of Dacre's Lane. Nothing fancy. Basic seating arrangements and no a.c. The staff was humble and service was good. We tried out Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Fish & Fish Kabiraji. The proportions were decent and the food tasted amazing! It was a good blend of flavours and everything was cooked to perfection. Everything is very reasonably priced - I would suggest everyone to try this place out once! Just dont expect anything fancy and the food won't disappoint you!

We see Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant (CSR) as a part of Hidden Jem out here on Zomato so there's nothing much to talk about its legacy. This one is one more Esplanade style, old fashioned, and authentic places to grab a bite. The place might not look gorgeous but when you're in esplanade, that's not the most important thing one looks for.

The menu options are quite enough for a place this size and the quality is optimum to me. The seating arrangements are good enough to grab what one needs. CSR is one of those first and old places in this area which has survived because of its dedicated efforts to offer good food at reasonable rates.

One of the legends of Dacre's Lane, this restaurant is one where even my grandpa used to eat.
I went there with my buddy and we ordered a chicken stew and toasted bread at first. The stew was good and the bread was perfectly toasted...crispy brown but not burnt. 
Next we ordered a chicken pakora and it was served piping hot. They were very tasty with a great filling.
The service is good,the needs of your table will be looked after and we didn't have to holler for anything.
The prices are quite reasonable. This place is perfect for a spot of afternoon snacks.

Chitto Da's tea,Paw Rooti with Chicken Stew,Ghugni is famous at Dacers Lane area.It is most popular joint & one of the oldest food shop.Suruchee Restaurant is also chitto Da's part.There are few seating arrangements.Food service is very fast.Suruchee restaurant is located just few shops after chitto da's tea shop at Dacers Lane.Today I've been there with my friend on the evening.we have ordered two plates chicken kasha with roomali rooti & green salad.Chicken kasha is quite tasty,but the gravy is little thin like chicken curry.waiter is very helpful.Price is very cheap.Next time I'll try here chinese item.

This place though non ac and quite humble in appearance is still probably the most decorated and fancy place in the iconic Dacres lane or food lane of Kolkata.

This has come up much later and a couple of shops from the original heritage Chiitodas.Although the original Chittodas serves up mainly fries and cutlets,this one has expanded the menu to include Chinese and Mughlai delicacies.The chops and cutlets are available here also and are nice crisp and fresh.

Among the other fare,I have tried their mutton kasha chicken bharta and chicken chap,all of which might not been exceptional but still pretty nice nonetheless.They are tasty and not overtly oily as one would find in most similar joints.The food is not like what you get everywhere else and has a touch of homeliness to it.I have not tried their Chinese yet and I look forward to doing so at the earliest opportunity.

The prices are unbelievably cheap.I do not think anywhere else one can get even close to similar quality at similar prices.The staff are all extremely friendly.They will happily serve you with extra salad or gravy.The seating arrangements are quite okay too.

Overall if you are willing to try some place rather different and are low on budget then this is surely the place for you.
Enjoy! :)

Right from KC Das we took a turn towards left and then the lane comes where you see the crowd anytime of the day and various smells of food fills your nose. It was then when daddy introduced me to this restaurant. Glass tables and steel coloured chairs were pretty much okay but the food was feast for the eyes indeed.

We had cutlets, chicken stew, bread, chicken noodles, fried rice and chicken chilly from this place. Since then I keep visiting this place if I am at esplanade. The prices are very low and the food is really good. They even serve you extra gravy if you require. There is nothing to say about the decor but it's a busy restaurant in a busy street.¬†

You will see long take away queue in the afternoon here. I suggest food lovers and old places¬†visitors to visit this place soon! :D

We had chicken cutlet, chicken bharta and rumali roti. Evrythng was awesome nd the bharta was too yummy. This place is a perfect eatery in the esplanade area. Also the waiter was very courteous and offered us salad twice !!
The second time i went there, i had mixed fried rice and chilli chicken. The fried rice was fresh and full of egg, chicken and prawns. It had less oil and more of taste. The chilli chicken was very tasty and the pieces were soft and juicy. I would visit this place everytime i go near esplande !!!

Now this restaurant was one of the many gems that we discovered out of the zomato treasure chest?
walking past the "food para" of esplanade....... carefully guided by his gps we very bravely walked past the  aromatic food stalls without stopping at any and finally found the entrance to our destination?Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant. 
So we got our seats.... at around 2.40pm on a weekday the place was mostly empty.... 
the first thing we asked...... Menu koi? 
to which the waiter pointed to the  laminated menu on the wall?now that was unique!!! 
After a short discussion we settled for two veg chowmein and half plate chicken munchurian. 
The service was prompt. 
Food verdict-awesome food. 
The chowmein was perfectly cooked with perfect amount of seasoning and oil.?
The chicken was delectable. except for the fact that the size of the pieces were not satisfactory.... we'hv had better at this price and a bit too much use of food colour. but keeping in mind the taste and the perfectly cooked pieces. no regrets. ?
The Foodie Duo Verdict-Highly recommended for the ones with a pocket crunch but hungry taste buds. bon appetite?

Well the place is very reputed and doesn't need any introduction to the food lovers of kolkata. I went to the place with my partner as she is in love with their stew. On my first visit I came face to face with some awesome chicken stew toasted bread and egg devil. 
Now as the address on zomato says the place is located at becker's lane.
The old age charm can be felt at the decades old chitto da 's. The restaurant is their latest business addition with wide variety of menu. 

I would suggest everyone who love food and love old age charm. Chitto da's old food joint is the place to be. But if you like a more generic version of the heritage go to the restaurant. 

The restaurant is provide equal good quality and quantity which is generous. My suggestion would be to visit the old shop with friends and restaurant with girlfriend.

After several years i have got a lucky enough to get this place open and could have the fabulous snack here.  Originally it is the "Chittoda's  Dokan" ( Chitto da's shop) which is the origin and later on the restaurent. Apart form the background of it i must say though it won't appeal you much unless you taste the snack here. They serve fabulous chicken stew with toast, fish roll, chicken pakoda, fish fry as the hot selling and tea off course. Give it a try and i am sure this place will pull you back every time you step Kolkata. Have great food stay happy.   @

No wi-fi, no card bill payment, no air-con and no luxurious seating & entertainments. Plain vanilla look and feel but food here is really awesome and at great prices which is a must discovery for all. Service is quick and portions are good which should satisfy all food lovers like me. Sunday is closed so craves for this shop to be discounted on all Sundays. Staffs are very good and they are humble. Each and every item has got a lip smacking experience and they serve really hot n fresh. The rush for office delivery can be caught if anyone makes to this shop on any weekdays morning time. Chicken Fried rice and Chilli Chicken with extra gravy comes at only Rs 120 which is like finding an oasis in a desert. I have got a superb liking for this shop. Have chicken with Roomali Rotis, Chow, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Manchurian and Fries.

Today was the day of revelation. I had heard about someone named Chittoda who has a legendary outlet in Daker's lane serving toast and chicken stue. We went there today to find a lovely little place with bout 7-8 tables. Decor was minimum but to our pleasant surprise the place was really clean and tidy. We realized it was a full on restaurant serving north Indian cuisine also. We went to have stue. It was simply lovely. Surpassed all our expectations. Its a hidden gem in our city.

This is a hidden gem deep inside the vintage food street in Kolkata that goes by the name Dacre's Lane.People who love their food will surely know about this place.This is also perhaps the only place which has a more dine-in restaurant kind of arrangement.Other joints in the lane have rudimentary wooden benches or else one has to stand and eat.
This joint serves a wide-array of dishes from the humble roti-ghugni to the elaborate biriyani. I tried out the roomali roti and mutton kosha. The mutton curry was like home-made stuff and yum to say the least.Decent amount of gravy to dunk one's roti, well boiled three cube sized pieces of meat and a gravy which was neither too hot,oily or spicy.Well-balanced.Priced at Rs 78/-, what more can one ask for in today's age of spiraling prices.The roomali rotis were also freshly made and served piping hot.
Service is quick and polite.Staff are friendly and attentive.
Signature dishes: Fish roll,chicken bharta,mutton kosha

This is one of the best restaurants i have ever been to. Best in pocket friendly zone. You don't need ambiance because the moment you enter Decker's lane your nose starts to fill up with different flavors of diff. food. ¬†Nothing much of a decor. The food is just too good. Most of the times i go i order Rumali roti and Chicken bharta. Chicken bharta is too good. Shredded peices of chicken with boiled egg in a curry topped with fresh cream, It is freaking yummy. ¬†Fish fingers, Pakoda are too good. Try their mutton curry, u will feel like u are eating in your home. The waiters and the kitchen is fast. Quality and quantity is too good. It will cost around 300-400 bucks for 2 ppl.¬†

The moment you enter Decker's Lane  you could feel your stomach churning at the very sight of people sitting in rows  and eating . This restaurant has a proper seating arrangement unlike most of its neighbors. The service is swift and food is mouthwatering. We ordered FISH FINGERS , CHICKEN BIRYANI and CHICKEN BHARTA , all of which were excellent as per their prices. It is quite pocket friendly and   cost us Rs. 400 for two .

Possibly the best bang for your buck restaurant located at one of the most accessible areas of the city! Located in a crowded bustling lane of the city, you don't expect top notch space for eating, but going to restaurants like these , people don't expect huge sprawling tables or great sophistication! Instead this place makes no nuisance of the fact that it doesn't score high on ambience or sophistication, it is there to serve you great food at low prices! Quite a regular at this place, I have tried most things available here but the best thing by FAR is their Chicken Bharta!!! It is,simply put, AWESOME!!!! Unlike other places, the chicken pokoras served here actually contain a lot of chicken and are a yummy treat indeed! Chilly Chicken and Chilly Fish are good too (though not the BEST!) But one of the other things I find here is the Chicken Stew which comes which a big piece of chicken, a lot of stew and a big papaya which is the best thing for your tummy on a hot afternoon!All in all, a ¬†very nice little place with an ambience best described as "BUSTLING" and AWESOME WHOLESOME FOOD (isnt that what restaurants are supposed to be mainly about? :D )

Well this has to be my favourite resturant in the " pocket friendly " zone.
In a crowded small lane of Dharmatala, namely Deckers, this is a fantastic place to be in. Tough to locate though. Many are unaware of this place for sure but it's worth it.

I order Chicken Bharta and Butter Chicken mainly always. Today i added Chilli fish and like always. Not disappointed. The Chicken Bharta is to die for really. Yummmmilicious. Buttery gravy and cut chicken pieces with egg cut on top. Too good. Butter Chicken is quite the same. Really good. The Chilli Fish could have been better though. Bit spicy maybe otherwise fine. The Egg Chow which my friend ordered was fair enough as well.

In all. This is a great place to have food in a very small budget because its damn cheap and provides good quality food and quick. The atmosphere is a okay, nothing great but certainly not a problem. Serves fast and it's really a good place for North Indian dishes. Something i love.

P.S. Please go deep into the lane to find it and dont go by the look of the shops around when entering the lane. It's worth the walk.

It is the all time choice for every office ocassion. :) Pocket friendly, tasty, and satisfying quantity as per price. Though it's not enough good to dine in, but for take away it's just "yo yo". I tried almost every tem here and they are good. Indian food are better in quality than Chinese here. They make a yamiieee chicken rejala but their bharta is bit more oily.¬†
It's a small place and stuffs are not well trained . The Positive points are as follows : (i) tasty and pocket friendly (ii) quick service (iii) good quantity and quality . One thing I didn't like ¬†about this eatery is the waiter will always stand at ur table until you give him a tip.

gone to suruchi just once....tried only the fish fry and chicken stew....so it would be wrong to judge the restaurant...still the fish fry was not up to the mark...the stew lacks flavour....interestingly , it is yellowish in color which one cant find normally on the kolkata streets... would want to try their fish roll and chilly fish

If your thinking of grabbing a small snack after a long day's work,this is the best place to be. Located in a small alley known as the Dacer's Lane this restaurant prepares the best Chicken Hakka Chowmein in the locality. You can also try out the prawn specialities of this restaurant. Crowd management is extremely good and the waiter will always ask you for an extra tip. Never mind the ambience , just go in quietly, sit and enjoy the snack.

SURUCHEE is fantabulous!!! 'Out of the world' food quality is served in no time!!! This eatery in Dacres Lane offers food quality comparable to any good restaurant in Calcutta. Its famous among the Office-para people; but as Suruchee management hardly cares about exposure or advertisement of any sort, foodies get to know less about the establishment. This restaurant is great as they provide quality dishes in low prices. Just one negative about this place is that the lane is a bit crowded and the ambience might not be liked by all. Still, I enjoy devouring food here always...

Suruchee is very very busy all the time, and there is a reason why - its good food for a decent price - solid, fill your tummy and make you happy food. In times when you need to grab a fast meal, head over here. They make a great chicken stew and kasa, and you will get your food very fast. I have not tried the Chinese, but I have heard that it is nice. A great place if you are near Peerless Bhawan and want to eat cheap and tasty.

Tucked away in office para of "Esplanade" - Suruchee is one of the hidden gems which everyone in Esplanade knows about and raves about - however, only during office hours.

This value for money eatery is tucked away in Deckers lane along with many many roadside eateries. One of my uncles was huge fan of this place and we were often treated to food from Suruchee.

I remember walking through Deckers lane and walking into Suruchee - a crowded , super busy eatery. I had some chicken rezala - light white gravy chicken and tandoori roti. Served within 5 minutes, had my meal within 10 minutes and was on may within 20 minutes end to end.
