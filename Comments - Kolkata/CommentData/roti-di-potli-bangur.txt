I ordered mix veg and paneer kofta n few falkas . The falkas were really soft and good but both the veggies were disaster. Too spicy paneer kofta lacking any paneer but more of a aloo kofta and mix veg was like soup consistency with all the boiled vegetables immersed in it . I hv never had a mix veg like this which is supposed to be thick n creamy gravy . Just because it is listed on zomato dnt buy order food from them . I m sure it must be dome side cheap joint who doesnt know how to make north indian curries !!!

Ordered from swiggy from this place. Its an average place. Food is okay . 

You ll basically find delicacies which are prepared at home. You also get thalis here. Usually good when your mom is not well or your maid hasnt arrived. No place for dine in. Only takeaway or delivery.

I ordered  for the  first  time  and had a very  bad experience. Ordered  from  swigging  it was not delivered  on time. Food was pathetic. We ordered  for cheese  paratha  masala  mirchi  paratha and  adraki mirchi paratha  .but they only served masala  mirchi paratha which was for 30 rs and the  other  two were for 50 rs.but they didn't  inform  also and took extra money  for them please  don't order from this outlet or check before paying. @sudha bothra

My experience was not great with this place right here. Firstly, the order was delayed by 15-20 minutes( which is fine). Most importantly, I did not like the rotizza at all. The name is classic white cheese rotizza and I chose bajra base. I was really disappointed with the leathery base I got.also the cheese did not taste OR look appetizing.The thing I received was not worth the 170 rupees I spent. DISAPPOINTED.

I heard about this restuarant from one of my friend. He recommemded me to try the roties of this place.  I am a non-vegentarian but i agree that they serve great food. One of the best restuarant for vegetarians. The quality of the food is great. And the services are outstanding and fast. For people who are likely to visit the place, i would definately recommend them to try any of thr food they are serving, you would love it.

It was late for lunch and no time to cook so quickly ordered food from this place. Quite a unusual name Roti di Potli. Ordered a Penne Pasta and a Paneer Masala (Semi Gravy) Meal. The Penne Pasta was made in white Sauce, nothing unusual about it was creamy and soft. On the other hand, the Paneer Masala was quite spicy had quite some pieces of Paneer, though the gravy provided was little in quantity being a combo meal but adequate for one person. On the other hand the Vegetable Pulao was nicely made, was tasty with small pieces of veggies cauliflower's, beans, pea's, tomatoes, carrots etc. Had a blend of spices. Overall the food experience was nice, pocket friendly experience worth the money..
