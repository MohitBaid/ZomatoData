We ordered fried chicken, chicken double patty burger, berry berry mocktail , french fries and thumps up. Honestly, and virgin mojito in other occassion to the price of food from this joint is quite reasonable as per the quantity. The quality is also good but the only con is their taste. The fried chicken, be it popcorn, wings or legs all of them tastes the same as always and they make the worst virgin mojito

The taste of the food is okay. The delivery time they took is too long. The price of the food is reasonal . We took a home delivery so don't know about the ambience.

Ordered from this place few days back. The burger and the chicken wings were finely cooked. However the salt and spice could be little more. This place provides KFC quality food in a pocket friendly rate. Very good packaging also. The pizza was very very bad. From the crust to the cheese. The crust was very thin and too soft like a chapati. I ordered cheese burst, but there was no sign of cheese in the pizza. Won't be ordering pizza anymore from this place. However the burger and the chicken wings are good. It was a 50/50 experience.

Ordered from here for the first time
Ordered chicken overloaded pizza and chilli garlic bread.
The garlic bread was nice and I liked it though it was dry but still it was good
Coming to the pizza, it was not good at all infact I ordered from here so that I can have pizza but my bad luck
1. The pizza was not warm at all
2. They did not use mozzarella cheese
3. The pizza was literally hard.
The good part is it's bigger than the regular pizzas we get in dominos etc but if it's not tasty then it's no point being bigger in size
The pizza was divided into four..I would suggest to divide it into eight due to bigger size.
The price was low the bill was rs 156 for both the items.

this is my favourite fried chicken craving quencher. i have tried the combos which are nothing but amazingly fufilling. the burger was always a bit dry and chewy.Â 
delivery time is average and price for the food quality is super cheap. still stays one of the very best fried chicken places .

Cheap price fast food available here. Quality good, service good. But kitchen not too much clean. Best to order via online apps like Swiggy, Zomato and Food Panda.

I have visited this joint pretty frequently given the burgers and fries they provide at the dirt cheap prices. 

My favourites from here would be chicken special burger , fried chicken popcorn and fried chicken strips. The burger has a serious amount of mayo and cheese and the patty is made real crisp and fresh. If you order via swiggy , you can also avail a 10% discount on all the dishes. 

Happy much ?

Food tastes okay considering the cheap price.the quantity is fine but the quality is not that good. The combo meal of chicken burger, coke ,fries n fried chicken piece is quite cost efficient. Got 10% off from swiggy.
