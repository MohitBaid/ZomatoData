The first tym I came across this place was wen I attended a bday party organized by them at their saltlake address.... Small party well organized n perfectly managed.... My fav item here it the Tanthi idli... One of its kind... V diff n yummiliciois...even the Chinese food was perfectly made...post this, we even ordered food wen we had a party at my place.. Mrs bina Agarwal, the owner takes special interest in all her orders... The kind of presentation they give is commendable... Even the desserts are too good. The Monte Carlo is a never miss item....  Must try...

To describe in one word......INCREDIBLE!!! My sister ordered a birthday cake from this place. She wanted it to be customised. The cake she received was the way she wanted it. According to me many of the famous cake shops will fall short if I compare the cakes from them with this one. Amazing in taste, just perfect. You just name it and they will do it for you. And you get the joy of putting smile one your loved one's face. Its more than what you pay for. Keep up the good work. Hungry for more!!!

Perfect taste wid perfect idea. Very friendly and cooperative owner. A right place when it comes to deserts. Pocket friendly too. I have ordered for a one pound chocolate cake nd it was very well decorated. The best part was the taste which to my surprise turned out to be really nice. Thanks for such a wonderful cake.

When i came to know about pasticceria i thought of giving it a try n ordered a cake for my friend's birthday. The cake turned out to be exactly how i wanted it to be. Aftr that i have ordered cakes for various occasions and pasticceria has never disappointed me. The thing which i love about it is they always have very innovative ideas for your cake even if you are clueless and the cakes are not just amazing and fancy but hell tasty too! All those who haven't given it a try yet you are certainly missing something really good!
