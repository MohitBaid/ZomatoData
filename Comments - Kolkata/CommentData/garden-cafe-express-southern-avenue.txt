Located on the lane beside purna das road, behind the wise owl, south indian joint mostly with beverages thrown in. What i loved here the most was the american ice cream soda. The age old classic drink which has gradually faded due to in availability of ice cream soda. 
Sat of high stools so alike the small canteens in south India and had american ice cream soda, mango blossom and dahi phuchka. 
Taxes are taken, waiters are dressed as railway servers with a topi. The beverages came fast, the phuchka took time and was filled with cooked alu and dahi lacking the punch of phuchka. The mango blossom was okayish bt without the charm of a blossom verging on a lassi. The ice cream soda was the best and the entire bottle of the age old soda came with the ice cream in a glass. 
Nice for a casual adda..

I'm a regular here and usually avail their in-car service in the evenings when I visit. The food is always great but the service has just been going downhill recently. I usually order a standard iced tea and plain cheese dosa combo. My iced tea arrives after my food finishes and after a fair few reminders for the same. The store has started taking big catering orders but still tries to serve in-store customers at the same time even though they don't have the manpower or the capability to attempt both.

In my humble opinion, you get the same quality of food but much better service at every other branch of garden cafe - ditch this one and stick to the others.

We ordered a rava onion masala dosa and a cheese plain dosa.

Both are utterly hopeless

Rava onion masala dosa : There wasn't any onion in the dosa. Actually the dosa was so soggy could hardly feel any Rava. Just a lump stuck to the masala.

Cheese plain dosa: didn't have any cheese in it. Bland to taste. The wife had to throw it away.

The white chutney was not mixed properly and one could feel whole coconut pcs in it.

Horrible experience.

Have been here so many times! Located in Keyatala road near cloakroom, this outlet of garden cafe express is usually not crowded and perfect for a nice quiet snack or dinner. The mushroom cheese Dosa, baby corn Dosa are a must try here. Also the mixed cheese pizza with the old world charm pulls you in. They have an open kitchen so it gets clanky but overall it is always pleasant. There is no ac here but somehow the place is very close to my heart.

Avoid cold coffee here, it isn't the best.

Prices are okay. Overall,.a good place in the area.

Been there about a month back. The place finally has air conditioning which was missing some time back and they make it a point to mention it in the menu that you'll be charged extra for that perk. Coming to the food, the preparation time is really long I must say. I ordered a masala dosa a butter plain dosa and a couple of plates of idli as I wanted to try out the main selling point of the restaurant. Had to wait about 30 mins before I got my order which was really long considering that there were two people preparing this and all they had to prepare other than my food was one more dosa for another customer. Coming to the favor, I must say that is the only thing that resurrected this review from being a negative one. The food is of very good quality and for the price they charge the food is top notch quality. The eating stools are a bit high and can make one uncomfortable but other than that gripe you'll have no other complains. The waiters were courteous enough to come after short intervals to refill some sambar or the coconut chutney and always served with a smile so yes go there for a quick byte and keep some time on your hands other than that it's a great place to satisfy your taste buds

And they delivered it in a tiffin box like restaurants deliver any gravy side dish!
Are you guys insane?

If you don't have a proper packaging system then why do you even have the cold coffee in the delivery menu!

Ordered for home delivery. They make the world's worst dosa ever. I mean which is beyond edible, it's burnt and salty, the uttapam was like rubber and the sambar Vada like two badly fried rocks! I can't believe they actually charge money for this thing called "food". 
They should pay me for tasting their junk. 
The 1.0 rating is for the butter idlis which were decent, should taste the sambar which is water with veggies and salt. After the legendary Alipore outlet this one is a SHAME that too in capital letters. Yuck.

A decent and comfortable place to enjoy good south indian food. Nothing path breakingly good, but at the same time decent and well priced. 

The cold coffee is a winner and items on the menu are satisfying. The Lack of air conditioning might be discomforting for some, but nonetheless you will be happy with your lunch. The topi dosa combo is a well priced option to go for if you are alone.

Fried finger idly is a sensation of its own. With the right mix of masala flavor and fried with love, it blew my mind. The south indian sister of potato wedges. 12 pieces in 70 bucks, this mouth watering dish is a complete value for money. Then comes a combo platter with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, might look weird with idlis and dosas but it does it own job, it brings you back from south india. They also offer pizzas and drinks, American ice cream soda is worth a try.

The size of the dosas is more than enough for one person, coupled with the unlimited (delicious) sambhar and chutney.

We figured this place out while searching for a good south indian breakfast joint near gariahat. It is secluded from the main road and is usually empty. I must say that it is one of the better places where you get south indian breakfast both in terms of quality and price. We ordered for a light breakfast.. Uttapam and masala dosa along with tea. The masala dosa was really good but what really grabbed my attention was the white coconut chutney. The coconut chutney was a little sour adding to the taste and also thick. We almost had the entire meal with the chutney and asked for double refills. 

The hospitality was quite good and the ambiance also scored high. Do drop in and find out more about the place

Located in the lanes of Southern Avenue near abouts precisely keyatala  road, it's not very popular like it's main branch in alipore area. Idli, utttapam, and dosas from this kitchen is just too irresistible. My favourites here are the Cheese Mushroom Dosa and the Onion Uttapam. Try it!!!

Review 2.
It's gained popularity over the years and has footfalls now but they seriously lack the seating capacity. They started with standing table dining and later added high chairs but unfortunately can accommodate only about 10 people max. They are renovating finally and installing AC which means they will have to change their seating capacity too to get more guests seated. In short you got to be lucky to not wait.

Second review: (may,2015) Well it is the second time I'm writing about this restaurant. This time i tried two new dishes and i had to appreciate. I ordered finger fried idly and baby corn uttapam for home delivery. I just loved them. Uttapam was more like a small soft pizza without cheese and bread and tasted awesome. The idly was completely different from the usual ones. It looked like finger chips but size is bigger. Idly was smashed with potato and then cut into pieces and fried with minimum oil which made it very crispy. Though it was a bit salty. I loved its taste. These two are must try.
First review: Since it is very close to my home, i visit here very often. I love the south indian dishes here. I love the different types of dosas-Cheese dosa, butter dosa,pepper dosa and butter masala dosas are my favourite. I love idlis and dahi vadas. They have a variety of drinks. I enjoy the floats, lassi here. Uttapam is also tasty. For those who love south indian dishes, it is a must come.

Average place- okay for a quick bite. The dosas are crisp and fresh. The ambience is very average, but if you're in the locality and famished, then Garden Cafe could be a good option to grab a quick south Indian meal. The food doesn't compare to other south Indian places like Banana Leaf but the place is cheap and effective.

Located in the lanes of Southern Avenue near abouts precisely keyatala  road, it's not very popular like it's main branch in alipore area. Idli, utttapam, and dosas from this kitchen is just too irresistible. My favourites here are the Cheese Mushroom Dosa and the Onion Uttapam. Try it!!!

Review 2.
It's gained popularity over the years and has footfalls now but they seriously lack the seating capacity. They started with standing table dining and later added high chairs but unfortunately can accommodate only about 10 people max. They are renovating finally and installing AC which means they will have to change their seating capacity too to get more guests seated. In short you got to be lucky to not wait.

Second review: (may,2015) Well it is the second time I'm writing about this restaurant. This time i tried two new dishes and i had to appreciate. I ordered finger fried idly and baby corn uttapam for home delivery. I just loved them. Uttapam was more like a small soft pizza without cheese and bread and tasted awesome. The idly was completely different from the usual ones. It looked like finger chips but size is bigger. Idly was smashed with potato and then cut into pieces and fried with minimum oil which made it very crispy. Though it was a bit salty. I loved its taste. These two are must try.

Great ambience and food. The staff are welcoming and the service is prompt. The dahi vadas are very refreshing in summers and the pizzas with the cold coffee are my favourite. The best thing has been there introduction of chairs now, which makes the place much more comfortable. Its a definite place in Kolkata for me to hang out with friends in the evenings.

Just above average south Indian food served at the place although the dosas are light and crisp the sambhar chutney is not too authentic. The idli and wadas are soft. the uthapam is below average . I have stopped by various times to grab a quick lunch at this place on my way back from work. Although the food is not exceptional the service is fast and prompt and they serve with a smile . The coffee is always decent. 

I am quite a dosa person and it helps me keep light as compared to north indian food.

While waiting for a friend who works right on the first floor of this outlet, I have been guilty of drinking cups of coffee from here, and taken away idly and vada when I felt like it. I was pretty surprised to see that unlike most places which heap in a lot of sambar and chutney with their food, this one actually puts in less. For me, it is a sort of turnoff, and although the idli is okay, it is not great, and I have had much better in South India Club or Banana Leaf.

South Indian food with home made pizzas completes Garden Cafe. the problem is no ac and they very stingy when it comes to serving sambar for your food. 

they have very small bowls in which like 6 spoons of smabar fit. and it gets embarresing to ask for it again and again. 

over and above the quality and the taste is spot on.

A nice little place to satisfy your dosa-craving ..... they make a pretty decent dosa and the vada and idli is also good. Sambar and Chutney are flavourful and accompany the food nicely. The dahi vada is refreshing on a hot day as well. Pizza's are the homemade kind. The cola-float is nice to sip on in the summers.

Location: This particular branch of garden cafe express is located near Mrs magpie or azad hind, golpark or wise owl. 

Serves 1)a large varieties of dosas
2) moderate varieties of pizza
3) few varieties of vadas, idlis and beverages

Coming to the pros and cons now:-
Pros:-
1) it follows a standing and eating concept. They have long side tables of marble where you can stand and eat. Typically South Indian concept.
2) prices are very reasonable
3) food quality and deliciousness is moderate. 
4) ambience = ok
5) service is quick

Cons:-
1) too cramped
2) cannot accommodate large number of people 

Rest all is well :-)

Foods maintained its standard even in this outlet, but pls put some chairs there! Unless we drive down to the place there is no place to stand and eat a meal and this can be very turning off. Do try the cheese chilli paper doss and rose milkshake. My favourite! 3.5 stars from me
