I had dropped in to this place casually for dinner (since of it's close proximity to my home).
Didn't want to splurge out much was another good reason to eat out here. Ordered chicken mushroom soup, egg fried rice, chilly paneer and hong kong chicken . We were 2 of us and trust me the quantity was more than good for us two. The food rates are very pocket friendly and the food tasted good too. The place is congested given people prefer to take away from this particular place. 
If you are in a hurry, don't want to splurge and live close by to this place's location, go ahead and gobble up.It won't disappoint.

Quality is average here.
Other than that,everything is awesome.
Rolls are economical.
Roti,thalis and other veg dishes are of great help for a single work person or a college student.
They deliver,and they deliver food swiftly.Thats why the are crowded at most of the times.
Good quantity of food,awesome service and economical pricing makes Jiban Jamuna a must in Rajarhat area.

Cheap. Quantity is good. But quality a big NO. Ordered fish thali, veg thali, mixed fried rice ( chicken, egg , prawn ) , 2 pieces of fish fry (katla) , chicken hot and sour, chilli chicken. Though the quantity was abundant for us 4 people, however the quality was not up to the mark. It was uncooked and tasteless. Lack of salt and spices . Definitely a pass

Jiban Jamuna is an extremely pocket friendly restaurant. Ordered half a plate of chicken tandoori (for only 140 rs!!!) along with a plate of chilli chicken and egg fried rice. The tandoori chicken had rock salt sprinkled over it which gave it a street food edge. Rest of the food were okay. Nothing wow but did have a Chinese feel to it. Overall, might visit again.

14-Nov-2017: Today was the first time I ordered the following (through Zomato) from Jiban Jamuna:
1) Chicken Gravy Chow
2) Prawn Fried Rice
3) Garlic Chicken
4) Chilly Fish
5) Laccha Paratha
6) Chicken Butter Masala
7) Mishti Dahi (received complimentary from Zomato)

I live 6kms from this Restaurant, and what amazed me most was that the entire order (so many varying items) was delivered to me within 44 minutes!
Now regarding the taste and quality of food, all I have to say is it is most tasty @the most reasonable of rates. Everyone in my family was impressed and we are eager to try other menus of this Restaurant.... specially the Bengali Thalis. Thanks Jiban Jamuna!

A life saver when it comoes to online orders. 
However there are places of improvement.  
Pros 
Always 5 to 10 mins prior schdule. 
Chinese delicacies and food in general is served fresh 
Choice of varieties. 
Cons
Packing has a lot of space for improvement. 
Not all dishes are cooked to perfection like north indian and mughlai cuisines. 
Ordered momos in hot schzewine garlic sauce it was cooked to perfect however the chicken drum sticks tasted much beyond expectations.

Chicken fried rice was good. Could have been better in some point.
Chilli chicken was very tasty, rich, and the chickens were well marinated and soft.
The egg biriani is too good. I was not expecting that good quality. 
I will definitely recommend this restaurant to others. And the best part is it is the pricing is very reasonable.

So i am giving rating based on

I have been to this place 2-3 times and I was not disappointed at all. 
I tried their Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken, chilli chicken with Laccha Paratha. Everything tasted fine.
 Theirs nothing fancy about this place but they serve you good food at a very low price. The quantity is also good. They dont charge you any extra money coz the prices of the food items in the menu are tax included.

On 15th April 17, I have been there with my family & have ordered hongkong chicken along with mixed gravy chow & mixed fried rice. Food quality & quantity both are very low. They have used turmeric in Chinese dishes. It is just terrific. When I have informed them about the same, they have confirmed that they add some amount of turmeric to bring some color. Having food there its just a wastage of money.

Food ok but the behavior of the restaurant staff especially cashier was too rude and unmannerd. Talk to us rudely as if he is paying for the food.

They charge Rs.20 for packing, which I must say is excellent seeing their way of packing the food. Would love to try the restaurant some time.

It is a restaurant very near to City Centre, Rajarhat. I went here for several times. The restaurant is not very well decored. Simple, yet not very large. Actually, when your budget is not that high and you still want to have a lot of food, Jiban Jamuna is the place. But, I found the foods to be a little bit more oily.

Avoid. Ordered 2 hours ago. The restaurant claims they never got the order, but they somehow accepted it and then half an hour later marked it sent for delivery. 1.25 hours after the delivery time now, and still counting. They won't answer their phones. Zomato says they're claiming they never got the order and will send it after another half an hour. Neither Zomato nor the restaurant can explain how they marked the order out for delivery if they never got it in the first place.

Not for vegetarians! Ok, long story short - came here with my mom (we've been vegetarians for the last 10 years), ordered chilli paneer/baby corn (don't remember frankly). Did not realize it was chicken with the first bite, but it definitely was not paneer/baby corn. Called the waiter and asked him about it. He wore a fake smile: "sir, we won't charge extra for it, you can have it". Furious, I went to see the manager..he was like "no issue, if you did not like the auto-upgrade, we will cancel and not charge you".

Ordered food from Zomato at this resto at 9:30 pm. got a msg that food is out for delivery at 10:15 pm  and.... what !!!
The food was not delivered even after 3 hours ..
Both the contact numbers given were switched off after 10:30 pm with a simple explanation from them as in restaurant time is over .. 
After a frustrating night waiting for dinner , when I finally got in touch with resto people the next morning, their exact explanation was ..

 "Kya apne online order kiya tha Zomato se ?
Zomato Walon ne toh ek chota sa mobile diya hai hume Zo kabhi off hota hai toh kabhi on hota hai..
Hume nai pata kya hua.. pata laga k bataunga !!"

And they are still pata lagaing !!
I mean ..why register urself to something when u r not able to maintain it properly.

Quantity is what comes to mind, when i sit down to write for this. This is a late review, but i still remember its unparalled quantity. Fresh from an intense movie, we came down here hungry like wolvesNoodles is what we ordered, a plate for each and then we realised what we had done. Halfway down, we all were dead, could not even move and they were generous enough to pack them for us.if pocket pinch is low and  u are in a big group, this place can be a mere try

The price is very pocket friendly.. so you can go for this place very often.. we had the hakka chow, garlic chicken, dry chilli chicken and chicken biriyani from this place. everything was really good but I found the biriyani not very fresh once during the summer months.. but that was a one of incident and in the later cases the biriyani was fine, the quantities are huge and generous.. very good restro if you are living near rajarhat area. But the ambiance is not so good so u can take away the food.

Jiban Jamuna is apparently a very small food joint located right beside the Shopper's Stop building in Rajarhat. Though I have never been there, I'm a regular customer through their home delivery service. Service is prompt, I stay 3 kms away from their restaurant and they get food delivered in 40-45 mins, even for a bulk order. Coming to the food, not all dishes are good. You have to be a regular of such a place to identify what's good and what's not. The Chinese preparations are better than their Indian dishes, based on my own experience. Must have the dry chili chicken,hakka noodles and Fried Rice. Overall, serves well to the bachelor pads.

After Receiving Their Tips, they Started behaving In very Rude Manner . the only Reason Was that Our tips To them was Very Less ,as a customer this Is not at all tolerable and we are very Much Disappointed .

Overall this is a good place.The only thing I don't like of this place is the waiters.They have a typical attitude in them.Otherwise its a good place to visit.@

Went here last evening when it was raining here in Kolkata to unwrap a very unpleasant experience. The hotel is small, filthy, terrible managers, no soap to wash hands, no air conditioning, no place for storage of wet umbrellas- they say keep it to yourself on the table, mosquitoes and flies adorn the eatery and finally being dressed in anything but night suit is overdressed for this place. It is located on the small section of the pot hole riddled road that leads to city centre two. I love my food and have great respect for it, but eating at this place was nothing but a horrible and sad experience, beneath all the layers of disappointment, there was no scope to judge their quality of food or even consider it being rated.

Let me be very specific over here since I am giving a review for this restaurant , firstly I'll say this restaurant is just beside shoppers stop ( near city center 2) outlet , and now coming to the hygiene it looked quite clean and a place to have a good meal , then coming to the service I must say they were fast and food was hot and fresh so full marks for that also and now let me say that the food tasted pretty good for the price I paid ( 1 big naan , chicken masala 4 pieces and chicken biryani ) for RS :290 as reasonable as possible therefore
My verdict - go for a good food option here if you are around city center 2@

I'm pretty sure people reading my review would be surprised as to how I even got to know about Jiban Jamuna.
But honestly speaking, I was quite amazed at how good the food tastes going by the nominal price they charge!
We had to order food suddenly, and opted for Chinese. It was pretty good....
Even the naan was soft and tender, which we had ordered the second day, alongwith some other punjabi dishes.
On the whole, the price is reasonable and the food is quite good quantity and quality wise!

Food here is not the worst you would have eaten. But, by the quality of service, attitude of service staff and amount of oil in food the restaurant tries hard to make you feel like that.

Jiban Jamuna is right next to City Centre 2. On the way from airport, it would appear as any modern-day upbeat dhaba - bright neon sign board, decorated patio, outdoor roti and naan counter - all visible from afar and pretty much attractive to the hungry soul.
You enter the place, half expecting a decent decor or AC, but lo and behold it does flaunt an AC and the decor is not bad at all - neat and nice. The menu has Indian, Chinese, and a dash of Mughlai (Biryani, mainly, without which a Calcuttan will not take any eatery seriously).

We ordered a plate of chicken biryani, tandoori rotis and chilly chicken. If i take into account the low pocket pinch and the super generous portion size, I would not dare nit pick about the taste! But I'd be fair - do not expect a fine dining experience, it will not be Arsalan-like biryani or Chilly Wok's chilly chicken. But that said, the taste is pretty decent, and most importantly the quality is good. The rotis were fresh and crispy, the chicken soft and succulent. The service was courteous and prompt. What more can one expect! People from the far-east corner of the city, do pay a visit.

This is a small restaurant for more preferred Indian cuisine. It is located on the heart of rajarhat, near the China r park, on major arterial road. The place is good for casual lunch. Of course there are better options than these, but i particularly like some of the dishes they make here., like the Kashmiri pulav, and the capsicum chicken. This things are quite rare. if you particularly like the Indian cuisine you won't be disappointed, other than that try some Chinese, you will just feel blank.

I normally have their bengali meals - fish thali etc. Food is very good, tastes nice, and affordable. I would love to go back to have my favourite Rui fish thali. Ambience is not good, so do not go if looking for a fancy dinner or lunch. Can do much more with the thali - should add chatni in the thali instead of the curd they provide.
