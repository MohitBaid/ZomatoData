Probably the only place in Kolkata that you can sample African coffee. Quiet enough to work or read with your coffee and the staff doesn’t hover around to distract you. The chairs are comfortable for a long sit down.

Located right beside Fabindia, this is a very comfortable and nice cafe with good decor. 
The drinks and food we ordered all were very good except one- Chilli cheese toast,which was layered with paneer. Other than that,we had-
Chocolate milkshake, hot chocolate with cream, cappuccino with whipped cream.
Basket of fries- Contains an assortment of French fries, smileys, chicken nuggets, chicken cheese nuggets and chicken cheese balls, served with kasundi(mustard sauce) and tomato ketchup. Quite filling. 
Prices are like any other standard cafe. Good experience.

This will be a very short review. After having lunch in the feast Street in the Hindustan Park, we just decided to go there. To have a good adda over a cup of coffee :)

Location:
___________

It is located just beside the Fab India in Hindustan Park.

Decoration:
______________

I would say this is a perfect place where you can spend your time with your friend with some discussion. A perfect calm adda place.

Beverages:
_______________

We only tried some coffee and slush there. So this review is totally based on that. 

✓ Irish Latte - okay type. Less taste of Irish syrup in it.
✓ Green and Lemon Slush - very nice. Quite refreshing. Best among the all we tasted.
✓ Black Current Slush - tasted more like a sweet sour cough syrup. Did not liked it.


As mentioned this review is totally based on the items we tasted. So, to decide anything with this review will not totally justify this cafe.

Yes will surely try their other items in near future.

All that cost 410 INR.

Discovered this place on zomato. We went there yesterday evening and the place was quite empty.The decor is beautifully done.We grabbed a seat for two and ordered our food.Hot chocolate with cream which tasted nothing but bourvita with cream... although quite pleasing to the throat on a rainy evening. And cheese chilli toast which was amazing!They also have two tables outside in case you prefer to smoke or avoid the ac.Nice place to chill with friends and it is located just beside the kookie jar outlet at Hindustan park

This place is the ideal one for a long chat with friends. Went there with my friend. The location is quite confusing. There's sitting arrangement made both  inside ac and outside in the balcony sort of place.We ordered cold coffee with cream and dark fantasy Choco. Along with that we took masala french fries. 
It took around 15 minutes for the order to arrive. The cold coffee with cream tasted great according to my friend and for the dark fantasy, as sinful as it looked, it lived upto my expectations. A chocolate shake topped with brownie and vanilla ice cream. Absolute bliss. The French fries tasted average. 
The staff need to be a bit more swift and active. 
The price is reasonable.

Situated beside FabIndia, Hindustan park. Ambience was good with lovely, neat decoration. As we were not hungry, visited this place to converse over a cup of tea, we orederd masala tea, lemon iced tea and chilli cheese toast. Beverages were good. Toast had ample amount of cheese but I personally prefer some  more chilli. The amount we paid was Rs386 including tax which is a bit on the higher side. The crowd was not much and quite descent. Service was good.

👍 Amole seating, Food
👎 Service little slow.

We went up here in one of the fine evenings of this winter. Ample of seating places!!!
Loved their Idea of two small outdoor tables just on the entrance. Further inside they have a nice seating area and even another seating upstairs. All this places were equally beautiful.. straight coming to food, we liked it. 
It was EGG & CHEESE SANDWICH, BROWNIE, ETHIOPIAN & BRAZILIAN CAPPUCCINO on our table. Sandwich was well stuffed , tasty . Both cappuccino almost tasted same yet BRAZILIAN was a little light to compare. Brownie was a bit dry, some more chocolate sauce would have been perfect to my taste. Though with the minimum pocket pinch everything was pretty nice. 😊

coffee-n-mood is one of the many cafes in this ever awesome great locale of southern avenue. They sure have plenty on offer apart from only Coffee. We had opted to go for cappuccino & chocolate brownie, both were good. Only downside is the pocket pinch which is on the higher side. Choose to sit outdoor in the evening which gives you a great view of the quiet road in front of the cafe.

Decent spot for an evening conversation over some coffee, which didnot impress me much honestly, i had a cup of Cuppaccino , priced at whooping 90 didnot satisfy me . Also the chocolate pastry with sauce looked so chocolatey but exactly lacked the intense chocolate taste which again is some thing i am not going back for.

This cafe is located just beside Fab india, we went there for some adda over coffee and snacks, the service was a bit slow, but the staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered Irish coffee(good), hot chocolate with cream(not bad), Chicken momo(dint like much)  and chicken masala noodles(not noodles but maggi in a creamy sauce with shredded chicken, this was very good). We liked the laid back and calm ambience of the cafe. Pocket pinch was 650. Overall a nice place with good food and good ambience. Will surely go back :)

The ambience is good and you can get a outside table if required. As it was a smoke free Zone inside I proffered to take a seat outside.  The south Africa Honey Tea was wonderful and quite refreshing. Sweet corn soup followed with American mayo and chicken Salsa Sandwich was good. The positive part is you can spent a good time because of the not so crowd area. But remember sometimes cars honk for parking which might irritate you if you are sitting outside.... Overall the experience was good.

I have tried their chicken tikka grilled sandwich, chocolate milkshake and pure chocolate cube pastry.

Masala chai was good , momo stuffing tasted good but the batter of momo was too thick and blueberry cupcake too was okayish . Service for me I found it slow and this place is decently priced.

Visited this cute café today. Extremely pleased with this place and the service. 

Location - Hindustan park. Next to the Fabindia outlet. A vibrant café in the sombre by-lanes of Gariahat. 

The interior is very comfy and cosy, and surprisingly it's very spacious inside. This however, can't be understood from outside. 
We decided to sit in the mezzanine floor. It's prettily done up with yellow lights and comfy couches, and chairs. 

Now coming to the grub :
• Cold coffee - perfectly made, though slightly costlier than any other café. Still, worth it.
• Colombian Cappuccino - nice and frothy. A bit on the bitter side, yet would be any caffeine addict's love. 
• Nacho with cheese dip - the amount of nachos was good. Perfect finger food for a perfect adda. The cheese dip was tasty. 
• Chicken mini kives - 10 mini chicken balls with a smiley fry. The balls were nice and crispy with cheese oozing out from within. Yum.

Pocket pinch - 735! Moderately priced.

Over all a wonderful experience. Perfect place for chilling out over a cup of coffee and some tidbits. Much love. Definitely visiting again.❤

The perfect place to spend quality time with your loved ones and friends. Their menu card is pocket friendly too. We had Chicken penne pasta, Cold coffee, Cappuccino with cream and one sundae. All were good. Coffee items were better than other chain coffee shops.

Its big, decent decor, good seating.. 
The food is also good! 
It was better than what i expected.. 
There are two rooms and even two chairs outside the store just like most CCD outlets! 
The only thing missing is the Soft drinks.. They don't have coke or redbull! 
The pricing is good, affordable and waiters are good too!

Okay First things first- Please update your rates on the Zomato menu as everything seems different on the physical menu!!

Ambiance - Tranquil. Serene. You can sit with your cuppa, relax and enjoy the drizzle outside post your shopping spree at Fabindia & the adjacent Gariahat bylanes. 

Food - Priced slightly on the higher side. Ordered a cup of English Breakfast & an iced tea. Both were quite okayish. Nothing exceptional. Just one suggestion - please dip the teabag only moments before you serve so that the customer can adjust the tea strength according to her choice. The tea was a little strong for me. But the chicken momo we had ordered, was quite on the raw and uncooked side , which after being given the feedback to the staff was replaced with a much cooked plate within couple of minutes without any argument. Hence, appreciated the effort.

Service - Quick. Efficient. Courteous.

Pocket Pinch - 385/- for two inclusive of taxes. 
Recommended only for the service & ambiance.

I usually go for Hazelnut latte. They prepared it well. Staff mannerism is of higher grade and surely very nice and clean place. The food was served on time.

Located in the vicinity of Hindustan park and Southern avenue, beside Fabindia, a decent place to sip n chat. You can refer this place as an alternative to Cafe Coffee day. On a rainy Sunday evening three of us decided to try some mocktails since we were in no mood to eat anything.
Quickly we ordered three drinks and a chilly cheese toast.
Cranberry juice, raspberry soda and syrup mixed to create a nice mocktail of double verry blast.
Known for its cocktail version, the chocolate cherry mocktail contains trace amount of chocolate, lime, vanilla and cola making it an unusual drink.
The pink color Tropical Rush is a sweet syrup concoction and tastes ok.
The chilly cheese toast was an average snack with no recommendations.
In short its a nice place to hangout but a bit pricey for normal mocktails and less options to munch.

Good place to time spend.
Just beside Fabindia. Good coffee break for long marketing.
Regarding foods lots of options with good taste also.
Overall nice experience.

In a nutshell, Coffee N Mood isn't a place that is worthy of landing up in one's temporary gastromic bucket list. But, then, it is pretty decent place you can hang out in, if you are around Hindustan Park area (and its adjoining Fabindia, of course). 

Between the three of us, we had the Double Berry , Tropical Rush  and Chocolate Cherry mocktail, each and I liked all of them. The mocktails were not on sugar syrup steroids, and were quite refreshing. Tropical Rush was pink and sweet, Double Berry was more tangy, and Chocolate cherry was, well, more bold and strong in its taste than the others. 

We ordered a chilli cheese toast and it was average and forgettable. Had it only been on the drinks, I would have rated the place much higher. 

The ambiance is pretty neat, and other than the dubious claim at the back of the menu stating Coffee can cure everything from Parkinson to Cancer, I liked lounging there for an incredibly long time waiting for my friends to turn up, without any waiter hanging around my head for orders. That's quite nice of them, actually.

I visit this place almost every week for official meetings. The beverages are refreshing and they have a range of finger food to choose from. The non veg basket o fries and the English Mayo sandwich is a worth try with your favourite coffee or tea. Prices are quite decent when compared with other coffee joints.

Lovely place. Very nice decorations. Service was quite fast. Welcoming ambience. The cold coffee was made pretty well. Had an icecream like taste to it. The chicken mini kiev are a must try. They were delicious. Price is a bit on the higher side.

I am a big big coffee fanatic and I love visiting the bistros and coffee shops in the city. So, on the recommendation of many of my fellow foodies I went to this place last evening with two of my friends. I ordered a cappucino and my friends ordered masala tea and assam tea along with french fries and english mayo with chicken sandwich. My coffee was amazing and well made while teas were too perfectly balanced and lovely in taste. The amount of the fries were generous ( who doesn't like extra fries??) and the sandwich was big and yummy!! the decor was pretty nice and ambiance was great! The value for money is cent percent out here. I will like to visit this place quite more often, with friends or for solo dates :D and I recommend you to do the same! 
Happy Hogging ;)

This cafe is located realy well in Hindustan park and has some good space inside but I totally think it could be better utilised. It is just ordinarily arranged with some chairs. The food is alright and the price average. It wasnt a huge deal but nonetheless not bad either.

Somewhere between your chain coffee shops and stand alone cha er dokan is coffee n mood. It is clean, comfortable and you can sit back and relax for a while without servers urging you to take something more. Don't expect a fancy brew and you won't be dissatisfied. The cheese chili toast and the basket of fries are worth a try

We wanted to try some cafe other than any popular cafe chain. Hence, it was pre-planned to go for this place COFFEE N MOOD because "Coffee was just an excuse" and our whole purpose of this BIRTH is to serve humanity with our FOOD REVIEWS !! it's ok you may applause later :P Our orders were Watermelon-ice tea, Blue Lovacano Slash, Veg Steamed Momo and Blue Berry Muffins... Well Blue Lovacano looks like Blue Lagoon at 1st sight but the little sips made me realize looks may be deceptive :D I loved that slash..tangy and the texture of well crushed ice and little froth over it are really refreshing.. Veg momos were no different from other joints but I love the spicy dip which which I begged to leave a drop for me and that heartless enemy of mine engulfed is alllll >:( I didn't have to fight for my muffins (thanks to not so sweet loving SATAN).. a perfect Blue Berry Muffins they were Soft, blue berry pulped jelly, neat and clean presentation, the watermelon ice tea tasted like mocktail but after 3-4 sips I got the flavour and aroma of tea.. I was truly amazed. Last but not the I loved their presentation and pocket friendly place, ambiance is peaceful and relaxing I loved that. The only thing I do not like in most of the joints in Kolkata is the WAITING more than 10 minutes... and for the location thanks to our GPS :D

To start off, this is a quite corner of Gariahat at Hindustan Park area and anything like that for me is a positive start.
- The seating and layout is cozy but the cafe is comparatively in a smaller area....
- Never mind that, cause what I have discovered for Kolkata is that compared to branded chain cafes, these standalone cafes are way better, taste much different and good to be at....4/5 for that
- For a muffin, plate of hot momos, chilled watermelon iced tea and blue lovaco slash, it cost ₹500 bucks...a cool 4/5
- For quality and taste, another 4/5
- Messed up the delivery time period though, so 3/5

Overall a decent but CONSERVATIVE ME 3.5/5....cheers👍 definitely worth multiple tries

After returning from "Cloakroom" I saw this coffee shop near Fab India showroom at Hindustan Park. 

I don't know why I missed this but after going there I must say it's a hidden gem. They served plenty of teas, shakes, coffees and lots more. The menu provided on Zomato is very less. 

The deco and ambiance was good also the seating arrangements were vast and divided between two big rooms.

I tried Hot chocolate with cream first and that was so good. 

I also ordered Dark Fantasy Shake. The granular shake with brownie and Cream on top looked good also the tatse was far better than any other outlet near this.

Located beside Fab India, a popular coffee joint in and around this area. Dropped in one day and tried the Cold Coffee and Kievs. The Kievs tasted nice but did not justify the price. The Cold Coffee kind of disappointed me. Honestly, am not fully satisfied with this place. Would still like to come back sometime in the future to see if the rest of their offerings are better than what I have had.

It was a hot day. The summer has arrived bypassing the spring and we were facing the heat. I was rushing from one place to another and I was hot. I went in there in order to get some respite. 
I asked for coffee n mood special. It came in a flash. I gulped it down, so exhausted was I.
It being daytime, the lights were switched off, but the sunlight was sufficient. When I came in the staff switched on the air conditioner and I was cool. But I was yet to cool down and so requested the staff to suggest me something else. He offered cold coffee with caramel and I said ok. That was also great to taste especially since I drank it little by little in order to savour its taste.
The staff was a nice young man with smiling lips.
In normal times in the evening it is crowded. I was lucky I went there in the afternoon, to get a seat of my choice. This shows the popularity of the outlet.

went there today with my friend for quick bite of sandwiches. we ordered INDIAN CURRY CHICKEN SANDWICH and chicken salsa sandwich. and for mocktails .. we ordered tropical rush and green island.. sandwiches were awesome in taste. chicken salsa sandwich tasted better than the other one. 

my personal view >1. prices are little bit high.. 

                                2.no need of nachos in sandwiches.

                                3.chips or french fries would be better with the sandwiches.

The decor is subtle and succeeds in creating a great ambience. The coffee is not overpowering at all and it is a good place to spend time in, alone as well as with people with whom you can strike up a good conversation over coffee. My only complaint is against their chicken submarine sandwich because the quantity if chicken in it was negligible.

Another find of my Kolkata cafe search,tucked in a Hindustan Park lane,just beside d fab India store.
We went in tired from having walked a lot. A nice place with two tables even on the outside. Its not small like d cafes cropping up these days. Comfortable seating arrangement . .good atmosphere.
The prices are very reasonable and they have quite a lot on d menu. We went on and ordered a cold cafe mocha , an iced lemon green tea and a place of fish fingers.

The waiter though he seemed inexperienced was very sweet and courteous .We had a long adda and the drinks and food was good . The quality of fish . .the taste of the mocha . .very satisfying.
Must try . .I'm going back again.

This quaint place lies in a lane off Gariahat and is a part of the FabIndia building. Do check the map for directions.
      The interiors are very homely and cosy and the staff make you feel at home. We were offered many suggestions on which food to order so we finally settled on Chicken Mini-kievs, Indian Curry Chicken Sandwich, Non-veg Momos, Citrus Refresher and Cold Coffee. 
       The service was very prompt and we got our food in a jiffy. I must say, this being a café - the cold coffee and citrus refresher were waay off the mark. Not at all what you would expect.
       The food on the other hand was pretty darn delicious, especially the Mini-kievs and the Sandwich. The momos were so-so ; nothing you wouldn't get anywhere else.
      All in all it was a relaxing café but the quality of the beverages sure does need to improve.

I've been to both the outlets of Coffee N Mood, but this outlet has a larger seating capacity than the one at Lake Road.
It's spacious and simple interiors. They also have outdoor seating.
I've had mixed experiences at this cafe. We ordered for a red sauce pasta and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was delicious and the pasta was also well prepared. The second time I made a visit it was early in the morning and the only thing available was sandwich. It was Horrible !! I couldn't have it all.
One suggestion to all, do not visit this place in the morning when the chef isn't present.

This place is hidden inside a bylane of Hindustan Park and finding this place is a pain as neither the Facebook page nor Google map tells the exact location. The place is always empty and the food options are very limited. I ordered a chicken burger which was rubbery chewy and the bread seemed stale. The watermelon iced tea had neither the flavour of watermelon nor tea, just sugary. The momos were the only saviour. The staff was clueless when I complained about the food and there was no manager to solve out the problems. All in all, I wouldn't be willing to spend time and money in a place which is absolutely average with it's ambience and food. The only variety this place offered was comedy nights but apparently that has discontinued now suddenly!

This quaint place lies in a lane off Gariahat and is a part of the FabIndia building. Do check the map for directions.
      The interiors are very homely and cosy and the staff make you feel at home. We were offered many suggestions on which food to order so we finally settled on Chicken Mini-kievs, Indian Curry Chicken Sandwich, Non-veg Momos, Citrus Refresher and Cold Coffee. 
       The service was very prompt and we got our food in a jiffy. I must say, this being a café - the cold coffee and citrus refresher were waay off the mark. Not at all what you would expect.
       The food on the other hand was pretty darn delicious, especially the Mini-kievs and the Sandwich. The momos were so-so ; nothing you wouldn't get anywhere else.
      All in all it was a relaxing café but the quality of the beverages sure does need to improve.

I've been to both the outlets of Coffee N Mood, but this outlet has a larger seating capacity than the one at Lake Road.
It's spacious and simple interiors. They also have outdoor seating.
I've had mixed experiences at this cafe. We ordered for a red sauce pasta and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was delicious and the pasta was also well prepared. The second time I made a visit it was early in the morning and the only thing available was sandwich. It was Horrible !! I couldn't have it all.
One suggestion to all, do not visit this place in the morning when the chef isn't present.

Just beside Hindustan Park Fabindia, Coffee N Mood is just like some 50 other cafes out there in Kol. Nothing extraordinary decor, but very neat and comfortable a cafe with decent staff. We ordered Cappuccino and Chicken mini kives (cheese rolled inside) and their service was very fast! Food quality is quite good but the price is bit high along with the taxes considering the fact that it's a non themed cafe! But nevertheless you can always give it a try :)

A few weeks back, I went there after watching a morning show at priya with my girl friend. It was her choice. From the outside, it looks like a tiny coffee shop but it has an upstairs too. At a time it can accommodate 30-40 people. We chose upstairs and it was only us over there. Lovely interior I must say. Very sober and sweetly arranged things which appeared to be too soothing. There were sofas, cane chairs. There was a nice mixing of traditional and modern aromas.
I completely fell in love with coffee n mood. We ordered  chicken salsa sandwich, chicken kheema omlette, chicken momo and lemon fresh jal jeera. The quality is very good. Usually I don't like sandwich but that day I took it and trust me it is good. Omlette and momos were also up to the mark. The staffs were good as well. I will distribute the marks as following:

Food: 4.5
Interior: 5
Price: 4
Behavior of Staffs: 5

I don't have that much affinity towards cafes but I personally like and recommend this place for everyone. Lots of love for coffe n mood :)

Less crowd, uncluttered look, good service, tasty beverage, food and desserts...Coffee & Mood is a convincing coffee shop for chilling out. 

You wont feel the pinch in your pocket for all those tasty items in the menu card and you can keep coming back here. 
Sitting on the upper floor is more choiceable as its more comfy.  
The desserts, omelettes and momo are surely recommendable.

Coffee n Mood might not be well know but these guys can make you a CHEESE CHICKEN OMELET which is to die for. The food is very good. Easy on the pocket.
Good food. Good ambience, Coffee N Mood is highly recommend if you are looking for a cafe where you want to sit and chill with friends or even alone.

Good coffee and soothing ambience with comfy seating , this joint is located beside fabindia in hindustan park. They have free wifi , Newspapers and their menu contains almost every snacks one would like to have with tea or coffee. They even have tasty steamed momos. I like their darjeeling tea and cold coffee.

Camouflaged in the treelines and buildings of Hindustan Park alleyway, this place lies about with a beautiful outdoor seating having only one table. You swing open the doors and the dark conversation couches and hardwood floors sooth your eyes. Had you been an interior decorator you would have loved the ambiance. But you are here for eating. Aren't you?
Pros:
1. Ambiance
2. Menu variety
Cons:
1.Quantity!
2. A tad bit costly. The pocket pinch will hurt you.
If you want to meet somebody this is a great place to meet and have conversations over coffee.

Homely appearance. Candor indoors. 
We ordered 7-8 items. Mocktails. Starters. Mocha. Till desert. Best was the last, no doubt. That Choco La Vanilla. Garlic Breads were awesome as well. Green Island was refreshing. Pasta worth trying. Well, can't brag more! Deserves a visit. :)

I have visited both of the outlets couple of times, one being just adjacent to the vivekananda park close to kamala girls and the other is located beside Fab India of Hindustan park. The Hindustan park one is a bit bigger in space than the vivekananda park.
Good ambience, good seating, good food....overall a good place to spend time. I have had the chicken momo, chicken sandwich...but my fav till date is the veg basket; yummy assortment of deep fried veg snacks. They have various flavour of delicious coffee. I always prefer the aampanna lemonade.
PS approx 600 bux for 2ppl

After your too many Cafe Coffee Days and Lavazzas, if you want to have coffee the way it should be drank, in sips and blows and with good conversation, I suggest you drop by at this place. My boyfriend and I usually spend our 'laid-back' coffee dates here. Spacious with comfortable seating arrangements, courteous servers and a spread-out menu which has some really great drinks, definitely govern our moods to drop by here often. 

So drop in and have a good conversation while you sip some great coffee and munch on some wonderful finger foods.

Recently decided to check out the cafe,  but was taken by surprise with the taste of the food,  the one thing I really liked about this place is they have kept it very simple with the decor nothing fancy and jazzy wich is great tho the outside seating is a bit cramped up but noting to worry it's not bad, now The food - all the nonveg lover's a must try is the coffee n mood special omelette and for the drinks would like to recommend the exclusive ice teas they have and the lassi the food menu is very interesting,  it's a great place to go with family friends and family it mite be a bit heavy on.the pocket for certain dishes but once in a while hanging out at coffee n mood is not a bad idea

After all the insipid Baristas and Coffee Day, I discovered the Best cold coffee in Gariahat area at this outlet beside FabIndia at Hindustan Road. The Cold coffee without Ice-cream and Whipped cream is itself thick, frothy and flavourful.
Also ordered Double Berry Mocktail. It had Blueberry and Raspberry with tea and soda...a pleasureable explosion of taste.

The 'upstairs' with its chilled AC and cozy sofa was a peaceful getaway from the Jamai Sashthi rush of Gariahat Market.  Ambience is peaceful and the cane furniture is comfortable. There are some potted plants to add to the serenity. Staff is discreet. Worth a revisit to sample the food too.

We are a regular visitor. For just coffee or for a quick snack - we prefer this place over other coffee joints - mostly for its affordable pricing and reasonable variety of snacks. The sitting area is never too crowded. Theres another sitting area - few stairs up the main area - which is very cozy and relaxing to sit around for some time.
One suggestion - keep things simple. When someone asks for a plain muffin with tea - no need to pour ice cream and chocolate sauce on the muffin to make it fancy.

Yesterday I and my friend went there because both of us were craving milkshakes. We ordered the dark chocolate milk shake ... and omg. .. best milkshake ever. :)
We loved it. However my friend was particularly irritated by the music which was very honestly terrible. Sans the music a 5/5 coffee shop :D

A great find! Lovely ambience! I loved the fact that there was no blaring music and the 3 of us could enjoy our food, relax and talk for such a long time without any disturbance! The food was heavenly! We had cappuccinos and cold coffee with chocolate, along with chicken kives and chicken pasta in white sauce! One plate of chicken kives has 10 pieces and the pasta is enough for 3 people! Staff behaviour is very good! I am going back there again and again and again! The decor is very relaxing and soothing! Totally my new favourite hang-out joint! Very easy to locate too, just beside FabIndia in Gariahat!

Second experience

I took my friend there and she loved the nice and quiet ambience and staff behaviour! And the brownie with ice cream!

Third experience

Fish fingers and basket-o-fries not impressive. Liked the sundae.

As we were looking for a cafe nearby while walking down the gariahat road...zomato suggested this place. It's a spacious cafe that also provides a small province of outdoor seating. We went inside to seek more warmth though. 

The staffs were patient and courteous. I can say that because we kept asking them to come back after minutes everytime they came to take the order. They never showed any sign of irritation. 

Finally we ordered hot chocolate and brownie with ice cream. The hot chocolate was thick and tasted perfect. The brownie was fine but the ice cream dint taste very good. Moreover they took extra charge for the ice cream unlike that mentioned in the menu card. That was disappointing. Still I would like to come back and give this place another try owing to it's ambience which I liked pretty much.

I loved this cofee shop. The good thing about this cafe is that its simple and has a nice ambience. Located in a very peaceful area and u will get the serene feeling out there. I ordered a chicken salsa grilled sandwish which was served with nachos. french fries served in a basket, and a hot mocha which was absolutely delicious that made me order for another one for the second time. Quantity and quality are both good. And I felt very satisfied with their service, I am looking forward to visit here soon and make it as a choice of regular visit.

Again a new coffee shop! 
Ambiance: Very smart strategy to place it just beside Fab India, Hindusthan Park road. Tired shoppers (like me) can stop by the shop to relax and chit-chat for a while. I  felt that I stepped into someone's house and not in a (conventional) coffee shop. Decor is really attractive and not cliched. (4/5)

Food: Very ordinary. They serve coffee with different international names but with the same taste. Quantity of food is too less compared to the huge price. (2/5)

Service: Highly disappointed! I was almost about to sleep! There was not much crowd inside still the wait was like never-ending. Extremely slow service- need to improve a lot (1/5)

Value for money: On the perspective of food- not at all value for my money. But if you want to chat and spent time for long hours then its a very good place to stop by. The waiters will never tell to vacate even if you have finished your food long back. (3/5)

Coffee N Mood is a place where i would just go back for the heavenly cold coffee . The cold coffee (without ice cream) was yummmm . We had a chicken salsa sandwitch . It was yummy , wholesome and served with nachos . The cheese garlic bread was just average . The ambience is good and the service is fast . The extra cheese dip that we ordered was not too good :-/ overall a good experience and the cold coffee is a must.

I just loved the ambience of this place. Its super cosy. Other than that the cold coffee with chocolate sauce that I ordered was of decent quality. Plus there is free wifi which makes the place all the more better :)

a peaceful and soulful place with simple yet classy decor, pleasant ambiance and good food. 
the stuff is attentive and well behaved.
food is worth the money.
the citrus refresher and basket o' fries (non veg) is an absolute must have.
avoid the choco berry drink. not worth spending money.
food : 4/5
ambiance : 4.5/5
decor :4.5/5

Coffee N Mood - Didn't really have a great experience here. 
=========
Intro: After my first visit in their other branch which is located near Tutu's Hut, i had really great expectations from this branch. However, when i went to this place. This place was also quite well designed with 4 doors. One was the usual place to sip a cup of coffee, one a private area which comes after climbing few stairs, one is the staff billing section and the last one is the staff area. The decor was simple yet nice. When i went there, i don't know there was this pungent smell which had twirled around the whole cafe. On asking the staff, he said it's from the kitchen and somehow hurried up and made sure that the things are back to normal. Nevertheless, my first impression went a little down about this place. The staffs were not well aware of whats going on, whats on the menu and how to treat a customer well enough so that he comes back again. 
=========
Ordered:

1) Double Apple Mocktail - The mocktail was decent with syrup used. Nothing extraordinary and simply prepared.

2) Veg Steamed Momo - The steamed momo's were 'kaccha'. They were not perfectly steamed and even the tomato spice blended dip served with it was too tangy to the palate. It really spoilt my mood as they had only few items on the veg and that also they messed up the simple momo. The dishes i was asking was not available. 

3) Chicken Lollipop - This was a DISASTER. Never order this. The chicken was not properly fried and was raw to taste. Plus, it was the usual frozen packet chicken which i had tasted from the spencers. The staffs didn't know how to cook it properly plus the lollipop stick in one of the chicken piece was not properly separated with the meat. It's a sheer negligence of the staff and it really upset my stomach very very bad and thus created a negative impression in the mind. 

4) Brownie with Ice Cream - Decent enough. Had better before in many other reputed Cafes. 
=========
Pros: 
1) ambience is good.
2) simple place where deep conversations can take place. 

Cons:
1) Staffs should be more trained. They don't have much idea on what is being served from the kitchen.
2) Chicken Lollipop was raw and it was a disaster. Never ever serve raw stuffs to anyone. It really pissed my mood off and also caused me stomach upset. 
3) Should not unnecessary bloat the menu. 
=========
Meal for two: 500-700 max
=========
Summary: 
Food quality 2/5
Hospitality 1.7/5
Ambience 3.7/5
Value for money 2/5
=========
Conclusion:
I would not like to come here again on this branch specially because of the hospitality and the quality of chicken lollipop.

Note: Pictures to be attached shortly

Located in Hindusthan Park just next to Fab India this is the latest Coffee shop in the place. The ambiance of this place is very good , very well decorated. You can spend a lazy time here, as this place is not so crowdie like known places like CCD and Barista! The service is also fast here and the behavior the staffs are also good. 
They have a large choice of beverages, which I liked. My recommended beverage would be Coffee n Mood special fantasy. The tea qualities are also nice. If you are a fan of smoothie, you muost definitely try mango smoothie,Chicken sandwich if you are hungry and if it is a hot summer noon do not miss and definitely order their aam paana

I was rather going to a different cafe in the neighbourhood when I came across this one, so we went inside, it looked preety elite, with the leather couches and minimal yet classy décor. The Wi-Fi came handy with the food. Me and my friend was in a mood to have just coffee, so we chose one Cappuccino, one Irish coffee and French fries to go with it. The coffees were pretty decent but the French fries deserve special mention, it was a whole basket full of French fries, and included a smiley too, more than enough calories for two girls who are trying their best to control carbohydrate intake. :P

All in all, I would be back very soon, I guess that quite summarises my experience.

Ofcourse the beverages are a bang on.. but they lack options for food. Sandwiches I dint wanna have. So it was chicken mini kives. What was good was the smoothies.. we were looking for  citrus refresher, lemon masala shoot, but it wasnt available so we took in chocolate cherry, double berry n a chilled mocha. N it was mind blowing. Especially the double berry one. I would surely go in to taste new smoothies.

An average place with above average sandwich. 
This locality surely is in need for more such hangout places where one can just sit alone or with company over a cuppa and a snack or two. This one is situated beside FabIndia  in Hindustan Park. There is an open table outside for the smokers. I personally like the idea of having an open area in these cafes, and with only one such option is sad. The interior is sleek and stylish keeping the warm feel alive. The ambiance is also nice given the sound box musing SRK hits all through the drenched afternoon. 
Coming to the food. Not being a coffee person I settled for the mock-tail section with Citrus refresher and my friend opted for Green Island. The mock-tails were good and refreshed our mood. Then we plodded our way to the sandwich section with Chicken Submarine and Chicken Salsa Sandwich. Sandwiches are served with nachos , ketchup and mustard dip. The Chicken Submarine was spicy and had a perfect balance of citrus and heat. While the Chicken Salsa sandwich had shredded chicken in a salsa dressing.. All in all I loved the food. 
The staff here is well informed about their menu and would guide you through the menu well. 
A good experience I would say

This review finds myself in one of those rare situations when I am happy to chew my words. I had previously been to their outlet in lake road and terribly turned off by the service and a non functioning ac in an air tight room…. And thus it took a few weeks lag that I visited their other otlet in hindustan park just beside fabindia .  The seating arrangement in the mezzanine floor was comfortable and cosy ,the staff were really polite and good I loved my CHILLED MOCHA and NACHOS (the quantity you get for that price is real good) …and what was best is that they allow their customers to be at ease and leisure as is expected in a proper coffee shop and never came buzzing around .i had a lovely laid back evening there and am definitely going back this time with a favourite story book of mine !

Below average. The coffee was too sweet. The chicken nuggets were simply fried Mc Cain. Nothing extra ordinary

Average place with the normal things which are available in any coffee shop... does not have any kind of extra USP or anything... i guess they trying to look into the local crowd more than anything... another thing this place closed at 10 when we went there... but zomato shows that it closes at 11... i just had a Morocco mint tea... which was priced at 70 bucks.. which was fair.. but the tea was again just about average... also they have only a seat for 2 in the outside in the smoking zone... which is another let downer... all in all an ok place to go to and chill...
