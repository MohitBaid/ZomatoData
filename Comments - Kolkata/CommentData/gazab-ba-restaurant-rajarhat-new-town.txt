I ordered for home delivery mutton biryani, chilly chicken, fried rice and noodles the Chinese items were still bit edible had to throw the biryani 
Horrible food quality and when I called to about the poor  service they tried to justify it by telling how many packets or plates they sell every day.

Very poor delivery services.
Ordered dal makhni, dal fry, steam rice, mix veg andbtandoori roti. Taste was satisfactory except the tandoori roti. Never get tandoori roti delivered, you cant eat it if it has become.

Crispy Babycorn was not good. it was not crispy and too spicy. looks like they have delivered chilli babycorn instead of crispy babycorn.

The restaurant is very close to my place, and I order takeaways from this place almost everyday.

The food quality is very decent, and pricing is quite nominal. Never had any complaints till date. The seating arrangements are limited as area is small.

To begin with the delivery was 20 minutes in advance( Good job zomato runners) 
Pros about the restaurant 
Economical 
Packaging fair 
Delivery time was appreciable 
Gravy was in abundance 
All rates are GST inclusive 


Tastes ok types 
Cons 
Chicken piece was more of bones and less flesh 
A funny thing I noticed the restaurant charges you Rs 25 for delivery and 26 for packaging (this couldn't be co related)  
Last time ordered a dish n that was unavailble had to wait for 10 mins before people sorted it out.... This time it was better.

Worst place i ever visited....looks like the word ambiance is not in their dictionary....you can see the kitchen from the table and its full of mud....waiters come in and out of kitchen and all the mud on their shoes gets on the floor.....food quality is also worst....spending money on egg chicken roll is also waste of money...never ever try their thali....i.e veg as well as non veg.....only when i dont have any other option only then I order chicken biryani from there....and that too I bring it to home as I cant eat from such a place....

I only had few delivery experience. Food quality is average. Delivery time is not what day promised. If you are ordering water or coke. They don't care about the brand you buying always sent the cheapest ones. Overall bad experience

Bad food taste and quality. Worst delivery. The delivery boy uses cheap language, provides torn note as change and doest not carry any other note to change except the torn one. They take ₹20 delivery charge for shortest distance and still asked us to leave the change amount as he only had torn note.
Very disappointed. Not hygienic also.

Very Good Restaurant with proper service and food quality. All the items listed in the Restaurant brochure are always available for quality serving. Owner by default is a kind hearted person. Never loses his mind and track orders as to serve bulk orders in a convenient and efficient way. Food order for home delivery below Rs.- 200/- costs Rs.- 20/-  for each. Updated menu brochure is attached for general view.

We ordered food  from this small restaurant. Good taste, great quantity and cheap. The chicken fried rice  was enough for two people. The taste of the mixed hakka noodles were to the point, crispy chicken was really good. Perfect crispness and spiciness. Fish fingers were good too. We had ordered another chicken dish, I don't remember the name, but the taste was excellent. All these in 480 bucks. Would totally recommend it.
