A quick bites joint located just outside of Metropolis Mall. Have had chicken roll and egg roll from here. My mother likes them. I however don't think much about them. Egg roll was decent,chicken roll was a bit chewy. Service is quick. Rolls are a bit overpriced.

Very average quality of food... I was watching this joint for long, but not got the chance to try something from here... ultimately that happened yesterday... and happened not that good... most of their items get finished... so we opted for one chicken roll... not at all good... very dry and the chicken was chewy too... packed some egg chowmin and chilli chicken... and both were nearly tasteless... they scored most of with good staff behavior and quick service... pocket pinch was ok...

Food is good. Quantity is also fine. 
But the staff's behaviour needs improvement.
Price is little on the higher side , but everything is little priced higher at metropolis.

I tried their roll once when I visted Metropolis. And the quality was below average. Prices are much higher.
Didn't have the courage to try anything else after tasting the rolls. Can't say about other items.
But the quais low. Not recommend.

Not goo! Located just outside highland park mall. Roll prices are on higher side and service is also slow. I didn't like the taste much too. Expect curry items to be served very late

Situated near metropolish mall..one of my favourite food joints. They make the best rolls in this locality..I love their chicken kabab rolls,cost 50 rupess..with 5 kababs inside,full with flavours and the rolls r quite big in size. I have also tried their chowmin,moglai,chilli chicken and lollipops. Each and every item is fingerlicking and served hot and fresh,they never dissapointed me. The price is a bit high..but its ok if u lovvvveee spicy food. I will highly recommend this place to evryone.

This outlet is basically a fast food centre located just outside metropolis mall. This place is ideal for a quick bite and just before we were about to enter the mall for a movie we had a sudden craving for rolls and this place turned out to be our saviour.  We had the egg chicken roll which was very good with generous proportions of chicken and they took just 2 minutes to prepare it which was very fast, but it was a bit overpriced as 2 rolls costed us RS 120.
