A must try! All the flavours r just yum. I have ordered on a number of occasions and it has been appreciated by all. Moreover when compared to its price...i think it has the most competitive rate in town. Go for it guys.

Definitely the best customized cake baker in town! I have ordered cakes for many special occasions, be it my daughter's birthdays or our anniversary. Every time Frosty Bakes managed to turn my ideas into a beautiful and delicious cake, which was not only beautiful to look at but also tasted amazing. And there are so many flavours to choose from and even special seasonal flavours, be it Nolen Gur or Alphonso mango. Double thumbs up to Frosty Bakes!
