Very cheap but decent Bengali homely food options can be found here. I have never been to the outlet but we order food regularly from here. Their mutton curry is extremely good. They prepare some authentic dishes like Paatshaaker Bora which I doubt can be seen in any other Bengali food joint. The best part is that their preparations are very light on one's stomach. Only negative thing is their Jhuri Aloo Bhaja which needs to be more thin and crispy.

This is 100 years old pice hotel or bhater hotel or authentic bengali eating house in Lake Market area of South Kolkata. Food is served on kola-pata (banana leaf). Food quality is no doubt good and pocket friendly. The unique thing about this hotel is its one of the old employee's live commentary about the foods served on atleast 15 tables like a rhythmic mantra! Hats off to him!

A small well maintained restaurant just a few steps from lake mall. It gives the feeling of the old heritage restaurants that is fading away fast,  the food is delicious and extremely cheap, and we get to have different varieties of fries and fishes which is usually found. One of my favourite spot for bengali food. It had just the feeling of home.
