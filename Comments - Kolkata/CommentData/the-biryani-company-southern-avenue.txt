Ordered from the biriyani company, southern avenue today for dinner! Delivery took 30 minutes. Here is the biriyani review

Mutton Special Biriyani : It was pretty decent. Big chunks of tender mutton pieces tasted great. Quantity was okay for two. Biriyani was good. So, I was happy!! All in all, a good experience.

The restaurant is quite easy to find and the man who served us was very polite and cordial. However, the seating is very less. Anyway, we ordered a special chicken biriyani and chicken bharta. It was totally worth the price and the quantity was more compared to what they serve in  other restaurants. I was quite happy with my experience there. Hoping to visit  again.

The Biryani company is one company which is doing pretty good. And they have enough reasons to walk the talk. The home delivery service is prompt and the food they serve lived upto the expectations. Biryani was good with more than healthy chunks of meat in it. The Reshmi kebab was spot on. But the show stealer for me, personally speaking, was the Galouti kebab. To summarise: Good place (no doubts regarding the multiple very good reviews here on Zomato), and enough reasons to defend their position. Keep it up.

When I went to this place, I didn't find the place matching with those I saw in Zomato. They told me that the main restaurant is now changed the name but the kitchen is same. The ambiance was okay-ish. Coming to the food, we ordered tikka kebab, chicken tandoori, special biryani, chicken chaap and firni. The food was upto the mark and the quantity was good too. But I found the staff to be a bit inefficient.

The Biriyani Company has been serving Kolkatans delicious Mughal cuisine for the last few years , without compromising on the health quotient ! We were invited to the Southern Avenue outlet recently to taste a few of their signature dishes , over an adda with the ever welcoming owners and some fellow food lovers! The Southern Avenue Outlet can be easily located from Rashbehari crossing and is a stone throw away from Mudiali Club. 
Soon after the food flow started . The first item to make a delicious appearance was the Ulta Tawa Paratha  along with Galauti Kebab! The paratha was mesmerising , thin and super crunchy and the galauti was at it’s best... melt in your mouth . The flavour was just right with a magnificent blending of the spices and the meat . 
The next item to reach the palate was the Chicken Kalmi kebab ! The kebabs were soft and nice .This was followed by the magnum opus The Mutton Biriyani with the Chicken Champ on the side. The first thing that I noticed about the biriyani was the fragrance . It immediately brought back the hunger pangs and made the mouth water , the meat in it was well cooked as well. The champ tasted nice and the gravy went well with the Biriyani . 
By this time we were already quite full , but the next items were definitely not to be ignored , the Malabar Paratha and the Mutton Rezala . A culinary speciality of South India , Malabar Paratha stood out in it’s own glory and was accompanied well with the Rezala . The Mutton was soft and tender and the gravy flavourful ! The entire experience was sealed with a serving of the delicious Firni which is again highly recommended .
A great experience overall and do go there for  the Biriyani , Mutton Rezala , Ulta Tawa paratha and Galauti Kebab .

In the city of joy, also the city that loves good food, you will hardly be forgiven for selling substandard food, that too at an overpriced rate. Even so different standards of biryani are found, some more popular, some less. However, garlic pieces in ur kesri halwa makes this a food crime!! I have never ever ever had halwa with garlic pieces in it.. if u followed some recipe that says so , I question ur sensibility to be a commercial eatery and if it was an accident... I question ur basic mental functioning to touch anything edible to prove ur culinary skills! If selling bad quality food was a crime, ud be facing the same verdict as dhononjoy!

The Biryani Company is about 4 years, and 6 outlets old. The plan is to add more outlets under their glory. 
An entrepreneur who converted his vision into reality. A place where you can eat to your heart's content without compromising on health. We were invited for a food tasting, and we tried the following. 
Ulta Tawa Paratha - Crisp, light, non-oily, crunchy parathas. The galauti kebabs were placed atop the parathas. So, every mouthful had a bit of the kebabs and the paratha. The kekebs were melt in the mouth galautis. The perfect ratio of spices and meat was maintained. Top it up with a green chilli, and some onion - you're set for the evening.
This was followed by the Kalmi Kebab - a tangri style chicken kebab served with mint chutney and onion salad. 
Then appeared the biriyani, the showstopper dish of the evening. The saffron biriyani was fragrant and the long grained rice was beautifully prepared. The biriyani was so light, and every morsel was delightful and not heavy on your stomach. The chicken chap was served on the sides. The chap weighed more on the sweeter side, but the color and the gravy and the taste is at par with any of the bigger outlets.
The icing on the cake was the mutton rezala, and the malabar paratha. The mutton was so soft, and the gravy perfect. Pure, pristine white gravy dipped with the paratha made for a wondrous meal in itself. 
Simple menu, quick service, well planned, good taste, humble owners, a good evening spent at TBC. the decor is not something to look forward to, very minimalist. The taste makes up for everything else. We also highly recommend the phirni - it is not granular. It can be very easily scooped out, and melts in your mouth. The best phirni ever tasted!

Food was good in taste and quantity and that's all good about this place. I entered the place and it was completely empty, I asked for the washroom they suggested me to go to the next restaurant maybe owned by the same owner and use the toilet there. Neatly, they switched the air conditioner on, served the biryani after heating it in microwave, I could feel the uneven temperature of the food. The room got completely cold and soothing after we ordered phirni, it was uncomfortable before that. But sadly they charged all the taxes too, with no luxury whatsoever. Not a pleasant experience. Though, the biryani was good.

Biryani Company is serving a seriously sinful requirement. You know it’s sinful but would still you go for it and the reason is the zing and the taste. It’s another chain of restaurants where they have around 6 outlets around Kolkata. Each outlet is a small one with limited seating capacity and an AC, but nothing fancy. I was invited for a food tasting session at their Mudiali outlet and this review is purely based on the same dinner. After long time, I found a restaurant which uses top graded ingredients and raw materials. The Galawati Kebabs that were served on Ulte tawa ki parantha, were slightly customized as per local tastebuds. We could actually feel the meat rather than the masala and that has made the difference. Texture-wise, they were near perfect and smooth. I’d suggest to put them inside the parantha and have them like that. The Chicken Kalmi kebab was nothing great and can easily be avoided or rather another portion of Galawati Kebab can be ordered.

The mutton biryani combo is another great option for single guests like me where they offered half portion of mutton biryani (half potato and 1 neat piece), some chicken bharta (extremely good), 1 fulka and raita, salad. At 230/- per portion, this one's definitely recommended

Biriyani is one of the most adored dishes in Bengal & probably in India. The city of Kolkata has innumerable no of joints serving Biriyani. So, if you want to stand out in the crowd, you have to be a bit special. So, here comes The Biryani Company for you. Tucked in at the same lane as of Mudiali, this is basically a small joint. Please do not expect a classy décor, soothing ambience here. Come here only for good food. We were invited as a part of Bloggers’ meet at the venue and we joined as a part of Team Mohamushkil. Now, I will go directly to the food items.

Beverage & Starter: We had Butter milk, served at table. It was really refreshing in taste. You can feel the flavor of very finely chopped coriander leaves, ginger pieces & crushed pepper in it. Then came the Chicken Kalmi kebab. The size of one piece is descent enough. The chicken was soft & succulent in taste. The flavor was not over dominating. Overall a good starter to try out here. The next item was Mutton Galawati kebab which was served with Lucknawi paratha. There’s a thing with their Galawati kebab. Apart from being the traditional melt-in-mouth kebab item, it has the flavor of mutton quite intact in the same. The masala / marinate is not overpowering the true essence of mutton from the dish (this is very unlikely of Galawati kebabs of other food joints in Kolkata). A must try here.

Main Course: First came the claimed show stopper of the day – The Mutton biryani. To put it very straight - it is the lightest & most fresh Biryani I ever had. Upon enquiring, we came to know they do not use any added flavor, added color to the item. Even they do not use dalda in it. The ghee which they use that is also freshly brought from farm. So, no way it will be heavy on your tummy. The mutton piece was moist, juicy & perfectly cooked. Now, honestly speaking; I personally prefer the heavy & more masaledaar version of Biriyani. But, if you prefer light & flavorful biriyani which is not heavy; ‘The Biryani Company’ is the place in Kolkata you should opt for. Next came the Chicken Champ. Well, it complemented the taste of Biriyani. Even though, separately it had a bit of sweet texture, the chicken piece is so much soft & silky that I seldom had anywhere. The next item that came through is the Mutton Rezala with Malabar paratha (these are newly introduced & not yet updated in the ). Now, take my words. This is one of the best Malabar paratha I have ever eaten. Forget Kolkata, even in my 2 years of stay in South India, seldom I tasted better Malabar Paratha. For me this was the real show-stopper. The Mutton Rezala was apt & went well with the Paratha. 

Finally, we had Phirni as the reward to our sweet tooth. It was suitably made but, nothing to go gaga about it. 

Final words, in Kolkata, it is your go to place when you crave for flavorful biriyani but, don’t want to go heavy on your stomach. No extra preservatives are added to the food here & all the ingredients are fresh . For me, I can keep coming back to this joint only for the Malabaar paratha.

They say, small things come in big packages! And they are right. The Biryani Company aka TBC is about 4 years old, and has currently 6 outlets all over the city. 
We visited their Southern Avenue branch, and the food is all we could rant about. Stoic, crisp menu, and aptly so because that is how they justify their excellent food standards. 
Must try - Their ulta tawa paratha with galouti kebabs. These kebabs are absolute melt in the mouth kebabs where the ratio of spices and meat is beautifully maintained, followed by a tangri kebab. The tangri kebab was soft, and well marinated.
Their saffron shahi biryani and that mutton - one could never have a plateful of that! Must try, with their chicken chap. The chap is on the sweeter side but complements your biriyani.
Another combo that took our stomach away, their malabar paratha and mutton rezala. And of course, their firni could not be far behind, another masterpiece from their kitchen. 
A place where you can eat without torturing your tummy, or your health because the do not use dalda. It is only cooked in white oil, and freshly prepared!

Had it app delivered today. The mutton in biryani was just bones! The packets were small yet still not full. The artificial flavor was too strong and it was extra oily. Will never appeal to a biryani connoisseur. Best enjoyed by young biryani freaks who don't 
care about quality, possibly.  So I'll never order from them again unless reassured otherwise

First time tasted their biryani..before that we used to have biryani only from aminia or arsalan.I must say it is way better than all of them specially because of the less oil and excellent aroma.It is light and doesnt have that greasy feeling...I strongly recommend biryani company to all.

Yesterday we visited The Biryani Company, Garia branch for the first time to dine and also to collect take away. I spoke to the manager and told him this is our first time so how is it? He said "we are the best in Kolkata in terms of biriyani and kebabs. Nobody can match our quality. When you eat here, you will forget Arsalan, Aminia, Oudh etc." We ordered for Galawti Kebab one plate for starters, 2 small pieces of round shaped minced meat which was burnt came after 25 minutes. It was cold and it only tasted salty. Pathetic is the only word which i can think of, and for that I paid Rs.180. Then we ordered for Chicken Reshmi kebab (which was non spice but when delivered, it was so spicy that my son could not eat a bite, 6 pieces costed around 200), mutton bhuna boneless (we were told it is shredded mutton, one portion is fine for 3, when we opened the box, we saw only 5 small shredded pieces, and it costed us Rs.260. We ordered 1 Special Mutton Biryani (Rs.270) and 1 Mutton Biryani (Rs.170), which was tasteless, it was as if we were eating rice, mutton, the size of the piece was horrible and 1 half boiled egg). To add on to this, the behavior of few staff members were atrocious. They were rude, not at all hygenic, I even told the Chef that Galawti was bad, he said, at times it happens. I was surprised to know that they do not cook food there, it came from central kitchen, thats why we had to wait for 45 minutes for the biryani as it was on its way in Van. Overall one of the worst experience of my life. Pathetic, poor quality, service at his worst, To sum up, I will recommend everybody not to go this place, its a total waste of time, money and energy.

Awadhi cuisine in Kolkata got another new destination named "The Biryani Company ". 
It all started just few years back with initially 4 outlets in town. Dining fascility is available at their Mudiali and Patuli outlet, while the others have only takeaway fascility as of now.

The other day , we a blogger group had got the opportunity to visit their Mudiali outlet, next to which they have also newly added their Coastal Food Restaurant called " Pappanam "

Food at Biryani Company was authentic , well prepared and it reflected the true food passion of its owner Mr. Saugata Banerjee, who himself has travelled places and keeps a deep interest in world cuisine. He was also a perfect host in the evening and came across as a very nice and friendly person. 

The Galouti kebab served with mini Lachha paratha did absolute justice to its Lucknawi fame. It was perfectly cooked with right blend of spices and good quality minced lamb, which just melted in ones mouth.
The Chicken Kalmi Kebab also had the nice charcoal flavour and it was quite flavourful and soft.

In the main course, we had Mutton Biryani , Mutton Nalli Rezala and Chicken Chaap.
The biryani was good, served with a large soft mutton piece, potato and egg, but I personally would have been happier it had a little more flavour and aroma to it. Also, at times the rice felt a little dry.
The Mutton Nalli Rezala though was just awesome, infact after a long time we got such a nice mouth watering one in Kolkata. Lovely tender succulent Lamb portions cooked in perfect spices in dum style,.
The Chicken chaap was also nice and well cooked, and its rich gravy tasted perfect with the paratha served along with it.
We finished our dinner with Firni, which was quite nice and gave us the right sweet ending to the sumptuous meal we had at the restaurant.
At "The Biryani Comapny " we had a very nice overall experience, and would recommend it as a must visit place for all the Awadhi food lovers in Kolkata, who love to have good quality food served in right quantity without too much pinch in their pocket.

If biryani is in your mind and want to have some kebabs too then join (dine in) The Biryani Company. From the name you can have ideas about the place right!!  Well this place is all about Biryani. A plate of biryani is enough to make you happy, and The Biryani Co. are doing that job flawlessly. Went there for a bloggers meet during Ramadan to taste their special menu. They have 6 branches across Kolkata. We visited in Southern avenue branch near Mudiali. Nicely decorated place with peaceful ambiance and comfortable seating arrangements. The place is spacious, with two moderately large rooms and can accommodate 25-30 people at a time.

This place serves really good Awadhi cuisine. The menu is limited and simple. They served us two types of signature kebabs, mutton biryani, chicken chaap, mutton rezala and firni. 

We started with,

Galoti Kebabs with Laccha Parathas– This one is a famous awadhi kebabs. Galoti Kebabs are made of minced mutton.  This kebabs were served with small Laccha Paratha with green Salad.  The Galoti kebabs were delicately and fondly cooked using papaya as tenderizing agent which makes it softer than butter and tender as snow.  It will melt in your mouth in no time. In Biryani Company they cooked this particular kebabs two times. They use pure ghee which make the taste even better. One of the must try item in Biryani Company.

Chicken Tangri Kebabs- Leg pieces of chicken marinated with different spices, later perfectly grilled in tandoor. Chicken pieces wrapped in aluminium foil and served with chopped onion and coriander chutney. Chicken was very soft and juicy and smoky flavour of tandoor act as a taste boost up. 

After having these lip smacking kebabs starter, it was the time for main course and we had,

Special Mutton Biryani- Well does this preparation need any introduction!! Nahhh! Mutton Biryani is always a blessing for non-vegetarian and here in Biryani Company they really blessed us (served) with one of the best biryani in the town.  This non-vegetarian recipe is prepared by marinating mutton in a melange of spices like cumin powder, coriander powder and star anise powder and is assorted with cooked rice. A perfect main dish recipe. The biryani was really good and perfectly cooked. Mutton was very soft not chewy. Not very spicy and oily yet very flavourful and delicious. 

Badsahi Chicken Chaap- A famous side dish preparation. Chicken Chaap is a real delight for non-veg lovers as this not only looks rich but tastes even better Goes perfectly with mutton biryani. Very spicy and little bit oily. Big size chicken piece marinated with ginger garlic paste yogurt and precisely selected spices and cooked in rich spicy gravy. Chicken pieces were very soft and juicy. The gravy was very delicious, we can have it with parathas too.

Mutton Rezala- This was absolutely gorgeous seriously tasty and I’d highly recommend it. Mutton chunks marinated with yogurt, different spices and cooked perfectly in medium spicy gravy. Very less oily. Mutton was very soft, and juicy. Delicious as well as healthy. 

After having these delicious main course and side dishes, we tried the dessert, Firni. This creamy delicious rice pudding is something we really want for a sweet ending. 

I can say this place is a gem for Mughlai lovers. Every preparation we tried were cooked very well and were absolutely delicious. The quality and quantity both are sufficient and pocket pinch is very reasonable.  We enjoyed the food as well as warm hospitality of Saugata Banerjee (Owner and an amazing host) very much. If you love Mughlai definitely visit this place. A perfect place to have brilliant biryanis and mouth-watering kebabs with friends and foes. Eat healthy and stay healthy and remember Good Food Feels Good. Had a delicious moments with team #Panchphoron.

First time tasted their biryani..before that we used to have biryani only from aminia or arsalan.I must say it is way better than all of them specially because of the less oil and excellent aroma.It is light and doesnt have that greasy feeling...I strongly recommend biryani company to all.

Yesterday we visited The Biryani Company, Garia branch for the first time to dine and also to collect take away. I spoke to the manager and told him this is our first time so how is it? He said "we are the best in Kolkata in terms of biriyani and kebabs. Nobody can match our quality. When you eat here, you will forget Arsalan, Aminia, Oudh etc." We ordered for Galawti Kebab one plate for starters, 2 small pieces of round shaped minced meat which was burnt came after 25 minutes. It was cold and it only tasted salty. Pathetic is the only word which i can think of, and for that I paid Rs.180. Then we ordered for Chicken Reshmi kebab (which was non spice but when delivered, it was so spicy that my son could not eat a bite, 6 pieces costed around 200), mutton bhuna boneless (we were told it is shredded mutton, one portion is fine for 3, when we opened the box, we saw only 5 small shredded pieces, and it costed us Rs.260. We ordered 1 Special Mutton Biryani (Rs.270) and 1 Mutton Biryani (Rs.170), which was tasteless, it was as if we were eating rice, mutton, the size of the piece was horrible and 1 half boiled egg). To add on to this, the behavior of few staff members were atrocious. They were rude, not at all hygenic, I even told the Chef that Galawti was bad, he said, at times it happens. I was surprised to know that they do not cook food there, it came from central kitchen, thats why we had to wait for 45 minutes for the biryani as it was on its way in Van. Overall one of the worst experience of my life. Pathetic, poor quality, service at his worst, To sum up, I will recommend everybody not to go this place, its a total waste of time, money and energy.

Awadhi cuisine in Kolkata got another new destination named "The Biryani Company ". 
It all started just few years back with initially 4 outlets in town. Dining fascility is available at their Mudiali and Patuli outlet, while the others have only takeaway fascility as of now.

The other day , we a blogger group had got the opportunity to visit their Mudiali outlet, next to which they have also newly added their Coastal Food Restaurant called " Pappanam "

Food at Biryani Company was authentic , well prepared and it reflected the true food passion of its owner Mr. Saugata Banerjee, who himself has travelled places and keeps a deep interest in world cuisine. He was also a perfect host in the evening and came across as a very nice and friendly person. 

The Galouti kebab served with mini Lachha paratha did absolute justice to its Lucknawi fame. It was perfectly cooked with right blend of spices and good quality minced lamb, which just melted in ones mouth.
The Chicken Kalmi Kebab also had the nice charcoal flavour and it was quite flavourful and soft.

The Biriyani Company is one of a popular name to all Biriyani Lover,. The shop has three brunch and we visited their Southern Avenue few days ago, during Saraswati Puja. It was almost 2PM, we were super hungry and tired too and was looking for a restaurant. After a few search for nearby restaurant on Zomato, we decided to snoop into this place.

Location - It is near to the entrance to the Rabindra Sarobar. Just a few turning and you will find it.

Decoration and management - The brunch itself is small in size. Can accommodate max 20persons at a time. Wooden table and chair sitting arrangement. Well maintained but service is quite slow although the restaurant was empty.

Food - We were not in mood to have Biriyani, so we ordered Masala Kulcha and Mutton Nihari, Green salad and Lassi. After placing order, in about 3-4min, a person came to us and informed that any kinda Kulcha is not available during Noon time. But he suggested us to take Malabar Paratha, as it goes well with Mutton Nihari. So we ordered a laccha Paratha and two Malabar Paratha.

Paratha - Well Laccha paratha was as usual like other restaurant, nothing special about it. But the Malabar paratha was really good. Puffy little bit and soft in nature. As it was fried in ghee, a strong fragrance of ghee was there. Like it.

Mutton Nihari - Rich spicy in nature. Six pieces mid sized mutton pieces were there. Mutton pieces were well cooked and it was really tender and juicy in nature. The quantity of gravy was little less but itz ok. Spicy chilly feel of the dish really goes well with any kinda bread or paratha. Recommended it.

Salad and Lassi - In salad, there was just some fine chopped veggies like Cucumber, carrot, onion and tomato. Nothing special. Lassi was ok, but not upto the mark. Overall good.

With all the food mentioned above, it costs us around 450INR, which is pretty decend in terms of price tag. But when it comes about food, there is nothing special. So in conclusion I would say that, you can treat this food joint a Casual dining restaurant. Don't expect huge from it, otherwise you will disappoint yourself. Overall a okey okey type dining experience.

When a place is named as "The Biryani Company", the immediate perception it creates is to opt for the "Biryani", being the USP of the place.

And then if you discover the "Biryani" itself to be a disaster, didn't it spoil the entire dining experience??
Exactly that is the problem with this food joint.

Other items available are pretty average, and seating capacity too is limited.
Not recommended at all!!

First of all the interior decoration showed in zomato page of this restaurant doesn't match in reality.This food joint has absolutely no ambience or decor .Coming to the food part,ordered a premium combo but there also I had a disappointing experience as chicken bharta was served instead of chicken chap because of non-Availability.This place is actually for take away.Quantity is too less.Chicken bharta tasted rubbish bt Biriyani was more or less average.Overall a disappointing experience in this food joint.

Well after hearing a lot of compliments about this place, thought of trying it. 

The ambience is really good. The service is also quite recommendable. But the food is not that tasty. And by food I mean the biriyani. The price is very affordable but the taste didn't go quite to my expectations. I won't say it's bad, but maybe it could've been much better.

Well a veg foodie reviewing a biriyani place is not expected, but there is no harm on sharing my veg biriyani experience! :p 
Located in southern avenue, in one of the bylanes,the location is pretty tricky. The place is small but well decorated. Have had food at the outlet as well as for delivery.

Tried the veg paneer biryani and trust me it was good! It was flavourful with Paneer pieces and aloo! 

Along with that went for the Paneer kadhai and also do pyaaza. Though a tad little too oily, it tasted amazing!

Overall a good experience!

This place proved to be our saviour on Panchami night. Located right next to the Mudiali pandal, this is a pretty joint and served as our relaxation spot. 

The interior is done up in shades of yellow and ochre, and has a vibrant feel to it. 

Now coming to the food.
I was really disappointed to see the limited menu. Only biryani and biryani. 
We ordered a plate of mutton biryani and 2 plates of chicken biryani, and chicken bharta
The chicken biryani was light and tasty, however the absence of an egg really mad me sad, since we were paying 180/plate. When you pay close to 200 for a plate of biryani, an egg is a must. However these folks thought otherwise.
The mutton biryani tasted good too, but was surprisingly oily. A big let down. 
The chicken bharta was the best part of the night. It tasted amazing, but yet again the quantity was an issue here. It was inadequate for 3 people, yet the man who was taking our order assured us that it would be enough.

The taste of the chicken biryani was indeed good, with a leg piece and a big chunky potato. But I wish they had provided us with an egg. And the quantity of the side dish should be increased. 

Pocket pinch - 770 for the 3 of us.

Overall it was an okay-ish experience. Frankly I was relieved to get a seat the moment we entered, it being panchami. 
I would definitely give this place a visit after the pujo madness gets over.

This place is not very overwhelming to opt for..The quality of biriyani is very much average type..The chicken piece in my biriyani plate was clearly undercooked and was very bad in taste..The side dishes aren't also very nice.. Moreover I had to wait for water to cleanse my hands after the meal as they had no water supply at that moment..The service is good though..But looking at the price someone may like to avoid this place unless he or she is out of options!

First things first please update your menu.all the prices are backdated.
The mutton Biriani costs 220 with taxes all the side dishes are around 200-240 ,firni is 60,fish fry is 70 and 100 depending on size,all items are tax included.

Now coming to the place we went here today afternoon to have lunch,the place is very small with a sitting capacity of 14.decor is nice,place is clean,has only one old a.c ,kind of hot.

We ordered starters tandoori ckn,tikka reshmi kababs none were available,i dont know how a resto on weekend doesn't have basic starter items.
They only had galauti and fish fry we opted for fish fry,for 70 bucks it was small in size but tatsy.

Then coming to the biriani,which is the reason for the name of the place,the quantity was good,mutton pcs were good soft not like arsalan or aminia,
The aloo had no taste what so ever,the rice was very light had no color,kind of no aroma,didnt really felt like biriani rice but was oky to eat,they gave complementary raita with it which was dahi mixed with water yukkkk.

Coming to the side dishes we ordered butter chicken which costs 200 had 2to medium pcs of ckn and gravy,gravy was very tasty but ckn pcs were very small,we had bhuna mutton i could not locate much mutton in it,but it was very tasty and the quantity was oky,
Then in dessert they only has firni,which was good. tasty.the service was kind of slow,they have combos but only on take away cant have them on dine in.

So its not vfm at all,we cam have better food at any authentic biriani places elsewhere.they dont have much crowd as the locality if filled with good restos.
They need to amp up there game big time.

An invite to a biryani joint on a sultry summer afternoon is unimaginable. The reason people let mughlai cuisine forego during summers was the reason I generally avoid it during summers as it keeps you too full throughout the day. This is a myth was solemnly proved by the biryani company.

Location : it is located just near mudiali club where the mudiali pujas chance each year. If you are taking a metro, get down at Rabindra sarobar and reach mudiali club to locate the joint written in a bold black backdrop.

Decor and Ambience : On a supeficial look , this joint appears to be small. On entering you realise, the ground floor of an old kolkata house has been transformed giving it a slight awadhi flavour. Lanterns having hung lit the whole place. Old persian paintings, small mementos , parsi work on brass plates gave it a whole new twist. The awadhi flavour was thus brought. If only some thumri , was on, it would have created a magical trance indeed.

Staffs : Had a chance to meet the owner , Mr. Saugata, who is an amazing human being , a wonderful singer and like most of us, food is his passion. His wife was a also very hospitable and welcoming. The staff was well versed as to what they were Serving and was very polite and ready-to-serve.

Coming to the food. 

Starters –

1. Mutton Galawati- the name is quite similar to what is served on the plates. The kebab rightly called , melts in the mouth. The minced mutton tastes real great.

2. Lasuni Chicken Kalmi- the chicken lasuni is another great feature. The strong aroma of garlic adds to the much tasty meat. Also the well marinated chicken kebab is hard to miss.

This place proved to be our saviour on Panchami night. Located right next to the Mudiali pandal, this is a pretty joint and served as our relaxation spot. 

The interior is done up in shades of yellow and ochre, and has a vibrant feel to it. 

Now coming to the food.
I was really disappointed to see the limited menu. Only biryani and biryani. 
We ordered a plate of mutton biryani and 2 plates of chicken biryani, and chicken bharta
The chicken biryani was light and tasty, however the absence of an egg really mad me sad, since we were paying 180/plate. When you pay close to 200 for a plate of biryani, an egg is a must. However these folks thought otherwise.
The mutton biryani tasted good too, but was surprisingly oily. A big let down. 
The chicken bharta was the best part of the night. It tasted amazing, but yet again the quantity was an issue here. It was inadequate for 3 people, yet the man who was taking our order assured us that it would be enough.

The taste of the chicken biryani was indeed good, with a leg piece and a big chunky potato. But I wish they had provided us with an egg. And the quantity of the side dish should be increased. 

Pocket pinch - 770 for the 3 of us.

Overall it was an okay-ish experience. Frankly I was relieved to get a seat the moment we entered, it being panchami.

Southern avenue has a plenty of food joints. The biryani company is one of them. Mr. Banerjee owns this place and has placed this restaurant attached to his house. His collections of models, paintings, wall-arts from different countries are praiseworthy and have made the place aesthetically pleasing. Talking about food, as the name says, the biryanis would accompany you well. :D They were too tasty, less oily, yet were able to maintain the feel of the dishes. We took 2 special mutton biriyanis which were served with raita alongside them and 2 normal mutton biriyanis.  Chicken bharta and chicken butter masala could be so less oily yet so tasty and palatable, we had no idea. The place kept increasing my love for biriyani with the passing of each second and I am sure same thing will happen with you too.

The Biryani Company, located on the lane next to Mudiali club, assures to provide a lighter version of biryani that won’t be unhealthy, without altering it’s taste. I was invited for the blogger’s meet organised here. The place is spacious, with two moderately large rooms. The ambience is vibrant, much due to the exquisite collection of photo frames and models which have been collected by Mr Banerjee, the owner of this joint, from different countries.

Well, the Behala branch that has been opened recently has deplorable home delivery service. They distribute leaflets mentioning fast home delivery, and I'm still sitting with an empty plate at 10:13 while I ordered the food at 7:00. My bad that I didn't cancel the order like a ruthless customer. I urge the review readers not to order food from there so that they get the punishment for this horrifying unprofessionalism. VERY DISAPPOINTING.

The prices quoted here are totally obsolete. For example Chicken Bharta is mentioned as Rs. 120/- here whereas the current price is Rs. 160/-. I think Zomato should update the informations published in their app more frequently. One can expect 10-20% difference but not 33% I guess.

I Extremely disappointed on the VAT which is charged even on take away. You will find most of the take away do not charge VAT as legally they don't have to. I took the food first time liked it and they did not charged me any VAT. So I went next time. I got really surprised they charged me tax. I will probably think twice visiting there just because of ethical ground. If I ha e to pay tax and pay as per bigger restaurant i will prefer to go any other renowned shop.

The ambiance n decor of the restaurant is excellent, even the hospitality n service is great. But what is more important in a restaurant is Food I guess. As the name suggests, "Biriyani Company" so biriyani should be what is to be concentrated on n it's sad that they disappointed me in this particular sector. Biriyani is specially known for the assembly of all the spices n its aroma! Which was very much missing in their biriyani...neither it was Afghani nor Lucknowi nor Hyderabadi n not even that typical Kolkata type! We also ordered for Mutton Nihari which was another disappointment. It was a simple mutton stew our parents prepare on Sunday afternoons! What we concluded, the names of dishes were attractive but it did not mark up to that delicacy at all. Overall food was a total disappointment...

Before few days team Kolkata Food Bloggers were invited by “The Biryani Company” to showcase their newly opened fine dining restaurant “Biryani Bistro” and also for a lunch. I along with co-blogger Indrani was represent KFB in that occasion. Regarding the location it is situated just few steps ahead of The Mudiali Club , Tollygunj and very near to Rabindra Sarovar Metro Station. The Biryani Company was started as a take away outlet of Biryani and Mughlai food two years back but soon gained popularity due to their food quality, competitive prices and authentic tastes. The demand of a dining area was always there and this leads to open fine dining Biryani Bistro situated just beside the take-away outlet.

    It was just few days before Dugra Puja and the whole area was in a celebration mood surrounded by two big puja clubs. When we reached there, they welcome us very warmly, requested to have a seat and offered for soft drinks. We are very much impressed by the inside atmosphere and nice decorations with some of their personal art collections which attracted me very much. 

       We were pleased with the hospitality and politeness of the stuffs. After few talks with PR Gargi and the manager Mr. Anupam Muhuri we felt comfortable by their friendly and polite nature. Sitting together they well explained about their newly launched restaurant, their intention and their dream. They said it was a dream project of the owner Mr. Saugata Banerjee and her wife Mrs. Sona Banerjee. They spent many years in abroad and different parts of India for study and professional work and always had an intention to start their own venture in food industry. After lots of experiment and market research they opened ‘The Biryani Company’ with a great vision and to keep the authenticity of the food and it was a great success.

 Whatever during those adda, photo session and introduction they asked to serve their popular menu items and we are excited to taste the authenticity.

  First they served ‘Murg Tacos’. It was hot and crunchy with inside juicy chicken filling. Chicken was shredded after boiling and then cooked with Indian spices and familiar vegetables. It was very tasty, interesting mix of Mexican and Mughlai cuisine.

          The next starter was Chicken Banno Kebab served in a white plate with nice art of salad. It was too good and chicken pieces were very soft and well cooked. Chicken pieces is specially marinated with yellow chili and coated with egg before going to tandoor. 

     Next came the very famous item Ghost Galowati Kebab with Lachcha Parantha. Paranthas were made on tawa and the mutton kebab was made by mince mutton mixing with spices and grated papaya. It was well bonded and the interesting thing was they did not use any extra binding ingredients like sattu or flour. 
     After eating lots of starter my tummy almost full but the last starter yet to come and couldn’t resist the last starter for a bite. This time we can definitely say it was super healthy because Chicken Reshmi Kebab was served with lots of mixed salad. They generally prefer to serve items with sufficient salad to maintain it as a healthy. 
     After finishing starter they nicely present their special Awadhi Moti Biryani in a Clay Pot (handi).It was made by mince mutton with best spices and it was too tasty. The mutton pieces were too soft and it can be consumed without any effort .It was really melt- in-mouth. The rice quality was also very good and not over flavoured and no additional food colour was used. They use best saffron stands to bring the colour and really we felt that it is burp-less and obviously low fat (as they use always white sunflower oil and pure ghee). 
         While we are busy with all these food stuffs the co-owner Mrs. Sona Banerjee was explaining their experiment with Biryani and how they managed to start their own. She explained their love for Biryani and how they travel across India for an authentic taste of Biryani and Mughlai. Their main target was to keep the food light and to make a Biryani for all people irrespective of health issues. I found her extremely down to earth person and found how she easily mixed up with all of us, She also shared their future plans of opening a musical corner along with the food as the owners have a soft corner for music too(which is a not to mention a unique combination of most of bong).  
    According to her version they play a bit fusion in case of Awadhi Moti Biryani. They use potato with Awadhi Moti Biryani as Kolkata people very much fond of potato. Chicken Chaap was well served with Awadhi Moti Biryani and I myself found the taste was well balanced, oil was not at all floating and it was too light. Light spiced Mutton soup was also served which was prepared using Indian spices and pepper powder. The intention of serving this is to use along with Biryani to make rice bit juicy which I found unique. Mattha or buttermilk was also served. 
        Phirni was served as a desert item and the plate was decorated with fresh cream and fresh pomegranate. A fine aroma of Govindo bhog rice and Mitha atar was coming out of the dish. 
  After all these mouthwatering foods we met with the core chefs Azzizur and Chef Rafig. They explained about the spices they use and also share some tips and techniques to make a fresh ground spice which is really important to make any recipe. The approach of Biryani Bistro in choosing chefs is quite interesting as chefs are all from Lucknow and they came from a family involved in making Biryani and Mughlai by generations.The only intention to produce an authentic taste. 

   Thanks a lot Team Biryani Bistro for a nice lunch and special thanks to the co-owner Mrs. Sona Banerjee ,PR Gargi Ghosh Neogi and Manager Mr. Anupam Muhuri for spending their valuable time with us and explaining so much thing with us. We were pleased by them and recommends visiting the place. 
    So don't miss the authentic flavour at a very reasonable price. You can order over phone and call at 833 503 5757 for a free home delivery. Reach them at 9830402345 for any query and booking.

It was a lovely discovery. Identifying the location can be a trifle tricky. Me and my partner loved this quaint little place ,tastefully done up and elegant. Our waiter was a lovely man with a friendly demeanor and almost infectious energy. When we ordered for a special nawabi chicken moti biryani and he forbade us to order anymore for the two of us and boy was he right! The quantity was amazing. The taste exquisite. Fragrant and light but sure packed a punch. Serve with a portion of salads and gulped down with copious amounts of drinks we were a happy duo. This amazing meal set us back by a mere 400 bucks. Hope they keep up the great service. Shall be back for more such lovely meals.

Biryani company,tucked away in the lanes of Southern avenue,next to Mudiali club.Its actually a house,situated on the ground floor.Decor is nice and warm,and they seat about 14-15 people.We had come to order Biryanis for a event in our college.Were lucky t be treated to sumptous fish fries,which were amazing.We had ordered a Biryani Platter for our event,consisting of Chicken & Veg biryanis along with Chicken chaap,Kadai Paneer and Gulabjamuns.They were sweet to throw in a 20 Litre water container as well :) The Biryani is well made,tasty and made without Dalda,which makes it lighter than the normal ones made in Kolkata.The Menu is not huge,but seems to concentrate on some dishes.Will be trying it out again.

Decorated with an eclectic range of beautiful objects sourced from all over the world, The Biryani Bistro offers the perfect setting for meaningful conversation and mouthwatering cuisine . Recently , we had the pleasure of savouring a wide range of newly introduced dishes, chief among which were the Lasuni Murgh Kalmi Kabab and the Galawati Kulccha. Mutton Nihari, Dhaniya Murgh and Fish Achari remained our hot favourites. We left the place extremely satisfied and with a resolve to return very very soon!!! The owner ,Mr. Banerjee, takes personal care in recommending  the dishes and makes sure that they are cooked to perfection.

The Kolkata-based ‘The Biryani Company’ claims to be a new age, health-conscious food delivery chain providing Healthy, Tasty and Affordable freshly cooked biryani! PanchPhoron was recently invited over for a food tasting session at 'Biryani Bistro', their fine dining restaurant in Mudiali. whether or not can David take on the Goliaths of the Biryani makers to the likes of Arsalan/Aminia/India/Alia remained to be found out.
Conceptualized by Mr. Sougata Bannerjee, the Biryani Company had become a known name in the industry with their multiple outlets serving fusion Mughlai/ awadhi cuisines in a take-away/dine-in model around two years back. But owing to certain complications regarding maintaining the same standard they stand for, Mr. Bannerjee decided to close down the small outlets & concentrate on the flagship restaurant in Mudiali.
A former professor & Management consultant by profession, Mr. Bannerjee's second passion has been food. As he roamed the world in connection with his work, he always dreamt of opening an unique food destination in Kolkata. The dream was equally shared by his wife who herself is an professor at a renowned college in Kolkata. So it was only a matter of time before 'The Biryani Company' was born. Mr. Sougata, a great cook himself, left no stones unturned to collect the best recipes, spices & chefs for his restaurant.
Located in the lane parallel to S P Mukherjee Road, the outlet is located very close to Mudiali club. Situated in the ground floor, the seating area is divided in two parts, accommodating roughly about 35 people.
The interiors are done in a fine way. Various showpieces, porcelain dolls  & other items collected from all around the world adorn the walls & the showcase. Ambient light is warm & appropriate for a fine dinner or lunch.
As we were seated we were served glasses of cold drinks. The owner Mr. Saugata welcomed us himself, & we had a detailed chat about his passion regarding food, the idea behind the restaurant. Here, as we came to know, Dalda or MSG is not used & the items are made as healthy as possible. The spices are all natural, even the kesar used is of superior quality & not the cheap coloring ones generally found in the market.
Meanwhile the food items arrived, the aroma was wonderful & we dug into the items as fast as we could. A short  description of the items we tried is given below:

1. Hara Bhara Kebab:
As the name implies its a kebab made with 'hara' i.e green veggies, in this case, green peas, chickpeas & spinach. The kebabs had a dual tone colour, brown top & bottom from the toasting with the greens layered in between. No artificial colour or flavour added, the crunchy kebabs were a delight as a starter.

2. Paneer Tikka:
Another veg dish coming to the table, this one was pieces of cottage cheese (paneer) tomato & capsicum held together by toothpick, reasonably coated with spices & then lightly cooked. tasted quite delicious.

3. Tandoor achari kumbh:
After peas & paneer it was time for something. At first we weren't familiar with the name 'kumbh', but as Mr. Saugata explained, mushrooms are known by that name in the northern parts of India. The authentic taste has been maintained with the spicy 'achari' marinade. The mushrooms it selves were soft & juicy & liked by all.

4. Fish Fry:
Done with the veg starters we moved on to the non-veg ones. Fish fry needs no introduction. The fillets of fish was juicy, surely they had been procured fresh in the morning. The coating was not too hard, not too soggy either, in one word perfect. The accompanying dip needs special mention. Generally Fish fry/fingers are served with kasundi/mayonnaise. But here they innovatively served best of both by adding chopped green chillies & mustard paste to the mayo & making it quite an unique dip.

5. Lasuni Chicken Kalmi:
The next was Chicken Kalmi kebab with added garlic paste. Yet the smell of garlic was not overpowering. The meat was soft from adequate marination & could be separated from the bone without much struggle. Delicious. Recommended.

6. Mutton Galawati:
Next to hit the tables was Mutton Galawati kebab. This is one Lakhnavi kebab everyone is acquainted with. The familiar smell was hit the nose as soon as this one was in the room. The finely minced mutton along with its smokey smell really melted in the mouth. Every ingredient was so nicely cooked that it really melted like butter as soon as we took the bite. Astoundingly perfect. Definitely recommended.

7. Butter Naan/ Masala Kulcha / Galawati Kulcha :
Next up were the breads. Nothing to say about the Naan & masala kulcha as they were standard affairs. It suffices to say they were well prepared. But the star of the bread Basket was the galawati kulcha. As the name suggests, its Masala kulcha with a twist, where the masala is replaced by the galawati paste. As was with the case of the galawati kebab, the kulcha too got rave appreciation from the foodies.

8. Badami Spl. Chicken Champ:
Chicken Chaap with added peanut paste. Though the chicken was cooked to perfection, somehow the gravy had an overpowering taste of raw peanut. Maybe in a hurry the peanut paste had remained a tad bit undercooked, but else it was good as side dish to the biryani & breads.

9. Mutton Biryani:
The star of the lunch, we were eagerly waiting for this. More so as we had been told that they prepare it without dalda. & surely it didn't disappoint. the rice was cooked to perfection. & the mutton! It has to be one of the softest & juiciest mutton piece I had in a biryani in a long time.On enquiringt I got to know that the muttons are cooked in two stages to ensure proper cooking. The absence of dalda could be easily seen from the texture of the biryani. The piece of potato too was well cooked.

10. Gulab Jamun with Rabri:
We finished our meal on a sweet note with Gulab Jamun in rabri. A perfect finish, the hot jamun was soft & the rabri well made.

Overall had a great experience at the Biryani Bisto by The Biryani Company. They did live upto their claim of tasty yet healthy Biryanis. Great food & great ambiance. The owner & staff very courteous & welcoming. Hopefully other foodies visiting the place will like it as much as we liked it.
Will surely visit again to try out other items from their menu.
Till then
Happy Eating.
                                          ...

The food is really good. The mutton biryani is great, I did like the chicken champ but the rezala simply won my heart. I haven't tried the Chinese dishes, but I'm looking forward on going there again!

Excellent is a very small word for their Biryani which I tasted during the Durga Puja this year on Sashti. It was simply fabulous with one of the Best Ever Mutton Pieces that I have ever tasted till date. Their Aloo was also a huge sized piece with more than enough quantity of Rice that they gave made our lunch fantastic and brilliant. A Must Try Outlet for Biryani lovers of Kolkata.....!!!!!

Decent gilawati. Biryani, which should be the focal point as name suggests was thoroughly disappointing. Pretty dry, lacks aroma and spice. Surprisingly paneer dish was very good.  Was extremely rich, flavorful, creamy and different.

I have tired their chicken biryani so far.. the biryani is good but I have had better biryani this  ... the aroma of the rice is little bit missing and the chicken piece was not soft...the price is reasonable.. but quality of biryani should be improved...

i have been taking biryani parcel from this place since ages, portion is good, taste is good and ingredients they use seems good quality. But other than biryani trying anything else is a nono.. the chicken chaap not worth reviewing poor taste texture, there is no option of any bread other than parathas which may not be suitable always on kolkata weather, partaha was good by heavily oil soaked i got satity after a single bite. Final review is biryani always a 'go go' but rest of stuffs definitely a 'no no'.

Nice place to have Biryani. As the name suggests they serve biryani along with other items. They serve chicken and mutton biryani. They serve veg biryani as well. The seating capacity here is not much. The service is quick. You can visit this place more than once.

This the kind of place you don't pay much attention to and they turn out good when you finally take a chance.
Small partially open space, cannot accommodate many.The prices are reasonable , comparatively low.
The biriyani is good and also the other mughlai dishes.
You might prefer a take away.The amount served is more than enough and the people are well behaved.
Can give it a try when you just need casual dinner stuff.

Recently got a take away from this outlet of the Biryani Company and was pleasantly surprised.This outlet is located in Mudiali near the Mudiali Club Durga Pujo.

My order comprised of a special Mutton biryani and a chicken butter masala.The order was readied swiftly.The food was pretty good.The Biryani was tasty and flavourful yet not overtly oily.The pieces of mutton and also the potato were soft and well cooked.The Chicken Butter masala was also tasty.The gravy was rich and a bit oily though.The size of the pieces of chicken and mutton were nice and generous.The prices are very reasonable.The quantity was decent too.Overall I was satisfied with my experience with the Biryani Company.

During durga puja this year, me and three friend were too hungry and went all the restaurants nearby behala main road, but every where a long queue for dinner. then some one told about this newly opened restaurant. When we reached there a small queue was there. We got chance after 15-20 mins (this is very short time during puja in behala).
We ordered for biriyani and chiken bharta. Sufficient quantity, reasonable price ,taste was good comparatively among others at the time of puja.
Not special but not worse experience.

Review regarding home delivery of veg biryani (out of 5)
1. Ease of order placement and delivery-3
I have often placed orders with biryani company and almost half the time was either declined outright for home delivery or was made to call up some other numbers. On specifically asking about any minimum order criteria, they said there was none.
2. Availability of veg biryanis-3
Have to place the order in advance of around 12 hours or so

3. Pricing-4.5
Can't beat the pricing

4. Taste-5
Biryani was just perfect. Preferred the special veg one over paneer biryani.

All in all, fair enough stuff if the real deal is taken into account.

Not a very good experience to share !!! been there yesterday with a friend of mine in the evening. We were the only two people in the whole restaurant as i think its like this (empty due to lack of customers) always as there was not much enthusiasm in the staffs as well. 
The place was not even that clean with a few torn sofas and the AC put of. (Had to ask them to put it on.)
Coming to food- We ordered a special mutton biriyani and chicken butter masala. The food was served. Biriyani was nothing much special if you go by the name THE BIRIYANI COMPANY. The quantity was good though. The chicken butter masala came as well. 2 pieces of chicken and the gravy was good in taste but the CHICKEN served was not what a chicken butter masala should be. Due to lack of people visiting then the have cooked food which the wanted to push i guess so they gave us TWO pieces of Chicken Tandoori mixed with the chicken butter masala gravy. A big let down.

Pocket pinch - 500 for two. (no extra tax was charged to me.)

Food quality normal. One will not lick his/her finger after eatin food. What bothered me the most is they took too much time to serve foods! When we visited there no other customers were there. Still they took more than half an hour to serve 2 nuns, 2 tandoori rotis and 1 chicken bharta!
And one more thing, the quantity of chicken bharta is not enough compare to its price!

A few months back as I was returning home I saw that a branch of The Biryani Company is being opened in Behala, at 15 minutes distance from my residence. Since then this place has been in my wish list. Finally, the last day of this year's Durga Puja took us over there. We ordered chicken and mutton biriyani and chicken bharta. Due the Puja, the menu was limited, but since I was there only for the biriyani, I did not mind. The biriyani was tasty.  The amount of biriyani served was more than enough for us though the chicken in the side dish was quite less. Overall I liked their food, especially the biriyani.

LOCATION:- Near roy bahadur road.Beside roy nagar football field adjacent to SBI Mysore Atm.

AMBIENCE:- Previously it was just a take away type resturant. Recently it has been xtended to a well fursnished resturant. I always visted the place for take away so nvr xperienced the ambience in full strength.As the ACs remain switch off due to lack of customers.

No of visits:- 2

ITEMS ORDERED :-
1) Mutton Biriyani
2) Chicken Biriyani

FOOD REVIEW :-
You wont come across the aroma untill you bring your nose close to the dish. The quality of rice were good unlike some other resturants of these genre. Taste was average. Mutton was good and soft . Chicken was a huge chunk.
Bt the whole thing was an oily affair.

POCKET PINCH:- 450-500 for a two

Conclusion:- a resturant which you can give it a try once in a while for home delivery only, not an ideal place to sit and eat. Prices are a bit high compared to some other resturant of these genre.

We tried their mutton and chicken biryani and kebabs one fine evening and were surprised at the lovely taste. Each dish was cooked to perfection . The kebab pieces were reasonable and the Smokey flavor was unforgettable. The biryani was well cooked , with good pieces of chicken and well enough for 1 adult and 1 child to share. 
The place has very few small stools for seating so it's better to pack and take away the food for home. The prices are reasonable and the quality is great.

We packed a mutton biryani for home but surprisingly the mutton piece there was a little bit undercooked. But otherwise we loved the taste and quality as well as quantity.

Location: Mudiali.

This small little eatery is located quite near to the Mudiali club (Mudiali Puja Pandal spot) or the famous Baithak.
The ambiance out here is quite soothing all thanks to the nice selection of the color combinations for the decor.
People opt for takeaways or to eat in their car due to the space constraint this place faces.

Talking about the food, I being a vegetarian have less options to select from the menu they have on offer.
But, nevertheless made a takeaway of a plate of Dal Makhani and Butter Naan to accompany the Dal. The Dal was delicious and the Naan was soft.
Wished to try the Biryani, but, saved it for a later visit since, wasn't in a mood to have rice that day.

The staff is polite and the service was quick.
Prices are pocket friendly.
>A plus for the availability of home delivery facilities.

Being quite near to my place, this place can be a emergency tummy filler for me. :p

Tried this place last week after reading reviews. Small outlet tucked in a residential locality near Menoka cinema hall. Biriyani was light and tasty. They actually allowed me to taste the biriyani before placing the order, since I was a bit sceptical about quality and taste. This is definitely a good alternative to Zeeshan and Bedwin in south Kolkata. Though not the same taste as Shiraz or Arsalan, bit pretty close. Will definitely recommend this place to all.

This place is an awesome new venture when it comes to the world of biryani. Being a Calcutta biryani fan this place does proper justice to the so called 'Deliciousness'  that is the Calcutta biryani and even more. Apart from the conventional chicken or mutton biryani on your plate their prawn biryani should also be on your foodie agenda. Their fish cutlets and chops too are to die for.

While purchasing at republic of chicken at southern avenue, we were handed over a leaflet for this outlet, with the menu card.The menu card seemed very interesting, claiming to have prawn/emu/kofta biryani and emu kebabs and other exotic names.It was advertised in big letters that they don't use vanaspati in cooking biryani and only sunflower oil is their cooking medium. 
Intrigued we called for a home deliery for some of their exotic dishes.We were very dissappointed to learn that none of the fancy names would be available and only basic chicken/mutton biryani, kassa, and bharta would be available.crestfallen, We ordered mutton biryani, chicken bunno kebab, and chicken bharta from them.They delivered free of charge within 40 mins.

The food quality was surprisingly good.The kebab was soft, juicy and succulent and had a thin layer of cheese on it.Much like the arsalan special kebab, just the cheese layer was thinner.I liked it that way, a thick layer half kills my apetite.

The biryani was ad advertised, very less in oil, but not less in flavour.You cannot find any residue on your fingers and plate once it is cold, so no Dalda.HAPPY ME!!Mutton piece and potato was properly boiled.Good one.

The chicken bharta was regular in taste, nothing extraordinary.However, good in quantity to be comfortably shared by two and quite cost effective.Again no frozen layer of dalda on top. :)

Would have rated them as great if more of their menu was available.Why keepexotic names, if you can only serve basic dishes.

The Biryani Company - Not a company but a small kiosk which serves biryani and kebab's. 
============================================================================

Intro:

 I had been to The Biryani company yesterday when it was raining heavily in the city of joy. As i go to southern avenue swimming club, i had been passing by this joint like a lot of times and yes, in the rain, i decided to get my stuffs packed from here. As i reached this place, i don't know but this place gave me a 'calm and soothing' feeling. The ambience had white and red checkered cloth on all sides of the place and it was quite adding to the look. However, on the wall, they had kept some paintings and decor was improved thereon. This is located in one of those lanes of southern avenue and i can't exactly explain you the location as there's no nearby landmark. Better to call them up before diving in. This place is a takeaway and you surely can't sit and eat here due to lack of space. Nevertheless, i continued with my order. 
============================================================================

Food Ordered(Prices here are inclusive of taxes):

 As the name says 'The Biryani Company' and it was my first time, i decided to pack "two chicken biryani's" from here. I immediate told the staffs to pack chicken biryani's each costing 110 bucks. The staff immediately took the order and started working on the packing. They have the usual Handi's in which they prepare the biryani and keep it. ( The usual way) He packed the Biryani in like 5 minutes. I am an ardent lover of Mughlai biryani and i love to try out biryani at various locations. The Biryani is as good as the one served in Aliah hotel. The rice was kept a little dry, the chicken piece was tender and juicy and the potato was perfectly boiled. Overall, it was not oily at all. It was the perfect amount of oil required in a biryani and believe me, i became a fan of them thereafter. The prices at which they provide you is quite less compared to the other places. As a lot of people are still not aware of them, i must recommend all the biryani lovers not to miss out this place at least!

Pros:

Okie how do I begin this... I was on my way to a Cafe in mudiali and stumbled upon this joint on my way there... I loved the wooden door and the red and white checked curtains... The place had something very welcoming about it.

As I entered to see what they serve, the whiff of the food just called me towards it.  I ordered s chicken tiKka masala and a special chicken biriyani and packed them with a lot of guilt.  To my surprise the Food was light and fresh. Eating the biriyani was very balanced and not overly fragrant and the rice was perfectly cooked. 

The Chicken gravy was smooth and the tanginess was just right. . 

The food left a very clean taste on the palette and I am lookin forward to eat it again soon

Biriyani Company is the place to be if you want the right ambience,  the right prices and food that will taste like heaven but take your health into consideration. 
My friends and I ordered Chicken Biriyani, Prawn Biriyani, Butter Naan, Paneer Butter Masala and Chicken Momos. Each item was cooked to perfection. The chicken in the Biriyani was tender and succulent with the ideal amount of flavour. The rice was not rich but very tasty. The prawn was nice and large and properly spiced. 

As for the naan and paneer butter masala,  the friend who ordered it said she would never be able to enjoy these items from another place after having The Biriyani Company's. 
The momos too, lived up to our expectations. 
Coming to the negatives,  the A.C. wasn't working. The manager said they had just been installed earlier that day and would be working just fine the next day onwards. Also, they took a long time to give us a single glass of Coke,despite repeated reminders. We deduced that they possibly did not have Coke in store and had to send someone out to get a bottle. The manager assured us he would look into the matter. 
My friends and I will definitely go back.

As a matter of fact nowadays Behala area has been blessed with some good eating house/restaurants. To day I went to this one but sorry to say I felt upset with the service as well as the quality of food :(. When I entered it was 1:15 pm. I opted for a Rs450 All you can eat buffet. I was very surprised to see I am the only person to be here and the buffet area had no food at all. A manager came to me in a very unprofessional look by saying since no body there he could not able to fill the buffet area with promised food and asked me to wait for 20 mins so that they can prepare food for me. OMG this was the first time to experience such a buffet environment. After waiting for half an hour they served the starter and so on. Regarding taste the biriyani was very very average. They put so much salt in Fish fry (starter) and gravy items that suddenly I thought may be Tata Salt been under promotion LOL.

I will never visit this for sure.

The Biryani Company-A new Biryani venture that is completely different from the others around. Must say that this small takeout shop is a mana from heaven, with an awesome menu. The best item on the menu has got to be their prawn biryani. Never had anything like it before. The chicken and mutton are equally good,and so are the succulent kebabs. The interesting thing is that this place also serves up momos and their prawn momos are to die for. There is also vegetarian options for both Indian and Tibetan cuisines which are equally popular as its nonveg counterpart. Hope this place does really well in the near future.

The biryani here is excellent. Not much dalda, unlike many other places. Lives up to its name.
Only downside is short supply of food. Hope that will get smoothened out once it becomes fully operational.
