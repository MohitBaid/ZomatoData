This particular joint in Anwar Shah Road is quite good for feeling up your stomach when you are not in mood for anything meaty and spicy. It serves decent quality dosa vada and usual South Indian delicacies. This time we opted for mixed uttapam which is quite a steal athe price. Associated chutneys and sambhar makes it quite a mouthful

For the time being i am falling in love with the South Indian Dishes. After getting the dose of Dosa from Banana leaf i couldnt resist to try it once more when i landed on this place at Lord's more at Prince anwar shah Road.
Tried their Cheese Masala Dosa. Masala was wrapped in the paper dosa and the cheese beeing poured all over the paper. Every Bite has the flavour of cheese in it and the Masala was playing its part well. To be mention the Coconut Chutney and sambar were spot on with the taste. Recommended

Located on lord's more , this is my favourite dosa outlet since my school days . They make really crispy and tasty dosas. Chutney is always fresh and yum. I like the coconut nd the green chutney.

Popular is literally a popular option for the South Indian food lovers . They cater some yummy South Indian food at a really affordable price. They do not have seating option so only option is the take away. Got Dosa and sambar vada from here along with the famous dahi Vada as well. Tasted yummy and I personally have liking for South Indian food so it was very much satisfactory for my stomach :)

One of the popular South Indian joints in and around Lords, the Dosas and Dahi Vadas are apparently the USP here. No proper seating options though, but the quantity and quality makes up for it. I personally liked the Dosa, which has the right amount of Masala in the potato mixture, and the sambhar which was super delicious.

One of the best #southindianfood shacks in #kolkata ... Period!!
The Masala Dosa was crunchy as hell, the masala well seasoned, sambhar had the right amount of tang and curry leaf flavour, the white chutny: fresh and smooth with hints of coconut and not to forget the dollop of green chutney with in all its green deliciousness.
the Dahi Vada is by far my favourite with melt in your mouth soft vadas and the thick sweet dahi, tangy tamarind chutney topped with crunchy sev.

Authentic south indian cusine. Speciality dosa,idly, uttapam with different variations are delicious ðŸ˜€. 
Packaging is very good, so when you bring the food back home neither the moistness nor the freshness goes.
