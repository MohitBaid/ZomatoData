The new baby in town will sweep you off your feet with its lively music and innovative cocktails! 
This plush place is located at Holiday INN  at Rajarhat. The dj here is awesome and definitely one of the best in town. 

The list of captivating drinks goes like this :
#Ramachari
#Brahmachari
#Test Tube Shots
#Startender Special   Cocktail

Ramachari and Brahmachari are a concoction of pickle with Vodka. Unique blend and quirky to taste. The bartender is fabulous with many tricks up his sleeve, dry ice being favourite for the night. 

Non veg kebab platter and Non veg Brazilian Churrasco were the food for the night. 
The smoky aroma of Churrasco hits right with the shots and cocktails. 

The right mix of music and drinks along with lip-smacking platters is sure to make your nights special.. Our Ladies night was a night to remember, looking forward to visit again with my girl gang!

With hypnotic buzz and lively music this is gonna be the perfect place to party the night away.

Here goes the list of innovative cocktails that we were served by the talented "Startender".

1.Rumachari shots
2.Brahmachari shots
3.Test tube shots
4.Startender special cocktail

The cocktails were a perfect example of mix n match and with the inclusion of dry ice they created a special visual effect too.

As starters we had
1.Non veg kebab platter-Consisting of 4 types of delectable kebabs,this is a totally must try platter.
It had galouti kebab ,chicken reshmi tikka ,mutto kebab and chicken tikka. All these kebabs were ultra soft and totally melt in mouth.
2.Non veg brazilian churrasco-Churrasco is a spanish term which refers to grilled meat.This platter consisted of grilled and smoky meat which was really flavourful to the palate.

With all these yummy food and lovely cocktails,Urban is a space that is filled with magic and is must visit this party season.

With Christmas and New Year around the corner, we are definitely in a great mood for parties right! 😍😅 
So we have a new destination for all the party hoarders out there! Let’s make some noise for URBAN - Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport. The place has quite sophisticated decor and a dance floor as well. 
They surely have the most innovative cocktails and mocktails I have ever tasted. 🤩🍸
Starting with the cocktails we had were as follows:
🍸 Rumachari shots - Had a fine taste of pickle in rum.
🍸 Brahmachari shots - Fresh brahmi leaves in bacardi and apple juice.
🍸 Test tube shots - Freshly made shots presented beautifully in test tube and kettle.
🍸 Silk Stockings - Grenadine syrup with lime in white rum. 
🍸Moving on to the mocktail, it was served beautifully in a kettle with dry ice all over giving that grand effect altogether. 
..
..
💛In the food menu we had the super delicious Non Veg Kabab Platter - This consisted of different kababs including Galauti kabab which of one of my personal favourites, they were super soft and mouth watering truly. It also had Reshmi kababs, Tikka kababs and lasts mutton kababs as well. The entire platter was quite filling and is very much sufficient for three to four people.
💛Up next we had the most stunning starter namely the Non Veg Brazillian Churrasco - It looked mindblowing. So it was smoking hot and was actually barbecued meat consisting of chicken and pork as well. The presentation and taste was superb and very extraordinary.
It was a great evening being there and having to witness such creativity! 💁

Urban is the new happening place in town to visit with your girl friends.As you step in Hotel Holiday Inn in Rajarhat, walking through the lobby the staircase leads to the large black door.Urban is another world of hip music,disco lights and minimal decor.The limited space has a nice seating done in black n white.

The mixologist or as we call him "Startender" poured us fascinating cocktail.Captivated by the innovative cocktail mixing in front of our eyes.

Here goes the list of intriguing Cocktail
🍁Ramachari
🍁Brahmachari
🍁Test tube shots
🍁Startender special cocktail

The vodka mixed with pickles made for quite an interesting combination.The alcohol kept pouring in for the night with shots for the ladies and special cocktails from the mixologist.The skilled bar tender has many tricks up his sleeves and dry ice being his favourite for the evening.

On my plate the chef special 
🍁Non vegetarian kebab platter
🍁Non veg Brazilian Churrasco

The kebabs were melt in mouth and polished off as soon as it reached the table.The Churrasco is actually barbequed meat from the northern province of America.The smoky flavour engrossed us as the meat landed in the table.Presentation is eye catching and the flavour is lip smacking.

An enthralling evening with my girl gang in one of the fabulous and extraordinary places in town.
