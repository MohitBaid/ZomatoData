I have been here many times. I have tried tandoori, reshmi kabab, biriyani. Tandoori chicken was awesome. Relatively cheaper place. But food were very good. I often use take away service from this place. One of the best place in the area.

This was my friend's and my birthday treat to our gang. We had heard a lot of this restaurant and were eager to visit. So our treat gave us the perfect opportunity to try it.
Chef Alladin has both Indian and Chinese on their menu. We ordered Afghani Chicken, Butter Tandoori Roti, Mutton Biriyani, Veg Pan fried Noodles and mixed pan fried Noodles.
Coming to the taste, the Butter Tandoori Roti was the best I have tasted till date. So buttery and so soft. It was amazing. The Afghani Chicken was tasty. Big pieces of Chicken in a whitish gravy. The taste was on the sweeter side. Still tasted pretty great. The amount of the Mutton Biriyani was very good. My Biriyani lover friend had a hard time completing it. The Mutton piece was cooked to perfection. Very tender and moist. The pan fried Noodles both veg and non veg were huge in terms of quantity. In the veg one, there was baby corn, mushroom in generous portions. The mixed pan fried Noodles was filled with prawns and chicken along with mushrooms. They were too huge to finish for a person of moderate appetite.
The place is located near Baliya, a few minutes before Garia station. It's better to take the Garia-Garia Station auto from Garia Sitala Mandir stoppage. The restaurant is a 16 seater place. It has a takeaway facility too. And the prices are pretty reasonable. Overall a great place to dine at if you are in the area.

i dont know why my earlier review was not here. I came to know from one of my Friend about this little joint near Garia Station. After crossing the dhalai bridge we need to take left towards Garina Train Station. The place is quite far from my residence. Initially i was skeptical about the quality and thought the rating might be over hyped.¬† It was a take way order for Tandoori Chicken and biriyani.

Tandoori Chicken : It was having an excellent Marination, Good Portion size and tasted yummy. This can be compared with many popular Tandoori Chicken Joint. The taste is so good that it is not advised to use any artificial color to lure foodies. however the portion size is very important which they take good care of. Just one odd thought if a little brush up of fat (Ghee / utter) just before plating/ packing might add more taste onto it.

Last Visit We ordered Drumstick: that was also tested very good and my mom also liked that. though it was sauted but little crunch could be felt and succulent pieces of Chicken would melt on your mouth.

YEsterday We ordered Spl Mutton Biriyani: Some how i did not like this taste and the fried onions sweetened the flavor of Biriyani. it might we due to the reason we took that after a long time. But good portion of biriyani.

On top of that the person sitting at the counter is very gentle and well behaved.¬†
The rating would have been 5 but just because of the Biriyani I am restricting it to 4.5./

If you‚Äôre really a foodie and a ‚Äúbig eater‚Äù and more importantly, have the heart to try their rich biryani and special kebabs from Chef Alladin, don‚Äôt miss this one.

Situated Near Garia Station Road, 45 Bus Stand, Garia, Kolkata. Easy to locate. But the restaurant is very small, but adjustable. A nice and cosy place to spend an hour or so. You won't regret  at all. Please note they mainly serve for take away and delivery. And for dining in here, seating arrangements isn‚Äôt that good. It‚Äôs just cozy place.

Order anything off the menu and it will be up to the best standards. They serve the best authentic chef alladin special biryani I‚Äôve ever had.

Been to this today for LUNCH.

Starters:

1) Drums Of Heavens : 
These chicken drums of heaven have a crunchy and crispy feeling as you bite into the soft chicken pieces. 

2) Chef Alladin Special Cheese Kebabs:
This kebabs are mouth-watering delicious!! A smooth creamy mixture of cream cheese. 

3) Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish:
Chilli Garlic Pepper fish, that is what I like to call fish manchurian. It is a Chinese style fish curry, to be more precise Indo-Chinese dish. Restuarants serve it as Fish chilli, fish manchurian, chilli fish etc.

4) Crispy Chilli Shrimps:
Loose chilli prawns are crispy and spicy snacks made with batter coated prawn which is deep-fried.

Main Course :

1) Chef Alladin Special Biriyani: 
One of my favourite. This biriyani isn‚Äôt something to ignore. Cooked to perfection. It‚Äôs tastes the best when had with their delectable mutton, chicken and egg.

2) Egg Biriyani: 
This egg Biriyani is a great treat for egg lovers but it‚Äôs awesome. 

3) Singapore Fried Rice:
A sumptuous rice dish with a zesty flavour, the singapore fried rice is made of perfectly cooked long grained rice and a horde of veggies.

4) Masala Khulcha: 
It‚Äôs very soft and fluffy bread. Tasted good and awesome.

5) Hot Garlic Fish:
Fish in hot spicy garlic sauce is a classic Malaysian dish. It‚Äôs soft and good.

6) Kung Pao Chicken: 
Just one word: AWESOME üíï

Desserts:

1) Kesari Firni:
It‚Äôs kesar or saffron coloured  and flavoured sweet dish. 


Overall, it‚Äôs very good. One of the finest restaurant to go of chicken kebabs and chef alladin special Biryani. The great aroma of Biryani will always remember when you eat Biryani anywhere in India. Served fresh. Good quality. 

Will definitely visit again.

Everything was good but I liked the Cheese Kebab and Garlic pepper fish.

Main Course we had Special Biryani which had both mutton and chicken, the alu (potato) tasted good.

Perks of being a bong foodie. For me any kind of restaurant strikes the hunger in me more ü§ó
Been to this place today for lunch .
Ordered for
1.Drums of Heaven
2.Crispy Chilly Prawn
3.Chef Aladin special Biriyani
4. Mutton Korma
5.keasar Firni

Starting with the service. That was quite well and quick.
Drums of Heaven is a must to have dish from this place. Specially stuffed chicken leg pieces with seasame seeds sprinkled on top. They were very tasty. And a bit spicy on the note. As I have lots of apetite for spicy food it got managed well for me.
Next came the crispy chilly prawn. Tastes good. Prawn in red chilly sauce.
Allison's special Biriyani is a must have for all. The good looks that they maintain in all of their dishes is well manageable and appreciated. Yes their Biriyani will serve you with one piece of egg,one piece of mutton/chicken,one piece of aloo. Yes. They have got it all üíì
Mutton korma was delicious. The mutton pieces were extremely well cooked and soft. Tasted goo too .
It was served in a small stellen work. Looked pretty cute for me .
At last the breaker .
The kesar Firni .
It was awesome and tempting. Having one will not satisfy your mind . Give a thought for another one üíì

My lunch was sorted.
So is yours? If not. Head on to Chef Aladin. Opposite to 45A/B bus stand. Garia.

Happy burping!

Being a foodie, i love to go to various places to try out their delicacies. Recently i went to Chef Alladin along with my friends. Its opposite to 45A/B bus stop near Garia Station. We ordered Drums of Heaven, Chicken Cheese Kebab, Chili Garlic Pepper Fish and Crispy Chili Shrimps. Loved the flavours of each one of them. They were very tasty. The Chicken Cheese Kebab needs special mentioning because it was beautiful. The cheese flavour added more texture and flavour to the kebabs. Now coming to the main course, i had their Lucknowi Mutton Biryani, Mutton Korma,Singapore Fried Rice, Chili Garlic Fish and Kung Pao Chicken. Being a biryani lover, I absolutely loved it. The mutton was soft and the flavour of the biryani was soo good. The mutton korma was beautiful. Had a bit of the chinese part- the fish was soft and the chicken was soo yummm. The fried rice was good too. It was loaded with chicken, eggs and prawns- what more can you ask for? Loved it completely. Lastly we ended our meal with firni and it  was sooooo good. Though i am not a firni lover but i quite liked this. It was perfectly balanced. Well i will surely go to this place again to try their other delicacies. 
Highly recommended: chicken cheese kebab and biryani.

In every part of Kolkata, every month¬†one to two restaurants are opening simultaneously. from small street food joint to a big restaurant. last two weeks I visited several places which I used to go during my college days, most of the places either filled with new restaurants or old restaurants changed and reopened with a new name.¬†I am talking about Garia station road from where the bridge ends, and the roads going towards 45 A/B bus stand, near Garia. during my walking time, I spotted 8-9 restaurants, some of them old and some of them quite new ones.‚Äù Chef Alladin‚Äù a small place around 12-15 seater, but it‚Äôs like a hidden gem for me.

Chef Alladin, this is truly a hidden gem for sure and is one of the best food joints available near Garia Station. This place serves both very good north Indian food as well as delicious Chinese dishes. Location wise it‚Äôs located in a prime location on Garia station road . They mainly do takeaways but they also have a small air conditioned seating area just beside the takeaway counter. The seating area is quite small but the service was excellent. They will always be ready to make you feel comfortable at any cost They also offer different type of rolls which are very good. If you ever visit Garia Station road area then you should definitely‚Äã give it a try. Recently TeamPanchPhoron was there for a food tasting event. They prepared a lot of dishes for us which are as follows : Chef Alladin Special Biryani, Masala Kulcha, Chicken Chaap, Chef Alladin Special Mutton Korma, Cheff Alladin Special Cheese Kebab, Pardewala Butter Naan, Hariyali Chicken Tikka Kebab, Tandoori Chicken, Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice, Mixed Singapore Noodles, Mongolian Chicken Gravy, Golden Fried Prawn, Lamb in Chilli Oyester Sauce, Lobster in Chefs Style, Chicken Cheese Momo.

I am a regular customer here for the last 4years or so.
They never becomes boring.Always busy in their classy cooking styles with proper dress ups.And orders are taken in the most polite way.
I have tried almost all the dishes.Soothing and economical.A must try is their Chinese dishes.Kebabs are mouthwatering.Combos are good.
Delivery experience is also superb.except occassionally when everything is not normal....they says beforehand that they cant deliver.It is acceptable.
A must try.
Chef Alladin is the top restaurant in Garia area.Its true.

I had been to this restaurant on 02.07.17.My experience was very bad,I had ordered veg fried rice it was salty and the quality of rice was not good.Mutton masala was pathetic,they served 4pcs mutton it was bony with lots of fat,they had mashed boiled egg.
Total bill was for Rs 550 and I had given a Rs 2000 note I had to wait for 10mins as they didn't have the change ,the man at the cash counter reverted saying you should have told me that you have a big note.
Very poor service and pathetic food.

Yesterday i availed the services of swiggy to get my food from this place. I had the following:-

1. Chilli fish dry - 6pcs of cube like flaky fish wok tossed in chillies,onions & capsicums. The fish weren't marinated properly due to which were bland in taste. The quality of the fish even didn't appeal to me much.

2. Chicken biryani - The quantity of the dish was very generous. The biryani had 1 big potato and a tender piece of chicken. The biryani was very light & didn't have rosewater smell to it. The caramelised onions gave a great flavour. The oil content was well below what found in other places. Loved every biteful of it.

3. Chicken tikka masala - 6pcs of tender chicken in spicy tikka gravy. The dish had a layer of sliced cheese which was kind of unique. A person fond of spicy food would love this dish for sure. Also the coriander leaves adds a great taste to the dish. Also the oil content of the dish is high so some might not like this.

4. Firni - Classic way to end your meal with a chilled firni. The firni had cashews & raisins which gave a good crunch to every spoonful of the firni. The firni itself was decent if not the best.

The place is pocket friendly with no extra taxes being charged. Could be tried for the indian dishes!!

I feel so sorry because I really wanted to give a good review to this resturant. But i can't because of the egg fried rice which was sandy and also had occasional small pebbles which was a big big disappointment.
Other than that, the chicken tikka butter masala that we ordered tasted really amazing with grated cheese on top. The chicken was really tender and succulent and the gravy was creamy and full of flavours.
I guess it was just a bad day for us.

I came across chef Aladdin while surfing for quick delivery around my area. And ordered mixed rice and pan fried chicken momo. Going by earlier reviews i made up my mind to order. The order was received promptly and the rep called immediately and was very courteous and customer friendly. Food was delivered before expected time which won my heart. Food was good but a little salt would have done good.I recommend it and overall a good experience.

This small joint near Garia Station remains crowded all over the year, which is testimonial of its quality. Very much popular with local people. Many will be surprised if I say I have tasted most delicious Biryani in Kolkata in this restaurant. Yes...I am saying this keeping all the legendary names in my mind. Their menu card is quite impressive and tastewise also. But Biriyani here is something above average which contains very less oil. Hope they maintain their quality. Definitely you must give a try.

Schezwan chicken each on the occasion of Marraige anniversary of one of my friend , The delivery was quick although the date was on the occation of Akshay Tritiya , The food was tasty and chicken was well cooked but what i found the salt content was little low in the Maanchurian Chicken
 , apart from that it was a well and good experience overall

Located at a distance of around 10 mins from shahid Khudiram metro station, this place was one of the first first joints in this area who understood that ppl where were looking for good food. I think the place is running well due to its price range, courteous behaviour of everybody including the owner n also delivery option. 
One of my fav dishes that they serve is pan fried chilli wings dry. Fish fry, chilli garlic noodles n biriyani also can be tried.

This should be hidden gem for sure. The place is famous that even the auto rickshaws have declared it as a stopage. Rolls kebabs biryani are the specialty. The takeaway counter is forever crowded. It's hard to get to grab a bite on a busy Sunday evening but once you get one bite and you will realise it's worth all the effort. I went with my girlfriend and decided to go for Chinese and I was amazed by the food. Hakka Cantonese noodles with chicken in schezwan sauce and honey made a delicious combo. We did even try the malai kebabs. It's indeed impressive. Although the seating arrangement is tight but the staff members and the owner have a huge heart. Very courteous and helpful waiters. Overall I would I say I have never tasted such food in Garia area of such taste and affordability. I recommend each one of you to do visit.

The food is really good. the seating area is quite small but the service was very prompt. ¬†They were ready to make you comfortable at any cost. I booked my table for a 21.30 slot and got it when I reached there. I was unlucky as biriyani was not available but the tandoori roti, butter nan, lacha paratha was really good. The kulcha was really fantastic. We had ordered momo, drums of heaven, chiken tikka masala and mutton masala. Check before you order if you don't want carry home the extra. It is value for money. You can try.

The best place to chill with your buddies is surely this place! The place serves you everything that you need to make your day a memorable one! Starting from ambiance to deserts , there is no flaw that you can pin point at any course of time! The waiters are really polite and they serve you with utter care and attention! Their badsahi biriyani deserves a special mention and their combo meal packs are really affordable and impeccable!! This spot is a must visit if you have not visited it yet!!

Hilarious restaurant. They have a range of item, unfortunately most of them are below or just average. I found there only biriyani good to eat. In terms of cost, though they charge at per or little lower from other good moghlai restaurant in the city.

Healthy and Economical too.
Rolls are just yummy here.Momos are filling also.
After ordering 2chicken biryani,one chicken chaap,one tandoori chicken,the bill was 460.This was enough for three of us.
Give them a try,as it is worth every penny.

Chef Alladin is one of the best food joints available near Garia Station. They serves very good north indian food and also delicious Chinese dishes. Location wise it's very easy to locate it's just opposite to the 45A/45B busstand. It's‚Äã a basically takeaway counter but last year they have also added a small A/C seating area just beside the takeaway counter, you can also enjoy the food there . Chef Alladin also offers different types of special rolls which are very good. Apart from the food their service is very quick and prompt. If you live near Garia Station or Balia region then you should definitely‚Äã  give it a try.

Before beginning with my review, let me help you locate this place. This restaurant is situated in the Garia Station area at Chhoto Bot-tala (locally called) opposite 45B/New Town - Garia Station/Belur Math - Garia Station bus stand. Moreover, since it is located on the roadside one can easily spot it.

Management is undoubtedly customer - friendly and likeable enough. This place remains almost always crowded but the good thing is that the keep their orders moving smoothly. Obviously a huge no. of orders will take take some time to deliver but they manage to work out on it fast.

As soon as you approach you will feel something classy about them (well atleast I felt). The chef hats, the dress, their cooking style filled my soul.

Now coming to the most important part, food. Its good - i mean really good. May not be that very much super excellent to many, but its absolutely worth the penny.

So far I have mostly tried the rolls which were really impressive. Fillings inside were perfect. And lately I have had Plain Naan with Chicken Bharta (which I have been waiting for long to try out).

An innovative dish very beautifully prepared with strips of chicken accompanied by kasauri methi and a half boiled egg. A perfect companion for naan.

To my knowledge, a single naan is okay for 2 people with medium hunger. Size is quite big and most importanly TASTY. Soft and filling, sweet in taste perfectly baked.

Happy eating!

is there any scope to give negative markings? no. nah. Thus God saved this place from getting -ve rating. 
this place was never in my card until one day I was passing by it with thousand butterflies in my stomach.
firstly, there was no one to guide me through the menu. when I asked about a certain dish I was told that its less spicy which i found  later was made up of Schwann sauce and its too hot and spicy. 
So, the first thing I ordered was Crispy Chilli Baby corn- and what i got is RAW chili baby corn. They served me raw baby corns with some crispy coatings. 
Next was Lachha Paratha- the only edible item that day. 
the last was Devils Chicken- a dish with entire chicken. Served red hot. it was too hot for me. 
I had to left half of the dishes and it was a horrible experience for me.
I can't think of visiting this place even in my nightmares.

Chef Alladin you have utterly disappointed me this time. This is my second time I ordered food from this joint. Last time when I ordered naan, bharta and paneer butter masala, it was indeed lip smacking. This time I decided to try out their Biriyani and firni. My order comprised of Mutton Biriyani, firni and chicken do piyaza. The latter turned out to be extremely delicious but Biriyani didn't stand up to my expectation level and the Mutton was so stiff that could not   eat it. Never tasted such worse firni ever. Will never recommend anyone to taste Biriyani and firni from chef Alladin. Am highly disappointed. I ordered for 3plates Mutton Biriyani and two firni. I had to throw the entire thing. My money got wasted. Now I have to think twice before ordering food from this restaurant.

Today I ordered Takeaway from this place, the food was delivered just shy of an hour. The food was good but there is a lot of room for improvement, I ordered Badshahi chicken biriyani, Tandoori roti and Paneer butter masala. Let start with the biriyani, the rice was soft and one the moist side with superb aroma and taste like the ones we find in the renowned biriyani houses, but the chicken was very dry and fibrous, which means the chicken was way over cooked. Then we have the Tandoori roti, oddly it felt like as if it was made entirely out of Maida which didn't make any sense to me, traditionally Tandoori roti are a bit crisp in the center and soft around the edges, but this one was more like a soft bread through out. And lastly the paneer butter masala, the taste and color was good but there was no gravy at all, It was very dry. all together I Had a hard time. Overall Taste wise the food was good but quality wise a lot needs to be done.

Usually I purchase food items from the outlet. But , out of curiosity we (my wife and self) wanted to visit the restro last Sunday, 31st. July, at lunch hour and besides eating we also carried away some item. Our experience was not a very jolly one, for both the food we ate there and carried away too. The man who was hosting us was a bit pushy in suggesting items and also coaxed us to take more than usually we are served at other retros (e.g. "No, one plate of Fried Rice is just sufficient for one person only. You have to actually take two plates". ) The rice used was obviously not fresh boiled, must've been from overnight stock. Moreover, though he assured that no egg will be used since we reported that we both are allergy-prone to egg, we found that egg was used in the take away food. Though we reported that we won't like hot item and he assured too it will be served as we would like, one take away item, again suggested by him only, ¬†was so hot ¬†that we had to throw that away too. Anyway, at least the boy who later came and took over from the previous one was very courteous and obliging in hosting-disposition. Of course, this comment does not mean we won't be visiting and purchasing again.

Tried their AC restaurant today! There is a hell and heaven difference between the restaurant and their take away!I think zomato should keep provisions for reviewing them separately as hardly any parity can be drawn between the two!

* The takeaway is a big spacious establishment that has innumerable options of roll varieties,momos and other interesting and reasonable combo!Both quality and hygiene is looked after! I am in love with their jumbo sized egg roll and have tried many many other varieties of roll - chicken kebab ,roll to name one of them!Since its the most decent food take away at that place it attracts quite a lot of crowd!

* The restaurant on the other hand is the most congested place I have ever come across in my life!!I wouldn't recommend it to anyone claustrophobic...it has a total of 4 tables and 12 chairs but not more than 6 people can sit together! On the waiter's recommendation we took chicken shahi biryani ,Punjabi chicken and a cold drink... We had asked him to suggest spiciest of the dishes and to our great disappointment the dishes were anything but spicy... The presentation of the biryani was excellent and the Punjabi chicken was not a gravy dish but a curry dish!! And both lacked a considerable amount of salt!The waiter too was in a great haste! He asked us for the bill just 5 minutes after we got the food! Moreover even while we were eating he kept moving things on the table and once even my spoon clashed against his hands!! Given the little space it was extremely irritating! But this little restaurant didn't compromise with its hygiene and the food though lacked in salt and the spice factor was not there yet it was not absolutely bad! It was okay!! Prices too aren't that reasonable given the ambience and the service.
Overall there is a stark difference between the take away and the restaurant!! Try the restaurant when some simple food is what you want to try!

Located just opposite to the 45B bus stand near Garia railway station,this place pulls a fair bit of crowd considering the fact that it doesn't have much competition in that area. They are better known for their takeaway items. Their rolls are seriously amazing. The parathas are crispy and the fillings are fresh and delicious. I have tried their egg roll,jumbo egg roll,chicken roll and each of them were very impressive. Had it been only for takeaway counter then I would definitely have given 3-3.5.
The 2.5 is mainly for the new a.c. restaurant they have recently opened just adjacent to the takeaway counter. The restaurant is pretty small and would get congested pretty easily. There are 4 tables out of which 3 tables have 4 chairs each and 1 other table has 2 chairs. The tables with 4 chairs prove to be insufficient for 2 people so I wonder how they expect 4 people to fit in. They have a variety of dishes. Zomato doesn't have the updated menu so I thought of adding the pictures of the latest menu card along with my review. Do check them out before visiting.
Coming to the food part,we had ordered a badshahi biriyani,punjabi chicken and a glass of cold drinks. The amount served is quite good but somehow the quality was missing. Both the items were ordered after asking the waiter for suggestions of spicy dishes. None of the items we ordered according to his suggestions were spicy and both the items lacked a considerable amount of salt. The taste wasn't bad though but at the same time we didn't enjoy the food. So the waiter doesn't have much idea either about the dishes or about the word spicy. Hence,don't take take his suggestions. The roll counter actually made us have a high expectation from the restaurant too and maybe that is why we were disappointed. 
Lastly,the hygiene of the place is good as of now. The food they serve are so-so in taste,enough in quantity and hence it's not a bad place to try out at all.

Date Of Visit : 23/03/2016

The Place &Location : Situated at Garia station road near Belurmath and New town bus stand. It was Holi and i opted for this place to take away lunch. A place with variety of options in Indian and Chinese, as well as in the area which lacks presence of resturants. Its right on the main road so it gathers a good crowd and gets more flying customers also. This place is a take away joint and also haveA.caccomodation for dining as well. They prepare the tandoor items outside at the take away counter and other dishes inside. Running a resturant successfully with having less competition and serving delightful tasty food to customers. The prices for dishes are reasonable and service is quick. They maintain proper cleanliness while cooking and behaviour of working staff is good.

The Food : It was a special occassion of Holi and i decided to go to for their Indian dishes. I tried  two items and they are 1. Chicken Biriyani, 2. Tandoori Chicken.

1. Chicken Biriyani : The first thing i liked about their biriyani was that it was low in oil. But the other thing that disappointed me is the taste. Biriyani with an egg, potato & chicken makes it a complete one but all drowns away when you find less taste in it. Though the chicken piece given was huge in size and the rice used was good but i felt like eating a plain rice somehow made with chicken and other ingredients. I heard a lot about their biriyani but on my visit it was a disappointment. I advice that they should give more emphasis on Biriyani which is one of their trademark item..    My Rating : 2.5/5

2. Tandoori Chicken : Chicken pieces were so nice and it looked so juicy and yummy. It was nicely cooked but saw the masala got stucked in the bones rather it should flow in between the cut areas of the piece. Very nicely made with tasty spices and it was soft too. Had it with the green chatni and salad but the dish is no so much commendable as i heard about the items of this place. Overall this dish was ok and what could be expected more in a locality which has few places for serving food. 

Overall Experience and Recommendation : For this place my ratings would be : 

4/5 for Ambiance

4/5 for Service

3/5 for Taste

4/5 for Reasonability

A place with wide variety of dishes which has conqured the area in its grip and trying to serve at their best shot.  But i guess there are few loops which are needed to be fixed. Their Tandoor & Kebab items are good and value for money and their rolls are favourites( as heard by locals). The best part of their restaurant is the reasonability and the quick service. More could be achieved by covering up the demerits. Overall i felt 60% satisfied.

Earlier, Two times I had tried taking home delivery but they said deliveryman is not there. It was a bit disappointing otherwise its worth a 4 stars!!

But, the garlic chicken was horrible. There was hardly any chicken in it. Those were just dumplings of flour, fried and then dipped in the gravy. May not order again....

I stay at Garia only. This place is very close to my place. Chef Alladin is very near to New Town-Garia Station Bus Stand. The quality of the food is too good. The behaviour of the staffs is great. If there's a home delivery...they themselves call the customer before delivering the parcel. The thing you have to do is just give a phone call to them and then just sit back and relax(for home delivery purpose) and for sitting at Chef Alladin and having food is also a nice and cool experience for the foodies. ;)

Sometimes back I went there. It is situated between Garia station and Welkin near to the State surface bus stand. I opted for take away Chicken reshmi kebab and mutton biryani. Mutton biryani was dull in taste and very much dry. But Chicken Reshmi Kebab was really delicious -soft big tasty chicken pieces. Everyone should try that once.

The food is great the service is good and most important the quality of the food is of top quality. The biryanis especially the alladin special biryani and the lucknovi chicken biryani plus the rolls the chaps are worth of my every penny moreover the firni is also pretty good.

Located near garia station this resturant has become a landmark in its area. i stay in this same location so i often order from them.very few resturants in this area provide good foods. its food is 8 on 10. lack of space problem has been resolved ¬†& a small sitting is availble with AC. behaviour of staffs are great 8 on 10. best item i found was mutton korma.. tandoor is also good.. price reasonable at par with other resturants . i would reccomend it to try & go for it. & ¬† rolls * biriyani's are also good..specially chicken rolls.

Finally a decent restaurant has popped up in the garia station area! Anytime u come here,u will see a big crowd waiting for their food,which actually is tasty BTW... :). I hv mostly tried their rolls,which are more or less filling and properly made. Their biriyani is nice,with generous quantity. I also like their moghlai paratha. Hv tried out some of the Chinese items as well which are good enough. Their chicken kabiraji is quite unlike I hv had in sometime :). Now they hv a dine in place and the staff is cordial. Overall, I can recommend their food :)

In or around Garia, looking to grab a quick bite and not let it be a bite in your pocket? Look no further.
- Great biryani, and fast food.
- Polite, welcoming staff. 
- Fairly priced.
Do we really need more? Sadly, people these days find KFC or Domino's more appealing. Shed a few drops of sweat, spend next to nothing, and yet enjoy true Indian masala, right here, folks!

If you are in a hurry but you feel your stomach is in more hurry to hurl up something..then on roadsides you are at the right place. With its appealing name Chef Alladin restaurant not only would they take care of your condition being in a rush but with a little restaurant they have, you might relax a little and have it if you have time.¬†
The dishes I tasted were really up to mark . I often have some regular snack at evening... mainly chicken roll, or egg roll from here.
But more than that they have their Chinese and North Indian platter which I prefer to have at times and that only from here. ¬†The Chinese they serve is really appetizing, yep a bit too spicy but what a chinese without being spicy. But obviously they would care about your views, and the one borrowing should be telling to reduce the spices.¬†
The one I like here the most in my 'At times' dishes is the Chicken Biriyani here. It really has the Kolkattan Biriyani flavour and I love it to have delivered to home cause I order it mainly for my family. And another speciality is their home delivery that has never given me a chance to be dissatisfied with them.¬†

Finally I would say that a good food always leaves behind a good impression forever. And I will be on my way to Chef Alladin any time cause they have already impressed me with their delights.

I love the food of chef Alladin. I and my sister ordered crispy chicken and momo¬†to take away as there is no place to seat, but I have to say the food was really good. I asked the owner to open a place to dine-in. I was informed that the restaurant come dine-in will open shortly. it is satisfied to know that next time when I'll go to chef Alladin I can fully enjoy my food. looking ahead for the arrangement of dine-in.

Basically I visit this joint frequently. I like the food. The quality and quantity of food that is served here is nice. Only problem it is still now a take away joint and there is no sitting arrangements which I feel will be resolved very soon. When we go out to have some food, what we want? Cleanliness, good quality and most importantly good quantity and a reasonable bill amount. Chef alladin serves the purpose.

A fast food joint with average quality of foods (mostly oily) that doesn't provide you any quick service at all. Any way now they add AC restaurant and also arrange wifi service which are quite astonishing for small joint like Aladin.

The best biriyani I had from here was then when it opened during the pujas. It was of quite less price but the quality was good.  As one might say the price and quality have now become inversely proportional

No Alladin's magic in the cuisine at Chef Alladin
1 out of 5

The name is quite appealing but the food is not appealing enough to go with the name of the restaurant. Located at Garia Station Road near 45B Bus Stand, Chef Alladin is a small takeaway joint with two tables and a few chairs placed on the sidewalk to provide basic dine-in. Eating on the road can be very annoying but one can ignore this if a restaurant serves you really mouthwatering food. But after tasting their food once, you won't feel like returning here again. 

I had the displeasure of being there few weeks back, and I was very unsatisfied with their overall service. They serve both Chinese and North Indian platter but cannot prepare either of these properly. I ordered a Chicken Roll while they were preparing my takeaway order. Firstly, the roll was too oily with very little chicken and lots of onions and sauce; left me wondering if I'd ordered an onion roll! 

For takeaway, I ordered Murgh Biriyani, Veg Hakka Chow and Chicken Hakka Chow along with Chicken Bharta and Chilli Fish. None of the items in my list were up to the mark; in fact, much below average. Next - the Chinese preparations were very oily and were not prepared properly. In addition, they did not have any Chinese flavor in them and were absolutely tasteless. Oiliness is a huge problem in any item made here. The same goes for their Biriyani and Chicken Bharta. The biriyani was edible but not too great, and the Bharta was swimming in oil and not well prepared at all! Overall, the food was very badly prepared and very unhygienic as well as oily. 

Despite my terrible experience, I saw this place overcrowded. Don't know how or why - but I guess it's good for the owner. I am never going back though!
