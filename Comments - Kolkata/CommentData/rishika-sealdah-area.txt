Rishika is a small eatery located near B.B Ganguly Street, Sealdah.

Shabby ambience.

Prompt service.

Tried very simple menu i.e, Romali Roti & Chicken Tadka. The food was nice, a bit oily.

Price is economical.

Rishika is a small restaurant located near Sealdah station.

It serves a variety of dish ranging from Bengali homely food to Chinese and a few North Indian dish too at an affordable price 

Service is pretty quick.

Tried Mixed fried rice & Chilly Chicken. Both had sufficient quantity and tasted nice. Though both were oily and nothing spectacular but still not bad also. One can try this place to satisfy hunger pangs at a very affordable price.

Rishika is a decent dining place for casual bengali dining. Located very close to the sealdha station this place do attract a big crowd to have lunch or dinner here. Living close to Sealdha I have been here two three time. Their food is good I will say. I have tasted only their Bengali food menu. And each of them tastes good I will say.
And their prices are also reasonable. Most of the small outlets near Seladha serves lower quality food and charge same. So Rishika's price range is good.

Working in a hospital at Sealdah and yet not being aware of Rishika would be blasphemy. It is one of the rare restaurants serving Bengali food to families at a decent price, and boasting of variations in the palate all the same. I have frequented this place on multiple occasions to satisfy my hunger pangs, and filled myself with hearty and simple food. The service is ap propos. The food is nothing spectacular but good enough for the average Bengali taste buds. An indispensable finding indeed, if one happens to be around the Sealdah station.

A very small restaurant located near sealdah station, beside purna lodge. Been there several time, and honestly speaking they really cook well. The only negative thing i have ever noticed is they don't use good quality of oil and the food will turn completely orange ( if you know what I mean) if you keep the food for 2 hrs. Overall experience is average.

When hunger pang bit us one late afternoon, we ordered the chicken biryani from Rishika. The food wasn't a disappointment. In fact, the rice was kinda flavourful and not just yellow coloured rice that one would expect in such small joints. The chicken was of substantial size. Overall, a good experience for those sudden hunger pangs at odd hours when the 45 mins delivery time offered by Swiggy seems too far fetched.
