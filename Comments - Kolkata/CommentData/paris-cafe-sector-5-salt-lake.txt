So my experience is always so good over here. But today it was a little disappointing. We visited the cafe on the 2nd of January and the staff who served us was so polite and warm taking care of little things and speaking well. The mushroom crepe was delicious and the french toast was on point. I don't know if the staffing and the chef has changed but today the guy at the cafe was not very presentable. And the french toast was too soggy, we got it changed but no improvement. Plus the blueberry cheesecake we ordered was not fresh at all. We requested the waiter to change it but the chef denied saying they couldnt cancel. Paris cafe being my one stop fav i expect a better experience and the previous staff you had at your cafe. Thank you

This was my 3rd visit to Paris Cafe... As usual the food tasted delicious... The staff is really friendly and helps you choose the best from their offerings... Service was quite prompt... And the pricing is very reasonable as well... Although this place needs a bit of a makeover... Overall a really cosy place to hangout with friends for a casual lunch...

This is a relatively spacious cafe situated on the ground floor of South City Pinnacle, Sector 5, Saltlake. The ambience of this place is quite beautiful with it's all glass surrounding and it's furniture resembling the obvious. The service from the staff is also worth appreciating. They are fast, responsive, friendly and professional.
Coming to food, we liked what we ordered, except their Red Velvet Cake, which in my opinion tasted bland and uninteresting. Besides that, everything was great, especially the main course dishes, they were stunners and quite value for money options in my opinion. The shakes and rest beverages were nice too and finally, their Rainbow Cake is now one of my personal favourites.What we had :-1. Hot Chocolate - must try2. Hazelnut Frappe3. Green Mango Mojito4. Irish Coffee5. Chicken Tetrazzini - must try6. Pesto Chicken Parmigano - must try7. Fish Steak8. Red Velvet Cake9. Rainbow Cake - must try
Overall, my experience here was quite good and I'd definitely recommend the place to everyone out there.

The place is not that big. It's pretty though. The red velvet pancakes where in reality a disappointment. The service was slow. Even though there was only two other people in the whole cafe. The only good thing was their lasagna which genuinely tasted well. I might not visit there again because it wasn't anything extraordinary but the prices are too high for what they serve.

Originally it was the craving for blueberry Cheesecake which landed me in this cafe. Its just 2-3mins walk from college more, located on the ground floor of south city pinnacle. Nice ambience with merry music and cozy seats, this place is sure to strike a chord with the crowd of sector 5. It's a treat for the eyes to watch their dessert items on display.No wonder I ended up ordering a slice of red-velvet cake and rainbow cake, in addition to blueberry cheesecake. I was a let down a bit by the taste of Cheesecake, yes I have tasted better. But, the red-velvet cake made up for it. But the rainbow cake was the show-stopper. It was so pretty, so light and fluffy, so creamy, so yummy, with just the right amount of sweetness. They call this cake 'dream come true', and rightly so. Do not give this cake a miss.
P. S I am definitely coming back here.

This place is at the ground floor of my office building, I have crossed this place infinite times during the last 8 months, went there few days back.

Known for its fish delicacies, so tried some fish items.. fish steak, coriander fish and baked bhetki with smashed potatoes. Also tried the kitkat shake and snicker shake. I must say that the food was great. 

Although this place attract the office goers in an around the cafe, but I feel you must give a visit soon.

Ordered the american breakfast - sausage, eggs to order, hash browns, bread, baked beans - overall pretty well done - nice and tasty. Quantity was quite filling for me. Only complaint for me was that the beans had been poured on the bread - i prefer if all items are packed separately. Also the taste of baked beans is slightly low. But nevertheless, it was nice.

This place is situated in the ground floor of South City Pinnacle building. It's a cute cafe with all glass walls. Small and cost it had the perfect ambiance of a cafe.

I ordered a

Pizza All Gamberetti: it was delicious. The shrimp is well cooked and the taste is well balanced with the spicy note a bit higher. The thin crust holds true. Its delicious.

Tea: I couldn't sit in a cafe without a tea, hence i ordered one. It came with a small cake. I didn't like it much as it has some kind of pungent taste. I couldn't figure out if it was intentional. There are good number of options for tea lovers.

Cake: Cafe also screems cake. And i couldn't resist myself from ordering one after seeing the options beautifully displayed. The cake is nice and not overly sweet.

Overall marvelous experience. Would go there again.

We were at Eco Park and Wax Museum before and had to skip our lunch to enjoy these places and this made us hungry as hell! Searched in Zomato and we found this Cozy little place with beautiful interiors near Sector V College More.. Heard about the Ballygunje outlet and was on my wishlist for a while now. And to find a new outlet in proximity was a surprise.
The ambience was well lit and the seats were comfortable. The interiors had western touch to them. The staff were courteous and helpful and took great care of our needs.
Coming to the best part which is the food as it should be. We started off with a Jalape√±os cheese chilli on toast and it was great. Then ordered Caramel hot chocolate and a Cappuccino assorted with hazel nut and both were amazing. Truly something that the doctor ordered rainy windy day.
The main course had cheese sauce spaghetti with American corn as add on and a Grilled Chicken steak. This was my first time trying spaghetti and it was so worth it. Every bite made my mouth fill with cheese sauce and they served a garlic bread with it too. Grilled chicken steak: prefectly grilled breast pieces of chicken, with smashed potatoes mixed with mayoneese and sorted veggies were extremely delicious and a must try for Chicken lovers.
Rainbow cake certainly lived up to my expectations and they wrote a customized message for my girl as well.
Overall this place is great and a must visit if you are in sector v and willing to eat good food without burning a hole in your pocket.

Situated in a prime location . Sector 5 college more. 
Starting from decor , chair table , even the cushions on the chair gave me the feel of Paris that too sitting here in Kolkata. We ordered chicken lasagna, ginger chicken wings , rainbow cake , oreo shake. 
 Chicken lasagna was great . Ginger chicken wing tasted so amazing , so unique. Actually I didn't eat such sweet n soury chicken wings before . Rainbow cake is thee speciality which was soooo yumm.
But the last one disappointed me.the oreo shake. It didn't taste like the oreo one actually .

I pass by this place every day while going to and fro from office. I knew about the hype this place had so finally thought of giving it a try today for lunch and experiencing some French cuisine for a change.
The place is very cutely decorated and all the ladies out there will surely love this. Also, it's a great place for a date. They have an amazing collection of cupcakes and other bakery items like cookies.
Now coming to our part where we went for lunch. We were two people so we decided we'll take one chicken based and one fish based dish. So we ordered the Grilled Chicken Steak and the Cajun Rubbed Fish.¬†
-The Grilled Chicken came with mashed potatoes and boiled veggies like broccoli and bell peppers. It had two portions of chicken breasts that were so tender and soft that it will titillate your taste buds!¬†
-The Cajun Rubbed Fish came with a side of boiled and herbed rice. The Bhetki fish which was rubbed with Cajun spice was absolutely lovely! It had the right amount of spice that made it neither too spicy nor too less. The red coloration gave it an amazing look.¬†
-So for the desserts, we tried out one of the most hyped dishes out here called the rainbow cake! Guys and gals, this deserves a special mention! This will blow your mind as you never had a cake like this. 7 layers of cake with VIBGYOR colors and it wasn't too sweet as just perfect to my liking! Finally, this dessert ended the day on a good note.
Another great thing about this place is that they have no specific time for lunch or dinner. All dishes are available at any time. This place deserves a 5 rating for the overall experience. Do give it a try!
Hope this review helps!
Thanks,

Zomato says this cafe is 'A Hint of Paris in Kolkata'. Well is it? Let's find out.
Firstly, the location , imagine a calm, secluded , comfy zone (with coffee) in the mayhem of office madness. I know right....feels like sorted for life! I think maybe that's what Paris is, busy one moment and quiet in another. 
The d√©cor, could do with a few additions but the table setting and the embroidered cushions were refreshing. The presentation took the simple yet classic route , embellished by a touch of romance here and there. The food  ranks high on the palatable scorecard but I was disappointed with the Rainbow cake. It sure looked dreamy like its name but could have tasted better. 
Paris Cafe screams out ; no fuss, just good food with reasonable prices. 
Je vous remercie Paris Cafe! It was a wonderful experience.

I was so disappointed with everything. Zomato's 4.1 average rating had led me to bookmark this place and pay a visit to this place as soon as possible. But all went topsy- turvy. Let's share my experience.
Being a Tuesday evening the place was not crowded at all. We ordered some oreo smoothie. Nothing was special about it. Then we tried fish and chips as per zomato recommendation. It was superb. It comes with 3 pieces of fish and french fry.
Next we tried grilled chicken pizza. Trust me Dominos or pizza hut serves a way better quality of pizza in this price.

Then we tried some brownie smoothie which tastes exactly same like that oreo smoothie. However we decided to have a try their pastry section and opted for a rainbow cake. This was the most deceitful looking cake i had ever have. It looks like damn cute but taste -_- . Not worthy of its price at all.
In spite of all these we agreed on giving a 3 rating but then came the service. This was so pathetic. Like an almost empty cafe ,how long do you wait for a pastry?

If you are looking for fancy place and fancy expensive but not so tasty food. Go and try this place.

This is the place to go when you are in Sector 5, hungry and if prefer to die out of hunger than touch Chinese, Mughlai or North India. The ambience is very welcoming and you can have a nice conversation while you enjoy your food. Talking about the food it is 'Delicious', it not only fills you stomach but also your heart. Also if you stay in New Town or Salt Lake, I would highly recommend that to look it up for its appetising breakfast menu....

O decided to review this place on pen and paper only after my fourth visit. I was not disappointed even once. Very affordable, quaint old world interior decor, this place is a gem. The grilled chicken steak is good, the mashed potato comes just with the right amount of butter. The hero is definitely the rainbow cake which is low on sweet but leaves a lasting taste in your mouth. A must visit.

Cozy ambience+Good food+Great companion= Sunday afternoon sorted
After planing for a long time atlast dropped in for lunch today. All glass wall, high ceiling, quirky decors gives the small cute cafe a great appearance. Staffs are warm and courteous with quite a fast service.
We ordered cappuccino, chicken wrapped prawns, pizza prima vera, rainbow cake and red velvet cheesecake.
Cappuccino, total ‚ù§served with a cute li'l sponge cake.
Chicken wrapped prawns were decent sized prawns wrapped in succulent chicken slices in a mustard base sause served with frsh relish was a blast for the taste buds.
Now comming to the pizza, i know though egg plants in pizza sounds weird but it tastes briliant. Full of fresh veggies with a lot of cheese on a thin crust pizza was better than any of the pizzahut or domino's one.
Ps: make sure finish the pizza fast otherwise it becomes a biscuit.
Last but not the least, actually the best, the desserts.
The rainbow cake , a complete sweet heart. Soft, light and creamy "Dream come true".
And the red velvet cheesecake, sweet chocolate cake with salty cream cheese heart üòòüòò
I was full but can't stop myself to have it and took almost an hour to complete both of them.
Highly recommended place, atleast i gonna visit again.

I am very fond of this place..... it could be because of the little little things that this cafe has and does that just plays the right chord inside of you or it could just be the energy and the vibe. I picture Paris Cafe would be so apt or complete if it was just on a higher floor instead of the ground floor, giving one a good/better view and for that brief moment you could pretend that you are living in a beautiful clean and a romantic city. This place just managed to capture it and almost transport you there. Food is delicious and well served and their hot beverages are served with style. They have a good bakery section. All in all, if you are working in sector 5 and feel like giving yourself a quite moment and tea, drop by this place and check it out.

Dropped in for a late breakfast. And this place swept me away! The vintage feel, the comfortable chairs with embroidered cushions, and the old world charm- coupled with awesome food make this a must visit. We ordered their American breakfast, pancakes, cheese omlette with toast,pannini, and Cappuccino. They serve a soft sponge cake with tea/ coffee that melts in your mouth üòÉ .Tried their Formosa and Karakorum variants of tea too,and chocolate and lemon macaroons.
A memorable breakfast indeed!

We visited this place today evening. Location is close to IEM inside the south city pinnacle premises. We were the only occupants . It has a very soothing and classy ambience, surrounded by glass walls on two sides. Waiters are decent but a little unprofessional and inattentive. We ordered brownie shake, hazelnut frapuccino, chicken wrapped prawns, fish Florentine and rainbow cake. Both the shakes were perfectly balanced in terms of flavours and consistency and very well presented. Chicken wrapped prawns consisted of five pieces of fairly large prawns wrapped in chicken and tossed in a kasundi based gravy. Taste may be a bit tangy for some but we liked it. The fish Florentine was not upto the mark. The chunks of fish were over fried and salty and the dish lacked flavours. Rainbow cake again was presented very well, taste was good. The bill came around 1300. There are many other dishes on the menu worth a try. Overall, a nice place to hang out .

When two ladies decide to meet for a cup of tea, Paris Caf√© sounds like the ideal place to be. And that is exactly what me and my sister did, although we did not meet for tea. For a hot day, we settled for cold coffee with¬† brownies and a vermicelli fried lemon fish. The fish was a bit over cooked, which made it slightly dry, however the dip was rather tasty. The prices of the food were pocket friendly. The interiors of the place are well done and very cozy. Would love to visit this place more often.

What I ordered : 
‚Ä¢ Insalata Greca 
It is a wine marinated chicken breast with olives and mushrooms on a bed of fresh iceberg lettuce 
‚Ä¢Grilled chicken steak 
This is better than any normal chicken steak since the pieces were tender than any usual steak while the mashed potatoes were super creamy and the vegetables had the required crunch
‚Ä¢Chicken Tetrazzini 
It is a cheese lover‚Äôs favourite. The creamy spaghetti baked with cheese to perfection with hidden juicy chicken pieces inside the cheesy spaghetti nest and it is served with a piece of toasted bread.
‚Ä¢Grilled Miso fish and meat Tokyo style platter
It has a good serving of healthy brown rice along with grilled chicken pieces, potato wedges, stir fried veggies in butter sauce and wasabi fish 
‚Ä¢Red Velvet cheesecake 
JUST LOOK AT IT. LOOK.
I‚Äôm a huge fan of cheesecakes as well as red velvet cupcakes. I loved how both complemented each other. The presentation would get a 100 undoubtedly 
‚Ä¢Oreo Cheesecake 
The crunchy oreo base with creamy Philadelphia cheese was to die for. Brownie points for the cookie on top.

This place is nothing short of brilliant.
A must go place in Salt Lake sec 5, Kolkata.
The ambience is amazing, seating, lights and that astonishing mirror, I cant enough of this place.
We had a veg pizza, cheese garlic bread, cappuccino and caramel hot chocolate. Everything was perfect. The cheese garlic bread might do with a bit more garlic, but non the less it was crisp and tasty.
Superb place to be at, my new fav place in town.
PS - Caramel hot chocolate comes with a small chocolate spoon, quite a nice touch.

I love this place because its beautiful. Its interior and the seating and the whole look is amazing. We had rainbow slice which was amazing. Red velvet oancake with chocolate sauce which was ok. We also had mushrooms and broccoli raghu which was basically rice served with cheese sauce. Its was really nice. This place is expensive.

Finally !
Paris Cafe has Re-opened in Sector 5.
But is it still that great ?

See, i do not hav a sweet tooth.
But the fluffy pancakes with maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream is just perfect here and i "USED TO LOVE IT", until now.

Sadly, it has degraded the consistent standard of service. The place looks still the same even after the renovation. Other than the huge glass wall built, i dont see anything new. The chandeliers have been removed as well.

Least i care about the decor, as long as the food is good. But u guys have degraded drastically. The pancakes were just too raw and undercooked. Pancakes were No more "Fluffy".
*Sigh*

Even the staff agreed with us and were apologetic about it.

I had been recommended to this place by a friend and today I finally had a chance to visit this pretty cafe.Though its a little difficult place to locate if someone is not really familiar with the area,once you reach there, the cute decor with comfortable seating makes the search worth it.Anyways with the glass walls and high ceilings and the wooden furniture the cafe has a elegant and classy look.So full marks on the ambience.
Now coming to the food,we ordered poulet a la sicilience, cordon bleu and chicken lasagna.Out of which cordon blue was really tasty.Neither red velvet cake nor the rainbow cake was available so we couldn't taste it.However the bill came up to 1100 for three item so its little on the higher side.
The Service was good and the staff are really courteous.
Overall it was a good experience and we would want to revisit again to try their dessert collection.

This outlet is quite difficult to locate in sector 5. It is minimally decorated. They serve quality food. We ordered pommier.. And green mango mojito. The mojito was very refreshing with mint lemon and green mango slices.. The pommier was just about ok with apple flavour. Then came our chkn mushroom olive salad in pesto mayo dressing.. It was delicious. Then came our chkn crepe.. Very cheesy but tasty. Lastly we had spinach corn baked canneloni.. It was yummy.. As takeaway i had brought their rainbow cake, tart, lemon coriander bhetki with cous cous, grilled chkn and veggies stuffed panini and penne pasta in mixed sauce with shrimps. Very tasty all the items.. The bhetki fillet was quite big and awesome and flavourful. The desserts were mildly sweet and very delicious and light.

After a long drive in the cloudy yet breezy morning I hit this place for breakfast. The place has a quintissential ambience reminiscent of a cafe seated on the downtowns of Paris, which totally makes it worth visiting. I was impressed by the selection of furnitures, cutlery, wall shades, lamps, and chandelier. 
We ordered an English breakfast platter, mushrooms on toast, chicken and cheese panini and rainbow cake as I couldn't control myself from grabbing atleast a  spoonful.
The mushroom on toast was the best. Perfecto !
The sausages on the English platter seemed overcooked, the chicken breast was tough, while the other components were decent. How can you screw up something as basic as an English breakfast?
The paninis were tasty but the accompaniment of mustard mayo and another sauce didn't complement the main dish. Rainbow cake was beautiful.
The staff was courteous.
I would love to revisit the place.

This place has a great ambience and a wonderful decor. You'd almost think for a while you're in actual Paris. The petite wooden furniture and eccentric wall hangings really work up your fancies.The lasagna was an absolute delight. The pancakes were light, fluffy and perfectly shaped. The mushroom crepes and rainbow cake were almost the best in town.¬†Highly recommended, though a little high on the pocket pinch.

You might struggle to find this hidden gem but after having food here you would be happy that you have spent the effort. Very good continental choice of foods and equally good desserts and shakes. We had a chicken wrapped prawn and a fish florentine, both tasted amazing. The red velvet cake was very good so were the coffees and frappuccinos. I should specially mention there ouef crepe which I order every time I'm there.

A fabulous eatery chain! Perfect location, transparent glass walls and soothing experience; i couldn't expect more. Although the first branch is located at a stone's throw from my home, I didn't get the opportunity to visit this eatery until today.
The seating and the decor is perfectly collaborated with its name. The menu resembles a slam book from our school days and has enough Continental and Italian cuisine to choose from.
We went for Baked Potato with Spicy Mexican Rice, Grilled Miso fish tokyo style platter, Fish Steak and Cheese Sauce Penne Pasta to please our tastebuds.  
The Baked Potato with Mexican rice was the winner with Pasta as runners up. Large Baked Potato with sweet corn and cheese lavishly spread softened the spiciness of the Mexican Rice. The two were a perfect combination. The Pasta was soft with adequate cheese, brocolli, bell peppers and corn. The non veg section was also promising with Fish Steak being the favorite. 
The cafe has a surplus of options to quench your thirst or to satiate your sweet tooth. We were overwhelmed by The Brownie Shake and the Watermelon Mohito served at this place. The former contained a huge chunk of Brownie and smaller ones in the shake while the latter was a fruit based refreshing drink.
Overall I can't expect a better experience and can't wait to try out its other branches in the city.
Cheers!!

A brilliant little cafe/patisserie for breakfast. Though the menu is a little limited compared to a full fledged breakfast cafe, it has some unique items, like quiches. We tried:

1. Espresso - 5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Now espressos are usually espressos, but what sets Paris Cafe apart is the cute little sponge cake they serve with it, on the house]

2. Mushroom Quiche - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Soft and fresh, the shrooms practically melts in your mouth]

3. Rainbow cake - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[The spinge base was pretty soft, and not overwhelmingly sweet]

4. Hazelnut Pop - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[A little stronger on the sweeter side, this hazelnut and chocolate popsicle gives a good sugar rush]

5. Oreo shake - 3‚≠êÔ∏è
[More of an oreo smoothie than a shake; missed the signature crunchiness]

The decor reminded of European Renaissance. Staff is extremely polite. A hearty 4‚≠êÔ∏è to this outlet. Good job üëè

This place has written good food all over it!
Situated in the ground floor of South city pinnacle building, this cafe will give you all the feels of a cute quirky cafe, with sunlight pouring in through the doors. Small and cosy this cafe is superb!! 

Starting from food- 
1. Sweet chilly baby corn: Yum yum yum in my tum! I am a baby corn ardent lover, so for me it was perfect. Served hot, crispy and a lil sweet preparation! 
Taste-4.5/5 

2. Pizza Primavera- after a looot of contemplation and confusion we ordered this one coz I wasn't sure how a honey mustard dressing would go up on a pizza but taking the risk I ordered it and I did NOT regret it a bit! 
We asked them to change the egg plant to onions coz I cannot eat egg plants! This pizza comprised of onions,zucchini, brocolli, with cheese and honey mustard dressing and it was so yum!! Thin crust pizza is the best!! Did not make u feel loaded and taste on point. 
Taste-4.5/5 

Drinks- 
1. Green Apple Mojito: very fresh, sweet and sour, green apple pieces and cool. Very soothing. 
2. Watermelon breezer: another cool summer drink, but made a lil too sweet. Otherwise superb! 

Desserts (my favourite part) -
1. Chocolate nutella crepe: I had originally planned to eat red velvet pancakes but I read some reviews online and decided to go this crepe instead and I m telling u (take my WORD) this is the most sinful yet soulful dessert you 'll have! I mean I would have regretted if I had not eaten this. 
Thin crepe folded with nutella inside served with whipped cream and apple on the side! (Check photo); this dessert is a MUST HAVE!!! 

2. Dream come true: rainbow cake . This is the fluffiest, most smooth, light pastry I have ever head!! So well prepared. Love üòç 


Overall a marvellous experience,can't wait to go back and try other dishes soon!!!

I visited the restaurant yesterday on a Saturday night. The restaurant was empty which surprised me. The decor was beautiful however I felt that the place had worn out, especially the glasses were not clean. The menu is elaborate and it will take sometime to decide the course. We started with chicken and spinach chowder soup. It was served with garlic bread. Loved it! The main course was Bhetki with potato wedges. It was served warm, the Bhetki was fresh and spicy. The preparation was definitely Indian (not french...erm) but yeah it was a tasty dish. I was disappointed with the order of Prawns platter. The presentation of the dish was superb but I found it tasted little salty and stale. The portion was too little for me and my partner and we felt that we could eat more. We ended the meal with pastry with an excess of walnut and chocolate. It was yummy! Overall I would rate it 4 for the courteous staffs who could make up for the whole experience!

We visited Paris Cafe on a Friday afternoon just before the Pujas. Must say loved it. Good company and good food make for a great day. The ambience is pretty okayish, there's room for improvement there. We straight away dived for the menu. We ordered Chicken mushroom crepe, Fish Florentine, spaghetti in Aglio Olio sauce with chicken and corn topping and grilled chicken steak. Grilled chicken steak with mashed potatoes was not very much to my taste, it was rather bland. The fish Florentine was very good, having come in garlic spinach cheese sauce. The crepe was quite decent. I personally fell for the spaghetti. Loved it!!! Dessert comprised of Rainbow pastry and red velvet cheesecake. Loved the cheesecake. I would definitely recommend this joint. Looking forward to frequenting this place.

Paris Cafe, an excellent foodpub in Kolkata, located at Sector V Saltlake has a major make over and it's took a comeback before the puja. Recently on their pre-launch days, I was invited via #MunchingMonks to have a first taste deep. Grand thanks to Sneha Singhi for invitation, Mr. Aloke Das for awesome food and hospitality. And of course to Tanmay Basak for leading us

They have many things to cater your taste buds, but to make it short - it has three main categories - beverages, desserts and main courses & starters. I enjoyed all of the three sections, but their dessert section caught my eyes, I mean my tongues were so flattered that I could not concentrate on the others. 

We had been offered these desserts: Macaroons of lemon,strawberry and chocolate; La Success full of Hazelnut, Red Velvet cupcake, Mocha and their signature Rainbow Pastry. 
 And yes I am giving their dessert section 5/5. Paris Cafe's Macaroons are one of the best I have tasted in India. ¬†

Their main sections have some great gems, and they are not much pocket friendly. The pricing are at par with gastropubs of Kolkata. Roasted chicken legs will keep you warm with their mustard sauce. It's bit tangy on tongue, but tastes superb. Calcutta Bhetki is a french twist to Bangali's favorite Bhetki fish. Chicken Wrapped prawn would make you float into fusion cuisines. And the last Jumbo Prawn & Mushroom comes with a smell which would stir a supernatural phenomenon to the olfactory as well as taste buds. 

The decor is minimalistic but soothing, ambience is great and so helpful and courtegious are the staff of Paris Cafe. 
 And lastly don't think much, do the rightfully sin to your tongue and stomach by visiting Paris Cafe.

We went there mainly for their unique collection of cakes and tried the following:
1) Dream Come True - This is the rainbow cake that this place is so famous for....
2) Red Velvet Cheesecake - This is another must-try of this place....
Both these cakes totally justified the hype.... They are great both for your Insta stories and also for your gustatory cells....

We went there yesterday evening. The looks and decor will impress in the first glance itself, they used soft pastel colors for creating a warm environment. The place is relatively small with an odd 11-12 chairs and small round tables. The seating arrangement is also quite nice.

Coming to food, we both were quite hungry and so ordered quite a lot of food.

We ordered brownie shake, caramel cold coffee, ginger glazed chicken wings,chicken lasagna,ouef crepe and La Success Hazlenut Sponge cake.

Brownie shake was quite thick with lots of crumbled chocolate cookies and brownie. It was good but not the best that I had.

Caramel cold coffee was quite good. The drink had sweet and bitter taste in perfect proportions and will not make you feel heavy even when you gulp it down in one go. I liked it quite a lot, definitely better than what I had elsewhere.

Ginger glazed chicken wings was awesome! The dish had 5 pieces of chicken in decent size. The sauce, the texture, the taste everything was perfect. The chicken was soft and juicy and yumm!! A must try when one visit this place.

Chicken lasagna was good. It was chickeny (if this word even exists ..!) and cheesy . The amount was quite enough for both of us.

Ouef crepe was the best of all that we ordered. Its a heavy dish so dont go by its size. It had an egg layer outside and inside there was chicken, mushroom and cheese. A heavenly dish for any chicken and cheese lover (like me..!) On the top it had a fried egg. Suprisingly it was served with two sauce . I am not very sure but was one mayo and one was mustard (maybe). A definite must try.

La Success Hazlenut Sponge cake was the last one we had. It was quite sweet . Since we both were so full , we decided to take this as a parcel.

Apart from all this , I would to add that the people there were quite cheerful and helpful , always ready to tell you which one would be better if you are stuck anywhere. We were the last customer to leave and they patiently waited for us. A very good job guys !

Paris Cafe ? Famous among all the foodies in Kolkata ( outside Kolkata too). As Paris is known for art, fashion and gastronomy; our little Paris in Kolkata is not less in any of the above. Paris Cafe is fashionable in its looks, artistic with its glass walls and gastronomical journey is known to all, still I will be guiding you more about their journey.

Cheers to the entire team and management for such a lovely gesture and hospitality. The place surely give

‚óè Cappuccino pure love ‚ù§.
‚óè Red Velvet cupcake is one my favourites.
‚óè Moka something hidden behind the name. Rich chocolate sauce with coffee flavour a beautiful combination.
‚óèLa Success Hazlenut Sponge cake a with Chocolate cream and a chocolate leaf shaped on top.
‚óè Macaroons of 3 different flavours. Lemon, Strawberry and Chocolate.
‚óè Rainbow cake with caramel cream on the outer layering.
‚óè Virgin Mojito helps you to have refreshing evening.
‚óè Strawberry Milkshake

The new menu launched recently by the Paris Cafe¬©

‚óè Calcutta Bhetki fish marinated with harissa sauce on potato wedges with corriander rice. (4.5/5) The spicy and lemonated masala on the jumbo Bhetki fish is grilled perfectly. Value for money. Worth trying.

‚óè Pommery mustard marinated with roasted chicken legs served with vegetables and spinach. (4/5) Chicken legs roasted perfectly. It was juicy and yumm.

‚óè Leeks & wine cooked jumbo prawn & mushroom in prawn shell. It is served with sauteed veggies and mushroom duxelles. (4.5/5)

‚óè Nasigoreng Spicy chicken & prawn rice served with grilled chicken egg poach on the top of the rice. (5/5) Personal favourite. Strongly Recommended.

‚óè Chicken wrapped prawn slightly piquant citrus salsa. (5/5) Innovative dish i got to try. Fried crispy prawn wrapped inside a chicken kebab and taste so yummy. Just wowo! Personal favourite. Strongly recommended.

‚óè Poulet a la sicilienne (4.5/5) Sauteed chicken with bellpeppers & garlic mushroom.

Wonderful evening we had. Great place to visit to try some continental dish.

Paris Caf√© is one of the leading cafes in Kolkata, owing to its picturesque ambience and excellent food. I've heard of Paris Caf√© quite a lot but never had the chance to visit it, so when I was invited to the Sector V outlet, I was thrilled!

The first thing I would like to mention is the lovely d√©cor of this place - dewy interiors with a sophisticated feel. This outlet is much more spacious than the first ever outlet of Paris Caf√© at Ballygunge. Today, Paris Caf√© boasts of 4 outlets all over Kolkata. We chose our seats next to the glass wall which overlooked the busy street, and it was a pleasant experience. Mr. Aloke Das greeted us, and suggested us a number of items to try out.

So let's start!

We decided to order 2 mocktails and 1 shake - Green Mango Mojito, Watermelon Freezer and Brownie Shake. Each of the above items were made to perfection. The first one was very refreshing and had the zing of green mango. The Watermelon Freezer turned out to be excellent as well, although I was a bit apprehensive while ordering it. About the Brownie Shake, I don't have words to describe how amazing it tasted!

Moving on to Starters :

‚Ä¢ Cheese Omlete - We decided to start our day with this gooey omlete which was oozing which cheese. 3 eggs were used to prepare it, and it was served with garlic bread. Usually this dish is served with two slices of bread, but garlic bread was specially given for us. The omlete was fluffy and cheesy. I absolutely loved it!

‚Ä¢ Lemon Vermicelli Fried Fish - Fillets of fish were crumb fried in Vermicelli which gave a unique texture to the dish. The fish was soft and juicy and had a slight tangy aftertaste due to the lemon element.

‚Ä¢ Ginger Glazed Chicken Wings - This was one wow started that left me awestruck! I haven't ever tasted such a perfect preparation of Chicken Wings. The flavour of ginger was perfectly balanced and gave a unique flavour to the dish.

Coming to the main course :

‚Ä¢ Chicken Lasagna - This was heavenly! When the dish arrived on our table, I couldn't take my eyes off it (this speaks volumes about the presentation, which was top notch!). This was perfectly made which oodles of cheese sauce and tomato sauce. There was a generous stuffing of chicken and cheese in between the lasagna sheets, which was then baked to perfection! Please, don't leave Paris Caf√© without ordering this delicacy!

‚Ä¢ Citron Coriander Fish - Another bomb of a dish. The fish was soft and succulent and again had a lemony flavour. It was served with a portion of cous cous. Now my only disappointment was the cous cous as it tasted pretty dry. I suppose butter rice or herb rice could be a better alternative. But mind you, the fish tasted absolutely brilliant!

Desserts :

‚Ä¢ Dream Come True - You can't leave Paris Caf√© without ordering their much hyped rainbow cake. And I understood why it is so hyped! It deserves all the hype and much more! It looked picture perfect sitting daintily on a white plate. Oh how I loved the look of it! With the first bite, I fell in love. It was soft and spongy and had the perfect amount of sweetness without giving you a sugar rush! I loved it absolutely!!

‚Ä¢ Chocolate Nutella Crepe - If you haven't tasted this yet, you're missing out on life! This is the most coveted and sinful dessert, Paris Cafe has to offer, and boy, you need to taste it! The crepe was thin and was loaded with Nutella and topped with chocolate sauce. It tasted divine! Another dish I can't explain in words!

Paris Caf√© is a must visit! All these years, I've heard about their wow desserts, but on trying out their food, I must say that their food items deserve the hype as well. Each and every item tried by me tasted fantastic! On top of that, the service and hospitality was top notch. This place deserves more than 5, and I would gladly rate it much higher than I can right now!

All my love to Team Paris Caf√©! You made my day!

Paris Cafe had been one of the most trending places in the since its inception. A major credit of this goes to the much hyped Rainbow Cake, which had been named as Dream Come True. I had tried it once in the Ballygunge branch and it won my heart. Paris Cafe was then one among the few places who had rainbow cake in their menu. Today, Paris Cafe has four branches in the city. I was really excited when I got invited at the Sec V branch.

The Sec V branch is the most spacious and perhaps the most gorgeous among all the branches of Paris Cafe. It was a Saturday morning and the place was bustling with people. As I and

I longed to visit Paris cafe after my friends uploaded Snapchat stories of the rainbow pastry. The place has decent decor and seating arrangements. There were 3 of us so we ordered- spinach and ricotta cheese cannelloni, tomato mozzarella crepe and mix sauce pasta. The pasta was pretty good but other two dishes weren't up to the mark. For deserts we had the eclairs and rainbow pastry of course, for which we had to wait for about 15 mins since the waiter tripped and destroyed the first one! 
Will visit again for the deserts!

You can hardly find a restaurant decor which gives you the feeling of Louvre Pyramid. Located at the ground floor of South city pinnacle of sector 5 the glass decor welcomes you with variety of French cuisine. There's was a shortage of time at our end so we decided to order Chicken Mushroom Crepe, Prawn Cocktail and Dream Come True Rainbow Pastry.

Service was very prompt.
Food - 
M/C Crepe was the best.
Prawn Cocktail was a okay.
Rainbow Pastry tasted as good as it looked.
The total pinch was approx 750.
Overall the experience was excellent ,would like to visit soon.

The cafe did all their spending on the cheap decor that they intended to be cute. I really wish they put more effort in the food than they did in their decor. I have been to this place 4-5 times and was disappointed every single time. But just today I ordered their La Salad Saint German Avec Paulet (Random bad-tasting salad with enough salt to feed a small European country who eat salt for dinner). The portions are small enough to satisfy infants only. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy even. Extremely dissappointed.
P.S. : don't keep the option of food delivery if you intend to deliver shitty food with no effort at all in presentation or taste.

Paris cafe is very close to my office. So one day we decided to try the food here. We ordered for a hot chocolate, a pizza, lasagna. The hot chocolate tasted so good and perfect and was served with a spoon made of chocolate. The food was also too nice, well herbed and cheesy, just how I like it. For desserts we ordered for chocolate fudge pastry and red velvet and damn they were spot on. I haven't tasted such nice deserts in a very long time.

Though this is in close proximity to my college I never actually visited it untill few days back. I went there with a friend at early morning hour, they just had opened and the place was full of flies. It was so irritating and disgusting, after almost 20 minutes they started with pest controlling. 
I had ordered for watermelon juice and my friend had ordered for caramel cold coffee. I loved both of them, the drinks and service was good no doubt. Just the flies made my mind to change for ordering any food. Hope to visit a hygienic and pest free Paris cafe on my next visit.

This place has got an amazing decor. Its made of glasses so you can see the greenery. We ordered a salad called La Salad Saint Germain which has got olives and pesto mayo dressing. This salad is a must try. The sauce is really well made.  We ordered a saffron sauce cannelloni which is a bang on dish. It has got the right balance of flavours. Margherita pizza had the perfect crisp. There was a potato based dish in BBQ sauce which was also tasty. Mushroom on cheesy toast is a hit. The macaroons are to die for. üíï The only drawback is that their quantity is not good. 1 dish is not even enough for 3 people.

Sneha Singhi,the proprietor of this place and a Le Cordon Bleu diploma,has learnt from the best in the business.Paris Cafe is a testament to her reporttoire.She's bought French cuisine,which is the mother of all cuisines(as self-proclaimed by the French themselves),to good old Kolkata. When you think of French food,it most likely involves a glass or two of red wine,some freshly baked baguette and cheese in a dainty bistro.With that picture in mind, Paris cafe is not yet quite there.But it does it's job of being a melting pot of French delicacies and a melange of other dishes which include Italian lasagnas,Russian stroganoffs,Thai red curries and the works.But the piece de resistance is the bakery showcase with colourful cakes,pastries, cupcakes and macarons of all shapes and sizes.Despite everything,you would still miss a lot of classics,for examples the ones portraying the five French 'mother-of-all-sauces' or perhaps a croquembouche as a centrepiece.But that's wishful thinking with the constraints involved.

The decor is an elegant marriage of dainty meets baroque,overall a lavish treat to the eyes.

Coming to the food,I was here for a solo brunch and I went for a grilled chicken and mushroom crepe,red velvet cupcake and chocolate macaron.

1.GRILLED CHICKEN & MUSHROOM CREPE(3.25/5)-A thin crepe filled to the BRIM with grilled chicken and mushrooms nested in a bed of white sauce and topped with a dollop of mustard.Huge quantity,extremely filling but a tad bit bland which was taken care of with a heavy-handed dusting of chilli flakes and oregano.

2.CHOCOLATE MACARON(5/5)-If you love Sunfeast dark fantasy choco fills,this just takes it to the next level.Creamy,chocolaty filling in a crisp,brittle almond case,I died and went to heaven after eating this.

3.RED VELVET CUPCAKE(3.25/5)-I don't fancy red velvet that much and find it too sweet for my palate.This cupcake was moist and one of the better red velvet offerings I've had.But that wasn't enough to convert me.

The food is value for money and the overall experience is unparalleled. Definitely looking forward to my next visit for their grilled chicken steak, rainbow pastry and a slice of Parisian sunshine.

On another occasion,I ordered in their
DREAM-COME-TRUE PASTRY(4.5/5).The pastry did justice to it's name and tasted better than it looked.The buttercream frosting was absolutely lightly,the layers of cake was soft and moist and overall the sweetness wasn't overpowering at all.Pure love.üíñ

From the juicy Grilled chicken steak (served in a bath of butter garlic mashed potato, sauteed vegetables and a herb flavoured gravy) to the pretty and yummy Red velvet cake decorated with the little mini hearts, everything was pretty perfect.

With an elegant ambiance and charming antique d√©cor like chandelier, ornate mirror, dainty furniture, European kitchen-like decoration evoking a soothing retro vibe, this eatery designed to look like a French caf√© indeed invites foodies to savor a hint of Paris in Kolkata!

We ordered Margherita Pizza which was oozing with fresh creamy mozzarella, chunks of tomato and basil.

The Chocolate Fudge Pastry mostly consisted of  yummy gooey dark chocolate but tasted fantastic when consumed warm.

We followed these up with Fried Eggs sunny side up accompanied with triangular bread toasts, Garlic Cheese Bread which was so very crisp and delish, and finally Cappuccino decked prettily with latte art on top.

Mention must be made of the cute heart-shaped spoons. The quaint menu booklet, the classy glass-walled interior are also noteworthy.

Enjoyed a lovely evening of Parisian affair with delightful lip-smacking food at Paris Caf√©. üòçüòä‚ò∫

service was also okay.nothing much to complain about.But I found the food little too expensive.It tasted very nice.But the quantity they give is not value for money.We had Cajun rubbed fish and baked fish.both were equally good but very small portion.Rainbow cake is unnecessarily over priced.one piece comes for Rs.177 with all taxes where as there is nothing really special about it.Rainbow cakes are just made with colours.Even keeping the cream light cannot make it so expensive.

Ordered some tomato and pesto panini and cheese omlette via home delivery.The omlette was a three egg omlette with really low seasoning,very less cheese and quite stiff,this place having a french influence I had some real high hopes for the omlette but all was in vain.Never again am I going to try omlette from here.The panini though was quite impressive,really crispy toasted,good amount of pesto and oregano went really well with the tart tomatoes.Though the fries served with them was extra crispy,almost the full potato was crispy which I did not like.I was really eager to try the deserts but unfortunately none was available at that time so next time will surely try some sweet stuffs from here.

Being located in my erstwhile office building, i have known this eatery since its inauguration. Back then, this place was an oasis giving u a very premium feel in terms of food, service, ambience. However, over time, things have gone downhill a little. Frankly i was disappointed a little when i last visited this place. One of their waiters had become flustered when the place was full one afternoon. We had entered the place to hear him say outright "sir, orders will take time". The tone was more like - sir, come some other time. Our group comprising of four people, quickly decided to settle for chicken sandwiches, to which we were told it would take 1 hour for the sandwiches. üòè We all left in a huff. I returned another day to sample the lebanese veg curry. My friend took grilled mustard chicken. Chicken was good. But the veg curry could have been made with some premium veggies. I was disappointed to find only potatoes, chana, baby corn etc. They could atleast use some premium veggies like mushroom, asparagus etc which is commensurate with the premium price. Another thing is, the place could do with some pest control. It does not exactly give u the best dining experience when u have flies all around u. But make no mistake, this place is still one of the better cafes in Sector 5.

So, I went to this place and obviously with my expectations high as this is what you expect from a cafe everyone has been talking about.Being honest, they totally nailed it.We ordered a hazelnut frappuccino , a mojito, chicken & mushroom crepe, a red velvet cupcake and mushroom volcano. The crepe was outstanding as described by my friend..( As I am vegetarian, so I am relying on this and I assure you, he is the same level of foodie as I am...) ... I loved the frappuccino and the mojito was equally good..The red velvet cupcake melted in the mouth and I could say wow...You will definitely enjoy the little efforts they put in adding to austhetics of the place ...Notice the spoons, the cushion covers and you will be able to justify the name...The service is fast ...Do try the mushroom volcanoes, you will definitely enjoy the blend of mushroom, cheese and their effort used as filling...Loved the place ...

There is nothing wrong in being a "wanna be" unless you become the thing that you want to be.

The look:

This place tries hard to become the happening place in the locality offering everything at a lower or rather moderate price but falls on its face.
The tables are dirty and so is the door which you would push in to enter.
The seats are awfully dirty; you might consider washing your jeans once you have taken a seat on the chair.

The food:

Offers you delicious names on the menu but provides very little of the edible stuffs.
A glance and a small bite for re-assurance was enoungh to claim that the fish finger which were served to us was burnt and overcooked and what was left of it was only charcoal.

Would prefer to stick to coffee if I ever pay a visit.

The service:

Out of all the service held it all together in place and we were well attended to.

Over-all the place need maintanence and needs cleaning.

P.S: The pics posted are deceptive; you have no idea what fish charcoal tastes like.

Paris Cafe...as the name suggests it would take you to Paris ..the decor is old world with small bolsters to soothe your back..... the menu is extensive...there is enough and more to cover all tastes...from Alfredo to pesto to crepes üòã..the drink list is exhaustive from good old Darjeeling tea to a varied choices of caffeine free drinks and green teas..so you can visit even if you are in controlled diet..We ordered for Stuffed Chicken with Garlic bread, Fresh lime to drink and ended with Nutella crepes so soft n yummy loaded with Nutella and chocolate so I was tripping..the only thing that spoilt the experience was the loud music which I feel is quite unnecessary and not soothing at all and the sound that was coming from the kitchen did not give a single moment of peace..I was feeling I am in a carpentry shop with all the noise around me. Also there is a overwhelming smell of food which is not appetising..the request is to improve the ambience by making the place nice smelling and by controlling the sound level...I recommend these place to all...if you want to eat as much as you want or if you are in that phase where you can't eat as much as you want...it's a heaven for foodies and dieters ..üòÄüòÄ

Paris cafe.... is a welcome change to the erstwhile Kolkata food scene.... Authentic yet delicious food that simply weaves magic on ur taste buds. The SALT lake outlet is bigger in comparison to the ballygunge outlet. I along with my friend went to the Cafe for lunch and returned supremely delighted. 
We ordered Baby potatoes in BBQ sauce, grilled chicken steak, spinach n ricotta cannelloni in saffron sauce and green mango mojito. Each dish was delightfully presented and tasted fabulous. I would hv order more stuff...Hadn't we be full completely eating all this stuff. Surely going back for more.

The staff was courteous and prompt. The ambience of the cafe is apt as well.

Highly recommended

According to me, this is the best cafe in Salt Lake... Soothing and peaceful environment. Menu is very good. We have celebrated birthdays and many other special days there.

Best. Best. Best.
I'm not going to say anything but that.
You get transparent huge glasses as walls, cages with lights as chandelier idea, wooden chairs, cushions with a hint of French!, bookish designed menu books, and what not! This is like one of my most favourite cafes I have ever been. And the food gets a 100/100.  The Pizza was much more than just 'tasty', the mojito was different than the other Mojitos I had before, and my friend took a Green Apple Pommier which was nice as well. Then we had this Mushroom Crepe, which ironically we didn't like at call. If this cafe lost that 0.5 from me, that's because of the crepe. But believe me, it's one of the most recommended preparation of this cafe, and is even mentioned in Zomato. But unfortunately, our taste buds didn't really appreciate the crepe. Like, we didn't even eat it after scooping two spoons. So anyway, thank God for the best of the best desserts! We took the Rainbow pastry, namely Dream come true and which is btw the best and perfect name for this beautiful piece of pastry! I don't think I can ever get over DCT! And my friend took a Black Forest pastry which looked much better than the normal BF pastries we ever had, and it tasted YUM!! Simply the BEST! I can't wait to have them again. This place is the best! üòãüíØ

Visited Paris cafe today and learned that the water is being served in a glass which was not washed properly and probably a non-veg drink was served earlier and the glass was smelling like fish. On a Saturday afternoon when just 3 tables were occupied, it took them 15 minutes to replace the glass of water. 

Surprisingly, when asked them for the feedback register, I was told they don't have one.

Quite an experience.

‚ÄúParis is always a good idea.‚Äù ‚Äì Audrey Hepburn

With the busy working schedule, I haven‚Äôt been able to post blogs as often as I would like. I have however, been tasting  up a storm, so there will be many food tasting events coming soon.

The Paris caf√© is an institution. No trip to the City of Light would be complete without visiting at least one. There is nothing more French, or more specifically‚Äì Parisian‚Äì than taking a few moments out of your day to sit with an espresso in Paris Cafe , one of the city‚Äôs thousands of cafes.

Paris and caf√©s go together like hand-in-glove, like salt-n-pepper, like mother and child. When you‚Äôve only just arrived, often the first thing you want to do is order an espresso. Sitting in a caf√©, leisurely, is one of the best ways to acclimate yourself to Paris.

There are so many lovely, even ecstatically delicious, pastry shops in around Kolkata but not so many that invite you to come in, sit down, and enjoy that fresh Red Velvet Cream Cheese Cake and Assorted macaroons along with cool Summer Refresher like Water Melon Freezer. This colorful little cafe and tea shop offers the most delicious baked goods. Pair any (or all!) of that with a good, stiff frothy coffee drink or a pot of tea and you have yourself a delicious respite from the claustrophobic city. The location, once you‚Äôve found it, is easy as pie to get to. A bit of Paris crafted bit by bit into a cozy corner of IT hub of Kolkata. The decor is chic and grand, the details are cute and elegant. A mix that has been chosen in the Parisian state of mind.

The laid back atmosphere makes this caf√© an ideal place to meet up with friends for a weekend brunch or for a quick treat before a day of exploration. Both sophisticated and vintage, Paris Cafe is a prime caf√© to linger and people watch for an entire afternoon. With its huge windows and lots of light, as well as the streamlined Scandinavian aesthetic, it has become a popular place to work, so you‚Äôll often see people cranking away on their Macbooks.

The Dishes We Had :

Cappuccino ‚Äì  A classic drink from Italy that is known for its frothy top. Their foam typically had the most elaborate designs swirled on top. Being milky, yet the espresso definitely didn‚Äôt go unnoticed.

Cafe Mocha ‚Äì perfect combination of Chocolate & Coffee with a sprinkle of cocoa, served with Madeleine (Lemon flavoured Sponge Cake). Irresistibly delicious, perfect blend of premium coffee and rich hot chocolate with amazing flavour. You are going to adore this enticing blend of premium coffee and hot chocolate, finished with whipped topping.

Strong cappuccino ‚Äì Robust cappuccino with a stronger coffee taste. Stronger-taste coffee had velvety froth in every sip.

Caramel Hot Chocolate ‚Äì The Best Way to Stay Warm This Winter Is With Boozy Cinnamon and Caramel Hot Chocolate. Nothing will warm you up better than a big cup of Caramel Spicy Hot Chocolate.

Cafe Mocha ‚Äì Visible layers of Chocolate , Coffee, Milk & Milk Froth. Looks extremely impressive. Taking you one step closer to achieving the perfect Cafe Mocha.

Irish Coffee ‚Äì Coffee,Irish whiskey, sugar and cream. A thousand twists. It is an easy drink to get passably right, but a hard drink to perfect. The strong coffee, the dense mixture with cream to float on top.

Assorted Macaroons ‚Äì Chocolate / Rose / Lemon flavoured ‚Äì  I decided to taste all.

1. Pink Rose macaroons ‚Äì A little something sweet to go with the champagne on New Year‚Äôs Eve ‚Äì or anytime, really

2. Yellow Lemon macaroons ‚Äì  I was totally head over heels about this lemon buttercream. It was so light and zesty, sour, yet sweet. Absolutely awesome filling for lemon  macaroons.

3. Chocolate macaroons ‚Äì

all the macaroons were sweet and floral, bittersweet, salty, sweet and sour. I was so tempted to have few more,  but I had no more time and had to stop. It was hard to decide which one I like the most as each of them is so different and I love them all! But still I go with Rose on the street of Paris.

Red Velvet Cupcake ‚Äì  Classic red velvet cupcakes with velvety texture and buttery soft crumbs and topped with tangy cream cheese frosting and few naughty hearts here and there.  However, the color of this cake is not the only reason I loved it so much. it was properly done, this cake had smooth velvet-y texture with soft crumbs. If you have never had red velvet cake before, or never understood what‚Äôs the big deal about it, I urge you to go to Paris Cafe and have these cupcakes right away. Once you have one, two, or maybe three cupcakes in one sitting, like I did, you will understand what I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äì incredibly moist and delicious.

Red Velvet Cream Cheese Cake ‚Äì The Signature Dish. If you‚Äôve ever been to Paris cafe, and if you‚Äôre a Red Velvet Cake Fan‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve probably ordered up the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It‚Äôs kind of the most amazing thing ever‚Ä¶ a red velvet layer-cake with a layers of cheesecake mixed in. topped with few naughty Sugar Hearts. Love was in the air and Love was in the stomach too. It was an absolutely fabulous preparation turned out super moist and perfect. The cheesecake layer softens up and is perfect and velvety in the center.  It‚Äôs almost like a giant interior layer of frosting, except that when you bite into it you realize that it‚Äôs CHEESECAKE instead. So this dessert was like the perfect thing for me.

Grilled Chicken Sandwich ‚Äì Chicken sandwiches, frankly speaking, don‚Äôt exist to excite me. But do try this Grilled Chicken Sandwich which was a delicious way to satisfy your growling stomachs. Sandwich was a juicy, all-white meat chicken breast fillet, marinated in a blend of herbs, all served on a toasted grilled bread.

Mexican Chicken Hot Dog ‚Äì This dish was packed with flavour. This hot dog was grilled to perfection, then topped with jalapeno peppers, salsa, cheese, sour cream and avocados.  Now that‚Äôs a mouthful to say and these hot dogs are a yummy mouthful to eat. There is nothing worse than having too much bun-to-dog ratio. There should be frank in every bite. And this Hot Dog was too frank indeed.

Panko fried Chicken Burger ‚Äì Easy crispy fried panko chicken breasts made the ideal tender and juicy base for these tasty fast-food alternative chicken burgers. In either case these tasty burgers make a very quick and easy workday dinner.

Mushroom Omlette with a Slice of Butter Toast ‚Äì  This was fantastic! I don‚Äôt take Omlette very often, but will now after having this. Fresh mushrooms, red onion and green onion, Everything came together with ease.

Lemon Vermicelli Fried Fish ‚Äì Citron marinated fish, coated with Vermicelli & deep fried. Served with Tartre sauce & BBQ dip. Bring back the Friday night fish fry tradition. Using panko crispy bread crumbs help the crust stay extra-crisp, while the fish remains moist.

Roasted Mustard Chicken with Spiced Rice ‚Äì Despite its pallid complexion, the chicken, roasted with a layer of mustard, was incredibly moist and delicious, the flavors of thyme, garlic and lemon permeating the meat. This Spiced rice was a savory side for many meats. This was a very simple version that would appeal to a wide range chicken palates.

Grilled Chicken Steak with Garlic Mashed Potato & saute veggies  ‚Äì Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. Burst with flavour, chicken pieces were sizzled on a palate along to fulfill tickling stomachs !!

Ginger Glazed Chicken Wings ‚Äì These wings were super tasty with a little sweetness and ginger flavour. Appetizers that can be made day ahead are an excellent way to create more time on the day you are entertaining. These wings were super tasty with a little sweetness and ginger flavour. Appetizers that can be made day ahead are an excellent way to create more time on the day.

Fish & Chips ‚Äì The classic Kolkata Bekti with a french twist.  Awesome fish, awesome fries.

The fish was fried to perfection. The batter is crisp, the fish is flavorful. My personal favorite is to dip it in the hot sauce. The classic tartar sauce is good too, but the hot sauce that they have here matches the fish so well!

At last, it seems that fish and chips has had its chips.

Watermelon Freezer ‚Äì¬†
Green Mango Mojito ‚Äì  Lemon,Mint, Green Mango & King Lime with Soda.¬†
Virgin Mojito ‚Äì Lemon & Mint refresher

Paris Cafe provides customers with an unparalleled experience through its premium location and high quality offerings. We had a BEAUTIFUL SUNDAY MORNING.

Situated on the ground floor of South City Pinnacle building this place is thronged mostly by the IT crowd.It's certainly difficult to get a seat then.
White interiors with high ceiling is what you find as you step in.
         The biggest problem with the place is it's understaffed. Service time during peak hours is very poor. One of the waiters is impolite and impatient. He initially refused us to provide 5 dessert spoons though we were 5 heads.Finally when he was confronted he apologized.
       Our orders include Fish Florentine, Chicken Paprika,Ouef Crepe,Chicken & Mushroom Crepe, French Fries and a Chocolate pastry.
Food quality is not extraordinary but definitely good.The amount served is sufficient for one.The pastry is not satisfactory as the texture is very dry.
The fish served in Florentine is real bhetki and not basa.
       Would like to visit this place again to try the rest of their dishes in the varied menu.

Amazing food. Great service. But not so amazing ambience. 
I would agree that the variety and taste would leave you coming for more but the decor of the place does not live up to its name. The ambience is hardly felt. Though the service is prompt and the quality of the food is brilliant. I would want the interiors to be a bit more lively and Paris-y!! Cuz ambience matters.

Good place to eat, average food, and icing on the cake, the behaviour, I would give 0 out of 10. I have been to this place many a times, but today, Mr Alok, who believes, he is the owner of the cafe behaved in a way that he is providing me food for free, or as if, this is the only cafe left in Sector 5 to choose for. I am sorry to say, even if the food is a little less tasty and the prices are a bit high, would not matter to a customer, than a waiter saying "order dena hai to dijiye humare paas bhot customer hai, phone rakhiye, complain karna hai to kar dijiye, mera naam Alok hai. Kuch nai hoga kariye complain."¬†

Thanks for making us realise that the food was not so good to pay for, nor there is customer service. I wanted to make a complain to Owner and the guy said owner yaha pe nai hai jaha ja k complain karna hai kariye. Amazing audacity of the waiter must say!! I would never in any frame of mind think of visiting this place or order food over phone. Guys, going to this place, please beware, there might be many customers and you may get to hear, jaiye jaiye kahi aur ja k khaiye faltu log k liye ye cafe nai hai humare paas bhot customer hai.....

The place has this amazing decor especially the lights. The calm and quiet environment was just amazing. One can actually enjoy a long chat with pals.
Coming to the food. We ordered latte fish finger and panco fried chicken. The food didnt stand up to the expectation. I felt the chicken was a bit too over fried.

Though I loved the ambiance and also the latte.. üòä

Want a virtual Paris somewhere in the city of joy? Hop into Paris Cafe. It's now flourishing with several branches in the city. The beautiful European decor, the beautiful hanging lights from the sky high ceiling and a silent ambience makes you long for spending some more time. Speak of the dishes and they are exquisite. We had ordered chicken green salad, baked fish, baked Florentine fish and cajune wrapped fish. Do not miss out on the rainbow pastry which is absolutely toothsome! We had to order two. Hearty meals at judicious prices. Keep up the good service!

Tucked away at a corner in Sector 5 this is your special piece of France. The food is awesome especially I loved the Cajun rubbed fish and Baked fish. Their desert and bakery dishes are to die for. We tried out the Rainbow cake slice and chocolate nutela crepe which tastes heavenly. We also tried out salads and Fish florentine which tastes pretty good. What really left me awed was their decor and how well maintained the whole place is. The staff is quite friendly and service is pretty good. The whole place is very well maintained. As far as pricing is concerned it is value for money. The ambience and the food totals a complete dining experience. Will love to visit again sometime.

Have been meaning to visit Paris Cafe since a while now. Finally went to the Sector V branch today. It's a spacious cafe. Decor and ambience is very calm and soothing. It's a good looking cafe with ornate lamps hanging from the ceiling, giving a slight vintage vibe. We ordered Funghi Pizza, Red velvet cheesecake, Rainbow pastry and one chocolate macaroon. The food was delicious. The Funghi Pizza was excellent. Crispy thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and mushrooms. #recommended. The red velvet cheesecake and the rainbow pastry were amazing. I cannot fault it. The heart-shaped cheesecake filing gave the red velvet cake an unique flavour. The rainbow pastry was one of the softest and most moist cakes I have ever had. The macaroon was gooey and well made. Overall I can say I am quite impressed by this cafe :-). Looking forward to more visits.

Pathetic place.
It is very unhygienic with mosquitoes everywhere.
If you don't get food poisoning, they ensure that you suffer from malaria/dengue.
On top of that, very rude, arrogant and misbehaving staff. When we told them about the mosquitoes, he said that there are mosquitoes and they are aware of it and that we have to sit in that unhygienic condition or cancel the order and leave.

Guys, avoid this place and save yourselves from malaria/dengue.

With the beautiful theme of a French restaurant, the ambience is pretty soothing. We solely went for the lasagna and red velvet cheesecake and also ended up ordering the rainbow cake and a macroon. We were greatly impressed by the desserts but the lasagna was a bit disappointing with too many veggies and very less chicken. Service was good, though.

We ordered chicken burger, chicken steak, chicken lasagna (which are not the actual menu names, as the given names are simply weird). I didn't understand why the cost was so much of these items. Even a chicken burger at 'cakes' is less than 80 rupees now and extraordinarily tasty. Chicken lasagna was 'ok', I had better @ terminal 11, and the steak was not upto the mark also! They dress up the food well, but even sophistication without substance is meaningless and can't be of much worth. Totally disappointing.

Went for a weekday dinner with a friend. What amazes me is their beautifully lit ambience. It makes my mood better. We had a round of coffee and then chicken steak, mushroom pizza (fungi misti) and of course the very famous rainbow cake. The steak was good but the pizza was superb!! And the cake was as usual a perfect spoonful to end the meal.

Location: Located on the ground floor of South City Pinnacle at Sector 5. 

Ambience: This place has an old world charm with the distressed furniture and the antique mirrors on the walls. The interior is quite interesting. 

Food:

Grilled Chicken Steak- Priced at 290 INR, this comes with two chicken breats, grilled vegetables and an amazing mashed potato. Purely delectable!

Grilled Spicy Chicken Wrap- The wrap is yummm! And at just 150 INR, it is such a steal. Oh! And did I mention, this also comes sitting pretty on a plate with French fries! ;)

Their dessert spread was too good to resist. But we managed to resist though :P 

Service: Service was good. One bad thing about our experience there was that we found a strand of hair in our steak in the middle of the meal. On informing the waiter, they immediately changed our plate and served us a new dish altogether. This was really commendable on their part.

Pocket Pinch: The meal cost us 500+ INR, including taxes.

We liked the cakes at their other branch and had been waiting to try out their other dishes.. we went there today for lunch around 12:30.. nobody was present.. we were skeptic if pizza and lasagna would be available.. that's what we have come here for.. luckily they were.. we ordered chicken lasagna and chicken pepperoni pizza.. but the food in no way matched up to the dessert.. lasagna wasn't as cheesy as it should be and it contained some veggies which I did not like at all.. thin crust pizza was okayish.. there were very few pepperoni pieces.. for dessert we had red velvet cake.. I did not like the cream part in the cake.. it tasted like butter and did not go well at all.. we had only the cake without the butter.. not a good experience..

Visited today with my girlfriend. Very nice ambience and people. Service is great. We ordered Fluffy pancakes with chocolate sauce, Grilled chicken Crepe, Cappuccino and Red Velvet Cheesecake. Pancakes were really good, grilled chicken crepe was very yummy. Red velvet cheesecake was really really good, we both loved it. Surely visit again for their varieties in main courses and omelettes.

I am a person who doesn't like splurging without a cause and this place doesn't give me a reason! Even after being on the pricier side, this place does not provide an ambience or a platter that justifies the cost. Average ambience, nothing extra ordinary that other places doesn't provide me at a lower cost, this place was a one time eatery for me!¬†
I'd heard a lot about the red velvet pastry there, but i was disappointed at that too as it was over loaded with the icing and cream part which clogs your throat. Again not worth for me!
The good part is the location which attracts the youth and the people working nearby to catch up with their buddies after work.

I am not a big fan of continental food. I like my food with spices and u know 'tadka lagake' but there's no harm in trying an entirely different cuisine.
My team took me here for their famous Rainbow cakes and we ended up having lunch here.
I think we had something called Red Velvet Cheesecake which Surprisingly my colleagues loved. Then we had Rainbow cakes which was really good. We had two different chicken dishes and two fish dishes, don't ask me the names because m very poor at that. But everything was delicious. I, myself, was shocked that I was actually enjoying the continental food.
Ofcourse I missed my usual partner whom I share my food with.

The ambiance of the place is quite good and the nice background music goes perfectly well with the marvelous delicacies of the Paris Cafe. Situated in Salt Lake, Sector 5, the outlet can be one of the favorite destinations for the true lovers of foods. 

Hopping into the place with a dear one actually came fruitful due to their quality food. We decided to order Green salad with chicken, popcorn chicken, roasted chicken with mustard sauce & spiced rice. Among all these dishes, I must mention the roasted chicken for its tenderness. All in all this is quite a cool place for you to spend some quality time with your dear ones.

A well decorated place. Following the french Cafe storm that has engulfed the city. Not sure if Kolkata will look like London or not but Certainly the food department has taken a french route. Paris Cafe lives up to it's hype. Offering great food and desserts. Nice Presentation and great ambiance. Though it is a bit difficult to find(location wise the Sector 5 branch). A great place for brunch and also for coffee. Also if you are looking some alone time or going through a rough breakup. This is the place to be.

My Order

Mushroom Crepe 

Nutella Crepe 

Cappuccino

Macaroons 

Rainbow Cake 

Heart filled cake

For me Paris cafe is a perfect date place. :) it's like eating in Paris without a passport. I and my friend decided to celebrate our 1 year of togetherness here and to our surprise from staff to the pastry everyone cooperated and made it special. Staff got us a beautiful rainbow pastry writing "happy one year" on the plate, a candle to blow and two fancy mocktails which brought my taste buds back to life. :)

Such a cute,  petite place located in a rather peaceful neighborhood. I chanced upon having a Sunday breakfast at this beautiful cafe. The interiors are done the medieval european way,  with wooden chairs and tables painted white,  hanging chandeliers,  open cages decorated with fairy light. An ideal date place perhaps. A cafe run by just 12 people preparing food in such a small kitchen is praiseworthy in itself. The hard work of the staff is literally visible. The menu is typically that of a cafe serving Italian / French food. We ordered a mushroom quesadilla,  chicken penne in arabiatta pasta,  chicken pizza,  a snicker shake and a oreo nutella cheesecake. To put it shortly,  the food tasted simply amazing. Surprisingly,  this small space is able to dish out much better taste,  compared to several 'legendary' places in Kolkata. Each of the items mentioned above were delicious in their own way. Only the pizza lost out a bit. The pizza base was too hard. The cheesecake was simply amazing. I wonder if there are any more places offering that quality in Kolkata. We got s bill of rs. 1200 approx,  which is quite decently priced for the food that this Cafe offers. I would highly recommend this place to anyone searching for a beautiful Italian experience. Kudos to the staff again!  Would surely love to visit again.

Not very happy . We ordered the stuffed chicken and lasagna.. . The lasagna was still edible however the stuffed chicken was cold and dry ! It was bland .. service was not very good either! The price of the food doesn't match the quality and service provided .. the only good thing about the cafe is it's ambience !

A little gem in the middle of busy sector 5, it caters to a pallette for yummy continental fare and scrumptious desserts. I have been here twice and ordered the roasted chicken steak, chicken stroganoff, chicken wings, green mango mojito and cappuccino. No complains. The food is yummy with authentic flavours. Beautifully presented as well. The portions are large and the prices reasonable. As for the desserts, they are always diminishing faster than you would want. I have so far had the red velvet cheese cake, lemon tart and choco Oreo cheese cake. I would love to try the rainbow cake and chocolate eclair which are highly recommended. The only drawback is its a small place with limited capacity and no washroom. However, if you are looking for a cafe feel and good food, this is the right place for you.

Had been there last week evening for a quick bite. We had ordered 1 spicy chicken wrap and 1 chicken and mushroom crepe. Both tasted excellent. Service was cordial and prompt as well. The food was quite filling and did not burn a hole in my pocket. 
However, they were having issues with regard to card acceptance that day. I was carrying minimum cash and my sodexo vouchers saved me. It is better if management communicated this early.

We were there for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place is bright and done up nicely. We went with a 3 year old pancake lover and she was served pancakes (described as fluffy pancakes in the menu) that were made a day before. Slightly disappointed with the fact that the pancakes were not fresh and as a result a bit dense. We also ordered a Panini which was very good and a grilled sandwich which was average. Both were served with fries that were decent too. Overall was a nice experience. Would have been a 4.5 if the pancakes were freshly made in a place that claims to be a cafe offering breakfast and expecting to be rated for the confectionery it is. I will go to this place again but never order the "fluffy pancakes"!

Indoor seating yet completely open. Call one ENTIRE side a life-sized window. (Sounds better than a glass wall) :)

The cafe has a ¬†baroque, old and rusted feel. The ceiling is adorned with chandelier(s), open bird cages (stringed with golden lights). The walls have baroque style frames ¬†on them. The furniture and the cushions have an old look to it. Beauty.

In a couple of my visits, had ordered for-

Fluffy Pancakes
Spinach and Corn Crepe
Pizza Sticks
Pesto Pasta
Cheese Sauce Pasta
Red Velvet Cupcake
Red Velvet Cake (Take Away)
Rainbow Cake (Take Away)
Cold Coffee

-My first visit to the cafe was sad. The cold coffee was NOT cold coffee. Had to get it changed like 3 times (not even exaggerating.) The fourth one tasted like peas. Forced it down.

-The pizza sticks were super dry. Didn't think I would have visited again.¬†

-Second visit on wards, things were better. Cold Coffee got better. Didn't try the Pizza Sticks again though. The Pancakes, the Crepe, Pasta, Cupcakes and the Cakes were nice.

-Visited today as well. Noticed the Cupcake had shrunk. Not as big as it used to.

-The saddest part is, on asking them twice on two consecutive days for a tea spoon of extra butter, they'd want us to pay extra. I don't get it if this is fair or unfair.

Anyways.

Paris Caf√© can be described as one of the more quaint places in the City of Joy. The ambience is pretty great and they have some nice melodies playing to regale you and your companion as you enjoy your food. 
We had the American breakfast, a Funghi (Mushroom & Mozzarella pizza), a Mushroom quesadilla and a Brownie shake to wash it down. The American breakfast and the pizza were really good but the quesadilla failed to impress. The quantity of the food they provide is astronomically lower than the prices they charge, but for the certain items on the menu, the taste equals the price charged. 
Another thing to point out was that the servers were a bit unprofessional. Case in point was that they had mistakenly charged me less for an item and me being a good Samaritan pointed it out. They rectified the bill and while they were doing so, in jest, I quizzed them on the possibility of a discount etc for I had just extinguished the possibility that the server would have to make up the difference in the bill. The second I uttered these words, the staff kinda clammed up and in my opinion, became a bit rude. So, the only thing based on which I changed the rating of this caf√© from a 3.5/4 to a 3 was how the staff behaved. Not blowing my own trumpet, but I just saved the restaurant a cool 300 bucks. Would definitely not consider going here again and even if I do, it would just be for the pizza and the American breakfast..

Went to this place on a gloomy, rainy day when my mood was also not in the usual cheerful mode. I wanted to spend some cozy, quiet time with good food and my boyfriend. My choice could not be any better.
The ambiance and interior will surely remind you of the cafes in Paris (that you often see in teh pictures and dream of going in one of them someday). I actually loved the cute tables and chairs a lot.¬†
The waiters are friendly and courteous. The service is a little slow, but I think taht suits teh mood of this place and allows you to spend ¬†few extra minutes with your loved ones.
We ordered the green salad with chicken first. This is the perefct comfort food that you crave for often. The taste is simple yet there is something that you will just love about it.¬†
Next we ordered a chicken lasagna with a a garlic bread. The lasagna was nothing extraordinary, but was not bad either. The garlic bread was good.
The best thing came at last and it was teh rainbow cake. I had one portion and the colours made me soooo happy that I simply can't explain. There was something so good about it. I clicked a picture and when my friends from other cities saw the picture they all decided to visit this place for the cake when they come to Kolkata.¬†
I will go back again and spend some quality time in this cute joint. :)

A little glimpse of Paris in the busiest sector of Kolkata is this little, petite and pretty cafe enveloped in clear glass windows.
Designed with a fairytale theme this cafe is all about sweet smell of food and lovely looking food and desserts around. One can spot it near College
Moore TCS on the ground floor of South City Pinnacle building.

Scattered with small round tables and mildly lit, this cafe is the cosy place where you will love spending time with your near friends or family.
A friend and I landed here sometime back and instantly fell in love with the ambience. Our love multiplied with the munchies we had.

We ordered for Chicken Nuggets, Kitkat Shake and Watermelon Shake. The Chicken Nuggets were served with a lightly spiced ketchup and were crispy. The KitKat shake was all chocolatey and filled with smooth and light white cream. The Watermelon Shake was was almost similar to the taste of a smoothie, thick and was a blast of natural flavour. The first sip into both of the shakes felt like heaven.

The staffs are here are really friendly and quick at delivering service. You are served on the table except for the cakes and pastries for which one has to cater to self help.
One thing to be mentioned is that you can spend as much time you want, there is no hurry from the staffs.

It is recommended to be visited with near ones and for better experiences visit during the holidays at evenings.

We went for breakfast on this rainy "Shasti" morning. The decor is very pleasant. at that point of time there were only few people there other than us, Ordered AMERICAN BREAKFAST, PANCO FRIED CHICKEN BURGER and ¬†their famous RED VELVET Pancake.The american breakfast consist of 2 chicken sausages, you can choose the type of omlete, along with tomate beans.It was appropriate in taste as well as quantity. I loved the chicken burger which was served along with french fried. The winner of the show was the red velvel cupcakes. If u visit Paris cafe u must give it a try if its available . We were lucky that it was available . The cupcakes were fluffy and perfectly sweet. We paid approx 750 for all these

Situated in the ground floor of south city pinnacle building,college more this is one of the very few cafes in sector 5. The ambience is perfect for a cheesy conversation or an quick refreshing break from work. They serve a wide range of pastas spaghetti salads muffins coffees u name it. But the service is not prompt, u need to wait for a good 10 -15 mins before you can attract the attention of any waiting staff. Also their signature garlic fresh fries were almost soggy and soaked in oil. Nevertheless the spaghetti n drinks we ordered was amazing.  To sum it up ... it's a nice place but nothing over the top.

I made the biggest mistake of my life driving 17km to go to this place. 
After seeing such amazing pictures and good reviews I thought that it would be good but by God was I wrong ! The food was horrible. I ordered red velvet pancakes which literally tasted like ready-made pancake mix and red food coloring. The brownie milkshake was terrible. The brownie tasted like those cheap brownies you get in new market. 
The red velvet cake was basically a very wet sponge cake with a lot of dark red food coloring and the "cream cheese" frosting was a horrible gelatin based butter cream which was also horrible. 
The mojitos I ordered were literally the worst virgin mojitos I've ever tasted in my life. The mint in the leaves looked like seaweed and tasted horrible 
Finally the macaroons. Have you ever wanted to taste a Sandesh flavored macaroon ? Cause this is actually the place to do so. 
I was very very very disappointed in the food and will never ever go back again.

A little bit of Paris for Spicy Kolkatans. 
A rather larger outlet with ample seating space. From finger food to breakfast to desserts, this place has it all for someone. The staff is courteous.
The food is very very good. I'm giving it a low rating because we weren't happy with the non veg items in the menu. For instance, we had grilled chicken steak and roasted mustard chicken. They were cometely bland and lacked taste. Please avoid if not absolutely necessary. 
For the veg and eggitarian menu, the food is amazingly good. Jacket potatoes, assorted veg soup, cheese garlic bread, lasagna were just over the top. The masala and cheese omelettes melted in the mouth. The dessert section is their speciality. We tried the chocolate nutella crepe. It was oozing chocolate from all angles. Lovely taste. 
Drinks for the evening was mojito amd cold coffee. Both tasted just the way they should. 
Overall a great experience. Nothing to crib about except the chicken thing.

So first when I walked into this place, I saw a decently made cafe with their signature cushions placed on chairs. Mr. Alam warmly greeted us and helped us place the order for a hot caramel chocolate, veg panini and mojito. Let me begin with the mojito and make it clich√© to call it refreshing and if I ever go around this place, I will go back simply to have the same mojito again! The hot chocolate was a delight, with Mr Alam advising me not to add sugar, and was I surprised! The attraction for me was the indulgence of caramel right towards the end of my drink :) The veg panini was ordered because I was a tad bit hungry and mixing this food item with my hot chocolate was a very good deal. 4 stars from my end!

I had wanted to visit Paris Cafe for quite some time now, finally had an opportunity yesterday. We went there for breakfast and were probably their 2nd customers of the day.
We ordered Caramel Frappe and Brownie shake along with burgers, both veg and non-veg. The shakes were good but not very large, the quantity could have been a bit bigger. The burgers were delicious and even though i am a non-vegetarian, i liked the veg one better. The burgers were very filling leaving just enough space for a little bit of dessert.
We had ordered a Red-Velvet Cheesecake which was HUGE! And it tasted heavenly. The ambience was very peaceful, there are glass windows everywhere and trees outside, the interiors give a feel-good experience. And to top it off, there is 80s pop music in the background. Will revisit this place for sure!

Dissatisfied with the so called prawn cocktail, which was only filled with lettuce, cabbages & carrots only. Have had prawn cocktail from your cafe before but food quality has highly degraded. Kindly look into this and try to serve people better.

Located in South City Pinnacle building near college more in sec v. This outlet is supposed to give a beautiful look and ambience ....however it fails to impress. It's not Designed well and many areas are just wasted. The open kitchen is just to say as the divider is opaque. 

Coming to the food
Masala  omelette: tasty
Garlic cheese bread: cheesy n yummy
Cafe mocha: perfect
Mushroom scrambled egg: nice
Irish coffee: good again
Red velvet pancake: wow.

So food was wow. Points deducted for ambience and for getting dead mosquitoes on our table.  Pic attached.

Went with my school friends for a catchup of sorts. We went with the mindset of just sitting with a coffee or shake. However, we ended up eating and trying new things. Everything we ordered was good. The vanilla peppermint tea tops the chart! If you're a green tea lover, it should be a must try for you. It refreshes your mood so much! For drinks, we also ordered cappuccino, mohito and oreo shake. Whole cappuccino and mohito were nice, we didn't quite like the oreo shake (I'm an oreo shake lover so maybe I have my standards set very high) . As all of us were vegetarians for food, we ordered a veg panini sandwich, a veg pizza and salad. All three were good, while we specially liked the sandwich. The staff said that the place had more and better non-vegetarian food. If the average vegetarian was so good, I can only wonder how good non-vegetarian food would be.

Brilliant pizzas and one of the best lasagnes you will find in the city.
The ambience is wonderful and a great place to hang out as well. 
The seating capacity is quite spacious and the prices are also quite reasonable.
Corporate discount was an additional benefit though.
Will definitely visit again for the wonderful pastries and try out some other dishes as well.

Paris talks about food. So does this cafe. Well prepared dishes. But one point i would like to mention the day i visited, the staff were cleaning with dirty water flowing everywhere when customers are sitting. Get some common sense and etiquettes please. The dessert i liked was the rainbow cake and the red velvet cheese cake. But needs to improve a lot, so many good joints around.

Horrible service. So I wanted to eat a red velvet cake at Paris cafe and what I got was extremely disappointing. It was Half red and half brown in color and the manager accepted that it can be over-baked but then refused to replace it. They had the audacity to say that if you had one bite out of it, you obviously like it. Paris cafe has no quality check and the staff lacks manners.

A beautiful little cafe situated in the busy streets of the IT sector in Kolkata. It is the perfect place for a bite after a tiring day. The decor is very pretty and has a feel of the small persian cafes. The taste of the food is very delicious .. The rainbow cake need to have a special mention. It is extremely soft and is very attractive to the eye though the price is is a tad bit costly. The waiters are extremely polite and helpful. It is a must visit for people who have sweet tooth :)

You can go for breakfast as well as lunch. Rainbow cake is one the hot cake item! Also in the list of serving one of the best hot chocolate in the town.

Paris cafe is a delight for people who love European food that is not too spicy. They have a wonderful variety of food, mocktails and desserts. There are a number of dishes that I tried. The pouliat pulet is a chicken dish served with mashed potatoes, peas and mayonnaise - it tasted awesome. Another great dish was fish florentine- bhetki fish with a lot of cheese. Chicken strongoff is basically chicken pasta and one of the average dishes. I tasted a chocolate pastry for dessert and that was also pretty good. Highly recommended!

A very cute, cozy and quaint little place tucked into the Concrete jungle that Sector 5 is. Quite perfect for lunch or even a quick Pick-me Up after a rough day at work!
The desserts from this place would definitely make you forget your diet! The Red velvet cheesecake, hazelnut truffle slice, rainbow cake, chocolate eclairs, blackforest slice... I could go on and on.. 
The macaroons are a bit of a disappointment but they have so much more to keep you happy!
While the dessert here are the main star, the main courses are pretty great too!
Highly recommend the Chicken Cheese Wrap! It is so so good! Also, the chicken steak and the chicken tetrazini is pretty great. If you're having breakfast, do not miss their amazing cheese omelette. The chocolate shake and the Ice tea will leave you happy!
The prices are on the higher side which is their only drawback. Still, a pretty great place to visit at the beginning of the month! :p

Situated in the bustling epicenter of sector five, Paris Cafe is a little difficult to spot.Its situated at the South City pinnacle near the PWC building.I had gone to sector 5 for some work so decided to drop by here with my friend for some late breakfast.
Coming to the outlet it's a small one but beautifully decorated.The best seats are the ones by the glass window.It was nearly empty when we arrived so we took the window seats.The seats have small cushions in them to make you comfortable.Coming to the food we ordered a tuna sandwich and chicken mushroom wrap.My friend wanted desserts but there wasn't much available so we left that out.
Coming to the food,the portions are enough for one person only.Both the wrap and sandwich was served with fries.The tuna sandwich tasted delicious,had the right blend of mayonnaise and was properly grilled.
The wrap too tasted good and was filled with mushrooms and chicken.Overall we found it very delicious.
The pocket pinch was 410 which I felt was a little high but nevertheless when it's good food who would mind spending money.Hoping to drop by soon on my next visit to sector 5.

What not these guys offer? Good food, great music, beautiful ambiance everything! And believe me you would be addicted to this place and crave for more visits. Long glass walls with sunlight catching in during day and the amazing decor inside can even light up your evenings. We ordered
MUSTARD CHICKEN ROAST- perfectly roasted chicken as the name suggest flavoured with mustard sauce served with spiced rice . Amazing .
FRENCH TOAST WITH HONEY- this is wat real french toasts taste like. Wow! Delicious. Dip them in honey and taste ecstasy.
KITKAT SHAKE- it won my heart. Made with crushed chocolate and fresh cream floating on top, this simply blew my mind.

COLD COFFEE- good as well
RED VELVET CHEESE CAKE- lovely piece of beauty. Perfect to end your date with. A bit more sweet but perfectly baked. You can go for the red velvet butter cake if you want the sweetness not that strong.
You can somewhat feel that American aura in their food and ambiance. The staffs approached everytime with a smile. An wonderfully spent evening with them. Drop in for that unique experience.

Those who have a weakness for dessert like me this place is ideal for them . They offer the most delicious macaroons and rainbow cakes in the town . The test and the quality of the food is very impressive. The price is a bit high but it's totally worth it.

Oh my Paris Cafe !! You just blew my mind . After keeping this small hidden gem in the bookmark for months i finally gave up my resistance and visited this place . And it was one of the best decisions i have made over food in my recent times . Often burdened my mixed reviews this place otherwise have garnered a lot of attention . And rightly so, inspite of having so many restaurants serving good continental food if you still manage to serve a while hearted meal to your customers you are bound to receive goodwill from them and I have all but good things to say about my experience in Paris Cafe .

¬∞ Location :- It's rather tricky yet simple enough . You have to reach college more in salt lake sector 5 . Now , you have to identify the lane which is located after the main lane of college more . That is, the main lane is the one which ends at Godrej waterfront . You have to take the next lane , the one which has an IEM board and then walk straight . To your right , you will find the South City pinnacle building and that's where the restaurant is located .

2. Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Located inside the South city pinnacle building ground floor , you will find this beautifully decorated cafe fully covered by glass . It is a beautiful place to be with the golden chandeliers on the top . It is a treat for the eye and I am sure it will be a lovely experience if you are with your loved one . The staff here is attentive . Service time is about 20 minutes which is okay considering the quality of the food they served . 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
¬∞ Food :- The alma matter and the heart and soul of every restaurant . Contrary to the name it is a dissapointing fact the restaurant does not serve authentic French food . Rather it provides a variety of items including pizza and pasta which is rather surprisingly considering the name . But the secret to every good restaurant or cafe is to make the food tasty and good in quantity in no.matter what they serve and that's where Paris Cafe is a hit . And also we choose the right dishes , that was also a plus . The choice of starters is not very good here so we choose the following items :- 

1. Chicken Tetrazzini ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Absolutely finger licking stuff . Although this dish is almost confused to be an Italian delicacy this is an American dish comprising of diced chicken flavored by a white creamy sauce of parmesan cheese . Trust me , this is one of the heartiest dishes i have ever had. Here the chicken and the white parmesan sauce is accompanied by spaghetti and veggies . There were enough chicken pieces in it and together with the white sauce and veggies it felt like a dream . Every spoonful of the dish felt like cheesy ecstasy . The veggies mainly comprised of mushroom , broccoli , corns . It was an amazing experience and we loved each and every bit of it . Yes, this is a highly recommended dish here and you will love it for sure .

2. Roast mustard chicken ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Very much a crowd favorite . This dish has won a lot of hearts and rightly so . This is 2 really big pieces of roasted chicken ( 1 breast + 1 leg ) cooked in mustard sauce and served with spiced rice.  The spiced rice is similar to Mexican rice which was really really tasty.  The chicken pieces were really huge , soft and tender . Although didnot feel much like the mustard sauce the chicken was covered with what seemed to be like the BBQ sauce . Nevertheless it was really yummy and we loved every bit of it . The combination of chicken in BBQ sauce and the spicy rice was a hit . Also a much recommended dish .

3. Red velvet cheese cake ( 5 / 5 ) :- ohh la la . Still can't seem to get over this piece of delight . Costs 160 , but the size of the cake was really big for 2 people . Won't be able to describe this pastry fully because we were literally gorging over it.  The white portion of the cake tasted like sweet butter . Trust me this is something you will not want to miss . Just go to Paris Cafe and order this to have a truly wonderful experience .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only 3 dishes were enough to blow us over . Yes, we carefully choose this dishes over others after reading a lot of other reviews and that's what worked for us but very frankly all the 3 items were out of this world . That accompanied by the beautiful ambience did wonders to our experience.  Due to its unpopular location it is still not attracting the number of people it should . Probably a place near RDB would have done it good but that's really not an excuse if you are looking for a hearty meal . 


Following are certain points to take away :- 

1. Beautiful ambience . Its basically a glass cafe decorated beautifully.

2. Good hearty meal . Especially the items mentioned above . Preferrebly the poultry items are more popular .

3. Sensational deserts namely the red velvet cheese cake, the rainbow cake the macaroons .

4. They provide corporate discount of 10‚ÑÖ , so don't forget to bring ur id .


Do visit Paris Cafe with your dear one for a once upon a lifetime experience.  I had a good one today and it made my day . I was filled with satisfaction , happy memories and a fulfilled appetite  .

Out of all this red velvet cake and chicken wings were outstanding . I didnt found the main course mustarded chicken and vaked fish much impressive . Other items were good . Overall good experience .

This place is charming. The d√©cor, the food, the hospitality - it was an absolute delight. We ordered Grilled Chicken Flat Bread Pizza, Chicken Stroganoff, Roast Mustard Chicken with rice, Virgin Mojito, Caramel Frappe; and for dessert we had a slice of Red Velvet Cheese Cake and Lemon Tart.
The pizza was awesome with crisp flat bread and perfectly baked chicken and veggies in cheese. The Chicken Stroganoff was a tiny little let down - I felt the spaghetti needed to be softer and the chicken was a bit bland for my taste buds. The Roast Mustard Chicken was soft and juicy and the rice was perfect to go with the flavour. What stole my heart was the cheesecake. I am attaching a photo of the same. Not only was it downright delicious, it looked so pretty it broke my heart to cut through the piece of art. The lemon tart was good too, but I have had better tarts. The Mojito was refreshing but the caramel Frappe was less sweet for me. However, the meal on the whole was super. A perfect little hangout for people at sector V. Must pay a visit. I will be going back for the awesome pizza again!
Pocket Pinch: we paid just around Rs.1500 after corporate discount for all that food! üòä

The best laid back cafe in and around sector 5. If there is any cafe where you can date around than this is the place to hit. Luxurious ambiance with comfy seating. Not all items are perfect for taste buds but their continental grilled items scores high. Deserts are also awesome but price is on higher side bit. And drinks are well crafted.

With a Parisian flair and elegance, its cane chairs, vintage furniture and a delectable sight of the glass jar of macarons tingled my senses. What makes it better is the staff. The staff is very warm and amicable. 
Ordered the soup of the day( non veg option) which was a simple cream of chicken soup. Simple and yummy! We followed it with Lemon Vermicelli Fish which was not so good. I personally do not like anything else overpowering the fish. We ordered Chicken Mushroom wrap and Cilantro Fish. The chicken mushroom wrap had a good balance of taste while I was craving for more sauce on my fish. I indulged in the Caramel Hot chocolate and it one of the best I have tasted in my life! 
On the whole it was a great experience and would love to go back with friends again, if not for anything but that abyss of Caramel Hot Chocolate!

Went to Paris Cafe on Friendship Day after looking at the ratings given by users on Zomato. Located in Sector 5 near the PWC building, this place has an amazing ambience and the decor will mesmerise you. Staff is also very polite.
Coming to food, we ordered a mixed sauce pasta (penne), garlic cheese bread, veg lovers pizza sans mushroom and chilli babycorn. While the pasta turned out to be a huge disappointment, the chilli babycorn tasted pretty good. Garlic cheese bread had negligible amount of cheese in it. Veg lovers pizza was the attraction of the day. The thin crust coupled with the toppings makes it a highly recommended dish. An extra 0.5 goes to that dish alone.
We also ordered a virgin mojito and a KitKat shake. KitKat shake was delicious. Virgin mojito was one of the worst mojitos I've ever had.
In desserts, we ordered a rainbow cake and red velvet cake. Rainbow cake looked pretty but was too creamy for us. 5 people together were not able to devour a single slice of that cake. Red velvet cheesecake was better than rainbow cake and is recommended.

Hear Ye! Hear Ye!

I walked into this quaint outlet nested in the ground floor of the South City Pinnacle located in sector 5. Had ordered for the Mushroom Omlette, now take my word for it this place makes a mean omlette. The eggs were done to perfection, soft, buttery and flavorful.

The decor however, I did not like, the tattered upholstery in the chairs, the peeled paint on the service station was probably taken a little too far.

Next in line was the Grilled Chicken Steak, Hello!!! this was the best piece of grilled chicken breast in town. Tender, Juicy and Flavorful. I loved it. 

However, the La Salade Saint Germain avec Poulet was a disaster. Lets face it our palate is not ready for an olive overdose. This salad was an absolute nightmare, the olive overpowered everything and left a horrible metallic after taste.

Redemption came by the way of the Red Velvet Cheesecake in terms of taste, the portion was overwhelming and to be honest was a tad too much. Good food also commands proper portioning, the cream cheese centre was too heavy and dense. It kinda tasted like a mix of Philadelphia cream Cheese and Buttercream, not really an appetizing mix.

Over all, I walked away with a wonderful memory of a wonderful omelette, the rest was mediocre at its best.

A nice lil bistro to stop by and enjoy a meal. They have a good menu. Ambience is good but definitely nothing paris like but its a cute little place with antique decor. The chandeliers, mirrors the round tables. You can say it resembles european cafes a little but cannot be compared to grandeaur of paris specifically. 

Staffs are polite and courteous and prompt and price is little steep.

We ordered- prawn cocktail which was a disaster. They need to reconsider their taste and making for sure or visit mocambo. Total flop!

Next for mains we had chicken steak which i relished  and was tasty although i wish the chicken breast was a bit more juicy and soft. The mashed potatoes was not upto mark at all as it lacked cream and butter. 

The mustard chicken roast with spiced rice was definitely perfect and yum. The gravy was good and the chicken were very well done. The rice was bit spicy but yum and the whole dish complemented each other. 

For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake- their signature dish which was good but too heavy. If you have it alone you can finish it but after mains this dish felt like a pile on. Moreover the cheese was a bit too much for my liking and we actually couldnt finish it. I wish the cheesecake was as per the normal cream cheesecake with biscuit base. Would have killed it then. 

I also took their thin crust grilled chicken pizza as a parcel and it was lovely and super delicious. Had it for dinner and wanted another plate. Yum!! But i hope they get pizza boxes to parcel and not aluminum foils box.

The I.T. sector in Kolkata is so busy that people barely get time to see an actual Rainbow. But thanks to this cafe those unlucky people can get to taste on actually. The name of the cafe is Paris Cafe situated in the alley of College More, Salt Lake, Sector ‚Äì V, Kolkata. This place is actually a center of relief and flavors. They have 3 more branches in other parts of Kolkata like Ballygunj. They serve continental, french, english and some chinese delicacies. They also bake great cakes and pastries. When I went there, I was amazed to see the interior decor, which was french styled with large chandeliers, antique salt cellars, beautiful mirrors, cute chairs, heart shaped spoons and cushions. I had ordered rainbow cake slice, pancake, grilled chicken steak, strawberry shake, green mango mojito and watermelon crush. I shall discuss about each of them with utmost clarity.
                                                                ...

The decor of this place was enough to impress me. The food was not far behind. I took a La Salad Saint German avec Poulet while my friend took the Chicken lasagne. Salads have hardly ever tasted this good. This one was a perfect combination of chicken and mushrooms with olives and pesto mayo dressing. The lasagne was surely a guilty pleasure. The sauces were delicious and the cheese beautifully baked.

They say "Paris is always a good idea"  I say " Paris cafe indeed is!" 
Decor: Very soothing,elegant,classy as paris should be ! Their chairs tables, soft cushions with 'bonjour' written on them.. A tiny portion of a wall with french antics-mirrors adds to the ambience! 
Service:  Very fast and quick ! Staffs are also warm ! 
Food: We ordered Caramel Cappuccino and Mocha ! They were absolutely brilliant as they should be ! I was little disappointed with 'Pesto Chicken Parmigano'  Firstly, the stuffed pesto chicken was too hard to chew and the Aglio-olio served with it was way too less....! So we ordered another round of just Aglio-olio with adds on in chicken !  Quantity was decent but there again the chicken....The chicken needs to be a little softer ! 
All things considered.... Paris cafe is a üëçüèª ! 
Definitely a hint of paris in kolkata !

This is one of the few caf√®s I really like because they not only pay attention to their drinks , but also food. I love sipping on their Irish coffee whilst reading a good book in this rainy weather. But I ordered ice tea today and the same old chocolate fudge cake. The ice tea was original , I'd say because it did not taste like nestle or Lipton like I have at other places. This means it was made from scratch and I really appreciated the taste. The chocolate fudge is my absolute favourite here. The cake is soft and light and the icing is rich and thick. It's the perfect combination. For the food we had the mozzarella sticks, the chicken tetrazzini and the tomato pesto and mozzarella sandwich. Now this is the best panini sandwich I've had in Kolkata and I like it more than a famous breakfast place here. The bread was soft and doughy , like it's supposed to be with a generous amount of pesto in it. The pesto was well seasoned and had the intense flavour of basil in it. I have always loved the combination of tomato and pesto and this place has it on its menu, so I couldn't be more excited to try it out. And thank goodness it was not disappointing. The chicken tetrazzini was typical in its flavour, the garlicky white sauce and spaghetti. What I really liked was the chicken pieces. They had been seasoned and pan fried from before which usually people don't do. It was well seasoned and the cooking was spot on. It was neither under nor  over cooked. 
Coming to the ambience, it has most of its walls as glass and provides a good place to be at while it's raining. The interiors are cute with a big macaroon tower and cakes at display. The yellow cozy lights in the evening really make you comfortable here. 
The staff is very friendly. The waiter who waited our table was very sweet and I noticed that the person next to ours was more fluent in Bengali, so the waiter decided to speak only in Bengali to them. This is a nice gesture and they have really looked into making their customers feel comfortable. So we were pretty generous in giving our tips ! 
It's a lovely place and the prettiest Paris caf√® outlet in Kolkata. As I keep coming here I will continue to do that and only hope I never get disappointed.

A beautiful and quaint joint in sector V... Beautiful decor, good food, very helpful and cheerful staff. We had forgotten our credit card there and they had carefully kept it with them and returned to us. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. Music is a bit old school but soft. Great ambiance.

This is such a nice, bright, simple and beautiful place that you'll love it the moment you enter.
Tucked in one of the less crowded lanes of sector 5, yet, easily accessible; it's a non-fussy place where you can sit and talk for hours. The ambiance and the decor is warm and eye-catching.
I'll give a 4/5 rating for the food - delicious and served beautifully too. Service is good.

The d√©cor of this glass walled eatery is quite impressive. I was similarly impressed with almost everything that I tried here, from the Macarons to the red velvet cake to the sandwiches. Overall this place does a good job of recreating the atmosphere of European Cafes. I would have given a higher rating if not for all those irritating flies acting as a constant reminder that I am in Kolkata and not Paris. This is totally unacceptable in a place of its class and the management should do something about it rather than plead helplessness. Also the service quality needs to improve. They seem to be having serious difficulties with their credit card terminal of late.

Went in with my team for a quick bite and must say, was quite satisfied with the service and the menu. We had ordered for Green Mango Mojito, Benaras, Fish Florentine, Chicken Tetrazzini, Fish and Chips and Chicken Fry and then a slice of rainbow cake for all. Food was served hot, portions were decent and taste was good. The place had a old world charm about it and I think there can be room for improvement when it comes to this! Overall decent and nice cosy corner in the heart of the financial hub!

We were a group of 9 toying with the idea of going to Flury's for a lazy Sunday breakfast. But the prospect of getting seating for 9 at Flury's on a Sunday morning egged us to look for nearby options (we live in Salt Lake). A search on Zomato yielded Paris Cafe in Sector 5. Parking in Sector 5 on a Sunday is a breeze which is a plus. We trooped in to Paris Cafe, each with their own preferences. The cafe has a sunny, open Parisian feel to it enhanced by the decor and images on the walls.¬† We ordered some America breakfast platters, eggs in different combinations, sandwiches, pancakes, french fries, tea and coffee. The food was freshly made. The waiters working overtime, given that they were under-staffed, were cheerful and prompt. Overall excellent food, service and experience. Already planning the next visit.

I realized I was doomed when my office became a neighbor to Paris Cafe. I had one of the best office time lunches with the cheeses, creamiest pasta and garlic bread along with chicken sausages and lemon tarts. Going back to work after that is a horror. The ambience of the cafe is such that rather than France I got transported to Enid blyton tea parties.

I have been to this outlet of Paris Cafe about thrice now as it's in the vicinity of my workplace! I have also been to their little ballygunje outlet once. The sector 5 outlet is much better in terms of space, ambience and food served! I have been more than satisfied with almost everything that I have tried here. Pasta, Chicken steak, crepes, sandwiches, coffee everything was very well prepared. Only the red velvet cake could not match up to the expectation given that it looks absolutely enticing! All in all I would recommend this place to one and all who enjoy Western cuisine and also has a sweet tooth :) Bon Appetit!

Finding your way: Road between Webel More and College More, leading towards TCS Lords. Building: South City Pinnacle, ground floor. Enter through the Entry gate, regardless of any ID card.
Furnishing: Nice and comfortable, antique era French Chairs with mini back cushions. Wooden tables, with seats for 3, 4. The only bother is that the corner tables are open to the roadside.
Bakery: Creative bit of pastries, influenced by the Red Velvette Cheesecake. Taste is balanced.
Food: The continental food is good here, well balanced taste and proportion. The chicken steak with mashed potato was nice and well hunted here. The cold coffee is one hell of a good one, one I have been looking for over many cafes'.
PS: Carry your own water or order for the Mineral water. You get the Kinley 500ml for Rs.20 or less anyway.
Staff behavior is good but a bit slow on their approach. Nice place if you have ample time on your watch.

Visited thrice to this place. The points that I  have given is purely based on the quality of their  food. If I had taken into account their ambience, the staff efficiency, the cleanliness and maintenance of furniture etc. then probably the ratings would go down.
So far we have tried chicken and mushroom crepe, fish florentine, baked fish, chicken tetrazzini and roasted chicken in mustard sauce. The food was always just spot on. Very tasty and reasonable quantity , little higher on the price range.

What's better than a triple egg chicken omlete and toast for breakfast with some coffee?  Well, I was recently there for breakfast and we ordered as said, a triple egg chicken omlete, masala omlete and a crepe. Omlete was pretty good, but what was really surprising was the crepe. It was something that was everything other than crepe. Staffs were polite. Service was a little slow.
Going back for the very famous rainbow pastry. :D

The food of every Paris caf√© is yum and tasty. Comparing it to that of the balleygunj outlet this one is little bigger but lacks that cute and fairy tale ambience which the latter has. The service is very good and the waiters were responsive and open with their suggestions. We ordered chicken mushroom crepe, red velvet pancakes and hazelnut frapechino. Enjoyed every dime of the fluffy pancakes with chocolate syrup, the frappechino lacked the flavor of hazelnut and it just felt like any other frappe. The crepe on the other than was cheesy and was stuffed with good amount of mushrooms though it was chicken-mushroom. I even took a rainbow cake and red velvet cake as parcel and traveled for more than 8hrs and was surprised to find that still it was fresh and had that peculiar softness and filled with moisture. Was a yummy date and will be looking forward for another one with Rashmi Menon

Located on the ground floor of the South City Pinnacle building , it is a decent place to hangout with your friends. One needs to take the lane beside the back gate of IEM to get here.
With minimalistic decor and nice music the place offers a good ambience. I went there with my friends and we ordered Cheese Balls, Veg Caesar salad and Veg Lasagna.
Cheese balls was the first dish to be served and also the best of the three. With a creamy filling and the spicy dip , it was delectable although it wasn't served hot.
Caesar salad was OK. Nothing to write much about.
Veg Lasagna was good. Perfectly cooked layers and lots of vegetables. It tasted all right but could have been better. The bread slice served with it was overbaked.
The service was quick but the staff isn't trained at all. We had to explicitly ask them to serve water and provide plates.
Yet to try their desserts. Hope that will be a good experience!

This place is over priced!
I went there with lot of expectations reading the reviews in zomato. But failed to understand why this place got this good ratings!
We ordered Prawn Cocktail, Thai Curry Chicken, Citron Corriender Fish and Fresh Mango Shake. Prawn cocktail was nice, but the chicken and fish dish can turn any happy mood to a bad one! Fish dish was recommended by the service person, but it was very salty. And the quantity of chicken dish was very very less. They served 4 spoon of rice with similar amount of veggies and 6-7 small chicken cubes at Rs 300! Mango shake was very good, but then my mom told me that she can make the same thing at home!
Ambience was good, but there were flies inside the restaurant. They have so much style, but are they hygenic too? Why the flies are there?
I may not visit this place again and may not recommend this place to any of my friends as I can get better continental dishes with this same price range in some other place in kolkata!

Hands down, one of my most preferred places to eat in the city. What more do you want when you order dishes that are lip smacking to say the least, desserts that can zone you out to a different dimension, and if you are lucky enough to work with PwC, a hefty discount on the bill? The Oriental Omelette with chicken and cheese is amazing. I had it in one of the earlier visits, along with the apple pie, and was mighty impressed. This time around, I had Chicken Stake. The pieces of chicken breasts were heavy, and were delightfully grilled. The barbecue sauce added to the taste, but what stood out about this dish, was the taste of the mashed potato. The best I have had in the world. The lasagna wasn't great. For those who are Lasagna fans, better go to Fire and Ice. However, the Red Velvet Cheesecake more than made up for it. I won't write how good they are, because I can't, as in, I don't have enough words in my limited vocab. But, you should try it. Thumbs up guys!! Will visit again.....and again.

I've wanted to try out Paris Cafe for a while now and finally got the chance yesterday and I was extremely happy with the decision. 
We were returning after a long day of shopping so we were hungry and short on time, so we decided to dive into the mains. 
We took: Chicken lasagna, fish florentine, mushroom and chicken crepe, and chicken stroganoff. 
Every dish was really good but the fish was extremely delicious. I recommend it to everyone. It was perfectly seasoned and was cheesey and yummy. 

The decor is also quite pretty, with birdcages hanging, but it's a really small cafe. The decor is cute and pretty.

In a nutshell, there is no other place I turn to when I want to feel happy and satiate my sweet tooth. :D 

Extremely surprised with the what they call American Breakfast. The beans on toast is almost addictive. You can keep munching on it. The sausages are the tastiest I've tasted in a while. 

The rainbow cake and the strawberry milkshake is why I keep coming back to this place over and over again. 

The ambience and service is just as good as their food! :)

In a sharp contrast to the hustle and bustle of the office area of Salt Lake, there is a gem of a restaurant aptly named the Paris Caf√©. It is located on the ground floor of the South City Pinnacle Building in Sector V, and is a beauty from the inside out. Indeed, the interiors of Paris Caf√© are as striking as they say, and you would certainly enjoy the charm and the warmth of the restaurant. From chandeliers, antique clocks, mirrors, pretty cushions, glass windows, to comfortable chairs ‚Äì the caf√© is designed to exude an aura of tranquil beauty.

I absolutely love the food here however if you happen to be a vegetarian you wouldn't get much options in this restaurant. For the meat lovers this place serves great pocket friendly food.
The desert is not their forte.

A perfect definition of a cafe.
Quiet and comfy, with a helpful staff.
Good ambience, with country music playing, although a little more range in the music would be preferred.
Ac wasn't working properly when we entered,
although things improved after a while.
The food was good.
Not excellent, but good.
Ordered an oreo shake, a veg club sandwich and red pancakes with chocolate sauce.
Oreo shake was meh,
Veg sandwich was above average but big in quantity.
The red pancakes were delicious, although the presentation was pretty meh.
Pricing was on the higher side.
But much better vfm than ccd,etc.

TLDR; above average in VEG food.
Good for desserts.
Excellent for a date.
Not very good if u just want to hangout with friends.

You tend to get a very nice feeling when you are at this place. The ambience is simple but very nice. Service is good and prompt as well. And the quality of food and coffee is just amazing. It is located in the heart of Sector 5 and hence the only thing that you will not like is probably the struggle for parking in the area. If you are a morning person (9ish) then you can visit this place for breakfast as well. And yes, do not forget to try the deserts! Yummy! Must Visit!

As soon as you enter this cafe, it actually feels like you have stepped into Paris. The decor was absolutely stunning with wonderful seating arrangements. Since I stay at Ultadanga, decided to visit the Sector 5 outlet ! What a tiring and confusing journey it was. The cafe is located at South City Pinnacle building, which to my surprise was not known to anybody not even the localites. We had to go round and round before we could actually locate it ! Coming to the food, it was a complete let down. We ordered Grilled Chicken crepe, grilled chicken and mushroom crepe, chicken lasagna, chicken Thai red curry. Apart from lasagna, the rest were really very small portions considering the amount they charge. The shakes were great though like Oreo shake, Choco shake, cold coffee, watermelon freezer and Green mango mojito. The mojito just stole the show, it was mind blowing! Another let down was the unavailability of red velvet cheesecake. The bill came up to a whopping 2298 which is the highest for any cafe I have been so far. I think if the rates are reduced, this branch will work wonders.
On the whole, though their staff was quite cheerful and hospitable, we were not satisfied. Thoroughly dissapointed, would not visit again.

Great food. Check. Wow ambience. Check. Good service. Check. What more can one ask for! There was not even a tiny morsel of food left on my plate. A good prawn cocktail, a great pasta arabiata, a delectable lasagna and a delicious red velvet pancake made my day. This is one of those places where you would want to go back again and again.

Ideal place for a refreshing date after a tiring office day.. Explored the place only a month ago,but already it has became one of my favorite places. Situated at a convenient location for Sector V techies their ambience,food,service all are just perfect as the menu.
We took: Kit kat shake,Oreo shake, Chicken Lasagna (The freshly prepared dish just blown my mind), Chocolate Nutella Crepe,Red Velvet Cheesecake.¬†
The last two items are their signature dishes. The pocket pinch is on the higher side but it's worth the money.
Will surely visit again soon.. :)

You cannot stick to diet even if you are a strict calorie watcher, specially after you take a bite or a spoonful.

Paris Cafe has its own distinctive charm. Located at near college more at Sec 5, this outlet was one of the first among three branch of them.

‚òÜDeco and Ambiance‚òÜ
The place was not huge or not too small, had a seating arrangements of 30 people.
I like their vintage and classic European style decoration.

‚òÜDrinks‚òÜ
‚óèI had my best strawberry shake today. Just fabulous.
‚óèHot chocolate was also great.

‚òÜFoods‚òÜ
‚óèChicken Tettrazini I had from there which was very good.. Served very hot.
‚óèAlso Mustard roasted chicken with spicy red rice was a great item. Two pcs of huge chicken made me crazy.

‚òÜCakes‚òÜ
After consumption of those previous items we ordered Rainbow pastry, great looks and taste.
Also their signature item that was red velvet cheesecake, a must try..
I had a very good experience.

Loved the ambiance. The red velvet cake was delicious. The all-day breakfast was pleasant. The chicken stuffed with olives not up to my taste. However, the mashed potatoes was creamy and savoury.
Bill was around 800.
Love this place.

Finally, its off the bucket list. I Have been wanting to visit this place since it first opened in sector 5 and I'm completely smitten over by its beautiful decor, ambience and amazing food, of course! 
Started of with green mango mohito, which was just the right amount of sweet and tangy besides the refreshing presentation.
Moving over to the main part of breakfast we ordered arabiata penne pasta and chicken steak.

The chicken steak was just too good compared to a lot other places across the city.
The pasta came in generous portion, with just the right amount of spices.
Ended with choco explosion came and red velvet. Highly recommended the desserts here. Truly orgasmic.

This was my 3rd or 4th visit to this outlet in Sector 5 and every time I go there everything is the same. The food there never compromises in its quality or quantity.We were 3 people and we had ordered a black forest pastry, a brownie shake,a chocolate shake,a watermelon freezer, a grilled chicken and vegan panini and a pasta. It was so difficult to decide which is the most delicious out of all the items we had ordered. Though watermelon freezer was a bit pricey, keeping in mind that it was just watermelon juice yet all the other stuff was worth it. Keep up the good work :)

It is very rare to find a restaurant as good as 'Paris Cafe'. With no hesitation I give it a 4.5. The food here is just amazing. With amazing pasta dishes and great starters, you just want to keep munching here.

We had tried a lot of food here. Those that particularly stood out were the spinach and ricotta cannelloni and the pesto sandwich.

 I don't have much expectations.  But they prove me wrong..

1. Tukka sandwich - chichken sandwich, well cooked, owsum taste
2. Prawn cocktail - terrific
3. Grilled chikchen steak- it's heavenly in taste

In drink we tried iced tea and mango mojito.. Pretty decent...

Yes, a pretty good experience.. Hope to visit again :)

Nice cute place to sit and sip tea and desserts. As I'm a tea lover, this is a ideal place for me as they many options for green tea. The pastries are one of the best in Kolkata. but food seems little over priced and all menu options seem very similar in taste ( cheese and garlic flavour). Although I agree its about the cuisine they have but probably they can bring in some varitey. Overall I would visit here again.

Very descent in terms of ambience and staff courtesy. However a lot needs to be improved in terms of what really matters : food. Tried the rainbow cake which is visual treat and tastes pretty good. We ordered grilled chicken and hmm in terms of taste a lot needs to be learned from mocambo and one step up. The chicken was very hard. The veggies were few though the mashed potato was well done. Overall it leaves big room for improvement

Alright after reading the previous review's about this place,i was adamant to come here 
Honesty it's NOT that great.
1. The toilet is a bit far from the cafe in the parking lot,that's okay but guys at least keep it clean. There's water leaking and damn! It's just messy.
2. Ordered Red velvet cheese cake- the heart shaped spoon along with it is better to look at than the taste of the cake.üç∞
The cake is just a preety sight. Blah!
3. Also had the chicken grilled steak. Well that's good. Thankfully.üçó
4. The staffs are curtious and polite. That's good.
Just improve the cake.. I also wanted to have the rainbow cake but sadly that was not available.

This restaurant in salt lake is so much better than the ballygaunge outlet. With glass walls, round tables and neatly stacked chairs with little printed cushions saying "bonjour", ornate mirrors and caged ceiling lights- it transports you to a quaint little caf√© on the streets of Paris. There is a huge counter displaying all kinds of delicious desserts and pastries. We helped ourselves to ouef crepes- a combination of egg wrapped chicken in a bed of mushroom sauce and cheese and also fish and chips. Green Mango Mojito and chicken pepites were also among others. The food, of course was excellent and we loved the ambience and the prompt service. Needless to say, the places deserves another visit.

There is a genuine reason for rating 2.5 star. Ambience gets a 4 star, but the food!!! 
Ordered a cup of Irish coffee, my throat was burnt due to the excessive sweetness in the coffee! Then ordered Greek salad with chicken (found 7 shredded piece of chicken and loads of greenery on the plate), la salad saint germain avec poulet (I had to type this while reading the menu on desktop!), I got ONLY a cup full of chicken, mushroom and olives, pesto sauce was quite good, but 170 for such small portion???
Moving on, I ordered grilled chicken steak, if you see the photo, you will understand the thin zuliens of bell papers they named as veggies. Baked fish was sunk in cheese where you can hardly get the aroma of the fish. Cheesy affair I say! 
I took a friend after reading all those amazing reviews, but it was a stupid idea to go that far from south Kolkata on a Saturday. Though we were the only two at that time, still I have to say, the food could have been prepared in a much better way.

I liked Green Mango Mojito, the other two Mojito and Watermelon freezer were quite ordinary. Next we ordered Chicken Tetrazinni and Fish Florentine and oh boy both the items were awesome. Portion was good too.  Last but not the least we oredered Paris Cafe signature Red Velvet Cheesecake. The super yum cheesecake once you take one bite you can't stop yourself craving for more. Lovely evening spent with some lovely foods. üòä

Amidst offices and bars lies this pretty outlet which looks spectacular from a distance due to its glass walls. The interior looks appealing with chandeliers and antique clocks. Coming to the food, it is a much widespread menu as compared to the tiny outlet in ballygunge. The rainbow cake, nutella waffles/ pancakes seem quite popular. Food is made right after you order so yep it's fresh. I had the Oreo shake and a chicken lasagna there. Both were upto the mark. It's open till 9 :( wish it could stay open a little longer so that people could enjoy a late dinner post a hectic day.

Food: we had ordered creme cheese, mushroom and mozzarella panini, fish & chips, rainbow pastry, and mojitos. The fish was perfectly cooked with the right amount of moisture in it. The panini was a let down. The crust was too dry and biscuity. It lacked the right amount of cheese. The mojitos were good and refreshing however it was tad bit on the sweeter side. The rainbow pastry, which is a speciality of this cafe, was par excellence. Not too overpoweringly sweet and very light and fluffy on the palette. All the seven flavours stood out perfectly. 3.5/5

Decor: the d√©cor is nothing over the top. However it is simple and classy with wooden furniture and antique mirrors and wall pieces. 4.5/5

Service: the staffs were decent and polite however when two people are ordering food, you can't just serve one of them and make the other one sit for 15 minutes. By the time the fish & chips was on the table, which my friend had ordered, my panini was cold. 3/5

Additional comments: lovely choice of music. I mean who wouldn't dive in a sinfully delicious dessert with 'Country Roads Take Me Home' with humming in the ears? 4/5

A nice cafe to spend your time with buddies or your loved ones. The price is on the higher side though.
Good ambience with decent decor and nothing over the top. Just beside the lane of IEM building in cllge more, if you walk straight, you ll locate this place.
The pastries in here are a huge attraction especially the red velvet cake and also the caramel pastry and rainbow cake.
However this time we opted for only appetizers and entree.
They have a huge spread of maincourse dishes.
We opted for the panco fried chicken burger,ouef crepes (with egg and mushroom chicken nd cheese) and crepes with nutella and chocolate as appetizers and fr the entree we had chicken tetrazinni, chicken lasagnia and fish florentine.
Chicken burger was okayish.served with french fries. The patty was dry and didnot taste very good. Was quite bland. Morever the patty hardly had any flavour of chicken..disappointing!!
The ouef crepe tasted good. Nice amount of mushroom nd chicken and a fried egg on top.
The nutella nd chocalate crepe was a star here! Delightfully presented. Tasted very good.
The fish florentine was a hit! Nice cheesy gooey sauce with spinach and fantastic portions of fish. The fish was really fresh and tasted superb!
The tetrazini was good too. It had a grilled chicken breast at the bottom which layered by sphagetti nd veggies in cheesy white sauce! Nothing spectacular but good!
Chicken lasagnia is again a bit of dissapointment. It was very rich. Lot of veggies and minced with baked cheese in between the pasta layers. However it was dripping of red sauce nd was oily. It was good nontheless but i have had better 1s bfr..
The quantity is decent.
Service is on the slower side. Disorganized sometimes. However really curteous waiters!
Must visit here at least once!
Total bill was 1901 for the six dishes mentioned..
..........
2nd visit.. ordered for cappucino, chicken lasagne, chicken strogannof, fungi pizza and pan crumb fried chicken.. 
Fungi pizza was a standout dish with ample mushroom, cheese and a bit of black olives.. pancrum fried chicken was a hit!! The other 2 chicken dishes were good too.. cappucino was made perfectly..
Really good place to hangout!!

I am a regular visitor at this outlet of Paris Cafe. I last went there on 13th April eve and was very disappointed with my favourite Red Velvet Cheesecake.¬†

While looking for desert options at their dispplay shelf, I could see one serving size portion of the cake kept on a plate and an entire new cake by its side. The single portion was small, much smaller that the average portion size. I asked them to give be a standard size piece from the new cake but they said the whole cake was sold and hence the only option is to take the last piece- the undersized cake piece. thought they did not agree it was undersized but I was even more sure after ordering it and while eating. It couldn't stand vertical and they served it size down,

Very disappointed. ¬†Not expected when they charge so high.

 Food, on the other hand, was good. I ordered some  chicken wings and strawberry milkshake.

Went to Paris cafe in sector 5 for the first time. It is way bigger than the ballygunj one. It's a quiet and a nice place to sit and enjoy long conversations with friends..

We ordered crepes and waffles.. And both tasted amazing.. However the brownies shake was not so great.

Overall the place would be recommended.

Visiting their ballygunge outlet was on my to-do list for quite a long time, so when it's saltlake counterpart opened up, my joy knew no bounds! It can be very easily located- walk straight past the passage right beside IEM and you would find it! The decor and seating arrangement is something i absolutely love, a beautiful high ceiling, cosy light shaded chairs with pillows, an open counter which reveals exactly as much as would rouse your curiosity! Coming to their food, i really found the food to be of my liking! Love their chicken steak with mashed potatoes and veggies! Absolutely heart all of their deserts- the rainbow cake, the red velvet cupcake, their lovely macaroons! I also have a special corner for their green mango mojito and i would prefer that above their oreo shake!
Overall i would return to this place again and again mainly for their heavenly desserts!

Checked in today for lunch with my friend. Both of us ordered the Grilled Chicken Steak, along with Watermelon Freeger. The drink was good and felt refreshing, owing to the sultry weather outside. As for the steak, it did turn out to be very very good, only that they did not have the mashed potato to go with it. So, its replacement was spaghetti, which didn't quite feel right.

The place is easy to locate though and is also spacious. The ambience is pretty good as well.

'Dirty' experience. Unkempt . Too many official papers posted on the glass panes. The food was good. 

The fellow gave me a key to the washroom when I came back finding it locked. Came back all the way through the parking lot  :(

Just didn't come here for the food, but for the ambience.

Awesome food experience otherwise.

Went for breakfast on good friday and wasn't disappointed at all.
We ordered red velvet pancakes and creamy mushroom waffles with hot chocolate. Everything was perfect.
Pros:
Beautiful ambience
Courteous and friendly staff
Prompt service
Food quality on point
Cons:
Expensive; it's a once in a while place rather than a regular joint unless ofcourse you can !

This place has really good interiors. Food is awesome. We ordered crepe, wraps, chicken wings, Irish coffee and assorted latte. Irish coffee was not that good but their assorted latte was really amazing. Good service. Their Rainbow cake is a must. Would love to visit again :)

It was a very nice experience. Loved the steak and chicken lasagne. We had a great time with the oreo milkshake and loved their colourful pastry cake.

Paris Cafe is a nice caf√© located in Sector 5, Salt Lake. The overall ambience is nice and so is the food. One thing that i really liked was their cutlery. It's pretty unique - in the shape of a heart.
I tried out various cupcakes like the red velvet cupcake and the christmas special cupcakes last year. I also love their macaroons and blueberry pie.
Hoping to try out their other outlet in Ballygunge sometime soon.
So visited this caf√© for the second time today. Tried out their grilled chicken cr√™pe, grilled chicken sandwich,spicy chicken wrap and batasia tea. The food was good and i especially loved the rainbow cake a.k.a dream come true. The pastry tastes as good as it looks. I wanted to try the red velvet pancakes but they were unavailable.
Also, i was disapointed by the flies constantly bugging me and to add to it the air conditioner was not working properly, that too in this hot weather. I hope the management takes note of these because people get distracted from the food otherwise.
P.S. I didn't reduce the rating only because of the food.
Tried their red velvet pancakes with chocolate sauce today. It really is yum.

Been meaning to come here for quite some time and finally on a good Friday afternoon (pun intended) I did. I have to say, J'aime Paris Caf√©.
The interior, as everyone keeps mentioning, really is very pretty. The staff members are friendly too and are more than willing to help. Thank you :)

We ordered champignon avec fromage a la cr√®me panini (basically mushroom panini) Chicken Thai red curry, grilled chicken steak, mojito and of course the much talked about red velvet and rainbow pastries.
Being an avid fan of mushroom (that sounds wrong), I loved the panini. The Thai curry was unexpectedly good (I've always found that curry tastes weird in continental restaurants). The chicken steak was much better than some others I have had. The mojito tasted a bit off though. 
And of course the pastries. Yes they are bit too creamy by the time you get to the end. But before that... They are HEAVEN.

Definitely gonna visit again :)

Edit: I recently ordered nutella crepe, prawn cocktail, red velvet pancakes (with chocolate sauce) and rose flavoured macaroon. The cocktail was a mixture of interesting flavours with boiled eggs, prawn and mayonnaise thrown in together. The red velvet pancakes were okay. The macaroon was okay-ish too but the crepe... I died went to heaven and stayed there for a while. It was drowned in nutella and it was stuffed with nutella and I have no regrets. Absolutely none. 
Edit: On my second visit we ordered the kit kat shake, pasta (w/ aglio oglio sauce) and spicy chicken wrap. The KitKat shake was amazing (why didn't I read about it before?) with the whipped cream and the bits of kit kat. The pasta was a bit spicy but was great too. The wrap was less spicy than the name suggests.

One of the friendliest Cafe in Kolkata . My first visit to this place .The staffs were very helpful and polite and the ambience was also good which gives a Paris feeling on good Friday.

Loved the food also specially the chicken soup, cheese cake, grilled chicken and the lemon baked fried fish.
I recommend this to everyone for one visit .

I had visited Paris cafe last evening... Had ordered for red velvet cheese cake and dream come true pastry slice. Both were stale.. Didn't taste like it was freshly baked. Very bad experience.im sure they sell stale cakes of the previous day which aren't sold. Kookie jar is far more better when it comes to taste and freshness. Will never visit this place again.

This quaint cafe is at the ground floor of our office building...so I have visited this place quite a few times. Food is tasty and not too spicy. I especially like their chicken stroganoff. I have also tasted their sandwich (which is yumm), their chicken steak (chicken is a bit stiff) nd their pasta (I like that they give a garlic bread piece with it). One must try their pancakes with maple syrup...it's heavenly! As for the pastries, I feel that those are a bit expensive nd one can get better quality at Rose (the price is almost half there)...

One of the most pleasing experience lies in the gourmet encouragements.... Especially if it is in a cafe decorated as your visualisations.....be it on plate or on the walls....stroganoff is a must try here...loved the lasagna and pasta...grilled chicken is delicious as ever..however lacking a decent dessert makes me feel a bit incomplete in all visits... A nice breezy evening to be well spent.... Paris cafe could be your destination...

On an afternoon we went there just to try out this outlet of paris cafe as I have been to the ballygaunge one before...  The place is spacious compared to the ballygaunge one,the decor is good with a bit of different elements for decorating the interiors they have used...we had chicken lasagne and chicken paprika and mojito... The lasagne was pretty good,a perfect blend with perfectly placed cheese layers and detailed aromas whereas chicken paprika was just fine in taste,eateable but not upto the mark...the mojito too was good with refreshing taste...overall very good...

This is a long overdue review! And it's a long review, so please be patient ;)

I was introduced to the Paris Cafe a couple of months ago by a friend and so far i have made a few trips to this place and have ordered food from here a couple of times.

Now, don't be fooled by the name! I expected this place to serve French Cuisine and maybe a bit of British thrown in... but it serves Italian and Mediterranean and American too! The Menu is huge! I go by one¬† thumb rule where Menu is concerned.. the smaller the better. Most places with limited menu serve amazing food. ¬†¬† 

Paris Cafe has good ambiance.. very apt and soothing, recently ruined by a lot of clothes and knick knacks kept in a corner to be sold. The staff is anything but friendly. They don't serve you water unless you ask for it and are mostly detached and snooty. But frankly, if the food is good these things don't matter? Right?

My Experience: Every time I visited my feelings for this place changed. I enjoyed the first time. I loved my Mushroom Crepe and that rainbow pastry. My son loved their cheese balls. I got a burger and a nutella crepe delivered next week, even that was tasty.. but with gradual trips i realized their food quality is not consistent. the same thing tasted different on my subsequent trip.. same goes to the food I got delivered.

I am washing my hands off this place.. unless there's no where else to go because:

1) on my last visit the place stank of stale fish cooking. YOU NEED BETTER VENTILATION OR A BETTER CHIMNEY/HOOD!!! I am a vegetarian and didn't particularly enjoy that smell! on my last trip I ordered Red Velvet pancakes and my son ordered his regular cheese balls. The cheese-balls had too much chili and my pancakes were okay.
2) The last order I got delivered from this place consisted of Red Velvet Pancakes and American Pancakes. The Red Velvet Pancakes tasted¬† entirely different from the time I ate them last.. too sweet and floury. American pancakes were obnoxious and smelled like Kerosene Oil!!!!

A word of advise to the management: I know you guys like to keep your cafe fashionably unkempt.. but that is not an excuse to keep it smelling foul. Keep the food quality consistent and good.

Paris cafe is a quaint charming outlet tucked away in sector five salt lake. The sprawling establishment, @ south city pinnacle- boasts of a light soothing charm, complimented by its subtle cuisine. 

From the books stacked on the table to the mirrored chandelier interior, the slightly used look of the chairs and the scrubbed table with faintly etched paintings- all speak of a lulling charm in the midst of a bustling tech district in the city! 

I sampled the panini with tomatoes, basil pesto and mozzarella. Full of flavor the sandwiches were just crunchy enough and the cheese stringy.... Next came the crepes, stuffed with mushroom and chicken- served with a creamy white sauce offset by a tangy zingy mustard and the sprig of fresh green herb - melts in your mouth, light, fresh and totally worth it! 

The chicken roast steak with creamy mash potatoes in mains checks all the boxes of flavor, texture and amount of food. 

With my taste buds on full symphony, the final verse of delicious gooey hazelnut chocolate nutella wrapped in a perfect thin crepe and served with a small swirl of fresh cream na thinly sliced apples- brought a perfectly tuned end to this almost lyrical food quest! 

The staff is polite and our food was served on time... Hope they keep this up! 

I look forward to a foray into this slice of paris soon!!!

On a rainy February morning, we dropped into  Paris Cafe, sector V & we were more than happy with the experience. Lovely decor & delicious breakfast. The mushroom crepes are simply to die for. One could also try their wholesome American breakfast platter. The staff members too are very amiable. All in all, a    wonderful experience.

American chef Julian Child had once said about style of cooking: "In France, cooking is a serious art form and a national sport"
Holds true for Paris Cafe.. It has stunning Victorian art deco, mirrors, iron wrought furnitures and artefacts that take you to Paris.. So lets get started:
Pariah as they say is known for boulangerie pattiserie, crepes, salads and has perfect balance of flavors! So here i was at this cafe and ordered:
Red Velvet Cake: The best pastry ive had till date and that heart shaped cream cheese right in the centre.. Makes one crave for it all the more!
Rainbow Cake: This pastry looks soo colourful that one is tempted to have it that very instant.. But its too creamy.. Cream fans must have it..
I wanted to try mushrooms and spaghetti as my buddy told me to try it.. But i couldnt as i had time crunch and had to cover lot of food joints..;) 
Lastly, the staff are very well behaved.. Wear their smiles.. The pocket pinch is normal.. Its Apt.. Wish to visit this place once again and try other things on the menu.. Please keep me updated on this joint and leme know whats your favourite?! Thanks

You'll enjoy the fancy food. I ordered a Batasia tea and Panini. Was not disappointed. The panini was very subtle and the flavours had been mixed well. Service is good enough too. But the kitchen noise kills the mood. Music was good until the moment I was there so that's a plus point too. I'd recommend it for a date or for a day of self-exploration. The macarons were a major turn off though. Do not try them. You'll be disappointed.

I keep going back to this place for the amazing hot chocolate that they serve! Apart from that I have tried their white sauce pasta which is also good. The last time I visited this place, we called for red velvet pancakes. Though it sounded tempting but it wasn't really one. The pancakes were very dry and plain. We thought of adding an ice cream scoop to make it taste better but the cafe does not serve ice creams. Overall a good experience especially because of the beautiful rustic interiors.

I have been here a couple of times and my recent impression of this restaurant is much better than some of my starting ones! Coming to the location, if you proceed from College More towards Webel, take the first left beside the college, walk straight for 5 minutes and you would see this outlet spreading over a huge area on the ground floor of a building named South City Pinnacle. Ever since, this was launched, there had been much praise about the same as well as there had been criticisms of failing quality.

Coming to the ambiance, the area covered by the restaurant is huge. But, as many have written in their reviews, the space hasn't been properly utilized. The ceiling are so damn high, even coconut trees would start blushing! They have an concept of open kitchen. Although, the front portion is covered, so it basically doesn't offer you any glimpse as to what is happening except for the fact someone is doing something. Once you enter the restaurant, you can see cookies and pastries being showcased infront of you! If not anything, the rainbow colored pastry is bound to deserve your attention.

Their menu has had a complete overhaul and now includes many new items. Have tried here Baked Fish, Stuffed Chicken, Pan Cakes, Shakes, Pastries, Chicken Red Thai Curry, Roast Chicken (modified to Red Wine Sauce instead of Mustard Sauce).
Didn't like much the Stuffed Chicken (Pouliat Poulet) as the stuffing was minimal. The Hagelnut Frappecino I tried, was decent, nothing extraordinary though. Pancakes disappointed me as well, as they were literally served within 2 minutes of my order, indicating those were heated up, and not freshly prepared. Red Thai Curry; fragrant smell of the curry leaves with flavorful gravy. What had impressed me the most was the Rainbow pastry and the recent Roast Chicken. The pastry was exquisite and so was the Roast Chicken. The sauce was well done, the portion size was big. All in all, it was one of the best Chicken Steaks I have ever tasted!

The people serving here are polite and courteous. I was recognized here even though I made my recent visit almost after 5-6 months post my last one. ¬†All in all, this place is definitely worth a try.

Tit bit: For those following David Rocco and his Indian Odyssey, he did visit here as a part of his Kolkata travelogue.

If you are looking for a beautiful place to have a perfect brunch with your favourite girlfriends, this is The Place. It's easy to locate and bigger than the ballygunge outlet.
As soon as you set foot inside, you are undoubtedly transported to a cafe in Paris. It has a rusty and vintage feel with cute cushions and flower vases adorning the whole place!üòç
I had Oreo Shake, Vegetable Au Gratin, Chocolate Nutella Crepe, Red Velvet Cupcake  and a piece of their famous Rainbow Cake. Except the Oreo Shake everything was just PERFECT!‚ù§
The service was prompt and I loved the little heart shaped spoons they give. Highly recommended. ‚ò∫

This is a wonderful place. The ambience is just perfect, a small place with cute pink chairs and tables and flowers here and there with vintage candle stands and everything you can find in a cafe in Paris! 
I went there with my friends to celebrate the end of my finals (hehe) but its an amazing place, perfect for having breakfast everyday and to read a book with a cup of coffee.
The only thing I have a complain with is, being a vegetarian I could not try any of the delicious mouth watering desserts, only one or two options were available . I would really really love if I would have got eggless desserts as well.

Very Poor. After seeing reviews we thought the steaks should be of some standards so we ordered them for home delivery.They asked us to pay delivery charges@150 for New town. We said fine. It took 20 minutes over the phone to make the delivery boy understand where we are located. When we received the food it was absolutely cold . The recipe is also very shaggy.
Fish steak quite smelly.
Chicken tetrazinni 0 star
Chicken steak is nothing to say.
Only fish finger was excellent.

This place was on the checklist for quite some time now and finally we could go there. Situated in the heart of Sector V , Saltlake. This is a premium bakery with continental and European Cuisine on offer.

The d√©cor and ambience is very soothing with a Victorian or English touch to the furniture and decor.

The Menu is elaborate and the dishes are good. What they could improve would be maybe on the quantity.

We ordered the Pasta Agolio with Chicken and Mushrooms., A veg salad, A Chicken omelette
which could have been better in terms of the no. Of butter toast given with the omlette, Garlic Cheese Bun, and Cappuccino, Lemon Iced Tea and the Much awaited red velvet Cheesecake. The Cheesecake was the show stealer with other dishes being good accompaniments. The whole place was good and the experience was nice.

Would definitely visit again

Finally visited the cafe..And I was slightly, just slightly let down first cause of the location and next decor cause the pics uploaded are so much fancier+prettier..
That aside, the place is spacious and the huge glass walls makes the place sunlit lifting your mood ..
Decor: The rustic furniture, white chairs with bonjour+Paris cushions, the chandelier, golden carved decorated mirrors, the golden cages..all of these are such a beauty to the eye.. Also both the embroidered tissue holder and the beautifully hand stitched billing book are worth a mention. It had the typical French cafe type interior, though it does need a little bit Maintainance, also the washrooms are located far off. 

Food:
Cappuccino-One of the best, coffee cravers should visit.
Hot Chocolate-Aahh..too good..not too sweet and  good chocolaty.
They served tiny Minny muffins along with which were cute.
Pancakes were delicious,fluffy and tasty.
Veg Lasagne- palatable dish along with a garlic bread, perfectly baked and the quantity was good too. 
Masala Omlette was great and healthy without the yolk. 
Spinach and Corn Crepe- was covered with a cheesy sauce underneath was a spicy filling of spinach and corn..spinach tasted so good..it had a dash of mustard sauce which was very tangy!!
Caramel Pastry and Hazelnut pastry- I guess I was too full to enjoy it, but they sure were one of the best.

Service: the staff were so prompt and warm. Service was pretty quick which is rare in Kolkata. Dishes were served beautifully. Great job guys.

Special mention: Oh my Gawd.. The Love shaped Spoon just won my heart. 
This place is My Personal favourite, it's one of the hidden treasure of Kolkata. I can visit this place numerous times and I so wanna do it. I wish you guys could stay open late.

We had a get together of my wife's friends and their husbands. And it generally is on me to decide on the restaurant. I wanted to visit this place since it had opened.

When we arrived at the restaurant, our friends were already waiting there. And disappointment was written on their face. We were the only ones in the cafe, the chair cushions were worn out, stained and needed an urgent replacement. The first impression was not that great. The interiors were similar to a typical French cafe - small round tables, curvy chairs, small paintings. The waiters welcomed us, and did not rush us to order.

We ordered sweet crispy baby corn, ginger glazed chicken wings, and panco fried chickens for appetizers. All three were very good. The panco fried chicken was served with a homemade tartar sauce which was quite great.

For mains, we order chicken tetrazzani, fish florentine, chicken stroganoff, roast mustard chicken. In most places, chicken stroganoff is served with rice, but here it was served with spaghetti. The result was quite good. For the fish florentine, they had used deep fried fish. The dish tasted good, the spinach was done to the right extent. Chicken tetrazzani and roast chicken were also well appreciated.

For dessert, we had cheese cake and a pastry which looked like a rainbow. Both of them were quite good. Over all we had a good experience. Being a Sunday, and located in the interior of the office buildings, it was empty and we had the entire restaurant to us for the couple of hours we spent there. If they work on their faded seat cushions, it would be a perfect cafe experience.

Just on the ground floor of south city pinnacle, this restaurant is a very classy one well decorated and aristocratic look. All continental dishes and desserts.
The grilled chicken pizza is very good, crispy thin crust with ample amount of chicken, 8 small pieces.
The best item is baked fish. Too good, too cheesy simply awesome.
The grilled chicken sandwich is very good. Grilled Chicken steak is not so good.
Chicken lasagne is average little more tangy. Cajun Rubbed fish is an offbeat item. Very spicy but not hot piece of grilled fish and rice. Not so good but different
Desserts are very expensive compared to the quantity but taste is good.
The service is good and waiters are helpful for guiding you place the order.
Overall experience is nice. A must go for continental food lovers.

To reach Paris cafe you have to get down on the bus stop called 1st gate and its inside south city pinnacle.
From the decor point of wise I was expecting more as the pictures on zomato are too good.However I have to say it kinda looked disorganised.I loved the lights,chair table,tissue holder,cheque holder etc.
I ordered mushroom omelette and double espresso.The omelette was heavenly!
The dishes are averagely priced,I felt.

Service here is worth mentioning in the review.The guys were fast and sweet üòÄ

It's a beautifully sunlit and spacious restraunt in Salt Lake. The interior was a bit shabby. But the food was good. The Chicken and Mushroom Cr√™pe was really tasty. The Panini and Veg lasagna were also good. The water melon slush was quite average.
Had heard a lot about its Rainbow Cake. But I didn't find it that great.
Overall nice experience.

Well well! After a long boring day it was time for some coffee and snacks. So me and my friend thought of visiting this place. I had the name on my mind for a very long time. So today was the day. This cafe has two branches one is in Ballygunge and another is in Salt Lake Sec V. Though my visit was to the Salt Lake outlet. 

The ambience of this place was more like a vintage English cafe with some Oprah music playing behind. Though they can work more over the interiors which can make it more better. Anyway the behaviour of the staffs were polite. Now let's come to the food part ; we had ordered for :
>Garlic Bread - It tasted amazing perfect with a hot cup of coffee. 
>Grilled Vegetables and Cheese filled Panini - Perfect evening Snack, loaded with cheese grilled perfectly.
>Chicken Mushroom Wrap - Didn't find it that great. Less of cheese more of onion. The filing inside was boring. Could have made it better. 
>Dream Come True Pastry - It looks so fascinating. I call it the rainbow pastry! Well doesn't taste that good unlike the looks of it. Has a lot of coconut flavour in it. (Personally I don't like coconut flavour)  But yes you guys can try it! 
>Coffee - It was just perfect.

Overall it was a good experience with affordable rates! Will surely look forward to visit again. :)

Bigger than the South Calcutta outlet, but not much thought on decor. Just a big glass box with chandeliers. We had the grilled chicken steak and it was so good. Wasn't expecting that from a place which was famous for desserts. And of course the red velvet cake, heavenly.

I have been wanting for so long to go to this place and i am glad i could finally make it. I am still stunned by the taste of desserts this place serve. The Nutella crepe is the most amazing and mysterious thing one can have here. The red velvet cake is nothing less than a treat to your taste buds. Savories were also good. We had mozzarella sticks, pizza sticks, chicken steak, Mexican rice. The taste was amazing for all of them. I the drinks i liked the most was water melon fritter. The ambience us quite light and formal but you would love it.

I have visited this place twice now. The decor no doubt is very Parisian and inviting. Can't say the same about the staff though. I ordered for red velvet pancakes and fish n chips during one of my visits. I was served only the red velvet pancakes and they completely forgot about the fish n chips. The red velvet cupcakes were good to look but not so good to eat. They were extremely hard and chewy. The menu is not very impressive and choice is really less. Moreover the staff lacks basic sense of courtesy and customer service. Very bad experience overall

One of the beautiful places in kolkata. Very tasty meals and beverages with beautiful environment and Paris music. It's pretty and staff were also very friendly. Service is little slow maybe because i went here in opening hours. I had a Green Mango Mojito which was very refreshing and incredibly tasty and a rainbow pastry with looks very beautiful and in taste super delicious. Must visit Cafe. Personal favorite. Recommended to all.

Made a visit to this cafe on one fine evening with friends. Tried few of the dishes along with the pastries that keeps flooding their page in zomato. To my surprise it was not something special or noteworthy. Food was okay and the pastries were not at all of great taste. Only thing about the pastries is that it looks really good for photos. The decoration inside the cafe was nice. To me , the place is a bit overrated and wont like to visit the cafe anytime soon.

Beautiful ambience and good food. Tried the grilled chicken panini and chicken tertrazinni. Loved them both. I also tried a chocolate shake and a hazelnut frappuccino, which were quite nice too. I had heard a lot about their red velvet cake but was a little disappointed by it. The cake wasn't mixed well. ..hence it wasn't uniformly red. Seemed more of a chocolate marble cake.

Everybody is talking about this cafe however I hav'nt had an encounter yet ,it was only at Zomato office Kolkata we had tried some nice red velvet cupcakes and chocolate √©clairs  which we were served to try out and let me tell you it really was a delightful experience as the cream and preparation of the cupcakes were nice ,fresh and the colour of the cup cake was velvet red which is something different from the regular cupcakes , same goes for the chocolate √©clairs being a totally new item I am hearing about ,its really a good indulgence to try out .

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
We ordered at no later than 12:50pm, we waited till 1:55pm for our main course to be served and then had to cancel and return witout having our food. While we waited for our food, we saw the same dish to be served to a group who came much later than us. Right now I am extremely hungry but I am even more embarassed. Given an option, would have rated this cafe negatively.

This place had been on my list for a long time, but I never got the chance to go. Finally, this winter, me and my friend went to this place hoping to eat some good, pocket friendly food. This is a new outlet, its located near college more and is easy to find. Its really big, but at the same time, its warm and cosy.¬†

Ambiance (4/5) : This place is just so warm. The lights are very soothing, there are small chandeliers everywhere. Small cushions saying 'bonjour' are kept on a few chairs. There is a small stall of sorts selling odd items. There are gilded mirrors too. All in all, very very cute. Perfect for a girly brunch or a date!

Service (4.5/5) : The service was quick. The staff was polite, courteous and efficient. I had no complaints with them at all. They even made some food quickly for us cause we were really hungry.¬†

Food (4/5) : I ordered a Mocha for my drink. I really liked the coffee here. I even took a refill! They serve the coffee with a very small round, and very soft vanilla cake. We ordered the mixed sauce pasta first. We wanted some condiment with the pasta, so we got babycorn added to it. I really really liked it. It just hit the right taste buds! Next, we ordered a Vegetable Paprika and a Pouliat Poulet. Both the dishes looked nice and the quantity is just right after one has had a starter. The Vegetable Paprika was tomato based, was tangy, a little but not too spicy. The tanginess and the pepper went well with the rice. The Pouliat Poulet was cooked well, stuffed with mushrooms and olives and tasted well with the sauce. It was well accompanied with mashed potato. I was too full so I couldnt have the very famous rainbow cake, but it looked so nice sitting in the jar!

Vfm (4.5/5) : This place is a must go. The food tastes well, looks good, quantity is just right and is easy on the pocket. The place is very cosy and beautiful. Paris Cafe was an evening well spent. Glad I went here with my bestfriend.

Visited this beautiful cafe for lunch a few days back when I was in Kolkata, and I literally wish I could've eaten there more than once. 
Located in the silent lanes of salt lake, near sector 5, Paris Cafe seems like a hidden gem  in a noisy city like Kolkata. 
We reached here about 2 pm and the place was quite empty. I was awestruck by the beautiful interiors and the designs. The furniture is rustic, classy and just so beautiful. White chairs with pink cushions, the walls decorated with carved mirrors. Beautiful hangings (refer pictures), well maintained and absolutely lovely. 
Finally moving on to the food, we ordered a mushroom crepe, Panco burger, Virgin Mojito, watermelon freezer and a Nutella crepe. 
The mushroom Crepe was by far the best I've ever had. The Crepe was covered in a yummy cheese sauce sprinkled with seasonings and the crepe beneath had spicy mushroom filling. I can have that numerous times. 
The burger was accompanied with French fries, the cutlet was spicy chicken with some Mayo sauce and veggies. The burger was filling and delicious. Loved it. 
The drinks were average, the presentation could've been better. We also had a red velvet cupcake which tasted delicious. 
Last but not the least, Nutella Crepe. What a beautiful indulgence. Nutella oozing out of the crepe accompanied with fresh cream and apples. So chocolatey and gooey. Perfect dessert! 
The service was warm, receptive and prompt. The waiters served everything with a smile and were extremely polite unlike most restaurants in Kolkata. I appreciate this quite a lot. 
Special mention to the billing book, which had a beautiful cover hand stitched I believe. So pretty! 
Pricing was about 960 rupees for whatever we'd ordered which is perfectly fine. The quantity and the quality of every dish was upto the mark. This place is value for money. 
I'm definitely going here whenever I'm in Kolkata next, I'm in love with this cafe. If you still haven't visited this cafe, go right away. Girls especially, you'll fall in love with this cafe. 
Just a little good music, and a few books to read would make it perfect. 
Good going guys, keep up the brilliant work and maintain it in the long run.

I went to the place for Christmas Lunch. I returned to Calcutta after 14 years and have been flooded with recommendations for these new cafes and restaurants. Paris Cafe in Salt Lake looks pretty, love the natural light and the little sunny patch outside. We were a little disappointed to see no Christmas specials on the menu and the severely constricted choice of meats - we didn't find anything other than chicken. There were no seasonal crepes. No barbeque chicken. No seasonal fruits?! On a cool winter day? And yet you are serving water melon juice! What we eventually ordered was nice, standard cafe food. Wholesome flavours, loved the cilantro fish with cous cous especially. But the management need to train the staff ASAP. Extremely brusque to the point of being rude. There was one waiter for the entire restaurant and he couldn't care less. No apologies for what is missing from the menu. No one offered us water, till the very end. What left a bad taste in the mouth? When the first dish arrived at the table, it was a while before the others followed. When we asked about the other orders, this guys just shrugged and told us rather condescendingly: Ektu toh shomoy lagbei! You don't place one dish on a table with a family that has come to enjoy a meal together and delay the others. Cardinal sin. even if it takes time you are supposed to ask: Should we bring the plates as they are readied or all together? AND you don';t speak to your clients as though you are doing them a favour and that they don't know any better. European food but pathetic etiquettes.

As Zomato says this cafe is known for a hint of Paris in Kolkata, you'll infact get a hint of Paris here. The ambience, the food, the styling everything will remind you of a classic French cafe.
Have tried quite a few of their dishes and haven't ever been disappointed. Love the steaks here, simply love them. Special attraction for me has always been the rainbow pastry that we get here, it just looks so beautiful that you'll feel happy eating it.

Pink and white ambience gives a soft glow and a beautiful appeal to the place. The place has good interiors. One of the best theme cafes situated in Salt Lake. The best part of this place is the Rainbow Cake. ¬†I was delighted by both the looks and taste of it. For me It is the USP of the place. I also had pasta which was good. Must try :)

Paris cafe is a great option for those who love continental and Italian dishes and a great place for beautiful deserts. We had ordered a crepe, chicken steak, pouliat poulet , chicken tetrazini. Every dishes tasted very good. In desert we ordered chocolate fudge cake and red velvet cheese cake. Loved the fudge cake but didn't like the cheese cake much.

I reached Kolkata today and for dinner i was looking for some nice and cozy place nearby the hotel I checked in (opposite Technopolis building). I saw the reviews here and walked down to the place which was 1.2km away. Really a good place to dine or to have a cup of coffee with friends or alone. Waiters have a very good sense of suggestions with explanation of recipe which helps you to imagine the food as well. Tried Orange cilantro prawns... Absolutely lip smacking...

I love this place. Bright interiors, plate names in French and very reasonable. The pesto spaghetti is probably my favourite, along with the Salad St. Germain. Honestly, the quantities could be tad more, but at this price it's not really much of a complaint. The shakes are pretty great but the pastries are strictly okay.

This is the new and bigger outlet Which is situated next to the lane of college more. It's in the ground floor of South city pinnacle.
The ambience is very cozy. The decor gives a feel of Paris. I found the little cushions on the chair saying "bonjour" very cute. Even the chandeliers and cages on the ceiling added to the beauty of this place.

Coming to the food, we ordered a mushroom crepe and I was pretty happy with that. The Oreo shake and fresh lime soda were average. The Mexican rice with baked potatoes was not at all worth the money. I liked the taste but it could have been better. The price for the quantity they provide is not worth it. Other cafes offering the same cuisines taste the same or better with lesser price and greater quantity.
The service and ambience is good but not very satisfied with the food and how it's priced.

Good things first : The cafe is spacious and the location is good, the interiors are nice and cosy. And they make some delicious scrambled eggs! 
We ordered for scrambled eggs with mushrooms which was just about perfect with right seasoning along with a warm buttery bread, the Aglio olio pasta was swimming in olive oil but the flavours were okay ( avoid if you can ) but what I found funny was their service. 
I ordered for a fresh lime soda ( too sugary sweet )  along with my food which never came until dessert was served which is rather weird that too I had to remind them more than once, though the waiter wrote the order! 
A prawn cocktail was served which is sort of like a joke if you have ever tasted a prawn cocktail in any restaurant in Park Street.
For dessert a chocolate crepe was ordered which couldn't be finished because it was again way too sweet. 
The service isn't great, the waiters are busy doing their own things and the food is pretty average well apart from the scrambled eggs of course. 
This is a very average cafe according to me, good for hanging out with friends and colleagues but not for major food buffs.

I have been longing to go to this place after reading good reviews in zomato & in Newspapers. Finally I paid a visit last week in the Sector 5 branch, sadly after the devastating attack in Paris. 

A beautifully done up place with large glass walls & vintage furniture. But they gave us a dirty menu printed very casually rather photocopied. Not expected from such a posh place with "Paris" in its name which spells out style & panache. Nevertheless we ordered Caramel Hot chocolate, Cold Coffee, Chocolate Fudge,Chicken Caesar Salad & a Fish Steak for our meal.

They were really prompt in serving the Cold coffee, Chocolate Fudge & hot chocolate. These were served with two tea cakes & a chocolate spoon, very cute indeed & the drinks were just perfect! 
The chocolate fudge was divine.
Then came the Chicken Caesar salad. Looked pretty but tasted just average, the veggies were not fresh & crunchy & neither was the dressing remarkable.

Now the last one ‚Äì the Fish Steak. The Fish was stale , it smelt & the mushroom sauce was rather tasteless. The couscous was good though, but of course no one will remember a fish dish for the couscous. 

We had even taken a Black forest, a Red velvet cupcake & a Rainbow Pastry as take away. Very impressive & pretty packaging. The Black Forest was great, the Rainbow cake & Red velvet cup cake was good.

On the whole the food was fine considering the price nothing to go gaga over. The staff was well informed & helpful. 

Now for the ambience everything is amazing except their open kitchen. The chefs were probably preparing some Garlic & chili based dishes & the whole place was full of hot fumes which made us sneeze continuously. The authorities should take this up immediately as it is very uncomfortable.

I would recommend it for a nice cup of coffee & conversation, but would avoid ordering main course. Would love to go back for breakfast perhaps!!

First of all the d√©cor and ambience of the place is very good. Although it is a cafe but they serve a wide variety of main courses. Service was prompt and good. Tried their chicken Tetrazzini(with mushroom add on),cold coffee and chocolate macaroons. Quality of the dishes were very good. Chicken Tetrazzini was very very good. Chicken breasts were cooked perfectly. It was juicy and the spaghetti was great. Cold coffee was good,nothing extraordinary. Macaroons were good. Prices may look a bit on the higher side but flavour and portions will compensate for that. Only thing is that they should add few good desserts in their menu bcz I hardly got any!! Overall very good experience!

The ambience of this place is truly amazing and so is the service and the food. It was a bit difficult for us to locate and that's when zomato came to our rescue! when we reached, the cafe was empty and we sat in a table near the huge glass windows. The weather was amazing and it complimented the ambience of the place! We had ordered a rainbow pastry, a pan cake in chocolate sauce, a barbecue chicken wrap, a green tea, a cheese omelette and a spaghetti. All the dishes were good and person taking our order was also very helpful. The dishes were reasonable priced and we were very much satisfied with our visit to this place!

Paris Cafe - the name sounds quite interesting..going by the name does it really provide you a feel of Paris or the taste of Paris?? Landed in Paris after a random check of the nearby places in sector5. I had seen pics of this rainbow coloured pastry sometime back but din't know where to have it. After checking out the reviews I finally got it üòá so here I go to Paris cafe  just to have the rainbow colored pastry on my birthday. The pastry was sweet, fluffy and filled with cream and sprinkled with sugary syrup. We ordered for oreo and strawberry shakes and pouliat poulet but got disappointed. Ambience was good but overall it failed to give us a feel or taste of Paris.

I like their cheese balls, Panaco chicken and club sandwich which comes with mayo n chicken. Cappuchino is commendable also the small muffins they give complimentary ( Last week did not get though). Right next to my office in Salt Lake. Ambience should improve considering its pricey. Sanitation must be improved. I saw flies at my table last week when I visited. Waitors are very well behaved and so for them and the good food my rating is 4.

I HAD to visit this place since I absolutely LOVE its Ballygunge counterpoint, so one fine afternoon I towed my mother along and arrived at this quaint, little and extremely pretty outlet of Paris Cafe. This one is bigger and the menu of course is better. The decor will remind you of the cute little French Cafes you see in movies complete with the archetypal chandelier and golden baroque wallpapers. Coming to the food now, we of course ended up ordering a lot more than we could finally eat.

Chocolate Shake- Was very thick and good. Provided a good start to the meal.

What we ordered: Pouliet Poulet- Its a Chicken Main with breasts of chicken stuffed with Mushrooms and drizzled with brown barbecue sauce. It was supposed to be served with a mash, but I asked them to give me veggies instead to which they readily obliged. I liked my stuffed chicken, but may be it could have been a bit less dry. I little more drizzle of the sauce would have taken the dish a few notches higher. Verdict Above Average: 3.5/5

Chicken Stroganoff- This was a good version of the classic Russian dish. They replaced the rice with Spaghetti and I think they should have probably pt in a bit more chicken in there. There were very few chicken pieces and too many mushrooms instead. My mother complained about it, however the taste was okay. Verdict - Average 3/5

Now a visit to the Paris Cafe is incomplete without sampling its famed desserts. We of course had the famed Rainbow cake with a cute French Flag on top and a red velvet cheesecake. The Rainbow cake was good as usual, however I think the one I have at the Ballygunge outlet tastes better. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was a Royal Downer. The cheese part was so stiff that it was really hard to cut through it. It wasn't fresh and didn't taste good either. Possibily one of the worst cheesecakes I have ever had. I couldn't finish it and left it after a bite.

This place has a lot of possible and could do really well with a few more items on the menu and some classic French desserts like Creme Brulee and the likes.

Since this place was featured under Sweet Tooth, I decided to give it a try as I love desserts. But in the end, it turned out to be an average visit.
I had already gone through the menu at Zomato before visiting and was looking forward to having some pancakes as I haven't had one before, but to my surprise they said that they didn't have pancakes.
We finally ordered Shakes and Cold Coffee which towards its end felt more like crushed brownies which I didn't enjoy much, Chicken Mushroom Crepe which was pretty good, Chicken Tetrazinni which was average, Fudge Cake which was delicious and lastly a couple of Maccarons which were crunchy.
Now to point out the cons, the first thing I didn't like was that the menu cards were photocopied. I mean come on, how hard is it to keep some proper menu cards and not give out the photocopied ones. The next thing was that there was no proper ventilation inside so whatever they were cooking, the strong smell was filling up the area and affecting our eyes and noses. It was a big con as we got uncomfortable because of that. And lastly, I would maybe think about visiting it once more and I would request them to either have pancakes or remove them from the menu as nothing is more disappointing than having a dish you want rejected by the staff, it totally kills the mood for the time being.
Other than all these, the place is nice and the decorations are very good and peaceful.

A place if you are looking forward for a calm and beautiful decor. To begin with I was at once impressed by the decor and with the props used to decorate this place. A perfect location as well with just the perfect lighting if you are looking for a fancy yet not so fancy dine.
To begin with the food, We ordered Chicken Steak and Chicken Stroganoff.
and yes it was definitely delicious and was very well served with just perfect spaghetti and the gravy that came along with it :)
The staff was yes very helpful and the drinks (Brownie shake and Watermelon juice) were perfect ! :)¬†
Kudos to the team at Paris Cafe :)

Place is nice and easily locatable.
Cool ambiance, especially because of the interiors and the music.
The food is good with nice blend of distinct flavours.
Decent varieties of pastries available and they are good.

In short, a quick escape to refreshment!

Its pretty, spacious and beautifully sun-lit...and can instantly make you happy!
And the good thing is that they've almost 'perfect'-ed the art of cafe-type-continental-food...

So here's what we ordered:

1) Dream Come True Pastry Wedge - 1 wedge came at 140 bucks plus taxes but boy it sure did lift my spirits ! Sweet, fluffy, double-creamed gateaux with a generous sprinkling of sugar syrup - spongy layers in all 7 rainbow colors - guaranteed to bring out the child in you!

2) Citron Coriander Fish - Fresh-water bhetki fish in a white sauce and a dash of mustard sauce - the perfect dose of parsley dressing, with a side of light, grainy couscous.

3) Chicken Stroganoff - The chicken was perfectly saucy and seasoned! We asked for a side of rice instead of spaghetti, and it tasted just as nice!

4) Chicken Tetrazini - The regular white sauce affair again, but with good seasoning, combined with a very palatable yet light aglio olio, and a side of crunchy, buttery garlic bread.

5) Mojitos and Fresh Lime Sodas - tasted refreshing and came in tall glasses!

Service is very patient and cordial. All of this and a slice of sunshine for about 1500 for 3, so the math is pretty simple I guess...:)

My family and I usually escape to Salt Lake during the day for durga puja and try out the restaurants and caf√©s in the area. So it was Paris Caf√© this time. 

The first shock as soon as we entered were the Christmas carols being played! Felt like a time warp. But if this was funny, what wasn't was the used napkins on one of the chairs and the waiter giving us half a bottle of water and three glasses for six people. Not good.

The cheese balls starter tasted nice but five small balls as a starter frankly looked quite funny rolling around in the serving dish. The pizza sticks looked and tasted much better.

The chicken mains were flavourful and generous though a tad overcooked, but the same can't be said for the Lemon Coriander fish and Cajun fish. Both the fish dishes had tiny fish portions and a bit of rice, as if as an afterthought. They looked quite anticlimactic and more like a starter than a main where you expect generosity.

The meal was however rescued by the desserts. The macaroons, the signature Rainbow cake, the red butter cream cake were all to die for. The cheesecake tasted good but without the short, crumbly biscuit crumb base, it felt disappointing. And as people may know by now, my sis and I are cheesecake snobs. 

So overall, a mixed experience. There is a lot of scope for improvement, especially the clanging and banging of the dishwashing which is done in the same space as the kitchen and not in a soundproof or closed off section. We couldn't hear ourselves over the din!

Had high hopes from this posh decor cafe which is a talk of the city!!!! But I was totalllyyyy disappointed with the quantity and also the taste of food!!! The red velvet cake that is so much hyped up about this cafe didn't impress me a lot.The chicken caesar salad that we had ordered was so lil in quantity and the price was way too much for it.I can't think of paying a second time visit to this over rated place owing to it being a hole in the pocket!!!

We went there during the lunch time and as we were pretty hungry so we ordered our food immediately. I would like to say the outlet seems quite classy and decorated. We ordered grilled jacket potatoes as a starter, citron coriander fish and chicken penne Arrabbiatta pasta as main course and chocolate brownie as desert . Grilled jacket potatoes was really a new dish to us,and we liked it.and also we loved rest of the food too.i would like to comment on their fish item.it was real delicious, which i never expected from a restaurant like this.so if you are wanting to have good food in a classy yet beautiful place then this place is a must try.

The much talked about Parisian cafe setting at this place. I found the birdcages, mirrors and wicker chairs all a bit try hard. It's all charming, nevertheless. And the food is what matters. We were here solely for dessert. Given the drought of top quality desserts in Calcutta for me so far, I was delighted to find red velvet here. The cheese cake was a humongous slice. It was constructed interestingly and was delicious. I can't believe this but is there ever too much cream cheese? On this cake, I think so. The red velvet cupcake however, was perfection. Gotta go back for more of that. Gotta go back for a full meal.

Update:

Went back for a proper lunch during the Pujo holidays and had a lovely time. We went all out with our order. Spinach crepe. Quesadilla. Veg tetrazinni. Chicken burger. Oreo shakes. Rainbow cake. The goddamn works!!¬†

I'll keep it short and say that, we loved mostly everything. Nitpick: The mushroom quesadilla was overloaded with green chillies. It took guts to order that huge chunk of cake at the end but hey, it was so light that it vanished in minutes. Great food. Good service. Cute place. I am thrilled to have discovered a warm nest close to home.

I went there yesterday with a friend of mine. I don't know salt lake sector 5 too well, and neither do my friend. But I have heard a lot about this small cafe from a lot of my friends so I decided to check it out. First thing first, we couldn't locate it so we called the person ( took the number from zomato ) to ask about the location. Guess what? This person made was literally roam around IEM. He told us to take the right then, then after 5 mind take the left turn. It was so irritating. Like if you don't know where your outlet is then maybe you should give the phone to someone who knows the location and don't just blabber stuffs without knowing. It was very irritating and unprofessional. So we came there after 20mins+ of roaming around. It was small but cute. Food was average. Loved my fresh lime soda though!

Been there yesterday, during lunch time. Was almost full, shows that it's pretty famous now. Nice ambience, though personally felt that glass walls more resemble coffee houses, not eateries. 

However ordered chicken steak, chicken strongoff and sizzling brownie with cream. Though others were seen getting their orders in decent period of time, but unfortunately our order took almost an hour. Food was good, would not say great, but was good. Brownie with cream was awesome. Overall was a nice experience.

A restaurant with a Romantic fragrance just like Paris itself, one of the best to go on a date üòâ.
Staff is good and responsive.
Tasted #PrawnCocktail, #ChickenSteak as main course and #SnickersShake, #Mojita in drinks. Food was good but couldn't beat our expectations as Chicken Steaks were somewhat hard and rubbery and Mojita was more of a pudina leaves than a drink. The Best was the #ChocolateTruffleCake which was unmatchableüòä.

A little bit of Paris in sector 5 , Kolkata. Visited this wonderful caf√© yesterday. Read on to find out how the experience was.

Paris Caf√© is situated at the ground floor of the Pinnacle building, just opposite to the Aegis building.

Ambience ‚Äì The ambience is good for this glass surrounded caf√© . It has small amazing decors to give the French feeling. Also the cute little chairs and tables add to this feeling.

Hospitality ‚Äì Nice and prompt staffs who will guide you through the whole ordering phase.

Food ‚Äì We ordered the following: kitkat milkshake, chicken steaks, red velvet cheesecake, red velvet cupcake and macaroons. The chicken steaks were cooked beautifully and taster super. So was the red velvet cheesecake. The kitkat milkshakes seem to have extra sugar. The cupcake was sub standard and needed to be fluffier.

Overall a nice experience.

Though this outlet is huge compared to the Ballygunge one but not as pretty as the latter. They have tried to recreate the Ballygunge cafe the same way but have failed!! Anyhow the food is good n this place has more options as the kitchen area is larger n has more staff, but again very less options for pastries, which is very very disappointing. One goes to this place with the sole intention of trying a variety of the pastries but finding so less options its disheartening..

I love Continental Food the most. Their recipes, their fusions, I cherish the most. We planned to visit Paris Cafe at lunch since it was Monday and just 5 min. walk from my better half‚Äôs office. That‚Äôs how we landed up there. It‚Äôs nice hang out place. We ordered Vermicilli fried fish and Chicken Steak. Fish was tenderly fried and scrumptious. However, Chicken Steak was not upto the mark. Something I found missing there. How could we dare not to try Rainbow Cake? Yes, we tried and it tasted stupendous. I‚Äôll go for 3.5.

We ordered 2 kit kat shakes...one spaghetti pasta and one chicken steak...
The steak was absolutely soft and delectable...
Quantity was wholesome as I was stuffed to the throat...
Coming to the KitKat shake it tasted lovely...
We wanted to try some pastries but they were over by the time we entered...so never mind will b visiting this place again anyway...

I'm a big dessert freak so I have tried most of the pastries here. Caramel cake and Rose Macarons are my favourite but Nutella Crepe is something out of this world!
Apart from desserts, I have tried pasta, chicken panini which are again mind blowing.

I am quite fond of this place and visit quite often. I love the food, coffee, the friendly staff and the lovely decor. Also the fact that it offers parking makes it very convenient. However what I find not so great is that the place is very noisy mainly due to the noise from the kitchen which makes it unbearable to sit at some of the tables. It would be great if some acoustic treatment is done so that we can enjoy visiting this place.

A missed movie date brought me and my friend to this place. It's located in the South City Pinnacle building in Sector-5 Am not too good at directions with Sector-5, but if one just reaches College More, the rest can be covered walking.

I had read about this place in the papers, the images there and on Zomato fascinated me, but I must say I was a bit disappointed reaching here. The place is as it looks in the pictures, with exquisite lanterns hanging from the ceiling, bird cages used with fairy lights and pillars with frames and mirrors. The seating is comfortable with wooden chairs and tables made to look European and given that old feel. Two sides of the cafe are glass walls and it lets in ample daylight and the music is a mix of rock and pop. What did not work to all this good is that the table we chose was not properly cleaned after the previous occupants left. Their kitchen is there within all the air-conditioning and everything that is cooked adds to the ambiance, which may not be happy all the while.

We went about ordering for the day. It was late afternoon and I settled for a chicken steak and my friend indulged in pouliat poulet. Unfortunately both the dishes were almost the same. My steak was served with grilled veggies like broccoli, zucchini, bell peppers, baby corn and mashed potatoes. The other dish was chicken fillet rolled and stuffed with a filling of mushroom and olives and served with mashed potatoes. Both dishes had the same sauce (which l felt was a bit scarce for the portion served) and made them taste the same. The veggies were grilled well and the potato was mashed thin and flavoured. The chicken was a bit tough though. The presentation was up to the mark and the food looked appetizing.

We finished off with me choosing a cup of hot chocolate and him going for a cup of Darjeeling tea. the beverages were served well. Mine looked stunning and was served with a chocolate spoon. It was a bit on the sweeter side than I would have preferred.

Coming to the other aspects, the service speed is moderate. The place could do with a few more stewards, there is just one person for taking the order, serving and clearing the plates. Overall the place needs to be looked after well. They have such an amazing decor, they just need to maintain it. They have a separate washroom with the place which is there in the parking lot outside and one has to take a key to use it. The menu is moderately priced.

Overall, the food is okay, I must try the other dishes before coming to a conclusion. They have this beautiful looking, colourful pastry that I would like to try next time. The service is okay too. They must put more efforts at the up-keep of the place though.

Happy eating!! :)

I have not been to Paris, so quite unsure of how the cafes in Paris are .. But this place turned out to be quite a catch. I went there on a weekend evening and it was quite a cosy nook for people to sit down and chat with a cup of steaming coffee and some tit bits to go along with . Secluded from the hustle bustle of Sec V , the place had ample amount of seating arrangements and a soothing appeal to it . We had ordered some hot chocolate , garlic fries, sphagetti in mixed sauce and a fish vermicelli fry with cheese dip. All of these were upto the mark except for the quality of the fish . The service was prompt and the waiters were courteous enough to come and apologise personally when they had incorrectly taken down the order placed by us. The service had some room for improvement, but we conveniently ignored it as we were totally focused on the food.
Overall a great experience :)

Quaint place with a pleasing Parisian street side ambiance, it was the food that had race reviews. I spent a quiet relaxed evening by myself with a watermelon cooler and a Citron coriander Fish followed by a Capuchino  to round it off. The cooler was excellent with just the right citrus zing to it. The Bhetki (for the uninitiated, a kind of Bass that's a local fav) was flaky and cooked just right, but I did find the sauce a bit too salty that was throwing a brut idyl dish off Balance. The coffee was good. But at just around 500 quid it was total value for money. Like I said pity they don't serve beer / wines....

This restaurant is beautiful, well decorated and has great food and desserts. The ambience is part old-school french and part classical, maybe pre-Renaissance. They have ample seating and an open kitchen hidden behing a huge semi-wall of sorts. We got their garlic fries, two drinks, two pastas and four desserts. The drinks and fries were great, as was the pasta, probably the best I've had in Kolkata so far. Lemon tartlet, not so much, it was too sour. The cupcakecould have been more airy, but the macaron and eclair were great. Eclair could have another dimension, salted caramel perhaps, to cut through the chocolate. But the service was great, so was the ambience, and highly recommended.

The feel of this place is great. Excellent for people with a sweet tooth. The rainbow cake, the red velvet cake and the small cupcakes are so light and yummy that you can float in the air. The chocolate eclairs is my favorite. I call it my evil splurge. The Irish coffee is good too, if you like it strong. The staff is very polite and always greets you with a smile.

Always wanted to visit the Paris Cafe at Ballygaunge, but finally made it to the outlet in Sector V, Salt Lake on my last visit to Kolkata. The restaurant is smaller than I expected, but it did not affect the decor or the ambience. Ordered prawn cocktail, chicken steak and citron coriander fish, and everything tasted decent enough. Service was delightful - the staff was friendly and quite accommodating.

Overall, it's definitely an welcome addition to the emerging food hub that Sector V is becoming gradually.

Visited Paris Cafe this evening... Lovely ambience with soothing music and pretty good decor... There were three of us so we could order a vast array of dishes to cater to various tastes... The chicken omlette with a solitary toast was very well prepared... The Chicken Tetrazinni and Chicken Steak were spot on... Tried Chicken Paprika which was pretty good as well... This place is famous for its pastries and the Red Velvet Cheese Cake and Chicken Eclairs re-affirmed that fact... The dishes were well cooked and the prices are not exorbitant... Would definitely love to go back to try some more dishes...

What is a Paris Cafe?
Caf√© in continental Europe refers to a traditional type of coffeehouse, but elsewhere "cafe" may refer to a tea room, small and cheap restaurant, transport cafe, or other casual eating and drinking place. Mainly, Parisian caf√©s serve as a center of social and culinary life in Paris. Paris caf√©s are the meeting place, the neighbourhood hub, the conversation matrix, the rendezvous spot, the networking source, a place to relax or to refuel - the social and political pulse of the city. Typical Paris caf√©s are not ‚Äúcoffee shops‚Äù. They generally come with a complete kitchen offering a restaurant menu with meals for any time of the day, a full bar and even a wine selection. Among the drinks customarily served are the large cup of white coffee, wine by the glass, beer and espresso. It‚Äôs much cheaper than drinking in a bar.

*Location- Take a bus/auto/taxi from Utladanga to Sector five college mode. Walk straight towards IEM, take a left turn. Go straight for two minutes, you will discover Aegis building. The South City Pinnacle building is opposite of it. Hey, there you go... you get the right place on the ground floor.

*Ambience- Paris Cafe is a quaint Parisian style caf√© that doubles as a bakery shop. You couldn't ask for a more nostalgic place to bring your friends or books and spend the afternoon surrounded by the golden mirrors, vintage wooden chairs and cushions, a giant chandelier casts a soft glow for sitting back and watching the hustle and bustle of the city life makes it simply romantic.

*People- Once more, people are more human here. They recommended us truly well. They helped us to understand food, flavour and simply made the ideal dish trust me. Not only that I was almost running all over the place to get some good clicks. People are so sweet here; they were not troubled by my interest.

*Food-
Chef‚Äôs recommended us- Mushroom crepe/ Spinach and Ricotta cheese Cannelloni (veg) Chicken steak, Chicken stroganoff (Non veg) .

We tried-
1)	Grilled sandwich- The best ever I have tasted till the date. Served with French fries. Very beautifully blended with chicken, cream and don‚Äôt know with some magic sauces.¬†
2)	Chicken stroganoff- ‚ÄòStroganoff‚Äô comes from Russia in the mid 19th century. In France, the recipe finally got the now popular version with mushrooms. It's Abraham Lincoln and Charles Chaplin‚Äôs favourite dish ‚Äì is made with either sour cream or heavy cream. Some Chunks of Chicken, mushroom, parsley and pasta noodles blend with cheese and brown sauce, makes it super yummy ( little bit different that the original taste, it has a little bit of sweetness).
3)	Normal and Assorted cold coffee- 50 rupees difference, but if you choose assorted cold coffee, just describe them what you do want in your coffee. Like you can add anything- variations of creams, flavours and many more.
4)	Cappuccino- Simply good. This Italian coffee prepared with espresso, hot milk and steamed milk foam or cream.

¬†*Why I recommended this place?
Simply because of food and behaviour. Simply because of my overall rating is 4.5/5. Simply because I feel good when I am surrounded by really nice people. Simply because of the poetic look. Simply because, it‚Äôs the best ever cafeteria, I have attempted till now through Zomato. Simply because it‚Äôs romantic to be alone just with poetry, rain and a cup of coffee.

I tried their red velvet cupcakes and macaroons. I had got 3 flavours of macaroons. For me they were a tad too oversweet. Though they tasted nice with all the different fillings and flavours. The red velvet cupcake is actually very velvety and has a melt-in-the-mouth kind of texture. Delicious!

This is the latest outlet which had its small root shop Opp. To ice skating rink. This shop is cpvered on all three sides by transparent glass , thus this is naturally lit up and that is a major plus point adding to the beautifully decorated cabinets and mirrors on the wall , all having a Victorian era feeling. The tables are made of wood and cane chairs each have cushions all of which comfortably assist you in having a quick brunch of pasta penne with an oreo shake or a Roccher shake. Been to this place loads of times as it is perfectly situated only a few feet away from my college. A bit expensive but the Mojito's and shakes and their Irish Coffee are a must try for all. Along with the coffee try their choco eclairs which is loaded with 'Happiness', yes you guessed it right, Nutella!

The ambience exhuberates a victorian feel with the upholstery done in pink,white and gold. The grand chandelier further adds to the charm! The mood is instantly set and the food served here compliments it. We ordered cheese garlic bread,custom made pasta, brownie shake and mohito. Our favourite was the cheese garlic bread which had molten cheese oozing out! My bestfriend relished his brownie shake (I couldnt because the brownies were not eggless) and I sipped my mohito which was decent. The seating is comfortable and is perfect for deep conversations over a delicious spread!

Firstly i would like to start with the cons.. Too many flies.. I was irritated after a point.. 
It was breakfast time and we had ordered for a red velvet cheesecake (i doubt it was a cheesecake). The cake seemed stale as the icing was stiff and the cake was too cold to be served during the breakfast time. 
Now the pros.. Huge area.. Good coffee and great cheese garlic bread.. The red velvet cake looked super awesome.. And have u ever seen heart shaped spoon? üòç
But somehow i felt this bigger version of my beloved paris cafe.. Lacked the homely feeling.. The 'i am in paris' factor..

Weekday. Minions. Noon show. Lunch. This place was a nice addition to make a memorable outing more enjoyable. We had the custom made arabbiata penne pasta and cheesy garlic bread which were both lip smacking. We had ordered a brownie shake alongwith it which was good too. The mojito my friend had could've been better though. Nice place overall though.

No, no and nope. Gave it two chances, no more. Im not really sure they know what they are doing, i mean, if you want to be a pastry shop be that and execute that well, dont foray into mains and complicated stuff. The only passable item is the red velvet cupcake and i have had better. The macaroons are a sorry version of the true thing and lemon tart is as good or bad as any other bakery. For main course, we ordered a chicken steak, they were two hunks of dry chicken breast, bland and boring with some sauce and veggies, no dinner rolls no pasta to accompany. The chicken shashlik was the opposite, less than a few chunks of chicken doused in a brown sauce and served with super spicy aglio olio. I thought sashlik was a mushroom cream sauce but i guess they dont think so. All in all, im sorry for being so critical, but i really have no clue what a red thai curry is doing on your menu!

A place to give you a vintage kinda feeling. It had been in my to-be list for long and finally had the opportunity last week to hit the cafe...

Location: 2nd lane from sector V college more. Walk straight towards TCS building, you will find this place at the ground floor of PWC building i.e. south city pinnacle.

Ambiance: Very warm n cozy, to say the least. Every corner of the wall, ceiling are done tastefully with beautiful showpieces. The beautiful chandelier, the gorgeous mirror, the wooden chairs all together give you a nice ambiance to relax and have some good conversation over a cup of coffee and some good food. 5/5

Service: the steward who served us was helpful, suggested us with some good food. service was prompt apart from one or two items. 4/5

Food: Deliciously delectable... We ordered for chocolate shake, cold coffee, watermelon freezer as beverages,  lemon vermicelli fried fish as appetizer,  chicken steak, grilled chicken sandwich as main course and dream come true, velvet cheese cake as dessert.All the beverages were equally good, special mention to the chocolate shake. one of best chocolate shakes have ever had.Lemon vermicelli fish tasted sweet n sour. It was good but nothing memorable. Grilled chicken sandwich came with french fries and mustard sauce. It was heavy, chicken stuffing was satisfying and appealing and then the melting cheese out of the sandwiches. It was really worth every bite.
Chicken steak was also flavorsome. the chicken portion were succulent and juicy. it has a smoky flavor, just perfect to satisfy your taste bud.Now, the sweet dishes - Dream come true and cheese velvet cake just stole the show. Dream come true was a treat to our eyes as well as soul. It was fresh, mellow and flavorful. Velvet cheese cake was heavy enough to satiate your hunger. the center cheese portion tasted more than palatable. It was surely one of the mouth watering items we had that day. Food presentation of each item definitely needs special mention. 4.5/5

Over all, it was a great and scrumptious dining experience and I am definitely coming back to this place to explore more.

A completely unplanned visit on a Saturday afternoon...the place is in the south city pinnacle building at sector 5. I think we were the firsts guests for the day...the place was a little unkept but has a cute decorartion...  Plenty of natural light...we ordered for virgin mojito and one green mango mojito...both of the drinks were perfect and completely in accord with my taste buds...i ordered for the chicken teriyaki..and my friend ordered for the green lemon butter fish...the fish was fresh bhetki..the sauce was amazing...the perfect mix of lemon and butter...
Chicken however was a little tasteless ..just boiled ..lacked salt though the spaghetti part was just athe right amount of cheesy..
In all in was decent get away..and im sure must be refreshing for the people working in the building or around the area...

I visited this place a couple of hours back. Till date I had only tried it's pancakes and undoubtedly they were incomparable to anyone else's. However, today's experience was even more delicious, making me write this review as soon as I got back home. The chicken stroganoff is a must try along with their nutella crepe. The food is light, filling and will make you crave for more.

This branch of Paris Cafe at sector 5 probably aims to woo office goers. I have been here uncountable number of times for coffee, for lunch and even for a quick breakfast before entering office. This is one of my most favorite in this area.

Decor: The French connotations in the minimalistic decor supports the name of the cafe well. The two glass walls bring in a space enhancing effect. Before sunset the cafe gets ample natural light and in the evening it is well lit with soothing yellow lights .

Staff & Service: I have seen the staffs progressively improving over time . They are a decent bunch and would serve you well unless you want utmost perfection. Another good thing is that the place is never over crowded. So you'll never be late for the next meeting at office.

Menu: You'll find options in their menu for all your meals. I love the grilled chicken sandwich with a cup of cappuccino. I have never been disheartened with their coffee. Perfect for my taste.
The non-veg panini is another favourite for a quick bite.
Among the non-veg appetizers , all are worth trying . My personal favourites being panco fried chicken and fried fish.
For breakfast , the eggs with toast and fresh fruit juices are decent enough.
I have only tried their chicken steak in mains and I'm yet to try out more in that section.

And not to forget they have tempting deserts for sinful indulgences. So if you're not counting your calories try them all.

This is the destination calling for flowery ornamental description. A typical French Cafe ,with Bong staff,playing good ol retro,serving proper food.
We tasted Chicken Steak and Arabbiata Pasta with Ginger Bread. Both were delicious to be precise. Freshly cooked beans,baby corn,broccoli put the perfect flavours. The Green Mango Mojito was fine. My tummy and tongue were merry throughout.
Next time I plan to grab a Rainbow Cake bite!

Paris Cafe happens to be right next to my office building and is one of our favorite food joints. I love the muffins they give with the cappuchino and definately I love their cheese omlette and their chicken sandwich. I visit here very often. Food I think is a bit highly priced but the ambience is really nice. The sitting place is cozy but a little note on the sanity should be kept in mind as there are flies in the joint. I have no complaint against food and team as they are amazing. I would a suggest a slight faster service as we need to hurry back to work after the break.

The ambiance is good...but the food was highly disappointing...we ordered cheese balls, mushroom crepe and snickers shake...the cheese balls were just ok...but the mushroom crepe, which is supposedly a Paris cafe signature dish, was more than disappointing...I have never had crepe with cheese literally overflowing in all directions...and the cheese itself didn't taste very good...however I would love to try out their pasta and salads before commenting further!

So I visited this place and gave it a second chance...and it won our hearts this time 'round!!! the lemon vermicilli fried fish was super-awesome!! so was the citron coriander fish I ordered for main course! overall it stood up to our expectations this time and I would definitely visit this place to try out the cupcakes and macaroons...soon!! :)

Have been here twice in this week and several times earlier also - so, review toh banta hai :)
It's situated in the ground floor of my office, so visiting it is hassles-free. The ambience is good with some English numbers always playing in the background. The staff greeted me with a Good Morning. He even suggested me some new varieties of pastry and offered me a seat.
Just AWESOME pastries - one of the best in town. Tried their "Chocolate pyramid" (Rs. 108) today which was finger-licking yum. A couple of days back - had tried their "Eggless Chocolate Truffle" (Rs. 132) - which was nice - but was hard (which is quite understandable as it is eggless!)
The place is spacious, perhaps can accommodate some 25-odd people.
Only limitation is the very high prices - which might restrict your frequent visits to this place. Nevertheless, this place is quite popular amongst foodies.

They can consider corporate tie-ups with companies in the locality, which can be beneficial for them as well as the customers. Thanks !!

Us crowd of friends were feeling hungry after a long Model United Nations session, so we decided to venture out and experiment on new places to eat, and since I've heard about Paris Cafe a lot, we decided to eat there. The ambience is to die for, with the chairs with dried paint and cushions with Paris imprinted on it. The chandelier hung above and chefs cooked beside us. I ordered the mushroom crepe with shrimp and a red velvet cupcake. Both were top-notch, especially the crepe. Friends ordered panko-fried chicken burger, the spaghetti Aglio Olio , Oreo shake and a corn crepe. I tasted all, and can i just bow down and say *with tears in my eyes* 'lovely'. Now coming to the cons. It's situated at a very inconvenient place at sector five, resulting in a ten minute ask-people session. The washroom is very far away from the Cafe itself and it is way overpriced. But, other than that, you're doing a great job.

A quaint little place tucked in the corner of a large complex in Saltlake's IT hub (sector 5). We went there on a weekday night and found the ambience to be slightly confused. Modern marble flooring (same as the rest of the building) and lots of glass walls didn't gel very well with the otherwise cozy furniture and open air kitchen counter. The menu is small but diverse and charming, covering all courses and several cuisines. However, any misgivings vanished with the food itself, which was really top notch. We ordered the mushroom quesadillas, spicy baked mexican potato jackets and the chicken stroganoff and each dish was brimming with flavour. Just desserts and prompt friendly service give this place a strong finish. I would strongly recommend if you're craving good food above all else

Just opposite to my office. What could be a better place to go out for lunch.

Saw the 4.1 rating on Zomato and felt it's overrated considering the service and food. Surprised to see flies inside, a pest-o-flash was kept next to the entrance but was in switched off condition.

Portion size is too small. I ordered for a Cheese ball appetizer and chicken paprika as the main course.

The parsley sprig used to garnish was not washed well as it had dirt/mud

Exhaust wasn't working well as I could see the staff coughing due to the tempering in oil, I too felt the irritation in my throat after couple of mins. Though staff was polite and courteous, such experiences are disheartening.

Then came the chicken paprika, this time the parsley was well washed. Though the dish tasted good, it wasn't close to the description in menu. It was bit hot due to seasoning with crushed black pepper. It was shredded chicken with bell peppers and mushroom in a tomato basil concasse seasoned with crushed black pepper.

Cannot say if I will recommend this place.

A lovely place for a quiet evening coffee :) Beautiful decor, soothing lights accompanied by soft music. We ordered a cup of Caramel Hot Chocolate, a watermelon cooler and cheese garlic toast to go with. The hot chocolate was great, comes with a tiny chocolate spoon too. It was not that hot though. The watermelon cooler was okayish. The garlic bread was great, perfectly done with an awesome molten cheese filling. The waiter suggested us to go with Ginger Glazed Chicken wings next. After being used to having Barbeque Chicken wings at most of the places, this was a pleasant change of taste. Leaves a nice after taste of ginger. 
The place is appropriately priced. The staff was polite and helpful. Would love to try their main course someday.
P.S. - They don't charge any service tax, so technically you don't pay anything for the service unless you like it.

Nice evening eatery. Coffee was not amongst the best I had in the city. The cheese balls and garlic fries were good. The chicken wings were too spicy and tough for anyones liking. Its a sin not to provide some sort of bread with the main course. So ordered garlic bread sides with stuffed chicken, chicken stroganoff,  prawn cocktail, chicken tetrazzini and chicken n mushroom crepe. All the dishes were above the average quality except for the crepe. Had high hopes but it was too sweet and too thick for my liking. Now for deserts. Red velvet cheese cake was too sweet and the lump of cream cheese in the middle was too much for the palate. The truffle pyramid was better but the cream was too dry. Overall was nice experience. Definitely recommend to try out once if you are bored of your IT job.

Was out on a Sunday evening with my family and looking for a place where we can have continental food. We decided to visit Paris cafe in salt lake. Although its a bit inside the lane, still it can be located easily. Really loved the place. We ordered mushroom crepe which was quite good. Corn and spinach canilloni was quite cheesy thus my kids loved it. My husband is fond of thai curry so he ordered one for himself which he liked it (though the quantity served wasn't enough). We ordered green mango mojito, which was a disappointment and wasn't worth the money. The drink had lemon seeds and was filled with big pieces of raw mango. Overall a good hangout to have continental food minus the drinks.
One more thing to add...we reached there at 9 and they asked to order at one go as the kitchen was getting close. Too early to close on a Sunday evening...!!!

Coming back home after a while makes it all the more important to visit restaurants and cafes that have opened recently. The Paris Cafe at Sector 5 is nothing close to the small cozy one at Ballygunge. It is bigger, better and grandeur with an extensive and interesting menu at a good price. My friend and me were moderately hungry but sufficiently greedy, placing a long list of orders - grilled chicken sandwich, garlic fries with dip, caramel cappuccino and an 'all dreams come true' rainbow pastry. 
The sandwich was like any other, true to a grilled sandwich, but nothing to rave about. The garlic fries are an interesting take on plain french fries with a tinge of garlic and spiciness. The coffee was simple and good. The showstopper of the day was the rainbow pastry - impeccably soft, spongy and literally perfect. The place definitely adds a lot more classiness and life to the mundane Sector 5.

I have been to this particular outlet numerous times, as its very close to my office. Undoubtedly this place has become one of my favourites!
They have some yummy continental dishes to offer as part of their menu. I have tasted their Chicken Steak, Aglio Olio Pasta, Lemon Coriander Fish, and crepes and all of them are just too tasty!
The only thing that dissapointed me was their Orange Cilantro Prawn preparation. With just 5 tiny prawns and an orange flavoured sauce on them, I found the dish to be too expensive and not that up to the mark.
Barring that Paria cafe is the best in all other things they have to offer, starting from their Earl Grey tea to their chocolate crepes.
Also I should specially mention the decor of the place. It very pretty! Starting from the golden cages to the napkin holders, everything is pretty!
I highly recommend this place! :)

I went to this outlet after several recommendations from many of my friends. I had decided to go for a light meal. Ordered salad for the first time in my life.
Have to admit it was delicious though.¬†P.S- Still doesn't make me a fan of lettuce.Well the salad raised the bar so high that I went for Prawn cocktail, Chicken steak,Pouliat poulet,Red Thai Curry. Trust me each item was of utmost perfection.Next I ended my brief food fiesta with a mojito and red velvet cupcake.I love the service and the place.More than anything I love those cute little heart shaped spoons :)

The place seemed a little unassuming when we visited it on a Sunday night. However we were pleasantly surprised by the food! We ordered corn toast, garlic fries with dip along with pasta and each dish was delicious. I would certainly recommend this place for a bit of food and adda.

A little part of Paris in the Kolkata. 
Visited the cafe on a hot summer day, the definitely the ambience was soothing.

We ordered some pancakes and sandwiches along with the summer refershers. The presentation was nice, taste wise liked the food. Friendly staff.. it is a nice place to chill along with a book or friends.

Visited Paris Cafe for the first time today. Was on my wishlist for a long time after hearing all the great reviews. And trust me the place didn't disappoint me one bit.

The decor and the ambience was outstanding.
The taste of music was nice too which added on to a great experience. The staff was very warm and friendly. So basically the place won me over before our order was served.

We ordered the mozzarella cheese tomato sandwich, spaghetti pasta with cheese sauce, nutella crepes and mojito. Every thing starting from my mojito to the nutella crepes was perfect. The sandwich was served with 2 types of sauces which tasted exotic and enhanced the flavour of the sandwich. The spaghetti pasta was the best of the lot. The flavours were well added and the cheese sauce went well with it. Nutella crepes didn't only look heavenly but tasted heavenly too. The presentation of the dishes made it more tempting.

Overall it was a wonderful experience. Great food, wonderful staff and the pricing was very reasonable too. One of the cosiest places in Kolkata by far. I would give it 4.5 stars just because I couldn't taste the pan cakes as it was out of stock.

Attempted an online order through Zomato, spent a while figuring out why everything has options divided into veg and nonveg (you can't order something with, for example, broccoli *and* chicken), and the complete lack of descriptions on everything. Then had the order rejected. Then called and placed the same order on the phone (they suddenly had a 1k minimum instead of the 300 minimum listed here), then had that order canceled as well because "they're too busy to take a delivery order now".¬†Why triple your delivery minimum and take an order and my location in the first place if you're too busy to take a delivery order?It'd be nice if restaurants bothered training their staff to be at least vaguely professional about delivery orders before suddenly deciding to offer home deliveries. I will gladly drive 30 minutes to 8th Day rather than 5 minutes to Paris Cafe after this (lack of) experience.

Friday night is always a party time for me....i usually prefer drinks but this time i thought lets try this cafe....Have heard and seen a lot of pictures of the famous red velvet cheese cake.Indeed my reviews matched with my friends'.It was heaven,fabulous,tasty and ofcourse beautiful.
Next I tried stuffed mushroom...it was good but not as much as the cake.And last but not the least chicken tetrazini my all time favourite.It was also quite good.
The ambience was calm and composed neither too much of rush nor empty tables.The decor was good....felt for a minute we are in paris ......hahahaha.
Overall a good experience....red velvet cup cakes are my nxt target.

The thing I liked the most was the ambience and to be true the quality of food was also good. Then again I didn't like the green apple mojito but the chicken tetrazzini was very good...
The desert took my attention it was a special menu they served very very good in having and the garnishing was awesome...

The beautiful Parisian bistro.... With glass wall, high ceiling and ivory furniture... It is a piece of Paris in Sector V, Salt Lake City, Calcutta... Loved the idea to hang white bird cages illuminated by little fairy lights.... The food is great too.... We tried Chicken stuffed with mushroom and cheese.... Sou vied and then grilled to perfection served with a lovely sauce and creamy mashed potatoes. The Grilled Chicken breast was a little dry but delicious enough! To wash the scrumptious food down the delicious watermelon freezer and green mango mojito are perfect partners... Although the amount of mint in the mojito was a little too much. The dessert consisted of the legendary rainbow cake slice and red velvet cheese cake.... Yum!!!!
Pocket pinch Moderate :1100/- for two is sufficient to satisfy even the gluttony of yours truly!
The location is a little off the beaten path... But it is worth a try!

Have been hearing shining reviews of this place for quite some time. Hence, decided to drop by at the Paris Caf√©. This is located right in the heart of Sector 5, SaltLake. A 2 minute drive from the College More, this caf√© is in the Ground floor of the South City Pinnacle building. Since it was Saturday evening, Sector 5 was a discreet, peaceful abode, and parking was a non-issue. 

On entering the premises of the SCP Campus, you get a good view of the caf√©, courtesy the ceiling high wall fa√ßade on all 3 sides. There is an attractive sign board receiving you, and the exteriors look simplistic and sober. The interiors are done just ok, nothing over the edge, and there is a great scope of improvement in the room of d√©cor. The ceiling is really, really high, and this is a prime reason, this 20-ish something seater caf√© looks gigantic. The furniture is an antique European clich√© themed, with white Victorian unfinished-wood tables and chairs. There are cute purple pillows on the chairs, with the words Paris written on them. There was a central wood and brass chandelier, and another couple of bird-cage styled ceiling hangings, which gave a nice vibe to the place. The kitchen section is inside the main cafe, but is just separated by the eating area by a frosted glass wall.

On having a seat, I realized that it‚Äôs quite warm and probably the central AC is so high, it‚Äôs not being able to cool the entire place. On enquiring, I found out that the central AC is not working at all, and there is a mammoth Daikin Tower AC in one corner, which is trying to, but in vain, cool the entire caf√©. Reluctantly, we had to move to a table closer to the AC, and proceeded to order.

The menu is great, and it gives some fine, new options in terms of food, not typically a caf√© menu, this place can give a few continental restaurants a run for their money in terms of spread. There is a breakfast menu with extensive options in eggs and toasts. We ordered a Panco-Burger de Poulet Frit, an Espresso, a Darjeeling tea and Chicken Paprika.

The tea and coffees were nice, and were served with little tea-time cakes, which were lovely. The Burger was great, came with fries, and the chicken patty deep-fried to perfection, with a lovely Japanese Pankon aroma, so different from your regular McD Burgers. Then arrived the Chicken Paprika, which was served with Steamed rice. The Basil/Bell pepper/Hot Paprika combo was working fine, but in the downside, the salt was very very less, and we had to add quite a handful of table-salt to suit our palate. After finishing it off, we ordered a Chocolate √©clairs, which was just OK. 

Overall, it was a good experience regarding the food, and I was more or less satisfied. This place is supposed to do good business in future hopefully, having a good influx of regular office going customer base throughout the week. They just need to pep up, work their minds on some innovative d√©cor, theme styled lighting and interiors, and they would surely be one of the most sought after places in Sector 5. And yes, we need more options, like 10 times more options in Desserts. We are sweet-toothed people. And please fix up the AC thingy. It‚Äôs disturbing.

While it may not look like much, Paris Cafe does serve excellent Italian food. Waiters were polite and service was fast. I had the spaghetti with tomato sauce topped with mushrooms and chicken. It was exceptionally good. Appetizers and beverages were great too. Ambience of the restaurant was pleasant as well. I recommend trying any of the pasta/spaghetti dishes.

I have already been to and loved the Paris caf√© outlet near Beckbagan ‚Ä¶ and was planning to visit the sector 5 counterpart as they also had non-vegetarian options . Well as was expected they sure did not disappoint with the charm of their d√©cor and one is bound to fall in love the moment you step in. Coffee and food though good was not whoa and I found the closing time a little inconvenient and we had to rush through our food as they were closing at 9 ! Overall an average experience .

A  great place in the hub.. But you need to find it. it's in a Lane.  The ambience and the food is quite good.  The cost might be on the higher side but it's worth it,  especially if you're with someone. Must try..  the mushroom crepe and the prawn cocktail.

I have been hearing about this place quite a few times from classmates, who were bowled over by the food. So I decided to give a birthday treat to my friends at this joint.
We all went there at around 5:45 pm. The place was moderately filled up that time. We sat at a table tucked in a corner, beside the air conditioner. Menus were handed over immediately.
After some pondering, we went for two plates of chicken steak, two chicken tetrazzinis, and one plate of pouliat poulet.
The food took some time in arriving, but that did not bother us. While talking excitedly, we looked around and admired the d√©cor as well.
The chicken steak consisted of two big chicken breast fillets, with mashed potatoes and some vegetables. The steak was soft and flavorsome. The mashed potatoes was one of the best mash I have ever tasted. The sauce which was poured on top of the chicken enhanced the flavor greatly.
The chicken Tetrazzini was delicious. There were huge chunks of chicken with the cheesy creamy spaghetti. The garlic bread added a nice touch.
The pouliat poulet consisted of a huge fillet of chicken which was stuffed with mushrooms and cheese. Mashed potatoes were also provided. The chicken along with mushrooms were succulent and delicious.
An assortment of condiments were provided, among which my favorite one was the tabasco sauce. I added a little to my chicken for a nice spicy kick.
After that sumptuous meal, we ordered three red velvet cheesecakes and two chocolate fudge cakes. The chocolate fudge cakes were served warm. The chocolate used was dark and of good quality. The red velvet cake was quite delicious, although a tad too creamy for my palate.
The total bill came up to be 2235 rupees.
Paris cafe is a nice place to spend some quiet quality time with friends and family. Although the food is slightly expensive, the taste, quality and quantity make up for it. I would love to visit again and again.

Great place to eat some good food. Have been there a couple of times and would say that both of these experiences were very good. Prices are a little on the higher side but maybe goes with the food taste and details that are there on the menu. Had ordered chicken steak and stuffed chicken and would like to try other dishes as well. Would love to visit again.

Food was overall good specially the fish preparation but need to better the stroganoff which has less quantity and also not exactly what u get in other places

Neatly done up and has friendly staff and can surely attract more clients ahead.

Today I visited this place with one of my friend for breakfast.
Ambience : The place is good in terms of decor.
Staff: They all were chatting on the tables, as if they were not ready for a customer at 10.50 am
Service: I was not able to have any thing as they said Bread-is-finished/yet-to-arrive. They asked me to have pasta or other dishes from their main course menu. They insisted that they are not ready for breakfast as bread has not arrived and will take more than one hour to come.¬†
I am highly dissapointed as I had never expected this at Paris Cafe.

Love this outlet for its amazing ambiance and is definitely one of the best cafes to chill over some coffee and conversations in my opinion !!

Located in sector v , the place is very spacious and comfortable. The decor is very nice and sublet with high ceilings that make you all the more at ease. The staff are warm and polite. The choice of music is pretty nice too.

The menu has good options and is reasonable priced except for the pastries which seem bit costly to me. The coffee are pretty well made. Love their red velvet cup cake, rainbow pastry. Red velvet cheese cake sells like crazy but I don't like it. Sandwiches are decent and available in combos with coffee. 

Overall a great place to chill out !!

If you're looking for a nice little getaway from the din of Kolkata, to a beautiful Parisian fairytale, this cafe should definitely be on your list. 
The decor, with lovely European chairs and tables, exquisite mirror stands and dainty silverware, is one of Kolkata's best. Once you've absorbed in the awesomeness of the decor, the sweet aroma of freshly baked cakes and macarons strike you. 
The most delicious item on the menu - rainbow cake. It tastes as good as it looks. 

A taste of Paris in the City of Joy :)

As if the very idea of desserts wasn't enough for all the Happy Hormones, that they had to come up with such a pretty French themed outlet combined with bird cages & high hanging chandelier. The Macaroons & Red Velvet were as good as it gets. But what stole the show was the seven layered rainbow pastry. In all, this place spells Elegance.

It wasn't easy deciding on where to go when I'm with my bae, but as soon as we decided upon Paris Cafe, we quickly figured out a way to reach the lovely abode. As good as it gets, glass walls makes me feel "I'm entering into something heartwarming" & I would be lying, if I say I did not enjoy the ambience inside. From the chandeliers, to the vintage mirror adorned walls, to a rusty feel of wood with old school chairs with cute rectangle shaped cushions perfect for your slightly aching back after driving right/left in the by lanes of sector V & to the calmness inside the cafe. Such places takes you to a high and you feel coming back to it again. Alright let's jump to the food. We ordered for caramel hot chocolate, oreo shake, cheese omelette with a slice of bread & garlic potato fries. I loved the caramel hot chocolate & oreo shake was so yum. Garlic potato fries with two dips; surprise package, was really good. Guess, I have to give the trophy to the cheese omelette with a slice of bread. Cheese omelette never tasted better, I bet. As someone said "when you're on a date, make it count"

P. S. You can view the image attached. First in my review too. Highly recommended, hell yeah.

The food here is elegant , to say the least. best pasta i hav ever had. the mushrooms and chickens were sliced with perfection and you could make out the perfect thcikness of the penne pasta. well done chef !
and the cakes. cupcaks are so so but try the red velvet sliced cake. amazing ! 
the pocket pinch is high but considering the quality and  ambience, it pretty much is reasonable.

A nice place to hangout. A place where you get the good quality cakes and pastries. Ordered many pastries out of which I found the "red velvet cheese cake" the best. "Dream come true" was ok. After a round of pastries we ordered main course- pasta,prawn cocktail,chicken steak,red thai curry. Chicken steak served with mashed potatoes and green vegetables tasted awesome.
Overall the food was good but it was quite expensive. The whole food and pastries together cost us 3000.

I decided to visit this place after reading the reviews. It is a good place to hang out. It was easy to locate once you are in the lane since it has a prominent entrance. We had grilled chicken sandwich, cold coffee and lemon ice tea. Was surprised to see tartare sauce served with the sw but didn't mind since it was well prepared. Only negative was the ac esp next to the glass facade. Rest was good

Came here last week after hearing great reviews about this place. And the experience was pretty pleasing too. Here is what was ordered:

Ginger-glazed chicken wings: Well seasoned and perfectly cooked. A good choice for all spicy foodies.

Mojito &¬†Lemon Ice Tea: They were what I expected them to be... tasted like the ones I can find in almost any restaurant these days. Quite ordinary... nothing special.

Chicken Steak: This one was something I was looking forward to the most. And it didn't disappoint a bit. Two huge chicken breasts... what else to ask for? While the chicken could have been just a little more tender, every tiny blemish was covered up by the heavenly mash. Seriously couldn't get enough of it! THE BEST MASH I've ever had...

Fish Steak: I never had couscous before... and its taste was a pleasant surprise! The fish was well cooked and the gravy sauce perfectly complemented the entire platter. Barring the scanty amount of the couscous, it's quite a decent dish as a main course...

Red velvet cupcakes: I'll be honest! I've had better red velvet cupcakes in Kolkata. Tasted delicious nonetheless, but was missing the melt-in-the-mouth feeling.

I've felt that there are 3 things Paris Cafe should immediately work on ---

1. More items in the menu please...
2. The Air Conditioning does not reach the glass wall side.
3. Rainbow Cake is the magnet that pulls majority of people here. They should always have it in stock.

Delicious food, lovely decor (the chandelier and the bird-cage styled ceiling hangings deserve a special mention), beautiful golden lighting, soft music and prompt service - this is what I would say if I had to describe Paris Cafe in a few words. ¬†

If you are someone like me whose idea of a perfect Saturday evening is a quiet, peaceful ambience and a cup of coffee with your buddies, then this is the perfect place to be.¬†
Talking about coffee, Paris Cafe serves damn good coffee.¬†

As far as the food is concerned, these are the things that I tried:¬†
Mushroom Crepe - This is a dish worthy of being a Paris Cafe Favourite and a must have for mushroom lovers like me. It looks extra cheesy and that made me nervous because I don't like biting into something and then feeling like there is a block of cheese moving in my mouth. But all my nervousness went out the window because it tasted so damn good. Basically, this was comfort food at its best.¬†

Vegetable Tetrazinni - Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!¬†
Cheese Sauce Pasta - It was nice. Nothing great about it.¬†
Oreo Shake - yummy

Bon Bon Shake - worth a try if you LOVE Alpenliebe. I am not an Alpenliebe fan so I didn't like it.¬†
Rainbow Pastry - So many colours, so many flavours, tasted so soft, creamy and fresh. Loved it.
Red Velvet cupcake - Two thumbs up for this one. And so cutely decorated it's adorable.¬†

So Dear Paris Cafe (if you are reading my review),
you are doing great. But please provide more options in desserts.

Was very excited when I heard the name of the Caf√©, specially having worked in French restaurants of Oberoi Hotels as the Chef and creating Calcutta's first true European restaurant Seville's (now Jong's) inside Zaranj. Have returned to Kolkata after a long time and was very exited after reading the opening of the Salt Lake chapter as the menu is a bit elaborate compared to the old one.The name Paris Caf√© creates a different impulse that what¬†are there in the menu. I think the owners require professional help to make it a fantastic product as the menu does not give a Paris Bistro menu. It would not attract well travelled people after one visit if he/she has not seen the menu earlier.Would still be visiting.... every effort deserves a try. God bless you all.

I am gravely disappointed because this happened to be one of my favourite cafes in town. I particularly love the other outlet at Ballygunge and when this was finally launched, I really wanted to give this a try given my previous experience.

Ambience is pretty and well lit. Locating it can be a little difficult, use gps if needed.

So, today evening my friend and I decided to hit this place and enjoy a gastronomic meal. Sadly, I cannot call it a gastronomic meal given the first hand experience.

The order was :

Bon Bon Shake and Snicker Shake

Ginger glazed chicken wings

Mushroom Quesadilla

Chicken Paprika

Pizza Sticks

Cilantro chilli vegetables

Red velvet cheesecake slice

Macaroons (Rose and Chocolate)

Earl Grey and Lemon Iced tea

To begin with, the shakes were not up to the mark at all. The start of the meal was disastrous. For the BonBon Shake, since I had it, it was too bitter for my liking. I did not even feel like having it anymore after a few sips.

Funnily enough, they served the desserts almost at the beginning of the meal which I found very unprofessional. Shows that the staff lacks common sense or should I say basic hospitality training.

Up followed the ginger glazed chicken which a delight on my part. Beautifully glazed , well cooked chicken, marinated pretty well. This made me happy after the bitter start. Sadly, for my friend who is a vegetarian his pizza sticks could barely keep him happy but he did not complain much so I guess it was fine. Next followed the mushroom quesadilla. Here, I would beg to differ from my fellow mate. I quite liked the quesadilla though it was prepared with extreme nonchalance. The stuffing was fine, passable enough. I like mushrooms hence this was a good thing sitting on my plate. Wish the stuffing also had sweetcorn. They would add an amazing zing.

Next came the two main courses I guess. Namely, Paprika chicken and Cilantro chilli vegetables. Both of these dishes were served with rice.

The biggest disappointment of the evening was sitting proudly on our table. I cannot comment about the chilli vegetable but the paprika chicken was overloaded with tomato puree and tasted so tangy. My taste buds were inflicted numb. No taste other than sour and tangy tomatoes. It was very bland. I took two spoonfuls and let it be. Surprisingly, my friend did the same so I guess his was the same feeling too.

Now, we shifted our attention to the macaroons and the red velvet cheesecake. I can vouch and tell that the best item on the dessert menu is the red velvet cheesecake. It was bliss after that horrific experience. But the macaroons brought back depression again. They were not baked properly. It was slightly soggy and there was hardly any taste. I got really upset with it.

To wash down everything, we got an earl grey for my friend and a lemon iced tea for me.

I could survive through it, my friend could not sadly.

The bill mounted to a whooping INR 1900/- and It was not worth it.

Disappointed.

Cheers though.

With lots of hope and expecting taste buds two of us went to this 2nd Paris Cafe today evening. The place is not very difficult to find, but its a lil inside a lane, if you don't have a personal ride on the way back you have to take a 3 minute walk out of the lane, which is deserted on Sundays.
Now, We found the place went it and it was comfy and cosy, seating was decent but small and the staff were responsive, we were hungry we ordered quite a ala carte

First was the shakes, Snickers and Bon Bon, none of us could even finish the half as it as too bitter, then they served the Maccron before the main course which we decided to eat last. Now came Chicken Wings ordered by my freind which she marked up as okayish, i being a veg ordered for pizza sticks, which were served right baked, but too tangy to be happy for. Then next was mushroom quisidilla, which looked so stale that i didnt even wanted to even taste, but i was being forced to have it, all i felt was the cheese, no mushrooms were recognized by my buds, and it was very badly prepared, even my friend could taste more of it, then came the final dish for the evening for her Chicken Paprika which she tasted and had a frowning face to carry on and I ordered a Cilantro Chilly vegetable ( I was being told its very spicy) it came, i tasted and waited for 5 mins thinking what was it, i couldn't lift another portion of it, asked my friend to taste it, she was disgusted as well. We were off mood, luckily we ordered Red Velvet Cheese Slice which i liked and we tried to finish, this was really good. I was all pissed and finally i decided to sip to something as we both have already wasted too much of worthless food for which we were paying, and the staff taunted me sir you could finish the dish, "I TOLD YOU it would BE TOO SPICY" I laughed and told him it was tasteless and he left. We ordered finally an earl grey tea for me and a lemon ice tea for her. To my suprise, they offered me a cheaper earl grey tea of tetley at Paris Cafe and my friend had 3 sips of lemon ice tea which tasted like a lemonade too tangy and sour. We decided to check out and I decided to not to revisit under any case. It sliced my Wallet of Rs. 1900 which would have really not mattered if any of us would have liked the food. And the best part in a French speciality cafe the music genre was rock and pop. I really would call it a no go. I am attaching pics for the leftovers so you can understand, what disaster it was. Oh i missed macroon, we ordered Rose and Chocolate, neither of them had the flavour it was like we just had a sugar candy.

Being a tea enthusiast, found the options quite interesting. It is walking distance from my office and had a chat with colleague over tea. The server was humble enough to apologise for the variant we wanted not being there but we finally settled for rose. The chai pe Charcha was effective and i am sure it will be crowded soon. I have my doubts whether scalability has been factored in it not. Once or twice if a customer returns, that's it.

Go here for the cake, okay? In particular, the rainbow and red velvet cakes. I went there with one of my friends to catch up on an evening, but we must have overstayed our welcome because the management kept trying to (subtly) shoo us out from 8.30pm or so. To be fair, we were the only customers left at that point. The cake was amazing though. I'm going back for the cake.

This place serves some good quality food with great taste. I comw hwre frequently.  Love all their dishes. Stuffed mushroom, spinach and ricotta cheese canneloni, club sandwich, mushroom crepe, crispy veg burger, pancakes with chocolate sauce. I tried mojito, cafe latte and caramel hot chocolate. I think, nothing here is bad. The food simply tastes amazing. Desserts are sinful. We had red velvet cheesecake, macaroons and rainbow cake. For the service, it was fast and humble. The staff is friendly. The interior looks pretty in pink hues. Surely a place that need frequent visits.

I love this branch much more than the Ballygunge one. It is bigger and has a better ambience. We ordered a Kit Kat Shake. It was average and nothing extraordinary. The cannelloni is mouth-watering and super cheesy. The nutella cr√™pe is so good too. We couldn't get enough of it. 
Coming to their pastries, we ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Rainbow cake. The red velvet cheesecake is truly one of the best pastries I have tasted. There's nothing to complain. 
The staff is courteous and so accommodating.

My first order here was a takeaway. Dying to try out there crepe.
I got chocolate pancakes and mushroom crepe.
The crepe was in an amazing cheesy sauce and the mushrooms inside complimenting it so well. Very delicious. I would definitely have it again!
(But there are soany other things to try!)

The chocolate pancakes on the other hand.. The sauce was okay. The pancakes were a bit hard. Not the best I have had.

Next visit would be soon and I would love to try out more stuff.

Overall I had a good meal. But expected more.(from the pancakes)
Mushroom crepe was just lovely
....

Next visit

Decor is amazing
Service is okayish. The waiters are not very attentive.

Tried a chocolate and snickers shake. Money waste!! Very unexpected. But too sweet. No classy chocolate taste. Not even very thick. Big flop the shakes..

Mushroom crepe again was heavenly!

Chilli garlic fries were very spicy. It helped down the over sweet shake. Must try if you love masala!

Ordered a watermelon freezer... Again a big spoiler. If i am paying 100,bucks for a glass of juice. I would expect the seeds to be removed before its made atleast!!

No more drinks there! The 30rs street juices are much better

Rainbow pastry.. As we see it. Very delicious. It was so light!! Just melted in my mouth. A very good dessert. It saved the day!!

There was a bill goof up. Which was sorted out in minutes.

Need a LOT of improvement. Sector 5 needs a posh and classy place. This just isn't there yet. Sadly the decor isn't enough!!

As always, I would like to begin with my usual disclaimer that as we are vegetarians, so is our review.¬†I finally had the chance to visit the Paris Cafe in Sector 5, Salt Lake. The Cafe is in the ground floor of an IT office and is surrounded by an odd combination of concrete and greenery. The Cafe itself is pretty [considering its in an IT office building] with wooden chairs and and embroidered cushions. The only unpleasant factor was upon entering the Cafe you are subjected to a smorgasboard of smells, due to an effective ventilation system. I was subjected to a strong and unpleasant smell of fish. They should take steps to rectify this problem as the smell of other food items, especially fish, can hamper your dining experience and make the food that you are eating smell the same.We ordered a serving of Garlic French Fries with "dips" (even though we got just one dip), a mushroom crepe and a spinach and ricotta cheese cannelloni. The french fries were overcooked and were extra crispy (I personally do not like that), the mushroom crepe was very good (served with a side of fresh mustard, made for an interesting combination), the cannelloni, however, was a disappointment. While it said on the menu that it would be a spinach and ricotta cheese filling, it was mainly comprised of tomatoes and very little cheese and spinach. I would call that misrepresentation.¬†We ordered a cold coffee as well, having heard a lot about their shakes and desserts. The coffee was average, nothing special.¬†Overall, I was disappointed having gone their with high expectations. Then again maybe it was because I ordered vegetarian and most restaurants in India do not serve good vegetarian food. I doubt if I will visit again.

Wonderful ambience, awesome food. The chicken tetrazini and garlic fries is particularly good and is a must have. We ordered elaichi tea and it arrived with little biscuits which were amazing. Dont miss out on the red velvet pastry and wash it down with some lemon flavored iced tea. The service was excellent.

located at ground floor of south city pinnacle, definitely three times larger than its ballygunge counterpart, with high ceilings and parisian setting,  however the decor(quite dull) failed to impress us much..a little more of bronze shades, mirrors and chandeliers would have made it perfect and gorgeous. Thumbs up for the music played. For the food we ordered,
GINGER GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS (5 wings) were tangy and tasty,  CHICKEN TETRAZZINI was a breast of chicken with spagetti in thick creamy white sauce and baked was super delicious. 
CHICKEN STEAK was very fiiling with two sizeable breast fillet, sauteed veggies and perfectly smooth mashed potato. Both the dishes are recommended. 
However the downside was the only fish item we ordered, CITRON CORIANDER FISH.. looks can be deceptive!!  the fish was too smelly and definitely not bhetki.. the cous cous was plain bad. Beware of ordering fish here.
The RAINBOW cake was moist definitely one of the best looking dessert we had. must try!
p. s.  they dont serve water untill you ask for.

Expected a lot from this cafe and it did fulfill our expectations in most areas. The only thing I didn't like was the ambiance. It was nothing special and the background songs were a bit boring too, although, some might like that. But, the food was delicious. The quantity was bit on lesser side for 2 people but after tasting it, one can ignore that, and it wasn't much expensive too.

We happened to come across this nice joint located inside South City Pinnacle. The decor and the furnishings very much resemble a Parisian cafe. Very high ceilings, candle stands, etc. 

We ordered the prawn cocktail, which was kind of okay. The mojitos were really nice but the hit item was the crepes. Photos included. 

Overall not bad. Nothing great too. 
I would recommend a better exhaust system as the smoke spreads inside the hall causing a bit of suffocation.

I went there thinking its just average. So at first they served me an oreo shake which was bad. On my request the drink was changed to a watermelon freezer which was just fine. Then I ordered for stuffed chicken which was pretty good. The chicken was a little hard though but that's okay. Then I ordered for desserts which were really nice. The red velvet cup cake and the nutella crepe was good. The macaroon was just average. The place was a little stinky. However, the height of the ceiling and the glass exterior gives a nice feel. So pretty decent place at a decent price.

Beautiful ambience. The decoration is amazing,perfect for a date or a meet up with a friend.Food: AMAZING. We tried the masala tea,mocha,hot chocolate and the cold coffee for drinks.Their mocha is one of the best in the city.Appetisers: We Pancakes with maple sauce (yum!) chicken caesar salad (not recommended,really few pieces of chicken and not filling),Citron Coriander fish ( 2 beautiful pieces of well cooked fish accompanied by a nice rice preparation to compliment the fish, fresh and appetizing,highly recommended),Chicken Steak (my first steak and a beautiful one :') ),Chicken Pepite ( five marvellous pieces of¬†¬†fried chicken with two sauces: a must try), THE MUSHROOM CREPE was PERFECT! <3Desserts: I tried the famous "Rainbow" cake, (a really big slice,enough for two and its 130 only), Red velvet cake (need I say more?) and their eclair is the best I've tried yet. Didn't like the macaroons much though.Pocket pinch: yeah,a bit costly. Their desserts are mostly within 150...but their main course dishes are around 200 to 300 each. 1000 would be more than enough for two including a drink,one veg and non veg item and a dessert. Bon Appetit :D

Recently had a chance to visit this place which is situated at the ground floor of South City pinnacle. Business lunch it was, so the food as well as the time spent was fast and furious. The grilled chicken sandwich is a beast and would rank very high in comparison to the other fast food joints. The hot piping cappuccino was good. Will come back again in future.

So I've been here for the first time for a #ZomatoMeetup a couple of weeks back. Was thoroughly impressed with the decor which had fancy furnitures and chandelier.
I reached there a little late when everyone else were already ordering main course so I was served a mixed plate of starters having¬†stuffed mushroom,¬†chicken wings, deep¬†fried prawns and a slice of classic¬†margherita¬†pizza.
I also ordered a brownie shake, which was amazing.
For the main course, I ordered for a fish steak which was recommended to me by Sneha, the owner. The steak was nice. Though the vegetables could have been a lil more tender.¬†
Then came a big plate full of desserts containing¬†Rainbow cake, Red¬†Velvet cake, Tart, Caramel cake, Macaroons.

Though I absolutely love macaroons, the one I longed for in this plate was the Red Velvet cake with layers of white chocolate.
Even after this sugar rush, I ordered one more brownie shake (which proves how amazing it was)!!
Finally before I left, Sneha got us a couple of pastries parcelled which was overwhelming as we already were stuffed with such wonderful food that she treated us with.¬†

Now in my next visit here last weekend, we had Panini, Red Velvet Cheese Cake and /you guessed it right/ Brownie Shake.

This place is Highly Recommended, especially to those like me who has an abnormal sweet tooth. :)

A little away from the main city for those who stay away from Salt Lake, yet worth a visit. Thank you to Zomato reviews on the basis of which we celebrated a friend's birthday here. 
The highlight of the caf√© for a girl gang shall definitely be the rainbow cake.
As compared to the ballygunge outlet, its much bigger and more options on the menu too.

#zomato meetup
 Once i arrived at south city pinnacle, all i got a feeling was of a typical european open caf√©. What made my day was the warm and welcoming smile of the zomato team. Then ofcourse sneha and the warm smile and all the foodies around made the whole ambience so good. Then of course came in the zomato menu. Sneha introduced herself as the owner of the caf√© and the chef herself who specialises in french desserts. It gave me such homely vibes. Loved the decor, the mirror patch at w corner. The amazing chandelier, the amazing western classics being played stole my heart. Mocktails were served immendiately as soon as we sat down peacefully.  I opted for the mojito and it was amazing. Also I did try the hot irish coffee. I dont know if a layer of wine was there or not, but the irish coffee served with cupcakes,  just made the difference.  Starters were mix and match. It was- 
1. Stuffed mushroom which was amazing
2. Mushroom quesidilla
3. Ginger glazed chicken wings
4. Crumb fried prawns
The crumb fried prawns served was amazing. The quest was authentic. It was tasty and amazingly creamy.  Highly recommended. 
For the main course , I ordered for a fish steak. I heard it was their newest introduction. The mashed potato was tasty, the steak tastier, only thing was that the fish could have been a bit more tender. Then came in the dessert section.
A sampler was given to us containing
1. Rainbow cake
2. Velvet cake
3. Lemon curd tart
4. Chocolate caramel slice
5.Chocolate macaroon
6. Chocolate fudge
I do not know what to recommend amongst these as all of these are equally tasty and highly recommended. If you just want to drop into paris cafe, the desserts are a must try. The red velvet cake is authentically french and is beautifully made. The macaroons taste amazing and were better as never. A special mention about the rainbow cake. Lok
Looks yumm , tastes yummier !What made us happier was that sneha made it a point to get pastries parcelled for our homes. It was such loving and sweet gesture. Paris cafe is unbelievably warm and welcoming.  The food served here, is amazing. And ofcourse the desserts are a special mention. Hope to taste more such innovative dishes soon.
Dropping in soon!

The two of us were quite happy to see the menu at Paris Cafe, and wanted to eat something heavy (had a long day ahead of us), so ended up ordering the jacket potatoes, an eclair, a chocolate caramel pastry, hot dog, and chicken steak. Also, yes, my favorite vice - Latte.¬†

We got our desserts first - the eclair was nice, but the chocolate caramel pastry, with little butterscotch crunchy bits sandwiched between the layers of cream, was what made me happy. The well-made latte came with complimentary little cakes, which were moist and tasty. The jacket potatoes were stuffed with a tangy filling which was smoothed over by the melted cheese, and my hot dog was nice, if a little ketchup-y (if there's such a word).¬†

The chicken steak was really tasty - moist, tender chicken breasts, a well-made mash, and perfectly cooked vegetables, in a sauce which was savory and meaty. We ordered another round of drinks afterwards, and got the ginger tea, which was decent, and the cappuccino was strong and just the way I liked it.¬†

However, what I did not like was the fact that we had also ordered a macaron to be sent to the table, and they forgot it. Otherwise, the service was pretty nice.

This particular outlet of Paris Cafe was the venue for a Zomato foodie meet up this past saturday.It has been ages since Kolkata actually had a zomato foodie meet.So this one was long overdue and it did not disappoint.

We were offered a set meal and we started off with our choice of shakes or mocktails.The drinks were all refreshing and the presentation was really¬† nice.

For starters,we had ginger glazed chicken wings,stuffed mushrooms,mushroom quesidila and crumb fried prawns.The stuffed mushrooms were excellent.The button mushrooms were succulent and the cheesy stuffing went beautifully.The crumb fried prawns were nicely done and I liked the fact that the prawns were extremely fresh.The ginger glazed chicken wings were a bit different but tasty nonetheless.The quesidila was just a tad underdone I felt.

For main course I had the fish steak for myself and also sampled the chicken steak.I liked the chicken steak more.I felt the sauce was a lot more rich in terms of taste.The sauce of the fish steak was just a little diluted somehow.The mashed potatoes were wonderfully done and the accompanying vegetables were crunchy and fresh.The chicken steak contained two chunks of chicken breast which were both very well cooked.

Now coming to the desserts section,we were offered a wide range of assorted stuff including their signature rainbow cake.The rainbow cake looked beautiful.Honestly however it did not taste as good as it looked but then it looks incredibly stunning.It was okay but a tad too sweet for my liking probably because of all the layers going into the making of it.The red velvet cake was the undoubted start of the show for me.It was to die for! The choco caramel cake was delightful.The macaroons though not the menu were really nice too.All in all the cakes were an absolute treat to the taste buds and also the eyes.

This place located right in the office hub does a great job in terms of ambience and decor also.The attention to detail as evidenced by the choice of cutlery,the lovely chandeliers etc was something that I really liked.The choice of music was again very very tasteful.The space inside is not the biggest but it is more than the Ballygunj branch.The staff were all extremely friendly.

Finally a special word of appreciation for Sneha who runs Paris cafe for her achievements and also for taking such wonderful care of us.

P.S.Thanks to Zomato for arranging this meet and I do hope we have more frequent Zomato meet ups now.

Being a resident of Salt Lake myself, I always felt deprived of good eating outlets in the township and highly jealous of those living in the central areas of the city. Paris Cafe is the best thing that could ever happen to Salt Lake. What's more? They have non vegetarian options unlike their maiden outlet in Ballygunge. I'm a little surprised though as to why this place hasn't been publicized well enough since my instagram check ins led to many questions so definitely guys pump up the promotions and put up signs to locate you for we have google maps but many don't and salt lake as it is confusing a place.
Coming to the food. I've always been a fan of their Rainbow cake slice "dream come true" but have also become a bigger fan of their Red Velvet Cheesecake. Did try their non vegetarian variant of the grilled chicken sandwich and it was an absolute bliss. One thing they could rework on however is their hot chocolate. Although the sponge cake coins served complimentary with it were an absolute delight, the beverage itself was something that can be made at home and not come all the way to a cafe for it. All in all a place definitely on my favourite hangout list. Bonjour :)

An invite by Zomato for #zomatomeetup was a pleasant surprise for all the foodies n the experience was taken to the next level by the brilliant hospitality n yummilicious food by Paris cafe n owner, Sneha. 
We had our special menu set. Started off with Irish coffee n it was blended to perfection. Then came the stuffed mushrooms n mushroom quesidilla which were good considering am a diehard non vegetarian. Ginger glazed chicken wings n crumb fried prawns were to die for. I ordered the spaghetti with mushroom in pesto cheese sauce with diced chicken and the quantity was enough for 2 person n the pesto sauce was of Hyatt level.I ordered a fantastic mojito to make it easier for me to finish the spaghetti all by myself. 
I forgot that a stupendous platter of the signature desserts was awaiting for us.
Red velvet cake, Dream come true (rainbow cake), macaroons, chocolate caramel cake, lemon cheese cake were served to all of us. Red velvet was the second best of the lot following those excellent macaroons! But u must mention the rainbow cake here had the perfect sweetness n softness that was highly appreciable.
What an amazing visit to the cafe, going back soon again with my foodie friends seems like a very good idea now.
Thanks again to Sneha n Zomato.

First of all, my visit to Paris Caf√© was due to Zomato, a token of appreciation inviting me to a foodie meetup.
Upon arriving, the restro was nice and airy with lots and lots of daylight coming in, with long windows.. The interior decoration was nice, and the ambience and background music were the best I've seen.. 

We tried out Mushroom Quesidilla, Stuffed Mushrooms, Ginger Glazed Chicken Wings and Crumb Fried Prawns for starters.. 
The Chicken Wings were average, not great, but not bad, the prawns were tasty, and the dip was great..
The two mushroom preparations were the stand-out ones, even though I prefer non-veg items, the veggie starters were on another level.. I took Watermelon Freezer as a drink, and was pretty smooth, and enjoyed it..
The Irish Coffee was also brilliant, I heard from one of my friends, though I didn't taste it myself..
Moving on to the main course, I had a chicken steak, which was extremely well cooked and prepared, and the presentation was also nicer than some others.. The dish was pretty heavy, they served two big pieces of breast meat.. Enjoyed it thoroughly..
My friend, had ordered fish steak, which she enjoyed greatly, though I found the decoration of fish steak to be a bit flat.. More garnishing could have been there, they served it in a separate plate..

Next, the most anticipated desserts.. Had chocolate caramel slice, red velvet cake and rainbow cake.. Each of them tasted brilliant, though for me, the chocolate caramel cake was best of the lot..
We also had chocolate fudge, which was heavenly..
Note: Because the caf√© is located at Sector V, they can only cook on induction cookers due to certain restrictions.. So sometimes, maybe their serving time could be lengthy.

The owner was very nice and friendly, and even gave us tokens of appreciation, and I definitely hope to visit there again.. I would recommend it to any cake and dessert lover..

The taste of paris cafe velvet pastry was already in my mouth since when I had it for the first time at its ballygaung branch. The moment I saw the ad on t2 of another paris cafe at sector 5 I decided immediately to be there. 
First thing first the decor and ambience it continued with golden and white based theme which was amazing , giving a feel that I am actually sitting in a 'CAFE OF PARIS'. 4.5/5.
Now comes the food I ordered for chicken steaks which cost 250 , one pasta in red sauce and one velvet pastry . The chicken was worth to eat. It tastes actually yum yum. . To be honest I haven't put my fork & knife until I finished with it. 
The pasta which my friend ordered was also delicious he kept on praising the taste of it. On food I will give 5/5 no doubt. Keep doing the good work. And incase if u want we can become business partner for opening it in other cities. Hahaha. .

I was particularly excited when I heard Paris Cafe opening up in Sector 5, Salt Lake. And coincidentally the place is pretty near to my work place. Its situated on the ground floor of the South City Pinnacle building on EP Block, which is about 7 minutes walk from the Globsyn Crystals building. The interiors have large chandeliers which give the place a period look. The tables are crafted nicely and comfortable. 

Now for the order. We had gone for a team lunch and were in a bit of a hurry. We went around 12:30 pm and got a table instantly. Scanned the menu very quickly and called the waiter to order. We were a bit disappointed as were told that lamb chops and none of the fish items are available. Feeling helpless some of us ordered the Pouliat Poulet and Chicken Steak. One of our friends want to try the Chicken Hamburger. Along with our mains we ordered garlic bread. After checking repeatedly with the waiter, the mains arrived after 30 minutes. We wanted to relish the garlic bread with the mains but couldn't as the garlic bread was served and then it took a while for them to serve the mains. So hungry were we that we could not wait. The chicken steak was well done, the chicken fresh and done to perfection. It was accompanied by generous portions of mashed potato and veggies. The Pouliat Poulet had chicken stuffed with mushrooms and cheese and was done in brown sauce. Too add to the taste we added some Tabasco sauce to it. Not to mention the mashed potato! It tasted heavenly. The colleague who tried the burger said it was average and was the patty was smoking hot which is not usually the case with burgers.

Mains done it was time to order some drinks to wash down the food. So some of us ordered mango mojitos while others ordered strawberry shakes and coffee. The mango mojito was out of this world. Finally rounded up our meal with some caramel pastries. They were awesome. 

Paris cafe is a good place to unwind only if you have some time in hand. The food is awesome and is worth the money. However they do take a bit of time to serve. The waiters were well behaved but I thought they crumble under pressure when a large group goes there to dine. I also over heard someone telling the waiter on the other table that the coffee served to them was cold and they had to change it! Overall slightly expensive but the food makes up for all the other negatives!

The unavailability of  Croissant in a place named after Paris was a bit disappointing early in the morning but the alternative switching to choosing sandwiches and pasta ale ole helped to restore my food love in a wonderfully decorated cafe in the midst of a business park.

This is just next to my office and a perfect place for a quick bite/meal at any time of the day. We always go for the oreo shake or the kitkat shake along with ginger glazed chicken wings and crumb fried prawns. However panco fried chicken can always be taken as a starter along with some stuffed mushrooms. The chicken steak is one of the best chicken steaks i have had in kolkata. Pouliat poulet which was a kind of stuffed chicken fillet also fascinated me. The pastas are also very good.

If you really enjoy cakes then definitely try out their red velvet cakes and rainbow cake.

Picket pinch wud be at par with a fine dining joint.

Ambiance is just perfect. However service is a bit slow.

Food - In one word, great! We ordered Stuffed Mushrooms, Green Thai Curry and Aglio Olio (all vegetarian). Everything we ordered was great but the portions were too too small. We were three of us and the portions were literally for one person. Even while ordering, the staff did not inform us that the portions would not be enough so we ended up with half-filled stomachs since we went for a working lunch and the food came after a good 20-25 minutes. Coming back to the food, the mushrooms were the right amount of juicy. The Thai Curry can be compared to the best in the city. One really can't go very wrong with the Aglio Olio and this place doesn't disappoint either.

Ambience - Was good. Though the area is not very big (still bigger than the Ballygunge one) it still feels very spaced out. Double height ceilings coupled with full height glass walls do the trick (Management: Good call!Staff - Polite and courteous. Though I feel they can be trained more (for educating the customer on the portion size and recommendations etc.)Overall, a nice addition to the eating out scene at Sector V. Would definitely go back.

Paris Cafe, according to me is one of the best cafes in Salt Lake and Kolkata. Located in Salt Lake, Sector 5, very close to College More, the cafe is a little secluded and the ambiance is quiet and perfect. The decor is stunning and it complements the name of the cafe. This outlet of Paris Cafe is spacious and a lot bigger than the Ballygunge outlet.¬†
The food is the really tasty. We ordered a Mushroom Crepe, a Chicken Steak, a Snicker Shake, a small red velvet cup cake, a lemon macaroon and a rainbow cake.
The presentation is mind blowing. The cakes look so delicious that you'd want to order each one of the varieties.
The attendants are very courteous and helpful.
The cafe is pretty famous for it's mushroom crepe. The chicken steak was succulent served with perfectly made mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables.
The cakes here are to die for. The rainbow cake looks great and the taste of it doesn't let you down either. The Red Velvet cup cake and lemon Macaroon were equally good.
This one is a must visit for people who love desserts and continental food.
Give it a try and you'd want to come back again and again.
Cheers!!

On the last day of the year 2014 I went to Paris Cafe, Sector V outlet. My first take on the brand is that foods were exorbitantly priced. The store cleanliness was not something to write about. Chairs and tables looked worn out. Service was not that quick and I discovered that I was the only person who was present at that store at that time (approx 18:00 hrs to 18:30 hrs on 31 12 2014). I saw flies to do their business and that i did not expect from a brand like Paris Cafe. I ordered one Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the pocket got burnt to the tune of Rs 172 (Rs 150 item price + Rs 22 as tax). OMG. It was too much for that sandwich. I must mention that the store is housed in SouthCity Pinnacle which is a posh office location but there were no patrons and I usually do not spot any at other times. Now you be the judge. The staffs were courteous and they should change the music they were playing. Ambiance is good.

So twas quite a time me and my man were planning to visit this place and no wonder it's like someone plucked Paris and placed it here... The decor and dream catcher pretty please hangs from the top looks pretty amazingly. Now food well twas lip smaking we went for pasta spaghetti in  arabbita sauce , grilled chicken steak and for drinks  watermelon freezer which was quite refreshing and well presented with slice of watermelon at the rim of the glass along with mint..... Lastly we went for chocolate cake I don't remember the name but truly after a long time I could actually feel the taste of chocolate in my mouth yumm. But but but I would recommend them to increase the portion of food if only , as it's too pricy for the amount of food they provide..

This was the perfect place to celebrate my hubby's birthday this year as it had the right kind of ambiance we were looking for. We both wanted a quiet and serene place where we could spend some good time with each other. The decor is pretty simple yet very elegant and has a typical European feel to it. I eat Vegetarian on Mondays so i was a bit apprehensive about ordering a veg dish from the menu. After thinking for some time i decided to g ahead with Spinach and Ricotta cheese Cannelloni and my husband wen ahead with ordering a chicken steak and garlic bread. The food was served in a very professional manner and the taste was equally good. I could not believe the veg dish would taste so yummm. That was the time i decided that i have to come back to this place ¬†to try out the non veg stuff for sure. We also ordered an egg -less caramel pastry and it was delicious!!! I liked the way they served it with heart shaped spoons. I also liked the tissue stand and the menu card a lot. Both of them were very cute and very soothing to the eyes. Only problem with this place is it gets closed early... 8.30 PM is when they shut shop. Otherwise a very nice place to spend a nice evening with friends or your special one .
We ordered for a customised cake for a baby shower program and I must say that Paris Cafe did a commendable job. Next time onwards we are surely going to order such cakes only here.

Went to this place on a Monday evening with an old friend of mine.. We ordered a brownie shake, irish cofee and lemon vermicelli fried fish..the irish coffee came accompanied with a pair of I exactly dont know what :P.. but it was nice...and my brownie shake also looked nice...as soon as the fish arrived the waiter serving us came and asked whether we would like to order anything more as the chef will be leaving for the day and it was hardly 8 p.m..weird...the fish slices were very thin- almost as thin as a wafer..tasted ok..it was accompanied with tartar sauce and a salsa..both were nice...now around 8.40 another waiter came up to us and asked whether can he clear the table as they will be closing down...they seemed to be driving us away even when we were the only customers there...i did not like this behavior...overall nice ambience...but the cafe is full of flies...and as everyone mentioned absence of a washroom is a big letdown ..as unlike me,my friend who did not come there directly from office wanted to use the the washroom and had to go to the parking lot to use it...wanted to try their pastries...service needs a lot of improvement.

So I like the decor.. gives you the french feel.. ¬†and its Christmas time so the Christmas carols and all were nice... I quite like the Panini we ordered as well .
But i had gone for dessert mainly .. I have been craving for a nice creamy eclair for a while now ... ¬†ordered a coffee eclair and it was very disappointing . The eclair was hard and the Cr√®me P√¢tissi√®re (pastry cream ) inside didn't taste like coffee and was sour.. ¬† i couldn't go for the second bite.. ¬†I have similar experiences before but this was by far the worst ..

i ordered the red velvet ¬†cake, the sponge was moist but the cream cheese was too overwhelming and didn't taste fresh i ended up not finishing it because of this.¬†

There savoury snacks are really nice , ordered the chicken nuggets and fish it was tasty.

Lovely decor I must say. Amidst the  hustle bustle of sector 5, Paris cafe is the  warm little getaway at th  ground floor of south city pinnacle. I loved the lemon fish with cous cous, neutella crepe and pancake in maple syrup. I also tried the coffee toffee drink and some of th  teas in there. Being strictly honest, having tea bags for tea that too not even a premium brand and charging pretty much for it is a disappointment. I am a fanatic when it comes to freshly brewed tea. The  Darjeeling tea was still good but the Earl Grey was untouchable. The  jumbo prawns have a good feedback from my friends who had it. It's a lovely place with great flavours from Paris. But I would love to try the bakery next time.  

And they should also have a washroom for both men and women since it is a compulsion and not a wishlist. Service needs to improve too. I'd give this branch a 4 but few things have put me off. However I hope by my next few visits it might rise up for good. :)

I thought of visiting this place for a long time and at last when i saw an outlet in sector 5 i decided to execute my plan. Two days back on Sunday I went to Paris Cafe with my school friends to have  a gala time. I was looking forward to trying out this place and was excited but within few minutes i experienced my first disappointment which was the absence of a washroom. How on earth in today's time a restaurant (especially a cafe can omit to built a washroom is beyond my imagination). Just because this cafe is situated in Sector 5 does not mean only people having office nearby will visit this place hence, this particular fact pissed me a lot. The main purpose of visiting this place was to try out their rainbow cake but alas! it was not available and also the options were very little. We opted for red velvet cake slice, chocolate eclairs, chocolate fudge cake, oreo shake, bon bon shake and a fried chicken dish(don't know the exact name). The red velvet cake was amazing to taste but when asked about the price we were told it was 90 but in the bill it was written 110 . The cake was so nice and big in size and this is the reason i do not complain about the price but imparting wrong information definitely puts a negative impression. The other desserts were nice too. The oreo shake was bad as it had no taste but i really liked the bon bon shake. The chicken dish was priced at Rs. 180 and it had thin slices of chicken which were so small that it would not even be sufficient for a kid. The interiors were good but i feel much more can be done because the place is not at all small. I would probably not visit the sector 5 outlet anymore but would try out the other for their cakes.

The ambience was super cool and took me directly to an old school cafe with a vintage setup. The service was sluggish though! We ordered panto fried chicken which inspite of tasting good was not worth the money especially because of the quantity which, according to me, isn't enough to fill one person. The sweet dishes, on the contrary, were delicious - we had chocolate √©clairs, chocolate fudge cake and red velvet cake. Finally, to add to the list were ore shakes and bon bon shakes which were yum. Great cafe but you gotta check on your budget!

An ideal executive cafe in sector 5. The place feels most authentically of a caf√©! Interiors are great and the location is undoubtedly a winner for the techies in the area. Prices are ideal too, and you wont feel the pocket pinch too much! And most importantly the mojito we had was the most authentic! Looking forward to the next visit to try out the chicken steak!

------ 31-Jan-2015 | Zomato foodie meetup -------

Most of the top Kolkata foodies were pretty much excited about this day! It was the Zomato foodie meetup at Paris Cafe, Saltlake sector-5. Most of the guys were in by 1 PM and we started chatting and shring our views on different topics about restaurants, food, life and ofcourse Zomato. Several Zomato App features were discussed and we were all buzzing with new ideas and suggestions. Soon after, these people were all seen only clicking pics of their food and hogging! Starting from starters to desserts, all the items were prepared so well. Perfection written all over them. Thank you Sneha and Zomato for making this meetup experience such a wonderful one and for all the lovely memories. And yes, the food at the Zomato meetup was complimentary! Coming to the food items I had tried - Ginger tea, stuffed mushroom, Mushroom Quesidilla, ginger glazed chicken wings, crumb fried prawns, Fish steak, Mojito, Rainbow Slice, Red velvet cake and chocolate caramel slice. Each and every item was awesome, the crumb fried prawns, Fish steak, Red velvet cake, chocolate caramel slice everything was just stunning! I was so stuffed but just wanted to get back for more. Infact this was my 2nd visit to Paris Cafe, sector-5. I being the first one to review this place on Zomato found a remarkable improvement in most of the departments including the service and food. Really great going Sneha, keep it up!

Cheers to good food and good life!

[P.S. : increasing my rating to 4.5 :-) ]

------- My first visit - Autumn 2014 --------Located at the ground floor of a busy sector 5 office building, South City Pinnacle this cafe is good for a quick bite with your colleague, friend or family.

The furniture and decor gives a very European look, to keep in sync with the name. I really liked the ambiance, it was cozy, comfortable and pretty.

However, one thing that I felt - being located at a busy office building, frosted glass walls instead of plain ones will give customers a little bit more privacy.

Now coming to the food - I had taken pasta in cheese sauce and a strawberry shake. Both tasted quite good, not the-best-I-ever-had kind, but ¬†good enough.

The price though is a bummer, it's quite steep considering the taste of the food and you are in for an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation if you don't carry cash. Cards are still not accepted here!

The hospitality is good, but some waiters are not trained enough. The waiter initially taking our order had trouble understanding that we wanted the pastas made with spaghetti instead of penne. Thankfully for us he was soon replaced by a skilled waiter and we got the food exactly like we had ordered.

Overall, an okayish place to hang out with your friend, maybe for a quick lunch in between busy schedules.

Cheers!
