This place is there in rangoli mall's food court.
A place for South Indian food. I had dosa from here twice, cheese onion masala dosa was good enough but the sambar and chutneys were not at all upto the mark, which are an essential part of the South Indian dishes. Still the dosa was good enough to forgive those runny chutneys and not so good sambar. More work needed on the mentioned items.
