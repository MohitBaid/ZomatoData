This is a typical North Calcutta styled sweet shop located opposite to the petrol pump near Shobhabazar metro station, beside Balaram temple on Grey Street. The serve excellent কোচুরি তরকারি, জিলিপি and many sweets. Typical place for a good breakfast, standing on the pedestrian path and enjoying the hustle.

A great mithai shop of north kolkata, though the shop is small but they serve one of the best sweets in the town with in budget, the dal puri and samosas are very tasty. The garam gulab jamun is a bliss to our taste buds. A great place to hangout with clg friends and a must visit for the sweet craving people of the town. Overall it is a great shop..

Very delicious and fresh sweets but puri sabji and samosa they made were heavily tasty and spicy. Amazed and good to see CCTV cameras installed in such small sweets shop.

Only for It's Jalebis and Kachouris, the best I ever had <3 this shop saved me many times from dying of hunger, when I used to have tuition  classes at Aahiritola. You will not have any problem locating this shop, because it is situated right in front of the Sobhabazar metro front gate. I think, their kachouris are one of the best in Kolkata. I would recommend you to go there and have a bite of that awesome kachouri.

This is a small sweet and snacks shop located diagonally opposite the Sovabazar Metro Station. Food is good. I like their kachori and singara. They make decent jilipi. Must try item here are the hot gulab jamuns. Absolutely melt in your mouth soft and delicious. Not too sweet and perfectly balanced.
