I ordered for Oreo Crunchy Shake and Regular Fruit Salad (TYS Special). The packaging was spill proof. It came on time and was a sweet experience. Definitely ordering more from here! üëç

So I tried it again üòã
Strawberry Shake my favorite one and watermelon.
What I like about their shakes and juices are they don't add extra sugar, preservatives and additional colour in it.
I'm a constant lover of their shakes and wanna try out  again and again.

One of the many perks of having office in Ecospace is thay you get to experience The Yellow Straw.

A small kiosk type of shop which serves cold pressed juices, healthy shakes and toasties.
Has an exciting range of juices and shakes, prepared in front of you with fresh ingredients. The menu is elaborate enough to satisfy the most picky customers. My all time favorite is their mint cooler. Has the right amout of mint and lemon zing made from fresh mint leaves. A blessing during summer.
Friendly staffs add value to your overall experience.
They also serve seasonal specials like fresh orange preparations. The orange sundae has ice cream, orange pulp, whipped cream and anar while the crumble shake adds orange cake to orange juice! 

A huge thumbs up for the huge variety and the continuous feedback they get from their customers.

Probably one of the best places for juice.
This is inside Eco Space.
Price is a little high.
But they add no artificial sweeteners,artificial colours or anything.
So if you wanna try something healthy,this place is must try.

Well, it is located just beside my office, so it brings some much needed refreshment in between huge loads of work.
I have tried mint cooler , chocolate shakes,mango shakes in juice with my friends. I like the sundaes most..mango sundae, mixed fruit sundae... The mint cooler is also very refreshing with  reasonable price.

The place is inside Spensor in Axis Mall in Kolkata. I have been a fan of this outlet since they opened up in Sec 5 in RDB area. Freshest of juice and small bites. They have a special juicer which rotates 3 times slower than regular juicers making the juice more pulpy and healthy (low heat extraction apparently keeps the nutrition intact). The small bites like garlic cheese toast or a exotic fruit salad is very good.

The rates in the outlet in Spensor are quite reasonable. A basic sweetlime or orange juice starts with 50 bucks. You have dozens of options to add more health to your juice like carrots, beetroot, spinach etc. Best part is, unlike other juice parlour, when u tell them not to add sugar to your juice, they dont.

Must try for juice lovers or calorie cautious people.

Tried Garlic cheese toasties, willing to try some juice, detox and sundaes. there are some good offers available on multiple products you should check out that.
Counter manager behaved very well and also answered amy queries very properly.
menus are comparative to it's quality pocket friendly i can say. but it could go some more lesser. like 40 inr items can go 35 with gst it became 40 inr then.
Taste wise cheese garlic toasties was good with a good amount of cheese toppings on it. It tasted good.
Will update soon on other items.

Worst sundae I have ever had.just now I ordered a large mango sundae from ecospace outlet. First of all it is not this big glass(as shown in picture),secondly it was filled with all sour mango cubes n lil ice cream ,there was no apricot ,nothing.instead of apricot (shown in the picture) there were butterscotch chips.when I complained them about the sour mangoes they gave me a blank look n started doing their own work as I had already paid for it.i threw it all in front of them.no apology nothing.i really want a clarification for my hard earned money #theyellowstraw.

This place provides the food they promise.Fresh,healthy food prepared right infront of you.I ordered for a cheese chilli toastie,a mint cooler and a duet sundae.The toastie was basically mayo mixed with herbs and bell pepper spread on a toast and then grilled.The grilled mayo with excess herb tasted a bit bitter in my mouth also I would have preferred if there was some actual 'cheese' in the toastie rather than just mayo.The mint cooler really impressed me,I ordered it with an add on of honey.It had a very tangy and sweet flavour with a subtle flavour of mint and it was soothingly cold with no use of ice.Finally the duet sundae.This was a disaster.They offered a combo of banana and papaya for the duo of fruit with a bit of vanilla icecream which anyhow does not taste good together.It would be better if they add fruits which go together in their duet sundae and not that is just avialable.

Located inside the Ecospace IT park, this tiny little beverage shop has a lot of options to choose from.

A colleague offered us his birthday treat there.

the smoothies and the sundaes were good, but few fruits were not very ripe, hence didn't taste good.

I'll rate it a 4 cuz there aren't many beverage options in the locality, and they do a decent job.

Previously I have visited their Sector V outlet and I quiet really liked it. Today I visited their Ecospace Rajarhat outlet and tried out their Mango Shake and Watermelon juice. Somehow I did not find them much extraordinary. The watermelon juice could have been way better. It had more water than watermelon.

Same goes with the Mango shake as well. It was really really ordinary.

Last week I visited the Ecospace outlet of Yellow Straw and ordered for a Mango Sundae and they serverd me with vanilla icecream where as it should have been a mango icecream.. When I complained to change the order they rude denied saying the icecream is unavailable and charged me the same without any apologies.. Highly dissatisfied!

The idea of a¬†live juice counter where fresh and healthy infusions are being created in front of the eyes is a refreshing sight indeed. I personally like the menu in which the properties associated with each juice is mentioned alongside. I have tried their red berry straw and chilly pataka straw - each very refreshing and tasty. I would love it if they have customization options too.

I am a regular visitor at The Yellow Straw, Ecospace, from the very first day. Needless to mention that I love the range of beverages, toasties, fruit salads and sundae, they offer. A vibrant kiosk with very courteous and customer friendly people managing it, makes it a favourite snacking joint. I have tried every single item on the menu and loved them all. They use fresh fruits of good quality, plus offers a lot of customisation. The only negatives being the revised price chart, which a bit on the higher side, and the mangoes used are not adequately sweet all the time.

The Yellow Straw is one of the latest transformation of the juice centres to be very generic. 

**Location**
This small kiosk in just at sector v saltlake just in front of RDB adlabs.

**Products**
I tried their mint cooler and choco shake.
Really liked the mint cooler very much..quite refreshing specially in summer.
Honestly I didn't like the choco shake it was not rich and thick which I expected. Mixed experience.

USP: They do sell you fresh products live made shakes and juices.

Unfortunately short of pictures. This place gave me chill down my spine with their great range of beverage, while working. A glass of orange pulpy juice was similar to bliss in this scorching heat. They use real oranges no preservatives, best part ice is only used when ask them to. Its pure healthy goodness. I tried their cappuccino ice cream shake, too good. Huge blob of vanilla scoop good amount of choco dust and rest, makes it a good summer beater. There were so many added to the menu, couldn't try them all. But definitely looking forward to the Healthy Summer beaters.

Well, to start of..this was a pretty new outlet inside Ecospace business park. A juice shop, that elite, eh! What struck my mind was...should I be paying my lunch bill for a glass of juice. But once you start here, you get the knack for it.
Prices are considerable, for budget friendly drinkers..I would prefer a regular juice.
They have a range of mixtures in the juices section. I liked quite a few of them, namely the Energizer straw, the chilli pataka straw, the chocolate shake is nice, the fresh juices are nice here. Please see that they drain out the water completely after washing and before preparing your drink.
I would recommend everyone to try the Baked Bean Toasties here, for the ones with the tangy tongue...it's a must try.
Keep going guys, hope you start accepting food coupons sooner.

Its a great joint.

Their juices are simply out of this world and I love their Banana Berry shake. I have stopped missing the Mixed Vegetable Juice from Delhi so much after I tried their Skin Glow Straw. The staff is helpful and the concept of Happy Hours is awesome!! They maintain hygiene and this is my go to place, If I want to perk up on a sad day!

However, I have deducted one point for their food. I tried their cheese chilli toasties and also the toasts with corn.. they used mayonnaise sauce (yes! you read that right) instead of cheese on these toasties. Although, I am aware that mayonnaise can be used in sandwiches and toasts.. but on these toasties it tasted awful and nothing like cheese! 
Another problem is that they frequently run out of ingredients. This might be a good thing in retrospect for them (They are doing good business!) , but it is very annoying for a customer. Frankly, after trying once, I really don't want to try their food again, the juices are good enough for me :)

Besides all the shortcomings.. this is one place I recommend for people interested in healthy eating (Not their food sillies!! The food and Shakes are still unhealthy! :P)

I had once received a gift voucher from Zomato for The Yellow Straw. But it was for the BBD Bag outlet which was very far away from my place. So I could not avail the coupon and was really upset. But I wished to try out The Yellow Straw some time in future. When the opportunity finally came, TYS became my favourite. Their fresh fruit juices and shakes taste divine and are quite reasonably priced. Their chocolate milkshake with bitter chocolate sprinkles is my personal favourite. And yes they do serve their drinks with a "Yellow Straw".

Good quality but quantity is less. Taste is good. Healthy juice. Shakes are also very good. I like it. They also mention the health benefits of various type of juice.

Im a regular here since its in my office compound. However what has brought me here time and again is nothing else but the quality. A glass of any of their fruit n vegetable juices make me feel healthy right from the first sip! :P
The staff is friendly and they take utmost care to ensure that hygeine is maintained.
Highly recommended.

I have been to one of its outlets,the one near rdb and the other time i had ordered a delivery from the one in Ecospace. First day I had just got an Energiser straw, it was good. I had asked the man at the counter if they could pack it for me. To that he said, he could but I need to mention this, the packing was terrible. But otherwise, the staff were good. The next time I ordered Cheese Chilli Toasties and Sweet Chilly Potato toasties. I liked the Cheese Chilli Toasties but the other one was okay-ish. From the drinks section I had ordered Litchi Juice,Mango Shake and a Cold Coffee. These three had no scope for complaints! Absolutely amazing. Nice place to go I'd say.

A vibrant kiosk with a catchy name, the yellow straw sector 5 outlet is right outside rdb boulevard. We stopped by for a drink after an evening show.

Order: 1 cold coffee, 1 chocolate shake.
We didn't try the fruit blends and went for a more classic and safe choice.
It took 7 mins for the order to get ready and the staff was polite and hospitable.
The cold coffee was beautifully made ..little strong less sweet just the way I like it
The chocolate shake was just the opposite. It was over sweet infact way too sweet for my liking and the presence of chocolate vermicelli made it sweeter.
Overall was a decent place.

Price: Very reasonable... We paid 100bucks inclusive for our order.. ( we ordered regular sized ones)

Shall visit again to try their berry banana shake...seemed interesting.

Recommended for a quick drink!

I was pleasantly surprised by the range of healthy juices they had. I am forgetting the name of the juice I had but it was a mixture of guava and pineapple - it claimed to give me healthy bones.

My friend had a juice which was called 'skin glow' juice - I have never heard of a thing like this before ;) it had beetroot , ginger and all things healthy. Given that a lot of people were having that it's either tasty or way too healthy.

Good juices. Super interesting names.  Go try

I tried banana berry shake in this particular outlet and they even dont have the strawberry so they used strawberry flavoured syrup and the taste of the drink was average . I was expecting more from this.¬†

I will try chillli pataka and will give the review once again. But banana berry shake below average

It's right inside my office campus and I am happy to have this outlet here!

I like this outlet because of its cleanliness, all drinks are freshly made, with all real fruits, no artificial flavours! The juices are good and the combinations are innovative.

There has been a mango festival going on. I tried the Dry Fruit Mango Shake, it was really very delicious and heavy.

I am yet to try the toasties, and also looking forward to try the Chilli Pataka Straw and Banana Berry Shake.

Heard about this joint for some time. Got a chance to visit the outlet on last Saturday.¬†
This is one of the cleanest cart I have seen in Kolkata ever. The layout plan is very good. The inside is well illuminated and well planned. Every space is properly utilised.¬†

The person serving from the counter is a very friendly one with clean uniform. It is rare to find a courteous, friendly as well as professional person in these type of kiosks.¬†

This place is very well known in the premises (Ecospace, Rajarhat) for its choice of fresh fruit drinks. But we were craving for some dessert and the person serving suggested a sunday from the Maang Mango edition (sorry forgot the name). It consisted of mango ice-cream with freshly cut mangoes and walnuts.

By jove the mangoes where freshly cut. The ice-cream was of generous portion and so was the quantity of mango and walnut. Every spoonful consisted the three.¬†

It cost us Rs 100/- but one was enough for both of us unless you want to have a dessert meal.¬†

Highly recommended. Please ask for the mango dessert.¬†
Will try the juices some other time for sure as the menu looked very very interesting.

They should start an outlet in Gariahat or Jadavpur.

Fresh ,healthy and yummy. Both the juice and shakes are good. I feel the quantity should be a bit more for both large and regular glasses.
Overall a healthy option :)

I treated myself to the Hawaiian as well as the refresher straw and liked both. Ecospace offers quite a few choices to the palate and nothing like a glass of cold refreshing juice to wash it down. Though I did feel that the prices were on the higher side.
