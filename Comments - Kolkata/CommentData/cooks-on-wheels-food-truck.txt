Situated in front of esplanade metro gate no. 2 in main road. Served desi Chinese in mini truck. No place of Ambience. hospitality was not good. People were rude. Quick service and average presentation. Price was bit high and you have to pay before i.e at the time of order. I tried their veg momo which was good in taste. Spicy, soft and tastes good with both soup and chatni.

Being a kid, whenever I passed through Esplanade Area, I dreamt of having something from the 'Food on Wheels' but was never allowed to. However, once I happened to be in college, I tried all the things not allowable and hence tasted stuffs from here.
I have had ordered for a pakora followed by an Egg Roll, to which I did not find anyone paying heed. After standing there for 10 more minutes and pinching them with my order, they quickly grabbed my money and asked me to stand few more minutes before delivering it.
I did not have had any special expectation with them, but, they exceeded my expectation beyond no means. The pakoras,were not good in any way while the roll was kind of too "below par". Standing at a hot spot area, they could have easily attracted chunks of crowds, had it been serving some lip smacking food.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Well, no.

Qs) Why have I rated them 1.5 stars?
Ans) To show them some mercy.

One of the worst in the town. Somebody give the cook the master chef award worst food. Place is terrible to go with it too. Please avoid yourself from going here. Better eat on the roadside street foods.

one of the worst place. Dare to try anything. The owner thinks himself as sanjeev kapoor II.
very filthy place and extremely bad foods. For this kind of bad food they ask for advance payment.

Worst experience i ever have. They are so bad.  Truck look like 1000yrs old.  They are cooking in a very dirty way.  After seeing this, i don't dare to buy any food from them.

Hungry? Low on money? Don't have much time? Can eat standing on Jawaharlal Nehru Road? Then go for it!! :D Well you can take away too! Has an american burger or taco van kind of a look. Haven't seen much like this around.

While searching for snacks I happened to find this restaurant. Food quality is very good, quantity more than sufficient. I had ordered a plate of egg chowmein and a plate of chilly chicken, and I felt it was enough for two people. The price is very reasonable too. Lastly, delivery was within the time promised. I would definitely recommend it to others :)
