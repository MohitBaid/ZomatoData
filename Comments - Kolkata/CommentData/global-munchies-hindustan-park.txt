This place is easily noticible located just beside Triangular Park. The ambience of this place is beautiful though the seating is limited. They serve various cuisines at reasonable prices and the best thing is the combo where you get a burger, French fries, four pieces of chicken wings and a coke at 200 bucks. Another thing you should try there is the chicken dynamite. The service was good and the manager was very polite. Would definitely come back here !

I have bookmarked this place for quite a long time since I have noticed it in zomato. Today finally got a chance to visit the place for having some snacks. We arrived there in the afternoon around 12.30 and the place was totally vacant then. We were humbly welcomed and got seated comfortably.
Location : The location is very convenient. You can easily locate it by following the road opposite to City style beside Triangular park.
Ambiance : The dining space is well arranged. Interior decoration is decent yet quirky. The bottles used for serving water in red colour is very eye-catching.
Foods : Our Food menu included,
1. Chicken Dynamite
2. Cheesy Chicken Tacos üåÆ
Both of the dishes tasted good. I liked how they served the Chicken dynamite in a glass. 5 pieces of crunchy deep fried chicken dipped in mayo was served in the dish. It tasted innovative yet tasty.
I have tasted Tacos üåÆ for the very first time. It seemed like stuffed papad to me. Chicken chunks end vegetables are stuffed in tacos served along with a spicy tangy saucy bed.
Service : The service was prompt. Behavior of the man who hosted us was very nice. Prices are reasonable too and the menu is inclusive of all taxes. So it's quite easy on pocket to have a satisfying meal.
I will recommend this place for sure. Best of luck to Global Munchies. Hope to visit soon.

Average cafe with limited options for food according to me . Ordered masala tea and italian non veg cheese sandwich. Masalatea was good And sandwich tasted very average didnt have any Italian feel to it . Sofas are cute , ambience is good , brightly lit with pretty lamps all over. Service is prompt .though i think they need to work on their menu a little bit .

Well, it is one of those cozy places where you'ld love to go again and again. The food was lovely. Me and my best friend ordered 4 dishes which were very filling.
1. A pizza - it had a good quantity of cheese, and chicken but too many olives.
2. A pasta in white sauce - the quantity pleased me so much. It was tasty with chunks of chicken.
3. Chicken dynamite - the best thing i had in a long time. The plating was so appetising too.
4. Virgin mojito - not the typical mojito with basil. Bit a punch of flavours, it tasted really good but it shouldn't be called virgin mojito.
The decor and ambience were great. The staff, cordial. And best part? They don't levy taxes.

The place is easy to locate. It is a medium sized cafe with 12-15 seats. The seats are pretty uncomfortable for tall people. The decor is okaish, I guess. Kinda boring. There is one server. We ordered a chicken ceaser salad and was full of lettuce more than anything else. The salad was really salty and tasted below average. Except the cordial staff nothing special about this cafe at all.

Today only I visited this place. The decor is attractive but the chairs are  not comfortable for persons with long legs and waist pain. 
Now coming to food. We ordered for a non veg pasta and a hot chocolate. Pasta was good both in quality and quantity. But 1 thing I wanna suggest is that, cheese should be used more in this dish. Hot chocolate was good in 1 word. Would like to taste other items. 
Thank you!

Went at the time of an offer of unlimited pizza. Good place, good ambiance, customer friendly cafe attendants, had smoked bbq chicken pizza, chiken pizza and veg corn pizza and these 3 dishes were good to quench your desire for pizza and fulfill your expectation but, only upto the breakeven level. :)

Gist : Medium sized AC cafe for average pizza. Bit overpriced with respect to quality. Service is good. Single common toilet is there.
I visited this place on 09.12.17. Easy to locate. The place has a seating capacity of 4*2+2*3+6*1 (person *table).Good decor. A common toilet with a basin inside. One person is serving all customers cordially. An offer was going on of unlimited pizza at 299/-. So opted for that. They served very quickly. But problem is they use take and bake type pizza base. Also crust is normal, there is no option to change that. They have to improve these things a lot. Cause there are way better pizza chain where people can eat and chat. As per menu, it felt overpriced to order any more item. Will visit only if prices are slashed by 25% at least.

The food was pretty much terrible. Not at ALL worth its price. Its more like homely food than a that of a cafe, in that my 2 year old niece could make better pizza.
We couldn't even finish our food because of how inedible it was

Located near Triangular Park, this restaurant offers munchies and starters from around the world. Nice concept, keeping in mind the fact that Calcuttans are experimenting with their palates. 
We tried out 2 of their dishes as was suggested by the very friendly man at the counter.
*Chicken Dynamite: Served in a glass with veggies as its base, this one is an absolute winner. It has a crispy layer and a spicy tinge to it which further adds to its flavour. 5 moderately sized pieces for Rs.165 is a good bargainüòâ.
*Loaded Egg Quesadillas: Buyoed by the success of the previous order, we gathered suggestions and ordered this Mexican dish. Now this is where we committed the biggest mistake. The portion was good enough for two and it came with a sauce full of veggies; however apart from the egg, what we excavated from the oil-less wraps was capsicum; and it was quite a lot, lot in the sense it was almost a whole capsicum that went in to it. After a point of time, we were quite disgusted with the boring taste of it and could not continue anymore with itüòëüòï.. Rs. 185 went down the drain. I hope that they would experiment more with this dish and offer it with a better taste.

Overall, it was a mixed experience for us.
 The decor was minimalistic and appeals to one's eyes. 
I would visit this place another time to try out their other offerings and would expect not to be disappointed.

It was sad to not have another co-diner all along and we were the only patrons. This place definitely deserves more footfall on account of its superior and unique dishes and convenient location.

Global Munchies is a cutesy cafe/diner near Triangular Park. The menu is a global fusion. Tidbits from popular cuisines, like Chinese, Thai, Mexican, Italian and American are on offer. I tried the chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla came with ample fresh grilled veggies, chicken and cheese, but I felt the flavours were a bit too Indianised. I have tried quesadillas elsewhere (even abroad) and this one wasn‚Äôt authentic per se. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but I expected it to be a bit more traditional. The portion size was good and it filled up pretty much. 
I will like to try some of their other dishes. The pocket pinch isn‚Äôt too high. The menu looks promising and I am sure that with a little more work, the place can truly turn out to be a gem.

Thought of paying a visit to this joint one fine day. 
Stationed at triangular park,gariahat this place serves you continental delicacies. 
From the menu we tried: Fried mozzarella cheese , Spicy Chicken Wings, Chicken Dynamite , Cheese chicken taco.
Well the food wasnt really very impressive it was towards the okay margin. 
The preparations could have been way better. 
The only thing that i personally like was the chicken wings. 
The other dishes needs a lot of attention to make it a better one. 
I would definitely recomend the joint owners to give it a look. 
For now i would hold my recomendation for my food buddies to visit this joint. 
The only thing which is worth mentioning is this joint is very pocket friendly but only when it can suffice your appetite.

Located just beside triangular park, this cafe has huge locational advantage being quite easy to locate. 

The interiors are very well decorated,with cute little chairs and sofas. Each table having water in colourful bottles. 

We ordered Chicken Dynamite and Honey musturd chicken titbits. 

Chicken Dynamite was awsome and had a very unique taste. ‚ù§ Fried chicken pieces were served with tangy musturd mayo on top. I loved this dish! 

Honey musturd titbits was also delicious having a sweet as well as spicy taste. üòä

Prices are affordable with no extra taxes, you pay the price you see on the menu.

I visited here this afternoon and came out all happy mind-wise, money-wise and tummy-wise.
We had:
‚ô°Black Currant Mojito: All fruit juice lovers should try this once. This was something new for me and I really liked it.
‚ô°Chicken Dynamite: I don't know why this was in the Chinese section, nevertheless, the sauce was different, it was creamy yet spicy. The crispy leafy greens added freshness to this delicious mouthful. I also liked that it was presented in a glass.
‚ô°Cheesy Chicken Tacos: We were in awe with the appearance of this dish. The taco shells have this beautiful red colour, we don't know why. The filling was yummy.
Long story short,we just loved the food.
The ambience is charming, space utilization is very good. Service is courteous, they offered the two of us to sit on the huge couch, which was sweet and unexpected.
The only factor is service was tardy and that's due to lack of staff. They should keep more staffs to speed up the service.
I wouldn't mind going there again

We visited this place without any  planning whatsoever. This a small cafe type food joint. The simplistic decor has a certain charm to it. Staffs are friendly and courteous. Now coming to the food.....we ordered chicken club sandwich, chcken burger and cold coffee with icecream. Sandwich was very good, although the burger could have been better. The chicken patty in the burger was quite dry. Otherwise it was a good meal. Coffee was okey.
 In my opinion this joint has the potential to become a great cafe, location is very good, and since its a new food joint they need some time to experiment and adjust their menu and the food they offer.

Awesome ambience, Unique experience of live kitchen, you can hangout with friends with nice smell of food that will surely make you more hungry. Located near triangular park ,opposite street of city style mall, gariahat makes it reachable from any place with ease. It is so pocket friendly that two people can easily eat within 300/- and they serve different cusines from different countries.

Decor is very classy.
You can hangout for hours with friends and they also have some board games.

Definitely try Chicken Dynamite, Spaghetti with meatballs, chicken wings

Cesar's salad to my surprise had warm crumbed fried chicken nuggets !!
Chicken cutlet had everything thing but the chicken, the so called minced chicken was nothing but breadcrumbs with masala!!! Check the picture, it was so unpalatable that we couldn't eat it. 
After this experience did not have the courage to order for any beverages!!!!
The place was smoky because of burnt oil !!!!
Only one person to take order, serve, do clearance, generate the bill and then handle the payment. 

This was my first and last visit to this place.

Located in the alley just beside triangular park exactly on the opposite bylane of 'City Style'.
This newly opened outlet is very well decorated. You will definitely love the ambience of this place.It has a very cosy but classy decor.
Tried loaded chicken quesadillas,honey mustard chicken tidbits and tutty fruity.
Honey mustard  chicken tidbits:Chicken pieces were cooked with right amount of spice.Crust was crispy.This dish had exactly the right amount of honey that saves the dish from being too much sweet.Only complain is chicken was a bit chewy.A tad hard in texture.
Loaded chicken quesadillas:It's like  a crape or tortilla stuffed with bellpepers,chicken,mayonese and served with a tangy sauce which also had bellpepers in it.The dish looked colourful.Tastewise its on the okeyish side.
Tutty fruity: It consists of fruits, honey,sweet syrup and scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious .A perfect desert to finish of your snacks.
Staffs are attentive and friendly.
They do not charge any extra tax.Well that's a brownie point.
Conclusion:
Food:3.5/5
Staff:4.5/5
Decor:3.5/5
Price:Affordable.
A good place to visit for students because they serve global snacks at affordable price.

This place is newest addition to it's kind. As you enter you can feel the youthful vibes that it delivers. Peppy tunes, innovative decor and handiwork of hanging lanterns are eye-soothing. Now coming to it's menu card, looking to to it's right hand side against each dishes will bring smile on your face. Yes, you heard me right! It's pocketfriendly and capable of being a hit within college student. Staffs are overwhelming and will greet you at once you enter their cafe. On an evening I was there with a friend and we ordered cold coffee with ice cream and tooty-frooty! And they tasted exceptionally good. With tooty frooty you would have a foodgasmic experience and i surely recommend to give it a try. And to put the cherry on top they gave us two discout vouchers which we can redeem on our next visit (yay!). As this cafe is hardly a month old, so, best of luck with your upcoming endeavour. All the best. You definitely stand out from the rest.

I just loved the theme of the cafe. The ambience is so lively and u get a good vibe when u enter inside. The drinks are pretty good seeing their price. Food was awesome. I had loaded breakfast quesadilla and just loved it. I feel it is one of the best cafes in this area and i wish the management a very best of luck for future.

It was a small cozy place.... Loved the food....  We ordered Italian spaghetti sauce with meatballs, Chinese chicken wings, Virgin mojito & blue lagoon.....  Very much pocket friendly bt their service is not so good....  Then took near about 40 mins to prepare our foods...

Best place to hangout with friends with the combination of great food. Awesome ambience, Unique experience of live kitchen, you can hangout with friends with nice smell of food that will surely make you more hungry. Located in triangular park, gariahat makes it reachable from any place with ease. It is so pocket friendly that two people can easily eat within 300/-.
