The Maat is located on your way towards Garia station from 1B bus stand. This is totally a fast food centre. Tasted the rolls, fish fry and the Briyani. The food were really good. They packed a wrong Briyani so they did exchange the pack by exchange I mean they have a new pack. Sitting facility is not that good open air sitting by the road side better to opt for takeaway.

Typical Kolkata road side eatery. Not very fancy stuff but good food in cheap price. You have to wait for your order if you go around 9 in the evening. Accepts Paytm.

Very near to my home,this take away joint has been delivering food at our home for the last few years. Nothing to mention about the ambienc as it is a purely take away joint wid 2 outdoor plastic tables to hav ur food there. Coming to wat matters the most,the food taste, quality and quantity are realy good. The mixed fried rice tastes awesome so does the mixed gravy noodles. Nearby and hungry? This is your go to place.
