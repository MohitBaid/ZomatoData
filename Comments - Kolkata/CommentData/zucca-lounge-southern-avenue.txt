The one and only reason to visit this cafe, is their outdoor sitting area in the Terrace. The cafe is situated on the 4th floor. The theme is very romantic, outside. There is no unnecessary distractions like feedback sheets, questions, opinion seeking. Simple fuss free lounge for spending hours with friends and loved ones. The view in the evening at sunset is breathtaking.

Coming to the food part -
We ordered - Shanghai chicken pizza, banana and coconut milkshake, mint mojito, and blue Pacific. The quality of food was very good, and so is the taste. Blue Pacific is not like any normal blue lagoon. It tasted different and unique. There were sprinkles of coconut powder in the glass. And hence, this is why I loved it so much.

Staff and ambience -
The staffs are not professional. And are literally very slow. They are way too much casual about their customers. Which annoyed me alot. So, I guess the authorities should work on their men's.

The price is justified. And kinda affordable. So, probably, can go second time.

Conveniently located at Southern Avenue, the lounge provides an awesome rooftop view and is a great place to chill in the summers. Unfortunately, this place has a pathetic service and ranks quiet low in attending the customers  and overall management. The service guys are ever lost and confused and lacks co ordination among themselves. One have to wait for ages for his order to get served. The food quality is also quiet average. The pocket pinch is decent. Had a huge expectation from Zucca Lounge but returned crestfallen.

Rooftop places always have a distinctive aura about them and despite all the rave reviews about this place, I find it difficult to form a proper synchronization between the expectation the pictures uploaded here portray and the service Zucca renders. 

I visited the place two weeks back on a warm-turned-cold evening after dismissing other nearby options owing to the weekend crowd. I mean no offense to the place but the manner in which it has been marketed to attract customers does not furnish the truth entirely. The setup is nice but a little modification would invite quality to its look. Another thing that disappointed me about this place is its service. Very sluggish, the waiters almost looking disinterested to comply. The process of taking orders and executing them is pretty lackluster. 

I wouldn't say it was worth the interminable wait, but the food was joyous. The hookah was accompanied by a rather unconventional combination of Chinese nibbles, Afghani Kebab and a drink.

There have been worse experiences but I certainly hope this place doesn't disappoint next time around.

When you are out on Christmas eve, what better can it be than a rooftop experience to set the mood right. So we decided to drop in at Zucca Lounge which is situated on Southern Avenue very close to Whatsup Cafe. It is spread across two floors (3rd and 4th). If you are not up for a detailed and a long review, i suggest don't go further.

‚ñ´Ô∏è AMBIENCE: Due to the rooftop segment being filled up when we arrived and having expressed our desire for an accomodation there, they temporarily accomodated us at their 3rd floor segment with the promise to shift us the moment there was any vacancy above. The third floor segment is not so big, but it is quite well done. With live screening facility and songs upping the tempo you will definitely feel the jive. As promised very shortly we were being given accomodation on the rooftop segment. The rooftop is adorned with small cubicle like areas with plush sofas and curtains, giving you some private space. It is a perfect place for taking out your loved @one for a special time, or for hanging out with group of friends. Zucca offers you all. So, ambience wise a thumbs up and it definitely lives up to the expectations.

‚ñ´Ô∏è HOSPITALITY: Regarding the hospitality segment too, Zucca doesn't take a step back. Their staffs are quite attentive and very friendly. Even in the rush, they didn't go down on this segment. But one pointer, the food did take a bit longer than expected. But still, i will give them the benefit of doubt.

‚ñ´Ô∏èFOOD: Well, having had lunch before we were a bit full, so we settled for:-

1. Texas stand off pizza: It is an 8 to 9 inch thin crust pizza. And comes with toppings of chicken pieces, sausages, and minced meat in quite generous amounts. It was delicious indeed. With the flavours and meat doing the job, this one is going to make your evening a bit better.

2. Zucca lounge special mocktail: This one was good too, and quite refreshing. Nothing much to say.

3. Cocoa island: With Zucca having done well up this while, may be this one was left to bowl us over. Chocolate milkshake with banana falvour. This one was absolutely spot on. Everything was right about it. The presentation, the flavour, the viscosity of the milkshake, literally everything. Highly recommended.

Zucca indeed does it's bit to offer you a great evening with your friends and loved ones. Keep up the good work!!
Plan to come soon again!!

Coming to the service, it‚Äôs really really slow. Hookah took 20 mins to come and pasta was another 20-25 mins. Please work on the service bit as other things (food and ambience) is just WOW!

It's a real nice place to have a seat over here. The ambience is great and they serve the best tasting food. One thing is that if you want to have good food, you have to spend some money on it. To me it's a bit pricey but superb food if found here. The place is too comfortable and hanging out with friends over here would be a cool idea.

I visited this place on the 7th of December with my friends to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. Okay so the staff is really courteous and they helped us out with the birthday surprise. The place is soberly decorated and the whiteness of the place is amazing as it adds to its beauty by being a rooftop lounge. Even though it‚Äôs a small place, it‚Äôs very comfortable and the seating is relaxant.
We ordered for pan fried noodles, Thai spiced chilli baby corn, Mexican delight pizza and brain freezer shisha. The service was quite slow as it is the staff wasn‚Äôt enough to handle every table.
The pizza tasted wonderful but the noodles were not the same. Baby corn took a long time to arrive and by that time we were full so we couldn‚Äôt savour it‚Äôs taste even though it was good enough. The shisha out there was okayish, though a bit on the negative side. But the overall experience was really nice and the hospitality was wonderful. Will be visiting this place soon.

It's over-hyped. First of all the staffs were ok. Not so great. Food is great. Hookah are not so great. We did not get the benefits for Happy hours. Though it was mentioned. Third while billing apart from gst they put an 8% as service charge. Wen I questioned them they said it's optional. I don't know what it means rather  how can they do this. Please see ur bill if you have been overcharged by service charge. Looks are good. Rooftop is ohk

Visited there yesterday evening. Situated just next to the road and can easily navigate there via google maps. 

Ambience: 4/5 Would suggest to go for the open roof instead of the closed area at 2nd floor. 

Food: Ordered a double apple hookah with watermelon base. Club Sandwich, Brownie Shake and Tandoori Paneer Tikka. All items were well prepared. Paneer was succulent and well marinated with spices. Club sandwich has 4 pieces, found it difficult to finish. 

Service: Was fast as the crowd was less at my time. Served by Sunny whose prompt action and readiness to serve will make your meal more enjoyable.

Zucca lounge is the only Hookah cafe that non-Hookah lovers can attune to. Even with all the smoke and loud music, this is a perfect place to be with your friends and spend hours. The staff is pleasant and engaging.
You will have no problem locating this place, as it is stark opposite to the Vivekananda Park in Gariahat.

Now, the watermelon mojito was a delight for any watermelon lover, the kiwi delight was filled with kiwi pulp, hence tasty. The Oreo shake being scrumptious and topped with cherry couldn't have been better. Not an expert on Tea or anything, but the Jasmine Tea was decent as well. To be honest, Jack Frost, the name sounded nice and a friend of ours ordered it and the wild shot was a success.
Coming to the appetizers and entr√©es, the food was amazing. The Non veg Risotto was well cooked and boasted of cheese and chicken. The Yucatan sandwich was not filling but delectable. The texan stand up pizza was enough to fill one stomach and the presence of nachos never disappointed anyone. Chicken cacciatore was one of a kind and was delicious. Lastly the pan fried noodles; loaded with minced chicken and topped with veggies was enough to fill us up. 

The best part about this place is the rooftop. One cannot have enough of it. Decked with furniture covered in whites and spacious too. During daytime going to the rooftop might be a foolish decision but in winters, this is the place to be with your friends.
It is a tad too costly as per nearby restaurants, but a solitary visit won't do you any harm!

I have been hearing a lot about the wonderful ambience of this place, so tried this place today. The 4th Floor was full and we were asked to wait in the 3rd Floor and said that they will let us know whenever there is a vacancy, but seeing the 3rd Floor, we settled there only.

Third floor is a closed room cafe, with both sofas and normal chairs provided for seating.

The ambience of this place is okay with nothing extravagant (which is a good thing). The criss cross lighting in the ceiling which was getting reflected in the glass tables below was adding to the ambience.

The staffs here are bit slow to my opinion, and they had an attitude that they were not expecting us in the third floor and may be people only come to 3rd Floor as a waiting place or if there is no vacancy in the 4th Floor. Though the service is late but the staffs were cordial and were happy to explain the dishes.

Zucca Classic Mojito - The drink was refreshing.
Cafe Latte
Tandoori Non Veg Platter - Tandoori Kebabs - fish, prawn and chicken. The fish was too good.
Thai Spiced Mapo Chicken (Chicken tossed with bird chilli and basil) - This is good in taste and little spicy.

Been here few weeks back on recommendation of a close friend. Zucca is seperated into two part, one is the close room which is nicely decorated and has ample sitting space. 2nd is the roof top where you have 2kind of sitting arrangement, if you want seat for 2-3people then the seats are like any other normal cafe but if you go in a big group & want to chill then Zucca has seperately designed white washed open cabins. Its spectacular. The staffs are nice, although the service is a bit late. Coming to the food.. they are good at making mughlais & sandwiches. The salads are quite average. This is an apt place to hangout with friends & would love to visit again cuz of the lovely rooftop & nice music.

I visited this solely for the ambience but was little disappointed after visiting it. Loud punjabi pop songs spoiled the whole mood and the ambience. They could have played soft ,soothing and romantic music. Other than this, the rooftop ambience,cabanas ,food, all were great. Quantity of each of the dishes was abundant and very filling.

Describing the food...

1) Oreo poppers- Given in a big jar, tasted wonderful.
2) Jack frost- Selected this by reading a zomato review, but I didn't find it great. Very ordinary.
3) Xaccuti spiced corn dusted chicken- crispy fried chicken given with sauce was good in taste and consisted of 5 pieces.
4) Vegetable grilled risotto with chicken- enjoyed it and found it very filling.
5)Oriental non veg platter- It consisted of chicken,lamb,prawn and fish and was very very delectable.
All the dishes were overpriced. It is a good choice to spend quality time and enjoy food on a winter night.

This have been in my wish list for long time.. and finally went there yesterday with my 2 best buddies.. we turned up there around 4 pm and we offcourse had seat on rooftop. An amazing place to hangout and spend time with your loved ones. Service is also good.
We ordered for one watermelon smoothie (Antioxidant please), one oreo poppers ( liked both the two beverages, specially oreo poppers).
Then we ordered for Wings of fire (chicken wings in bbq sauce), masala fries ( this is like father of french fries, nice and quantity is also good). This came with a special ketchup but we requested for a dip of mayonnaise and they served it within a few minutes)
How come a brownie lover could just avoid it? Lastly we ordered brownie with ice cream and trust me this is the best brownie I have ever tasted yet.
I loved their brownie and the appearance is also very good..
Total bill was 1082 including GST (12%) and optional service tax (6%).

Zucca lounge is spread over 2 floors, one being a closed cafe, and the other an open terrace zone. Both the places are indeed beautiful, the rooftop having comfortable cabanas, and the closed space having comfortable seating arrangements. We attended the place for a friend's birthday, we already had a booking. However no staff attended us when we sat in the cabana for about 15 mins. We had to constantly ask someone to come and take our order. However, then we decided to shift down because of the day sunlight, and the food was served to us there, We ordered a variety of items such as babycorn, french fries, masala fries, schezwan noodles, pasta, oreo shake, flavoured mojito, and orange mocktail. The pasta and the noodles tasted amazing, however the babycorn was nothing great. We ordered the babycorn twice, both times neither it was crispy nor tasted great. The shakes and mocktails were amazing too.

Went there with few of my friends during Durga Puja and had a pretty average experience. The food was unsatisfactory quantity, the hookah was average and most importantly the A/C wasnt working. We had to sweat out of the place. All the marks goes to the hospitality.

Except that nothing is good about this place..the food is okayish  and the service is horrible..
The hookah was good and the decoration was attractive.
Need to improve their service and train their staffs..

If you are planning in the winter time, zucca lounge is one of the best rooftop restaurants of south kolkata.  They have created a very relaxing and romantic ambience,  full marks for that. But they could have used the lights more efficiently. Coming to the food,  trece spiced pizza was tasty and sufficiently filling. We also ordered oreo poppers,  a shake of chocolate and milk, with chunks of oreo biscuits. Had they added a bit less sugar in the shake,  it would have been much better in taste. Overall,  it is a good destination to go either with friends or with your special one.

The ambience is good with comfortable seating arrangements though the outdoor seating wasn't available as it was raining. The food was below average . We ordered Thai spiced mapo chicken, fish tossed in celery salt, mojito, brownie with vanilla ice-cream.The chicken was little undercooked and salty! The fish was fine.Mohito and brownie were oke.The Hookah was good, we had ordered Rasila paan.

The only reason that the place gets a 2 point from me is because of the decor and the ambience . 
Food tastes really bad , the menu is very limited .

Ordered antioxidant please - a watermelon drink, tasted good. Oriental kebab platter - fish, chicken, and prawn. Each tasted quite different nd nice. Hookah was OK. Though asked the server whether coal was free which he sd yes, BT later found out it's not. Capped off the evening with brownie with ice cream. 2 brownie pieces!! Just was delightful.

Food - Excellent food served. I was here with a friend and ordered for oriental non-veg platter (include prawn, lamb, chicken and fish), texas stand off (a pizza topped with tacos which is very delicious), passion fruit mojito and brownie with vanilla icecream. All are worth tasting.

Ambience - Funky lounge.

Service - Attendants are friendly and helpful.

Rate - Appropriate.

If you're looking for a rooftop lounge, this is a really nice place to opt for! To begin with, the location can be easily located. The rooftop lounge gives a very calm and serene ambience. The seating space is comfortable and gives a relaxed feeling. Now, coming onto the food, we ordered fries, classic mojito, jack frost, wings of fire, pan fried noodles and pan rasna flavoured hookah. The food was really good and at a reasonable price point. To sum it up, would rate it as:
Ambience-4.5/5
Service-4/5
Food-4/5

The only reason people should go here is to enjoy the rooftop view in the evening. A nice place to hang out with some drinks and hookah. But, please do not expect very good food from this place.
We ordered
Wings of Fire (from Nibbles)....spicy and the taste is fine
Anabella (from Penne and Spaghetti)
Chicken Caccatore (From mains)
Oriental Non-veg platter but it was not available so we settled for Indian Non-veg platter
Along with fresh lime soda.¬†
Out of the above dishes, Chicken Caccatore was the best...liked the mushroom sauce.
But the Indian platter was salty.
The service was slow when it came to the main food; however, the drinks and nibbles were served quite fast
Overall taste of food was average but the location will make a perfect evening

So on dasami morning we visited this place to grab some coffee. The place is very close to cafe drifter , walk straight from the Sony centre and you will find it. The place looks amazing. With hanging bulbs , cozy sofas , quirky posters , this place is a real eye catcher. So it was supposed to open at 7:30 but they informed us , they won't open till 12:30. Okay that is accepted during pujas. So reaching there at 11:45 , we had to wait. At 12:25 they asked us to order. So we ordered one espresso , one cafe latte and two red velvet cheese cake. To our much disappointment they informed us that the cheese cake isn't available. After 10 minutes again they informed us the coffee machine isn't working and they won't be able to serve coffee to us . This kind of service isn't acceptable from such a reputed place.

It's a very nice rooftop lounge. Seating arrangements are really nice and ambiance is really awesome with some good music playing in the background. But the service was not good we ordered one mock tail, one hookah and chicken wings dish along with a non veg pizza. But when they brought the orders they came with two mock tails, saying we have ordered two of them. It was really disappointing as we didn't argue much and we took it. Don't play this trick with ur customers. Otherwise all the food tasted very nice along with those mock tails and hookah.

I ended up here with a couple of friends who I met after a very long time and it was a good place. We enjoyed the rooftop open air space and seated in a beautiful cabana. It was very spacious and a big group can easily hang out here. 
The food was also good. We ended up sharing a platter and a couple of starters. Nothing in the main course. The drinks were average and did not try the hookah. 
I am sure the evening setting here will be even better but we had been here only in the afternoon. It is certainly very romantic even in the afternoon. 
Would like to visit it again for sure and try the main courses.

An average place without a suitable rooftop ambience. Overpriced with limited variety of food and mocktails. Staffs are ok in their services. You will be highly disappointed if you go with the plan to spend some lovely moments with your loved ones accompanied by romantic rooftop surroundings!

It was saptami evening and I was already frustrated of the huge crowd of people thronging each and every pandal. So to chill of the heat , we (my wife and I) decided to meet with our friends herein.
Located at a convenient place , just opposite to Vivekananda park it was easy to find.
It has both inside and terrace sitting options. Our friends were settled inside, so we joined em.
Loud desi EDMs were blaring from the surround speakers, dimmed lights blurred by the smoke of the hookahs of adjacent tables, colorfully decorated people in the contrast made up for its heady ambience.
Anyhow, seated in plush sofas we ordered for a pan rasna flavoured hookah & cappuccino. Also for food we ordered a classic club sandwich and xacuti spiced corn dusted chicken.
The hookah was nice had mellow and smooth flavour of pan rasna.
The food also was served simultaneously. The xacuti spiced corn fried chicken came 1st. It had 6-7 slices of chicken coated in some cornish thingy and deeply fried , served with a sauce. The chicken was yummy, soft delicious and crispy.
Then came the classic club sandwich; it was a double decker standard sandwich stuffed with veggies , chicken, cheese and mayo. It was usual. However, I liked the French fry served with it.

Overall, it was a good time pass, nothing out of the ordinary, but good place if you like the loud music/hookah/pricey option combo.

PS it costed us about 1500 bux.

The zucca special mojito was nice but the zucca tropical harvest was so bad my Friend couldn't drink it. The ambience is great but apart from that nothing is worth paying so much money for. The bill total was 1251. We paid rupees 628 each for almost uneaten food. Very disappointed with the food.

Romantic place. Best place to spend some quality time with the loved ones. The lounge has two segments. The enclosed which is air condiotioned. And the other one is open roof top view. Budget friendly place with a great ambience. The roof top opening time is after 5pm, i went early so had to visit the enclosed area. Music is groovy. I really like the color changing ceiling. We had ordered for Salt and pepper-duet of corn, loaded nachos, watermelon Mojito and shisha. Food was good, delicious. Staffs were friendly and courteous. 
A must visit place.

My rating is only for the Ambience <3, staffs and the drinks they serve. If you love open air, rooftop then it is surely a must go place to chill out with your friends and families. Food is just average but their drinks are Nice. You can try Jack frost and South cooler in which they use coconut as creme or milk in the drinks. Their sitting arrangement is very comfy where you can literally spread your legs and chill out with a sip of drinks. They have live screening system which is like cherry on the cake.

Located right beside Vivekananda Park and a few yards away from The French Loaf and Fillers, this place is a nice one to enjoy food, beverages, and hookah. The lounge has two segments. The enclosed (air conditioned) area is on the 3rd floor and their another sitting area is on the rooftop. A nicely decorated one and usually full of young crowd, this place has a nice ambience with good music. The rooftop with cabanas create a perfect ambience for romance. But the humid weather of Kolkata makes it difficult to stay on the rooftop for long!

Apart from their food, their beverages including shakes and mocktails are quite good in taste. We ordered Xacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken. In beverages, we ordered for Oreo Poppers, Lychee Fantasy and Afterglow. All these were good in taste. The Oreo Poppers was a bit heavy as it usually is and tasted like a Ferrero Rocher Shake.

But we found hair in one of the chicken pieces of Xacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken. When we complained about it, they replaced the entire dish. This is the only con we noticed at that place.

Reach the place early if you're visiting on weekends as people usually come in groups and sit for hours.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 700 for two (approx) (excluding hookah)

This place is one of the best in rooftops according to the ambience. I absolutely love the white sofa interiors and the cabannas. Should be visited during the evening or night. Lovely place to chill and enjoy. Food is good. Sheesha was also good. Overall a good experience.

Beautiful place with a white theme based seating area. Though, not preferable during summer or evening autumn afternoons or evenings as it gets too humid and there ain't enough fans to keep you cool! The ambience is good otherwise and so is the food. A nice hangout place for an evening mocktail drink with friends!

This place is super amazing! I visited this place on my friend's birthday. We had ordered baby corn, pizza, pasta & Kiwi mocktail. All of them tasted excellent! The service wasn't very satisfactory. We had to call the waiter for each and every thing, even for water. Otherwise, the experience was good.

Zucca is one of the most romantic places in the city for couples to visit and spend some quality time together. The lounge has two parts, a covered lounge area on the third floor and the popular rooftop deck. The ambience is fantastic with perfect lighting and good soft music. 
Ordered from the menu were veg risotto and mixed sauce penne pasta. Risotto was perfectly cooked and delicious to eat. Shisha is equally good making the place a complete package. 
Budget friendly place with a great ambience and delicious food makes this a must visit place in the city.

First thoughts on entering the place, "breathtakingly beautiful". The ambience just shook me. They have cabana as well as normal seats. Being an open air restaurant in kolkata had its con too though, it was humid as hell. But never mind that. We opted for a hookah (forgot the flavour), orange basil punch, lemon honey mint and pan fried noodles. I quite liked the noodles and the drinks were refreshing too. Not over the top. But decent enough

The place is quite expensive, and was jam packed on a saturday evening. But nevertheless, we quite enjoyed it.

Worst Place to Visit especially during the Rainy season but then have they not thought about the percussion and the end result it has on a customer who spends his time and money to come all the way to southern Avenue Only to be told that the Cabanas are not available and then you are thrown into this indoor kinda place with a simple but okayish ambiance which adds to the misery .....Cookie crumble shakes were all a Total waste of money and not worth it .......Gum Supari Hookah with taxes were nearly 600-700 each I mean Man why should a person pay so much for crap !! Babycorn was just a bland silly dish should have been called soggy babycorn instead of crisp babycorn , The Nachos was the only one which made some sense - Some of the Staff were kinda aloof and pretty rude too which made matters worse Anyways - Would not come back here again nor would recommend this place to anyone¬†

When we left our place it wasn't raining and wanted to visit to get a feel of it's much talked abt white cabanas. when we reached it started raining and all but one was occupied.One was messed up with all cusions thrown.We went indoors.Music was rocking. Cookie crumble shake was a disaster .Peach bull savior. when it rains better to not opt for terrace as they switch off the music (projector closed due to rain). Over all pleasant experience !!

Visited Zucca this Friday on the occasion of a friend's birthday, and was greeted very warmly by the staffs. They are well acquainted with hosting guests, specially if you turn up to Zucca for a celebration.
Ambience is pretty good, unfortunately couldn't make it  to the rooftop because of rain.

On the table:
‚Ä¢ Trece Spiced
‚Ä¢ Texas Stand off
‚Ä¢ Shanghai Surprise among pizza
The Sanghai Surprise was out of the world I must say, and mark it as a must-have if you visit Zucca.
‚Ä¢ Burrito Indiana Ala Zucca
It was pretty decent
‚Ä¢ Aop Saporita
This was one of the best Spaghetti I've had in recent years.

Overall the day was lit with all the wonderful music played on the giant screen, romantic ambience and friendly staffs.

Excellent ambience.
Rooftop lounge with exquisite deco.
Though if you dnt want rooftop as it is not suitable for daytime visit,theres also a normal internal cafe where you can sit.
Now if I talk about the taste of the food,I personally dint find anything special in the taste.
I ordere a normal veg club sandwich and they served a normal tomato cucumber sandwich which wasnt
grilled properly neither it tasted something unusual.
And ofcourse the price are high,but if you keep the food aside,a good place to hangout if you are hukkah loverüòä

Last year I celebrated my b day here and booked a cabana for which they charged 1000 rs. This time we wr 5 ppl so they asked us to sit in the cabana without any extra charge. Hookah was nice and food was good too. And 9/10 for the rooftop ambience

Price on the higher side, decent cafe with awesome interiors and rooftop setup, but truly not value for money.

Went in a large group, service is fast and responsiive.
Tried their pan fried noodles, which was deep fried noodles with sause and veggies poured over it, a first try of something of this sort, liked it.

The thai spiced chilli babycorn served to us was crisp but didn't like the sause it was cooked in, not a recommended dish. Their loaded nachos is a good try has a good amount of salsa over it.

Tried their pasta as well with mama rosa sause, quantity very less and taste wise pretty normal. Also tried a rissoto called 'pramavera' which was the best dish over all, truly loved it, it had a mixed nature of sause.

For beverages tried their oreo poppers and cold coffee, awsome presentation, heavy and nicley made. Zucca classic mojito that we tried was ok.Also tried a Earl grey tea, which was served a tea bag with hot water with honey and lemon, recommend the management to serve ready tea and not just handing a tea bag.

Go for open seating, specially in winters, top seating in summer and humid weather is a big no, as they just have fans and no air coolers.

Far below expectations. Had seen photos and reviews on Zomato and turned up for it but had a distasteful experience. The open air canopy style sitting arrangements was off limits as one was occupied the other one we were told that it was to be worked upon just about we were sitting down.
Indoors - the music was too loud, the tables were ill cleaned, food bits and wipe marks remaining on the table and crumbs on the seats. After asking for recleaning it was done half heartedly. Food was just about ok we ordered tea, coffee and masala fries. Service was very lackadaisical. The only thing going for the place was decor. I'll never return to the place.

Just opposite to Vivekananda park, this lounge has quite an exclusive decor to attract all. It's situated on the terrace. There's an indoor section as well. But, the decor and ambience on the roof is what pleases one's eye the most. It's like a little heaven tucked away in the middle of this concrete jungle. Now, coming to the food and drinks, they are okayish. I really loved their Daydream mocktail. Their hookah's quite nice though everything's a bit overpriced. The ambience rocks. The best thing about this place is its ambience and the decor that's‚Äã sure to lure people to come over again.

I had heard a lot about it before and finally got the opportunity to visit it a few days back. Since it was raining we couldn't go for the roof top however the top floor is also well decorated. It is a hangout for young people specially those with a taste for hooka.
However we didn't take Hookah. We ordered a Cappuccino and an Ice Tea. Along with that we ordered a chicken Wings of fire. The tastes though fair enough were nothing special. We were there mainly to catch up with friends.
The downer was the too loud music and the very slow service. The servers were surprised at our not ordering hookah which i found disconcerting. Overall the service or the servers are not really good. I would highly recommend an upgrade in that. Otherwise a good place to hangout with friends with a beautiful feel. 
Want to try out the rooftop and see if the impression changes for the better.

Pathetic experience . My evening got spoiled as I went there. Will suggest no one to throw party there. The day before my party I went there for booking the table n to talk about discount n all some lady was there she was so nice to me n we agreed on a 15% dis. The day of my party, when party got over when I asked for the bill she gave me the bill with no dis on it. I asked her for the dis she just refused on my face and told me we haven't talked abt any kind of dis n said if bill would crossed 12 14k then she might provide us the dis, she lied on my face..n we had arguments n I was offered no discounts. 

We were the only people in the cafe not a single customer was there except us.. A big time NO for zucca lounge

Great place to be. Another rooftop cafe but this one is totally different. You will love this place the moment you step in. It has a white themed decor and furniture which gives a classy look during evening. I missed out on the food on both my visits so cannot comment on that. But given to what I have heard about the place, the food is delicious and great in taste. The prices are a bit expensive but that balances with the ambience and location. I would definitely recommend this place.

This place was bookmarked for a very long time and we were looking forward to this so much. However it was so disappointing. Firstly we wanted to sit upstairs but since no seat was available we sat downstairs and were told we would be shifted once there was a seat. When we gave our orders while we were sitting downstairs which in itself was a huge harassment because it took the waiter 30 mins to give us the menu and then he jumbled up our order. Our food was served and we kept asking if we could sit upstairs. They then informed us to clear our hills and then go to the rooftop. We cleared and then proceeded according to their advice and was treated very badly by the floor manager upstairs. We came down and reported this and then the lady accompanied us upstairs and we got a place where again ofcourse our orders were taken after 20-30 minutes. So inspite of being told we could shift as soon as a place was available upstairs, we had to undergo such a huge harassment and give orders at two different places and also pay tax twice. It os@ quite obvious that if you have a rooftop option and it is one of your main attraction, your customers will  want to avail that. If you as a manager cannot manage this and people has to undergo such harassment, the rating is pretty unjustified then. Also i think our government had introduced gst taxes applicable all over india everywhere, it was shocking that they charged us with vat, service tax, service charge inspite of going on 2nd July.

The place is very ill managed. The waiters made us wait 30 mins before cleaning the table then finally we were given a jumbled up order. The waiters misbehaved and said we could sit upstairs after we cleared our bill downstairs. When we went upstairs the floor manager said that we couldn't sit since a place where had previously seen people sit and leave as RESERVED. On raising the question about it, we were said that we were cold shouldered. It was a very humiliating experience. And never going back again.

To be honest, I went there only for some fresh air because I was in the neighborhood and feeling nauseous on the road all of a sudden.
And my, fresh air did I get.
The rooftop area is lovely, with cabanas and fairylights and fun music playing on the flat screen.
The space was maybe a tad bit crowded and the bathroom lock was dysfunctional (a girl was stuck in there for over 15 minutes while I was there, I kid you not.) But I'm sure that's resolved by now.
Ordered a thin-crust veg pizza and quite liked it.
I'm not a fan of veg food, though. So 3.5 for the food and 4 for the ambience! ‚ù§Ô∏è

This place boasts of lovely ambience and good food. Ideal place for youngsters specially if you visit there with your group of friends and also a romantic outing for couples too. The only cons about this place is that it is tad too expensive.But the Rooftop Ambience makes up for it though.

Location and ambience is nice, except that its too pricey and they charge a '5% service charge' over and above 'Service tax+VAT'. Also some kind of 'cover charge' exists for sitting in the tents, instead of the chairs at the terrace. The waiter warned us of Rs.500 charge if we opted to sit there, but didnt understand whether that was reimbursable with bill.

Went to this place with friends today. We sat on the third floor indoor section. Ambience was good,live sports screening was also available. Although the food was of good quality,the service was very slow.

We had gone their only for drinks. Haven't yet tried the food. We tried the Lychee Lemongrass Mocktail, Fresh Lime Soda and the one called Dreamland. I found the Lychee drink over sweet and the Fresh Lime a bit too pungent. Not the right balance of flavours. Ambience was nice.

Zucca, gives you a feeling of comfort. Since its a rooftop lounge you enjoy a great view.. the semi greenery and the open sky.. I really liked the mocktails there.. can't say the same for the food. Maybe what I ordered wasn't the best choice.. some cottage cheese stuff. But the mocktails were really refreshing. Id like to revisit this place and try some different food and hope not to get disappointed . üôÇ

Bad service. Bad food. Bad ambience. And the songs they play are the worst of all. Too expensive, not worth even at half the cost. Would never recommend anyone going here, better go to What's Up Cafe near by.

This place is peaceful paradise in a quiet locality and all white theme. Be it for a chit chat, a coffee date, a kitty party or any occasion, this place is it. 
The staff here are polite but a little laid back. The service is slow but the food makes ups for the long wait. The Burrito Indiana is a must try. It comes with French fries in cute little bucket and a dip. One can spend hours here. Worth a try! :)

Last year, we visited the place in the month of December, ordered hookah and a couple of refreshments and the bill was 750 rupees approx. 
But this year, a couple of months back 4 of us had visited the place and had ordered 
4 mojito mocktails (each costs 150 bucks as per latest menu) 
1 loaded nachos (amounting to 190 rupees)
1 exotic 3 paan flavored ice base hookah (worth 385 rupees) 
And just when you expect the bill to be around 1500-1600 rupees max with service tax, vat, krishi Kalyan and swach bharat tax (and whatever taxes you can think of) it came around to be exactly rupees 1999/-
Apart from the cool ambience, double standards do exist here. 
They also have a habit of charging your hookah for extra coal change even when you haven't done so. Watch out people!!

I had prebooked a table for 12 on a Sunday evening. I climbed upto the terrace and found the place quite empty. Beautifully arranged cabanas in white looked blissful in the evening. We placed ourselves in one of them fitting like a jigsaw puzzle. The sultry humid evening was a total downer. It becomes suffocating in the open with no breeze, and with the showers to accompany us, the weather became a total spoiler. We picked our dishes from a variety of offerings to suit our vegetarian palette.
Salt and pepper, duet of corn: American corn and babycorns tossed in mild spices, was crisp and not very oily. Loved it. We ordered it again.
Cheese garlic bread: It was plain good.
Western grill veg platter: The veggies were grilled perfectly, subtle spice and good in quantity.
Risotto ala fungi: I liked the mushroom risotto very much. Creamy and mushroomy. Balanced.
Aglio olio pasta: Was a tad bit dry and choking. Tasted more like hakka noodles.
Mixed sauce pasta: I didn't like this variant of pasta as well.
Trece spiced pizza: The pizza was crisp and the paneer was succulent but somehow the taste wasn't suiting my buds
Shanghai surprise pizza: same for this variant of pizza.
Carribean breeze smoothie: A nice, thick and slurpy yoghurt fruit smoothie. Loved it.
Virgin Mojito: Too much of ice but the taste was good
Watermelon mojito: Was nicely done
Oreo Shake: Thick and creamy, the way I like it.
Kiwi delight: was again very refreshing
3 paan rose shisha in ice base was amazingly done.

Altogether my experience was average. The starters and beverages were good but the main course was a bit off. Service was fine. The place looks beautiful.

Didn't try food as we had come here for Huqqa after dinner. The Huqqa is nice though it's a bit on the expensive side. 1 Huqqa, a red bull and a mocktail for Rs. 1300. The outdoor seating arrangement is really nice but we had to sit indoors Cz it was raining the day we visited. But the indoors is also nice and cozy:)

I visited this place twice, but¬† I will review this place based on my second visit. My first visit was during the Durga puja and as expected, it was over crowded and the terrible weather ensured that rooftop seating was not an option. Even the fish tossed in celery salt was a little too salty. However, when asked to change the dish, they were very polite and fixed it quite promptly. The second time, I visited with a friend on a quiet Saturday evening and ended up having a lovely time! The rooftop is not very spacious but the ambience is quite nice! The food deserves special mention because both the mocktails and the kabab (Lyulya kabab I think)¬† we ordered were surprisingly good! Just a pointer to the management about the music. Coke studio and hookah go great together! One direction and Selena Gomez, not that much . :p

I m in love with the ambience.. it is really good..and the food quality is really good. I tried only the panfried noodles and a hookah there. The quality of the hookah was great. And the food quality was too good. The roof top opens after 6pm. We sat in the indoors only. Yeah i gave 3.5 stars. Not 5 stars aas the behaviour of certain staffs were not good. Specially dere was a person in white shirt he was kind of rude. So not planning to visit the place again as it is the courtesy that drags u to some place.

This is the second and last time I visited *ZUCCA*
The first day I went with my girlfriend around two and a half weeks ago.
I was very much pleased with the ambience, which was 'The Roof top' and the service was ok type.
That was the first day I had visited any open roof cafe/restaurant in my life.
Being impressed I visited Zucca with 5 of my friends. Among them three were couple including me and one single boy.

Going on a open roof restaurant was the main reason to visit Zucca again with my friends, but this was a mistake I made on 17th of may, the day I visited for the second time.

Before going to Zucca, I had booked a table for 6 four days ago,but the staff said that there were no reservations in the name of us. Upon calling them I asked them that weather we can sit at the roof top if we visit the restaurant at 4:20pm. The manager said no, and after requesting him he said that we can but he will allow us at 5:45pm. We agreed and headed towards Zucca.

When we got there the staff was behaving very rudely from the beginning. We ordered 2 hookahs as of then, and planned to order the pizza after finishing the hookahs. 

The pizzas were delicious and tasty.
It is after 5:30, when the disaster took place!
*What was the disaster?*
The manager told me that they can't allow us to sit upstairs. Then I told him that at around 4pm, I had called him and requested him that I want to sit upstairs and that time he told me that they will allow us to sit upstairs at 5:45.
Then the manager told me that 'They will serve the foods downshift only, but we ourselves have to carry them to the roof and that we have to pay the bill first then!'
We had no option left, so we first paid the bill and then ourselves took the pizzas and hookahs to the rooftop.
They charged us ‚Çπ1,814 for 2 hookahs and 2 non-veg pizzas, which seemed a bit pricey for us, but that didn't mattered us.
What mattered us is that *ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CARRY AND SERVE OUR FOOD OURSELVES? ARE WE SUPPOSED TO PAY OUR BILL BEFORE CONSUMING AND RECEIVING THE FOOD? AND IS THIS THE WAY THE MANAGER WILL BEHAVE WITH US?* The manager was too arrogant, and he was following us everywhere. He even changed his working position ,i.e he came to the rooftop when we shifted there.
Why was he discriminating us so much? Why didn't he allowed us rooftop, even though persons were there already.
In case of ambience, I really liked the bed type seating for groups on the rooftop, but the service is awful. 
I had gone to WHAT'S UP also which is near ZUCCA only, but the service there was much better.
Sorry Zucca, but you have missed one of your customer.
Just like I had suggested my friends and relatives earlier, now I'll not do the same.
This was the first time any cafe behaved so rudely to us.
Poor Cafe!

This is located in southern avenue, easy to spot and the indoor sitting area is on 3rd floor while rooftop is just the floor above. Rooftop opens up around 6pm, prior to that it's just a selfie/picture zone and smoking area.
I liked both indoor and outdoor interiors, the indoors are laminated wooden finishes while the rooftop gives a calm and soothing atmosphere with all white theme.
The place buzzes mostly with young college going crowd, as they are having good deals on barbeque, food and sheesha. The happy hour timing is from 12.00-05.00 pm where selected food and mocktails come at 101 INR.
I visited with couple of friends where we ordered for sheesha, assorted fries basket, amritsari fish and frozen iced margarita (strawberry).
The fish was nicely coated and fried and the fries were also soft with a crispy spicy exterior. The quantity reduction strategy in happy hours is something which I personally don't support. Apart from this everything else was agreeable.
Coming to the service, it was a bit slow but the server's were prompt and helpful. The songs collection is updated and they have a big screen, good music system to keep the crowd entertained.

Zucchini lounge is placed in a quiet corner of Southern Avenue near vivekanda park and is essentially is sports pub specially during the IPL season having a roof top and  a normal lounge in the 3rd floor. The place is pretty neat with limited fancy decor. The hookah and food is okay and it's best to go in there during the happy hours which will give you the best rates else pocket pinch could be a little much specially with nothing outstanding to offer. However chances of being disappointed is also less as the restaurants does get the basic right. The spiced corn dusted chicken gets a special mention.

As usual my last Friday was a drag ‚Äì I was sitting in my 20‚Äô/20‚Ä≤ cubicle and writing a useless piece of code on my desktop to fulfill my client‚Äôs requirements which was not clear to me. It was 5:15 pm on my wrist watch which runs 10 minutes ¬†fast and suddenly my screen busted lumia 540 started ringing making me pray ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt let the clients call at this time. I wanna go home early.‚Äù. The name that flashed was Sarksoh TCS(He is my friend cum colleague ‚Äì Soham Sarkar), I picked up the call and¬†started packing my bags as no sooner the call was complete. My friend asked me to accompany him to Zucca Lounge located at¬†¬†Southern Avenue, Kolkata.

Ambience is the sole thing that attracts crowds over here. Of course the food fine. Being a non-drinker, I choose my coolers from mocktails section. When I zeroed on to the mocktail, afterglow little did I know it would be almost flavourless! It tasted like ice cold water with very little flavours. It was a big disappointment for me. But  the risotto primavera and the wings of fire( bbq chicken) were very nice. The ambience is something that will blow your mind. And if you manage to get hold of a cabana during sunset you'll simply admire the beauty! Do visit for the ambience!

One of the best rooftop lounge in south Kolkata. Specially after the sunset with lights and comfy sofas and curtains make the environment magical. Coming to the food part. Pizzas are delicious. Mocktails are not bad, above average I'd say.

I really fail to understand the pricing strategy of today's so called lounges that have Hookah !! I do not take hookah and this review is minus it !

Ambience :
We went there yesterday night for dinner along with 3 more couples n small children to the the terrace. The cabanas are well made, but have just one fan around it and so u might just feel hot most of the time while having ur food!!

Service: We were a total of 10 people but were always served 5-6 plates n same number of spoons! I thought they should have given atleast 10 of each! 

Food: Only the soups tasted good, rest none of the things we had, such as Nachos, Babycorn, Cheese toast, Pizza, Pasta, Veg Green Thai Curry was exceptional or very good.

Pricing: All things come at a price and we were highly disappointed with the Pricing compared to the quality of food and portion size of the food. Our group has an average appetite but we were just no where close to our usual selves yesterday and yet the experience costed us 1500 bucks per couple without any hookah or liquor! It would have easily costed us much more compared to the any of Kolkata's Fine Dining restaurants! I did not have of that kind of experience in terms of ambience, food quality, food quantity and service and so wonder how do these cafes manage to price such grandly!


PS: Water seems to have become the biggest source of extra revenue for today's lounges and Zucca leads in this as well ; )

When you enter the lounge, they ask you if you'd like to opt for the open roof area - always choose that, if there's vacancy.

Ordered a risotto-ala-fungi that had my favourite mushrooms in it and I loved it. Tired out the melon based antioxidant which tasted okay-ish.
Personally, I liked this place a bit too much (probably more because of the backdrop in the open area - went on clicking-spree) üòÅ

The roof top place is best to be visited during the wintery noons and dusk. Nice hang out zone with friends and partner with a clause. Better not think of visitng the cubicle of the place with your partner unless you wish to make a bill of 2k. The cubicles are mainly designed for accomodating a group. The managing authority didn't allow us to sit at the cubicles as we didn't wish to bill for a 2k. Food is suited as side dishes for hookah. If you are a foodie, you won't enjoy the kebab zucca platters (although meant for 2, quantity served for 1). Though with a lot of pros and cons you can always check out to cater to your taste.

I went here with my best friend and the ambience was just so apt.  The interiors of this place is so dreamlike and perfect especially the outside seating area with the white curtain drapes and cozy sofas and also jute swings.  The place has got the yummiest pizza ever.  Loved the food.  I would really recommend this place for the winter evenings as in summer one would not be properly be able to enjoy the outside seating area.  The service is good.  Very cool music.  And they also have a huge projecter so a great place to watch the match together with friends/family!

The pizza was good bt the quantity was not sufficient! To all those who are planning to dig this place on the near future i must suggest you guys to try their kiwi delight!

Perfect place for friend groups ,romantic dates. The decor is awesome. We were here to celebrate a birthday and we had a bash. We ordered risotto , alpine style rosti and burrito . All three were brilliant and extremely tasty. We tried a beverage "Oreo Poppers" which was mouth smacking and the best oreo shake i had had till now. The mood set there was so jolly that we enjoyed to our best. we got the sofa seating reserved before hand. I would surely go again as many times as possible. Its a bit pocket-unfriendly. Highly recommended.

A perfect place to go for a romantic date with your special one but today I went there with my group of school friends. It's a nice place for a reunion as well. The ambiance is really great with wooden floor, white curtains and rooftop view with amazing playlist at the backdrop. The staffs were decent and was taking care of their customers well. Coming to hookah we had ordered blueberry sheesha with spring water as suggested by one of their experts. Then from food we had crispy chilly babycorn, healthy bite pizza and from beverages went for zucca classic mojito, zucca tropical harvest smoothie and buck's nursery fizz. The prices are on the higher side as compared to the portions given.

The beautiful this place looks on zomato the worst is their service and their conduct with the customer.

Once we walked in the terrace and found the rooftop full, I politely asked the staff on duty if there was any possibility to get a table for two anytime soon. Surprisingly no one was ready to attend and on repeatative attempts the staff reluctantly replied, maybe an hour!

We settled in, on the next floor and tried to speak to the manager about the same to which she arrogantly replied that it would take more than 3-4 hours. I have never seen some one this impolite so far. I wonder if they value their customers!
Well that's not the end.. Once we ordered a hookah the waitor told us, suddenly they are serving hookah at INR500 and not at INR 375 as their menu reads. The funniest part was when I asked for a reason they had no answer to that. There was no notice/circular anywhere around the lounge and very convincingly the manager also said that it was just the verbal communication they are having with every customer who are ordering hookah. I mean why do we believe you? Also very confidently the manager added that the change in the menu would reflect from 1st of March. How do people get something into practice when they have not yet rolled out the changes on paper?

If I walk into the market and the salesman asks me to pay something higher the price of what the tag says will I pay the excess amount? Of course not. I wonder how do people agree to pay their hard earned money for unjustified reasons.

It was a sad experience. I would recommend all the readers to try a place where the customers are valued.

This place fulfills your desire of a romantic dinner on a rooftop. It was dimly lit and the faint sound of music created a beautiful ambience. The little private sitting places are comfortable and perfect for a romantic evening. We opted for the live barbeque cheesy chicken kebab for our starters. The kebab was served with two different sauces and made for a delicious bite. Cheese was oozing out from the juicy chicken but the only disappointment was that the food wasn't grilled in front of us, so I just feel that 'live barbeque' is not the term that can be associated with it. For the mains we ordered Gaeng Kiaw wan, Chicken Cacciatore, Texas Stand off Pizza and Risotto Ala Fungi. Gaeng kiaw wan is basically Thai green Curry with steamed rice. The green curry was creamy, aromatic and flavorful just how I like my green curry. It had right amount of all the Thai ingredients like lemongrass and is one of the best green curries that I have had till now. Chicken cacciatore was chicken steak and it was really good. The Texas style stand off Pizza had a thin and crispy crust and the toppings tasted really good. The rissotto was creamy, rich and the flavour of the aged cheddar was very prominent. I loved all the dishes and would like to come back and try out the other dishes.

The ambience of this place is the main attraction. Although I didn't sit in the rooftop area, it looked very spacious and comfortable. Risotto ala Fungi tasted good but the quantity felt a bit less for the price. I condoned that, since I was paying for the ambience as well. The brain freezer hookah with red Bull base was amazing. I'm not a huge hookah fan and do it only occasionally, but this one felt really good. I am willing to recommend this place to anyone who is searching for a sophisticated yet fun place to hang out.

Went there yesterday. Worse place to be. First of all they don't provide the complete info on their page, i.e, the outdoor seating is to be booked before hand and they wont allow you to seat there without any price! Misleading people thinking they would go and enjoy the outdoor seating and ending up disappointed. And next when you reach there and compromise on seating and somehow adjust in that small dim place you would find out hookah price to be 4 times more than that in the menu. Sad part is when I called them to ask if hookah is available they told me yes it is with no further information on price(i guess they think that's not important). And next comes the manager who will give you a nice attitude saying "That's the price everywhere". Unfortunately she is unaware of the day that other hookah bars like Cafe 360 gives you hookah at the same price given in the menu with no extra cost(without taking any advantage of hookah ban).
The manager instead of apologizing covers her mistake by showing attitude.

The worst lounge Ever.
Firstly they don't allow us to sit in the outdoor seating.
Secondly, instead of hookah being band from the city these people are offering hookah that too at a very high Rate ( normal-265, they asked for 1000).
On calling they provide you with wrong information and mislead the pupil@.
The manager as well as the staff behaved badly with us. Instead of apologizing they had a queer attitude of God knows what.
Worst place to visit.
Never visit this place.
Even the lounge was unhygenic and dirty.

The rooftop is the USP of this place. The logic of a lounge bar playing high pitched music escapes me. The service leaves a lot to be desired for. Had noodles, chilli chicken, tandoori platter. The Tandoori platter was tasty with the chicken portions and prawn standing out. I also tried a watermelon drink which was very very refreshing with small scoops of watermelons.

Located very near to Vivekananda Park in Southern Avenue.We reached the restaurant at 12.45 but there was no one to receive us. Then we found an a/c which wasn't working so we had to opt for the steps to reach to the 3rd floor where the rooftop is located and that was quite annoying.Then when we reached to the rooftop we found the sight amazing. That was quite a spacious place with some sofas and 4 bed like sitting arrangements were also there. What we loved the most was a 'dolna' and that was really cute.

We ordered :  A tandoori platter and a Chowmein platter with chicken....
The service was very late and the chowmein platter came almost after 40 minutes. But we enjoyed the time by clicking pictures as there was no one except us. The quantity of this item was less as compared to the price and tasted nothing special. It was tasted mostly like gravy chowmein with lots of veggies and a small amount of chicken cubes. 
Then after another 45 minutes they served us with the tandoori platter. This platter consisted of chicken, prawn, fish and mutton with 2 kind of dips. We really liked this platter....

Then  we ordered : 3 mocktails, namely Daydream, Jack frost, and Zucca classic mojito....
The mojito tasted bland. Daydream was actually orange flavoured juice nothing amazing.
We didn't like jack frost as it tasted like medicine. 
We had to pay Rs.1800 for the food that we found a bit expensive.
We only enjoyed the lovely atmosphere of the place and the tandoori platter. Other than these two things nothing was really good about this place. 
The service was not good at all, very slow and they didn't have a clear idea about their own recipes.

So if you want a romantic dine in with your loved ones or special friends then I would suggest you that place otherwise not.......

The ambience is absolutely amazing, specially if one goes after sunset, when the place gets lit up beautiful. It is one of the foremost romantic destinations and the open terrace adds to the charm of the place. The classic club sandwich was an absolute delight and the Zucca-classic mojito was extremely refreshing. The music however could have been a little better with mostly Honey Singh and Badshah being played on the LED screen. But once one has the food and you stare into the distance to see the beauty of Kolkata on a leisurely evening, all of that is swiftly forgiven. Overall a 5/5 for me.

I had heard quite a lot about this until I finally went down to Southern avenue with a guest whom I had brought along. I had heard about Zucca and it's much talked about cabana styled decor up on the roof.
 It was winters so I had hoped to get a table on the rooftop since it was just the two of us. I gave them a call before hand hoping I would be able to get a prior reservation. They did not take reservations. I went in with a positive note but to my utter disappointment the tables and cabanas were prebooked and was full. I came down. These guys assured me that it I would definitely get a table for two in no time, which by the way did not happen. I visited Zucca a few months later, hoping my luck would work on my favour the second but the same thing happened. 
The food and drinks are just about okay. I will not go back to Zucca again. I was disappointed a couple of times. :(

They have an open terrace lounge which has a simple yet classic white decor. On the other hand their indoor seating decor is quite urban and trendy. It even has a couple of board games for fun interactive group hangouts. 
Everything I've tried there so far i.e their chocolate shake to peach iced tea, chilly baby corn, chicken to pizza. All of it tastes really good. The only negative being that their food service is too slow. 
In terms of the music they play, if you're lucky then you'll get to hear some good music. Otherwise it's going to be just another evening of Honey Singh and Badshah.

Zucca has already cemented its place as one of the prefered hotspots for romantic dates and memorable time with the special one.. Easily trackable being close to Vivekananda Park, this is the next big thing in the cullinary map of south Kolkata.. Zucca scores on its delghtful ambiance and aesthetic settings.. The roof-top view will just blow you away on a b reezy evening sitting on one of the specialized cubicles doned with big, white curtains maintaining your privacy..
We were seated in the indoor section as they had some parties in the rooftop that day.. This one was also innovatively designed with wooden compartments separating the tables and the top of the compartments with inter-woven rags.. Dim lighting and the cosy sofas add to the mood.. Service is however quite lackluster and the servers seemed a bit inept in handling guests during the busy hours.. We found the menu interestingly curated and ordered the following:
Key South Cooler: Coconut milk, chocolate syrup and sugar syrup punched and topped with a banana cube on a skewer.. slightly on the more sweeter side but not bad per se..
Passion Fruit Mojito: Virgin mojito blended with passion fruit syrup..this one tasted way better..
Fish Tossed in Celery Salt: Pan fried fish tossed in celery, garlic and tomato.. crisp,crunchy and tasteful..
Xacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken: Chicken supremes crumb fried with a slightly soury taste.. the chicken felt a bit stiff and rubbery.. may be overfried a bit..
Gambas Al Ajillo: This one was the best of the lot.. jumbo prawns in a sauce base tossed with spring onions and garlic.. the dish was presented quite innovatively with the boiled prawn heads also served..
Overall, its a nice experience for a first timer and the food was surprisingly better than you would expect from a newbie.. Only thing I felt may be they can add a bit more variety in their food menu to suit the varied taste-buds.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1737/- (all incl.) for 2 people.. So people looking for inspiration for a cosy,romantic time look no further..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Considering a roof top cafe cheap lighting completely spoiled the ambiance of the place.
Food was average and slightly overpriced.Options are also very limited.
The music was horrible typical punjabi songs on loop mode!!there should be a cosmopolitan mix to suit everyone's music taste...this isnt a dhaba!!

Went there during the Christmas celebrations:

Ambiance: They have two versions roof top and inside. We dint get chance to sit at rooftop but did visit it. The place looked bright and fancy. On the other hand the inside place looked dim and more of a pub kind of. They have a huge projector screen playing some cool music videos. 

Food: We order two cold coffees zucca cookie butter and cocoa island. And we opted for xacuti spiced corn chicken with paan ras hookah. I didn't like both the cold coffee. A normal amul cool tastes better than that. Also, not much variety you will get on coffee. Xacuti spiced chicken was good and quantity wise it was sufficient for 2. Hookah was well prepared. We could taste the flavour over a longer time. But it lasted comparatively less. We had too change the charcoal earlier than expected.

Service: I think service could have been bit fast and waiters to be more attentive. I saw many customers had to go to the counter and ask for waiters. But they did took care of the needs when called for.


For hookah this place is nice! But I would love to see them with more coffe variants and food items if they have no plans to come up with alcohol.

This hookah parlour has a rooftop and an indoor sitting arrangement. The rooftop decor is the best though with white coloured curtains and cushions.
They serve amazing hookahs and some pretty special types and flavors which are very hard to find in other hookah parlours in Kolkata

This place has a beautiful blend of ambience and good food! I ordered cheese chicken bbq and it was super tasty. The chicken was literally melting in the mouth. For main course I ordered thai green curry with steamed rice, texas stand off pizza, risotto a la fungi and chicken cacciatore (this was for four people). All the four mentioned dishes tasted really good. The service is alright and the staff is friendly enough. I would love to visit this place again!!!!!!

Went on the 25th Dec evening for a Hooka, the place was jam packed, luckily we scored a placed in 5 minutes, the ambiance is real nice with its white sofa‚Äôs , festive lighting and large projector screen playing the latest music videos. Special mention goes to the open rooftop ambiance, it‚Äôs great for a Hooka join. We got seating in the sofa area and had our own little space but felt it would have been too cramped on the other side of us with tables & chairs stuffed in a small area. The Hooka was nice but noting great, the food on the other hand tasted great, we had ordered a pizza which was yum, the nachos were also good. Won‚Äôt mind going to the place again but its not among my must do places.

Located in the Posh area of southern Avenue beside Vivekananda Park. 
Zucca has already made a name of itself in the area.  
The ambience is wonderful. has both 3rd and 4th floor. I usually like seating in the 4th floor as it is rooftop.  
Both Chairs seatings as well as the couch are comfartable.  
Food are delicious and Not very overpriced.  Hookah are equally wonderful and has varieties. 
The watermelon mojito is must.  

Service are no doubt very friendly.

Been to this place on Saptami, 2016 night. Most of the places were full. Somehow this one didn't attract much crowd. Probably due to a bit odd location. We entered around 12:30am and stayed till 2:30am. The stuff were quite cordial to welcome us at that odd hour.
We took rooftop option. The decorations were modern and in all white. We took a few drinks and few flavours of hookah. The ambiance felt quite nice at that hour. Pricing was at par with any other cafe. So not much to comment there.

Pros:
1. Ambiance..Rooftop needs special mention.
2. Cordial stuff.

Cons:
1. Odd location. Difficult to find.

Excellent d√©cor and ambiance, everything else is above average but nothing to write home about. The drinks are fun and enjoyed the banana and chocolate milkshake and the Oreo cookie shake. The hookah I  was told was rather nice . The music is not the best and we were treated to a barrage of Punjabi remixes. The place works really well for young people so be prepared to feel a bit of out of place

The idea that day was to have breakfast someplace good, watch Dangal 1st day 1st show and come back to the campus. But as expected, we could not wake up for the breakfast bit so hence went for the movie directly. Once the movie was over, we were trying to figure out a place where we could have lunch, we had continental on our mind. Finally after a walk of around 2 kms,¬†we land up at this place. What a find it was!¬†

Ambiance and interiors are amazing. The way they have set this place up is amazing. The walls, the seating arrangments all were very cool. ¬†Though a big let down was the staff. Frankly, I found them very clumsy. So since it was a new place for all of us, so we took help from the Zomato reviews and ordered the following:

1. Brain Freezer Hookah : Avoid. We were coughing like crazy after a few drags. We asked them to rectify it but they too could not do anything.

2. Flavored Mojitos : One with the green apple was refreshing but the one with water melon was a disaster. The water melon¬†juice in my mess is served better than this.

3. Lychee Fantasy: Good drink!¬†

4. Oreo Poppers: Again not as good as other shakes like this we had before

5. Pan Fried Noodles: Awesomely cooked and good quantity. Do try this out.

6. Mama Rosa: Pasta in mixed sauce. Good taste and filling.

7. Burrito Indiana: We thought it to be a burrito but it turned out to be an Indian roll

8. Trece Spiced Veg Pizza: Filling but nothing extraordinary

The presentation of the food was nice and they served the food quickly (it may be the case that we were the only customer at that point of time). They play good music and they have a screen for matches and all which they screen on and off. ¬†The terrace seating area is also good and I believe that I could come back here for dinner someday to see how it looks from up there.

I made them change it twice because I didn't like it at all,so they offered us to wait for the third. As I had though, the waiting wasnt worth it! On a disappointing note we made them cancel the order. The Food was average,mocktails were good but very less quantity.

the first and the only problem we had nd the reason behind this 1 star is as follows...we went there in the afternoon...there was not a single customer around...we went up and took a seat which was for groups...all the seats were empty though and they already have more seats like that...now we sat there by their permission only...suddenly a Man came out of nowhere and told us we have to leave the seat if any group arrives...now here lies the problem...it was okay if they had requested...but they sort of ordered us...nd they actually forgot that whatevar their cafe is about, the cafe is running only becoz of customers...nd they just had no courtsey to talk nicely...i hope this review will have some effect and the management will look after it properly...after all if it happened to any other friend of mine then he would have done the same...nd we didnt have nething nd just left...nd the funniest part is they didnt even bother to aak us wat happend...ridiculous that is!!

Located in Southern Avenue, this place has a classy ambience. It has both rooftop and indoor sections. The rooftop is BEAUTIFUL! White seating arrangements, white curtains and white tables all together look so magnificent! There's also a pretty wooden swing in one corner. 
The indoor section is equally good. We sat inside as on the roof it was quite hot. We ordered for Oreo shake and a Gum-Supari flavour hookah. Oreo shake was perfectly made...but the hookah needs to be improved. Initially smoke wasn't good, although it bettered after the coal change.
There was nice music..and service was fine too. Worth a try!

This review is based on several visits to the place.. I have ordered for their pizza, the Trece Spiced pizza is what I have had most of the times. I really like this pizza, though it's a little spicy, but the choice of making it less spicy can always be told to them. 
I liked the ambience on their terrace..Hookah consistency varies with each visit,sometimes they do a good job but sometimes they are just average with it, become a little consistent with it, you have been into the business for quite some time now. 
Service needs to buck up a little, including the music collection. 
I look forward to see you all improve your service soon üòÄ

I finally made to this place on a Saturday evening. The roof top cafe with a lovely cabana section had tempted me to pay a visit. But you need to have a group of 5 to 6 people to get seated on the cabana. Good to see that they had a numerous hookah options to choose from. Quite a few interesting food items as well. Being a coffee lover o took up the cafe latte along with 13 spiced Pizzatta, and a mix of Kiwi with sparkling water hookah. The pizza was pretty good n so was the hookah coffee &  entire ambience.Staff was cordial. Music was random mostly playing latest Bollywood and Hollywood numbers. Nice place to chill with your friends under the open sky keeping aside all the hustle bustle of the city. A cool place to host a party as well only if you are interested go without alcohol !!! One plus point for a neat n clean wash room!

We went in the evening to the fourth floor of this place which was open air with cozy chairs and those curtained bed type seating arrangements strewn over the terrace. We sat on one of the high chairs and ordered a Caf√© latte and a Pan Rasna Hookah (our main motive was to just chill, not eat) and potated there for a while. It was a spontaneous plan so we weren't expecting much. There was a large projector screen with Coke Studio songs on so that sort of added to the breezy, relaxed ambience. The service was prompt. The coffee was good and the the Hookah was up to the mark (not an enthusiast) Later in the evening the songs started to get a more dance-y twist with the rappers taking over so we left then. Really not much to judge on. Good place to relax.

It was such a horrible experience....we ordered jacket potatoes with chili cheese and garlic bread but was served with a single piece plain toast. On repeated requests,they were still reluctant. However after almost 20mins they finally came up with a piece of garlic bread and by that time the jacket potato was cold enough to add more towards the already spoiled mood. However they did take the pain to reheat the food for us. The tomato sauce pasta had enough salt to provide you with a months %DV(daily value) in a single day üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

I am a big fan of Roof Tops, specially when its Winters.
This place is beautiful. This place has the perfect playlist of songs and offers good Hookah.
Since it has a limited menu for food, you cannot really visit it when you are very hungry. 
The best here is choclate Oreo Shake to drink.
Jacket Potato was not really tasty and also very heavy.
The next was their rolls (some chef special) stuffed with cottage cheese and several other Masalas :p which was veryy Tasty. 

The Rating 4.5 is because of the limited Menu that they have.
Overall it has good Interiors, drinks, hookah, food and playlist.

Though our first time experience was little different as we didn't get seats on d terrace and d cabannas were all reserved.

A good place for winter evening out. Though we didn't get seat on terrace as chair-seating were all occupied and cabanas were reserved. It was definitely a let down to see the reserved cabanas as we planned to seat there only. To get the rooftop seats we waited in 3rd floor cafe area. After an hour on asking them once again they said - 'we can go to terrace seats are available' though they told us we will be informed as soon as seats were available there. Apart from that everything is great. Food drink ambience everything. Will visit next time reserving the cabana.

I stay near Southern Avenue & am both excited & worried at the mushrooming of eateries around and the dubious honour of our area becoming the second Food Street of Kolkata !¬†
Zucca has been in my bucket list for awhile and I took 5 family members on a special occasion for dinner this week. I wish I had not.¬†

We got the cabana we had booked. My expectation of views were not met, as the views from the Alfresco space, are only if you stand at the railing and not from any table - belying the expectation of a roof top venue.¬†

The service was the worst possible. In starters, an Oriental non veg platter was delivered 70 minutes after being ordered and half the items there were cold ! Dinner took more than 45 minutes to be served and by then we had asked if we should cancel and leave. The service personnel were consistently vague about the delays.¬†

I asked for drinking water & a single glass was given to a table of 6 diners. After I asked for more water - I was told they only serve mineral water. On being asked why, we were told they don't use purifier and the normal drinking water is straight from the tank, and for good measure the person pointed upwards to the tank !! Imagine my plight - I was being blithely told that I had been served tank water, which I had by then finished ! If I had the time, I would sue.¬†

Some of the food items - garlic mushroom starter & the green Thai curry were good & fresh. But the delay and service quality were just unacceptable. Possibly this is more a hookah & cafe place and not meant for serious or senior diners. I wish I had gone elsewhere.

This is a very beautiful rooftop lounge with open sitting arrangement as well as some beautiful cabanas which are ideal for romantic dates. üòç
The food here is totally lip smacking and the presentation is good enough.
We had taken Xacuti corn dusted chicken which tasted good.
The house special chicken wrap which came with a small bucket of finger chips was bliss.
The best was Borito grilled fish which came with a beaker of cream.
For drinks we took Oreo poppers,Jack's mocktail and Fresh lime soda.
Oreo poppers was love. ‚ù§
The staffs are very friendly.
The only drawback is they do not provide with normal drinking water only packaged water. üòï

This 2.5 is only for the ambience and hookah...Well good shisha is not difficult to find in Kolkata these days. However, the food and service was extremely disappointing. The rooftop is an amazing place if you like quiet and cozy space with good music. However the staff said clearly dont order this item on the menu coz either it doesnt tastes good or it isnt available!!

The food wasnt either anything great... I had taken a friend who was new to Kolkata and it was an extreme disappoinment.. hence, I wouldnt pay only for the ambience..!!

Went on 12/11/2016 the place is nice for a relaxed evening. But it is overpriced. I went with my gf and asked if we can sit in the covered cabanas (the place was mostly empty) but the staff said that cabanas are for minimum 4 people. But later on we saw another couple was easily allowed to sit there...why this partiality??
We ordered mixed sauce penne pasta, Margarita pizza and oreo poppers shake.
The quantity should also be increased as it was too less. Food was ok nothing extraordinary.
They also have projector screening and play some really nice song videos this was the best part.

Zucca lounge, situated at southern avenue is one of the prettiest cafes I have been to in town. Beautifully decorated, the classy interiors is eye pleasing and heart soothing. Mouthwatering dishes with a wide range of menu, friendly staff and amazing ambience is what zucca serves to its customers.
Hence it is a must visit advice to everyone who is still looking for a good place. Zucca is ‚ù§

Visited this place on the diwali eve 2days back.. and I was simply blown away by the mind blowing rooftop seating arrangements.. but unfortunately the entire rooftop was booked for some party that day :(.. so we sat downstairs which also had a supercool ambience!
We ordered butter garlic fish, Texas pizzeta, grilled fish with herb rice, one jack frost.. the butter garlic fish was undoubtedly the best.. highly recommended! Other dishes were fantastic as well.. and Mr.jack frost was unbelievably amazing!!
This place is also well known for its fabulous hookahs..
Prices are quite reasonable and waiters are very friendly.. and also, they play the most awesome playlists in the background!
Overall a perfect place to hang out with group of friends or your special one( book a rooftop table in that case!)

So, it was my best friend's birthday and i was totally confused for the venue.
I was going through zomato and came across this lounge "ZUCCA".
Just through the pictures i decided to come here only as i was finding the rooftop's ambience classyüòç
And it was actually very classy from the ambience to the food it was just amazingüòç
The staff was very much co-operative and was very humble.
I had ordered masala fry, thai spiced chilly babycorn, risotto, healthy bite pizza. All of them were just amazing.
Over all the service was good and the ambience gave me the perfect setup for my bestie's birthday.
In love with this placeüòç
One of my friend even said that the ambirnce looks like one YASH RAJ BANNER'S film setüòÇ
Way too classy üíú

Highly disappointed 
1st we went at 4 pm on a friday and was denied of happy hours saying that they discontinued happy hour services.
The day was 28th october at 4o clock
I have been to n number of places but this really was a disappointment
I would not recommend anyone to go here and would ask zomato to enquire from the restaurant before giving deals as such.

A very hyped place. 
The day we went, we were told it has cover charges to sit in the compartment that they have put in the terrace, which is not for other lounges, which have the same terrace service. 
Coming to food, its over priced and quantity is not good enough. We had ordered pan fried noodles, which tasted not less than vegetables on waai waai.
The pasta on the other hand was better. 
When we had asked for water, the waiter said he shall be back with it. After half an hour, that too after we asked again, he said that  water bottles needs to be bought . The service is poor, and have lack of knowledge about their own terms and services. 
The two items, cost us 1.2k.

This is a nice joint with a rooftop view and ambiance in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the city. The food served is quite delicious so to say and they offer a good variety to suit every palate. The servers are extremely cordial in their behaviour towards the customers which is always welcoming P.S the oreo shake is to die for. All in all a good and quaint place to spend some time with someone or in solitude.

A really good place to chill with friends. The rooftop has the perfect romantic ambience for a date with the music playing at the right volume and a classy white decor. The AC cafe on the 3rd floor is also well decorated and comfortable. 
The place is not too expensive yet not too pocket friendly either. 
The food items are delicious and are served quickly. 
Mocktails are refreshing. 
Must try : Oreo Poppers.

First and foremost i will begin with the fact that the lounge looks expensive but will not burn a hole in your pocket. The ambience is out of the world awsome. They have two sitting area one indoor and another outdoor. The indoor area has beautiful decor with wooden flooring and funky posters. The indoor also boasts of a huge screen n amazing music system. The outdoor is a big no no for sultry summer days but will be quite a will be quite a welcome during winter evenings in kolkata. The cabana is beautiful but u have bring a big group to ensure entry there though the staffs were extremely considerate to allow three of us in the 8 seater cabana the day we first visited. As to food well they are quite tasty.  We had oreo poppers texan pizza (i guess thats the name) blueberry flavoured hookah n 3 paan rose in ice base (this was on second visit we had). I will love to visit this place soon again. Will be uploadn allll the pics. And yes its a lil bit difficult to find the location but the effort is worth the treat u r in for.

This rating is just for the ambience Zucca has, and for nothing else. Hookah is decent. Food is really disappointing. Portion size is too less and price too high, taste even worse. The decor & ambience of the place are the only pros.. It's got an European feel. But that's it.

This place is slightly away from the main road on southern avenue. They serve awesome food. We took chicken tandoori and another chicken wings of fire. It was tasty. We also took Jack frost which was okayish. The coco island was tasty. Well the service was slightly not up to the mark. That was kind of a turn off.

Went there On 7th Oct 2016 Sasti Night.

Ambience: Awesome the decore is very Romantic only sometimes there up bit music kills the mood. They need to improve there music. The Roof top Cabanas are just awesome. Better to make reservations before you go. The stuff here is really great and very helpful...
The price of food here is a bit High..

The Food:

BEVERAGES/ DRINKS I HAD:
1. Passion Fruit Moijito : Awesome in taste and very refreshing. It seems to wash ones tiredness away and sets the mood for starters. Though taste a bit like our classic nimbu pani but with a twist.

2. Zucca Classic Moijito: Really liked it and ir also acts a nice palet cleanser.. with a refreshing feel to it.

3. Zucca Signature : It is better to avoid this drink at all cost. It makes one stomach feel full and heavy. Not good at all

STARTERS:
1. LYULYA KEBAB: Taste is good especially with the green chatney they serve it with. But the quantity is less as compared to its pricing.

2. Zucca Style Jacket Potatoe: Its Potatoes Stuffed with Cheese and deep fried and has a crispy skin on it.

3. Thai Spiced Mapo Chicken: It seemed liked my old favorite Chilli Chicken with a bit twist and a bit juicer, though I enjoyed it alot.

The Main Course:
1. Arrabiata : Its awesome loaded with chicken and cheese and pasta which just melts in a mouth a must have.

2. Healthy Bite Pizza: It is a thin crust pizza nice to taste.loaded with Cheese and apt amount of chicken. It is good didn't Find it remarkable may be becoz I'm not a big fan of pizza.

DESSERT:
#Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream & Chocolate Sauce:
This has always been my all time Favorite. But its was Fabulous here. The Brownie was really soft and loaded with chocolate and the ice was fluffy and the Combination was Heavenly Though would have been happier if it had a bit more chocolate sauce.
Honeybee Kushal - Thanx for such an awesome evening & Treat

Southern Avenue is now flooded with new cafe and lounges. Well this place was really welcoming on a Sunday evening. With several hookah flavors I saw this place is really crowded with youngsters. And live band added to the leisurely feel. I ordered chicken wings with barbecue sauce and chocolate shake and mojito. I was little taken back with bananas in my chocolate shake..but overall the food was good and pocket friendly. The only recommendation will be some more dishes in the non vegetarian section will certainly be a good crowd puller. Recommended to all

After a really long time loved the food in a newly opened place in Kolkata, hands down! Starting from their nibblers to their pizzas to their drinks.. all were very very good. Opt for their milk shakes only if you have a sweet tooth, rather quite a few sweet teeth! ;)
Ambience is lovely, be it the roof top or the covered AC area. This definitely is my go to place now.
Visit highly recommended.

I personally did not like this place at much. And the rooftop is not that comfortable if the weather is kinda humid. Which was how i felt when i went there. They dont have any wall fan or anything like that to provide comfort to us. The hookah we ordered was brain freezer with milk base and it was good. That was the only thing i liked. The drinks we ordered was Jack frost which tasted so bad, that i had to order another one. We ordered for a zucca caramel milkshake or something like that and it lacked sweetness. I liked the designings but that wont score much marks.

Situated near the Vivekanada Road, near Fillers, Zucca is the new name in the lounge specialty joints. The interior decor, though not striking enough, but still is very well decorated and well-lit. Indoor seating area is on the third floor and is very cool, well lit and properly air conditioned. 

Coming to the rooftop-which is a specialty of this place, there are four cabanas, well decorated, very classy looking and very breezy. The open air seating arrangement just adds to the flavor of this place. The hookahs we ordered were as the staff's suggestion which was green apple and it was very good and moderately priced. Chilli Garlic Mushroom had very average taste and very less in quantity. At times, the rooftop can get a bit hot in absence of air, but they had an arrangement of big stand-fans to keep the air flow going. 

Smoking is allowed in this place, unlike other hookah joints (duh!), so that's am added advantage of this place. Since the place is booming up like hot cake now-a-days, weekends can be a bit frustrating as there will be a big queue to wait on.

A really nice place situated on the road beside Vivekananda Park, near Fillers.  Perfect time to go here would be somewhere between 4pm -7pm. Offers an unparalleled view of the area, with the dim lightings and clear blue sky just adds to the prettiness. 
So there are around 4 cabanas on the rooftop, all very cozy and breezy. The 3rd floor has indoor seating arrangements too. 
After clicking a lot of pictures, we decided to take two hookahs, one was #Raseela Paan and another #Double Apple, both with ice base. Nice flavors, medium strong. Appropriately priced. 
One non smoker amongst us decided to go with a mocktail-Jackfrost. It was pretty nice actually with coconut shavings for garnish. 
Loved the place. A new favorite for hangouts :)
 Music played is good btw. 

Pro Tip:: Smoking is allowed, duh, so do take a pack of cigarettes.

New open air food joint in the city. However apart from the fact that it's open till late and it's open air, my experience is not that good. If you wish to visit a place with wonderful ambience & nice hookah, then Zucca Lounge is the place for you. But if you want good food and a quite conversation, you should avoid this place.

One of the new additions to the city. However apart from the fact that it's open till late and it's open air, there are few reasons to visit again. Service is bad! Ordered for masala fries, we got normal French fries, and even on mentioning it, they refused to change it. A mood spoiler. Plus none of the other items were great either.

The moment I entered Zucca Lounge Rooftop Arena, I was awestruck. It is so beautiful. The four cabanas are so amazingly decorated that they give you, beach party vibes.ü§ò
It's located at the far end of Vivekananda Park and is near to Fillers.
It's ambience is the USP of this place.üòç
The service was top notch.
The hookah was okayish though.
My food order consisted of Healthy Bite,Trece Spiced Pizza and Loaded Nachos. All of these items were comparable to other cafes, nothing special as such.
From the Mocktails section I tried Zucca Classic Mojito, it was satisfactory.
Reasonably priced.

Located on the 5th floor terrace of a building near the Vivekananda Park. Went there on an evening, grabbed a table on the terrace with an expectation to enjoy the breeze at the open top area , but it was too hot. The ambience is good with little white tents for private dinning. Ordered Caribbean Breezer - yogurt smoothie which tasted good and an appetizer - chili garlic mushroom with average taste.. In terms of staffs and service it was very satisfactory.

A beautiful rooftop place at a stone throw distance from fillers- southern avenue, zucca would give you the best ambiance probably in the neighborhood areas where cafes have been mushrooming.
Located on two floors, this place is one of my favorites for the ambiance.
Food is comparable to other cafes, nothing very fancy.
I guess they offer their rooftop for private party bookings as well.
Nice decor, freshly done upholstery gives a welcoming appearance.
The only complain- the menu. The veg and non veg dishes are jumbled together.. And the font of the dish name and its description is quite similar.
You need to squint and check for the names and the descriptions.
A better spaced and systematic menu card is a must.
Shall i go there again? Yes.

By looking at the menu and the pics from zomato, I went in with high e expectations to this food cum sheesha joint with two buddies of mine. We entered when the sun had just set and hence missed the sunset which is said to be quite a lookout from the open air terrace. The decor with its white elegant curtains, comfy cushions and bed placed against mahogany colored furniture really sets the mood for a great start. You are lucky if you grab your seats in one of these taverns (with the bed) as the other seating arrangement is not so good. We ordered cookie butter smoothie, xacuti style crusted chicken, a pizza with chicken lamb bell pepper toppings and brain freezer hookah. The food was good but not great . I was looking for some surprise but couldn't find it. The music was really good though.

I had recently been to Zucca lounge and to be honest I was a little disappointed. To start with the open area of the lounge - is awesome. However, the enclosed area is just about average. We ordered for pan rasna kiwi sheesha - it was something between average and below average. We ordered for a pasta - it was clearly a disaster. The sauce was too sweet and not herbed well. On asking to modify the taste, it got better, yet not good. 
Personally, I found it overpriced considering the quality of sheesha and food which were quite average.

One more addition to the hookah cafes in Kolkata, located in one of the posh areas of kolkata they attract a very cream crowd. The ambience is fabulous, having both open air and inside sitting options. We ordered for a teen paan rose hookah which was pretty decent and we ordered for zucca style Jacket Potatoes which was not at all nice, the mix sauce pasta was ok ok types and the oreo shake was amazing. The staffs are friendly. The only issue is that its a but over priced but then it's totally worth a visit, if you are planning to explore some new cafes then you should surely try this one

I had recently been to Zucca lounge and to be honest I was a little disappointed. To start with the open area of the lounge - is awesome. However, the enclosed area is just about average. We ordered for pan rasna kiwi sheesha - it was something between average and below average. We ordered for a pasta - it was clearly a disaster. The sauce was too sweet and not herbed well. On asking to modify the taste, it got better, yet not good. 
Personally, I found it overpriced considering the quality of sheesha and food which were quite average.

One more addition to the hookah cafes in Kolkata, located in one of the posh areas of kolkata they attract a very cream crowd. The ambience is fabulous, having both open air and inside sitting options. We ordered for a teen paan rose hookah which was pretty decent and we ordered for zucca style Jacket Potatoes which was not at all nice, the mix sauce pasta was ok ok types and the oreo shake was amazing. The staffs are friendly. The only issue is that its a but over priced but then it's totally worth a visit, if you are planning to explore some new cafes then you should surely try this one

When was the last time you hung around with friends on a roof top that looked nothing less than a dream? When was the last time that an eatery offered you the best in ambiance, food and service, without scratching your pocket? In case that the answer to both these questions are ‚ÄúNEVER‚Äù, well, that answer is about to change. Zucca Lounge is setting the bar high, with its finger licking food and top notch ambience. The place in a glimpse is nothing less than an oasis.

Ever imagined sitting under a star filled sky, a breezy monsoon evening and sipping in your favourite cocktail or puffing in the shisha? Or sitting in with your buddies and enjoying an evening with great food indoors, The newest entrant in the buzzing neighbourhood of South Kolkata offers you both. Zucca, the rooftop lounge caters to fabulous selection of food and an amazing view to relax during your leisure time.
            

Location : Hemanta Mukhopadhay Sarani at Southern Avenue. This is near Vivekananda Park.

Decor and Ambience : Zucca Lounge is what a cabana like unwinding zone would look like in the middle of a metropolitan city. Divided into two storeys, one on the fourth floor gives you a rooftop experience - a big floor space, it has three or four luxurious looking platform-like sitting area with white swirling curtains. The alfresco zone has white walls, white chairs with wooden tables and dark colour flooring.It also offers an indoor section with a relaxed ambience. Come indoors and you‚Äôll find a cosy spot with booth style seating, comfy sofas and contemporary wooden styling on the ceilings and walls. Pinewood finish on the walls and tables lend Zucca a cosy feel.

Food : The menu offers an assortment of global delicacies.

The following was readily served to us-

Mocktails

1.Peach Bull - This one is peach syrup lemon juice,lemonade,strawberry syrup topped up with red bull. Somehow a lot of red bull had just dampened the taste.

If you wish to visit a place with wonderful ambiance & nice hookah, then Zucca Lounge is the place for you.
But if you want good food and a quite conversation, you should avoid this place.¬†

If you visit anyway, you can either choose to sit on the 3rd floor cafe or you can enjoy the stunningly beautiful open terrace area on the 4th floor.¬†
The day was too hot, so we avoided the humid open air space on the terrace and comforted ourselves in the air-conditioned 3rd floor. ¬†Now, the music was absurdly loud. We couldn't even hear each other properly. At one point of time the music became so loud, we had to request the staff to lower the volume. We could also see few other people complaining about the same.

Coming to the food, we ordered their specialty Zacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken along with a Darjeeling Tea & a Hot Chocolate (A regular one, not the spiced hot chocolate).¬†
Darjeeling Tea was decent. Hot Chocolate was the worst I ever had. Totally watery & frothy with the faintest hint of chocolate. Need to mention here that they charge more than the cafes of similar standard. Also the quantity is less. The Zacuti Chicken was crisp but not succulent. It was really dry. The food part was a total disaster. Also, they charge hefty amount of taxes.¬†

Not going back again.

Swung by this Southern Ave outpost expecting a cool vibe and good music on a Friday evening. The location is a bit in the hinterland so it's a ride getting there but the first impression is someone's home terrace made up with Miami South Beach white furniture! Totally feels out of place but in a innocent way that promises to bring back the nostalgia of that first date or first kiss! Didn't try any food, they *don't* serve any alcohol so really I only had the music, the people and the space to experience. The music was disjointed but playing a good selection of clubby and radio numbers. The people were either cubed in their own spaces or ensconced in their seats, no real movement. Somehow those synapses of an overall mood never came together and I left with that empty feeling one gets when some old memory comes back and there is just the ephemeral feeling but nothing you can do about it. So it's probably going to appeal to the twenty something crowd forming their first memories but not much for those looking for an evening to add to their experiences!

Sit on the rooftop during sunset, with light breeze blowing and foot tapping music in the background is where Zucca scores high. The decor is fab. Even the indoors section is very well decorated with good music and comfortable seats. Since our city is always hot and humid so the best option would be to sit indoors during the day hours and chill in the roof top area post 4:30-5.  The food: we had ordered chicken wings, Oreo poppers, brownie with ice cream.    Quantity wise its quite well proportioned and it doesn't seem to compromise with the quality either. However the dessert was a let down. The brownie with ice cream wasn't 'brownie' after all. It tasted like the cakes you get at monginis. ( which tastes great! But why would I pay 200 bucks for something which I can get for 40 bucks elsewhere.) That apart no complaints. The service is prompt, music is great. Oh the hookah is reasonable here.

This is one of the best ever hangouts for the youth of Kolkata. It has an awesome rooftop sitting arrangement. The food is spicy and amazingly tasteful. The hookah is lighter but it's just an excuse to linger there longer üòâ . The mocktails are amazing and extremely well portioned.

The lounge has awesome interiors. A great hookah lounge in South kolkata after a long time. Visited the place on Tuesday afternoon...so it was pretty empty. But as you enter you feel the warmth of wooden interiors and tastefully done decor. Very comfortable seating. They also have a awesome terrace seating but thats open only post 6 pm as informed by the staff. I tried their hookah, a cold coffee and Pescatora Salad Non Veg.
Hookah was smooth...the coffee was perfect but the salad was nowhere close to the expectation. The salad was supposed to made of grilled veg in pesto sauce and dices of chicken. The first time it arrived on our table it was tasteless. On being returned some salt was added and may be the sauce was slightly modified and sent back to us. So food rating cannot be more than 2.
But this place looks great for Hookah and hanging out with friends over a coffee !

Zucca with its white cabanas are a treat for the mind and soul. The serenity of the place is kind of addictive. Set on the roof top the lounge comes with a brilliant concept. I mean who could think of cabanas in  Southern Avenue area and that too in the midst of a residential and commercial locality. The white cover with wooden flooring is something that I am quite impressed with. Only thing I feel is there should have been more ventilation as it gets claustrophobic once everyone lights up the hookah. The chicken asparagus soup is a must try here. The fruit salad we ordered was very well presented. The mixed sauce pasta was good enough. The mock tails were kind of average and needs improvement. The hookah was good.  I loved the ambiance totally. The big projector screen is apt to watch live matches. The service was prompt and efficient. Overall a lovely place to hang out with friends.

Zucca Lounge located in¬†P 264C, Hemanta Mukhopadhay Sarani, Southern Avenue, Kolkata is one fine place i have long waited to tick on my been visited places list . And this happened recently when Panch phoron got an invite to experience their food offering‚Äôs and further to chill at their grandest ambienced Cafe/Lounge on the rooftop . A big Thanks to the management and staff of Zucca for bringing and coming up with such a great planned lounge which is actually very rare to find in Kolkata . It actually took me by storm to believe something like this came and gave the city a double joy of experiencing class and a new approach in the lounge scene around Kolkata. Its been more than 3 months now and its attention has grabbed eyeballs very successfully which certainly has all the praises at my end too as it deserve‚Äôs it whole heartedly after my thorough experience that i had here . Zucca makes you feel free and less limited to the places you can actually chill ,as the ambiance speaks a well crafted place with two floors divided on the 3rd and 4th floor . The 3rd floor has an in house cafe like look of a place where as the 4th floor is ¬†basically the central focus of this place as a rooftop terrace is converted in a beautiful Cabbana style open air lounge . The interiors and decor translates everything in white from seating to curtains all is white and very peaceful it looks indeed . An whole section has 4 to 5 Cabana style seating which can accomade atleast 8 in each of them . Towards the other eye of the place there is a hanging like seating place and few comfy table and chair‚Äôs surrounded all over. And above them for entertainment purpose there is the large HD projector focusing matches ,music and lots more on the roof wall stuck screen in the open sky, which is sure magical for the eyes even from a distance view. Then the corner section has the Hookah making place for the staff which looks very nice and bright too. What i like mostly about Zucca Lounge is the smart divided zones for everything and all is visible to you ,so its like you are also a part of seeing how things are done by the Zucca team .The food and drinks probably comes from the kitchen which is in the 3rd floor i did not take note of that as i was stuck mesmerized with their roof top ambiance i did not pay heap to anything around. Well moving on if you choose any of the Cabbana‚Äôs you will love the private like feeling with the comfortable white big sofa like cushions to rest and relax . The wind is like a non stop blowing affair here in the rooftop as its located in South Kolkata so a windy atmosphere is like a blessing always . With that point just imagine such a place where you eat and a get complemented by a nice weather in open sky ,a moment it would be absolutely rememorable.

A Lovely Evening Spent at Zucca Lounge..!
A lovely rooftop restaurant off Southern Avenue, which has quite made a name for its serene and decorative ambiance. The sitting is luxurious, with the normal chairs on one side, and the other side having separate cubicles with the cozy and comfortable pillow to cater to your needs. While the open air breezes past your face, one gets to savor on some of their popular hookahs, which has to be for sure their USP. There also happened to be an inside sitting section on the third floor which has more of these lavish couches and you have the lovely windows to peep outside. A much happening place for romantic lovers on a rainy day.

Our group #panchphoron was cordially invited to try some of their offerings. The place is very easy to locate. If you know where Lake Kalibari is, this would be at a walking distance from that place. One needs to take the lift to go upstairs, but once you either enter their inside sitting area or the open area, it seems worth it.  Besides, the service here was exemplary, and starting from the courteous Manager to the captains and the waiters, all of them were very attentive and kind to us. Following were the dishes, mocktails and deserts, which were offered to us:

Mocktails name

1.Peach Bull.(peach syrup lemon juice, lemonade , strawberry syrup @ topped up with red bull): The concoction of the peach syrup, along with the perfect blend of lemon juice and lemonade, further added with the strawberry syrup, is just what we needed to quench our thirst.

2.Buck's Nursery Fizz(Fresh orange juice topped up with GInger ale and some fresh mints sprigs): Fizzy and thirst-quenching, the orange juice blended well with the Ginger ale. The fresh mints sprigs added really well to the garnishing. 

3. Jack Frost(pineapple  juice, blue curacao & cream of coconut creates the most delicious milk): A delight for those who loves coconut. Milky and smooth, this was just a pure delight to the tastebuds. 

4. Cranberry Iced tea (cranberry juice, lemon chunks, and tea liquor): Perhaps my most liked type of berries, this particular iced tea was again refreshing and much helpful to digest down the huge volume of food we were consuming. 

5.Green Apple Mojito(chunks of green apple, mint, lemon juice n tea liquor): Who doesn‚Äôt like a Mojito these days in the hot summer? Minty, fizzy and thirst-reliever, this one was one of the best Mojitos I had tried in a long time.

6.Oreo Poppers(chunks of oreo cookies, milk n cream): More like a Oreo Shake, the concept or Oreo Biscuits has been really hitting the market well. This one had the texture of a chocolate, but was more refined and tasted better.

7.Coco Island(chocolate syrup, fresh banana n milk): For the gluttons, a yummy banana shake is something they would never refuse. And when banana is blended with caramel or chocolate, it simply creates a magical combination altogether. The ingredients used were fresh, and hence lifted the flavor of the drink even higher than expected.

8.Antioxidant(with the great  concoction of watermelon pineapple &cucumber): For the health freaks, this was more like a detox to get you rid of the harmful chemicals from inside your body. This is supposed to keep your body clean and healthy. Tastewise, it was great too and refreshing at the same time.

Food

Starter

1.Clay pot Morsel of chicken(chicken tikka with a twist): An improved version of Chicken Tikka, the chicken portions were absolutely soft and were grilled to perfection. 

2.Xacuti spice corn dusted chicken(our signature chicken supreme): Served with a tomato and pesto dip on the side, this one had chicken dusted with  xacuti spice corn and fried till perfection. The outside was crispy, and went well with the flavorful mixed sauce.

3.Fish tossed with celery and salt(coriander and lemon marinated crispy fish with tartar mayo): The batter was super crispy and did not go soggy. The fish was soft and simply melted in our mouth. The tartar sauce served as a great dip with the tangy lemony flavor striking our tastebuds.

4. Classic Manchow soup - chicken stock, ginger, garlic and eggs: Classic Manchow Soup, with the hot and spicy flavor hitting right at our tastebuds. The chicken stock was well mixed with rich flavors to spice it up and the eggs and chicken made it a delightful combination.

Maincourse

1.Shanghai surprise(oriental inspired): A thin crust pizza, prepared with loads of mozzarella, fresh vegetables and chicken to create a flavorful pizza. The base was not falling off, and the sauce was really packing a punch. The amount of cheese provided was more than sufficient, and the fresh veggies, along with the chicken added to the crunchiness and the flavor at the same time.

2.Pan fried noodles(panfried noodles served with stir fried vegetables and chicken): A classic version of the erstwhile Gravy Noodles, the broth was super rich and succulent, and we had no problem in gulping in the flavorful noodles. The stir fried vegetables and the chicken was perfect as an ideal topping. 

3.Chicken  Cacciatore(grilled chicken served in mushroom pepper sauce and mash veggie): Well grilled, with the mushroom pepper sauce creating a rich and creamy texture. The veggies were fresh, and went well the sauce. The Chicken was soft as well, and was well blended with the delightful mushroom pepper sauce.

¬†Dessert

1.Cheese cake with blueberry compote: Soft, delicate and creamy, the blueberry flavor really hit the cheese cake well. The cheesecake was presented well, with the blueberry d√©cor increasing our appetite almost instantaneously after seeing this heavenly desert. 

2.Brownie with vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce: Much popular combination these days, the brownie was fresh and had ample of nuts to keep us busy. The chocolate sauce was sinful, and together with the chocolate sauce was more than enough to keep us happy while finishing off what was already a hearty meal.

The place is quite promising as such. The menu is diversified. The quality of food is also good. It needs to keep up to its standard and try to uplift themselves even more to really maintain their reputation. Unfortunately, I could not taste some of the items properly, but then again, there‚Äôs always a next time.

Happy eating.

The concept of lounge is a bit young to Kolkata. Though there have been bar-cum lounges, Kolkata saw a surge in the number with the introduction of sheesha. Lounges have become the go to place for pretty much everything ranging from birthday treats to friends meet & even semi official meet ups. Zucca Lounge is one of the recent additions to the ever-growing number of such outlets. Located beside Vivekananda Park, Southern Avenue, this lounge within three months of opening is garnering some serious attention & accolades. One of the major USP of this is the open air roof top section, which also has live sports screening. Seeping in some hokaah, overlooking the south Kolkata skyline while enjoying a match, could it get any better!

Nothing is better than a open air lounge.where you can actually feel the beauty of the nature as well as you can enjoy the lovely atmosphere. this place is very popular among the students. in a very short time of period won the hearts of peoples.located in hemanta mukhopadhay sarani,southern avenue area.same building where the lavana spa, on the third and forth floor.this place opened a few months back. real success behind this place is lovely decoration with some extraordinary interior, ambience was there are two different sitting arrangement one in the third floor inside section another one is on the rooftop.my first¬†preference is the rooftop section,recently i was invited there with my fellow foodies at this place.sitting arrangement just lovely,there are tables and chairs also lovely cosy sofas along with tables. here you can seat and enjoy the delicious foods rest yourself over a pillow while listen to some lovely musics.very comfortable place where you can hang around with your friends.

Went to this place a couple of weeks back. Situated in the lane beside Vivekananda Park on Southern Avenue this relatively new cafe cum hookah bar is one of the many places of its type which have come up in and around this place. The rooftop seating arrangements is a welcome addition to this place which separates it from the more orthodox places. Food quality is however very ordinary and prices are exorbitantly high.The place was relatively empty when we dropped in at this place and ambiance was rather dull and boring, may be because we had dropped in on a weekday evening. However, apart from the rooftop arrangements nothing is worth mentioning about this place.

Zucca has this pleasant feeling with trees around. Being set in a very natural locale,it pleases the eye. Loved the big window concept in the closed area. The cabanas were packed and it was drizzling so we didn't sit in the open area. Having said that it looked good as well. Now coming to the food part,we ordered for soup and the Veg tandoor platter. Both were delicious,specially the asparagus soup. Definitely worth a visit again and hopefully very soon...

With its stunning ambience and amazing food, stands Zucca Lounge in one of the bylanes of Southern Avenue. In just three months of its opening, Zucca has turned into a very successful venture, being very much popular among the youngsters. The day I saw the pictures of the ambience, I was really excited to visit this place to enjoy the rooftop atmosphere but little did I realise that the food here is much more awesome than the ambience, both of which are the reason behind the speedy success of this place !

A bad day to visit the most talked about lounge of the city. Thanks to the rainy weather the open seating area was close. Had to settle down inside.
Opted for 3 shakes,1mocktail, pizza and a baby corn.
All the shakes had a coconut flavor to them which was not mentioned in the menu card. On asking one server he said they use both coconut milk and regular milk. When I told another server to mention in the menu that coconut milk is added in the shakes he said they don't add! I told him that all our drink had a taste of it. But he went on saying they don't.
Although our entire group got a coconut taste.
So the shakes were unimpressive.
The kiwi spring water hookah was good but upon coal change it had a choking taste to it.
The Shanghai chicken pizza was loaded with cheese and very little chicken.
The baby corn was okay. But the Californian mocktail was good.
Overall feeling:-  overhyped!

What I loved most about Zucca was the ambience and I am not only talking about the beautiful white cabanas on the outdoor terrace with a dreamy aura about the place, the tranquility which transitions effortlessly into a groovy and happening atmosphere by the awesome and exhaustive playlist that they have got...but the interiors so meticulously fashioned,  the ever changing trendy ceiling lights, plush couches, huge glass windows overlooking so much greenery (this place is located right next to vivekanda park after all) should put this place right there in your bucket list!! Add to that the bonus of good food and great hookah! We ordered chicken and asparagus cappucino, asparagus puree blended with cream and chicken flakes served in a cup- the taste was spot on! Next came Xacuti spiced corn dusted chicken, another lip smacking preparation!! For main course, we had clay pot roasted treasures of fauna and chicken cacciatore- the former was a platter of all kinds of grilled favourites like lamb sheekh kebab, grilled prawn, fish kebab and chicken kebab while the latter had grilled chicken with mushroom pepper sauce with mashed potatoes. They were blissfully tasty. We also tried hookah- teen pan rose and found the shisha to be very good! But I am afraid to say that I found the service lacking- it was slow, the waiters had to be told twice to bring us water!! Otherwise, the prices are pretty decent and also, they play your favourite songs on request..yay!! Love to come here again!

Ok . So city' s new rooftop resto lounge is here . The rooftop ambience is not claustrophobic like others . Though we did not get the couches as all were booked somehow . Though liked the ambience . Well coming into the foods . Ordered thincrust pizza and Spragetti pasta , the quantity and quality combined will get four . Overall its plus point is Dhakuria lake facing view , nice place to hangout and would like to visit again .

Rooftop has nice ambience... Nice place to spend good time with your friends and loved once. It was raining so we were shifted to 3rd floor... since it was a closed area so felt strong smell of hookah. Nothing much too eat on vegetarian side. Ordered paneer tika which didn't satisfy my taste buds. Ordered one mocktail which also tasted bland. Prices High as compared to quantity and taste of food. Rating is for ambience only.

This place isnt for vegetarians. Not much options to order. Plus the food seemed a little pricy than normal if I go by a standard cafe/lounge charges and taste. It wasnt satisfying on the whole.

There seems to be a common problem with the Calcutta eateries - they are unable to keep up the initial food and service standards! Zucca's following the suit. The food was great during the first month but now it's dreadfully bad. They loaded our thin crust pizza with white sauce for some godforsaken reason. Need I say more?

The staff at this restaurant need to be educated about food allergies. They also need a lesson in sensitivity.Today, my daughter who is allergic to dairy, went practically hungry at this restaurant because they could not cook ANYTHING without dairy or even with less dairy. They refused to consider doing a pizza with less than the usual amount of cheese. How ridiculous is that? The excuse was that it wouldn't taste as good. Surely it's better to give a guest something to eat than fuss about the exact recipe? She ended up with a plate of over salted spaghetti alio alio. This restaurant gets a negative ten from me. üò¨üò¨

There were various people sitting there as I asked asked a empty cabana the staff shocked me by saying sorry sir can't give  u that place bcs v don't have empty place to keep those pillows I was like are u serious that u can't give  me space bcs u want those pillows to be there.. After getting annoyed they dint even bother to explain feel sorry for such a place where they have ambience and evrything but they lack good staff... Big no to place where they insult there guest in such a way I would rate it 0star...

In want of a Rooftop Lounge? Look no further. The new addition to our favourite, already packed Southern Avenue has recently brought this to our disposal.

Zucca Lounge is easy to locate. The best possible landmark for this place would be Cloak Room. But if you are not familiar with this, I am sure you are with Grub Club. So walk straight ahead until you find this lounge to your right.

Zucca, this town's newest hotspot. Divided into two storeys, one on the fourth floor gives you a rooftop experience: a big floor space that could encompass a good thirty people. Decorated and polished beautifully with white accents that highlight the features of this place. It has three or four luxurious looking platform-like sitting area with white swirling curtains that accentuate the well-thought architecture.

Coming down to the floor below, it features fun, loud music and a satisfactory sitting area. 

Zucca Lounge is an addition to our hookah family in Southern Avenue. Besides having shisha available, this place also serves tasty food items and icy drinks.

Zucca Lounge has a well briefed staff team. They are familiar with the items on their menu and are smooth at remembering them too.

Love is in the air. As one enters this place, only one word comes out WOW nd that is also less, for this beautiful cabanas. They have 2 sections rooftop one and one inside sitting lounge. As it is easy to locate its just nearby to fillers, in southern avenue.

Inside interiors is also being done in a very good way with chains on the top cozy sofas and chairs. Dim lighted, good music, live screening everything so this place. Is a full package.
Coming to the rooftop view cabanas are done with full white theme, white curtains drapped, white leather bed kind with white pillows, a table in middle, with a very good view so this all makes it very prrfct.

Not only the scenic beauty or interiors. Food was the best part. I had a oreo poppers which was very choclaty nicely blended with proper texture, cold and creamy, something i loved abd enjoyed. Then we had thai spiced chilli babycorn, which was very crispy, spicy, with chillies. Something to crave. Their White sauce penne pasta was very cheesy and good in taste...
Will surely visit this place again abd again and would love too go and just munch on their amazing food and mocktails!!. Its pocket friendly even, best place to go with friends and to spend good time alongüòÅ

I wish the entire team all the very best for future!!‚úå

When it comes to ambiance u just describe it as FANTASTIC. 
Behaviour of waiters totally upto the mark except for the lady in cash counter she was extremely rude when we had a doubt regarding bill. 
Beverages and pasta were very good. 
Pizza was mediocre. 
Hookah the BEST IN KOLKATA.

After going through the reviews and hearing so much about this place,finally made it to this place. And all I can say is that the place is over hyped and over pricey compared to the service they provide. It isn't that spacious as well and moreover if u want to go for couch outdoor seating,u have to pay extra 1000+ which is just not worth. The curtains draped around the couch area was too filthy and grotty. The colour theme white is good but they should maintain it if they have chosen that colour.
Apart from that,music isn't too catchy and loud. The indoor seating was good but again not that spacious. Food is good but considering the price,I wouldn't suggest.

One of the worst hookah place I have been to!! Their food items are extremely overpriced and hookah is the worst. The smoke went off just 10 mins after the hookah was served. When asked the waiter said that's how it goes and we need to change the coal at an extra charge. After a long argument finally the hookah maker came and changed the coal. Avoid this place if you do not want to get robbed!!

The right place if you're looking to chill with friends or family. I personally like the terrace more than the closed enclosure. Music was soothing and the ambience very palatable. The food they serve just clicks both in terms of presentation and taste. The quality of hookah can be improved but my overall experience was damn good. Most importantly it's currently one of the few places in Calcutta that has decent crowd as compared to other hookah places. Definitely worth a try. Superb value for money!!

Went there on recommendation of a friend.. Well to start off,the location was nice and easily accessible..The interiors were cool and the rooftop part had a classy touch to it with the sitting arrangements and cabanas all decked up in white making it look good!¬†
Now coming to the food, we ordered for a Brainfreezer shisha along with Pasta in white sauce , garlic bread ¬†and a few ¬†coolers..The hookah was simply not upto the mark for many reasons :-¬†
a) Under average quality of coal :- the coal used for hookah was simply not upto the mark even when we got it changed twice since each time after a period of 2-3 mins it started choking
b) the smoke generated was not at all dense!!¬†
Don't know why they ¬†chose the tagline :- '' Good Food, Great Hookah"..

Coming to the food, the pasta was decent and well cooked and the garlic bread was crisp..and the lemon sodas were ok..Overall a not-so good experience, primarily based on the fact that we went there on the lookout for a good new hookah lounge.. And yes to their credit,the prices are relatively on an average side..Overall an okayish experience for a hyped up place!

Absolutely loved the place.. went there on a dinner date with my Lovely lady S. There's nothing like a girl's date night I say. We went up to the terrace, and sat near the swing.. (which was quite envied upon by the people who came later) :D
We ordered the elaichi flavoured hookah with milk base, which was amazing and unlike anything I have had in hookah in a long time. I was so bored with the usual pan and apple undertones infused with mint in all the hookahs that I was delighted with the change in flavour suggested by the waiter. The milk base made the hookah a much smoother version, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.
We ordered a passion fruit cocktail, which S enjoyed a lot, and she kept saying the same atleast 10 times.
I ordered a buck freezer's nest cocktail, which had flavours of orange and fresh citrus which I loved.
Next we ordered spicy chicken wings from the nibbles section.the chicken was well cooked and the wing pieces were large.. the flavour was quite different and had a hint if Indian cooking.
For our main we ordered the grilled fish, which was the best choice of the evening.
The fish was white grilled and baked in butter, and the broth was salty burnt butter, which was amazingly flavoursome. This, infused with boiled veggies and a sweetened mashed potato side was the best ammulgation. Thoroughly enjoyed the food and would love to come back :D

If you're looking forward to cool roof-top adda sessions with good food - mocktails and hookah, along with some really good surroundings and music, then Zucca is the best Kolkata has to offer right now.¬†

Location. Easy to locate. Right next to Vivekananda Park.
Ambiance. Both the rooftop and the closed spaces are beautiful. If you were searching for romantic candlelights, Zucca is the place to be.
Crowd. Gen Y
Food. The kit-kat shakes and chocolate based mocktails are excellent. Hookah is decent too.

Value for Money. Food might be a bit expensive, but mocktails are a real value for money.

Given the ambiance and the overall set-up, this place deserves to be one of the most happening ones in town now.

"Love is in the air"- you will certainly feel so, once you enter the rooftop based new hang out destination of Kolkata.
 Zucca Louge - the new bee in town for the people who loves to chill out with friends or even with their partners in a private rendezvous.

##Location:
Southern avenue near Vivekananda Park just after you cross the Fillers and French loaf outlet.


##Ambiance:
With their Lovely rooftop ambiance this place is divided in two parts. The inside sitting area is made in cubicle shaped sitting with a drinks counter added inside.
On the rooftop they have got an eye catching decor with white curtains all around in the bed like pavements as a sitting area.
Also there are tables with fancy chairs and hanging couch added in it. 
The giant screens in both the areas are on of the best addition where you can enjoy music or even live sports screening too.
Perfect ambiance for a lounge I would say.


##Food:

Soups: (#MUSTTRY)
With attractive presentation their soups are the must try.
I tried 4 kind of soups here and each of them are very much distinctively different from each other and has a rich taste too.

Asparagus cappachino  #recommended
Mushroom veloute with roasted garlic butter #recommended
Tomato, Tarragon and jalape√±o cream  #recommended
Classic manchow soup .#recommended

Mocktails: 
Mocktails are one of the key items which is expected from a lounge and they quite well deservingly completes that criteria.

Jack Frost A blue colored drink served in margarita glass was different in taste as it consists of pineapple juice, blue curacao & cream of coconut.
Passion Fruit Mojito was the best one according to me as it was totally refreshing.
Buck Nursery Fizz: An orange coloured drink with fusion of ginger ale, orange & mint was lip smacking with strong orange flavor.
Oreo Shake: Oreo as garnished rich & creamy shake. #Tryout

Salads:
Tried their Pesto Salad and Gado Gado Salad. 
Good part was they served them with fresh veggies and crisp garlic breads but the flavor didn't really mixed well to be honest which needs to be taken care of.

Starters:
Zucca Style Jackpot Potato: 
Stuffed potato with cheesy corn, bellpepper and olives added to it.
A must try for everyone.

Fish tossed in Celery Salt: 
Fish filets fried with bellpepper and garnished with spring onion tasted yummy.
It has corriander lemon flavor added in.

Lyula Kabab: 
Mutton kebab with pudina chatni was decently made and it was average for me as I am not very fond of mutton kebabs.
Xacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken: #recommended

Platters:
Clay pot roasted Flora: 
With a lovely presentation this dish was a veggie delight.
paneer stuffed potato,Cauliflower,Broccoli, Onion, Tomatoes served in a tasty platter form.

Clay Post Roasted Fauna:
 Four different non veg kebabs  Chicken, Prawn,Lamb and Fish with pudina chatni. 
All the kebabs were made delicious and the quality of the raw materials were also very fresh.
#Recommended

Mains:
Creole Style Fish and Chips: 
My personal favorite from the menu as the fish served has a very soft and fresh quality and the preparation was totally spot on.
This lip smacking item was not too much oily too. Loved it.
#Recommended

Chicken Cacciatore: 
A delicious dish with grilled chicken in mushroom pepper sauce served with mashed potatoes,sauted veggies and garlic bread. 
A very well prepared dish with good amount of ingrediants added in it.

##Service:
Though the service was slow but it is expected that people will definatly sit back and chill out in a place like this.
Staffs are well behaved and welcoming too where I do not see any problem. 

I really enjoyed my time over here specially with the kind of ambiance they have kept all around.
Wish them all the very best for future and hoping to shine brighter day by day. Congratulations to Mr. Khurshid for coming up with such a lovely place.

Was really attracted with their name when I first saw it on Zomato. This place was on my wishlist for a long time after seeing the white cabanas. 
The interiors are really soothing and very thoughtfully done. 
The only reason I'm giving this place a 3 star is because I wasn't really happy with their Shisha and Food. They can work on it. 
Southern Avenue is soon becoming a hot spot. This place can really do well. 
All the best.

Did not get a place on the rooftop. So, we sat downstairs. Pity. 
We ordered a hookah, a starter and 2 drinks. Mine was a refreshing watermelon-cucumber-pineapple juice with real fruits on top. This was fresh and new, unlike syrupy mocktails. Other joints should also offer fresh juice options like this. Anyway, food is a bit pricey if not in a combo.
The music was surprisingly good.
Would love to go back, just to hang out in one of those cabanas, if the weather's good.

Well, since the time it has opened, Zucca Lounge was a rave hit and I had it in my wishlist for quite sometime now. Yesterday, as I was passing by Vivekananda Park with a friend, I planned a sudden visit there. As expected, I didn't get a place at their terrace which is the talk of the town now. So, had to settle down for the 3rd floor covered interior area. The place is well decorated, clean and spacious. The staffs are generous and greeted us well.
Coming to the food, a rare incidence for me - I didn't choose anything from the menu and left it totally on the attendant who was serving us. He suggested us to go for Shanghai Surprise Pizza with Lychee Fantasy and Carribean Breeze as mocktails to accompany with. Without a doubt, I went with his choice. The Pizza was excellent with right quantities of all the condiments required. The portion was also generous. The mocktails were masterpieces too - The Carribean Breeze was a smoothie of yogurt mixed with Orange, Guava and Lemon juice and one of the best smoothies I ever had. However, as I suggested them too, the taste of Guava need to be a bit toned down to further enhance its excellence. The Lychee Fantasy was another brilliance. A Lime bed with mojito like mixture of soda and crushed ice was enough to make the evening refreshing.
All in all, I am only sad for the fact that a place with such an ambiance does not offer the luxury of a BAR ! :) Nevertheless, it was a memorable experience at Zucca Lounge and I pledged to come back again to taste many more of their magnificent offerings because what it has is much more than what many bigger names doesn't have, and that is surely gonna make them sell like hot pancakes !

Wanted to visit this place for quite some time. However every time I planned, the outdoor sitting space got closed due to rain. Finally, got lucky to visit this hookah lounge. There are options for indoor sitting as well, the decor is decent. The rooftop is made over for the outdoor sitting space with a royal theme. White sofas, white cushions & pillows, white curtains, soft music, together makes a charming ambience. The service is decent and the waiters are polite yet it is evident that they are pretty new and there is room for improvement. We discussed about the food options with a waiter, and got to see that many of the items are lesser in portion, compared to the price. The waiter also suggested a flavour of hookah. We ordered a pizza with extra cheese and a hookah. The hookah was strong yet smooth. The pizza was good in quantity, compared to it's price, and fantastic in taste. It had a very nice thin yet crunchy crust, and was loaded with adequate quantity of meat and cheese. Haven't had a pizza so good in the recent times. The best part is that no tax is being charged on the billed amount. The experience was thoroughly great. Looking forward to come back, anytime soon.

2nd visit:

We went at 1:30 am at night. The waiters informed us that the rooftop is closed (though a group was sitting there, having hookah). We sat at the indoor space. It was decent and comfy, however the music was too loud for midnight and the choice of music could have been way better. They need to understand the difference between a disc and a lounge.
We had ordered hookah along with a mojito, an iced tea and two glasses of milk shake, topped with cadbury's gems (as chocolate shake was not available, we settled for this). The iced tea was brilliant and extraordinary. The mojito was good, a bit on the sour side though. The milk shakes were disasters. They tasted like cold milk, stirred with sugar. It was so dull that bland would be an understatement. The worst part is no spoons were given with the shakes and the gems either fell at the bottom or got clogged in the straw. Is it required to mention that while serving milkshake with a topping, a spoon must be given?

I am not reducing the rating as per one day experience, and I expect the service and hospitality that I had received on my first visit. I hope these issues are is not repeated.

It has got 2 floors.the rooftop section which is basically divided into cabanas has a beautiful view and is ideal for adda with friends.but it opens only after 6 pm.and the second floor is an airconditioned room with a pub type ambiance.we ordered jack frost,clay pot roasted treasures of fauna,xacuti spiced corn dusted chicken.jack frost is a cool drink.at the 1st sip u will feel a fizzy taste in mouth but gradually it tastes good.now the treasures of fauna was indeed a treasure.it consisted of 2 chicken kebabs,2 grilled prawns,2 fish kebabs,and 2 mutton kakori kebab( probably).it was an absolute delight to have this dish.all the kebabs were cooked to perfection and it left us craving for more.it was finger licking good.and the xacuti chicken was a crispy chicken dish.it was also fanastic.would definitely go back to try out their other delicacies.
P.s prices are inclusive of taxes.

It was a nice finding this place near Vivekananda Park. 

Zucca's half-Western Saloon and half-laser beam decor felt like something off the set of Back to the Future. The food was tasty, but the service was terribly slow. I had to scream at the waiter to get the modicum of service, and that was primarily because the loud (and not to my taste) music prevented orders from permeating the split ambience. 

It's not the kind of place you'd actively want to come and visit, but more of a pleasant surprise in a familiar neighborhood.

I am not too fond of going to cafes or lounge :-p but when i heard about the name of Zucca by my friends it made me little bit restless as i was hearing about this name for quite a some time. Southern Avenue have produced some great places in the recent times. Located near the triangular park and opposite to vivekanand Park at Purna das road the locality is very quite and silent. Talking about the place so it is mainly meant for hangouts and to have fun with friends and family as seemed to me. So i dropped down here with my friends to have a check to this fascinating place.
                                                                ...

It's easily locatable in southern avenue.. It has a roof with kabanas where you can feel the fresh air and enjoy. In the 4th fourth floor they have air conditioned   Room with good sitting capacity with projector on the  wall. Interior and sitting arrangements are modern in style and drinks are kept considering healthy and diet conscious people also.We went for short time on our anniversary where we were greeted and served warmly. Will go back again with friends and family to enjoy the food as they have high class chef team appointed

Very nice place in a quiet lane in Southern Avenue. Very easy to locate 

We sat on the terrace and it has been done up beautifully. The best place is they play amazing music. Very different from what other cafes and lounges play.
We ordered the pan mint hookah which was excelent

Crispy chilly baby corn was also good

The paneer tikkas were very average. 

The only drawback is the service which is slow. But with time they should improve. 

Overall a good addition to the city

Zucca is soon growing to become the most talked about cafe in the City of Joy. Located in the posh locality of Southern Avenue which houses some of the best joints in town, Zucca has already created a niche of its own. Its not even been a month since its Grand Opening, and I‚Äôve already been here 4 times. What lures me most to this place is the beautiful open terrace setup, with 4 huge, white and stunning cabanas. Their other seated area too is magnificantly laid.
                                                                ...

Zucca is a pretty place. It is one of the many newly opened cafes in Southern Avenue. The decor is obviously, very pretty which also makes it a popular place. The cafe has an open area for breezy evenings and an indoor area for the usual hot weather of Kolkata.
The manchow soup is amazing while the pizza was quite average. The shakes are good too. Pricing is decent and the service could be improved. :)

It was totally a waste of money. We checked some reviews on Zomato and decided to go there. After entering the cafe, I found the music so loud. I doubt their sense. And the worst thing was their food. Cost is relatively high, so we was thinking that it would be great. We ordered salad and pizza. Obviously if you order these dishes, you will expect that salad come first. But they don't know what to serve first. They brought pizza first. Then how pizza terrible was! It looks like pizza hut or Domino pizza's. I think they buy pizza from outside and make a little arrangement on it like cheese and cones. The salad was also bad. I am sure that the salad can not be called salad. I have never eaten that oily salad. Moreover salad is not raw. They make sabzi on name of salad. What was shocking was they don't serve normal water. It's my first restaurant which don't serve even water. I hate this place. I rather recommend you to go to Delices, which locates near this cafe instead.

The following food audit was on invitation of Shahbaaz Zaman of an newly opened restaurant. It was an Bloggers Meetup Organised by Restaurant Management with the help of Shahbaaz Zaman.¬†. ¬†Zucca Lounge is an newly opened cafe lounge which was rapidly flourishing. Situated near Hindustan Park mor on a way to southern avenue. It has two sections one is on the 3rd floor of the building. This was an Cafe cum hookah parlour. This section was cool looking perfect for youngsters. Comfortable and cool looking sitting arrangements with a big screen for live sports action and music videos. Ravishing Decor and lightning totally loved this section. Second section is on terrace which provides you city view. It has a 3-4 lounges where you arrange a party or a meetup. It also has a rooftop sitting arrangements again with big screen for live sports action and music videos. The whole section including lounges and seats are in milky white colour which looks ravishing in night. like to Mention that if you can't handle heat then don't choose rooftop section in summers.

Another beautiful silent spot in Southern Avenue.

This place is divided between 2 floors -Indoor & Outdoor (Terrace Area).
My favorite would be the Terrace Area - very well decorated and Cabana style seating.
This place would be ideal for Winters - we were a little disappointed since it started raining and there were hardly any stuff to help us shift indoors. There are only 2 attendants for the entire floor - one is always busy making hukka and the other one is busy executing orders.

We ordered a ¬†Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Mezze Veg Platter and Zucca Signature Drink with a Pan Rasna Orange Hukka.
After waiting for 30 mins we finally got our order and were utterly disappointed by the taste of the food and the hukka.

Babycorn was not cooked properly, Falafel looked like it had been overfried - tasted burnt and hukka had no flavor and smoke watsover.
We ask the waiter to look into it and rectify the same, but after wasting another 15 mins, he couldn't really do anything about it and since we were getting late we cleared our bills and moved out.

Xtremely disappointed with the food, hukka and service.¬†

You have got to focus on training your staff and making proper arrangements when it rains.

Southern avenue is becoming "the place" for hangout and zucca lounge is no exception. Located conveniently at southern avenue pretty close to Vivekananda park, this lounge is divided between two levels. My favorite is the terrace area.
It is divided between cabanas and completely works on a breezy evening.
The place is done up in white with wood to balance the otherwise subtle ambiance.
The place is ideal for evenings with friends.
I was invited here for a foodie meet with my fellow foodies and we had a great evening.

Here goes my food experience-

‚Ä¢ Jack Frost - a very cool looking drink. Essentially blue curacao and coconut dominated the flavoura and tastes good
‚Ä¢ Zucca style mojito was refreshing and tasty #recommended
‚Ä¢ Passionfruit mojito was flavorful and good. However, it could have had more flavoura of the passion fruit. It was however presented well.
‚Ä¢ Antioxidant please was a cleanser drink which was a blend of cucumber, watermelon and pineapple. I really enjoyed the drink and the presentation was eye pleasing. #recommendes for health freaks
‚Ä¢ Buck Nursery fizz was a name that caught my fancy. Prepared with orangce juice, ginger and mint leaves, this mocktail had well balanced flavours.
‚Ä¢ Oreo shake was one of the best I have had till date. It wasn't dominated by ice cream or chocolate flavors and allowed the Oreo to do its job! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Cocoa Island was a very uncommon flavour of chocolate and banana and was very tasty and filling.
The soups here are mind blowing and we were served the following:
‚Ä¢ Asparagus cappachino which is a veg lovers delight. Creamy broth reduced with asparagus completely made me fall in love with this place. #recommended
‚Ä¢ Mushroom veloute with roasted garlic butter crouton was a rich mushroom soup with creamy mushrooms and butter. The garlic balanced the otherwise heavy soup and I loved loved loved this bowl of happiness. #recommended
‚Ä¢ Tomato, Tarragon and jalape√±o cream was a light citrus soup with herbs and was very flavorful #recommended
‚Ä¢ Classic manchow soup was another soup gem which was oozing with flavours.
For salad I tasted their pescatora salad however, the salad fell flat since the chicken was not marinated well
‚Ä¢ Zucca style jacket potatoes were a delight! Scooped grilled potatoes were stuffed with white and cheese sauce, peppers, corn and garnished with olives and parsely. It was served with their house chilli sauce. #recommended
‚Ä¢ the clay pot roasted treasures of flora was a filling platter of Paneer marinated in coriander, bharwaan aloo stuffed, cauliflower and broccoli. The char on the veggies was amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

The service was a little slow but overall the staff was welcoming and well behaved.

I wish the newly opened zucca lounge the very best and I am definitely coming back for the hookah and pizzas!

I love roof top places, and am a tad bit biased towards them even. And Zucca has an indoor seating area as well as an open - air area on the terrace upstairs. 

Me, along with my gang of fellow foodies, sat in their terrace area, where pristine whites set the mood right for a lovely evening. I loved their soups, and the fish and chips. The flora and fauna platters were presented beautifully and tasted good too. 

One thing which I did not like much was the dressing of their salads. It lacked the ability to bring together the elements. Also, though the place looks beautiful, isn't too airy as the sides are enclosed by glass. 

Loved their presentation of food too. Will definitely recommend their mushroom soup,it was brilliant to say the least.

The interiors are awsome, location is great, ambience in okay, food was nice, price is steep. Oh yeah, one thing, the rooftop feels quit hot in the morning or evening, so avoid it during the day. Its one of Kolkata's new rooftop restaurants, its still developing, and has great prospects. Check it out if near Vivekananda park.

When was the last time you hung around with friends on a roof top that looked nothing less than a dream? When was the last time that an eatery offered you the best in ambiance, food and service, without scratching your pocket? In case that the answer to both these questions are ‚ÄúNEVER‚Äù, well, that answer is about to change. Zucca Lounge is setting the bar high, with its finger licking food and top notch ambience. The place in a glimpse is nothing less than an oasis.

How to reach?

Southern Avenue is without a doubt on its way to become the next Park Street and the newest jewel in its crown is the Zucca Lounge. The lounge is spread over two storeys, established on the top floor and roof of a newly constructed building, right by Vivekananda Park and is fairly easy to locate. All you do is come down to Vivekenanda park and take the French Loaf/Filler‚Äôs alley. Go straight and it should be on your right, in less than a minute‚Äôs time.

Seating:

While the 3rd floor is nicely decorated, the roof top does steal all the attention with the cabanas and the beautiful open air seating. Both the levels are served with huge projector screens. I can only imagine the rush this place is about to face during football and cricket season.

Food:

Since I was Vegetarian for a day (include me in the Tuesday/Thursday Veg wala scene -_-) I had limited hope from the plates of veg food that I was about to consume. Surprisingly so, all the pre-made notions escaped my mind at the sight of the food alone. Here is a glimpse of the food journey at Zucca.

The Beverages-

Anti Oxidant- We tried the Anti Oxidant, which is a blend of watermelon and cucumber with no added artificial flavourings or sugar components. Presented in a mason jar, the drink aims at detoxifying your body. The lounge has a few other beverages stocked under the health drink section.

Jack Frost- Next followed Jack Frost. Served in a margarita glass rimmed with desiccated coconut the drink is a delicious combination of coconut milk and blue caracoa.

Buck Nursery Fizz- The third mocktail served at the table was the Buck Nursery Fizz. The dominant flavours in the beverage were of passion fruit and orange, the ginger in the drink was slightly over powered. Yet, without a doubt this was the most appreciated beverage on the table.

Oreo Shake- Since a little indulgence is never bad, the last beverage to arrive at the table was the Oreo shake. Creamy and thick, the chocolaty jar of goodness did wonders for me.

Soups-

We tried four soups, namely the Asparagus Cappuccino, Mushroom Veloute, Tomato-Taragon-Jalapeno cream and finally the classic Manchow. All the soups, in one word were BRILLIANT. Though the sound of asparagus soup had irked me a bit at the onset, I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavours it had. The same opinion is prevalent for all the other soups on the table. I especially found it hard to share the Manchow and Tomato-Taragon soup with the rest of my fellow foodies.

Appetizers-

There was a lot of food on the table, sadly, with me having to restrict myself to the veg section only. The trauma has not left me yet and I am sure to go back for those delicious Fish and Chips, Xacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken, Lyula Kebab, Clay pot roasted fauna and the Chicken Cacciatore. The dishes that I tried included-

The Veg Salad- While the plate looked pretty, with colourful veggies tastefully arranged on it, covered in a pesto dressing; it did fail to leave a mark on me. Let‚Äôs just say when I plan to visit again, this won‚Äôt be one of the reasons.

The Jacket Potatoes- These potatoes are soft, well baked, and come with a filling of finely chopped peppers, and corn. The olive slice on top of the potato adds just the right tang and helps to cut back on the creaminess of the utterly gooey cheese. Absolutely recommended.

Clay Pot Roasted Flora- This is a kebab platter curated especially to meet the cravings of the vegetarian crowd.¬† It comprises of two bharwan alu, paneer hariyali kebab (skewered along with some equally tasty onions and tomatoes), cauliflower kebab and broccoli kebab. For the first time in my life I was aiming for the broccoli more than any other item on the platter. Both the Broccoli and the cauliflower were downright amazing. They have the right proportion of masala on them, and a wonderful sprinkle of chat masala on top, which take these kebabs to a whole other level. The bharwan alu comes with a balanced filling of paneer, mixed with assorted spices and anar dana. The sudden burst of sweetness in the mouth from the pomegranate is a welcomed taste after the subtle hit of spice. This is a MUST HAVE, even if you are not a vegetarian.

One thing I noticed across all the dishes served at our table was the balance of flavours. Everything is in right proportion. I do not mind waiting an extra 10 minutes, if my food tastes as appealing as this. Zucca Lounge gives me enough reasons to return to its doors, which I will, soon.

The list of newly opened cafes in Kolkata seems to be never ending with yet another addition to it, Zucca Lounge. The classy caf√© is located somewhat near Triangular Park. The 3rd floor of the building inside which it has been set up is the indoor sitting area and the floor above is an open rooftop caf√©.

The brand banner has some artistic fonts which provides a sophisticated feel. The interiors are plush and boast of some blissfully designed concepts involving LED lights and patterns. The entire caf√© has been given more of a wooden varnish. The rooftop induces a soothing effect as the theme colour being white and provides a much more calming experience than what‚Äôs indoors. Though the furniture is easy on the eyes, its not much comfortable for the primary purpose. Conveniently there is efficient seating arrangements for large groups.
Being a rooftop, and given the climatic conditions that persist for months in Kolkata, you will have to tolerate the humidity if you prefer to go for the terrace option.

What better way is there to beat the summer heat than some refreshing drinks.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Antioxidant‚Ä¶Please : This is a rather health friendly drink made using watermelon, pineapple and cucumber. Being an anti-oxidant, it truly serves its purpose. Its more like a smoothie than a mocktail. Such drinks are a rarity for a caf√©. go for it only if you are health conscious. Great presentation.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Jack Frost : For me, it was a twisted version of pina colada. Pineapple juice blended with blue curacao and cream of coconut. It tastes as good as it looks. The strong pineapple flavour is eminent.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Passion Fruit Mojito : Simply the best drink for the evening. The classic mojito has been given the passion fruit twist for a refreshing new avatar. It had a bright tangy flavour of the passion fruit and for me, this version is better than the original.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Buck‚Äôs Nursery Fizz : This cooler is also something to look forward to. It‚Äôs a tall drink, having orange juice topped with ginger ale and garnished with mint. It has nice flavour of both orange and mint, the combination of which is really revitalising.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Oreo Poppers : This was one of the best oreo shakes I have tried in Kolkata. Proper magnitude of oreo biscuits crushed into the milkshake stirred up a tantalizing flavour. Its topped with whipped cream, cherry and an oreo.

The food here is also as innovative their names. Surprisingly, the quality is also maintained at an acceptable level.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Soups : What a surprise! The soups here are of outstanding quality and have great texture. I was completely shocked to taste such amazing soups at a caf√©. Asparagus Cappuccino is asparagus puree blended with fresh cream and tasted subtle. Mushroom Veloute with roasted garlic butter crouton was the best of the lot. This is a fantasy for mushroom lovers. Tomato, Tarragon & Jalapeno cream soup is a kind of French twist to the tomato soup. The hit of tarragon just kicks it up to the next level. Classic Manchow Soup was virtuous. The spicy element of the soup had nicely been controlled.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Pescatora Salad : Served with baked crispy breads, the salad is a nice assortment of some exotic vegetables with a tasteful dressing.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Zucca Style Jacket Potato : These are semi cut Mexican jacket potato bowls which are filled with cheese and corn. The potatoes had been primly boiled and are used unpeeled. A new dish for the vegetarians.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†The Clay Pot Roasted Treasures of Flora : The mezze platter includes panner tikka style cottage cheese, bharwan aloo, cauliflower and broccoli. The dip/chutney provided adds to the amazing flavours.

Being a newly opened hangout spot, its pretty crowded on weekdays too. Booking might seem a good option or be prepared to face a long queue. All though there was a slight delay before we got our food, given the rush hours, the staff did a commendable job to manage tables.
The place has two 4K projector screens, one on each floor, to cater all the sports enthusiasts with all top level matches.

Do you remember those scenes from the hindi movies - a white bed placed randomly on a beach with lots of white frills, white cushions and white curtains? Well, the moment I entered Zucca Lounge Rooftop Arena, that‚Äôs what struck me - a portion of the sitting area was designed in that fashion!! SO CHIC !!

Along with other food enthusiasts, I was invited for a Food Bloggers Meet at Zucca Lounge.¬† It‚Äôs located at southern avenue, at the far end of Vivekanada Park on the lane which has Fillers. With its strategic location, mind-blowing ambiance and great food/hookah; Zucca Lounge is invincible. I was invited on a Monday evening, and even on a weekday the lounge was bustling with people.

The lounge comprises of two floors. Once you enter, you will have to take the lift to the 3rd Floor to enter the first arena. This is the closed sitting area. Everything here looks very funky, modish and chic; very pertinent for the youth of today. The stylish coffee cup shaped signboard, the gigantic projector television, the funky light bulbs, the hip posters, the colorful mocktail counter, the ceiling with luminous lights and ropes, the cabin shaped sitting area and the wooden decor gave the place a happening ambiance. We were enthusiastic about the rooftop arena and soon moved to the terrace. Everything here is in white, giving a look of perfection. The white shamiayanas with white cushions, frills and curtains looked quintessentially filmy.¬† I personally fell in love with the shamiyanas and its white, peaceful, tranquil look. Rest of the area has bold white furniture and a big projector TV. The entire place had a very positive vibe about itself. The rooftop is worth a visit!

We got seated (of course inside a shimiyana) and our foodathon begun!!

MOCKTAILS:

#Anti-Oxidant: Sugar free concoction of Watermelon, Pineapple, and Cucumber. This red colored drink came in a small jar with few cut fruits in a toothpick for presentation. I loved the look. This drink is refreshing and best for people on a diet.

# Jack Frost: An alluring looking blue colored drink. It came in a small margarita glass, with the sides coated with coconut shavings. This concoction of pineapple juice, blue curacao & cream of coconut was yuumilicious.

#Passion Fruit Mojito: Classic Virgin Mojito with Passion Fruit Syrup. It was the best drink of the evening.

#Buck Nursery Fizz: It came in a tall glass, and looked pretty with its orange color. This combination of ginger ale, orange and mint was delicious, but the strongest flavor that came out of the drink was orange.

#Oreo Shake: It came in a mid-sized jar with an Oreo as garnish. It tasted creamy and yummy! :P

SOUPS:

All the soups were plain DELICIOUS!! (MUST TRY)

#Asparagus Cappuccino: The blend of cream and asparagus was plain perfect. This soup was thick, creamy and was very delectable. This was the showstopper of the evening!!

#Mushroom Veloute with roasted Garlic Butter Crouton: Mushroom is one of my favorites and the soup with was a rich concoction of cream and mushroom did full justice. I loved this soup and its rich mushroom-y flavor. This was one dish that stood out among others.

#Tomato, Tarragon & Jalapeno Cream:¬† With its mustard-y, tangy flavor this soup was marvelous. While not as thick as the others this soup definitely had its own character and was very palatable.

#Classic Manchow(veg): Another classic soup. Being a common Chinese soup I had expectation from it, and it completely lived up to those expectations. This dish came with some fried noodles in a small , funky bucket. It tasted delicious.

SALADS:

We had one veg, one non-veg salad. They were the Pesto Salad and Gado Gado Salad. While both had a lot of fresh veggies like Zuccini(yellow/green), Bell Pepper(red/yellow/green), sugar snaps & carrots , the dressing was too less and tasted slightly bland. Both the salads came with two crispy garlic bread pieces.

STARTERS:

#Zucca Style Jackpot Potato: Mexican style jacket potato stuffed with bell pepper and corn, garnished with chili cheese and olives. The cheese was of great quality and this dish was very palatable. This is a must try.

#Fish tossed in Celery Salt: Coriander and lemon marinated fish with tartar mayo. Strips of well marinated fish fried with bell pepper, onion and garnished with spring onion. It tatsed nice, but was slightly oily.

#Lyula Kabab: Mutton sheek kabab with pudina chatni. Personally I‚Äôm not too fond of sheek kabab so I found it okish.

#Xacuti Spiced Corn Dusted Chicken: This dish was basically deep fried chicken strips. It was not atall oily and tasted yummy.

PLATTERS:

#Clay pot roasted Flora: Cottage Cheese, Bharwan Aloo(minced paneer inside aloo), Cauliflower, Broccoli, Onion, Tomatoes, Padaa and Pudina Chatni came with this platter. The presentation was interesting and this dish tasted good.

#Clay Post Roasted Fauna: This platter had 4 kinds of kababs: Chicken, Prawn, Lamb and Fish with pudina chatni. The quality was fish was exemplary. All the kababs tasted very delicious and were well marinated.

MAINS:

#Creole Style Fish and Chips: Well marinated fish with fries and mayo. The pieces of fish were big, their quality was good and they were well marinated. The taste was plain delicious. This was one of the best of the evening!

#Chicken Cacciatore: Grilled chicken in mushroom-pepper sauce served with mashed potatoes, garlic bread and veggies. This was a very delicious platter. The chicken pieces were big; they were well marinated and well cooked. What a great way to end!

After this sumptuous meal we started clicking a lot of pictures. Well, the ambiance!! Can you blame us! I loved the versatile menu that was especially selected for the Food Bloggers Meet. I had a pleasant experience at Zucca Lounge.¬† While the service was slightly slow, I loved the food and the ambiance. I wish them all the very best for the future.

Tucked at the end of Jatin Bagchi road, a little distance after the French loaf and fillers beside Vivekananda Park. ¬†This place is a treat to to eyes. they offer both indoor and outdoor seating.Though it was a little humid we couldnt resist to sit on the rooftop, the decoration is beautiful. we ordered a hookah, Thai spiced chilly baby corn, Guava and litchy juice.The hookah was decent. the starter had was flavoured with lemon grass and i really liked the balance of flavour, a break from the common crispy chilli baby corn.The juices were decent as well. The pocket pinch is little more compared to other similar cafes.Food: 3.5/5
ambiance:5/5
Value for money: 3/5
presentation : 4/5
Managment and service : 2/5
Happy eating ! :)

Great place to hangout with friends,colleagues. 
Hookah, Delicious foods, mocktails and lovely ambiance under one roof. 
This place has both indoor and rooftop dining facility available with service and quality that you cannot doubt upon.

The Lounge has a lovely ambiance and I liked the music and the best part is the cabbana. It is easily accessible as the lounge is located in the middle of the city.

Coming to food, Xacuti spiced chicken was so tender and spicy. Tossed fish was also awesome.
Mushroom soup is a must try at Zucca. 

Spring water mint Hookah was mind blowing.

Top notch service and it is must visit.

Its a place of exhilaration.The ambience is enlivening and heart-throbbing. I went there with my friends and had a great time at the lounge. The hookah, xacuti spiced chicken and how can I forget the Tossed fish it was amazing. The service was ok¬† with tinge of¬† affection. I would love to go this place again. It would be preferable to go on weekdays rather than going on weekends as it is jam packed on weekends. Its a must visit lounge and hope for a re-visit soon.
Love u ZUCCA !!!!!!!!

Words aren't enough to actually share my experience at ZUCCA . Firstly the cafe's interior are mesmerising with a blend of industrial n pub interiors. The roof top with the beautiful white cabanas give a Mediterranean feel. The mocktails are as refreshing as theira names ,the food is superb with generous servings, sheesha too was smooth n pleasant. I would love to visit it again to re live the fantastic experience.

Beautifully decorated with white theme, comfortable open air terrace with food & sheesha. Food is strictly average but sheesha & beverages ( non alcoholic) are quite good. Went there couple of times and among food, like their pizza section. Lemon iced tea is also good here. Stuffs are helpful & polite. Excellent view from the open terrace. It's all about the ambience, one can visit this place ! Pocket pinch : Moderate !

Recently visited this place again, for the 2nd time. This time had to wait for 45 mins just for a single hukka. Don't know what's wrong was with them. May be they had shortage of anything, but they should tell us clearly that. Highly unprofessional !/

Another hookah bar with a lovely ambiance.. Spacious and has both indoor n outdoor sitting area.. Management has really worked on the interiors and even the cutlery were well designed.. Now comes the main part.. Hookah was good and even food was nice.. Names given to the dishes looked attractive and different bt when we were served they were nothing extraordinary rather were like we are having normal ordinary dishes... We have tried from pizza (only 1 size available) , pasta, pan fried noodles which was actually an American chopsey, BBQ cottage cheese, a juice mixture of watermelon-pineapple-cucumber (tastes only of watermelon).. Service was really slow and everything needs to b told twice to the staff.. The rates were also kept in that manner which are too high and even the quantity was not at all satisfactory.. As its a new place and located at the d best area, management should try to improve on the things mentioned and specially the rates..

This place is certainly a good lounge to hang out at, the USP of which is probably rooftop seating arrangement. But considering the fact that it's Kolkata and also summer, you'd have to really ignore the humidity and the heat to sit up there. The service was nice. On entry we were directed to the 3rd floor since they didn't have any vacant seats up top. That said, the floor manager was nice enough to come and personally tell us after about 10 mins on the 3rd floor that 3 seats were then available up on the roof. 

We ordered a hukka, a milkshake, smoothie and a latt√©. The milkshake was good, though I didn't find cookies in the zucca cookie shake. It seemed like biscuits to me. I could be wrong, though. The quantity was a lot, though. The banana smoothie was actually better than my milkshake. 

Overall, it was a nice experience. A good and affordable place to catch up with people at. The decor and ambience were beautiful. I'd really love the music to be a bit louder, though and more songs in the list, if that's fine.

We visited recently it is a really nice place. The staff is nice but the manager Ms. SONIA is very rude as she wanted us to shift from a table which was reserved for the owner, she didnt even place our order till they shifted us to a new table. I am just writing this to make the owner and manager realize that if you are opening a lounge it is meant to be served to customers and not the owners. Most importantly there is a decorum to maintain and a manner to speak. Insulting a customer isn't right.

This was my first time at Zucca , I liked the ambience with  cabanas and contemporary interiors . With respect food ,it was tasty and fresh and I would recomemend the lychee frost. The dressing and presentation of food only adds to the overall experience .

One of the best hookah kafe in Kolkata. Easy to locate. The best thing about this place is the ambience... The rooftop is just amazing...sitting in the city but doesn't feel like it!!! 3rd floor is done up tastefully. The place gives good vibes... Great music, great place to enjoy hookah with friends.
Food is good loved d lychee mocktail very refreshing!! Totally recommended in love with the place!

A new lounge in Southern Avenue, pretty easy to locate. We visited it on a weekend evening and fell in love with the interiors of the place. Very well done,gives you happy vibes on being there. 
We sat on the rooftop and the pleasant weather added to our experience. 
Service-Decent enough but all the servers have the habit of forgetting what you call for. You would get them after several reminders.

Shisha-A teen PAN rose which took 35 minutes to come post ordering, was fine for a while and then started chocking.

Oreo shake-one of the best shakes I've had in recent times,not overtly sweet and tasted too good.

Tossed cottage cheese-rubbery paneer and not well cooked. Highly disappointing. 
 
An amazing place to be, please work on the food and service though :)

The ambience of the rooftop is amazing. The staff courteous. Loads of parking on the road. They have big screens on the rooftop and the indoor outlets.
However, the food is disappointing and they have very slow service. I ordered a pizza, Thai Babycorn and Clay Pot platter. We did not like either of the dishes. We had to waste more than half of every dish. I personally found that all the items are over priced. I would not recommend this place unless if only having a hookah and mocktails is what you desire.

Zucca Lounge - A Lounge with an amazing ambiance and rooftop!!
=====
Intro+Location:¬†

I had been to Zucca lounge with a friend of mine. I had first been to the lounge section which was nicely made. However, later on, i and my friend decided to sit in the rooftop section. The rooftop section is purely white with a projector screen. I really liked the seating as well as the ambiance. It is very nicely decorated and i really was enjoying the rooftop feel here.¬†

The hospitality of this place is nice where the owner as well as the manager keeps on attending the tables to see whether the customer needs anything or not. I really like that kind of gesture.¬†
=====
What I ordered:

‚Ä¢ Jack Frost - It was a fusion drink with coconut punch. I really loved this drink and i recommend all of you to try it. It was something which i found really distinct. Coconut to the drink made it quite refreshing and sweet to taste. The presentation was excellent. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Antioxidant - It was watermelon with cucumber mix with other great ingredients. It was nicely presented and tasted good. Must try for health conscious people. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Thai Baby Corn - It was amazing. Crispy chilli baby corn with lemon grass. Lemon grass really enhanced the flavor. Amazing it was. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Brain Freezer Hookah - It was choking initially. It was made by one of their staff Ali who was quite feeling unhappy and sad and had said me that he was feeling terrible and he tried changing it as well. Nevertheless, a fresh hookah was made for me and that was smoky and lasted long. It was really a down to earth gesture of him which i really appreciate and was constantly apologizing for the hookah issues.¬†

‚Ä¢ Amazing mocktails.¬†
‚Ä¢ Great food presentation
‚Ä¢ Has good projector screen for live sports screening

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Hookah could be enhanced more.¬†

Conclusion: 

It was an amazing experience here. The ambiance is exquisite and top notch. I will visit it soon again. The mocktails are amazing here. One must try jack frost specially. :)¬†

Posting this review while im sitting here.... Wait time is too long.... Had to wait for 45mins for a hookah, where  3 couples ( unknown to each other, in total 6) had entered at the exact same time. We were left to wait for 45mins, asked to chnged to another table.. Attended other guests earlier than us... Service is very poor ... Ambience is a 10/10..... Didnt expect such a service with such a good rating on zomato.. Would think twice before visiting this place again... Didnt order any food because of the previous experience of waiting too long..

With just a few buildings away from Fillers, the place is easy to be found.
Talking about the ambience, its the ideal place on a breezy evening with canopies well lit along with comfortable sitting.
Well, the dishes are a bit too pricey with not too justifiable portions. Something that should be worked upon.

Worth more than just one visit, specially for the ambience (4th floor). Cheers!

Visited on May 20th. 

The pictures that I saw on Zomato were too luring to refrain from this place!

Location : Right opposite to Vivekananda Park, on the same side as Fillers, in the turning of that road. Right between King & Queen Beauty Parlour and Fillers.

Interiors : There are two floors, 3rd and 4th. 3rd has its indoor section. And 4th, the rooftop area. The indoor section is beautifully made. It looks classy with the wooden interiors and a bar like area. While sitting beside the glasses, that give you a view of the outside, you can see green trees and trees with beautiful red flowers. If you're a nature lover or a poetic, and if it's raining, you'll go in your desired world!
The 4th floor, the rooftop, is the White-Land! Elegant white coloured seating and very beautifully arranged.

Service and Music : The place played good music, very well selected!
Service was good. I had visited when there wasn't much crowd, so this aspect could differ! May or may not.

Food and Hukah : Clay Pot roasted Treasures of Flora (Veg) is the dish that I had ordered. It was presented amazingly, with perfect two pieces of each item in the platter. Hukah was good.

Pocket Pinch : This is where I cut some marks. The drinks and Hukah are fine but the food items are over priced without a doubt. It's not what a caf√© would rate their food at. Although the food was great but I think they should lower their rates, particularly seeing the area where this place is located. People will surely hesitate while going through the menu.
One Hukah, One bottle of water and One Main costed me ‚Çπ760/-. Hukah rate was ‚Çπ300 approximately (normal) and the food was ‚Çπ400!

I liked the place, it was a good experience and would definitely recommend my followers and friends to visit this place!

It's opposite Vivekanand park on the fillers side. 
Ambience is great. They have sitting on roof top and indoor as well. Big screen is available too. Roof area is nicely done. Shisha and food is great as well. 

Little expensive.

Based on last visit,
Food has deteriorated like anything!
Service need to be looked into.

A newly opened sheesha place in Southern Avenue near fillers. It has 2 floors 3rd for indoor seating with aircon and 4th floor which is a rooftop. The place has been really well made with comfortable seating and brilliant interiors.

I did not try their food but did order for the mojito and oreo poppers. The mojito was flat and lacking the taste of a classic mojito which they did change after we told them. The oreo poppers or oreo shake was very liquidy. These shakes are supposed to be thick. The taste was thus not upto the mark. 

The sheesha was good with good smoke and flavor and no complaints during the entire time.

The staff are very attentive and ready to help but the place needs to improve in terms of quality.

Must visit once its really, such a nice place for hang out of any age ppl...fabulous ambience...terrace one is outstanding feeling inside cabana other side open Vivekananda park. Divine food along with varieties of mock tails. Hookah/sheesha tastes are different that other cafes. One must try as its ease in communication hassle free parking etc. Good Luck #Zucca making such a lovely place and all¬†your future endeavor's.

A newly opened hookah lounge in the heart of the city. For starters this place has a great ambience. Zucca has both indoor and rooftop seating arrangement. Food is good although slightly overpriced than their other counterparts. Masala fries with harissa ketchup and xacuti spices corn dusted chicken is a must try for all the spice lovers!!Salads..not so much.We also ordered the clay pot roasted treasure of fauna, its a great platter for all the tandoori lovers.
