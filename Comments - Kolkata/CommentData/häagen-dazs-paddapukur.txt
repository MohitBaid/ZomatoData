Conveniently situated in Sarat Bose Road, H√§agen-Dazs
 was my pre birthday surprise. I had previously heard a lot about this place and wanted to visit it someday. It did manage to live upto my expectations, Commendable staff behaviour ; very warm and helpful. I had ordered a Chocolate Brownie Explosion. It is just the right item to order when you're having an excessive chocolate craving. Large scoops of Chocolate ice-cream, Belgian chocolate ice-cream and vanilla caramel brownie ice-cream teamed with heavy cream, chocolate sauce and brownie is a treat to the taste buds. Pricing maybe a little on the expensive side, but it is worth every penny! A must visit :)

Cosy place. Decent decor. Delicious . We had a nice experience. Extremely courteous service. We had waffles, sorbet, ice creams. Quite on the expensive side. Similar quality can be had at much cheaper price in Kolkata local brands and even Baskin Robbins is cheaper. The Hagen Daz tubs that you can buy at Supermarkets like Spencers are less expensive than what is available at the parlour.

We discovered this place on one of our trips and you can‚Äôt imagine how excited we were that H√§agan Dazs had opened up in Kolkata..

What we have here is a gorgeous looking platter and it‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúChocolate Tasting Journey‚Äù 
This dessert platter has a Belgian Chocolate ice-cream cupcake, a rich cocoa brownie, a cup of simply delectable warm Belgian hot chocolate and an ice-cream cake which they call a ‚ÄòChocolate Semi Freddo‚Äô
So, for all of you who love chocolate and ice-cream, like we both do, this is a must try.

I've been to the outlet in Chennai and I must say I liked the flavours of the ice cream there more. I ordered the Eiffel tower. 
The brownie was very rich and heavy and I couldn't finish it alone. 
The ice scoops like I said were good but nothing great because I've had the same thing in Chennai before and I liked it more there.

It isn't cheap on your pocket but then Haagen Dazs for years has been the emblem of luxury desserts in most countries in the West, new to Kolkata and India I found the berry flavours to be more enticing than the chocolate ones. It's not too pocket friendly but in any which case nothing good comes cheap these days. But the Haagen Dazs ice creams available in supermarket freezers tastes better as it has no ice crystals but the one at their outlet has slight ice crystals. Now that's a real let down for the money you pay.

Went for the Eiffel, but crossed Seven Clouds instead. Seven distinct flavours chosen by me and my partner. Each flavour was given on a taster spoon. Any number of ice creams can be tasted. For this dish, seven flavours to be chosen. Tiramisu is a personal favourite. Liquid nitrogen cooling mechanism utilised. 
Amazing grace.

H√§agen-Dazs is an American ice cream brand. Starting with only three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and coffee, the company opened its first retail store in Brooklyn at 1961 and now after 56 years of success they came to city of joy with their 2 outlets.

I had great expectation from them but they let me down quite a bit.

I had cookies and cream crunch which had no cookies and only Oreo biscuit, so technically I paid around 600 rs for Oreo with vanilla ice cream.

Another thing I had was brownie with chocolate, it was good though. So my rating is only based on that.

Bill amount was 1455 for two ice creams.

Was treated very poorly by the staff here today. The new menu has increased prices of most dishes to Rs. 600-700+ and when I politely asked the staff if the manager can revert back to a previous menu as the dish I liked (which was also lower-priced in the Rs. 300-400 range) was not available anymore, and a staff member told me 'Sir, jo menu main hai aap vo khaiye, varna aap yahaan se jaa sakte hai' (Sir, you can can choose from the menu otherwise you can leave) - not the kind of service one would expect from an internationally renowned ice-cream store. John Saha was the server who was particularly rude and when I asked the manager, Pinto Acharya, for a complaint or suggestion form, I was told that there is no such form with the staff! Very strange! Don't plan on coming back here ever again after being treated so poorly - it was not worth eating here - and while I kept my companion company, I left as soon as he finished his meal.

It comprised of Cookies and Cream and Belgian Chocolate ice-cream along with brownie and dark chocolate slabs. It looked amazing and the taste was good as well.

To my suprise all flavours were awesum .The presentation was amazing .I enjoyed Rasberry sorbet ,Blueberry and my most fav now has become MANGO SORBET. The ice cream was soft and fresh just the way i wanted it to be.a complete treat in itself .i hope the other branches replicate the magic and quality .All the best team Haagen -Dazs.

I went to this H√§agen Dazs outlet with my boyfriend yesterday. The staff were very helpful and they asked us to try out a few flavours before placing the final order.
What We Had--
Seventh Heaven-- The dish contains seven H√§agen Dazs flavoured ice-creams of your choice, along with fruits & other toppings.. We chose Belgian Chocolate, Mango Sorbet, Strawberry Cheesecake, Pralines & Cream, Cookies & Cream, Caramel Cone and Tiramisu. All the flavours were just out of the world. The name 'Seventh Heaven' is totally justified!
Waffle Mania-- The dish contains a Waffle, 1 or 2 scoops of H√§agen Dazs flavoured ice-cream of your choice and toppings. We chose a scoop of Belgian Chocolate ice-cream and Chocolate sauce to go with it. Everything tasted great and was very filling. This is a great option if you want to try out this place but go light on your pocket.
What We Liked--
Both the desserts we ordered were excellent. The ambience was really nice and the service was great.
Pocket Pinch--
Seventh Heaven: Rs. 875+Tax 
Waffle Mania: Starts from Rs. 295+Tax
Our total bill was around Rs. 1400.
Verdict--
People complain that it's expensive but I'll say it's every bit worth the money. We will definitely visit again.

This place was my midnight stop during some late night pandal hopping on Panchami. A decent neat and spacious ice cream parlour offering some signature premium ice cream creations like the Eiffel Tower and also Create Your Own ice cream, drinks, ice cream cakes, sundaes etc.
I opted for a scoop of strawberry cheesecake flavoured ice cream topped with cone chips from the choice of toppings offered under Crunchy Toppings.
The ice cream was fresh with a smooth texture along with the crunchy feel of the cone chips, but flavour I felt can be made more scrumptious.
Those fond of ice cream, desserts can check out Haagen-Dazs.

Located at Sarat Bose Road near fernsnpetals ... Haagen Dazs might put a dent in your pocket but for all the right reasons. Lets keep the price aside cause that's the price of Haagen Dazs ice cream globally. What they do offer apart from of course world class ice cream are innovative ways to present them. Me and my friend tried the Paradise signature dessert which consisted of 7 flavour out of 19. It was customisable, so we went and chose at random. The flavour which impressed me the most were Raspberry sorbet , blue berry and cream , summer berries and cream and Belgium chocolate. The presentation was outstanding. The floor manager out there was also quite welcoming and asked us about our experience. I told him about the need for a better ambiance, and he assured me that they will soon revamp the decor and also add new flavour. Will visit again to try the other flavour !

Very popular Eiffel Tower..is more a marvel in presentation than a gourmet ice cream. Beautifully erected using chocolate towers, brownie, large chocolate scoop, this is innovative but the conservative in me would have preferred to savouries the ice cream without any frills.
Belgian chocolate with cream and cookies was sinful and is a delight for any chocolate crazy person. 
As for me the blueberry ice cream served very thoughtfully in a chilled goblet was pure Bliss...plain and effective...the richness of the ice cream with abundant blueberry dotting your every bite, the subtle flavour and the sickness of the whole mass sinfully melting inside your mouth.....heaven...

Will just say that the ice cream flavours especially that of Tiramisu, Blackcurrant and Cookie n cream are outstandingly amazing. My recent visit introduced me to the Belgian Hot Chocolate which gave me craving for more. Such was it's taste. I really feel great that ice cream outlets like this have changed the dessert eating scene of the city. Will come back for more.

Though i found it expensive a lot.. but you should tryout once..coz its sufficient for minimum 4 people..
Impressed with the presentation and there service for that 10/10

Haagen Dazs is pronounced exactly as it written and the umlaaut has no particular significance in its pronunciation. Like it's very clear name, it lives up to the hype it is. 

It is located on 1st floor right on the main road opposite Sarat Bose road. It is the biggest and most spacious ice cream parlour I've been to the city  (Correct me if I'm wrong). Brightly lit with ample seating and good servers and the best Ice cream? 

Had popped in for a take away, and they put in dry ice and packed it so well that it was in intact condition after 1.5 hours. Not kidding. 

The ice cream tasty, obviously expensive but worth a visit. 

Plus it's open till late.

If you are an ice-cream lover you simply can't miss out on this one. I have been planning to visit this Paddapukur outlet for quite some time and finally, I went there today. Four of us were there and we ordered the 'Brooklyn Bridge'. It was pretty unbelievable. I liked the chocolate scoop most among the three (I feel I am biassed towards chocolate), but the other two were equally great.
Now about the ambience, it was good. The hosts definitely deserve a special mention for I found them good-natured to the truest sense of the term.

Good experience, a lot of options to choose from. Wish they had an eggless option too! If you go after 12 then chances are everything will be finished! But the taste is good :)

Had an amazing experience at H√§agen-Dazs. The staff was very cordial and John attended to us with promptness. The ice creams were out of the world and thanks to John for suggesting us Howrah Bridge.. overall had a wonderful time there. A must visit place for all ice cream lovers..!!

I was really looking forward to trying this place in Kolkata after trying and loving their desserts in Mumbai. Unfortunately the expectations were too high and they failed to meet it.

Ambience- (2/5) - it looks extremely ordinary with red chairs like a local ice-cream parlour. The tables were shakey because of which we almost dropped our food. Also, there was water on the chairs which we noticed after sitting. To add on, there were mosquitos and flies everywhere.
Food - (2/5) we just took 1 dessert and 1 cookie and ended up spending 800 Rs. If you pay this huge an amount you would expect the quality to be good but that was not the case. The brownie was stale and extremely hard. The grapes were stable too. The ice-cream was good but then who pays 800rs for just a scoop of ice-cream!???
Hospitality - (2/5) - We were greeted by the staff and directed to the table to be seated. But when we complained about the quality of the brownie, he did not bother to change the dessert and the least that he should have done was to apologise for the same.

If this is how franchise opportunity works in Calcutta, then there is no doubt why the good global chains refuse to open stores here.

Came here with my friends to satisfy our desert cravings and truly went back home satisfied . We were 5 of us and gorged on chocolate fondue and Eiffel tower from their menu . Bit expensive from usual but totally worth a try . It was yummm.

After lunch if you're thinking about fine mouthwatering desert or something like we called "ice-cream" then I'll definitely say this is the right place to be here. Decoration is very simple eye-catching which actually makes it extraordinary and the combination of red-black-white is completely brilliant. Now its time for the menu, each item is very unique and served with a twist. Coming to taste, in one word I'll say exceptionally-brilliant, very fresh and the texture is perfectly fine. "Belgium Waffle Dream Praline & Cream Dulce De Leche" is that one item which actually outperformed others in the menu that what I think and everyone should try this if you're visiting for the first time. Price is relatively more than affordable but if you think about Quality-Price-Quantity relationship then actually its perfectly fine, no overpricing. Now coming to the hygiene part, its clean and all the measures had taken as per the requirements but definitely its need consistency for the forthcoming days as well.
So I'll be concluding definitely by saying that they're a brilliant-core follower of CRM(Customer Relationship Management) but can't say anything on TQM(Total Quality Management) as this is my first time and for this I need some more visit to experience the consistency on the TQM part though on the basis of the first day they're all performing brilliantly on TQM as well.

Pure Bliss is what I felt after visiting this place.. oh man this parlor is damn good.. their signature and classics are too amazing and just love the Brooklyn bridge, the Eifel tower, the fondue.. h√§agen dazs ice cream had been my favorite since long and this place does justice playing with flavors and taste buds.. however I found it to be a little on the pricier side.. but it's worth it..

First time visit to the place and tried an off menu item - the Howrah Bridge dessert. They are adding this on the menu soon and we were suggested to try this. And honesty this didn't disappoint. 5 scoops of their best ice creams on a base of brownie tasted blissful. The chocolate dressing which made the bridge could have been better. Perhaps the only downside of the entire preparation. Apart from that, the experience was worth it. Also full marks to the courteous staff.

Initially, I didn't really have a good experience at this place. Howsoever, to make things up they went an extra mile and eradicated any bitterness I had in my previous experience. Mistakes happen, but they are fine as long we recognise and rectify them. The delicious flavours of ice cream and the courteous staff make this a must try joint!

the sudden plan happened suddenly and we entered this place ...a rainy afternoon after a great lunch..  plenty of seats to seat .. red interior.. and music .. what else do you need to invite the best craving for ice cream? at first i was little tensed after looking at the prices .. but trust me you won't regret spending a bit more for this ice cream parlour ..first we ordered Belgian waffle dream ..just after the first spoon.. we felt it it has come straight from heaven ..really a very few places are there in Kolkata where you literally fill your mind with dessert to this extent...  later we also ordered another scoop with waffle and caramel sauce .. that too kept up our expectation .. the staffs are really good .. they offer very good hospitality right from the moment you enter .. lastly, thank you for giving us a place to have a superb experience

Date of Visit : 25/06/17 (My birthday eve) 

Had gone to the Quest Mall outlet first but they were out of stock so came to the Sarat Bose Road one. I'm glad we did. This outlet is a lot bigger than the Quest Mall one and we also got a surprise over here. 

Ambiance : The smell of cocoa, coffee and a lot of amazing fragrance greets you as soon as you enter the outlet. It's a beautiful cozy place. 

Service/Server: we had a very friendly and warm server called John. As we were surfing through the menu and my fianc√© wanted to treat me to one of their specials, I think John overheard us talking about the Brooklyn Bridge so he came over and very politely said that can I give you a suggestion. Well, his suggestion turned out to be a surprise instead. They're introducing a bigger and better version of the Brooklyn Bridge called the Howrah Bridge. So, as an introductory offer, they offered it to us at the same price as the Brooklyn Bridge. 

Food: So, more about the Howrah Bridge. It had 5 scoops of ice-cream on top - caramel, chocolate, mango, blueberry and coffee, 3 layers of ice-cream and brownie at the bottom, dark chocolate, kiwis and cherries. It looked so pretty! Though it's a huge one, all the flavours are so beautifully blended so nothing was too overpowering and it wasn't too hard to finish. It was a great start to my birthday.

If there is a sin that you would perhaps want to commit and repeat knowingly, Haagen-Dazs is the place to be in. Yes sin because your doctor advices you to cut down on calories while the moment you walk up the stairs to this temple of ice-creams you give in to the worldly temptations, one of the basic human instincts. There is nothing that is bad when it comes to the¬†product or quality or service per se. May be they should seriously think of smaller portions for those with a guilt !! 

If anything that I didn't perhaps like would be the washroom !! No I am not coming back unless I do another 1000 round of exercises. And I am very serious!!

World's best ice cream parlour! Being a dessert fanatic this was heaven for me. Each of the flavours are so good that it gets hard to decide among them. We decided to make our own dish. So we added 3 scoops of ice cream Strawberry Cheesecake, Oreo and Vanilla Biscuit, and Mango along with classic Belgian waffles and Brownie. The presentation was remarkable and the each and every bite was heavenly. Their service is equally good and courteous. Perfect place to go on a date. And for all the dessert lovers this is a place you just cannot miss out on. Hope to visit soon again!

The renowned international ice cream chain does manage to keep up the reputation in the city of joy! This outlet is quite spacious and can accommodate many people together. Their pricing is extremely high but then its absolutely worth that! 

Ordered : 

1. Eiffel tower : A brownie topped with two scoops of vanilla and Belgium chocolate ice cream and chocolate that was shaped as the landmark which gives it such a name. It was beautiful both to the eyes and the taste buds. 

2. Seventh heaven : Seven scoops of ice cream served with fresh fruits. The presentation is brilliant and all the flavours (you can select the scoops) were very good.

A must visit.

Ice creams are always a YES for me. And all of a sudden we planned to visit the outlet to try it.
The parlour is a very cozy and spaced out with little tables all around. It lets for take out or have a comfortable and delicious date there.
The cupcakes looked amazing but we craved ice cream then. So straight headed to look at the varieties , and mind was blown.
We ordered for Belgian chocolate and raspberry sorbet in cones. They are generous with their servings of ice cream and standard is beyond any complains.

Chocolate tasted creamy and a strong hit of chocolate was there . Obviously cocoa lovers gonna die for it.
Sorbet for tangy, the colour was so so attractive and refreshing.

Coming back soon for cupcakes and other flavours

My experience at H√§agen-Dazs was sort of disappointing to me. However, i am quite happy that finally an outlet of this world famous ice cream brand has finally opened in Kolkata, so far we were only able to eat those ice cream brands from convenience store and now it's finally on the street. H√§agen-Dazs was really popular and was on the trending list when it was first opened, and it is still trending and I can see why. 
When I first entered, it was a small place. It had about 6 to 7 tables and it was brightly lighted. It was around 9pm. The server was really nice and well spoken. We ordered for seven heaven which included the following 7 scoops of different flavours of ice cream: Belgium Chocolate, Macadamia Nut, Blueberry & Cream, Dulce De Leche, Strawberry Cheesecake, Mango & Raspberry and vanilla. So far my favourite was only vanilla. It also came with seasonal fruits, such as kiwi, green apples and big grapes. It also came with nitrogen mixed with water ( it is only my assumption that it is mixed with water because the server advised us not to mix it, and it was only for presentation ). I was a bit disappointed because I expected the ice cream to harden up.
We ordered for 2 flavours of macaroon: lemon and coffee. Not a big fan of lemon but coffee was better.
We ordered two portion of waffles. It came with honey, whipped cream and strawberries. I really loved those.
Lastly we ordered for americano and cafe latte iced. Drinks were okay 
For all those, the bill came about rs1800. It's definitely not pocket friendly. Might come again later to try out something new here.

The ice cream major lives up to its name and reputation serving the classiest ice creams. It isn't just an ice cream brand but offers a complete experience. 
The outlet is located in a very accessible locality. The staff is courteous and attentive.
The atmosphere is quaint and calm.
We ordered the "Eiffel Tower" & "The chocolate journey" and both lives up to or rather exceeded expectations. 
No wonder this place is packed throughout and giving stiff completion to surrounding ice cream brands.
Strongly recommended!

H√§agen Dazs is one of my favourite Ice Cream Brands. I had a mixed feeling when I went to this outlet, though.
They didn't seem to have all the flavours, even the ones that are their more Classic Flavours. Even the staff serving didn't have much idea about the flavours that they did or didn't have. 
However thumbs up to their Customer Handling because the moment I pointed out that my scoop had frost in it, not only did they replace the scoop but also gave complimentary Macarons.

However they really do need to buck up.

I have never witnessed something as bad as this.i had ordered for the European fondue,priced at a whopping 2500 bucks and what came served in a tray was sheer disaapoijtment. The chocolate and caramel syrup tasted pathetic to say the least. The fruits were stale, waffles were burnt.the ice creams scoops which held only a small portion of the whole thing was the only amazing thing. the rest were pathetic as ever.

The brand ¬†H√§agen-Dazs needs no introduction to lovers of these frozen treats around the world. Naturally, I too was quite excited when I heard that they were setting shop in our city. However, my experience there was a mixed bag of emotions to say the least.¬†

Starting off with the ambience, though decent and plush for an ice-cream parlour/lounge, wasn't to my taste. Personally, to lend an atmosphere of luxury, I would expect a dimmer lighting or at least yellow lighting instead of white lights in the space. The seating could be a tad bit more elegant to enhance the image of opulence. I am not sure whether the company mandates a specified style to be followed while setting up an outlet but these are my two cents regarding the interiors of the place.

We tried the vastly advertised Eiffel Tower at the outlet. It comes with one large scoop of Belgian chocolate and one small scoop of cookies & cream sitting a top a bed of brownie. The tapering look of the structure is completed with small strawberry upon the rest. It is flanked with two large pieces of dark chocolate cut-out in the shape of the eponymous monument. Cocoa powder is sprinkled on the plate to give the impression of a shadow cast by the towering behemoth. Finally, sliced strawberries with whipped cream adorn the corner of the plate. Full marks to the presentation which was exactly as seen on the various hoardings and newspaper adverts.¬†

Coming to the taste, the flavours of each item on the plate were curated to complement each other, however, the taste of each individually wasn't commensurate to the Rs. 750 bill cost (including taxes). While I understand that the pricing is standardised across board, I personally felt that a similar taste could be enjoyed at other premium ice cream outlets in the city, at half the price.¬†

In conclusion, I am presently inclined towards staying loyal to the other premium ice-cream outlets in the city and perhaps only a strong recommendation can draw me back to this outlet.

The long awaited ice cream brand is here in Kolkata now! Seeing a picture in facebook i was excited to try the Eiffel Tower here. The taste was good with the brownie and begium chocolate ice cream over it, but is too overpriced. It took Rs.716 for the one but nothing extraordinary was found in it except for the presentation. It was not crowded at the time i visited. Service was good.

So happy that finally a good icecream parlour has opened in Kolkata. Even though their icecream is a little sweet, they are made from fresh cream and flavours. Some of my favourites are the macadamia nut, vanilla and the Belgium dark chocolate. Their sundaes are delicious as well. A bit pricey but worth every penny. A must try

The best quality of cold desert as yet tasted. The pricing is very very high like it's Rs.195/- + tax for one single scoop. But then again once you have the desert it's like the highest is quality cold desert you can have. If you don't taste it, it's purely a missed chance for you. Being a cold desert lover it's a must visit place.

Thanks to this place we finally get to have a variety of the flavours of World's best IceCream.

With simple decent decor this place is well lighted and spacious.
The Brand HaagenDazs gets a 5/5 but this outlet probably deserves a 2/5. Been here twice, that too on Sundays and they never have their signature dishes. That's a shame.
The first weekend i wanted to try the Eiffel Tower which wasn't available.
The next weekend i wanted to try the Brooklyn Bridge which again wasn't available.

Though the prices might look steep (its expensive worldwide), but, there's no questioning about the quality cause the ice creams are just awesome.

This was my first visit to the place and it was absolutely amazing!  The wide array of ice creams are sure to tantalize your taste buds! They have a varied range of items on the menu including fondues, sundaes, hot chocolate and even coffee. We had ordered a banana split and a Belgian waffle dream. Both were equally good in terms of taste, quality and quantity. But my personal favourite is the Belgian waffle dream, it's a must try! Warm waffles served with two scoops of ice cream, a perfect blend of flavours! About the interiors, it was rather small and congested, they could've chosen a bigger area to accomodate more customers. But it was well lit and provided courteous service to its customers. It was a wonderful experience altogether, an ultimate haven for ice cream lovers and sweet tooth stricken victims like me! Yes, its expensive but definitely worth your money! Looking forward to more  visits!

After knowing that hagen dazs has opened in kolkata we rushed to try the delicious looking desserts .. The store is small but ok nothing extravagant interiors 
We ordered the eifel tower which was okay for the price being charged the chocolate was thick bar and no finishing taste was regular
Then we ordered europeon fondue which was biggest disappointment as the fondue was too thin strwberries were not fresh and preferred thick fondue    The ice creams were of weird flavour 
Over all okayish not worth the money at all

First ice cream parlour which has a waiting outside because they don't have enough people to serve and manage the crowd. Being such a famous brand they behave as if they are doing us a favor by serving us. A very unprofessional and mismanaged outlet. I would rather wait for other outlets to open than to go back to this one. 
I would have given a negative rating but that was not an option.

I visited the Haagen Dazs lounge when I visited kolkata few days back, it was a surprise for me seeing such a lovely ice cream lounge in kolkata. I never thought that it would be of such an awesome standard, it was almost matching the Delhi standards. But I must say kolkata is developing. The creations were great specially Brooklyn Bridge. I also had a Belgian chocolate and mango raspberry which were amazing . Would definitely love to come here again and again as I do come frequently to kolkata. A must visit place for ice cream lovers .

So, the big daddy of ice creams has now come to Kolkata after a long long wait. I have been a very big fan of this brand whenever I travelled abroad. But my experience with H√§agen-Dazs in India have always been okayish. And I would just not recommend you to try out this chain in India. Truly!
Came here yesterday with my family as the brand was in town and I haven't paid a visit yet. But we were so disappointed with their stock and service that I am sure about not coming back here again.
It was so crowded there last night which was an obvious affair for it was the Bengali New Year. The staffs hardly had any crowd management skills and it was an utter chaos. Finally, we managed a table of four.
The place is located on the first floor of a building. It is very spacious, lighted up and the d√©cor is all classy, perfectly suited to the H√§agen-Dazs style. That was the only thing I liked at one glance. It's better to call this place an ice cream restaurant for the place is too big for an ice cream parlour.
I was looking for my favourite H√§agen-Dazs flavour Dulche de Leche. It wasn't available. When I visited the same brand in Bangalore, it wasn't available there as well. They have a very attractive and elaborate menu to show off. But trust me, you will get only 5-6 varieties at the store. Rest are just said to be over anytime ‚Äãof the day you visit.
We didn't opt the Eiffel Tower or the Brooklyn Bridge as those sundaes are too overpriced, we tried two of the flavours -
Mango and Raspberry Cream
Summer Berries and Cream.
Honestly, both the ice creams tasted similar, no difference in flavours even. And just one scoop charged us 235 all inclusive.
My last two experiences with H√§agen-Dazs India have been really pathetic in Bangalore and Kolkata. I don't know if they have degraded in such a manner all over the world or is the service, taste and everything is this pathetic only in India.
I am just not going to recommend this place. I have made a decision last night - it's wise not to try this brand in India because they are massively overpriced and tastewise, it is below average. Hence, a big thumbs down for H√§agen-Dazs Kolkata! That's it!

H√§agen - Dazs is a loved ice-cream brand worldwide and this branch on the Paddapukur main road does complete justice to its pedigree. Along with a delightful spread of ice-creams, this place also offers mouthwatering brownies and macaroons to choose from. The cookies n cream is a personal favourite  and the sorbets are a must try to beat the heat. Overall, great choice when in the mood to indulge.

Went to Haagen-Dazs today at 12:25pm to order Seventh Heaven & Eiffel Tower just to get a weird reply from the not so hospitable attendant that it will take one & half hours to serve.Astonished me demanded the reason and he said that they need time to arrange the store.The opening time is 12 noon,so are you kidding me?When I said that we are ready to wait then he told we need to order normal scoops which costs Rs 195 for a single one,whereas there are seven scoops in Seventh Heaven which costs Rs 895.Couldn't understand the pricing strategy frankly.Disgusted,left the place.Didn't expected such a BAD experience.

This place serves art in the name of ice cream, very costly but worth each penny, we made a sudden plan on Friday night to have some ice cream, and we came here it was almost 11 but the place was filled with people, we ordered Seventh Heaven - Seven scoop of our choice with fruits and chocolate sauce, and absolutely marvel. A must visit place.

Excellent at what they do. The ice cream parlour in Calcutta. The price may be considerably high but it is absolutely worth it. I first had the Eiffel Tower in Chennai Phoenix mall. Since then I had been longing for it to open an outlet in Kolkata. And once again it exceeded my expectation. Worth the money you pay for any of it. Tried the Seventh Heaven here, and indeed was amazing. A must and a must recommended ice cream parlour.

Location-Paddapukur,Kolkata.

Finally a Haggen Dazs outlet in Kolkata.I have heard alot about this brand but it was first time we were having its dessert.Though they are quite innovative with their dessert but we found them extremely over priced.We tried their "Eiffle Tower" and along with it single scoops of "Cookie and Cream" and "Belgian Chocolate".All the above flavours and creation were good but not worth the money spent.

After this we paid three consistent visits on weekends to try their other creations but every time we heard from them the same problem.Such kind of service was not expected from such a renowned brand.Every time either they seem to be out of stock with few elements or their machine seems to be not working.Hope that they will improve such faulty service in near future.

Zomato should provide negative rating option. I visited the outlet with huge expectation 'cause this is none other than H√§agen-Dazs. After checking out menu on zomato I had two ice cream platters on my mind. One is Eiffel Tower and other is Chocolate Tasting Journey . But we were informed due to some problem which we failed to understand those were not available and we have to take scoops. So we had to go for scoops of 2 different flavours but to our great surprise that person didn't come to our table to take order , so I had to walk up to the counter and place it and I couldn't see any topping display so ordered without any topping. The staffs seems totally clueless about everything. But this is not the end. Just after our order were served we saw the same staff was serving Eiffel Tower the table next to us. When we called and asked him why he said it's not available, he was trying to make lame excuse "strawberry is not available, that's why dish is incomplete". He could have explained the same thing to us instead of saying the whole thing was not available. What a great experience I must say. Will never visit again for sure.

This place is in Paddapukur and it's difficult to find a table there as it's always packed, especially on weekends. We went there on a Sunday. Most of the things on the menu were unavailable. We ordered the Classic Fondue which came with four flavours of ice cream, fruits, brownies, nuts, etc. The chocolate sauce was out of the world and had a very a rich flavour. Even though we loved the sauce, we could not finish it ( maybe the management could reduce its quantity in order to avoid wastage). The Fondue was overall very good. The price after taxes came upto 2,050. For the price I feel that they should give larger scoops of ice creams and add more brownies, cookies or marshmallows instead of the nuts and cream.

I am an icecream fanatic and I was thrilled when I got to know that Haagen Dazs was coming to town. Haagen Dazs has always been so popular for it's delicious icecreams. But this lounge offers so much more from pancakes, waffles, fondue to delicious shakes and coffee. 
My personal favourites are the Eiffel Tower and the Chocolate Fondue. It's always a pleasure to visit Haagen Dazs where I am always spoilt for choice. It's a must must must visit ! So much in love with it üç®

Haagen Dazs, the name synonymous with the one of the best ice cream brand in the world. And if it comes to Kolkata, it's a huge thing. The only good part about this place is the ambience and ice cream, else everything falls apart. The service is very slow and place is very mismanaged. No proper measure of crowd control here. Can definitely improve a lot.

Finally a Haagen- Dazs outlet opened in Kolkata,  much awaited by the ice cream enthusiasts looking to avail this brand of ice cream. The ice creams are excellent but the outlet is a big let down. When you pay so much then you expect a great ambience, here it's too ordinary. Moreover very noisy and the staff are absolutely Clueless. There are so many of them just crowding around the counter and adding to the already chaotic atmosphere.The Eiffel Tower is one of their signature items, and it looks picture perfect. Tasted amazing too, but first they told us it wasn't available but when we expressed disappointment, they said they'd try but without the strawberry!! In place of strawberry they said they'll give a grape! 
The Belgium Choc was great as was the raspberry sorbet. But when I am having to pay such an exorbitant amount for ice cream I also expect to have it in a luxe surrounding. Here the parlour doesn't live up to the brand name.üòè

My experience here wasn't that great, I ordered for a seventh heaven. First the person took a wrong order and gave me wrong scoops. Second, the fruits shown in the images wasn't served, on questioning they said it's written at the bottom that seasonal fruits are served. If it is so the waited while taking order should tell the same, moreover if mango isn't this seasons fruit then I don't know which season it comes. Also the seasonal thing was written in miniscule. Ice creams were good, experience wasn't good for 1100 bucks it wasn't something which went well.

There is a certain brand value of Haagen Dazs that has been killed at this outlet. First of all if I wanted loud music with abnoxious waiters and waiting outside in the heat, I would go to a night club. The music was so loud that the waiters themselves couldn't hear each other. 
I've traveled little bit in the world and I've always made it a point to go to Haagen Dazs because of the value but this is the worst in the world I've been to. Like worst. 
If you want pricy ice cream with bad service and standing outside in the heat for 20 minutes before getting a scoop of ice cream with pathetic d√©cor and ambiance of a shady place, that kills your idea of a Haagen Dazs, then give this place a try but still if you take my advice, don't.

H√§agen Dazs is an Icecream üç¶ brand established in New York in the year 1961,which has now finally opened in Kolkata at Paddapukur Road.
I happened to pay a visit to try their Ice creams.
The ice cream parlour is for approx 30 people with simple interiors.The lights are really beautiful to look at and managed to get a seat right below them.Now
to my disappointment The Belgian Chocolate was already over,so I tried the other flavours like         Mango Raspberry
Raspberry sorbet
Mango 
Summer berries and 
Strawberry cheesecake.
Mango Raspberry and strawberry cheesecake were really delicious which made me forget about the Belgian chocolate. üòã
Its a bit of a pinch in the pocket as single scoops come for 195 exclusive of taxes.but worth it.
The staffs do make you taste with patience before ordering.

When a brand like Haagen Dazs opens up you expect  a standard, which was missing in this outlet. The icecreams and sundaes are excellent but the service is very poor. The staff look confused and are not sure about the menu. Half the things on the menu wasnt available. Running out of chocolate flavour and waffle cones is something unexpected in an icecream parlour. The Eiffel Tower sundae arrived after a good 30 minute wait but with the wrong icecream flavour. Took 10 minutes to change the icecream but again was served some other flavour. Would visit again once these issues are sorted.

Waiters have no idea about any preparations. I had ordered 'seven heaven' which was suppose to have chocolate sauce as mentioned in the menu. When the dish was served it had no touch of any sauce. On asking the waiter (Himanshu) about it he was clue less and started arguing that this item had no chocolate sauce in it. Later showing him the menu, he kept on insisting that chocolate sauce was not served because I didn't ask for it specifically. later asking for a fresh dish after waiting for 10 minutes I was informed that chocolate sauce was finished in their desert joint. Astonishing isn't it!! Mr. Himsanshu said that how am I suppose to know what is available in the kitchen. So in short customers are expected to interact and place order directly with the kitchen chefs for the latest availability. Good Luck. May God Save. Also the dish was not presented as mentioned.

Went there recently for the much hyped ice cream parlour. I tried their summer cone which had a combination of strawberry cheesecake and strawberry ice cream which was just average. The place is not that big and the service was slow. I had gone their after dinner and it was crowded. I had to wait for a long time to clear my bill. The waiters couldn't explain the dishes properly. 

Tried their cappuccino which was nothing but froth and it tasted bad. Their vanilla ice cream is not up to the mark which was a shocker to me. But I liked their brownie.

But portion size is extremely poor and also it is grossly overpriced. 
Besides there is no ambience as such. Small little place.

This place is just another name of heaven for dessert lovers. They have amazing collection of ice cream flavours no doubt. All of them are outstanding and yummy. Not only ice cream they have some collection of customised desserts as per your taste. So this is a must go destination.

Who doesn't love ice-cream?

Well well, Haagen Dazs is finally here in our city and we were lucky to have a sneak peak of this parlour at their Launch party!

We were invited by the owner Mr.Shagun Agarwal to taste the ice-creams before it was to open officially!

So, we were there and we enjoyed the ice-creams to the fullest!

The interiors are done simply yet looks really colouful and sophisticated. The place was filled with all family people and sweet kids, all of them longing for the yummy ice-creams.

Coming over to what we had there :-

Summer Berries & Cream- As the name suggests, it was oozing with the flavours of fresh berries and was melting in our mouth. We personally loved this as is was really refreshing and the cream was very light, leaving just the flavours of berries on our palettes.

Strawberry Cheesecake- Oh Yes, this is an ice-cream and not cake! It had bits of the salted crumb and tasted all of strawberries and cheesecake. A perfect combination of the classic cheesecake and ice-cream.

To conclude with, we loved the ice-cream here and are looking forward to try out more of the flavours and the plated creations. The above review is solely for the flavours we tasted.

The ice cream was absolutely top notch.¬† we had the seventh heaven. Strawberry Cheese Cake, Mango and Raspberry and Coffee scoops where the highlights. I was bit disappointed the outlet didn't have belgian chocolate scoop. The management should look into that

Advise to management - Don't spoil the Brand during initial days itself , your product is the ice cream , and all the other frills which require skills are not even close to international standards . 

I ordered the supposedly Belgian Dark Hot chocolate , and it was no where close to being Belgian , or dark or even Haagen Dazs chocolate flavour , it was more like the Cadbury Chocolate powder added with Milk and sugar . 

If am spending 512 bucks on a Beverage , it better be everything it's promised for , else do not serve it . Not going there again , Local craft Brands will do more justice .

Had gone there with my kids. A very good collection of ice cream and deserts. The beat part was the reactions they had on the plate. Beautifully presented and mouth watering. Service was also upto the standard of HD. Within 3no time the place was full with people wanting to try out the flavours and Maro adda.

Visited the place to try out the ¬†brand. Liked the ice cream. but thoroughly disappointed with the service as they kept the ACs off which made the place suffocating. And after requesting the waiters twice, they spoke to the owner (or manager sitting at a corner table) ¬†for permission, who then took out the remote and switched the AC on. ¬†If you have a 30 plus seater place , which was almost half filled at that point, whats the point in keeping ACs off and making the place uncomfortable?¬†

And the waiters took too long to serve what was ordered.

Place seemed interesting. Went with friends with lots of hope after checking the menu which showed 2 ice creams with green dots (at least your friends who don't consume egg can eat) but when we asked at the counter they said every ice cream has egg. Really strange.

The rating is for the ice cream & ice cream only. This is my favourite brand and I have never been happier about any dessert parlour opening up in kolkata. We tried their Seventh Heaven & Paradise which covered most of their variety of flavours alongwith their fruit sorbets. An absolute delight! We ended with scoops of our favourite flavours belgian chocolate, cookies and cream & pralines and cream with crepes & fresh cream.
The last order brings to the fore the probs with the establishment. The waiters are obviously not comfortable yet with the menu. We ordered some flavours and got something else and secondly the crepes were basically not crepes (thick roti like,batter was obviously not right,too much flour) which ruined the combination. They are clueless as to the presentation when you order a la carte with the extra toppings and sides n stuff. They took 30mins to make 2 crepes when we had ordered 3. Service is slow to the point where we wondered if they had forgotten. The menu is very much limited to fruity variations of the same stuff. A big part of the menu was unavailable which was wierd because the ingredients were not something out of this world.
I would hope these are all teething problems and are soon solved. Visiting this place though is a must.

been waiting for haagen dazs for nearly a decade to come to Calcutta.....it was worth the wait......ice cream were delicious.....they have just started the joint ....so the full menu is still not catered......but they promised they will give full menu service asap........but one thing that bothered me was the service....it definitely needs a BIIIIIIIIIGGGGGG improvement....i went in a group of three and asked for crepe,first the waiter told us they are making the batter for the crepe....and when the finished product came it was very bad.......so overall if you are an ice cream freak.....u will love the flavors and the taste......but don't expect the service to be as good....

The boss of all ice creams has stepped into Kolkata. This much awaited iconic ice cream brand has opened its first outlet  in Puddapukur. The place was crowded but luckily could grab a seat. Ordered for my  all time favourite Belgian Chocolate & also Eiffel Tower. Both were awesome but to me Belgian Chocolate would always be the winner.
The staff were courteous enough but the service was a bit slow.

Even with their pricy tag their indulgence and excellent sundae creations just nail it with great taste.

The House of Haagen Dazs menu offers a variety of choices, a combination of tantalizing flavors and authentic ingredients to tender with the most indulgent and ultimate dessert impression.

The shop opened today and by luck or by chace I was there. It was crowded but well maintained. Decor was nice indeed as should be the case any premium ice cream store. Now coming to the point, ice-creams are delicious. I tried them all but when I could not decide I had to settle for Belgian chocolate. It's simply ... I'm out of words. I didn't have the code so I had to purchase mine.

Finally we have an exclusive top end ice cream joint in town. And i guess it was worth the wait to have 1 of the leading ice cream brand in the world to open its doors in kolkata. Visited the place & could only try my favourite Belgian chocolate ice cream. But i could not stop relishing the texture , creaminess , goodness , chocolatey flavour of the ice cream, or should i name it heaven's cream.  Looking forward to try their signature dishes.....especially their fondues. Keep scooping happiness guys !!! Simply loved it !!!
