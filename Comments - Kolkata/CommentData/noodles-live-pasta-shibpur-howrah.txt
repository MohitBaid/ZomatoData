I ate the vegetarian noodles combo which included salad, paneer Manchurian, chilli potato, a mixed veg soup and noodles. The food was really good making me give a rating of 4.5. The 0.5 was cut for the salad. Otherwise the food was really tasty and good.

Amount and quality of food is good at a reasonable price specially which comes in combo.... It has two counter i.e. one for veg and seperate counter for non veg items... We always try non veg counter's Chinese combo pack which includes Veg Friedrice or Hakka noodles  with Chilli chicken (4) and Chicken Manchurian (2 ) as a starter and a soup with salad... The combo meal is more than sufficient for one person and tasty enough. Everyone should try atleast once

This outlet is located in Treat, the food court of Avani Riverside Mall. They have two sections, one for Veg orders and the other for Non-Veg orders. After having read the previous reviews here in Zomato, we decided not to experiment too much and ordered Veg Hakka Noodles from the Veg section and Hot Garlic Chicken which contained eight chicken pieces as side dish from the Non-Veg section. The noodles was quite less in quantity and would only suffice a single person. We didn't find any difference between a conventional Chilli Chicken dish and the Hot Garlic Chicken dish. An unsatisfactory experience which left us with a full stomach in the end.

Located in the food court of Avani mall.
We opted for the chinese veg combo. Rice or noodle combo is available we went for the noodle combo. It consisted of french fries (which were exceptionally good) , Manchurian, some kind of chutney and spicy pickled cabbage salad (which was horrible).
The quantity was good. Tasted good. Service was okayish.
Value for money.

The chinese non-veg combo here provides a good value for money. I tried the chinese rice combo. 
It consisted of a decent portion of Chicken Fried Rice, 2pieces of Drums of Heaven , some soup,  4 pieces of Chili Chicken and some Kimchi. The taste wasn't mind blowing but wasn't bad either.

It is awful to say the least. Served COLD food. Clearly understandable that the chicken Hakka noodles were precooked and served after a lousy attempt of heating it. Probably almost half frozen... More astonishing was the vehement denial of the shop manager of their blunder in COLLOQUIAL Bengali... The store should be immediately closed down. I wish I could rate it lower...

Not satisfied. Had been there once in Avani. The outlet in Rangoli is the one I visit most often though. They definitely need to upgrade their quality! Noodles is served in huge quantity and this is the only thing good about them actually. One plate is more than enough for two! Basically,they've got nothing special in their food.@piyali paitandy

Trird their "rangoli mall" outlet.

Huge items but tasteless.

Local Chowmin are far better than their so called Hakka noodles.

And least interest to talk about garlic chiken.  ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶ú‡¶ò‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶§‡¶Æ‡•§.üò´üò´üò´üò´

Had more horrible experiences here prior to my last visit , on which this review is based . Previously i had couple of below average tasting nonveg  combos from this outlet, but this time i ordered single portions of MIXED FRIED RICE , MIXED NOODLES and HOT GARLIC CHICKEN and they tasted quite good. Quantity is on lesser side though , the food quality was at par with standard chinese serving food joints in this price segment.

Locationn-Avani riverside mall.

This place is divided in two small counters,one serving vegetarian and another serving non vegetarian food.We have been to this place quite a few times and found their food quite good.This place has a live counter and they mainly serve chinese and continental cuisines and the quantity they serve is quite sufficient for two people.But the most unlikely part was their service,it was extremely laggard.They took approximately 25 min to serve us our food.We had-
1:Crispy chilli babycorn
2:Chilli potato
3:Noodles combo

Food-4/5
Service-2.5/5

Located in the food court premise of Avani Riverside Mall. Food quality is not so good. Prices are somewhat steep. Recommended for casual eating out. Please avoid if you are with someone with whom you want to have a nice conversation with, your topic might get diverted to the quality of the food and never may find its way back. :D
Conditionally recommended.

There is not much choice of food in the food court at avani mall comparing with other malls like s.city, mani square, cc2, quest....
After searching every counters, ordered the non veg pasta in mixed sauce from noodles and live pasta. It's neither very good nor very bad. Every thing tastes well when one is hungry.

It is on the top floor of avani riverside mall. Once we ordered one noodles combo and one rice combo (nonveg). Both were horrible. They served a spicy indian mangsher jhol type soup where you can hardly find any chicken and the salad was smelling really bad(probably it was rotten). There was option to choose between chilli chicken and manchurian. We chose manchurian and if that was what they call chicken manchurian, chicken will kill itself.

This is a quintessential food court outlet at Avani Mall. They have a vast variety when it comes to Chinese, also live pasta and a few combo meals. Once I was in a really hurry and starving too; i ordered a combo meal from this shop. The food was okish, but satiated my hunger to the fullest.

The place being a standard food court eatery, there's little to say about the ambience. The food, surprisingly, isn't half as bad as most of the eateries of Avani food court. In fact, despite what the spelling mistakes on the menu or the server's clueless expression might suggest, their food is quite nice. Their Chinese preparations are quite tasty, and surprisingly, their chicken tetrajini (sic) also turned out to be quite delicious! So far, this place has turned out to be the only eatery at the food court which is worth trying.

This is the third food hub which I had visited in this week...It is situated in the food court of  Avani Mall,Howrah...A mini food corner for Chinese lovers...What impressed me is that they have separate counters for veg and non-veg dishes...I liked the food out there and its also pocket friendly...One should really try the Chinese combo..Its filling as well as cheap.....The haka noodles was another thing to be mentioned..It was really yummy!!
To end of...
One can definitely try once if ur out for some shopping fiesta and doesn't  want to spend much on food ......

Noodles and live pasta is the counter where a person can not only get noodles or pasta but certain Chinese items are also available there... We tried the veg rice which was not so bad to taste except the rice quality. One plate is good enough for a person... We also tried their Szechuan chicken which is not so authentic but the taste was good and quantity was also good enough to serve two... The chicken was fresh, soft and juicy... Service was fast.... Overall I will give them 3/5

We have also tried their crispy chilly baby corn on the second time of our visit... I will give it 4/5 because of the freshness of the baby corns coated with a batter and fried crisp to its best... the sauces and spices in which it was tossed taste equally good without making it soggy... As a starter quantity is good to share among 2. Surely it will increase your hunger....

Today I am going to give review on Noodles & Live Pasta(Avani Riverside Mall).
From the name you can understand it is for noodles and pasta,but they also provide variety of soups,starters,main course(fried rice,noodles,pasta-white,red & mixed sauce),side dishes(mushroom,paneer,baby corn ,potato,chicken etc),chop Suey etc.They have two counters i.e. one is for veg,another for non-veg.
They offer combos like soups,chicken lollipop as starter,veggie salad,fried rice or noodles as main course,chili chicken/fish/panner as side dish.
We ordered "noodles" combos and is enough for one person.

Taste & Foods-average
service-self
Atmosphere-food court(all you know)

So recommended!

my review is totally on the basis of the pasta being offered at this store.¬†

We ordered chicken pasta in white sauce. We were served very soon.¬†Hot, tasty penne pasta on a base of white sauce. The preparation was really good. The portions are fine too for one person. The price is reasonable too inspite of being in a food court.¬†

Do try out!
