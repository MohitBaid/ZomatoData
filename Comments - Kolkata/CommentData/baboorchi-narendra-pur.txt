Not a regular visitor over this locality.. But once you get starved, and having with dish limitations (veg on Saturday, lol) this place give me an absolute bliss with paneer butter masala and tandoori roti. 
Have a bit disappointed for not to taste with some non veg dishes, but surely it would be a must come.
Staffs are well mannered.
Ambient is good as well.

Most popular restaurant in sonarpur area with a great ratio of price and quality of food. Perfect quantity. AC and non-AC both available. You must try it for a pocket friendly outing. Allover it is good but they should focus on the decoration and stuff service I must say.

The chicken is hard and too small in size to satisfy any customer. The fried rice was tasteless. It's the worst food I have ever had. Thank you.

Visited this place last week and I've fallen in love with the food quality. We've ordered for chicken reshmi kebab, chicken tandoori, baboorchi special pulao and mutton kasha. All were equally yummilicious!! 
Really loved it immensely. The price is also within affordability. Thumbs up üëçüëçüëç

We decided to give this place a visit on the day our semester got over since it located quite close to our college. It is located opposite to the SD5 Bus Stand and Sonarpur Garia Auto Stand, near the Sonarpur Railway Station. The restaurant has 2 parts, one with AC and the other without. The staff over here is bit impatient and made us wait for about 45 minutes after taking our order and before serving. We were a group of 9 and had Lachcha Paratha which was quite good, Chicken Biriyani which had a quite large leg piece much to our delight, Kulcha and Tandoori Roti. Along with it we had Chicken Moghlai Masala and Chicken Lababdar. The Chicken Lababdar tasted very nice and is a must have if you visit this place.

Woohoo! Good place, awesome food for the tiny pockets. 
From my very childhood i had been there for their special chilly chicken and friend rice. Before few years, they  hav started a upperstair restro and increased food quality with decorations.
AC and NON AC parts are there. Extra 15%charges for AC. It's a folk-loving restro as it's located in d station road and provide pocket friendly foods with great quality.
Kababs, chicken vorta, crispy chicken, murgh masallam must be on ur plate and finish ur dinner with mocktails.

Very nice food at affordable prices. Went with 5 friends. Total bill was 960. GREAT FOOD AND GREAT CUISINE. THEY CHARGE 15-20% EXTRA FOR AC SEATING.
Superb deal for college students looking for a great eating out experience at very low prices.
Great to have a nice sumptuous meal here and then some light strolling on the roads.

This restaurant is located at a very convenient location near Sonarpur railway station and it can be easily found. We visited this place yesterday for having dinner. They had both AC and Non AC sections for dine in. Our order was short. We opted for the main course only. They had both Chinese and North Indian in their menu. We chose North Indian and placed our order.
* Kashmiri Pulao
* Baboorchi chef's special chicken
They took around 15 minutes to serve the food. Kashmiri pulao was great to taste. It had perfect amount of sweetness along with shahi flavors. The Baboorchi special chicken tasted awesome. The gravy was delicious with lots of vegetables like corn, sweet corn, potato, mushroom and bell peppers in it. The quantity was enough for sharing between two people. The prices were also quite easy on pocket.
I have only one suggestion for their dining area. There is lack of light upon the tables and one could hardly see the food they are having. I suggest them to put up proper lighting just over the tables so that one can see their foods while eating.

Today i was at baboorchi wd my frnd roshni.. a decent place jst near to sonarpur station.. we sat in the AC area where they charge 14.05% VAT... where there is no VAT in the non ac area..
Coming to the food i must say it ws an okey experience.. we had chicken tandoori for starters served wd a green chutney.. the chicken ws pretty tender and juicy. For mains we had tandoori roti nd mutton kasha.. the roti ws soft bt flaky nd thin... nd the mutton ws smelly nd the meat ws invisible almost only a succullent amount of fat ws there.. a total disaster... 
Overall a not so pleasant experience.... 

We were charged Rs. 360.(excluding VAT). overall...

Best hotel in sonarpur narendrapur area. Host of lot of food variety and offers a good quality as well. Pricing is also very much affordable and have options of both AC and non AC sitting which is still a rear thing in this part. Personal advice to all, avoid their Biriyani. Rest are foods are of good quality.

Located near sonarpur and close to my college this place serves decent food at cheap rates. The restaurant has two sitting areas, ac and non-ac. Vat charges are extra for the ac area. I have tried their chicken biriyani, chicken dopiaza, garlic nun and tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken is very well prepared and delicious. The garlic nun is amazing as well. The quantity served is sufficient and the food is light.

Baboorchi is a saviour from mess food! I don't know how many times did I go there. The best part of this restaurant is that the pocket pinch is very very low and cheap. For college students like us,we do have budget issues but Baboorchi fits within it perfectly! The food is also great. Each time I go,I try new dishes. They are good.

Although it borrowed a similar sounding name of its more famous cousin, but that does not take away a bit from the taste factor. I had frequented this place for a dozen times now and each time equally satisfied.
- Two things are a match winner for me, quality of food and price I pay for it. Baboorchi does exceptionally well in these
- Ambiance is better than its neighboring restaurants, although it kind of the only standard restaurant in a 100 m radius from Sonarpur station, the prices are kept in check
- I tried everything here, from Muglai to Chinese, all are equally well prepared, tasty and are served in enough quantity
- Final verdict, its at the outskirts but its way better than the restaurants of its genre situated in the city! I'd say, give it a try

Our very own Baburchi shows how you can develop a plain bangla vater hotel or pice hotel to a aam admis restaurant. Thanks Kaltu da to present Sonarpurian a decent very much pocket friendly eating out spot. Hats off for providing delicious machh vat to Chinese n continental to moglai dishes in same spirit in the ac zone its really great. Quality n quantity along with price is Kaltu das keramoti noting much to say just go n enjoy.

It was a good restaurant but not now. Quality dropped done by time. You will see garbages here and there all around the restaurant. For this quality in a place like Sonarpur the menu is extensively over priced. Behavior of the staffs is also not good. As it is a popular restaurant for many years in Sonarpur area they are less bother about the quality and the customer satisfaction.

okay now,If you are looking for good delicious and cheap food this one's the right place for you.One of the oldest restaurants in Garia,Narendrapur and Sonarpur area Which has been filling up the appetite of the local area people.Till a time it was limited to a small place which normally people wouldn't find fancy enough to visit but in the recent years its look has been mended which was its one and only backlog.so people trust me if you are looking for a good place which will suit your low budget.this is the place.and yeah do try the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.I hope u won't be disappointed. cheers!

I have always thought that this restaurant deserves to be found on Zomato & now here it is. 

Thanks to this place me and many of my friends survived our hostel life at narendrapur.We came to know about this restaurant in our 2nd year. The first time we visited we were blown away by their (low cost + delicious food) combination.
Since then we haven't visited the restaurant again but we order for home delivery almost once a week. 

Now lets talk about the food.Among all the things we ate only the chicken chap was a disappointment rest were really good. The Biriyani is quite good in taste and also in quantity. If you are low on budget and still long for Biriyani, you can get their veg Biriyani which is normal Biriyani except the chicken/mutton and egg. The Fried Rice -Chilli Chicken combo is quite decent among the Chinese.But to us their most popular and delicious dish is Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. We order it regularly along with tandoori roti.I personally haven't tasted too many items on their menu, but my friends always talk about many of the items they have a crush on.

Verdict - From Garia to Baruipur this is the most pocket friendly restaurant that provides really tasty food. (eg. Apart from #Asma at Baruipur)

My very first visit and it was surprisingly pleasant experience. . We were a group of six girls, accommodated quite finely. Restaurant has big dine in area both ac and non ac.
FOOD-„Äã we ordered two plates of mixed Fried Rice, one masala kulcha, one paneer kulcha, manchurian chicken, hot and sour chicken, chicken rezala and crispy chilli babycorn. CHICKEN RESALA was the best and paneer kulcha tasted well too. But we didn't like hot and sour chicken. Babycorn was really crispy, finely balanced. Bill came out of 704, pocket friendly.
LOCATION-„ÄãOpposite of sonarpur SD-5 Bus Stand. Beside the medical shop.
My suggestion would be to try their Indian or mughlai dishes rather than Chinese.
