Its a pure veg food hub....they dont even add onions and garlic so its good place from where you can have veg food.Its good for pure vegetarians.
Food tastes also nice .But thing is the place where it is ,is not nice to Hangout or have ur meals their.

Terribly overpriced for the quantity that they serve. The taste is fine but not worth the money they charge, also, location is dingy and not very welcoming, though noticeable

Just an ordinary take away restaurant. Clean place. Serves only veg food.

Food is too pricey. Food is not to up that standard to have that price. 

Reduce your price or else you people will soon be shut down without a doubt.
