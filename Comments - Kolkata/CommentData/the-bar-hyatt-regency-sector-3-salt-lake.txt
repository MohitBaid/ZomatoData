A visit to this posh restrobar was only possible because of its proximity to Salt Lake Stadium(The ongoing Fifa Under 17 World Cup)..we were a group of 3 and we simply soaked in the vibe..from the moment you step in till the moment you leave you are in for a chilled relaxed atmosphere without any hesitation to leave..this place is crowdfree throughout the year as it seems..we had 4 pints of beer alongside gulabi paneer tikka,zafrani murgh tikka and cheese pepperoni thin crust pizza..the paneer tikka was simply outstanding and the best of the lot..it had soft stuffed succulent fillings inside which melted in my mouth..heaven!..the murgh tikka was also good but not like the paneer preparation..the thincrust pizza was again spot on with adequate slices for all..this being a star property there is no compromise on quality and quantity..u can spend hours here without any intrusion and enjoy ur time with your pals thoroughly..pricing as expected on the top tier..

A great bar to hang out. The bar is quiet, which is a plus, it has nice chairs along with sofa. a great place to chill after a hard days work. The service is very prompt, just wish they keep the place open after 11.30.

Soothing refreshing and peaceful that's why you prefer a 5star hotel..You can watch your match hang out with friends or close your business deals..Service and sheer ambience makes it totally outstanding...Not so much expensive as 5stars used to be.. Keep up the good work!!

I visited this place recently..
I was here with a deal from Nearbuy.
Nothing to say about the ambience.
Very soothing and peaceful.
The class of a 5 star rated Hotel.
We had Staters and Beer.
We tried one fish an paneer.
Both were very delicious..
And, the beer was also of very good quality..
Lovely romantic place.

Ambience thumbs up, service was upto the mark! I loved my cocktails and my friends beer was served cold. We called for a chicken tonga, it was good enough and a spring roll which was disastrous, tad oily with a bad smelling filling. Being a part of hyatt, the should take care of what they serve.

This has to be one of the most favorite watering hole of mine. Understated elegance is the forte at this outlet. Great place to unwind after a rough day. It is done up in elegant tones that exude warmth and comfort. The list of wines is fantastic and the list of cocktails is fabulous.

one word, "AMBIANCE". Its beautiful and soothing. Food is good. The chicken kebabs really do tease your taste buds and leave you craving for more. Expected a little more out of the veg starters. Had a gin and tonic. waiters were friendly and never in a hurry, one can relax and chat without any worry to hurry..

This is the place to go and unwind after a long day or maybe start your afternoon with a beer and a snack. The boys behind the bar are outstanding guys and solid bartenders. I've been staying at the Hyatt for 8 months now and they never had Campari my favorite aperitif and the boys went out and got it for me recently. That's pretty cool and very touching. Food and snacks are good and again the service is hands down the best for a small little bar in a very nice big hotel. Cheers boys thanks for making my stay in Kolkata special.

This is a wonderful place to enjoy. Very comfortable seating and a wonderful smell of tandoor in the air.  The waiters and bartenders are never in a hurry, they shall interact with you till they have answered all your queries. Personally speaking it was a wonderful experience.

This is one of the best bars in Salt Lake. The service is brilliant. The alcohol collection is to die for. The food is delicious. The ambience is relaxed. Must visit.

Visited this Place last Sunday with a friend meeting him after ages. Wanted some good ambience so chose to sit for few drinks over here. Very few tables occupied , Very less Noise which I preferred that time. But they should play some Soothing music according to the ambience and the location. Otherwise it gets un-happening. We called for the drinks and few starters in paneer and chicken. Both were equally good and the bartender / waiter was good at service , trying to fulfil our requirements. Though the service was very slow as there were only 2 people serving the entire resto. Even the waiter apologised for a delayed service which was a nice gesture. Overall a very nice experience. I had been to other Hyatt is different cities , even the kolkata one was decent enough. Just that they need to play some soft music and be a little fast in service.

Amongst the better bars to goto in the city and definitely in the salt lake area. Good decor and drinks, decent finger food and service. Indeed if anything it's the best F&B outlet at the Hyatt with the other places rather average.

We had Groupon vouchers and with two of my colleagues visited The Bar with lots of excitement in mind. On entering we realized we were the only ones in the bar. The ambiance was mediocre to a 5 star standard. Light was low with candle on table center creating mood lighting for a bar.
Beers were served chilled. However, the food was so so pathetic that pissed us off like anything. - Bengali Fried Fish with Kasundi: Had no traces of Kasundi and fish was not fresh. Too salty and oil dripping from it. On complaining they tries to give us another fresh dish but improved marginally. 
- Chicken 65: Taste was ok but was cold.
- Dahi Ke Kebab: Taste was flat and doesn't goes with drinks at all.
- Aloo Kurkure Chat: This was the only one I liked taste wise but as the name suggested it was not crispy at all.

On complaining about the above points to the server they were looking bluntly at our face. Such food quality and service was not at all expected from a 5 star establishment. Being their gold passport member and frequent Hyatt visitor this was my worst experience with them.
Giving 1 point each for chilled beer and mood lighting.

It's perfect. It's aristocratic.  The place is amazement itself, with the tinge of all you can possibly ask or think of. I am addicted and like the roots of shoots embedded I  the soul of the place.

The Bar at the Hyatt Regency is a nice place to have a drink before dinner .... its got a quiet elegance about it that makes it great to unwind after a hectic day and put you in the mood for dinner. Needless to say the bar is well stocked and has a good variety of cocktails .... am not much of a drinker but I have it on good authority that they mix a mean Long Island Iced Tea (L.I.T.).
M y barometer is but naturally the food and that is pretty good here. The kebabs etc are all pretty good but my favorites are the Crispy Baguette's topped with Ham and Brie , the Fried Sea Food Platter which is delicious and the Chicken Spring Rolls.
