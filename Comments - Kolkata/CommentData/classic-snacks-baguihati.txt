One of the oldest and happening eatery in baguiati area.have tried almost every item on the menu and felt chow is good rest all the gravy seems same.range of food is wide and the shop is crowded mostly in evening.morning u get kachori and sabji which is also good.avoid sit and eat as the inside seems suffocating.

One of the oldest and busiest food corner at Baguiati area. They are the first restaurant where I tasted biriyani in my childhood. They have a large menu contains biriyani, chowmin, ruti, chole, mutton, chap etc etc. You can always find some people outside the restaurant for rumali ruti and sabzis. Recently they have introduced momo corner which I have to try.

Kolkata is a place where rolls, cutlets and kabiraji is famous for. I am almost a regular customer of "classic snacks". The best part is whenever you have it you will not feel any problem with digestion. The people out here are super fast roti makers. The best thing you can try is a fish fry and bengalis without fish, ha ha ha rare to find. The noodles is also good. If i ever ask for roll with onion they put fry onion which tastes good. The sauce and the oil they put is good. I always ask my friends, relatives and my acquaintance to try any kind of fast food from here.

Located in the famous for its fast food takeaways, baguiati bazar. The place is very pocket friendly and the food is excellent. The fish fry, egg roll. Rumali roti and egg tarka are really worth mentioning.
