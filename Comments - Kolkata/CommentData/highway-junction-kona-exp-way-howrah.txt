the place is just beside the national highway so this is apt for long way going people.There has a plenty place of parking so it would not be any problem for both of the four wheeler and two wheeler folks.Now comming to the interior, it is very simple but decent and clean.the staffs are courteous and friendly. Then the main thing comes,the food is really satisfying.They give a decent quantity and the price is not so high.the taste is unquestionable and foods are freash.But every iteam is not available everyday like biriyani.They told that they serve it only on occasion. Moreover,if you are travelling long or planning to go for a road trip then give it a trySneham Basak
