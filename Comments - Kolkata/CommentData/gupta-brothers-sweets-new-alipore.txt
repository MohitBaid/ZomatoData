Fly found inside gur ka rosogolla. Ordered through Swiggy. Gupta brothers, new alipore has been very over confident with its customer base and has compromised with quality and hygene. I puked seeing it. FSSAI - what are you guys doing? I felt embarassed infront of my guests.
Check out pictures to see a fly inside gur rosogolla on 9.1.2018

Another branch of Gupta brothers chain in new alipore. Okay place to meet a sudden hunger. Though it's Gupta brothers sweets but snacks are also available. Price is cheap. Foid is okayish. Sweets are  good.

This is not only a sweets shop, but a veg restaurant as well. Most of us only know this as a sweet shop but it's something more. The sweets are amazing and mouth watering. There's no doubt about that. Apart from the sweets, you must also try the dishes under the 'Snacks' collection. They are just amazing.

One of the most authentic sweet shops in Kolkata which serves sweets and veg food at cheap rates even now .The Gulab Jamun is to die for at 10 bucks and even the Amriti which is served hot outside the outlet.The restaurant also has a seating space beside it's main outlet where you can sit and have it's food.The Veg Manchurian and Noodles are quite good and affordably priced.

On rain soaked Nabami as I was taking in the pujo atmosphere in an around New Alipore children's park area, found a small toe hold at Gupta Brothers in the crowed.As the seating area was jam packed with my self at the tail end of the que, decided to take a parcel of the Special Meal Thali and enjoy it at home.
The packing was top notch with out any chance of spillage
The Special Meal had Basmati Rice, a very tasty Kulcha with appropriate quantity‚Äã of stuffing inside it and was soft .
Paneer Tikka was ordinary to taste as the marinade was tasting of mild khara masala but the paneer was of top notch quality with a fabulous creamy texture and vanilla flavour.
Kali Dal with a topping of cream was satisfactory to taste.
The Paneer butter masala was absolutely disappointing to taste, as the gravy tasted more the Sambal paste rather that anything to do with tomato.
Mixed veg sabzi was fabulous to taste and was the best gravy preparation of all.It was slightly sweet in taste and accompanied well with the Kulcha.
Pickle and salad was there to increase the number of items and to give it a grand feeling and a visual illusion.
The real great tasting dish in all of this special Thali was the dahi Vara.The Vara had absorbed in the spices with the curd and was very soft and moist and just tasted heavenly.
The meal ended with a sweet in the form of a Gulab Jamun.
Priced at Rs 197/- plus taxes, the meal with its variety and less than exehelarated taste to many of the preparations was noting Special .

I didnt know Swiggy delivers from this joint to my place, so was elated to discover that and immediately placed order for the following

Kesari Rabri - Just loved this flavour of Rabri and I am going to reorder for sure.
Misti Dahi - The dahi was also good.

This sweet shop is situated in my locality. Theirs mithai, sweets, cakes & all savoury items are good in taste. The place is clean, maintains hygiene. But the problem is you can't see the price tag on the items and so that they tell different price at different times. I asked the price for baked doi they said 30 but one week after I again visited there for baked doi and that was 35 or 38 they said. I think they should use price tag for each n every item. 4 points for their quality of every mouth melting items, ambience and cleanliness which are very important too.

The New Alipore area close to Taratala is a sweet lovers paradise with Bikaner Bhujiwala on one end and Tewari Brothers, Ballaram Mullick and Gupta Brothers on the other as you cross the Petrol Pump. In this tug of sweet war, Gupta Brother Sweets stands as a worthy winner in terms of excellent quality, unmatched flavors and abundance of variety. Strategically located opposite the Triangular Park, it's very easy to spot the shop with its huge signboard and decorative entrance. The ground floor is dedicated to both sweets and savories while the first floor which used to be a fully functioning restaurant until a few years back has been renovated to a vegetarian food court serving snacks and meals. ¬†

There is a plethora of items to choose from, I have reviewed only a handful that I have tasted over the years:

=================================
SWEETS üòªüòªüòªüòª
=================================

‚èπMoti Pak Barfi - Moti Pak is a delicious sweet barfi made with besan and sugar. It tastes more like laddu but since it has got khoya in it which makes it rich and tastes amazing. This is one of my favorite sweets and can have them every single day!

‚èπPlain Abar Khabo - "Abar Khabo" literally means "will eat once more" in Bengali, can be counted among the must try items here at Gupta's. This melt-in-the-mouth dessert is made by mixing fresh cottage cheese, sugar, saffron threads, khoya (thickened milk) and topped with pistachios is sure to leave a person yearning for more and hence totally justifies it's name.

‚èπKaju Barfi - If I were to rank the best, it comes a close second to Tewari's but nonetheless rich and delish.

‚èπKaju Pista Roll - If you're fond of Kaju Barfis I can bet you will love the Kaju Pista rolls. You'll relish every single bite of a luscious concoction of cashew and pistachios, flavored with a subtle hint of cardamom. ¬†

‚èπDilkhushar Barfi - This barfi is traditionally made with coarsely ground besan, ghee, khoya and cardamom powder. Has a slight chewy texture, the ghee and cardamom scent not overpowering, the sweetness just right makes it absolutely marvellous.

‚èπMilk Cake - Grainy and sweet, this milk fudge is something to die for. The slight caramelization gives it a light brown colour and slightly fudgy texture.

‚èπDry Gulab Jamun - I usually purchase the dry gulab jamuns and they last for about a week or so when stored in a cool and dry place. Always fresh and yummy!

‚èπMishti Doi (Sweet Curd) - Wouldn't rate this as the best but the thing I like about the doi is it has just the right sweetness and a natural caramel color.

‚èπRabri - The plain and kesariya rabris are usually what I go for. The thickened sweetened milk with layers of malai and flavored with cardamoms, saffron is absolutely mouthwatering!

================================
SNACKS & MEALS¬†üòªüò∫üòªüò∫
================================

‚èπBhakarwadi - Bhakadwadi is one of my favorite snacks is prepared by mixing besan and flour and topped with a mixture of spices, which is later rolled and cut into spiral shapes and deep fried. The Bhakadwadis they make are usually smaller in size than regular ones I have had in Pune. Taste wise sweet and spicy, they make for great tea time snacks.

‚èπKhandvi - Khandvis are the soft melt-in-the-mouth gram flour and yoghurt pinwheel rolls with a delicious tempering of mustard seeds n green chillies.

‚èπDhokla (Plain & Idly Dhokla) - The dhoklas are soft and fluffy, garnished with shredded coconut, chopped coriander leaves and tempered mustard seeds n green chillies. Served with a sweet tamarind chutney tastes delicious.

‚èπSamosa (Aloo and Matar) - They usually run out of stock by 6-6:30 in the evening. Filling is not so spicy yet very tasty.

‚èπIdly-Sambar - I have ordered Idlys on a couple of occassions for my nephew. Always white, fluffy and soft with a nice sambar and coconut chutney to go along.

‚èπThali Gharwali - Comes with Dum aloo, Paneer butter masala, Dal makhni, Tawa Kulcha, Rice, Dahi Vada, Gulab Jamun, salad, Papad and Pickle. This is a lot of food so order if you're really hungry. The Dum aloo and kadhai paneer they make is a bit on the spicier side. So I usually prefer a Dal Makhni or Paneer butter masala or even a Paneer Tikka alongside rice/breads.

These days I mostly order through Swiggy. Otherwise, the staff manning the place are very efficient and quick with their service. While it can sometimes be a struggle to catch their attention but this aspect can be sidelined considering the sheer size of the crowd they pull in even on normal days. Prices of sweets vary depending on ingredients they use. While some are reasonably priced, dry fruits, nuts and ghee based sweets are priced on the higher end. I have been a customer for quite a few years now and have only seen them rise from being 'good' to being the 'BEST' in the city!!!¬†üëçüëç

PS: Although the live counter outside the shop that dishes out jalebis, imartis, pav bhajis etc looks inviting but installing it just by the polluted roadside is a big NO for me.

Located near New Alipore Triangular park,this place gives a proper judgement to its attire,by elite-class confectionary and mini meals.
Special to mention,ABARKHABO SANDESH,it may have taken a while to get to my mouth,but I ve found d best patella on d planet.Rosomalai,chamcham too r ready to satisfy tastebuds.
Next to sweets,I ve tasted IDLY DHOKLA n PANEER KEBAB,served along with tomato n coriander chutney is really mouthsmacking,served in a well decor-dish,ll give u a both soft n crunchy taste.
The shop is both clean n tidy -despite having limited space n most customers that can fit inside at once,all d staff members there greeted my companions n me with smiles as warm as d pies they serve there.
I would thoroughly recommend Gupta brothers to anyone with a sweet tooth.I know Ill certainly be returning soon.

My friend and I were done with the work near Taratala so we decided to go there and have something. And I would never regret this decision. Both of us being from North India, this place seemed like a oasis in a big desert. That trademark North Indian style mashed aloo samosa was near perfect and it was the thing I was looking for in my recent stay in Kolkata. As much the food here was tasty, it was equally fresh and I liked that the most. It is going to be my weekly destination from now on. 
Apart from food, the ambience is nice, all that snack and sweets will make you hungry there itself.
But it seemed that the staff was not that friendly, I got  scolded for telling them to switch my mango rabri to kesar rabri. 
And I think having a parcel out of there to our doors will always remain a good option. 
But anyways, nice experience.

I have been visiting gupta brothers for so long but this happened me for the first time.
As per my knowledge there should be no packing charges when you are buying sweets unless I am asking for some extra additional packing.
I had a bulk order to make in different sets.
This was so unexpected of gupta brothers.
I cancelled the order and went to tewari brothers instead.
By this review I just want to make the owners aware about what their staffs are doing and losing customers.

My friend took me there to give me a treat. At first I thought it will be just like any other mithai shop of Kolkata. But when I reached the Abarkhabo Shoppe I was overwhelmed to see so many varieties of sweets and snacks displayed in the shelves. There were different types of ¬†laddoos, Gur mishtis and lots of different types of badam sweets to choose from. ¬†The ambiance was awesome! And food was delicious! I have become a fan of Gupta Brothers ¬†now. No doubt it is a great place for enjoying a quick meal of snacks and sweets.

I love the sweets since I have a sweet tooth.But the down part is some sweets are over priced specially the ones in mud containers,rasmalai and pudding type ones.If you like veg then the variety of snacks available would simply confuse you.Whenever I visit this place I fill up my stomach with a variety of stuffs in little amount rather than digging into a single type.You can try their thali at the food joint.This place is better than haldirams and related places.I just wish the prices were a little lower.It's not a place for the mass.

This place has some of the best varieties of sweets. From gulab jamun to different kind of sandesh everything  is of superb quality. However they even have a small vegetarian restaurant above. Half the  items arent available most of the times and food quality is not good too. The quantity served is also insufficient.  So good place for sweets but not for others.

The rating is for the food joint on the first floor and not for the sweets shop. So me and my parents decided to go out for a meal, and the place served the most horrendous curries and a watery dal, served cold and brimming with oil,not to mention the fact that the breads were equally pathetic.

My suggestion would be if you are not serious about the food joint , might as well just focus on the sweets division rather than serving substandard food to customers. This is the not the first time this was experienced but i refrained myself from writing thinking it might be a one off thing but hats off to the consistency. I would not recommend eating here to anyone.

Yup, there is a life beyond¬†Rosogolla¬†and Mishti Doi.And this is the ultimate junction if you're a fan of sweets. Located on the main road to Triangular park(from New Alipur to Taratala) this restaurant serves you veg dishes only and a plethora of sweets. You will find hell lot of amazing variety of sweets starting from ghee laddu, potol mishti, malpoa, son halwa, and what not. I would strongly recommend you, people, to drop in once and taste each of them.¬†On Ashtami afternoon(Durga Puja'16) I went to the restaurant and ordered 3 Special Thali for 3 of us in our family. One thali serves 1.25 people and hence we were almost at foodpoint¬†(instead of gunpoint :P ). ¬†The dal makhani is the best among the dishes but what really blows my mind off is the hot and succulent Gulab Jamun. Mmmmm.......¬†When it comes to the delivery time there is room for improvement as they are not committed to the clock.¬†Anyway the quality of the food and the satisfaction that you enjoy perfectly justifies the price on the menu. Thumbs Up, Cheers!

First thing that I should mention about this amazing sweet shop is that it has an very nice ambience to sit and enjoy while having one's meals. Food is awesome. There are a variety of sweets and snacks and veg meals to choose from. Particular mentions goes for the veg thalis and the seasonal mishtis that are available here.

Once I have been to this place and tried their thali, it was really very good in taste and was upto the mark. One thali is suffiecient for one hungry soul but I couldn't finish as it was more than enough for me.
Price is also reasonable and pocket friendly. 
Sitting area is available and can accomodate 20-25 people. 
One should go and try their thali its best. Did not get chance to try sweet items will look forward to that.

Good plaxe for sweets but the price is tooo steep.

A normal sweet will start at rs 20 

Anything fancy will reach upto 30 or 35.

The price and taste ratio isn't so inspiring.

A very neat and clean sweet shop in new alipore. It is close to triangular park ( near steam and fried).
They serve a variety of sandesh and laddoos along with other sweets. Snack items are good too here.
Best part is that they have live jalebi counter in winters outside the outlet.

Have tried jalebi, laddoo, moti Pak, mango sandesh and samosa inmy 2-3 visits.
The prices are good and sweets are always fresh.
Only set back is that the outlet is always overcrowded. There is also a seating area on the level above. Though have not been there.

Overall, one of the best places for sweets in NewAlipore.

Hey there! Gupta brothers is a very good place. Most probably the only place that strikes our mind when fast food or sweets are concerned. The service is excellent. There's a seating area as well. Staffs are well mannered and cooperative. Also, gulab patti sandesh, strawberry rosgulla, raj bhog and yes how can we leave behind the vada pav? These stuffs are a must try. These are my personal favourite. Do write your thoughts/reviews/comments about the above mentioned sweets. And also let me know if something else is worth trying apart from what i've had.

And i was expecting so much from this place but it was disappointing. Tried everythingthey had. The rasogullas were the worst ive had in the city. I am not sure if it was a bad chef day or what but the sweets were really disappointing. Had chamcham and that was the only saviour out of all the 10 sweets i tasted.

I have been a GB loyalist for 8 years now. I started using GB when kachori sabzi was for Rs12 per plate. So it's been quite a journey. The good thing about this place is that they have ensured to maintain the quality throughout. Do try the club kachori sabzi for morning breakfast which is a GB speciality. Also gulab sandesh is another offering which should not be missed.

Ordered Radhaballavi Aloo Dum through Swiggy. Pinched my pocket slightly, with 30 bucks per plate of 2 pieces of Radhaballavi and 4 small pieces of Aloo Dum, plus the packing charges. The Radhaballavi was nice n soft. Aloo Dum was spiced, and I didn't particularly like the tangy taste of it.

The shop is located right at New Alipore, Triangular Park. Air-conditioned seating available on first level. Huge varieties of sweets in stock. Prices are on the higher side, which is quite understandable for a big brand that they are.

Situated specifically in front of the Triangular park ( Birsa Munda park) Gupta Brothers should be basically called a vegetarian eatery rather than a monotonous confectionery just like Haldiram's.
Comprising of a two-storeyed building, the ground floor has all those fancy looking overpriced bonbons as well as other regular sweets. Being a sweet tooth I keep on visiting this place frequently, so some of my favourites be,
‚Ä¢ Gulab Jamun - the quintessential sweet for every sweet tooth person, and yes they make it in the best possible form.
‚Ä¢ Laddu - the next best thing in this shop and yes they are masters in that.
‚Ä¢ Gajar ka Halwa - definite try.
‚Ä¢ Jalebi - with oozing ghee, and perfect concoction of misti rosh the first bite of jalebi is such a Wow!
‚Ä¢ Kaju Barfi - one of the grand items here, with ample amount of kaju paste in it.

Apart from that dry sweets are much recommended...the fancy looking ones are quite pricey and yes they taste amazingly wow. Mainly we prefer to gift those ones in festive or celebrations rather than eating those.
.
Oh yes, I forgot to mention about other veg delicacies like Dhoklas, Kachuris...these are like the must have things here.
.
Overall, Highly Recommended! üëë

I have had a sweet tooth for as long as I can remover, and this sweet shop located just opposite to Triangular Park used to be my favourite haunt. The service is excellent, fast and prompt. Known for their brilliant Abarkhabo, Gupta Brothers boasts of an unending array of Bengali and Marwari sweets along with a variety of snacks ranging from paapri chat ( my personal favourite ), dahi vadas, dhoklas, khandvi, a range of samosas, alu tikki et cetera. Their aam rabri continues to be my favourite Mishti ever, and their badam sandesh could definitely carve a niche for itself. Rosogollas, the Bengali staple, come in varieties of shapes, but the flavour remains cherishable. Gupta Brothers. Is undoubtedly right up there on my list of sweet shops.

Ordered Dahi vada, Chole masala and Naan and Rajkachodi chat on the 1st day...packaging was good. Quantity was ok for the price...!
Now coming to the food....their dahi vadas are my favourite...perfectly soft...dahi is a little too sweet but I like it. They don't serve any sev along with it though.
But the Rajkachodi chat was too sweet...lacked the chat flavour. Also I guess a chat tastes best when had fresh and not soggy.
The naan was usual...chole masala was good. No issues.
Next time I ordered again for the Dahi vada and Mixed onion uttapam. 
The uttapam was good enough and I jugde my south Indian food by  the coconut chutney they provide and here in Gupta Brothers I love their coocnut chutney. A The sambar is good as well.
Overall I'm a Gupta Brothers fan.

My bestie took me there for the first time! After having lunch at her house we decided to  go upon by some snacks! So Gupta brothers was the best place! Though they had full meal course, the snacks were no less delicious! We had two dohi boras and their cold coffee! Both were miraculously tasty and Widin our budget too! Want to grab a bite at an effective cost? Gupta brothers is the best place for this!

Gupta Brothers, our age old, treasured sweet shop has evolved over the decades and transitioned to become our everyday popular eatery. Who does not know about the Gupta Brothers and their famous pair of idlis? Or their always on demand sweets?

This Gupta Brothers joint is located on the lane of New Alipore- near Honda show room. Autos from Taratala would drop you right in front of the shop.

Gupta Brothers, New Alipore is a two storey building with sitting area for decent number of people. Beside their excellent South Indian food items, they also happen to serve continental cuisine. 

*Idli: The idli here are highly recommended. White, light and everything nice. These words would not be enough to describe the taste of these little pieces of delights. Having minimal but notice worthy tang to the fluffy pieces of idlis, it definitely upscales Gupta Brothers and sets it apart from the rest of the New Alipore competitions.

They have a wide range of choices.. very cheaply priced and also very tasty... But now I feel people avoid going there simply because the staff is EXTREMELY RUDE.. They do not answer to u at once... will walk off saying other person will deal ... thr is no supervisor or manager.. even when u complain they do not care... .. this has happened to me atleast a couple of times and even the customers present thr were complaining of this.. The owner should definitely look into this..  they do not have display heads for the items placed on the shelf .It becomes difficult for the customer as the staff does not respond....

Located opposite to Triangular Park, this place is a heaven for early morning breakfast lovers. A bit far away from my house, have dropped here only once. Tried the Club Kachori with Gulab Jamuns. The Sabji was tasty and paired well with the sweet tooth combination of Gulab Jamun. This place is huge and maintains good hygiene and fresh stock of products. Popular among the locals, try this place if you are around.

Gupta brothers have always ¬†impressed me with their quality of sweets and well behaved staffs.
I have been to their other outlets and had equally well behaved staffs.

##Location:
Very near to the Triangular Park at New Alipur.

##Experience:
Kaju Barfi, and Gulan Jamuns are my favorite here. Also their Pau bhaji and Kachoris are pure bliss.
They have various sweet items in their offerings too which has been prepared with quality raw materials too and that can be ¬†understood from the taste as well. Prices are on the higher side but they justifies it all with the kind of products have been served.

I am a regular here & this place is a sellout! Whether it‚Äôs the vada pao or the club kachori or the jalebi, you have to be quick otherwise the stock will run out! The place has been running successfully since its inception & the owners keep bringing up innovative dishes to keep up that wow factor. Fresh food, decent pricing, quick service, good location, you name it. A pure veg delight this! A must try will be the vada pao, raj kachouri & choco sandesh with choco syrup filling.

I have visited this place a couple of times and my review is based on all the visits which I have done.¬†

I think you cannot ignore this place in the Triangular park and most likely you are going to step in for some good snacks.¬†

I am a hardcore Non-veg so and a big fan of sizzlers, so when I opened the menu and saw the sizzlers section trust me I felt sad really sad, but anyways this is not the place to have sizzlers. Its a say when in Rome, do what the Romans do.¬†

Hence ordered, kachauri, samosa and Gulab jamun my favorite. Taste great, specially the Gulab jamun.¬†

Be there if you want to have some good snacks and some sweets, but remember one thing, the pocket pinch is very high and don't burn your fingers :-)

Located opposite new alipore triangular park, this outlet is pretty huge and strategically located. Their sweets are famous throughout kolkata. What i really liked was their veg thali which i have ordered for home delivery quite a number of times. It gives a home cooked food taste and is priced reasonably. 
I personally dont like food cooked in the open just near the running traffic so i dont like the paw bhaji stall just outside the outlet.

I specefically love their Vegetarian Thali which is not only filling but also is value for money .  
Their ' Chatpata Chat ' section also serves as a boon to chat lovers ! 

I never tried their Chinese counterpart , so not much idea .

Although I'm not a veg lover I must admit this place is different. The restaurant is located near the triangular park. One cannot miss the smell of ghee and the sight of garam jalebees and bada pavs outside it. They have a ample space to built a very good restaurant. The ground floor is the sweet shop and the first floor is the restaurant. The food is good in there and also healthy. People like me who are exclusively non vegans may get confused there what to order, in that case order the thali and it will be more than enough.

When you are going low on budget, yet your tummy is rumbling for something really good, trust me this is the right place to go. Despite being a meat lover this place has won my heart in one first shot and I have ended up here time and again over and over. Order the cheese onion masala dosa and then we are talking. We took kulcha with jalfrezi. Blimey thats one of the best veg I have ever had. However I couldn't appreciate kanjivada- maybe its not my kind of food but where is the harm in a bit of experimentation. 
A big thumbs up to this budget friendly food joint providing a wide array of delicacies. You won't be disappointed.

Opposite to Triangular Park, Gupta Brothers is really at a very posh area. Be it any occasion, festival or daily night sweets, one shop my family resorts to is Gupta Brothers. The high quality taste they deliver is incomparable. The sweets are incredible. The rasmalai..rabri..chocolate sweets..barfi..amriti..laddus and what not... lip smacking man!!! Though i had never dined in the restaurant located in the 1st floor but had taken away the food a number of times. The meal they offer, both quality and quantity is great. Only thing is for the noodles and sandwiches it may seem bit more spicy to some. But sweet lovers and vegetarians u must hit this place soon. Though Gupta Brothers is so well placed that i dont think it needs any of the advertisements. Ting :)

Its not the typical Bengali sweetshop . .as it has been taken to a whole new level with the location,decor,ambience and their efficient service.
Located just opposite to triangular park ,you cannot miss it . Its quite big a space and sparkling clean.
The ground floor is for sweets and savoury snacks like dhokla,vada pav ,mini burgers etc. which is really great . .to diversify that is.
The first floor which has a side entrance serves meals,combos from kachori . .which is not really good. .to naan,paneer kebabs( lovely!!) . .right to pastas made fresh on the counter( u get to see it). It has a big enough seating area with a one glass side providing a view of the road.
The prices are very reasonable and the food is great for something purely vegetarian.
Now coming to the thalis . .I think they are a must try.
We had the special thali ( Rs 190+tax) and I thought its too much . .but only till they served the food. It had a salad,dahi vada,two pieces of paneer kebab,pulao,a stuffed kulcha(really big and very filling by itself),a dal,a veggie and a paneer( they ask about your choice) ,gulab jamun and a papad . .and its very filling for even two people.
Another thing I love is the way they pack your thali if you want to take it home . .they seal it in an airtight thali and nothing falls or get mixed.
The sweets r not great . .but good enough and innovative and pretty looking.
They also sell packed snacks.
Worth a visit!!

While going towards Taratala from New Alipore, the big shop opposite New Alipore Triangular Park never misses to catch a glimpse. The shop is well decorated with very polite waiters. It is an ultimate place for the vegetarians though the hard core non-veg people are sure to fall for their food. Their sweets are one of a kind & various types of sweets are available. All of them tastes equally delicious. Now, if we come to the food joint, I will obviously recommend their Thalis. They contain a butter nun, rice, two kinds of sabzi, a very soft & delicious gulab jamun, dahi vada, papad & achar. Its a complete meal. Other than this veg hakka noodles is available which is fairly good. Their malai kulfi is not to be missed. And if you are a street food lover, you can surely try their chaats, samosas & yes Pav Bhaji. The Bhaji is to die for. The price of the food is fair enough(VAT charged).

Ambience: I haven't been to the food court.  So judging only on the sweet shop. Felt the need of a few  tables and chairs so people could eat. The place was bit crowded.  I guess betting on itsi popularity its always the same..

Food: the items were eye appealing certainly tastes good.. but buying 2 paneer samosas and paneer cutlet costs me Rs. 114. And it did burn a hole in my pocket.

Gupta brothers has the best Rabdi in Kolkata. Also the other milk sweets and snacks are yummy. I have even loved the dining experience upstairs in new Alipore outlet. However they ve changed the decor recently and made it look like a canteen! 
The seasonal fruit sweets are the best over here. 
I recently took away  2sabjis for parcel(we were making Roti's only at home). They charged 120 bucks for just enough sabji for 1 person portion. I was disappointed with their overpricing act. Otherwise I love this place.

The pav bhaji counter infront of the store acts as a warm welcome with its delicious smell and great taste. The chinese thali is mind blowing and the snacks and veg items served are a must. Now-a-days the first floor section provides the seating arrangement to eat
On the whole sweet memories of gupta brothers loaded with lots of sweets.

I think no one is unaware of this outlet. You will ge sweets, snacks and many more.It is a confectionery store.
We are going since 2 years and i love the paneer dhokla, the ‚Äòdesi ghee ladddo‚Äô and you should also try lassi . Keep it up.

This place is a satisfactory confectionery with its attractive decorations on sweets. For the people who prefer salty treats like me, climb up the stairs to find the most heavenly taste of hariyali paneer kebabs!

Went there last week after a movie. The entire Chinese menu was unavailable. We were quite disappointed to see that. Even the thali option was limited. Nevertheless, we ordered rabri, paneer curry and rice, gulab jamun and onion cheese dosa. Rabri was awesomest!! Paneer curry rice was too good. The Gulab jamun melted in the mouth.. Cheese onion dosa tasted moderate. Overall, the experience was not bad. Reasonable price, good food and good service. Looking forward to some more visits with a hope to find everything in the menu available üòä

BEWARE THE ROACHES!!!

This review is about the food quality being served on the first floor restaurant of GUPTA BROTHERS.

What a way to begin ones day.
Went to have breakfast on my mom's birthday, but was throughly disappointed to receive the bad quality of service. But this was just the starter.
As the food started coming, we noticed that there was a COCKROACH in the vegetable of the 'club kachori'. When we informed this to the person serving us food, he simply took the bowl, checked it with his finger, and mumbled something and threw the insect in the wash basin. He didn't even have the manners to say sorry or say anything.
I informed this to the ground floor shop, and got to know that the first floor restaurant is given to a third party for maintaining and serving food. When I informed this to the cash counter person he said "Acha" (as in, okay). Surprised I repeated myself and was shocked to hear him say "Acha" once again followed by the most atrocious thing, "didn't he give a replacement for that?". Of all the things he could say, he was interested in knowing that. Even he wasn't sorry. He said something about "I will inform this to the superior" but thats all.
Quite a weird thing to happen with a big brand like GUPTA BROTHERS. but it seems that nowadays they are only interested in selling their brand only and not quality food. It seems that they are pretty much disinterested whether their customer falls I'll after having their food, as long as they are able to get money from the sale.
The first floor people were casual about a COCKROACH in the food shocked me to the core. I hope this is not a daily affair with that restaurant.
I am not going to go there anymore, and just wish that you don't as well. Even if you still decide to go to the first floor restaurant, I hope you don't get the same experience.
Oh, and bytheway there is only one waiter there in the morning (I am not sure whether he is there throughout the day since I went in the morning) but he smelled like he hasn't had a bath in many days.
To sum it all, it was a horrible experience, and even the customers on the ground-floor on hearing my complain and his reaction to it, thought the guy was a ridiculous person and was dealing with the problem like an jerk.

My visit to this place was a sudden and unplanned one. Since adda with my friends was the main motive, we ordered veg pasta in white sauce, sticking to simplicity. But jeez! It tasted wow and awesome.. Perhaps the best pasta I had ever, compared to many posh Italian restaurants in the city. The food section serves a huge list of dishes from Italian to North Indian to south Indian to simple junks. The decor is simple and the service is amicable too. :) I would love to visit here again!

Well well well what to say about gupta brothers,  they r well known for there sweets...  Personally  i just love their rabri..the normal as well as the flavoured ones.  
But this triangular park outlet have a dine in facility and a good place to eat for vegetarians and people with a sweet tooth. The kulfi,  mango lassi(summer special), shikhanji are all mt favourite...  The jhal frazi is also good.

This outlet is in New Alipore near to triangular park. Going there since very long time and really enjoy the food out there. The sandesh are just awesome. You should try it out specially kaccha gola aur Gud ka sandesh. I generally go to have morning breakfast. Kachori Sabzi and jalebis. Don't miss out. It's really nice. Full main course is also available including Chinese and indian. Will surely recommend to go there and give it a try.

Well...I have actually been eating here ever since the place was set up....it long back I dont even remember.

Sweets/Desserts - Just Delicious. For sweets my rating is 5..It is must try from those visiting Kolkata...I personally feel that they are best in Sandesh all types. Overall all the sweets are good and worth the price. Very innovative when it come to sweets.The are not only feast for your mouth but even for your eyes.

Snacks - Again very nice - 4.5/5. They serve delicious snacks be it singhara, Chinese singhara, ¬†kachori, dhokla, khandawi, Vadapao,etc.

Well speaking of others Starters and main course I would rate 3.5 ¬†reason simple being high expectation. When they opened I think quality/taste was just wow i.e. I would have given 5/5 but with time I feel the Dinning died..even they switched from restaurant to food court. Food is nice but not very different from others.

Being such an old customer I think they can improve anytime

One of the most under rated yet good hanging joint is this one...no complains about the mixed and papdi chat though we(me and my bestie) could not really differentiate the taste. another friend ordered chowmein with veg manchurian..well well it was really tasty..then we had gulab jamun with icecream(Since most of the desserts were unavailable for dont know what reasons). it was yummy as well. packed kaju katli in strawberry and kesariya flavours for my parents who loved them!! looking forward to visit sometime soon again

Gupta Brothers is set in a very prime location in New Alipore. Therefore they had a great task at hand to live up to the level of their locality. And trust me they have handled it fantastically. The food here is delicious. The starters such as Crispy Chilli babycorn is a must have. Their thali is great and is enough to satisfy anyone with a huge appetite. All the variety of food they offer under one roof has its authenticity maintained. In all a nice place to visit with your family.

For a decade now, still the best Sunday takeaway breakfast in the city. The Kachori Subzi they serve has to be amongst the best in the country...and nothing can stand in the way...not the crazy rush in the mornings, the long waits, the impossible parking...the food makes it all worth the while.

Today dropped in to buy some sweets for a family friend who stays in Parnashree. Being a pucca Dilliwala, had never heard about this place but was impressed by the array of sweets. What caught my eye was an innovation called Baked mix of rabri and nolen gur rasogolla. The taste was heavenly and the presrntation in an earthenware bowl was impressive. Should try out the other varieties during my next trip to Kolkata

"Gupta brothers", the name reminds me of my school. My school was situated at Behala, James Long Sarani and Gupta brothers is at New Alipore. Why the sudden reminiscence, you ask? Because whatever be the occasion, we always received food packets from Gupta brothers. A packet with Gupta brothers printed in red was a subject of intense happiness because that meant good food.

We usually received 3 savory items and 2 sweets. A samosa, A kachauri and another vegetable chop of some kind along with a Sandesh and a Gulab jamun which all dripped and smelled of pure ghee. Especially the Gulab jamun, It is a jamun made in heaven. Soft, succulent and everything nice. You cannot go wrong if you have put ghee in anything. Even Karela tastes better that way. (Haha!) During times, when it was an occasion which would roll down til lunch, we received lunch boxes that consisted of a brilliant white Pulao and a very tasty Paneer dish. Yum! Along with a quintessential sweet. Gupta brothers is a heritage and they have surely held their name awesomely well.¬†

They have a food court as well, which enables you to chill out and eat good food at the same time. However, I have not eaten at the shop individually but definitely would be tempted to eat there. Don't forget to eat the Shrikhand here.

Positives: The pure ghee, the heritage, the authenticity and the memories that it holds for me.
Negative: The price. For the very "Bangali parar mishtir dokaan" people, the price could be on the steeper side, could be. But however, even mishtannyo bhandars are increasing their price day by day and you cannot forget that Gupta brothers give you authenticity.

I would definitely come back, go back and live the aroma full of sweetness.¬†

And if people are wondering which school I belonged to then that is M.P Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School. Yes, you can think about admitting your dear ones in this school if for nothing, at least for the Gupta brothers food packets!

Location: Opposite triangular park, New Alipore.

This outlet is the second outlet of Gupta Brothers, the Alipore one being the oldest!
This outlet can be reached by a public conveyance which travels either towards Taratalla from Rashbehari/Tollygunge or from Taratalla towards Rashbehari/Tollygunge.
This outlet is a two-level outlet with a sweet cum snack shop with takeaway facilities on the ground floor and a food court offering different cuisines on self-service on the first floor. Earlier, the first floor used to be a restaurant which has now been renovated into a food court. 

The ambiance here is quite classy and has been given an elegant touch to it. The dark brown laminates blend well with the marble white interiors. This place has a wall-side arrangement for eating and sweet showcases around on the ground floor and table-chair arrangement (dine-in facility) on the first floor (food court). The ground floor section opens its doors to the customers at 7am and is all geared up to serve them piping hot savory snacks and fresh sweets which they have on offer. The food court section on the first floor which serves Chinese, North Indian Cuisines and Chats fully gears up to serve customers by 10am (partially open at 7am for breakfast offerings). 

Have been visiting this outlet for years now and have almost tried all the snacks and sweets they have on offer.  Let us summarize the whole fare into a recommendation list:

- Club Kachoris (4 pieces per plate; available only in the morning)
- Jalebi (Moderately sweet)
- Samosa 
- Dhokla
- Dahi Vada
- Boondi Ladoo
- Rasgulla
- Gulab Jamun
- Dil Khushar Barfi (Personal favorite)
- Chena payes 
- Rabri
- Fruit Sandesh (Mango, Strawberry etc.)
- Parwal Sandesh (gourd/potol sweet)
- Gulab Patti Sandesh (Rose petal Sweet)
- Abar Khabo (Personal favorite)
- Butter Naan
- Dal Makhani
- Seekh Kebab (Personal favorite)
- Paneer Butter Masala
- Chola Bhatura
- Pao Bhaji
- Paneer Tikka (Personal favorite)

The recommendation list would be updated in tune to the future visits.
[Last updated: January 28, 2015]

The service was always found to be prompt on usual days, but a bit slow on occasional days. The staff are courteous, polite and well-informed. 

The prices have a slight inclination towards the moderate.

Overall has always been a good experience. 
- A regular customer.

I guess no one is unaware about this outlet of "Gupta Brothers" located in block "J" of New Alipore opposite triangular park on the way towards taratala. This joint has been there for more than a decade now and slowly with complete dedication towards quality and customer satisfaction now they have become one of the top confectioner in town. They offer various kinds of sweets like- laddoos, jalebis motipaak, ras malai, sweet curd, gulab jamun, barfis, abarkhabo, rabri, rasgullas , various sandesh etc. Their snack offerings include- samosa, sandwiches, cutlets, aloo bhunda etc. Previously they used to serve their main courses on ground floor at the same olace along with the sweets and recently they have shifted their food department upstairs on the first floor named as "food court". Sitting arrangements are also provided. Their main course menus revolve around various veg declicacies like-(north indian includes) naan, kulchas, pulao, paneer butter masala, shahi paneer, daal makhani etc; (chinese includes) veg chowmein, fried rice, chilli paneer, crispy babycorn, veg manchurian etc. Every dish over here tastes great and the service is swift as well. To be specific "Gupta Brothers" is a boon to all the vegeterians of new alipore.

They have a lot of variety in their sweet section, just Rabri is of three type there (1)Plain rabri (2) keshariya rabri (3)nelen gurer rabri (seasonal). Choco sandesh to pyara, strawberry bell to rose petal mithai allll the items are mouth watering. Malpoa and dhokla are really finger licking.
On the first floor they have snacks station it's a not-that-good veg food joint. They took extra a.c charge if u wanna take food there (not applicable  in case of take away). Staffs are bit rude and lazy. As it's near to my place , i often visit there. The 3.5 rate is just gor their sweets section.

I mean it isnt so convenient to keep on asking"etar naam ki?etar daam koto?"
Their club kachori is his favourite.... We tried their strawberry sandesh....d slice of strawberry was unpalatably sour!!!! Although d sandesh was yum...their fried dhokla is also a yum thing!!

Want a sweet tooth while at New Alipur, Gupta Brothers is probably the best option and wait that is not it, they serve good vegetarian food and have a restaurant upstairs. The only issue is the staff in the shop. They seem really slow even when there is hardly anyone there, also you have to pay first and then wait. Kind of gets a bit irritating when your car is parked outside.

Almost everything that I have tried here till date seemed to have satisfied my taste buds. That said, there are two specific items that I'd love to recommend to anyone visiting this place. 

The first one would be the Veg sandwich. 
This has been a part of my breakfast for several weeks in a row and I don't regret one bite of it. Absolutely loved it.

The second would be the fried dhokla. Now this is something that I would give anything to have. This simply tastes amazing and I have been having this for the past 7-8 years and it still is my favourite when it comes to Gupta Bros. 

All in all, this place is a bank for buck(considering the sheer quality of the food).

I love Marwari food and Gupta Borthers is a shop that combines great sweets with Marwari food like Raj Kachori and its younger brothers. So, I am naturally attracted to this shop and I gove it a 3.5 only because I am a bigger lover of many Bengali sweet shops and also because Haldirams and Tiwari are better MArwari sweet shops. But this is also a marvel of a shop and worth a visit any day!

This prime  location sweet shop  is located just  opposite  the  New  Alipore  Triangular  park... they  are  famous  for  their   vegetarian  fare and   the  sweets...Gulab  Jamun  , Amriti ,  Mishti  Doi  and  other   sweets   from  the  shop  are   famous  in  the   nearby  areas!  The snacks  like    Chinese  samosa  ,   kachori  ,dhokla  ,  dosa  and   heavier  items like   Fried  rice  ,  paneer  ,  aloo  dam  etc  are   quite palatable  too ! They   are  known  to  experiment  with  their  sweets   while  maintaining   the   traditional   items   in  their  menu....So   when  it  comes  to  kiwi   sandesh  or   Chocolate  sandesh   you   can  rely   upon   Gupta to  find   these  novelties...  coming   to  Chocolate    sandesh   which    I   had  very  recently. ,  there   was  ample   amount  of  chocolate   and   the  chhena   sandesh  part  was  good   too  but   they   never  merged   the   two  elements   but   just coated  the  regular  sandesh   with  a  large   amount  of  chocolate...and  hence  the  result   was  just  average    falling   short  of the incredible  taste   expected  from  Gupta...  the  place  is  clean  and  hygienic... over  all  one  of  the  few  good Vegetarian Restaurant   chains  in  Kolkata  offering   an  array  of   vegetarian  dishes  and  sweets!

I have been to this place only once& I was thoroughly impressed, No undue pretensions, no fake confetti, this place unabashedly delivers what it promises- lip- smacking Indian vegetarian fare! 
 I had ordered paneer dosa for myself &a cheese mushroom dosa for my friend, and we both of us had a jolly good time gulping down the exquisite dosa variations. The paneer dosa had liberal sprinklings of paneer flavored with some tangy green chutney, while the cheese mushroom dosa was so gooey & tasty that you almost felt guilty! 
Order anything and I doubt there would be any room for disappointment. The thing with such restaurants is that they know their strengths inside out& stick to their strengths with unwavering resolve. Had this restaurant opened a Chinese or continental section, I seriously don't think they would have been half as good. Why experiment with everything when you know you can be the best in one department?
Hop in when you feel you've had enough meat & can't push down any more down your throat. Vegetarian fare tastes just as good!

this place is one of my favourite places to have full vegetarian food..every dish served here is soooooooo delicious...i love this place being a hardcore non-vegetarian i ama huge fan of their sweets and snacks..
coming to the food its delicious ,my most favourite ones are sandwiches ,kadai paneer,kali dal ,chole batore,pawbhaji,dahi chaats are the ones which makes my day...and not to forget samosas and jalebis were too good..i hav a huge love for rabri rasmalai and their malai kulfi which is just awesomeeeeeeeeee........they even offer north indian and chinese thalis which are even for takeaway..it has its name as a sweet shop but their snacks are just worth the price..
when my love for vegetarian food comes me and my gang of friends hit here to just treat our selves with gupta brothers mouth watering food items...i will continue to visit this place as many times possible..:)

You can't beat this place for consistency. This is another bigger branch of Gupta Brothers that serves up meals along with all the delicious sweets and the usual samosa, Kachori , Dhokla, chop etc. The Kachori Subzi and Hot Jalebi remains an eternal breakfast favorite especially on a Sunday in the cooler months. The days I don't carry in lunch from home an Aludum , Paneer Butter Masala or Kali Dal with Naan is a great lunch option. And their Chaats are excellent .....my  perennial favorites are the Papri Chaat and Raj Kachori but I recently tried the mixed chat and I am tripping on it :-). As for the sweets they are among the best on offer Badam ka Barfi is superb as are the Sandesh and Rasmalai. Tried the Kiwi Sandesh and really liked the flavors as well. Seasonally they have the Mango and Strawberry versions on offer as well. Pricing is fairly good and its got something to offer everyone even hardcore non-vegetarians like myself !!!!

This place is quite close to my office and through my collegues I discoverd that not only the sweets but the food is pretty good too ! I adore the Badam Barfi and the kulfi's are also very good ... most of the sweets are really excellent and they have a wide variety of savory snacks as well. Their kachori subzi makes for an excellent breakfast and is an old favourite. Their super soft naan acompanied with the paneer butter masala or kali dal is also very good. The chola bhatura is nice as well.The papri chaat and raj kachori are delicious and this is a great option to have a variety of snacky along with some really good sweets.

there are quite a few places,you'd opt out from visiting,when you are famished....as the pocket pinch might be a major hindrance...
However, when you are at Gupta Brothers....you needn't worry about that...
you can easily step in...and order from an array of cuisines-SOUTH INDIAN,PUNJABI,CHINESE...
Dunno,about the other two,but the Punjabi cuisine is..just YUUUUMMMMMMM!!
We decided to go with Butter Naan,Kadhai Paneer,and Paneer Hariyali Kabab...with a growling stomach in cue....and we weren't disappointed...we made our payment....and within 5 mins our order was served...
the location,of the place is a bit odd,as per the availability of vehicles...for instance...we had a real difficult time getting a  cab or an auto
Nevertheless,there are no complaints or regrets for my visit to this place...

Gupta Brothers started as a small sweet shop but with the success of its sweets and quick bite snacky items, they ventured into a comprehensive north indian and chinese menu with an expanded restaurant space. Located opposite new alipore triangular park beside saini hyundai, it is divided into two storeys. 

The ground floor is the area where you could get all the sweets, snacks items, thalis or takeaway from the menu for the main restaurant. There is an area in the corner where you could stand and eat. The staff are polite if you could initiate a conversation with them since they are worked up and in a hurry most of the time. First floor consists of the main restaurant which serves north indian and chinese cuisines apart from the items from downstairs. The space is compact but seats are comfortable. The staff here is polite, courteous and service is pretty quick. The ambience is average in my opinion and apt for grabbing a good lunch/ dinner if you are in the neighborhood but fails to provide a royal or grand dining experience.

In the context of sweets, they have a few competitors in that area which include balaram mullick, gokul, tewari but they are the best. I think this place presents one of the biggest variety of sweets in kolkata. The abar-khabo, gulab sandesh, mango rabri, chocolate milk cake are few of their best offerings and one of the best available in the city. After sharma rabri shoppe (which closed down) , i think these people make the best rabris in town. Presentaion of the gulab patti sandesh would always catch one's attention when you are wondering what to order.

Snack items include the samosas, cutlets, corn puffs, veg puffs, pizzas etc amongst which corn puff is the best and my favorite. They have paw bhajis, chola bhatura, dahi chaats etc too which are all very good and value for money. The thalis are a big offering here which have right combinations and are packed n sealed pretty well. For 200 bucks, thalis are a great takeaway and sufficient for a person. I prefer their north indian thali over the chinese one though.

The restaurant has a big menu for north indian food including various kebabs, chaats and vegetables. Kebabs are well grilled and are tasteful especially the achari paneer tikka which is my favorite. Crispy chilli babycorn is the best amongst the chinese starters. The main course dishes are very well made. Black dal is good, paneer makhani, koftas etc are pretty decent. Chinese cuisine is average and north indian offering is more promising. They also serve south indian food which is also very good.

But what deserves a special mention is their club kachoris and jalebi that they offer during breakfast hours. They are one of the best ones in the city  alongside gangaur or a chitrakut. The curry for the kachoris are very well made and tastes too good alongwith the crisp saffron flavored jalebis.

Gupta Brothers provides great food at great prices with its main forte being the sweets which would fall second only to the grish chandra dey and nakur chandra nandy or surendra nath which are located in north kolkata. As far as the restaurant goes, i think the inside restaurant experience isn't so grand but no negatives as far as food is concerned.

This Veg restaurant is above the famous sweet shop at triangular Park New Alipore. This place is a vegetarian's delight and that too at most reasonable prices.

While the ambience is nothing great - it is made up by the good service.

Dal Makhani was excellent as was Corn Palak. The Kadai Sabzee was strongly flavoured  with Coriander and we enjoyed it the most. Amongst the breads Cheese Garlic Naan is not to be missed. The Laccha Paratha is also a must try 
The Lassi was also well made

The Sweet shop has the most amazing range to offer and is easily the best in Kolkata. You must must have the Mango sandwich and if you are lucky enough to get it do not miss the Sitaphal sandesh (very short season). Amongst others, the various Rasmalais -  strawberry, Butterscotch are also a must try .

The food is very good. But I personally had a terrific experience on 15th April this year. It was my grandmother's shraddh at home. Approx 15 days prior to this, I had visited Gupta Brothers New Alipore for tasting some food which we had planned to serve our guests. I had placed order for a customized menu as per my choice. I had taken one option as the standard thali & got that packed for getting this tasted & checked at home before we finalize. I was very specific on the packing part. The other option was as per my choice - Peas Pulao, Kadhai Paneer, Veg cutlet, 2 sweets. They had packed it neatly - each item in foil packs with plastic spoon & tissue & then the entire thing put in a box. I found this option more convenient & presentable hence ordered for 70 boxes 3 days prior to 15th April with specific instruction that it should be packed the way it was shown to me. They confirmed the same & asked me to be at their shop by 10.30 am on 15th as the day being Poila Baisakh, there would be a rush. My representative had been there but she was handed over the same in the plastic thali trays !!! Half of the partitions were empty as those were customized as per their thali menus. My representative informed me from there & I spoke to their sales person asking them to repack but they refused to do so. I am sorry to say that it was so odd & awkward in front of guests, serving thalis half empty....This was terrible..... I would personally not go back to this place again for any such order requirement & have advised the same for my friends & relatives as well...... Very bad service from a shop of this repute !!!!!

First, the confectionery. The gulaab patti sandesh is marvellous and so are the chumchums and chocolate sandesh preparations. The other desserts are just okay. Among the snacks, the vada paw and patties are very good and the Chinese samosa is a speciality!! 

But what really steals the show is its buffet counter's simply AMAZING food! Be it any item on the menu for the day (although do look out for the kadhai paneer and even the Chinese platters), the food is outstanding, the best part being that it fits anyone's budget so easily!! It is so delicious and finger licking that you will always want to have more of it! 

It is a MUST try for everyone visiting in and around that area!

overall nice experience.

People who wants fast food plus eat at a restaurant plus who are pure vegetarians Gupta brothers is the place for them. It is situated opposite to anamika roll Center just near the triangular park, new Alipore . They offer various food items such as dhoklas, corn puffs , vada paw etc etc. they even offer rasgullas and gulab jamuns, pawbhajis ,jalebis. The best time to visit Gupta brothers is early Morning around 8 am and do a takeaway of the awesome sizzling hot kachoris they prepare. Kachori's are just available in the morning only. Gupta brothers have a dining facility at first floor too for people who want to eat proper food(Indian and Chinese cuisines) . One can also eat down too (Indian and Chinese) .Divided into two sections: The below section cater to the fast goers. The above section is the restaurant section serving at affordable prices and is really worth the pay.¬†

¬†In short,¬†1) Gupta brothers is a place where you get pure vegetarian food.¬†2) it offers excellent varieties of food to choose from+ even different shakes and drinks¬†¬†3) offers a dining service.¬†4) even supplies Chinese and Indian cuisines. It is worth a visit. Only Complaint : situated at the main road. Parking is a problem. Over Crowdy at times.¬†5) Prompt service.¬†6) Pocket Friendly.

Recently tried their north indian and chinese thali. North Indian Thali comprised of Naan, papad, dahi vada, dal, chana masala, paneer and rice. It was decent enough and was enough for two people who are not hardcore eaters. The chinese combo sucked real bad. All the dishes in the chinese combo apart from veg fried rice was horrendous. Pictures have been attached shortly.

My favorite veg food destination, so close to my home. the hot gulab jamun is heavenly. kaju barfi & kiwi sandesh are my fav too, in winter the nolen gurer kacha golla is just appropriate to enjoy the winter, so yummy. the dahi vada & pav bhaji are great. but again the hot gulab jamun & dahi vada are the must try item.

It's one of the cheap and hygienic restaurants in kolkata,
A full veg restaurant,
If you want to try its sweets then you should go to its Chetla branch,
It has been recently made air conditioned,
You would find trouble to place your order because of the rush,
The kachodis having the green pea filling is also awesome,
One will find people of all stratas, so enjoy the company,
Needs to improve its ambience,

It is a vegetarian restaurant...I do not like their cheese sandwich,,,,Crispy chilly baby corn is well made and also the Dahi Kabab. I think plain naan and yellow dal is wholesome..being a non-vegetarian i do not like vegetarian food at all. Dal Makhani is good too.
Kulfi is simply wow...it is my second fav. veg restaurant.

Gupta Brothers:
Gupta Brothers is certainly not one of the best sweet makers  Kolkata ( I personally prefer Girish Chandra and Nakur Nandy 's sweet shop far more than this one, for their sweets - especially the chocolate sandesh and traditional sweets - ) can offer but certainly it is one place where you can get new,innovative sweets; the best in quality and the best in taste.I'm rather fond of the mishti doi (sweet curd) and the rassogollas. The prices are a bit expensive but you won't worry about it as you delve into the ..... Other than their famous sweets section  the Gupta Brother 's  chhole batore , kachouri ,dum aloo and papri chaat are also very tasty.  The kulfi just melts into your mouth which is another food which you can try from here .

Verdict: Gupta Brothers have a wide range of food which you can choose from and you might just enjoy to drop in here for some food !

A plethora of fusion, traditional and innovative sweets is what you can expect and what you will get. The quality is unparalleled, but the price tag is a tad too expensive, but perhaps justified for what they offer.

The strawberry flavoured and chocolate flavoured rosogollas are now quite popular. The badam barfi is my personal favourite, though. They also make very fine veg fried rice, kachouri, dahi, naan and chhole bhatore. The packed lunch is also filling and very tasty, and though you can choose the components, the usual package of a rice, kaali dal, palak paneer, dum aloo and a choice of bread is quite good.

All in all, if you have a sweet tooth or are looking for a veggie breakfast, this might just be your place!

Pros: A good light food for the evening. No problem of stomach upset. Food is healthy.  My mom buys me a meal from here every Saturday and i never seem to get bored of it. They sometimes vary the contents of the meal though. But you would find best prepared healthy rajma here only in this meal.It sure looks nice to have different types of food in different holes and being presented to eat it at home. 

Cons: Packaging is sometimes too tight and difficult to open. Also the employees don't heed your requests. Although my mom tells them to replace the dahi vada in their meal with something else, and they say they would, but in reality they don't at all.


Conclusion: An ideal Marwari style healthy vegetarian food. A Light ideal snack for evening, with a perfect package of taste and nutrition. try it if you havent and you would be thanking my review : )

In a nutshell:
North Indian snacks, YUMM Kachoris, slurpy Jalebis & a host of Traditional & Fusion Bengali sweets. Food rules & nothing else does.

Description:

This is one place I have loved eating at for many years. I specially loved going to the rustic old shop at the crossing of Chetla Road & Chetla Haat Road - No chairs for people to sit, Hardly 4 -5 customers cud enter the shop - rest wud interact with the counter guys & eat standing on the road, interaction was informal & finally an orally calculated payable amount wud be verbally communicated by the server. This time around I saw that have picked up the adjacent property & r converting that to a sit & eat. 

The swankier shop at New Alipore came much later. This one is air conditioned, has ample space inside & still no seating system. There is a separate cash counter & 'slip / parchi' system to pay first & get the delivery later. This one is much more impersonal than the original one. 

Sweets r excellent here. There r traditional Bengali sweets, North Indian Sweets & also fusion sweets like 'abar khabo' that this shop is well known for. If u go the first time u can safely ask the guy at the counter for recommendation.

North Indian snacks are also available in a good variety - the typical 'Bhujiawala' kind of range, with some innovations as well.

We love the simple kachori subzi that they serve here & do not ever miss it during a trip to Kolkata. The Kachoris r full of flavour & excellent to taste, thus making it my second best 'kachori' in town. The Kachori at Sharma tea House is probably the best in Kolkata.

The subzi is spicy, somewhat rustic, perfect to taste (balance of salt, sweet, sour) & is at least 5 times better than the subzi at Bikanervala / OM sweets / Gulab Sweets Delhi / Gurgaon. 

The Jalebis r crispy, slightly sour & very good to taste. Once again the jalebis at Sharma Tea House, besides SSKM hospital score over this but on its own the jalebis at Gupta Brothers is thoroughly enjoyable.

Try out this shop if u have'nt so far. U will fall in love.

Really bad service they takes minimum 40mnts when the restaurant is nearly empty.Behaviour of the waiters are rude and make you feel that they are just doing favour by serving the food.
Quality of food is also not good but charges are high,so my suggestion opt for a different restaurant.
