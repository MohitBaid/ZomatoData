Worst experience ever.
We ordered chicken biriyani,tandoori roti and chicken kasha.the biriyani was tasteless and the meat was uncooked.
The rotis were served cold and hard.
The Chicken kasha was stale.
Moreover items are overpriced with comparison to quality.

Since this place does not attract customers, it lacks the required vibes. It seems like the waiters do not wish to work. The food was fine. It wasn't stale or such. It was freshly made but wasn't worth the price.

Have been here for like an umpteenth time..Be it a seniors' farewell or your own birthday treat..A very pocket friendly affair that I personally do not want to get rid of..The people who works here are very warm and can guide you into a miny trip of the menu..Let them..
And if you are here please do try the crispy chicken herein..

I have gone there many times. The service is quite good. But the quality of the food is okay type, not so much good. Whether the quantity is good. Price is reasonable, normal rate. Compare to other restaurants it is average.

Yesterday we visited this restaurant and we ordered:
1. Egg Biriyani - This egg biriyani not at all tasted like biriyani... it seemed so dry as if it was made day before yesterday. 
2. Paneer-do-pyaza- The paneer served was stale. when was complained they took no action.
A bad experience with this restaurant. The appetite was totally destroyed!

On my 25th birthday I experienced food at blossom. Seriously when I entered , literally I was dying of hunger. So at that time whatever dish will come in front of me, I will eat that. Luckily blossom didn't disappoint me with their food quality. Mixed fried rice and hong kong chicken was ordered. The quantity was huge. It was little bit impossible to anyone to eat one full plate. I enjoyed hong kong chicken. It was so spicy. But yes amvience was not upto that level. But just to simply enjoy good food definitely blossom a good choice.

Ordered chicken do pyazza and butter naan 2 days back. Delivery was swift however the taste was not good. Chicken was hard and not fresh. Gravy was very oily . Naan was also not properly cooked. There are fewer options for home delivery in liluah and almost all are bad.

Amazing non-veg. The chicken tandoori and biriyani is really good and worth trying. Chicken butter masala is also delicious. I've always ordered at home from this place 'cuz the crowd might be cheap. Might be. I haven't been inside so I don't know, but food is really good.

I always find the Place very deserted probably for the reason that the prices here are not reasonable.... I also find the staff members to be a bit distracted  . The place aint decorated , so I have stopped going there....
Too much bugs....

Going here with family was a good decision to try a new taste. Literally we had to search for the restaurant . No boards or signs. Just stairs. Verdict goes down when nobody cared to show us where to sit. We managed a four person table. The gravey of every main course is same. They just dip- serve it. And once the waiter leaves the room.. He is long gone.. My father was sitting ideally..plates empty. But the price range is ok. 4/5

The Chinese dishes are just awesome. Try Hong Kong rice and dry chilly chicken once. You will love it. The best blend of spices with the traditional Chinese dishes make it unique. Quality of biryani is not so good!

The two things good about this place are :1. Food is decent 2. Staff is polite. The staff is very polite and helpful. The food quality is so so but take the price, and its pretty good. The restaurant is located in a crampy place with poor ventilation. The AC wasn't working when we went there and whatever you say echoes across the walls.
