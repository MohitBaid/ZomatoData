Over the last few years, I have ordered customized cakes from different new bakeries. But by far, New Grissini stands out to be THE BEST of all... Very soft, perfectly sweet and wonderfully designed. I ordered customized Ferrero Rocher cake and it was fabulous ! One could eat a huge portion without feeling to be too heavy and bloated. Packaging and delivery was also very smart and timely. They have shown utmost professionalism by constantly communicating over WhatsApp and phone. I will certainly order cakes for myself in future and recommend to others too...

Ordered a birthday cake from here. This is newly opened bakery on Anwar shah road. I am a resident of Mumbai wanted to order a cake for my in-laws in Kolkata so I called the bakery for some queries. The lady I spoke to was very helpful and guided me really well. She had a few suggestions which she shared with me. I must say the service was excellent. they have a wide variety of cakes and you also have an option to customise the cake as per your requirement. What you need to do is just share a.pic with them on the number mentioned and they would prepare it and also share the quotation with you. I ordered a vanilla fruit.cake and everyone just loved it. The cake was fresh and very tasty. Everyone who ate the cake we're like they have never had such a tasty cake before.
Also the cake was delivered on time and there was someone from the bakery who coordinated well on the delivery part also. Overall my experience has been excellent with them. Looking forward to visit or order from here when I am in Kolkata. üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

My first time experience with customised cakes. Though they made it just as I would have liked it to be,they missed out on one very important detail about which they should have informed me. Their cakes remain intact for about an hour in room temperature after which they melt like ice cream,which happened to the cake I ordered for my friend and brought out for him to cut after 2 hours, only to find it totally spoilt. Taste-wise,very good. Wish could be happy,but I'm not cos my plan was damaged.

They accept payment by cash and Paytm  if you go for home delivery and they delivered it on time. Coming to the cake, it looked exactly the way shown in the photo and tasted amazing. The cake was soft and melt in the mouth. Tasted great and the cream was so light. Thank you New Grissini for such a lovely cake.....

Going through the recommending reviews of this place on Zomato,  finally I ordered a Chocolate Truffle cake one fine day. Had placed the order via zomato around 5 in the evening where they gave 7.30pm as the scheduled time by when the delivery would be made.

I got a call around 6.20pm from the delivery personnel who came for the same. Delivery was before time which I really appreciate. Now coming to the main point, the cake looked simple yet elegant. I liked the taste as was very much skeptical before ordering from this joint for the very first time. But tasted yummy and the cream melted under the tongue. What I missed was the pure chocolaty gooey effect which as of now I have only experienced from Kookie jar and Cakes.

Cake was basically too much creamy rather than chocolaty.

 Apart from such, as a new grown bakery it tasted way beyond from the other well known bakery franchises which we have at every corner of the locality.
 
It costed 360 plus 20 bucks as delivery charges.

Do try guys atleast once.

Today i got this cake from New Grissini for my friend's birthday. Today wouldn't have been so special without this lovely personalized cake. Yesterday i was panicking and was going through many options in zomato. Finally came across this confectionery. They just saved me. The owner here is very polite and cooperative. I don't have a single complain.
The price here is quite reasonable.
Talking about the taste and quality of the cake, you can just leave it on them. The cake tasted better than any other cake that i tried from other places. The fresh cream and quality just delighted me. Last but not the least, the design of the cake was almost near perfection.
So guys if you are looking for a perfect personalized cake within a tight budget, just give them a call.

My friend ordered my birthday cake from New Grissini and surely everyone loved it. It was one of the best cakes i had in a long time. The cream was perfectly soft and there was no bitterness of the dark chocolate. It was more like a perfectly blended mousse. Loved it.

_________________________________________________

This is my second time at New Grissini... We ordered a Coffee Mousse Cake and had it customised. They did the customisation with fondant...
While being there we also had the mango, blueberry and chocolate shakes. And chicken pizza The mango and blueberry shakes were really good.
The pizza was cheesy and full of chicken and corn. It was so hot that the cheese was literally melting in our mouths. Loved it.

The delivery experience was very nice. The delivery guys delivered the cake just before 12am. The cake was really looked nice and also very fresh and tasty.
They prepare the cake when you put your order.So give them atleast 2 to 3hrs for baking. The experience was nice and a sweet surprise to her.

I placed an order for my friend's  birthday a day before and they fetched it perfectly customised and beautifully done at the right time and right place. They even sent me a pic of the cake for approval before setting out for delivery. Very impressed by their service. Not expensive considering other popular cake shops in the city. Thank you so much New Grissini for making the day even more special.

Amazing cakes at more amazing prices. Craftsmanship and taste in every bake is their forte. Actually, Ranjit and his team including his wife have this small shop cum bakery in Poddar Nagar are the sweetest people on this earth and it is evident in their items. Do try their cakes or pastries at your next event or craving. Any design is possible without a price surge or compromise on flavour. They even deliver nearby South Kolkata at a nominal charge. I personally have tried their Red Velvet Cake, Chocolate Hazelnut (The one with the turtle on it, on my birthday), and Rich Chocolate Cake (GoT Themed one) and it was all very delicious and within 500Rs. Look for cakes nowhere else, Guys and Gals.. This is It..!!

As fresh and as rich it can get , the pure home made honest taste... You can feel the pure freshness of its cream and the juicy fresh fruits or other ingredients densely layered inside yet keeping the extraordinary softness of the cake. Don't expect lot of fancy decor you find in Google images. If it's just quality I prefer, I would not look anywhere else. Impressed by the timely delivery at doorstep.

I have tried ¬†their cakes quite a few times by now..... my ¬†1st time was on my daughters First birthday on 15.10.2015 ... they made it so very special ¬†for us.

Cakes are so well priced ......Value for money...

The last one that we ordered was the best...it was a custom-made strawberry mousse cake with red velvet topping. The cake tasted so fabulous that I could not wait to write a review and share a picture of the cake with everyone.

This is my very first review on Zomato. And I guess Grissini is the best place to start my review with. Grissini is the closest shop from my house, probably 2 min walk, yet I was a bit skeptical about this one at first. But I was proven wrong as soon as I walked into the shop. It's a small shop with wonders inside. Food is amazing, presentation is even better, and their behavior is the best. they welcome you cordially. Their pizza is the best at a very low cost. (only 60 for chicken pizza of 4 slices). I have tried their Double Chocolate mousse, chocolate mousse, black forest cake. And I really want to try their other varieties too. Prices are affordable as well. And the best part is they make it fresh. I will definitely suggest everyone to try this place at least once, you will be amazed.
