no place to sit,so stand and eat. A very tiny shop just beside the Central Bank of India ATM. A good place to grab some vada pav,not great though.But surely you can give it a try.

Location-Kidderpore,Kolkata.

We were quite hungry and want something for a quick bite and then we saw this outlet.We were quite surprised on seing it as most of its outlet in kolkata are closed but this one still survived.Its an extrmely small kiosk which serves different variety of vada pav along with some sides.Though its service was quite slow but the food wad good.We as usual tried our favourites-
1:Masala vada pav
2:Cheese vada pav(Grilled)

Food-4/5
Service-3.5/5

Quick service and friendly staff. Their cheese vada pav and classic vada pav is a favourite though it's a tad bit spicy. Pocket friendly prices.

Just opposite my school,in a very busy place,this joint is aptly placed for the school kids,love their range of vada pav,pocket friendly,only take away option as their is just one chair that to outside the outlet,their vada pav are a bit dry as they don't fill in the pav with butter or sauces or mayo,what ever u need has an xta charge,hence the normal Vadas are a bit dry.

Just had their classic vada pav today. It was very good 4 me as i luv spicy too much. Its not recommended 4 the ones who cannot eat spicy as it has an extreme of it. But their rate can be a little more pocket friendly. But u can surely give it a try.
