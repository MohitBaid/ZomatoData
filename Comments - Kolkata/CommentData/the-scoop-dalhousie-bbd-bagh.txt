Good place by the Ganges. After a stroll around Milennium Park and the Ganges Side you can come here for some snacks. Ice cream varieties and Pizza is nice over here. You need to order on the ground floor while sit on the first floor. It is a self serce restaurant.
Rhe olace has lost a bit if it's former glory. It used ti be a place of great buzz back in the 90's. Having ice cream over here and watching the sun set on the Ganges had been the idea of a perfect first date back then. There were not too many places akin to this at that time in Kolkata. Now,  of course the times have changed. The sitting area has diminished a bit in size and sitting arrangements are not comfortable enough too. Crowd is of mixed variety,  so don't expect a great ambience always. 
But then, the choice of icecreams are still good. So,  maybe worth a try.

Had been here twice. Tried only their icecreams which are great! Ambience is wonderful as it is situated just beside Ganga! We ordered as you like it which comprised of 2 scoops of vanilla and 3 scoops of any flavour as per our choice. This is a best place to sit ,have something light and have a chat with Ganga on the side.
