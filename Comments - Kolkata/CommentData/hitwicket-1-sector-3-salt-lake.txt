We went their almost at 8:30 pm in the eve. This outlet is not so crowded .
They have a lot of flavours for hookah although the mocktail they made tastes more like the sugarcane juice rather than a mocktail.
The waiter was well behaved and when we told him about the mocktail, he wanted to make it proper for us. I liked his service .
I would love to visit this place for trying out different flavours of hookah .

Ordered over Swiggy. The garlic naan was raw in the middle. You could see and taste the uncooked maida. The same issue cropped up with the achari chicken tikka. It was unevenly cooked. Some had chicken pieces which were red and undercooked in the middle while some were just fine. The achaar was too strong and too much in the kebab.

I went with my family to dine on 10th December 2017. The ambience is excellent. The restaurant is divided into two sections - The Fine Dining Section and the Hookah Section. They have a large spread of menu comprising of Continental, Indian, Thai, Oriental and Italian dishes. We tried something or other from every segment. The quality of food is excellent. The staffs are very courteous. The Manager (Pedro) made sure to take our feedback after every item was delivered. We ordered chicken Tom Yum Soup, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Golden Fried Fish Finger, Kolkata Style Betki Fry, Lemon Ginger Thai Fried Rice, Kung Pao Fish and Chicken Hawaiian Pizza. The prices are very pocket friendly especially keeping in mind the quality and quantity of each item. The best part is unlike most of the restaurants around the city now a days, they don't serve Basa but only pure and fresh Kolkata Betki! Looking forward to come back here very soon. One of the best Fine Dining restaurants in town!

This place is very reasonable, they serve awesome food and services are very polite and prompt. I personally never been to such a good, nice, cozy restaurant, I am very very satisfied. Starter to main course to desert awesome. And one most important thing well for me it is, they do have a very very clean & fresh washroom and hygienic environment. Give it a try for any occasion and you will not be disappointed. Good luck.

The food was good. Won't say it was outstanding because the food which you get for the price you pay which is a lot is expected to be of better standards. The drinks section needs to improve. The worst part of my experience was their lack of responsibly. I had visited with my friends who are very young teens not even 16 and had one adult with us . They still offered Hookah. Like it was normal for them serving hookahs to minors. Very expensive place . Good for hanging out with friends if you enjoy hookah. Not recommended for youngsters. Not highly recommended.

Nice ambience. Huge space allows you to throw yourself comfortable , especially if going in a group. One of the less talked about restaurant, primarily because of the hookah tag. I was amazed at the delicious food available here. Easily one of the best lasagna and Mughalai food. Coming back soon.

The food tasted good but the quantities are really less, compared to the prices they charge. We tried the green apple mojito, blue lagoon, Thai fried rice and a Thai chicken dish. The mocktails tasted average. Not a great experience overall.

Been here for late dinner last night i.e. 22/10/17

A real sophisticated ambuence with wonderful hostipitality... Really appreciste the Manager's attitude towards the customer - he asked for our opinin about our food preferences & suggested variance that can be arranged with a broad smile on face.

The food  quantity is quite good.. Can serve 2 people per plate.. N real sumptuous!

We ordered:
Crispy chicken
Baked chicken supreme
Grilled chicken with herb rice
Walnut brownie

Last but not the least pocket friendly..

The food and ambience is good. The interior after it had been renovated has really improved. We went during the pujo so the service was very clumsy. This would probably not be expected during normal days though.

Love the new renovation. 
From ground zero to hit wicket it's a huge huge change. The ambience now is pretty amazing , both the dining and the lounge. 
Amazing job done. The quality of the food or Shisha has not deteriorated even a single bit. The service has improved. 
A great spot to chill out.
