This place is near akankha more. For the first timers, it is a task to find out this place. The food is too delicious though they don't have much options. Food is worth the money. They amount of food is also good and don't apply taxes as well. Now coming to the best part, the decor is unique and awesome. All those neon lights grunge metal showpieces the little pond and open environment will give you the feel of a shack in Goa. It's a Paradise for bikers. But everyone can enjoy this place.
Happy fooding üòä

Hidden gem, it's difficult to find if you are 1st timer,located near Akanksha... Open 24*7... It's mainly a biker's cafe... Ambiance was cool and quite as it's hidden gem of town... We ordered Chicken fried rice, Chicken Manchurian... Quantity of rice was sufficient for only one person... Otherwise food was good...

Great ambience.  You will get a feel of old day's garage with amazing music. We ordered sandwich ,burger and Tea.  Those were good. Its specially a type of stoppage where bike riders take some break during their long tripüòÄ
Spend some quality time within reasonable price.

A nice concept of highway shack with lovely decor and a bon fire place. But I found the price of food to be to much. Food was good. Positive side is it is open whole night so anyone staying nearby can drop in.

3 visits down, this is our favourite place to eat for a lot of reasons. And so far I haven‚Äôt found anything which I don‚Äôt like about this place!!

1. Awesome food: from paranthas to fried rice to keema bun, burgers and pasta. We have tried almost everything. Must try Big Boy Paranthas and tea. Best paranthas in the city. 

2. Ambiance: a Bikers cafe... the real kinds. Rustic, unique and fun. Love the ammo containers, old gadgets and bike parts strewn all over the place!! Like the music they play too! Psychedelic lights in the evening üòç

3. Children and pet friendly: my 6 year old loves this place, a bamboo bridge, a beautiful Great Dane called Piston, a puppy, a cat and some crazy geese. What more does one want!

4. Lovely staff: From owner Priyadarshi to the servers, everyone is warm and welcoming. Make you feel like you‚Äôre at a friendly place 

5. Location: for me that‚Äôs a plus, for some it can also be a minus. Away from the hustle bustle of the traffic and peaceful. 

This is definitely one of the most fun places to eat at! And I know I will come here often..

Well I love this place because it's very very near to where I live.  Very difficult to find it you are a first timer here but you can always locate the akankha building and the narrow Road beside which leads to this awesome place. 
This place is a feel good and is a paradise for bikers or precisely motorcyclists.  This has the rustic and raw look one would love to see in a rock and roll moto culture.  I have seen the best of the bikes parked here.  
It is generally an outdoor seating cafe.  Very well and creatively decorated with bike parts to uplift the mood.  
I have had their 1000 cc omelette,  pasta and keema  bun.  Each one was awesome. They take very good care of the customers and the cafe can instantly change your mood to your betterment.  
Now the most important part.  This is a pet friendly cafe where they serve pet food.  And guess what..  When you enter the cafe a very special being welcomes you who is none other than a great Den named Piston. She is the most adorable dog  I have ever seen in my life.  And hence I recommend to the people this place who can handle a great den loitering around you while you savour the best of the dishes and feel the great ambience.

Visited there after getting all the information from zomato. Simply loved the decor..very rustic and innovative. Miniatures of bikes are hanging here and there. Menu ight not be elaborate but the quality of food and presentation is sure to catch ones eye. There is no duplicate available right now in this city. Once you are out on a long drive you will definitely want to get in to a place like this to refuel. We tried chicken bomb fries, their famous tea, lemonade, virgin mojito, burger and chicken paratha. Except the virgin mojito..all the other things were awesome. Must try place. With

It's been about 4 months since this cute little cafe opened near my place and after reading the reviews I finally decided to give it a visit. Early in the morning, my dad and I being tea lovers, ordered a sandwich and some tea. The sandwich was delicious and tea was pretty decent. Coming to the decor, everything placed is scrap material but it has its own beauty. I felt like being in a Goan beachside shack.
Overall the place is quite calm and I would love to visit again for the food! Keep it up üëç

A newly formed biker cafe near Akankha more. The surrounding is still not developed properly and is a bit dusty.

There is not much to choose from menu. I wish they expand their menu since whatever i had there was really good.

We ordered chicken paratha, chicken keema burger, white pasta, virgin mojito and black coffee. Food is really good. Chicken keema burger was really tasty and highly recommended. Other items were also good.

There is no ac and it can be really uncomfortable during summer.

We will definitely go back there, but, in summer, would avoid when sun is up.

It's a place you probably can't find without GPS but the moment you reach there you will feel you're somewhere at the middle of high way being welcomed by a rusty raw cafe. Themed after biker aficionados, a lovely place to chill out with your buddies. Landscape decorated with antique home appliances, sitting arrangements in a carelessly organized garage invokes inner roadies. Overall, medium standard food quality in a nice ambience created by some humble bunch of bike lovers.

Heard a lot about this place being famous for its late night food hungers... decided to visit the place, not late night but during a late afternoon time when the hunger was right on top and this was the neareat place to hang on.. located beside akhanka more and around 1 km away from city center 2. The surroundings are still not developed and once u visit this place it would be hard for sometime to believe that exactly this is the place u wanted to be in..  from the time we entered it was all rustic and all about bikes .. nothing extraordinary but it waas all real and cool.. u can even take a bike inside to a place where u want to sit n enjoy ur food.. the good and a new thing about this place is that its a pet friendly zone and have a completely diffrnt menu for the pets to dig in..
We decided to order for a veg sandwich and a loaded fries with cheese.. not much to choose from the menu. 
To me the food wasnt of that high taste and something new. But it was good enough to satisfy your hunger.  The fries were homemade with perfectly crisp and the sandwich had a coleslaw stuffing with some cucumbers and mayo as well.. enuf for two to satisfy their hubgers though.. 
Definately a recommendation for bike lovers.. but this place needs to introduce something to their menu and more value for money required i felt.. anyways great work guyz.. keep it goin..!! Cheers..üç∫üç∫

One of the best places to hangout with your friends...away from city husstle busstle...let me give you brief about this.
1. Location : bang opposite to petrol pump at akhankha mode. You need to take the lane right infront of Holland woods and you reach within 100mts
2. Place : is very rusty just like your garage. Very subtle n calm. Enjoy slow English music only.
3: Decor : as I mentioned above its rusty. Seats are all wooden n raw. A small pool type with 2swans floating will make your evening.
4. Food : it's good. You must try their highway tea and paratha specialty chicken paratha if you are non-veggie
5. Service : it's quite comfortable and the person greets you very well. You can ask for today's experiment to him. (Note : it's not available always).
6. Menu : menu options are very low but very good and customised food can be ordered. No liquor allowed. Should start with some morning snack like samosa (just a suggestion)

I will tell you about CONS now:
1. Since it's a open area make sure you put your misquote repelent on and don't wear shorts when you reach. Too much misquote in evening
2. You have to cross a small canal with wooden bamboo bridge and I find no security there. Watch it if you are going with kids
3. Outside lane is not lit properly and it is risky to park outside without any security of the restaurant. Parking at owners risk üôè
4. Price is on higher side like 40bucks for a tea doesn't go with the theme so owner might want to review it.

I am a regular visitor and will surely keep visiting. Happy Feasting friends.

This is a new cafe near Aakhanka more. Really Quirky bike themed restaurant. The look and feel of this place is really rustic and different from any of the cafes in Kolkata. This place has just started so we may see several upgrades in the upcoming days. Real fun place to sit and sip on some lemonade with friends. I will write another review in this place soon when I also grab something to eat.this time I took tea and lemonade as recommended by the owners. Both were refreshing. Highly recommended!!!

Very nice. A place to come with friends again and again, it never gets old. With their multiple outlets, it's become easy to find them in a metropolitan city. Hope they continue their good work. :)

Kolkata is called 'Vintage British', and opening up a cafe like Throttle Shrottle which is completely raw against the indoor pretty little cafes in the city is commendable.

The place is fully handmade with love and is perfect for the people who would love to connect with the nature and listen to the story behind this whole idea of the cafe. They have the perfect outdoor seating. You can even park your ride right next to your table.

Also it's a pet friendly zone. They will be happy to serve you and your pets too. They prepare amazing food with maximum use of organic ingredients. The staff is very humble and you can interact with the owner too. 

A big hand for creating such an exceptional place!

It is one of those rare restaurants in Kolkata. A very good place to for all occasions. You can visit it with your friends for a long adda over their lovely tea, coffee and lemonade.  You can take your kids out their ,  as they can run around and have some playful time. You can also have a cozy open air candle light date. Out of the city  hustle and bustle,it is a place to visit. The staff is very friendly and the food is good. With time, I am sure they will include more items in their menu.

Well If I could just say Kolkata was waiting for this!!!

The cafe is just too good, starting from the ambiance, hospitality till food everything is just perfect, its a perfect place to hang out with friends, well for Bikers like us this is " Ultimate place".

They have come out with very few dishes but yes in the best possible way. "Kickass Lemonade" is a must try along with Chicken Parantha.

If you are taking your bike to the cafe, you can just park the bike right next to your table and for us that is ultimate.

Just the place Bikers Wanted.

Kuddos to Team Throttle Shrottle.

This place is different and more pleasing than any other bikers cafe in kolkata. 
The food is delicious... the owner of the cafe is very young and understands what exactly is required for all the bikers like.
Pros: we can get our pet along, we can park our bikes next to where we sit inside the cafe, good food, great music.. 
Cons: little away from the main city but worth going.

Away from the chaos of the city, Throttle Shrottle is a serene cafe with great music. It's the perfect place to spend some quality time with friends. The ambience is very creative, something you don't see very often. The menu is limited but the food tastes great! i would especially recommend the aloo paratha! Must visit place!
