We visited this place on saptami last year. It was a bit small place to my liking. We had some limited options for ordering as this is common at puja time. we ordered chicken fried rice and Manchurian chicken we I really liked. The service was good but overall would be an average experience.

Taste of the Recipes are ok in the sense that if u have your food when your too hungry ..it will not disappoint you, foods over here are a bit costly

Checked in once long time ago, that's too because "Kowloon" was closed. 
And the experience was not at all up to the mark. Neither the food, nor the service was impressive.
Very ordinary/average experience it was to be honest.

bad experience.food is good in taste but not great  and quantity is not appropriate.wd the ambience it has and quality of the dishes this is not worthingly expensive place.o think only do bussiness during puja's courtesy suruchi sanga.n in short if u have options avoid it.

Nothing special about the ambience. A small restaurant just a few steps away from new alipore petrol pump towards tollygunje, it is situated on the left hand side of the way. Food quality and quantity is good. The price is a bit high.

Just beside the New Alipore Petrol Pump you can step in to the New Step Inn. Last time I visited this place on one of my friends birthday with a group of friends. Yes it is also a small once but enough to hold 20-25 people at once. Holding a perfect ambience for dinner with your special once if its not too crowdy at that moment. Decorations like aquarium & others makes the environment of the restaurant really good for a peaceful dinner where some dim lightings adds another final touch to it. Overall everything is well maintained & it can also offer a good family dinner too. Prices of the foods are little bit on the higher side over here. But needed to be mentioned that they took a bit long to deliver the foods to your table too, so do keep time on your hand when you have decided to visit this place.

Coming to the food : We ordered fried rice & chilli chicken as we were too hungry at that time. Fried rice were made of high quality rice that is easily feel able. Rice were not too wet neither too dry, just at the perfect side. It was neither too oily & vegetables & spices are mixed perfectly. About the chilli chicken they deliver 10 pieces per plate, pieces were real soft & juicy from inside with the taste of spices coming from inside too. Gravy tasted really good with the rice, neither it was too hot neither over spicy, just at the perfect side. I had tried their Biriyani too, but it doesn't touch my heart like other dishes. Biriyani was very light over here & a bit on the dryer side that tasted somehow average but not great.

Conclusion : I don't know about other reviews but I felt really good about this restaurant. Behaviour of the owner & staffs were also very pleasant. Their Chinese dishes are really up to the mark. All this makes it an ideal place for a good family dinner at any occasion.

Not at all value for money...Prices are too high...Ambience just OK OK . If no options left near by then you have to STEP INN......Overall not recommended.
