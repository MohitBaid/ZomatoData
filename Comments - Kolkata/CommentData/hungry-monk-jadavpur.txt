Visited there last evening. Place is a bit small but very budget friendly prices. Ordered pan fried momos in tomato sauce which were delicious. Egg chicken fried rice and Manchurian chicken. Both were extremely fulfilling. Thumbs up!

So if youre wondering how's the Thukpa here, here's your answer.
Conclusion for impatient people: It's nice, you're getting what you pay for, and sometimes its more than that, but don't expect something breathtaking or an experience of a lifetime.
Review: With an entrance that small, from the first time you see the place's outside, you'll have this thought: this isn't gonna be nice. But you still go in and surprising it's bigger than you thought. Still not specious enough, and I didn't really find tables with more than three chairs, so squads, you'll have to adjust. lt was empty, no one was there expect those Swiggy people who came occasionally and that quite
creepy waiter guy and us, two people. We chose the corner table and the AC wasn't on, and there were just who wall mounted fans which are pretty small and incapable of feeling you cool in those hot summer days. We waited for around 3 minutes and that waiter came, and we ordered 2 Thukpa's, one mixed, another chicken. No GST was charged, in
October 2017, so if it happens later, don't blame me, and total bill was of 180, 100 for the mixed, and 80 for the other one.
It arrived around 15-18mins later. And note, we were the only people there.
Now food. It was lovely, specially that soup. One of the best I've had. And chicken pieces were plenty floating around. Then the noodle was good, not amazing but above average. But in the mixed one, the prawn pieces were really small. Not bigger than your thumb nail, and very few. The bowls and spoons and forks were clean but I would've liked another plate
under bowl to prevent it from spilling. The water was clean. Good. About that creepy guy, he was staring at me for this whole we ate, no privacy. And that was kinda disturbing. Tissue dispenser had only 3. They didnt fill it up either. And the mixed soup was spicier
compared to the chicken. Your nose might run.
So the experience was good. 180 for two, and that quantity of food, we had a hard time reaching home because it was so much. This place is a bang for your buck, you're getting what you're paying for. And certainly a pretty good place for a casual grub when
your ghar ka khana isn't that good.

Bonus point: the music. It was good. Hindi and
international, it was a delight to our ears.

I had some difficulty finding it but the restaurant staff were kind enough to guide us through. Its a small joint but as the saying goes big things come in small packages this restaurant too packs a punch. Surprisingly cheap and scrumptious taste is their usp. Ordered chilli garlic noodles(it was off the menu) thai spice chicken, ginger rice non veg and cold coffee. Quantity was so much we had to pack the remainder.

A small outlet near pallysree more serving mainly chinese dishes. We went in for some casual snack hunger. We ordered mixed thukpa and dry chilly chicken. The chicken was nice but the thukpa was real bad. It was loaded with tomato sauce and smell was horrible.

This restaurant is located pretty much near to my home. Serves chinese and some thai food. I had ordered for.home delivery( oriental rice and thai spice chicken). The food was unbelievably cheap. Thai spice chicken costs just 140( packing extra). And it is a winner.  The rice too was value for money. Sufficient for.two and full of.chicken chunks.

They have created a buzz in the market.
Thus,went with a couple of my friends.
Ordered a plate of heaven.Not bad,but not authentic as well.Another order was Bangkok chicken,it was average.Last we had,mixed Schezwan hakka.It was not at all satisfactory.
Ambience is just average,thats why an average rating.
But cheers,its economical though.

A small & nicely decorated eatery near Bijoygarh, Pallishree. While you enter the restaurant, a life size painting of smiling budhha will draw your attention. & there are some funny cartoons also drawn in the wall. We had Drums of Heaven as starter which was really good in taste. Next we had Hungry Monk special fried rice & Chicken Gravy Noodles in main course. Both the dishes were good though I found the fried rice much tastier. We opted Chilli Honey Chicken which was too good. I loved the beautiful combo of sweet & spicy hot flavour of that dish. Overall highly reccomended if u running out of pocket really much but you want some nice chinese stuff. They din't charge any sort of extra tax/GST.

We ordered egg fried rice, chilli chicken and garlic chicken. Two plates of fried rice are ample for three people. However, one can barely found any piece of egg in fried rice. They probably used one egg to make two or three plates of fried rice. What disappointed me the most, is that the rice was served cold. Chilli chicken was average.Though I was impressed to notice that they removed the seeds from dried red chilli and used it thereafter in both the chicken dishes. Thus providing the dishes the necessary flavour of dried-chilli without making them too much spicy. I love garlic chicken the most. The blend of the aroma of garlic and the balanced sweetness in the dish is really appreciable. Both the dishes consist eight pieces medium-small chickens.The staffs are really polite and humble. The atmosphere is cool too. Overall, not so enchanted experience for those small rookie mistakes, otherwise a nice place with really cheap price(they don't charge GST)...

Chinese Food is always a weak spot for me and many more people. The taste and the verities are huge in Pan Asia Cuisine.  So, this puja if you want to taste some delicious Chinese and need to relax and satisfy your hunger after Pandal Hopping then The Hungry Monk will be the perfect place for you.  It‚Äôs a newly opened restaurant at Bijoygarh, near Rani Kuthi, Jadavpur area. Place is small, but decent d√©cor and delicious foods make this place a perfect dine in option. 

Recently I and my fellow foodie friends visited the place to taste some of their Puja Special Menu. Started with,

Drums of heaven ‚Äì Leg portion of chicken marinated with different spices and sauce and fried perfectly. Wrapped in aluminium foil and served. The taste was a mixture of saltiness and sweetness. Chicken was juicy and outer layer was crispy. 

Bangkok Chicken: Medium size chicken fillet marinated with different sauce and spices. It‚Äôs have a sweet tangy taste. Chicken was soft and juicy. Served with bell pepper. Like it.

Egg Chicken Hakka Noodle: Thin noodle tossed with fried egg and chicken and different vegetables like carrot, cabbage, bell pepper etc. Less oily and cooked perfectly. Try it with any kind of gravy preparation you want. 

Dry Chili Chicken: ‚ÄúDelicious‚Äù this one word is enough to describe this preparation. Medium pieces of boneless chicken marinated with soya sauce, chili sauce, pepper and different spices and shallow fried. Then added into a special homemade sauce with bell pepper and onions and allow to bubble it until it‚Äôs become dry. Chicken pieces were crispy from outside and juicy from inside. 

Dragon Chicken: Boneless chicken pieces cooked to perfection along with chopped bell pepper, onion, ginger, and garlic. This crispy crunchy preparation is a perfect starter option. 

Oriental Rice Non-Veg: This is fried rice tossed perfectly with fried eggs and different veggies. Taste good.

Garlic Chicken Gravy: Medium size boneless chicken pieces cooked in garlic based gravy. Less spicy and flavorful. Perfect gravy preparation. You can try it any kind of rice or noodle preparation as per your choice. 

Thai Spice Chicken Gravy: It is a delicious chicken soup. Mild spicy less oily. Served with butter cube form top. Taste like a bit of tomato soup. 

Pan-Fried Momo in Tomato Sauce: Chicken momo tossed perfectly with a gravy made with tomato sauce. Very flavourful delicious preparation. Simply mouthwatering. The tangy sweet momo preparation is a must try. 

The experience was fantastic. Quality and quantity both are good. Service is fast and staffs are friendly. The prices are also very pocket friendly. A perfect place to try Chinese during puja. Make sure to visit the with friends and families and enjoy the pet puja. Wish everyone A Very Happy Durga Puja.

Hungry Monk....such a Hidden Gem it is! The name itself is so unique.
This newly opened restaurant is located at Bijoygarh, Jadavpur. With a searing arrangement of 10/12 person this small cosy restaurant offers great chinese cuisines. Like large crackers in small package. 
The interior is simple yet classy. You will find eye catching pictures all over the walls. Cartoons replicating funny monks. 
The owner himself alongwith his co workers are very corteous. As they are launching new menus for upcoming Durga Puja, Team Panchphoron was invited to try out their innovations and we were really amazed.
So taking my walk through this food tasting.. the menu starts with

‚ñ† DRUMS OF HEAVEN- Ohh what a great start. Chicken pieces wrapped in foiled paper cooked with spicy tangy spices and is semi dry. The chicken alongwith the spices were so tasty. You just cant have one üòÉ
‚ñ† BANGKOK CHICKEN- Chunky chicken deep fried chicken served with sweet and salty sauces and veggies. Not very spicy. Good in taste. 
‚ñ† DRAGON CHICKEN- Deep fried small chicken balls which is sweet and tangy in flavour. Served with sauce in it. This will surely tantalize your taste buds.
‚ñ† EGG CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES- Noodles cooked in hakka style with lots of veggies, scrambled eggs and sliced chicken in it. Not very oily.A perfect wholesome meal.
‚ñ† DRY CHILLY CHICKEN- Chicken cooked semi dry with rich sweet salty flavour in it. Thr chicken pieces were crispy from outside and soft from inside. The dry gravy was cooked with onions, red and yellow bell pepeers in it. Complimented the egg chicken hakka noodles very well.
‚ñ† ORIENTAL NON VEG RICE- We all love chinese. And when it comes to chinese the name fried rice first comes to our mind. So here in Hungry Monk the rice itself stands in its own. The rice had the aroma in with garlic, onion, soya sauce in it. Perfect blend of every spices. The rice is cooked with lots of veggies including spring onion, red yellow and green bell peppers. The presentation was great as well.
‚ñ† GARLIC CHICKEN GRAVY- Garlic flavoured gravy with soft chicken pieces and bell peppers in it. The gravy is great in taste. The dish itself is very colourful and aromatic. Complimented the rice very well.
‚ñ† THAI SPICE CHICKEN GRAVY- Another great sides for rice or noodles. This is a thai speciality with their most powerful ingrediets like garlic, onion, oyster sauce, chilly sauce in it. The gravy was thick and little spicy in taste. The chicken pieces were large and was very succlucent.
‚ñ† PANFRIED MOMO IN TOMATO SAUCE- A perfect evening snack. Just munch around with family or friends. Panfried chicken stuffed momos served with tangy tomato sauce will make your evening more delightfull. 

So all in one pocket friendly restaurant which even accepts Paytm, even you can order through swiggy. The foods are really amazing in accordance with the  price. A great deal indeed with quantity and quality. Highly recommended. Till then happy eating. üòä

And yes I am a proud member of Team Panchphoron

Hungry Monk....such a Hidden Gem it is! The name itself is so unique.
This newly opened restaurant is located at Bijoygarh, Jadavpur. With a searing arrangement of 10/12 person this small cosy restaurant offers great chinese cuisines. Like large crackers in small package. 
The interior is simple yet classy. You will find eye catching pictures all over the walls. Cartoons replicating funny monks. 
The owner himself alongwith his co workers are very corteous. As they are launching new menus for upcoming Durga Puja, Team Panchphoron was invited to try out their innovations and we were really amazed.
So taking my walk through this food tasting.. the menu starts with

‚ñ† DRUMS OF HEAVEN- Ohh what a great start. Chicken pieces wrapped in foiled paper cooked with spicy tangy spices and is semi dry. The chicken alongwith the spices were so tasty. You just cant have one üòÉ
‚ñ† BANGKOK CHICKEN- Chunky chicken deep fried chicken served with sweet and salty sauces and veggies. Not very spicy. Good in taste. 
‚ñ† DRAGON CHICKEN- Deep fried small chicken balls which is sweet and tangy in flavour. Served with sauce in it. This will surely tantalize your taste buds.
‚ñ† EGG CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES- Noodles cooked in hakka style with lots of veggies, scrambled eggs and sliced chicken in it. Not very oily.A perfect wholesome meal.
‚ñ† DRY CHILLY CHICKEN- Chicken cooked semi dry with rich sweet salty flavour in it. Thr chicken pieces were crispy from outside and soft from inside. The dry gravy was cooked with onions, red and yellow bell pepeers in it. Complimented the egg chicken hakka noodles very well.
‚ñ† ORIENTAL NON VEG RICE- We all love chinese. And when it comes to chinese the name fried rice first comes to our mind. So here in Hungry Monk the rice itself stands in its own. The rice had the aroma in with garlic, onion, soya sauce in it. Perfect blend of every spices. The rice is cooked with lots of veggies including spring onion, red yellow and green bell peppers. The presentation was great as well.
‚ñ† GARLIC CHICKEN GRAVY- Garlic flavoured gravy with soft chicken pieces and bell peppers in it. The gravy is great in taste. The dish itself is very colourful and aromatic. Complimented the rice very well.
‚ñ† THAI SPICE CHICKEN GRAVY- Another great sides for rice or noodles. This is a thai speciality with their most powerful ingrediets like garlic, onion, oyster sauce, chilly sauce in it. The gravy was thick and little spicy in taste. The chicken pieces were large and was very succlucent.
‚ñ† PANFRIED MOMO IN TOMATO SAUCE- A perfect evening snack. Just munch around with family or friends. Panfried chicken stuffed momos served with tangy tomato sauce will make your evening more delightfull. 

So all in one pocket friendly restaurant which even accepts Paytm, even you can order through swiggy. The foods are really amazing in accordance with the  price. A great deal indeed with quantity and quality. Highly recommended. Till then happy eating. üòä

And yes I am a proud member of Team Panchphoron

For me, delicious food has always been a bundle of joy and apart from North Indian preparations, Pan-Asian cuisine always excites me. This is the one cuisine which gives you multiple options to choose from, each being different from other.This time we got the opportunity of having some mouth watering Chinese cuisine from The Hungry Monk . ¬†It‚Äôs a newly opend restaurant at Bijoygarh, Jadavpur. The d√©cor isn‚Äôt out of the world but decent enough for one to please their senses. Interiors are done simple yet elegant with a seating capacity of 15-20 people in one go. I have been invited here with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch . The menu start with

Located near pallisree crossing, it is a small establishment serving chinese and thai food. The place has 5 tables with 4 seats each and is generally empty, hence finding a seat wont be an issue here. Unfortunately i could not find veg momo's which I had heard being delicious, however the schezwan noodles were also good. Being a little oily, the last few bites left in the bowl were difficult to eat because of the excess oil content.

Hungry Monk - Food not up to the mark.¬†
=====
Location + Introduction:

This one is located in BijoyGarh area. It is like a hidden gem.¬†

I had been here with one of my friend to try out the food items here. As soon as you enter this place, the small cosy place along with slow soothing music gives a kickstart to your mood. There are buddha paintings and wall of fame where people write about their experience of the place. It is a very small outlet and nothing very fancy. The ambiance is just fine and the price pocket friendly. Now coming to the food.¬†
=====
What i ordered:

‚Ä¢ Chicken Momo - The momo was pathetic. There was a very different kind of smell in the momo. We ordered for a replacement but it did not help. Eventually, we cancelled the order by telling the person to take it away. It spoilt my palate miserably. I would never order momo again from here. The soup served with the momo was nice. It was a bit spicy and i liked it.¬†

‚Ä¢ Chicken Fried Rice - The chicken fried rice was fine but a bit over cooked. The egg added to the rice was burnt due to that.¬†

‚Ä¢ Garlic Chicken - The Garlic Chicken came in a lot of gravy. There was butter on top. I don't know maybe thats how they prefer to give it to the customers. In any case, authentic chinese is not authentic chinese in Kolkata. Some of the pieces were quite stiff but some of them were perfectly fine. This gave me a hint that they were using old stock pakoras along with the new ones. Disappointed with the meat tenderness.¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Staff is courteous.
‚Ä¢ Ambiance is small and cosy.¬†
‚Ä¢ Pocket friendly.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Pathetic dining experience.

‚Ä¢ Pathetic food quality and taste.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 200-450 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)

Lovely food within affordable price. We ordered hot and sour chicken soup, Hong Kong chicken first and it is quite good. We had ordered two kinds of chicken rice and one chicken preparation. That day we enjoyed quite good Chinese food. As it is close to my place, I am excited about this place. Please work on the ambience. Best of luck. üòä

Ordered food from this place through Swiggy so dont know where this food joint is actually situated.
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup-it was ok with chunks of chicken though sweetness could have been less to make it perfect, Chrispy chicken- 8pieces of fried chicken strips tossed with garlic red sauce- tested good though chicken pieces were fibrous.
We also ordered Pan fried chicken noodles- it was white gravy noodles. Generally pan fried noodles comes in a soya sauce but this is kind of normal chicken gravy noodles but taste was very nice and amount was ok.Chicken fried rice- it was very oily but flavour and taste was good and quantity was enormous, single plate sufficient for two people. Wid these two dishes there was chilly honey chicken to accompany. 8 cubes of chicken well prepared in a chilly soya sauce with a sweet flavour-good it was. The food was really good and the price were really friendly to pocket.

Today we had visited this outlet for an evening snack... the food taste was not upto the mark.. we had taken hot and sour soup which was too tangy in taste... we also ordered for dry chilly chicken which was too dry fried and burnt totally... service was also not good.. we had to ask for sauce tissue paper etc.. they even did not provide glasses for drinking water just a bottle was placed on the table..

I went to the place twice. It is a tiny place with a great ambience which is quite ideal and pocket friendly. My favourites from the first visit were the barbeque chicken and the brownie ice cream. The second time I visited there with a friend and we ordered pan fried momos.... and lo behold! They were the best pan fried momos i had! I would go back there any day for just those. The momos in tomato sauce were the tastiest. The host on both occasions were extremely friendly and co-operative. I totally love the place and am looking forward to going back there soon!

Today, had lunch with my kids. Once we had dinner also. Excellent food. They serve authentic Chinese dishes. Rates are moderate. Very homely ambience & most importantly this restaurant is run by young, energetic and well mannered bunch of guys. There are three areas of improvement. They are : 1) always there should be someone in the front office. The visitors should be attended by them immediately, like any other restaurants 2) side dishes should be served along with the main dish, and 3) reconsider the quantity especially of the noodles.

I ordered mixed noodles, hot and sour soup and shezwan chicken . It was my first ever order from the restaurant and I will never order from it . The noodles was bland without any flavours and the chicken can be anything but not shezwan(totally tasteless). The soup was average but I suggest the users not to be deceived by their cheap rate. The food was totally shit .

I would've rated it in negative if it was allowed

I am rating this place 1, could have given lower if there were provisions. 
Came along with my sister yesterday for dinner. We entered the place as it said 'open' and settled at a table. Surprisingly, there was no one from the staffs to guide us. Five minutes later, came in a person who misbehaved with us rudely and asked us to get out by flipping off the 'open' card to 'close' in front of us saying the place has closed down for the day. 
We got in because they kept the place 'open'. Then they drove us out. Never had such a poor experience in all my dining life. Never will they prosper with such hospitality. 
Just don't go there. Not at all recommended.

The worst chicken thukpa I ever had in my life.
Total waste of money.
I tried through swiggy home delivery.
Price was rs 90 .
Don't try thukpa at all.
They don't know how to make thukpa.
How can you add red chili paste so much without giving it separate?
You can't make it extremely spicy.
Red chilli paste should be given separate always because customer decide how much they wanna add.
Thukpa was extreme spicy and super hot.
A big thumps down.

We decided to visit this place after seeing the reviews and buying a coupon from the 'Little' app..¬† The coupon included:
1 chilli chicken/garlic chicken(8pcs) & 2 Chicken fried rice/noodles for takeaway.
It's bit difficult to locate and after reaching the place, the restaurant was closed for maintenance and we were asked to wait for some minutes, we went back after 5-7 mins and found it had opened. On entering the restaurant we were greeted by the host, who we presumed to be the owner of the restaurant. We told that we had a coupon and he asked us to wait while the food was being cooked. And it's worth mentioning he was very much well-mannered and knew the meaning of the word 'hospitality'. The interior decor was really good and minimalistic. The space is bit small but they've done their best in this small space. We got our order and then after reaching home when we tasted the food it just won our hearts. The quantity and quality were great! We loved the taste,and the quantity(2 fried rice dishes) was enough to serve 4 people. Overall, It was an awesome experience,would love to visit again! Alas! How I wish such restaurants were located in Behala.

A nice place to quench your hunger in a tiny place near Gandhi gate or Bijoygarh as one might say. The ambience is good (little music would have been nice), no complains about the food, its taste and its varieties are terrific! The price is pocket friendly and I would recommend people to try out the momos and baby corn chicken, the quantity is also commendable! Service is also good I think it will improve more in the longrun...Overall a very nice place !!

The place is small but very uniquely designed. Loved their interior. The hosts are really nice. We went with a little coupon and got 2 fried rice and chilli chicken for take away. The fried rice was really good and well prepared. The quantity is good too.

Been here yesterday evening. Get to know about this place from a reference. Ambience is fine. Price is very low. Hospitality is also good but the place is very small. Only 4 small tables in a small room. Not sure about the food quality as I received stale food. I ordered schezwan noodles, chicken hot & sour soup & schezwan chicken. Well the food when served was smelling a bit but I could not figure out which one. Later I felt that all of them were at least overnight old. Although I did not felt to  to draw the attention of the staff as I believe they intentionally served overnight food. What ever, not a good experience at all.

A small cozy joint located near the Allahabad Bank's ATM in Gadhi Colony, a tricky place to locate. This tiny place caters Tibetan and Chinese cuisines. 
We ordered Crispy Chilly Babycorn and Vegetable Hakka Noodles, which were nice and quite satisfying. 
But, they should serve water as soon as the customers enter. Otherwise, everything is ok.
Very reasonable price.

Went there out of a sudden whim.
The place is very beautifully decorated.
A very small place. Nice ambience. It says in zomato opens up at 4 pm. But in reality it opens at about 6 30 pm.  Extremely cheap i must say. We ordered
A chicken soup..priced only 65 which was really tasty.
American chopsuoy in the white sauce.
Taste is awesome.
Really delicious but the quantity is a bit on the lesser side. Okay for one person.
and garlic chicken. I loved that. 8 very small pieces tasted delicious.
Will be going there to try other dishes as soon as possible.

tiny outlet. i loved how elegantly they decorated the small area and utilized the space.¬†- provides free delivery¬†
- weird that they didnot charge any extra service tax outside the menu card. probably it is included.
- air conditioned. comfortable seating.
- a student can afford
- they dont have huge variety here. come on its newly opened and barely known to local people!
-serene ambience .¬†
- amateur stuff. the lady, might be the owner, serves good.¬†
- quantity depends on what kind of an eater you are. i am a hungry kid :3 and the quantity sufficed.¬†
- i ended up with chicken momo and brownie :3 expectation was high. clearly not saying anything without trying out their all dishes.
if the team is seeing this, i had to ask whether they accept cards instead of cash or not.Since my place is nearby..i ll always make it a point to call for home delivery whenever i have to fulfill chinese craving.¬†

Hungry Monk - i started eating here before it came in Zomato; it is a small, simple yet intersting place with good food and good people.
They have a small set of Chinese menu and i must say CHILI CHIKEN is a must try here - i would say it's a must visit place at cheap rate in this zone. Infact if you are too tiered to visit amd find it difficult to find th place just give them a buzz cz thy hv free home delivery  ;)

I was back to kolkata for a short trip and was searching for a place to have dinner with my cousins...I was passing by the usual kolkata traffic around pallyshree and here I saw a tiny restaurant  ( although it's not....my first impression was that...) I was thinking whether to go or not because mood was Chinese or Thai that day...and they served both so decided to venture in....and wow!the owner had put a lot of heart in aesthetically designing the interiors..the big Buddha pic is the best part and would keep u glued to the wall..the space is generous...it can accommodate around 14 persons in there..
So you people may be thinking where's the review for the food...wait guys it's coming..actually I like new entrepreneurs putting their blood and sweat..
Anyways now the food..
I did some takeaway...
Ordered Chicken pan Fried momo...veg rice...garlic chicken...Brownie...
The best highlight is the pan fried momo,Cafe Mocha and brownie according to me..
There's little lead time as it took around 10 minutes for our order to arrive..I really liked the pan fried momo..the smell of it could easily stimulate ur olfactory nerves..(soja kotha jive jol :) ) 
Pro's : The interior decoration
           The food
           The location 
           The Owner üòÅ you can easily form a bond with this person..he knows how to make u feel good and enjoy the food and ambience

Con's ...didn't find any

New restaurant which has recently opened in Bijoygarh near the Auto stand for Jadavpur. From outside it seemed to be a tiny yet decent place with a good ambiance. Effort is praiseworthy, food however is extremely disappointing. Everything which we had ordered tasted terrible and seemed to be a complete waste of money. The sweetcorn soup seemed as if was loaded with dozens of spoons of sugar, the crispy chicken did not have anything crispy or crunchy about it and it came in covered with gravy. Moreover, the dry chilli chicken ordered was really extremely spicy in spite of us specifically mentioning that spices should be kept to a minimum. Prices were reasonable but when food is such pathetic, prices should not be a yardstick for judging a place. Thus, the place needs huge amount of improvements especially in the quality of the dishes served.
