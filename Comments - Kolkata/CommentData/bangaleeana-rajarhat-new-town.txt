I order quite often from Bangaleeana and so far the food has been pretty okay. Their service is great though, they reach in no time. 
However, i find their portions to be very meagre and although i must say that they don't charge much, it is still lesser than other places from the vicinity. 
Atleast twice I have found that their food tasted stale which is a serious issue.

On sunday afternoon felt like ordering from a Bengali restaurant and saw this new place online. The menu was quite affordable. But what got in reality was unbelievable. Quantity wise it didnt matched the prices at all. Fish that I ordered ( aar maach ) was charged 140 rs for 1 pcs and got a small piece which tasted below average. And the begun bhaja was unexpected as there was only one piece and charged 40rs. What thugs these people are. And to top this they charged 50rs for packing which I couldnt understand as they gave plain containers with not even their name printed on it. What a mistake it spoilt our Sunday lunch. One word horrible.

I was craving a kobiraji and banaleeana was my only option. My order was limited to just a kobiraji and believe it or not I received the food almost after freaking hours! Hungry as crazy I waited patiently, the kobiraji was edible, the egg which is to be on top it was separate, the fish had a thick really thick breadcrumbs coating. I was dissapointed with the food and the time :(

Had much expectations from the place. Went there on dashami, the full menu was not available. Certain dishes at exorbitant prices were displayed in a menu which they deemed to be 'Puja Special'. However, food quality was also very bad. Need much improvement to attract customers.

We ordered Root, Alu fulkopir dalna, naboratno veg, Bhetki Paturi. Taste of alu fulkopi r dalna was good but Bhetki was average. Also not fresh. Veg items tastes really good.

This is my first visit with my friends and juniors .Ambience is good.we order plain rice, dal , mocha, vetki with tomato as suggested by their staff, in veg for juniors  jeera rice with nobratan Korma,misti doi . In my view  food quality is  inferior  than the price. Taste of mocha is bitter.  Vetki was so so , daal taste good  but not extra ordinary.  I am persol tried any veg item that's  why can't  said any thing. Overall  experience  was not so good.

We(around 20 people) were here on a friday afternoon for a team lunch. The place looks descent with seating accomodation of around 100 people(approx). the menu card had many items for display but most of them were unavailable, may be they were not expecting so many people on a weekend afternoon lunch. among many things that we ordered are fish fry, mochar chop, luchi, mutton kosha, mutton duckbunglow, chicken kosha, chicken duckbunglow, chicken thalli, ilish mach er matha diye pui saag, aar kalia etc. taste wise they were not bad but except the fish fry and a few other items none of them were authentic bengali platter.  ilish mach er matha diye pui saag lacked the mouth watering taste for which it is known, mutton and chicken dishes were also average. overall an average experience but looking forward to have a better one the next time.

We had ordered very few items in my father's office nearby for lunch.The delivery was prompt and food was nicely packed.The pulao was definitely the best among the lot.Sweet and fragnant though the rice was a bit mushy still tasted well with the mutton gravy.The mutton pieces in the mutton kasha was not up to the mark.3 very small pieces were given one being very stringy.We also ordered some aamer chutney but that was extremely sweet to my palate.

We were staying in a hotel nearby this place hence decided to order from here. Now the first time we ordered we had specifically mentioned to send green chillies along however not even onions were sent let aside green chillies. The food however tasted good hence ordered again. Daal had some vegetables in it so one might want to skip. Kathal was good in taste. What stood out was pabda tel jhal and mutton kosha. Ilisha bhapa and chicken was so so.

Order dinner on 10th June via Zomato. After placing the first order online via zomato, got a call from the restaurant saying that one item will not be available and they were suggesting some other item. I asked them to cancel the order and I ordered the suggested item via zomato again. I placed the order at 8:35 and it was supposed to be delivered at around 9:20 but it was delivered after 10:30 and that too after chatting with zomato and calling the restaurant multiple times. 

I don't know where is the issue but I have faced similar issue with Aminia too when order via zomato. 
Even the restaurant suggests to order directly.

Today we have ordered 2 plates of 'chhanar dalna' with 2 pieces in each and 1 plate of 'dhokar dalna' consisting of 3 pieces for dinner . Though the delivery was late due to rain but it was worth the wait .

The food being less spicy was damn delicious. The 'chhana' in chhanar dalna was fresh and 'dhoka' was well cooked too.

The dishes being affordable and delicious , this restaurant deserves a high recommendation .

Had ordered from this place for a family lunch. Decent Bengali food, has the homely touch to it. I loved their shukto. It's a little dry, but the taste is amazing. The good part about their food is the lack of excessive oil or spices to cater to the demands of fancy food served in restaurants, and maintaining the simple touch. Recommended.

Very poor and unprofessional behaviour towards customers and totally misfit for conducting buffet in any party. They don't charge VAT and can't provide proper cash memo.

Such an awful experience. Had high expectations from this place but it was a complete let down. We had ordered Basanti pulao..we expected well cooked rice but all we got was lumps of uncooked rice. Next we had ordered Chanar Dalna and we never ever have imagined in our wildest nightmares we would get PIECES OF BREAD instead of Chana! Such a disgusting experience. Third item on our plate was Chicken kastori which was bland. 

This restaurant doesn't deserve any rating. Since there's no option of marking 0 so had to rate it 1.

To my fellow foodies,please don't visit this restaurant rather cook a nice meal at home and enjoy!

Has a good variety in menu and really value for money. The taste however is quite simple which can be both good considering health and bad considering visiting a restaurant for fancy food. Maybe lunch preparation would be better since some of the items at night are prepared by putting cooked food in a microwave.

This is a good place for authentic bengali food specially the fish items. the fish items specially prawn and ilish is great. I liked the bati chingri chachori and dab chingri. The Basanti pulao is as good as in Bhojohori Manna. I visited this place a few times but all the items in the menu are not available always. Many items are not available on weekdays. The mutton duckbanglow is also great. The decor is quite ordinary and so the service.

Well im the first one to review this place and hence i will be honest :) 
This place is just beside arsalan and aminia which is huge competition for them, but since im a fan of bengali food , i went to taste their dishes. The food is really amazing, staff is vry frndly and service is quick! They have all the dishes a bengali cuisine restaurant would have and they do live upto the mark... Im craving for some good bengali food hence ordering this for lunch 😁
