It's essentially a club set-up more than a bar, hence one shouldn't expect restaurant-like hospitality or service, although it's almost at par with many good restaurants, and is improving constantly.
This place attracts teenagers more because of the casual common room-like ambience and the crazily low cost alcohol and food. Yes, the prices are the lowest I have come across in Kolkata. And hence, this place gets crowded easily.
You have to have a compulsory membership for eating/drinking here, which doesn't cost much.
Must try : Fried Ice-Cream

This place is located near southern avenue. And it has become quite popular among the south kolkata crowd. I have been here many a times with my friends & colleagues. Its a pocket friendly bar & restaurant, you just need to be a member of this club first. We usually go here on a weekend eve to chill with some beers or some pegs of BP, from the food section I have tried french fries, chicken stick, crispy chilli babycorn, chilli chicken dry, green pepper chicken, schezwan fried rice etc. These guys also have a good collection of cocktails we have tried their mojito and LIIT its not so bad you know. Bira is also available here.

I have honestly forgotten how many times I ha e been to this restaurant and each time I have been served with the same enthusiasm and zeal. Their range of drinks are quite affordable and pocket friendly. Among the dishes, peanut masala is my favourite. Light, savoury and a great snack to munch on.

I find this place very economic & pocket friendly. Staffs are very good, well mannered. Food quality is very good. Wide range of whiskey vodka Beer rum everything. Like this place very much. Only drawback is the space, the space between tables, chairs etc. Since the place is running short of space, the noise of people seems very disturbing. 
Fish finger and tandoori chicken is must try with drinks.
Have fun

This place is a regular and one of the  best places to hangout any day to chill with friends and gulp down a few drinks which are very reasonable on the pocket. Pair your drinks with a nice chicken reshmi kebab , french fries, peanuts , or egg salad . The place is small and the wait is high during weekends due to it’s high demand.The service is quick and prompt.The interior is simple with paintings from artists hung around as display, which means one can even purchase them.

The Eye Within Club is located in Southern Avenue just opposite to the Coastal Macha restaurant. The Eye Within Club came to our saviour on a day when we were madly searching for a place which serves Bira at an affordable price. However, the place requires one person to be a member of the club which can be done instantly for a price of Rs. 200 valid for a year. So we did it as we found the booze in the place to be quite cheap. We were disappointed on not having found any pork dishes in their menu. The snack which accompanied the drinks also leaves a bitter impression. The place is made out of a spare flat in a building which is commendable. Overall it was a mixed experience.

Located at southern avenue.This is the most pocket friendly bar cum restaurant in town.This restaurant is always crowded as it is highly pocket friendly.And most importantly,you need to carry your membership card and if you dont have one then you have to first be a member by paying Rs.200 for availing their services.Their service is quite quick and a must visit for all pocket money saving customers.

The place is usually crowdy and it will take some time to get a table.
Food : had tasted crispy chilli baby corn which tasted good.
Drinks : The really really cheap drinks were the cherry on the cake but one need to have a membership card worth RS 200 valid for 1 year to have drinks and should also carry an age proof id.

The food quality was pretty good and tasty according to the price. Drinks were also cheap compared to others. But the waiter made us wait for 45 minutes due to Puja rush and after we got the table, he informed that INR 200 should be given for club membership else food and drinks won't be served. This behaviour is totally unprofessional.

If you're here for drinks, then you'll  enjoy a lot considering you become their member and ready to shell out Rs 200 for that. We were here coz it was empty(Panchami Lunch). 

Ambience: 5/10-Nothing special, they call themselves a club and that's why they make u a member. A club with no proper ambience! 

Service(2/10): One of the worst I've seen in my life! There was no crowd, so no excuse of puja demand. Hard to reach the waiters, you need to tell them any problem 5 times for it to be checked. We wanted the AC towards us, they did it after a long while, have glasses for water only when asked and gave less in numbers. Brought more no. of plates and left it on the table. Bringing a bill takes a lot of time followed by returning your balance after a wait! 

Food
Chicken Tandoori(8/10): Only starter with 8pcs and we were 8 so, that's in our budget. It was very good.

Mixed F.Rice(6/10): The amount chicken, egg and veggies in the rice was quiet good. Quantity was decent but not good. Rice was well cooked but taste was very average. Not every restos can cook rice well.

Mixed Hakka Noodles(7/10): Better than the rice. Similar amount of chicken and eggs. Noodles taste good! Quantity is again, decent.

Hunan Chicken(7.5/10): Tastes good. Shredded. Can serve 2-4 people depending on the requirement. Student sharing can serve 4 and 8 of 2 sides are taken. Delicious! 

5 Spice Chicken(5/10): A bland preparation. The waiter said this will be shredded too but it wasn't! (Service prob again). Gravy was okay, chicken was well cooked but taste was just average! 

The bill was around 1910(including the membership which was also taxed, why?!) 
taking chicken instead of mixed rice and noodles will get you a cheaper per head cost!

Inexpensive and good, no other club/pub will provide a cheaper menu along with the neatly decked up ambience. But people who prefer dim light will not appreciate this place much. Chicken stick tastes awesome, so does the Indian cuisine here, North Indian to be precise. Oh yes, you HAVE TO become a club member (without spending any penny), just providing them with an ID proof of yours!

The only good thing about this place is that they serve alcohol at a very cheap rate. You need to get a membership card for entry. Otherwise food is not that great,service is very slow, you need to call them so many times to keep reminding about the orders. Being a non alcoholic person I dint find this place worthy enough. Starters are good compared to the other food items which are below average I must say. Went to this place twice just because my friends insisted so that they can drink at a cheap rate.

This place is what you'd call a true hidden gem. Hardly many people know about it, as the management I believe, don't concentrate on advertising or brand building through social media. If one lives or works nearby(Southern Avenue) it's the best place to hang out after office or for a cash strapped student it's a gold mine for binge drinking. 
For people who don't like to go easy on their livers, this place will go easy on your pockets. Hands down this is the place which provides the cheapest alcohol in town. They have a 2:1 offer on week days till 19:00 Hrs on select brands. 
Coming to the food, I have noticed that when the joint in less crowded, the quality and taste of the food is substantially better than busy days. Any non vegetarian Chinese or Indian starter would just about ideally accompany your alcohol.  Personally I would recommend the drums of heaven (ask them to make it a bit spicy) on relatively less crowded days.
Service is a tad slow but regular customers are adequately looked after and won't have any complains regarding the same.
Since the pricing is on the lower spectrum, as expected based on my experience, the ambiance is hardly the calling factor.

Though it gets a bit crowdy during the night hours and also they can improve a bit more on the service, but still i would recommend this place to others.. We had ordered around 24 pegs of whisky + 1 beer with 1 green pepper chicken, 1 pepper chicken, 1 fish tikka kebab, 3 masala papad and some french fries. All these at something around 4K was pretty amazing. Will be back again soon.

Old melodies all the bloody time can screw your mood ..sounds like a typical sealdah chay ka dukan but in the afternoon you'll get some special attention from them because only you would be the only cust they might have :)

Located in southern avenue, well lit restaurant (club) with moderately spaced seating arrangement. You just need an ID along with you to have food at this place. 
Prices are very reasonable and quality of food pretty much okayish. We had green pepper chichicken as per their suggestion and it tasted really good, complimented our drinks rather. Loved the cozy little place would recommend everyone for cheap booze and food. 
Only suggestion would be to improve on their service and over all look of the place.

The USP of this place is that alcohol is cheaper here than most joints around. So the place is quite crowded in the evenings particularly over the weekends. One needs to be a member of the club but they're accommodating and will easily make you a temporary member on valid ID proof. The food is just about ok but service is quite slow.( Maybe they're facilitating you to have an adda session). It's quite difficult to get a table on weekends when it's crowded and noisy and sometimes requires a long wait!!!

This is place is not open to all, as it has a serve members only policy.. Good thing is that they are accepting new members right now. Been here a lot of times in the past two years and i have witnessed their improvement.. Bar prices are a bit low as compared to the nearby places.. Food quality is great. Once you are a member u even start receiving offers via SMS which i really like.. But i would suggest improvements on the service segment as the waiting time may put you on the edge during the peak hours. But overall i really love this place for hangouts.

A friend of mine who has made several mistakes in life didn't make a mistake this time when he said, ''let's go to eye within" on a Saturday evening and that's how I got to know about this place and since then I have been going back for more.
It's kind of a members only club but they will issue you a temporary membership if you have a valid ID with you. Nothing much to talk about in regards to the ambience and seating arrangements which is congested but hey the food is good, the alcohol is cheap and yes, the waiters are friendly. 9 times out of 10 you will find the place crowded specially on the weekends and will have to wait for an hour or so for a seat but It's worth the wait.
Good for the old fashioned "adda sessions" with friends. You can try their chicken sticks, boiled chicken with vegetables (dry version),fried chicken with bones. Located in Southern Avenue, I would call this a hidden gem which is not very hidden anymore...

Everything is good about this restaurant except the fact that it remains closed at times without any prior notice. 
A calm place to sit and enjoy your food over some adda with your dear ones.
It has a charm in it because of the paintings and warm lights. It's kind of a bookstore too. 
Staffs are very friendly.. Sometimes you don't get to have what you order but then also(following the suggestions of the waiters) the food served is tasty..
Nothing grand about this place yet I like it since its less crowded even on occasions.

A late review. I visited this place during last year Durga pujo. They served average food, service was pathetic and considering the quality of food they make, I must say all the dishes were overpriced.
Also, they billed us incorrectly...and started arguing when we pointed out their mistake. After a lot of hassle things were sorted.
Never going back again.

This is a club mind it, so just don't go there after checking it in zomato. Now, my experience was that, so after a wait of around 10mins,we entered,  ordered for beer, the waiter said, sry no beer available, then I asked for white rum, they said, the stock ended, it will arrive today at any moment, then even for whisky there was limited choice. So,there were eyes within the club but definitely not liquor. Anyways, as optimistic as I am, will try it after few months and hopefully I ll say, I get my liquor within the club

Visited many times with friends. A very nice place to chill with friends. They serve mainly Chinese foods and alcoholic beverages. Smoking area is also available for smokers. Many times you have to wait to get seats as it is very popular. They serve good quality foods in very reasonable prices. You wouldn't find any bar which serves alcohol with good foods in such low price. Must visit if you have low budget and want to enjoy your evening with friends.

A so called pub without serving beer for today is an unique feat. The waiters were no good. Food and drinks took awful time to come. But what evened this was the price. A real bargain. 

P. S. : visit this for a real adda session, maybe the next table might join you. And you could even catch a live brawl.

This place is quite crowdy but I liked the concept behind this restaurant. There are a number of paintings hanging around, and it seems they promote newbie painters and exhibits their work for sale.
They had a good option for drinks which was pretty reasonable. The food was good but not great.
We had tried dragon chicken which was much sweeter. 
Chilli chicken was good, and even the mixed fried rice. We also ordered Soya Chilli chicken which had a milder taste and was pretty decent.
I would give 3.5 for this, 0.5 more because of the painting concept.

Price: on the cheaper side, value for money.
Food: unaware of the main courses but had two chicken    side dishes which were tasty and the pieces were large enough to make you more than happy.
Ambience: a great bar cum restaurant if you only want to have some drinks with your friends or colleagues, calm and soothing experience, no rush.

The most attractive point in coming here is the parking facility. 
We had a dinner party here yesterday. In entering the restaurant I was surprised to find it crowded. I had not expected it to be so crowded but being a bar being a Saturday night I think is a lethal combination.
The staff are polite and attentive.
The room is painted in bright yellow. The chairs are comfortable.
The food we had a mostly snacks. I loved fish fingers and aloo chats.
It is the best place to have drinks and laughter.

Personally I prefer to come down to this place, again n again, primarily coz of the price that the bar quotes against the drinks.. The ambience is not worth mentioning. But if someone is purely looking for an adda session for hours with frnz, then this is the place you should be looking for.. No loud music, great food, personal favourite being green pepper chicken (guys if not tried, that's my recommendation. N I think you gonna love it). So if not yet dropped in, plan out a reunion with old frnz n meet over a mug of beer!

It's a better place than rauls in South Kolkata to drink at a dirt cheap price.The ambience is good.There are some paintings on the wall by various artists for whom they hold exhibitions some times.Food is pretty good too.I only had the starters here.They are green chilli chicken and crispy chilli babycorn.I liked the babycorn more.It was crispy and was flavoured with a sweet and spicy sticky sauce.It goes really well with the drinks.There is no smoking area..you have to smoke outside but it's within the premises of the bar.And btw if you are a first timer you have to show a valid id proof to make a temporary membership card which is free of cost.Later when you drop by this place you have to show that card to drink and eat here.I have deducted marks for the major flaw in service.They are very slow and you have to call them repeatedly to get attention.Still it's worth coming here for its convenience in terms of location and price.

The best place to have economical booze and good snacks in the Tollygunge area. The seating maybe a bit cramped, but the liquor rates are very very economical, even cheaper than popular joints like green palace, oly pub, etc. The snacks are pretty good as well, and I was pleasantly surprised with the crispy mourla fry we ordered: it was amazing. The waiters are well behaved too, though the service is not as fast as you may like. But a good experience overall. Do remember, that the purpose for visiting here should be a hearty drinking session, not recommended for teetotalers.

Don't be shocked because I am giving a 3.5 and the rest are so low. The 0.5 extra is solely for the company I had when I visited this place.

Situated on Southern Avenue, this is not easy to miss. 
The club is situated on the first floor.  We reached around 7 and the place was filled, thankfully we got seats. interiors are very basic. The main USP is the cheap liquor and they really are cheap, especially in a place like southern avenue.

Started of with beers and whiskey. A blenders pride reserve 60 ml peg is 190 and a tuborg is 160 for the big bottle. The only tax they take is the service tax which is 6% and that's it.

Ordered a lot of starters. No table accompaniment. Everything has to be ordered. 
The chicken chinatown was the best starter of the lot. Crispy and cooked to perfection with good seasoning.
Boiled green peas with onions and tomatoes was there, which a friend ordered who is a regular at this place. 
We had ordered a fish and chips. It was served with a weird looking dip, the first bite gave off a very weird smell but on informing the staff they changed it no question asked. So I was really happy. 
The dry chili chicken was decent with big pieces of chicken. The kasturi kabab was nice. The crispy honey chicken had no chicken whatsoever. All it had was crispy fried flour. Huge disappointment.

Overall bill after having so much was 2353. Must visit if you are looking for cheap boozing area in south. Go by 7 pm otherwise a huge queue is there.

A sudden plan to grab some drinks and zomato helped me find this place in the vicinity. Located conveniently just by the side of the Southern Avenue Swimming Pool, this place is on the 1st floor. The interiors to be honest has nothing to talk about except the tiny tables and the ordinary chairs which placed very closed to each other making the place a little cramped. 

The booze is extremely cheap here and that is the main reason why this place remains crowded. I would suggest families to avoid this place as i found the ambience a bit rude. Best for bachelors and students. 

Going by the disappointing reviews on zomato, we were a bit reluctant in ordering fancy foods so went with the basics. First came the French Fries which was below par. The fries were hard and not properly fried. Next came the Egg Bhurji and Masala Peanuts. The Bhurji had too much of Chat Masala spread over it otherwise it was just ok. The Masala Peanuts was amazing though. The right amount of Onions and Tomato and the Masala made it perfect. 

The service is slow and the waiters are kind of ignorant and not at all trained. Don't be surpirsed if they spill some Cola/Whiskey on your clothes or table.

A happy place with happy prices.. The food is pretty okay, given the prices! Things on which they can improve are the following :

- They can increase the interior space. The crowds are ever increasing.

- They need a smoking zone.
- They really need to sort out the playlist. This will in turn improve the ambience .

- They need to include pork in their menu.

This one was suggested by one of my friends when we were discussing about cheap booze joints of the city. In fact is the only one among the 'cheap bars' where you can take a girl.
Located on southern avenue, this outlet can hardly be called anything. It's a club due to the fact that it serves alcohol to its patrons at dirt cheap prices. However getting a membership is quite expensive. They used to allow temporary memberships on showing a valid ID card, but that has been discontinued now. So be aware, you may or may not be served if you visit the place without an existing member.
The place is located on the first floor, seating is available for around 40 people though it's quite cramped.
The food is exorbitantly overpriced. It's better to keep to the alcohol. No finger food is served on the house so we ordered a plate of French fries, which seemed as if had been fried in the oil which had been previously used to fry fishes.
Service is average if not slow. I was disappointed to find that they didn't have ice cubes ready.

Visit this only if you have a card, & want to drink light on the pocket. Else for everything else it's a no no. Giving it .5 extra just because of the price factor.

The Eye Within Club failed to impress with mostly everything they offer. From the ambience to its hospitality everything was disappointing to be honest. The place is pretty ordinary with too many sitting arrangements in a small place making it uncomfortable for you. The staffs are not well behaved and doesn't know their work well. They are late in what they are doing and forget things which you have ordered. Rudeness was another thing which should be included in the list. 
The food was not good at all.
We took Chatpata Corn which was just boiled and served with cucumber and onion. Not worth the price. Then came the Masala Papad which was just another horrific thing we came across in the evening. One plain papad served with tomato and onion. The masala peanut was good. The best out of all bad was the Chilly Chicken in Oyster Sauce.
The only thing which will take you to this place is the price of alcohol. Its really cheap. So if you want to drink without investing much you can think about this place. But other than that there are no positives i could find here.

2.5/5 for its price tag of drinks

So one Saturday evening , we took out our car for this club. We had to wait for more than 30 mins to get a seat. But Man , Did I like this place ! Alcohol is quite affordable. We ordered their French Fries , Fried Chicken( A No! No!) and Fried Chilli Prawns which was so sumptuous. The people serving us were friendly , polite and helpful all the way. It won't be a stretch to say that this Club is worth regularly frequenting to , for its honest , friendly ambience , service, food and affordable alcohol.

There are certain decisions we all make in life that we are not very proud of, let’s just assume, this is one of mine. Since alcohol does not interest me, there was not much in this visit for me to be excited about. The food is Edible. The Chicken Tandoori is one of the few decent dishes on the menu. Let’s just leave it at that.

The Eye Within Club is a Mecca for people looking for cheap liquor and something to chew upon while sipping at their favorite drinks. If you are someone, who looks forward to the food a place serves and the ambience it beholds, then you have better option to drop by.

A nice place to have cheap booze and hang out.This place served standard quality food,
But its less in quantity,we had to order 3xmixed fried rice for 4 people
Its best you order finger foods
But,the last thing i would like to add is that the service was good for a crowded saturday night,the ambience was decent location is a bit complicated for those who don't know the area quite well..

When I came here for the first time the service was good. But wen I came for the second time, I realised that the service has seriously dropped down to level zero. It's pathetic. 
Ordered the food n then waiting for more than half an hour to get delivered. People shouting like a fish market but oops they are gossiping among themselves. The ambience the service the waiters all are totally a disgusting. Recommending people not to go to this place. It has really become cheap n horrible.

In recent times this place have came up to the youths of south mainly coz of the extremely cheap price of liquor. On my first visit, as expected I was quiet happy with the prices. The food was not that much good though, but was edible . The major turn down was the ambience. But you can't control on the ambience once you provide liquor at such a cheap rate.

Unlike a lot of people I see first what to be expected from outlet this place focuses on cheap alcohol , a decent ambience and average food quality. Coming from this industry I can very well say that hidden charges are not there So they don't provide peanuts and other table siders Its a great place to hang out over a couple of drinks..

Open to only members and guests, this place is filled with drinkers and has a moderate young to middle aged crowd. Booze is the first recommendation here apart from finger food. We were greeted with a weird smell upon entering. That certainly needs to be worked upon. Quantity of food could be worked upon. Taste seemed alright to go with drinks but nothing extraordinary. Items that could be tried are green pepper chicken and Hong Kong fish and chicken. Overall was an okay experience.

This is one place one really needs to go to.. Really cheap alcohol and food. Quality of food is pretty good. Ambience is average. It does get a bit loud at times. However because of the fact that the alcohol is really cheap and the service is pretty quick, its a bliss for those who want to hangout with a couple of drinks without shedding much. I personally love the place.

Cheap and affordable bar at a good location. The staff are friendly. Nice ambience. Food a bit too costly, for e.g Mixed fried rice cost Rs. 200. Smoking is not allowed inside. Car and bike parking facility is absent
PLEASE carry a valid identity proof card (they would make some temporary membership card) with you, without which you won't get anything.

the place is really meant to have cheap booze only. the make you register with them with an ID since they are a club, although it doesn't even look like a real club at all. anyway the food was of an average quality. the kebabs were nice. the chicken drumsticks were of a below average quality. but whatever their backlog is they make it up with the booze prices. but the waiters are inept. the ambiance is nothing worth mentioning about.

I had a very dissappointing experience with this place on my first and only visit.This place might offer cheap booze but it definitely needs to improve on it's quality of food.The staffs are not at all trained and they frequently mix up the orders...They are of the impression that once you are drunk,you would hardly remember what you are eating!!!

The space is quite big and they have a TV as well,so if you go on the day of a match you won't be dissappointed.They have a separate bar section where you can go with your group of friends.

We took starters with our drinks:-

Finger Chips-This was absolutely burnt and tasted quite bad.

Three pepper prawn-This was too salty.The worst part is that we had to send back 3 different dishes to get what we finally wanted.

Pepper fish-This was a version of three pepper prawn.So nothing much to comment about it.

Tandoori Chicken-This was average.Probably the only decent dish to eat.

This place is ideally suited for cheap booze and nothing else.So,if you visit this place,please don't expect anything much when it comes to food.

Now this is one of the newly opened bars. The prices for the drinks are not very high and pocket friendly. But the crowd isn't good. Moreover they take a whole lot of time to serve the food. Once you order something with your drink, you'll find yourself finishing off the drink by the time your food arrives. The staff isn't friendly as well.
Just because of the cheap cost you'll find few college students and drunkards sitting here. So I would suggest you not to visit this place unless you're extremely tight on your budget.

If you want to get really drunk, you can't find a better place than this. This joint serves booze at an extremely cheap rate and the taxes are nearly negligible. The decor is proper and the ambience is nice. The quality of the food is average. Service is okay although the place is a little cramped. If you dont have a membership card, no sweat. Just show them an ID proof and they are will issue a temporary membership card for you.

CHEAP BOOZE, Almost no taxes. Not so cheap beers and quite a variety of food, that more or less sums this place up. Neat and clean decor, good crowd, very convenient location with hassle free parking spaces do you need any more reasons.
they do ask for a membership,(being a club and all) but with a ID card temporary cards are issued.(Hope they screen em too). Very very friendly staffs as well.
An excellent place to hang out, get drunk over lots of catching up or stories.

Apart from the cheap rates of alcohol..This place offers a decent food. 
The Pan fried chili chicken is a must try.
The only con I faced is the ambience.
But if you're getting alcohol at this price,who cares about the ambience.. ;)

A decent family restaurant. Bar is available. Visited it yesterday with a group of friends. We ordered for crispy honey chicken, chilli garlic noodles, chilli garlic rice, schezwan rice, shredded chicken spicy. Food is good. The price of liquor is pretty reasonable. There are a number or finger food items in the bar menu to take as sides with any alcoholic beverage.

Its a pretty decent place and the prices are quite affordable. 
Food quality - average, like one wouldn't complain about it.
But i would have just one complaint with the place and that is, they serve pretty slow. They made me wait atleast 10-12mins each time i asked them to refill our drinks. Other than that its a pretty decent place.

For those who don't know, please carry an ID for you'll need it to fill-in the membership details! Membership is free though.

One of the cheapest bar in the southern region. The eye within club really scores in this section. It is very spacious and the decoration is really nice. We ordered their chrispy chicken and chilli babycorn and they are quite good. A bit disappointing is that you have to buy peanuts separately, and that costs 50bucks!!! no complementary chaats of any sort. Serving was very poor, you have to wait a lot but the waiters are friendly in nature.

If you are looking for a drink at cheap rates....then this is the place. No other big positive meets the eye. Food is Ok....the rates are a bit on the higher side considering the quality and quantity. Service is laid back (least said). If you are out with friends and your demands are not high....then this place would suffice. Don't expect much from the ambience. 
Not bad...Not good....this place will do when you are having a hollow pocket and need to enjoy with friends.

The name is very unique for a restaurant. it was Sasthi, 2015, me & my husband was too much hungry after visiting several puja pandals. We saw this place and entered. Well, the entrance is quite cliche. Seating arrangement is fine.

Now come to the food. The food quality and quantity, both are good. We ordered Chicken Drumstick, Chicken Hakka Noodles, and Chicken Manchurian. Each and every dish was fine in taste.

But the most problematic issue is here, the service. The service is extremely poor. After asking, they served the water. Then again we had to ask for glass. The starter was on the table but plate was not!. We had to again ask for fork. No sauce or viniger was on the table. After asking they gave us sauce. When we were asking something, they were not listening properly. As, I was very much upset with their service, I could not enjoy my food at all. My mind was asking me to leave the place ASAP.

It was really a disappointing visit. & surely we will not visit this place ever.

Folks! If you want a place to hang around with your gang, be it a weekday / weekend, after work, IWC is the place to cheer for !

One of the lowest rates for beverages & munchies on offer, once tried, I bet you would look forward to come back again. 

The crowd is decent, mostly young Cosmo. 

Decor is soothing. Lighting is just optimum to put you in the right mood.

Superb location, bang on the main road - Southern Avenue.

Being a Vegetarian- I prefer their boiled masala sweet corn, aloo chat, stuffed mushroom.

Guys! If you're Non-Vegetarian, don't get surprised if you are asked to taste exquisite entree  like "Mourola Mach Bhaja" in between the regular starters like Chips & Chanachur. Tandoori items are equally good - my gang-members say !

However, to become a regular at this place, you need to take a temporary membership at no cost, and you would be given a card with a membership number, which you need to quote every time you go afterwards.

We ordered fish finger, french fries and Tandoori chicken. The fish finger was one of the best I have had in recent times. The tartar sauce they served with it was awesome. French fries was nice. Tandoori was well cooked but nothing special. Overall a nice place to come and enjoy a few drinks with friends

Went there in a group during pujas, on panchami... One of the worst places i have ever been to... Took nearly 1.5 hrs to serve us the food... And our orders wernt even out of the ordinary... Fried rice... Chilli chicken and stuff.... After serving... The waiters dint noe which dish was which... And ended up mixing the orders... Also the quantity was very very less... All of us had to somehow finish the food... Pay the bill... And go to another place to have our lunch... Very very disappointed with this place... If it doesnt raise its standards... It wont survive in a place like kolkata....

It is undoubtedly a good place to have lunch/dinner.
The best thing about this place is that during the maddening crowd of Pujas, I didn't have to wait much for my orders.
And the thing which surprised the most is that they don't compromise with the quality of the food.
No matter what you order, you will definitely like the food.

And yes...it also has liquor licence..!!  ;-)

went there on sashti..the worst restaurant ever visited..we ordered 2 plates chicken biryan,one plate fried rice and schezwan chicken..the biryani was served cold n the chicken in it tasted worse than the rice...quantity was not sufficient..the fried rice was even much less in quantity..the schezwan chicken was not properly cooked..and the service is their worst part..the waiters were surprisingly very rude,didn't listen to what was being told..they even refused to serve when asked to do so saying that they have other works to do..we were literally shocked by the waiters' behaviour..nothing good or positive about THE EYE WITHIN CLUB

A grate place to have whisky . Relatively cheaper than other bars. But beside that cost of food  is very high which totally justify it's quality . If you want to take food as well as drink in southern Avenue, then it is the best place.

First of all it is not a restaurant, it is a club and you have to become a member no matter what it is i.e. temporary or permanent. Well the ambience is nice.
I went there just to have some drinks because drinks are really very cheap. You can have signature and blender's pride 60ml at just Rs. 90 and Rs. 110 respectively.
Side dishes like chicken kebabs and crispy chilli baby corns are also good.

Checks all the right boxes for cheap drinks and ok category food that is inexpensive and relies on quantity... The members only is a little funny aspect though!!!

The place is good for drinks in an hot afternoon when it is not possible to sit inside the lake compound. Nice for hangouts with friends. The alcohol is really cheap so it is the best place for recently-turned-adults.

Nice place...
The ambience is also very good...
The main attraction is the alcohol like 60ml Signature Premium is Rs. 120/- only...
The food is kind a oke types now coming to the service, it's just disgusting...
Like me and my frnd ordered for a repeat and the time taken to serve was arnd half an hour and more over one repeat came lyk we said we we wanted repeat to this the waiter said no only one of u said repeat so I brought only one like is he blind or what both of us finished the drink at the same time and then ordered and he was like no you didn't say 2...
Jo Bhi ho guyz if time is not the factor then the place is best for boozing...

A place closer home than Oly, which serves alcohol at such low prices! Yes, that is perhaps the only USP for this place! Food tastes decent but beware of some shady people who frequent this club, one of the reasons why it is not so popular amongst me and my friends! Folks are quite on the 'not-courteous' side and it takes ages to get your drinks and food even when it's practically empty!

The bar is Cheap...a strange amalgamation of cheap and classy..The waiters are neither quick nor courteous. DO NOT ORDER any food from the bar menu...a serious let down. And it has a strange potrait which grabbed my attention. Haven't really fathomed its meaning. Will have to return and drown a few pegs again

It's a casual bar located just opposite to the southern avenue swimming club. Coming to the features:-
BIGGEST drawback---The service SUCKS literally!
One single dish ordered intially and we were planning order some more but it took them 1.2 hours to serve! Like almost 1.5 hrs for a crispy chill baby corn?!!!
It therefore made us order no more or we had to stay up there the entire night for them to serve the others!
yep! It's that poor! >_

Coming to the pros-
the only supporting element of this particular place is it's price which is mostly affordable for both liqours and food than most other bars in town.
P.S- the only dish that was ordered was not even tasting good! :/

Nice place. Nice food. Shit service. Shit punctuality. On the flip side, a very warm and happening behavior from the staff, cant complain much. Hitting the place very soon again purely cuz of the location and ambience. People should give it a try. Also the liquor price is very cheap. Probably the cheapest in the market right now.

The fish is awesome. They use bhetki. One wouldn't be disappointed when they are looking for good fish items. Moreover the cost of drinks is lower as compared to others. And the ambiance is wonderful. A great place to hangout with friends and family.

Not really upto the mark. Had expected much better from this place.
Service is poor, the attendents are not punctual. Food is very ordinary. The best part being a good location. Though I was a bit surprised to find a bar inside a residential complex.
Not in my recommend list of places.

I was here at ashtami evening this year. I simply loved the place. The ambience are great. The food is reasonable. We had biriyani and fish butter masala as pointed by the manager about their specialty in fish!!! 
And the lassi was great as well.
I am going to rate this place as 4.
