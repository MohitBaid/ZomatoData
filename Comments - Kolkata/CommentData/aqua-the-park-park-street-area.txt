Went there on New year's eve to party. 


We ordered a few cocktails and nibbles.  The DJ was awesome and so was the overall experience.  


Definitely the place for a great pool party.

Aqua is among very few pool side seating options available in town. Food quality has been consistent though nothing extra ordinary but then decent enough to enjoy a pint of beer with the scrumptious chicken tikka. Heard that Sunday brunch is a good option one can look forward @Aqua

Tuesday 19th late night we came in here with a friend from outside since I have been here before and loved it. However this was a hellish experience. Never coming back here. They played such loud music from guests who booked for a bloody party. The staff suffered as well from the loud music but we're unable or unwilling to help. Poor service. Tip: hire some bloody bouncers

SHAME ON YOU AQUA
I always go to aqua because its my fav place.. I celebrated my 18 bdy there...
On 17 december 6.30pm i went to aqua with my frds..
The female manager said no you all are underage.. we said we are carrying our ids you can check it.. she said 22 allowed... I again requested her.. she said no and said please go to ott or whats in d name !! WHO IS SHE TO DECIDE WHERE SHOULD I GO..she acted rudely.. like she owns aqua.. 
i went to the park receiption he said why are they not allowing you wait let me make a call.. after disconnecting the call he said mam she is saying they not looking high profile and its her choice to choose whom to allow.. I asked him to call the manager he said he was in the meeting.. I came back still I will go back.. I DEMAND AN APOLOGY.. I CAN SHOW YOU MY PICTURES I WAS WELL DRESS .. I WAS WEARING A BLACK DRESS WITH BOOTS .. WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE US WHETHER WE ARE RICH OR POOR BY JUST SEEING US.. WE ALWAYS WENT ITS LIKE OUR HOME I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.. I AM SO LOYAL TO AQUA THAT I PREFER AQUA RATHER THAN ANY OTHER PLACE.. AQUA DOESNT ALLOW FREE FOOD WE PAY SO MUCH MONEY FOR THE AMBIENCE.. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE 
The fact that the restaurant is still coming out so strongly with their mindless opinions says a lot about the kind of culture they have and are happy to promote..

The prices are excessive in comparison to the quality and service. 
Ambience is pleasant. Not so high nor low. 
We had one glass of LIIT, one Corona and one nonveg platter. The charge you 4000 bucks for that. 
Not a recommendable place to visit.

This place was high on my list of places to go to in Kolkata but it was a great let down. The Sheesha is just average. The waiting time is long for not just the food to arrive but also for someone to attend to you. No co-ordination amongst the staff. One person takes your order and conveniently forgets. Then another person comes and takes your order and she has no idea of the previous order. I made a reservation but no one cares about it and has no record of it. It's a very mediocre joint to be run in such a reputed hotel. The food menu is minimal with very little variety. The hotel certainly needs more professional management for this lounge or needs to shut it. I am certainly not coming back here. Even when I called to make a reservation the front desk transferred the call thrice and no one was available to pick up the phone at Aqua. Finally I called the next day and got a reservation. The front desk lady also was frustrated with no one answering the phone at Aqua. The food is also mediocre. The masala papad is as hard as a stone.And all this mess with only 3 tables occupied. I can't imagine the service standard with full occupancy. Stay away coz there are better places.

The ambience is a major turn on. Nothing fancy in the menu though, slow service. The price is ridiculously expensive,but I guess, considering a five star lounge by the pool it is obvious. We had some beers,( Corona and Miller wasn't available.Again, really?!)a chicken tandoori pizza which was okayish. Perfect ambience for a lavish date though.

I‚Äôve heard a lot about this place and thought to give it a try. 
It is located on the first floor of The Park Hotel. I went there with my girl and It was a little difficult for us to find as it was our first visit. 
The place is pretty good and it has a very cozy vibe to it. 
We ordered Shisha, Charcoal non veg platter, Salad and beer. 
The salad was a little bit sour but still was better than the other places that we‚Äôve been. 
The non veg platter was good. Each and every item was amazing. 
The behaviour of the staffs was very friendly. 
All in all a good place to visit. 
The pocket pinch is bit on the higher side.

Aqua is one of those places where you can chill for hours just sitting by the pool.The ambience is the USP of Aqua.As you walk your way through the wooden path leading to the lounge ,the large glass panes on both sides give a grand feeling--perfect for beautiful moments captured in lenses.The pool is has seating arrangements in cubical form.Blue and white backdrop brings in a sense of serenity .We seated ourselves in the inner section as the cubicles were all occupied.The menu is not too extensive but has quite a few dishes packed with flavours.

We ordered a pan seared basa with Gondhoraj butter and bean salad.Pairing it with a Peppertini comprising of chili infused vodka.The pan seared basa is light ,flavourful with a lemon butter sauce served alongside.The bean salad and mashed potato lacked the punch of flavour needed to balance.The Peppertini on the other hand was a delight with just the right amount of chilli to hit your palette.The food needs a little improvement.Visit to dip.your feet in the pool and enjoy your hookah

Look n fill is not like a 5 star restraunt. .Zomato should update the price as it's double to that shown ...the table provided was just big enough for decoration,not for fooding..the person's attending was not aware of the things there itself in the menu..
The DJ was inattentive,lacked passion as most of the time music was on loop.

Been here a few times earlier. The tranquility of the place especially if your seated along the poolside is surreal. The dim ambience adds to the mysticism and the small seating cubicles make it all the more private if you're accompanying your loved ones/one. Food is of course excellent and the staff is quite courteous, something which you would surely expect in a 5star facility. Kudos to the team ... will visit more often....‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

I had the choco mud , whuch was pretty ok!

But the hookah is highly overpriced.. though in the menu card it shows 300, but it xtra includes 126 % of the 300 , which is too much!

Let's go step by step.
Ambience: 5 Star üåü outdoor seating with very comfortable sofas. Really like the cabins. The swimming pool is much of an attraction.
Food and Drinks: 3/5 the drinks were a bummer. Had ordered a Long island tea and a mocktail named fantastic four. The blend was not in sync.
Service: 2/5 the servers were clueless about the food that's served in the place. They were not aware if cheese garlic bread can be made without garlic or not. Lot of time was wasted in me asking for a specific dish, then they going to the chef to reconfirm the same and coming back to me with the answers.

Would definitely recommend this place to others but only for the ambience.
--------------
20.6.17-- I am right now sitting at Aqua. We were served a beer pitcher with glasses meant for LIT. And the worst part is that the place is infested with flies that are coming and sitting on the food. And the server had such attitude. Would give a 0/10 for hospitality. Pics attached. Would never ever recommend this place to anyone!!!

Aqua disappointed me in more ways than I had ever expected. When I visited this place last, it used to be one of the most hospitable places  with a fantastic ambience. But my visit this time around has completely changed my opinion. The hospitality here is 0/5. The staff at the valet parking have an attitude you would not like to face. They serve you like they are doing you a favour. At aqua the manager was no better. When you come to a hotel of this stature you expect much better service and at least courteous behaviour. Would suggest you to avoid this place if you're looking for a hospitable environment and a decently behaved staff.

Having a hookah beside the lawn and seating in your private arena is the the key to be at aqua.

A very top class place .

The waitresses are helpful here.

No entry restrictions. 

The price is not so strep.

A small issue is the pools other side is the gym of the park hotel so you have to see people working out over the pool .

The AQUA raises huge issues in my spirit that I cannot resolve! I've been swimming in this pool and seen it evolve into a fine place to take a dip. But as an avid swimmer I hate becoming the object of entertainment for casual visitors, and swimming and drinking don't mix well! Maybe Marylyn Monroe kept bikinis and Martinis by the pool, but that's Hollywood! On the other hand let me change roles to the pool voiyour typology! Yes, I love to sit by this pool and devour the AQUA breakfast! But then the pool is empty !

I have visited aqua on one evening for first time.The place is superb,very romantic,best place for couple,soothing environment,relaxing on sofa with loved ones beside the pool,you can feel the breeze of the pool.
It's located in The Park hotel,because of 5 star hotel so the price automatically will be high,its quite natural.
The place is good but the people who stays in this hotel,they do swimming at any time in the pool it could be a awkward feeling for those who have gone for dinner or spending some time.
The food they served is quite good but the quantity should be more as compare to price.
Okay I understand it's a 5 star hotel it ¬†should be expensive,but they served very ¬†less quantity food which i dislike. ¬†
The staffs are very well behaved.
They should extend their menu card (food options).
I ordered chicken chilly blast which was served in a small bowl , small pieces of chicken. taste was good but the quantity was not for two persons as compare to price,, the price was 495/-.
On the other hand in drinks i ordered Budweiser beer.,,first i wanted to give order Tuborg beer but they said tuborg beer wasn't available then i changed my mind.i didn't expect this from this 5 star hotel.¬†
Overall a good experience,i would say visit this place for chilling.
Thank you.

To start with, I have always loved the ambience of this place. On a Sunday evening I decided to visit this place with friends. And I am really really impressed with this place. The ambience of this place continues to be amazing. We ordered for a sheesha - which was definitely better than every other time we had it here. For drinks we ordered Tequila Sunrise. They had an offer going on wherein the cocktail pitchers came in for Rs 750. So it was quite a catch. The drink was however really good. We ordered for an Indian kebab platter and Pamesan parantha with sundried tomato chutney. The Kebabs we exceptionally good. I would like to mention the staff was extremely courteous and warm. I don't remember the last time I had gone somewhere and was treated so well.

The best thing about Aqua is that you can relax on the sofa beside the pool, take a hookah with some finger foods and spend hours with your loved ones. They offer some happy hour deals till 8 pm. Great if you can avail one. There are indoor seating arrangements too, preferred when the sun is out. However, the poolside charm is difficult to ignore during the evening. The seating spaces are separated from one another, ¬†so you get enough privacy.¬†

Service: Great!
Price: Okay...considering it is a 5 star property.

Highly Recommended!

A really amazing place to chill.. The seats by the pool offer a great view and the ambiance is just perfect for a date. We ordered a whisky sour and a LIIT and i have to say it's the strongest LIIT i have ever tasted..

This is a good place compared to the service standards at other similar places in Kolkata. Great ambiance but food tastes a bit average. It's good for corporate parties, a alcohol included outing with my 5  member team costed 30 K. Sheesha is good and variety of flavours are available. Highly recommended for a blast after a hard week

The best and the most popular poolside lounging spot is here in kolkata  . The two levels of alfresco sitting and the partioned private corners next to the shimmery lights spotting the pristine blue waters of the pool makes the set up so glamourous. Be it a romantic date , a leisure talk , crazy pool party or some discussion on business , the ambience is made to suit all.  I have been there quite a number of times mostly over hard drinks from their bar , the last time had a  hookah and the non veg pizza  which was  perfectly baked thin crust topped with oodles of stringy cheese and diced chicken , something i really would like to recommend.

Love the ambience of this place. The service is actually very slow unless you sit in front of the bar area. It's a good place to relax by the pool and chill with a beer or two, especially in winter. Hookah is not so wow. The cheese kulcha is my most fav and then the pizza! I suggest to go with time and patience not for a quick meal.

This place is located at The Park, Park Street Kolkata. I visited this place purely for the ambiance, especially the booth like seating along the poolside where you can enjoy a romantic evening with your loved ones. Or you can have fun with your friends if you are a Sheesha Lover.

They have a wide variety of drinks, appetizers but we were a bit disappointed as not everything on the menu was available. The rose cocktail (Sparklers) was truely delightful - would advice to try it without the sugar cube for better flavour.

Aqua is the ultimate place to relax after a night of revelry at Roxy or after a super hectic weekday. The ambience oozes calm and the cocktails hit the right spot everytime. Be it Cindrella, Pinacolada, Mojito or a fancy shot, the drinks never fail to impress. Food is underrated here but whatever I've sampled till date were super yum. The club sandwiches are stuffed properly with chicken chunks and bacon, dips are never bland and the fries retain their crunch. They make a mean pasta with delicious white sauce. Do not miss the Mississippi Mud Pie, it's pure salvation in  bowl üòä

Went up there on a Saturday for a shoot of ours for a pageant and ordered their chicken sandwich for snacks along with a ¬†mojito.Sandwich came in real hot and was well grilled with definite chunks of chicken.
Teamed up with french fries, they tasted like heaven, as we were hungry like anything.¬†
At the end of the day, the mojitos were bliss, amazing is a short word to describe it
We had a drizzle and the ambience was spot on, with the cosy sitting chairs and we even made it to the upper tier during our shoot and the views were amazing

Swimming pool outside the glass covered inner room was wow, plus the seating arrangement near the pool seamed so relaxing (although we haven't tried those).
Everything is cool except their charges. If u want to blow out your pocket then this is the place.

Always had a wish to visit this place. Yesterday it came true. It was raining and OMG the first we entered it was a view to die for. We got a small corner just in front of the pool. It didn't need any AC, honestly. I  loved everything about Aqua. We started with budwisers. But the worst thing was they only had 2 budwisers left. I mean c'on its a 5 star restaurant and you don't have budwiser, which is very sad. Anyway we still carried on with chivas regal they had 12 years old. Drinks were served with decent chezziers. We asked for a strong sisha and they made us the best, it lasted for 1.5 hours almost. And sisha was great very smooth and good to the throat. For food we ordered vegetarian aura pizza. It had potatoes, onion rings, capers. Toppings were all over, chesse everywhere, thin crust. All in all awesome one. Bill came of 3656/- which is pretty decent according to me. Everything was superb please have enough budwisers from next time.

When you are going in for a place within a renowned hotel. You expect a posh ambience and we got it. 
Nothing over the top, quaint and refreshing just how I liked it for a short drink and adda session in the morning. 
I ordered a JD with coke. Aqua never has happy hour so that drills a hole in your heart enroute pockets. 
The service staff weren't too hospitable as you would expect from a top notch star hotel. 
They informed us that using a DSLR is not allowed however a mobile camera is fine. Never heard anything more illogical and silly. 

Would I visit again?  Your treat :D

You will grow a beard after placing an order, it takes ages for them to serve. And hostesses are only interested in chit-chatting among them self had to get up to my set and walk up to them after waiting 10min for someone to take order. Seriously sad :(

I am a regular visitor of the park dining at THE ZEN and AQUA but the last visit has changed my impression of the park as a premium quality hotel .....I had visited Aqua on 14.12.2015 with my guests and ordered food and drinks but to my utter surprise there was hair in pasta served to us and we were equally appalled to see cockroaches moving freely in the cabanas........ I brought it to the notice of the person serving us and asked her to call the F & B manager she told me to wait......After half an hour Dushyant Tanwar ( bar executive 9051308485 ) came claiming to be the F & B manager and on my insistence he went away and again making us wait for another half an hour gautam singh ( assosiate director bars 9830635635 ) came claiming to be the F & B manager. .As our evening had already been ruined  with the quality of food ...the maintenance of the place and pathetic response from the staff we just wanted to exit the place asap. I am enclosing pictures and uploading a video as well and cannot express my disappointment in bringing my guests to your hotel.

Good ambience... cute outdoor booths... the television in each booth is a bit annoying and disturbing in my personal opinion because it distracts. So though its meant to re-instate luxury... i find that we could all do without it when out chatting with friends... pricing is as expected... very sweet pro active sporty service women... not very wine savvy.. but on the whole a great night chill out place.

Well Aqua is one place where its always a posh affair. The new look is something much appreciated.The cabanas not only provide you the luxury to chill in style also give you privacy from the group beside you. The pool is easily one of the best in town along with the jacuzzi which is a blessing in disguise. The bar is stacked up with real well and the staff well intuned serving in style. The lounge inside is nice place to chill also the lounge area above the bar is a perfect place for a big group to zone out.

Yes ,its on the expensive side as the crowd is posh and profilling is also done ,hookah and food is good. Coming to the music the DJ is real good with his music.¬†

Aqua is a perfect place to relax for after parties as its open 24x7 alongside the pool parties are one of the best in town.

Must visit during the pool party season.

Recently I went to kolkata for a short trip and in the process of deciding where to spend time with friends we agreed upon aqua. We sat next to the pool. Since there was a heavy downpour it made the ambience even better. The only drawback is when the people from the saloon stare at you. I didn't mind people swimming in the pool. Again it was raining so only one person used the pool while we were there. 
The sheesha was nice. We ordered a few drinks and fries. Can't complain about any of them. Though it is hard to call the waitresses since they can't see you. You have to walk out of the area and call them(if they are anywhere in sight that is)

The first of its kind pool side bars in Kolkata. Expensive, great seating arrangement, nice presentation. Given a chance would suggest the hotel to have a pool bar and some seating arrangement in the pool with table tops on the sides. It can be a great Saturday evening unique partying style in costume when most others are dressed up in their best for CLUBS. Haven't tasted snacks or anything to eat here. Have usually been for a couple drinks few times with friends. Some drinks are just way too expensive. 

Not been in the recent past so am not aware of the changes if any.

One of best lounges in the city being located at the Park Hotel also plays a very important part. Their ambience is the key which has a pool which is very refreshing in the evening. They also have huts for seating which is excellent for spending quality time in a lazy evening.

Nice airy lounge to chill for the night with some good sprits n cocktails...love to sit in one of the small tents....though now that they have made it into isolated cubicle doesn't suit the purpose for me anymore...LIT is one of the favourites n PPl should go there during matches where they show it on giant screen which makes it much more appealing for me...

Omg! !!!! The best place ,ambience wise I visited till date. Dining by a swimming pool is really a plus point this place have. They have cubicles by the side of the pool with a glass covered seating arrangements and even by the roof. But as it was raining we had to choose the glass covered area. We went bit early by 5.30 so most of the snacks items were not available so we ordered a chicken starter with some vodka and white rum. Slowly the actual taste of the ambience starts after 6 as the lighting of the day dims and aqua lighting starts. We ordered fish starter and 1 more chicken starter with 42nd street  (mocktail ). This was the best mocktail I have tasted till date. It s an awsome combination with whiskey and some flavoured drinks with a cherry on the top.  I ordered 2 of 42nd street. The price is on very higher side. Though it was a birthday treat by a friend

The service at Aqua has gone from bad to pathetic. A simple thing like tissue had to be asked for 4 times. The cheese toasties came after 45 minutes n was not hot plus it seemed they had an overdose of butter in the kitchen which ended up in my plate. Cheeselings with drinks served were spoilt. To end up the bill came in a form which was not readable n I had to wait for approx 15 min to get a version I could read. Staffs are rude and impolite. This place sucks big time..

Hats off to the guys who run this place... Each time i am back in d country, this is d first place i visit...and each time i go back with a renewed zeal to return....

hookah, pizza, mixed platter, cocktails.... All are terrific and everything comes together because of the service they provide... This is one of the very few places where the hookah is really close to what we get served in the middle east... infact  its an eye sore if you visit either of their counterparts in delhi or chennai where they need drastic improvements on the service front. 
Wish they could elaborate on the food menu which would definitely be a welcome move for patrons like us.

Well this is my first review on Zomato. I have finally decided to write a review as I felt it's worth writing for.

Well, I have been to Aqua last night and the ambience just set the mood right. It is one of the very few places where you can just go and relax.

I wouldn't say much about the drinks and starters as they were good. Also, there are other reviewers who knows better than me in this regard :-p

However, the reason I would recommend everyone to visit this place would be the "DJ". If you are into deep house, progressive house music then this is definitely the place to be.

The moment I entered DJ Kabir was at the console. Right from then he kept the momentum going and played some awesome and great tracks.

Honestly, DJ kabir is one of the finest in the business and knows his job well. I personally thank him for an amazing experience at "Aqua".

I will visit this place over and over again. For people who haven't been to Aqua yet please make it a point to go specially when DJ kabir is at the console :-)

Highly recommended ! Cheers !

If you want to go for a date, spend quality time or in a chill out mood and you have plenty of time to kill then this is the place, ambiance is excellent. Food wise nothing much to discover. Service is like if you are in College street coffee house because here also waiters never come to take your order. Even if you go to counter and order they take ages and few reminders to come back with your order!! Price: Better take your credit card instead of your wallet

A good place to continue after someplace else downstairs. The booze is expensive but the decor and the feel is great. Great for dates or if you want to just drink all night long. The wine collection isn't as expansive as advertised though. And there are obviously better places to eat.
PS: If you are adventurous enough, you can go for the midnight dip at the pool.

If you like open air, techno music, pool sides or complete relaxation, this is it. I'm talking about all that in a 5 Star Deluxe hotter in the heart of the city so?? The only condition is that you have to come prepared with a heavy stash in your back pocket. It ain't cheap.

Won't say much about the "cuisine" cause it ain't a restaurant. It's great however.

My fav used to be the Russian Vodka here but since I've switched to rum years back, this place doesn't go as per my taste anymore I'm more of a rock music buff.

Aqua has a great feel to it and I can assure you that just sitting and relaxing by the pool having anything you'd want would fix an evening rightly..

Aqua is a good destination for a lazy evening. The poolside bar has an amazing ambience that suites everyone and makes one feel very comfortable. Just take a glass of Aqua Fizz along with Stuffed Button Mushroom and the evening is set for relaxation and fun talks. Grilled Fish Tuna is also an amazing dish served at Aqua.

The perfect place to unwind after a wild night of partying in the city. The ambience is fabulous and lets you lose yourself in the serenity of the place. Specially if its a full moon night tge experience is enriched.  I love the tangy juice available here. They also serve alcohol so no problem if you have not finished on your quota while partying. The pool adds to the look and feel of the place.  However there is also a seating area inside where you can chill over some music and alcohol.

A friend's insistence led us to Aqua one fine evening in the last week of December. Seated deep inside The Park Hotel, the place offers poolside seating, and ordinary lounge seating. Arriving without reservation, we had to contend with the lounge seating to start off. We were a group of 5, and went for a mix of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The mocktails tasted pretty ordinary; the cocktails - slightly better. 

After an hour long wait, we did manage to get one of the poolside tables. However, the tables aren't really open tables, but rather small cabins with a table, a sofa, and a couple of chairs. The walls obstruct the view, and only a patch of the pool is visible. Moreover, watching people gymming on the other side of the pool isn't really one's idea of a nice view. 

We ordered a plate of chilli chicken, which arrived after an eternity. The taste wasn't great either; the road-side Chinese shops prepare better dishes at one-fifth the price. All in all, a pretty ordinary experience, considering our high expectations. The only consolation was the lady who entertained our incessant demand of clicking group photos.

This is one of the best place to visit in the whole city !
It starts with a breath taking view of a pool adjacent to the cabins and sitting area ! 
The lights are perfectly adjusted for a romantic evening or even for hangout with friends.
Moving on to the food and drinks , no doubt its quite expensive but the ambiance can compensate it! 
Food is above average .
Talking about the service it was good but have been better! 
The person who came to take the order was too much hurried to take it that sounded a bit irritating .
Overall a nice place to hangout and easy to empty your wallets .
Note:- drinks are over-expensive and not recommended for people going there for this specific purpose !

Possibly the best lounging by the pool side experience you will get here than anywhere in kolkata. Great cozy ambience, wont suggest a place where you can have candle night dinner as the others suggested rather a place where you can break a leg. Food is standard. Waiter and waitresses are cheerful and quite courteous. I somehow find this place to be very expensive when it comes to alcohol, perhaps the most expensive outlet in park hotel compared to the others. Overall you are missing if you have not been to Aqua.

Aqua is an upscale poolside lounge located in The Park, which is located in the heart of the city.

The walk from the reception to Aqua is quite long, and it passes many thin dimly lit passages. But once you reach there, the experience is totally different. There is an option to sit out by the pool or inside. 

The bar has a lot to offer with quite a lot of variety on the liquor. The food there is also really good, expecially loved the finger food there.

Loved the ambience of Aqua, with dim lighting and comfortable seating. The place has a cozy feel to it.

Hookah is also available and smoking is also allowed. The flavour options on the hookah isn't a lot.

Although the place is on the pricier side,  but all in all we had a really good time. 

Pocket pinch: 3000 to 3500 for 2 people.

One of my personal favourite . Have been there quite few times .This is an upscale poolside lounge amidst hotel Park . ¬†Excellent ambience , very good finger foods ( I tell u again , its pricy ) ¬†. They serves a wide variety of ¬†wine and other liquors . The cabanas , recliners and swings ¬†in the open air are really relaxing , though u can choose a shaded couch as well . I personally love the foot spa at aqua . Try their cocktails like drunken coconut ( a vodka based cocktail , my personal favourite ) , peach sangria and cucumber mojito . If u are on a date here opt for merlot or shiraz ¬†. Sherry is a good choice as appetiser ¬†. ¬†Finger foods are good undoubtedly ¬†, go for club sandwiches or burgers . Portions are really large . ¬† They are fine testing . Aqua serves hookah as well and smoking is allowed :) . The best time to visit aqua is after the sun set or late evening onwards ¬†. I personally have visited aqua even very late at night like 2 am as well ;) ( though mostly on 25 th or 31st decembers ) . ¬†In a nut shell its a real fine option for a date or hang out , though it costs a lot ( esp . If u wanna booze ) . I recommend aqua very much if cost is not an issue .

Costs 3500 onwards for two ( cant draw the upper limit ;) )

Set by the tranquil pool @ The Park is Aqua a place most would associate with a night out ... however what lies hugely undiscovered is the awesome Breakfast served up by Chef Arijit and his team. A great way to start your day and with the nip in the air the perfect place for a wonderful breakfast with both indoor and outdoor seating available. The Cheese Platter, Eggs Benedict (which were spot on) and Waffles with Poached Pears and Blueberry Compote and Freshly squeezed Orange Juice make for a fantastic start to one's day. 

It is also in my opinion one of the nicest places to chill out in the city for an evening out .... great ambiance and equally good food make this a place tailor made for a cosy get together with your gang or a date with your special someone. The privacy each seating area gives is awesome and if you feel like company just go hang out at the bar. Sip on their divine Mango Bellini or a Sangria and order the Cheese Board to kick-start your evening . If you get hungry I would suggest you choose from the Tramezzini Sandwich , Fried Fish , Galauti Sliders or my all time favorite the Parmesan Cheese Kulcha. 

With the nip in the air there are few better venues in the City of Joy and the best part is its equally great for daytime or nocturnal activities ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ambiance of Aqua springs quite a surprise ! Located in the heart of the city in the middle of the bustling Park Hotel its nothing like what you expected ! The perfect place to go with a small intimate group or your date ... the lounges and the cabanas by the poolside just enhance the relaxed and mellow mood .... topped up with good service of a wide array of cocktails and drinks and excellent finger food. They also have an indoor seating area for those who prefer it. Never eaten too much when I visit but one thing I always order if I am even slightly hungry are the Mini Cheese Kulchas or the Club sandwhich which is huge so unless you want to make a meal of it ask them to cut in into quarters and share it

Aqua is the poolside lounge housed on the 1st floor of The Park Hotel. It was on my wishlist for a long time and I chanced to land up here on a Sunday evening. 
The entrance to the lounge is through a long and narrow passage which is very very dimly lit. The open air pool is illuminated and the water looks electric blue which gives the whole place a very psychedelic feel. 

Seating is available by the pool as well as inside where the bar is located. My friend and I were seated at the bar which has 3-4 high bar stools. Interestingly smoking was allowed inside which is air conditioned. We had teachers and KF beer, so cannot comment on the food. Service was fast and the bar tender was quite friendly. There is no happy hours in Aqua but the bar tender informed us that Aqua hosts a pool party on Sundays with unlimited serving of alcohol. 
I was there for hardly 10-15 minutes but I really liked the place. Hope to come back soon for the pool party.

I've been to Aqua - The Park a couple of times with friends. For me Aqua has one of the best ambiance, the best time to visit Aqua is in the evening by the pool side, the seating is beautifully decorated and arranged with the subtle swing.. Personally i love their pool side seating but even their indoor seating is fab.
Their drinks, cocktails are impressive the food is average but do try out their thin crust pizzas..its really good.
Hookah's are pretty average compared to other places.The staff members are very friendly basically young people like us very pleasant.. But basically Aqua focus on the ambience, my experience is always great after the visit to Aqua-The Park

We visited this place while in Kolkatta in May, was a bit disappointed as there was nothing much happening.

The pool was closed and hardly anyone.

But we did have an ok time, having shisha and cocktails and also met a celebrity.

I think the pool party happens on certain date  and its not an everyday event.

I would still go back as the staff were very nice, and the DJ played our music requests.

The rating been only 2.5 due to the above but hoping at my next visit I will be able to give a higher rating.

Yes the best place to visit, really great atmosphere and crowd. Good management and food. Although never tried hookah here, and it's annoying when I don't get my fav corona here. The only con os that you will not get everything which's on the menu. Rest 5/5. Go with your friends and enjoy the evening.

its a simple lounge feel in Aqua cause thats what it is... the people there are very nice and keep you well served though they can be a little stretched on days this place is packed.... the feel of the place with the pool in front is just very good and days on which it is cold or raining or just rained this place is amazing to go to.... there is an indoor seating as well which we normally dont go to as we enjoy the outside chilling experience... 

be careful as the alcohol out here is a tad on the more expensive side compared to other places in Park itself... other than that this place is a perfect chill zone kinda feel...

they do have pool parties on Sunday afternoons... which is pretty good and different from other parties around town...

I am a regular at hotel Park. Aqua is definitely the coolest place to hangout and has good variety of drinks.. but the last time i went ws truly disappointing. You dont expect that at those rate u wud be served chilli chicker or chilli paneer so chilli that it wud burn the whole of your mouth. On telling them to correct it they served the same dish again ... 
Thank God for the cocktails to quench the burning and to save the grace!

Such things shud b taken care and such complaints shud b definitely addressed. Complaints like these disturb the PR.

The ambience is amazing in the evening. The drinks and the hookah will make your mood really good. Although it is a little pocket pinching but the place is worth the money. I really found the place amazing and you will surely have a great time by the pool. Apart from that you will surely find a good and classy crowd. The service by the staff is also good

One of my favorite chill-out spots in the city. The ambience and drinks are superb- the LIT is recommended:) and so is the baby naan with sun dried tomato and cheese. That ones sheer bliss.

Over-hyped, over-priced. This place really is all about it being situated in The Park, that's basically the only plus point. If you go in the afternoon, you won't get food other than club sandwiches and you sure as hell won't get any of the cocktails or sheesha. Because the bartender doesn't turn up before 6 pm, so what's the point of opening the lounge at 12 noon??!!! Service was pathetic. This place deserves a rating of zero.

Aqua has come up with a brand new look and menu recently, and I must say, it looks stunning! The poolside still has those lovely outdoor setting, but inside, the look has changed considerably. Among the food that we gorged upon, loved the creamy hummus with crisp lavash and pita bread, and the bacon wrapped dates were to die for, the combination of sweet dates with salty, crisp bacon an absolute winner. The white sangria was mild and fruity, and went down well with the grub.

There are times when i am tired or in need of a drink after the day to day robotic life and there are times when i am at Aqua !!!!!

Aqua is a day poolside lounge which becomes even more amazing post sunsets. Located in the Park Hotel, it is spread over quite some space with a small closed area and a big open chilling area around the pool. There are cabanas, recliners, comfortable swings located all around the pool. The lighting arrangements are very classy which give a top feel in the night. The music played can be a bit better though.

It has a limited fooding menu but an exquisite menu for drinks that contains wide variety of classical and contemporary international wines, shots, cocktails etc. Cocktails deserve a special mention which are prepared very well and can be customised to perfection. Hookahs are available and are obviously well made. The prices are decent considering its location. The staff are courteous, polite and pretty uptime. The bar is well equipped and stocked.

I think Aqua has very limited competitors in Kolkata in the poolside lounge segment and ranks top in my list for private parties and for unwinding myself over a few drinks particularly in winters. Fooding segment could be improved or rather expanded.

AQUA,situated at the heart of city,i.e.,park street,in park hotel is more of an ambience-centric place rather than a food-centric one....they do not have much option for those who are visiting it to get their stomach pleased,though they have a fine collection of wines and beers...previously i used to go there occasionally for a pint or two,just sitting by the pool and enjoying the ambience.A recent addition to their menu is shisha or hookah ...i went there yesterday and ordered the brain-freezer and it was 
smooth,which was exactly expected from a lounge of this stature...the club sandwiches and burgers are nothing extraordinary though they seem to be hailing from a different planet visually,all adorned with cherries and leaves....the prices are a bit steep for the pocket....its better to visit it after dusk.5 stars from me for the ambience,4.5 for the hookah and 3 stars for the food...overall,a 4 for aqua

Aqua - the Park - Reviewing this place is a ride in itself!

Like my previous reviews, I would categorize different aspects and share what I feel. So here we go:

Location -- Bang in the middle of Park Street, located at the "landmark" itself (The Park Hotel), and yet finding Aqua can be a challenge for first timers! Once you enter the path that leads to the hotel, you have to actually cross the gate for reception, and go straight towards the Car park, and towards the right is the huge door that leads you to the floor above where Aqua is located, again, with no prominent, obvious striking sign boards. 3/5 for location

The Ambiance -- Ideal time to visit Aqua would be in the evening, tables by the pool side, with beautifully decorated seating arrangements with subtle swings, Aqua can prove to be a good experience, provided you get the right table, else you might just end up sitting on one of the white chaise longues (Pronounced as Sheyz Lawngs), which people use to relax by the pool side. So depending on the seating your whole experience might vary ;)
However, Aqua does have an indoor seating arrangement as well. 4/5 for ambiance

Drinks -- Along with standard alcohol, some of the cocktails they have are impressive, but the thing with cocktails is that, the taste, to a great extent, depends on the bar tender. Unfortunately, my experience here wasn't too good at aqua. they did have the elaborate menu, and the taste was close, but a lil far from perfection

Staff -- Young pleasant staff. They do meet the expectation, but do not overwhelm. You get what you ask for without hassles

Food -- Fine tasting food. So much focus is on the ambiance, the experience and the pool that food is given little importance when you go to aqua, though for a foodie like me, its an important important aspect. Food is a 3.5/5

Another thing with Aqua is that since it is a part of the Park Hotel, you never know when to visit, since the place might have been let out to a private party and you might end up being in the middle of a crowd that you never expected to.

Aqua, deserves a 3.5 as far as I am concerned.

The place is really really costly and not worth the buck. The pool side ambience is good however the hot and humid weather in Kolkata does not make it great to sit by the pool and eventually you would end up sitting in the air conditioned section. The service staff is okay and not great. With the price these guys charge, at least the staff could have been more courteous and presentable. I have been here only once and have never went back again.

Was craving a good dirty martini and heard Park was the place to go, was horrible disappointed. I'm not even sure what the drink was that they brought me but after sending it back twice I just gave up. Tasted watered down and slightly sweet. Yuck. Will not be returning.

Its a class, amazing place to hop in and spend time, covered as well as open space. For all ages the service starts with female stewarts. Drinks are the major players, whereas sheeshas just survive over the high price tags. Food is good, its the ambience which brings it to limelight with a swimming pool on the puffing deck. 

the glitch which takes off the glamour is they serve hookah only after 6:30 pm.

Went to Aqua yesterday to have a small celebration for my brother's birthday. It was a disaster. ambience is just about okay. music was good. service was appalling with our starters coming in after 55 mins. hookah was decent but way too overpriced. they provided a nice cake, complimentary. The non veg platter was delicious.the staff needs to understand the concept of warmth and 'service with a smile'. GOD were they cold! the place needs a better lighting design, and some warmth from the staff.. yet the worst part was the billing; we were wrongly billed with two extra drinks, a can of red bull, and two aereated beverages. wtf!? they did correct it.. but were they dreaming while billing us? NEVER AGAIN.

Aqua is a place which is over priced, with border line ambience & not too great service. I had heard it is a pool side restra which serves hookah as well. Much to my dismay when I visited it I found it wanting on many grounds. The ambience is strictly ok, the waitress all small girls with mini skirts are uninformed and the hookah served was highly priced and had to be changed twice. I bet I can make a better one at one.
All in all after the disastrous start I restrained from ordering anything and came out with the right pocket empty..
