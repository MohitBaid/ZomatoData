Went in this joint with couple of office colleagues as we were in this area. We ordered Veg Fried Rice, Chilly Chicken & Hot & Sweet Chicken Soup. Fried rice was good. Chilly chicken was like made out of vinegar. Very sour but chicken was soft. Worst was hot & sour chicken soup. It was so hot that I had to stuff my stomach with water & mouth with sauff! I'll definitely avoid this joint in future. Recommendation: NO

North indian items are not good here but chinese dishes are good in terms of both quality and quantity.
Waiters here are not that professional. But importantly if you come by car then parking is not available for them.

What a pathetic place. This place is located in an extremely crowded place so parking is a headache. Its on the 2nd floor with no lift which make the place in accessable for aged people. Now let's come to the food. Trust me I havent had such a bad experience anywhere in Kolkata. We ordered a sweet corn soup. The soup didn't taste like a sweet corn soup not even close and really had to struggle to find a corn. Now the worst part is we ordered a plate of steamed momo. They served chilled momos straight from the refrigerator. When I complained the about it they put the entire plate in a microwave and replied that they make momos in the morning and serve the same all day long. Stirctly avoid this place a much as possible. Only one thing I liked was their ice creams which was nice.

Good food. Reasonable price. You cannot get the same taste of biriyani like normal biriyani, but it is healthy for your health as they may not given any colour in biriyani. All other chicken dishes is good. In their street food corner we can get delicious different type of rolls.

Food is ok, nothing notable as such. Price is comparatively higher according to the quality. Its better for a laid back evening when you r not looking for a quality meal rather a place to sit and chit chat.

This shop is located opposite to Rajpur Bazzar. It is one and only standard restaurant around this area or nearby. I have been here often as it is close to house. I mostly take away food from here. They also have sitting arrangements with both AC and Non-AC facility. AC one is far better than Non-AC one.

Food quality have improved over time. Their Fish Fry is very tasty and mouth watering. It is a must try! The kebabs (Reshmi / Tandoori) are also delicious. Along with those, few other recommendations will be Chicken Butter Masala, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Manchurian. As food quality have improved, the cost has also risen but it's reasonable.  This restaurant is a saviour around this area for food lovers.

This is the only standard eatery in Rajpur. I have been packing my food from this place since a long time but never dined inside. I have always liked their Indo- Chinese items. One definitely cannot compare it with other posh restaurants in terms of quality. But the taste is much better compared to many other restaurants of the same price range. Surprisingly they add costly veggies like broccoli, baby corn, red and yellow bell pepper in the fried rice which we can hardly expect from a restaurant of this stature. I have mostly taken Manchurian chicken. The tangy gravy ( though not original Manchurian version) is really tasty. The boneless chicken pieces are big enough. But their North Indian food could not satisfy my sensitive taste buds.

As this it the only restaurant in this area(RAJPUR) I have given that 1.5 star. Apart from this nothing is good with this place. 
Location:- located near rajpur phari opposite to rajpur bazaar. Take away and the non ac restaurant on the ground floor and the ac restaurant on the 2nd floor.
There is no lift to go on the 2nd floor so you will have to take stairs,this is really disappointing.
Now coming to the food, all the side dishes which we have ordered was almost identical made with same curry. Rice was not hot. Biriyani was made with regular rice.

Not value for money all the prices was too high for this place atleast.

Only the interior was good.
Note:- if you go there with your four Wheeler you will have to park it 2km away from the restaurant because it is located in a heavily congested area.

আজ দুপুরে খেলাম কিন্তু আগের রান্না নেই. বিরিয়ানি মুড়ির মত লাগছে , মটন ............ সেওতো শুকনো গাছের ছাল এর মতো. ভিতর কলকাতার মতো করলেই হবে না রান্না রুচি সমত হওয়া উচিত.

This is one of the most pocket-friendly restaurants in town. Food quality is ok, not bad actually. Specially, the mixed fried rice should have a mention. Kashmiri Pulao is also nice. What I found creepy was the light, if there was any, of course. They interior decor could have looked nice if there was sufficient light to see it.

Truely speaking neither ambience nor the food was good. Biriyani was cold. No value for money. Staffs are so casual in attitude. Not recomended to anyone.

To be honest, price wise what "Tandoor House" is for Southern Avenue people this place is nearly the same for people who stay nearby Narendrapur and around Harivani, Malancha. :D Service is good and rates are pretty reasonable. This is the best place to order food from when i have a night out with friends. Though its a bit oily but looking at the price range you can't complain either. I hope they improve their service a bit and delivery should be extended till ATLAS MORE. 
Mostly i take back home their Tandoori and kebabs. Hope to visit soon again.

I have been there few times. Not worth the effort. Really bad food and bad service. I remember one time i ordered paneer matar, and they used the same gravy as a fish curry. Disgusting, and you don't get your own table. Thumbs down

Overall good but the quality of the food has declined. Once I was vomiting after trying Red Wine Chicken. The AC counter is good. Peacefull ambience. They take a lot of time after giving order. So if you r too hungry avoid sitting inside. Instead take from parcel counter outside.
There r a lot of menus but many are not available and others require a preorder. Overall a place for students if you want to hang out long time.

As per my knowledge it is the oldest restro in locality n the golden days r gone. Now they r very normal below average food point in all respect and just becoming a vater hotel who serves some so called Chinese or moghlai dishes from which only rolls r better.
