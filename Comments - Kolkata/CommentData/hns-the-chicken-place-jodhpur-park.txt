This place is right below my house :D the first experience here was amazing. I couldn't put the burger down. The owners recommended me to take a Chicken Double Decker the next time around, but for me the next experience was devastating. The chicken patty was reeking of oil and there wasn't much chicken in it!!! I couldn't eat it. 

I gave the place a 3.5/5 because of my first good experience.

Even full marks will be very less. The person (owner) Mr Hardeep Singh is decent & humble to the customers. Coming to the food quality & quantity, all I'm saying is after having the chicken items from this place, KFC just sucks !!! Be it the chicken breast fry or chicken strips or chicken double decker this place is a very unique and pocket friendly amongst the college goers.
