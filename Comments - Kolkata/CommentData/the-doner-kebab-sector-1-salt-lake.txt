Located at the entrance of City Centre-1. Service is good. Food is average. They put a lot of thick cream in the dishes. Quantity is good enough for one person.

So i was with my siblings in city centre1 and saw this stall with the word "TURKISH FOOD" and the words looked different and attracted me to try their delicacy..
Theri menu is basically a mix match of turkish kebab stuffed in wraps, sandwich, burgers, salad and especially "BOWL", when i highlight the word (bowl) means this is a must try here.. 😋😋😋
This place serves all this delicacies for vegetarian also..😊
Food is really flavourful, fresh and tastefull and quantity is ok with the price.
We ordered the following:
1) Chicken salad with fries. "120 INR" ( Again i would suggest you all to order this with pita bread so that u can stuff the salad into it and have)
2) Chicken bowl "95 INR" ( a must try its an edible bowl made of wheat/bread stuffed inside is turkish kebab tossed with lots of vegetables, cheese and flavourful spices) A big YUM YUM YUM 😋😋😋 
Quiet reasonable👍😊
