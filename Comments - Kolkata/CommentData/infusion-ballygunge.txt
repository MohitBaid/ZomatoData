Enjoyed the food so much the first time that I could not wait to order again! Infusion not only promises food that will tease all your senses but also delivers the same with quality of the best kind. With such a diverse variety of cuisines, it definitely leaves me craving for more. It is unimaginable how all of this can be simply made at home!

Great Chinese food! Flavours were distinct, mouthwatering and well crafted. Also made the choice to try Crepes, which were phenomenal. What is even greater is the fact that everything is home made and of very good quality! Would definitely recommend to everyone!
