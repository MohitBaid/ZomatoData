A regular sweet shop like one may find elsewhere. Tried the Samosa and Roshogolla here. Basic stuffs, just manages to satisfy your hunger. Nothing special!

Very old looking sweet shop. It was very small and not so clean. Limited number of sweets and snacks which tastes good. Hospitality and ambitious was normal. Service was good. All the sweets and snacks were pocket friendly and money realized. I liked their rossogulla most they were big in size, spongy, light and very delicious. Good experience here.

There are some places that cant be critiqued as they are pore elements of nostalgia. As a child i have eaten Singhara from this shop almost every single day . This review is specifically for the sheer nostalgia that i have for this shop . My mama-bari ( maternal uncles's house) is a stone throw away from this place and we go all the way from salt lake to eat joy guru samosa . The crust is thin and crisp and the potato filling inside is not too spicy but sweet with peanuts in them. I have been eating them for almost 3 decades. My relatives from abroad freeze these and take them with them when they travel back . 

Joy guru is a shop that's a simple bengali mishti shop . They also make awesome boondi and kalo jams . I also love the kora pak gur sandesh during winter. 

I cant explain how nice if feels to see this listing on zomato. Thank You. My childhood memories are fresh as i write this review.
