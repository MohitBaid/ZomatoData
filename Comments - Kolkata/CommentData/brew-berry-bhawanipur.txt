A nice quiet cafe in Bhowanipore. More near to Paddapukur and Netaji Subhas metro station. A left from the Netaji statue in Jadubazar on if taking the metro route. 
Cafe Bar is the perfect name to describe this place as it's high on caffeine. Serves a number of quick dishes and delicious pizzas with decent toppings. 
Pasta and Pizza are one of the best things of this place.

*A group or 2-4 can enjoy nicely with a budget of 500 or 600 with 100-150 per head. That's basically cheap than many other places.*

The cafe got a quote little chamber in the middle where you can enjoy a bit of privacy and comfortable conversations as it's a small coup. Music instruments are allowed as guitar or mouth organs which will suit the ambience.

Only con- the place might get a bit crowded and few items might not be available for serving.

This cafe is next to Vidyanjali school. Just a small room nothing so attractive. The menu is just a few printouts stapled together. The menu and prices are different than what shown here. We had cheese garlic bread and mix sauce pasta. It took around 15 mins for the food to arrive. The garlic bread was just some toast, could have been better. Pasta was average. Nothing so impressive.

Today wasn't the first time I had been to this place, but the experience I had today was horrible. I was with a friend for hardly half an hour. We had ordered fries. When we asked for the bill, the owner told us, please make a bill for a minimum amount of 150, since you were sitting her since the past one hour. When we asked the waiter and some other guests, they told him that we were there for just half an hour. We told him we would pay him 150, no matter what the bill would say, but he had issues even then. When we told him that he should have previously told us that you have to have a minimum billing, he started talking about how other places in bhawanipore have shut down and how GST might make him shut down etc etc. 
It was a very pathetic experience, and I would never recommend anyone to go there. There are a lot of better cafe's around Bhawanipore.

A very pathetic experience at Brew-Berry.
Being from the same area I visited this place today and ordered a french fries. Had it and asked for the check. While paying owner told me that the bill amount is very less i.e. Rs. 108. He told next time don't bill for this less amount minimum should be Rs 150-200. Then i asked him, why? Neither there is a board written that there should be a minimum billing amout nor your person informed me the same. Then he had no comback so he told me that you can't sit in a place for 1 hour and just order one thing. This pissed me off that how can a owner tell a customer this?? I asked one of the customers sitting there and the Stewart who served us and even they confirmed that we came just 25-30 mins back. 
Then the owner started giving example of other food joints near by that the have closed down because they were running in a loss and other excuses.  I would like to tell that if you have a fear of getting your shop closed why are you accusing the customers if you are not able to run your shop its your mistake not customers. If you are not getting customers its your mistake not customers. He also started explaining us the whole GST thing that now there will be this much tax and so.
Bro, I don't care.
I am from bhawanipur and I wouldn't suggest anyone to visit this place but yes do visit and meet the owner if you want to know more about GST. He wouldn't mind explaining it. Not visiting this place and not even suggesting anyone to visit this place to my closed and dear ones. You have better places nearby Elgin and Sarat Bose Road than visit this place. I wouldn't have given 1 star also but thats the minimum to give. So here you go sir, my review.

I am not coming here for the first time today but I've been a pretty frequent customer. But the service that I received today is slower than one can even imagine and the quality of the American slider was also bad. We asked them to do something about it but the Stewart simply walked away without saying anything. Neither gave me a discount in the bill nor did he replace the dish.

Located in the lane adjacent to ram mohan dutta lane ( close to fast filling lane), brewberry is the flagship store of the Indian coffee chain in the city.
The cafe is pretty small accommodating 6-7 tables. The interiors need revamping because those graphics are passe! The menu variations are good for a cafe.
Tried their hazulnut shake, chocolate shake and the country pizza. 
Honestly a chocolate shake is something you can't go wrong with, but they did- making it very sweet.
The hazelnut shake was decent. 
The pizza was made on the local pizza base but tasted okay.
The ambiance is very disappointing honestly!
Service was good but the constant noise from the machines (from the open kitchen) doesn't let you talk!
They house mother dairy ice creams and they are drool worthy!

Pretty much a miss from my side.

The location is a little difficult to find but if you travel in that area then it is easy. The interiors were good and the atmosphere as well. Coming on to food, i ordered pasta and manchow soup. If you will have manchow soup for the first time at this venue then you will start hating the dish it was that yak! Pasta was up to the mark. Hence if you are a food lover then it is not the place but if you want to spend quality time with the person you love you can go for it cause their is less disturbance üòâüòÇ

Located near Northern Park, this place is a 10 minute walk from Forum. Amidst a range of fast food joints, this is a small cafe that has a different decor and a comfy ambience. With an all vegetarian menu, they serve delicious food. The cold coffees, especially the Tall and Dark, is a must try. Nothing great about Nachos. The cheese burst pizza, however, is a delight to the taste buds. Affordable prices, Good ambience and a wide range of food items. A revisit is my cards. Soon. :)

This place is located in bhawanipur near to northern park. Well this place is not too eye catchy it's a small cafe to hangout with indoor games. I visited this place many times and tried their many dishes like cheese burst pizza, french fries, chilly baby corn, desi grill sandwich but sadly none of them satisfied me although the place is not pocket pinch but  won't add much to your taste. I also tried their choco frappe, browine stax, tall and dark which is only thing i like here. i can say they serve the best coffee and brewtastic. Staffs are very friendly and music of this cafe would really make your day. If you are looking place in bhawanipur for small hangout you can try out this place.

Location: Near Northern Park.

Brewberrys is a small hangout joint that you can visit to spend some quality time with friends. I had visited this place some months ago with my friends and had loads of fun. The interiors are done up pretty well, however may lack attractiveness in comparison to other modern day cafes. The sitting arrangements is also well organized, easy to accommodate a group of 6.

Coming to the food, we had ordered Mix Sauce Pasta‚Ä¶really well prepared. Also ordered Cheese Maggi which was appetizing. Nachos were also good and crisp.

The pocket pinch is also at the lower end, so you wont have to think twice before placing the order. They also provide you with some board and card games to make your experience a little more enjoyable.

My rating of 3.5 could have been more but just for an item mentioned below:
One of the very few pure vegetarian cafe in town, Nice cosy place, lot of warmth exuding from the colourful walls and good lighting...situated diagonally opposite Northern Park. The order was as follows :
French fries favourite - Crisp, perfectly fried, wholesome quantity, 5/5
Cappuccino - near perfect, aroma was superb & strong and I kept inhaling the aroma for quite some time. Taste was very good, 4.5/5
Classic Veg Burger - This was a bit disappointment, too much better on the top makes eating and presentation look bad. Even the overall taste was just OK, 2.5/5
Pocket pinch: Rs 293 for the above mentioned order.
Summary : The overall experience was good, staff was very courteous, easy on pocket for your everyday craving of going to a cafe.
Suggestion: 1. Ask for customers preference before putting lots of unwanted butter/calories on any item.
2. Seating can be changed to give more leg room while sitting, a cafe is a place to chillax. Was feeling cramped for sometime.

Located nearby forum mall, a medium sized joint with adorable interiors and elegant decor. The ambience is lively and refreshing as well. A complete vegetarian cafe, offering a wide range of beverages, smoothies, shakes, mocktails etc;(cappuccino, latt√©, frappe, tea, mojito, shakes) and delightful savories like pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, maggii, cheesecakes, pastries etc. The quality of their offerings are perfect and mouth watering in taste. The prices are also in the reasonable side. Bottom line, a cool and soothing place to hangout with friends and enjoy succumbing savories in a minor pocket pinch.

It is a tiny cafe from the outside, like the many others that have mushroomed in and around the city. Tucked quaintly on Allenby Road, it is easy to miss, unless you are dying for a cup of steaming coffee while you are stranded in the area, like I was. But it is actually not so small on the inside, they can accommodate about 45 people comfortably. There is a common area, and a clearly demarcated private area. Ahem! A cool getaway for youngish, truant lovers. The decor is simple, bordering on kitschy. While a guitar hangs on the wall! There are crystal 'purdahs' a la Turkish joints, but then they were playing country music. So quite a medley I would say. But quite peaceful (maybe because I was here at 11 in the morning on a Saturday).
The staff was all of 2 boys, but they were kind and courteous. I ordered cappuccino which was quite decent. I sat for a while as I was waiting for something interesting to turn up, so I ordered another strawberry shake (it was highly recommended by the 2 boys), and it did not disappoint me - reasonably good - creamy, sweet as I like and sinfully pink. It sure made me happy. And the pocket pinch was low, I paid only 170 bucks for the Saturday morning cheer!

This is a small food joint located diagonally opposite to Northern park. 
Visited for a quick bite and found it to be great for the first impression. 

Straight to the point, 

Nachos 
Tasted great with the cheese load. 

Chocolate shake 
Nothing so unique about it, tasted great as it should be. 

Prices were pocket friendly. 

Overall a good experience. :-)

Brewberry located is less than 250 meters distance from my home.. So finally got the chance of visiting the cafe. 

Location:  In case any one is friendly with the nearby areas of Forum, Elgin Road you can reach the place. In case someone is not, take the road straight from the main gate of Forum and within 5 minutes of walking (after crossing Norther Park, you find the place on left side).

Now days cafe are coming with the concept of only vegetarian.. Visited the place on 26.10.2013 in the evening.  Since my partner wanted to have pizza and i was not in mood for travelling anywhere, we chose this place.

Entered around 8.15 pm on Saturday evening; First thing notice: Entire cafe empty. Confusion happened while choosing a table,  the staff helped and showed us a small cubicle where finally sat...  Asking them for a glass of water, they said that they have Bottled Water since they don't serve water 

Ambiance for the cafe: Bollywood music was being played and all romantic songs adding more spark for our evening...

we ordered the following items:

Smiles (Jain) - The staff really needs to understand the word "Jain" in case something is ordered.. It was not effective for us but still the impression matters. The smiles had potato stuffing which i was expecting wont be (since Jain was ordered)  but still they had.. We received seven pieces of smiles... One of them was little uncooked.. Probably they have the packets of McCain one where they had to be fried and served (since the taste was same).. They didn't garnish it with pinch of chaat masala or some spices for making it flavor some or nor asking... They served it with tomato ketchup (The ketchup was Jain)

Red Sauce Pasta (Jain): Only three options available (Red, White and Mix).. Inquired them about which pasta they have (Penne, Fussili, Spaghetti etc), response - don't know.. They got us the pasta and showed us physically the one they have available.. Told them to make it spicy which they did not... Pasta was overloaded with sauce and capsicum, capsicum dominated all the vegetables... Quantity was sufficient for two.

Country Pizza (Jain): Received 6 slices of pizza... Corn, tomatoes, capsicum were there in the pizza with cheese grated over the top... One slice of my partner pizza was little hard apart the rest.. It tasted well where the vegetables were proportionately added in the pizza... Ketchup was served along with chilly flakes and oregano's.. It was better than the pasta served...  Quite sufficient quantity.

Drinks: Tall n Dark - As the staff recommended that it was their specialty drink; so tried it out... It was blended with chocolate and coffee with ice-cream on the top (Cream was not there).. It was good neither too sweet nor too sour.. Tasted well.. Coffee was well mixed with the chocolate and milk... 

Service: Very slow service and worst part is in case we need something, we had to go to the counter and when we went there, no one was there... 

The total bill came to 520 rupees (including tip and taxes) which was not so worth it...

We were passing by this cafe today, on our way to Forum for a movie. We had an hour to spare so the four of us walked in. It was a pleasant ambiance with nice music playing in the background. I also noticed several tables vacant. At first we couldn't spot a table where the four of us could be accommodated. As we stepped  in further, the waiters helpfully leaded us to a cubicle in the corner. Apparently it was designed for couple's who look for a little privacy. 

We didn't have any big plans. Keeping in mind, that it was a vegetarian cafe we just ordered coffees or ice creams for each of us. I must say, it took really long for them to prepare. But the wait was worth it; both in the aspects of price & quality. Service was pretty impressive. The concept of board games is also something innovative! This does compensate on the waiting time in my opinion. Complementary Wifi was also an useful service provided by the cafe. 

Just hope they quicken their service a little. This is where it looses a star. The concept of serving only vegetarian didn't please me a lot since I am less fond of veg delights, regardless of how well its prepared. So in overall this brings down my rating to a descent '3.5'.

Otherwise absolutely satisfied. Very economical also, I must also say! If you have any plans in Elgin Road then you must hit this place. Its totally worth people!

A veg cafe sounds pretty odd but for a locality like northern park its a big plus given that 80% of the locality belongs to veg people. The ambience was ok not so spacious and they have an enclosure sort thing for 5-6 people. The menu looked pretty nice and we ordered a plate of nachos and two jumbo cheese burger. The nachos were really tasty and the sour cream dip was pretty savoury. The burger was ok with good helping of butter and cheese and worth the 100 something buck in terms of portion size. The frappes were ok not too great. But then again the place is veg which kind of is a deal breaker to me. The worst thing that is a problem out there is they play really crappy songs and the staff is pretty sleepy. It does get to your nerves when you have to listen to a whole album of Himesh Reshammiya. All in all an ok place to hang which the vegetarians will enjoy but the non-vegs which leave wanting for more.

Realised such a place existed after getting a Voucher from Zomato. If you're using public transport you'll need to walk quite a bit and ask a few people to reach this place. We went around 2, the place was empty. We ordered coffee and a mojito - the service was a slow, coffee was normal - nothing great( CCD serves better coffee). Overall, the place looks nice. I do hope they get some new CDs to play instead of playing the same trashy song in a loop and make this place non-veg. I don't quite get the idea of an only vegetarian cafe.

Got a voucher for this place and went in with a couple of friends. First things first, the place is not very easily accessible but we can look beyond that. We went in when the place was absolutely empty. Didn't like the first impressions of flies hovering around. The place is okay in terms of ambience, and not cramped for space in terms of a coffee shop. The coffees were decent, nothing special and the mojito was again okay. Service is very slow for a cafe, and that's a negative. I don't like cafes where I have to pay a service tax, you can do away with it and we can self serve gladly.  I also don't like the idea of a Veg cafe, I absolutely don't. Also, they keep playing the same song over and over every 15 minutes. I won't probably go back here, if not for another voucher.

d decor,music n seating is good. d food n drinks r oh so yummy. I chose white sauce pasta wid brownie stack. d pasta was super creamy n tasted a lil tangy which I liked a lot. the shake was amazing,more of brownie n less of coffee. 
will visit more often as d pricing is also apt to suit the pocket.

man i had a such a treat in finding this joint the direction said opposite forum elgin but no way is this joint next to it u have walk a good 1km inside to northern park. so in terms of location this places sucks. come to the restaurant find its self service this again is not accepted these days people look for hospitality. i had ordered a jumbo biurger , french fries, mango frappe and a black forest. the cake deco was good but since it is a pure veg joint so i presume no egg was used in the cake. then i had the burger which found needs to ne cut and served its difficult to extend ur jaws to eat the burger thats another flaw. french fries were just like the ordinary not much to say in terms of quality as its all the same. deco was pretty ordinary lacks the show of a fast food cafe.. one thing that was impressive was a library at the entrance and scrabble board thats something innovative. service needs to be more professional. price economical.

Dig in to Brewberrys' Sizzling Brownies!
3 out of 5

Today, I am really happy to review a nice cafe which is close to my place but one I had never visited before or noticed earlier. I am talking about Brewberrys located close to Elgin Road, near Northern Park. This is the only problem with this place - its location. If you are not very familiar with the area, it is quite difficult to find this place and that probably why I never visited this wonderful cafeteria earlier.

Brewberrys is a typical vegetarian cafeteria with the interior decor and ambience resembling a western cafe. A guitar hangs on the wall, a book case displays a number of books on various topics you can read here, there are animated paintings on the wall; overall, the ambience is cool and goes well with a cafe. Like other modern cafes, there are a lot of options to try, among which I went in for a Hazelnut Shake and Sizzling Brownie with vanilla ice cream topping dipped in choco sauce (the topping idea was given by the staff), whereas my friend (who loves spicy treats) went in for a Mexican Burger along with The Dark Horse Mojito. Among these 4 items, the Sizzling Brownie was the most tempting and will surely leave you asking for more - creamy and yummy to taste. The super soft hot brownies are arranged in pieces one on top of the other topped by a scoop of vanilla dipped in a generous helping of dark brown choco sauce - can't really go wrong here. 

It was good enough to influence my friend to order one more. The drinks, the hazelnut shake and mojito were also very refreshing. The burger was also tasty, especially the homogeneous distribution of jalapenos and salsa added real flavor to this big bite snack. I will soon be back to taste some other items but my obvious favourite here is their Sizzling Brownie with ice-cream. 

Forgot to mention one thing - the rates. The rates are very pocket friendly and relatively cheaper when compared to many other cafes that have cropped out in recent years across the city.

I usually do not get into a cafe specially which does not serve non-veg foods. But last weekend my friend took me to brewberrys as both of us were very thirsty.
I love frappes and so without watching the menu card I ordered one blue lagoon for me and trust me, that was heaven. The ambiance of this cafe is super cool. It had a guitar also :)
We then had pizza which was not so bad as I do not like veg foods. After that the waiter suggested an item which was "tall and dark". It was seriously amazing. A dark mixing of coffee and chocolate  ice-cream, topped with gallons of chocolate sauce which is toooooooooooo yummyyy... :) 
I beg to brewberrys to turn it to a non veg restaurant as soon as possible as I want to come here frequently.

Brewberrys is located opp Northern Park and is a difficult to locate if you haven't seen the map properly. The ambiance here is average. However the same cannot be said about the food. We tried the New York Cheese Burger, Masala Fries and the Brownie Stax. 
The Burger was tasty with a very fresh feel about it. The island sauce gave it a good tang. The Masala fries were sprinkled with a chatpata masala that I liked. What really impressed me was the taste of coffee in the Brownie Stax. This was the best coffee I had in a while. The brownie and ice creams were blended well with the coffee which gave the beverage a really yummy taste. The pricing is the big USP of this place. Its Self Service but the staff was attentive to our demands. Overall a very nice experience. Would visit again surely. 4 stars for Brewberrys.

This one is almost next to my house but I went here today for the first time. To start it isn't that bad though from outside it is not that attractive. The coffees are ok but cold ones better than the hot ones I feel. I haven't tried the other sections so can't really comment. But the biggest drawback is it is only vegetarian. How sad I hard core non-vegetarian like me can never visit this place frequently. The ambience is ordinary but small. Well if you a pure vegetarian then this one isn't a bad option. 
Well I'l rate it 3 since the meal was ordinary and pure vegetarian food can't satisfy me.

A good cafe located opposite of Northern Park(not exactly opposite of the park). Ambience is calm and well done, really attracting for teenagers. The cookiechino was really good. Garlic Bread and Go Green Pizza is my favourites here. Staff is friendly. Prices are affordable. Food quality is overall pleasant.
Its absolutely a vegeterian cafe. 
I would rate 4.0 for BREWBERRY.

Food= Unusually tasty, considering its pure veg..New York Cheese Burger  & nachos were gr8..But i expected d cheese burst pizza to have melt-in-your-mouth cheese gushing out..

Coffee= Hands down winner when u compare it to ccd/coffe world...Undoubtedly the best hazel frappe I have ever had...Brewtastics section is good too,esp the "tall & dark"... 

Ambience= Hip n happening...Not suitable for a large group...theres an alcove wich is a cool idea....A small collection of books & games are present...Only shop to have a game for two people,which is not Uno,its monopoly... Overall, the ambience gave me an international feel.

Timings= Shop is open from 11am-11pm...& u can sit there all u want...

Price= Their biggest draw is that prices r totally affordable...Rs500 is more than enoough for two.

A great place i would love to visit again and will do so very shortly...

P.S. I only wish they open a(some) bigger outlet(s) in kolkata... :)

P.S. Check out the address b4 visitin...takes a teeny weeny effort to find out...Get to northern park near forum,its bang opposite.

This place has a very good ambiance and a nice warm feeling about it.  You always feel welcome here in terms of being comfortable. It is a nice walk-in-for-a-quick-bite place. However, the food and service is not close to perfect. I ordered for a cheese burst pizza and unfortunately the cheese stuffed inside was mozzarella which required a great deal of chewing before it could make its way down my throat. The pizza tasted good but there was something wrong with the cheese. But if you're looking at the comfort level, it ranks quite high and the good side of easy-going service is that you can sit there for as long as you'd like!:P:D

Good food, mediocre ambience and not that expensive. The starters are really good, and so are all the mojitos and other beverages.
